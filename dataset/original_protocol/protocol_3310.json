    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of bone marrow derived CD103+ dendritic cells (BMDCs)\nTiming: 10–14 days\nThe following section describes the isolation of mouse bone marrow cells, as well as the differentiation and characterization of CD11c+/CD103+ DCs based on a previous publication.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] While the yield may vary between mice, we usually obtain 40–60 million cells from both femurs of a 7–9-week-old female BALB/c mouse. Freshly isolated mouse bone marrow cells are differentiated with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3 ligand) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), then phenotypically characterized using flow cytometry for CD11c+/CD103+ DCs expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.\nObtain femurs from a 7–9-week BALB/c mouse.\nSpray mouse surface with 70% ethanol after it has been euthanized according to the institution’s protocol.\nDissect out both femurs without breaking the epiphyses, and carefully remove the muscle and fibrous tissues without damaging the bones. Use a Kimwipe saturated with 70% ethanol to remove excess muscle if necessary.\nCritical: The bone must remain intact in order to obtain non-contaminated bone marrow cells with high viability.\nNote: Typically, we begin by removing the soft tissue surrounding the femur to expose the epiphysis as the starting point for dissection. The femur is then dissected from the epiphysis using a sharp and fine dissection scissor. It is critical to process gently and carefully to avoid excessive pressure or force that damages bones. Maintaining an intact bone can greatly help in preventing bone marrow contamination and preserving cell viability.\nPlace the bones in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of ice-cold sterile PBS. Transport on ice.\nNote: If more bone marrow is needed, other long bones, such as the tibia and humerus, can be harvested from the same mouse for bone marrow isolation.",
    "Collect bone marrow cells from the femur. The following steps should be performed under a tissue culture hood to avoid contamination.\nRinse the bones in 70% ethanol, then wash them in ice-cold sterile PBS to remove ethanol. Transfer the bones into a sterile Petri dish that contains 7 mL of basic immune cell medium.\nConnect a 25-gauge needle to a 5 mL syringe filled with basic immune cell medium.\nCut off both epiphyses using sterile scissors. Hold the bone with forceps while flushing the marrow into the Petri dish.\nNote: Flush the bone from both ends and scrape its inner surfaces with needle as needed. 5 mL of media is usually sufficient to flush all the bone marrow from one femur. If necessary, repeat the flushing process until the bone appears pale. The change in color of the femur from red to pale indicates that the bone marrow has been fully removed.\nTransfer all cells from the Petri dish through a 40 μm strainer into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nWash the Petri dish and strainer twice with 7 mL basic immune cell medium to collect the remaining cells. Discard the strainer and cap the Falcon tube with cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nNote: In this protocol, we used an Eppendorf benchtop centrifuge with a swinging-bucket rotor that accommodates 50/15 mL Falcon tubes for cell pelleting. Alternatively, depending on the available laboratory equipment, other centrifuge models may also be utilized.\nNote: The cell pellets are currently red.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL of 1× Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis Buffer and incubate on ice for 5–10 min with occasional shaking.\nAdd 20–30 mL of basic immune cell medium to stop the reaction.",
    "Pellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: White cell pellets indicate sufficient lysis of red blood cells.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL DC medium. Count cells and adjust to 2×106 viable cells/mL. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.1].\nNote: Cell viability is expected to be >90%.\nNote: For cell counting, we typically mix 10 μL cell suspension and 10 μL trypan blue to stain and exclude dead cells. Load 10 μL of this mixture onto a hemocytometer for manual counting. Alternatively, automated cell counters that distinguish live and dead cells can be used.\nDifferentiate bone marrow cells into CD11c+/CD103+ DCs in the presence of Flt3 ligand (200 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (1 ng/mL).\nTransfer the cell suspension from the Falcon tube into a T75 flask, then place the flask into a regular cell culture incubator.\nNote: We typically get 20–30 mL of cell suspension containing 2×106 cells/mL from one mouse. This results in 40–60 million cells in total, which can be maintained in a T75 flask. If more cells are collected, divide them into several flasks based on the final volume. Conversely, if the cell count is low, resuspend the cells to 2 × 106 cells/mL and transfer them to a smaller flask (e.g., T25) aligned with the final volume.\nOn Day 6, transfer half of the cell suspension (10–15 mL) into a sterile Falcon tube. Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellets in the same amount of fresh DC medium (10–15 mL) and place them back in the old flask.\nOn Day 9, gently tap the flask and harvest all non-adherent cells, then count the cell number.\nNote: DCs generated here using GM-CSF and Flt3 ligand are primarily non-adherent cells.",
    "Based on the cell count, calculate the total volume of cell suspension required to achieve a target density of 3×106 viable cells/mL.\nNote: We typically obtain a concentration of roughly 1–2.5 × 06 cells/mL from this step. Using a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL in 30 mL as an example, concentrating the suspension to 20 mL would be required to achieve 3 × 106 cells/mL.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove sufficient supernatant to leave the cells at twice the target density.\nDilute the DCs to 3×106 cells/mL by adding an equal volume of fresh DC medium and resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting. Transfer the entire cell suspension to a new T75 flask and return it to the incubator.\nNote: If the cell count is low, adjust the suspension to 2–3 × 106 viable cells/mL and move the cells to a smaller flask (like a T25) that corresponds to the final volume.\nNote: Handle the cells gently to prevent mechanical stress.\nNote: From Day 10, CD11c+/CD103+ DCs can be identified and used for coculture assays, although their percentages may be low. Extending the incubation time to 14 days usually leads to a higher percentage of CD11c+/CD103+ DCs.\nPerform another DC medium change on Day 12 as described above.\nPhenotype CD103+ DCs on Day 14.\nExamine DC morphology under a phase contrast microscope prior to harvesting. Typically, CD103+ DCs display strongly branched dendrites.\nGently tap the flask and transfer 2 mL of cell suspension into a FACS tube.\nNote: CD103+ DCs usually remain suspended individually or cluster together by Day 14.\nCount cells and make an aliquot of 3×105 viable cells for surface staining in a new FACS tube.",
    "Note: We typically obtain approximately 1 × 106 viable cells (above 3 × 105) from a 2 mL cell suspension. If the cell counts fall below this or if additional cells are required for further characterization or other experiments, a larger volume of cell suspension could be collected.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to the FACS tube with 3×105 viable cells. Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellets in 100 μL PBS containing Zombie Yellow diluted at 1:2000 and incubate for 15 min at ∼23°C in the dark.\nOptional: Add 0.5 μg anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody to the Zombie Yellow live/dead staining buffer to block Fc receptors.\nTo wash the cells, add 2 mL of Cell Staining Buffer, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nStain the surface proteins with the following antibody panel in a final volume of 100 μL. Incubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3077_4.csv\nNote: Preparing a single stained control for compensation using cells or UltraComp eBeads is recommended.\nNote: Adding Brilliant Stain Buffer may improve staining results when using antibodies conjugated with BD Horizon Brilliant dyes, including Brilliant Violet 711.\nWash samples with 1 mL of Cell Staining Buffer, then centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend cell pellets in 300 μL Cell Staining Buffer and analyze by flow cytometry. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] shows the representative phenotypic profile of CD11c+/CD103+ DCs.

    "Bone marrow cells were cultured with GM-CSF (1 ng/mL) and Flt3 ligand (200 ng/mL) for 14 days before harvesting for flow cytometry analysis. A, Flow cytometry gating strategy for BMDCs. Cells were first gated based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), then gated for single live cells by size (FSC-A and FSC-H) and Zombie yellow exclusion. To identify DCs, the single viable cells were gated on co-expression of CD11c and CD103.

Gray lines indicate unstained controls, while red lines represent stained BMDCs.\nPause point: Freshly stained cells can be kept at 4°C in the dark for up to 2 h before analysis. Alternatively, cells can be fixed in 2% PFA for 15 min at ∼23°C, followed by one wash with PBS and resuspension in 300 μL of Cell Staining Buffer. The fixed cells should be stored at 4°C in the dark for up to a week before analysis.\nNote: The percentage of CD11c+/CD103+ DCs in the single live cell population is expected to reach 70% on Day 14.\nIn vitro preparation of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells\nTiming: 5 days",
    "Multiple reagents have been found to induce senescence in tumor cells.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] Here, we utilize the topoisomerase poison etoposide (2 μM) and the Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) inhibitor GSK461364 (2 μM) to trigger senescence in the murine colon carcinoma cell line CT26. Senescent cells (SnCs) are often characterized by the upregulation of lysosomal β-galactosidase, also known as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal),5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] which can be detected through the SA-β-Gal staining assays.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] Among various SA-β-Gal substrates, one of the most widely used is X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside), which produces a blue precipitate when cleaved, allowing visualization under a microscope.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] This section describes the protocol for evaluating tumor cell senescence using X-Gal in vitro. The senescence inducers used here have been successfully applied to other mouse tumor cell lines, including murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 and melanoma B16. It is important to note that this protocol may require optimization when using alternative senescence inducers or different cell lines.\nMaintain CT26 cells.\nPrewarm complete RPMI medium, PBS, and trypsin-EDTA in a 37°C bead bath.\nPassage cells once they have reached 80%–90% confluence.\nRemove the cell culture medium and rinse the cells once with PBS.\nAdd 4 mL of trypsin-EDTA to the T75 flask and rock gently to completely cover the cells.\nIncubate the flask at 37°C for approximately 2 min.\nOnce the cells have detached, add 8 mL of pre-warmed complete RPMI medium and disperse the cells by gently pipetting.\nNote: If working with cell lines sensitive to trypsin-EDTA, pellet the cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min. Following that, discard the supernatant to remove residual trypsin-EDTA, and resuspend the cells in complete RPMI medium.\nTransfer 1/4–1/8 volumes of the cell suspension to a new T75 flask and add 15 mL of complete RPMI medium. Return the cells to the incubator.",
    "Note: Performing experiments on cells within ten passages is recommended.\nInduce senescence using etoposide or GSK461364.\nSeed 2.5×104 CT26 cells with 1 mL medium in each well of a 12-well plate and allow them to attach overnight (12–16 h).\nNote: If using a different-sized cell culture plate, adjust the cell seeding density according to the well's surface area.\nAdd etoposide or GSK461364 to a final concentration of 2 μM. An equal amount of DMSO vehicle should be applied to the control cells.\nNote: Consider reducing the incubation time for non-senescent control cells to avoid overgrowth.\nCulture the cells in the presence of senescence inducers for 5 days.\nNote: If other cell lines or senescence inducers are used, cell seeding density, senescence inducer dose, and senescence induction timing may need to be optimized. Ideally, both the SnCs and the non-senescent controls should achieve a confluency of 70%–80% by the time of SA-β-Gal staining.\nNote: It is critical to seed the cells at an appropriate density for senescence induction. In our experience, we aim for 30%–50% confluence at the time of drug treatment. This prevents cells from overgrowing prior to entering senescence. We have noticed that cells at high density often exhibit reduced responsiveness to senescence inducers.\nNote: For senescence induction, we usually do not change the medium during the 5-day incubation period. In case the medium needs to be supplemented/replaced due to evaporation, ensure that the added medium contains the same concentration of senescence inducers or DMSO vehicle.\nCharacterize senescence using X-Gal.\nBefore SA-β-Gal staining, examine the cell morphology under a phase contrast microscope as SnCs typically adopt a flat, enlarged cell morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3077-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The mean ± SD percentage of SA-β-Gal-positive cells from five 20× fields is indicated. Scale bars: 100 μm.\nNote: For SA-β-Gal staining, a cell confluency between 70%–80% is optimal. While a lower confluency is acceptable, exceeding it may lead to false positive staining results.\nRemove the cell culture medium and gently wash the cells once with PBS.\nFix cells in 2% PFA for 3–5 min.\nCritical: Fixation beyond 5 min may inhibit SA-β-Gal activity and cause false negative staining results.\nStain the cells overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C with SA-β-Gal staining solution as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3077_5.csv\nNote: Prewarm the SA-β-Gal staining solution to 37°C and filter it through a 0.2 μm syringe filter to remove X-Gal precipitate before applying to cells.\nNote: We typically add 1 mL of SA-β-Gal staining solution to each well of a 12-well plate. If a different-sized cell culture plate is used, adjust the staining solution volume accordingly.\nNote: The incubation time may need to be optimized for different cell lines.\nGently wash the cells twice with PBS prewarmed to 37°C. Keep the stained cells in PBS for imaging under a microscope with a color camera. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.5].\nNote: In our experience, treatment with 2 μM etoposide or GSK461364 can result in over 90% SA-β-Gal+ senescent CT26 cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPause point: Stained cells can be kept at 4°C in the dark for up to two weeks before imaging. Alternatively, stained cells can be stored in 70% glycerol in the dark at 4°C for longer.",
    "Coculturing of senescent CT26 cells and BMDCs\nTiming: 1–2 days\nIn this session, fresh CD103+ DCs are incubated with senescent tumor cells overnight at an approximate ratio of 2:1. In this example, we used senescent CT26 cells induced by etoposide or GSK461364 on Day 5, along with BMDCs collected on Day 14. If different cell lines or senescence inducers are used, the optimal protocol for senescence induction needs to be determined beforehand. This protocol has been successfully applied to other BALB/c-derived cell lines, including 4T1. When working with C57BL/6 derived tumor cell lines, such as B16 melanoma cells, it is recommended to obtain bone marrow from C57BL/6 mice. Matching the haplotype is particularly critical if the BMDCs are to be utilized for functional assays, such as T cell priming.\nMaintain senescent tumor cells in basic immune cell medium after removing senescence inducers.\nInduce CT26 cell senescence as described above. Cells treated with DMSO vehicle are recommended as non-senescent controls. Cells should be prepared at least in duplicate.\nNote: Non-senescent cells should not be allowed to overgrow when used as controls, potentially requiring shorter incubation times.\nExamine the cell morphology under a microscope before proceeding. Verify that CT26 cells have developed a typical enlarged senescent morphology without too many dead cells.\nFor one of the duplicate samples, wash the cells twice with 2 mL sterile PBS to remove any small molecule residue, while collecting cells from the other sample for cell counting.\nNote: Counting senescent or non-senescent tumor cells is helpful for determining the appropriate number of BMDCs needed for coculture experiments.\nReplace PBS with 1.5 mL fresh basic immune cell medium and return cells to the incubator.",
    "Note: SnCs can be maintained in basic immune cell medium for 4 h–16 h before coculturing with BMDCs. In this medium, senescent cells remain viable, while non-senescent controls continue to proliferate.\nNote: The primary objective of this step is to allow the accumulation of SASP factors in the medium. While we generally keep the senescent cells in the basic immune cell medium for 16 h before coculture with BMDCs, it is noteworthy that BMDC activation has been observed when etoposide-induced senescent cells are preserved in the medium for just 4 h before coculture. The time required to incubate SnCs in basic immune cell medium before coculture may vary depending on their immunogenicity.\nCoculture BMDCs with SnCs.\nCollect DCs in sterile tubes and centrifuge them for 5 min at 300 × g, then decant the medium.\nResuspend DCs in fresh immune cell medium.\nCount viable cells and adjust the concentration to 0.5×106 viable cells/mL.\nAdd BMDCs to SnCs at an approximate ratio of 2:1.\nNote: The number of BMDCs required for each experiment may vary depending on the numbers of senescent and non-senescent cells. As mentioned above, we typically culture adherent SnCs in a 12-well plate, producing approximately 0.5 × 105 SnCs per well. Given that, we usually introduce around 1×105 BMDCs in 200 μL per well into the 12-well plate for coculture experiments. Adjust the BMDC count accordingly if different plate types are used. The same 2:1 ratio should be maintained when coculturing BMDCs with non-senescent control cells. As highlighted earlier, ensure that non-senescent controls do not overgrow before coculture. It's also worth noting that slight deviations from the 2:1 ratio will not affect BMDC responses.\nReturn cells to the incubator and culture overnight (12–16 h).",
    "Note: During coculture, the medium can be supplemented with GM-CSF and Flt3 ligand at final concentrations of 0.2 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL, respectively, to boost the viability of BMDCs.\nNote: During coculture, the BMDCs are exposed to the SASP, come in contact with SnCs, and take up SnC membranes and cytoplasm via phagocytosis or trogocytosis, each of which may influence DC phenotypes. We have observed that DC activation can occur as soon as 10 h after exposure to etoposide induced CT26 SnCs. The time required to detect DC activation triggered by SnCs may vary depending on the senescence induction methods and the immunogenicity of the SnCs.\nNote: It is important to incorporate appropriate controls to enable reliable assessment of BMDC activation and maturation. Unstimulated BMDCs may be used as a negative control while stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 μg/mL) can serve as a positive control.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]\nCharacterization of BMDC maturation and activation\nTiming: 4 h",
    "To assess the activation and maturation of CD103+ BMDCs, the expression levels of various surface markers can be evaluated through flow cytometry. Here, these markers include the upregulation of co-stimulatory factors CD80 and CD86, as well as the class I MHC molecule H-2Kd. CD80 and CD86 play critical roles in initiating and sustaining T cell responses by interacting with CD28 and potentially other unidentified receptors on T cell surface. MHC class I molecules present antigens to CD8+ T cells and regulate T cell activation and proliferation through TCR signals.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] We also examine PD-L1 expression on the DC surface, which dampens T cell activity.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] This is because PD-L1 is upregulated by a variety of stimuli,23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] including Type I interferons (IFNs) and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines that can be secreted by SnCs as components of the SASP.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] It is noteworthy that class I MHC molecules expressing haplotype b, such as H-2Kb, should be analyzed when using DCs derived from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice.\nHarvest BMDCs into FACS tubes.\nGently pipette the cocultured cells up and down, then transfer all the suspended cells to a FACS tube.\nRinse the well with 1 mL of PBS to collect the remaining cells.\nNote: In the cocultures, the SnCs typically remain adherent while the BMDCs can be readily suspended, allowing them to be collected selectively simply by swirling and pipetting.\nPellet the cells at 300 × g for 5 min, then decant the supernatant.\nStain the BMDCs for flow cytometric analysis. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9].\nResuspend cell pellets in 100 μL PBS containing Zombie Yellow diluted at 1:2000 and 0.5 μg anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody, then incubate for 15 min at ∼23°C in the dark.",
    "Add 2 mL of Cell Staining Buffer to the FACS tube to wash the cells, followed by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min and discarding the supernatant.\nPrepare the surface protein staining solution as follows. Add 100 μL of staining solution to each sample and incubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3077_6.csv\nNote: Preparing single stained control samples for compensation is recommended.\nNote: If additional activation markers are investigated, it is necessary to titrate the corresponding antibodies and ensure the flow cytometry panel is compatible. DCs stimulated by LPS can be used to evaluate antibody performance, especially for activation markers.\nFor washing cells, add 2 mL of Cell Staining Buffer to the FACS tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellets in 300 μL Cell Staining Buffer and analyze the cells by flow cytometry.\nNote: Freshly stained BMDCs can be kept on ice or at 4°C for up to 2 h before analysis. Alternatively, cells can be fixed in 2% PFA for 15 min at ∼23°C and kept at 4°C for future analysis.\nNote: For our flow cytometry experiments, we utilized a BD LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer. This analyzer also provides a high throughput mode compatible with 96-well plates. While we typically collect, stain, and analyze samples using FACS tubes, 96-well round bottom polystyrene plates can also be utilized when a plate-based approach is preferred."
