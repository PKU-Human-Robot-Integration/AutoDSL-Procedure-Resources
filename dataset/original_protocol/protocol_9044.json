  "procedures": [
    "1. Larval Rearing\nKeep fly strains or genetic crosses in mass culture at 25 째C on corn meal medium under a 12-hr light-12-hr dark cycle in a fly incubator equipped with light and timer.\nDilute backer yeast in water to form a fluid paste (10 g of backer yeast diluted with 3-4 ml distilled H2O). Add a small drop to the corn meal food and cover the vials. Let dry for at least one hour to avoid adult flies sticking to the yeast paste. Putting a small drop of yeast diluted in water on the surface of the food can enhance oviposition. Alternatively baker yeast paste, 20% acetic acid (AcOH) (Sigma Aldrich, Switzerland A6283-100ML) can be used. For this, dip the tip of a Q-tip on the solution and spread on the corn meal food surface. \nPut adult flies (at least four days old, but not older than ten days) in corn meal food vials. Put enough adults into each vial in order to obtain sufficient larvae to repeat the preference test several times and allow statistical comparison. For genetic crosses, we typically use a minimum of 20 females and 5-10 males per vial, but some lines require more females to obtain a sufficient larval offspring.\nAllow adults to lay eggs for 12 hr and transfer them to new vials. Adults can be transferred in the morning and the evening. We usually transfer adults for seven to ten days and if required take new adults.",
    "Keep the egg collections taken every 12 hr in the incubator and let grow the larvae at 25 째C, 12-hr light-12-hr dark cycle and 60% humidity. To test for circadian components of visual behavior move larvae to constant darkness (DD) 48 hr after egg collection (corresponding to two-light-dark cycles). For this, use a separate incubator without light but keep all other conditions such as temperature and humidity identical. Be sure to transfer the vials to the DD incubator just before the switch to the dark phase. Before moving the vials to another incubator put vials in a cardboard box or wrap the vials with aluminum foil to prevent light exposure during the transfer (packing in cardboard box or wrapping has to be done during the \"lights-on phase\" prior to the shift between incubators). Prevent the animals from any light exposure after this point and until experiments start.\nAfter 4 days (84 to 108 hr from egg laying) collect early L3 (feeding larvae) at the time points to be tested (see 4. Light preference test, point. 4.4.). \n2. Test Setup\nPerform experiments in a dark room with constant temperature and humidity conditions.",
    "To keep two quadrants of the Petri dish in darkness, cover the lid with black tape and aluminum foil. In order to do so, mark the center of the lid circumference. Also mark four points in the border of the lid with 90 째 of separation among them. To make it easier, draw a 20 cm square divided in four quadrants of 10 cm length on a sheet of paper or with help of a computer. Cut 10 cm squares of aluminum foil and black tape (Figure 1A). Cover two opposite quadrants by gluing a square of aluminum foil, as first layer and black tape covering it, be careful to also cover the border of the lid.\n    In the past two slightly distinct forms of this assays were used. We here use the \"quarter-plate\" assay, in which the Petri dish is divided in four equal quarters10. In the alternative \"half-plate\" assay the Petri dish is divided half (half exposed to light, half in darkness)1,7,8. Until today no significant differences between the two assays has been published.\nGlue a quadrant sheet such as the one used for marking the lids right under the light source on the table. Mark the circumference of a Petri dish centered on the quadrants intersection. Use the marks as reference to place the test plate always in the same position under the light source.",
    "Install a lamp, either a simple white light bulb (Phillips, Softtone 5W) or a LED lamp (LED lamp, 80012 White, Osram) above the Petri dish with the help of an iron support stand (Fisher Scientific, S47808). Adjust the height in a way that the whole test plate is homogenously illuminated. We strongly recommend the use of LED lamps since they emit more specific wavelengths than conventional light bulbs. Moreover LEDs emit less heat. \nAdjust light intensity with the help of a photometer (Environment Meter PCE EM882). To achieve the required light intensity of 350-760 lux, move the lamp up or down as required. Plugging the lamp to an adjustable power supply gives more flexibility to change intensities without moving the lamp (Figure 1B). \n3. Plates Preparation \nMake 200 ml of 2.5 % agar (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland A5093-500G) with double distilled water (Millipore).  \nPlace Petri dishes on a table (90-mm diameter; Greiner Bio-One GmbH, 4550 Kremsmeinster, Austria) in rows to allow pouring hot agarose. \nBoil the agarose in a microwave until the solution is completely transparent and fluid. Make sure that liquid solution does not contain bubbles. CAUTION: Transport carefully to the table since the solution can be very hot! \nPour hot agarose into the Petri dishes until the whole surface is homogenously covered with a thin layer of the solution, about two or three millimeters are enough. Be quick to prevent agarose solidifying before coating all plates. Let the plates cool down. Store plates at room temperature and use them only on the same day of preparation. \n4. Light Preference Test",
    "Work under red light conditions in the experiment room to prevent light influence before the test since Drosophila is not able to sense red wavelengths of light. Use a red light bulb (Phillips, PFE712E*8) mounted in a lamp to illuminate the place to work.\nMaintain temperature through all experiments at 25 째C. Control room temperature by means of a heater or cooling device if required.\nTake some food from the vials reared for two-day cycles under constant darkness (from section 1). Since larvae are usually digging on the surface of the food, take the uppermost layer (about 5 mm deep) with help of a spatula (Fisher Scientific, 14-373-25A). Spread the food on the outer side of a Petri dish lid, add some water and mix gently with the spatula. \nCollect feeding L3 larvae from the food. As light preference will be tested, choosing only early/feeding L3 larvae is crucial since the negative phototaxis is assured. Late/wandering L3 larvae or big larva crawling on the food presumably already switched their photobehavior. Feeding L3 larvae (negative phototactic) can be recognized because their anterior spiracles are open and protruded to the outside in a finger-like form. The posterior spiracles have three openings each, and four groups of large branched hairs. The salivary glands extend to the second abdominal segment11. Staging larva under a microscope is convenient whereas no white light should be used. A red light lamp is necessary to illuminate the larvae if staging under stereoscopic microscope before experiments is required.",
    "Wash larvae briefly in tap water and collect early-feeding third-instar larvae (still in red light). Before transferring the larvae to the test plate, take the larvae with a wet paintbrush and carefully absorb excess water with a paper towel or filter paper. Do not dry larvae too excessively since it could harm the animal and influence its behavior.\nUsing the wet paintbrush carefully transfer the larvae to plates. Place a group of approximately 30 larvae in the center of the plate. Cover the plate with the lid already prepared with the quadrants and set the plate under the light source ready for experiment (see section 2). \nTurn on the white light lamp and start the timer. Let the larva move freely on the plate for 5 min, then quickly remove the lid and count the number of larvae in the dark and in the light quadrants. Marking the position of each larva with a marker can ease the counting. Alternatively take a picture of the plate and count a posteriori. Larvae showing unclear light preference, like larvae crawling on the walls or burrowing into agar should be considered as neutral preference and just be included in the total number of larvae when the light preference index is calculated.  \nAfter counting, discard the plate with larvae and replace with a new test plate for the next experiment. Collect used plates in an autoclave plastic bag for later handling and disposal.\nOnce you have performed a sufficient number of experiments a new genotype can be tested. 10-15 trials per genotype are sufficient for analysis. \n5. Data Analysis",
    "For convenience transfer the data to a datasheet as Excel (Microsoft) or Origin (Origin Lab) on a computer for further statistical analysis. Arrange in one column the number of animals in darkness, in a second column the number of animals in light quadrants and in the third the total of animals in the plate (including \"neutral\" larvae).\nCalculate the preference index (PREF) for the darkness for each experiment using the following formula:\n    PREF(darkness) = (number of larvae in dark - number of larvae in light)/total number of larvae \nCompare statistically a set of data with an appropriate analysis for groups. Here, we use a Wilcoxon test to compare statistically two groups. An ANOVA test with a Tukey's multiple-comparison post hoc test can be done, if normal distribution assumption is fulfilled in a manifold group comparison. \nMake graphs that show clearly comparisons among lines and time points along the day cycle. We use Origin Software (Origin Lab) to test statistical significance and generate appropriate graphs, but any other statistical software can be helpful.\nSubscription Required.
