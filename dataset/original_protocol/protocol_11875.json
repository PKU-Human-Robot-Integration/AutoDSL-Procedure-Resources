    "1. Artificial Pollination\nNOTE: Before starting the process, a pair of No. 5 forceps is required.\nGrow A. thaliana (Col-0) at 22 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle in a growth chamber.\nNOTE: Cut and remove the first developed flower stalk with scissors to promote development of axillary buds. Vigorously growing plants (2-3 weeks after cutting of the first stalk; plant height about 25 cm) are suitable for analysis.\nTo emasculate, remove sepal (Figure 1B), petal (Figure 1C), and stamen (Figure 1D) of flower buds at stage 118 (Figure 1A) using No. 5 forceps. Bud with bits of petals seen at the top is best.\nNOTE: Use a suitable female gamete marker line. In this protocol, we used a wild type plant as the female parent.\nFifteen to eighteen hours after emasculation, take the stamen of a DMP9KD/HTR10-mRFP flower at stage 138 by pinching the filament with forceps.\nTo pollinate, gently pat the stigma of an emasculated pistil several times with a dehiscent anther.\n2. Preparation of Ovule for Observation\nNOTE: The following items are required: a slide glass with double-sided tape attached, No. 5 forceps, a 27 G injection needle, and a dissecting microscope.\n7 to 8 h after pollination (HAP), collect the pistil and place it on the double-sided tape, then press gently with forceps to fix the pistil on the tape (Figure 2A,A’).\nNOTE: Most ovules in a pistil receive at least one pollen tube 10 HAP9. If both or any one of the sperm cells from the first pollen tube fail to fertilize, a second pollen tube would be attracted by the ovule due to the fertilization recovery system10. To analyze the sperm nuclei morphology from the first pollen tube, it is recommended to complete ovule preparation by 10 HAP at the latest.",
    "Cut off the upper and lower ends of the ovary using an injection needle under a dissecting microscope (Figure 2B,B’).\nSlit the ovary wall along both sides of the replum (Figure 2C,C’) by moving the tip of the injection needle.\nNOTE: Insert the injection needle shallowly to prevent ovule separation from the septum.\nEvert the ovary wall by using the injection needle (Figure 2D,D’).\nPinch the base of the septum to which ovules are connected, and lift it up carefully with forceps (Figure 2E).\nTransfer the ovules into a drop of water on a slide glass, and gently cover with a cover glass for observation under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2E,E’).\n3. Microscopy\nNOTE: In this protocol, we used an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescence filter cube (see Table of Materials), a digital camera, and the accompanying software.\nAcquire images of ovules containing sperm nuclei labeled with mRFP using a 20x or 40x objective lens and the equipped digital camera.\nConfirm the number of mRFP-labeled sperm nuclei in an embryo sac.\nNOTE: Ovules containing two mRFP-labeled sperm nuclei can be included in the population size for statistical analysis.\nConfirm the shape and position of each mRFP-labeled sperm nucleus in an embryo sac.\nNOTE: Immediately after being released from a pollen tube, a pair of condensed mRFP-labeled sperm nuclei are localized between the egg and the central cell. A decondensed mRFP-labeled sperm nucleus detected at the side of chalazal end indicates central cell fertilization, for instance. By using a suitable female gamete membrane marker line, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1, whether or not the sperm cell is undergoing plasmogamy (after membrane fusion but before karyogamy) can be monitored clearly.\nSubscription Required.
