    "All the procedures including animal subjects have been approved by the Ethical Review Committee in the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.\n1. Material Preparation\nSterilize the 0.65 µm filters with ultraviolet rays produced under the ultraviolet ray lamp on the clean bench for 4 h and turn the filters over after the 2 h mark.\n\tNOTE: When working with UV light, wear appropriate protection.\nSterilize the stainless steel meshes with the autoclave sterilizer at 121 °C for 30 mins.\n\tNOTE: A certain height of stainless steel mesh is needed to support the filters at the air-liquid interface and this can be realized with the wire on the steel mesh (Figure 1A).\nDilute Fluoxetine to a final concentration of 10 µM into the M5300 long-term culture medium and mix evenly.\n\tNOTE: For a six-well plate, 2 mL M5300 long-term culture medium is appropriate for each well. Hydrocortisone at 10-6 M can be selectively diluted into the medium.\nTransfer the medium supplemented with Fluoxetine at 10 µM into six-well plates or dishes and put the sterilized stainless steel meshes into the medium.\nWash the 0.65 µm filters with boiling water two times for 3 mins each time in the glass cell culture dish for sterilization. After each washing, put the filters into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 mins and place the wet filters onto the stainless steel meshes standing at the air-liquid interface as shown in Figure 1A [schematic in the center].\n\tNOTE: Boiling water can be generated with the autoclave sterilizer to achieve the asepsis and equipment should be taken out of autoclave sterilizer in a timely fashion to avoid a decrease in temperature.\n2. AGM Explant Culture\nCarefully separate the AGM regions from the embryos at E10.5 or E11 with forceps.",
    "Strip the uteruses from pregnant mice with the dissecting scissors and separate the embryos from the uteruses.\nWipe off the yolk sac, umbilical cord, and viscera from the embryo body.\nCarefully remove the dorsal nerve tissues and surrounding muscular tissues.\nCut off the tissues with the forceps at the site of anterior and hind limbs and separate the AGM region from the embryo body. Figures 1B-C show the schematic representation and morphology of dissected AGM.\nExplant the dissected AGMs separately onto the filters at the air-liquid interface (Figure 1A) and culture in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2 - 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Do not place the dissected AGM onto the wire of the steel mesh and make sure the filters are at the air-liquid interface during culture. Besides the AGM, yolk sac and fetal liver can also be cultured with this system7.\n3. Expression Analyses\nmRNA level\nCollect the cultured AGMs into 1 mL PBS and centrifuge at 4 °C, 310 x g for 6 min.\nAfter removing the supernatant, total RNA is extracted from the collected AGMs with a monophasic solution of phenol, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nTotal RNA (2 µg) is then reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase to obtain cDNA as the template. The quantitative real-time PCR assays are performed with SYBR Green and Gapdh is used as the internal control.\nProtein level\nCollect the cultured AGM as described above in step 3.1.1.\nPrepare the protein from the cultured AGM with the cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, and 0.5% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor and use for western blotting to detect the protein level as previously described13.\n4. Colony-Forming Units in the Culture (CFU-C) Assay",
    "After culturing for 2 - 3 days, collect the AGM regions into 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuge at 4 °C, 310 x g for 6 mins and dissociate with 200 µL collagenase (0.1% in PBS) at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The time needed for collagenase to generate single cell-suspensions is about 20 mins. Shaking the tube containing AGM every 5 mins can accelerate the digestion process. 200 µL 0.1% collagenase is used for each AGM and 200 µL 10% serum is used to stop the reaction.\nCulture single cell-suspensions in M3434 medium in ultra-low attachment 24-well plates.\n\tNOTE: To avoid contamination, Penicillin-Streptomycin solution can be selectively added into the medium. Because the M3434 medium is viscous, a 1.0 cc syringe without a needle is used to mix the cells and medium.\nAfter 7 - 10 days culturing at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the number for each type of colonies including Burst forming unit--erythroid (BFU-E), CFU-granulo-monocyte (CFU-GM) and CFU-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) are distinguished based on the morphology and scored with an inverted microscope (Figure 2C).\n5. In Vivo  Transplantation Assay\nColony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S) assay\nAfter 2 - 3 days of explant culturing, collect the AGMs and prepare single cell-suspensions by incubating with 200 µL collagenase (0.1% in PBS) for 20 min.\nPerform lethal irradiation (9 Gy of X-rays) of 8- to 10-week old male C57BL/6 mice 4 - 5 h before cell injection.\nPut the irradiated mouse into a restrainer to restrict its activity.\nWipe the tail using a cotton swab steeped in 75% alcohol to promote vasodilatation of the vein.\nInject 0.5 embryo equivalent (ee) or 1 ee single cell-suspensions of AGM intravenously into the tail vein of irradiated mouse with a 1.0 cc syringe.",
    "NOTE: Cells are suspended with PBS and 0.5 mL PBS per recipient is a suitable volume. A needle of 25 gauge or 26 gauge size is used for injection with a 1.0 cc syringe. No air can be introduced into the syringe. Press the injection site with an antiseptic swab to stop bleeding.\nEleven days post transplantation, collect and fix the spleens of the recipient mice in Bouin's solution (15 mL 1.22% Picric acid saturated aqueous solution, 2 mL 40% methanol and 1 mL acetic acid) for 1 - 2 days and wash with 80% alcohol for another 1 - 2 days. Count the visible colonies in the spleen macroscopically and determine the number of colonies per ee.\n\t\t​NOTE: Bouin's fixative, wear appropriate protection.\nLong-term transplantation assay\nAfter 2 - 3 days explant culturing, collect the AGMs and prepare single cell-suspensions by incubating with 200 µL collagenase (0.1% in PBS) for 20 min.\nPerform lethal irradiation (9 Gy of X-ray) of 8- to 10-week old male C57BL/6 mice 4 - 5 hrs before cell injection.\nPut the irradiated mouse into a restrainer to restrict its activity.\nWipe the tail using a cotton swab steeped in 75% alcohol to promote vasodilatation of the vein.\nInject 0.5 embryo equivalent (ee) or 1 ee single cell-suspensions of AGM intravenously into the tail vein of an irradiated mouse with a 1.0 cc syringe. AGM are injected at a dose of 1 ee per recipient with 2×105 bone marrow cells (CD45.1 background).\n\t\tNOTE: No air can be introduced into the syringe. Press the injection site with an antiseptic swab to stop bleeding.\nFour months post-transplantation, collect the bone marrow of the recipient and use it for the reconstitution assay by FACS. Only the recipients with ≥10% donor-derived chimerism are considered to exhibit successful reconstitution.",
