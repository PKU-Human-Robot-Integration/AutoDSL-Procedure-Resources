    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Isolation of chromatin after induction of enzyme-mediated double-strand breaks\nTiming: 8 h\nOn this day, enzyme-mediated DSBs are induced in cells, after which DNA-binding proteins are cross-linked to DNA. The cells are then harvested, lysed, and the resulting DNA is sheared by sonication.\nNote: This protocol is described for cultured U2OS cells grown in 150 mm dishes, containing ∼12–18 × 107 cells per dish.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, remove media from each 150 mm dish of cells and wash once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAspirate media by tipping the dish towards the vacuum aspirator.\nGently wash the cells once by adding 20 mL sterile PBS warmed to 20°C–22°C.\nNote: Aim the pipettor to the wall of the dish to avoid dislodging the cells.\nRemove the PBS by tipping the dish towards the vacuum aspirator.\nNote: These approaches for applying and removing solutions from cells should be maintained for the rest of the protocol.\nInduce DSBs.\nFor U2OS-DSB reporter cells (which stably express ER-mCherry-LacI-FokI-DD), replace the dish with 20 mL of 37°C (low-glucose DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS) containing 0.5 μM Shield-1 and 300 nM 4-OHT for 3 h.\nFor AsiSI-ER U2OS cells (which stably express AsiSI-ER), replace the dish with 20 mL of 37°C (DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS) containing 300 nM 4-OHT for 3 h.\nNote: If multiple dishes are being treated, prepare a master mix of pre-warmed DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS with 0.5 μM Shield-1 and/or 300 nM 4-OHT to be split over all the dishes. This will prevent variations in 4-OHT or Shield-1 concentration between samples. Avoid introducing too many air bubbles into the media.",
    "Critical: An essential control for quantification of ChIP signal is to include not induced samples (with no AsiSI- or FokI-mediated DSBs) such that one can compare the relative recruitment of proteins when DSBs are induced. For not induced samples, replace the dish with warmed DMEM + 10% charcoal-stripped FBS but do not include Shield-1 or 4-OHT.\nKeep the cells incubating at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for the duration of the induction.\nRemove media by vacuum aspiration and gently wash each dish twice with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nNote: Keep the bottle of refrigerated PBS on ice for the washes.\nReplace each dish with 20 mL of serum-free low-glucose DMEM warmed to 20°C–22°C.\nCross-link proteins to DNA.\nImmediately add 556 μL of 37% formaldehyde to each dish to reach a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde.\nGently swirl the dish immediately, then continue mixing by placing the dish on a laboratory rocker set at 10–15 rpm for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCritical: The efficiency of ChIP is sensitive to cross-linking time so this time should be adhered to. Excessive cross-linking may mask or damage the epitopes needed for the immunoprecipitation or lead to false positive ChIP signals.\nNote: ChIP experiments targeting histone post-translational modifications and DNA repair proteins typically require 10 min for cross-linking. On the other hand, ChIP that targets transcription factors may require a longer cross-linking time (up to 30 min), due to lower protein abundance, weak interactions, or transient occupancy time with DNA.",
    "Critical: Formaldehyde (both the liquid and emitted vapor) is a strong irritant, is highly toxic, and is flammable. It is a known carcinogen and repeated exposure may trigger an allergic reaction. Avoid inhaling vapors, ingestion, and contact with skin. Formaldehyde must be handled under the fume hood and with appropriate personal protective equipment, especially gloves, lab coat, and face/eye protection. After use, formaldehyde-containing solutions and consumables they contacted should be disposed of as chemical hazardous waste. Your institution’s environmental health and safety office may have a protocol for disposal of formaldehyde-contaminated solutions or solids.\nNote: Formaldehyde is an effective DNA-protein cross-linker,16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] but its small spacer length (2 Å)17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] may preclude its utility for ChIP experiments on proteins that do not bind directly to DNA but interact with it through protein-protein interactions. More efficient protein-protein cross-linkers can be used in addition to formaldehyde, depending on your need to cross-link over various intermolecular distances.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]\nQuench the cross-linking reaction.\nAdd to each dish 3 mL of 1 M glycine (dissolved in PBS) to obtain a final concentration of 125 mM glycine.\nNote: This will quench unreacted formaldehyde and stop the cross-linking reaction.\nPlace on the rocker at 10–15 rpm for another 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove the formaldehyde-containing DMEM by pipette-aid or vacuum aspiration. Store and dispose of this waste in accordance with the environmental health and chemical safety practices at your institution.\nPlace each dish on ice. Wash gently 3 times with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail.\nNote: cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail comes in tablets that can be directly dissolved in the PBS.\nCollect the cells from each 150 mm dish on ice.",
    "On ice, add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1× cOmplete onto the dish and scrape the cells off the surface using a plastic cell scraper.\nNote: The dish can be tilted to pool and collect the cell suspension.\nWhen the entire surface of the dish has been contacted by the scraper, transfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube on ice.\nAdd another 10 mL of ice-cold PBS with 1× cOmplete to the dish.\nPipette up and down over the dish surface to rinse off residual cells, then transfer these into the same 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: When pipetting over the dish surface, avoid generating an excess of air bubbles.\nSpin down the cell suspension and remove the supernatant from the cell pellet.\nSpin the cell suspension at 250 g for 5 min in a centrifuge pre-chilled to 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant (the PBS), leaving behind the cell pellet.\nNote: Remove most of the supernatant first with the vacuum aspirator. Nearer to the pellet, remove the remaining supernatant with a P1000 micropipette.\nPause point: formaldehyde-cross-linked cell pellets can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nLyse the cells.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Lysis Buffer (supplemented with 2× cOmplete and 1× PhosSTOP) to each cell pellet.\nSlowly pipette up and down 20 times using a P1000 micropipette.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 900 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2261-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Checking for effective lysis\nBrightfield images of AsiSI-ER U2OS cells before (left) and after treatment with ice-cold Lysis Buffer twice for 3 min and two washes in PBS (right). Note the disappearance of the plasma membrane and the remaining shape of the nuclei after lysis. Scale bar: 10 μm.",
    "Note: To check if the Lysis Buffer is working suitably, a 100 mm dish of cells seeded in parallel can be treated on ice with 10 mL of ice-cold Lysis Buffer, then be gently rinsed twice with PBS. Examine the dish surface at 4–10× magnification under a brightfield microscope before and after treatment with Lysis Buffer. Before treatment, U2OS cells should have a morphology typical of adherent cells – a visible periphery extended outwards from a central, rounded nucleus, representative of the plasma membrane. Treatment with Lysis Buffer should cause the periphery to disappear but leave the shape of the nucleus intact (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nWash the resulting nuclei in Lysis Buffer.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a P1000 micropipette.\nGently resuspend the nuclear pellet by pipetting up and down 20 times in 400 μL of ice-cold Lysis Buffer (with cOmplete and PhosSTOP) to wash once.\nCentrifuge at 900 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a P1000 micropipette.\nResuspend the nuclear pellet in Sonication Buffer.\nWith a P1000 micropipette, slowly resuspend the resulting pellet of nuclei in 1.6 mL of ice-cold Sonication Buffer (with cOmplete and PhosSTOP) by pipetting up and down 20 times.\nNote: Avoid generating too many air bubbles.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice.\nNote: The Sonication Buffer contains 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to facilitate efficient, uniform, and reproducible sonication. This concentration of SDS may interfere with the immunoprecipitation by denaturing the antibody and/or epitopes recognized. As such, after sonication and before immunoprecipitation, the SDS will be diluted ten-fold with Dilution Buffer to attain a concentration of 0.1% SDS, which is conducive to immunoprecipitation.\nShear the chromatin by sonication.\nResuspend the nuclear suspension with a P1000 micropipette.\nSplit the volume evenly over five 1.5 mL Bioruptor Pico microtubes, at 300 μL each.",
    "Sonicate the nuclei at 4°C using a pre-chilled Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) at high power for 15 cycles of 30 s on, then 30 s off.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2261-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Optimizing sonication conditions\nFormaldehyde-cross-linked and lysed AsiSI-ER U2OS cells were sonicated in a Bioruptor Pico for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 cycles on high power, each cycle for 30 s on and 30 s off. After centrifugation, soluble and insoluble (pellet) fractions were collected. The cross-links were then reversed in the presence of RNase A for 16 h and the samples digested with Proteinase K for 3 h. The samples were then electrophoresed in 1.8% agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Shearing of DNA can be seen with increasing sonication cycles, along with release of insoluble DNA into the soluble fraction. 15 cycles were ultimately chosen for the ChIP protocol to ensure some larger fragments remaining after 8 cycles were sheared. As purification of DNA (step 30) was omitted prior to electrophoresis, the intense non-specific signal between 300 – 450 bp likely arises from components present in the Sonication Buffer. The image was acquired on an AlphaImager (Alpha Innotech).\nNote: after every 5 cycles, stop the sonicator and flick or vortex the tubes to assure the nuclei are uniformly distributed.\nNote: the Bioruptor Pico sonicator’s water tank must be pre-chilled to 4°C at least 45 min before it is needed. Samples should be kept at 3°C–5°C during the entire sonication process.\nNote: If using Diagenode sonicator models, use only microfuge tubes provided by Diagenode as they are more efficient in conducting sound waves and improve shearing efficiency. In this protocol, we used 1.5 mL Bioruptor Pico microtubes with caps (#C30010016).",
    "Note: Ensure any empty spots in the carousel of the Bioruptor Pico are filled by microtubes with water at equal volume to the samples.\nCritical: Effective sonication is critical for ChIP and will yield chromatin fragments of ∼200–500 bp (1–3 nucleosomes in length). In our hands, the sonication settings listed are sufficient to generate DNA fragments of suitable size, however other sonicator models may yield different fragmentation efficiencies. It is imperative the sonication conditions are tested and optimized (described below) prior to proceeding with a full-scale ChIP experiment, even if one has access to a Bioruptor Pico. Closely follow recommendations from the sonicator’s manufacturer to maximize sonication efficiency.\nNote: To verify that the sonication conditions are efficiently shearing DNA, chromatin samples before and after sonication should be processed to reverse cross-links and digest away RNA and protein (steps 28 – 29) and be purified for DNA (step 30). Resolve the DNA samples by electrophoresis at 100 V in 1.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) buffer, stain with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide, and visualize DNA on an ultraviolet transilluminator (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Suitably fragmented DNA should appear as a smear between ∼200 – 500 bp. If the DNA fragments are too long (inefficient sonication), the power, the number of sonication cycles, the sonication time in each cycle, and the frequency of resuspending the nuclei can be increased. The cell suspension can also be divided over more 1.5 mL Bioruptor Pico microtubes to reduce the number of nuclei per tube and maximize sonication efficiency. If the fragment sizes are too small, the time per sonication, the number of cycles, and/or the power of the Bioruptor can be decreased.\nCollect the fragmented chromatin.\nCentrifuge the sonicated nuclear suspensions at 20000 g for 15 min at 4°C in a pre-chilled microfuge.",
    "Transfer the supernatant (containing fragmented chromatin) and pool into a fresh and pre-chilled microfuge tube, one tube per 150 mm dish.\nPause point: Fragmented chromatin can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for at least 3 months. The samples can be aliquoted into multiple tubes on ice prior to freezing to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nDay 2 – Immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 8–10 h (excluding a long incubation at the end)\nOn this day, the target protein of interest will be isolated from the fragmented chromatin by antibody pull-down (immunoprecipitation).\nNote: to avoid protein degradation, all solutions and samples must be kept on ice or at 4°C.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the fragmented chromatin (step 14) using the Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay kit[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf]. Measure the absorbance of the samples at 562 nm (A562) using a spectrophotometer.\nNote: the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit is compatible with all reagents (particularly the concentrations of the detergents) used in the Sonication Buffer.\nNote: if the protein concentration determined is above the working range of the bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve generated with the kit, dilute a small portion of the fragmented chromatin (e.g., 1–2%) with Sonication Buffer and re-measure A562, multiplying the resulting concentration by the dilution factor (e.g., 1 part sample + 9 parts Sonication Buffer gives a dilution factor of 10).\nEquilibrate the Protein A or Protein G-coupled Dynabeads.\nCalculate the volume of Protein A or G-coupled Dynabeads (Invitrogen, referred to here as “the beads”) required for Day 2.\nNote: You will require 100 μL of beads per immunoprecipitation, which includes 40 μL for pre-clearing (step 19) and 60 μL for the immunoprecipitation itself (steps 20, 21, and 23). Include an additional 10% volume of beads on top of the required volume.",
    "Note: A master mix of Protein A or G Dynabeads suspended in Dilution Buffer will be prepared in step 16e.\nNote: Dynabeads are super-paramagnetic beads and thus will be held at the bottom of a microfuge tube when it is placed on a magnetic rack. They are coupled to Protein A or Protein G. The use of Protein A or Protein G depends on the host and isotype of the chosen antibody; Protein G generally binds to mouse and rat IgGs with higher affinity than Protein A, while Protein A binds to rabbit immunoglobulins with higher affinity than Protein G. Please consult with the manufacturer as to which is better suited for your choice of antibody.\nCritical: Each condition must be immunoprecipitated twice: once using the antibody recognizing the protein of interest and once with a species-/isotype-matched control IgG (referred to as the isotype control, a pool of immunoglobulins purified from animal serum) as a negative control. The isotype control is essential as it is used for normalizing ChIP signal.\nNote: For each condition, one may wish to perform a positive control immunoprecipitation (i.e., targeting an established DSB signaling or repair protein used by the groups who generated the endonuclease-expressing cell lines), along with its isotype control immunoprecipitation. A suitable positive control is immunoprecipitating the homologous recombination effector protein RAD51, and performing qPCR with primer pairs as indicated in step 32. While we have successfully performed ChIP for RAD51 with the H-92 antibody (#sc-8349, Santa Cruz), this antibody was recently discontinued. The Legube group has validated an antibody from Abcam (#ab176458, RRID: AB_2665405) as a replacement.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nWash the Protein A or G Dynabeads.\nNote: As much as possible, Protein A or G Dynabeads should be kept on ice or at 4°C.",
    "Vortex the stock bottle of Protein A or G Dynabeads.\nPipette the volume of beads required into a 2 mL microfuge tube.\nNote: To aid in pipetting, trim the micropipette tip at the front end with clean scissors to widen its diameter.\nAdd 1.5 mL of ice-cold Dilution Buffer and vortex for 10 s.\nTumble the beads end-over-end at 10–15 rpm on a rotating mixer for 5 min in a cold room set to 4°C.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic rack (e.g., a MagJET Separation Rack, Thermo Scientific) for 30 s.\nNote: If it is preferred to have the entire portion of beads collected at the bottom of the tube, the researcher can centrifuge the beads at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C prior to placing the tube on the magnetic rack.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by gentle vacuum aspiration with the tube still on the magnetic rack.\nImmediately add another 1.5 mL of ice-cold Dilution Buffer to the beads, vortex for 10 s, and tumble end-over-end for another 5 min as per step 16b.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic rack for 30 s, and carefully remove the supernatant by gentle vacuum aspiration with the tube still on the magnetic rack.\nResuspend the beads in ice-cold Dilution Buffer, using the same volume as the volume of beads picked up in step 16a.\nNote: Always keep the bead suspension on ice. This master mix of beads will be used in upcoming steps.\nNote: The master mix of beads must be resuspended by vortexing for 5 s before a portion of beads is taken out.\nDilute fragmented chromatin in Dilution Buffer.\nDetermine the volume of fragmented chromatin required to obtain 1 mg of protein, based on the protein concentration determined in step 15.",
    "Note: The amount of chromatin required for an immunoprecipitation may vary and can be altered depending on the abundance of the protein targeted. In general, we use 500 μg to 1 mg of chromatin per immunoprecipitation, however for detection of histones and their modifications 25–100 μg of chromatin may be sufficient.\nResuspend the chromatin by vortex and pipette the required volume of fragmented chromatin (step 17a) into a fresh and pre-chilled 2 mL microfuge tube, 1 tube per immunoprecipitation.\nNote: As the microfuge tubes only hold 2 mL, the volume of chromatin needed cannot exceed 180 μL (with the later addition of 9 volumes of Dilution Buffer, the final volume will be 1.8 mL). If more than 180 μL of chromatin is needed, the immunoprecipitation reaction can be split evenly among multiple 2 mL microfuge tubes.\nNote: For efficient mixing, the final volume of diluted chromatin should be at minimum 400 μL (40 μL fragmented chromatin and 360 μL of Dilution Buffer to be added next). If the chromatin is concentrated such that the required amount can be attained with less than 40 μL, dilute the chromatin in Sonication Buffer before adding it to the 2 mL tube such that at least 40 μL (and less than 180 μL) is used.\nAdd 9 volumes of ice-cold Dilution Buffer (supplemented with 2× cOmplete and 1× PhosSTOP) to each 2 mL tube and mix by vortexing.\nCritical: Diluting the fragmented chromatin in Dilution Buffer is essential as this ensures the SDS in Sonication Buffer is reduced to a concentration of 0.1%, where it interferes less with antibody-antigen binding.\nSave chromatin for the input control.\nFor each immunoprecipitation, vortex and save 1% (1/100) of the volume of diluted fragmented chromatin in a fresh and pre-chilled microfuge tube.",
    "Critical: Saving the input control is essential as it is used to normalize ChIP signal during the quantification.\nNote: Other volumes can be saved, such as 5% (1/20) or 10% (1/10). The proportion saved determines the adjustment to the Ct value for the input control in the subsequent qPCR (Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1], quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nNote: Save 10% of the diluted fragmented chromatin if you wish to perform immunoblot analysis to determine if the immunoprecipitation is working overall (step 21).\nFlash freeze the input control in liquid nitrogen and store at −20°C.\nPre-clear the diluted chromatin.\nFor each immunoprecipitation, add 40 μL of equilibrated Protein A or G Dynabeads (prepared as a master mix in step 16) to the remaining diluted fragmented chromatin in the 2 mL tube.\nCritical: Always vortex the beads immediately before taking from the master mix.\nNote: Always dispense the beads using a micropipette tip trimmed at the front end to widen its diameter.\nTumble the mixture end-over-end at 10–15 rpm on a rotating mixer for 3 h in a cold room set to 4°C.\nNote: This step removes components of chromatin that may bind non-specifically to the Protein A or G Dynabeads.\nBlock the remaining Protein A or G Dynabeads.\nTo the remaining master mix of beads, centrifuge at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C, place on the magnetic rack, and remove residual Dilution Buffer by gentle vacuuming with the tube still on the rack.\nNote: Record the volume of the master mix of beads before vacuum aspiration, for step 20e.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Blocking Buffer to the beads.\nTumble the mixture end-over-end at 10–15 rpm on a rotating mixer for 1 h in a cold room set to 4°C.\nWash the beads once in Dilution Buffer:",

Note the enrichment of phosphorylated RNA polymerase in the immunoprecipitation eluate (immunoreactive band just above 250 kDa) and the abundant non-specific signal present in the flow-through fraction.",
    "Note: The optimum amount of the antibody will vary and should be empirically determined using 2–4 μg as a starting point. For instance, in a pilot experiment to test this protocol up to immunoprecipitation, both 2 and 4 μg of antibody and isotype control can be used in separate immunoprecipitation reactions. After completing immunoprecipitation and the associated washes (step 25), add 100 μL of 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer supplemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol to the beads and heat at 95°C on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf), 1,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein of interest—antibody—Protein A/G complexes will be eluted into the 2× Laemmli. In addition, add 4× Laemmli Sample Buffer and 2-mercaptoethanol to the input control (saved in step 18) and flow-through (step 24) to final concentrations of 1× and 5%, respectively, then heat and mix them as per the beads. All the samples can then be resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electro-transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted for the immunoprecipitated protein of interest (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The amount of antibody used for immunoprecipitation can then be adjusted accordingly. For example, if both 2 and 4 μg of antibody immunoprecipitate the target protein well above the isotype control and at similar efficiencies, 2 μg of antibody can be used in further iterations. If 4 μg is more efficient, that amount should be used in the future. If neither amount is effective, greater amounts can be attempted in further pilot experiments.\nTumble the mixture end-over-end at 10–15 rpm on a rotating mixer for 2 h in a cold room set to 4°C.\nCollect the pre-cleared chromatin.\nContinuing from step 19, centrifuge each microfuge tube of the diluted chromatin at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C.\nPlace each tube on the magnetic rack and wait 30 s.",
    "With the tubes on the rack, carefully transfer the supernatant into a fresh and pre-chilled 2 mL microfuge tube on ice using a P1000 micropipette, one tube per immunoprecipitation. Keep on ice.\nNote: The remaining beads (the pellet) can be discarded.\nImmunoprecipitation.\nContinuing from step 21, centrifuge the antibody-coupled Protein A or G Dynabeads at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C.\nPlace each tube on the magnetic rack for 30 s.\nWith the tubes on the rack, carefully vacuum aspirate the supernatant.\nImmediately wash the beads twice in Dilution Buffer.\nAdd to each tube of beads 1.5 mL of ice-cold Dilution Buffer.\nVortex for 10 s.\nCentrifuge at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C.\nPlace each tube on the magnetic rack for 30 s.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by vacuum aspiration with the tube still on the rack.\nRepeat the above sequence from i.-v. again.\nQuickly add to each tube of antibody-coupled Protein A or G Dynabeads the entire volume of pre-cleared chromatin from the corresponding tube (step 22c).\nIncubate the mixture for 12–18 h in the cold room at 4°C with constant end-over-end tumbling on a rotating mixer at 10–15 rpm.\nDay 3 – Completing the immunoprecipitation and reversing cross-links\nTiming: 4–5 h (excluding a long incubation at the end)\nOn this day, the immunoprecipitated fraction of chromatin is recovered and washed to remove non-specific binding. The formaldehyde cross-links from this fraction are then removed and the protein digested, leaving the DNA, which is then isolated in Day 4.\nSave the flow-through fraction.",
    "Note: This step will help troubleshoot if the immunoprecipitation step is not working. The collected supernatant can assist in immunoblot analysis (see step 21, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) as it contains chromatin that was not immunoprecipitated. Efficient immunoprecipitation will enrich the protein of interest in the fraction eluted from the beads, whereas the flow-through fraction should contain minimal levels of the target protein relative to the input control.\nRecover the protein of interest—antibody—Protein A or G Dynabead complexes by centrifugation at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C.\nPlace each tube on the magnetic rack for 30 s.\nWith the tubes on the rack, carefully collect the supernatant to a fresh and pre-chilled 2 mL microfuge tube using a P1000 micropipette, one tube per immunoprecipitation.

Close the microfuge tube to prevent the beads from drying. Immediately proceed to the next wash.\nWash the beads in the following buffers to remove non-specific binding:\nWash the beads twice in 1.5 mL ice-cold Dilution Buffer.\nWash the beads once in 1.5 mL ice-cold Low Salt Wash Buffer.\nWash the beads once in 1.5 mL ice-cold High Salt Wash Buffer.\nWash the beads once in 1.5 mL ice-cold LiCl Wash Buffer.",
    "Wash the beads twice in 1.5 mL ice-cold TE Buffer.\nElute the target protein from the beads.\nAdd 200 μL of Elution Buffer to each microfuge tube of beads.\nIncubate on the ThermoMixer at 800 rpm for 10 min at 65°C.\nCentrifuge at 20000 g at 20°C–22°C for 2 min.\nWith the tube on the magnetic rack for at least 30 s, transfer the supernatant to one fresh microfuge tube per immunoprecipitation.\nRepeat the above sequence from a.-d., except transfer the supernatant into the same microfuge tube as in d., for a final volume of 400 μL.\nOptional: The remaining beads can be stored at −80°C. In case elution is unsuccessful, the elution can be attempted again.\nIf the final volume is less, adjust with Elution Buffer to reach 400 μL final volume.\nPrepare the input control. Thaw the input control from −80°C (one per immunoprecipitation, step 18). Add Elution Buffer to reach a final volume of 400 μL and vortex.\nReverse DNA-protein cross-links and digest with RNase A.\nAdd 25.6 μL of 5 M NaCl to each input control and immunoprecipitation eluate tube for a final concentration of 300 mM NaCl, then vortex.\nAdd to each tube 4.3 μL of DNase-free RNase A (stock concentration: 10 mg/mL) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL RNase A, then vortex.\nIncubate at 65°C for at least 4 h on the ThermoMixer at 800 rpm.\nNote: this incubation can also be performed for 12–18 h.\nPause point: samples can be stored at −20°C for at least 3 months after the 65°C incubation.\nDay 4 – Genomic DNA extraction and analysis by qPCR\nTiming: 5–6 h (excluding the wait time for qPCR)\nOn this day, the DNA associated with the immunoprecipitation will be cleaned up and quantified by qPCR.\nDigest with Proteinase K.",
    "Centrifuge the input control and immunoprecipitation tubes at 20°C–22°C for 2 min at 20000 g to bring down any condensation.\nAdd to each tube 4.35 μL of DNase-free Proteinase K (stock concentration: 20 mg/mL) to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL Proteinase K, then vortex.\nIncubate at 65°C for 2 h on the ThermoMixer at 800 rpm.\nPurify DNA.\nCentrifuge the input control and immunoprecipitation tubes at 20°C–22°C for 2 min at 20000 g to bring down any condensation. Vortex.\nPurify the DNA from these samples using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen)[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en] according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute the DNA from each sample in 100 μL of the provided EB Buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5).\nPause point: DNA samples can be stored at −20°C for at least 3 months after the purification.\nDetermine the DNA concentration for the input control and immunoprecipitation samples.\nMeasure the fluorescence of the samples in combination with the Pico488 dsDNA Quantification Kit[href=https://www.lumiprobe.com/manual/dsDNA-PicoGreen-quantification-kit] (Lumiprobe) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: when bound to dsDNA, the Pico488 dye fluoresces with an excitation maximum of 503 nm and an emission maximum of 525 nm. This can be detected using a fluorometer or plate reader with fluorescence capability (e.g., FLUOstar Omega microplate reader, BMG LABTECH).\nNote: DNA concentrations above 5 ng/μL are outside the linear range of the Pico488 kit.\nFor more concentrated samples (>5 ng/μL), the absorbance of the samples at 260 nm (A260) can be detected with a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop ND-1000).\nNote: EB Buffer (from the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit) should be used to blank the spectrophotometer.",
    "Note: The Nanodrop ND-1000 should not be used to detect samples below 5 ng/ μL as that is near its detection limit. The spectrophotometer may be more useful for samples from immunoprecipitations of abundant DNA-binding proteins or the input control.\nPerform quantitative PCR with the input control and immunoprecipitation samples as DNA templates with a SYBR Green-based detection system (such as BrightGreen[href=https://www.abmgood.com/pub/media/productdocument/document/b/r/brightgreen2xqpcrmastermix-mastermix-xl-r-s-ic-lr-iso-v5_20181114.pdf] from Abm Inc.). We used the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) for qPCR amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2261_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2261_16.csv\nNote: PCR reaction mix and cycling conditions are listed in Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]. Primer sequences are listed in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: We recommend using RAD51 recruitment to induced DSBs as a positive control for ChIP (step 16). Primers compatible with RAD51 recruitment that we have tested include the pairs for positions p1 and p4 in U2OS-DSB reporter cells and the pair for the locus HR-DSB2.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nNote: As negative controls, we list primer pairs that amplify regions far from the induced DSB sites, such as Control Region for AsiSI-ER U2OS cells and Chromosome 7 for U2OS-DSB reporter cells. As these genomic loci are distal from the induced DSBs, the enrichment of DSB repair proteins (and hence the ChIP signal) should be minimal.\nNote: A suitable negative control for qPCR is the “no template control”, such that all components for the PCR reaction are provided except the template DNA (PCR master mix, forward and reverse primers, water). Amplification should not be detected for these samples during qPCR. If amplification does occur, this suggests the PCR master mix, tubes, or primers may be contaminated with genomic DNA, or that the primers chosen are dimerizing and being amplified by PCR (“primer dimers”).",
    "Note: As SYBR Green binds to nucleic acids without sequence specificity, the amplification of SYBR Green fluorescence upon qPCR may not mean the amplicon of interest has been amplified. Further validation may be required, such as resolving the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the size of the amplicon is as expected. The amplicon can also be sequenced by the Sanger method to ensure the correct genomic locus is being amplified. Amplicons also have a higher melting temperature than primer dimers. This is a result of increased thermostability, as an amplicon is typically longer than a primer dimer and both strands are completely complementary. In contrast, primer dimers exhibit low complementarity to each other and are shorter (30–50 bp in size)."
