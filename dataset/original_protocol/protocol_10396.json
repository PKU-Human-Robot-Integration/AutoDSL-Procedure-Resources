  "procedures": [
    "The protocols described here have been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Australia, and were conducted under strict adherence to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines.\nNOTE: Two chamber protocols are described below. The two different models and their specific chamber designs are illustrated in Figure 1. Chamber (1) is made of polycarbonate (for rat arteriovenous loop chamber model). It is cylindrical with an internal diameter 13 mm and height 4 mm. A window at one point in the wall allows unimpeded access for the pedicle. In the second model (for rat flow-through pedicle chamber model), the chamber is made of polyacrylic and is rectangular (10 x 8 x 4 mm3 internal dimensions). It has two 1.5 mm openings on opposite sides to accommodate the femoral artery and vein as they transgress the chamber.\n1. Rat Arteriovenous Loop Chamber Model (One Chamber Per Animal)\nNOTE: Prior to starting surgery, make sure all the instruments have been properly sterilized. Likewise, ensure the instruments rest on sterile towels and are at a reasonable distance from the surgical field to avoid contamination during the procedure.\nPreparation of the Animal for Surgery\n\t\nUse rats weighing at least 250 g for their large size of vessels for creation of the arteriovenous loop.\nAnaesthetize the animal with 4% isoflurane inhalation. Corroborate adequate depth of anesthesia by assessing unresponsiveness to toe-pinch. After anesthesia, keep the animal adequately anesthetized throughout the procedure with 2% isoflurane.\nPlace the animal in a supine position on a warming pad and apply sterile lubricant to the eyes to prevent desiccation during surgery.\nUsing an electric razor, shave both groins and remove hair with a piece of moist gauze.",
    "Prep the surgical sites with chlorhexidine/70% ethanol solution and drape the animal with sterile towels. Administer a single dose of Carprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) as analgesic.\nHarvest of Femoral Vein Graft\n\t\nUsing a #15 blade, make a 4 cm long skin incision on the left groin parallel to the inguinal ligament. This exposes the inguinal fat pad.\nCut through the fat pad circumferentially with scissors leaving it attached to its vascular pedicle based on the epigastric vessels.\nUsing micro scissors, free the filmy connective tissue adhesions between the abdominal wall and underlying femoral vessels.\nPlace a retractor on the abdominal wall and pull medially. This exposes the inguinal ligament and the whole length of the femoral vessels.\nUsing micro forceps and curved scissors dissect the epigastric vein and isolate it from its surrounding fat by gently pulling and cutting. This vein acts as a tether when constructing the loop.\nUsing micro forceps and curved micro scissors open the perivascular sheath containing the femoral vessels and nerve all the way from the inguinal ligament to its bifurcation distal to the epigastric branch.\nUsing micro forceps, pick up the femoral vein by its adventitia and gently separate it from the surrounding tissues and accompanying artery. Do this with micro forceps and curved round-pointed micro scissors by pulling the tissue apart and cutting through it.\n\t\tNOTE: Never grab the whole thickness of the vein wall as this might cause trauma to the intima making it prone to thrombosis.\nLigate side branches found during the dissection with 10/0 nylon suture or coagulate them with a bipolar coagulator.",
    "With the femoral vein completely free, ligate its proximal and distal ends with 4/0 silk sutures. Make sure to obtain a vein graft of at least 10 mm length and include approximately 0.5 cm length of the epigastric branch to be used as a guy rope tether to hold the loop open in the chamber.\nUsing micro forceps and straight micro scissors, trim the adventitia from the graft's ends by gently pulling and cutting. This can also be done later, before microsurgical anastomoses.\nFlush the vein graft with heparinized saline solution (10 U/ml of heparin) and leave it to rest in the solution. Close the wound using continuous running 4/0 silk suture plus two or three additional simple interrupted stitches.\nCreation of Arteriovenous Loop and Implantation of Chamber\n\t\nRepeat steps 1.2.1 to 1.2.4 in the exact same way on the contralateral limb.\nUsing micro forceps, dissect and isolate both the epigastric artery and vein form the surrounding fat pad. Do this by gently pulling the tissue away from the vessels\nUsing micro forceps, pick up the femoral artery by its adventitia and free it from the surrounding tissues. Do this with micro forceps and curved round-pointed micro scissors by pulling the tissue apart and cutting through it. Ligate or coagulate its side branches.\nLigate the femoral artery and vein distal to the emergence of the epigastric vessels using 4/0 silk suture.\nPlace a single clamp proximally on each of the femoral artery and vein. Using a sharp straight micro scissor, make a clean transverse cut in each vessel distal to the emergence of the epigastric branches. Place a sterile plastic contrast background under the vessels.\nFlush the vessels vigorously with generous amounts of heparinized saline until all the blood is removed from the lumen.",
    "Bring the vein graft into the operative field and remove any redundant adventitia from the vessels' ends as per step 1.2.10, if needed.\nPerform both microsurgical anastomoses with 10/0 nylon suture. Anastomose the proximal end of the vein graft to the femoral vein and the distal end to the femoral artery. This will allow the blood to flow from the arterial to the venous side without resistance from valves inside the vein graft.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the femoral vessels and the vein graft rest in their natural position without any twists.\nCheck for leaks at both anastomotic sites. Resolve small leaks, which look like non-pulsating blood coming out of the anastomotic site, by placing a small piece of fat on top and gently compressing for 5-10 min. Larger pulsating leaks that rapidly flood the entire field will need additional stitches.\nCheck patency of the arteriovenous loop. Gentle occlusion of the femoral artery should make it shrink while the same in the femoral vein should engorge it.\nPlace the base of the tissue engineering chamber under the arteriovenous loop with the latter resting in its natural position without twists or kinks.\nSecure the base of the chamber to the inguinal ligament and underlying muscle fascia with 6/0 nylon sutures.\nPlace the lid over the base so that the femoral vessels enter the chamber through a notch (window in the side of the chamber). When closing the lid, make sure it catches the epigastric branches, between the chamber base and lid, which act as tethers to hold the arteriovenous loop into position.\nClose the wound using continuous running 4/0 silk suture plus two or three additional simple interrupted stitches.\nAllow the animal to recover from anesthesia on a warming pad.",
    "Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Likewise, do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered. 24 hr later, administer another single dose of Carprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) as analgesic.\nTreat the wound with topical antibiotic ointment for 5 days. If the wound is opened, anesthetize the animal as in step 1.1.2 through 1.1.5 and close the wound as in 1.3.14. Monitor the health of animal daily. Euthanize the animal using a lethal dose of intraperitoneal lethabarb injection (163 mg/kg in 0.25 ml by 23 G needle) if the animal shows more than one moderate signs of inacitivity, poor appetite, weight loss and loss of color.\n2. Flow-through Pedicle Chamber (Two Chambers per Animal)\nPreparation of the Animal for Surgery\n\t\nRepeat steps 1.1.1 through 1.1.4. Two chambers can be implanted into both groin regions of a single rat.\nIsolation of Femoral Vessels and Insertion of the Chamber\n\t\nRepeat steps 1.2.1 through 1.2.8.\nWith both artery and vein completely freed of surrounding tissues and their branches ligated, bring the chamber into the operative field.\nPlace each of the intact femoral vessels on the corresponding slit of the chamber base making sure there are no twists or kinks.\nClose the chamber by attaching the lid to the base. Close the wound using continuous running 4/0 silk suture plus two or three additional simple interrupted stitches and allow the animal to recover as previously described.\n3. Harvest of Chambers and Tissue Processing\nOnce the experiment's time points (4-6 weeks post-implantation) are reached, anesthetize the animal as in step 1.1.2 and repeat steps 1.1.3 through 1.1.5.",
    "Open the wound using a #15 blade and cut through the tissues with scissors until the chamber is completely exposed.\nExpose the femoral vessels proximal to the construct and test for vascular patency: gently occlude the vessel with two microforceps, then milk the blood in a distal direction and finally release the proximal forceps. If the vessel fills with blood again, this confirms patency. Ligate the femoral vessels proximally in the case of the arteriovenous loop and both proximally and distally in the case of the flow-through configuration, and remove the chambers with the containing tissue en bloc.\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize the animal using a lethal dose of intraperitoneal lethobarb injection (163 mg/kg in 0.25 ml by 23 G needle).\nFix tissues in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 24 hr. Divide tissues into multiple transverse sections (1-2 mm thick) and embed in paraffin wax or optimal cutting temperature compound for paraffin sections (5 µm) or frozen sections (10 µm), respectively.3,4,8,17,22,24\nPerform routine histological staining such as hematoxylin and eosin to examine the general morphology of tissues. Perform immunohistochemical staining with specific antibody to identify cell type of interest,3,4,8,17,22,24,29 for example cardiac troponin T immunostaining for cardiomyocytes.\nSubscription Required.
