    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSeparation of Mature Adipocytes and Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) from Human Mammary Adipose Tissue\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this step, breast tissue is digested mechanically and enzymatically to separate mature adipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF).\nCarefully decant the adipose tissue into a sterile Petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Breast Fat Sample before Processing\nNote: It is recommended that you avoid decanting any media in order to reduce the risk of splashes during the performance of the next step.\nUsing a sterile scalpel and forceps, dissociate the tissue mechanically and remove any grossly identified, other undesired tissue types (mainly fibrous tissue highly resistant to the mechanical dissociation) from the adipose sample.\nUse forceps to sterilely drop adipose tissue pieces into a 50 mL tube.\nAdd PBS to a final volume of 50 mL, close the tube and shake vigorously by hand for 30 s.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C.\nDecant the top adipose tissue layer into a new 50 mL tube. Try to avoid letting the media flow through into your adipose fraction.\nNote: It is recommended that you tilt the tube slowly to an approximately 70 degree angle and use a sterile spoon to help pour the tissue into the new tube.\nRepeat steps 4–6 until no red pellet can be seen at the bottom of the tube.\nNote: These washes ensure removal of all possible red blood cell contaminants from the adipose tissue sample, thus improving adipose cell isolation.\nPour the adipose tissue into a new 50 mL tube and add the 1 mg/mL Collagenase 1A enzyme solution in a proportion 1:1 by volume.\nSeal the tube with Parafilm and place on a vertical tube rotator located inside a 37°C CO2 incubator.",
    "Incubate at 37°C for 45 min.\nCritical: Incubation time may vary depending on adipose tissue sample characteristics. To achieve the highest yield of viable adipocytes, it is recommended that you check for adequate enzymatic digestion after 30 min and stop incubation when 80%–90% of the tissue is digested. Do not exceed 60 min of incubation.\nNote: If Collagenase 1A is supplied by another company, the incubation time may vary.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C.\nAfter centrifugation the tube should have four layers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Image of the Four Layers Expected in the Tube after Enzymatic Digestion of Adipose Tissue and Subsequent Centrifugation\nPortion of undigested adipose tissue is indicated on the left of the image.\nClear yellow layer – Lipid released from dead adipocytes.\nOpaque white-yellow layer – mature adipocytes.\nClear brownish liquid – Enzyme solution.\nRed pellet – Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF).\nNote: It is normal to see a portion of undigested adipose tissue between the Adipocyte and Enzyme Solution fractions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The highest yield of viable adipocytes is obtained when the incubation time is enough to disassociate the majority of the adipose tissue without inducing too much damage to the adipocyte population. Adipocyte damage is evidenced by the volume of the clear yellow layer.\nDiscard clear yellow layer using a P1000 pipette.\nNote: You might want to cryopreserve it at −80°C for future assays of steroid hormone or lipid content.\nCarefully decant the opaque layer into a new 50 mL tube, avoiding any flow through of media (go to step 16: Isolation of mature human adipocytes).",
    "Note: If more than one tube was used for the enzymatic digestion of a single breast tissue sample, they should now be combined, allowing a total of 20 mL volume of live adipocytes in each new 50 mL tube.\nPut the tube containing the SVF, including the enzyme solution, at 4°C during the 1–2 h needed for the isolation of mature human adipocytes (go to step 24: Isolation of hASC).\nIsolation of Mature Human Adipocytes\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn this step, mature adipocytes must be filtered and washed for proper isolation.\nPlace a 200 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube (use the same number of tubes as obtained from step 14).\nDilute the live adipocytes in PBS to bring the final volume to 40 mL.\nGently invert the tube to mix and immediately pipette the suspended adipocytes onto the 200 μm cell strainer.\nCritical: Adipocytes are very fragile, so it is recommended that you use a 25 mL pipette and allow the adipocytes to go through the cell strainer by gravity.\nRepeat step 18 until all of the adipocyte suspension has been filtered.\nNote: If the cell strainer becomes blocked, add 3 mL of fresh PBS on the top and resuspend by gently pipetting. Alternately, replace the filter to complete sample filtration.\nCentrifuge filtered adipocytes for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C.\nAfter centrifugation, the tube should have three layers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image of the Three Layers Expected in the Tube after Adipocyte Filtration and Subsequent Centrifugation\nClear yellow layer – Lipid released from dead adipocytes.\nOpaque white-yellow layer – mature adipocytes.\nClear liquid – PBS.",
    "Critical: It is normal to see a small pellet in the tube from cell debris. If, however, this pellet is red you should decant the opaque white-yellow layer into a new 50 mL tube as described in step 14, and wash again with PBS (by adding PBS to the 50 mL tube containing the mature adipocytes, to a final volume of 40 mL (as in step 17), and centrifuging for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C, as indicated in step 20). This step is included to reduce the risk of hASC contamination during mature adipocyte isolation. After this additional wash, you should observe the three layers detailed in step 21.\nDiscard (or remove and cryopreserve) the clear yellow lipid layer using a P1000 pipette.\nCarefully place the tip of an 18G needle attached to a 20 mL syringe down into the bottom of the tube and gently aspirate the clear PBS at the bottom of the tube from underneath the floating adipocytes, trying to avoid aspirating any of the floating adipocytes (go to step 36: Breast cancer cell:mature adipocyte co-culture). The remaining middle layer contains your adipocytes.\nNote: Adipocytes must be used immediately after isolation.\nIsolation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs)\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nIn this step, the SVF is filtered and washed; and hASC selected by adherent cell culture.\nAspirate media from tubes saved previously containing the SVF (step 15).\nAdd 40 mL of PBS and resuspend the pellet.\nNote: If more than one tube was used for the enzymatic digestion of a single breast tissue sample, pellets should be collected together in a same tube and then brought to a total volume of 40 mL in PBS (e.g., for four tubes add 10 mL PBS to each tube, resuspend pellets and combine).",
    "Place a 70 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the filtered SVF for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nCritical: The SVF pellet can easily slip from the tube, so take special care not to lose it in this step.\nPause Point: At this point, SVF can be stored in liquid nitrogen at 106 cells per mL of FBS containing 7% of DMSO, used as freeze media.\nResuspend pellet in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nFor culture, seed cells at a concentration of 300,000 cells/cm2.\nCritical: SVF contains different cell populations, so you should only count the big cells to estimate numbers for plating (hASC are at least 2- to 3-fold bigger than contaminating blood cells).\nMaintain in culture for 2–3 passages, replacing the media every 2 days, to eliminate erythrocytes, white blood cells, and other contaminating SVF cells and obtain a pure hASC primary culture (go to step 46: Breast cancer cell:hASC co-culture).\nNote: The identity of your recovered hASC must be phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry and functionally characterized by their ability to differentiate into Osteocytes, Chondrocytes and Adipocytes as in Marchal et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nPause Point: At this point, hASC can be stored in liquid nitrogen at 106 cells/mL of FBS containing 7% of DMSO, used as freeze media.\nDifferentiation of Immature Adipocytes from hASCs\nTiming: 3 weeks\nIn this step, immature adipocytes are differentiated from isolated hASC using commercially available Adipogenic medium (Lonza #PT-3004).\nCulture hASC until cells reach 100% confluence.\nNote: It is recommended to use P100 dishes for these cultures.\nInduce adipogenesis by three cycles of induction/maintenance as follows.\n3 days of culture with supplemented adipogenesis induction medium.",
    "1–3 days of culture in supplemented adipogenic maintenance media\nAfter three complete cycles of induction/maintenance, culture the differentiating adipocytes for 7 more days in adipogenic maintenance medium (go to step 42: Breast cancer cell:immature adipocyte co-culture).\nCritical: Adipogenesis is confirmed by visualizing the formation of lipid vacuoles by direct microscopy (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Only cultures with a minimum of 70% immature adipocyte confluency should be used for co-culture studies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Optic Microscopy Image of an Immature Adipocyte Culture\nWhite arrows in the amplified section of the picture indicate different size of lipid vacuoles formed. Scale bars, 200 μm (left); 50 μm (right, for the enlarged image).\nNote: If another commercially available Adipogenic medium is used for differentiation of immature adipocytes from hASC, this protocol should be replaced by the manufacturer′s protocol.\nBreast Cancer Cell:Mature Adipocyte Co-culture\nTiming: 7 days\nMethodology for breast cancer cell:mature adipocyte co-culture, and subsequent cell population isolation.\nThe day before the planned recovery of mature adipocytes from a fresh human breast fat sample, seed a non-confluent asynchronous culture of the chosen breast cancer cell line onto a 6-well plate, using the appropriate culture media.\nNote: For MCF7, seed 50,000 cells/well in IMEM + 5% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin and for MDA-MB-231 lines, seed 50,000 cells/well in DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For other cell lines, estimate the appropriate number of cells to be seeded, taking into consideration that cells will not be passaged during the duration of the co-culture experiment.\nResuspend the mature human mammary adipocytes obtained after the isolation protocol (step 23) in the culture media appropriate for the breast cancer cell line that will be used for the co-culture experiment, using 5 mL of media/mL final volume of isolated adipocytes.\nRemove and discard the culture media from breast cancer cell cultures.",
    "Gently invert the tube containing mature adipocytes to mix, and immediately pipette 2 mL of resuspended adipocytes into each well.\nNote: For each well to be seeded, step 39 should be repeated in order to use same number of adipocytes in each well, since adipocytes float in the culture media.\nAdd 500 μL of fresh culture media to each well every 2 days.\nCritical: Complete change of media is not recommended during these co-culture assays, since the mature adipocytes are suspended in the culture media above the adherent breast cancer cells and removal of the media would lead to adipocyte loss.\nAt day 7, breast cancer cells and mature adipocytes can be separated easily due to their different attachment to the cell culture surface (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Optic Microscopy Image of a Breast Cancer Cell: Mature Adipocyte Co-culture\nLeft picture focuses on the MCF7 cells and right picture on mature adipocytes in the co-culture. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nMature adipocytes float in the culture and can be collected by recovering the media using a P1000 pipette.\nNote: Mature adipocytes can be collected for further studies by centrifugating the tube (containing the media and adipocytes recovered from the co-culture) for 5 min at 400 × g at 22°C–28°C, and aspirating the media.\nBreast cancer cells are attached to the cell culture surface and can be isolated by washing off floating adipocytes.\nCritical: Adipocytes can stick to plastic surfaces. It is recommended to perform at least 3–4 washes with PBS to avoid contamination of breast cancer cells with remaining adipocytes in the culture.\nBreast Cancer Cell:Immature Adipocyte Co-culture\nTiming: 7 days\nMethodology for breast cancer cell:immature adipocyte co-culture, and subsequent cell population isolation.\nRemove the culture media from immature adherent cultures of adipocyte cultures obtained (step 35).",
    "Seed breast cancer cells on top of immature adipocytes and add the culture medium appropriate to the breast cancer line.\nNote: For MCF7 cells seed 400,000 cells/P100 dish use 7 mL of IMEM + 5% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin and for MDA-MB-231 cells, seed same cell amount but use 7 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nNote: It is highly recommended to use fluorescent-tagged breast cancer cells to facilitate their isolation after co-culture (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fluorescent Microscopy Image of a Breast Cancer Cell: Immature Adipocyte Co-culture\nIn the image can be seen green MCF7 cells and lipid vacuoles of immature adipocytes. White arrows in the amplified section of the picture indicate lipid vacuoles of non-GFP-tagged immature adipocytes. Scale bars, 200 μm (left); 50 μm (right, for the enlarged image).\nChange culture media every 2 days.\nNote: Since both cell populations grow attached, complete change of media is possible during co-culture.\nAt day 7, breast cancer cells and immature adipocytes can be trypsinized, recovered, washed, and separated from each other by FACS, using either anti-cytokeratin as a marker for epithelial cells or fluorescence if the cancer line is GFP-tagged.\nNote: We highly recommend the use of fluorescent-tagged breast cancer cells to facilitate their isolation after co-culture. While anti-cytokeratin could serve as a substitute marker, using anti-cytokeratin for FACS will reduce significantly the purity of the populations sorted.\nBreast Cancer Cell:hASC Co-culture\nTiming: 7 days\nMethodology for breast cancer cell:hASC co-culture, and subsequent cell population isolation.\nDiscard culture media from hASC cultures obtained (step 32).\nSeed breast cancer cells on top of hASC using the culture media appropriate for the breast cancer line.",
    "Note: For MCF7 cells seed 800,000 cells/P150 dish using 18 mL of IMEM + 5% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin and for MDA-MB-231 seed 800,000 cells/P150 dish using 18 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nNote: It is highly recommended to use fluorescent-tagged breast cancer cells to facilitate their isolation from hASC after co-culture (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/320-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Optic (Left) and Fluorescent (Right) Microscopy Images of a Breast Cancer Cell: hASC Co-culture\nGreen cells on the right correspond to MDA-MB-231 cells in the co-culture. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nChange culture media every 2 days.\nNote: Since both cell populations grow as adherent cultures, complete change of media is possible during co-culture.\nAt day 7, breast cancer cells and hASC can be trypsinized, recovered, washed, and separated from each other by FACS, using either anti-cytokeratin as a marker for epithelial cells or fluorescence if the cancer line is GFP-tagged.\nNote: We highly recommend the use of fluorescent-tagged breast cancer cells to facilitate their isolation after co-culture.
