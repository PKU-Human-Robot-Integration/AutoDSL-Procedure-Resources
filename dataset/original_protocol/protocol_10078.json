    "For this protocol, equine stifle cartilage was obtained from horses that had died from other causes than osteoarthritis. Tissue was obtained with permission of the owners, in line with the institutional ethical regulations.\nNOTE: This protocol describes the fabrication of scaffolds from decellularized equine cartilage, which can be used for applications such as in vitro tissue culture platforms or for in vivo implantation in regenerative medicine strategies. The enzymatic treatment steps must be performed in the described chronological order.\n1. Harvesting of Articular Cartilage from Donor (Cadaveric) Joints\nAhead of the harvesting step, prepare 1 L of cartilage washing solution, consisting of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 1% (v/v) Amphotericin B.\nWear gloves and a lab coat during the entire harvesting procedure, since the donor can carry pathogens.\nObtain an intact (cadaveric) joint for cartilage isolation.\nNOTE: At this point, the skin around the joint is still intact. Equine stifle cartilage obtained from horse was used in this protocol, but other joints from other species can also be used.\nRemove the skin that is located around the joint area of interest by using a scalpel and a surgical tweezer. In addition, remove excessive fat and muscle tissue if necessary, without damaging the underlying joint. Optionally, transfer the prepared cadaver to a biological safety cabinet.\nTo perform an arthrotomy, i.e., a separation of the joint, first define the location where the joint articulates by performing extension and flexion of the joint.\nCarefully remove more layers of fat, muscles, and tendons with a scalpel and surgical tweezer to open up the joint area.\nMake an incision to reach the joint cavity.\nNOTE: The joint cavity is filled with synovial fluid, which can drip from the cavity when performing a correct incision.",
    "Continue to open up the joint completely by cutting through the tendons that keep the joint together.\nInspect the cartilage for any macroscopic damage.\nNOTE: If the articular cartilage does not have a glossy and smooth appearance or if evident blistering, clefts, or defects are present, discard the cartilage.\nUse a sterile scalpel to remove the cartilage from the subchondral bone. Cut all the way down to the subchondral bone to also remove the deep zone of the cartilage (Figure 1). To prevent the cartilage from drying out, regularly drip cartilage washing solution on the cartilage.\nNOTE: At this time, the size of the cartilage slices does not matter.\nCollect the cartilage slices in 50 mL tubes containing previously prepared cartilage washing solution (Figure 2A).\nAfter collecting the cartilage from all the areas of interest, snap freeze the cartilage slices in liquid nitrogen for 5 min.\nTransfer the cartilage slices into 50 mL tubes and immediately lyophilize the cartilage slices for 24 h in a freeze dryer. Set the freeze dryer at approximately 0.090 mbar while the ice condenser is -51 °C (Figure 2B).\nStore the cartilage slices in a dry place at room temperature until further use.\nNOTE: Up to the point of scaffold formation, the solutions and cartilage do not have to be prepared and treated in a sterile way.\n2. Creating Decellularized Cartilage Particles\nSubmerse the lyophilized cartilage slices in liquid nitrogen.\nDirectly grind the samples either manually or by a milling machine. When grinding the cartilage slices by hand, use a mortar and pestle and grind the slices for approximately 45 min until they are pulverized (Figure 2C and 2D). When grinding automatically, use a milling machine at its pre-set speed for a few seconds up to a minute, until the snap-frozen cartilage slices are pulverized.",
    "NOTE: Pre-cool the mortar or the grinding compartment of the milling machine by adding liquid nitrogen. When using a milling machine, make sure that all particles are ground, and that no particles stay in the bottom of the grinding compartment.\nSieve the cartilage particles to get rid of larger parts by using a sieve with a 0.71 mm mesh size.\nStore the particles in a dry place at room temperature.\n3. Enzymatic Decellularization with Trypsin 0.25%-EDTA\nPrepare the digestion solution, consisting of 0.25% trypsin with EDTA supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 1% (v/v) Amphotericin B. Store the solution at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Trypin is a protease that degrades proteins residing in the cartilage tissue. This enzymatic step will open up the dense cartilage structure.\nFill the 50 mL tubes with the pulverized cartilage particles up to a volume of approximately 7.5 mL per tube.\nIncubate the cartilage particles with the prepared digestion solution at 37 °C for 24 h in total, while refreshing the digestion solution every 4 h.\nFirst, add 30 mL of the digestion solution to each 50 mL tube that contains cartilage particles.\nThen, resuspend the particles by using a vortex or pipet so that all particles are exposed to the enzymatic solution.\nIncubate the samples for 4 h at 37 °C on a roller.\nTo refresh the digestion solution, centrifuge the tubes for 20 min at 3113 x g to cause sedimentation of the cartilage particles. Discard the supernatant.\nNOTE: The supernatant will become clearer with every trypsin incubation period.\nRepeat step 3.3.1–3.3.4 until the particles have been incubated with the digestion solution for 6 cycles of 4 h.",
    "After the final cycle, remove the supernatant after centrifuging and wash the particles in 30 mL of cartilage washing solution twice. Centrifuge the particles for 20 min at 3113 x g between each of the washes.\n4. Enzymatic Decellularization with Nuclease Treatment\nPrepare a 10 mM Tris-HCl solution at pH 7.5 in deionized water.\nAdd 50 U/mL deoxyribonuclease and 1 U/mL ribonuclease A to the Tris-HCl buffer, to obtain the nuclease solution.\nNOTE: This step is performed to specifically degrade deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases.\nTo remove the cartilage washing solution from the cartilage particles (step 3.4), centrifuge for 20 min at 3,113 x g, and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 30 mL of the nuclease solution to the cartilage particles and stir the particles through the solution, making sure that all particles are exposed to the nuclease solution.\nIncubate the samples on a roller for 4 h at 37 °C.\nRemove the nuclease solution by centrifuging the cartilage particles for 20 min at 3,113 x g and discard the supernatant.\nWash the samples by adding 30 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl solution without the deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease A to the cartilage particles. Resuspend the particles and leave the samples on a roller for 20 h at room temperature.\n5. Detergent Decellularization\nMake the detergent solution by dissolving 1% (v/v) octoxynol-1 in PBS.\nRemove the Tris-HCl solution from the cartilage particles by centrifuging for 20 min at 3,113 x g and discarding the supernatant.\nAdd 30 mL of the prepared 1% detergent solution to the cartilage particles. Resuspend the cartilage particles gently to avoid foaming of the solution.\nNOTE: This step breaks down cellular membranes.\nIncubate the samples on a roller for 24 h at room temperature on a roller.",
    "Remove the detergent solution by centrifugation for 20 min at 3,113 x g and discard the supernatant.\nTo remove all of the remnants of the decellularization solutions, wash the cartilage particles in 6 cycles of 8 h in 30 mL of cartilage washing solution. Perform washing on a roller at room temperature.\nTo change to the next wash, centrifuge the suspension for 20 min at 3,113 x g, discard the supernatant and add fresh cartilage washing solution.\nLeave the last wash in the tubes and store the decellularized cartilage particles at -80 °C.\n6. Creating Scaffolds from the Decellularized Particles\nIf the particles have been stored at -80 °C, thaw the closed tubes that contain the cartilage particles in warm water before creating the scaffolds.\nTransfer the cartilage particles with a small ladle to a cylindrical mold, for example, a plastic vial with a diameter of 8 mm and a height of 2 cm.\nWhen placing the cartilage particles into the plastic mold, press all the air-bubbles out to avoid cavities in the scaffold, and fill the mold until the edge.\nNOTE: It will be more difficult to take the scaffolds out of a metal mold after scaffold formation, which can lead to cracks in the scaffold.\nFreeze the molds with cartilage particles for 10 min at -20 °C.\nLyophilize the cartilage scaffolds within their molds for 24 h in a freeze dryer.\nAfter lyophilization, take the scaffold out of the mold (Figure 3) and cross-link them with ultraviolet (UV) light at 30 cm distance and 365 nm overnight.\nIn order to use the scaffolds for in vitro cell culture or in vivo implantation, sterilize the scaffolds with, for example, ethylene oxide (EtO) gas.\nNOTE: EtO sterilization is performed by an external party.",
    "7. Characterization of the Decellularized Scaffolds with Histological Stainings\nNOTE: To ensure complete decellularization and to visualize the remaining natural character of the cartilage, perform several histological stainings before using the scaffolds in any experiment, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to ensure decellularization, Safranin-O staining to visualize residual GAG presence, collagen type I immunohistochemistry to differentiate between collagen content, and collagen type II immunohistochemistry to differentiate between collagen content.\nCut the scaffolds in thin slices of approximately 3 mm with a scalpel.\nNOTE: If the scaffolds are cut in larger or smaller sizes, the durations of the dehydration cycles need to be adapted.\nEmbed the scaffolds in a drop of 4% (w/v) alginate and induce cross-linking by adding a similar volume of 3.7% non-buffered formalin that contains 20 mM CaCl2.\nNOTE: Alginate embedding makes the scaffold slices more rigid compared to the washing steps prior to paraffin embedding. In case the scaffolds have been cell-seeded or in vivo implanted, alginate embedding is not necessary, as the composition of the scaffolds will be resistant enough due to ECM incorporation by the cells.\nDehydrate the samples by placing them in a graded ethanol series, starting with one-hour cycles of 70%, 96%, 96%, 100%, and 100% ethanol, followed by two 1 h cycles of xylene, and ending with two 1 h cycles of paraffin at 60 °C.\nAfter dehydration, paraffin-embed the samples in a mold and cool the samples down.\nCut the samples with a microtome in slices of 5 μm thick.\nBefore staining, rehydrate the samples by placing them in a returned graded ethanol series. Start with two washes of xylene for 5 min, followed by 2 washes of 100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol for 3 min per wash. Finally, wash the samples 3 times in water for 2 min.",
    "NOTE: In case of using alginate to process samples for paraffin embedding, make sure to wash off the alginate with 10 mM citric acid prior to rehydration of the paraffin sections.\nStain the samples with hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin-O, collagen I, and collagen II as previous described11.\n8. Characterization of the Decellularized Scaffolds with Quantitative Analyses\nObtain papain digests of the scaffolds as described previously11.\nPerform an assay with a fluorescence-based DNA quantification kit to measure the double-strand DNA content of the scaffolds to ensure complete decellularization. Follow the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Express the amount of DNA per dry weight of the scaffold.\nPerform a dimethylmethylene blue assay to quantify the remainder of the GAGs within the scaffold, as described previously11. Express the amount in GAG per DNA.\n9. Seeding of the Decellularized Scaffolds\nCut sterilized scaffolds from step 6.7 into 3 mm thick slices.\nTransfer the scaffolds in separate wells of a 6-well plate.\nRehydrate scaffolds with cell culture medium by pipetting 1 mL of medium on top of the scaffold and let it soak for 30 min. Use either chondrocyte or mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) expansion medium.\n\tNote: Use the same medium for scaffold rehydration as for cell culture of the cells that will be seeded. Chondrocyte expansion medium consists of Dulbecco's modified media (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). MSC expansion medium consists of minimum essential medium alpha (a-MEM) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL FGF-2.\nPrepare 3 x 106 cells in 100 μL of medium, which is the required volume for each scaffold with a diameter of 8 mm and a height of 3 mm.",
    "NOTE: Multiple cell types from different species can be used for seeding. When using chondrocytes or mesenchymal stromal cells, isolate the cells as previously described11. When using chondrocytes, make sure that they have not been expanded past the P1 passage in order to minimize the number of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. When using mesenchymal stromal cells, they must be tested on their ability for multi-lineage differentiation, as previously described14.\nPipet 50 μL of prepared cell suspension on top of the pre-soaked scaffold and incubate the scaffold for 1 h at 37 °C.\nCarefully turn the scaffold upside down, pipet the remaining 50 μL of cell suspension on this side of the scaffold and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nAfter incubation, add 3 mL of medium to the wells, and culture the cell-seeded scaffolds at 37 °C. Handle the culture plate gently to avoid detachment of the cells.\nCulture the scaffolds for the period of time that is required for the experiment and change the medium 2–3 times a week. Pipet slowly and as far away from the scaffold as possible.\nAfter culturing of the cell-seeded scaffold, cut the scaffolds in half and process them for both histology and biochemical analyses.\nSubscription Required.
