Add AP-detecting solution promptly to all wells to start the enzymatic conversion as simultaneously as possible. Therefore, use a multi-channel pipette.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature until the solution in the wells with the highest ligand concentration turn yellow.\n\tNOTE: The incubation time may vary between 5 min and 1 h depending on the signal intensity.\nStop conversion of the phosphatase substrate by adding 50 µL/well of 1.5 M NaOH solution. Leave the plate standing for several minutes to ensure streak-free mixing of both solutions. To warrant the same incubation period in all wells, use a multi-channel pipette and add the 1.5 M NaOH in the same order added to the wells as that of the AP-detecting substrate in step 11.8.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) at 405 nm of each well by an ELISA reader.\n12. Evaluation of the Titration Signals",
    "Open the table of raw data, the OD405nm values, with Excel. As these signal values of the titration curves are read in rows, transpose the values to a column and label with the concentrations of added ligand in another column.\nOpen the Graphpad Prism 5 (Version 5.0). Open a new project file in the main menu. Choose the XY format under New data & graph. Choose the option Enter and plot a single point for each value for the Y-axis.\nCopy the two columns, concentration of added ligand and signal values (OD405nm values) from the excel file and paste them into the data sheet of GraphPad Prism as X and Y values, respectively.\nOpen the Analysis sub-program of GraphPad Prism 5 and choose the option Non-linear regression under XY-analysis. Choose user-defined equation and press the New button to create a new equation.\nType the titration curve equation in the form: Y =(Smax-Smin)*((X+R+K)-sqrt((X+R+K)^2-4*R*X))/(2*R)+Smin + B*X into the newly opened template sheet, with Y being the signal value S, X being the concentration of added ligand L, R being the concentration of immobilized receptor, K being the dissociation constant, and B being the background slope. Define the appropriate constraints, such as K >0 and R >0.\n\tNOTE: This equation is the same equation of equation 9 in a different form.\nAnalyze the values of the data sheet by choosing the user-defined equation, which was newly created. Open the table with the calculated approximation values (K, Rt, Smax, Smin, and B) which are shown under the Result section on the left side of the software screen.\n\tNOTE: The software determines the 5 parameters by iterative fitting of the non-linear regression only if the titration curve consists of at least 5 data points.",
    "Evaluate the parameters K, Rt, Smax, Smin, and B for every group of titration curves statistically, and correlate the parameters with the specific feature of the group (mutated or chemically-modified ligand or receptor).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
