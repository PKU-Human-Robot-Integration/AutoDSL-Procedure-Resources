    "Plant GrowthPlant sweet basil seeds in square pots filled with Sunshine Mix 4 and allow it to grow for 3 weeks in a plant growth chamber at 25 °C with a photoperiod of 12 h.Plants used for transformation are at two-true leaf stage.The first two true leaves, with a length usually ranging from 1.5-2.0 cm, are used to excise explants for stable transformation.Agrobacterium preparationNote: Perform under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood. Three days prior to transformation, streak Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 carrying the desired plasmid, which is stored at -80 °C, on a LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics. We used the plasmids derived from pKSE401 vector (Xing et al., 2014) for targeted mutagenesis of sweet basil ObDMR1 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Navet and Tian, 2020). The LB agar plates in our experiments are supplemented with 15 μg/ml rifampicin (for selection of A. tumefaciens EHA105) and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for selection of the plasmid). Incubate the plate at 28 °C for two days.Note: This plate can be stored at 4 °C and used within one week. The day before transformation, scoop bacteria from the above plate using the bottom of a sterile 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and spread on a new LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics (containing kanamycin and rifampicin in our study). Incubate the plate overnight at 28 °C.On the day of transformation, scrape a portion of bacterial cells with a sterile 1 ml pipette tip and resuspend in 1 ml Agrobacterium Inoculation media (IN) by pipetting the solution up and down until a homogeneous suspension is observed. Transfer the suspension to a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml IN media, and mix well.Note: Cover this tube with aluminium foil to avoid light as IN media contains light-sensitive acetosyringone.",
    "Measure the OD600 of the above bacterial suspension using a spectrophotometer with IN media as blank, and adjust the final OD600 to ~0.6, a concentration used for inoculating explants. Approximately 20 ml of Agrobacterium suspension is needed for 100-150 explants. Incubate the suspension in a sterile 50 ml conical tube at room temperature (RT) on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm for 2 h in dark.Note: Loosen the lid of the 50 ml conical tube to allow aeration and then cover the tube with aluminium foil. Preparation of explantsNote: Perform Steps C2, C3 and C4 in sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood. Prepare the explants while the incubation of Agrobacterium suspension is taking place. From three-week-old sweet basil plants pluck the first pair of true leaves, and surface sterilize the leaves for 5 min by immersing them in 12% (v/v) Clorox Regular Bleach Disinfectant solution in a 500 ml media bottle. This step should be done gently to avoid leaf damage. For each transformation, we usually handle ~100 leaves.Immediately after surface sterilization, wash the leaves in sterile MilliQ water for 3 min by gently inverting the bottle several times. Repeat this washing step three more times. A total of four washes are required to remove any trace of bleach sticking to the leaves.Transfer the leaves onto a sterile paper towel. Excise two round leaf discs from each leaf from regions close to leaf base along the midrib using a sterile #2 cork borer, as shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g001.jpgFigure 1. Excision of two explants (leaf discs of 6.25 mm diameter) from a surface-sterilized true sweet basil leaf After excising the explants from each leaf, immediately place them in a sterile Petri dish filled with sterile MilliQ water as shown in Figure 2.",
    "This keeps the leaf discs fresh until explants are extracted from all leaves.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g002.jpgFigure 2. Explants (leaf-discs) floating in sterile MillQ water Inoculation of explants with Agrobacterium and their co-cultivationNote: Perform under sterile conditions. After the completion of Agrobacterium incubation and explants preparation, immerse all the explants in the Agrobacterium suspension for 30 min (Approximately 20 ml of Agrobacterium suspension is needed for 100-150 explants), as shown in Figure 3. Keep the tube away from light by covering it with aluminium foil. Gently invert the tube 3-4 times every 10 min to ensure that all explants get submerged in the suspension.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g003.jpgFigure 3. Diagrammatic representation showing leaf discs immersed in Agrobacterium suspension Blot dry the leaf discs by gently pressing them between two layers of sterile paper towel to remove excess suspension.Co-cultivation: Transfer the Agrobacterium-inoculated explants using sterile forceps onto callus and shoot induction (SI) media plates supplemented with 200 µl AS with abaxial side touching the media (20 explants per Petri dish) (Figure 4A). Seal the plates with MicroporeTM surgical tape and wrap with aluminium foil. Incubate the plates for three days in plant tissue culture room at 25 °C under dark conditions.Regeneration of transgenic plantsTransfer the Agrobacterium-infected explants to SI media plates supplemented with 200 μg/ml timentin (to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105) and 30 μg/ml kanamycin for induction and selection of transgenic calli. Seal the plates with MicroporeTM surgical tape tape, wrap with aluminium foil and incubate the plates at 25 °C under dark conditions for 4-6 weeks with regular sub-culturing onto fresh media every two weeks.",
    "During this process, we observe several key regeneration stages, including: swelling-up of leaf discs in irregular fashion within 1 week (Figure 4B), callus formation in another 1-2 weeks (Figure 4C), followed by the sprouting of tiny shoots usually as pale/yellow-colored (since plates are incubated under dark conditions) (Figure 4D) and occasionally green-colored (Figure 4E). A regular check on plates every week is recommended to observe callus/shoot formation. Do not allow the calli/shoots to turn dark (brown/black) and sub-culture onto fresh media if and when required. While sub-culturing clean the calli/shoots by removing any dead/decaying (brown/black) tissues and then place on fresh media.Note: Shoots may emerge inside the media as well, so flip the side when performing fresh sub-culturing to allow proper aeration. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Swelling-up of leaf-discs after 1 week on SI media supplemented with timentin and kanamycin. C. Callus formation after 2 weeks. D. Pale/yellow-colored shoots emerging from growing calli. E. Green-colored shoots.Once the shoots develop on calli, cut individual shoots (length approximately 0.5 cm and above) with a sterile scalpel and transfer to plant culture containers containing root induction (RI) media supplemented with 200 μg/ml timentin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin (Figure 5A). Seal the containers with MicroporeTM surgical tape, cover with aluminium foil and incubate the containers for 1 week in dark at 25 °C.Note: Do not overcrowd the container with young shoots; allow half-centimeter spacing while placing the shoots. After 1 week, remove the foil and incubate the containers under light with a 12-hour photoperiod at 25 °C for 4-8 weeks with regular sub-culturing every two weeks onto fresh RI media supplemented with timentin and kanamycin.",
    "During sub-culturing to fresh media, make sure to remove any dead or decaying tissue, and only transfer the well-differentiated green shoot stalks (Figure 5B). Transfer each well-differentiated shoot stalk separately into a tissue culture container to allow root establishment and full development of the transgenic plant (Figures 5C-5D). It usually takes 2-3 weeks after providing light conditions for a shoot stalk to develop into a transgenic plant with robust roots. At this stage (Figures 5C-5D), leaf tissue can be excised from the plants growing in the container to test for transgene integration by PCR.Notes: Keep a close observation on containers and perform sub-culturing when required; Discard shoots that do not show signs of root formation within one month. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g005.jpgFigure 5.

Plantlet with well-established shoot (C) and root (D) system.AcclimatizationRemove the transgenic plants with well-developed shoot & root system from media container and thoroughly wash the roots with sterile MilliQ water to remove residue media.Plant them in moistened soil mix (Figure 6A) and grow under 100% relative humidity for 3-4 days in a tray covered with a plastic dome in a growth chamber set at 25 °C with a 12-hour photoperiod.Adapt the plants to ex vitro conditions by gradually reducing the humidity over the next 2-3 days through partial opening of the plastic dome, and finally removing the plastic dome.Once the plant attains a certain height (12.0-15.0 cm), repot the plants in larger pots and transfer them to a greenhouse at 25-30 °C under natural light to propagate seeds (Figure 6B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g006.jpgFigure 6.",
