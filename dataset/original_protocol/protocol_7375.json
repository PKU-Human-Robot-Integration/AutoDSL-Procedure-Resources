    "Part I: Culturing parasitoid wasps (Figure 1)  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4582/bioprotoc-13-01-4582-g001.jpg Figure 1. Flow chart summarizing the culturing of parasitoid wasps in laboratory conditions   Preparation of the host vials  In the laboratory, culture wildtype  Drosophila  (strain Canton S) in plastic fly bottles containing standard cornmeal molasses yeast medium (see Recipes) and maintain in 12:12 h light/dark cycle–controlled incubators at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity, unless otherwise specified.To avoid overcrowding and stock maintenance, transfer the parental flies (P0, approximately 25 females and 10 males) into fresh fly bottles after four days of egg laying.At 25 °C, adult  Drosophila  progeny (F1) begins to eclose from pupal cases in the culture bottles in 9–10 days.Anesthetize a bottle of F1 adult fruit flies (preferably 3–10-days-old) with CO2  and place the flies on a fly pad.Using a microscope and a paintbrush, transfer anesthetized F1 adults—15 females and 8 males—into a vial containing fresh fly food (referred to as the  host vial  ) and allow the flies to lay eggs for three days at 25 °C (Figure 2C–left).After three days, either discard F1 adults from the host vials into a fly morgue or transfer F1 adults to a fresh food vial for preparing a new host vial. Culturing larval parasitoid wasp  Following three days of fruit fly egg laying and removal of F1 adults from the host vials, place 3–4 drops of honey diluted 1:1 in distilled water on the inner side of the host vial plugs, to serve as a food source for the adult wasps.Using CO2, anesthetize 5–10-days-old adult larval parasitoid wasps—Leptopilina boulardi  (Lb17) or  Leptopilina heterotoma  (Lh14)—and sort male and female parasitoids (Figure 2A and 2B). Identifying male and female  Leptopilina  is relatively easy: male parasitoids have longer antennas and smaller bodies than females.",
    "Additionally, on the posterior ventral side of the abdomen, female wasps have a specialized needle-like structure, an ovipositor, that they insert into the host to deposit the eggs.Gently transfer the adult parasitoids (12 females and 8 males) into the host vial containing the developing  Drosophila  larvae.Place the honey-supplemented plugs and leave the host vials (referred to as the  infected vial  ) on their side until the parasitoids recover from CO2  exposure (Figure 2C–right). Anesthetized wasps could otherwise fall into wet/damp food in an upright vial and, subsequently, be unable to extricate themselves upon waking.Maintain the wasp-infected vials in a fly room or an incubator with controlled conditions until the emergence of the adult parasitoids (Figure 2D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4582/bioprotoc-13-01-4582-g002.jpg Figure 2.

Note the adult fruit flies that escaped the parasitoid attack or suppressed the infection (left) and newly emerged wasps in the infected vial (right). Culturing pupal parasitoid wasps  After three days of egg laying, either discard or transfer the adult F1 flies from the host vial to a new food vial. Allow the larval stages to develop in the host vial at 25 °C for approximately 3–4 days.When the third instar larvae initiate pupation (pre-pupae) in the host vials, remove the plugs and add 3–4 drops of honey diluted in distilled water.",
    "Anesthetize 5–10-days-old adult pupal parasitoids [  Trichopria drosophilae  (Trical)] using CO2  and sort male and female parasitoids on a fly pad. Like  Leptopilina  , Trical males also have longer antennas and smaller bodies than females (Figure 3A).Similar to larval parasitoid infection, carefully transfer the Trical wasps (12 females and 8 males) into the host vial containing  Drosophila  pre-pupae and developing larval stages.Cover the freshly infected host vial with honey-supplemented plugs and leave the vials on their side.After parasitoids wake from CO2  exposure, keep the vials vertically and maintain the wasp-infected vials in a fly room or an incubator with controlled conditions (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4582/bioprotoc-13-01-4582-g003.jpg Figure 3. Pupal parasitoid–infected host vial.  Image of (A)  T. drosophilae  female (left) and male (right) pupal parasitoid wasp and (B) the parasitoid-infected vial with early (left) and late (right) stages of development within the fly pupal case. Note the wasps used for infecting the fly pupae (left) and newly emerged ones (right) in the infected vials. Collecting and maintaining parasitoid wasps   Leptopilina  females infect the developing  Drosophila  larval stages, whereas  Trichopria  females attack fruit fly pupae to lay their eggs (Small et al., 2012). Successful parasitoid infections suppress the host’s immune response and delay fruit fly development. Consequently, the parasitoid egg hatches, develops, and molts, and the adult wasp emerges from the  Drosophila  pupal case. Depending on parasitoid species and environmental conditions—temperature and humidity—the adult wasp ecloses 25–30 days post-infection.Alternatively, if the host’s immune response encapsulates the parasitoid egg, it blocks the wasp egg development, and  Drosophila  adults emerge normally (Carton and Nappi, 1997).While parasitoid eggs are developing in the host vial, the fruit flies’ progeny that successfully defended against the parasitoid infection or escaped the wasp attack ecloses before the wasp’s emergence (see Figure 2D). Discard these adult fruit flies into a fly morgue.",
    "To collect and maintain adult parasitoid wasps, prepare a  culture vial  by inserting a folded Kimwipe sheet inside fresh fly food vials to absorb excess moisture and supplement the plugs with diluted honey. Anesthetize the wasps that emerged in the infected vial on a fly pad and gently place them (approximately 50 wasps/vial) in the culture vials (Figure 4).Repeat the above step once every 4–5 days to collect the newly emerged wasps from the infected vials and maintain the culture vials at room temperature. Then, collected wasps are used for experiments (see below) and to start new wasp cultures by infecting the host vial (Figure 2C and 3B).To avoid adult parasitoid wasp death due to deteriorating fly food, gradual dryness of the plugs, or accumulation of moisture in the vials, transfer wasps to fresh culture vials as needed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4582/bioprotoc-13-01-4582-g004.jpg Figure 4.
