    "The protocol was approved, and all the animals were handled according to the institutional guidelines of Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Scientifique (Inserm, France). Magnetic isolation of microglia from the brains of 24 OF1 mouse pups (both male and female) at P8, divided into 6-well, 12-well, or 96-well plates, are presented. The experimental work was performed under a hood to maintain sterile conditions.\n1. Preparation of sterile solutions for isolation and cell culture\nPrepare 50 mL of 1x Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS-/-) from the commercially available 10x solution (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare dissociation mixture according to the composition provided in Table 1 using a commercially available tissue dissociation kit (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 200 mL of 1x HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS+/+) from the commercially available 10x solution.\nPrepare 200 mL of 1x PBS + 0.5% BSA (referred to as cell sorting buffer).\nPrepare CD11b-microbeads according to Table 2.\nPrepare 500 mL of macrophage serum-free culture medium (SFM) + 1% of Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S). Make aliquots of 50 mL tubes and store them at 4 °C. This is referred to as the microglia medium later in the text.\n\tNOTE: All isolation solutions must be freshly prepared under sterile conditions on experimentation day and kept on ice. Microglia cell culture medium can be prepared, aliquoted in 50 mL tubes, and kept at 4 °C for future use. Filtration is not needed.\n2. Brain dissection\nDecapitate the pup's head using large scissors without previous general anesthesia.\nCut the skin from the neck to the nose following the sagittal suture (15-20 mm) with small scissors (Figure 1A-C).\nInsert a small scissor's tips within the Foramen magnum parallel to the skull. Cut from each side carefully to the eyes (Figure 1D,E).",
    "Cut between the eyes with small scissors to detach the skull and brain from the head (Figure 1F).\nWith two forceps, grab the skull close to the olfactory bulbs and tear the skull carefully, taking care not to damage the underlying brain (Figure 1G-I).\nRemove cerebellum and olfactive bulb with a razor blade and cut the brain into two pieces (Figure 1J).\nPlace the brain pieces in a Petri dish containing 30-40 mL of HBSS-/- (Figure 1K).\n3. Brain dissociation and magnetic microglial isolation\nNOTE: All cell manipulations and resuspensions must be performed with a 1,000 µL pipette with great caution. Applying a high mechanical action may activate or kill microglia cells.\nTransfer 12 brain pieces (~1.2 g) per dissociation tube containing dissociation mixture according to Table 1. For 24 pups, four C-Tubes were needed (Figure 2A-B).\nPlace C-Tubes on the dissociator (with the heating mode). Start the optimized NTDK program in the equipment according to the manufacturer's instruction (Figure 2D).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 20 s (at 4 °C) to collect all the cells. Complete the mechanical dissociation by pipetting three times up and down with a 1,000 µL pipette (Figure 2E).\nTransfer the cells to four 15 mL tubes + strainers. Rinse the strainers with 10 mL of HBSS+/+ (Figure 2F).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of HBSS+/+ (Figure 2G).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet with 6 mL of sorting buffer (step 1.4) (Figure 2H).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Add 200 µL of CD11b-microbead solution (step 1.5) per tube and resuspend carefully (Figure 2I).",
    "Incubate the tubes for 15-20 min at 4 °C. Carefully resuspend the pellet with 6 mL of sorting buffer (Figure 2I-J).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet with 8 mL of sorting buffer (Figure 2K).\nFollow the POSSEL program on the separator (see Table of Materials) to prepare eight columns. Transfer cells 1 mL by 1 mL on the column. Wait for all the cells to pass through before adding another mL. Elute CD11b+ cells on sterile elution plate with 1 mL of sorting buffer (Figure 2L).\nPool CD11b+ cells in a new 50 mL tube (Figure 2M).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of cold microglia medium (step 1.6) (Figure 2N).\nCount the CD11b+ cells. At P8, one should obtain ~650,000 cells per brain.\n\tNOTE: In the present protocol, the cells were counted using an automated cell counter (see Table of Materials).\nResuspend the cells in cold microglia medium to a final concentration of 650,000-700,000 cells/mL and dispense in cell culture plates.\n\tNOTE: The 6-well plates are for Western Blot (2 mL per well); the 12-well plates are for RT-qPCR analysis (1 mL per well), and the 96-well plates are for phagocytic assay (250 µL per well); all three were used for this work. However, in this manuscript, the results from the Western Blot analysis are not shown, but it is possible to perform with this protocol.\nPlace the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight. Change the medium carefully with a 1,000 µL pipette with pre-heated microglia medium.\nPlace the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight before stimulation.",
    "NOTE: Isolating microglia from more than 36 pups and after P9 are not recommended. This will increase the risk of contamination and accumulation of cell debris to activate microglia.\n4. Cell stimulations\nPrepare stimulation reagents according to Table 3 using the commercially available reagents (see Table of Materials).\nAdd the appropriate volume in each stimulated well.\n\tNOTE: The appropriate volume depends on the concentration of the stimulus and the size of the well.\nPlace the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2until the end of stimulation at 6 h, 24 h, or 48 h.\nFor the Western Blot analysis, aspirate the supernatant and add 50 µL of protein lysis buffer (see Table of Materials) with a pipette. Using tips, scratch the bottom of the plate to detach the lysed cells and transfer them to 1.5 mL tubes. Store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The culture plates can be stored for years at -80 °C if the supernatant is aspirated correctly.\nFor RT-qPCR analysis6,31, aspirate the supernatant and store the culture plates directly at -80 °C until mRNA extraction (step 5).\nFor the phagocytic assay, please see step 6.\n5. mRNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis\nPerform RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and RT-qPCR following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). Refer to Table 4 for the primer sequences5,6,31.\nPerform RT-qPCR analysis by following the previously published report5.\n6. Phagocytic assay\nStimulate the cells and perform phagocytic assay during the last 3 h of the stimulation. For example, for stimulation of 6 h, start the phagocytic assay after 3 h of stimulation; and for stimulation of 12 h, start the phagocytic assay 9 h after the beginning of the stimulation.",
    "Calculate the number of beads needed to prepare considering the ratio (1 cell: 50 beads). For one well of the 96-well plate, 8.1 x 106 beads are required. Prepare the beads mixture according to Table 5.\n\tNOTE: Carefully vortex the beads stock vial before adding to the PBS/FBS mixture.\nIncubate for 1 h in a water bath at 37 °C. Vortex every 10 min.\nCalculate the solution volume to add to each well. Add the solution and incubate for 3 h.\nRinse the wells three times with 1x PBS. Read the fluorescence emission at 550 nm (Cy3 emission wavelength).\n7. Purity quality control\nEvaluate the purity of CD11b magnetic isolation by flow cytometry (FACS) (before and after cell sorting), and then perform the RT-qPCR.\n\t\nCount the cells and resuspend in FACS buffer (PBS + 2 mM of EDTA + 0.5% of Bovine Serum Albumin) in order to obtain a dilution of 10 x 106 cells/mL after step 3.5 and step 3.14.\nAfter 15 min of the conventional Fc blocking32,33, incubate the cells for 15 min with viability probe (FVS780) and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies against mouse CD45, CD11b, CX3CR1, ACSA-2, O4 or their corresponding control isotypes32,33 at the concentration recommended by the manufacturers (see Table of Materials).\nWash the cells with FACS buffer, fix, and permeabilize with a commercially available permeabilization kit (see Table of Materials).\nPerform Fc blocking again on the permeabilized cells, and then incubate with fluorophore-conjugated antibody against NeuN (see Table of Materials) or its control isotype for 15 min.\nPerform FACS analysis after washing with FACS buffer.",
    "After excluding the doublets and the dead cells based on morphological parameters and FVS780 staining, respectively, select the gating strategy for the surface expression of CX3CR1 (microglia), ACSA-2 (astrocytes), O4 (oligodendrocytes), and intracellular presence of NeuN (neurons) for the analysis of the percentage of positive cells.\nFollowing step 5, extract mRNA and perform RT-qPCR to quantify Itgam (CD11b), Cx3cr1, Olig2, Synaptophysin, and Gfap mRNA. Normalize Cq using Rpl13a mRNA as a reporter, and perform a relative expression to Itgam mRNA.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
