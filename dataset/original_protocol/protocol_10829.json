    "1. Generation of stable cell line (e.g. MDCK cells)\nPlate cells at 80-90% confluency in a p35 dish. Do not let cells form 100% confluent monolayer, which will reduce transfection efficiency.\nTransfect the cells with the plasmid of interest using Lipofectamine 2000. Optimize transfection conditions using manufacturer's protocol.\nNext day, passage the cells into two p150 petri dishes. The large dish is recommended to allow enough spacing between the stable colonies.\nNext day, change the media and add 500 μg/ml of G418 to each dish. The G418 concentration should be optimized for individual cell lines.\nChange media every other day for approximately 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, G418-resistant colonies should start to form, and will be visible by the naked eye.\nUsing an inverted fluorescent microscope, identify GFP positive colonies. Mark these colonies on the plate using a sharpie pen.\nTo selectively trypsinize the colonies from the tissue culture plate, aspirate out the media, and wash the cells twice with PBS or trypsin solution. On the second wash, do not aspirate out all the solution. Leave a thin layer of liquid on the bottom of the plate to prevent cells from drying.\nFor each marked colony: use a sterilized cotton swab to wipe as close as possible around the edge of the colony. This will create an island of wet area containing the cell colony. Pipette 10 μl of trypsin onto the colony. Repeat for every colony, and proceed quickly to avoid drying. An experienced researcher can usually pick ~12 colonies per p150 plate.\nIncubate plate at 37 °C for 5-10 minutes until cells detach from the plate and appear round.",
    "For each colony: Pipette 10 μl of trypsin onto the colony, and pipette up and down a couple times to detach cells from the plate. Then pipette all the cells from the colony into a single well in a 24 well dish.\nAfter stable colonies have grown, protein expression of each colony is analyzed using standard western blot and immunofluorescence. Expand these cell lines for further analysis.\n2. Surface modification of glass bottom dish for optimal collagen binding (Optional)\nTo silanize the glass, pipette 300 μl of 2% 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane solution onto the glass portion of each p35 dish with a 10 mm opening. See Figure 1 for the silanization and cross-linking schematic. 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane is diluted in filtered water.\nIncubate for 1 hour at room temperature.\nAspirate out the 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane solution and wash with filtered water three times for 10 minutes each.\nAspirate out the water and place dishes on hot plate set to 50 °C for 1.5 hours. Place tops of dishes slightly off the dish so that moisture in the dish can escape.\nRemove dishes from heat and allow to cool.\nPipette 300 μl of 2% glutaraldehyde solution onto the glass portion of each dish. The glutaraldehyde is diluted in PBS.\nIncubate for 1 hour.\nAspirate out the glutaraldehyde solution and wash dishes with PBS three times for 10 minutes each.\nSterilize dishes by exposure to UV light for 1 hour. The silanized dishes may be stored at room temperature.\n3. Preparation of 3D collagen gel with tracer particles\nWash fluorescent tracer particles by spinning down 100 μl of stock tracer particles (1010 particles/ml) in a centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes, aspirate out liquid, and add 500 μl of media. Repeat 5 times. After last wash, resuspend particles in 30 μl of media.",
    "Trypsinize GFP expressing cells as usual.\nResuspend cell pellet to approximately 2 x 106 cells/ml.\nPipette 240 μl of growth media into an eppendorf tube.\nAdd 12.6 μl of 1M Hepes, 20 μl of filtered water, 50 μl of cell solution, then 10 μl of fluorescent particles.\nLastly, add 167 μl of bovine dermis Collagen I solution (to obtain a working concentration of 1 mg/ml).\nMix solution thoroughly, then pipette 80 μl of the solution onto the glass portion of the silanized glass bottom dish.\nPlace dish into incubator and allow the gel to polymerize at 37 °C for 30 minutes. See Figure 1A for typical collagen gel in a p35 glass bottom dish.\nAdd 2 ml of growth media carefully to each dish.\n4. Procedure for time-lapse image acquisition\nTurn on the temperature control of the microscope enclosure and let the scope chamber equilibrate to a steady state temperature to 37 °C. See Figure 2 for an example of live-cell imaging system.\nChange media to the new media supplemented with 25 mM Hepes to maintain a neutral pH. For DIC imaging, exchange the top of the dish with one that has a glass top. Using a thin strip of parafilm, cover the side of the dish to prevent media evaporation.\nFor an oil immersion objective, place one drop of immersion fluid on the objective.\nPlace the collagen gel containing dish on microscope stage, and make sure the dish makes contact with the immersion liquid.\nFocus the sample and search for cells of interest to image. To minimize stage drift, allow dish to settle for about 45 minutes before starting a long capture.",
    "Specify the parameters of image acquisition. Minimize laser exposure, which could damage the cells, by modulating the laser power, exposure time, frequency and duration of capture time. The actual parameters will vary with the microscope system and cell type.\nDuring the time-lapse acquisition, an inhibitor may be added. For the inhibitor addition experiment, do not seal the dish with parafilm.\n\t\nPrepare Hepes supplemented media with drug at a desired working concentration.\nWhen ready to add drug to media, pause the image capture, and carefully remove the dish top without disturbing the dish.\nAspirate out the media in the dish, and pipette the drug containing media into the dish. Then, carefully replace the dish top.\nThe sample may be out-of-focus due to the addition of new media, readjust the focus.\nRestart the capture, then monitor the capture for the next 30 minutes, and readjust the focus as necessary. See Figure 4 for an example of drug addition experiment.\n5. FRAP procedure and analysis\nThe FRAP setup varies between systems, follow manufacturer's instruction.\nSet up parameters for live-cell imaging.\nSet up parameters for photobleaching. Use sufficient laser power to photobleach the fluorescent signal without damaging the cell. Test these parameters on practice cells.\nStart image capture, and allow at least 5 frames of image capture before photobleaching the region of interest.\nContinue capture, and recovery time should be sufficient to capture the full fluorescence recovery. See Figure 5 for an example of FRAP experiment.",
    "Analyze the fluorescence recovery by measuring the average fluorescent intensity of the photobleached area (before and after photobleaching) over time. Using a statistical analysis software (e.g. Excel), fit the recovery curve to the exponential equation: I=If(1-e-kt), where I is the intensity, If is the final intensity, t is time, and τ½ is the time it takes for intensity to reach half the final value: τ½=ln(2)/k. The half-time is a measure of the rate of mobility of the protein.\nObtain the parameters, half-time and final intensity from the exponential-fit curve. Calculate the mobile fraction by taking the ratio of the final to initial fluorescence intensities.\n6. Representative Results",
    "An example of the live-cell imaging of healthy epithelial cells within the matrix is shown in Figure 3. Healthy cells exhibit a smooth, continuous membrane, and distinct nucleus, whereas unhealthy cells often have a disrupted membrane, and an excessive number of vacuoles. In a 3D matrix, single epithelial cells migrate1, and over the course of several days, epithelial cells form three-dimensional, spherical, multi-cellular cysts within the matrix2. The cells are also highly dynamic, and migrate within the cyst (Figure 3). The matrix deformation as a result of the traction forces exerted by migrating cells is analyzed through the displacement of tracer particles embedded in the surrounding matrix (Figure 4). The tracer particle movements are displayed as a maximum projection image of different time points, and each time point is pseudo-colored to indicate the time (Figure 4B). Alternatively, the images of an individual tracer particle are displayed as a montage to show the movement of the tracer particle over time (Figure 4C). All image analysis was done using ImageJ. These qualitative assessments of matrix deformation, and therefore the forces exerted by migrating cells, are useful first approximation of traction force distribution. The quantitative estimation of traction forces exerted by migrating cells in 3D is beyond the scope of this protocol and is described elsewhere3,4.\nA typical fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiment is shown in Figure 5. The region of interest must be photobleached using optimized laser settings so that the fluorescence intensity is visibly diminished compared to background levels (to maximize signal-to-noise ratio), while maintaining healthy and undamaged cells. The optimal setting must be determined empirically as each FRAP setup is different (e.g., FRAP using laser-scanning confocal system).",
    "The exposure and time-interval of post-FRAP image acquisition must be carefully controlled to avoid background photobleaching. The use of lower laser power, short exposure time, and the use of sensitive camera and high efficient optics are essential for high quality FRAP imaging. If the fluorescence bleaching during the image acquisition is significant, this background fading must be quantified and normalized from the observed fluorescence intensity recovery. Due to 3D nature of environment, the z-component of fluorescence intensity recovery may become significant. Therefore, it is important to define a photobleached volume by taking pre and post 3D-stack images of photobleached region. Further analysis and modeling of fluorescence recovery is discussed elsewhere5,6.\nThe unique combination of live-cell imaging techniques: GFP to follow the dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins, red fluorescence tracer particles to monitor the matrix deformation, and the addition of inhibitors, can be used simultaneously for the analysis of protein dynamics, traction force and molecular pathways.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3589/3589fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Preparation of collagen gel. A) Polymerized collagen matrix on a glass-bottom dish. The pink color of the gel is due to embedded fluorescent particles. B) Procedure to treat the glass bottom dishes to crosslink the collagen gel to the glass surface. First, the glass bottom dish is treated with 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane solution, then glutaraldehyde solution that crosslinks the collagen matrix to the glass.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3589/3589fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2.  Schematics of confocal/FRAP microscope setup. The confocal microscope is based on a Zeiss AxioObserver with a CoolSnap HQ II CCD camera and completely automated by Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). The confocal unit is custom designed and based on Yokogawa spinning disk unit CSU10 and two solid-state lasers (488 nm with 50 mW and 561 nm with 40 mW) with Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF) to allow milliseconds switching between two lasers. The emission filters are 525/50 nm and 620/60 nm (#118661 and #118085, Chroma Technology) and dichroic mirror is 488-568 BrightLine Dual band (Semrock). The objectives are a long working distance 40x C-Apochromat objective with NA 1.1 and working distance of 0.62 mm, and a 63x Plan-Apochromat objective with NA 1.4 and a working distance of 0.19 mm. The microscope also includes a FRAP photoablation system that consists of a fiber optically pumped dye laser, a computer controlled beam position and intensity, and a diffraction limited spot size. Furthermore, the microscope is equipped with an x-y motorized stage that includes 0.1 micron linear encoders on each axis. During the time-lapse imaging, the environmental temperature is maintained by a custom designed microscope chamber and a heater with a feedback temperature control. To isolate any noise and vibration, the entire microscope system is on a vibration-free table.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3589/3589fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
