  "procedures": [
    "1. The Stereo Microscope System\nNote: Although this protocol is easily adaptable to virtually any stereo microscope system coupled to a digital camera with the capability of acquiring video, details are provided on the system used in our lab (Table of Materials/Equipment).\nAcquire digital video using a trinocular stereo microscope coupled to a commercial digital camera.\nIn order to couple the commercial digital camera to the trinocular port of the stereo microscope, remove the ½x C-mount of the phototube port of the stereo microscope and replace it with a 1X C-mount.\nMount a digital camera coupler (43 mm thread) to the 1X C-mount.\nMount two step-down rings, 58 mm to 48 mm, and 48 mm to 43 mm, to the camera coupler to bridge the connection from the digital camera coupler to a lens adapter kit for the digital camera.\nMount the digital camera to the lens adapter kit.\nAcquire video with the microscope magnification and optical zoom of the digital camera set for a combined magnification of approximately 12X (30 frames per sec, 640 x 480 pixels). Note: The magnification of the stereo microscope must be compensated in accordance with the newly reconfigured 1X C-mount of the trinocular port.\n2. Imaging Drosophila Third Instar Larvae\nTape a permanent marker to the black stage plate of a stereo microscope coupled to a digital camera so that the side of the marker cap occupies approximately ⅓ to ¼ of the vertical field of view observed in the camera LCD monitor. Use marker tops as the stage to perform larval imaging because they come in an assortment of colors that can be used to color code and differentiate the genotypes of larvae being imaged.",
    "Demarcate the field of view observed in the digital camera LCD monitor on the surface of the marker top with a fine point marker.\nSelect a third instar larva to image. The criteria for selecting third instar larvae was body length, emergence from the food source during the larval phase of the life cycle, the presence of anterior and posterior spiracles, and the structure of the mandibular hooks of the mouth apparatus11. Ensure the larva is clean by washing it thoroughly in water.\nIlluminate the permanent marker top stage from above with light from a fiber optic lighting system. Adjust the angle of incident light to provide optimal illumination.\nFocus the microscope on the edge of the permanent marker top. Begin acquiring digital video.\nPlace the larva on the side of the marker cap approximately 75° away from the vertical axis, just outside the field of view, with the anterior of the larva facing towards the field of view (Figure 1). Note: Placement of the larva on the side of the marker cap allows the camera to record movement of the larva from a lateral perspective. It helps to keep the larva moist with water so they don't fall off the side of the marker cap. Care must be exercised, however, to not use too much water as excessive amounts will adhere to the larva as it crawls across the field.\nGently poke and prod the larva with a small paintbrush to coerce it to crawl across the field of view. Be patient as the larvae rarely cooperate and often have to be returned to the starting point many times before they crawl straight across the field.\nRecord approximately 10-15 min of uninterrupted digital video footage and crop and remove all unnecessary footage post-acquisition with digital video editing software.",
    "3. Imaging Adult Drosophila\nPlace a single adult Drosophila in a disposable 1.5 ml spectroscopic polystyrene cuvette.\n\tNote: CO2 anaesthetization of adult Drosophila immediately before a behavioral analysis protocol can compromise results12. It is recommended that adult Drosophila be given a 24-hr period to recover from CO2 anaesthetization before performing in a behavioral test13.\nPlug the end of the cuvette with a small cotton ball. Ensure the cotton ball is packed tight enough to occupy the large cap space and confines the fly to the reduced volume compartment of the cuvette.\nPlace the cuvette on the white stage plate of a stereo microscope and properly align the reduced volume compartment of the cuvette with the field of view observed in the digital camera LCD monitor.\nIlluminate the cuvette from above with light from a fiber optic lighting system. Adjust the angle of incident light to provide optimal illumination.\nFocus the microscope and begin acquiring digital video.\nRecord approximately 30-45 min of uninterrupted digital video footage and crop and remove all unnecessary footage post-acquisition with digital video editing software.\nSubscription Required.
