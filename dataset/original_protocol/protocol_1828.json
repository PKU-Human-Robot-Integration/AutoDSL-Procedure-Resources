    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation for cell filtration\nTiming: 10 min (on the day of the experiment)\nThe filtration apparatus which will be used to filter cells in step 10 is setup.\nPrepare a Whatman filter funnel on top of an Erlenmeyer filter flask (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1420-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of a filtering apparatus\n(A) The parts of the apparatus are labeled i–iv from top to bottom.\n(B) An assembled apparatus. The reservoir (i) is placed on top of the filter (iii). In between i and iii is a piece of 47 mm (0.45 μm pore) filter paper. These two pieces are held together by a clamp (ii). This assembled piece is then placed upon a filtration flask (iv) which is attached to a vacuum.\nBefore adding cells to the filter, turn on the vacuum and wet the filter paper completely with deionized water.\nFill a clean container with liquid nitrogen.\nFor each sample to be collected, puncture the lid of a 50 mL conical tube using an 18G needle. This hole allows for the evaporation of liquid nitrogen.\nFill the conical with liquid nitrogen to 1/3 full and place it into the clean container filled with liquid nitrogen.\nMeiotic induction and cell collection\nTiming: 5 h\nCells are induced to undergo meiosis and then harvested at the indicated timepoints.\nNote: A minimum of two, but ideally three or more replicates should be performed. Collect replicates on separate days.\nNote: We wanted to minimize added stressors to cells, so we opted to collect the cells by filtration immediately followed by cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. Alternatives, such as collection by centrifuge, were not tested.",
    "Take the OD600 for cells grown for 16 h in rYPD and calculate the volume of cells required to reach 250 OD600 units. Pipet that volume into a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Do not use the 50 mL conical in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Aim for OD600 > 6 for optimal meiotic synchrony and efficiency.\nCentrifuge at 2000 g for 2 min at 25 °C, pour off the liquid, and resuspend in 40 mL milliQ water.\nCentrifuge at 2000 g for 2 min at 25 °C, pour off the liquid, and resuspend in SPO to a final volume of 100 mL in a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nShake at 300 rpm at 30 °C for 2 h.\nNote: By removing a fermentable carbon source from the cultures, the cells switch to cellular respiration. This primes the cells for entry to meiosis; however, because the meiotic regulators IME1 and IME4 are controlled by the CUP1 promoter, they will not enter the meiotic program until exposed to CuSO4.\nCollect 40 mL of cells by filtration.\nPour the cells into the funnel attached on top of the filtration apparatus and filter out the liquid via vacuum (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1420-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cell filtration and harvesting\n(A) With the vacuum on, pour the cells into the reservoir. Allow the liquid to be vacuumed into the flask below.\n(B) When no liquid remains in the reservoir, remove the clamp and expose the filter paper with cells on it. Using a sterilized spatula, scrape the cells from the filter paper.\nRemove the clamp and funnel from the filtration apparatus and scrape up the cells using an ethanol sterilized spatula. Allow the cells to build up on the spatula (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Place the spatula with cells into the clean container filled with liquid nitrogen. Keep the cells submerged for 20 s to snap freeze them.\nDip the spatula with the cells into the 50 mL conical 1/3 full of liquid nitrogen.\nLay the punctured cap onto the conical. At this point the spatula is still in the tube, so the cap will not sit flush on the conical. While pressing on the cap, pull the spatula from the tube in a manner that breaks the cell pellet from the spatula, leaving the frozen cells in the conical.\nNote: The cells will be stuck in a hard frozen clump to the spatula. Pressure between the rim of the conical tube and its cap is used to break the hard mass of frozen cells away from the metal spatula.\nThere will be 100 OD600 units of cells in the tube.\nNote: This is a large number of cells, but it is the minimum that we have tested. The TL-seq method to be described below requires a high cell input due to multiple rounds of processing and the selection of only the most 5′ end of capped transcripts.\nScrew the cap onto the tube before storing at −80 °C.\nPause point: The frozen cells can be stored at −80 °C for at least 3 months.\nTo the remaining 60 mL of cells, add 30 μL of 100 mM CuSO4 and continue shaking at 30 °C for 2 h.\nNote: This initiates meiosis by inducing expression of IME1 and IME4.\nAt 2 h after addition of CuSO4 and 4 h after transfer to SPO, collect the second timepoint (see step 10).",
    "Transfer the remaining 20 mL of cells to a new 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and continue shaking at 30 °C until > 24 h after transfer of the cells to SPO.\nUnder a brightfield microscope, determine the sporulation status of at least 100 cells to calculate the sporulation efficiency.\nCritical: At least 90 % of cells should have completed sporulation. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] in the Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for additional assistance.\nTotal RNA extraction and poly(A)-selection\nTiming: 3 days\nCells are lysed and a total RNA extraction is performed. Poly(A) selection isolates mRNA which can then be used for direct RNA sequencing or TL-seq.\nThaw 100 OD600 units of cells per time point on ice.\nAdd 5 mL of TES, vortex to resuspend, and aliquot 10 × 500 μL into 1.5 mL screw cap tubes for each timepoint (20 tubes total for 2 timepoints).\nNote: For every 10 OD600 units of cells, resuspend in 500 μL of TES. If greater than 100 OD600 units of cells are collected, increase the total volume of TES proportionally. Keep the volume of TES per tube constant (500 μL) by increasing the number of tubes used.\nAdd 500 μL of acid phenol to each tube. Incubate at 65 °C for 45 min in a Thermomixer C shaking at 1400 RPM. Centrifuge at room temperature for 5 min at 20,000 g.\nTransfer the aqueous phase to 1 mL of cold 100 % ethanol and 40 μL of 3 M sodium acetate using a P200 pipet. Invert to mix, and incubate > 16 h at −20 °C.\nPause point: RNA can be stored at this point for at least 2 weeks.",
    "Retrieve samples and centrifuge the samples at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the liquid and wash in 1 mL of 80 % ethanol.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g for 5 min to bring the RNA pellet to the bottom of the tube. Carefully aspirate the 80 % ethanol until 100 μL remains.\nPerform an additional short spin and remove residual ethanol with a P200 pipet. Dry pellets in the hood for 25 min or until dry.\nResuspend in 30 μL of nuclease-free water by incubating in a Thermomixer at 37 °C with shaking (1400 RPM).\nCombine all tubes for each timepoint, quantify total RNA using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit, and check RIN score using a Bioanalyzer with an RNA Analysis kit.\nNote: From an input of 100 OD600 units of cells, expect 1–2 mg of total RNA.\nTo 1 mg total RNA, spike in 25 ng of pooled in vitro transcripts (IVTs). IVTs can be prepared as described in Box 1 of Pelechano et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]. These are transcripts added in known amounts that can be used for quality control during analysis.\nAdd nuclease-free water to bring the RNA concentration to 600 μg/mL in a 2 mL tube. The final volume should be 833 μL per timepoint.\nFollow the Poly(A)Purist MAG kit instructions to isolate poly(A) specific RNA.\nNote: There are many commercial poly(A) selection kits that could be used in place of the Poly(A)Purist MAG kit. Most critical is that 5–10 μg of mRNA are isolated and rRNA cannot be seen on Bioanalyzer traces after completion of the poly(A) selection.",
    "Premix 40 μL 3 M Sodium acetate, 1 μL glycogen (5 mg/mL) and 1.1 mL ethanol in a fresh tube. Add the eluted poly(A) RNA mixture and mix by inversion. Leave the RNA to precipitate at –20 °C for > 16 h or at –80 °C for 1 h.\nPause point: RNA can be stored up to a month at this point.\nRecover the RNA by centrifugation at ≥12,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. RNA pellet might be loose.\nAdd 1 mL 80 % ethanol and vortex the tube a few times. Pellet the RNA by centrifuging for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove supernatant.\nDissolve the poly(A) RNA pellet in 21 μL pre-heated nuclease-free water (NO EDTA) by vortexing briefly for several seconds.\nNote: The nuclease-free water should be pre-heated to 60 °C–80 °C to help the RNA dissolve into solution.\nPause point: Flash freeze the RNA in liquid nitrogen and store at −80 °C if not continuing with the protocol immediately. The RNA can be stored at −80 °C for several months.\nQuantify the extracted RNA using Qubit RNA BR reagents.\nNote: A return of 1 % of input material is expected during poly(A) selection. With an input of 1 mg of RNA, between 5 and 15 μg of poly(A) selected RNA is an ideal recovery range.\nNanopore direct RNA sequencing and analysis\nTiming: Library prep and loading 3 h, data acquisition and processing up to 3 days\nQuality checked poly(A) selected mRNA is prepared for sequencing and loaded onto ONT’s MinION device. The output data is processed, aligned to the SK1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, and the sequenced transcripts are visualized.\nBefore proceeding with preparation of a library for direct RNA sequencing, check the quality of the poly(A) selected RNA.",
    "Assess fragment length using a Bioanalyzer with an RNA Analysis kit.\nIdeal average fragment size 2000 bp\nCheck the RNA purity by Nanodrop.\nIdeal A260:A280 ratio of 2.0\nIdeal A260:A230 ratio of 2.0–2.2\nDilute 500 ng of poly(A) selected RNA to 9 μL in nuclease-free water.\nContinue following the “Direct RNA sequencing” protocol from ONT for use with the kit (SQK-RNA002)\nTo setup and perform the sequencing run, refer to ONT’s “MinKNOW Protocol”.\nCritical: If the host computer does not meet the minimum specifications, live base calling should be turned off. Base calling can be performed later with a compatible computer using the standalone Guppy base calling software.\nNote: The Albacore software was used for base calling in Tresenrider et al., (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]. This program is no longer supported and has been replaced by Guppy.\nOptional: If base calling was not performed live, run guppy_basecaller in which --input_pathpoints towards the directory containing the fast5 files outputted by MinKNOW.\nTranscript leader sequencing (TL-seq) library preparation\nTiming: 5 days\nQuality checked poly(A) selected mRNA is used in the construction of TL-seq libraries.\nNote: This protocol is adapted from Wu et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] and was also used in Chia et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] provides an overview of the critical steps in TL-seq.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1420-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. An illustration of key steps in the TL-seq protocol (A-J).\nUse the remaining poly(A) selected RNA for TL-seq library preparation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nFollow the instructions for the RNA Fragmentation Reagent (Ambion) to fragment the RNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: In our experience, 3 minutes fragmented the RNA from meiotic yeast cells into 200 bp fragments.",
    "Critical: Alkaline hydrolysis at 70 °C is performed to shear the RNAs into uniform length fragments. Depending on the average physical length of the transcriptome, different fragmentation times may be needed to fragment RNAs in a population to a specific size. Hence, the best fragmentation time must be determined in a test experiment which is recommended to be performed before any larger experiment with multiple samples. In order to test the hydrolysis at multiple times, the cell collection should be scaled up to produce 5 μg of poly(A) selected RNA for each of the times to be tested.\nNote: This fragmentation method leaves a 5′-OH and a 3′-phosphate which prevents RNA-ligation onto the fragment by T4 RNA Ligase. This necessitates downstream end-repair with rSAP or equivalent enzymes.\nUse a Bioanalyzer with RNA reagents to determine the average size of the fragmented RNA.\nNote: See Expected Outcomes for an example of the RNA fragments before and after fragmentation.\nSize select 200–300 bp fragments using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions for RNA Cleanup. Elute the RNA from the column in 14 μL of nuclease-free water. Perform a second elution in 14 μL of nuclease-free water such that the final eluted volume will be 24 μL.\nCheck the fragment size by Bioanalyzer with RNA reagents.\nTo remove 5′-phosphates from uncapped fragments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), setup the reaction below in a 1.5 mL tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_10.csv\nCritical: Because we aim to sequence only the most 5′end of transcripts, we do not want to prepare a library dominated by fragments from uncapped transcripts. Dephosphorylation of the 5′-end of uncapped fragments will prevent the ligation of adaptors to these RNA fragments in future steps.\nNote: Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (rSAP) also repairs the 3′-ends of alkaline fragmented RNA to 3′-OH making them ligation competent.",
    "Incubate the samples for 1 h at 37 °C.\nHeat inactivate at 65 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL acid phenol and incubate at 65 °C for 45 min in a Thermomixer C shaking at 1400 RPM.\nCentrifuge at room temperature for 5 min at 20,000 g.\nUsing a P200 pipet, transfer the aqueous phase to 1 mL of cold 100 % ethanol, 40 μL of 3 M sodium acetate, and 1 μL of linear acrylamide.\nInvert to mix and incubate > 16 h at −20 °C or 1 h at −80 °C.\nPause point: RNA can be stored at this point for at least one month.\nRetrieve samples and centrifuge the samples at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the liquid and wash in 1 mL of 80 % ethanol.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g for 5 min to bring the RNA pellet to the bottom of the tube. Carefully aspirate the 80 % ethanol until 100 μL remains.\nPerform an additional short spin and remove any residual ethanol with a P200 pipet. Dry pellets in the hood.\nResuspend in 13 μL of nuclease-free water.\nIn each tube, setup the reaction below to de-cap the capped transcripts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "Critical: Because the dephosphorylation reaction does not remove 100 % of 5′-phosphates, some will remain. These fragments should be considered noise as they do not represent the true 5′-end of a transcript. It is important to sequence at least one library that includes only the signal from these background fragments. This can be done by splitting the sample into two before the de-capping reaction and treating only one half of the RNA with the CAP-CLIP enzyme, which removes the m7G cap from mRNA fragments. All subsequent steps should be applied to both the + and – CAP-CLIP reactions. We recommend performing this control for one sample per timepoint if processing all replicates at the same time.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_11.csv\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 37 °C.\nPerform an acid phenol-based ethanol precipitation as in the previous step.\nResuspend in 12 μL nuclease-free water.\nSetup the ligation reaction below in a PCR tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_12.csv\nIncubate at 16 °C for 16 h in a thermocycler with the heated lid turned off.\nPurify the ligation on a Qiagen RNeasy Mini column to remove excess un-ligated adapter.\nElute in 14 μL, the final eluted volume will be 11 μL due to volume loss from the column purification.\nSetup the RNA denaturation reaction below in a PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_13.csv\nDenature at 65 °C for 5 min.

Vortex to mix well and then centrifuge briefly.\nTo each tube, add 6 μL of the mixture below to bring the total volume (step 44 + 45) to 20 μL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_14.csv\nIncubate in a thermocycler with the following conditions to complete the reverse transcription (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1420_15.csv",

This step is NOT included in the KAPA HyperPrep kit instructions.\nWhile performing the Adapter Ligation and Cleanup, prepare Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fdynabeads_myone_savC1_man.pdf].\nAdd 20 μL of washed Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads to 20 μL adapter-ligated cDNA and incubate for 30 min at 25 °C with rotation.
