    "All experiments were carried out under NIH guidelines and animal protocols approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparing Animals for Surgery\nAnesthetize mice with a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via subcutaneous inguinal injection with a sterile 1 ml insulin syringe. Carrier solution contains a mixture of 0.9% saline, 17.4 mg/ml ketamine, and 2.6 mg/ml xylazine. Place animals back in cages while waiting for medication to take effect.\n\tNOTE: If the loading dose does not provide sufficient anesthesia for the duration of the procedure, an additional 25% of the loading dose may be injected.\nMonitor animals post injection to check for steady respiratory rates and appropriate depression of arousal levels. Check arousal level with a hind foot pinch, which should elicit no response when sufficiently anesthetized.\n\tNOTE: This usually takes 3-5 min for a young adult mouse averaging 25 to 30 g. If the animal is still responsive after 10 min post injection, an additional 25% of the anesthetic loading dose may be injected.\nApply petrolatum and light mineral oil ophthalmic ointment to the animal's eyes to prevent dryness. Remove animals from cage and place on a clean, flat surface. Shave the desired hind limb from foot to pelvis using an electric hair trimmer, exposing only the lateral aspect of the limb.\nApply a chemical hair remover to the shaved site for 1 min. Manually remove the hair using laboratory wipes. Clean the depilated area with laboratory wipe soaked in ethanol.\n2. Surgical Procedure",
    "Sterilize surgical instruments via autoclave or other appropriate method. Clean the surgical site and surgical board with 80% ethanol/H20. Disinfect the surgical site with proviodine. Place mouse on surgical board and align with limb restraints. Keep the target hind limb in an anatomically natural position with the knee joint slightly extended without internal or external rotation.\nPlace animal and board under the surgical microscope. Orient to the proper incision site via palpation of superficial landmarks, specifically the bony knee joint and the ridge between the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles.\nMake an approximately 3 cm incision through the skin using a scalpel or spring scissors while using general forceps for gripping. Make the incision perpendicular to the underlying course of the common fibular nerve.\nContinue the incision through the superficial fascia, exposing the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis muscles. Separate these muscles by cutting through the connecting deep fascia. A 1-2 cm cut should be sufficient.\nRetract the biceps femoris muscle caudally using mechanical retractors, revealing the common fibular nerve.\nTrace the nerve proximally until its intersection with the tendon of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle is found. Note: Exposure may require additional manipulation of the retracted skin and muscle. This intersection is used as the stable landmark for the nerve injury.\nGrasp the nerve with a fine forceps, aligning the tips in a parallel fashion to the lateral border of the gastrocnemius tendon. Crush the common fibular nerve by applying steady, hard pressure for 5 sec.\nCorroborate full crush of the nerve by visual inspection through the surgical scope. It will appear translucent at the site of injury. If using mice expressing fluorescence proteins in peripheral axons, the fluorescence will disappear from the site of injury.",
    "Remove retractors and realign muscles in their anatomic positions. Close the incision site with 6-0 silk sutures. 1-3 simple interrupted sutures is sufficient. Place recuperating mouse on a heating pad in a clean cage.\nMonitor all animals for 2 hr post-operation to check for breathing and any adverse reactions to the anesthesia. Administer an initial dose of buprenorphine 0.05-0.10 mg/kg via subcutaneous inguinal injection immediately following recovery from surgery. Give 3 additional doses every 12 hr over the next 48 hr. After full recovery, return mice to the animal care facility.\n3. Isolation and Staining of Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) Muscles\nSacrifice animals using isoflurane. Dispense 0.5 ml liquid isoflurane into a 50 ml tube packed with absorbent labwipes. Place the uncapped tube with the animal in a sealed 2,500 cm3 chamber. At least 4 min of exposure is sufficient. Test for loss of bilateral palpebral, toe-pinch, and tail-pinch reflexes to ensure that each animal is unconscious before proceeding with perfusion.\nTranscardially perfuse16 animals first with 10 ml 0.1M PBS, then 25 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4). Heparin (30 units/20 g animal weight) may be added with the PBS (10 units/ml) to prevent blood clotting in small capillary beds, improving perfusion results.\nRemove the skin covering hind limbs by using scissors to cut transversally through the skin around the circumference of the abdomen. Peel down the skin past the hind limbs and feet using forceps.\nRemove superficial fascia of hind limbs by grasping and peeling with forceps. If using mice expressing fluorescence proteins in peripheral axons, post-fix whole mice overnight in 4% PFA in 50 ml tubes. Rinse three times with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Fixed mice can be stored in PBS at 4 °C. If not, skip this step and proceed to step 3.6 without post-fixing animals.",
    "Dissect out EDL muscles18 from mouse hind limbs, being sure to keep proximal and distal tendons as intact as possible.\nIncubate EDL muscles in blocking buffer (1x PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 3% BSA and 5% goat serum) for at least 1 hr.\nTo visualize motor axons and their nerve terminals, place muscles in tubes containing neurofilament (1:1,000) and synaptotagmin-2 (1:250) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 3 days. Wash muscles three times with 1x PBS and 10 min each time. Note: Skip this step if using mice expressing fluorescence proteins (XFP) in peripheral axons.\nStain the contralateral uninjured EDL as a positive control for complete NMJ innervation. Negative controls should include an EDL obtained at 4 days post-injury, a time point where the NMJ is completely denervated, as well as an EDL stained with secondary antibody only.\nIncubate muscles with appropriate fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies to detect neurofilament and synaptotagmin-2 for 1 day. Wash muscles three times with 1x PBS and 10 min each time. Note: This step can be carried out together with step 3.10. Skip this step if using mice expressing fluorescence proteins in peripheral axons.\nTo visualize the postsynaptic region of the NMJ, incubate muscles with 5 µg/ml Alexa-555 conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin diluted in blocking buffer for at least 2 hr. Wash muscles three times with 1x PBS and 10 min each time.\nTo mount whole muscles on positively charged glass slides, place the muscle directly on the slide, add a few drops of glycerol based mounting medium on the slide and cover with a coverslip. Press the coverslip against the slide to flatten the muscle. Soak off mounting media from the perimeter of the slide and coverslip using laboratory wipes. Apply nail polish to seal the edges between the coverslip and slide.",
    "4. Imaging and Data Analysis\nTo analyze the structure of NMJs, image the EDL muscle using a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped to excite 488, 555 and 633 nm light and capture the emitted light with 20X and 40X objectives.\nTo visualize whole NMJs, create maximum intensity projection images of optical sections spaced 1 to 2 μm apart extending from the lowest to highest visible regions of the NMJ. Create maximum intensity projections using commercially available imaging software.\nTo determine rates of reinnervation, categorize NMJs as: 1) completely denervated = postsynaptic site is completely devoid of contact with axon, less than 5% colocalization between the axon and AChRs. 2) Partially innervated = the axon partially overlaps the postsynapse, 5-95% colocalization between the axon and AChRs. 3) Full innervation = nearly perfect apposition between the pre- and post-synapse, greater than 95% colocalization between the axon and AChRs. Exclude NMJs that lie perpendicular to the imaging plane or are not fully visualized in the image. Note: In all these experiments, at least 3 animals and 50 NMJs per animal were examined. Results were deemed significant using a student t-test with a P value of less than 0.05.\nTo blind the operator, separate individuals can perform the surgery and image analysis. Without knowledge of the treatment groups, the analyzer can be objective with NMJ scoring. Alternatively, images can be randomized and presented to the operator for analysis without knowledge of the source animal.\n5. Quantitative PCR\nSacrifice animals using isoflurane and cervical dislocation. Remove skin and superficial fascia covering leg muscles according to step 3.3. Dissect tibialis anterior and EDL muscles according to step 3.4.",
    "Flash freeze the entire tibialis anterior and EDL muscles in a 1.5 ml tube over liquid nitrogen. Remove tissue from tube and place in a pre-chilled mortar partially submerged in liquid nitrogen. Grind frozen muscle into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.\nDissolve frozen muscle powder into a commercially available RNA extraction reagent and perform RNA extraction and genomic DNA removal with a commercially available kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPerform reverse transcription with a commercially available reverse transcriptase mix according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPerform qPCR using a commercially available kit using appropriate housekeeping genes (see table of materials). Use a commercially available quantitative PCR thermal cycler to carry out PCR (see table of materials).\nSet annealing temperature to 58 °C. Adjust additional cycling parameters to specifications of the manufacturer of taq polymerase/SYBR green mix. Include a final melt curve step in thermal cycler program consisting of 0.5 °C incremental increases from 65 °C to 95 °C to test for primer specificity and primer dimer formation.\nDetermine relative mRNA expression levels by the 2-ΔΔCT method21 using 18S RNA as the control gene.\nSubscription Required.
