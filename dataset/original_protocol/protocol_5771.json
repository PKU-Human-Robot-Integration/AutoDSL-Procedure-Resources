    "In vitro transcription of 32P-labled RNA probesDNA templates for synthesis of the RNA probe are generated by PCR using specific primers.Thaw frozen reagents, place RNA polymerase on ice and vortex the 10x Transcription buffer and keep the buffer at room temperature. All reagents should be centrifuged briefly before opening.Assemble transcription reaction at room temperature as the following sequence:1 μg DNA templateddH2O to 20 μl2 μl 10x transcription buffer (after addition of water and DNA)1 μl 10 mM ATP1 μl 10 mM CTP1 μl 10 mM GTP5 μl [α-32P]UTP2 μl T7 enzyme mix2 μl RNasin (40 U/μl)Mix thoroughly.Incubate 1 h at 37 °C.Add 1 μl of 5 mg/ml DNase I to digest the rest template DNA and incubate 10 min in 37 °C water bath.Add 1 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, mix and add 78 μl ddH2O to adjust final volume to 100 μl and mix.Purification of 32P-labled RNA probes with SPIN-Pure column (G-50)Allow a minimum of 30 min of room temperature to warm the columns before the following steps.Gently invert the column several times to suspend the column buffer (DEPC-Water).Remove the top cap from the column, and then remove the bottom tip.Allow the column buffer to drain by gravity before proceeding.Place this column/tube apparatus into an adaptor tube. Centrifuge at 1,100 x g for 2 min at room temperature.Repeat centrifugation again to let the column dry completely and discard the collection tube and the eluted buffer.Put the column in a second collection tube in upright position and apply the RNA sample (20 to 50 μl) to the center of the column gel very slowly and carefully (the rest RNA sample can be stored at -80 °C for one week).Centrifuge at 1,100 x g for 4 min. The purified 32P-labled RNA probe is collected in the bottom of the collection tube.",
    "Discard the spin column and continue with the following procedure.Pick 1 μl of the RNA sample and count the cpm value.RNA and protein binding reactionPrepare the following mixture on ice:32P-labled RNA probe (2 x 105 cpm) 1 μl 12.5 mM ATP3μl 5x binding buffer3 μl 0.5 M KClProtein (100 ng) (this protein can be a GST fusion protein purified according to the protocol prepared by GE Healthcare Life Sciences)H2O to final volume of 15 μl.Mix gently by pipetting up and down for 10 times, avoiding vortex.Place the uncovered tube containing the reaction mixture on ice, directly underneath the bulb (about 10 cm from the surface) of a 254-nm UV light source, irradiation with 4 x 105 μJ/cm2 energy.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min then keep on ice for another 3 h.Remove the non-incorporated 32PAdd 1 μl of RNase T1 (1 U/μl) to each tube and incubate for additional 10 min at 37 °C to degrade the free RNA.Add an equal volume (16 μl) of 2x SDS loading dye andseparate the sample in TGE-gel or SDS-PAGE (no boiling need).Autoradiography for 12 h to 7 days for visualization.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141022/20141022021822_3732.jpg"
