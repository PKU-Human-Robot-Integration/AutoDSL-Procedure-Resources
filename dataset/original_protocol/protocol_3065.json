    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol is aimed at injecting HCC cells orthotopically in preconditioned liver with high-fat diet feeding. Before the injection, the HCC cells are trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and placed in ice until the moment of injection. Following the anesthesia of the mouse, a parallel incision to the linea alba is made in the abdominal wall to expose the liver. Then, HCC cells are mixed 1:1 with Matrigel before injection. The injection is done orthotopically into three different sites: twice in the left-lateral and once in the left-median lobes of the liver. After closing the incision with suture, the skin is closed with wound clips. We show two different methods for closing the peritoneum after the incision by continuous or interrupted suture. Mice are monitored for 2 to 6 weeks after implantation. The main improvement of this protocol is to increase the incidence of tumors thanks to a robust procedure and the injection into three sites in the liver.\nPreparation of HCC Cells for Injection\nTiming: ∼1 h\nHere, the HCC cells are trypsinized and counted before injection.\nPrewarm DPBS and maintenance media at 37°C and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 20°C–22°C before use.\nRemove the medium from the dish of HCC cells at around 80% confluence.\nNote: This protocol uses DihXD3 as HCC cells since they are syngeneic and can be injected and grow in C57BL6 mice, but other HCC cells can also be used.\nCritical: Avoid cell passaging for at least 2 days before implantation.\nRinse the dish with prewarmed DPBS (6–8 mL per 100 mm dish) and aspirate the DPBS.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the dish. Place the plates in the 37°C incubator.\nAfter 3–5 min, check the cells detaching from the plate by using a bright-field microscope.",
    "Critical: Do not leave the cells in trypsin-EDTA for more than 5 min.\nWhen more than 90% of HCC cells are detached, add 6–8 mL per 100 mm dish of maintenance media to neutralize the trypsin in the dish. Gently mix the HCC cell suspension and collect the cells in a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the HCC cell suspension in the 15-mL centrifuge tube for 5 min at 350–400 × g at 20°C–22°C. Wash the cells with 10 mL of PBS. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 350–400 × g at 20°C–22°C and resuspend the cells in serum-free DMEM medium.\nCount the number of HCC cells and adjust the cell concentration to 106 cells per 10 μL in serum-free DMEM (corresponding to the final tumor cell inoculum per injected volume). One injection requires 106 cells in 10 μL. Prepare 10% more volume than the exact volume in the case of the loss during the injection. Keep the cell suspension on wet ice.\nOrthotopic Implantation of Syngeneic HCC Cells in Fatty Liver\nTiming: ∼20–30 min/mouse\nHere, HCC cells are mixed with Matrigel and injected into the liver. HCC cells are mixed 1:1 with Matrigel and kept in ice until the moment of the injection. After anesthetizing the mouse, the liver is exposed, and cells are injected into three sites of the liver: two injections are done into the left-lateral lobe, and the third injection is done into the left-median lobe. Each injection is performed very slowly, and the change of color of the liver is observed during the injection. After injection, the incision and the skin are closed, and mice are set up for recovery.\nPlace the Matrigel solution (10 μL per 1 injection) on wet ice.",
    "Place the required materials in the biological safety cabinet to prepare for orthotopic implantation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Surgical Preparation for Orthotopic Implantation\nIn a disinfected biological safety cabinet, prepare the surgical instruments as follows: (A) Tubes for Matrigel and HCC cell suspension on ice and 0.3-mL 31-gauge needle insulin syringes, (B) gauzes with 10% povidone-iodine solution, (C) gauzes with 70% ethanol, (D) sterilized surgical instruments, (E) autoclip applicator, (F) suture, (G) bead sterilizer, (H) ophthalmic ointment. Missing in the picture but required: an isoflurane chamber and nose cone, and a surgical microscope.\nAnesthetize the mice by using isoflurane inhalation (2%–3% to start the flow of isoflurane).\nApply pre-operative analgesia subcutaneously. Either meloxicam SR or buprenorphine can be used, depending on your IACUC protocol.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on the heating pad to avoid hypothermia under a surgical microscope.\nUse sterile gauzes with a 10% povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol to disinfect and clean the shaved abdominal region. Wait until the skin is dry from povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\nSee Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nGently grab the skin with a pair of straight blunt forceps and perform a midline abdominal incision of the skin (starting ∼1 cm under the xiphoid process).\nIdentify the linea alba in the midline of the peritoneum and make a 2.0–2.5 cm incision along the linea alba. To improve the surgical view, perform a lateral incision, perpendicular to the linea alba (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of Linea Alba and Xiphoid Process in Mouse\n(A) Incision in the skin should be parallel to the linea alba. The incision should be 2.0–2.5 cm long.",
    "(B) Incision in the peritoneum should be performed 1 cm below the xiphoid process and along the linea alba. A small lateral incision perpendicular to the linea alba will improve the view.\nCritical: Proper incision makes the procedure easier with a good surgical view of the injection site.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Mouse Preparation for Surgery (Steps 10–14)\nThis video shows how to anesthetize the mouse, apply the analgesia and ophthalmic ointment, and disinfect the abdominal area.\nSee Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nHold both sides of the peritoneum with two hemostats and flip them to the cranial side to expose the left-medial and/or left-lateral lobe (s) of the liver.\nCritical: The investigator should see an enlarged fatty liver.\nImmediately before orthotopic implantation, 10 μl of HCC cell suspension should be mixed with 10 μL of Matrigel (equal volume to cell suspension). Withdraw the total of 20 μL of Matrigel and the cell suspension with a 0.3-mL insulin syringe attached to a 31-gauge needle. This will ensure a final cell number of 106 cells per 20 μL of the injected volume of the Matrigel/HCC cells suspension.\nCritical: Keep the Matrigel-containing solution on ice to prevent gel solidification.\nAdjust the focus of the surgical microscope on the injection site. Fix the injection site and perform counter-traction by using sterile gauze.\nGently insert (approximately 2–3 mm) a 31-gauge needle of 0.3-mL insulin syringe with the Matrigel/HCC cells solution under the liver capsule.\nSlowly inject 20 μL of the Matrigel/HCC cells solution (containing 1 × 106 HCC cells) in the subcapsular region of the left-medial and/or left-lateral lobe (s). Successful implantation will change the color of the liver surface to white (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Liver Color Change during Cell Injection",
    "During injection, the liver surface will change from dark brown to pale at the injection site.\nCritical: Inject the Matrigel/HCC cells solution very slowly as much as possible to avoid leakage and to prevent damage to the liver capsule.\nCritical: Maximum 3 injections (2 injections in the left-lateral lobe and 1 injection of the left-median lobe) can be performed.\nCritical: This procedure requires surgical skill and practice to obtain reproducible results. In order to get more reproducible results is critical to inject viable cells and this is achieved by a shorter time of the procedure.\nAfter injecting the Matrigel/HCC cells solution, keep the needle at least 30 s and slowly retract the needle.\nCheck the liver surface at the needle track for leakage and bleeding.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S2. Incision to Expose the Liver for Injection (Steps 15–17)\nA correct incision in the abdominal wall results in enough view of the liver to perform the injections of cells.\nSee Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nClose the peritoneum of the abdominal wall by a continuous (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), or interrupted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) suture using PERMA-HAND SILK 5-0. Close the skin layer of the abdominal wall by Reflex 9 mm Wound Clips using the autoclip applier (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Continuous Suture\nThe continuous suture is one in which a continuous, uninterrupted length of material is used.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Interrupted Suture\nThe interrupted suture is one in which each stitch is made with a separate piece of material.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/281-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Wound Clips\nWound clips can be used for rodent skin closure. They must be applied and removed with a specific applicator.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3. Liver Orthotopic Injections (Steps 20–23)\nThree injections are performed in two different liver lobules.",
    "See Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] and S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5].\nLeave the mouse on the heating pad and allow the mouse to recover from anesthesia.\nApply postoperative analgesia if needed according to the specific animal protocol at your institution.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S4.

Mouse Recovery after Surgery (Step 25)\nMice need to be monitored after surgery. Mice should be placed on a clean cage and on top of a heat pad.\nSee Methods Video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7] for a full overview of the surgery procedure.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S7. Full Surgery Procedure Video (Steps 10–25)\nMonitoring Mouse Condition\nTiming: 2–6 weeks\nHere, mice are monitored for tumor development.\nWound clips must be removed in 10–14 days once the incision has healed.\nClosely monitor the mice for tumor progression and continue to assess their health until the experiment will be finished. HFD will be continued during the whole experiment.\nCritical: If severe weight loss occurs (>20% loss of starting body weight), the mouse should be sacrificed according to your institution’s animal protocol.\nSee the “Quantification and Statistical Analysis” section for more detail into the analysis of the results."
