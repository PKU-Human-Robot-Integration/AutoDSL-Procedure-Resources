    "Cell (HEK-293) preparationCarefully remove growth media from a confluent 10-cm dish (i.e., with a Pasteur pipette. See Note 3 for more on cell density). Add 10 ml WB (Wash Buffer) warmed to 37 °C to the plate with 10 ml pipet, pipetting up and down to gently lift cells from the bottom of the plate, and transfer WB-cell slurry to a 15 ml tube. These preparations are to be carried out on the bench at room temperature. If cells are strongly adherent and not easily dislodged by gentle up-and-down pipetting, add 0.7 ml of Trypsin (or just enough to evenly cover cells) warmed to 37 °C after washing cells once with 10 ml WB and let stand in a 37 °C incubator for 2-3 min. Remove cells from the incubator. Cells should now be easily displaced by gentle up-and-down pipetting with 10 ml WB. Transfer WB-cell slurry to a 15 ml tube.Gently pellet cells by centrifugation at room temperature at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant.Wash pellet by re-suspending cells in 10 ml WB, spin for 5 min at 1,000 x g, and discard supernatant.Resuspend cells in 2.5 ml recording buffer (RB), also warmed to 37 °C. Transfer 2.0 ml of this slurry to the quartz cuvette with a small stir bar. (The remaining 0.5 ml can be used separately to analyze protein content via Western Blot analysis. See Note 5 for more on Western Blots) Note: Gently flick cuvette to remove bubbles before the start of the experiment, as these can create unwanted noise in the data. Flux experimentPlace cuvette with RB-cell slurry into the cell-holder/stirrer affixed to the spectrophotometer. Turn on a stirrer and stir cells slowly (see Note 1).Set spectrophotometer to these parameters:Excitation wavelength: 506 nmEmission wavelength: 531 nmEm/Ex slit width: 2.5/2.",

Left: cartoon of quartz cuvette with 2 ml recording buffer suspending wild-type (WT) HEK cells, loaded into the stirrer on the fluorescence spectrophotometer (small stir bar not shown). Right: spectrophotometric trace about 45 sec after starting the recording.Add CG-5N to a final concentration of 0.25 nM (i.e., 1 μl of 0.5 μM stock). CG-5N is a membrane impermeable calcium-sensitive fluorophore (Kd = 14 μM). The fluorescence signal will go up with the addition of the fluorophore as trace amounts of calcium are present in the RB. See Figure 2 below. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716010322_2338.jpgFigure 2. Adding CG-5N. Adding CG-5N to a concentration of 0.25 nM (left) will increase the fluorescence signal in the trace profile (right).Add digitonin to a final concentration of 30 μM (i.e., 2 μl of 30 mM stock). Digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane by extracting cholesterol, leaving those intracellular membranes lacking cholesterol (e.g., the mitochondrial inner membrane) intact. This brings mitochondria in direct contact with the buffer solution and susceptible to influence by experimental reagents (the outer mitochondrial membrane is already in a steady-state with the cytoplasm with regards to small molecules like the reagents used in this protocol). CG-5N (membrane-impermeable) is afterward reporting ‘extra-mitochondrial’ calcium levels. A typical dip in fluorescence is almost always observed upon the addition of digitonin, as can be seen in Figure 3 below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716010505_3899.jpgFigure 3. Adding digitonin. Adding digitonin to a concentration of 30 μM (left) will cause the spectrophotometric trace profile to drop (right).Add CaCl2 to a final concentration of 10 μM (i.e., 2 μl of 10mM stock). The fluorescence signal will go up as calcium binds to CG-5N.",
    "If the cells are harboring activated mitochondria containing functional MCU (i.e., WT-HEK cells), a precipitous declination in fluorescence will immediately follow, signifying MCU-mediated calcium uptake (see Figure 4). Note: If cells lack MCU, the fluorescence signal in the trace profile will increase but then will immediately flatten out, showing that the observed declination in the trace profile of WT cells after the addition of calcium is due to MCU-mediated calcium uptake AND NOT by other intra-cellular calcium uptake pathways such as SERCA (Sarco/Endoplasmic Calcium-ATPase) (Note 6). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716010644_2686.jpgFigure 4. Adding calcium. Adding calcium to a final concentration of 10 μM (left) will produce a sharp increase in the trace profile (right). The following drop in fluorescence signal is indicative of MCU-mediated calcium flux.After some time has passed, typically between 30 sec to 1 min, add Ru360 to a final concentration of 0.5 μM. Ru360 (i.e., 0.5 μl of 2 mM stock) is a potent inhibitor of MCU (Kd = 340 pM) and will cause the spectrophotometric trace to flatten as the steady-state exchange between the CG-5N-calcium-bound and CG-5N-calcium unbound species returns due to the lack of calcium mobility away from CG-5N. This step testifies to the dependence of MCU on the removal of calcium from the buffer solution observed in the previous step. See Figure 5 below; here, Ru360 is added to the cuvette after a second shot of 10 μM calcium. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180716/20180716010739_6735.jpgFigure 5. Ru360.
