  "procedures": [
    "1. Retinal Slices Preparation\nAssemble the chamber (design illustrated in Figure 1). Place two beads of vacuum grease, spaced ~8-10 mm apart, across the recording chamber to form a channel for superfusate and in which to embed the retinal slices. Add a second bead of grease a few millimeters farther out beyond each of these two beads of grease to act as a levee and limit spillover. Place a small triangular piece of KimWipe at the end of the chamber to ensure fluid contact with the reference electrode.\nPress a piece of nitrocellulose membrane (~ 5 x 10 mm; 0.8 μm pores) flat against the glass microscope slide into two small beads of vacuum grease. Avoid putting grease directly beneath the center of the nitrocellulose membrane, as this can prevent the retina from adhering.\nTo prepare the tissue slicer, break a double edge razor blade into 4 pieces and attach one to the slicing arm. Cut a thin slice of nitrocellulose membrane to ensure that the cutting edge of the razor blade lays flat against the recording chamber and therefore cuts cleanly through the nitrocellulose membrane.\nKeep a small beaker of amphibian saline solution (Table 1) on ice at the dissection station.\nEuthanize salamander by decapitation. Hemisect the head sagitally and pith through the spinal cord. Place half of the head on a piece of cotton moistened with amphibian saline atop a linoleum block. The other half of the head can be wrapped with a moist paper towel and stored at 4 °C for use later in the day.",
    "Enucleate the eye. Using small Vannas scissors, cut the skin connecting the eye to the surrounding orbit. After freeing the front of the eye from the surrounding orbital tissue, pull the eye forward and slide the scissors under the eye to cut through the eye muscles and optic nerve, freeing the eye from the orbit.\nPlace the enucleated eye on a bed of cotton on the linoleum block. Discard the half head. Trim excess orbital fat from the back of the eye.\nMake a small incision in the center of cornea with a sharp surgical blade. Remove the cornea by sliding fine Vannas scissors into the incision and extending the cut radially out toward the ora serrata. Cut circumferentially around the ora serrata by rotating the linoleum block or the cotton between cuts.\nAfter cutting all the way around the eye, remove the cornea and lens by pulling them out of the side of the eyecup. Move the resulting eyecup onto a hard surface of the linoleum block moistened with amphibian saline solution. Cut it into thirds with a sharp razor blade, using a fine sawing motion to ensure that you have cut all the way through the sclera.\nPlace one or two pieces of eyecup on the nitrocellulose membrane with the retinal surface facing down. Submerge the remaining pieces with additional saline and place them in the refrigerator at ~4 °C.",
    "Gently press the piece of eyecup against the nitrocellulose membrane with fine forceps. Submerge the nitrocellulose membrane and eyecup piece with several drops of cold amphibian saline and blot at the edges with KimWipe to help the retina to adhere. Once again, submerge the eyecup and nitrocellulose membrane with several drops of cold amphibian saline solution and peel away the sclera/choroid/retinal pigment epithelium to isolate the retina (which can appear pink due to the presence of unbleached rhodopsin). If necessary, cut the optic nerve to free the retina.\nIf the retina has not adhered tightly, drain away the saline with a KimWipe to pull the retina more firmly down onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Replace the saline. Repeat, if necessary.\nFill the chamber with cold amphibian saline and transfer it to the stage of the tissue slicer. Slice the retina and nitrocellulose membrane into thin strips, working from one end to the other by turning the vernier micrometer in 125 μm increments. Press the razor blade gently but firmly through the retina and nitrocellulose membrane.\nTransfer the retinal slices by moving strips of nitrocellulose membrane to the main channel of the recording chamber. Lift a strip of membrane free and then hold it in place while moving the chamber beneath it, being sure to keep the slices submerged. Embed the edges of the nitrocellulose membrane in the strips of vacuum grease, rotating them 90 degrees to view the retinal layers.\nPress the nitrocellulose membrane flat against the glass surface. Even if there is not retina on every piece, place strips of nitrocellulose membrane at regular intervals (~1 mm apart) along the entire length of the perfusion channel to help break up the surface tension and improve fluid flow.\n2. Paired Whole-cell Recordings",
    "After all of the slices have been transferred, move the recording chamber to the stage of an upright, fixed stage microscope and attach the reference electrode lead. Focus on the slices using a long-working distance, water immersion, 40-60X objective. The microscope should be placed on an air table to dampen vibrations and enclosed in a Faraday cage to reduce electrical interference.\nSuperfuse the slices continuously at a rate of 1 ml/min with amphibian saline solution bubbled with 100% O2. Connect the suction, making sure that the inflow and outflow are balanced. Outflow can be regulated by rotating the beveled end of the suction needle or by moving the KimWipe at the end of the chamber closer or farther away from the outflow needle. The preparation can be kept at room temperature or cooled with a Peltier device or by simply setting an ice pack on the microscope stage.\nExamine slices under dim or infra-red light and identify a pair of cells - a photoreceptor (rod or cone) and nearby horizontal or bipolar cell - to target for whole-cell recording. Rods can be identified by their large cell bodies and prominent rod-like outer segments (Figure 2A). Cones are smaller than rods and have small tapered outer segments. Bipolar cell and horizontal cell somas are in the outermost row of cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL; Figures 2B and 2C).\nBefore preparing slices, use a pipette puller to manufacture micropipettes from borosilicate glass (1.2 mm outer diameter, 0.95 mm inner diameter with a glass filament). The tip of each micropipette should be ~1-2 microns in diameter.\nUsing a non-metallic filling needle (e.g. one manufactured from a 1 cc syringe or a MicroFil), fill pipettes with the intracellular solution (Table 1) and attach to the electrode holder.",
    "Elevate the microscope objective slightly. Position the photoreceptor pipette beneath the objective and then lower it so that the tip is positioned just above the slices. Repeat with the second pipette.\nAdjust any offset in the baseline current level on the amplifier. Check the pipette resistance with a 5-10 mV depolarizing pulse. We typically use pipettes that range from 10-15 MΩ, the result of the long taper of the shaft and low osmolarity of the amphibian pipette solutions. With higher osmolarity mammalian solutions, these same pipettes exhibit resistance values of ~8-12 MΩ. While we have used larger tip diameters with resistance values of 3-4 MΩ in amphibian solutions, the advantages provided by a lower access resistance are offset by a greater difficulty in sealing onto cell membranes and a more rapid rundown of calcium currents and other second messenger-sensitive responses.\nWhile applying slight positive pressure, position the post-synaptic pipette so that it contacts the horizontal or bipolar cell body. Then position the presynaptic pipette so that it contacts the cell body of a rod or cone photoreceptor. Recordings appear to be more stable when pipette tips contact the inner segment rather than the soma, especially in cones.\nWhile monitoring the resistance, release the positive pressure on the post-synaptic pipette. Sometimes, the release of positive pressure is sufficient to form a gigaohm seal. If not, apply gentle suction with a 1 ml syringe or by mouth. After the tip resistance has grown to > 100 MΩ, apply a holding potential of -60 mV. After obtaining a gigaohm seal, null out any pipette capacitance transients and repeat the sealing procedure for the photoreceptor pipette, applying a holding potential of -70 mV.",
    "Rupture the patch by using your mouth or a syringe to apply suction to each cell in turn. Rods, cones, and bipolar cells will typically rupture with gentle suction. Obtaining whole-cell configuration with a horizontal cell may require greater suction (i.e. with a 3 cc syringe) in combination with strong quick voltage pulses delivered with the \"zap\" feature of the patch clamp amplifier. Rupture of the membrane and establishment of whole-cell configuration will be evident by the appearance of whole-cell capacitance transients.\nConfirm identity of the post-synaptic cell physiologically by applying a light flash and delivering a series of voltage steps from -120 to +40 mV in 20 mV increments (Figures 3 and 4).\nTo assess if the pair of cells are synaptically connected, deliver a brief (25-100 msec), 60 mV step depolarization to the photoreceptor (to -10 mV, near the peak of the L-type voltage-gated calcium current) and look for post-synaptic currents in the second order neuron (Figure 5). A strong depolarizing step should evoke a fast, transient inward post-synaptic current in the post-synaptic horizontal or OFF bipolar cell caused by a burst of vesicle release from the cone (Figure 5)."
