    "-Before starting with this protocol, we recommend reading it completely, especially the Notes section at the end of this article.-Cells should be cultured in medium and growth conditions that are appropriate for the given cell type. To achieve a suitable number of labeled cells during data analysis, they must be in the exponential phase. -Although the thymidine analogs can be toxic when used in high dosages for long periods of incorporation, we did not detect any alterations regarding toxicity in our T. cruzi cell lines during our analysis. -Important: If the antibodies that will be used in this protocol have not been previously tested for specificity, we strongly recommend that Procedure B (controls for checking the specificity of the antibodies) be performed first.Analysis of the DNA exchangeIncubate T. cruzi cells (28 °C) until they reach exponential phase (~1 x 107 cells/ml) in 10 ml of culture. The parasites density varies according to the lineage used. Note: In our assays, we used two different lineages: T. cruzi Y strain (TcII), and T. cruzi CL Brener strain (TcIV), both in epimastigote forms. The exponential phase may vary according to each strain. Split the exponential T. cruzi culture into two culture flasks (25 cm2) adding 5 ml per flask.Thaw both solutions of thymidine analogs CldU-S and IdU-S at room temperature.Add one of the thymidine analogs (e.g., CldU) to a final concentration of 100 μM in one flask, and the other one (e.g., IdU) in the remaining flask, also to a final concentration of 100 μM. Incubate each flask containing the different thymidine analogs for 12 h at 28 °C. Note: The incubation time, as well as the temperature, may vary according to each parasite strain or cell type.",
    "In our protocol, the incubation time (period of thymidine analogs incorporation) was determined empirically after a long period of testing. We managed to get good results using a period corresponding to the half of the doubling time of the lineage used (T. cruzi doubling time is 24 h).  Warm an aliquot of 200 ml of Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium at 28 °C. Note: If it is available, use a water bath. Collect the 5 ml of T. cruzi parasites CldU- or IdU-incorporated by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min (from Step A6). Remove the medium from cells carefully and replace it with 10 ml of LIT at 28 °C.Suspend the pellet carefully and repeat the Steps A7-A8 twice for a total of three washes with LIT. For the last wash, suspend the pellet carefully into 5 ml LIT.Mix the both CldU- and IdU-incorporated T. cruzi cultures into one single flask, totalizing a volume of 10 ml.Incubate for 24 h at 28 °C. Note: The incubation time, as well as the temperature, may vary according to each parasite strain or cell type. Chill the 1x PBS to 4 °C.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and wash twice each using 5 ml of cold 1x PBS.Remove the 1x PBS from cells carefully to preserve the pellet.Suspend the pellet in 1 ml of cold Fixation buffer (FB) and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Incubate at 4 °C for 7 min and wash three times using 5 ml of cold 1x PBS (centrifuging at 800 x g for 5 min in each wash) each. For the last wash, suspend the pellet carefully into 500 μl of 1x PBS. If the pellet is too small (i.e.",
    ", almost invisible to the naked eye), decrease the volume of the last wash to 100 μl of 1x PBS.Prepare the slides to receive the T. cruzi cells by spreading 2.5 μl of Poly-L-lysine solution (PLS) onto slide surface until PLS dry out. Prepare three slides for each sample from Step A15. Note: Use a coverslip to help spreading the PLS onto slide (see Figure 1 for more detail).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181217/20181217003959_2015.jpgFigure 1. Illustration to clarify the Step A17. A coverslip can be used to help to spread out the PLS drop (2.5 μl) onto slides.Spread the suspended-pellet (from Step A16) carefully in each of the three slides. Use 25-30 μl and save the remaining suspended-pellet volume in case you need to remake some slides. Notes: Use the same surface where PLS was previous spread. Each slide is one technical replicate. Wait for the cells to precipitate and settle on slide for 10-15 min at room temperature. Ensure that the cells do not dry out.Permeabilize the cells by adding 50 μl of Permeabilization solution (PS) for 10 min at room temperature.Wash the slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS. Note: Use a P1000 micropipette to spread (by sneezing) 1x PBS (1 ml) onto slide three times. Denature the DNA of the cells by adding 50 μl of Denaturation buffer (DB) for 20 min at room temperature. Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help DB spread out and avoid dry out. Remove the plastic coverslip and wash the slide containing cells once using 1x PBS. Neutralize the reaction by adding 50 μl of Neutralization buffer (NB) for 10 min at room temperature. Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help NB spread out. Remove the plastic coverslip and wash the slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS. Dilute both primary antibodies [i.e.",
    ", rat α-CldU monoclonal antibody (Accurate) and mouse α-IdU monoclonal antibody (BD)] 1:300 in Blocking solution (BS).Spread out 50 μl of the diluted primary antibodies on the slide-surface containing cells (from Step A25). Incubate for 2 h at room temperature.Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help primary antibodies spread out and avoid dry out.  Remove the plastic coverslip and wash the slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS.Dilute both secondary antibodies [i.e., Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat α-mouse (Thermo Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat α-rat (Thermo Scientific)] 1:300 in BS. Note: From this step onwards, do not expose the slides to light. Spread out 50 μl of the diluted secondary antibodies on the slide-surface containing cells (from Step A28). Incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help primary antibodies spread out and avoid dry out. Remove the plastic coverslip and wash the slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS.Ensure remove of all the liquid from the slide surface containing cells and add 4 μl of Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Note: This solution is used as the anti-fade mounting solution and to stain organelles containing DNA. Add a glass coverslip and seal using colorless nail varnish. Wait the varnish dry out for 5 min. The slide can be analyzed under a fluorescence microscope immediately or stored at 4 °C up to one month. Figure 2 shows a scheme containing the main steps of this protocol section.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181217/20181217004022_4477.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram representing the main steps of the application of the protocol for CL Brener and Y strains (epimastigote forms). The halogenated thymidine analogs (CldU and IdU) are added separately in each culture for 12 h. After that, parasites must be washed with fresh media, mixed, and incubated for 24 h.",
    "Then samples must be washed, fixed, and added onto slides. Next, the parasite cells must have their DNA denatured and should be then processed for the detection of the thymidine analogs using primary antibodies (α-CldU and α-IdU) and the corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 α-rat and Alexa Fluor 568 α-mouse). Finally, mounting medium with DAPI must be added and the slides sealed. Controls (checking the specificity of the antibodies)Prepare a new set of T. cruzi culture. Choose one strain if you carried out the previous analysis with two strains. Incubate T. cruzi cells (28 °C) until they reach exponential phase (~1 x 107 cells/ml) in 10 ml of culture. The parasites density varies according to the lineage used. Note: In our assays to check the specificity of the antibodies, we used only the T. cruzi Y strain in epimastigote forms. Follow the Steps A2-A5 exactly as previously described.Chill the 1x PBS to 4 °C. Note: Do not mix both cultures as previously done. After the incubation time, harvest separately the CldU- and IdU-incorporated cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and wash each sample twice using 5 ml of cold 1x PBS.Remove the 1x PBS from each sample carefully and suspend each pellet in 1 ml of cold FB. Transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Incubate each pellet at 4 °C for 7 min and wash them three times using 5 ml of cold 1x PBS (centrifuging at 800 x g for 5 min in each wash). For the last wash, suspend each pellet carefully into 500 μl of 1x PBS. If any of them is too small (i.e., almost invisible to the naked eye), decrease the volume to 100 μl of 1x PBS.",
    "Prepare four slides to receive the CldU-incorporated cells and four to receive the IdU-incorporated (totalizing eight slides). Spread 2.5 μl of PLS in each slide and let PLS dry out. Note: Use a coverslip to help spreading the PLS onto slide. Spread the suspended-pellet from each sample (i.e., CldU- and IdU-incorporated cells) (from Step B7) carefully in the slides (four slides for each thymidine analog group). Use 25 μl and save the remaining suspended-pellet volume in case you need to remake some slides. Note: Use the same surface where PLS was previous spread. Wait for the cells to settle on the slides for 10-15 min at room temperature. Ensure that the cells do not dry out.Permeabilize the cells by adding 50 μl of PS for 10 min at room temperature.Wash each slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS.

Remove the plastic coverslip and wash each slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS. Dilute both primary antibodies [i.e., rat α-CldU monoclonal antibody (Accurate) and mouse α-IdU monoclonal antibody (BD)] individually using two separated microtubes. Dilute each one 1:300 in BS.Spread out 50 μl of the diluted primary antibody rat α-CldU on the surface of two slides containing CldU-incorporated cells (from Step B15) and on the surface of two slides containing IdU-incorporated cells (from Step B15).",
    "Repeat the same procedure for the four remaining slides using the other diluted primary antibody, i.e., mouse α-IdU. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help primary antibodies spread out and avoid dry out.  Remove the plastic coverslip and wash the slide containing cells three times using 1x PBS.Dilute both secondary antibodies [i.e., Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated α-mouse (Thermo Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated α-rat (Thermo Scientific)] individually using two separated microtubes. Dilute each one 1:300 in BS.Note: From this step onwards, do not expose the slides to light. Spread out 50 μl of the diluted secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 α-rat on the surface of the following slides containing cells (from Step B19): CldU-incorporated + primary antibody rat α-CldU, CldU-incorporated + primary antibody mouse α-IdU, IdU-incorporated + primary antibody rat α-CldU, and IdU-incorporated + primary antibody mouse α-IdU. Repeat the same procedure for the four remaining slides (from Step B19) using the other diluted secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 α-mouse, i.e., CldU-incorporated + primary antibody rat α-CldU, CldU-incorporated + primary antibody mouse α-IdU, IdU-incorporated + primary antibody rat α-CldU, and IdU-incorporated + primary antibody mouse α-IdU. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Note: Use a plastic coverslip to help secondary antibodies spread out and avoid dry out.  Remove the plastic coverslip and wash each slide three times using 1x PBS.Ensure removing all the liquid from each and add 4 μl of Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI.

    "Figure 3 shows a scheme containing the main steps of this control protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181217/20181217004042_8475.jpgFigure 3. Schematic diagram representing the main steps of antibodies specificity control. This control assay can be applied to any of the two previously strains (i.e., CL Brener and Y). The halogenated thymidine analogs (CldU and IdU) are added separately in each culture for 12 h. After that, each parasite-group (CldU-incorporated and IdU-incorporated) must be washed with 1x PBS, fixed, and aliquots distributed onto four slides (totalizing eight slides for the both groups). Next, each slide containing parasite cells must have their DNA denatured and should be then processed for the detection of the thymidine analogs using primary and secondary antibodies according to the specifications (on the scheme, see the specifications on the bottom of slides) (for details see previous Step B21). Finally, mounting medium with DAPI must be added in each slide and then sealed."
