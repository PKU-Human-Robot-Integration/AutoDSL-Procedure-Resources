    "1. Protein preparation\nNOTE: The expression and purification of TmPPase has been described elsewhere13.\nPrepare 10 mL of the reactivation buffer solution containing 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 6.5, 3.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.05% dodecyl maltoside (DDM).\nPrepare 10 mL of the reaction mixture containing 200 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 8.0 mM MgCl2, 333 mM KCl, and 67 mM NaCl.\n\tNOTE: Mg2+ is required to chelate the pyrophosphate as the substrate of mPPase, K+ is required to increase the enzyme activity as TmPPase is a potassium dependent mPPase, and Na+ is needed for the enzyme activity during sodium ion translocation by TmPPase.\nPrepare 30 mg/mL liposomes for enzyme reactivation.\n\t\nAdd 10 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 1 mM DTT to 0.3 g of L-α-phosphatidylcholine from soybean to 10 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 1 mM DTT.\nPut the liposome on ice, and sonicate with 1 second pulse interval for 1 minute, pause for 1 minute, and repeat until the solution becomes transparent yellow.\nAliquot the liposomes, freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until used.\nReactivate the enzyme.\n\t\nMix 40 µL of the liposomes solution with 22.5 µL of 20% DDM.\nHeat the mixture at 55 °C for 15 min and allow it to cool to room temperature.\nAdd 36.5 µL of the reactivation buffer solution, mix, and add 1 µL of concentrated protein (13 mg/mL) to make a total concentration of 0.13 mg/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Protein is usually frozen in 10 µL aliquots after purification and thawed on ice before use.\nTake 20 µL of the reactivated enzyme and add to 1,480 µL of the reaction mixture, then mix gently.",
    "NOTE: The addition of the reactivated enzyme to the reaction mixture should be performed just before it is used.\n2. Compound preparation\nDissolve the compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make stock solutions of 25−100 mM in 50−200 µL, based on the availability of the compounds.\n\tNOTE: All compounds used here (Figure 2A) have been published previously9. If the compound solubility is low, the stock concentration can be adjusted accordingly.\nPrepare three different concentrations of each compound in water.\n\tNOTE: The final concentrations in the reaction mixture will be 1, 5, and 50 micromolar or 1, 5, and 20 micromolar for soluble and sparingly soluble compounds, respectively.\n\t\nDilute the stock solution with water to 1 mL in microtubes to give 2 µM, 10 µM and 100 µM for soluble compounds, or alternatively 2 µM, 10 µM and 40 µM for sparingly soluble compounds.\nVortex the compound solution instantly after dilution of the stock solution for proper mixing.\nCheck for compound aggregation using a nephelometer.\n\tNOTE: This was studied as triplicates in three concentrations (1 µM, 5 µM and 20 µM) and normalized to the blank in a 96 well plate.\n\t\nDispense 75 µL of the reaction mixture into each well using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 75 µL of each compound (for the blank, use 75 µL of water instead) and mix by pipetting up and down 5×.\nMeasure each well at 300 V using a microplate nephelometer.\n3. Reagents for the assay preparation\nPrepare the arsenite-citrate solution.\n\t\nWeigh 5 g of sodium arsenite and 5 g of trisodium citrate dihydrate.",
    "CAUTION: Sodium arsenite is toxic, thus use proper protective equipment and handle with special care. As precaution, do not handle before all necessary safety precautions have been read and understood. Handle only in a fume hood in order not to inhale dust/vapors of the compound or its solution(s). If inhaled, move to fresh air and obtain medical attention. Wear appropriate chemical safety goggles, protective gloves and clothing to avoid ingestion and eye/skin contact. If swallowed, call immediately a poison center or doctor/physician. If it gets on the skin or in the eye(s), wash with plenty of water and obtain medical attention.\nDissolve into 100 mL of water.\nAdd 5 mL of glacial acetic acid, mix, and add water to 250 mL.\nStore at room temperature protected from light.\n\t\tNOTE: The solution is stable for more than a year.\nPrepare solution A and solution B.\n\t\nFor solution A, add 10 mL of ice cold 0.5 M HCl to 0.3 g of ascorbic acid. Dissolve the ascorbic acid by vortexing.\nFor solution B, add 1 mL of ice cold water to 70 mg of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and vortex to dissolve.\n\t\tNOTE: Store both solutions on ice until use. For the consistency of the assay result, both solutions can be stored on ice for a maximum of one week.\nPrepare the phosphate (Pi) standard with the concentration of 0 µM, 62.5 µM, 250 µM and 500 µM for calibration.\n\t\nAdd 0 µL, 25 µL, 50 µL, and 100 µL of 5 mM Na2HPO4 dihydrate to four microtubes containing 370 µL of the reaction mixture.\nTop up to 1 mL with water.\n4. Activity assay for one 96 well plate\nNOTE: See Figure 1 for the schematic workflow of the assay.",
    "Add 1 mL of solution B to 10 mL of solution A, mix by vortexing and store the solution on ice.\n\tNOTE: This solution should be transparent and yellow. Keep solution A + B on ice for at least 30 min prior to use. However, use the solution within 3 h as it will go bad after long-term storage.\nAdd 40 µL of 0 µM, 62.5 µM, 250 µM and 500 µM Pi standard to the tube strips in triplicate using a multichannel pipette.\n\tNOTE: The reaction mixture with no Pi added will be used as a blank.\nAdd 25 µL of compound solution to the tube strips using a multichannel pipette.\n\tNOTE: Each compound has three different concentrations in triplicate which is enough for initial estimation of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). For a more accurate IC50 determination, eight different compound concentrations can be used. For the uninhibited enzyme the compound solution is replaced with equal amount of water. As positive controls 2.5 µM, 25 µM, and 250 µM of imidodiphosphate (IDP) sodium salt were used.\nAdd 15 µL of mPPase solution mixture to the tube strips (except to the tubes containing Pi standard) using a multichannel pipette.\nSeal the tube strips with an adhesive sealing sheet. Cut the sealing sheet to separate each tube strip.\nPre-incubate the samples for 5 min at 71 °C. Place the samples on the heating block with 20 s interval between each strip in order to minimize the time consumption during the subsequent steps.\nFor each strip, open the adhesive sealing. Add 10 µL of 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate dibasic using a multichannel pipette and mix by pipetting up and down for 5×. Seal the tube strip again using the same sealing.",
    "NOTE: This step might initially be difficult to accomplish in 20 s; however, it will become easier after some assays.\nIncubate at 71 °C for 5 min.\nPlace the samples on the cooling apparatus with 20 s interval between each strip. Let them cool for 10 min but centrifuge each strip briefly after 5 min of cooling, to decant water drops under the sealing sheet, then put it back to the cooling apparatus and remove the sealing.\n\tNOTE: The cooling apparatus can simply be made by placing a 96 well PCR plate on a polystyrene Petri dish (size 150 mm × 15 mm) filled with water and frozen for at least 1 h. The apparatus should be taken out from the freezer about 5 min prior to the beginning of the assay. Do not take out the cooling apparatus right before sample cooling as it will freeze the reaction mixture and hinder color development.\nAfter 10 min of cooling, add 60 µL of solution A + B, mix by pipetting up and down for 5× and keep the tube strips on the cooling apparatus for 10 min.\nAdd 90 µL of the arsenite-citrate solution and keep at room temperature for at least 30 min to produce a stable blue color.\n\tCAUTION: Due to its toxicity all solutions containing sodium arsenite should be handled with extra care at all time. Thus, the addition of arsenite-citrate solution should be done in a fume hood.\nDispense 180 µL of each reaction mixture into a clear 96 well polystyrene microplate.\nMeasure the absorbance of each well at 860 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer.\n5. Result analysis\nAverage the triplicates of each sample and the Pi standards. Then subtract with the blank to eliminate the background signal.",
    "Make a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance (A860) values against the amount of Pi standard (nmol) and perform a linear regression to obtain the trendline function using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60619/60619equ01a.jpg\nCalculate the phosphate amount (nmol) released from the enzymatic reaction based on the linear regression formula above.\nCalculate the specific activity using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60619/60619equ02a.jpg\n\twhere nPi is the amount of phosphate released from the reaction (nmol), t is the reaction time (min), and mTmPPase is the amount of the pure TmPPase used in the assay (mg).\nCalculate the percent activity for each inhibitor concentration using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60619/60619equ03a.jpg\n\twhere SAi is the specific activity of a sample with inhibitor and SAun is the specific activity of the uninhibited sample.\nCalculate the logIC50 (estimate) and IC50 (estimate) with a nonlinear regression fit from the four-parameter dose-response curve using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60619/60619equ04a.jpg\n\twhere X is log of concentration ( µM), Y is activity (%), Top and Bottom are plateaus in the same unit as Y (100% and 0%, respectively), logIC50 has the same log units as X, and HillSlope = slope factor or hill slope, which is unitless.\n\tNOTE: Software (Table of Materials) is used for the fitting. Use the concentration of 0.01 µM (instead of 0.00 µM) for the sample without inhibitor as the logarithm of zero is not defined.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
