    "A.  Plant growth    Sandpaper the surface of L. japonicus Gifu or MG-20 seeds, and then incubate them in 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min. Wash the seeds several times with sterilized water and incubate the seeds overnight in the sterilized water.   Surface-sterilized L. japonicus Gifu or MG-20 seeds are germinated and grown in the germination plate.    Place the plate vertically in a growth cabinet (Gifu; 23 °C 24 h dark for first 3 days, 23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark for next 2 days, MG-20; 23 °C 24 h dark for first 2 days, 23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark for next 2 days). Incubation time in the darkness is depends on ecotypes (hypocotyl growth speed of Gifu is slower than MG-20).     B. Culture of Agrobacterium   Streak A. tumefaciens harboring the desired construct on LB plate with appropriate antibodies for 2 days at 28 °C, then spread bacteria all around sterilized dish (9 cm in diameter) and incubate for 1 day. We use AGL1 as agrobacteria strain.    C. Infection of A. rhizogenes with L. japonicus    Put about 5 mm piles of sterilized filter papers (6 x 6 cm) in a new dish and pour 20-25 ml co-cultivation medium (Figure 1A). Pouring the medium to the bottom of a dish and then it gradually permeates to the top of pilled filter papers. It enables us to recognize the saturation of filter papers with the medium.   Collect the bacteria with bacteria spreader from LB plate and suspend 5 ml YMB medium.   Put a sterilized filter paper (7-8 cm in diameter) in a new dish and saturate it with bacterial suspension by pipetting.   Place the juvenile plants on the filter paper and cut their hypocotyls into about 3 mm length with surgical knife.",
    "Transfer the hypocotyl pieces onto the top of pilled filter papers saturated with co-cultivation medium and place the plate in a growth cabinet (23 °C 24 h dark) for 6 days (Figure 1B).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613074849_2810.jpg    Figure 1. Infection of A. tumefaciens with L. japonicas      D. Callus induction    Transfer the hypocotyl pieces from co-cultivation medium onto callus medium (about 1 cm thick) and place the plate in a growth cabinet (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark) for 2-5 weeks (Figure 2A). Transfer the hypocotyl pieces onto new medium every 5 days.   In 2-3 weeks, calluses should start to develop from the tips of hypocotyls. When they become more than 1 mm in size, cut off them from the hypocotyls and transfer them onto new medium (Figure 2B). You can trash white hypocotyls as it is unlikely that calluses develop from them.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613074905_4738.jpg    Figure 2. Callus induction     E.  Shoot induction   Transfer the calluses onto callus medium without hygromycin B (about 1 cm thick) and place the plate in a growth cabinet (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark) for no longer than 7 weeks. Transfer the calluses onto new medium every 5 days (Figure 3). Shoots start to appear in about 3 weeks.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613074928_1095.jpg Figure 3. Shoot induction     F.Shoot elongation   When shoots start to appear, transfer the calluses onto shoot elongation medium (about 1 cm thick) and place the plate in a growth cabinet (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark) for no longer than 6 weeks. Transfer the calluses onto new medium every 5 days (Figure 4).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613075033_1460.jpg Figure 4. Shoot elongation     G.Root induction   1.When shoots become about 1 cm in length, cut off the shoots from the calluses and stick them shallowly into root induction medium (about 1 cm thick). 2.",
    "Place the plate in a growth cabinet (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark) for 10 days (Figure 5).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613075058_1694.jpg Figure 5. Root induction     H.Root elongation   Transfer and stick the shoots into root elongation medium (about 3 cm thick) and place the magenta box in a growth cabinet (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark) until their root length become about 2-3 cm (Figure 6).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130613/20130613075118_4651.jpg Figure 6. Root elongation     I.Naturalization   Transplant the plants into 100% vermiculite and grow them with high humidity at least first 1 week (23 °C 16 h light/8 h dark), and keep growing them for further analysis. To keep high humidity, we cover the pots of plants with Saran wrap."
