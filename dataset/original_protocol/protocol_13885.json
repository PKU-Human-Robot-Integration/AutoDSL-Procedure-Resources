    "This protocol was approved by the Leiden University Medical Center Ethics committee, and postnatal examination of human monochorionic twin placentas is a part of standard care at the Leiden University Medical Center. The acquisition of consent for postnatal examination of human monochorionic twin placentas is waived at the Leiden University Medical Center.\n1. TAPS placenta collection and gross examination\nUse all human monochorionic twin placentas with TAPS delivered at any gestational age. Keep the human monochorionic twin placenta as intact as possible. Deliver the monochorionic placenta as gently as possible, if manual removal is necessary.\n\tNOTE: After birth, midwives or neonatologists should transfer TAPS placentas into a plastic box and then to the laboratory.\nWhen the first infant is delivered, use one clamp to clamp the umbilical cord to mark the birth order as first. When the other infant is delivered, use two clamps to clamp the umbilical cord to mark the birth order as second.\nExamine the placenta macroscopically, including placenta intactness, types of umbilical cord insertions, number of umbilical vessels, and gross examination of the dividing membrane to confirm the chorionicity. Collect the inter-twin membrane for pathological diagnosis of monochorionicity. The diameter of TAPS placentas is dependent on gestational age.\n\tNOTE: Examination should be performed within 1 week after delivery to avoid the formation of adhesive blood clots on maternal side.\nKeep the placenta refrigerated (1–4 °C) in a dry, plastic box until examination, if needed.\n2. Preparation of the placental maternal side\nTrim the amniotic membrane along the placental edge using scissors. Pay attention to the vessels on the membrane and if the velamentous cord insertion is present to prevent blood from flowing out of the placental mass.",
    "NOTE: In velamentous cord insertion, vessels from the umbilical cord move to the surface of the amniotic membrane for some distance before attaching to the placental mass. If the “naked” vessels are cut, the blood from placental mass may flow out and make a mess.\nRemove blood clots carefully to prevent damage to the placental lobes.\nOrganize the placental lobes on the maternal side to eliminate the gap between lobes. Placentas usually have around 15 lobes and can be identified on the maternal side.\n3. Preparation for documentation\nPlace the placenta on a plastic panel with the maternal side facing upwards.\nExpose the maternal side of the placenta to light (uniform distribution using two identical lamps on the left and right sides). Use lamps that have a function for adjusting light intensity.\nTo reduce reflection, take digital photos with a camera (Table of Materials) in mild light conditions and avoid direct exposure to the light source.\nTake photos perpendicular to the maternal side of placenta.\n4. Computerized measurement using ImageJ\nOpen ImageJ on the computer by clicking on the software icon.\nClick on “File”, then “Open” to open the placental picture. Once the required image is opened, click on “Image” | “Color”, then “Channels Tool” to choose the “Color” from the drop list.\n\tNOTE: The software can automatically identify the color of the object measured. The placenta is red. In the software, after clicking “Color”, the placental picture will automatically be converted into a red spectrum channel.\nClick on “Freehand selections” to respectively contour the plethoric and pale placental share of the polycythemic and anemic twins via visual inspection of different color intensity of the maternal side of the placenta.",
    "Click on “Analyze” | “Histogram”. Obtain the color intensity histogram after selecting the plethoric area or pale area, respectively. The mode displayed in the intensity histogram represents the color that is most present in the placental area selected.\nCalculate the color difference ratio by dividing the mode of color intensity of the anemic twin by the mode of color intensity of the polycythemic twin.\nSubscription Required.
