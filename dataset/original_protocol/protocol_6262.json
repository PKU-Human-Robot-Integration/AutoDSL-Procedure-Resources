    "Leishmania promastigote axenic cultureL. donovani, L. major or L. infantum promastigotes grow as suspension cells in axenic (in vitro cultures). When starting from a frozen vial, thaw the cells quickly by immersing the vial in a beaker with water at 25 °C, transfer with a sterile 1 ml pippete in a falcon tube with 9 ml culture medium- [RPMI 1640-GlutaMax, supplemented with 10% (v/v) hiFBS, 40 mM HEPES and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin at 1x dilution (100 U/ml)], resuspend and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 7 min at RT.Remove the S/N, resuspend in 10 ml culture medium and transfer into a 25 cm2 flask, close cap (without filter).Culture at 25 °C in the absence of CO2 as described previously (Papadaki et al., 2015).Parasite subculturing is performed at 106 parasites/ml and at the 6th-7th day of culture the parasite density is ~2 x 107-2.5 x 107 parasites/ml. Parasite harvesting is performed by centrifugation (1,000 x g, 7 min at RT). Parasites can be cultured for up to 10 passages and then a new culture should be started from a vial with frozen cells. Culture L. tarentolae promastigotes at 25 °C in Brain Heart Infusion (Lexsy Broth BHI) medium supplemented with hemin (5 μg/ml) at a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v), 10 μM L-biopterin and penicillin-streptomycin (1x).Genetically modified parasites are cultured in similar conditions with the parental strains but with addition of Nourseothricin (100 μg/ml) when the genetic modification was performed with plasmids based on the pLEXSY-sat2 vector.For parasite maintenance, L. donovani strains(107 cells) are subcultured once a week by removing 9 ml of the old culture and complementing with 9 ml of fresh medium (1/10 dilution).",
    "For cell countingemove a small volume of the culture (100 μl) for counting the cells with a hemocytometer (Malassez) and transfer it into an Eppendorf tube containing 900 μl 2% (w/v) formalin, at RT.Wait for 2-3 min.Take 100 μl and place in one chamber of the hemocytometer.Note: For use of hemocytometer, you can look at videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWS9sZbGj6A[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWS9sZbGj6A]. Observe under the microscope with a 40x magnification lens.For counting cells in the Mallassez hemocytometer, see image (Figure 1), below for a representation of the mallassez chamber. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928084552_7172.jpgFigure 1. Graphical representation of the Mallassez hemocytometer chamber. Count the cells in several or in all the large squares (each square has an area of 0.05 mm2 and 0.2 mm depth representing a volume of 0.01 mm3 = 10-5 ml). Divide the number of cells counted by the number of squares observed and multiply by 105/ml. Then multiply with the dilution factor (in this case by 10). If the parasite culture is less dense, dilute in a smaller volume of formalin before counting.Protocol of assaying acid ecto-phosphatase in live Leishmania promastigotesThe acid ecto-phosphatase activity at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes, is assayed at 25 °C or 37 °C for 30 min with the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (10 mM) in a 90 mM citrate buffer at pH 4.8 (Sigma-Aldrich), with or without sodium tartrate (5 mM , L(+)-tartaric acid; Merck). Hydrolysis of the esteric bond and dephosphorylation of pNPP produces the p-nitro-phenol compound which after terminating the reaction by the addition of 0.5 Ν NaOH is quantified by measuring its absorbance at 405 nm (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928084615_3282.jpgFigure 2. Diagram of the enzymatic reaction of dephosphorylation of the pNPP substrate.",
    "The acid ecto-phosphatase reaction at the surface of live Leishmania promastigotes can be carried out either at the logarithmic phase of growth (48-72 h post inoculation of the culture) or at the static phase of growth (6th or 7th day post-inoculation).Harvest Leishmania promastigotes (1-2 x 107) by centrifugation (1,000 x g, 7 min, RT).Resuspend the cell pellet with 5 ml 100 mM HEPES solution and wash twice with the same buffer.Count cells (as in step 11, A) and assess cell viability by visual inspection under the microscope of the parasite motility (dispense 50 μl of cell suspension on a microscope slide and observe with a 4x lens) and quantitation by staining with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue (i.e., as in Trypan Blue Staining[href=https://www.creative-bioarray.com/support/trypan-blue-staining-assay.htm] protocol). Counting and cell viability could be performed simultaneously.Centrifuge the large volume of the cell suspension (1,000 x g, 7 min).Discard the supernatant (S/N). Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μl reaction solution containing the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mM pNPP in a 90 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.8), with or without sodium tartrate 5 mM L(+)-tartaric acid prewarmed in the appropriate temperature of the reaction (25 °C or at 37 °C).Incubate cells in the reaction mixture at 25 °C or 37 °C for 30 min. Terminate the reaction by the addition of 0.5 N NaOH (1 ml/ sample).Remove the parasites by centrifugation (2,000 x g, 5 min). Transfer the S/N in a plastic cuvette for spectrophotometric analysis.Measure the absorbance of the reaction product (p-nitrophenolate = pNP) at 405 nm.Calculate the enzyme activity (A405 values) and normalize for the mean number of cells/ml for each independent experiment (A405/107 cells/ml).",
    "Evaluate the acid phosphatase activity due to cell lysis under the reaction conditions as follows: Incubate reaction buffer, equal volume to the phosphatase assay for each cell type, with the same number of Leishmania promastigotes used for each reaction, in the absence of substrate for 30 min, at 25 °C or 37 °C depending on the temperature you are performing the reaction.Recover the S/N after centrifuging down the cells (2,000 x g, 5 min).Add 10 mM pNPP.Incubate for 30 min. Measure acid phosphatase activity as described above. Access cell viability as described in Step B2."
