    "This protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the University of Cambridge.\n1. Animal Maintenance\nFrog embryos\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be raised and maintained according to the animal and laboratory facility. Here, an example of the animal maintenance is described.\n\t\nPrepare 0.1x Modified Barth's Solution (MBS) solution: 0.88 mM NaCl, 10 µM KCl, 24 µM NaHCO3, 100 µM HEPES, 8.2 µM MgSO4, 3.3 µM Ca(NO3)2, and 4.1 µM CaCl2, pH 7.6.\nObtain Xenopus laevis embryos by in vitro fertilization.\n\t\t\nInduce ovulation in adult female African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) by injection with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin one week (60 IU) and 12 h (500 IU) prior to egg laying.\nCollect oocytes and fertilize them in vitro with homogenized male testis.\nRaise embryos in 0.1x MBS at 16 - 18 °C. Stage the embryos according to the Normal table of Xenopus laevis14. Take care in selecting whole and alive embryos for the experiment.\nZebrafish embryos\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be raised and maintained according to the animal and laboratory facility. Here, an example of the animal maintenance is described.\n\t\nPrepare embryo medium: 5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, and 0.00001% methylene blue.\nMaintain and breed WT AB strain Danio rerio at 26.5 °C.\nCollect the embryos on the morning of fertilization, raise until 4 d post fertilization (dpf) at 28 °C in embryo medium prepared as described above, select and stage as previously described15.\n2. Induction of Hypoxia In Vivo\nConstruction of the gas incubation chamber\nUse a breeding aquatic tank (Figure 1A) that is normally used in the fish facility for hypoxic chamber construction. This tank should fit a 24-well plate.",
    "Prepare a mesh-bottom 24-well plate as depicted in Figure 1. Remove the plastic bottom of the 24-well plate (Figure 1B), e.g., by using a milling machine for this purpose.\nFill in the space between the plastic of the wells and the walls of the plate with epoxy resin. Attach any nylon filter (Figure 1C) with a mesh diameter of 0.1-0.2 mm to the resin-coated plastic and allow the plate to be completely dry.\nOnce dry, drill three or four tunnels (Figure 1D) of 10 mm length and 5 mm diameter into the resin- and mesh-coated plate walls. Attach plastic or Teflon rods (Figure 1E) of appropriate diameter and 30 mm length to the tunnels and place the plate into the tank of choice.\nPlace the mesh-bottom 24-well plate into the aquatic tank of choice. Using silicone tubing (Figure 1F), attach a gas tank (Figure 1G) with the desired O2/N2 mixture or another gas mixture of choice to a distributor valve (Figure 1H) using an appropriate gas regulator (I) (BOC 200 bar). Here, use gas tanks containing a mixture of 5% oxygen and 95% N2 in the hypoxia experiments presented here.\nAdjust the oxygen flow rate in the chamber medium to 0.0017-0.0019 cubic meters per second. Under this gas flow rate, no disturbance of the medium should be seen in the wells of the plate.\n\t\t\nUse the high purity two-stage gas regulator for this purpose. Set the regulator to reduce the inner pressure of the gas tank (1000 - 2500 PSI) to a delivery pressure of 10 PSI throughout the experiment. Thus, in accordance with the specifications of this gas regulator, a flow rate of 0.00189 cubic meters per second was achieved throughout the experiment.",
    "Connect the silicone tubing and the distributor valve to a ceramic disc diffuser (Figure 1J) inside the aquatic tank. Close the aquatic tank and carefully seal the lid, coating it with silicone grease (Figure 1K) (compare with the Figure 1). If a particular non-room temperature is required, place the hypoxic chamber into a laboratory incubator of required temperature.\nDepending on the type of embryos used in the experiment, fill the hypoxic chamber tank with the appropriate embryo medium and start diffusing the gas mixture through the ceramic disc diffuser. Equilibrate for 10-15 min.\nAfter equilibration with the desired oxygen mixture, measure oxygen concentration in the water using an oxymeter or oxygen probe. Here, use an oxymeter with the fiber-optic dissolved oxygen and temperature sensor for this purpose.\nInduction of hypoxia in embryos\nCarefully select the embryos for the experiment, use whole and alive embryos for the hypoxia incubation. Here, us frog embryos of stage 38 or zebrafish embryos 4 dpf in the experiments presented here.\nPlace the embryo dishes into the incubator (Figure 1K) containing the gas incubation chamber and let them equilibrate to the temperature of the incubator.\nCarefully transfer the embryos into the wells of the meshed 24-well plate (Figure 1B) of the gas incubation chamber, using a plastic pipette. Always use a plastic pipette for embryo transfer throughout the protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: Each well of this plate can contain up to 5 frog embryos of stage 38 or up to 7 zebrafish embryos of 4 dpf. Label the wells carefully if using different genotypes.\nMaintain the gas incubation chamber under a constant infusion with the gas mixture of choice for 5 h or for a longer time that suits the experiment. Use a mixture of 5% O2 and 95% N2 here.",
    "Carefully transfer the embryos from the gas incubation chamber back to the normoxic medium corresponding to the embryo type and immediately proceed with the Steps 3 or 4.\nIf a further normoxic treatment is required, carefully transfer the embryos back to the normoxic medium corresponding to the embryo type.\n3.

Pre-equilibrate the solution with the same gas mixture used in the experiment for 15 min prior to the experiment. Note that the volume of the incubation solution can be minimized by attaching shorter rods (Figure 1E) to the mesh-bottom plate.\nConnect the gas tubing to the gas cylinder containing a gas mixture of 5% O2 and 95% N2.
