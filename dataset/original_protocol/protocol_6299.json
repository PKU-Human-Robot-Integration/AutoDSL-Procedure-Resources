    "EV isolationNote: EVs were isolated from whole urine using Total Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.  Urine samples (1,000 μl) were centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cells and debris.Urine supernatants (800 μl) were mixed with 1 volume (800 μl) of the Total Exosome Isolation reagent and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.Other samples (Plasma, serum, cell culture media) can be prepared similarly using the manufacturer’s recommendations for reagent volume, incubation time, and temperature.After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed using 1 ml pipettor and discarded.Pelleted exosomes were resuspended in 50 μl EV buffer (2 mol/L sucrose and 500 mmol/L MES [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid] solution).Store at -80 °C. Samples are considered to be stable for at least 6 months (Mendt et al., 2018).EV staining and antibody labelingStart up and Calibrate FlowSight.Thaw samples on ice.Prepare 5 mM solution of Tag-It VioletTM by adding 50 μl DMSO to one tube of Tag-It VioletTM as in the Recipe 2 Tag-It Violet marks the EV by binding to the interior proteins, thus labeling the EVs, which are too small for brightfield visualization. Pipet 20 μl EVs using 20 μl pipettor into 1.5 ml opaque Black microcentrifuge tubes, to protect samples from light. The incubated vortexer has a clear lid and is often located in the main laboratory, thus the black tubes protect the fluorescent dyes from photobleaching during the incubations.Include one sample of EVs that will be stained only with Tag-It Violet for single color compensation control.Add 30 μl dPBS to each sample using a 100 μl pipettor.Add 0.5 μl of 5 mM TIV stock to EVs (50 μM final concentration) using a 2 μl pipettor.",
    "Incubate EV for 2 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm using MultiTherm incubated vortexer. Add antibodies (for example peritubular capillary identification) using a 10 μl pipettor.3 μl PL-VAP(LSBio)4 μl CD31 (Biolegend)3 μl CD144 (Biolegend) Incubate for 1 h at RT at 250 rpm in MultiTherm incubated vortexer.Data acquisition using FlowSightAcquisition is performed using FlowSight Imaging Flow Cytometer (Amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA) equipped with Amnis INSPIRE` software. Vortex sample for 10-20 s before loading onto FlowSight.Instrument setup:Lasers (all set to full power):405 nm 100 mW488 nm 60 mW642 nm 100 mW785 nm (SSC) 70 mWAcquire at least 100,000 TIV positive events.Prepare single color control compensation beads for antibodies.In 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes add 1 drop AbC capture beads.Add one antibody per tube with volume indicated in Step B8.Incubate at Room Temp for 15 min protected from light.After adding 1 ml dPBS, vortex and spin at 250 x g for 5 min using a 1000 μl pipettor.Remove supernatant.Add one drop AbC negative beads and 50 μl dPBS.Vortex and run on FlowSight.Acquire 1000 events with Brightfield off (for compensation).Acquire 1000-5000 events with Brightfield on to aid in initial gate determination.Samples are run in the following order.TIV only EVsAcquire 1000 events with Brightfield off (for compensation).Acquire 1000-5000 events with Brightfield on to aid in initial gate determination.Antibody single color controls (acquired as in Step C5g above)Samples with TIV and all antibodies (Brightfield is on)"
