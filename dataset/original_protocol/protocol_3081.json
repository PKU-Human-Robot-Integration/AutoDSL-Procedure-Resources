    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nEstablishment of Adherent Cell Layer\nTiming: 5–7 days\nThis step involves adherent feeder layer formation for subsequent co-culture with HSPCs over a period of 5 weeks\nCulture of OP9 cells\nPurchase parental OP9 cells from ATCC. Maintain these cells in DMEM media with supplements as mentioned below.\nCritical: It is essential to maintain the cells at 70% confluency for two to three passages in T-25 cm2 flasks at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity prior to seeding for adherent layer formation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/284-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Working Model of Long-Term Co-culture of MSCs and HSPCs and Clonogenic Assay\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_284_3.csv\nRemove culture media carefully without disrupting the cellular layer.\nWash the cellular layer with 1× PBS.\nTrypsinize the cells using 500 μL of 0.05% Trypsin containing 0.05% EDTA for 2–3 min at 37°C. Observe the flask under microscope to check that the cells have detached. Gently tap the flask incase still there are attached cells in the flask. Add equal volume of OP9 culture media after trypsinization for neutralization. Collect the cell suspension in fresh 15 mL tubes.\nPellet down the cells at 125 × g for 5 min at 25°C–30°C.\nResuspend cells in 5 mL of fresh culture media.\nCount viable cells using trypan blue and hemocytometer. Mix 10 μL of trypan blue to 10 μL of media containing cells in suspension. Mix carefully and add 10 μL of the mix to hemocytometer for counting trypan blue negative (live) cells using an inverted microscope.\nViable cell count is essential to support the HSPCs for a period of 5 weeks\nReseed unused cells for subsequent use or cryopreserve\nSeed cells in poly-L-Lysine coated wells for formation of feeder layer",
    "Pre-coat the TC 96-wells by adding 100 μL of 0.01% poly-L-Lysine for 2 h at 25°C–30°C.\nRemove poly-L-lysine completely as residual amount can become toxic for the cells.\nEnsure the wells are dry before seeding the cells for adherent layer formation.\nCount the number of viable OP9 cells (1f) and seed at a density of 2.5 × 10−3/cm2 per well in 200 μL of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, Pen-Strep (1×) and L-glutamine (1×) per well so that the cells reach confluency of 100% in 5–7 days.\nFor seeding cells in a 96-well plate, use the inner 60 wells and avoid the peripheral 36 wells.\nAdd sterile water or PBS to the unused peripheral 36 wells in order to maintain humidity and preventing evaporation from the wells containing media.\nHemi deplete (half media change) after 3 days when the media color partially changes to yellow and cells are 50% confluent.\nNote: Adding excess fresh media can lead to over proliferation and detachment of the monolayer. It is essential to maintain the stromal cells as a monolayer, and hemi-depletion helps to maintain an even monolayer. An even, adherent cell monolayer also prevents HSPCs from migrating and adhering to the culture surface of the wells.",
    "Note: Using OP9 cells as stromal support usually does not require the irradiation process. However, use of primary MSCs or FBMD-1 stromal cell line may require further irradiation in order to prevent excessive growth of stroma causing withdrawal of the stromal sheet from the well periphery. Irradiation process commonly involves subjecting nearly confluent stromal layers to 20 Gy radiation using a 137Cs or 60Co γ source. Replace the culture media one day after irradiation with IMDM media containing hydrocortisone and 20% horse serum. Alternatively use Mitomycin C to inhibit excessive growth of the adherent cell layer for long-term culture assays (Ponchio et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nIsolate HSPCs once the adherent layer is ready around day 6.\nCritical: Start a fresh experiment if the adherent OP9 layer is not 100% confluent at the end of 7 days. There are many reasons for this: 1. It indicates that cells are not sufficiently healthy; 2. Cells with lower confluency will not be able to support the HSPCs for 5 weeks; 3. If there are empty spaces without the adherent stromal layer, HSPCs will tend to adhere to the TC surface.\nNote: Viable cell count at the time of seeding can ensure healthy status of the cells. Live cells will proliferate easily and reach the desired confluency in the stipulated time frame. Essentially this reflects the growth kinetics of OP9 cells (sh-Control) that we have recently reported (Sinha et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Toksoz et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Primary MSCs or FBMD-1 cell line may take longer to reach full confluency.",
    "Critical: If it takes more than 14 days to reach 100% confluency, we do not advise using these cells for the assays. It is not advisable to keep the cells in culture for more than 7 days (for OP9) and 14 days (for primary MSCs and FBMD-1), without co-culturing once the confluent adherent monolayer is formed.\nIsolation of CD34+ HSPCs\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThis step describes processing of fresh umbilical cord blood samples to obtain mononuclear cells and subsequent enrichment of HSPCs. Collect cord blood samples from term pregnancies after informed consent and strictly following human ethics committee guidelines. In the clinical setting the umbilical cord is clamped, wiped with antiseptic, and needle inserted into the vein to withdraw the desired volume of blood. Typically one term pregnancy will help collect about 50 mL of cord blood specimen. With fresh samples, perform density gradient centrifugation and HSPC enrichment on the same day. Otherwise thaw cryopreserved samples for HSPC isolation. Isolate HSPCs one day prior to seeding for the co-culture as they may require 12–16 h pre-stimulation with of recombinant SCF, FLT3L and TPO (10 ng/mL each).\nIsolation of mononuclear cells from cord blood samples\nGently layer 25 mL of undiluted cord blood sample on top of 25 mL of Lymphoprep or Ficoll (1.077 g/mL) to form the density gradient (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/284-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Density Gradient Centrifugation and Viable Cell Counting Analysis\nImage showing (A) cord blood density gradient centrifugation and (B) cell counting of mononuclear cells.\nThus, for a 50 mL cord blood unit, evenly distribute the sample into two 50 mL centrifugation tubes to perform the density gradient.",
    "Perform density gradient centrifugation at 400 × g using a horizontal rotor, for 30 min at 25°C–30°C, with an acceleration set at 9 and deceleration at 0. This usually takes around 1.5 h.\nAfter the centrifugation carefully collect the mononuclear cells that forms a white ring between the Lymphoprep layer and the plasma using a serological pipette without disturbing the gradient (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). RBCs should have accumulated at the bottom of the tube.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S1.\nDensity Gradient Centrifugation, Related to Step 5d\nRepeat the density gradient centrifugation once more for a total of two times to sufficiently remove RBC contaminants.\nWash the mononuclear cells with 40 mL of PBS at 500 × g for 5 min at 25°C–30°C to remove residual amount of Lymphoprep.\nTake viable cell counts using trypan blue and hemocytometer. Mix 10 μL of trypan blue to 10 μL of PBS containing cells in suspension in a separate microcentrifuge tube. Mix rapidly and add 10 μL of the mix to hemocytometer for cell counting using an inverted microscope (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Live cells should appear as trypan blue negative (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S2.\nCounting of Trypan Blue Negative Hematopoietic Cells Using a Hemotocytometer, Related to Step 5g",
    "Proceed with isolation of CD34+ cells or immediately freeze the mononuclear cells. Cryopreserve cells in multiple vials using a cryogenic solution containing 90% FBS and 10% DMSO as the final concentration. Do not freeze more than 10–15 × 106 cells per vial. At the beginning resuspend the cell pellets in 100% FBS, total resuspension volume will depend on the number of vials to be used for freezing in accordance with the total number of mononuclear cells obtained from the sample. For each 1.8 mL cryogenic vial add 500 μL of cell suspension, and on the top add 500 μL freezing solution containing 20% DMSO and mix gently. Immediately store the cryogenic vials, placed within a freezing container, at −80°C. The freezing containers carrying 100% isopropyl alcohol ensure achieve a rate of cooling near −1°C/min, which is the optimal rate for cell preservation. For long-term storage transfer the vials into liquid nitrogen containers in another 24–48 h.\nFor using cryopreserved specimens for isolation of HSPCs, thaw the cells in sufficient quantity (use at least 10–20 mL per vial) of complete media (IMDM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine). Ensure that the cells do not form clump during the process by rapidly adding of the sample to complete media with gentle tapping at 25°C–30°C. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 25°C–30°C, aspirate out the media containing DMSO, and wash twice with 50 mL of PBS. Finally resuspend the cells in 1 mL PBS, remove cell clumps if any by passing the cell suspension through a 70 μm filter, and take viable cell count before proceeding for immunomagnetic selection. We did not use DNase to avoid clumping.",
    "Alternatives: Remove RBC contamination by performing RBC lysis after completion of first density gradient centrifugation. Resuspend mononuclear cells in 25 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer and incubate at 25°C–30°C for 5 min to a maximum of 10 min. After the incubation, top up the tube with sufficient volume of PBS and centrifuge cells at 800 × g for 10 min at 25°C–30°C. Wash the cells with PBS to remove residual volume of RBC lysis buffer. Take viable cell counts. Cryopreserve mononuclear cells or immediately proceed for CD34+ cell isolation. Alternatively, perform a second round of density gradient centrifugation. Performing two consecutive rounds of density gradient centrifugation can be a better method to obtain good quality of cells.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_284_4.csv\nFilter and store at 4°C for up to 6 months, and warm before use. The pH of the buffer should be between 7.1 and 7.4.\nIsolation of CD34+ cells\nResuspend the mononuclear cells in 500 μL of EasySepTM buffer or the recommended media (PBS containing 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA). Medium should be free of Ca2+and Mg2+.\nIsolate CD34+ cells using Column-free human CD34 progenitor isolation kit.\nAdd CD34+ selection cocktail from Column-Free Human CD34 Positive Selection Kit (for cord blood) to the cell suspension at a concentration of 100 μL/mL.\nMix and incubate at 25°C–30°C for 15 min.\nMix magnetic particles thoroughly to obtain even distribution by pipetting up and down at least five times.\nAdd magnetic particles at a concentration of 50 μL/mL of sample.\nIncubate at 25°C–30°C for 10 min.\nAdd EasySepTM buffer or the recommended media to the tube up to 2.5 mL and mix thoroughly 2–3 times. Use either EasySepTM buffer or recommended media for the process.\nPlace the tube in the magnet and incubate for 5 min.",
    "Pick up the magnet and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube to discard the supernatant. Leave the tube in inverted position for an additional 2–3 s. Do not shake of the drops adhered to the side walls of the tube. This might lead to loss of enriched cells (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S3.\nImmunomagnetic Selection of CD34+ HSPCs, Related to Step 6j\nRepeat steps (h) to(j) for a total of five times.\nRemove the tube from the magnet. This contains isolated CD34+ cells.\nTop up with 4 mL of recommended media (defined in 5a as per manufacturer’s instruction) and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 25°C–30°C, keeping acceleration 9 and deceleration 0.\nResuspend the cell pellet in IMDM media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nPre-stimulate cells 12–16 h with 10 ng/mL of each of recombinant human SCF, FLT3L and TPO in IMDM complete media (supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine). We usually pre-stimulate cord blood-derived CD34+ cells prior to in vitro co-culture experiments. However, we avoid pre-stimulation for gene expression analysis of CD34+ cells. Absolute number of viable cells does not significantly change after 10–12 h of pre-stimulation.\nCo-culture assay set up\nTake viable cell counts immediately after immunomagnetic separation and also after over-night pre-stimulation. Absolute number of viable cells does not significantly change after 10–12 h of pre-stimulation.\nEnsure that the adherent cell layer is 100% confluent.",
    "Seed 25 × 103 CD34+ cells per well over the stromal monolayer in 200 μL of IMDM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, β-mercaptoethanol, 5% horse serum, 10−5 M hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (co-culture media), and co-culture at 37°C in presence of 5% CO2 for 5 weeks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/284-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Co-culture and Clonogenic Assay Setup\nPhotomicrograph images for (A) HSPCs in co-culture with OP9 monolayer and (B) clonogenic assay setup.\nAdd PBS or sterile water to the peripheral wells to prevent evaporation of media and maintain humidity.\nCheck plate every three days under the microscope to ensure that cells appear healthy and enough volume of media is present in all the wells.\nReplenish one half of the co-culture media (100 μL) every week without disturbing the adherent feeder layer and the HSPCs. Collect media from the wells in microfuge tubes, spin down at 500 × g for 5 min at 25°C–30°C to avoid loss of HSPCs during media change. Resuspend in 100 μL of fresh co-culture media and gently add back to the wells, so that each well has a total of 200 μL of co-culture media.\nHarvest cells for clonogenic assay\nRemove media and add to fresh microfuge tubes as this media can contain non-adherent hematopoietic cells.\nRinse each well with PBS and add this PBS to the tubes containing media previously removed from the wells. Collect PBS that is used to rinse the wells as it might contain hematopoietic cells.\nTrypsinize the wells with 100 μL of 0.05% trypsin containing 0.05% EDTA per well for 3–5 min at 37°C. Check the wells under microscope to ensure that the adherent layer has started to detach from the surface.",
    "Stop trypsinization by addition of 100 μL of IMDM supplemented with 20% heat inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nCollect the cell suspension in tubes which already contain media and PBS collected from the wells prior to trypsinization and spin down at 500 × g, for 7–10 min at 25°C–30°C.\nRemove the media.\nWash with PBS and spin at 500 × g, for 7–10 min at 25°C–30°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of basal IMDM media.\nMeanwhile thaw MethoCult and aliquot 3 mL in 14 mL round bottom tubes.\nAdd 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine to each tube containing 3 mL of MethoCult.\nAdd the entire single cell suspension from each well to the tube containing 3 mL of Methocult using cut tips. We do not use blunt-end needles in this step. [In this long-term co-culture assay we are only interested to understand qualitative effect of stromal cells in regulating HSPC clonogenic potential. Therefore, we did not perform limiting dilution-based LTC-IC analysis].\nVortex the tube thoroughly.\nAllow the tube to stand for 5 min so that the bubbles rise up to the top.\nAliquot the MethoCult containing the cells into 35 mm gridded tissue culture scoring dish using 5 mL syringe fitted with 18-gauge blunt-end needles (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nEnsure minimum bubble formation by slowly adding MethoCult to the gridded dish and even spreading of the MethoCult.\nPlace the plates in a 150 mm dish along with a 35 mm dish containing sterile water to reduce evaporation.\nIncubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 with ≥ 95% humidity for 14–16 days.\nScore the number and type of colonies at the end of the incubation period.",
    "Count the well as positive if you can detect one or more CFU-G/GM, CFU-GEMM or BFU-E colonies or score as negative if no colonies are present (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])."
