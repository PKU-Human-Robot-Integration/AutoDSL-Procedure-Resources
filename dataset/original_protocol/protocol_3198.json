In the priming phase, the inflammatory stimulant LPS activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which in turn promotes the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. In the activation phase, PAMPs and DAMPs induced the assembly of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles, caspase-1-mediated secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, and pyroptosis. Therefore, LPS priming is an essential step in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. MSU is the commonly used DAMPs for classical NLRP3 inflammasome activation This section describes in detail the activation of NLRP3 by MSU and the subsequent detection of relevant indicators.\nSeed BMDMs.\nObserve the differentiation state of BMDMs under a microscope.\nDiscard the original culture medium in the culture dish and wash three times with sterile cold PBS.\nNote: Rinse with cold sterile PBS to remove other cells that are attached to the bottom of the culture dish.\nPrepare a 1% EDTA solution using DMEM medium without FBS and 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) for BMDMs detachment.\nNote: Due to the pH change, the DMEM medium turned yellow DMEM medium turns yellow after adding 0.5 M EDTA.\nDiscard the PBS and treat the cells with 10 mL of 5 mM EDTA for 2 min at room temperature.\nBlow off BMDMs with a pipette and collect them in a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend BMDMs with cell culture medium at a density of 5×105/mL.\nCulture BMDMs in a 12-well cell culture plate at 1 mL/well and place in a cell culture incubator overnight.\nBMDMs primed with LPS.\nPreparation of LPS solution: Dissolve LPS powder in ultra-pure water to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.",
    "Preparation of LPS medium: Add 1% FBS and 50 ng/mL LPS solution to DMEM medium.\nOn the second day after seeding, observe the adhesion and morphology of BMDMs under a microscope.\nReplace the cell supernatant with 500 μL LPS medium for 4 h of priming.\nCritical: The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome requires LPS to initiate the pre-stimulation signal to induce the expression of NLRP3 and Pro-IL-1β, and the effect of LPS is the best at 4 h, so it is recommended to control the LPS stimulation time at 3–6 h.\nAdd 150 μg/mL MSU to each well for 6 h.\nNote: MSU crystals are suspensions and must be mixed before use.\nUnder the microscope, the BMDMs are partly pyroptotic accompanied by cell swelling and crystals engulfed, and the cells and culture supernatant could be collected.\nCollect the cell culture supernatant and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 5 min, retaining the supernatant for ELISA and western blot.\nELISA: the specific steps of ELISA can be referred to the instructions of mouse IL-1β ELISA kit (R&D system CAS: DY401).\nDilution of ELISA kit: ELISA kits were diluted according to the table of dilution of ELISA kit.\nReagent preparation: PBS, Wash Buffer: PBST (pH 7.2–7.4), Regent Diluent: 1% BSA in PBS, Stop Solution: 1 mol/L H2SO4, Substrate Solution: TMB Substrate Solution.\nCritical: Dilution of concentrated sulfuric acid is an exothermic reaction, pay attention to slowly add concentrated sulfuric acid to water when diluting to prevent burns.\nPlate coating:\nDilute the Capture Antibody to the working concentration in PBS.\nImmediately coat a 96-well microplate with 100 μL per well of the diluted Capture Antibody.\nSeal the plate and incubate 12 h at about 25°C.\nAspirate each well and wash with Wash Buffer, repeating the process two times for a total of three washes.",
    "Blocking: Block plates by adding 300 μL of Reagent Diluent to each well. Incubate at about 25°C for 1 h.\nPreparation of standards: Take 7 EP tubes, add 1000 μL PBS to tube 1, add 500 μL PBS to the remaining 7 tubes, add reconstituted standard to tube 1 to make the concentration 1000 pg/mL, take 500 μL from tube 1 to tube 2, and then take 500 μL from tube 2 to tube 3, and so on (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRepeat the aspiration/wash as in step d. Add 100 μL of sample or standards per well. Cover with an adhesive strip and incubate 2 h at about 25°C.\nRepeat the aspiration/wash as in step d. Add 100 μL of the Detection Antibody, diluted in Reagent Diluent, to each well. Cover with a new adhesive strip and incubate 2 h at about 25°C.\nRepeat the aspiration/wash as in step d. Add 100 μL of the working dilution of Streptavidin-HRP to each well. Cover the plate and incubate for 20 min at about 25°C.\nNote: Avoid placing the plate in direct light.\nRepeat the aspiration/wash as in step d. Add 100 μL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for 20 min at about 25°C.\nNote: Avoid placing the plate in direct light.\nAdd 50 μL of Stop Solution to each well. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing. Determine the optical density of each well immediately, using a microplate reader set to 450 nm.\nProtein extraction.\nSupernatant protein extraction:\nAdd 600 μL of methanol and chloroform mixture (methanol: chloroform = 4: 1), mixed using a vortex apparatus (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2969-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Wash them with detergent and rinse several times with ddH2O, then dry with ethanol.\nPut two pieces of washed glass into the gel holder and fix it.\nAccording to the table of SDS-PAGE gel preparation, the components of the separation gel were successively added into the 50 mL centrifuge tube and mixed.\nPour the separation gel between the glass plates, immediately cover with a layer of double steamed water, and the gel can be polymerized after about 30 min.\nNote: Sealing water can isolate the air to accelerate the solidification of the gel, moreover, it can make the separation of the gel surface level.\nAccording to the table below, add the concentrated gel components into the 50 mL centrifuge tube in turn and mix well.",
    "Pour the upper double steamed water, pour the concentrated gel, and insert the sample comb.\nNote: In every step of gel filling, care should be taken not to pour bubbles into the gel plate, bubbles will seriously affect the final experimental results.\nCritical: Many components of SDS-PAGE gel are toxic to humans, so be sure to wear a mask and gloves when preparing and using it.\nElectrophoresis:\nAssemble the SDS-PAGE gel into the electrophoresis system.\nLoad the extracted protein samples into the wells.\nRun the stacking gel under a constant voltage of 90 V for 30 min.\nRun the separating gel under a constant voltage of 120 V for 1 h.

Neutrophil recruitment and the level of inflammatory factor IL-1β are markedly increased when peritonitis occurs, so testing the number of neutrophils and the level of IL-1β are preferred in determining the success of peritonitis induction.\nPreparation of mice: Purchase male C57/B6 mice at 7 weeks of age and house them in the animal facility for one week to acclimate to the environment.\nAdminister intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/kg MSU to the mice, with PBS as the control group.\nNote: The MSU suspension must be mixed before intraperitoneal injection, and the injection should be performed quickly and to avoid leakage.\nAfter 6 h, the peritonitis related indicators of mice were detected.\nEuthanize the mice with CO2, and open the abdominal wall to fully expose the peritoneum.\nNote: The abdominal skin should be open, but the peritoneal cavity must remain intact, this is critical for the success of the lavage.\nInject 500 μL of PBS into the mouse peritoneal cavity using an insulin syringe, and gently massage for 2 min.",
    "Note: Use an insulin syringe to minimize damage to the peritoneal fluid caused by the needle hole.\nCollect the ascitic fluid using a 1 mL syringe and centrifuge the supernatants for use in ELISA.\nNote: The ELISA procedure is the same as for the detection of IL-1β in cell supernatants.\nWash the mouse peritoneal cavity with 10 mL of PBS containing 1% BSA.\nNote: Perform flow cytometry analysis on cells collected from steps 15 and 16 to determine the number of neutrophils.\nReagent preparation: blocking solution: add 0.3 μL CD16/32 to 30 μL PBS.
