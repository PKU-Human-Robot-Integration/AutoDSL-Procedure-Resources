However, the area and all tools used should be sterilized with 70% Ethanol prior to usage.\nAfter placing the organoids into the organoid injection furrow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), plasmid DNA is injected into the center of single organoids using a sharp injection needle. Mixing the plasmid DNA with the Fast Green dye facilitates assessment of the injection site. For automated injection an EppendorfTM FemtoJetTM 4i Microinjector is used (alternative microinjection device see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and injections are performed under a stereo microscope. For setup see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nNeedle loading and adjustment of injection settings\nTake the needle (prepared in step 16–18).\nFill the needle with 10 μL of the Fast Green test solution (prepared in step 7) using 20 μL Microloader pipet tips.\nInsert needle into capillary holder.\nStart with the following settings: 45 hPa injection pressure (pi), 0.14 s injection time (ti), 0 hPa compensation pressure (pc).\nEject a drop onto a hemocytometer.\nAdjust settings in order to generate a drop with approximately 250 μm radius which corresponds to approximately 65 nL.\nEject H2O solution containing Fast Green onto paper tissue by pressing “clean” for several seconds.\nReload needle with plasmid DNA solution.",
    "Alternatives: To estimate the volume of the injected DNA solution: a drop of oil is placed on a hemocytometer and the solution is injected into the oil (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). The radius of the drop should be approximately 1/2 of the radius of the organoids, which corresponds to 1/8 of their volume. If the size of organoids of one batch varies substantially, the drop should be adjusted by the smaller ones. Bigger organoids can be either injected several times or at multiple locations.\nNote: These calibration steps are essential for a successful injection session and should be done every time the glass needle is changed. To increase the size of the drop, increase pi or ti; however, pi should be kept relatively low to prevent damaging the organoids. If the liquid dries inside the tip of the needle and blocks the needle pc can be increased; however, high pc will result in a constant flow of plasmid DNA.\nCritical: Before cleaning the needle make sure the needle is properly screwed into the capillary holder to prevent ejecting the needle.\nLoad organoids into injection furrow (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E)\nCollect organoids using a cut off P1000 tip (prepared in step 22).\nDistribute 10–20 organoids along the injection furrow.\nRemove some excess media using an uncut P1000 or P200.\nPlace the plate containing organoids under the stereo microscope.\nCritical: The organoids should be half-covered and surrounded by media to prevent them from drying out but they should not be fully covered by media in order to keep them stable during injections (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Avoid injecting more than 20 organoids at a time.\nInject organoids (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F–1G)\nGently push the needle into the center of the organoid.\nPush “inject” key (problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nGently pull out the needle.",
    "Repeat until the green DNA solution is clearly visible inside the organoid.\nMove to the next organoid in the row.\nNote: Big organoids can be either injected several times (keep needle inserted and press the “inject” key several times) or at multiple locations. Especially elongated organoids might be injected at multiple areas.\nCritical: The organoid should be filled with green plasmid DNA solution (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). If plasmid DNA solution flows out of the organoid the needle was not placed correctly or the injection volume needs to be adjusted (lower pi or ti). If no DNA solution is ejected the needle might be clogged (problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]) or dried out (problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nCritical: Avoid for the needle to be inserted into the agarose as it might break or clog. Equally avoid the needle to perforate through the organoid as this will cause leakiness of the plasmid solution and too much disruption on tissue integrity (see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: The time organoids spend on the injection furrow should be kept at a minimum (max 15 min). Inexperienced experimenters should start with low numbers of organoids injected at once.\nCollect organoids from injection furrow once all organoids are injected (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nFlush organoids out of the injection furrow with DPBS using the P1000 with cut off tip.\nTransfer organoids into Eppendorf tube.\nRemove as much DPBS as possible.\nClean injection furrow with DPBS for immediate reuse.\nNote: Carefully check by eye that all organoids are collected from the injection plate.\nNote: injection furrow should be trashed after a full day of usage as cell culture media deposits might get contaminated and create issues during further injections.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Example 1 shows a leaky injection evident by the injection solution surrounding the organoid and Example 2 depicts clogging of the needle where no injection solution is ejected.\nElectroporation of injected organoids\nTiming: 10 min\nAfter injecting all organoids with plasmid DNA they are pooled together (max. 20 organoids) into one cuvette and electroporated using a nucleofector device.\nElectroporate organoids (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I)\nAdd 100 μL of prewarmed (23°C) nucleofector solution to the organoids.\nTransfer whole solution containing organoids from the Eppendorf tube to the cuvette (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nElectroporate organoids using program A-023.\nAdd 1 mL of prewarmed media into the cuvette.\nFlush out organoids by pouring cuvette into a prepared collection 6-well plate.\nRepeat flushing out organoids until all organoids are in the collection 6-well plate.\nCollect organoids and transfer them back to the original well. This step removes excess debris and dissociated tissue resulting from injection and electroporation.\nAdd fresh media for further culturing.\nAssess transfection at selected time points using method of choice (problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nCritical: Do not overfill the electroporation cuvette with nucleofector solution (solution containing organoids should not exceed the limit of the paddle), as more than 100 uL will give an error message from the electroporator.\nCritical: Flush out organoids carefully from the cuvette to prevent damaging organoids that are fragile after electroporation. Try to keep the number of organoids inside the cuvette consistent between experiments to reduce variability.",
    "Critical: Electroporation should be executed as fast as possible in order to prevent diffusion of the plasmids out of the organoids and to minimize the time organoids are spent outside the incubator.\nNote: Here, the transfection efficiency was assessed using fluorescence microscopy of the electroporated organoids 1–5 days post injection."
