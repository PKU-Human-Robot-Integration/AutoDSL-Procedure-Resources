    "A schematic diagram depicting the whole experimental procedure is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3887/bioprotoc-11-02-3887-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure Bacterial incubation on film coatingSalmonella typhimurium (LT2), Escherichia coli K12, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC  29213  ) strains are maintained in glycerol stocks in liquid nitrogen. Prepare stocks by mixing by inversion or vortexing 130 µl of sterile glycerol and 770 µl of 5 ml overnight bacterial cultures grown in LB medium at 37 °C in sterile 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.Prepare fresh LB agar plates by pouring 25 ml of LB agar medium in the Petri dishes. After solidification, allow them to dry by leaving them opened and upside down in a stove for at least 30 min at 55 °C.Plate bacteria with a sterile inoculating loop from glycerol stocks onto solid LB plates and grow them overnight at 37 °C in an incubation stove.Pipet 5 ml of LB in sterile 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Then, by using an inoculation loop, pick colonies from the LB media plate and shake the loop in the liquid LB medium. Grow overnight at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) in an incubator shaker. To work in sterile conditions, keep the Bunsen burner on during the entire procedure.Check OD650 by using a spectrophotometer (1 OD650 = 108 CFU/ml).Take an aliquot of the overnight culture and dilute in 10 ml of sterile saline solution in a new sterile 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks to reach 1 x 106 CFU/ml. To work in sterile conditions, keep the Bunsen burner on during the entire procedure.Place the film-coated glass substrates on a cell culture plate and add 300 µl of the bacterial suspension on the surface of the films, avoiding leaking out of the films.",
    "The inoculum should stay on the surface of the coatings for the whole incubation time.Place the cell culture plate in a plastic box with wet paper to create a humidified chamber.Incubate at 37 °C in an incubation stove for 24 h without shaking.Recover the inoculum from incubation by resuspending the liquid on the film surface to capture bacteria potentially attached to the surface. Place in a 1.5 ml sterile Eppendorf tube.Viability evaluationCounting for colony forming units (CFU) Vortex the bacterial suspensions recovered from the incubation on film surfaces (2,000 rpm) for a few seconds.Make serial dilutions of the suspensions (10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4). For this, add 50 µl of the initial suspension to a sterile borosilicate glass tube carrying 450 µl of saline solution and vortex to mix it. Then take 50 µl of the first dilution 10-1 and pass to a new tube with 450 µl of saline solution, and so on until 10-4 dilutions. Vortex briefly before successive dilutions.Take 20 µl from each dilution and pour them as a drop onto sterile dried LB solid medium plates. Wait for the drops to be absorbed into the agar and then flip the plates.Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 24 h in an incubation stove. This incubation time could be modified in order to evaluate bacterial survival at other time points.Count the colonies formed onto the LB agar plate of each dilution. Only plates containing about 3-30 colonies per drop should be considered.The total CFU/ml is calculated as follows: the number of colonies corresponding to each drop x dilution factor x total volume (1,000 µl) /volume plated (20 µl). At least three independent films and three independent experiments are needed for statistical analysis.",
    "Dead or live staining Centrifuge the bacterial suspensions recovered from the incubation on film surfaces at 8,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Separate the pellets from the supernatants.Resuspend the pellet with 500 µl of saline solution and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl of a staining solution of SYTO 9 and PI.Incubate in the dark for 15 min at room temperature.Place 50 µl of the staining suspension in a glass slide and cover it with a cover glass.Visualize under a fluorescence microscope with 100x objective lens and immersion oil.Take at least 6 representative photographs per sample.DNA quantification Centrifuge the bacterial suspensions recovered from the incubation on film surfaces at 20,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Recover the supernatants and place them in a new 1.5 ml sterile Eppendorf tube.Place 1 µl of the supernatants in the NanoDrop to measure the DNA concentration. Read at 260/280 nm. At least three independent films and three independent experiments are needed for statistical analysis."
