    "All procedures are done in accordance with the guiding principles of the Physiological Society of Japan and with the approval of the Animal Care Committee of Kanazawa Medical University.\n1. Construction of the Glass Optrode Holder\nNOTE: To build a glass optrode holder, a commercial electrode holder is used (Figure 1A).\nGently pull out the steel tube for pressure control from the barrel of the holder.\nBy drilling, broaden the hole of the pin seat side in the barrel of the holder. Make the hole 3 mm in diameter and 12 mm in depth.\nPut a stainless-steel pipe (3 mm in diameter, 0.5 mm in thickness, and 8 mm in length; Figure 1A2) in the hole.\nInsert a ceramic split mating sleeve for ⌀2.5 mm ferrules (Figure 1A1) into the hole.\nFix the barrel of the electrode holder to an L-shaped rabbet with epoxy adhesive.\nMake the holes (3 mm in diameter) in the rabbet and attach it to a manipulator with screws.\n2. Head Post Installation\nPrepare a custom-built head post made of a circuit board spacer. Make the columnar circuit board spacer into a cuboidal shape with a milling cutter and cut it into 2 head posts with a saw (Figure 1B). Flatten the bottom of the head post with a milling cutter.\nPrepare the transgenic animal in which a light-sensitive opsin is expressed in a specific neuron type for the study. In this work, the transgenic mouse (VGAT-ChR2 mice) in which the inhibitory neurons express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)11 is used.\nAnesthetize the animal with a mixture of 0.3 mg/kg of medetomidine, 4.0 mg/kg of midazolam, and 5.0 mg/kg of butorphanol by intraperitoneal administration. To confirm that the animal is fully anesthetized, test its reactions to tail pinching.",
    "Place the mouse in a stereotaxic frame on a heating pad. Clean the stereotaxic frame and the heating pad with 70% alcohol in advance. Place the teeth in the hole of the bite bar, and lightly tighten the nose clamp. Fix both sides of the head using ear bars. When the head is correctly fixed by the ear bars, tighten the nose clamp. Apply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nShave the head skin with small scissors and clean the scalp with a cotton swab of chlorhexidine gluconate. Before the surgery, sterilize all the surgical instruments and a head post with an autoclave (121 °C, 15 min).\nCut the scalp along the midline with scissors and push it aside. Make the incision from the back of the head to the eyes (approximately 20 mm). Remove the periosteum with a cotton swab dipped in 70% alcohol and dry the skull.\nAttach the head post to the manipulator. Position the head post flat on the skull around the bregma using the manipulator.\nMix the monomer (4 drops), catalyst (1 drop), and polymer (1 small spoon) of dental cement on a small dish that is chilled in the refrigerator in advance. Put the dental cement (below 1 g) on the frontal and parietal bone of the skull to fix the head post to the skull.\nAfter the dental cement becomes hard, remove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame. Put an antibiotic ointment on the exposed skin. Inject the medetomidine antagonist (0.3 mg/kg) and the antibiotics (oxytetracycline; 20 mg/kg). Place and monitor the mouse on the heat pad in a cage until it awakes, and return it to a housing cage.",
    "House the animal in an individual housing cage with some enrichment device. Change the animal paper bedding daily to keep the cage clean and prevent infection. Carefully monitor whether the animal shows any sign of discomfort. Apply lidocaine to the wound if any pain is suspected. Administer meloxicam or carprofen once every 24 h for 48 h after both the head post installation and craniotomy surgeries. The local lidocaine can be given in addition if the NSAID is not adequate.\n3. Acclimation\nTwo days (minimum) after the recovery from the anesthesia, acclimate the animals to the head-fixed state in the recording chamber. Perform the acclimation sessions for at least 5 days.\nDuring the acclimation sessions, place the animal in the recording chamber with the head post fixed to a custom-built clamp. During the session, in order to limit movement, cover the body with a custom-made resin half tube (Figure 1C), made using a 3D printer.\n\tNOTE: On day 1, the acclimation session should be 5 min long. It is then increased daily to 10, 20, 40, and 60 min for days 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\nAt the end of each session, give the animal a food reward. If the animal struggles continuously during the acclimation, stop the session.\n4. Craniotomy\nNOTE: After the acclimation, a craniotomy is made over the brain region for recording. The craniotomy is performed in the stereotaxic frame under anesthesia, as with the head post installation. The post-operation procedure is the same as the head post installation. \nBefore the craniotomy, clean the skull with a cotton swab with chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% alcohol.\nCarefully scrape the skull over the recording site with a dental drill. When the bone becomes thin enough, cut it with the tip of the scalpel and remove it.",
    "Put dental cement around the exposed region in order to strengthen the skull.\nCover the exposed brain area with silicone adhesive after the dental cement becomes hard. The post-surgery procedure is as described in step 2.8.\n5. Electrophysiological Recording\nAllow the animal to recover for at least 1 day after the craniotomy before performing the electrophysiological recording. Place the animal in the recording chamber in the same way it was done during the acclimation sessions when the recording starts.\nMake glass pipettes from borosilicate glass capillaries (OD = 1.5 mm, ID = 0.9 mm, 90.0 mm long) pulled on an electrode puller. Their tip diameter is 2–3 µm, and their resistance is 4–6 MΩ when they are filled with 10 mM PBS. The length of the electrode is 40–50 mm. In some recordings, 2% neurobiotin is added to the 10 mM PBS.\nAttach the filled glass pipette to the custom-made optrode holder.\nPut the Ag-Cl coated silver wire (0.2 mm in diameter) into the glass pipette. Connect the silver wire to a pin via a thin coated electric wire. Connect the pin to the headstage of the recording amplifier.\nConnect the fiber-optic patch cord (core = 960 µm, cladding = 1,000 µm, NA = 0.63) with a zirconia ferrule (OD = 2.5 mm) to the split mating sleeve on the optrode holder. Push the patch cord into the sleeve until the tip of the ferrule contacts the back of the glass pipette. The patch cord delivers the light (wavelength = 465 nm) from LED. The LED light is controlled by a single-channel LED driver.\nRemove the silicone adhesive over the craniotomy. Put warmed saline (38 °C) on the brain surface periodically to prevent the brain surface from drying during the recording session. If necessary, remove the dura with sharp tweezers.",
    "Insert the glass electrode into the brain tissue with a manipulator. Monitor the electrode resistance when it is inserted. Replace the electrode when the resistance is lower than expected because the tip of the electrode may be damaged. At the depth of interest, search and isolate the single unit spikes by adjusting the depth in 2 to 5 µm steps.\nAfter the single unit is isolated, deliver the LED light and observe the response to the light stimuli.\nRecord the neural activities after the identification of the cell types. Perform the recordings for 2–3 h. If the recording is made on consecutive days (maximum of 2 days), cover the craniotomy with silicone adhesive. When the recording is finished, and the animal is sacrificed, retrieve the head post and put it in acetone to wash and reuse it.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
