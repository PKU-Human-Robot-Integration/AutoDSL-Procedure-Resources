    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProduction of POP-FAs in Streptomyces\nTiming: 6 days\nOnce integration of the expression plasmid has been confirmed in the Streptomyces producer strain, culture this strain and allow it to grow and produce POP-FAs. The following protocol was optimized for Streptomyces coelicolor strain M1152 expressing our POP3.4 plasmid; parameters such as incubation time or media may vary depending on the selected heterologous host.\nInoculate spores into 50 mL of R5 or TSB media with antibiotics in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks.\nWe recommend baffled flasks for increased oxygenation and break-up of mycelial clumps for easier extraction.\nIncubate for 6 days, at 30°C, 180 RPM.\nAlternatives: If doing large-scale production, after 48 h of incubation, inoculate this 50 mL culture into 450 additional mL of R5 or TSB with antibiotics, in 2 L baffled flasks, and incubate for another 4 days at 30°C, 180 RPM.\nNote: Culturing times will vary between Streptomyces strains.\nCultures are now ready to be harvested for POP-FA extraction.\nExtraction of POP-FAs\nTiming: 1–4 days\nBecause POP-FAs are produced intracellularly and not secreted, the mycelia must be harvested from liquid culture and lysed to extract the POP-FA products. The following protocol outlines a freeze-thaw and sonication step for cell lysis, and a methanol chloroform extraction for the recovery of POP-FAs.\nHarvest mycelial cells from the culture broth.\nFor 50 mL scale extractions, transfer liquid culture into 50 mL Falcon tubes via pipette or pouring. For 500 mL scale extractions, transfer the liquid culture into 1 L Polypropylene centrifuge bottles.\nScrape the sides of the culture flasks to collect any visible mycelial growth there as well.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mycelial cells, and discard the supernatant media.",
    "Alternatives: For large, 500 mL scale extractions, consider recovering mycelia via vacuum filtration with a Buchner funnel and filter paper, rather than centrifugation of large sample volumes. When using vacuum filtration, continue to transfer the pellet to 1 L centrifuge bottles for downstream steps.\nPause point: Freeze the pellet at −20°C for up to 2–4 weeks. Thaw to continue. While this step may be skipped, we recommend a freeze-thaw cycle to aid in the lysis of mycelial cells.\nResuspend mycelial pellet in water.\nUse roughly 10 mL for small-scale extractions, or 100 mL for large-scale extractions.\nLyse the mycelial cells.\nUse a Qsonica Q500 Sonicator with a 2 mm microtip, and keep a sample tube on ice.\nAdjust the height of the sample tube until the microtip is at least ∼1 cm submerged into the sample.\nCritical: To prevent hearing damage, wear ear protection and/or use a soundproof cabinet while using a probe sonicator. Shut doors and sonicate in a room separate from people who are not wearing ear protection.\nCritical: To prevent melting plastic or shattering glass tubes, avoid contact between the sonicator microtip and the sample tube.\nWe recommend the following sonication settings: 20 min (total) sonication Time (10 min of active sonication), 40% Amplitude, and a Pulse setting of 30 s On, 30 s Off.\nCritical: After sonication, ensure acidification of POP products by slowly adding HCl until the sample pH has been adjusted to ∼4. Transfer to conical glass tubes.\nCritical: Wear gloves and personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood when handling acids.\nAlternatives: For large-scale extractions, transfer to a glass bottle.",
    "Add methanol and chloroform in a 1:1:1 ratio with the sample. For small-scale extractions, this means roughly 10 mL of methanol and 10 mL of chloroform for a total mixture volume of 30 mL.\nOptional: We found best results with first adding the methanol, gently mixing, then adding the chloroform last.\nCritical: Chloroform reacts with most plastics; use only glass labware (tubes, pipettes, flasks, etc.) when handling chloroform.\nCritical: Wear gloves and personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood when handling toxic chemicals such as methanol and chloroform.\nMix vigorously and then allow fractions to settle and separate for 15–30 min; repeat this 2 times. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nCritical: For the first 1–2 min of mixing, pause intermittently to open the tube cap and release any pressure buildup.\nRecover the chloroform (bottom, transparent) fraction into a new glass tube using a glass Pasteur pipette.\nCritical: The top fraction contains methanol and water (transparent), while a middle layer (cloudy) contains lipids from the lysed cells; see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. Avoid the two upper fractions when recovering the chloroform fraction.\nPause point: The recovered fraction may be stored for 16–20 h at 20°C–22°C (or 1–2 weeks at 4°C) to allow any residual methanol, water, or lipids to collect at the top of the sample and be removed via glass pipette. Because POP-FA compounds may precipitate at 4°C, bring the samples back to 20°C–22°C before proceeding.\nAlternatives: For large-scale extractions, agitate for 16–20 h using a magnetic stirrer. The following day, pour the mixture into a glass separatory funnel with the stopcock closed. Allow the chloroform and methanol fractions to separate. Open the stopcock and allow the chloroform fraction to flow into a glass tube, flask or beaker. Close the stopcock to prevent the lipid layer or methanol fraction from flowing through.",
    "Evaporate the chloroform fraction using a rotary evaporator.\nIn our preparations we used a Buchi Rotavapor R-124. Any equivalent Rotary Evaporator may be used; follow standard or manufacturer’s protocols.\nCritical: To preserve sample quality, do not heat the sample beyond 40°C during this step.\nAdd 0.5 mL (5 mL for large-scale) of methanol at 20°C–22°C. Fully resuspend the sample in methanol, using gentle vortexing if the small-scale sample is in a centrifuge-grade glass tube, or swirling if the large-scale sample is in a rounded glass flask.\nTransfer the resuspension to appropriately sized centrifuge tubes (1.7 mL Eppendorf or 15–50 mL Falcon).\nPause point: The resuspension may be stored at 4°C for up to several weeks. Because POP-FA compounds may precipitate at 4°C, bring the samples back to 20°C–22°C before proceeding.\nTo remove any remaining solid and insoluble particles, centrifuge this solution for 10 min at 10,000 × g or maximum speed and recover the supernatant.\nThe sample is now ready for LC-MS analysis; transfer to GC vials.\nLC-MS analysis of POP-FAs and POP-FAMEs\nTiming: 1 h per sample\nAfter POP-FA molecules have been extracted from mycelial cells (or after they have been esterified to POP-FAMEs), analyze the samples using an LC-MS. Based on the resulting molecular weights, the chain length and the number of cyclopropanes present in the extracted molecules can be determined.\nRun the samples using a LC-MS with a 100 mm Viva C4 column (Restek, catalog number 9512511. 100 mm long, 1.0 mm inner diameter, 5 μM particle size) and the following conditions:\nInjection volume = 10 μL.\nFlow rate = 200 μL/min.\ncolumn temperature = 45°C.\nMobile phase solvent A = water with 0.1% formic acid.\nMobile phase solvent B = acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.",
    "Use the following HPLC gradient elution program as shown in Cruz-Morales et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Methods Table S1 (reprinted with permission):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2554_11.csv\nTable S3 from Cruz-Morales et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] lists a range of theoretical m/z ratios for both hypothetical and detected POP-FA molecules in negative ion mode. A shortened version of this table is replicated with permission here for quick reference. To use the table, follow the C[X]:CP[Y] molecule naming scheme, where X = chain length as measured by the number of carbons, and Y = the number of cyclopropanes present. Observed LC gradient retention times were also recorded and should be used as an additional reference when following our LC-MS run parameters.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2554_12.csv\n∗These theoretical molecules were not detected in the study by Cruz-Morales et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] However, these molecules may be detected in other experiments, particularly if new homologous pathways are tested.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2554_13.csv\nPreparative HPLC purification of POP-FAs\nTiming: 2–3 days\nIf analyzing samples with NMR, LC-MS/MS, or esterifying into POP-FAMES, preparative HPLC is necessary to further purify POP-FA after extraction.\nTransfer 1 mL of sample via pipette into 2 mL amber vials (GC vials) for use in HPLC.\nWe used a Zorbax SB-C18 column (9.4 × 50 mm, 5 microns particle size; Agilent PN: 846975-202). With the following conditions:\nInjection volume = 900 μL.\nflow rate: 1 mL/min.\nmobile phase solvent A = water + 0.1% formic acid.\nmobile phase solvent B = acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid.\nThe gradient elution program used was the same as for LC-MS.\nCollect the resulting fractions every 4 min until the end of the run.\nNote: using these parameters, we usually found our desired products in fractions 9–12. Once the fractions containing desired products have been identified via LC-MS, these fractions can be combined for downstream steps.",
    "Cover the fraction tubes lightly with foil (poke some holes in the foil) and dry for 16–20 h under a fume hood.\nFreeze-dry the fractions in a lyophilizer.\nFirst, freeze the samples at −80°C for 1 h in 50 mL falcon tubes with holes in the tube cap (holes can be drilled, or a heated metal tweezer could be used to poke the holes, etc.).\nManually turn on the refrigeration function for the lyophilizer at least 20 min before adding frozen samples.\nAdd frozen samples, close the valve and turn on the vacuum.\nAfter 1–2 days, or once lyophilization is complete (white-ish particles may be observed in the falcon tubes, but no frozen pellets should remain), open the valve, turn off refrigeration and vacuum functions, and remove the sample tubes.\nAlternatives: These methanolic fractions may instead be dried using rotary evaporation; do not heat samples beyond 40°C.\nResuspend the samples in 500–1000 μL methanol. Centrifuge at 6000 RPM for 5 min and transfer the supernatant to GC vials.\nPreparation of POP-FAMEs\nTiming: 1–2 days\nAfter POP-FAs have been extracted, they can be esterified into POP-FAMEs for improved fuel properties. We used a mild HCl protocol for its simplicity, but will present an aggressive Boron Trifluoride protocol as an alternative. Both protocols begin with a POP-FA sample extracted from a large-scale production run (500 mL culture) and processed using the preparative HPLC protocol.\nAfter preparative HPLC protocol, resuspend lyophilized sample in 100 μL of methanol and transfer to a small (e.g., 5 mL) screw-capped glass vial.\nAdd 0.75 mL methanol, followed by 0.15 mL of 8.0% HCl solution. The final HCl concentration should be 1.2% (w/v) or 0.39 M.\nStir and then incubate at 42°C for 22 h.\nCool the sample to 20°C–22°C.",
    "Add 1 mL of H2O and extract three times with hexanes.\nTo extract, add hexane, vigorously mix the sample, and recover the hexane (upper) fraction.\nCombine the extracted organic layers. Dry the sample using a Nitrogen Evaporator or an equivalent apparatus, or under a fume hood.\nExpected result: a white residue around the vial edges.\nAlternative protocol using Boron Trifluoride:\nAfter preparative HPLC protocol, resuspend lyophilized sample in 500 μL of methanol and aliquot 100 μL into small (e.g., 5 mL) screw-capped glass vials.\nDry samples under a fume hood.\nExpect around 1–3 mg of dried product.\nTo the dried residue, add 1 mL of a 14% (w/w) solution of Boron Trifluoride in Methanol (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number B1252).\nSeal the vial using a plastic cap, and heat to 100°C for 1 h.\nUse a bakelite or phenolic cap, e.g., Black plastic caps (Sigma Aldrich, Cat#Z106429).\nAfter 1 h, cool the solution to 20°C–22°C and evaporate the solvent under a fume hood.\nAdd 1 mL of H2O and extract three times with hexanes.\nTo extract, add hexane, vigorously mix the sample, and recover the hexane (upper) fraction.\nCombine the extracted organic layers. Dry the sample using a Nitrogen Evaporator or an equivalent apparatus, or under a fume hood.\nExpected result: a white to yellow residue around the vial edges."
