  "procedures": [
    "This study utilized 3D-digital LSD modeling to reconstruct the liver of a typical patient with clinically confirmed hepatic fibrosis. The patient was recruited from a well-known liver disease treatment institution, \"You An Hospital\" in Beijing, China, and underwent routine upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRE imaging after providing consent. The patient was chosen as the case study for this research method due to the confirmation of hepatic fibrosis staging through pathological examination and the absence of obvious clinical symptoms, which emphasizes the applicability and clinical value of this research in diagnosing early-stage hepatic fibrosis patients. This paper also provides a quantitative comparison between the liver of this patient and a healthy liver. The software tools used in this study are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Data collection and preparation\nNOTE: The parameter difference is not sensitive to the research method.\nMRI scanning strategies\n\tNOTE: This study utilized actual DICOM data obtained from clinical imaging using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device manufactured by GE. The content of the data includes IDEAL (Iterative Decomposition of water and fat with Echo Asymmetry and Least-squares estimation) water-fat separation imaging and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging.\n\t\nEnsure that the IDEAL data have a horizontal resolution of 256 pixels by 256 pixels, with a pixel spacing of 1.5625 mm and a slice thickness of 10 mm.\n\t\tNOTE: The scanning strategy could be further optimized, but the methodology employed in this study is applicable to higher-precision medical imaging.\nRename the folder of every sequence.\n\tNOTE: As the DICOM data exported from the equipment does not explicitly provide sequence names, during the preprocessing stage, it is necessary to add explicit names for each sequence to facilitate subsequent analysis and processing.\n\t\nCopy all DICOM data to a customized working directory.",
    "Navigate to the directory containing the data in MATLAB's working directory.\nExecute the Description_Name function to add descriptive names to the folders for each sequence.\nSee Figure 1 for a comparison before and after renaming. Add a Description Name to each image sequence folder to facilitate the identification of the necessary image sequences for various analytical purposes.\nQuickly check images of IDEAL.\n\t\nChange the directory of different phases' folders, including the in-phase, out-phase, water, and fat phases, which were stored in separate folders for imaging using IDEAL.\nExecute the Slice_View function to view the impact sequences for each phase.\nSee Figure 2 for an image of the interactive graphic user interface (GUI) for the MRI-IDEAL sequence. Use the scroll bar at the bottom of the GUI to quickly browse through the different sequences.\nUse the MRI-IDEAL out-phase sequence as the type of MRI sequence for providing clearer descriptions of liver tissue boundaries.\n\t\tâ€‹NOTE: In the following operations, the focus will be on using IDEAL's out-phase sequence to delineate the 3D region of the liver.\n2. Extract the 3D region of the liver\nNOTE: The individual voxels in the 3D region of the liver serve as spatial carriers for LSD, with the stiffness value of each voxel being derived from MRE. Extracting the 3D region of the liver tissue is a necessary step before fusion. While deep learning can be used to accomplish this task more efficiently, it is not the focus of this study. Therefore, mature software tools (e.g., MIMICS) are still used here to extract the 3D region of the liver tissue.",
    "To initiate the MIMICS software, select New Project and in the ensuing dialog box, navigate to the folder containing the IDEAL out-phase images. Proceed by clicking on NEXT | the Convert button, thereby gaining entry into the sequence-editing state.\nTo create an empty Mask, click on the New button in the MASK dialog box located on the right-hand side and select the maximum threshold.\nTo delimit the area of the liver in all horizontal views, utilize the Edit Masks tool located beneath the Segment label.\nTo generate the 3D spatial part of the liver, select the liver mask that has been delineated and click on the Calculate Part from Mask button. The extracted 3D region of the liver is shown in Figure 3.\nClick on File | Export | select the Dicom command. In the popup dialog box, choose the liver mask, set the file path and files' names, and click the OK button to complete the export of the 3D region of the liver to the specified DICOM files.\n3. The Liver stiffness map sequence\nNOTE: The MRE stiffness range in patients with early fibrosis is typically below 8 kpa. To view this, the sequence image labeled 'SE27_ST8K_(Pa)' should be selected.\nChange the directory to the folder of 'SE27_ST8K_(Pa)', which contains the liver stiffness map sequence.\nTo browse through each stiffness map, execute the MRE_show function in Matlab's workspace, with the function's argument being the filename located in the specified path.",
    "The liver stiffness map shown in Figure 4 is an RGB true-color image, with a data structure of 512 pixels by 512 pixels by 3 matrix, where each pixel point has three values representing the three primary colors, RBG. Observe the color bar on the left that displays the corresponding stiffness values of different colored pixels. Calculate the exact stiffness of each pixel by using their respective correlations.\nThe supplementary information in Figure 4 includes data such as sequence description, scan position, time, patient information, and image parameters. Use these data, particularly the image parameters, to establish the spatial relationship between MRE and IDEAL sequences.\n4. 3D-Volume of liver stiffness distribution\nNOTE: Each voxel in the 3D liver stiffness volume represents the stiffness value of a corresponding voxel in the 3D liver region, which is derived from the stiffness value of each pixel in Figure 4. By aligning the 3D liver region in Figure 3 with the stiffness map in Figure 4, the stiffness value of each voxel can be extracted, resulting in the generation of the 3D liver stiffness volume.\nInvoke the LSD_Slice function with the 3D liver region shown in Figure 3 and the Liver stiffness map in Figure 4 as input parameters to obtain the 3D-Volume of liver stiffness distribution, as shown in Figure 5.\nView the stiffness map of each layer of the liver by dragging the scroll bar below the GUI shown in Figure 5.\n\tNOTE: However, unlike Figure 4, only liver tissue is accurately retained here.\nObserve the icons in the upper right corner of the GUI (Figure 5) such as zooming in, zooming out, returning to the global view, and marking the coordinates of the pixel selected.",
    "NOTE: The default color bar is the colormap of \"jet\" which means that the corresponding values (Unit kpa) from blue to red are low to high.\nExecute the LSD_Volume function with the same input as LSD_Slice to obtain the spatial distribution of the 3D liver LSD, as shown in Figure 6. View the 3D-volume of LSD from any perspective by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the screen (Figure 6).\n5. LSD quantitative analysis\nNOTE: An important quantitative analysis focus of this study is to provide the proportion of different stages of LSD voxels in the patient's liver. Figure 6 shows that the distribution of liver fibrosis in patients is uneven in different spatial locations. The reason why clinical symptoms are not yet obvious is mainly due to a considerable proportion of liver tissue being in a normal stage. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify precisely the difference between patients and healthy individuals. This is an important quantitative concept of this study.\nDetermine the numerical ranges of stiffness values for different stages of hepatic fibrosis, as shown in Figure 7.\nCalculate the distribution of the patient's entire liver voxels in different fibrosis stages (Figure 8) by invoking the Hepatic_Fibrosis function with the input parameter of the 3D-volume of LSD shown in Figure 6.\nUse the same steps to calculate and compare the results of a completely healthy liver with the typical liver fibrosis patient described above (Figure 9).\nSubscription Required.
