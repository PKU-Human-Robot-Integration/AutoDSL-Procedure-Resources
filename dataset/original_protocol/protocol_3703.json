The shRNA-encoding vector has mCherry reporter gene and Puromycin selection gene.\nJurkat cell line is expanded in regular flasks until desired cell number is achieved\nDay -9: shRNA library contains ∼1,800 genes with 55,000 shRNAs. To use a 2000X coverage 1.1x108  lentiviral infectious units are seeded with 1.6x108 Jurkat cells to achieve a MOI of 0.7 in 80ml total in a roller bottle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/63-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Note that enrichment for shRNA species can also be picked up.\nDay 0: Add 1.1x108 cells into 2 different roller bottles and fill up to 250ml of fresh Jurkat media with 1μg/ml of Puromycin. One bottle will have GDC0941 at 1.4μM, the concentration at which cell growth is reduced by 20% and phospho-signaling is reduced according to drug titration. 35μl of GDC0941 at 10mM will be added to the bottle. Same amount of DMSO will be added to the control bottle\nDay 1: Split the 250ml of each bottle of GDC0941 and DMSO into 2 roller bottles (125 each bottle), to ensure there is not cell saturation. Add 125ml of new fresh media to each bottle with 17.5μl of GDC0941 at 10mM or DMSO and 1μg/ml of Puromycin.\nNote: Puromycin can be reduced at 0.5-1μg/ml to maintain the selection\nDay 3: Count and check cell viability.

Count cells, centrifuge 1.2x108 cells 5min at 1500rpm, discard supernatant, transfer them into a 5ml cryovial, centrifuge and discard supernatant again. Resuspend cells in remaining liquid and snap freeze at liquid N2 for 1 min before you keep it at -80 for long term storage.",
    "Note: we chose a 22-day screening period. This is somewhat arbitrary and could be shortened. The reason to allow for a longer selection period here was two-fold. First, we use a very modest concentration of PI3K inhibitor as backdrop. Second, we wanted to be sure to catch synthetic lethality that was not instantly but could take several days.\nPause Point: You can cryopreserve cells during the splitting days if you would like to preserve material from time points while the screen is ongoing.\ngDNA Extraction\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes the extraction of gDNA from frozen pellet.\nUse the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit.
