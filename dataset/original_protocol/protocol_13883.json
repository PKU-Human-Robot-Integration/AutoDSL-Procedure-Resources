    "The protocol described here complies with the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna.\n1. Preparations\nUse a specialized room dedicated/approved for procedures using x-ray equipped with a digital x-ray fluoroscopy system (Figure 1A), a monitor system (Figure 1B), a pressure recorder and transducer (Figure 1C) that are connected to a printer or recording software, and an ultrasound device (Figure 1D). Also, ensure there is sufficient space for a sterile working area (Figure 1E) next to the patient bench.\nEvaluate patients with suspected advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) for CSPH by measurement of HVPG. In particular, patients with one of the following features might undergo HVPG measurement: thrombocytopenia <150 G/L, portosystemic collaterals on cross-sectional imaging, gastroesophageal varices prior to initiation of non-selective betablocker therapy, ascites, and hepatic tumors that are scheduled for resection.\nUse the following contraindications for the procedure: (i), absence of vascular access due to jugular or caval vein thrombosis, (ii) clinically evident bleeding disorders (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation), (iii) contralateral pneumothorax, and (iv) significant cardiac arrhythmias.\nEnsure that the patient is fastened and gave written informed consent after being informed about the purpose and potential risks of the procedure.\nExplain that the procedure must be performed without general anesthesia. However, low doses of midazolam (up to 0.02 mg/kg bodyweight) might be offered to anxious patients.\nMonitor the patient’s vital signs by non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiography using a standard monitor system.\nFlush the pressure transducer set using sterile saline solution in a pressure bag.\nCalibrate the pressure transducer (if not precalibrated, calibrate against an external pressure reference before starting measurements, e.g. by using a water column where 13.6 cm H2O equals 10 mm Hg).",
    "Place the transducer at the level of the right atrium by aiming at the patient’s midaxillary line.\nPrepare the pressure recorder/recording software to be ready for recording pressure tracings.\nEnsure that all necessary sterile equipment is ready (see Table of Materials).\nAsk the patient to take a supine position on the patient bench.\nHave the operator wash and disinfect her/his hands and forearms.\nPut on surgical cap and face mask, sterile gloves and a sterile coat.\nUse a sterile table cover and prepare a sterile working area for the equipment needed for the central venous access (Figure 2A).\n2. Central venous access under sterile conditions\nInstruct the patient to turn his/her head slightly to the left side, then disinfect the area of the right anterior and lateral neck with a disinfectant solution.\nPlace sterile towels that cover the skin around the carotid triangle.\nUse a ultrasound probe (covered by a sterile US probe cover sheath) to identify the right internal jugular vein and the appropriate puncture site.\nInfiltrate the area of subsequent vascular access with a 21 G needle and apply a local anaesthetic (lidocaine 2%, 5 mL). Then, wait 1–2 min for its full effect.\nPrepare all materials needed for central venous access (see Table of Materials).\nUsing the equipment of the 7.5 F catheter introducer sheath set, place the needle in the right internal jugular vein using ultrasound guidance and advance the guidewire through the needle using the Seldinger technique (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: If a transjugular biopsy should be performed after HVPG measurement, a larger diameter 10 F liver biopsy introducer sheath set (with extra 18 G needle and guide wire) has to be used.",
    "Make a 2-3 mm incision along the guidewire using a blade 11 scalpel to ease introduction of the vascular access sheath loaded with the dilatator.\nInsert the vascular access percutaneous sheath loaded with the dilatator into the internal jugular vein over the guidewire.\nRemove the guidewire and the dilatator of the vascular access sheath.\nMake sure that the vascular access sheath remains in a stable intravascular position and orient the injection port of the vascular access sheath towards the lateral side (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: Suturing or taping is not needed.\n3. Placement of the balloon catheter in a hepatic vein\nPrepare all materials needed for placement of the balloon catheter into a hepatic vein (Figure 2B).\nFlush the balloon catheter with contrast media (dye) and check the integrity of the balloon by repetitive insufflation/deflation with the catheter tip immersed in saline solution. No air bubbles should occur.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the visibility of the catheter itself on x-ray, you may also use just sterile saline or diluted dye to flush the vascular lumen of the catheter.\nMoisten the balloon catheter on the outside with sterile saline solution before inserting it into the vascular access sheath.\nAdvance the balloon catheter under fluoroscopic guidance into the inferior cava vein (IVC). Aligning the tip of the balloon catheter towards the back of the patient and slight rotations of the catheter usually allows to advance from the right atrium to the IVC. Instructing the patient to inhale deeply might help in some cases (Figure 3B).\nAdvance the balloon catheter from the IVC into the hepatic vein. Try to get access to the hepatic veins by repeatedly moving with the tip of the balloon catheter facing to the right towards the suspected area of the junction of the hepatic veins and the IVC (Figure 3C).",
    "Ensure that the catheter is advanced into a stable position that allows the repeated measurement of the free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) at a 2-4 cm distance from its opening into the IVC and adequate space for the inflated balloon in the lumen of the hepatic vein in order to record the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP).\nCheck for an adequate occlusion of the vein (wedge position) by inflating the balloon (about 2 mL of air into the balloon lumen) and contrast agent injection (about 5 mL into the vascular lumen) until the hepatic vein distal to the inflated balloon is visualized (Figure 3D).\nObserve the stasis of the contrast media and exclude washout of the contrast media due to insufficient occlusion of the venous lumen by the balloon or due to the presence of vein-vein communications. If significant contrast media washout is observed, try to reposition the balloon catheter.\nDeflate the balloon and flush the lumen of the catheter with saline.\n4. Hemodynamic readings for assessing the HVPG\nConnect the vascular lumen of the balloon catheter to the pressure transducer using an infusion line.\nStart recording the FHVP with the tip of the balloon 2-4 cm from the opening of the hepatic vein to the IVC. The waveform of the curve must be stable without variations over time.\n\tNOTE: Stable values are usually obtained after 15 s.\nInflate the balloon and continue recording the WHVP until the measurement becomes a stable horizontal line with no variations over time.\n\tNOTE: Stable tracings of the wedged pressure are usually obtained after >40 s.\nRepeat the measurement of FHVG (>15 s) and WHVP (>40 s) at least three times to obtain triplicate high-quality readings (Figure 3E).",
    "NOTE: If significant discrepancies of ≥2 mm Hg are observed between the single FHVP/WHVP readings, additional measurements should be obtained. Note the reasons for potential artefacts, such as coughing, moving, or talking at the respective timepoints of hemodynamic recording.\nRecord pressure in the IVC at the level of the ostium of the hepatic vein as well as the right atrial pressure (RAP).\nStop recordings.\nRemove the balloon catheter.\nCalculate HVPG (FHVP subtracted from WHVP) as the mean of 3 measurements.\n\tNOTE: If significant differences ≥2 mm Hg are noted between the sequentially obtained HVPG readings, additional measurements should be obtained.\nProceed to transjugular biopsy (step 5.1) or remove the catheter introducer sheath from the internal jugular vein.\n\tNOTE: Inserting a stiff guidewire may help to reach the same intrahepatic position for subsequent transjugular liver biopsy.\nApply pressure on top of the vascular insertion site of the internal jugular vein for at least 5 min using a sterile gauze.\n5. Preparation for transjugular liver biopsy\nNOTE: Two different biopsy methodologies may be used to obtain a transjugular liver biopsy: aspiration (step 6) or core biopsy (step 7). First decide which system to use and then select the appropriate biopsy needle introducer sheath before proceeding with steps 5.1 to 5.3). Alternatively, the needle of the core TJBLX set can also be inserted into the aspiration set (NOTE: use appropriate diameters), which results in a more flexible core biopsy system that may be easier to introduce into a hepatic vein (NOTE: this approach is not described in detail here).\nPrepare the respective transjugular liver biopsy (TJLBX) set (aspiration TJLBX: Figure 4A-B; core TJLBX: Figure 4C; see Table of Materials).\nFlush the biopsy needle introducer sheath with sterile saline or, in case of transjugular aspiration liver biopsy, with contrast agent for better visualization.",
    "Advance the biopsy needle introducer sheath into a hepatic vein using the same technique as described in 3.4.\nDepending on the biopsy set used, proceed either to step 6.1 for aspiration TJBX or to step 7.1 for core TJBX.\n6. Transjugular aspiration liver biopsy\nUse a 10 mL Luer-lock syringe to flush the aspiration TJLBX needle with sterile saline, however, leave about 3 mL in the syringe to facilitate aspiration.\nAdvance the biopsy needle gently through the biopsy needle introducer sheath until the tip of the needle reaches the end of the introducer sheath.\n\tNOTE: Avoid any force or fast movements while advancing the needle. Asking the patient to take a deep breath will decrease the angle between the IVC and the hepatic veins for easier advancement of the biopsy needle.\nAsk the patient to hold his breath.\nApply suction using the 10 mL Luer-lock syringe and advance the needle into the liver parenchyma.\nRetract the needle while still applying suction (negative pressure).\nAdvice the patient to continue breathing normally.\nRemove the needle (but not the needle introducer sheath) and harvest the liver sample.\n\tNOTE: The liver sample is usually retained in the syringe, not in the needle (Figure 4D).\nRepeat steps 6.1 to 6.6 for additional needle passages until sufficient liver specimens are obtained.\nInject 5-10 mL of contrast media over the catheter introducer sheath to rule out perforation of the liver capsule.\nRemove the biopsy needle introducer sheath.\nRemove the 10 F liver biopsy set introducer sheath and apply pressure on top of the vascular insertion site of the internal jugular vein for at least 5 min using sterile gauzes.\n7. TRANSJUGULAR CORE LIVER BIOPSY",
    "Load the core TJLBX needle by pulling the grip until the shooting mechanism is locked. Advance the core biopsy needle gently through the biopsy needle introducer sheath until the tip of the needle approaches the end of the introducer sheath.\n\tNOTE: Avoid any force or fast movements while advancing the needle.\nAsk the patient to hold his/her breath.\nAdvance the needle into the liver parenchyma.\nPerform the core biopsy by pulling the trigger of the shooting mechanism.\nAdvice the patient to continue breathing normally.\nRemove the needle (but not the needle introducer sheath) and harvest the liver sample. A small needle might help to remove the liver sample (Figure 4D).\nRepeat steps 7.1 to 7.6 for additional needle passages until sufficient liver specimens are obtained.\nInject 5-10 mL of contrast media over the side port of the catheter introducer sheath to rule out perforation of the liver capsule.\nRemove the biopsy needle introducer sheath.\nRemove the 10 F liver biopsy set introducer sheath and apply pressure on top of the vascular insertion site of the internal jugular vein for about 5 min using sterile gauzes.\nSubscription Required.
