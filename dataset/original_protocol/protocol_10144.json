    "1. Fabrication of Heparin-incorporated Starpeg Nanocoating\nSynthesis of heparin succinimidyl succinate (Heparin-NHS)\nWeigh out 0.69 g of heparin and dissolve in 2.0 mL of ice-cold deionized water.\nWeigh out 0.23 g of NHS and dissolve in 0.5 mL of ice-cold deionized water in a round-bottom flask.\nWeigh out 0.77 g of EDC and dissolve in 0.5 mL of ice-cold deionized water in a round-bottom flask.\nMix the NHS and EDC solutions in a round-bottom flask. Leave the mixed solution on the bench at room temperature for 30 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the EDC NHS mixture at 5,031 x g for 10 min to remove excess EDC and NHS.\nAdd 30 mL of cold ethanol to the mixture solution and centrifuge at 5,031 x g for 10 min.\n\t\t\nRepeat twice.\nPreparation of starPEG-heparin nanocoating\nAdd 1.0 mL of 10% (w/v) starPEG-(NH2)8 to a round-bottom flask.\nAdd 0.67 mL of 10% (w/v) heparin-NHS to the same round-bottom flask.\nPlace the mixed solution of starPEG-(NH2)8 and heparin-NHS in an incubator at 25 °C for 20 min to obtain a clear solution with viscosity.\n\t\t​NOTE: For experiments in which fluorescently labeled heparin (FAM-heparin) was required, the fabrication procedure is the same except that the star-PEG-(NH2)8 was dissolved in deionized water supplemented with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein N-succinimidyl ester 0.1% (molar ratio) of starPEG-(NH2)8. )\nCharacterization of heparin-PEG nanocoating by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR)\nBefore starting, rinse the agate mortar, pestle and pelleting device (small disks with diameter of 13 mm) with acetone and deionized water. Dry the glassware in an oven before use.\nMix approximately 0.1–1% heparin-PEG sample with 200–250 mg of fine KBr powder.\nPlace the heparin-PEG and KBr mixture in the agate mortar and finely pulverize into small pellets with diameters of 2 µm.",
    "Transfer the mixture into a pelleting device. Apply high compression force (8 T/cm2) in a vacuum for 1–2 min to form transparent pellets.\nGently pull the sample pellets away from the pelleting device. Be careful not to pull too hard so not to incur cracks.\nTransfer the sample pellets very carefully to a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscope to determine sample chemical structure.\nExamination of the internal porous structures of heparin-PEG nanocoating by scanned electron microscopy (SEM)\nFor the following procedures, prepare standard 48-well cell culture plate and pipettes.\nPipette the heparin-PEG copolymer solution into the wells of a 48-well culture plate.\nFreeze the plate at -80 °C for 24 h.\nLypophilize the samples at -50 °C in vacuum environment (0.1 Pa) for 24 h.\nSpread samples across the sticky surface of an aluminum stub.\nCoat the samples with gold and observe under the scanned electron microscope to observe internal porous structures.\nExamination of the heparin-PEG nanocoating surface by atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nClean silica glass slides with piranha solution (70% H2SO4, 30% H2O2) at 80 °C for 40 min.\nSonicate the slides in methanol for 10 min and then in toluene for 10 min.\nDry the slides by vacuum drying.\nWash the slides with plenty 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane solution (2% in toluene), shake gently.\nSonicate the slides in methanol for 10 min then in toluene for 10 min.\nPlace 100 µL of 3% heparin-PEG solution across the surface of the slides using a standard pipette.\nExamine the surface of heparin-PEG under an atomic force microscope (a resonant frequency of 50–80 kHz, force constant of 0.350 N m 21, tip radius of 600 nm).\n2. Mouse Islet Surface Engineering with Heparin-PEG Nanocoating\nMouse islet surface coating with heparin-PEG nanocoating",
    "Extract mouse islets by collagenase digestion and histopaque gradient purification as previously reported in JoVE19.\nHandpick 200 islets under a dissection microscope to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 500 µL of PBS to the islets and centrifuge at 503 x g for 1 min.\nTake off the supernatant and add 250 µL of the heparin-PEG solution and keep the mixture on ice for 10 min. Pipette up and down to allow the islets to mix well with the heparin-PEG solution.\nCentrifuge at 503 x g for 1 min.\nRemove the supernatant and add 500 µL of PBS. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nCentrifuge at 503 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant and keep the islets for further use. For examination of mouse islets coated with the heparin-PEG, FAM-heparin-PEG was used for islet coating following these steps.\nExamination of mouse islets coated with the FAM-heparin-PEG nanocoating\nAdd 1–2 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to the coated islets and transfer these islets into a non-charged sterile bacterial culture dish.\nObserve the morphology and fluorescence signals of FAM-heparin-PEG nanocoating-coated islets under an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n3. Function of Heparin-PEG Coated Mouse Islets Compared to Non-coated Islets\nViability of heparin-PEG coated mouse islets\nHandpick 20 of the heparin-PEG coated mouse islets and place them into one well of a 96-well cell culture plate.\nFill a total of 10 wells with 20 heparin-PEG coated mouse islets for each well.\nHandpick 20 of noncoated control islets and place them into one well of the same 96-well cell culture plate.\nFill a total of 10 wells with 20 noncoated control islets for each well.",
    "Put 200 µL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum into each well of the 96-well plate that contains islets and maintain in culture for 14 days.\nReplace islet culture media every 2 days.\nTreat the islets with a live/dead staining kit at the end of 14 days in culture and observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nCount PI+ (red) cells within each islet under an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nRevascularization of the heparin-PEG coated mouse islets in vitro\nPre-cool all experimental plastics including culture plate and pipette tips at least 12 h before use.\nPlace a 24-well place on a cooling pad. Add 250 µL of ice cold growth factor-reduced Matrigel into each well of a 24-well cell culture plate. Place the coated 24-well plate at 4 °C for at least 30 min.\nWhile the matrix solution is setting in the fridge, trypsinize the mouse pancreatic islet endothelial Mile Sven 1 (MS1) cells.\n\t\t\nRemove all culture media from the tissue culture flask. Rinse the flask with 5 mL of PBS.\nRemove the PBS and add 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA. Incubate at 37 °C for 3 min in a standard incubator.\nLightly tap the bottom of the flask to detach the cells and add 5 mL of serum-supplemented media.\nCollect the cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nTake off the supernatant and add 5 mL of PBS. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min and take off the supernatant.\nAdd serum-supplemented DMEM media into the tube and seed 50,000 cells into each well of the matrix-solution-coated 24-well plate.\nAdd 5 heparin-PEG coated islets or noncoated control islets into each well.",
