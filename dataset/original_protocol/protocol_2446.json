    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn this section, we first describe the workflow of phospholipid extraction from yeast cells and next provide procedures for the extraction of phospholipids from other sample types. Lastly, we provide detailed steps for setting up MS programs to examine phospholipid compositions. An extended library for LC-MS parameters is provided in the supplemental information[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Mmc1.pdf].\nCell culture and yeast sample preparation\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThis step describes preparation of yeast cells for phospholipid extraction.\nInoculation. Inoculate from a single colony grown on a newly streaked plate into a 2 mL SD medium in the culture tube with dual-position snap cap. Cultivate at 30°C.\nDilution. The saturated yeast culture is diluted in 20 mL fresh SD medium in a flask at an OD600 of 0.1.\nHarvest cells. Collect 4 OD600 units of cells growing logarithmically in a 15 mL centrifuge tube for lipid extraction.\nSpin down cells at 3,750 g for 3 min at 4°C.\nWash cells with 1 mL ice-cold Millipore water, transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge at 3,750 g for 1 min at 4°C, and collect the cell pellets.\nNote: It takes about 6.5 h to reach OD600 1.0 in SD medium for wild-type (WT) prototrophic yeast cells in the CEN.PK background.\nPause point: Snap-freeze the cell pellets in liquid nitrogen and store them at −80°C if extraction procedures are not immediately followed.\nPhospholipid extraction\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis step describes a procedure for phospholipid extraction from yeast cells.\nThe overview of this procedure is summarized in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Prepare a homogenization solution. Prepare 500 μL ice-cold methanol (LC-MS grade) solution for every sample by adding 10 μL of the spike-in phospholipid standard mixture.\nNote: Including the phospholipid standard mixture during phospholipid extraction is sufficient for relative quantification. This helps to monitor and normalize extraction efficiency. Add LIPIDOMIX® Standards if absolute quantification is required. The mixture standards of deuterium-labeled lipids can be added to the homogenization solution or be included later at the reconstitution step (step 22) before MS injection.\nCritical: Warm up the stock solutions and vortex-mix at 25°C before use. The stock solutions of phospholipid standards stored in the −20°C refrigerator should be fully re-dissolved at 25°C. The homogeneity of the spike-in standard mixture will affect quantification accuracy.\nAdd 400 μL glass beads to empty screw-cap tubes.\nResuspend the cells in 500 μL of the homogenization solution containing the spike-in standards, transfer them to the tubes filled with glass beads, and ensure that each tube cap is tightened.\nNote: The samples should be kept cold before adding chloroform.\nAs shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], disrupt the cells using a bead-beater.\nPlace the sample tubes axis-symmetrically in the pre-cooled holder.\nSet up a bead-beating program at 67 Hz for 300 s.\nRepeat twice for a 30-s interval of ice incubation.\nAs shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], punch a hole at the bottom of the screw-cap tube with a 26G needle and insert the tube halfway into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin at 4,500 g for 1 min at 4°C.\nCritical: Find screw-cap tubes that fit into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and make sure that this assembly is stable and will not fall during centrifugation. Run a trial spin with the assembled tubes of choice to confirm safe operation.",
    "Collect the flow-through, including the cell lysate, and transfer it to a 15 mL glass tube.\nWash the glass beads with 500 μL ice-cold methanol and collect the flow-through after 1-min centrifugation at 4,500 g.\nCombine this flow-through with the flow-through collected at step 10 in the 15 mL glass tube.\nNote: The total volume for each sample should be around 1 mL. Add ice-cold methanol to adjust if necessary.\nAdd 2 mL chloroform to the 15 mL glass tubes and vortex vigorously for 30 s.\nNote: Use glass pipettes to transfer chloroform.\nCritical: Organic solvents such as chloroform and methanol are toxic and harmful to human health. Handle these reagents in a chemical fume hood with care, and wear personal protection cover (such as a lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles).\nSpin for 3 min at 1,000 g, transfer all the supernatant to a new 15 mL glass tube, and discard the cell pellet.\nAdd 400 μL of 50 mM citric acid and 800 μL chloroform, and vortex for 30 s.\nSpin at 1,000 g for 5 min to achieve phase separation.\nCarefully aspirate off the upper phase, including the protein layer formed at the phase boundary, and save the bottom organic phase.\nOptional: Wash the bottom phase with an artificial upper phase (chloroform/methanol/water; 3/38/47; v/v/v) (Folch et al., 1957[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: The total volume of the organic phase is about 2.8 mL. Save 3 aliquots of 200 μL of this phase and proceed to step 18.\nDry lipid samples in the organic phase using the vacuum concentrator system. It takes about 15–20 min.\nPause point: Store the dried samples at −80°C.",
    "Note: This phospholipid extraction procedure is adapted from previous methods (Vaden et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Ye et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and modified for the targeted MS method for phospholipid quantification.\nPhospholipid extraction for other sample types\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis step describes phospholipid extraction from other types of samples.\nNote: Please refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for the preparation of starting amounts of samples.\nMammalian cells (HEK293T).\nAspirate off culture medium and quickly wash with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer if necessary.\nScrape off the cells in PBS buffer, transfer to the 1.5 mL screw-cap tube, and remove PBS after centrifugation.\nAdd 500 μL homogenization solution containing a 10 μL phospholipid standard mixture.\nPerform the freeze-thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath 5 times. Homogenize the cells using a bead-beater without glass beads.\nTransfer to 15 mL glass tubes and add 500 μL ice-cold methanol.\nContinue to step 13 in “phospholipid extraction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]” for the subsequent procedures.\nTissue samples (kidney).\nAdd 400 μL glass beads to screw-cap tubes and put frozen tissue samples in.\nAdd 500 μL of the homogenization solution containing a 10 μL phospholipid standard mixture.\nHomogenize the tissue samples as described for yeast cells in step 7.\nPerform the freeze-thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath 5 times.\nContinue to step 8 in “phospholipid extraction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]” for the subsequent procedures.\nNote: Some tissue samples may be challenging to homogenize with glass beads. Alternative methods can be used (Jenkins et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Tani et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; van Smeden et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nMouse serum.\nAdd 100 μL of the homogenization solution containing a 1 μL phospholipid standard mixture to a 5 μL serum sample.\nAdd 200 μL chloroform.",
    "Note: A small extraction buffer system is used to extract phospholipids from fluid samples like serum. All other solvents are reduced to 10%, accordingly.\nSet up a vibrating program at 67 Hz for 60 s using the bead-beater.\nSpin at 2,000 g for 1 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 40 μL of 50 mM citric acid and 80 μL chloroform.\nVibrate at 67 Hz for 1 min to mix.\nSpin at 2,000 g for 1 min to achieve phase separation.\nAspirate off the upper phase carefully and save 2 aliquots of 100 μL from the bottom organic phase.\nDry the lipid samples using the vacuum concentrator system.\nSample preparation for LC-MS detection\nTiming: ∼1.5 h\nProtocol for detailed steps of sample reconstitution for LC-MS. The overview of this procedure is summarized in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. A workflow of sample reconstitution for LC-MS analysis\nPhospholipid extracts are reconstituted in 200 μL 2-propanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:1:1, v/v/v).\nNote: 2 μL of LIPIDOMIX® Standards (LIPIDOMIX® Standards/re-suspension=1:100 (v/v)) is included at this step if having not been included as internal standards during lipid extraction.\nGently shake at 20 Hz for 10 min.\nPlace at 25°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 g for 15 min at 25°C.\nTransfer 150 μL of the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRepeat step 25.\nTransfer 120 μL of the supernatant to another new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTransfer 100 μL into a glass insert placed in a glass sampling vial.\nPrepare a quality control (QC) sample from sample residuals. Take an equal volume from each sample, making a 100 μL mixture as the QC sample.\nPreparation of LC-MS for acquisition\nTiming: ∼1 h\nProtocol for establishing an instrument method in MRM mode.",
    "Create an instrument method in MRM mode using the LC-MS system.\nEnter the transition for precursor ion Q1 and fragment ion Q3, the name, the dwell time, and the appropriate collision energy (CE) and declustering potential (DP) for each phospholipid species.\nNote: Please refer to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] and Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Mmc2.xlsx] for phospholipid-specific MRM settings.\nNote: The ion source conditions and the LC program are set up as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nEquilibrate the LC system, and run a blank and a phospholipid standard mixture sample.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2080_8.csv\nNote: When the location of fatty acid chains in a phospholipid is known, the fatty acids are separated by “sn-1/sn-2”. For an unknown location, the fatty acids are separated by a “-” (Buré et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The alkyl and alkenyl ether phospholipids are denoted by the “O-” and “P-” prefixes. See also Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Mmc2.xlsx].\nCheck the LC pressure after the system is equilibrated. For the ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column, the pressure at equilibrium is about 1,800 psi/125 bar for a flow of 0.15 mL/min with 20% Buffer B.\nCheck background signals and if there are miscellaneous peaks on the chromatograms for the blank sample. Some background noises and miscellaneous peaks can be simply reduced or cleared by running extra blank samples. If not, flush the LC system thoroughly. Request maintenance service to clean the LC lining system or the mass spectrometer ion source if the interferences remain unresolved.\nInspect the retention times for phospholipid standards. Because retention time is important for phospholipid peak annotation, maintaining identical chromatographic conditions is critical for reproducible retention times.\nLC-MS detection\nTiming: ∼20 min/sample\nThis step describes how to create an acquisition batch.\nPut the samples into the sample holder in the auto-sampler. Write down the vial position for each sample.",
    "Create an acquisition batch. Select the acquisition method that has been established in “Preparation of LC-MS for acquisition.” Enter sample names, vial positions, data file paths, and injection volumes, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Build an acquisition batch\nSubmit this acquisition batch.\nNote: Queue a QC sample every 5–10 samples.\nDuring acquisition, check retention times and the intensities of internal standards for each QC samples.\nNote: Make sure that there are no major peak shifts or signal drop-offs during acquisition.\nData analysis\nTiming: 1–6 h\nThis step describes a workflow for data validation, quantification, and visualization (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2080-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. A workflow for data analysis\nUse SCIEX OS to open a data set.\nInspect the peaks. Integrate peaks manually when necessary.\nExport raw data files.\nNormalize the spectral intensities of each sample to the spike-in standards.\nNote: Monitor extraction efficiency by examining the spectral signal of each phospholipid species in the spike-in standards. Different classes of spike-in phospholipids should not vary much among samples. If so, the spectral intensity of each phospholipid in the samples can be normalized by dividing either a single or total intensity of the standard phospholipids.\nUse the normalized values to calculate relative abundances of phospholipids.\nMolar concentrations for each phospholipid species are calculated using the following formula based on the signal intensities of deuterium-labeled phospholipid standards:\nC (S)∗=peak area (S) × C (Std)∗/peak area (Std).\nNote: ∗C (S): Molar concentration of a phospholipid species in a sample; C (Std): Molar concentration of the same class of phospholipids in the deuterium-labeled standards.",
    "Phospholipid abundances can be further estimated in terms of the head group class (LPC, LPE, PC, PE, PS, PI, PA, PG), the number of carbons (28, 30, 32, 34, 36), and the number of double bonds (0, 1, 2) in their acyl chains.\nOptional: We recommend the web-based platform MetaboAnalyst for further data analysis and visualization. MetaboAnalyst supports raw MS spectra processing, data normalization, statistical analysis, and functional analysis."
