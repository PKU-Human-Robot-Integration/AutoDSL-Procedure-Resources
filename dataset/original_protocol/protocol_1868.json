Incubate 1 h at 18°C–25°C in the dark.\nKeep the cells on ice until sorting.",
    "FACS Sort the cells with a BD FACS Fusion Tex Red A laser. A typical sort is represented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. To place the gates: place P5 (G1) and P6 (G2) first, then divide the remaining four phases across S phase in equal fractions. The P5 fraction goes from the base of the large peak (1N) to 50% of the slope on the right. The P6 fraction goes from the top of the second peak (2N) to the base on the right. Collect P1 (S1) to P4 (S4) in 500 μL of PBS (P5 and P6 are optional), at least 250,000 cells per fraction. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1461-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating for cell sorting\nNote: Any sorter with a laser line of 488 to excite Propidium Iodide can be used.\nNote: There is no need to correct for a potential overestimation of numbers of events from the sorter compared to the actual number of collected cells.\nDNA extraction\nTiming: 2 days\nDuring this step DNA is purified and sonicated.\nAdd SDS to 0.8% and proteinase K to 20 μg/mL to each fraction, incubate 2 h at 55°C .\nAdd one volume of phenol-chloroform, vortex, centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed. Collect as much as the upper phase possible and transfer in 15 mL conical tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1461-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Picture of a typical phenol-chloroform extraction\nNote: Be careful not to transfer the interface (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAdd 1/9 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2.5 volumes of ice cold 100% EtOH and 1 μL (20 μg) of glycogen. Vortex and incubate 12–20 h at −80°C.\nNote: volume refers to the volume of upper phase collected in the previous step.\nPause point: DNA can be precipitated at −80°C for a few days if needed.",
    "Transfer 2 mL of each sample to 2 mL low-bind DNA tubes, centrifuge 17 min at maximum speed at 4°C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat step 15 until all the material has been precipitated in the same tube.\nWash the pellet with 500 μL of 70% EtOH, centrifuge 2 min at maximum speed at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and air dry the pellet.\nResuspend the DNA in 100 μL of 10 mM Tris pH 8 and in 0.5 mL thin wall PCR tubes.\nSonicate at amplitude 70% for 20 s ON, 40 s OFF for 12 min of total time on, using a QSonica Q700 containing cold water (ideally in a cold room).\nNote: We found this sonicator optimal for DNA sonication, however equivalent bath sonicators could be used and will need adapting for the sonication time and amplitude.\nNote: The bath should never get hot, change the water if necessary.\nEvaluate the size of the DNA using a TapeStation D1000 or a Bioanalyzer. The DNA should be < 300 bp fragments.

TapeStation analyses for a typical DNA extraction performed with this protocol\nNote: A typical TapeStation result is presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nNote: Refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for a typical yield of DNA given by Tape Station, please note that one can proceed with at least twice as less DNA than presented in the figure.\nPause point: DNA can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nImmunoprecipitation\nTiming: 2 days\nDuring this step the DNA labeled with BrdU is immunoprecipitated and purified.\nHeat denature the DNA 2 min at 95°C. Move immediately on ice and spin down the contents when cold.\nNote: The BrdU antibody only works on single-stranded DNA (see antibody’s technical data sheet).",
    "Take 75 μL of DNA, add 45 μL of 10× IP buffer (10× PBS, 0.5% Triton-X100) and 330 μL of RNAse free H2O.\nWash 50 μL of Protein G magnetic beads with 1× IP buffer and resuspend in 1× IP buffer.\nAdd 50 μL of washed beads and 2 μL of anti-BrdU antibody to the DNA prepared in step 23. Incubate 2.5 h under rotation at 18°C–25°C in the dark.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads with 1 mL 1× IP buffer, vortex thoroughly, place the tubes on the magnetic stand and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat the previous step for 4 more washes.\nElute the samples by resuspending the beads in 200 μL 1× IP buffer containing 250 μg/mL proteinase K. Incubate 2 h at 55°C in the dark.\nTake the eluates off the beads, add 200 μL phenol/chloroform, vortex, centrifuge 1 min at maximum speed. Collect as much as the upper phase possible.\nNote: Be careful not to transfer the interface.\nAdd 1/9 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2.5 volumes of ice cold 100% EtOH and 1 μL of glycogen. Vortex and incubate o/n at −80°C.\nNote: Volume refers to the volume of upper phase collected in the previous step.\nPause point: DNA can be precipitated at −80°C indefinitely.\nCentrifuge 17 min at maximum speed at 4°C. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nWash the pellet with 500 μL of 70% EtOH, centrifuge 2 min at maximum speed at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and air dry the pellet.\nResuspend the DNA in 75 μL of 10 mM Tris pH 8.\nNote: If the pellet is difficult to resuspend the tubes can be placed 20 min at 55°C.",
    "Optional step: qPCR verification of IP. Set up 10 μL qPCR reactions using 0.5 μL of IP and 1% input (1% input: 0.75 μL denaturated DNA (non-IPed) diluted to 75 μL) and actin and satellite 2 primers. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.9].\nNote: Actin replicates early so the qPCR should be prominent in early S phases while satellite 2 replicates late so should be enriched in late S phases (Black et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: Actin genomic primers forward TCCAAAGGAGACTCAGGTCAG reverse CGCCCTTTCTCACTGGTTC, satellite 2 primers forward CATCGAATGGAAATGAAAGGAGTC reverse ACCATTGGATGATTGCAGTCAA.\nNote: Expected qPCR results should be 1.5%–10% input in the fractions the regions are expected to replicate.\nLibraries preparation for sequencing\nTiming: 1 day\nDuring this step the DNA will be prepped to be sequenced with Illumina Nextseq 550 or related Illumina sequencer.\nWe used the Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences).\nSwift Biosciences- https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PRT-019-Methyl-Seq-Protocol-Rev-3.pdf[href=https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PRT-019-Methyl-Seq-Protocol-Rev-3.pdf]\nNote: This is the only library prep kit that we optimized successfully with BrdU labeled DNA.\nWe are annotating the main steps below as an overview, please refer to the guide for details.\nStart with 15 μL of immunoprecipitated DNA.\nDenaturation (page 9).\nAdaptase (page 9).\nExtension (page 10).\nNote: To cleanup follow the instructions for < 10 ng gDNA.\nLigation (page 10).\nNote: To cleanup follow the instructions for gDNA.\nIndexing PCR (page 11).\nNote: We performed 7 PCR cycles. The numbers of PCR cycles could be increased slightly if very little DNA was obtained at step 21 (∼2 cycles); however too many cycles will create PCR duplicates that will need to be removed from the sequencing results.\nNote: To cleanup follow the instructions for gDNA.\nValidate the libraries using a TapeStation or a Bioanalyzer and proceed to sequencing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1461-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
