    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Medical Norms and Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical University and are in accordance with the China legislation on the use and care of laboratory animals.\n1. Preparation of the thread plug, SD rats, and experimental equipment\nUse a nylon thread with a diameter of 0.28 mm as the main body of the thread plug.\n\tNOTE: The softness and hardness of the nylon thread should be moderate.\nCover one end of the nylon thread with silicone material. The length of the silicone part of the thread plug is approximately 1.2 cm, and the diameter is approximately 1.2 mm. The head end is tapered, and the silicone part is cylindrical. Reserve another 5-7 cm. The nylon thread is easy to clamp and can be cut according to specific needs after the operation.\nUse 75% ethanol to soak the thread plug for 3 min before the operation and rinse any residual ethanol with normal saline before plugging.\nSelect 12 male SD rats weighing between 280 and 320 g, and randomly divide them into a sham group and experimental group (n = 6 per group). After a week of environmental adaptation, fast the rats for 12 h and water-deprive them for 4 h before the operation.\nPrepare the following experimental equipment needed for the experiment: a small animal anesthesia machine, a brain stereotaxic instrument, a dissecting microscope, a high-speed skull drill, scissors, tweezers, vascular forceps, a needle holder, a needle thread, a 2 mL syringe, a laser-speckle blood-flow imaging system, and a small-animal MRI scanner.\n2. Construction of SD-Rat SSS-Embolization Model via Thread Embolization",
    "Place the SD rat into an anesthesia-induction box and use a small-animal anesthetic machine to deliver 4% isoflurane to induce anesthesia. Thereafter, use forceps to confirm that the SD rat's hind limbs and toes do not respond to moderate pinching.\nQuickly fix the SD ratwith shaved top hair in the prone position on a brain stereotaxic device. Maintain anesthesia with 1.5-2.0% isoflurane (at a speed of 0.5 L/min), and stabilize the respiratory rate at 40-60 breaths/min. Stabilize the rat's body temperature via a heating pad at 37±0.2 °C.\n\t\nApply sterile ophthalmic eye lubricant after the rat is placed on the stereotaxic frame to protect the corneas from drying during anesthesia.\nSterilize the surface on the top of the rat's head with 5% povidone iodine alternating three times with 75% ethanol. Make a skin incision (2.0-cm long) in the middle of the head, and then carefully peel off the top fascia and periosteum to fully expose the skull.\n\t\nConfirm the positions of the anterior fontanelle, posterior fontanelle, coronal suture, sagittal suture, and herringbone suture.\nUse the area between the coronal suture and the herringbone suture as the blood-flow observational area. To prevent the skull from affecting observation during laser-speckle blood-flow imaging, thin the skull in the observation area until the blood vessels are clearly visible. The size of the thinned skull should be approximately 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm. This step and the following are all performed under a dissecting microscope.\n\t\nDuring skull grinding, use normal-temperature saline to rinse the drill repeatedly to avoid high-temperature burns to the cerebral cortex.\nUse a high-speed drill to grind the skull within a 6.0 mm x 4.0 mm bone window centered at bregma to expose the SSS of the bregma area.",
    "Use normal saline to cool the skull during grinding. When the skull becomes thin, use tweezers to carefully remove the remaining bone pieces to avoid tearing the SSS.\nChoose a suitable thread plug, use the SSS bregma point as the plug point, carefully puncture it with a 2 mL syringe needle, and quickly insert the thread plug head into the plug point.\n\t\nAt this time, the angle between the end of the thread-plug head and the SSS should be approximately 30-45°; then adjust the angle between the end of the thread plug and the SSS to 0-10 degrees, and slowly insert the SSS into the center until the head reaches the posterior edge of the sinus confluence. Thereafter, cut off the excess part of the tail.\n\t\t​NOTE: Rapid bleeding may occur when the SSS is punctured. If the end of the thread plug cannot be quickly inserted into the plug point at one time, use a small gauze or cotton ball to gently press the plug point while slowly sliding down to expose the plug point carefully, and then quickly insert the end of the wire bolt into the SSS. After the thread plug is inserted, if there is bleeding at the plug point, hemostatic materials such as a gelatin sponge can be used to stop the bleeding.\n3. Detection of Blood Flow on the Brain Surface of SD Rats\nUse a laser light source to uniformly illuminate the blood-flow observational area. The reflected light is collected by a camera and is transmitted to a computer for analysis. Use the following parameter settings for the laser-speckle blood-flow imaging system: wavelength: λ = 785 nm; and image exposure time: T = 10 ms.",
    "Center the SD-rat blood-flow observational area into the field of view of the laser-speckle blood-flow imaging system and conduct continuous monitoring of blood flow on the brain surface for 2 min. Collect and process the blood flow data before and after embolization for each SD rat, and obtain the laser-speckle blood-flow map of the observed area.\nRepeatedly rinse the operated area with normal saline to wash away bone debris and residue. Suture the skin (0# thread) and disinfect with iodophor.\nMaintain body temperature until the rat awakens after surgery and then house in a single cage with food and water provided ad libitum. The sham group cannot be plugged.\nAfter data collection is completed, perform post-processing.\n\t\nComplete selection of the region of interest (ROI) via the tools provided by the laser-speckle blood-flow imaging system software. The values obtained are the average blood-flow value in the ROI, and the local cerebral-blood-flow values before and after embolization. Use the blood-flow value before embolization as the baseline value.\nSelect four ROIs and measure the relative change in cerebral blood flow in each ROI, expressed as the percent change from the baseline value.\n4. Detection of thread position on small animals MRI",
    "Use the following T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) parameters for MRI imaging system: time of echo (TE) = 33 ms, time of repeat (TR) = 3000 ms, number of excitation (NEX) = 4, Slices = 28, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, matrix size = 256*256 mm2, flip angle = 80°, field of view (FOV) = 30*30 mm2, scan time = 6 min 24 s; magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) parameters were set as follows: TE = 4.4 ms, TR = 12 ms, NEX = 4, slices = 80, slice thickness = 0.4 mm, matrix size = 256*256 mm2, flip angle = 80°, FOV = 30*30 mm2, scan time = 16 min 23 sec 40 ms.\nFix the animal on the MRI scanning table, calibrate the brain position by positioning scanning, and perform T2WI and MRA sequence scanning after confirming the position.\nUse continuous anesthesia via the animal anesthesia machine during the detection. Then, euthanize the SD rats by intraperitoneal injection of excessive pentobarbital.\nImage acquisition and post-processing: after collecting the image data, in order to observe the state of the thread plug in the SSS more clearly, use the pseudo color enhancement method to display the T2WI image of the rat brain.\nSubscription Required.
