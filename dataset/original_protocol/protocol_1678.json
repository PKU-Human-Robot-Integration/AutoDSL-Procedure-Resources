    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAAV transduction and biotinylation of secretomes in mice\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThe following steps describe the specific transduction of Albumin-Cre mice with pAAV-FLEX-ER-TurboID followed by biotinylation of the hepatocyte secretome. We recommend using wild-type C57BL/6J mice as negative control for background labeling. 3 to 5 mice per genotype should be used for viral transduction.\nTransduce pAAV-FLEX-ER-TurboID into adult Albumin-Cre mice\nThaw aliquoted AAV on ice. Prepare AAV injection solution by diluting 1011 genome copies (GC) in saline in a total volume of 100 μL per mouse. We recommend making an extra solution for each mouse.\nNote: Higher dose, i.e., 1012 GC, of AAV may be used to achieve better viral transduction efficiency. We have found 1011 GC to be sufficient to label hepatocyte secretome in mice and higher dose to be more efficient for other cell types that are less frequently transduced by AAV.\nLoad 100 μL of the saline injection solution containing AAV into a 29G needle.\nCritical: Make sure to empty air from the needle and not to spill AAV solution onto skin or eyes.\nRestrain 8–12 week old Albumin-Cre male mice using a Tailveiner Restrainer. The tail vein is exposed by pulling it by the tail through the slotted tube. Orient the mouse so that the head is away from you and the tail is pointing towards you. Use 70% ethanol to disinfect the tail.\nOptional: Use a mouse warmer lamp to help dilate the tail vein.",
    "An ideal injection site is ∼2 cm away from the base of the tail (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Hold the tail taut at the approximate injection site with thumb above and forefinger below the tail. Visually identify the tail vein, which appears slightly darker in color relative to the tail. Insert the needle bevel up into the vein at an ∼15 degree angle to the skin. Inject the AAV solution into the vein over a period of 1–5 s (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Other routes of AAV administration may also be used here. For example, direct viral injections into the muscle or adipose has been successfully employed by others (Long et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Zeng et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) to drive expression in these tissues. In this protocol we only describe systemic transduction via the tail vein.\nCritical: No resistance should be felt during the injection if the needle is appropriately inserted into the tail vein. If resistance is felt, remove the needle and repeat the injection at a slightly different location ∼0.5 cm away from the initial injection site.\nAfter injection, return mice to home cages for 2 weeks to allow for expression of the AAV.\nNote: Some conditional Cre-ER mouse drivers require administration of tamoxifen after viral transduction to turn on the expression of the ER-TurboID cassette. In this case, recombination can be induced two weeks after AAV injection by intraperitoneally injecting 2 mg tamoxifen powder dissolved in 100 μL corn oil for each mouse for 5 consecutive days. Return mice to home cages for 2 weeks to allow for expression of the AAV after the final tamoxifen injection.\nPause point: AAV expression time can vary between 2 weeks to 6 weeks according to the experimental need.",
    "Two weeks after AAV transduction, deliver biotin by drinking water using the following procedure: add 100 mg biotin to a mixture of 294 mL water and 6 mL DMSO. Heat the solution to 95°C for 20min to completely dissolve biotin. Cool down the biotin-supplemented water to room temperature (20°C–25°C) and provide it to micer in place of their normal drinking water for three consecutive days.\nNote: The biotin water labeling period can be adjusted longer or shorter depending on experimental needs. We have not observed any differences in total water consumed between regular water and biotin-supplemented water. Biotin may form long crystals and precipitate in drinking water. If this happens, prepare fresh biotin-supplemented water every day.\nOptional: Secretome labeling can also be accomplished by intraperitoneal injection of biotin. Prepare the biotin injection solution by dissolving biotin in a solution of 18:1:1 saline:Kolliphor EL:DMSO (by volume), 2.5 mg/mL. Heat solution at 95°C for 10 min to fully dissolve biotin. Once cool to room temperature, inject 200 μL per mouse per day using a 29G syringe for a final dose of 24 mg/kg biotin. Fresh intraperitoneal biotin injection solution should be delivered daily for three consecutive days but may vary according to the experimental needs. We have found strong biotinylation signals in the blood a few hours after a single intraperitoneal injection of biotin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1235-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Harvest blood plasma and liver tissue from Albumin-Cre mice and control wild-type C57BL/6J mice.\nPreparation for liver and blood collection.\nPrepare eppendorf tubes to collect tissues and lithium heparin tubes (BD, 365985) to collect mouse blood.\nPrepare dry ice to store liver tissues and wet ice to store blood.\nPrepare dissection scissors, tweezers, diapers and 70% ethanol.\nPerform a submandibular bleed to collect blood (JoVE Science Education Database and Lab Animal Research, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Restrain the mouse by the scruff of the neck. Using a 21G needle, puncture the submandibular vein by insertion of the needle 1–2 mm into the cheek. The puncture site should be slightly behind the mandible, but in front of the ear canal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Use a lithium heparin tube to collect blood. When the flow of blood slows, repeat the same submandibular bleed procedure on the other cheek.\nCentrifuge total blood (2,500×g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant is the blood plasma fraction. Freeze blood plasma on dry ice.\nNote: The plasma fraction should be pale yellow in color. If it becomes red, be cautious that the plasma has been contaminated with the red blood cell contents. Whole blood can also be stored on wet ice for up to 30 min prior to centrifugation. Approximately 100–500 μL plasma can be obtained per mouse.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2. Use ethanol to spray down the mouse abdomen and use dissection scissors and tweezers to open the intraperitoneal cavity. Excise the liver without the gallbladder. Freeze down the liver immediately in dry ice.\nPause point: Plasma and liver samples can be stored in −80°C for a few years.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1235-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Blood plasma collection\n(A) Puncture site for submandibular bleed.\n(B) Example of successful blood collection into a lithium tube.",
    "Prepare blood plasma and liver tissue for Western blot analysis.\nFor blood plasma, add 4 μL of blood plasma to a 20 μL 4× loading buffer. Then add PBS to 80 uL final volume.\nFor the liver, add 5 metal bulk beads and 500 μL RIPA buffer into a bulk tube. Add ∼100 mg liver tissue. Homogenize liver samples using a Benchmark BeadBlaster Homogenizer (40 s on 20 s off, 5 min, 4°C). Centrifuge (16,000×g, 10 min, 4°C), remove supernatant containing liver proteins, and quantify protein concentration using Nanodrop One. Add 400 μg proteins into a 20 μL 4× loading buffer and add PBS to the 80ul final volume.\nBoil the blood and liver samples at 95°C for 10min and cool down to room temperature prior to loading on gel.\nAlternatives: The 4× sample loading buffer here may be replaced by home-made buffer using the following recipe: 2.0 mL 1M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.8 g SDS, 4.0 mL 100% glycerol, 0.4 mL 14.7 M β-mercaptoethanol, 1.0 mL 0.5 M EDTA, 8 mg bromophenol Blue for making 10 mL buffer.\nPerform Western blotting analysis to detect biotinylated proteins from blood plasma and liver.\nLoad 20 μL plasma or tissue samples into each well of a 4%–12% SDS-PAGE gel (approximately 100 μg protein/lane). Run at 120 V for 1.5 h.\nTransfer the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane.\nBlock the membrane with a 5 mL Odyssey blocking buffer at room temperature for 30 min.\nFor detecting biotin labeling signals, incubate the membrane with 1:1000 streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 680 antibody at room temperature for 1 h or in the cold room overnight (12–24 h).",
    "For detecting the expression of ER-TurboID, incubate the membrane with 1:1000 mouse anti-V5 in the cold room overnight (12–24 h), followed by 1:10000 anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody for 30 min.\nFor loading control of blood plasma, use POnceau S staining reagent to stain the nitrocellulose membrane and choose the region around 50kd across the blot for comparison. For loading control of the liver, use 1:1000 rabbit anti-mouse actin as the primary antibody and 1:10000 anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody.\nImage the blots at LI-COR gel imager (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1235-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Note: The intensity of biotin signals on a gel can be variable and dependent on the cell types transduced. For parenchymal cells of an organ, e.g., hepatocytes in the liver, biotin signals are very strong in both tissue and plasma levels by western blotting. However, for some other cell types, e.g., endothelial cells and immune cells, biotin signals are generally weak in both tissue and plasma levels by western blotting. To obtain higher sensitivity by gel-based detection, biotinylated protein samples can be immunoaffinity purified by streptavidin beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Silver Stain (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nEnrichment of biotinylated plasma proteins\nThe following steps describe the protocol of streptavidin-based enrichment of biotinylated plasma proteins for proteomic analysis.\nTiming: 20 h\nRemove excess biotin from plasma.\nThaw frozen plasma on ice (200 μL). To remove excess biotin in plasma, dilute 200 μL plasma from a single mouse into 15 mL PBS and concentrate 30-fold using 3 kDa filter tubes by centrifuging (4,000 x g, 1.5 h, 4°C).\nDiscard the flow through and repeat the concentration step.\nDiscard the flow through, add another 5 mL PBS into the tube and concentrate to a final volume of 500 μL. This represents 9,000-fold final dilution.\nNote: Pale yellow sediments may be present in the plasma and may block the filter during the centrifugation. Remove the sediments using a pipette tip.\nOptional: Further dilution of biotin in plasma can be achieved by repeating the centrifugation step 6(a).\nWash streptavidin beads.\nVortex the bottle containing Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 magnetic beads for 1 min.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette tip, transfer 200 μL bead slurry into eppendorf tubes placed on a magnetic rack. Wait 10s until all the beads are fully attached to the wall.",
    "Critical: Take out the beads immediately after vortex to ensure the same amount of beads are used for each sample.\nRemove supernatant with 200 μL pipette tips. Add 1 mL washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1× HALT protease inhibitor, 5 mM trolox, 10 mM sodium azide and 10 mM sodium ascorbate) and vortex for 3s. Aspirate washing buffer. Repeat the washing step twice.\nNote: When making washing buffer stock, add every component excluding 1× HALT protease inhibitor. Add protease inhibitor fresh. The washing buffer stock can be stored in a cold room (4°C) for a few months.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend beads in a 100 μL washing buffer.\nAdd 500 μL diluted plasma to the washed beads in a 100 μL washing buffer (600 μL volume final) and rotate in a cold room overnight (12–24 h). Biotinylated plasma proteins will bind to streptavidin beads.\nWash streptavidin beads containing bound biotinylated plasma proteins.\nPlace the eppendorf tubes containing streptavidin beads on a magnetic rack and wait 10s until the beads are fully attached to the wall.\nRemove the supernatant using 200 μL pipette tips and save as flow through. Add 1 mL washing buffer. Vortex for 3s and put back on a magnetic rack. Repeat this step.\nAdd 1 mL 1M KCl solution. Vortex for 3 s and put back on a magnetic rack.\nAdd 1 mL 0.1M Na2CO3 solution. Vortex for 3 s and put back on a magnetic rack.\nAdd 1 mL 2M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Vortex for 3 s and place back on a magnetic rack.\nNote: This step should not exceed 1min.",
    "Add 1 mL washing buffer. Vortex for 3s and put back on a magnetic rack. Repeat the wash step once.\nElute biotinylated plasma proteins from beads\nFollowing the second wash, aspirate wash supernatant completely. Add 60 μL elution buffer (2× NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer supplemented with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM biotin). Vortex and spin down the beads.\nNote: To make an elution buffer, dissolve 4 mM biotin into a 4× loading buffer by boiling for 10 min and add PBS to make 2× loading buffer with 2 mM biotin. Then dissolve DTT in water to make 500 M stock and Add DTT into the elution buffer to reach 20 mM final DTT concentration. Aliquot elution buffer into 500ul aliquots and store at -80°C for future use (up to six months).\nBoil the beads at  95°C for 10min. Put the tubes back on a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant into a new tube. In total ∼ 85 μL final eluant containing biotinylated proteins should be recovered.\nTake 5 μL of final eluant and analyze by SDS-PAGE using either a silver stain (ThermoFisher LC6070) or anti-streptavidin blotting. As a control, use 5 μL elution from wild-type C57BL/6J mice (e.g., no cre-mediated recombination) injected with pAAV-FLEX-ER-TurboID and supplemented with biotin water. Successfully enrichment should show much more intense bands in Albumin-Cre mice samples compared to samples from control mice (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nPause point: Once successful streptavidin isolation has been confirmed by SDS-PAGE, samples can be frozen at -80°C for long-term storage. Alternatively, proceed with S-trap-based sample processing for proteomic analysis.\nNote: This streptavidin enrichment protocol is adapted from Branon et al. (2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nS-trap-based proteomic sample processing for biotinylated plasma proteins\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The following steps describe the protocol of proteomic analysis of the final eluant obtained in Step 10 using an S-trap spin column.\nAlkylate biotinylated plasma proteins\nMake 0.25M iodoacetamide (IAA) solution by dissolving 23.1 mg IAA into 500 μL water.\nAdd 9.6 μL of 0.25 M IAA into 80 μL final eluant obtained in Step 10 and vortex to mix. Place the tube in the dark for 30min.\nBind and wash biotinylated plasma proteins on S-trap columns\nAdd 1.1 μL 85% phosphoric acid and vortex to mix. The color should turn from blue to green.\nAdd 560 μL bind/wash buffer (add 3 mL 1M TEAB solution into 27 mL methanol and mix) to each tube and vortex to mix.\nAdd 150 μL sample into each micro-S-Trap column and spin (4,000×g, 20 s). Discard flow through.\nRotate the top of the column 180 degrees and repeat step (c) until the whole sample has passed through.\nAdd 150 μL bind/wash buffer and spin (4,000×g, 30 s). Discard flow through.\nRotate the top of the column 180 degrees and repeat step (e) 3 times.\nTransfer the upper part of the column into a new 2 mL eppendorf tube.\nDigest biotinylated proteins on S-trap column\nAdd 1 μg trypsin into 25 μL of 50mM TEAB solution. Add 25 μL trypsin solution into the S-Trap column. Spin the column briefly and return the solution that passes through the top of the column.\nClose the cap loosely to prevent evaporative loss.\nCritical: Do not shake! Shaking will greatly impede the digestion performance.\nDigest at 47°C for 90 min.\nElute tryptic peptides\nAdd 40 μL of 50mM TEAB and spin (1,000×g, 60 s). Save the flow through.\nAdd 40 μL of 0.2% formic acid and spin (1,000×g, 60 s). Save the flow through.",
    "Add 40 μL of 50% acetonitrile in water + 0.2% formic acid and spin (1,000×g, 60 s). Save the flow through.\nAdd 40 μL of 0.2% formic acid and spin (4,000×g, 60 s). Save the flow through.\nPool eluted peptides by combining the flow through samples. Lyophilize samples and resuspend in 20 μL 0.2% formic acid.\nPause point: Proteomic samples can be stored in -80°C for up to 2 years.\nNote: This S-Trap protocol is adjusted from Protifi, S-Trap™ micro spin column digestion protocol (http://mass-spec.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2019/10/S-Trap-method.pdf[href=http://mass-spec.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2019/10/S-Trap-method.pdf]).\nShotgun liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of biotinylated plasma proteins\nTiming: 2 h per sample\nThe following steps describe the protocol and parameters of LC-MS/MS runs.\nSet up the nanoflow liquid chromatography conditions.\nEstimate peptide concentration using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher) with absorbance measurements at 205 nm (A205), or using quantitative peptide colorimetric or fluorometric assays (Pierce).\nInject ∼1 μg of resuspended peptides on column using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RPLCnano system (Thermo Fisher) to control and drive the mobile phases (A, water with 0.2% formic acid and B, 100% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid).\nUse an integrated loading pump to load peptides onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 5-μm particles, 20 mm in length, Thermo Fisher) during the first 6 min of the acquisition. Hold the gradient at an isocratic flow at 0% B during this time.\nAt 6.1 min, use the switching pump to move the trap column in line with the analytical column, which is a 50-cm EASY-Spray reversed-phase LC column (inner diameter of 75 μm, packed with 2-μm, 100-Å, PepMap C18 particles, Thermo Fisher).",
    "Perform gradient elution at 300 nl/min and increase the gradient from 0% to 5% B from 6 to 6.1 min, followed by an increase from 5% to 25% B from 6 to 86 min, an increase from 25% to 90% B from 86 to 94 min, isocratic flow at 90% B from 94 to 102 min and a re-equilibration at 0% for 18 min, for a total analysis time of 120 min.\nSet up the mass spectrometer conditions. The instrument described in these steps is an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher).\nIonize eluting peptide with an EASY-Spray ionization source (Thermo Fisher) held at +2.2 kV compared to ground. Use the integrated column heater on the EASY-Spray source to hold the column temperature at 45°C.\nHold the inlet capillary temperature at 275°C.\nCollect survey scans of peptide precursors in the Orbitrap from 350–1500 m/z with an AGC target of 1,000,000, a maximum injection time of 50 ms, and a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z.\nEnable Monoisotopic precursor selection for peptide isotopic distributions.
