    "1. Automated solid-phase synthesis of 5′-hydroxyl oligonucleotides on a solid support\nPrepare the automated DNA/RNA synthesizer with reagents and phosphoramidites according to the target oligonucleotide composition and instrument instructions.\nLoad a synthesis column containing solid-support onto the synthesizer and synthesize oligonucleotides according to the synthesizer instrument protocols.\n\tNOTE: The triphosphorylation procedure has been optimized for oligonucleotides prepared at the 1 µmole scale.\nRemove the 5′-dimethoxytrityl protecting group to yield the solid-supported oligonucleotide 5′-hydroxyl as part of the oligonucleotide synthesis in the previous step, or by performing a terminal detritylation step according to the synthesizer instrument protocols.\nRemove the column containing the 5′-hydroxyl oligonucleotide on solid support from the synthesizer, dry under a house vacuum for 10 min to remove residual solvent, and proceed to triphosphorylation (sections 3 and 4) once materials for triphosphorylation are prepared (section 2).\n\tNOTE: If not used immediately, the dried column can be stored under a normal atmosphere in a sealed plastic container with desiccant at -20 °C. Further drying is not needed at this stage as the column is thoroughly dried prior to triphosphorylation in section 3.\n2. Preparing materials for triphosphorylation\nAttach a dry argon source with adjustable pressure to a gas manifold with at least two lines and connect to a bubbler. Ensure that the lines terminate in 1 mL plastic syringes to facilitate connection to the reaction apparatus.\nGather equipment to be used during triphosphorylation, including 1 mL plastic syringes, a three-way polypropylene stopcock, noncoring needles, 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes, and a small metal spatula. Store them in a sealed container or desiccator with desiccant at room temperature for at least 1 day prior to use.",
    "Prepare 30 mL each of anhydrous 1,4-dioxane, 3:1 dioxane:pyridine by volume, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and acetonitrile (ACN) in dried 30 mL glass bottles with drying traps (4 Å molecular sieves in sealed membrane packets) at least 1 day prior to use. Seal with rubber septa, and store in a desiccator with desiccant.\nStore solid 2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one (salicyl phosphorochloridite, SalPCl) in its original container inside a sealed jar with desiccant at 4 °C. Always flush the container with argon between uses.\nPrepare a tributylammonium pyrophosphate (TBAP) solution at least 5 days in advance of the triphosphorylation reaction:\n\t\nWeigh 1-5 g of solid TBAP in a dried 30-mL glass bottle and dissolve in 1 mL of DMF and 0.5 mL of tributylamine per g of TBAP.\nAdd three drying traps, seal the bottle with a rubber septum under argon, and bubble with argon for 30 min to degas.\nStore inside a sealed jar with desiccant at 4 °C for 5 days to allow the molecular sieves to absorb all trace water. Store the jar at -20 °C and prepare fresh after 6 months.\n3. Assembling and using the triphosphorylation apparatus\nAllow the synthesis column to warm to room temperature if retrieving from storage at -20 °C.\nAssemble the reaction chamber shown in Figure 2:\n\t\nPrepare the antechamber: remove the plunger from a dry 1 mL syringe, cut off the top of the syringe using scissors or a razor blade, and attach the syringe to the synthesis column. Attach the three-way stopcock to the top of the syringe and attach the side inlet of the stopcock to the dry argon source with the bubbler, so that the top inlet of the stopcock is the reagent injection port.",
    "Secure this apparatus to a stand with clamps and seal all upstream joints with wax sealing film. Adjust the stopcock so that the injection port is closed, and the apparatus is open to the argon source. Close the bubbler, and allow argon at low pressure (<10 psi) to stream through the reaction chamber for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple reaction chambers can be set in parallel to triphosphorylate 2-4 oligonucleotides. However, one line from the manifold should be reserved for supplying argon to the reagent bottles.\nReopen the bubbler and attach a syringe to the bottom of the synthesis column, which will be the waste syringe. Pull argon through the column repeatedly using the waste syringe; then, reattach the syringe with the plunger pushed fully in.\n\t\tNOTE: Unless loading reagents, the stopcock should be set so that the injection port is closed and the apparatus open to the argon source, as shown in Figure 2A. Similarly, the waste syringe should be attached and the joint to the synthesis column sealed with wax sealing film unless actively removing reagents.\nTo add a reagent or solvent:\n\t\nAttach a needle to the dry argon source and insert it into the reagent or solvent bottle septum, taking care not to immerse the needle in the bottle contents.\nAssemble a dry syringe with a needle and insert it into the reagent or solvent bottle septum, without immersing it into the bottle contents. Fill the syringe with argon, withdraw the needle from the septum, and expel the argon. Fill the syringe with argon and expel again; then, fill the syringe with the required volume of solvent or reagent under argon pressure.",
    "Adjust the stopcock on the apparatus so that the argon source is closed, and the injection port is open (Figure 2B). Quickly remove the filled syringe and needle from the source bottle, wipe away any solvent stuck to the side or tip of the needle, and insert the needle into the injection port. Expel the reagent into the antechamber of the apparatus, remove the needle, and close the injection port, reopening the apparatus to the argon source.\nGently draw the liquid from the antechamber all the way through the synthesis column using the waste syringe so that all liquid is now held in the waste syringe. Now, slowly push the solution back up into the synthesis column, ensuring no gas bubbles are in the column. To mix or agitate, gently pull the solution up and down over the column with the waste syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Always move liquid slowly and gently through the reaction chamber to ensure that no seals are broken, which allows air to enter the apparatus.\nTo remove a reagent or solvent from the column:\n\t\nSlowly pull the solution into the waste syringe. After the bulk of the solution has passed into the waste syringe, pull argon through to flush the remaining solvent from the column.\nRemove the wax sealing film around the waste syringe joint, then remove the syringe and discard the waste solution. Replace the waste syringe with a new, dry syringe, and reseal the joint with wax sealing film.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63877/63877fig02.jpg",

On-column triphosphorylation of synthetic 5′-hydroxyl oligonucleotide\nRemove the SalPCl and TBAP solution from storage at -20 °C and allow them to warm to room temperature before use.\nAdd 200 µL of pyridine/dioxane to the antechamber, according to steps 3.3.1-3.3.3. However, do not load solvent onto the synthesis column until step 4.4.\nUse a dry metal spatula to weigh 6-12 mg of SalPCl into a dry 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and dissolve in 100 µL of dioxane by gently syringing the solvent up and down within the microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd the dissolved SalPCl to the antechamber and load it onto the synthesis column, following step 3.3. Let it react for 15 min, agitating the solution every 5 min. Remove and discard the SalPCl solution according to step 3.4.\n\tNOTE: SalPCl is added in large excess and will scavenge any water absorbed during preparation and loading into the reaction chamber. However, the introduction of any moisture during steps 4.5 and 4.6 will compromise the final oligonucleotide 5′-triphosphate yield.",
    "Add 250 µL of TBAP solution to the antechamber and load it onto the synthesis column, following step 3.3. Let it react for 20 min, agitating every 5 min. Remove and discard the TBAP solution according to step 3.4.\nWash the column with 0.5 mL of DMF, then 0.5 mL of ACN, removing the solvent after each addition according to steps 3.3 and 3.4.\nAdd 250 µL of oxidizer solution (0.1 M iodine in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/pyridine/water, 88:10:2) to the antechamber and load it onto the synthesis column, following step 3.3. Let it react for 30 min, agitating every 10 min. Remove and discard the oxidizer solution according to step 3.4.\nWash the column with 0.5 mL of ACN and remove, according to steps 3.3 and 3.4.\nDisassemble the reaction apparatus. Wash the synthesis column with 5 mL of ACN and dry the column.\n5. Cleavage from solid support, deprotection, and purification\nRemove the dried solid support resin from the synthesis column and transfer it to a 1.5 mL polypropylene screw-cap sealable tube with a silicone o-ring.\nSuspend the resin in 1 mL of a 1:1 mixture of 28%-30% aqueous ammonia and 40% aqueous methylamine (AMA) and seal the tube tightly. Incubate at 65 °C for 10 min with intermittent mixing by gentle inversion39. Use a milder treatment at room temperature for 2 h for oligonucleotides longer than 40 nt.\n\tCAUTION: Heating of the AMA solution will put the tube under high pressure. If the tube is not sealed tightly or does not use an ammonia-compatible (silicone) o-ring, the tube may vent gas or leak solvent, potentially compromising safety or the final product yield. Never open the tube while it is above ambient temperature, as hot AMA solution can violently evolve gas.",
    "Chill the tube on ice and briefly centrifuge it (6,000-12,000 × g for 10 s). Remove the supernatant from the resin, filter through a syringe equipped with a 0.2 µm filter, and transfer to a new, sterile polypropylene tube. Evaporate the solution to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge fitted with an ammonia-neutralizing chemical trap.\n\tNOTE: If the synthetic oligonucleotide does not contain any RNA nucleotides with 2′-silyl protecting groups, skip to step 5.8.\nRemove silyl protecting groups by dissolving the dried material in 1 mL of 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF, heating to 55 °C, shaking if necessary to fully dissolve the oligonucleotide, and incubating at room temperature for 16-24 h40,41.\nQuench the TBAF solution with 1 mL of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and remove THF using a vacuum centrifuge.\nRemove TBAF salts using a disposable size exclusion column, following the manufacturer's instructions. For oligonucleotides shorter than 15 nt, confirm elution of the product by collecting the eluate in fractions, and identifying the main product fractions by absorbance at 260 nm on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nConcentrate the deprotected RNA oligonucleotide by lyophilization or vacuum centrifuge if less than 15 nt, or by ethanol precipitation if greater than 15 nt.\nPrepare a preparative scale 10%-20% polyacrylamide/8 M urea/1x TBE gel using 19:1 mono:bis acrylamide stock, according to the appropriate protocols for oligonucleotide size, gel plate, and stand. Assemble the gel plate in the gel stand with 1x TBE in reservoirs and pre-run at 35 W (or as appropriate for gel plate format) for at least 30 min.",
    "Dissolve the solid oligonucleotide in urea gel loading buffer (8 M urea, 10% sucrose, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA with bromophenol and xylene cyanol running dyes) and heat to 80 °C. Load on the polyacrylamide gel and run for 1-2 h at 25-35 W (or as appropriate for the gel plate format and oligonucleotide size).\n\tNOTE: Bromophenol blue or xylene cyanol should be excluded from the gel loading buffer for oligonucleotides shorter than 15 nt if either co-migrates with the product, as it is difficult to remove these dyes from the eluted oligonucleotide without ethanol precipitation.\nWhen gel electrophoresis is completed, remove the gel plate from the gel stand, disassemble the gel plate, and wrap the gel in polyvinylchloride film. Identify the product bands by back-shadowing with 254 nm UV light, and excise the major product band using a razor blade.\nExtract the oligonucleotide from the excised gel by the crush and soak method42.\n\t\nCrush the excised gel by extruding it through a plastic syringe or mechanically.\nFor oligonucleotides longer than 15 nt:\n\t\t\nElute in 3x volumes of crush and soak buffer (300 mM NaCl; 10 mM Tris, pH 8; 1 mM EDTA) for at least 12 h with agitation or shaking.\nRemove solid gel pieces by passing the solution through a syringe fitted with a 0.2 µm filter and concentrate the oligonucleotide by ethanol precipitation.\nFor oligonucleotide shorter than 15 nt:\n\t\t\nElute in 3x volumes of nuclease-free water for at least 12 h with agitation or shaking.\nRemove solid gel pieces by passing the solution through a syringe fitted with a 0.2 µm filter and concentrate by lyophilization.\nRemove residual salts and solutes using a disposable size exclusion column as in step 5.6. Concentrate by lyophilization.",
    "Store purified triphosphorylated oligonucleotides at -20 °C in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8; 1 mM EDTA) or in a similar oligonucleotide storage buffer.\n\t\nDetermine the concentration of the oligonucleotide by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: The estimated extinction coefficient of the oligonucleotide should not be affected by its 5′-phosphorylation state, and can be calculated from its sequence using an oligonucleotide extinction coefficient calculator.\nVerify triphosphorylation by mass spectrometry. Look for an expected mass of +239.94 Da relative to that of the 5′-hydroxyl oligonucleotide.\n\t\tNOTE: Either matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS or ESI-MS, respectively) are suitable for identifying the triphosphorylation state of the oligonucleotide when using protocols optimized for nucleic acids. ESI-MS provides more consistent results, however, due to lower rates of ion fragmentation; a representative commercial service is provided in the Table of Materials.\n6. Triphosphorylated oligonucleotides as substrates for ribozyme self-replication\nCAUTION: 32P is a radioactive isotope and the following steps should be performed using standard safety protocols for working with radioactive materials in a laboratory and by a researcher certified for use of radioactive materials by the relevant Environmental Health and Safety departments. As an alternative, self-replicating ribozyme substrate A can be prepared synthetically with a 5′-fluorescein label14 and imaged fluorescently, as in step 7.9.\nPrepare solution A as a mixture of self-replicator ribozyme E and 5′-32P-labeled RNA substrate A14 to concentrations of 0.30 µM and 30 µM, respectively. Prepare solutions B-transcribed and B-synthetic with 15 µM triphosphorylated RNA substrate B, prepared by in vitro transcription14 or chemical triphosphorylation as above, respectively, in 75 mM EPPS buffer, pH 8.5, and 37.5 MgCl2. Bring both solutions to 42 °C.\n\tNOTE: All RNA components are listed in the Table of Materials.",
    "To initiate self-replication, rapidly mix 5 µL of solution A with 10 µL of solution B-transcribed or B-synthetic to a final concentration of 0.1 µM E, 10 µM A, 10 µM B, 25 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM EPPS buffer, pH 8.5. Incubate the reaction mixture at 42 °C.\nAt regular intervals, take 0.5 µL aliquots and quench in 9.5 µL of formamide gel loading buffer (95% formamide; 10 mM EDTA, pH 8).\nPrepare an analytical polyacrylamide/8 M urea/1x TBE gel, according to appropriate protocols for the gel plate and stand. Assemble the cast gel and plate in a gel stand, fill the reservoirs with 1x TBE, and prerun at 40 W (or as appropriate for different gel plates and stands) for 30 min.\nHeat the quenched reaction samples to 80 °C, load 5 µL of the sample in each well, and run the gel at 40 W for approximately 40 min (or as appropriate for different gel plates and stands).\nRemove the gel plate from the gel stand, disassemble, and wrap the gel in polyvinylchloride film. Cover the gel with a phosphor screen and expose for 1 h (or as appropriate for 32P cpm); scan the screen using a fluorescent/phosphorescent gel scanner.\nQuantify the reaction yield using gel image quantification software.\n\t\nOpen the gel image using the Analysis Toolbox, choose Analysis | Shape Definition, select Areas | the rectangle shape, and draw rectangles of the same size around bands corresponding to unreacted A and product E for each time and both reactions.\nChoose Analysis | Background Subtraction, select Areas | the rectangle shape, and draw a rectangle of the same size in an empty portion of the gel image. Change the background subtraction method for all rectangles to Image Rectangle.",
    "Choose Window | 2 Area Window, then Edit | Export to Excel to export the quantified band pixel volumes to a spreadsheet file.\nPlot the concentration of product E versus time, and fit the data to the logistic growth Eq (1) using statistical data-fitting software:\n\t[E] = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63877/63877eq01.jpg (1)\n\tWhere a is reaction maximum extent, b is degree of sigmoidicity, and c is exponential growth rate.\n\t\nIn the exported spreadsheet, divide the product E volume by the sum of substrate A and product E volumes to determine the fractional yield of product for each time and both reactions. Multiply by the initial concentration of substrate A (10 µM) to determine the yield of product E as a function of time.\nIn statistical data-fitting software, choose File | New | New Project File, select XY under New Table & Graph, and click Create. Enter the reaction times and product E yields for both reactions in adjacent columns, and label columns correspondingly (e.g., \"time\", \"transcribed B\", \"synthetic B\").\nChoose Insert | New Analysis, select XY analyses | Nonlinear regression (curve fit) then click OK.

    "Prepare 10 µL of RNA solution containing 20 µM D-RNA 27.3t cross-chiral polymerase, 2 µM 5′-fluorescein-labeled L-RNA primer, 4 µM biotinylated L-RNA hammerhead template, and 20 µM each of L-RNA pppCUG, pppAUG, pppAGG, and pppCGC, in 10 µL of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3. Anneal the RNA by heating it to 90 °C for 1 min and cooling to 23 °C at 0.2 °C/s in a PCR thermocycler. See the Table of Materials for details about the polymerase, primer, and template.\nIncubate the RNA solution at 17 °C and start the reaction by adding 10 µL of 2x start buffer (400 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3). Ensure that the final concentrations of all components of the reaction are 10 µM polymerase, 1 µM primer, 2 µM template, 10 µM each trinucleotide 5′-triphosphate, 200 mM MgCl2, 250 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3.\nAs the reaction proceeds, take 10 µL aliquots and quench with 5 µL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.\nTo each quenched reaction sample, add 0.1 mg of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (20 pmol biotin-oligonucleotide binding capacity) suspended in 10 µL of 1 M NaCl in TE buffer with 0.05% neutral detergent to capture trimer-extended primers via the biotinylated template and incubate for 30 min at room temperature with shaking.\nCapture the beads on a bead-capture magnet, remove and discard liquid, and add 50 µL of wash solution (250 mM NaCl in TE with 0.05% neutral detergent). Mix the beads, capture them again, and remove the wash solution. Repeat once more.",
