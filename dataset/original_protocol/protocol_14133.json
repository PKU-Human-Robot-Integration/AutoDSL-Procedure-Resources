    "The exact radiation therapy planning and delivery protocol will vary by disease site and may even require individualization for each patient. Moreover, the procedure may also require modifications to accommodate institutional preferences and equipment availability. For the purpose of this discussion, we will outline the steps used for proton planning in a typical prostate cancer case since this is the most common cancer treated with proton therapy at U.S. centers18. This protocol describes standard-of-care clinical procedures, and so does not require institutional approval by human research ethics committee.\n1. Computed Tomography Simulation for Radiation Treatment\nInsert the extended tabletop into the treatment table and ensure that it is locked.\nPlace an inflated immobilization cushion over the table top and indexing bar for the leg mold at the level of the patient’s knee.\nPlace a solid head rest at the top of the table. Start with F size head, which accommodates most patients.\nConfirm that the patient has completed the full bladder process by drinking 16 -24 ounces of fluid 45 min prior to the scheduled scan time. This step needs to be completed prior to Step 1.12.\nRegister the patient into CT Patient Registration system.\nSelect prostate scanning protocol with the slice thickness of 3 mm.\nConfirm that the treatment consent, contrast consent and simulation order have been completed by the attending physician.\nAsk the patient to change into a gown and remove all clothing from the waist down.\nConfirm the patient identification by verbally verifying the patient’s name, date-of-birth, and procedure site.\nTake a face photo of the patient.\nAsk the patient to sit on the table and then assist the patient into a supine, head-first position.",
    "Place the patient’s legs into the inflated immobilization cushion and position the patient’s arms on the chest by interlacing their fingers, giving them a blue ring, or applying straps around their arms.\nConfirm the patient alignment with the laser system.\nConnect the dual vacuum pump to the nozzle of the immobilization cushion.\nPlace the legs in the immobilization cushion so that the mold will envelop the side of the legs and also create a barrier between the legs. Ensure that the immobilization cushion is below the pelvis and extends past the feet.\nInsert and inflate ab endorectal balloon if clinically indicated per treating physician.\nPerform anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) scout kilovoltage X-ray images (topograms) to confirm that patient alignment is optimized. This includes the verification of straightness on the AP image and rotational alignment on the lateral image. Use both images to ensure that bowel gas is minimal. Positioning should all be corrected and confirmed with re-imaging. If bowel gas is present and excessive, excuse the patient to the restroom and restart the process from Step 1.15.\nOnce the patient is in the desired position, remove the air from the immobilization cushion using the Q-fix dual vacuum pump to form a solid mold around their legs and feet.\nManually adjust the treatment table so that the laser crosshairs are at the level of the patient hips and at the midline of the hips and abdomen at the level of the hip joint. Specify the crosshair locations on the patient using a marking pen. Place the localization markers at the crosshairs to designate a starting point for verification simulation during radiation delivery.\nSet CT scanning parameters to include the pelvic region from the L3 spine to the mid-femur.\nScan the patient using the prostate scanning protocol.",
    "Confirm that the scan is acceptable for treatment planning. The bladder should be full, and the rectum should have minimal air or stool.\nExport the digital scan file to the treatment planning software and notify dosimetry.\nLabel the patient immobilization cushion with the patient ID, treating physician name, and setup instructions prior to storage for subsequent use during therapy.\nProceed to Step 2.1 if the patient is undergoing pencil beam proton therapy. Skip to Step 3.1 if the patient will receive passive scatter proton therapy.\n2. Radiation Treatment Planning Using Pencil Beam Therapy\nImport the CT simulation data into the treatment planning software (TPS).\nUse treatment planning system contouring tools to define all relevant geometric volumes based on acquired CT images. These structures include the bladder, rectum, large bowel, small bowel, femoral heads, outer body surface, fiducials, rectal spacer, and/or endorectal balloon.\nCreate an additional external contour, which includes the body, the treatment table, and any immobilization devices. Radiation dose will only be calculated within this contour.\nContour the first clinical target volume (CTV1) to include the prostate, seminal vesicles, and involved lymph nodes. The CTV1 will be prescribed 45.0 Gy (RBE). The CTV1 volume will have the appearance of a U-shaped structure on axial images. Small bowel, rectum, and bladder normal tissues will reside within the U-shaped target volume.\nContour the second clinical target volume (CTV2) to include the prostate and seminal vesicles. The CTV2 will be prescribed a total dose of 34.2 Gy (RBE).\nSelect three beams at gantry angles of 90, 180 and 270 degrees for the treatment of the CTV1 volume. Select only the 90 and 270 degree beam angles for CTV2 treatment.\nDesign two geometric blocking structures (avoidance volumes).\n\t\nCreate a “mid-block” avoidance volume encompassing the normal tissues within the U-shaped CTV1 volume.",
    "Block the inferior aspect of the posterior-anterior (180 degree) beam below the level of the top of the prostate using a “rectum-block”.\nCreate an isotropic 7-mm expansion of the CTV1 to form a proton planning target volume, named pPTV1. Use the pPTV1 to define a spot placement volume such that the proton Bragg peaks (also referred to as proton “spots”) are positioned by the planning optimizer to cover the CTV1.\nAs in Step 2.6, create a similar expansion of the CTV2 volume to form pPTV2, but use 8-mm expansion in the left-right direction and 5-mm expansions in both the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions.\nTo enable robust optimization, a feature that can account for setup uncertainties, range uncertainties, and the variable gas filling of the intestine, create two artificial (“overridden”) CT data sets: the first has the entire small intestine, large intestine, and rectum overwritten to the density of air, and the second has those volumes overwritten to the density of muscle.\nPrior to optimization, create a new treatment plan for the CTV1. Designate the proton treatment machine to be used for planning, assign the prescribed dose and fractionation of 45 Gy (RBE) in 25 fractions, and define the primary target to be the CTV1. Assign 100% of the prescribed dose to cover at least 98% of the CTV1 volume using all 3 beams (right lateral, left lateral and posterior-anterior).\nCreate another treatment plan for the CTV2 with 2 beam sets. First, assign 18 Gy (RBE) to be delivered in 10 fractions to the CTV2 using only the left lateral beam, and assign 16.2 Gy (RBE) to be delivered in 9 fractions to the CTV2 using only the right lateral beam. Assign 100% of the prescribed dose to cover 100% of the CTV2 volume.",
    "Prepare for the optimization of the CTV1 plan\n\t\nAssign the mid-block structure as a range margin for the lateral beams and assign the rectum-block structure as a range margin for the posterior-anterior beam.\nStart the optimization with automatic (default) settings for energy layer spacing, spot spacing, and target margin.\nSpecify a maximum number of iterations of 40, a maximum number of optimizations before “spot filtering” of 10, and a minimum spot weight of 1.5 monitor units. Spot filtering removes proton spots with less than 1.5 monitor units, as there is a technical minimum limit on the number of protons that can be delivered by the treatment machine.\nIn the first round of optimization for the CTV1, designate the target as the pPTV1 to establish the grid of proton spot positions. The specified objectives are 45.5 Gy (RBE) (weight = 100) to the pPTV1 and a dose falloff of 45 to 0 Gy (RBE) within a distance of 1 cm (weight = 2).\nBegin a second round of optimization for CTV1, by deleting the pPTV1 objectives above. Then resume optimization with the new objectives and objective weights. Specify these parameters as follows to develop an intensity modulated plan, also known as Multi-field Optimization (MFO).\n\t\t\nFor the external volume, set a dose falloff of 45 to 0 Gy (RBE) within a distance of 1 cm and with a weight of 2.\nFor the CTV1 volume, set a minimum dose of 45 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 100.\nFor the CTV1 volume, set a uniform dose of 45.5 Gy (RBE) and a weight of 100. Set this objective as robust.\nFor the pPTV1 volume, set the maximum dose at 46 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 100 and set this objective as robust.",
    "For the rectum volume, set a maximum dose of 45.8 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 50. Set this objective as robust.\nFor the bladder volume, set a maximum dose of 45.8 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 50. Set this objective as robust.\nFor the small bowel, set a maximum dose of 45.8 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 50. Set this objective as robust.\nFor the large bowel, set a maximum dose of 45.8 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 50. Set this objective as robust.\nIn addition to the specific objectives, assign robustness settings to mitigate 5-mm positional shifts, 3.5% range uncertainty, and incorporate the artificial (“overridden”) CT data mentioned above to address bowel gas variability. Apply these robustness settings only to those objectives specified above as “robust”.\nComplete the optimization for the CTV1 plan and review the resulting optimized plan to ensure that the prescription goals have been achieved.\nPrepare for optimization of the CTV2 plan\n\t\nComplete the first optimization for the CTV2 plan using the pPTV2 to achieve a spot placement grid as the CTV1 plan.\nDelete the pPTV2 objectives and resume the optimization with new objectives (percentages are with respect to the prescription for the CTV2). For the CTV2 plan, optimize these objectives for the left and right beam individually. This is known as Single Field Optimization (SFO) and the objectives for each beam are as follows.\n\t\t\nFor the external volume, set a dose falloff of 34.2 Gy (RBE) to 0 Gy (RBE) within a distance of 5 mm and a weight of 2.\nFor the CTV2 volume, set a minimum dose of 34.37 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 120.\nFor the CTV2 volume, set a uniform dose of 34.54 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 100. Set this objective as robust.",
    "For the pPTV2 volume, set a maximum dose of 34.88 Gy (RBE) with a weight of 100. Set this objective as robust.\nUse the same robustness settings for the optimization.\nComplete the optimization separately for the left and right lateral beams to create 2 plan beam sets. This will permit the delivery of radiation to CTV2 using either the left or right lateral beams. This is in contrast to CTV1 dose delivery, which requires all 3 beams (RL, LL, and PA) to be used for every treatment.\nReview the CTV1 and CTV2 treatment plans independently and in summation to ensure that they meet the dose constraints for prostate cancer irradiation established by the RTOG 0126 trial19.\n\t\nFor the bladder volume, ensure that the percentage of tissue receiving 80 Gy is under 15%, the percentage receiving 75 Gy is below 25%, the percentage receiving 70 Gy is under 35%, and the percentage receiving 65 Gy is less than 50%.\nFor the rectal volume, ensure that the percentage of tissue receiving 75 Gy is below 15%, the percentage receiving 70 Gy is under 25%, the percentage receiving 65 Gy is less than 35%, and the percentage receiving 60 Gy is below 50%.\nFor the penile bulb volume, ensure that the mean dose is under 52.5 Gy.\nFor the CTV1 and CTV2 target volumes, ensure that at least 95% of both volumes receive the prescribed dose.\nIf the plans and dose distributions meet accepted dose constraint guidelines and robustness, obtain physician approval and export the plans to the treatment delivery system.\nMeasure to confirm the accuracy of the planned dose using ionization chamber arrays, a type of radiation detector.\nVerify the accuracy of the dose calculation using a secondary, independent dose calculation software.",
    "Review the measurement results, calculation results, and technical properties of the plan with a medical physicist to ensure quality control.\nGenerate the treatment planning documents and approve them by the planning dosimetrist, physicist, and supervising physician.\nExport all treatment planning data to the treatment delivery system for patient treatment and skip to Step 4.1 for proton therapy delivery.\n3. Radiation Treatment Planning for Passive Scatter or Uniform Scanning Proton Therapy:\nImport CT simulation data into the radiation treatment planning system.\nContour all relevant geometric volumes based on acquired CT images. These structures include the bladder, rectum, large bowel, small bowel, femoral heads, outer body surface, fiducials, rectal spacer, and/or endorectal balloon.\nCreate an additional external contour. Use the Boolean Operation tool to include the body, the treatment table, and any immobilization devices. Radiation dose will only be calculated within this contour.\nContour CTV1 to include the prostate, seminal vesicles, and involved lymph nodes. The CTV1 will be prescribed 45.0 Gy (RBE).\nContour CTV2 to include the prostate and seminal vesicles. The CTV2 will be prescribed a total dose of 34.2 Gy (RBE).\nExpand CTV1 by 7 mm to create pPTV1 and create pPTV2 by expanding CTV2 by 7 mm in all directions except 5 mm posteriorly.\nCreate beams on the treatment planning system to target pPTV1 and pPTV2. pPTV1 will be targeted using a single 180° PA beam while pPTV2 will be targeted using 90° and 270° lateral beams.\nAdd blocks for each beam with a uniform margin of 0.5 cm to pPTV1 and pPTV2 volumes.\nUsing the block size select the smallest beam aperture size possible based on the size of each pPTV volume. The beam aperture is the brass custom cutout which will be attached to the gantry snout to shape lateral edges of each proton beam.",
    "Model appropriate wax compensator required to shape the distal and proximal margins of each proton beam by selecting the appropriate beam parameters as follows.\n\t\nInput a range uncertainty value of 3.5% plus an additional 1-2 mm.\nInput the appropriate air gap distance between the aperture and patient.\nSmooth and smear the compensator shape to the desired dose gradient.\nSet the isocenters for pPTV1 and pPTV2 to the same location with the goal of minimizing patient shifts required for proton beam delivery.\nCalculate the dose using parameters entered in Steps 3.10.1-3.10.4 for both the pPTV1 and pPTV2 target plans.\nReview the pPTV1 and pPTV2 treatment plans independently and in summation to ensure that they meet the dose constraints for prostate cancer irradiation established by the RTOG 0126 trial19 and described in Steps 2.17.1-2.17.4.\nIf desired OAR and target goals for dose coverage are not achieved, then adjust block and compensator parameters in the TPS as shown in Steps 3.8-3.10 until the goals are achieved. Once the goals are attained, obtain physician approval and proceed to Step 3.14.\nVerify the accuracy of the dose calculation in the approved plan using a secondary, independent dose calculation software package.\nReview the measurement results, calculation results, and technical properties of the plan with a medical physicist to ensure quality control.\nOrder the blocks and compensators from appropriate vendor.\nQA the blocks and compensators received from the vendor.\nGenerate treatment planning documents and approve them via digital signatures by the planning dosimetrist, physicist, and supervising physician.\nExport all treatment planning data to the treatment delivery system for patient treatment and proceed to Step 4.1.\n4. Radiation Treatment Delivery\nOn the first day of treatment, check to ensure that the radiation plan matches the plan parameters in the treatment system.",
    "Arrange the treatment room to reproduce the patient setup used during CT simulation. Ensure that the immobilization cushion label matches the patient ID and then place on the treatment table with correct indexing. Place the headrest utilized at simulation at the head of the table.\nConfirm with the patient that they have completed the full bladder process and changed into a treatment gown.\nEscort the patient into the treatment room and place him in supine position on the treatment table with hands clasped across the chest and legs in the immobilization cushion.\n\t\nInsert and inflate endorectal balloon if used during simulation.\nElectronically move the treatment table from the load position towards the isocenter to align the patient to the marks that are placed during simulation. Adjust the table to correct any gross errors in patient positioning such as pitch, rotation and yaw.\n\t\nOnce the patient is properly aligned to the simulation marks, complete the shifts from the start position to those determined during the dosimetric treatment planning process to align the patient to the desired treatment isocenter.\nPerform orthogonal KV imaging to ensure proper internal patient alignment to pelvic bones and fiducial markers previously placed by urology within the prostate.\n\t\nDetermine if positional adjustments are required based on overlaying the acquired KV images on digitally reconstructed radiographs from the planning CT simulation scan. Apply necessary shifts to ensure alignment.\nIf KV images demonstrate excessive bowel gas, ask the patient to expel the air while lying on the treatment table if possible, then realign and re-image.\n\t\t\nIf the patient is unable to release on the treatment table, abort the treatment and have the patient go to the restroom. After the patient returns from the restroom, restart the proton delivery process from Step 4.3.",
    "Once acceptable KV images are acquired and confirmed, a cone beam CT (CBCT) scan is completed to assess bladder/rectal filling. Apply additional patient positioning adjustments based on the CBCT scan. As with KV imaging-based positioning corrections, changes made using CBCT data will be sent directly from the imaging console to the treatment table for automated application.\n\t\nVerify all positional corrections with the treating physician before initiating the treatment on the first day of proton therapy.\nInitiate the treatment delivery with audible verification between two therapists of gantry angle, monitor units, number of scanning spots and layers, and snout position for each treatment angle. These parameters are displayed on the treatment console and in the planning documents signed by dosimetry, physics, and the treating physician.\nAfter the treatment, mark the treatment isocenter for daily alignment and remove the marks.\nRepeat Steps 4.2-4.9 for all subsequent treatment fractions."
