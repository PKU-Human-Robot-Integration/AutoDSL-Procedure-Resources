    "Prepare a head holder for surgery. We used a combination of a commercial head holder and a custom-made nose bar to make the OE region accessible for surgery (Figure 1).Anesthetize a mouse using a ketamine/xylazine cocktail in saline (80 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg for ketamine and xylazine, respectively). Inject the ketamine/xylazine cocktail intraperitoneally using a 1-ml syringe and 27 G needle. During surgery, the depth of anesthesia needs to be assessed by the toe-pinch reflex, and supplemental doses should be administered when necessary.Hold the head under a fluorescent stereomicroscope using the head holder.Cover the eyes with Vaseline using a cotton bud to prevent drying.Apply 70% ethanol on the head.Note: This step is required to sterilize the surgical site and to remove hairs in the next step. Remove the scalp together with hairs using scissors and forceps (Figure 2A).Note: The scalp needs to be extensively removed to the back of the head to attach a custom-made head bar at the later step. Note: The hair can be shaved with a razor beforehand. Carefully remove the periosteum from the skull with forceps.Apply superglue to the periphery of the surgical site to prevent the scalp from being caught up by the rotation of the drill.Note: Superglue can harden quickly when PBS is overlaid. A used drill tip is useful for application of superglue and PBS. Carefully thin the skull over the OE using a dental drill (Φ 1 mm drill tip, 5,000-10,000 rpm) (Figure 2A-2D, Video 1).Note: The dorsal and rostral parts of the D zone (zone 1) and the dorsolateral part of the V zone (zone 4) can be imaged (Figure 2B). Other parts are difficult to drill due to the presence of a lot of blood vessels. To avoid overheating, do not continuously thin the same area of the skull.",
    "See Yang et al. (2010) for additional tips on thinned skull preparations. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Thinned-skull preparation for OE imaging. A drill tip was lightly touched to the skull and moved horizontally.Blow away the skull shavings with a dust blower (Video 1).Apply a small amount of PBS on the thinned skull and check if the blood vessels and fluorescence of OSN somata can be clearly observed (Figure 2D-2F).Continue thinning until the fluorescence of OSN somata is observed (Figure 2F, arrows).Note: You can also estimate the thickness of the skull based on the stiffness. If it is thin enough, the skull sinks a little when touched lightly with forceps. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210616/20210616182652_6469.jpgFigure 2. Thinned-skull preparation for in vivo imaging. A. The dorsal scalp was removed from the head. B. The dorsal and rostral parts of the D zone (zone 1) and the dorsolateral part of the V zone (zone 4) in the OE can be imaged. C. A close-up picture of the imaging area over zone 1 in the OE. The skull was thinned in the boxed area (A-C, 3-6 mm from the anterior edge of the olfactory bulb in the 12-week-old male mice). D. Brightfield image of zone 1 in the right OE taken through the thinned skull. The blood vessels should be clearly observed if the skull is sufficiently thinned (white arrows). E. A fluorescence image of zone 1 in the right OE taken by a fluorescent stereomicroscope. F. A close-up image of the square region indicated in (E). Arrows indicate fluorescence from OSN somata.Adjust the head angle to make sure that the dorsal surface of the OE is perpendicular to the light path.Apply superglue to the surface of the skull outside the imaging area to make a scaffold for the attachment of a custom-made head bar.Place ~0.",
    "3 g cement powder into a disposable balance tray. Pour ~0.3 ml cement solution onto the powder using a micropipette. Mix the powder and solution with a toothpick immediately to make the dental cement (Figure 3A).Note: Larger amounts of solution may dissolve the plastic tray. In that case, you can use a small silicone bowl instead. Attach a custom-made head bar perpendicular to the light path using dental cement (Figure 3B).Apply Kwik-sil at the periphery of the imaging area. PBS can be kept here to image using a water-immersion objective lens (Figure 3C).Fix the head under a two-photon microscope using the head bar and a custom-built head holder (Figure 3D) (Guo et al., 2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210616/20210616182749_7923.jpgFigure 3. Head-fixation under a two-photon microscope. A. Dental cement before (left) and after (right) mixing with a toothpick. B. A custom-made head bar was attached with dental cement perpendicular to the optical axis of the subsequent in vivo imaging. C. Kwik-sil was applied to the periphery of the imaging area to retain PBS during imaging. D. The imaging area was placed under an objective lens using a custom-made head holder.Perform two-photon imaging of odor-evoked responses in OSN somata with a custom-built olfactometer (Figure 4; Video 2). In this example, valeraldehyde was diluted at a concentration of 0.5% v/v in 1 ml mineral oil and soaked in a Kimwipe in a 50-ml centrifuge tube. Saturated odor vapor in the centrifuge tube was delivered to the nose via a Teflon tube at 1 L/min.Notes: The 50-ml centrifuge tube and Teflon tube should be replaced every time the odors are changed to avoid cross-contamination of the odors. We have never performed chronic imaging, but it may be possible (see also Zak et al., 2020). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210616/20210616182830_5718.jpgFigure 4.
