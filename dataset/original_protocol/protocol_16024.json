    "Here, we discuss the preparation of DNA substrates to be used in ligation fidelity experiments using the PacBio Sequel II instrument. This protocol describes the generation of a hairpin substrate with degenerate four-nucleotide overhangs using the Type IIS restriction enzyme BsaI-HFv2. First, a single-stranded precursor oligo is converted to dsDNA by a DNA polymerase (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], step 1 and gel lane 1). After cleanup and analysis of the extended dsDNA oligo, it is cut with BsaI-HFv2 to generate a 5′ four-nucleotide overhang. Cutting the dsDNA substrate leaves the desired ssDNA overhang (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], step 2 and gel lane 2).

    "3 μl 100 U/ml yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase\n1.5 μl dNTPs (10 mM each)\n3 μl Milli-Q water\n2. Incubate 1 hr at 37°C.\nThis will generate ∼15 μg (∼0.31 nmol) of dsDNA.\n3. Add 1 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (final 31 mM) and 34 μl Milli-Q water to bring the reaction volume to 50 μl.\nEDTA stops the polymerase activity through binding of the Mg2+ in the buffer.\nPerform cleanup and bioanalysis\nThese steps describe the cleanup of the reaction using the Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit following the Oligonucleotide Cleanup Protocol. It is important to note that although we use the buffers from this kit, we use 20-μg Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Columns rather than the 5-μg columns in the kit due to the large amount of DNA generated in this protocol.\n4. Add 100 μl Binding Buffer from the kit plus 300 μl ethanol and mix well by gentle pipetting.\n5. Add the entire diluted reaction mixture to the top of a 20-μg Monarch miniprep column.\n6. Centrifuge 1 min at 16,000 × g and discard the flowthrough.\n7. Add 500 μl Wash Buffer to the column.\n8. Centrifuge 1 min at 16,000 × g and discard the flowthrough.\n9. Repeat steps 7-8.\n10. Centrifuge once more for 1 min at 16,000 × g.\nA final centrifugation removes residual ethanol from the column, permitting maximum recovery in the next step.\n11. Transfer column to a clean 1.5-ml LoBind tube.\n12. Add 30 μl Elution Buffer to the column and incubate 10 min at room temperature.\n13. Centrifuge 1 min at 16,000 × g to elute the purified dsDNA extended hairpin (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-tbl-0001]).\n14. Analyze the size, purity, and concentration of the extended precursor oligo using a Bioanalyzer 2100 and accompanying DNA 1000 Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "We generally load 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution on the Bioanalyzer. For Bioanalyzer visualization of the extended dsDNA oligo, see Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001] (gel lane 1). The concentration of the extended precursor stock is typically 2-4 μM (100-200 ng/µl). The oligo is stable for at least 3 years when stored at −20°C.\nIf a Bioanalyzer is not available, purity and concentration can be checked using an agarose gel and Nanodrop instrument (Armstrong & Schulz, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-bib-0001]).\nDigest with BsaI-HFv2 to create degenerate overhangs\n15. Prepare the following digestion reaction in PCR strip tubes and mix by gentle pipetting:\n         \n10 μl 10× rCutSmart buffer\n15 μl 20,000 U/ml BsaI-HFv2\n29 μl 3 μM extended precursor oligo\n46 μl Milli-Q water\nIf concentration of extended precursor oligo is not 3 μM, adjust the volumes of extended precursor and Milli-Q water so the final concentration in the digestion reaction is ∼1 μM (50 ng/μl) in a 100-μl reaction.\n16. Incubate 1 hr at 37°C.\n17. Stop reaction by adding 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (final 25 mM).\n18. Add 200 μl Binding Buffer plus 600 μl ethanol and mix well by gentle pipetting.\n19. Repeat steps 5-14 to purify, concentrate, and analyze the dsDNA product.\nThe purified dsDNA hairpin now contains the randomized overhang for ligation fidelity and bias analysis. Typical recovery is 50%, with expected 30 µl of a solution at 1.5 μM (66.1 ng/μl) in dsDNA library precursor. See Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], gel lane 2 for Bioanalyzer visualization of the pure product.",
    "Below, we describe how used to ligate the 5′ four-base overhang library generated in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001]. First, the library is ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], step 3 and gel lane 3). Next, exonuclease treatment is used to remove potentially convoluting DNA sequences that have not been ligated (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], step 4 and gel lane 4). This ensures that any unligated or partially ligated (on one strand only) DNA is removed from the library. This will also remove any uncut or unextended oligos from previous steps. DNA substrates that have been ligated on both strands will be closed and protected from the exonucleases. At the end of this protocol, the ligation library is ready for PacBio sequencing (see Support Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0004] and 3).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001])\nBsaI-HFv2-cut ligation substrate (5′ four-base overhang, typically ∼1.5 μM, ∼66.1 ng/μl; see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001])\n2,000,000 U/ml (35 μM) T4 DNA Ligase and 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, cat. nos.

Incubate 1 hr at 25°C.\n3. Stop reaction by adding 2.5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (25 mM final).\n4. Purify, concentrate, and analyze the product dsDNA as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001], steps 4-14), but use the 5-μg columns provided with the kit and change the elution volume to 15 μl.",
    "The Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup 5-μg spin columns should be used in this purification step rather than the 20-μg Monarch Miniprep columns as there should only be ∼0.33 μg (∼3.75 pmol) ligated DNA in the sample. We also elute with 15 μl elution buffer to increase the concentration. We typically load 1 µl of the purified ligation reaction on the Bioanalyzer. See Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001], gel lane 3 for Bioanalyzer visualization of the purified ligation reaction.\nTreat with exonucleases\n5.

Incubate 1 hr at 37°C.\n7. Immediately purify, concentrate, and analyze the product dsDNA as described (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001], steps 4-14), but use the 5-μg columns provided with the kit and change the elution volume to 15 μl.\nThe exonuclease treatment removes any DNA that has not been ligated on both strands to produce a closed SMRTbell sequencing substrate, including unligated starting material. The ligated, exonuclease-treated library is typically recovered at ∼30-100 nM (∼3-10 ng/µl).\n8. Dilute library to 1 ng/µl in Milli-Q water for sequencing sample preparation.",
    "Below, we describe the protocol for sequencing the ligation library on the PacBio Sequel II system (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-fig-0001]). Briefly, this protocol includes annealing a sequencing primer to the SMRTbell adapter followed by binding of the polymerase to the primer/SMRTbell junction. We also describe steps taken to maximize reads on the relatively small DNA substrate we are using.\nMaterials\nSequencing Primer v4 (Pacific Biosciences, cat. no. 101-654-600)\n1× Elution Buffer (Pacific Biosciences, cat. no. 100-159-800)\n1 ng/μl ligation library (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0002])\n10× Primer Buffer v2 (Pacific Biosciences, cat. no. 001-560-849)\nSequel II Binding Kit 2.1 (Pacific Biosciences, cat. no. 101-843-000), including:\n               \nSequel II Polymerase 2.1\nSequel Binding Buffer\nSequel dNTPs\nDTT\nSequel Additive\nPacBio SMRT Link 10 software\nPCR tubes\nThermocycler (Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler, cat. no. 1861096)\nCalculate sample setup using SMRT Link\nPacBio has created a software tool called SMRT Link (https://www.pacb.com/support/software-downloads/[href=https://www.pacb.com/support/software-downloads/]) that contains a “Sample Setup” calculator to help calculate the proper volumes of reagents to add during library preparation. In general, we follow the recommendations on this calculator with the noted exceptions of omitting the AMPure PB bead cleanup step and loading a larger quantity of DNA on the SMRT Cells than this tool recommends. Below is a brief protocol describing the inputs for this calculator using SMRT link version 10.2.\n1. Navigate to the SMRT Link 10 portal.\n2. Select “Sample Setup”.\n3. Select “New calculation” and specify a sample name.\n4. Under the “Application” tab, select “<3 kb amplicons”.\n5. Enter the “Available Volume”, “Concentration”, and “Insert Size” in the respective fields.\nWe generally dilute prepared libraries to 1 ng/µl to avoid overconsumption of reagents and small pipetting volumes.\n6. Leave the “Internal Control” field blank.\nWe do not usually add the Internal Control, but it may be helpful for troubleshooting.",
    "7. Enter 100% for the “Cleanup Anticipated Yield”.\n8. Enter 450 pM under “Specify Concentration on Plate”.\nWhile the recommended value here is 40-150 pM, we have found that loading more DNA on the SMRT Cells leads to increased sequencing yield for these short-insert substrates.\n9. Enter 1 under “Cells to Bind”.\nThis is the number of SMRT Cells to be used to sequence this sample. As each SMRT Cell has eight million wells, we have found that using one SMRT Cell per sample is sufficient for this application.\n10. For “Sequencing Primer”, select the recommended v4 primer.\n11. Under “Binding Kit”, select Sequel II Binding Kit 2.1.\nThis is important, as different binding kits are used for different insert lengths. It is crucial to use the Sequel II Binding Kit 2.1 for <3 kb amplicons.\nPrepare ligation libraries for sequencing\nOnce the SMRT Link calculator has the proper inputs, it will determine the volumes of reagents to use for library preparation. Below is the protocol we use for preparation of our ligation fidelity libraries.\n12. Add 1 μl Sequencing Primer v4 to 29 μl 1× Elution Buffer in a PCR tube.\n13. Incubate 2 min at 80°C, then hold at 4°C to condition the primer.\n14. Combine the following in a PCR tube to give a 57-μl reaction volume:\n         \n3.7 μl ligation library sample\n6.8 μl conditioned primer\n11.4 μl 10× Primer Buffer v2\n35.1 μl H2O\n15. Incubate 1 hr at 25°C hr, then hold at 4°C.\n16. Dilute Sequel II Polymerase 2.1 10-fold with Sequel Binding Buffer in a PCR tube.\nFor example, add 1 µl polymerase to 9 µl buffer. The required amount of diluted polymerase may vary depending on the number and concentration of DNA libraries.",
    "17. Combine the following in a PCR tube to give a 103.5-μl reaction volume:\n         \n51.8 μl ligation library sample with annealed primer\n10.3 μl Sequel dNTPs\n10.3 μl DTT\n17.6 μl Sequel Binding Buffer\n3.4 μl diluted Sequel II polymerase\n10.1 μl H2O\n18. Incubate 1 hr at 30°C, then hold at 4°C.\n19. For the final loading dilution, add the following to the 103.5 μl polymerase- and primer-bound ligation library (total volume 116.2, final DNA concentration ∼450 pM):\n         \n11.5 μl DTT\n1.2 μl Sequel Additive\n20. Store prepared library at 4°C for up to 24 hr until loading on the PacBio Sequel II instrument.",
    "Before setting up the Sequel II instrument, the sequencing parameters must be defined in the “Run Design” tab of the SMRT Link online portal. In this portal, you can import the samples that were previously created in the “Sample Setup” tab (they must be locked in that tab to be accessible here). This will autofill most of the required fields. Importantly, we do 10-hr runs with no pre-extension and use the Sequel II Sequencing Plate 2.0. The Run Design also requires an input for “Template Prep Kit” that is not used in this protocol. Thus, we input the recommended “SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0”. A sample should be designed for each sample to be sequenced. Once the sequencing run has been designed, the instrument can be set up for sequencing as described below.\nMaterials\nPrepared libraries with bound PacBio primer/polymerase (450 pM; see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0003])\nSample Plate (Pacific Biosciences, 000-448-888)\nSequel Sample Plate Foil (Pacific Biosciences, 100-667-400)\nALPS 50 V-Manual Heat Sealer (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

Transfer all 116.2 μl of sample into well A1 of the sample plate. If more than one SMRT cell will be used, transfer additional samples to wells B1, C1, and D1 in order.\n2. Seal plate with sample plate foil using the heat sealer according to manufacturer's instructions.\n3. Thaw the sequencing plate at room temperature for 1 hr.",
    "4. At the Sequel II instrument, load the sealed sample plate, thawed sequencing plate, pipette tips, SMRT Cell tray, and mixing plate in their indicated locations.\n5. Remove the cap from a tube of SMRT Cell oil and replace it with a tube septum.\n6. Place the oil in its indicated position with the red line on the tube aligned with the red line on the instrument.\n7. Close the instrument and have it scan for all the materials.\n8. Click “Select Existing Run” and select the designated sample name (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0003], step 3).\nThis will load the run details defined in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0003] and start the protocol.",
    "Following PacBio sequencing, the user will utilize the sequencing data and the following set of scripts to extract overhang pairs in the ligated products from each DNA library. A detailed description of the ligase fidelity computational workflow, with all the necessary custom processing scripts, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/potapovneb/CP-LigaseFidelity[href=https://github.com/potapovneb/CP-LigaseFidelity]. This protocol starts with the subreads.bam file from your run, which can be retrieved via the SMRT Link portal or requested from the sequencing service provider.\n1. Run the split.py script on the subreads.bam file using the following command:\n         \n$ split.py --subread-len 98 --adapter-len 45 --outfile0 subreads.0.txt --outfile1 subreads.1.txt subreads.bam\nThe PacBio SMRT sequencing run produces a subreads.bam file containing individual sequencing subreads for the double-stranded ligation products. The script looks for the longest sequence ...-[subread]-[adapter]-[subread]-[adapter]-... such that both subread and adapter lengths are within expected ranges. The default SMRTbell adapter length is 45 nt, and the subread length for the library generated in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0002] is 98 nt. By default, 25% variation in expected subread and adapter lengths is allowed. The subread names are saved to two separate files: subreads.0.txt and subreads.1.txt. If a different substrate is used, then the correct subread length must be provided using the ‘–subread_len’ option. In our experiments, there are on average 25 subreads per strand.\n2. Use the samtools tool to extract subread sequences to two separate subreads.0.bam and subreads.1.bam files via the following command:\n         \n$ samtools view -N subreads.0.txt --output subreads.0.bam subreads.bam\n$ samtools view -N subreads.1.txt --output subreads.1.bam subreads.bam\nThis script separates the alternating top and bottom strand reads from each well (arbitrary strand designations) into separate files.\n3. Run the PacBio ccs tool on each subreads file using the following commands:\n         \n$ ccs --min-passes=3 subreads.0.bam subreads_ccs.0.bam\n$ ccs --min-passes=3 subreads.1.bam subreads_ccs.1.bam\n$ samtools index subreads_ccs.0.bam\n$ samtools index subreads_ccs.1.bam",
    "This step builds consensus sequences for the two strands from each well and indexes the resulting files. While the individual PacBio subreads can be noisy, the consensus sequences built from multiple subreads are highly accurate. At least three subreads per consensus sequence are required.\n4. Run the summarize_results.py script on the subreads_css.0.bam and the subreads_css.1.bam files using the following command:\n         \n$ summarize_results.py --left-bc 'TTG([ACGT]{6})CGT' --overhang 'TCC([ACGT]{4})GGA' --right-bc 'ACG([ACGT]{6})CAA' --num-passes 3 subreads_ccs.0.bam subreads_ccs.1.bam\nThis step extracts the ligated overhang and the synthesis control region barcode from each consensus sequence. For each consensus strand sequence, the script locates the left barcode region, overhang, and right barcode region using patterns provided in the command line. The script applies a number of filters: (a) overhang and barcode regions must strictly follow the expected patterns, (b) flanking bases in the opposite strands must match exactly, and (c) at least three passes are required for each strand.\nThis script produces nine output data files: 01_fragments.csv, 02_overhangs.csv, 03_barcodes.csv, 04_barcodes-counts.csv, 05_barcodes-percentages.csv, 06_matrix.csv, 07_fidelity.csv, 08_mismatch-e.csv, and 09_mismatch-m.csv. See Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#support-information-section] for example files. See Understanding Results for a discussion of file formats and output data.\nThe input parameters in this step are defined by the substrate sequence used in Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.690#cpz1690-prot-0002]. For the substrate used in the presented protocol, the left synthesis control barcode region is six randomized bases flanked by TTG and CGT (TTGNNNNNNCGT). The corresponding command line input parameter is ‘TTG([ACGT]{6})CGT’. The ligation overhang region is four randomized bases flanked by TCC and GGA (TCCNNNNGGA) and the corresponding input is ‘TCC([ACGT]{4})GGA’. The right barcode region is six randomized bases flanked by ACG and CAA (ACGNNNNNNCAA) and the corresponding input is ‘ACG([ACGT]{6})CAA’. If a different substrate sequence is employed, it is critical to modify these inputs to match the sequence used.",
    "5. Optional: Run the included plot_data.py script to visualize the data in four plots using the following command:\n         \n$ plot_data.py .\nThe plots generated are: (a) a frequency heat map of all ligation events (06_matrix.png), (b) a stacked bar plot showing the frequency of ligation products containing each overhang (07_fidelity.png), (c) the frequency of specific base pair mismatches by position (the edge position; 08_mismatch-e.png), and (d) the frequency of specific base pair mismatches by position (the middle position; 09_mismatch-m.png).
