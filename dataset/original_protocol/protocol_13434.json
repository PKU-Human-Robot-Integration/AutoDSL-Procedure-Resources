    "1. Procedure: preparation\nHave the team establish that the patient is a good candidate for prone positioning with respect to the hemodynamic status.\nObtain a provider order for prone positioning, which should ideally indicate the number of hours in prone position.\nExplain the procedure to the patient (if not sedated) and/or significant other.\n\tNOTE: Consider the time of day and the staff on hand regarding when to begin the proning cycle. This is especially relevant if there are multiple patients on a unit/ward that need to be placed in the prone position8.\nEnsure all the potential participants are notified of the plan, including the RT.\nObtain an arterial blood gas sample for analysis, from an indwelling arterial line, or via arterial puncture prior to the procedure8.\nTransfer the patient onto a pressure-redistributing surface prior to beginning the proning cycle19.\nUse a slide sheet or air transfer matt to avoid caregiver injury.\nIf a feeding tube is in use, check the integrity of the securement or use a bridle to reduce any chance of dislodgement.\nStop the tube feed.\nMeticulously secure all intravascular catheters and place foam dressings on the skin under the hubs and ports if the patient will be lying on them when in the prone position.\n\tNOTE: If the patient is on isolation, initiate a wearable sensor for continuous glucose monitoring, if applicable and available.\nMake note of the length of the ET at the lips or teeth. Remove the headboard.\nIf a commercial ET holder is in use, have the RT and ICU nurse remove this device and secure the tube with tape approved for the securement of critical tubes.",
    "Place foam dressings on the face, including over the cheeks and the top lip, prior to taping the ET tube. Optional: place foam dressings on the chin, nose, and forehead20 (Table 1).\nSuction the ET and mouth and perform oral hygiene.\nApply foam dressings to both knees and any other bony prominences or areas of risk, i.e., sternum and under medical devices that cannot be moved20,21.\nEmpty drains, urinary collection bag, and ostomy pouches.\nIf the patient is pharmacologically paralyzed or if the eyelids are not closed, instill lubrication in eyes, and then close the lids and secure them with gentle tape.\nCheck for immediate availability of a team member who is competent in intubation and the accessibility of an emergency intubation kit, code cart, extra electrodes, extra bed linen, pillows, and foam dressings of various sizes.\nDiscontinue non-essential infusions and monitoring prior to initiating the procedure. Disconnect tube feeding, remove oximetry probe and blood pressure cuff if the patient also has an arterial line, remove leg devices for deep vein thrombosis prevention and heel boot(s), and unhook urinary catheter securement.\nMonitor pulse oximetry or invasive arterial blood pressure throughout the procedure.\nAssess pain and sedation status immediately prior to proning and treat accordingly by administering medication to optimize sedation and prevent pain.\n2. Procedure: supine to prone\nHave the assigned ICU nurse in collaboration with the charge nurse assemble the adequate number of nursing staff; ideally four (two on either side of the bed) plus the RT, but as many staff as available and needed for the patient size, to facilitate a safe procedure. Let the team members introduce themselves, if needed, and discuss each team member's role prior to proceeding.\n\t\nPut the RT in charge of airway at the head of bed (HOB).",
    "Put the ICU nurse in charge of monitoring critical intravascular lines and assisting the RT.\nHave other team members monitoring the drains and other tubes and assisting with linens and roll.\nAssign the wound nurse, or skin champion if available, to direct prevention measures for bony prominences and skin under medical devices and assist with bed linen roll.\nDesignate a team member to watch the monitor.\nHave a healthcare provider available inside or just outside the room, available to reintubate if necessary.\nCheck for securement of chest tubes and any other percutaneous tubes.\nHave the RT or Provider, with the ICU nurse, decide the direction in which the patient will be rolled and communicate it to the other team members.\n\tNOTE: Ideally plan to roll toward the ventilator, away from central venous lines.\nHave the RT/Provider adjust ventilator settings as ordered/required.\nLay the patient flat on the bed in the supine position (Figure 1).\nCreate a bed roll using an extra slide sheet or air transfer pad, flat bed sheet, and under pad. Inflate the mattress to the maximum extent, if applicable.\nUsing the slide sheet or air lift under patient, pull the patient to the edge of the bed that is furthest from the ventilator.\nPlace the bed roll so that it can be unrolled onto the side of the bed that is opposite to the ventilator.\nTuck the linen roll under the patient on the ventilator side. Ensure that only 25%-30% of the roll is tucked under the patient.\nOn the count of the team member at the HOB, carefully roll the patient from supine up to a 90° side-lying position with the patient's face toward the ventilator (Figure 2).\nMove the telemetry electrodes from the patient's chest to the patient's back (Figure 3).",
    "NOTE: Placement of new electrodes on the back can also occur when the patient is lying prone.\nPlace a pillow on the bed that will be positioned under the patient's chest/shoulders.\nIf the patient is inflexible and/or has tight hip flexors, place a pillow under the hip/pelvis and/or an air cushion under the knees.\nOn the count of the team member at the HOB, carefully lay the patient prone with a pillow under the upper chest/shoulders, and center the patient in the middle of the bed with the top of patient's head at the top edge of the bed (Figure 4).\nHave team members at the head of the bed rotate the patient's head either left or right, and place the bed pillow under the head. Ensure that the patient's face is on the very edge of the pillow so that the nose is free from pressure, and there is adequate room for the ET and ventilator tubing for suctioning.\nEnsure that the patient's arms are placed in the swimmer's crawl position: the face is toward the prominent hand, palmar side down, wrist in neutral, elbow lower than the shoulder, and elbow flexed6,22. Ensure that the contralateral arm is extended down alongside the body, with a pillow under the anterior shoulder and arm, palmar side of the hand facing up.\nPlace a pillow horizonal to the patient under both the lower legs to allow the knees to be slightly flexed and disallow extreme plantar flexion and avoidance of pressure injuries on the feet and toes.\nReconnect the monitoring equipment and tubes that were disconnected prior to prone positioning.\nComplete a skin assessment of the sacrum, coccyx, and buttocks. Place a protective foam dressing on the sacrum in anticipation of returning to supine positioning after the prescribed prone time.",
    "Place the bed in reverse Trendelenburg's position, approximately 30° for complication avoidance8,12.\nRestart tube feeding if applicable.\n3. Procedure: position changes while lying prone\nMobilize the patient every 2-3 h for pressure injury avoidance and to optimize the drainage and suctioning of secretions from the lung segments into the central airway.\n\tNOTE: The exact frequency of repositioning of the patient may be influenced by both patient factors, such as hemodynamic tolerance and staffing factors6.\nEnsure the availability of a minimum of three caregivers for position changes. Have the RT take charge of managing the ET and two additional caregivers, one an ICU nurse, assist with mobilizing the patient.\nTake the bed out of the reverse Trendelenburg's position to a flat position, parallel to the floor.\nUsing a slip sheet or air transfer pad, pull the patient up in bed if needed (with mattress inflated to the maximum extent if applicable).\nCarefully move the arm that is bent at the elbow down to the patient's side.\nAfter suctioning the patient's airway and mouth as needed, have the RT secure the ET and lift the patient's head off the pillow.\nWait for the nurse at the HOB to pull out the pillow from under the patient's head while the RT rotates the head to the opposite direction. Ensure that the pillow is flipped or the pillow case changed and the head placed back on the edge of the pillow, with no pressure on the nose or ET.\nBring up the arm on the side that the head is facing is now in swimmer's position, elbow bent and lower than the shoulder, wrist in neutral.",
    "Ensure that the contralateral arm is in neutral alongside the body, with a pillow tucked to support the anterior shoulder and arm, palmar side of the hand facing up.\n\t​NOTE: For an inflexible patient and/or those with limited neck rotation, a pillow can be slightly tucked under the abdomen on the side the head is turned toward to facilitate neck rotation and ensure off-loading of nose and chin.\n4. Procedure: prone to supine\nAssign an ICU nurse to collaborate with the charge nurse in assembling an adequate number of staff to complete the procedure.\n\tNOTE: Typically, at least four staff members are required, but assemble as many as needed for the patient's size and to facilitate a safe procedure. Team members introduce themselves if needed and discuss each team member's role prior to proceeding.\n\t\nEnsure that the RT or Provider is in charge of airway at the HOB.\nPut the critical care nurse in charge of monitoring critical intravascular lines and assisting the RT.\nHave the other team member(s) monitor drains and other tubes and assist with linens and the turn.\nEmpty drains and the urinary collection bag.\nEnsure protective foam dressing is on the sacrum.\nHave a team member watch the monitor.\nHave the provider inside or outside the room, available to reintubate if necessary.\nAllow the decision for the direction in which patient will be rolled to be made jointly by the RT and the critical care/ICU nurse. Roll the patient toward or away from the ventilator, depending on the location of the central venous lines, IV pump locations, and preference of the RT and ICU nurse.\nDisconnect non-critical tubing and devices.\nTake the bed out of the reverse Trendelenburg to a flat position parallel to the floor. Inflate the mattress to the maximum extent, if applicable.",
    "Carefully straighten the arm/hand that is across from the face and gently place it at the patient's side.\nRemove all the pillows from underneath the patient, including the chest, lower legs, and lateral trunk if applicable.\nPull the patient to the side of the bed furthest from the direction of the turn.\nCreate the bed roll with a slip sheet or air transfer pad, flat sheet, or under pad. Roll it up lengthwise and tuck 20% under the patient on the side the patient will roll toward.\nGather extra electrodes/wires for the heart monitor.\nHave the RT adjust the ventilator settings as required/ordered.\nAfter a clear plan for the turn is established, tuck the patient's hand on the side that the patient will be turned toward, palm side up under the thigh.\nCarefully turn the patient 90° onto their side, hold the patient briefly in this position while the heart monitoring electrodes are removed from the back, and new ones are placed on the chest.\n\tNOTE: If preferred, placement of new electrodes can also occur after the patient is lying supine.\nOn the count of the team member at the HOB, gently lower the patient to the supine position.\nReconnect the tubes/monitoring equipment that were removed for the turn.\nHave the RT with the ICU nurse check the positioning of the ET and securement of all intravascular lines, tubes, and monitoring equipment. Adjust the angle of the bed as appropriate.\n\tNOTE: Typically, 30° of head elevation is required.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
