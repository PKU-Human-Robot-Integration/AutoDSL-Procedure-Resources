    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOptimization of inflammation induction\nTiming: 10–12 h\nIn this section, we describe how to optimize the induction of inflammation in THP-1 cells as measured by changes in the expression of certain NF-κB proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy. We begin with a 96-well plate of differentiated THP-1 cells, describe what conditions can be used to stimulate inflammation, and provide an overview of how to measure inflammatory changes using a confocal microscope.\nThis step optimizes drug concentrations and timings for each of the inflammatory markers examined in the confocal studies.\nRemove 96-well plate of differentiated THP-1 cells from the incubator and examine cells under a microscope.\nEnsure that cells are alive and sufficient in number before subsequent steps. Cells should be adherent and spread out.\nLoss of cells or adherence could indicate contamination. If so, dispose of the plate and make a fresh 96-well plate with the next passage of the THP-1 flask.\nTreat the cells with the inflammatory stimulus of your choice.\nNote: We recommend using LPS as it is a well-established inducer of inflammation in THP-1 cells. However, a different compound can be used as well to test whether it has inflammatory activity. For the remainder of the protocol, we will be using LPS at a concentration of 100 ng/mL.\nFor each of the 8 rows of the 96 well plate, add LPS in RPMI media for varying durations. We recommend a spread of early and late time points: 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h.\nChange the media for all 96 wells prior to the addition of LPS at the first time point.\nStart by adding LPS in RPMI media for the 5 h time point wells. Store plate in incubator until next time point.",
    "Add LPS-laden media to each successive time point accordingly. Thus, each time point will have 12 technical replicates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of plate layout after the end of step 7.\nThis layout allows for 8 time points including the control and four antibody stains to be used in triplicate.\nNote: all time points will finish at the same time. Additional wells can be used to test established or novel anti-inflammatory drugs at different concentrations if 12 replicates are not required.\nAt 5 h post addition of LPS for the first time point, remove the plate from the incubator and place in fume hood.\nPrepare the plate for staining.\nRemove contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette and wash once with PBS.\nAdd 100 μL of 4% PFA to each well using a multi-channel pipette to fix the cells.\nNote: To quicken the process, pour an aliquot of the 4% PFA solution into a reagent reservoir well. Use a multi-channel pipette to add PFA to each row/column based on the number of channels available.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nNote: Be gentle when washing the plate wells with PBS. Overly aggressive pipetting may dislodge cells and decrease the number available for study during the confocal microscopy.\nDuring this time, have the Triton X-100 prepared and ready to use.\nRemove contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette and wash once with PBS. Collect PFA waste and dispose in correct waste stream.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.1% Triton X-100 to each well to permeabilize the cells.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nDuring this time, make a fresh solution of 0.1% BSA if not prepared already.\nRemove the contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette and wash once with PBS.",
    "Add 100 μL of 0.1% BSA to each well.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\nDuring this time, make a fresh dilution of primary antibodies. We will be staining for four proteins: p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, and p65.\nNote: Staining for four proteins (p-IkBa, IkBa, p-p65, and p65), would, in this example protocol, require 1.5 mL of primary antibody in 2.5 mL of 0.1% BSA to cover 24 wells (8 conditions in triplicate).\nNote: Be gentle when washing the plate wells with PBS. Overly aggressive pipetting may dislodge cells and decrease the number available for study during the confocal microscopy.\nAssess how many types of secondary antibodies will be used and set aside one well in the control column (without LPS) for each of them.\nNote: For the antibodies we recommended, we will need an anti-rabbit secondary and anti-mouse secondary. Do not add regular primary antibodies to these wells as these will be our controls later in the protocol. Instead, add an IgG antibody control to check for background signal.\nNote: If all antibodies are anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, setting aside one well is sufficient.\nCritical: Ensure that you have at least one IgG antibody control well per secondary antibody used. Without an IgG antibody control, it is difficult to identify true signal from background noise or artifact when examining the plate with the confocal microscope.\nRemove contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette.\nAdd 100 μL of primary antibody per well. Rows 1–3 will be stained for p-IκBα, Rows 4–6 will be stained for IκBα, Rows 7–9 will be stained for p-p65, and Rows 10–12 will be stained for p65.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 1 h.",
    "During this time, make a fresh dilution of secondary antibodies with the ratio 0.6 μL antibody/1 mL of 0.1% BSA.\nAdd one drop of the NucBlue Fixed Cell ReadyProbes Reagent per 1 mL of 0.1% BSA when making the secondary antibody stocks.\nNote: Ensure that the proper final volumes are made for anti-rabbit wells and anti-mouse wells respectively.\nTurn the light off in the fume hood to ensure that the following steps will be performed away from direct light.\nRemove contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette.\nAdd 100 μL of secondary antibody per well.\nNote: All 96 wells will receive one type of secondary antibody, including the IgG antibody controls.\nCover plate with aluminum foil and leave in the dark for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nRemove contents of the plate using a multi-channel pipette and wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS/well. Below is an example of what the plate template appears as at this step in the protocol (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of plate layout prior to confocal microscopy\nThis layout allows for 8 time points including the control. The four antibody stains used are p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, and p65. Note the presence of two IgG antibody controls, one for each secondary antibody isotype.\nPause point: The plate can be stored at 4°C wrapped in foil for 3 months when covered by foil to protect it from light.\nWhen ready, place plate under confocal microscope with 20× lens and open the Zen software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Zeiss Confocal Zen software setup\n(A) The initial landing page that lets the user setup their plate and focus on the cells.",
    "(B and C) (B) Once focused the user can then move on to the second acquisition page where they can select the smart setup option (C) The smart setup requires the user to mention different fluorophores that need to be imaged. Once selected with the “Best Signal” option, the user can further fine tune the exposure settings to get a better image.\nImage the plate with the confocal microscope. Note that the following instructions are intended for the LSM 710 confocal microscope with the Zen blue software. However, the basic steps should be largely applicable for other microscope and software combinations as well.\nLook through the eyepieces and manually focus the first IgG antibody control well onto the DAPI stain using the 408 channel.\nOnce the cells are in focus, close the shutter and proceed to Smart Setup on the Zen software.\nIf too few cells are in view, see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nAdd the DAPI and 647 fluorophores into the program and click on the “Best Signal” setting.\nSet the pinhole size to 1 Airy Unit (AU),\nOptimize the settings for the DAPI signal. Checkmark the DAPI channel and click “live scan”. This will bring up a live video of the well with the DAPI filter.\nFind an area of the field with a few, bright, well-spaced cells. You may need to use the joystick to shift the field and refocus as needed.\nIn the Channels section, increase the digital offset by one unit at a time until the blue pixels in the background of the live feed are gone.\nValues of the digital offset typically stay under 20.",
    "Switch to the Histo display mode. In the graphics tab, draw a region around the brightest cell in the field of view. Adjust Gain (Master) until the brightest pixels in the histogram are in the range of 2000–2500.\nNote: Publication quality images are typically acquired using 12-bit or 16-bit image depth. Knowing the image depth may help researchers interpret the range of the histogram.\nProceed to increase the Gain (Master) and Laser Power until the DAPI stain is clearly visible.\nThe Gain (Master) value should be between 450–850.\nEnsure that the Mean intensity value in the summary statistics does not decrease consistently which would indicate bleaching of the sample.\nEnsure that the image quality is increasing with each adjustment.\nOnce you are satisfied with the quality of the DAPI stain, repeat steps repeat steps e-I for the 647-fluorophore channel.\nFor the IgG antibody control, adjust the settings until the red pixels are just barely visible. These red pixels signify artifact from non-specific staining and should not be used confused with true signal.\nThis will ensure that signal in the samples with primary antibody does not stem from diffuse binding of the secondary.\nIn the Acquisition Mode, set the averaging number = 4 and speed = max value.\nNote: Averaging improves image quality but increases bleaching and the time needed to acquire an image. We’ve found that setting the average number = 4 provides a good balance between quality, bleaching, and time. However, this value can be adjusted based on the individual sample quality as needed. Speed is set to the maximum value to minimize bleaching damage to the sample while averaging. It is generally recommended to set the speed to the maximum value possible. However, speed can be lowered if a slight increase in image quality is desired..",
    "Proceed to automate the confocal microscope to image each of the 96 wells as mentioned below.\nClick on the tile scan option in the left button set. This will open a new dialog box at the bottom of the window where different positional tiles can be saved\nProceed to the center of each of the 96 wells and manually focus on the DAPI channel until the cells are clearly seen.\nClick on the add tile position button present in the tile scan dialog box. This process stores the x, y, and z parameters of the well and allows the microscope to go to each of these wells and take images at the set parameters.\nRepeat steps b and c for every well of the 96 well plate.\nThis process for a 96 well plate takes approximately 15–30 min depending on the efficiency of the operator. Once each of the focal parameters are set, you are ready to move on to the next step.\nNote: This only needs to be performed once per plate. Once performed, this tile scan format can be saved and retrieved as a template for future experiments as well. However, the z focus might change based on cell types and confluency.\nUsing the grid feature of Zen, observe trends in 647 intensities with the following proteins (p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, and p65) across the time points studied.\nIn the classic inflammatory response, levels of…\np-IκBα increase with time.\nIκBα decrease initially and then increase.\np-p65 increase with time.\np65 do not change overall but rather translocation to the nucleus occurs.\nSee troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] if lack of induction occurs.\nSee troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] if variability between samples is too high.\nNote the optimal time points for each protein studied.",
    "These time points may vary based on the cell type used, the induction stimulus, and the concentration of the stimulus. In previous experiments with THP-1 cells and 100 ng/mL LPS, we have noted that the optimal time points were approximately as follows: p-IκBα: 4 h (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), IκBα: minimum value between 15-30 min, p-p65: 4 h, p65: translocation can be observed between 15-30 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. THP cells non-induced or induced with LPS for 4 h show an increase in phosphorylation of IκBα and NFκB (p65)\nScale bar: 100 μm.\nTo obtain more quantitative results, in the Zen software, record the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each image.\nComparisons can be made using ANOVAs to test for significant changes in MFI.\nCritical: Ensuring that all the wells in the 96 well plate are in focus is critical for this experiment to work flawlessly. Ensure that the 96 well plate is not physically touched or reoriented or moved from the motorized holder once the x, y, and z parameters are recorded in the tile scan dialog box. If moved, the operator might have to refocus the entire plate.\nTesting efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs\nTiming: 10–12 h after complete differentiation of THP-1 plate\nIn this section, we describe how to test the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs or compounds to inhibit the inflammatory response with LPS in THP-1 cells. This step is largely derivative of the proceeding one with changes only in the initial plate layout used in the experiment.\nPassage a new 96-well plate of THP-1 cells and remove from the incubator once ready.",
    "Create a plate layout to test the efficacy of a compound in suppressing inflammation induced by LPS (or another compound used in major step 1) using the following guidelines. For clarity, LPS will be the inflammatory agent and PBA will be the example anti-inflammatory drug.\nEach variation should be performed in triplicate which leaves 96/3 = 32 unique combinations.\nTo observe the effect of the anti-inflammatory on levels of p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, and p65, there are 8 unique combinations per protein studied.\nEach protocol should have a control with no LPS and a positive control with LPS only which leaves 6 therapeutic combinations to test.\nProphylactic PBA, simultaneous addition of PBA with LPS, and therapeutic dosing of PBA (removal of LPS and addition of drug) are all combinations that can be studied.\nIncreasing concentrations of PBA can also be studied to observe dose-dependent effects.\nKeep in mind that IgG antibody controls still need to be present.\nIt is perfectly acceptable and even encouraged to have leftover wells if the experiment does not call for all 96 wells to be used. Judicious usage of resources will prevent researchers from overuse of antibodies and other expensive reagents.\nBelow is an example of one such layout (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Layout testing simultaneous addition of PBA at increasing concentrations with LPS at 100 ng/mL in THP-1 cells\nThe four protein markers studied are at the optimized time points from Major Step 1.\nOnce the layout is organized, perform the experiment as designed and repeat steps 4–9 for staining and subsequent confocal microscopy.\nAn anti-inflammatory agent should produce the following changes compared to LPS only:\nReductions in p-IκBα.\nLack of early degradation of IκBα\nReductions in p-p65 increase with time.\nPrevention of p65 nuclear translocation\nTesting for synergy between two drugs",
    "Timing: 10–12 h after complete differentiation of THP-1 plate\nThis optional step allows researchers to test for synergy between two anti-inflammatory drugs. In this example, we test whether PBA and dexamethasone (DEX) have synergistic activity in suppressing LPS-mediated inflammation.\nPassage a new 96-well plate of THP-1 cells and remove from the incubator once ready.\nCreate a plate layout to test the synergistic effects of PBA and DEX (or other anti-inflammatories) on suppressing inflammation induced by LPS (or another compound used in major step 1) using the following guidelines.\nWe recommend using the time points for p-IκBα or p-p65 as they are expected to increase over time with inflammation.\nLevels of p65 and IκBα are more variable which can make interpretation of the results more difficult.\nWe recommend testing 8 concentrations of each drug including no drug added with an 8x8 grid.\nUse 2-fold dilutions of the drug beginning at the highest concentration the researcher would like to test.\nNote: For example, for a maximal concentration of PBA at 20 mM, we would use the following concentrations: 20 mM, 10 mM, 5 mM, 2.5 mM, 1.2 mM, 0.6 mM, 0.3 mM, and 0 mM.\nNote: For a maximal concentration of DEX at 50 μM, we would use the following concentrations: 50 μM, 25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.2 μM, 3.1 μM, 1.6 μM, 0.8 μM, and 0 μM.\nNote: LPS will be added to all the wells in the 8x8 grid.\nNote: An IgG antibody control with RPMI media will be present adjacent to the grid.\nWith the layout in mind, prepare the dilutions in a separate 96-well plate.\nFor a detailed protocol on how to create dilutions for a checkerboard assay, please see this paper by Bellio et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]",
    "In this example, create solutions for PBA that are 8-times and 16-times as concentrated as the maximal concentration of the drug tested.\nNote: In this case, create a 160 mM and 320 mM solution of PBA.\nIn the first column, add 100 μL of the 16x PBA in the first well and 100 μL of the 8x PBA in wells 2–8.\nPerform 2-fold dilutions using a multi-channel pipette for the next 6 rows, omitting the 8th and final row.\nNext, create a stock solution for DEX that is 8x the maximal concentration being tested.\nNote: In this case, create a 400 μM solution of DEX.\nIn the first row, add 100 μL of the 8x DEX to each of the wells.\nPerform 2-fold dilutions using a multi-channel pipette for the next 6 rows, omitting the 8th and final row.\nThe net effect will be the creation of an 8 × 8 grid of dilutions with the highest concentrations in the top left corner of the plate and the drug-free well in the bottom right corner of the plate.\nFinally, add 100 μL of 4x LPS (400 ng/mL in this case) to all 96 wells.\nThe net effect will be the creation of an 8 × 8 grid of dilutions with the highest concentrations in the top left corner of the plate and the drug-free well in the bottom right corner of the plate. LPS concentration will be 100 ng/mL in all 96 wells. Below is a figure illustrating this checkerboard layout (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2739-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Example of a checkerboard grid of dilutions of PBA and DEX to be used for confocal microscopy\nPBA concentrations are given on the left-hand side of the grid, and DEX concentrations are given on the topside of the grid.\n(A) Checkerboard for p-IκBα expression.",
    "(B) Checkerboard for p-p65 expression. Figure taken from Koganti et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nOnce the dilutions are made in a fresh 96-well plate, remove the media from the THP-1 plate. Transfer the dilutions to the THP-1 plate and incubate for the length of time needed for optimal induction of p-IκBα or p-p65 (determined in major step 1).\nOnce the layout is organized, perform the experiment as designed and repeat steps 4–9 for staining and subsequent confocal microscopy.\nSynergistic drug concentrations are indicated by a decrease in inflammation greater than would be expected by the additive effects of each drug.\nNote: Repeating this experiment three times on three different plates can facilitate the application of statistical analysis of the mean fluorescent intensity taken from each of the plates. Alternatively, collecting 3 images per well can also facilitate statistical analysis of the three individual images per plate for improved confidence in the results."
