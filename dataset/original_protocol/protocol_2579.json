    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSample processing is divided into four main steps: DNA isolation, library construction by PCR, amplicon cleaning and dilution, and sequencing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/224-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. .Workflow of 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing Preparation and Analysis\nSteps are structured into three sections: the sample collection and storage, the sample preparation and sequencing, and the sample preprocessing and data analysis. The given time for each step can be seen as a point of reference.\nDNA Isolation\nTiming: approx. 3 h for 24 samples\nDNA is isolated with a modification of the protocol by Godon etal. (1997)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. A blank sample, consisting of 600 μL DNA Stabilizer from Invitek, is processed in every second DNA isolation batch (i.e., one blank sample for each 47 samples).\nThaw fecal samples (ca. 2 g in 8 mL DNA stabilizer) for approximately 2 h at 20°C–22°C.\nVortex until the sample is fully homogenized and let stand for 3 min to sediment debris.\nFor each sample, a volume of 600 μL fecal slurry is transferred into a 2-mL screw cap tube containing 0.1 mm silica beads. Use autoclaved hand-cut blue tips that allow pipetting even in the presence of remaining debris. This aliquot is processed immediately.\nNote: The remaining sample is frozen at −80°C for long-term storage.\nAdd 250 μL 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate to the sample. This step is necessary to denature proteins.\nAdd 500 μL 5% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, which is an ionic surfactant that separates all cellular components from each other.\nIncubate the samples for 60 min at 70°C while shaking at 700 rpm.",
    "Lyse remaining microbial cells by using a FastPrep-24 fitted with a CoolPrep adapter (filled with a handful of dry ice). The FastPrep instrument performs the lysis of biological samples by using an optimized motion to disrupt cells through beating of beads on the sample material.\nProgram: 5\nCycles: 40 s; 6.5 m/s\n3 rounds (add more dry ice between each round)\nAdd 15 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPP), a polymer used for removing phenolics and other fecal contaminants.\nAfter vortexing, centrifuge for 3 min at 15,000 × g and 4°C.\n500 μL of the supernatant is transferred to a new 2-mL tube.\nAdd 5 μL RNase A and incubate for 20 min at 37°C while shaking at 700 rpm.\nThe DNA is then purified using a silica membrane-based approach following the manufacturer's instructions of the kit used (NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-up Kit, REF 740230.250 Machery-Nagel).\nAdd 1500 μL Binding Buffer and vortex for 5 s.\nTransfer each sample to one column: this is performed in three steps with each 650 μL. After each transfer, columns are centrifuged for 30 s (11,000 × g); discard the flow-through.\nWash columns by adding 700 μL Washing Buffer. After 2 s vortex, columns are centrifuged for 30 s (11,000 × g); discard the flow-through. Washing is performed three times.\nDry the silica membrane by centrifuging the columns for 1 min (11,000 × g) and discard the collection tube.\nAdd 50 μL Buffer DE to elute the DNA. Incubate for 1 min and centrifuge for 1 min (as before). Repeat the elution step and pool the flow-through to obtain a final volume of 100 μL with the isolated DNA.\nAfter DNA purification, nucleic acid concentrations are measured by using a NanoDrop.",
    "Note: Use a DNA solution of known concentration and measure serial dilutions thereof to check for the accuracy of the NanoDrop.\nLibrary Construction by Polymerase Chain Reaction\nTiming: approx. 3 h for 96 samples\nDilute isolated DNA of each sample to a final concentration of 12 ng/μL in 20 μL water into a 96-well skirted plate.\nPrepare the Master Mix (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for the first (1st) PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_1.csv\nTransfer 27 μL of the prepared Master Mix (per well) and add 3 μL of the sample (per well) to a new 96-well skirted plate. The well plate with 30 μL sample per well is covered with a foil seal and is centrifuged for 30 s at low speed to collect the liquid at the bottom.\nPut the plate into the cycler (Biometra TAdvanced) and run the first (1st) PCR program for 15 cycles following the time and temperature settings shown in (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_2.csv\nPrepare the Master Mix (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) for the second (2nd) PCR including forward index primer. For each 96-well plate, 6 different forward primer and 16 different reverse primer are used. The reverse primer is not included in the Master Mix, they are divided in strips which are placed in the robot working area as well. For each of the six forward primer one separate Master Mix is to be prepared.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_3.csv\nAfter the first PCR the plate returns to the robot.\nMix 2 μL of the DNA from 1st PCR, 45.5 μL of the Master Mix (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]), and 2.5 μL of one reverse index primer. Primer are combined in order to insert a double index in each sample following the method introduced by Kozich et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]. It is possible to select from 38 forward and 60 reverse primer Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_4.csv",
    "The plate is covered again with a PCR foil seal and is centrifuges for 30 s as before.\nThe second PCR starts by putting the covered plate into the cycler (Biometra TAdvanced). Run the program for ten cycles following the time and temperature settings shown in (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_5.csv\nPause Point: After the second PCR, the plate can be stored at 4°C for 1 day.\nPool the final PCR products of both plates after the second PCR, which results in a total volume of 100 μL per sample.\nNote: Fifteen μL can be used for quality control issues (e.g., gel electrophoresis).\nLibrary Cleaning\nTiming: approx. 1 h 30 min for 96 samples\nPCR purification is performed with AGENCOURT AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) and again fully automatized using Beckman Coulter Biomek 4000 robot.\nPrior to the library cleaning\nRemove the AMPure XP beads from 4°C storage and let stand for at least 30 min to bring to 20°C–22°C.\nVortex the AMPure XP beads until they are well dispersed.\nAdd 1.8 μL AMPure XP beads per 1.0 μL PCR product. Using a P1000 multi-channel pipette, the robot gently pipettes the entire volume up and down 10-times to mix thoroughly.\nNote: For stool samples, the standard settings are 85 μL PCR product and 153 μL AMPure XP beads resulting in a total volume of 238 μL.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 5 min.\nPut the well plate in the magnetic rack and let stand at 20°C–22°C for 5 min or until the liquid becomes clear in appearance. The robot removes the all of the clear supernatant using a P1000 multi-channel pipette.\nThe fragment is bound to the beads and 200 μL freshly prepared 70% EtOH is added to each well using a P250 without barrier.",
    "Leave at 20°C–22°C for 30 s and discard the supernatant. Take extra care not to disturb the beads.\nSteps 31 and 32 are repeated once more, for a total of two 70% EtOH washes.\nLet the 96-well plate at 20°C–22°C for 4 - 5 min for drying, and then remove from the magnetic rack.\nRe-suspend the bead pellet in each well in 80 μL BE Elution (recommended volume of AMPure standard protocol). The robot gently pipettes the entire volume up and down 10-times to mix thoroughly using a P250 multi-channel pipette.\nCritical: The amount of added Elution Buffer depends on the DNA yield of the PCR product. Low amounts of PCR product, i.e., weak bands on the gel, should be re-suspend with amount at or below 20 μL BE Elution.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 20°C–22°C for 2 min.\nPlace the 96-well plate on the magnetic rack at 20°C–22°C for 2 min or until the liquid becomes clear in appearance. Seventy μL of the clear supernatant from each well are transferred to an XP plate. Eight μL are transferred to a second plate for DNA measurements by fluorimetry (Qubit measurement according to the manufacturer’s instructions).\nNote: If not enough volume is available, the total amount is transferred manually.\nSamples are diluted to a concentration of 2 nM and finally diluted to a concentration of 0.5 nM.\nFrom each sample of the 96-well plate, 5 μL are transferred to a low binding tube (pool of all samples of one plate).\nPause Point: After the library cleaning the plate can be stored at 4°C for 1 day.\nPrepare Samples for 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing\nCalculate molarity of each sample based on measured Qubit concentrations for a mean over four measurements: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/224-Si1.jpg\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_224_6.csv\nNote: For V3V4, the average library size is 572 bp.",
    "Following steps are necessary to denature the DNA and set to a concentration of 20 pM.\nCreate a fresh 0.2 nM NaOH solution and a 0.2 nM Tris HCl solution.\nAdd 40 μL of the 0.5 nM DNA pool and 40 μL of the 0.2 N NaOH solution to a 1.5-mL tube.\nVortex the sample and centrifuge for 1 min (280 × g). Leave it in a stand for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Add 40 μL of the 0.2 nM Tris HCl solution. Vortex the mixture and centrifuge for 1 min (280 × g).\nIncubate for 5 min at 95°C and for 5 min at 4°C.\nAdd 880 μL cooled HT1-Buffer to the denaturated DNA pool to generate a 20 pM library.\nDilute the DNA to get the final pM concentration of 10 pM final library concentration that was spiked-in using 20% (v/v) PhiX. PhiX DNA in a ready to sequence library (Illumina PhiX Control v3, FC-110-3001) is added in order to increase complexity for the first few bases sequenced. Otherwise, the sequencer miscalculates the amount of the dominating base and the sequencing fails.\nSix-hundred μL of the final pool is transferred to the Illumina MiSeq cartridge v3 with 600 cycles."
