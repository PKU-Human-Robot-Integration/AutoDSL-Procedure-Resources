    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPreparing the Cartridge\nTiming: 30 min\nThe cartridge is essential for partitioning of single cells. There are two key steps to preparing the cartridge before addition of cells: priming the cartridge and treating the surface. It is possible to run two cartridges in parallel using a single Rhapsody Express instrument.\nFrom the Rhapsody cDNA kit (Cat. No. 633773), thaw the following reagents at room temperature (15°C–25°C), then place on ice:\nNuclease-free water\nRT Buffer\nRT 0.1 M DTT\ndNTP\nRNase Inhibitor\nBead RT/PCR Enhancer\n10× Exonuclease I buffer\nBead resuspension buffer\nCritical: Only remove enzymes from −20°C when in use.\nPlace on ice:\nSample Buffer\n1 M DTT\nLysis Buffer\nCell Capture Beads\nBead Wash Buffer\nNote: Ensure that the Eppendorf SmartBlock Plate is installed on the thermomixer and is set to 21°C.\nSet a heatblock or additional thermomixer with the Eppendorf SmartBlock 1.5 mL to 80°C.\nCritical: All steps performed on the cartridge will only use electronic Gilson pipettes. Regular pipettes cannot be used for these steps, as the rate of flow into the cartridge is carefully set and controlled by the Gilson pipettes to maximize cell and bead retention during loading and wash steps.\nPriming the Rhapsody Cartridge\nPush the cartridge into the far end of the Express instrument tray to match the cartridge and tray notches. Lay the cartridge flat and release it. Ensure that the cartridge is flat in the tray and the barcode faces out.\nMove the left slider to the middle (0) position on the Express instrument. The Retrieval (top) magnet and Lysis (bottom) magnets are away from the cartridge tray.\nMove the front slider to OPEN",
    "Remove the cap of a waste collection container (PN 650000090) and insert both the container and a new 5 mL LoBind Tube (Eppendorf cat. no. 0030108310) for bead retrieval into the appropriate slots in the drawer. Secure the cap of the 5 mL LoBind Tube to the holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/168-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Setting Up the BD Rhapsody Express\nBD Rhapsody Express showing proper cartridge position with 5 mL LoBind Tube for collection of Cell Capture Beads and waste container installed. During the workflow, the slider needs to be moved either to “Waste” or to “Beads” as indicated in the protocol.\nMove the front slider to WASTE\nInsert the tip of the pipette perpendicular to the port, seal the pipette tip against the gasket, and then load the cartridge with 700 μL of 100% (absolute) ethyl alcohol using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/168-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Loading the Cartridge\nInsert the pipette perpendicular to the cartridge with enough pressure to properly seal the orange gasket with the pipette tip, then dispense the pipette contents. The pipette needs to be set to “Prime/Treat”.\nCritical: ethyl alcohol should be steadily flowing through the cartridge. If ethyl alcohol is not going into the cartridge, the amount of pressure on the gasket from the pipette needs to be modified to allow reagent flow.\nLoad the cartridge with 700 μL of air using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode.\nLoad the cartridge with 700 μL of Cartridge Wash Buffer 1 (PN 650000060) with the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nLeave the cartridge on the tray at 15°C–25°C for 1 min.\nTreating the surface of the cartridge\nLoad the cartridge with 700 μL of air using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode.",
    "Load the cartridge with 700 μL of Cartridge Wash Buffer 1(PN 650000060) using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nLeave the cartridge on the tray at 15°C–25°C for 10 min.\nNote: If using two cartridges with a single instrument for one experiment, start the priming/ treating of the second cartridge during this 10-min incubation and repeat the steps above to prepare the second cartridge.\nLoad the cartridge with 700 μL of air using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode.\nLoad the cartridge with 700 μL of Cartridge Wash Buffer 2 (PN 650000061) using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: The cartridge can be stored at 15°C–25°C for ≤4 h. You can leave the cartridge on the tray. The performance of the cartridge has not been validated at 15°C–25°C storage for >4 h.\nPerform Sample Multiplexing (Optional) and Ab-Oligo Staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis protocol describes use of antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotides (Ab-Oligo) for sample multiplexing and surface protein profiling. Each Ab-Oligo contains an antibody-specific barcode, a poly(A) tail for bead capture and additional sequences for PCR amplification and library generation. There are two different methods to utilize multiplexing and surface protein profiling: co-labeling or sequential labeling. Co-labeling will save time, however, sequential labeling is more economical and can additionally reduce batch effects resulting from inconsistent staining. The following steps describe sequential Ab-Oligo labeling of 20,000–1 million cells. Up to 100 antibodies can be pooled together per staining reaction. If no sample multiplexing is required, proceed directly to step 8 (Fc receptor blocking).\nUse the cell suspensions derived from different samples (or from sorted populations) from the “Defrosting cryopreserved Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)” section, and make sure that each sample is resuspended in 180 μL of Cell staining Buffer.",

No. 4890) on ice and be centrifuged in the Latch Rack with a plate adapter. Further, tubes can be uncapped and re-capped with an 8-Channel Screw Cap Tube Capper (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. No. 4105MAT) and aliquoted with a multi-channel pipette.\nIn pre-amplification workspace, pipette reagents into a new 1.5 mL LoBind Tube on ice (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]):\nMaster mix can be scaled based on number of samples.\nPipette-mix the 2× AbSeq labeling master mix, and place back on ice.\nNote: The final working concentrations for the Ab-Oligos are between 0.1 μg and 1 μg per stain depending on the antibody clone and have been optimized by the manufacturer. For an example of final working concentrations on a select set of Ab-Oligos, see Supplemental Table 4 in (Mair et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nLabeling samples with AbSeq Ab-oligos",

Ideally, if planning to load a full cartridge, the cell count should be >300,000 cells/mL with a viability >90%.\nCritical: Cells must be resuspended in Sample Buffer (and not Staining Buffer)\nNote: Sufficient post-labeling washes are important for reducing noise that comes from residual unbound antibodies being captured onto 3’ capture beads during single-cell capture. However, some cell loss occurs with each additional wash. Users can choose to perform more or fewer washes depending on the abundance of their sample. If the user has an excess of cells for the experiment, it is recommended that the stain and wash steps occur in a 5 mL polystyrene tube. This will allow an increase in wash volume to 3 mL instead of 1 mL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_168_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_168_2.csv\nLoading of Cells onto the Cartridge and Retrieval of Cell Capture Beads Containing mRNA and Feature Barcodes\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This protocol describes the steps to isolate and capture mRNA and feature barcodes from partitioned cells on the Rhapsody cartridge. Single-cell partitioning is achieved by loading cells at densities that are low enough to achieve a single cell per well distribution in the cartridge. Each cartridge contains >200,000 nanowells, thus the likelihood of having more than one cell in a single well depends on the cell density (see table below). There are different approaches to identify multiplets based on factors such as number of genes or unique molecular identifiers present compared to the rest of the sample, as well as computational approaches (Amezquita et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Identifying multiplets can be significantly improved if several samples are multiplexed prior to loading on the cartridge because any sample with two or more Sample Tags is easily identified as a multiplet (Stoeckius et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nRefer to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] to determine an acceptable multiplet rate for the number of captured cells on retrieved Cell Capture Beads:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_168_3.csv\nAn approximation of the percentage of multiplets that will occur within a cartridge based on the number of cells loaded. Because there are a fixed number of nanowells in a cartridge, the likelihood of multiplets increases with the number of loaded cells. As discussed in the main text, multiplets can only efficiently be removed when using sample multiplexing.\nAccording to the number of cells counted in step 11e, take the appropriate volume containing the targeted cell number + 30% (i.e., if planning to capture 20,000 cells per cartridge, take 26,000 cells. If planning to load two cartridges in parallel take 52,000 cells).",
    "Note: 30% is an approximate number that should allow a more accurate prediction of the number of cells collected after. This number takes into account cell loss from both washes and cartridge loading (only 575 μL of the 650 μL single-cell suspension will be loaded onto the Rhapsody Cartridge).\nAdd Sample Buffer to bring the volume of the cell suspension to 650 μL (or 1,300 μL if planning to load two cartridges in parallel)\nLoad the cells onto the cartridge.\nLoad the cartridge on the tray with 700 μL of air using the Gilson P1200M pipette in Prime/Treat mode.\nChange the mode of the Gilson P1200M pipette to Cell Load.\nWith a manual pipette, gently pipet the cell suspension up and down to mix.\nOn the Gilson P1200M, press the pipette button once to aspirate 40 μL of air, immerse the pipette tip in cell suspension, and then press the button again to aspirate 575 μL of cold cell suspension (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nInsert the tip of the pipette perpendicular to the port, seal the pipette tip against the gasket, and then press the button a third time to dispense 615 μL of air and cells.\nIncubate at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 15 min. During the 15-min incubation, prepare Cell Capture Beads.\nCritical: If planning to load two cartridges at the same time using only one Rhapsody Express instrument, load cartridge #2 at the 14-min mark of step 14f by repeating steps 14a–f. This is essential to ensure you have correct timing for subsequent steps.\nPreparing Cell Capture Beads\nNote: Keep the Cell Capture Beads on ice before use.

    "The expected size of the AbSeq final library is around 270bp.\nTo calculate the concentration in nM, use the following equation:\nC = X × 1×106 × (1/MW) × (1/S)\nWhere\nX = the concentration of the library calculated by Qubit in ng/μL\n1 × 106 is used to convert μL to L,\nMW = the molecular weight of dsDNA\nS = the average size of your library determined by the Tape Station or Bioanalyzer.\nFor example, if the Qubit reading for an mRNA library is 45 ng/μL with an average library size of 585 bp, the equation would be:\nC = 45 ng/μL × 1×106 μL/L × (1/660 mol/g) × (1/585 bp)\nC = 116.6 nM\nCombining libraries for sequencing (Multiplexing)\nTo determine how much of each sample to pool for sequencing, first dilute each sample to the recommended concentration for library pooling according to the Illumina guide (usually 1–4 nM, Table 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl15]).\nSuggested flowcell loading concentrations for libraries and PhiX for different Illumina systems.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_168_15.csv\nNext determine how many reads each sample requires. To do this, multiply the target cell number by the desired number of reads per cell. For example, if you wanted to sequence sample one mRNA library at 5,000 reads per cell, and had a target number of 10,000 cells, the number of reads for the sample would be 5,000 × 10,000 = 5,000,000 reads.",
    "Determine the fraction of the reads will go toward each sample. This can be done by dividing by each sample by the total reads needed across all samples. If you wanted to multiplex the Sample Tag, mRNA, and AbSeq libraries from a sample and each has 5,000,000 reads, 50,000,000 reads, and 150,000,000 reads respectively, the total reads is 205,000,000. The fraction of reads that will go to the Sample Tag is 0.02.\nTo determine the volume (μL) of each sample diluted to the flowcell loading concentration needed to pool for the final multiplexed library, multiply the fraction of reads by the total volume of the library needed. For example, to calculate the volume of Sample Tag (from step 35c) you need in your final library of 150 μL, multiply 0.02 by 150 to determine you will need 3.66 μL.\nNote: If the volume of library requires is prohibitively small a higher volume can be used for the pooling. For example, if only 5 μL is needed, a 100 μL pool can be made, and 5 μL of that pool can be taken into sequencing.\nPipette each required amount of sample into a LoBind 1.5 mL tube.\nSequence the libraries\nRecommended sequencing depths are as follows:\nmRNA: 5,000–10,000 reads per cell\nSample Tag: 600–1,000 reads per cell\nAbSeq: 400–1,000 reads per cell per antibody",
    "Note: The recommended sequencing depths are provided as a starting point, since the number of reads that should be targeted is not a fixed value, but rather depends on several factors. First, the number of reads needed per cell for each mRNA library will depend on how many primers are included in your panel and the abundance of the transcripts of interest. If the goal is to capture rare transcripts as much as possible, a higher read per cell sequencing target may be beneficial. Similarly, the targeted reads per cell for each AbSeq library will depend on the makeup of the antibody panel. Proteins that are expressed at high levels will use proportionally more reads, which can leave other antibodies in the panel poorly resolved, particularly if they target proteins that are expressed at low levels.\nPrimary Analysis Pipeline\nTiming: 1 h to upload data; run time varies\nDownload fastq files from BaseSpace from the “File” menu using the BaseSpace Sequence Hub Downloader or obtain Fastq files from your sequencing core.\nCreate Seven Bridges login by going to http://www.sevenbridges.com/bdgenomics/[href=http://www.sevenbridges.com/bdgenomics/]\nCreate a new Project in Seven Bridges by clicking on the “Projects” tab and selecting “Create a project”.\nUpload the fastq files using the Seven Bridges Uploader by clicking “Upload Files” and selecting the appropriate Fastq files (R1 and R2 are required.)\nNote: the uploader can be downloaded from the “Data Tools” section of the tab “Data”.\nIn the “Files” tab of the project, add the fasta reference files for the mRNA and AbSeq panels to the project\nGenerate AbSeq reference file by going to http://abseq-ref-gen.genomics.bd.com/[href=http://abseq-ref-gen.genomics.bd.com/] and selecting the antibodies that were used in your experiment.
