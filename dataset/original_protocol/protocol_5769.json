    "Probe designDNA oligo probes are designed by selecting an 18-30 nucleotide region in the target mRNA using four criteria.The choice of probe length should be determined by the RNA-DNA melting temperature of the sequence, which can be done by using the calculator provided on the Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (IDT) website.The probe should have minimal secondary structure.The target sequence should have minimal secondary structure. The secondary structure can be calculated for the RNA by using the Mfold website (Zuker, 2003). A proper choice has the 5’ end of the probe binding inside a loop rather than a stem in the secondary structure of the mRNA.The probe should be checked for homology with other sequences in the genome using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (Johnson et al., 2008).Choice of fluorophore is dictated by the illumination scheme. Best results were obtained using Cy3 and Cy5 dyes labeled internally (available through IDT). Other labeling schemes such as end labeling work adequately, but are less photostable. In budding yeast, cellular auto-fluorescence is high in the same region of the emission spectrum as dyes excited by 470 nm or 488 nm light (Atto-488 and Alexa 488) and these dyes are not recommended.When labeled internally the fluorophore should be positioned 2 nt away from either end.Microscope designOur microscope is a custom-built microscope configured in highly inclined illumination geometry (HILO). For single fluorophores, epi-fluorescence will not generate an adequate signal, Figure 1. It is necessary to have a variable angle geometry on the illumination (most TIR/HILO microscopes have this.) This can be achieved by using a fiber coupled laser or coupling a free space laser to a fiber using a fiberport and a fiber optic cable and moving the fiber output with an x-y translation mount (see Figure 2).",
    "Using the x-y translation, the beam can be adjusted away from the center of the back focal plane of the objective. Once this beam is displaced to the critical angle, total internal reflection geometry is achieved. The angle for inclined illumination is less than the critical angle and should be selected for optimum z-sectioning and intensity in the volume of interest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531005615_3196.jpgFigure 1. Comparing Epi and HILO illumination. A. An epi-fluorescence microscope has the illumination incident (red line) on the sample through the objective and the entire volume of the sample is illuminated. This leads to poor signal to noise for single fluorophores since the widefield microscope collects out of focus light. B. An inclined illumination geometry has the illumination (red line) displaced radially in the back focal plane of the objective so that the light becomes a thin laminated sheet in the sample volume (Tokunaga et al., 2008). This enables z-sectioning and increases signal to noise significantly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531005712_2990.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of the illumination path. One or more lasers are coupled into a fiber optic cable using a fiberport. This fiber is fitted onto an X-Y translation mount and collimated by a short lens (focal length chosen by the field of view). The tube lens focuses the illumination on the back focal plane. When the X-Y position is adjusted away from the center of the back focal plane the beam becomes inclined through the sample volume.Sample preparationDay 1At the end of the day, inoculate yeast cells into 50 ml of liquid media in a culture flask from cells actively growing on a plate.Day 2–Cell fixation and permeabilizationMeasure Cell OD using a spectrophotometer at OD600 by placing 1 ml of cell culture in a cuvet.Once cell OD600 has reached 0.",
    "6, decant cells into a 50 ml Falcon tube and pelleted by centrifuging at 671 x g for 5 min and aspirated.Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of ice cold (4 °C) methanol for 10 min for fixation.Cells are pelleted and resuspended in ice cold Buffer B twice and aspirated.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of Spheroplasting buffer and transfer to a 1.75 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 2 µl of 5 units/µl of zymolyase and gently pipette to mix.Incubate the cells for 30 min or until the OD600 of 100 µl of cells added to 900 µl of deionized water shows a reduction of 30% from the initial OD after 1 min, which demonstrates cell lysis.Pellet the cells and aspirate. Centrifuge at no more than 268 x g since they are fragile once they are spheroplasts.Wash the cells two more times in ice cold Buffer B and aspirate (wash means spin down to a pellet, aspirate liquid and resuspend.)Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 70% ethanol and keep at 4 °C for a minimum of 1 h to overnight.Day 2 cont./Day 3–hybridizationPellet cells at 268 x g and wash twice each with 1 ml Wash Buffer and aspirate. Note: Wash buffer should be prepared fresh and formamide should be warmed to room temperature before opening.Dilute the probes to 1 µM in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.Prepare a mixture of hybridization buffer and probes based on the working concentration determined by titration (see Notes).Resuspend cells to a final volume of 100 µl in the probe-hybridization buffer mixture by gentle pipetting.Then wrap samples with aluminum foil and place in the incubator at 30 °C overnight.Day 3/Day4–Slide Preparation Prepare Imaging Buffer immediately before use.",
    "Wipe the slides with ethanol; or (optional) clean slides and coverslips in a plasma cleaner for 10 min.Note: The slide should be clean of dust and other particles by wiping with ethanol. Any air bubbles will severely impact the performance of the Imaging Buffer. Mix 2.5 µl of Imaging Buffer with 2.5 µl of cells and place on the coverslip.Place the coverslip on a slide and seal with epoxy along the edges. Note: Slides should be kept in a dark place while not on the microscope. Several slides can be prepared simultaneously. Once sealed, the performance of the imaging buffer will not degrade for several hours.Data acquisitionUsing a microscope as described above, hardware control and the acquisition parameters can be set in the Micromanager software (Edelstein et al., 2014). Z-stack images can be acquired using the multi-dimensional tool in Micromanager for each channel of interest (e.g., DIC, Cy5, etc.).Acquire images at full region of interest (512 x 512) on an EMCCD (iXonEM +, Andor) at 100 msec exposure times. The pixel size and z-step are chosen to be less than or equal to the Nyquist sampling limit for the shortest wavelength (see Introduction to Fourier Optics 3rd edition, Goodman.). The Nyquist limit for a widefield microscope is shown by the following equations where the wavelength λemission used is the peak emission of the fluorophore chosen, the angle θ is the half-aperture angle, and n is the index of refraction of the immersion oil.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531010840_8971.jpg These values allow the maximum amount of spatial information to be recorded. Sampling above this limit is acceptable although the resolution between two objects will not be improved. Undersampling will lead to the inability to distinguish between two close fluorophores because the information in one pixel is not coupled to the information in its neighboring pixels.",
    "Set the laser to output 25 mW at the sample plane. For each chamber, the thickness is approximately 2 µm and an appropriate number of z-slices are acquired. An example of the contrast between a negative control and a low copy number strain is shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531010956_9751.jpgFigure 3. Contrast between strains. A. One z-slice of a negative control for yEvenus mRNA (e.g., wildtype) is shown. All intensity is due to auto-fluorescence. The yEvenus probes are 26nt in length and labeled internally (sequence in Wadsworth, et al., 2017). B. One z-slice of a strain expressing a low copy number (< 20) of yEvenus mRNA transcripts per cell is shown. mRNA transcripts are targeted with a single Cy5 labeled DNA oligo probe."
