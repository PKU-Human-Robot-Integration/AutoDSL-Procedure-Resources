    "All animal experiments were performed following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC), Spain, in accordance with the European Union Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/UE) and with the Spanish Royal Decree of 1 February 2013 (53/2013). All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\nNOTE: This comparative assay to study the segmentation of mitochondrial CoQ pools is described as follows:\n1. Protein quantification\nFreeze and thaw the isolated mitochondria26 from a wild-type mouse liver three times (i.e., mitochondrial membranes) before experimentation to make the organelles permeable to the reaction substrates.\nQuantify the protein amount of the isolated mitochondria sample by Bradford or Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) methods. In the case of Bradford, add 2 µL of sample into 1 mL of 1x Bradford reagent.\nSplit the sample into four subsamples of 20 µg each (namely: A, B, C, D; Figure 2A).\n2. Measuring CI+CIII activity\nNOTE: This part of the protocol uses samples A and B to measure CI+CIII activity (Figure 2B).\nSplit samples A and B into two subsamples of 10 µg each (namely A1, A2, B1, and B2). Mix each of the subsamples in a 1 mL cuvette with 30 µL of cyt c (10 mg/mL), 10 µL of 100 mM malonate, and add preheated C1/C2 buffer (Table 1) at 37 °C up to 980 µL (979 µL for cuvettes A2 and B2).\n\tCAUTION: This step involves the use of the toxic reagents malonate and potassium cyanide.",
    "NOTE: cyt c (10 mg/mL) must be prepared fresh by mixing 10 mg of cyt c in 1 mL of 10 mM K2HPO4 solution, pH adjusted to 7.2, and it must be maintained in ice throughout the experiment.\nAdd 10 µL of 1 M KCl in cuvettes A1 and A2, and add 10 µL of 1 M NaCl in cuvettes B1 and B2.\nAdd 1 µL of 1 mM rotenone into the cuvette containing subsamples A2 and B2.\n\tCAUTION: This step involves the use of the toxic reagent rotenone.\nRight before the measurement, add 10 µL of NADH (10 mM) into all cuvettes.\n\tNOTE: The 10 µL is preferably added on the step of the cuvette, so the reaction starts upon mixing.\nMix the cuvette by carefully flipping it three times. Place it in the absorbance cuvette reader (UV/VISJASCO spectrophotometer).\nClick on Measure > Parameters > General and set the measurement parameters at Wavelength: 550 nm, and Time: 4 min of reading; press Accept and Start buttons to begin the experiment.\nAt the end of the measurement, save the slope comprising the linear increase of absorbance by clicking on File and Save As. The slope can also be collected manually.\n3. Measuring CII+CIII activity\nNOTE: This part of the protocol uses samples C and D to measure CII+CIII activity (Figure 2C).\nSplit samples C and D into two subsamples of 10 µg each (namely C1, C2, D1, and D2). Mix each of the subsamples in a 1 mL cuvette with 30 µL of cyt c (10 mg/mL), 1 µL of 1 mM rotenone, and add preheated C1/C2 buffer at 37 °C up to 980 µL (970 µL for cuvettes C2 and D2).\n\tCAUTION: This step involves the use of the toxic reagents potassium cyanide and rotenone.",
    "NOTE: cyt c (10 mg/mL) must be prepared fresh by mixing 10 mg of cyt c in 1 mL of 10 mM K2HPO4 solution, pH adjusted to 7.2, and it must be maintained in ice throughout the experiment.\nAdd 10 µL of 1 M KCl in cuvettes C1 and C2, and add 10 µL of 1 M NaCl in cuvettes D1 and D2.\nAdd 1 µL of 1 mM antimycin A into the cuvette containing subsamples C2 and D2.\n\tCAUTION: This step involves the use of the toxic reagent antimycin A.\nRight before the measurement, add 10 µL of succinate (1 M) into all cuvettes.\n\tNOTE: The 10 µL is preferably added on the step of the cuvette, so the reaction starts upon mixing.\nMix the cuvette carefully, flipping it three times. Place it in the absorbance cuvette reader (UV/VIS spectrophotometer).\nClick on Measure > Parameters > General and set the measurement parameters at Wavelength: 550 nm, and Time: 4 min of reading; press Accept and Start buttons to begin the experiment.\nAt the end of the measurement, save the slope comprising the linear increase of absorbance by clicking on File and Save As. The slope can also be collected manually.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
