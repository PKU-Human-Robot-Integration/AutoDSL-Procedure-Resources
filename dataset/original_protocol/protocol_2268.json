This section describes how to prepare the cell lysates that will be used for RISC assembly assay.\nPreparation of Drosophila S2 cells.\nCulture Drosophila S2 cells in insect cell culture medium (Gibco) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% FBS at 27°C.\nNote: To keep a healthy S2 cell culture going, the passage numbers of S2 cell is limited in 10–15.\nDilute confluent cells (∼1 × 107 cells/mL) and seed at a density of 5 × 105 cells/mL.\ndsRNA treatment.\nSeed S2 cells into a 10 cm dish with volumes of 10 mL at a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL and prepare for RNAi.\nThaw the frozen dsRNA reagents and place them on ice.\nAdd 8 μg dsRNA for targetting each gene(dcr-2, r2d2, ago2, or ago1 (3′-UTR)) to the cell culture medium and shake gently.\nTransfer 1 mL of cells from the 10 cm dish to a 12-well plate to detect the efficiency of RNAi knockdown. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlasmid transfection.\nAfter 24 h of dsRNA treatment, prepare for plasmid transfection.\nPreheat the Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM at room temperature (22°C–28°C).\nAdd 8 μg pAc5.1-Flag-AGO1 and 5 μg of pAc5.1-miR-9b plasmids to 500 μL Opti-MEM, and vortex the mixture.\nNote: The transfection of the miRNA is not essential. It depends on the expression levels of miRNA in the cell line.\nAdd 20 μL Lipofectamine 2000 to 500 μL Opti-MEM, and vortex the mixture.\nAdd diluted plasmids to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 mixture.\nVortex the mixture, and incubate at room temperature (22°C–28°C) for 15 min.",
    "Add the plasmid-lipid complex dropwise to the cell medium of the 10 cm dish and shake gently to mix.\nqRT-PCR to confirm the efficiency of RNAi knockdown.\nDesign primers to perform the qPCR. Primers used for qPCR are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nAfter 72 h of dsRNA treatment, collect cells for subsequent real-time PCR.\nExtract total RNA from the S2 cells treated with dsRNAs by the Trizol method.\nPrepare cDNA with the HiScript III Reverse Kit (Vazyme) according to the instructions and dilute to a volume of 100 μL.\nSet up the qRT-PCR reaction system.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1875_13.csv\nRun the real-time PCR instrument.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1875_14.csv\nCalculate the efficiency of RNAi knockdown. The relative mRNA expression is determined using the formula: 2-  Δ Δ  Ct method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1875-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Relative expression levels of indicated genes in S2 cells treated with dsRNA measured by qRT-PCR\n(A–D) S2 cells were treated with dsRNAs against dcr-2 (A), r2d2 (B), ago1 (C) or ago2 (D). Three days post dsRNA treatment, expressions of indicated genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. The two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze statistical variance. Error bars indicate mean ± s.d (n=3). ∗∗∗, p<0.001, ∗∗∗∗, p<0.0001.\nAlternatives: The TaqMan probes can be used instead of SYBR Green mixture and oligonucleotides.\nPreparation of cell lysates.\nAfter 48 h of transfection, collect the transfected S2 cells by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, and then wash cells with cold PBS twice.\nNote: The waste of cell culture medium and the PBS needs to be collected and thoroughly mixed with an appropriate amount of 84 disinfectants, then disposed of according to institute regulations.",
    "Resuspend cells in 1 mL lysis buffer (freshly supplemented with 2 mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail) and transfer to a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer.\nNote: Dissolve one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet in 500 μL lysis buffer as 100× stock solutions. Prepare freshly before use.\nPrepare homogenates by performing 50 strokes using the tight pestle.\nCritical: This step should be performed on ice.\nCritical: Between samples, clean the Douncer and pestle with lysis buffer 3 times to avoid cross-contamination between different samples.\nClear the lysates by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant and aliquot 50 μL/tube.\nFreeze the lysates using liquid nitrogen and store them at −80°C.\nNote: We recommend immediately starting the AGO-RISC assembly reaction using fresh lysates.\nAlternatives: Instead of the lysates prepared from S2 cells overexpressing AGO1, and in which dcr-2, r2d2, ago2, and ago1 are knocked down, the lysates prepared from the embryo of dcr-2 mutant flies can be used (Lee et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: Avoid multiple freezes and thaw cycles.\nPause point: The lysates can be stored at −80°C for up to one month.\nNative gel analysis of AGO1-RISC assembly\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes how to perform the in vitro RISC assembly.\nBefore beginning the in vitro RISC assembly, set up the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank and fill it with pre-chilled 0.5 × TBE buffer.\nNote: Cooling the electrophoresis buffer is critical to detect complexes in the AGO1-RISC assembly. It is optimal to perform the electrophoresis at 4°C.\nPrepare the in vitro RISC assembly as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1875_15.csv\nIncubate the mixture at 27°C for 40 min. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nLoad 3 μL of the assembly products into the 1.5% agarose native gel. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Critical: Washing the gel and the gel wells with 0.5 × TBE buffer before running is essential for a good resolution.\nLoad 3 μL of 2 × RNA loading dye and perform electrophoresis at 300 V in cold 0.5 × TBE buffer for 20 min.\nCritical: We have noticed that the RISC assembly sample will not rapidly load to the bottom of the wells, likely due to the RISC assembly mixture not containing glycerol. We load the sample using long pipet pips to sink the sample to the bottom of the wells.\nEnd the electrophoresis, and keep the gel attached to the glass plate.\nPerform phosphor imaging to detect the mature AGO1-RISC.\nImmunoprecipitation of AGO1 complexes for cleavage assay\nTiming: 8–12 h\nThis section details the associated procedures of immunoprecipitation of AGO1 complexes. This part of the protocol is critical since the immunoprecipitation of AGO1 complexes will be used for the RISC cleavage assay.\nPerform the cell culture as described under production of S2 lysates for RISC assembly[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1].\nPreparation of the cell lysates.\nHarvest S2 cells by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min.\nWash cells two times with cold PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of lysis buffer per 10 cm dish, resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting to ensure cells are fully lysed, and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to new tubes and aliquot a 30 μL sample as the input fraction for western blot analysis.\nNote: When we transfer supernatant, do not disturb the pellets.\nCritical: Buffers should be pre-chilled on ice, and the centrifuge should be pre-cooled to 4°C.\nImmunoprecipitation.",
    "For immunoprecipitation of endogenous AGO1, incubate the supernatants with anti-AGO1 antibody or control IgG by rotation at 4°C for 5 h or overnight (6–12 h).\nUse 20 μL of protein A/G agarose beads per sample.\nWash the beads once with 1 mL lysis buffer.\nAdd the washed beads to the lysates and incubate at 4°C for 3 h on a rotator.\nWash the samples three times with washing buffer.\nTransfer the beads to a fresh tube and take an aliquot of 5 μL beads as the immunoprecipitation fraction for western blot analysis.\nCritical: All steps should be performed on ice or at 4°C.\nRISC cleavage assay\nTiming: 5 h\nThe section of this protocol is modified from a previous publication (Miyoshi et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), and this section describes how to perform the RISC cleavage assay in vitro.\nRemove the supernatant.\nPrepare the in vitro RISC cleavage reaction mixture as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1875_16.csv\nIncubate at 27°C for 2 h.\nAdd 1 mL of Trizol reagent to the cleavage RNA sample and pipet the sample up and down several times to homogenize.\nIncubate for 10 min to allow complete dissociation of the AGO1-RNA complex.\nAdd 0.2 mL of chloroform to 1 mL of Trizol, cap the tube and mix thoroughly by shaking.\nIncubate at room temperature (22°C–28°C) for 5 min.\nCritical: Trizol reagent and chloroform are hazardous solutions. Carefully work under a fume hood, must wear gloves and a lab coat. Trizol and chloroform waste must be collected and disposed of according to institute regulations.\nCentrifuge the sample for 15 min at 13,000 g at 4°C.\nTransfer 0.5 mL of the aqueous phase to a new tube.",
    "Note: After centrifugation, three phases will be obtained. An upper aqueous phase contains RNA, interphase contains DNA, and a lower phase contains proteins. Carefully pipet the aqueous phase and avoid transferring the interphase into the pipette.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 100% ethanol to the aqueous phase and mix well.\nProceed with the RNA Clean-up protocol of the ZYMO-Spin column.\nSubject the cleaved fragment of substrate 1 to the Qsep1 for size distribution analysis, and the cleaved fragment of substrate 2 to gel electrophoresis analysis.\nAlternatives: Agilent bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer) with the Agilent RNA Pico Kit (Cat # 5067-1513RUO) can be used instead of Qsep1."
