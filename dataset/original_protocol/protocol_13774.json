    "All animal experiments were performed in compliance with NIH's Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and guidelines from the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol no. 01840).\n1. Orthodontic Tooth Movement\nTo generate a mouse bed, use a flat plastic platform with a wedge shaped, 45° angled headrest. The headrest can be generated by cutting a plastic box.\n\t\nElevate the head end of the platform to generate an approximately 30° angle between the headrest and the table plane. Attach a bent thick paper clip (0.036\" in diameter) to the head side end to hold the upper incisors.\nOn the tail end, generate an elevated surface to which an orthodontic power chain can be attached to hold the lower incisors. See Figure 1 for an example platform.\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine at 10 mg/kg and ketamine 100mg/kg using 1 mL syringe and a 27 Gauge needle.\nPlace anesthetized mouse on custom-made platform and immobilize upper jaw by hooking the upper incisors on the paperclip loop. Open the mouse lower jaw with the orthodontic power chain hooked on the lower incisors. Keep the cheeks retracted with the mini-colibri mouth retractor.\nPlace the platform under a surgical microscope or any other stereoscope that can reach to 5-6x magnification.\nApply 50 µL of saline (roughly 1 drop) on the mouse eyes to prevent corneal dehydration. Replenish saline every 20 min.\nCut a piece of an aluminum wire (0.08 mm diameter) 1 cm in length. Slide the wire from the buccal side lingually in the interproximal area bellow the contact point between first and second molars using a microsurgical needle holder. Leave 2 mm free edge in front of the first molar in order to be threaded into the spring end.",
    "Cut a piece of nickel titanium (NiTi) coil, around 7 to 9 threads in length.\n\tNOTE: The elastic properties of the coil will provide constant force for orthodontic movement. The total unstrained length of the coil should be shorter than the gap between the incisor and the molar. Keep in mind that an extra 2 threads are needed on each end to anchor coil to the tooth. Aluminum wire is selected in order to reduce scanning artefacts such as beam hardening during the micro-CT scan.\nInsert NiTi coil spring (0.15 mm wire diameter, 0.9 mm inner coil diameter; delivers a force of 10 g) between lower first molar and lower incisor. Use the wire ligature inserted around the first molar in step 1.6, twist the wire tightly around 2 threads of the coil spring to fix the coil on the molar side.\nTo ensure uniform force level, use exactly 3 active threads between the first molar and the incisor. Temporarily remove the power chain from the incisor and loop 2 to 3 unstrained threads over the incisor to anchor the coil. Slide the threads down to the incisor free gingival margin.\nPlace a layer of flowable composite resin on the incisal border of the coil and cure it with dental curing light. Replace the power chain after curing the resin.\nUsing the same curing light, heat up the NiTi coil for 20 s. This will tighten the NiTi coil. The finished placement is shown Figure 1C.\nEither leave the contralateral side intact or insert a sham such as the wire between the first and second molars.\nPlace the anaesthetized mouse under a heated light to keep the mouse warm until recovery.\nPlace the mouse back into an individual cage and monitor daily. No diet change is necessary during orthodontic movement.",
    "NOTE: OTM device on one side causes some discomfort but does not impair feeding. However, inserting devices on both sides are not advised due to the added amount of discomfort. Pain medication is not necessary unless outward signs of pain are seen.\n2. Micro-CT scan of PDL fibers in fresh hemi-mandibles\nMounting the hemi-mandible (Figure 2)\n\t\nAfter the desired duration of orthodontic movement, sacrifice the mouse via cervical dislocation. Remove the mandible and separate into hemi-mandibles.\n\t\t​NOTE: Since the sample will not be fixed, it is critical to perform the dissection of the jaw and mounting as soon as possible, ideally within 30 min.\nRemove the surrounding soft tissue gently with a clean lint-free wipe.\nRemove the orthodontic device using microsurgical scissors and tweezers under a stereo microscope with at least 4x magnification.\nKeep sample moist in a 1.5 mL volume, micro-centrifuge tube along with a piece of lint-free wipe moistened with water.\nPlace packable dental composite resin into the sample slot on the stage, then place the fresh hemi-mandible into the composite. Before mounting make sure that the bone surface in contact with the dental composite is free from any soft tissues and dry, otherwise dental composite will not cure properly.\nAdjust the position of the hemi-mandible until the first molar is centered at the midline groove of the stage. Make sure the occlusal surface is horizontal. Cure the composite when satisfied with the positioning.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional small amounts of dental composites can be placed on the sides of the hemi-mandible and/or across the incisor to aid in stabilizing the sample.\nPlace dampened lint-free wipe inside the humidity pools in the sample stage. Place dental composite on the occlusal surface of the first molar. Before closing the chamber, make sure nothing blocks the x-ray path at the specimen level.",
    "Affix the chamber in the micro-CT. Screw the chamber into the micro-CT sample stage so that movement during imaging is minimized.\nTurn on the x-rays and take 2D images while lowering the anvil vertically, until the tip of the anvil is surrounded by the composite but no increase in the force is detected.\nOnce anvil is embedded in the composite, close the x-ray source. Then, open the micro-CT chamber and cure the composite through the clear Plexiglass window.\nMicro-CT settings\n\t\nSet the source voltage to 40 kV and current to 200 µA. Using a 10x magnification detector, position the sample within the frame of view. Use binning of 2 for the captured images.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the PDL is significantly less dense than the bone and tooth, visualizing the PDL requires higher power and exposure time. This protocol will provide settings for visualizing the PDL.\nSet single image exposure time to 25 s. Set rotation of the sample stage to a range of 183 degrees or more. Set the scan for 2500 projections. Do not use any x-ray source filter, the resulting scans have a voxel size of 0.76 µm on each side.\nCollect a reference scan for proper reconstruction according to the micro-CT guidelines. Use 1/3 number of reference images as the total projections. Reconstruct the volume without additional binning, using a back projection filtered algorithm.\n3. Clearing method (Figure 3)\nPrepare five 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes.\nPrepare 1.4 mL of the following solutions in 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes: 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 50% ethanol (EtOH) in deionized (DI) water, 70% EtOH in DI water, and two tubes of 100% EtOH.",
    "NOTE: PFA is used for fixation of the sample. ECi clearing will also work on unfixed samples. To clear unfixed samples, simply skip the PFA step.\nPlace dissected hemi-mandible in 4% PFA. Cover with aluminum foil and place on the rocker on gentle setting at room temperature for 6 h.\nMove the hemi-mandible to 50% EtOH. Place it on the rocker covered from light for 16 h.\nMove the hemi-mandible to 70% EtOH. Place it on the rocker covered from light for 16 h.\nMove the hemi-mandible to 100% EtOH. Place it on the rocker covered from light for 16 h.\nRepeat 3.6. in the second 100% EtOH tube.\nPrepare 5 mL of ECi in a glass or polypropylene tube.\n\tNOTE: ECi dissolves polystyrene, but not polypropylene. Also, if not using a tissue with fluorescent proteins the sample can be exposed to light during the clearing procedure.\nMove the hemi-mandible to ECi tube. Cover the tube with aluminum foil and place on the rocker on gentle setting for a minimum of 12 h.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Dehydrated sample can be stored in ECi at room temperature. The freezing or melting point of ECi is 6.5 to 8.0 °C. Do not store at 4 °C.\nThe hemi-mandible is ready for imaging with fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: During imaging, the sample must be immersed in the ECi to remain optically transparent.\nSubscription Required.
