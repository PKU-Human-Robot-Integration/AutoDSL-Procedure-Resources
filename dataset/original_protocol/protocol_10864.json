    "1.\tTissue Harvest and Preparation\nAortic valves should be collected from adult pigs weighing no more than 120 lbs immediately after death.\nWash the valves twice with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and transport to the laboratory on ice.\nAll subsequent steps should be performed under sterile conditions.\nEnsure that leaflets do not show any sign of degeneration, tearing or calcification. Remove leaflets from the aortic root by cutting 1/3 of the distance from the annulus.\nPlace leaflets in individual wells of a six well plate and incubate overnight with 3ml Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 1% anti-biotic/anti-mycotic solution and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAs an alternative, isolated cells can be seeded into six-well culture plates and used in the pressure device. Isolation of valve endothelial cells and interstitial cells can be performed as previously described13, 14.\n2.\tPressure Studies\nA custom-made pressure system has been designed to study the mechanobiological effects of cyclic pressure on aortic valve tissue15.\nLog on to the computer and open the labVIEW program (Figure 1).\nCalibration:\nPrior to experimentation, the system should be properly calibrated.\nConnect the power supply to the circuit board. This provides power to the solenoid valves that control the flow of air into and out of the chamber.\nMake sure the compressed air is connected to the system and open the air supply to full velocity.\nTurn on the signal amplifier. Make sure the voltage reading is 0.00. Adjust as necessary\nThe labVIEW interface has a switch marked \"TEST/RECORD\". Make sure the switch is set to \"TEST\". Click the button marked \"Air Supply\" to open the inlet solenoid valve.",
    "Using the gas pressure regulator, pressurize the chamber with compressed air at 1 PSI. The pressure in the chamber can be read using the digital pressure gauge located on the rear end-plate of the chamber. Once the pressure has equilibrated, record the voltage reading from the signal amplifier. Repeat for 2, 3, 4 and 5 PSI.\nConstruct a calibration curve of pressure vs. voltage. Pressure should be converted from PSI to mmHg. The equation from the graph can be placed into the code of the labVIEW program\nRemove the aluminum front plate from the pressure chamber and spray the chamber with 70% ethanol. Leave for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow residual ethanol fumes to dissipate.\nPlace the six-well plate containing the leaflet samples into the chamber and replace the front end plate. Ensure the seal is airtight by tightening the nuts located on the four threaded rods (located at each corner of the end plate) by hand. Place the pressure chamber in the 37°C incubator. A schematic diagram of the pressure chamber is shown in figure 2.\nThe interface will prompt the user to provide the amount of time the system cycles between compressed air input and output. These should be set to 0.6s and 0.4s to mimic diastolic and systolic conditions, respectively, at a frequency of 1Hz. The user should also enter a data file path.\nIn labVIEW, click run and switch the \"TEST/RECORD\" toggle to \"RECORD\".\nMake sure the pressure is at the desired level using the graph on the labVIEW interface. Pressure can be adjusted using the gas pressure regulator.\nRun program for desired length of time.\nOnce the experiment is complete, click the stop button on labVIEW, turn off air supply and open the exhaust valve on the pressure chamber.",
    "Remove the front end plate from the chamber and retrieve six-well plate containing samples. Samples can now be analyzed for gene expression, protein expression, histology, mechanical properties etc.\n3.\tRepresentative Results: \nThe pressure system is capable of simulating the maximum transvalvular pressures observed under normotensive, stage I and stage II hypertensive conditions. However, the pressure was not able to mimic the systolic pressure gradient, which is essentially zero in vivo. Frequency is maintained at 1Hz, with an air inlet time of 0.6s and an exhaust time of 0.4s. Representative pressure waveforms of normal and elevated pressure conditions obtained from the system can be seen in figure 3. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3316/3316fig1.jpgFigure 1: Screen shot of the LabVIEW interface.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3316/3316fig2.jpgFigure 2: Schematic drawing of the pressure chamber A.
