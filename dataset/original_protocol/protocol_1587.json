    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDesigning the experiment\nTiming: Day 1, 0.5 h\nBefore plating the cells the experiment needs to be designed using the Seahorse Wave Desktop Software.\nStart the Seahorse Agilent Wave Desktop Software\nThe software can be downloaded from https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop].\nInstall the software and run the application.\nDesign the experiment and define groups.\nOpen the “blank” file under the templates section.\nDefine the conditions of the experiment in the “definitions” section. Start with defining the injection strategies, pretreatments, assay media, and cell type.\nInjection strategies might be neglected if only basal (no injection) extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) or basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) are of interest. Depending on the experimental setups, injection strategies might be added.\nDefine pretreatments, which will additionally comprise the treatment with DMSO as control and Gramicidin (dissolved in DMSO) as the actual experimental condition. Further pretreatments might be added, if necessary.\nDefine the assay media used, which will comprise SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium. Further assay media might be added, if necessary. Cell treatment with the pore forming peptide gramicidin allows to adjust the intracellular K+ concentration ([K+]) to the [K+] present in the extracellular space/ medium, i.e., 0 mM K+ (SM-0K+) and 140.0 mM K+ (SM-140K+).\nDefine the cell type used in the experiments, for example, HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13.\nDefine your treatments or manipulations in the “groups” section. Definitions need to be precise and consistent.\nIn the beginning, only a “background” group will be defined, which can neither be altered nor removed, as it is indispensable.",
    "For each condition (12 in this case, comprising HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13, each treated with SM-0K+ DMSO, SM-0K+ GRAM, SM-140K+ DMSO, and SM-140K+ GRAM, respectively) add a new group and choose the respective injection strategy, pretreatments, assay media, and cell type. Accurately defining the groups will lead to sorted results after the assay is finished and the results have been exported. The names of the groups can be changed by a right-click on the group header. The “Generate Groups” function in the Seahorse Wave Desktop software can automatically assign the groups, if the pretreatments, assay media and cell types have been correctly defined.\nAssign the defined groups to the wells by clicking the group on the left side and clicking the wells comprising the respective groups on the right side. The “distribute groups” button might be used and will fairly spread the groups on the plate. We recommend including at least four blanks on the plate. The software automatically suggests using the 4 edge wells as a background.\nDefine the protocol that is used for analyzing the cells. If only basal ECAR/OCR ratios are of interest, the measurement of a baseline without injection is sufficient. The protocol might, however, be altered depending on the desired read-out, and injections at different time points might be added. We recommend performing at least 4 measurement cycles.\nOnce the protocol is defined, it can be saved and re-opened when the measurement is started.\nCritical: Defining groups accurately and carefully will help you identify the experimental conditions long after the experiment was performed and will directly show you the results online on the device.\nCell counting and seeding\nTiming: Day 1, 2 h",
    "The cell number which needs to be seeded into the wells of a Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate depends on the size of the adherent cells. Typically, for HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13 cells, 70.000, 50.000, and 100.000 cells, respectively, yield a confluency of ∼90% on the next day, which can be checked by a conventional bright-field microscope. Such confluency is a good starting point for performing the experiments. Typical cell numbers seeded per well of a 24- or 96-well plate can be found in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. A typical layout for cell seeding is demonstrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1152_6.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1152-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical layout recommended for cell seeding\nRemove the cells, cultivated in a 10 cm cell culture dish (confluency of ∼ 90%), from the incubator and trypsinize cells under sterile conditions.\nAfter removing the cells from the incubator, aspirate the medium and wish twice with 6–10 mL pre-warmed PBS.\nAspirate PBS and add 2 mL of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA at a concentration of 0.05% in PBS to the cells and put the cell back into the incubator.\nCheck for cell detachment after 3 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 using a cell culture microscope. If cells appear round shaped, they detached from the surface of the culture dish, proceed to 3d. If cells are still attached, prolong the treatment in trypsin-EDTA/PBS but check every minute for cell detachment.\nAfter detachment, stop the enzymatic reaction immediately by adding at least the five- to the six-fold amount of the respective cell culture medium with 10% FCS (FCS will stop the reaction).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 rcf.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of cell culture full medium (DMEM + 10% FCS / RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS).\nTo seed similar amounts of cells, the cell number must be determined. This can be done by either using a Bürker-Türk counting chamber or any other method of choice (e.g., CASY cell counter).\nWhen using a Bürker-Türk counting adjust the glass plate to the chamber and fill each of the two chambers (on top and bottom) with 15 μL of the cell suspension. Take care to resuspend the cells thoroughly before pipetting them into the chamber.\nWhile different counting methods exist, we mainly counted the four large squares on the edges, with each square consisting of 16 smaller squares. Count all cells visible in the four large squares and divide this number by 4. Take the average number counted from the top and bottom chamber.\nThis number has to be multiplied by 10,000, which refers to the number of cells per milliliter cell suspension.\nSeed HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13 cells into the wells of a Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate as in the layout as previously defined in the group definition (step 2c and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and cultivate over-night.\nPrepare appropriate cell suspension dilutions.\nFor HEK293 cells, 70.000 cells should be seeded per well. If cells are cultivated in a final volume of 125 μL, adjust the number of cells to 560.000 / milliliter by diluting the cells with full medium (DMEM + 10% FCS).\nFor HeLa cells, 50.000 cells should be seeded per well. If cells are cultivated in a final volume of 125 μL, adjust the number of cells to 400.000 / milliliter by diluting the cells with full medium (DMEM + 10% FCS).",
    "For INS-1 832/13 cells, 100.000 cells should be seeded per well. If cells are cultivated in a final volume of 125 μL, adjust the number of cells to 800.000 / milliliter by diluting the cells with full medium (RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS).\nTransfer 125 μL of the diluted cell suspension into each well of the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate. Leave the 4 corner wells as a blank and do not seed cells into the edges!\nAdd 125 μL of full medium (DMEM + 10% FCS) into the 4 wells on the edges, which will serve as a blank during the measurement.\nOnce cells are seeded, put the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 and cultivate the cells 14–20 h to allow cell attachment.\nCritical: Keep the wells on the edges of the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate free from cells and add the same amount of complemented medium (DMEM + 10% FCS / RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS) instead, as these wells will serve as a blank during the measurement. The number of cells that need to be seeded to achieve a density of ∼ 90% on the next day highly depends on the cell type. For smaller cells as well as slowly growing cells, a higher cell number might be seeded.\nHydration of the sensor cartridge\nTiming: Day 1, 10 min\nThe sensor cartridge of the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer needs to be hydrated one day (6–48h) before the experiment.\nHydrate the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Remove the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge (green plate) from the 96-well plate (clear plate) with taking care of the sensor modules. Put the plate on the back so that the sensor modules look upwards and do not touch the ground.\nAdd 100 μL of calibrant solution delivered with the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridges into every well of the clear 96-well plate.\nRe-insert the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge (green plate) into the 96-well plate. Every sensor should be covered with a calibrant solution.\nPlace the hydrated Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge in a 37°C incubator WITHOUT CO2 and incubate 14–20 h.\nPre-warm the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer\nSwitch on the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer and start the controlling software one day before the experiment to allow the device to pre-warm.\nCheck the display of the device to ensure it is pre-heating.\nAdditional information about sensor hydration can be found at the page of the manufacturer – see https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XFe96_DAY_BEFORE_CARTRIDGE_HYDRATION.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XFe96_DAY_BEFORE_CARTRIDGE_HYDRATION.pdf]\nCritical: Avoid any damage to the sensors on the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge and remember to switch on the Seahorse device.\nComplementation and preparation of assay media\nTiming: Day 2, 30 min\nBefore conducting the assay, the respective Seahorse assay media need to be complemented by adding the desired amount of D-glucose, L-glutamine, and pyruvate. Additionally, the pH needs to be adjusted to 7.40 at 37°C to get consistent results.\nTransfer 48.725 mL of both Seahorse assay media, SM-0K+ and SM-140K+, into a sterile 50 mL falcon under sterile conditions and place in a 37°C water bath.\nOnce media are warmed, the desired amounts of D-glucose, L-glutamine, and pyruvate can be added.\nAs a starting point, we recommend using 5.5 mM D-glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.",
    "We also recommend using stock solutions to avoid dilution errors and to improve the accuracy of pipetting. Therefore, 275 μL of 1.0 M D-glucose, 500 μL of 100× L-glutamine, and 500 μL of 100× pyruvate should be added to 50 mL medium.\nAdjust the pH of the complemented media to 7.40.\nThe media can be placed in a beaker containing a stir bar and a thermometer on a magnetic stirrer equipped with a heating unit. Keep the temperature of the medium at 37°C during pH adjustment.\nWhen 37°C is reached, adjust the pH of the medium to 7.40 using 0.1 N NaOH for SM-0K+ or KOH for SM-140K+ medium. Add NaOH or KOH dropwise as the media are weakly buffered and be careful not to overshoot the desired pH.\nPrepare the media containing gramicidin or equivalent amounts of DMSO as a control.\nTransfer 2×10 mL of both media (SM-0K+ and SM-140K+) into 15 mL tubes and add gramicidin at a final concentration of 5 μM to the SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium.\nWe recommend preparing a 15 mM gramicidin stock solution in DMSO. Add 3.33 μL of this solution to each of the two vials containing the SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium, yielding a final gramicidin concentration of 5 μM. Using 5 μM of the pore-forming peptide gramicidin allows to permeabilize cells for K+ and to adjust the intracellular [K+] to the [K+] present in the extracellular space/ medium.\nTransfer 2×10 mL of both media (SM-0K+ and SM-140K+) into 15 mL tubes and add equivalent amounts of DMSO to the SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium.\nIf a 15 mM gramicidin stock was used, add 3.33 μL of DMSO to each of the two vials containing the SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium, yielding a final DMSO concentration of 0.033%.",
    "Keep all media at a temperature of 37°C using a water bath until usage.\nCritical: Adjust the pH to 7.40 for both media, SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ , carefully and slowly as the pH will alter very fast and the pH must not be re-arranged. Take care to adjust the pH at 37°C, as the assay is performed at this temperature. Adjusting pH at other temperatures will cause inaccurate measurements.\nOptional: Keep the medium free from D-glucose and inject glucose via the ports of the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge for being able to investigate the levels of non-glycolytic acidification.

To receive information about the effects of K+ depletion on the oxidative phosphorylation activity, oligomycin-A, an ATP-synthase inhibitor, FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, antimycin-A, a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, and rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor may be injected. For receiving more information about the glycolytic activity, D-glucose, oligomycin-A, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) may be injected. For more details about this procedure see https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf] and https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Glycolysis_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Glycolysis_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf].\nLoading sensor cartridge into the seahorse device\nTiming: Day 2, 10 min\nThe Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge and the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate are put separately into the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer, with Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge loaded first.\nRemove the hydrated Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge from the 37°C incubators and put it into the Seahorse Analyzer.\nRun the experiment that you have already designed with the Seahorse Wave Desktop Software on the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer. Once you click “run experiment”, the device will ask you to insert the hydrated sensor cartridge on top of the utility plate.",
    "Remove the lid from the plate and put the hydrated Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge into the device, with well A1 being the rear position on the left-back.\nConfirm the insertion of the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge. The device will close and start equilibrating the plate automatically.\nCritical: Remove the lid from the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge before putting it into the device. Not removing the lid will not give you results and might damage the device.\nPreparing cells for the assay\nTiming: Day 2, 1 h\nBefore starting the assay, cells need to be washed with the freshly prepared assay media and should be equilibrated. In case of seeding the same cell type in all 96-wells of the Seahorse XF96 cell culture plate, medium of the half of the plate should be exchanged for SM-0K+ medium to remove residual K+ from the culture medium and the medium of the other half of the plate should be exchanged for SM-140K+ medium to adjust the [K+] to the desired high concentration. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows a typical compound-layout if cells were seeded as demonstrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1152-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Typical layout recommended for cell treatment with the different media\nPrepare the cells for the extracellular flux analysis assay.\nRemove the cells from the incubator (humidified, 37°C, 5% CO2) and check the wells for cell confluency. Ideally, cells show a confluency of ∼90%. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nIf cells show a confluency of ∼90%, exchange medium twice with SM-0K+ or SM-140K+ buffer. One half of the plate should be treated with SM-0K+ medium, the other half with SM-140K+ medium.\nFirst, remove the culture medium from the cells, but leave 25 μL remaining in the wells and subsequently add 125 μL of the respective assay medium (SM-0K+, SM-140K+, both without DMSO or gramicidin).",
    "Second, remove the150 μL from the wells and add 150 μL of the respective assay medium (SM-0K+, SM-140K+, both without DMSO or gramicidin).\nTreat the cells with DMSO and gramicidin to modulate their intracellular [K+].\nRemove 150 μL of the media and add SM-0K+ + DMSO medium or SM-0K+ + gramicidin medium to half of the wells washed with SM-0K+ medium before.\nRemove 150 μL of the media from the cells and add SM-140K+ + DMSO medium or SM-140K+ + gramicidin medium to half of the wells washed with SM-140K+ medium before.\nCheck the wells for the presence and attachment of the cells within the wells using a microscope. As many washing steps were performed, the cells might detach.\nPlace the cells in a 37°C incubator without CO2 for 20 min to allow cell permeabilization by gramicidin, which leads to an adjustment of the intracellular [K+] to the extracellular [K+].\nAfter 20 min of incubation, remove the plate from the incubator and replace the SM-0K+ and SM-140K+ medium containing DMSO / gramicidin with the respective assay medium without DMSO and gramicidin.\nCarefully remove all 150 μL from the plate without disturbing or scraping the cells and replace with 150 μL of SM-0K+ or SM-140K+ free from DMSO, respectively.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C without CO2 for 10 min.\nRunning the assay\nTiming: Day 2, variable, depending on the protocol\nWhile preparing the cells for the assay and after loading the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge, the device will ask you for the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate. Load the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate when all incubation steps have been finished.\nRun the assay.",
    "Once the device asks you for the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate, insert the plate after incubation times are completed and confirm the insertion of the plate to start the experiment.\nDuring the experiment, the device will show you the measured values. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nCritical: The Incubation times of cells should not be shortened. Put the plate into the device immediately after the respective incubation times. Avoid spill over from the different wells during repetitive handling of the plates.\nFinishing the assay\nTiming: Day 2, 10 min\nFinish the assay by following the steps on the screen of the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer.\nOnce you confirm to finish the assay, the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge will move out of the device on top of the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate. Both plates can be discarded.\nOptional: Do not discard the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture plate if you want to normalize data for protein concentration (see step 17b) or other parameters of choice (i.e. DNA content, cell number or protein concentration). Data normalization is necessary if raw OCR and ECAR values are of interest. If no cell pre-treatment was performed, one can assume that cell numbers from well to well will not vary and data can be normalized for the seeded cell number. Alternatively, in cases where cell detachment after washing was observed, Seahorse data can be normalized for the protein concentration per well to correct for reduced cell numbers.\nNormalize OCR and ECAR values\nTiming: Day 3, variable, depending on the method\nThe data received from the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer can be normalized for the seeded cell number (17) or any other parameter of choice, e.g., the protein concentration per well (18).",
    "The easiest way to normalize the data is to use the Seahorse Wave Desktop software and normalizing the data for the seeded cell number.\nOpen the data from the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer in the Seahorse Wave Desktop software.\nThe software will show you the results/ raw data from the run.\nSelect “normalize” in the top bar within the software.\nEnter the seeded cell number / 103 for each well in the table and confirm the normalization by selecting “apply”.\nAfter confirmation, the software directly displays the normalized OCR and ECAR values over-time.\nAlternatively, in cases where cell detachment after washing was observed, Seahorse data can be normalized for the protein concentration per well to correct for reduced cell numbers.\nAfter finishing the Seahorse assay, take the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate and the Seahorse XF96 Sensor Cartridge from the device and discard the Sensor Cartridge.\nCarefully remove the supernatants of the cells without disturbing the cells at the bottom. We recommend removing the medium by pipetting.\nAir-dry the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for at least 1 h to remove any residual medium.\nAfter all of the medium has evaporated, freeze the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Plate over-night at -80°C.\nThe next day, take the plate from the -80°C freezer and thaw the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for at least 1 h.\nAfter the plate thawed, put the Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Plate into the -80°C freezer again for at least 2 h and repeat the freeze-thaw cycle two more times.\nAfter 3 consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, the plate can be used for protein-determination after the 3rd thawing process. A typical layout used for protein concentration determination is displayed in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].",
    "Prepare the working reagent (WR) of the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit by mixing 50 parts of BCA reagent A with 1 part of BCA reagent B.
