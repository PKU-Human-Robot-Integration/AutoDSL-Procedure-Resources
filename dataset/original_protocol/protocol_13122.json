    "1. Molecular cloning of Bifidobacterial genes\nPCR amplification of targeted genes by three vector primer sets (N-His, C-His, and N-His SUMO)\nMake 100 µM stock primer (oligomers) solutions by adding sterile water in the amounts determined by the company. Prepare 10 µM new stocks from these stocks to be used in PCR amplification of the target genes.\nPrepare the PCR mixture (total volume 50 µL) with 25 µL of master mix, 1 µL of forward and reverse primer at 0.2 µM, 21 µL of DNase/RNase-free distilled water and 2 µL of template DNA (bacterial cells) in the PCR tubes. Gently stir the mixture by pipetting up and down.\n\t\tNOTE: The master mix (Lucigen) used for PCR contains Taq DNA Polymerase with high purity and high activity and can work at higher temperatures for reliable amplification of templates up to 5 kb.\nSet the PCR program as follows: initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min for the release of genomic DNA, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, and the final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.\nCheck the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis method with a gel documentation systemafter being run at 100 V for 60 min on the 1% agarose gel. Mix the PCR products and DNA ladder with the loading dye by mixing at a ratio of 1:5 (5 µL of PCR product + 1 µL of loading dye and 5 µL of 1 kb DNA ladder + 1 µL of loading dye) to load on the gel (Figure 1).\nMeasure the DNA concentrations of PCR products using a fluorometer before the molecular cloning step.",
    "NOTE: Concentrations of PCR products should be in the range required for molecular cloning (25-100 ng/µL).\nPreparation of Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar medium for molecular cloning\nDissolve 12.5 g of LB and 6 g of agarose in 500 mL of dH2O and autoclave the LB agar medium (sterilization at 121 °C for 20 min).\nDissolve 15 mg of kanamycin with 1 mL of dH2O and store at -20 °C.\nAfter autoclaving, add 1 mL of kanamycin into the bottle containing the sterile 500 mL of LB agar medium.

Pour 25 mL of LB agar kanamycin media into each plate in the laboratory cabinet.\nHeat shock transformation of chemically competent E. coli cells\nAdd 1-3 µL (25 to 100 ng) of the PCR products for each strain into the tube, including 40 µL of chemically competent E. coli cells. Then, add 2 µL of the vector DNA to the same tube. Stir gently with the pipette tip and transfer the mixtures to 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform this step on ice. Do not pipette up and down to mix to avoid air bubbles and inadvertently warming cells.\nIncubate the tubes containing the competent cells and DNA on ice for 30 min. Apply heat shock to the mixture in a 42 °C water bath for 45 s. Put these tubes on ice immediately and incubate for 2 min.\nAdd 960 µL of the Recovery Medium, used for the rapid recovery of cells after molecular cloning, to the cells in the tubes and incubate the tubes at 250 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator.",

After autoclaving, add 1 mL of kanamycin into the bottle containing the sterile 300 mL of LB medium. Store the liquid culture medium at +4 °C until using it.\nScreening of transformants by colony PCR\nTo confirm all transformants carry the recombinant genes, select colonies randomly and amplify the target genes by PCR using the sequencing primers supplied with the cloning kit.\nPerform all the steps on ice and pre-chill all PCR tubes and 15 mL tubes before use.\nUsing a pipette tip, transfer half of a selected colony to the PCR tube for each sample. Take another half of the colony with the pipette tip and put it into the 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of LB+kanamycin liquid medium (prepared in step 1.4). Vortex the 15 mL tubes and incubate the liquid cultures at 250 rpm at 37 °C overnight in a shaking incubator.\nPut 50 µL of PCR reaction mixture (25 µL of master mix, 1 µL of forward primer, 1 µL of reverse primer, 23 µL of DNase/RNase-free distilled water) into all PCR tubes and disperse the cells by pipetting up and down gently.",
    "Set the PCR program at 95 °C for 5 min for the release of genomic DNA by lysing bacterial cells, a total of 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s for initial denaturation, 60 °C for 30 s for annealing, 72 °C for 1 min for elongation, and 72 °C for 10 min for the final extension.\nCheck the PCR products by gel electrophoresis method after being run at 100 V for 60 min on the 1% agarose gel (Figure 3).

Centrifuge at 3724 x g for 15 min at +4 °C and discard the supernatant.",
    "For 50 mL culture pellets, add 6,300 µL of lysis buffer and 63 µL of EDTA-free halt protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100 ratio) into the pellets and dissolve by pipetting up and down. Incubate them on ice for 30 min, vortex every 10 min.\nSet the pulse mode of the sonicator as 10 s ON and 59 s OFF, and the amplitude as 37%. Place the tube in a beaker containing ice and immerse the probe of the sonicator in the tube.\n\tNOTE: The probe should be immersed completely without touching any side of the tube.\nAfter the sonication process (6 pulses for 10 s with 1 min cooling), centrifuge the samples at 3,724 x g for 45 min at +4 °C. Next, collect all the supernatant parts in a tube and centrifuge at 3,724 x g for 5 min at +4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant into a tube and take 100 µL of the sample for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in step 4.7.
