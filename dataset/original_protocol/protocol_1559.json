The genetically modified lentiviral vectors lack dispensable genes from the HIV-1 genome and separate cis-acting sequences from trans-acting factors required for viral particle production, infection, and integration. A third-generation packaging system provides maximal biosafety but requires the transfection of four separate plasmids, including three helper plasmids and one lentiviral vector expressing genes of interest (Dull et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). To ensure the high reprogramming efficiency, it is critical to prepare high-quality supercoiled plasmids and make lentiviruses with excellent titers. For detailed information about lentivirus preparation, titration and applications, please see our previous studies (Ding et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nExpanding HEK293T cells.\nCulture HEK293T cells in HEK culture medium one week before starting the preparation of viruses. Pass them at about 80% confluency twice.\nFor each 10 cm plate, seed about 8 × 10 6 HEK cells in 10 mL medium and gently mix well to let cells distribute evenly on the surface. The next day, the cell density should be about 80% confluency for transfection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1127-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Lentivirus preparation and titration\n(A) HEK cells at transfection with ∼80% confluency.\n(B) At virus collection (72 h post-transfection) almost all HEK cells are transfected positive (plasmid #1 with co-expressed GFP).\n(C) Virus titration with undiluted virus (#1) at 72 h post-transduction (> 90% cells are GFP positive).\n(D) Virus titration with 1:10 diluted virus (#1) at 72 h post-transduction (∼40% cells are positive).\n(E) Virus titration of undiluted virus (#2) at 72 h post-transduction with immunocytochemistry (ICC) of ISL1 (∼90% cells are positive).",
    "(F) Virus titration with 1:10 diluted virus (#2) at 72 h post-transduction with ICC of ISL1 (∼40% cells are positive). From A to F, scale bares, 100 μm.\nTransfection and lentivirus collection Before transfection, prepare high quality supercoiled plasmids (Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Lentiviral plasmid DNA will be delivered by the Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated transfection method.\nWe use the third-generation lentiviral packing system which consists of three helper plasmids, including pRSV-Rev (3rd generation lentiviral packaging plasmid contains Rev), pMDLg/pRRE (3rd generation lentiviral packaging plasmid contains Gag and Pol), and pMD2.G (VSV-G envelope expressing plasmid). Two lentiviral vectors expressing reprogramming factors are plasmids pCSC-SP-PW-CMV-Ngn2-IRES-GFP-T2A-mSOX11 (Plasmid#1) and pCSC-ISL1-T2A-LHX3 (Plasmid#2).\nFor each 10 cm plate, add 4 μg of plasmid#1 or plasmid#2; 2 μg of pMDLg/pRRE plasmid; 1 μg of pMD2.G plasmid and 0.5 μg of pRSV-Rev plasmid to 1 mL DMEM (-FBS) media and mix well.\nAdd 22.5 μL transfection reagent PEI (1 μg/μL) to plasmids mixture and immediately mix well by gently pipetting up and down 5 times or vortexing for 15 s. Incubate at room temperature for 15–20 min.\nNote: The ratio of PEI to the mixture of total DNA is 1:3. For example, the total amount of DNA is 7.5 μg for a 10 cm plate. Add 22.5 μL of PEI (equivalent to 22.5 μg) into the plasmid mixture in 1 mL DMEM.\nAdd 1 mL of transfection dropwise to each 10 cm plate of HEK293 cells and gently mix to distribute transfection regent evenly.\nAfter 8 h transfection or overnight, replace with 10 mL HEK culture medium for each 10 cm plate.\nCollect lentiviral supernatant completely (around 10 mL) at 48 h post-transfection and add 10 mL fresh culture medium. Store this first collection of lentiviral supernatant at 4°C.",
    "Another 24 h later (72 h post-transfection), collect lentiviral supernatant again and store at 4°C. Discard the plates in a biohazard bag and trash it after autoclave.\nNote: Transfection efficiency can be examined under a fluorescence microscope if the lentiviral vector contains GFP reporter (e.g. plasmid #1). At lentivirus collection, most HEK cells (>90%) should be GFP (+) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPool two collections of the same lentivirus together and add 6 μg/mL polybrene. Filter the viral supernatants with 0.45 μm vacuum filters. Store viral supernatants at 4°C until ready to use (within two weeks) or freeze at −80°C for longer term storage.\nCritical: The ratio of PEI to plasmids should be 4:1 to 3:1. Lesser or higher ratios decrease the efficiency of virus production. When you add transfection mixture to HEK293 cells, just gently move the plate on the base up-down and left-right for 10 times. Do not move circular to prevent pooling transfection mixture in the center.\nTitration to verify the quality of lentivirus.\nThe virus can be titrated based on GFP reporter (plasmid#1) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D) or immunocytochemistry (ICC) of lentivirus expressed factors (plasmid#2) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F) as previously reported (Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nSeed HEK cells in a 24 well plate at a density of 7–10 × 104 cells/well/0.5 mL medium. Cells will reach ∼70 % confluency the next day at the time of titration.\nMake a serial dilution (e.g., 1:10, 1:100 etc.) of viral supernatant with HEK culture medium.\nAdd 50 μL of undiluted and diluted lentivirus to desired wells.\nNote: Before addition of lentivirus, do not need to remove original culture medium from 24-well plate. Set one well as a negative control without transduction.\nChange the medium after 8 h or overnight (∼16 h) exposure to lentivirus.",
    "Check the percentage of positive cells after 48–72 h.\nNote: For lentivirus expressing GFP reporter, examine GFP (+) cells directly under a fluorescence microscope in living cells. For lentivirus that does not express fluorescent reporters, cells need to be fixed and perform ICC to examine lentivirus-expressed factors.\nRoutinely, transduced positive cells should be more than 90% in undiluted wells and more than 30% in 10-fold diluted wells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C–1F).\nCritical: A good titer of lentiviral supernatants should be no less than 1 × 106 IFU/mL. (IFU, Infectious Unit).\nHuman fibroblast culture\nTiming: 5–10 days\nFibroblast culture and expansion. If starting to culture fibroblast from a frozen stock, it is recommended to split cells twice before seeding on Matrigel coated plates for reprogramming.\nNote: You can freeze fibroblasts in DMEM contains 15% FBS and 10% DMSO using cryotubes at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL/vial.\nNote: Passage number of fibroblasts is important for conversion. Cells with high passage numbers (>15) show slow growth and the low conversion rate.\nQuickly thaw a frozen stock of human fibroblast in a 37°C water bath.\nWhen there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial, immediately transfer cells into a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of fibroblast culture medium and gently mix.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 3 min to collect cells.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet into 10 mL fibroblast culture medium and seed cells in one 10 cm plate.\nChange media every two or three days until close to full confluency.\nSplit fibroblast. Wash the cells with 1× PBS and detach them by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin (make 1:5 dilution of 0.25% trypsin with 1× PBS) at 37°C for 4 min.\nWhen cells reach about 80% confluency, they will be ready for setting direct reprogramming.",
    "Critical: The growth speed varies dramatically between different cell lines. Some aged or patient fibroblasts may grow slowly. During culture of these slow-growth cells, the medium must be changed regularly every two or three days to facilitate the cell growth and maintain antibiotics effective in the culture. The splitting ratio could be from 1: 2 to 1: 5 depending on the growth.\nFibroblast transduction and motor neurons induction\nTiming: 15–20 days (4–16 h for step 5; 24 h for step 6; 14 days for step 7)\nPrepare Matrigel-coated plates.\nDilute Matrigel at 1:100 with cold DMEM medium.\nAdd 5 mL of diluted Matrigel to each 10 cm plate and gently shake to ensure to cover all the bottom surface of the plate.\nIncubate at 37°C more than 3 h or overnight.\nNote: Matrigel is sensitive to temperature. When working with Matrigel, place the aliquot of Matrigel on ice or ice pack within the biosafety cabinet.\nSeed proper amount of fibroblasts onto Matrigel-coated plates.\nFibroblasts at about 90% confluency will be harvested by trypsinization.\nSeed ∼1 × 106 cells for a Matrigel-coated 10 cm plate.\nNote: A 10 cm plate with ∼90% confluency usually give rise to ∼3 million fibroblast cells. It is enough for seeding three 10 cm plates. The seeding numbers should be optimized according to cell growth to ensure that the cell density will be around 60%–80% confluency in next day at transduction.\nThis step describes the induction of directly reprogrammed motor neurons from fibroblasts. The neural induction media is used at this stage.\nThe day after seeding fibroblast onto the Matrigel-coated plate, cell density should be around 60%–80% confluency at transduction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1127-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The transduced positive cells can be identified with co-expressed GFP. Scale bars: 400 μm.\nMix the desired volume of two lentiviruses (1:1) in the presence of 6 μg/mL polybrene.\nAdd proper amount of lentiviral supernatants to the plate to transduce fibroblasts. For a 10 cm plate, add ∼20 mL of total lentivirus expressing 4 reprograming factors.\nNote: The lentiviral dosage should be optimized based on the viral titer and the growth of the cell line. Do not need to remove original culture medium before addition of lentiviruses to the plate.\nCells are exposed to lentiviruses overnight (∼16 h) in incubator.\nThe next morning, replace the media with fresh fibroblast medium. This is the first day post-viral infection (1 dpi).\nThe next day (2 dpi), change the neural induction medium.\nChange half volume of neural induction medium every the other day at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 dpi.\nNote: For a good transduction, most (>90%) fibroblast cells are GFP (+) and then gradually become neuron-like cells within 2 weeks post-viral infection (wpi) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1127-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative morphology of fibroblasts and directly induced motor neurons (diMNs) at indicated weeks post-viral infection (wpi)\nTransduced cells are identified with co-expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) at early time points (0.5 and 2 wpi).

More complicated branches and very long axons can be detected at late developmental stages with immunostaining of tubulin Beta 3 Class III (TUBB3). Scale bars: 100 μm.

    "Critical: Addition of proper amount of high-quality lentiviruses is very important to ensure good reprogramming efficiency. The proper MOI (Multiplicity of Infection) could be used are 5–8 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). As the properties of cells (such as growth speed) will influence the transduction efficiency, different cell lines may need different dosages to obtain optimized transduction efficiency. However, too much viruses could cause more cell death. Transduction efficiency and cell survival should be balanced.\nPurify reprogramed neurons by replating\nTiming: 5–7 days (3 h for step 9)\nThis step describes purification of reprogrammed neurons from fibroblasts by replating cells with gelatin coated plates. The attachment of fibroblast cells will occur earlier and more tightly than reprogrammed neurons. Purified neurons will be seeded onto coverslips with a monolayer of astrocytes for long-term culture (2–10 wpi) in neural maturation medium. For primary astrocytes isolation and monolayer astrocyte preparation, please refer (Schildge et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCulture astrocyte cells. Isolate mouse astrocytes from postnatal day 1 (P1) pups and culture them in DMEM with 15% FBS. Prepare frozen stocks at ∼1 × 106 cells/vial. Start culturing of astrocytes at least 5 days before replating.\nThaw astrocytes frozen stocks and culture them in astrocyte culture media in 10 cm cell culture plates.\nNote: Seed cells from one vial of frozen stock (1 × 106 cells) on one 10 cm plate. It will take about 3 days to reach around 90% confluency.\nCoat 24-well plates contain cover slips with Matrigel (1:100) at least for 3 h in 37°C for seeding astrocytes.\nWhen astrocytes reach ∼90% confluency in the 10 cm plate, trypsinize astrocytes with 0.025% trypsin (make 1:10 dilution of 0.25% trypsin with 1× PBS) for 3 min at 37°C.\nAdd astrocyte medium to neutralize trypsin and detach cells.",
    "Transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 200 g for 3 min to collect cells.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet into 12 mL astrocyte medium.\nSeed astrocytes onto coverslips in a 24-well plate at 0.5 mL/well.\nChange medium every two days until astrocytes form monolayer on coverslips.\nNote: One full 10 cm plate of astrocytes is enough for seeding a 24-well plate. If astrocytes reach full confluency on coverslips before neurons are ready for replating, add 10 μM Ara-C in culture medium to inhibit cell amplification.\nInfected fibroblasts (GFP +) at 14 dpi will show typical neuron-like morphology (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). These cells could be directly used for early developmental analysis or replated onto monolayer astrocytes for long-term culture.\nCoat culture plates with 5 mL of 0.1% gelatin for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: For one 10 cm plate of reprogrammed cells, need two 10 cm plates for replating to ensure efficient purification.\nRemove culture medium from culture plates with induced neurons and wash once with PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of 0.025% trypsin (make 1:10 dilution of 0.25% trypsin with 1× PBS) to a 10 cm plate and incubate for 3 min at 37°C to detach the cells.\nAdd 7 mL fibroblast culture medium to quench trypsin activity. Gently pipet up and down to break cell aggregates.\nTransfer cell suspension to gelatin-coated plates (about 5 mL each).\nNote: Remove gelatin just before use. Avoid air drying coated plates.\nIncubate plates at 37°C and keep checking the attachment of cells under microscope.\nNote: It will take 15–30 min to see differential adhesion which means most fibroblasts attach at the bottom and the reprogrammed neurons (GFP+) are still floating.\nCollect cell suspensions and transfer to a 15 mL tube. Pool cell suspensions from two plates together.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 g for 3 min to collect cells.\nRemove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellets into neural maturation medium with desired volume based on the yield and the following experimental plans.\nNote: The neurons generated from one 10 cm plate are enough for seeding a 24-well plate with the cell density ∼2 × 104 cells/well.\nCritical: The proper length of incubating time is important during replating. Too short, most fibroblasts are still floating, and the purity of neurons is low. If incubation time is too long, more neurons could also attach at the bottom and may lead to poor yield. The best time point is that the majority of fibroblasts attached at the bottom and few neurons attached.\nNeuronal identity verification\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes how to validate the MN identity of reprogrammed neurons using ICC of different markers.\nTake coverslips from 24-well plates at desired time points.\nNote: As early as 2 wpi, the generic neuronal markers of TUBB3 and early MN marker HB9 could be examined. At 4 wpi or later, MAP2 and mature MN marker CHAT could be examined (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1127-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(E) Fractions of diMNs among the reprogrammed neurons was shown as the percentage of TUBB3 (+) cells expressed CHAT. From C to E, data are presented as mean ± SEM. More than 300 cells of each line were counted from triplicates.\nAdapted from (Ding et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) with permission.\nFix cultured cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash twice with PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature for permeabilization and blocking.\nCells are then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight (∼16 h).\nNote: The antibodies include anti-TUBB3 and anti-MAP2 as neuronal markers, anti-HB9 as an early MN marker, anti-CHAT as a late MN marker, and anti-SYN1 as a presynaptic marker.\nAfter removal of primary antibodies, wash coverslips with PBS for 10 min × 4.\nIncubated with corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in dark at room temperature for 2 h.\nWash coverslips with PBS for 10 min × 3.\nThe nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:3000) in PBS at room temperature for 15 min.\nBriefly wash coverslips once with PBS.\nMount coverslips with mounting medium on microslides.\nAir dry the coverslips and visualize cells under a confocal microscope.\nCritical: The examination of different markers need to use samples at different time points. The best time frame for staining nuclear HB9 is 2–3 wpi, and the best time for staining CHAT is 4 wpi or later (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). For staining presynaptic markers and electrophysiology assay, need reprogrammed MNs reach the full maturation at 6 wpi or later (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). For the changes of properties at different developmental stages during the reprogramming process, please refer to our previous report (Ding et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1127-Fig5.jpg",
