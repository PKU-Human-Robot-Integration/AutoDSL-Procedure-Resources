Participants perform a primary visual detection task followed by a secondary confidence task. For the visual detection task, present only two types of stimuli: catch stimuli (i.e., one empty checkerboard per hemifield) and target stimuli (i.e., one checkerboard containing the gray circles’ contrast value corresponding to the individual perceptual threshold per hemifield). Akin to the titration task, participants press the spacebar whenever they perceive the target stimulus and withhold the response whenever no target stimulus is perceived (i.e., when catch stimuli are presented). In addition, following their primary response, they provide a confidence rating on a Likert scale with 4 levels of confidence regarding their percept.\nOpen the task in E-prime and enter in the list of stimuli to present during task execution, the two values identified as threshold values for the left and right hemifields target stimulus.\nExplain instructions:\nExplain the primary visual detection task;\nExplain that after stimulus presentation the participant will be asked how confident they are about their perception with a value from 1 to 4, ranging from low confidence to high confidence, pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard;",
    "Before starting the task, instruct the participant to place the right hand in a comfortable position to promptly press the spacebar and the left hand in correspondence to the four numbers necessary to provide the confidence rating;\nAgain, ask the participant to maintain the gaze on the fixation cross while reducing the brightness of the room.\nEEG recording:\nCheck the quality of the signal;\nInstruct the participant about the possible artifacts that can affect the signal and suggest tips that may help maintain artifacts to a minimum throughout the recording;\nReiterate your request to the participant to stay as relaxed as possible while recording their EEG signal;\nStart the recording.\nRun the E-prime script to launch the stimulus presentation and data collection during the visual detection task.\nOnce started, double-check that your set up is up and running by checking for the effective presence of triggers on the ongoing EEG recording.\nNote: Start the EEG recording at least ten seconds before the start of the task and end at least ten seconds after the end of the behavioral task, to allow for the subsequent application of filters during the signal processing.\nCorrelational approach (experiment 1): Resting state\nTiming: 2 min\nAfter the end of the task, record a eyes-closed 2 min resting-state EEG.\nCorrelational approach (experiment 1): Computing task performance\nTiming: 1 h for each participant",
    "This step enables the estimation of behavioral performance in the visual detection task and in the confidence task. Specifically, calculate accuracy rate (i.e., the percentage of correct responses) and perceptual sensitivity, (i.e., the d’ sensitivity index). The latter considers both correct responses and false alarms, discounting any potential effect of response bias (Green and Swets, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Moreover, estimate both confidence rate (i.e., the mean of confidence reports) and metacognitive performance of each participant (i.e., the meta d’ measure (Maniscalco and Lau, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib48]). Meta d' quantifies the accuracy of confidence ratings to discriminate objectively correct from erroneous responses.\nBehavioral analyses:\nAccuracy rate:\nSort trials in correct and errors trials. Correct trials consist of correctly detected target trials (i.e., hits) and correctly detected catch trials (i.e., correct rejections). Error trials consist of misses after target trials and false alarms after catch trials;\nCalculate percentage of correct trials for each participant.\nPerceptual sensitivity (d’ score):\nCalculate z-scores of Hit rate (i.e., zH) and false alarms (i.e., zFA);\nd’ is the difference d’=z(H) – z(FA).\nConfidence rate:\nReport for all correct trials the corresponding confidence rating;\nCalculate the mean of confidence rating for each participant.\nMetacognitive performance (meta d’ score):\nMerge low confidence ratings (i.e., confidence responses 1 and 2) and high confidence ratings (confidence responses 3 and 4) trials;\nCreate an array of participants type 2 hit rate (percentage of high confidence correct trials) and type 2 false alarm rate (percentage of high confidence error trials);\nCalculate the criterion “c”, where c = -.5∗ [z(H) + z(FA)].\nNote: Estimate meta d’ using the function fit_metad_SSE on MatLab.\nCorrelational approach (experiment 1): Electrophysiological processing and analysis\nTiming: 3 h for each participant",
    "This step enables looking at electrophysiological correlates of task performance. Specifically, look at the relationship between individual alpha frequency (IAF) and alpha amplitude for perceptual accuracy and sensitivity and for confidence rating and metacognitive performance.\nNote: Perform EEG analyses using EEGLab.\nEEG preprocessing steps:\nRe-reference data to the average of all electrodes;\nEdit channel locations accordingly to a standard template (i.e., standard-10-5-cap385);\nDownsample the data from 1000 Hz to 500 Hz;\nApply pass-band filter (0.5–30 Hz);\nData epoching around stimulus onset (-1500 milliseconds–2000 milliseconds);\nExclude from EEG data artifacts-contaminated epochs using the pop_autorej and pop_jointprobab in EEGLab;\nExclude EOG epochs with amplitude > 800 μv;\nCorrect remaining artifacts with the linear regression procedure using pop_lms_regression function in EEGLab;\nSort EEG epochs according to the stimulus location (i.e., right visual field RVF and left visual field LVF stimuli);\nCopy and flip EEG data, for RVF-stimuli epochs, from the contralateral (left) electrodes to right-sided electrodes. In this way, all contralateral activity is on one side, which is conventionally defined to be the right;\nSort EEG epochs accordingly to the behavioral condition (i.e., correct vs error trials; high vs low confidence trials).\nCritical: Apply the described procedure to all EEG data using the same parameters.\nEEG analysis:\nCalculate pre-stimulus IAF. IAF is defined as the local maximum power within the alpha frequency (7–13 Hz) range:\nSet the baseline between -1500 and -1000 ms;\nApply fast Fourier transformation (FFT) (MATLAB function spectopo, frequency resolution: 0.166 Hz) and set the analysis window in the pre-stimulus period (-1000 to 0 ms);\nNormalize power by z-score decibel (dB=10∗log10[-power/baseline]) transformation at each frequency;\nIdentify in the spectrogram the contralateral electrode with larger power and clear peak in the alpha band;\nIndividual alpha-frequency is the local maximum power within the frequency range 7–13 Hz (i.e., alpha peak).",
    "Calculate pre-stimulus alpha-amplitude in the time frequency data:\nRe-epoch data around stimulus onset (-2000 ms–2000 ms);\nNote: Longer epochs prevent edge artifacts from contaminating time frequency power in the time windows of interest.\nExtract time-frequency data using a complex sinusoidal wavelet convolution procedure (between 2 and 25 cycles per wavelet, linearly increasing across 50 linear-spaced frequencies from 2.0 Hz to 50.0 Hz) with the newtimef function in EEGLab;\nNormalize power by decibel (dB=10∗log10[-power/baseline]) transformation at each frequency, using a single trial baseline between -1000 and -500 ms preceding stimulus onset;\nNote: Use this long baseline window to increase the signal-to-noise ratio during the baseline period.\nSelect the contralateral electrode with larger power in the alpha band;\nCalculate mean alpha (7–13 Hz) amplitude in pre-stimulus-stimulus interval (-500 to 0 ms).\nCalculate post-stimulus alpha-amplitude in the time frequency data:\nTime-frequency data are extracted as for step b (see above);\nCalculate mean alpha (7–13 Hz) amplitude in post-stimulus interval (0–900 ms).\nNote: Perform all analyses separately for each participant and condition.\nNote: Use parieto-occipital electrodes in the contralateral hemisphere, along with analogous electrodes in the ipsilateral hemisphere for all of the analyses.\nStatistical analysis:\nWithin participants:\nCompare parameters of alpha activity between the two HEMISPHERES (contralateral vs ipsilateral electrode) and for accuracy (correct vs error trials) and confidence (high vs low confidence trials) in 2 × 2 repeated measures mixed-model ANOVAs;\nTest differences between conditions by two-tailed t-test (planned comparisons).\nBetween participants analyses (perceptual sensitivity):\nDivide participants in two numerically equivalent groups using the median split of the d’ scores (high vs low d’);\nCompare IAF between groups using one-tailed unpaired two-sample t-test.\nBetween participants analyses (metacognitive performance):\nDivide participants in two numerically equivalent groups using the median split of the meta d’ scores (high vs low meta d’);",
    "Compare post-stimulus alpha amplitude between groups using one-tailed unpaired two-sample t-test. The relation between pre-stimulus alpha activity and perception was already reported in previous studies (Samaha et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]; Samaha and Postle, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). In particular, alpha-amplitude suppression can predict higher level of subjective confidence in response to visual stimuli (Benwell et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Iemi et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Samaha et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]) while faster alpha-frequency was related to better objective perceptual accuracy (Samaha and Postle, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). In this sense, we expected, in the between participants analyses, that alpha-amplitude suppression accounted for better individual metacognitive performance and faster alpha-frequency accounted for better objective accuracy. Accordingly, we used one-tailed t-test for these analyses.\nCritical: Electrode selection requires visual inspection of the power-spectrum of all parieto-occipital electrodes. A double-blind check is necessary.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Titration session\nTiming: 45 min\nRun a titration session before the main experimental session in order to set stimuli contrast ratios corresponding to each individual’s 50% perceptual threshold. Procedure should be the same as in Experiment 1.\nRun a titration session.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Subject preparation for EEG setup\nTiming: 30–45 min\nThis section describes EEG montage. Careful and homogenous EEG setup across participants is especially important in this protocol due to online application of rhythmic TMS. In order to minimize the impact of TMS-induced artifact on the EEG signal, here-described steps have to be carefully followed in order to reduce the duration of the artifact and its trial-by trial variability.\nCap placement: The electrode positions are used as landmarks to localize the stimulation site, thus particular care should be taken when centering the EEG cap:",
    "Center the cap at the sagittal plane by using the distance between the inion (the bony protrusion at the back of the skull) and nasion (the bony ridge between the eyebrows);\nCenter the cap at the coronal plane by using the distance between the earlobes.\nReducing electrode impedance:\nSkin preparation: clean the skin at the electrode-skin contact by scrubbing with alcohol and a cotton swab;\nApply and distribute electrode gel by a cotton swab until desired impedance is reached for all of the electrodes (ground, reference and EOG electrodes: < 5 kΩ; remaining electrodes: < 10 kΩ).\nCritical: Regularly check and adjust electrode impedance during the whole experiment.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Resting-state EEG recording and IAF estimation\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section describes the EEG resting-state recording. For the Experiment 2 and 3, resting-state EEG should be recorded and analyzed at once in order to titrate stimulation parameters for every participant. This step is necessary to determine the exact time lag between the pulses in a 5-pulse train, in order to selectively and efficiently change the speed or amplitude of alpha oscillatory activity of the participant.\nResting state eyes-closed recording for 3 min: Have participants comfortably seated in a dimmed-lit room with their eyes closed while recording their EEG activity.\nResting state eyes-open recording for 3 min: Have participants comfortably seated in a dimmed-lit room with gaze on a fixation cross on a screen while recording their EEG activity.\nNote: Order of eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state recordings should be randomized between subjects.\nPause point: Participants could take a break after finishing the resting-state session.\nEstimation of individual alpha frequency peak from eyes-open resting state:\nPre-processing of the signal:\nRe-referencing to average;\nRe-sampling to 500 Hz;\nApplying a low-pass (0.5 Hz) and high-pass (50 Hz) filter.",
    "Estimating IAF:\nIn line with Experiment 1 (showing a local alpha power maxima over O2) and previous studies, calculate alpha-frequency from the O2 electrode, over which rhythmic-TMS is subsequently applied;\nApply fast Fourier transformation (FFT), and calculate power spectra. IAF is defined as the local maximum power within the alpha frequency range (7–13 Hz);\nDouble-check the peak visually.\nNote: If the clear peak in the alpha range is not visible during eyes-open resting-state on the O2 electrode, consider adjacent electrodes (PO8 and PO4).\nNote: If the clear peak in the alpha range is not visible during eyes-open resting-state on posterior electrodes, consider using eyes-closed resting-state for estimating IAF.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Conducting main experimental task\nTiming: 50 min\nThis section describes the main experimental procedure for Experiment 2 and 3. Please note that stimuli and tasks in Experiment 2 and 3 are the same as those described for Experiment 1, with the main difference being the active manipulation of alpha activity via the TMS entrainment protocol. Specifically, in Experiment 2, a five-pulses TMS train is delivered over the right occipital cortex (O2) right before stimulus presentation (where the last TMS pulse coincided with onset of the stimulus appearance), and rhythmic-TMS pulse trains could occur at three different frequencies: at the individual alpha-frequency of the participant to manipulate pre-stimulus alpha-amplitude (IAF group); at 1 Hz lower than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF-1 Hz group) to slow-down pre-stimulus alpha-frequency; or at 1 Hz higher than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF+1 Hz group) to speed-up pre-stimulus alpha-frequency. On the other hand, Experiment 3 aimed to selectively enhance post-stimulus alpha-amplitude, prior to the confidence prompt. As such, only one entrainment protocol is applied (i.e., stimulation at the individual alpha-frequency), with the final rhythmic-TMS pulse coinciding with the onset of the confidence prompt.",

Entrainment protocols and outcomes: Pre-stimulus alpha activity was fine-tuned relative to individual alpha-frequency using rhythmic five-pulse TMS bursts in which the time lag between pulses was manipulated depending on the group\nTo induce changes in the alpha-frequency cycle length, rhythmic-TMS was applied at a slower (in blue) or faster pace (in green), relative to a participant’s individual alpha-frequency. To selectively modulate alpha-amplitude, the frequency of the rhythmic-TMS pulse trains was matched to the intrinsic individual alpha-frequency of the participant, thus enhancing the synchronization of neural firing and phase alignment without influencing the speed of alpha activity (in red). In this way, rhythmic-TMS pulse trains could occur at three different frequencies: at the individual alpha-frequency of the participant to manipulate pre-stimulus alpha-amplitude (IAF group, in red); at 1 Hz lower than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF-1 Hz group, in blue) to slow-down pre-stimulus alpha-frequency; or at 1 Hz higher than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF+1 Hz group, in green) to speed-up pre-stimulus alpha-frequency.\nIAF – 1 Hz group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI = 1000/ (IAF -1);\nIAF group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI = 1000/ (IAF);\nIAF + 1 Hz group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI = 1000/ (IAF + 1).",
