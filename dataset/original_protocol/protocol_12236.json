  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described in this protocol have been approved by the institutional animal ethics committee and follow the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.\nNote: To maintain sterile/specific pathogen-free housing conditions, conduct all procedures involving direct handling of live mice inside a biological safety cabinet or a laminar flow hood. Clean or sterilize cages, restraining devices, housing materials, chow and water provided to the animals appropriately. Use only sterile, disposable needles for the injections and for blood sampling. Aseptic technique is crucial during preparation of the graft.\n1. Preparation of Recipient Mice\nIdentify recipient mice with ear notches (or other method approved by the local animal ethics committee8) to enable individual follow up of peripheral blood and bone marrow reconstitution over time. Weigh the mice for post-transplant follow-up. Use recipient mice that are between 7 and 12 weeks old (less than 25 g).\n\tNote: In the provided example, CD45.1+ CD45.2+ recipient mice were bred in house by crossing C57Bl/6 mice with congenic B6.SJL mice.\nIrradiate recipient mice with two doses of 450 rad to destroy hematopoietic activity. Give the first dose the day before transplantation and the second 1-2 hr before transplantation.\n\tNote: X-ray or gamma rays can both be used depending on the availability of appropriate facilities.\n2. Preparation of Donor and Competitor Bone Marrow Cells\nEuthanize donor (test and control; CD45.2+) and competitor (CD45.1+; B6.SJL) mice by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation or using methods approved by the local animal ethics committee.\nPlace mice on their back, legs open wide, in an empty petri dish or on a sterile gauze (to keep the work surface clean) inside a biological safety cabinet. Wet the skin and fur with 70% ethanol/30% H2O (v/v).",
    "Cut off the foot with a surgical blade or sharp scissors. Cut open the skin along the leg and pull away the skin using serrated forceps. Cut away excess muscle.\nDislocate femur by pulling on the leg bone and using scissor blades against the pelvic bones as a counter force. Detach tibia and femur from the kneecap and remove remaining bits of muscle and tendons. Place the bones in 2-3 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a 6-well tissue culture plate.\nCollect bone marrow cells by flushing the bones with 5 ml sterile PBS.\n\t\nHold the bone gently with forceps and insert a 25 G needle attached to a filled 1 ml syringe to one end of the bone. Press the plunger and collect the cells in a 15 ml conical tube. Repeat as needed until the center of the bone is white.\nDissociate the cells by repeated passing through the needle to obtain a single cell suspension. Avoid bubbles and excess force. Note: Use a slightly larger needle (22 G) to improve cell viability at this step.\nPass the cells through a 70 µm nylon strainer to ensure uniform cell suspension and to remove debris and clumps.\nRemove an aliquot for cell counting using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the remaining cell suspension at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Readjust cell density as required in sterile PBS (108 cells/ml). Keep the cells on ice.\n3. Establishing Donor Cell HSC Equivalents",
    "Transfer the equivalent of 3 x 106 cells (30 µl) into a 5 ml round bottom polystyrene tube for flow cytometry staining. Add an equal volume of unlabeled antibody against CD16/CD32 to block non-specific staining (diluted in staining buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mM EDTA) for a final concentration of 2.5 µg/ml). Incubate 5 min at RT.\nAdd 90 µl fluorochrome-conjugated antibody master mix prepared in staining buffer: biotinylated Lineage cocktail (B220, CD3e, CD11b, GR1, Ter119), Sca1, CD117, CD135, CD150. Incubate on ice for 30 min, protected from light.\n\tNote: Appropriate dilutions should be determined for each lot of antibody. See Table of Materials for dilutions used in this study.\nAdd 2 ml staining buffer to the cells, vortex and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbound antibody. Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet by flicking.\nAdd 10 µl fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin diluted in staining buffer (see Materials Table). Incubate on ice for 20 min, protected from light. Wash as in step 3.3 to remove unbound streptavidin.\nAcquire the cell samples using a flow cytometer with at least six detectors9. Determine the frequency of Lin- Sca1+ CD117+ CD135- CD150+ cells (estimated HSCs) in each sample using the analysis template shown in Figure 2 and as previously reported10,11.\n\tNote: The frequency of functional HSCs within that population can be estimated between 1/3 and 1/52,12.\nEstablish estimated HSC equivalents for all samples11, using one sample (typically, the competitor, B6.SJL CD45.1+ in this example) as baseline as detailed below and in Figure 2.\n\t\nCalculate the numbers of cells required using the following formulas:",
    "#transplanted HSCs / recipient = 5 x 105 cells x estimated HSC frequency (as determined for baseline sample; this number is usually between 75 and 125 for wildtype C57Bl/6 mice)10-12.\n\t\tNote: In Figure 2, for Sample A, the result is 139 HSCs.\n\t\ttotal # transplanted cells (for other samples; e.g. Sample B in Figure 2) = # transplanted HSCs/HSC frequency.\n\t\tNote: In Figure 2, for Sample B, the result is 197,826 (or approximately 2 x 105) total bone marrow cells.\nCalculate the total numbers of cells required per graft recipient for each sample using the results obtained above.\n\tNote: This number should be 5 x 105 for the baseline sample (competitor).\n\t\nMultiply the number obtained from step 3.7 by the number of recipient mice and add enough cells for at least two additional mice to compensate for the dead volume in the syringe.\nMix competitor (e.g., CD45.1+) and test cells (CD45.2+) in 1:1 HSC equivalent ratio as calculated in step 3.6 and adjust the final volume for 200 µl per injection using sterile PBS.\n\tNote: For a group of five recipient mice the suggested volume would thus be at least 1.4 ml, containing 3.5 x 106 competitor bone marrow cells (or 973 estimated HSCs for Sample A in Figure 2), and the equivalent number of test cells (in Figure 2, the equivalent for Sample B would be 197,826 x 7 = 1,384,782 bone marrow cells).\n4. Bone Marrow Transplants\nWarm up the recipient mice irradiated in step 1.2 with a red heat lamp to ensure dilation of the blood vessels and to make the lateral tail veins more visible.",
    "Prepare a 1 ml tuberculin syringe equipped with a 27 G needle (or smaller). Aspirate approximately 750 µl of the prepared cell suspension (for 3 recipient mice). Make sure there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nInsert the mouse into a restraining device. Examine the tail and look for the lateral tail veins that should be clearly visible on both sides of the tail. Wipe the injection site with ethanol. Insert the needle bevel up, parallel to the skin and gently press the plunger. Injection should be easy. If force is required, the needle is not in the vein.\n\tNote: Older mice have thicker skin, which may make finding the vein more difficult. If the needle is not in the vein, reinsert the needle proximal to the initial injection site.\nRemove the needle and press the injection site with sterile gauze for a few seconds to stop bleeding. Transfer the mouse into a clean cage.\n\tNote: Use the same syringe and needle for three injections, after which the needle may become too dull.\nFor post-transplant follow-up, inject 1 ml sterile PBS subcutaneously to rehydrate the mice for the first five days. Add antibiotics in drinking water to prevent infections (if required; optional). Weigh mice every two to three days for the first three weeks and euthanize mice that have lost more than 15-20% their pre-transplant body weight (or as determined by the local animal ethics committee).\n5. Analysis of Peripheral Blood\nCollect a drop of blood (approx. 50-100 µl) into EDTA tubes.",
    "To collect blood from the mandibular vein, use a lancet or a 22 G needle to pierce the facial skin near the hairless spot located under the jawbone and place the collecting tube to receive the drop of blood13. Collect blood at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after transplant to follow multi-lineage reconstitution.\nAdd 1 ml freshly prepared RT red blood cell lysis buffer (9 parts 0.16 M NH4Cl + 1 part 0.17 M Tris-HCl pH 7.65) to the drop of blood collected in step 5.1.1. Mix and transfer sample to a 5 ml round-bottom polystyrene tube suitable for flow cytometry. Let stand for 4 min at RT.\nAdd 4 volumes of ice-cold PBS. Mix by turning end-to-end and transfer immediately on ice. Centrifuge 10 min at 200 x g at 4 °C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pellet by flicking. Supernatant should be clear and red. Add 2 ml staining buffer and vortex briefly. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 x g at 4 °C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pellet by flicking.\nProceed with flow cytometry staining using the general protocol detailed in steps 3.1 to 3.3 and the following antibodies for the master mix: CD45.1, CD45.2, CD3e, CD19, GR1.\nAcquire the cell samples using a flow cytometer with at least six detectors9. Determine the frequency of donor-derived cells for each lineage (CD19+ B lymphocytes, CD3e+ T lymphocytes, GR1bright granulocytes) in each sample using the analysis template provided in Figure 3 and as published10,11.\n6. Analysis of Bone Marrow Reconstitution",
    "Collect bone marrow cells as detailed in section 2. Stain the cells for flow cytometry analysis using the general protocol detailed in steps 3.1 to 3.3 and the following antibodies for the master mix: Lineage cocktail, Sca1, CD117, CD135, CD150, CD45.1, CD45.2. Detect lineage cocktail antibodies using fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin as described in step 3.4.\nAcquire cell samples using a flow cytometer with at least eight detectors9. If only six are available, add CD135 to the same channel as lineage panel as CD135+ cells will be excluded. Determine the frequency of donor-derived Lin- Sca1+ CD117+ CD135- CD150+ HSCs in each sample using the analysis template provided in Figure 4 and as published10.\nSubscription Required.
