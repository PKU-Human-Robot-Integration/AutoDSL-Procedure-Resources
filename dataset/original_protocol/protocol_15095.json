  "procedures": [
    "1. Tea callus culture\nNOTE: Sterile leaves were derived from in vitro-grown plantlet lines first developed in the research group17. All procedures up to section 5 were carried out in a sterile laminar flow hood, except for the culture time in an incubator.\nAdjust the pH of the two media (Murashige and Skoog [MS] basal medium and Gamborg's B5 liquid medium) to 5.8 prior to autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min).\nCut along the middle vein of a sterile leaf using scissors, and then subdivide each half into small pieces of about 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm in a petri dish.\nPlace the sterile explants (the small leaf pieces) onto MS basal media containing the plant hormones 2,4-D (1.0 mg L-1) and KT (0.1 mg L-1). Six explants can be placed in a 300 mL flask containing 100 mL of MS basal media.\n Culture the above leaf explants at a constant temperature of 25 °C in the dark. After 28 days, select the first generation of induced callus and transfer to fresh flask (a subculture). Acquire the loose and friable callus after 3−4 subcultures.\n2. Tea cell suspension culture\nCut the vigorous, friable and loose calluses from the solid medium into small pieces (range here 0.5−2 mm) using a sterile surgical blade under sterile conditions.\nWeigh about 3 g of the small pieces of callus. Place the callus into a 150 mL flask containing 20 mL of B5 liquid media supplemented with 2,4-D (1.0 mg L-1) and KT (0.1 mg L-1).\nCulture the liquid cell suspension at a constant temperature (25 ± 1 °C) in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm in the dark.\nAfter 7 to 10 days of culturing, remove the culture flasks and let them stand for a few minutes.",
    "Take all the supernatant as seed material for subculture to fresh medium (subculture ratio of suspension mother liquid to fresh medium ranged between 1:1 and 1:2). Remove the precipitated, large calluses.\nObtain the final well-grown cell suspension culture after 3−4 subculture cycles of 28 days each.\n3. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride assay of cell viability\nKill a sample of living cells at 100 °C for 10 min as a control cell before viability staining.\nCentrifuge all cell suspension culture for 8 min at 6000 x g. Remove the supernatant before suspending the cells in 2.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.3), and shake it for 1 min by hand.\nAdd 2.5 mL of the 0.4%triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution and shake by hand again.\nIncubate the mixture for 1 h in a standing incubator (30 °C).\n4. Treatment and sampling of tea cell suspension cultures with insecticides\nAdd an aliquot of 400 µL of filter-sterilized stock solution (500 µg mL-1) of four neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and imidaclothiz) or two organophosphates (dimethoate and omethoate) into the cell suspension cultures, respectively.\n\tNOTE: If the aim is to compare xenobiotic behaviors, use the same mother batch of cell suspensions to test the different compounds.\nCulture the samples of cell suspensions with insecticides at constant temperature (25 ± 1 °C) and shaking incubator speed (120 rpm). Take the samples (see step 4.3 or 4.4) on 0, 3, 5 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 days.\nTo test a sample containing a neonicotinoid, remove a 1 mL aliquot of the homogeneous cell culture, place it into a 1.5 mL plastic centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 4000 x g for 2 min.",
    "Pass the supernatants through a 0.22-µm pore-size filter membrane before analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (UPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometry (Table of Materials).\nTo test a sample containing an organophosphate, remove a 500 µL aliquot of the cell culture and place into a 35 mL centrifuge tube or a 1.5 mL plastic centrifuge tube (prepare the latter sample like that of neonicotinoid).\n\t\nAdd 0.1 g of sodium chloride and 5 mL of acetone/ethyl acetate (3:7, v/v) into the 35 mL centrifuge tube of the 500 µL samples.\nVortex the mixtures for 1 min, and then allow them to rest for 10 min.\nTake 2.5 mL of the supernatant into a 10 mL glass tube and evaporate to near-dryness using a nitrogen evaporator at 40 °C.\nDissolve the residue with 1 mL acetone, vortex for 1 min, pass it through a 0.22-µm filter membrane before analysis by gas chromatography-flame photometric detector (GC-FPD).\n5. Sample preparation of intact tea plant with insecticides\nNOTE: The intact tea plant trial was conducted in a hydroponic system using tea seedlings grown in 50 mL of a nutrient solution (30 NH4+, 10 NO3-, 3.1 PO4-, 40 K+, 20 Ca2+, 25 Mg2+, 0.35 Fe2+, 0.1 B3+, 1.0 Mn2+, 0.1 Zn2+, 0.025 Cu2+, 0.05 Mo+, and 10 Al3+, in mg L-1)18. An experimental greenhouse was under a light-dark cycle (12 h of light and 12 h of darkness) at 20 °C at Anhui Agricultural University.\nPut five plants in a 4 L plastic pot for 15 days.\nAdd 0 ppm (control) or 100 ppm of thiamethoxam or dimethoate into plastic pots, respectively.\nPrepare the intact plant sample according to the previous method, except for presoaking19, and then analyze with mass spectrometry for an accurate mass spectrum.\n6.
