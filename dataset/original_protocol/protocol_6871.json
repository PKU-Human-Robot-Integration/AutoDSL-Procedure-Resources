CUT&Tag-direct is performed in situ in single PCR tubes with Concanavalin A (ConA) bead-bound nuclei that remain intact throughout the protocol during successive liquid changes, incubations and washes, 12 cycles of PCR amplification, and one SPRI bead cleanup. CUTAC is performed identically except that low-salt conditions are used for tagmentation. H3K4me2 CUTAC maps accessible sites near H3K4me2/3-marked (starred) nucleosome tails, which are methylated by the conserved Set1 lysine methyltransferase. The complex that includes Set1 associates with the initiation form of RNAPII, which is heavily phosphorylated on Serine-5 of the heptameric C-terminal domain repeat units on the largest RNAPII subunit (RNAPIIS5P). For RNAPIIS5P CUTAC, pA-Tn5 is anchored directly to RNAPIIS5 phosphates (starred). Whereas CUT&Tag is suitable for any chromatin epitope, CUTAC is specific for H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and RNAPIIS5P. The only other difference between the protocols is that tagmentation is performed in the presence of 300 mM NaCl for CUT&Tag and in a low ionic strength buffer for CUTAC.Prepare and (optionally) lightly fix nuclei and cryopreserve (1 h in the lab)Harvest fresh culture(s) in a conical centrifuge tube (15 ml or 50 ml) at room temperature and count cells.Centrifuge for 3 min at 600 × g in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature and drain the liquid.Resuspend in 1 volume of PBS (relative to starting culture) at room temperature by pipetting up and down.Centrifuge for 3 min at 600 × g in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature and drain the liquid.Resuspend in 1/2 volume (relative to starting culture) of ice-cold NE1 buffer with gentle vortexing. Let sit on ice for 10 min.",
    "Centrifuge for 4 min at 1,300 × g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor and drain liquid by pouring off and inverting onto a paper towel for a few seconds.Resuspend in 1/2 volume of PBS. For unfixed nuclei, skip to Step A11.While gently vortexing, add 16% formaldehyde to 0.1% (e.g., 62 μl to 10 ml) and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Note: Light fixation reduces the tendency of cells or nuclei to clump in the 300-wash buffer but can interfere with the binding of some antibodies, reducing yield. Stop cross-linking by adding 1.25 M glycine to twice the molar concentration of formaldehyde (e.g., 600 μl to 10 ml).Centrifuge for 4 min at 1,300 × g at 4°C and drain the liquid by pouring off and inverting onto a paper towel for a few seconds.Resuspend in Wash buffer to a concentration of ~1 million cells per ml. Check nuclei using ViCell or a cell counter slide.Nuclei may be slowly frozen by aliquoting 900 μl into cryogenic vials containing 100 μl of DMSO, mixed well, then placed in a Mr. Frosty container filled to the line with isopropanol and placed in a -80°C freezer overnight and stored at -80°C long term.Note: We have found that good results are obtained using native or cross-linked cells even after being stored in the freezer compartment of a side-by-side refrigerator for >6 months. Prepare Concanavalin A-coated beads (15 min)Resuspend and withdraw enough of the ConA bead slurry, ensuring that there will be 3.5 μl for each final sample of up to ~50,000 mammalian cells, which yield ≥50% K562 nuclei using this protocol. Transfer the ConA bead slurry into 1 ml of Binding buffer in a 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Note: This protocol has been used for up to 16 samples (60 µl beads) in 1 ml or 32 samples (120 µl beads) in 2 ml Binding buffer (in a 2 ml tube). Mix by pipetting. Place the tube on a magnet stand to clear (~1 min).Withdraw the supernatant completely and remove the tube from the magnet stand. Add 1 ml Binding buffer and mix by pipetting up and down.Place on the magnet stand to clear, remove and discard the supernatant, and resuspend in 60 µl Binding buffer (3.5 μl per sample).Bind nuclei to ConA beads (15 min)Thaw a frozen aliquot of nuclei at room temperature, for example, by placing in a 20 ml beaker of water.Note: The CUTAC control can use either native or lightly cross-linked nuclei, preferably prepared as previously described (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020). Do not use whole cells, which require a detergent and may also inhibit the PCR. Transfer the thawed nuclei suspension in aliquots of no more than ~50,000 starting mammalian cells to each thin-wall 0.5 ml PCR tube and mix with 3.5 µl ConA beads. Attach to the Tube rotator and rotate at room temperature for 10 min.Note: Nuclei prepared according to the recommended protocol (Kaya-Okur et al., 2020) have been resuspended in Wash buffer. Beads can be added directly to the aliquot for binding and then transferred to PCR tubes, ensuring that no more than 5 µl of the original ConA bead suspension is present in each PCR tube for single-tube CUT&Tag. Using more than ~50,000 mammalian nuclei or >5 µl Con A beads per sample may inhibit the PCR. Place the tubes on the magnet stand to clear and remove and discard the supernatant.",
    "Note: In low-retention PCR tubes, surface tension will cause bead-bound cells to slide down to the bottom of the tube at this step. To avoid beads being aspirated with the supernatant, set the pipette to a volume that is 5 µl less than the total volume to be removed. Use a careful second draw with a 20 µl pipette tip and remove as much supernatant as possible without aspirating beads. Bind primary antibody (1 h)For each CUT&Tag and CUTAC sample, mix the primary antibody 1:50-1:100 with Antibody buffer. Resuspend beads in 25 µl per sample with gentle vortexing.Note: We use 1:50-1:100 antibody dilutions by default or the manufacturer’s recommended concentration for immunofluorescence. CUTAC works best using either an RNA Polymerase II CTD-phosphorylated antibody (Ser5P > Ser2P/Ser5P > Ser2P) or an α-H3K4me2 antibody. α-H3K4me3 also works but is less efficient and is depleted at enhancer sites. Several antibodies to other histone epitopes have been tested, including α-H3K4me1, α-H3K36me3, α-H3K27ac, and α-H2A.Z, but all have failed. Place on a rotator at room temperature and incubate 1-2 h.Notes: Volumes up to 50 µl will remain in the tube bottom by surface tension during rotation, avoiding the need for a quick spin before the next step. After incubation, the tubes can be stored overnight at 4°C. An optional negative control is performed by omitting the primary antibody. Bind secondary antibody (1 h)Place tubes on the magnet stand to clear and remove and discard the supernatant.Note: Protein in the antibody solution improves bead adherence to the tube wall, allowing for complete removal of the liquid without dislodging the beads by doing two successive draws with a 20 µl pipettor set for maximum volume while being careful not to dislodge the beads by surface tension during the second draw.",
    "Mix the secondary antibody 1:100 in Wash buffer and add 25 µl per sample while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge the beads from the sides.Notes: Calculate how much volume of diluted Antibody is necessary by multiplying the number of samples by 30 µl (which is 25 µl per sample plus overage for pipetting). The secondary antibody step is required for CUT&Tag to increase the number of Protein A binding sites for each bound antibody. We have found that without the secondary antibody, the efficiency is very low. Place the tubes on a rotator and rotate at room temperature for 0.5-1 h.After a quick spin (< 500 × g or just enough to remove the liquid from the sides of the tube), place the tubes on the magnet stand to clear and remove and discard the supernatant with two successive draws, using a 20 µl tip with the pipettor set for maximum volume.With the tubes still on the magnet stand, carefully add 500 µl of Wash buffer. The surface tension will cause the beads to slide up along the side of the tube closest to the magnet.Slowly remove 470 µl of supernatant with a 1 ml pipette tip without disturbing the beads.Note: To remove the supernatant, set the pipettor to 470 µl, and keep the plunger depressed while lowering the tip to the bottom. The liquid level will rise to near the top, completing the wash. Then ease off on the plunger until the liquid is withdrawn and remove the pipettor. During liquid removal, the surface tension will drag the beads down the tube. A small drop of liquid that is left behind will be removed in the next step.",
    "After a quick spin (<500 × g or just enough to remove the liquid from the sides of the tube), place the tubes back into the magnet stand and remove the remaining supernatant with a 20 µl pipettor, multiple times if necessary, to remove the entire supernatant without disturbing the beads. Proceed immediately to the next step.Bind pA-Tn5 adapter complex (1.5 h)Mix pAG-Tn5 pre-loaded adapter complex in 300-wash buffer following the manufacturer's instructions.Pipette in 25 µl per sample of the pA-Tn5 mix while vortexing and invert by rotation to ensure that beads adhering to the sides near the top of the top are resuspended.Note: When using the recommended Macsimag magnet stand, dislodging the beads after resuspending in pA-Tn5 can be done by removing the plexiglass tube holder from the magnet and, with fingers on top to prevent the tubes from opening or falling out, inverting by rotating sharply a few times. After a quick spin (<500 × g), place the tubes on a rotator at room temperature for 1-2 h.After incubating in the rotator, perform a quick spin and place the tubes in the magnet stand.Carefully remove the supernatant using a 20 µl pipettor twice to avoid disturbing the beads.With the tubes still on the magnet stand, add 500 µl of the 300-wash buffer.Slowly withdraw 470 µl with a 1 ml pipette tip without disturbing the beads as in Step D6.After a quick spin, place the tubes back on the magnet stand and remove and discard the supernatant with a 20 µl pipettor using multiple draws. Proceed immediately to the next step.Tagmentation and particle release (2.",
    "5 h) (Figure 2)Tagmentation:CUT&Tag samples only: Resuspend the bead/nuclei pellet in 50 µl CUT&Tag Tagmentation buffer (10 mM mM MgCl2 in 300-wash buffer) while vortexing or inverting by rotation to allow the solution to dislodge most or all the beads as in Step E2.CUTAC samples only: Resuspend the bead/nuclei pellet in 50 µl of either CUTAC-tag or CUTAC-hex Tagmentation buffer while vortexing or inverting by rotation to allow the solution to dislodge most or all the beads as in Step D6.Note: 10% 1,6-hexanediol or N,N-dimethylformamide compete for hydrophobic interactions and result in improved tethered Tn5 accessibility and library yield at the expense of slightly increased background. After a quick spin (<500 × g), incubate at 37°C for 1 h (20 min for CUTAC) in a PCR cycler with a heated lid. Hold at 8°C.Place tubes on the magnet stand and remove and discard the supernatant with a 20 µl pipettor using multiple draws, then resuspend the beads in 50 µl TAPS wash buffer and invert by rotation as in Step D6.After a quick spin, place tubes on the magnet stand and remove and discard the supernatant with a 20 µl pipettor using multiple draws.Resuspend the beads in 5 µl 0.1% SDS Release solution using a fresh 20 µl pipette tip to dispense while wetting the sides of the tubes to recover the fraction of beads sticking to the sides.Note: Rolling the tube back and forth rapidly between thumb and forefinger while brushing the pipette tip along the sides of the tube will effectively wet the beads; follow by a quick spin to bring most of the beads to the bottom. After a quick spin (<500 × g), incubate at 58°C for 1 h in a PCR cycler with a heated lid to release pA-Tn5 from the tagmented DNA.",
    "PCR (1 h)To the PCR tube containing the bead slurry, add 15 µl of Triton neutralization solution + 2 µl of 10 µM Universal or barcoded i5 primer + 2 µl of 10 µM uniquely barcoded i7 primers, using a different barcode for each sample. Vortex on full speed and place tubes in the metal tube holder on ice.Note: Indexed primers are described by Buenrostro et al. (2015). We do not recommend Nextera or NEB primers which might not anneal efficiently using this PCR protocol. Add 25 µl NEBnext (non-hot start), vortex to mix, and perform a quick spin. Place the tubes immediately in the thermocycler and proceed immediately with the PCR.Begin the cycling program with a heated lid on the thermocycler:Cycle 1: 58°C for 5 min (gap filling)Cycle 2: 72°C for 5 min (gap filling)Cycle 3: 98°C for 30 sCycle 4: 98°C for 10 sCycle 5: 60°C for 10 sRepeat Cycles 4-5 11 times72°C for 1 min and hold at 8°CNotes: To minimize the contribution of large DNA fragments and excess primers, the PCR should be performed for no more than 12-14 cycles, preferably with a 10 s 60-63°C combined annealing/extension step as described above in Step H3e. The cycle times are based on using a conventional Peltier cycler (e.g., Bio-Rad/MJ PTC200), in which the ramping times (3°C/s) are sufficient for annealing to occur as the sample cools from 98°C to 60°C. Therefore, the use of a rapid cycler with a higher ramping rate will require either reducing the ramping time or other adjustments to assure annealing. Do not add extra PCR cycles to see a signal by capillary gel electrophoresis (e.g., Tapestation).",
    "If there is no nucleosomal ladder for the H3K27me3 positive control, you may assume that CUT&Tag failed, but observing no signal for a sparse chromatin protein such as a transcription factor is normal, and the barcoded sample can be concentrated for mixing with the pool of barcoded samples for sequencing. Extra PCR cycles reduce the complexity of the library and may result in an unacceptably high level of PCR duplicates. Cycle 3 (98 °C) may be extended from 30 sec to 5 min for cross-linked samples to ensure complete cross-link reversal. Post-PCR cleanup (30 min)After the PCR program ends, remove tubes from the thermocycler and add 65 μl of SPRI beads (ratio of 1.3 μl of SPRI beads to 1 μl of PCR product). Mix by pipetting up and down.Let sit at room temperature 5-10 min.Place on the magnetic stand for a few minutes to allow the solution to clear.Remove and discard the supernatant.Keeping the tubes in the magnetic stand, add 200 μl of 80% ethanol.Completely remove and discard the supernatant.Repeat Steps I5-I6.Perform a quick spin and remove the remaining supernatant with a 20 μl pipette, avoiding air drying the beads by proceeding immediately to the next step.Remove from the magnet stand, add 22 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and vortex at full speed. Let sit for 5 min to1 h.Place on the magnet stand and allow to clear.Remove the liquid to a new 1.5 ml tube with a pipette, avoiding transfer of beads.Tapestation analysis (Figure 3) and DNA sequencingDetermine the size distribution and concentration of libraries by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 reagents or equivalent.Note: We use the quantification by Tapestation to estimate library concentration and dilute each library to 2 nM before pooling based on fragment molarity in the 175-1,000 bp range.",
    "The concentration 2 nM has been determined empirically as the optimal library concentration used in the HiSeq by the Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource. Mix barcoded libraries to achieve equal representation as desired, aiming for a final concentration as recommended by the manufacturer. After mixing, perform an SPRI bead cleanup if needed to remove any residual PCR primers.Perform paired-end Illumina sequencing on the barcoded libraries following the manufacturer’s instructions. For maximum economy, paired-end PE25 is more than sufficient for mapping to large genomes.Note: Using paired-end 25 × 25 sequencing on a HiSeq 2-lane rapid run flow cell, we obtain ~300 million total mapped reads, or ~3 million per sample when there are 96 samples mixed to obtain approximately equal molarity. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4043/bioprotoc-11-11-4043-g003.jpgFigure 3.
