    "TIRF AssemblyThe TIRF microscope that we describe is built on a Mad City Labs RM21 body. This microscope frame is convenient as it allows for easy access to the optical components within the frame, facilitating alignment. The RM21 frame is particularly stable, and the rectangular geometry permits simple addition of support brackets.The first step is to place the microscope body on the optical table. Figure 1 is a top-down view of a CAD design showing the location of the microscope frame in relation to the rest of the optical components. We suggest placing the body close to the center of the optical table. This then enables enclosing of the microscope in the final stages.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g001.jpgFigure 1. CAD design showing a top-down view of the optical assembly. A. Without the microscope frame. B. With the microscope frame.Next, lasers are placed onto a heat sink at the appropriate height. Currently, we use Vortran lasers (detailed in the components section) that can be purchased with clean-up filters to minimize extra components. Compact and simple designs have been previously described, for example by Nicovich et al. (2017). Links in the paper provide good guidelines on assembling the lasers (including designs) and useful resources including triggering and timing. Figure 2 below shows a close-up of the design that we implemented. Three lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, and 640 nm) are placed onto a heat sink, filtered using laser filters, and combined into a single line using dichroics. In practice, more lasers can be combined if necessary (e.g., 561 nm) by expanding the design. The lasers are then aligned into a fiber. Once installed, we expect ~70% coupling efficiency.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g002.jpgFigure 2. Laser assembly and fiber coupling.",
    "Three lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, and 640 nm) are placed onto a heat sink, combined using dichroics, and coupled to a laser fiber.Place the output of the optical fiber at the intended height of the expansion optics. Ensure that the laser output is straight and travels parallel to the table without deviating.Set up the laser expansion cage assembly (cage rods, ×2 right-angle mirror mounts, and ×3 cage XY translation mounts) attached to a custom RM21 bracket frame (https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design[href=https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design]) and place at the required height. We recommend using steel pedestals to ensure greater stability. Figure 3 illustrates the assembly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g003.jpgFigure 3. Assembly of the laser expansion Align the laser so that it is centered throughout the cage assembly.Place the lenses to provide ~10-fold expansion of the laser (e.g., 30 mm and 300 mm). Ensure that these are placed at the correct distance from each other using a Shearing Interferometer.Assemble the mirror and tube lens (200 mm focal length) on top of the translation stage. The translation stage moves the lens and mirror assembly together. Ensure that the reflected beam is straight and parallel to the optical table. Place the mirror/lens centered within the frame of the microscope.Take the dichroic holders (×2) and attach to each other. Place below the position of the imaging objective at the height of the laser.Attach the dichroics, via cage rods, to the microscope frame using the RM21 bracket (https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design[href=https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design]) (Figure 4, left hand side and Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "One dichroic is used to reflect the laser toward the sample/objective; the second dichroic is used to separate the infrared light for active stabilization. For more details on how to assemble and configure, please refer to Coelho et al. (2020b).Align the laser so that it is centered onto the back of the imaging objective. A simple method consists of replacing the objective for a Frosted Glass Alignment Disk and observing the position of the laser.To ensure that the tube lens is at the correct distance from the back of the objective, the laser output should be as small as possible after exiting the objective. While observing the laser profile at a large distance (e.g., ceiling), adjust the position of the tube lens to ensure that a Gaussian beam with minimal diameter exits the objective. Misalignments can lead to a distorted beam profile (e.g., astigmatic).Assemble the Infrared Camera/LED PathAssemble the cage system (cage rods, right angle mirror mount, and 200 mm infrared lens) and attach it to the dichroic cube (Figure 6).Secure to the microscope frame using an RM21 bracket (https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design[href=https://github.com/spcoelho/Active-Stabilization-Design]).Attach the infrared camera using an SM1 adapter and connect to a PC.Assemble the infrared LED, place on the XYZ translation stage, and align onto the infrared camera [for more details, see Coelho et al. (2020b)].Turn on the infrared LED and check that the illumination is centered and uniform on the infrared camera.Place polystyrene beads on the glass coverslip and record their diffraction rings.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g006.jpgFigure 6.

B. 45° view.Detection (Emission camera and camera stabilization path)This section describes how to introduce an optical feedback loop for the emission path (Figure 7).",
    "This allows to correct for movement in the detection path, facilitating high stability for prolonged acquisitions.Emission CameraTo direct the fluorescence from the sample toward the camera, attach a right-angle mirror mount to tubing and connect it to the bottom of the laser dichroic holder (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g007.jpgFigure 7. Assembly of the fluorescence emission path. A. Left: Without the white LED. Right: With the white LED. B. Left: Only the camera stabilization path. Right: Detection assembly in relation to the infrared detection.Adjust the length of the tube to match the predicted height of the fluorescent camera.Within the tube, insert the emission filter (Em01-R405/488/635-25; Semrock). This removes the laser light and/or infrared LED.Attach the tube lens (e.g., 400 mm focal length).For the white LED: Attach the cage cube to the free side of the right-angle mirror mount.Note: If extra distance between the camera and the tube lens is required, add a pair of relay lenses (e.g., 2 × 50 mm). Secure the assembly to the RM21 microscope frame using cage rods and/or SM1 tubing.Attach the camera to an optical table at the correct distance away from the lens.Place a mirror (or piezo-electric mirror) in front of the camera.Adjust the focal length of the tube lens. A simple way to get the correct distance is to flip the laser dichroic so that it reflects toward the camera. Using a very low laser power and multiple neutral density filters, focus the laser onto the camera. To get the correct distance, also remove the laser filter and last lens in the laser excitation path (TIRF lens mounted on the translation stage).Place a uniform fluorescent sample (fluorescent molecules in solution or fluorescent marker) and check the emission onto the camera.Center the emission onto the camera using the elliptical mirror underneath the objective lens.",
    "The emission should be uniform across the recorded field-of-view.Camera StabilizationAttach the white LED to the microscope frame (Figures 4 and 7B left).Assemble the cage/tube system containing a pinhole (diameter = 50 µm) and lens (e.g., f = 400 mm).Center the pinhole and adjust the position of the lens to ensure a bright Gaussian spot focused on the camera.Position the white LED spot on the edge of the imaging field-of-view (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4074/bioprotoc-11-13-4074-g008.jpgFigure 8.
