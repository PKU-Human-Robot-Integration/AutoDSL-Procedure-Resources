Work flow of 19F-TET labeling of A2AAR in P. pastoris membranes and Cy3 fluorophore labeling of A2AAR in nanodiscs\n(A) Individual steps for in-membrane chemical modification of A2AAR with 19F-trifluoroethanethiol (TET) for NMR experiments. Individual steps for incorporation of 19F-TET are indicated with roman numerals and occur between steps ‘3’ and ‘4’ in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. Note that steps I-VI would be skipped for preparation of fluorescently-labeled A2AAR for SMF experiments.\n(B) Individual steps for incorporation of a Cy3 cysteine-reactive fluorophore for single-molecule fluorescence experiments.\nFigure created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: The following steps are done after step 33 in the “purification of A2AAR for nanodisc assembly[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” sub-section in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section. For producing samples for single-molecule fluorescence, skip the following steps and proceed to the section nanodisc assembly and Cy3 labeling for single-molecule fluorescence[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\nTreat membranes with Aldrithiol: Resuspend the membranes in a glass tissue homogenizer with 100 mL A2AAR High Salt Buffer containing 4 mM theophylline. Completely resuspend the membranes using 30 or more strokes, resulting in a homogeneous solution. Add 1 mM aldrithiol (22 mg/liter of cell culture, MW:220.31) and 100 μL of in-house Protease Inhibitor to the resuspended membranes. Resuspend the reagents in the membrane mixture, distribute among 50 mL conical tubes and rotate at 4°C for 1 h.",
    "Treat membranes with trifluoroethanethiol (TET): Pellet the resuspended membranes in an ultracentrifuge at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the membrane pellet in 100 mL A2AAR High salt buffer. Add TET to a final concentration of 1 mM/ liter of cell culture. Incubate the sample at 4°C for 1 h. Pellet the membranes in an ultracentrifuge at 200,000 × g for 30 min and discard the supernatant.\nNote: TET is toxic. Application of TET and resuspension of TET-containing membrane mixtures must be done in a chemical hood and with appropriate personal protective equipment.\nNote: Deactivate solutions containing TET with 20% bleach and thoroughly wash all apparatus from this step using standard lab detergents and water as soon as you have finished using them.\nContinue to steps 46–53 described in the section “purification of A2AAR for nanodisc assembly[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3].”\nNanodisc assembly and Cy3 labeling for single-molecule fluorescence\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the stepwise process to assemble nanodiscs containing A2AAR and labeling the receptor with the Cy3 dye for single molecule fluorescence experiments.\nPrepare lipids: Prepare 100 mM stocks of lipids in Nanodisc Cholate Buffer.\nNote: It is critical that the lipids completely dissolve before proceeding. Some lipids require gentle heating and shaking to completely dissolve. Heat solutions to 40°C–50ºC for up to 1 h with gentle shaking to ensure complete dissolution. For more information about the phase transition temperature for lipids refer Avanti website (https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/physical-properties/phase-transition-temps[href=https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/physical-properties/phase-transition-temps]).\nPrepare for nanodisc assembly: Calculate amounts of receptor, lipids and MSP1D1 required to form nanodiscs based on the reported optimized molar ratio of 1:5:250 (receptor:MSP1D1:lipids). An example calculation is provided below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1821_34.csv",
    "Note: The optimal ratio depends on the size of the membrane protein, particular MSP construct and lipids and may be different for other membrane proteins or other MSPs.\nInitiate nanodisc assembly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]): Add all the components to a microcentrifuge tube in the following order: Nanodisc Buffer, Nanodisc Cholate Buffer, lipids, MSPD1 and A2AAR. Incubate the assembly mixture for 1–2 h with gentle rotation at 4°C.\nNote: The incubation temperature should be near the phase-transition temperature of the lipids. For mixtures of lipids, incubate the solution near the phase transition temperature of the largest molar fraction of lipids in the sample.\nRemove detergent: Add 0.5–1 g Bio-Beads/mL of nanodisc assembly mixture. Incubate the sample for 12–14 h at 4°C with gentle rocking or rotation.\nRemove the Bio-Beads: Use a syringe with a 20-gauge needle to collect the soluble fraction and apply to a fresh tube. Wash the Bio-Beads once with an equal volume of Nanodiscs Buffer and combine with the first collected aliquot.\nPrepare Ni-NTA by washing it with 5 CVs of ddH2O. Add the Ni-NTA resin to the pooled sample and incubate it at 4°C for 12–14 h. For every 1 mL of assembled nanodisc solution add 250 μL Ni-NTA resin.\nNote: For single-molecule fluorescence, the following steps must be performed in dark conditions as exposure of light will bleach the fluorophore. For NMR sample preparation, skip to step 11. NMR samples are not sensitive to light.\nAdd the fluorophore (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B): Add the Cy3 fluorescent dye at a 10× fold molar excess of receptor to the sample. Incubate at 4°C for 2–3 h with rotation.",
    "Remove empty nanodiscs: Transfer the resin to a gravity flow column. Wash the resin with 3 CVs of Nanodisc Wash Buffer. Elute the nanodiscs containing A2AAR using Nanodiscs Elution Buffer in 10 different 0.5 CV fractions. Measure the protein absorbance in each aliquot and pool the 3–4 aliquots with the highest protein concentration.\nExchange the sample into the final buffer: Using a PD-10 column, follow the manufacturer’s protocol to exchange the sample into the Nanodiscs Desalting Buffer. https://cytiva-delivery.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/digi-11531-pdf[href=https://cytiva-delivery.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/digi-11531-pdf].\nCharacterize the sample: Use Nanofilm SEC-250, 5 μm, 250 Å, 7.8 × 300 mm (Sepax Technologies) analytical size exclusion chromatography to check the monodispersity and homogeneity of samples (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) from step 12.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1821-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. SDS-PAGE and SEC characterization of lipid nanodiscs containing A2AAR\n(A) Representative SDS-PAGE gel of assembled nanodisc components and isolated nanodiscs containing A2AAR. Lanes labeled 1, 2, and 3 correspond to samples containing purified MSP1D1, A2AAR in detergent micelles, and isolated nanodiscs containing A2AAR, respectively. The bands corresponding to A2AAR and MSP1D1 are annotated in lane 3. The lane labeled “MWS” corresponds to molecular weight standards. Note that the higher molecular weight band in lanes 2 and 3 (∼63 kDa) is an artificial GPCR dimer created by SDS.\n(B) Representative analytical size exclusion chromatogram of purified nanodiscs containing A2AAR, shows a single peak (blue) consistent with a homogenous preparation. The superimposed chromatogram in orange was obtained with MWS (Bio-Rad).

    "Concentrate the sample: Assuming the sample will be transferred to a Shigemi susceptibility-matched NMR tube, concentrate the NMR sample to a final volume of ∼280 μL. Concentrate the sample by applying 300–400 × g for a duration of 20–25 min in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge at 4°C using a 30,000 MWCO polyethersulfone concentrator (Vivaspin®). Carefully resuspend the sample and repeat until reaching the desired concentration.\nNote: Do not exceed 300–400 × g during this step as this can cause protein aggregation.\nAdd 20 μL 99.8% D2O and gently but thoroughly mix the sample with manual pipetting. The D2O is required for the NMR spectrometer lock and is a standard component of NMR samples.\nTransfer to an NMR tube: Transfer the sample to a Shigemi susceptibility-matched NMR tube using a standard manual 200 μL pipette.\nSetup the spectrometer for 19F detection according to your institution’s approved procedures. Record an NMR spectrum (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) using the standard ‘zg’ one-pulse program provided by Bruker.

Relevant dimensions are indicated.\nFigure created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nPreparing quartz slides\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes steps used to clean slides that will be used for single-molecule fluorescence experiments.\nBoil recycled slides: If recycling slides from previous experiments, boil the quartz slides for 15 min to remove debris from previous experiments. If working with new slides, skip to the next step.\nNote: From our experience, slides can be used at least 4–5 times before needing to replace them.\nSonicate the slides: Place the slides in a slide holder (e.g., prepared in house from Teflon or glass coplin staining jars, Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B). Insert the slides and holder into new beaker, add 20% detergent solution (Contrad 70) and sonicate for 20 min. Discard the detergent solution, rinse with Milli-Q water 3 times, and sonicate for 40 min in Milli-Q water.\nThoroughly clean the slides: Boil slides in a beaker containing Piranha Solution for 15 min, making sure slides are fully immersed in the solution. Discard the solution to a labeled segregated container after use for proper disposal.\nNote: Ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide are irritants. Use all recommended safety precautions, including appropriate personal protective equipment and working in a fume hood.",
    "Rinse and dry the slides: Thoroughly rinse the slides with Milli-Q water to remove any remaining piranha solution. Collect the washes and discard into a labeled segregated container. Dry the slides by carefully applying above a Bunsen burner. Cool the slides in a slide staining rack and place them into the slide holder until needed.\nSurface activation of slides and coverslips\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes steps used to chemically treat the cleaned quartz slides and coverslips to prepare them for subsequent SMF experiments.\nActivate the slides and coverslips: Immerse quartz slides and 50 mm × 24 mm glass coverslips in 1 M potassium hydroxide solution and sonicate for 20 min.\nNote: potassium hydroxide is a strong base and caustic. Take precautions including wearing appropriate personal protective equipment while handling it.\nRinse the slides: Discard the potassium hydroxide solution. Rinse slides well with ddH2O, discard, and then sonicate with fresh ddH2O for 40 min.\nRinse and dry slides: Discard the water and fill jars with methanol. Sonicate for 40 min. Discard the methanol and rinse the slides at least 3 times with ddH2O. Dry the slides and coverslips by flushing with nitrogen gas.\nSlide surface aminosilanization\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the process to silanize the quartz slides, which reduces the adherence of proteins directly to the slide.\nApply Aminosilanization Solution: Carefully prepare 300 mL Aminosilanization Solution (2%–3% APTES) in a clean and dry beaker. Add the solution into a beaker containing the slide holder containing slides and coverslips and incubate at 20°C–23°C for 10 min. Sonicate the slides and coverslips with the solution for 2 min and incubate again for 10 min.\nNote: 3-APTES is highly toxic and carcinogenic. Do this step in a fume hood and use appropriate personal protective equipment.",
    "Rinse and dry the slides: Discard the Aminosilanization Solution into a proper labeled segregated container. Rinse the slides thoroughly with 100% methanol and discard. Then rinse the slides thoroughly with ddH2O and discard. Rinse the slides one final time with methanol and discard.\nDry the slides: Thoroughly dry the slides by applying a stream of nitrogen gas.\nSlide surface PEGylation\nTiming: 30 min preparation + 10–12 h incubation, approximately 12–13 h in total\nThis section details steps for PEGylating the quarts slides.\nPrepare solution: Prepare fresh 100 mM sodium bicarbonate solution and filter with a Millex-GP 0.22-micron filter.\nPrepare PEG solution: Dissolve 80 mg of mPEG-SVA and 5 mg of Biotin-PEG-SVA by gently adding 400 μL sodium bicarbonate buffer and vortexing until the mixture becomes transparent. Centrifuge the solution for one minute at 10,000 × g to remove bubbles. This amount will be enough to PEGylate 5 slides.\nApply PEG solution on the slides: Add 90 μL of PEG solution to each quartz slide. Gently apply a coverslip on the top of the PEG solution on the slide, avoiding the formation of bubbles on the slide.\nIncubate slides in the dark 12–14 h.\nNote: To prevent desiccation-induced adhesion of the quartz slides to the coverslips, the slides need to be incubated in a closed container that maintains a humid environment. We use empty clean pipet tip boxes with water at the bottom.\nCleaning and storage\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes steps for preparing the quartz slides for storing until they are used for SMF experiments.\nOutline the PEG surface with a marker. Then carefully separate the coverslips from slides.",
    "Rinse and store slides: Rinse both slides and coverslips thoroughly with ddH2O, dry them with nitrogen and store in a 50 mL centrifuge tube with flushed nitrogen. Seal the tube with parafilm and stored at −20°C.\nNote: Keep the nitrogen gas pressure lower than 10 pounds per square inch (PSI) while drying the PEG surface.\nNote: The slides should be stable for 3–4 weeks. Additional details regarding slide cleaning and passivation can be found also in earlier work (Lamichhane et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nA2AAR-nanodisc complex immobilization and addition of ligands\nTiming: 15–20 min\nThis section describes the process by which the nanodisc sample is fixed to the quartz slide and ligands are added to the sample (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1821-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Figure created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nWarm up slides: Take out slide from freezer storage and allow it to equilibrate to 20°C–23°C.\nPrepare sample chamber: Use double-sided tape and grease to prepare the sample chamber on a clean, PEGylated quartz surface marked with a marker as in step 33 of “step-by-step method details”.\nAdd streptavidin: Pipette 50 μL of 0.2 mg/mL streptavidin (Thermo Fisher) into the sample chamber through the hole on the quartz slide and incubate for 5 min to let streptavidin bind to the Biotin-PEG on the slide.",
    "Wash the chamber: Wash out unbound streptavidin by pipetting 120 μL of imaging buffer into the sample chamber. The imaging buffer should contain a saturating concentration of ligand, or no ligand for the apo sample.\nAdd the A2AAR-nanodisc complex into the chamber, approximately 120 μL at a concentration of 50 pM. Incubate for 5–10 min to immobilize nanodisc sample contains 5% biotin-PE on the streptavidin coated quartz slide surface. Rinse the chamber with 120 μL Imaging Buffer to remove uncombined sample.\nAdd reagents to increase dye stability: Apply an additional 120 μL imaging buffer containing glucose oxidase and a catalase oxygen scavenging system (OSS) to the chamber to increase the dye’s photostability. The buffer should also contain either a saturating concentration of the same ligand used in step 38 or no ligand. The glucose oxidase and a catalase oxygen scavenging system contains 10% w/v glucose, 50 μg/mL glucose oxidase and 10 μg/mL bovine catalase prepared by adding the reagents to the imaging buffer.\nSingle-molecule data acquisition\nTiming: 40 min\nThis section outlines the steps for handling the sample and recording SMF single color data.\nMount the sample: Place the sample slide on the TIRF stage based attached to inverted IX73 microscope equipped with 60×, 1.20 NA water-immersion objective (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nExcite the sample: Use 532 nM laser to excite the sample via a prism attached to the surface of a slide (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nRecord data: Record emission from Cy3-labeled A2AAR nanodisc complexes on an EMCCD camera with 100 milliseconds integration time. We typically record movies for 100 s to ensure that most molecules are eventually photobleached (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C), which confirms that the observed particle is a single molecule.\nFor each sample slide, record at least 15–20 movies.",
    "Process the data and extract intensity time traces: We use the smFRET package and program “Single”, made available from the lab of Prof. Taekjip Ha, for data acquisition and processing. A link to the software is provided below. Additional instructions for using the software are provided in the download.\nSingle-molecule data analysis\nTiming: a week to few weeks depending on the complexity and quality of the experimental data\nThis section describes the process for quantitatively analyzing the SMF data and generating corresponding histograms and transition density plots used to visualize the data (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1821-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

The histograms are fit with an exponential function to generate the red curve. Igor Pro was used to generate and fit the dwell-time histogram.",
    "Select dynamic molecules: Molecules that exhibit single-step photobleaching are selected using the smFRET data analysis package (link below) modified to analyze single-color data written using MATLAB (provided by the laboratory of Taekjip Ha, also see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Correct the background of each trajectory by the intensity after photobleaching and normalize the fluorescence intensities to the mean intensity of the lowest intensity state. Truncate individual dynamic trajectories before photobleaching. For each condition (ligand or no ligand added), we typically select approximate 200 molecules (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A).\nCreate histograms: Generate binned intensity histograms and fit the histograms into Gaussian distributions. We use Igor Pro to generate and fit histograms with Gaussian distributions (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nCalculate error: record data from at least five to seven independent movies to calculate the error bars on the fluorescence intensity histograms.\nFit the data: Use Hidden Markov model to fit individual normalized trajectories into different conformational states and determine the dwell times spent in each state (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C). The analysis closely follows published protocols from the Ha lab (McKinney et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nGenerate the transition density plots (TDP) to reveal the probabilities of transition events (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]D).\nConstruct the dwell times histograms and fit with exponential decay function to determine rate constants of transitions (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]E). We use the freely available program HaMMy program (link below) to process single-color data to fit trajectories and generate TDP plots."
