    "1. Odor Preparation and Delivery\nDilute odor solutions in mineral oil by volume to achieve the desired concentration level. Store a 20 ml mixture of mineral oil and the odorant in a 60 ml glass bottle. Insert two syringe needles into a rubber stopper (gauge 19), one from the bottom and the other from the top, to provide an inlet and an outlet line. Seal the glass bottle with this rubber stopper and attach a custom designed activated carbon filter to the inlet line (Figure 1A).\nThe carbon filter is made using two 6 ml syringes. Cut the syringes in half and discard the plunger end. Fill each of the remaining pieces with cotton and activated charcoal before connecting them together using heat-shrink tubing.\nConnect the outlet line of the odor bottle (using polyethylene tubing, I.D. 0.86 mm) to the plastic tube (Nalgene FEP Tubing, I.D. 5.8 mm) that supplies a constant airflow across the antenna (Figure 1B).\nDirect carbon-filtered, dehumidified air (carrier gas; flow-rate, 0.75 L/min) towards the locust using a plastic tube placed within a few cm of the locust antenna.\nFor odor stimulation, displace a constant volume (0.1 L/min) of the static headspace above the odor solution in the bottle. This is achieved by injecting an equal amount of dehumidified air into the bottle using a Pico-pump (WPI, PV-820). The vapors from the odor bottle are directed through the outlet line onto the airflow tube (Figure 1B).\nRemove the delivered odor vapors by placing a vacuum funnel ~10 cm behind the locust antenna.\n2. Preparing Locust Antenna for Single Sensillum Recording",
    "Select a young-adult locust of either sex with fully-grown wings, but prior to the mating stage from a crowded colony. To restrain the locust, first amputate its legs. Seal the amputation sites with tissue adhesive (Vetbond, 3M). Secure the locust to a custom designed chamber using a small piece of electrical tape draped around its thorax (Figure 2A).\nUnder a dissection microscope, make a shallow groove in the wax platform (Figure 2A) for antenna placement. Place the antenna into the groove and stabilize it using batik wax at the two ends of the antenna (Figure 2B; an electrowaxer is used for melting the wax).\nInsert a ground electrode (chlorided silver wire) into the thorax (~1 cm away from head). Use batik wax to both seal the incision site and hold the ground wire in place (Figure 2A).\n3. Single Sensillum Recording to Monitor Odor-evoked Responses from Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs)\nPlace the stabilized locust antenna under a stereomicroscope (Leica M205C) on a vibration isolation table (TMC) (Figure 3A). Make sure that the base of the recording sensillum is clearly visible (Figure 3B).\nUse a micropipette puller (Sutter P-1000) to fabricate glass electrodes (impedance 3-10 MΩ when filled with locust saline9, tip diameter 1-3 μm) using a borosilicate glass capillary tube (O.D. 1.2 mm, I.D. 0.69 mm).\nPlace the glass electrode into a micropipette holder that is attached to a motorized micromanipulator (Sutter MP-285). Gently insert the electrode into the base of a sensillum (Figure 3B). Note that each sensillum can contain 3-50 ORNs in locusts10.\nAmplify the signal (10,000 times) using an A.C. amplifier (Grass P-55). Filter the signal between 0.3 - 10.0 kHz and acquire at a 15 kHz sampling rate (Figure 3D) using a data acquisition system (LabView, PCI-MIO-16E-4 DAQ cards; National Instruments).",
    "4. Locust Dissection Procedure for Antennal Lobe and Mushroom Body Recordings\nFollow the restraining procedures as described in section 2.1. Position the locust in a custom-designed chamber as shown in Figure 4A and B.\nTo perfuse saline during and after the dissection procedure, build a wax cup around the locust head. The wax cup should start just above the mouth parts, and extend beyond the compound eyes encompassing the region between the two antennae as shown in Figure 4C.\nTo allow the antennae to pass through the wax cup, create small tunnels on both sides using plastic (polyethylene) tubing (5 mm long, I.D. 0.86 mm). Ensure that the plastic tubing can slide through the wax cup. The latter is achieved by using a rubber gasket that tightly wraps around the plastic tube but is attached to the wax-cup (Figure 4C).\nUsing epoxy resin, attach the base of the antennae to the bottom end of the plastic tubing. This step ensures that the antennae are held in place even after the surrounding cuticle is removed.\nKeep the wax cup filled with saline solution9 from this point onwards. Begin by removing a central rectangular region between the two antennae (longer side of the rectangle aligned with the anteroposterior axis). Subsequently, remove cuticle in neighboring regions without disturbing the compound eyes and cuticle at the base of the antenna (Figure 4D).\nUsing fine forceps, gently remove air sacs and fat bodies surrounding the brain. At the end of this step, the locust brain should be clearly seen (Figure 4D). Notice that the brain regions that process the olfactory information (with light yellow pigmentation) are situated between the two antennae.",
    "In locusts the gut runs below the brain and along the length of the body. To prevent movement of the gut from potentially destabilizing the preparation, gently pull the foregut and cut it using fine scissors. Make a small incision in the abdomen just above the rectum and remove the gut by pulling the hindgut with coarse forceps. To prevent a saline leak, tie the abdomen immediately anterior to the incision site with suture threads.\nUse a small platform made of a thin wire coated with a fine layer of wax to elevate the brain and stabilize it11 during electrophysiology as shown in Figure 4D.\nThe insect brain is covered by a thin insulating sheath that needs to be removed prior to experiments. To desheath the brain, gently spread a small amount of an enzyme (0.3-0.4 mg protease, Sigma Aldrich) over the surface of the brain using fine forceps9. After ~5-10 s of enzyme application, rinse the brain thoroughly with saline. Using super-fine forceps very gently pinch and pull the sheath up and subsequently tear it open over the recording locations (AL and MB; shown in Figure 4E, F).\n5. Multi-unit Recordings from the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body\nPlace the locust preparation (Figure 5A) under a stereomicroscope suspended from a boom stand placed on a vibration isolation table.\nMaintain a constant saline perfusion rate (about 0.04 L/hr) throughout the experiment. Use a chlorided silver wire immersed in the saline-filled wax cup as the ground electrode.\nFor PN recordings, use a 16-channel silicon probe (NeuroNexus Technologies, item #A2x2-tet-3mm-150-150-121-A16, Figure 5B). Prior to each experiment, electroplate the electrodes with gold to achieve impedances in the 200-300 kΩ range. Use the circuit shown in Figure 7 for electroplating.",
    "Position the electrode close to the surface of the antennal lobe and gently insert it into the tissue using a manual micromanipulator (WPI, M3301R) (Figure 5D).\nAdvance the electrode in ~10 μm steps. Wait 2-3 min at each step and evaluate the acquired signal quality. In an ideal recording site, extracellular signals will be picked up by multiple recording channels and will have a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 3-5 times noise SDs).\nFor KC recordings, use a custom-made twisted wire tetrode (Figure 5C; step-by-step fabrication procedure presented in Section 6). Electroplate these electrodes as discussed in step 5.3. Place the tetrode on the surface of the MB (Figure 5E) as KC somata are restricted to the superficial layer of the MB8.\nBoth PN and KC recordings can be made simultaneously from same locust preparation as schematically shown in Figure 5A.\nWait at least 15 min after finding the recording location to allow stabilization of the electrodes.\nAcquire all extracellular signals at 15 KHz, filter between 0.3-6 KHz, and amplify (10,000 times) using a 16 channel AC amplifier (Biology Electronics Shop; Caltech, Pasadena, CA) (Figure 6A, B).\n6. Procedures to Make Twisted Wire Electrode for KC Recordings\nTo design a multi-unit electrode for KC recordings, use insulated nickel chromium wire (RO800, 0.0005\" filament)8.\nIf eight electrodes are desired then wrap the wire around a 10-15 cm long piece of cardboard 4 times. The ends of the cardboard can be covered with plastic tubing to prevent the edges from cutting the wire. While wrapping, make sure there is little slack, but ensure that the wire is not taut. Handle the wire carefully as it breaks easily.",
    "Bunch the wires together at the top of the cardboard and use a piece of tape (Time Tape, T-534-RP) to hold them together. Cut the strands at the other end. Remove the wire strands and group the wires at the cut end as well using another piece of the tape.\nUsing a titer plate shaker (Thermo Scientific, Model 4625Q), wind the strands together (~72 rev/min for 3 min) to form one twisted wire. The bottom of the taped strands can be clipped to the titer plate rotor and the top can be clipped to a boom stand. During winding, the wire should have little slack, yet not be taut.\nMelt the insulation together with a heat gun (Weller 6966C) to stick the individual strands together and form a single wire. 3-4 slow passes (3-4 sec each) over the length of the wire should be sufficient to heat and fuse the strands together. Then release the wire from the bottom and allow it to relax. Trim the wire near the ends to remove the tape.\nInsert one end of the wire through a 5-6 cm long, glass capillary tube (O.D. 1.0 mm, I.D. 0.58 mm). Tease apart the twisted wire at one end using fine tweezers and remove the coating by very briefly torching the end using a flame. This step must be done carefully; exposing the wire to the flame for too long will cause the strands to melt and tangle.\nGently separate the 8 strands on the flamed end and solder each strand separately into an 8-pin IC socket. Coat the top of the IC socket with epoxy to hold the strands and glass capillary in place. Also place a small drop of epoxy at the other end of the capillary to hold the wire in place (Figure 5C).",
    "Finally, cut the tip of the wire at a 45 degree angle with carbide scissors about 0.5 cm from the capillary tip.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
