    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCritical: Use only Milli-Q water with resistance greater than 18.2 MΩ/cm at 25°C (or any commercially available equivalent) for making all reagents and perform all the steps at their indicated temperature. Also, since the resin preparation protocol involves three consecutive days, one must plan accordingly: once the protocol is initiated, we do not recommend storing intermediates beyond the two 12–16 h incubation steps in the detailed protocol.\nAmine coupling\nTiming: ∼ 12–16 h at 4°C\nThis section accomplishes the coupling of Cystamine to Sepharose.\nAdd 3 mL of NHS-activated Sepharose slurry into a 50 mL tube.\nNote: (i) NHS-activated Sepharose comes in a bottle as a ∼50% slurry in 100% isopropanol. Shake the NHS-activated Sepharose slurry bottle well to resuspend settled beads. A good way to get an even slurry is by inverting the bottle 10–12 times until the settled NHS-activated Sepharose becomes fully resuspended in the slurry, as seen visually. (ii) Use a clean wide-bore pipette to measure the resuspended slurry and then transfer it to a clean 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor to separate the isopropanol from the beads and carefully remove the supernatant using a pipette or a needle aspirator.\nNote: It is a good idea to use a swinging-bucket rotor throughout the preparation of the SNO-RAC resin because such rotors are more efficient at tightly pelleting the NHS-activated Sepharose beads. In comparison, when using a fixed-angle rotor, the NHS-activated Sepharose beads tend to stick to the wall of the tube to a greater degree, leading to greater loss of beads upon aspiration.\nRinse the slurry by adding 10 mL of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to the tube.\nMix by inverting the tube 10–12 times.",
    "Centrifuge at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a pipette or a needle aspirator.\nRepeat step 3, for a total of two rinse steps with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0).\nAdd 15 mL (5 times the initial 3 mL slurry volume) of freshly prepared 200 mM cystamine in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and invert the slurry tube for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nWashing after amine coupling\nTiming: ∼30 min at 4°C\nThis section accomplishes washing off the excess amine and performing buffer exchange in preparation for the steps outlined in the next section.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1000 × g for 2 min in a swinging-bucket rotor and remove the unreacted cystamine supernatant using a pipette or aspirator.\nWash the resin thoroughly in the following sequence:\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to the tube.\nResuspend the slurry thoroughly by inverting the tube several times.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nRemove the phosphate buffer supernatant from the resin using a pipette.\nRepeat wash step 7(a) two more times, for a total of three washes with phosphate buffer.\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of milli-Q water to the tube.\nResuspend the beads thoroughly by inverting the tube several times.\nSpin at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge.\nRemove the milli-Q water supernatant from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 7c two more times, for a total of three washes with milli-Q water.\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) methanol to the tube.\nResuspend the beads by inverting 10–12 times.",
    "Spin at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 7e two more times, for a total of three washes with methanol, and immediately proceed to the next step.\nNote: To ensure minimum carryover of each wash buffer to the next step with a different wash buffer (such as between steps 7b and 7c and between steps 7d and 7e), withdraw as much wash buffer as possible using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 ½ G needle (used due to its narrow lumen) inserted to the bottom of the beads, prior to the addition of the subsequent wash buffer.\nDisulfide reduction\nTiming: ∼3 h, at 22°C–25°C\nThis section accomplishes the reduction of bound disulfides to free thiols.\nBefore proceeding to this next step, be sure aspirate out as much methanol as possible from the previous step using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 ½ G needle, as mentioned in the note above, to minimize the carryover into this next step.\nReduce the bead-bound disulfides by adding 15 mL (5× the initial slurry volume) of freshly prepared 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubating the slurry tube at 22°C–25°C for 3 h with constant inversion using a Mini Tube Rotator (VWR Catalog # 76446-768) set at the rotating speed of 30–40 rpm, or equivalent.\nWashing after disulfide reduction\nTiming: ∼30 min at 4°C\nThis section accomplishes washing off the excess reducing agent and performing buffer exchange in preparation for the steps outlined in the next section.\nCentrifuge the reduced slurry at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nRemove the supernatant using a pipette or aspirator.",
    "Then remove any residual DTT supernatant using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 ½ G needle, as mentioned previously after step 7f.\nWash the reduced resin thoroughly in the following sequence:\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to the tube.\nMix by inverting the tube a few times to resuspend beads.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nRemove the supernatant phosphate buffer from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 10a two more times, for a total of three washes with phosphate buffer.\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial volume) methanol to the tube.\nMix the beads into a slurry by inverting the tube 10–12 times.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nThen remove the supernatant methanol from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 10c two more times, for a total of three washes with methanol.\nNote: As described above earlier (in the note under step 7f), in order to ensure minimum carryover of the wash buffer to the next wash step with a different wash buffer, withdraw the previous wash buffer as much as possible after step 10b, using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 ½ G needle (used due to its narrow lumen) inserted to the bottom of the beads, prior to the addition of the subsequent wash buffer in step 10c.\nGenerating the activated thiol resin\nTiming: ∼12–16 h at 4°C\nThis section accomplishes the reaction of the Sepharose-bound thiols with 2-dipyridyl disulfide to generate the final SNO-RAC resin.\nAdd 15 mL (5× the initial slurry volume) of freshly prepared 200 mM 2-dipyridyl disulfide dissolved in methanol to the resin.",
    "Mix by inversion by hand 10–12 times.\nRotate the tube in the dark at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nNote: It is advisable to wrap the tube in aluminum foil to protect the resin from light.\nWashing after generating the activated thiol resin\nTiming: ∼30 min at 4°C\nThis section accomplishes the removal of the excess 2-dipyridyl disulfide and performs buffer exchange in preparation for storage of the active resin.\nCentrifuge the activated thiol resin at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor and remove the supernatant using a pipette or aspirator.\nNote: Beyond this point, keep the resin protected from light throughout by keeping it wrapped in aluminum foil when outside the centrifuge and performing all the subsequent steps in a dimly lit part of the laboratory.\nWash the resin thoroughly in the following sequence:\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of methanol to the resin.\nResuspend the beads by inverting the tube 10–12 times.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nRemove the supernatant methanol from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 13a two more times, for a total of three washes with methanol.\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of milli-Q water to the tube.\nMix by inverting the tube 10–12 times.\nSpin the tube at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor.\nRemove the supernatant milli-Q water from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 13c two more times, for a total of three washes with water.\nAdd 9 mL (3× the initial slurry volume) of Isopropanol to the tube.\nResuspend the beads thoroughly by inverting the tube 10–12 times.",
    "Spin at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4°C in a swinging-bucket rotor(iii) Remove the supernatant isopropanol from the resin using a pipette or aspirator.\nRepeat wash step 13e two more times, for a total of three washes with isopropanol.\nNote: As described above earlier (under step 7f), in order to ensure minimum carryover of each wash buffer to the next wash step with a different wash buffer, aspirate out any residual wash buffer after the steps 13b and 13d (i.e., prior to steps 13c and 13e), using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 ½ G needle (used due to its narrow lumen) inserted to the bottom of the beads, prior to the addition of the subsequent wash buffer in steps 13c and 13e.\nResin storage\nTiming: ∼2 min\nThis section accomplishes preparing the SNO-RAC resin for storage under the specified conditions.\nAfter the final wash in step 13f, add a volume of isopropanol equal to the final bead volume to make a ∼50% slurry. Ideally this is 1.5 mL (for 3 mL final volume of slurry), but any accumulated losses during pipetting/aspirating will reduce this.\nNote: SNO-RAC resin is now ready and can be used within four weeks without significant reduction in its ability to bind S-nitrosylated proteins. This resin can be stored in the dark in a foil-wrapped tube at 4°C for future use, for up to 4 weeks.\nCritical: Since the resin beads will settle down, always remember to resuspend the beads in the isopropanol by tapping and gently inverting the tube before each use.\nQuality control – Quantifying the thiol-binding capacity of the prepared resin\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThis section accomplishes the estimation of Binding Capacity of this SNO-RAC resin.\nEstimation of the Binding Capacity of the prepared resin.",
    "Prepare 1 ml of 100 mM DTT in 100 mM Phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 and keep aside at room temperature.\nResuspend prepared resin to a 50% slurry by gentle swirling/mixing.\nUsing wide orifice tips take out 150 μL of the 50% slurry and transfer it to a microfuge tube.\nSpin at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration.\nAdd 200 μL of 100 mM Phosphate buffer and spin at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nRepeat the above step 15f two more times for a total of three washes with 100 mM Phosphate buffer.\nRemove the supernatant and add visually an equal volume of 100 mM Phosphate buffer as the packed bead volume to get a ∼50% resin slurry in 100 mM Phosphate buffer.\nIn a fresh microfuge tube, add 50 μL of the 50% resin slurry to 450 μL of 100 mM DTT solution that has been freshly prepared in 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0; step 15a) and to a separate tube containing 450 μL of 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) as negative control add 50 μL of 50% slurry as negative control.\nIncubate both tubes for 5 min at 22°C–25°C with intermittent shaking.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 1000 × g at 22°C–25°C.\nAdd 100 μL of the supernatant to 900 μL 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Discard the remaining supernatant and keep the resin pellet at 22°C–25°C for use in subsequent step 16.\nMeasure the Absorbance at 343 nm (ε343 = 8.08 mM−1 cm−1 for 2-thiopyridine) using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer.\nCalculate the binding capacity, accounting for the 100-fold dilution, using the following formula:\nB\ni\nn\nd\ni\nn\ng\nc\na\np\na\nc\ni\nt\ny\n(\nμ\nM\no\nl\n/\nm\nL",
    ")\n=\n(\nA\nb\ns\n343\n×\n100\n)\n/\nε\n343\nNote: Note:\nIn our hands the total binding capacity is generally ∼7 μmol disulfide/mL of resin slurry. If the binding capacity of the prepared resin is less than 5 μmol disulfide/mL of resin, please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section below.\nEven after proper storage of the resin in dark at 4°C, the binding capacity of the resin was reduced by ∼60% after six months and was found to be 2.6 μmol disulfide/mL. Therefore, we do not recommend long term storage of the resin. If the resin that was prepared more than four weeks ago and stored optimally at 4°C in the dark still needs to be used for a SNO-RAC experiment due to time constraints, please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section below.\nQuality control – Confirming lack of free thiols in resin\nTiming: ∼ 1 h\nThis section accomplishes performing a quality control test of the freshly prepared resin by confirming that no free thiols are present in the SNO-RAC resin.\nConfirm that no free thiols are present in the resin (the DTNB assay for free thiols should be negative).\nWash the DTT treated and the untreated control resin bead pellets from step 15l that had been stored at 22°C–25°C, with 0.5 mL of 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and centrifuge for 1 min at 1000 × g at 22°C–25°C.\nRepeat step 16a four more times, for a total of five washes with 0.5 mL of 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0).\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 0.5 mL 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) plus 5 μL of 10 mM 5,5′-Dithionitrobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) [DTNB] freshly prepared in methanol, to each resin pellet.\nMix gently using your fingers to tap the tube.",
    "Incubate for 5 min at 22°C–25°C with intermittent gentle inversion by hand.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 1000 × g at 22°C–25°C.\nAdd 100 μL supernatant to 900 μL 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), mix and add to a cuvette.\nRead the absorbance at 412 nm.\nCompare the reading to reduced glutathione (GSH) standards from 0 to 100 μM, that have also been similarly treated with 10 μL/mL of 10 mM DTNB. These GSH standards are prepared by creating two-fold serial dilutions of 100 μM GSH (serial dilutions range from 100 μM to 3.125 μM) in 100 mM Phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and adding 5 μL of 10 mM DTNB to each serial dilution, gently mixing by hand, and incubating for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nNote: Using this protocol for resin preparation, we do not detect any free thiol remaining on the resin. The absorbance of DTT-treated resin and the untreated resin (disulfide form) at 412 nM after DTNB treatment should be similar to absorbance reading of the 0 μM GSH background. If free thiols are detected in the prepared SNO-RAC resin, then please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section below.\nResin equilibration for use\nTiming: ∼90 min\nThis section accomplishes the equilibration of the stored resin just before its use in a SNO-RAC experiment.\nEquilibration of stored resin before using it in a SNO-RAC experiment.\nNote: This needs to be performed on the same day as the SNO-RAC experiment.\nTake 250 μL of the resin for each SNO-RAC sample pair (i.e. sample and its minus ascorbate control) in the following way.\nGently mix by tapping the storage tube with your finger until the stored resin (i.e. stored as 50% slurry in isopropanol) is resuspended uniformly in the isopropanol.",
    "Using a wide-bore (or cut) pipette tip, transfer 250 μL of the well-mixed slurry to a microfuge tube for each sample pair in your SNO-RAC assay.\nNote: For each biological sample comprising of 1–2 mg of total protein lysate prepared from cultured cells, mammalian tissues or C. elegans, SNO-RAC will be performed using 100 μL of the equilibrated resin as a 50% slurry in one tube with the added ascorbate to remove the SNO-moiety and generate free thiols, and in a second tube with 100 μL of the equilibrated resin as a 50% slurry but without any added ascorbate (as the negative control). Therefore, it is best to begin here with 250 μL of slurry to account for loss of volume in subsequent equilibration steps.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g at 4°C for 1 min using a swinging bucket rotor.\nCarefully aspirate away the isopropanol without disturbing the resin, by tilting the tube at an angle of ∼45° and then aspirating out the supernatant using a pipette tip.\nAdd 500 μL of HEN buffer (100 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM Neocuproine,) to the resin, and mix by constant inversion at 4°C for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g at 4°C for 1 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant with a pipette tip.\nAdd an equal volume of fresh HEN Buffer to the resin pellet (i.e., add 125 μL of HEN Buffer to the 125 μL packed volume of resin from the original 250 μL of 50% slurry, per sample pair) and keep on ice and covered from light until it is ready to be added to the lysate samples.\nNote: The equilibrated resin should be used within 2–4 h.",
    "Mix the beads gently and using a wide-bore pipette tip, add 100 μL of resuspended, equilibrated resin to each of the paired SNO-RAC samples immediately after the addition of the ascorbate to the SNO-RAC tubes (or after omitting the addition of the ascorbate in the negative control tubes). See Seth et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for a detailed SNO-RAC procedure.\nNote: Using 100 μL of this resin per individual sample in our SNO-RAC experiments has given us results that are similar to those obtained with the discontinued GE resin,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] as seen by Silver-staining of the total SNO-proteome or by immunoblotting with protein specific antibodies (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3096-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
