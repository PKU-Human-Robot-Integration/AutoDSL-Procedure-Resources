  "procedures": [
    "The REQS consists of a Drosophila Activity Monitor unit (for source information, please see Table of Materials) mounted on a rotating arm that is controlled by a motor unit (Figure 1). The activity monitor determines how often in a given time span the array of laser beams dissecting the middle of the assay tube is disrupted. For detailed drawings and an in-depth characterization, see our previous publication9. While our system uses the LAM25H unit, the REQS can be modified to accommodate other Drosophila Activity Monitor units as well.\n1. Testing the Setup of the REQS\nLoad test flies into glass specimen tubes by anesthetizing the animals with CO2 or other chosen method for handling, moving them into the empty tubes, and capping the tubes.\nInsert capped glass specimen tubes into the slots of the activity monitor unit. Secure the tubes using rubber O-rings (17-18 gauge) and/or rubber bands on both sides of the unit to ensure the tubes do not move during rotation:\n\t\nSlip one O-ring over the specimen tube and position the O-ring close to the midpoint of the tube. Insert the specimen tube into a slot of the activity monitor from the front and center it.\nMove the O-ring as needed and ensure that once the specimen tube is centered, the O-ring is slid as close to the activity monitor unit as possible. Fix the specimen tube in place by slipping a second O-ring over the glass tube from the back, again moving the O-ring as close to the activity monitor unit as possible.\nInitiate rotation of the REQS by flipping the power switch on the front of the unit. Adjust the rotation speed with the dial on the front of the unit to the desired speed (4 rpm (rotations per min) in this example).",
    "NOTE: The rotational speed in this example was chosen to match a previously published study7. As different rotational speeds will result in different animal activity levels, when initiating a new study, optimization of rotational speed for the specific experimental set-up (genotype, length of exercise bout, etc.) may be necessary.\n\tNOTE: It is important to ensure that the tubes are properly positioned so that they do not drag along the bottom of the REQS unit during rotation.\nTest the connection to the data collection system provided with the Drosophila Activity Monitor unit by opening the DAMSystem308 software and ensuring that the connection light remains green for several rotations. The software will begin recording data into a text file \"monitorX\" (X being the unit number if multiple monitors are in use) immediately upon initiation. Recording frequency can be adjusted in the \"Preferences\" tab; we typically record in 5 min intervals.\nInvestigate the text file generated by the DAMSystem308 software to ensure that the data connection is functioning properly. Problems with the connection result in cutouts, time points where 0 activity is recorded for all positions in the REQS (see Representative Results and Table 2). If cutouts occur, adjust data connections leading to the rotating phone jack, as during rotation, this connection can become loose or twisted. We find that stabilizing the connection with tape helps to prevent this problem.\n2. Preparation of Animals\nNOTE: All animals were raised and tested under standard conditions in an incubator (25 Â°C, 60-70% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) on molasses/cornmeal media10.",
    "Two weeks prior to the planned experiment, set up vials with controlled animal density to collect the experimental flies from; we typically set up vials with 7 males and 10 females. With a healthy stock, from a single vial, approximately 15 virgin males and 15 females can be collected over a 4 day time period. Adjust the number of vials set up based on the number of animals needed for the assay; a typical assay in our laboratory includes 10 sets of 10 virgin males and females per genotype (100 males and 100 females).\n\tNOTE: Non-virgin flies can be used depending on the specific experimental question. If conducting longer-term experiments with non-virgin animals, crawling larvae may interfere with accurate activity monitoring.\nRemove the parent flies one week after setting up the vials.\nStarting on day 10 after setting up the vials, collect virgin flies from the vials and store them separated by sex.\nCollect sufficient animals for the experiment and age them as needed, 3 days in this example.\n\tNOTE: We typically anesthetize the animals with CO2 for handling. CO2 is known to impact animal activity levels for extended periods of time after treatment (for example, see Bartholomew et al.  201511). If the CO2 effect interferes with planned downstream assays or analyses, use a different anesthesia method such as ice anesthetization.\n3. Data Collection with the REQS\nAnesthetize the animals to be used for the exercise quantification study with CO2 or another anesthesia method. Divide them into groups as needed and load the groups of animals into the empty glass tubes of the activity monitor; in this example, 10 animals of the same age are loaded per glass tube, with 10 replicates for each animal type (sex/genotype). Make sure to note which animal type is loaded in each tube.",
    "NOTE: For longer experiments, food can be included in the specimen tubes. In this case, it is essential that the food is secure and does not become dislodged during rotation.\nLoad the glass assay tubes into the REQS unit and secure them with the rubber O-rings. If working with more than one sex/genotype, using a randomized block design or randomization of the position of the animals in the REQS will eliminate any potential position effects. Randomization can be achieved by assigning each vial a random number, for example from a web-based random number generator (e.g., https://www.randomizer.org/ ) or in a spreadsheet, and then ordering the vials based on the random number.\nPlace the REQS into the incubator to ensure constant temperature, humidity, and light conditions. Ensure that both the data and power cables are properly connected.\nAllow the animals to recover from anesthesia and to acclimatize to the new environment for 1 h.\nBegin the experiment by initiating rotation of the REQS at the desired speed.\n\tNOTE: Another option is to first collect baseline activity data from the animals before the initiation of rotation, followed by recording activity levels in response to rotational stimulation.\nInitiate data collection by opening the DAMsystem308 software (simply opening the software initiates data collection). Data are written into a text file at the set interval (here, 5 min); if needed, change interval settings in the \"Preferences\" tab (see step 1.4).\nTo ensure that the data are successfully transmitted to the computer, open the text file generated by the DAMsystem308 software after one or two time intervals have passed and confirm that data are being written to the file. Close and re-open this file to see data from any additional time points. Collect data for the desired amount of time; in this example, 2 h.",
    "NOTE: Do not open the incubator during the assay period, as the animals are very sensitive to any disturbance and will likely respond with increased activity.\nAt the end of the exercise assay, terminate data collection by closing the DAMsystem308 software, then turn off the REQS. Remove the animals from the glass assay tubes and clean the tubes. The animals can be moved back into food vials if repeated measures at different ages are needed.\n\tNOTE: If deaths occur during the exercise regime, it should be recorded, as the presence of dead flies can impact activity counts. In our experience with the DGRP2 fly lines12,13, exercise at 4 rpm for 2 h did not result in any deaths, but weaker strains might respond differently.\n4. Data Analysis\nOpen the .txt file labeled \"Monitor1\" produced by the DAMSystem308 software.\nInspect the data file for any problems that might have occurred during the data acquisition (missed time points, etc.; Table 1). If necessary, censor the file by removing data points at the beginning and end of the recording.\nUsing the statistical software of your choice (e.g., R), analyze the data collected. Generate descriptive statistics and carry out analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate effects such as sex and genotype, if the data are normally distributed. If the data are not normally distributed, use non-parametric methods, such as Kruskal-Wallis tests, to compare groups. The specific analyses required will depend on the specific scientific question and the experimental design.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
