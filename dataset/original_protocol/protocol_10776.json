    "1. QD Solubilization\nThis is a method appropriate for CdTe. Similar methods can be used with other types of QDs such as InP/ZnS20 and CdSe/ZnS 21.\nPrepare a solution of CdTe QDs in toluene at 15 μM (optical density = 2.5 at the first exciton peak).\nTransfer 200 μL of this stock into a glass vial. Do not use plastic!\nAdd 800 μL toluene, 1 mL of 200 mM borate buffer (pH 9) and 2 μL of 11.5 M mercaptopropionic acid (MPA).\nCap the vial and shake it vigorously for 30-60 seconds.\nThe aqueous and organic-solvent phases will separate spontaneously. The aqueous phase will become the color of the QDs. To avoid the toluene layer, remove it and discard it. Then transfer the aqueous phase into a clean vial.\nPurify the solubilized QDs by washing/filtering four times using a 500 μL, 10000 molecular weight cutoff centrifuge filter. The filters should be spun at 3000 x g for 13 minutes. For at least the last two washes, wash with the desired final buffer.\nAfter the final wash, suspend the washed QDs in 50 mM borate buffer at the desired pH and store at 4 °C. They will be stable for 1-2 weeks.\nMeasure absorbance and emission spectra to estimate concentration based upon published formulas 22.\nRepresentative results: Figure 1 shows an image of CdTe QDs under UV lamp illumination, and emission spectra before and after water solubilization, showing negligible change from the cap exchange. The size values are the core diameter measured by electron microscopy.\n2. QD Conjugation to Antibiotic\nThis part of the protocol is applicable to any negatively-charged water-solubilized nanoparticle, including most commercial QDs, metal particles, and more19.",
    "Any molecule will work that either self-assembles to the negatively-charged solubilized QDs, or that has a reactive group that can be conjugated, such as a primary amine. In this example, we are using polymyxin B (PMB), which is positively charged and self-assembles without need for conjugation reagents. Dissolve the PMB in H2O at 60 μM. (If the antibiotic chosen is not soluble in H2O, dissolve in DMSO or ethanol at a concentration of 0.1-1 mM). This will be a 10x solution (in H2O) or a 100x solution (in solvent).\nCalculate how much QD solution you will need for the bacterial toxicity experiments. For a 96-well plate with 0.3 mL per well in quadruplicates, 0.5 mL of 200 nM conjugate is needed. Prepare two tubes containing 100 μL of 1 μM quantum dots in 50 mM borate buffer.\nIf coupling to a primary amine, prepare a 19 mg/mL (100 mM) solution of 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in H2O. EDC in solution is not stable; use immediately and throw the rest away.\nAdd 50 μL of the 10x antibiotic solution (in H2O) or 5 μL of the 100x solution (in solvent) to the conjugate tube. For PMB:CdTe conjugation at molar ratio of 30:1, add 50 μL of 60 μM PMB. Add H2O or solvent to the QD only control tube.\nIf needed, add 1 μL of the EDC stock solution to the conjugate tube.\nBring up the conjugate volume to 0.5 mL with the appropriate buffer (borate buffer or PBS; no amine-containing buffers such as Tris, as they will inhibit EDC).\nShield tubes from light with aluminum foil, and place on a nutator or rocker for 1 hr. If aggregation occurs, repeat the conjugation with lower concentrations of antibiotic. Titrate the concentration upwards until the particles do not aggregate.",
    "Wash the conjugates by passing through an appropriate filter. 10000 molecular weight cutoff works for most antibiotics, but not for proteins or antibodies.\nDepending upon the molecule, different methods can be used to estimate the number of antibiotic molecules per QD: absorbance or fluorescence spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).\nRepresentative results. In this example, PMB conjugation is characterized by changes in QD emission spectrum. Figure 2 shows the spectra of CdTe QDs with PMB addition.\n3. Preparation of Bacteria for 96-well Screen; Determination of Antibiotic IC50\nThis is applicable to almost any bacterial strain grown in the appropriate medium18. The exact length of time the recordings should continue depends upon the bacterial growth rate. In our example, we use Escherichia coli grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium.\nIn order to choose the appropriate QD conjugate concentrations, it is important to know the IC50 of the antibiotic to be conjugated and if the QDs alone are toxic. This should be begun 2 days before the conjugation experiment. In the evening, seed 10 mL of bacterial growth medium from a fresh colony, using correct sterile and biosafety technique.\nThe next day, 1-2 hours before the experiment, fill each of the wells of a clear-bottom 96-well plate with a nearly-maximal amount of growth medium. Using a multichannel pipette, seed each well with 1-50 μL of bacterial culture (the concentration will depend upon how fast the particular strain grows and will need to be calibrated by your laboratory).\nPut the plate onto the plate reader and set it to read every 10 minutes for 2 hours at a determined wavelength (usually 600 nm). Monitor the plate so that the bacteria do not grow too dense too quickly.",
    "When the cells all reach OD=0.1-0.15, remove the plate from the plate reader and stop the recording.\nAdd drug alone and QDs alone at different concentrations in at least triplicates. Use one side of the plate as a \"dark\" control and one half to be illuminated. A suggested layout is given in Figure 3. The concentrations should span a wide enough range to include one concentration that inhibits the bacteria very little, and one that kills them all.\nShield the \"dark\" side of the plate with aluminum foil. Expose the other side to a lamp at the desired wavelength. We use a custom 96-well, 440-nm lamp made from 2.4 mW LEDs (Figure 4) and irradiate for 30-60 min. The black plates with clear bottoms help shield the unexposed bacteria from stray light. An empty column may also be used between the exposed and un-exposed sides.\nAfter light exposure, put the plate into the plate reader and record OD 600 every 10 minutes for 5-12 hours depending upon growth rate. Keep the temperature < 32 °C if possible to avoid drying of the cultures.\nPlot the growth curves at a selected time point vs. log [concentration] and determine the IC50 of the antibiotic using the Hill equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3969/3969eq1.jpg\nwhere H is the Hill coefficient, ymax is the highest point of growth (ideally on a plateau), and ymin is the zero-point, also ideally on a plateau. It is unlikely that QDs alone will show much toxicity to the cells at the concentrations used, so a value will not be determined.",
    "Representative results. At the end of the recording period, clear wells will indicate complete cell death, and a gradient of cell density should appear along increasing concentrations of the drug. The bacteria should show S-shaped growth curves (Figure 5 A); the location of the maximum plateau will vary greatly from strain to strain and also depends upon temperature. A given time point can be chosen as representative and the values plotted vs. Log[antibiotic] to give the IC50 (Figure 5 B). To evaluate QD toxicity, survival vs. Log[QD] may also be plotted, but achieving significant bacterial killing with QDs alone is rare (Figure 5 C).\n4. Preparation of Bacteria for 96-well Screen with Antibiotic/QDs\nThe day before the experiment, seed 10 mL of culture from a fresh colony into the appropriate rich medium, using correct sterile and biosafety technique. The QD-antibiotic conjugate should be prepared on this day, unless it is highly unstable.\n1-2 hours before the experiment, fill each of the wells of a clear-bottom 96-well plate with a nearly-maximal amount of growth medium. Using a multichannel pipette, seed each well with 1-50 μL of bacterial culture.\nPut the plate onto the plate reader and set it to read every 10 minutes for 2 hours at the same wavelength as in Part 3.\nWhen the cells all reach OD=0.1-0.15, remove the plate from the plate reader and stop the recording.",
    "Add QD conjugates at different concentrations in at least quadruplicate. Use one side of the plate as a \"dark\" control and one half to be illuminated. A suggested layout is given in Figure 6. A bacteria-only control strip should always be included in case problems with the culture, temperature, etc. affect growth conditions. A single strip of drug only and QD only should also be included to ensure that they match the control plate done previously. The rest of the wells are dedicated to conjugates in order to allow for good statistics.\nShield the \"dark\" side of the plate with aluminum foil. Expose the other side to a lamp at the desired wavelength.\nAfter light exposure, put the plate into the plate reader and record OD 600 every 10 minutes for 5-12 hours. Keep the temperature < 32 °C if possible to avoid drying of the cultures.\nRepresentative results. The combination of QDs and antibiotic may be less toxic than antibiotic alone; equally toxic; or more toxic. This can be quantified using the growth curves and IC50 measurements. Figure 7 shows an example of conjugates that equally toxic as antibiotic alone, and an example of conjugates that are more toxic.\n5. Plate Count\nChoose one or more wells of the treated 96-well plate to be used for serial dilutions and colony counting.\nMake a serial dilution of each of the selected bacterial samples with PBS or saline solution (0.9 % NaCl). Transfer 20 μL of the bacterial solution and dilute it with 180 μL saline solution, change the pipette tip, mix and transfer 20 μL of diluted bacterial solution to 180 μL saline solution. Repeat 6 times.",
    "Take 10 μL from each dilution and plate on an appropriate solid media plate. All 8 concentrations of one sample may be plated on a 10 cm round Petri dish, though rectangular dishes are preferred as it is easier to line things up.\nLet it dry on the bench for 15 min. then incubate at appropriate temperature for your bacteria for 16 hours.\nCount colonies and calculate colony forming units (CFU) according to (# of colonies x dilution factor)/volume plated= CFU/mL.\nFigure 8 shows an example CFU plate.\n6.
