    "**Sample preparation**● TIMING5-15h\n1| Prepare a sample of the protein complex to be studied in H<sub>2</sub>O solution. The recommended starting protein concentration in H<sub>2</sub>O solution should be in the range of 3-30 mg/mL. The protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution should be dialyzed against buffer overnight to remove unwanted additives \\(e.g., glycerol) before use. \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The additives \\(e.g., glycerol) are removed before use. Some additives in buffer will affect lyophilization in step 4.\n2| Make sure the purity of the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution is >95%. Protein purity can be determined by SDS-PAGE with some modifications, or by HPLC or MS as described preciously<sup>23</sup>.\n3| Determine the concentration of protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution as described preciously<sup>23</sup>. Concentrate the protein H<sub>2</sub>O solution if it is <3 mg/mL.\n4| For sample and buffer lyophilization, aliquots \\(e.g.,10 tubes, each 60 μL) of proteins or buffers were lyophilized to dryness using the lyophilizer.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: FT-IR analysis requires high concentration solutions \\(typically >3mg/mL in both H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O) to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The protein and buffer solution should be lyophilized together. After freeze-drying, the tube containing lyophilized protein or buffer are sealed immediately with sealing film to prevent H<sub>2</sub>O in air.\n▲CRITICAL STEP: Control the freeze-drying temperature, maintain it low enough \\(e.g.,-20ºC) during the process to avoid changes in protein characteristics.\n5| There are typically two methods to prepare the fully deuterated protein.\n\\(A) Lyophilize aliquots \\(e.g., 60μL) of protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution at >3mg/mL to dryness. Reconstitute the lyophilized powder with D<sub>2</sub>O \\(e.g., 60μL), and lyophilize the protein-D<sub>2</sub>O to dryness again. Reconstitute the protein sample with D<sub>2</sub>O \\(e.g., 60 μL) for FT-IR experiments.",
    "\\(B) Lyophilize aliquots \\(e.g., 60 μL) of protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution at the >3mg/mL to dryness. Reconstitute the lyophilized powder with D<sub>2</sub>O \\(e.g., 60μL), and then incubate the protein-D<sub>2</sub>O overnight for FT-IR experiments.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The D<sub>2</sub>O buffer solution is prepared simultaneously the same way as the fully deuterated protein in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer solution.\n**Equipment preparation**● TIMING2-8h \n6| Turn on air-conditioning and a liquid desiccant system in the room. Control the temperature at 25ºC.\n7| Turn on the drying equipment for the instrument.\n8| Turn on the FT-IR source. \n9| Turn on the FT-IR spectrometer.\n10| Turn on the computer and monitor, and then start the FT-IR collection program. \n11| Set the data path of the operating program to store the data.\n**Collecting FT-IR spectra for protein**● TIMING4-8h\n12| Set the spectrometer resolution to 4 cm<sup>−1</sup>.\n13| Set the spectral range from 4,000 to 500 cm6−1^.\n14| Set the number of scans.\n15| Select the default paths for each group of files.\n16| Collect a background spectrum without the IR cell.\n▲CRITICAL STEP: If the water vapor is not purged completely by dry air, there will be peaks in the region of 1500-1200 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 4000-3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. If these peaks appear, check the tubing and make sure there is no air leakage, and then purge for a longer period of time as described previously<sup>23</sup>.\n17| Assembling the CaF<sub>2</sub> liquid cell. For the demountable transmission CaF<sub>2</sub> liquid cell comprising a rectangular window and an appropriate spacer, the spacer should be placed between the windows. Typically, the path length used for protein characterization in H<sub>2</sub>O is <10 μm, usually 6.0 or 7.5 μm. After the spacer is positioned appropriately, the cell can be reassembled with four machine screws.",
    "▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The spectrum for protein in H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained in films <10 μm to permit IR radiation passing through the material under observation.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: Only the demountable transmission cell is recommended for H/D exchange experiments by ensuring the time from sample preparation to acquisition of the first spectrum was <60 s.\n18| Addition of H<sub>2</sub>O buffer or protein in buffer to the cell. After the cell is reassembled, load the cell with solution using a needleless tuberculin syringe through a loading port. The solution should be slowly forced or injected into the cell to avoid the formation of air bubbles or unfilled spacers.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: During filling, ensure that the sample covers the entire window surface without the presence of air bubbles. \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The spectrum for the H<sub>2</sub>O solution is acquired before the spectrum for the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution.\n19| Collect the spectrum of the buffer in H<sub>2</sub>O. \n20| Clean the cell. Usually, the CaF<sub>2</sub> cell should be rinsed with water and ethanol and dried by suction using an aspirator or hand-operated vacuum pump.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The cell should not be disassembled between the buffer and protein collection. \n21| Fill the cell with protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution. Ensure that there are no air bubbles or empty cell areas. Collect a spectrum for the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution.\n22| Do not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Repeat step 21 three times. \n23| Do not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Reconstitute the lyophilized buffer with H<sub>2</sub>O. Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.",
    "▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The spectrum for reconstituted buffer is acquired before the spectrum for the reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution. Do not reassemble the cell. Clean the cell as described in step 20. Reconstitute the lyophilized protein with H<sub>2</sub>O buffer. Fill the cell with reconstituted protein and collect the spectrum.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The reconstituted sample with turbidity cannot be used for the experiment.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: Reconstitute the lyophilized protein with H<sub>2</sub>O solution gently to avoid the formation of air bubbles. The protein is viscous and air bubbles can easily form. \n24| Calculate IR absorbance spectra for the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution and reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution. Calculate the secondary structure content of protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution and reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution as described previously<sup>23</sup>. \n\\(A) There are no significant differences in the α-helix and β-sheet content measured by FT-IR between the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O and reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O buffer. \n\\(B) If the secondary structure contents are different, lyophilization causes some changes in the protein. The protein should be lyophilized to a certain volume \\(e.g.,10 μL) instead of lyophilized to dryness. \n25| Dismantle and then clean the cell. Wash the CaF<sub>2</sub> window with water and ethyl alcohol \\(<sub>1 mL volume), and then with an excess of water \\(</sub>10 mL volume). Wipe the windows gently with lens cleaning paper.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The CaF<sub>2</sub> window should be clean to avoid bubble formation while adding the sample in the following experiment.\n26| Assemble the CaF<sub>2</sub> liquid cell as described in step 17. The path length is increased to result in a higher signal-to-noise ratio for sample in D<sub>2</sub>O. Typically, the path length used for H/D exchange is 50 μm. \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The demountable transmission cell is recommended for H/D exchange experiments.\n27| The collection of spectra for D<sub>2</sub>O buffer solution.",
    "\\(A) For reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution that has no significant differences with the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, reconstitute the lyophilized buffer with 99.99% D<sub>2</sub>O. Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.\n\\(B) For reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution that has significant differences with the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, mix the protein buffer \\(e.g., 20 μL) with appropriate D<sub>2</sub>O buffer \\(e.g., 80 μL) to obtain a final buffer similar to that present in the protein solution in step 30 \\(ii). Fill the cell with reconstituted buffer and collect the spectrum.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The buffer is lyophilized with the related protein and similar to that present in the protein D<sub>2</sub>O solution.\n28| Dismantle and then clean the cell as described in step 24. Assemble the CaF<sub>2</sub> liquid cell as described instep 25.\n29| For the protein spectrum in D<sub>2</sub>O, set the spectral range from 4,000 to 500 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The acquisition type is set to Kinetic before data acquisition. When the acquisition type is Kinetic, the gain is recalculated for each sub-file.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The software is set before reconstitution of the lyophilized protein.",
    "30| Set the initial delay. The initial delay is defined as the delay in seconds before any scans are acquired. The initial delay must be longer than the time from reconstituting the lyophilized protein to the acquisition of the first spectrum \\(<60s). Typically, the initial delay is set to 60s. Set the number of sub-files, which is the number of sub-files to acquire. Set the minimum time interval between sub-files, which is defined as the minimum time in seconds between the start of two consecutive sub-files. Typically, the spectra need to be recorded at 1-min intervals during the first 10 minutes; thus, the number of sub-files is set to 10 and the minimum time interval between sub-files is set to 60s. Set the number of scans, which is the number of scans to be averaged together. Typically, 8 scans are accumulated between 1 and 10 min.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The initial delay is set to 60s because the majority of the amide protons are exchanged so rapidly that their exchange is completed within 60s.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The total acquisition time for obtaining a spectrum was related to the scan number and the time needed for a single scan. The total acquisition time should be the minimum time interval between sub-files \\(e.g., <60s). The total acquisition time for a spectrum= scan number × the time needed for a single scan.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The total acquisition time for all spectra = the total acquisition time for a spectrum+ \\(number of sub-files-1) × minimum time interval. Typically, the total acquisition time should be <10-15min.\n31| Start the collection of the spectrum. Prepare protein in D<sub>2</sub>O solution.",
    "\\(A) For reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution that has no significant differences with the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, reconstitute the lyophilized protein in D<sub>2</sub>O solution. The volume of protein before lyophilization should be the same as the volume after reconstitution.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The lyophilized protein must be suspended gently to avoid the generation of bubbles in the sample.\n\\(B) For reconstituted protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution that has significant differences with the protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution in regards to the secondary structure contents, mixed the protein solution \\(e.g., 20μL) in step 23\\(B) with an appropriate volume of D<sub>2</sub>O\\(e.g.,90μL) to obtain a final protein concentration >3 mg/mL for the H/D exchange experiment.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The recommended fraction of D<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>O is 80:20.\nInject the sample into the cell and put the cell on the holder. All procedures must be completed during the initial delay \\(60 s).\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: Ensure that the sample fills the entire window surface without the presence of bubbles or empty cell areas.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The time from the reconstitution of lyophilized protein to acquisition of the first spectrum is within the time frame of the initial delay.\n32| The spectra are recorded and saved.\n33| Set the initial delay before the next group of sub-files is acquired. Set the number of scans \\(e.g.,16 or 32). Set the minimum time interval between sub-files \\(e.g.,300s). Set the number of sub-files \\(e.g.,10). \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The number of scans, the minimum time interval, and number of sub-files should be set based on the progression of the experiment and the protein dynamics. With progression of the H/D exchange experiment, the minimum time interval between sub-files will be longer and the spectra can be recorded with more scans.",
    "34| Start the collection of the spectrum. The spectra are recorded and saved.\n35| Set the initial time delay before the next group of sub-files is acquired. Set the number of scans \\(e.g., 64 or 128). Set the minimum time interval between sub-files \\(e.g., 600s). Set the number of sub-files \\(e.g., 10). The minimum time interval between sub-files will be longer and the spectra require more scans than the last group of spectra.\n36| Start the collection of the spectrum. \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The kinetic spectra are recorded until the protein is nearly fully deuterated.\n37| For the spectrum of the fully deuterated protein, collect the spectrum of the sample prepared at step 5 in Normal mode.\n■**PAUSE POINT** The data collection can end here. Demount the liquid cell by removing the four machine screws. Wash the CaF<sub>2</sub> window with ethyl alcohol and then with an excess of water. Finally, wipe the windows gently with lens cleaning paper.\n**Data analysis**●TIMING3-6h\n38| Calculate the IR absorbance spectra. After completing all measurements, the software \\(BOMEN GRAMS/32) is used to compute the absorbance spectra. After the computations are done, the results should be saved immediately.\n39| Subtract the reference spectra from the spectra for protein in H<sub>2</sub>O solution. Subtract the reference spectra from the protein spectra to remove water contribution using a double subtraction procedure.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: To determine whether the subtraction of absorption bands due to liquid water and gaseous water in the atmosphere has been successful, a straight baseline between 2000-1750 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be used as a criterion.\n40| Perform the baseline correction as described by Yang et al<sup>23</sup>.",
    "41| Select the regions of interest \\(1800-1500 cm<sup>-1</sup>). The regions of interest in this study include amide I and amide II. The spectral region of 2,000 to 1,300 cm<sup>−1</sup> was obtained for protein in H<sub>2</sub>O.\n42| The type of H/D exchange data acquisition is Kinetic mode and the data is saved as multifiles. A multifile is simply a file with more than one trace \\(sub-file). \nMultifiles should be split into single files. Select untifiles→multifile utilities→split into singles→New file name→Enter NEW base name for single file→subfile number from the Application menu. The sub-files are saved as new single files ranging from the first sub-file number to the last sub-file number.\n43| Subtract the reference spectra from the protein spectra to remove the D<sub>2</sub>O contribution using the double-subtraction procedure described in step 33.\n44| Perform the baseline correction.\n45| Select the regions of interest \\(1800-1500 cm<sup>-1</sup>).\n46| For comparison, the amide I band maximum for protein in H<sub>2</sub>O is normalized to the amide I band maximum for protein in D<sub>2</sub>O \\(χA<sub>I</sub>/A<sub>I\\(H2O)</sub>).\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: After the calculation, the amide I band of the single spectrum should overlap as shown in **Figure 5a**, especially near 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: Air bubbles or an empty area in the cell may cause the spectrum to disperse as shown in **Figure 6a**.\n47| Average the three spectra of protein solution in H<sub>2</sub>O. Compute ω using ω= A<sub>II\\(H2O)</sub>/A<sub>I\\(H2O)</sub>, where A<sub>II</sub> and A<sub>I</sub> are the absorbance maxima for the amide II and amide I bands of protein in H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. ω has been found to be very nearly constant for proteins.",
    "▲**CRITICAL STEP**: AI/AII should be in the range of 1.50-1.80. The value of AI/AII will affect the relative fraction of unexchanged amide proton \\(F). As shown in **Figure 7a**, the A<sub>I</sub>/A<sub>II</sub> ratio is 1.03 \\(a protein FT-IR absorbance spectrum in H<sub>2</sub>O) and 1.52 \\(another protein FT-IR absorbance spectrum in H<sub>2</sub>O). **Figure 7b** shows that the corresponding unexchanged proton \\(F) value does not the same.\n48| AII is the absorbance maxima of the amide II bands of protein in D<sub>2</sub>O. A<sub>II∞</sub> is the amide II absorbance maximum of the fully deuterated protein. The fraction of unexchanged amide proton, F, is calculated at various time intervals using Eq. \\(2).\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: A<sub>II∞</sub> must be obtained from the spectra of the fully deuterated protein.\n49| Plot the fraction of unexchanged amide protons as a function of time.\n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: F will approach zero as the H/D exchange continues.\n50| A two-exponential decay model is used to describe the exchange reaction of the remaining amide protons within the experimental time frame. Fit F versus exchange time plots using Eq. \\(3). \n51| Alternatively, the amount of unexchanged amide protons \\(F) can be determined by integrating the area encompassed by the derivative peak. \n\\(i) The second derivative analysis of the amide II band is performed as described by Yang et al. The second derivative spectra indicate an obvious peak shift from approximately 1549 to 1545 cm<sup>-1</sup> when the exchange time increased.\n\\(ii) Furthermore, the area under the peak decreased with H/D exchange. The fraction of unexchanged amide proton, F, is expressed as:\nF=A<sub>D</sub>/A<sub>H</sub>\nWhere A<sub>D</sub> and A<sub>H</sub> are the area encompassed by the second derivative peak of the amide II band in D<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. In most cases, the fraction of unexchanged amide protons in the first spectrum is < 40%.",
    "To improve the accuracy and precision in determining the amount of exchange, the intensity of the amide I band at the initial time points used to normalize the area of the amide II band at exchange time t=0. \n▲**CRITICAL STEP**: The baseline of the peak should be manipulated using the same method."
