    "The protocol here presented is designed for analysis of three conditions in a single experiment. If a different number of conditions is required, adapt volumes accordingly. A flowchart of the procedures is shown in Figure 1. See General note 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4821/bioprotoc-13-18-4821-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the protocol steps Seed 1 × 106 cells onto a 15 cm dish per condition such that cells are confluent after 24 h Electroporation Note: Carry out all procedures under a laminar flow hood and follow standard tissue culture procedures. Prepare materials for the electroporation.Place medium, trypsin, and HBSS solutions at 37 °C.Place the electroporation tube into the holder in the Neon Electroporation machine.Pipette 3 mL of E2 electrolytic buffer from Neon transfection system kit into the electroporation tube.Prepare 3 × 1.5 mL tubes containing 1 mL of cell medium and keep at 37 °C. These are required later to enable recovery of cells following electroporation.Prepare 3 × 1.5 mL tubes each containing 3–5 μg of plasmid DNA.Prepare 3 × 1.5 mL tubes containing 1 mL of PBS. These are required later to rinse the electroporation pipette tip before moving to the next electroporation condition.Select the transfection program: voltage 1,150 V, width 30 ms, 2 pulses.Attach a gold electroporation tip to the electroporation pipette.Detach cells from 15 cm plates.Remove medium and wash cells in 10 mL of PBS.Remove PBS and add 1.5 μL of warm trypsin.Incubate at 37 °C for 3–5 min and then add 15 mL of warm medium.Transfer cells to a 50 mL Falcon tube.Centrifuge at 200× g for 3 min at room temperature.Wash cells in 10 mL of PBS and centrifuge again at 200× g for 3 min.Remove PBS and wash again in 1 mL of PBS, transferring cells to 1.5 mL tubes.",
    "Centrifuge using MiniSpin at 300× g for 1 min at room temperature.Remove PBS and equilibrate cells in HBSS by resuspending cell pellet in 1 mL of warm HBSS.Centrifuge using MiniSpin at 300× g for 1 min.Resuspend cells in 330 μL of warm HBSS and transfer into appropriate tube with plasmid DNA.Note: Electroporation is performed in three rounds per condition. For this, use 100 μL per electroporation round plus excess to avoid formation of bubbles during pipetting. Caution:  Air bubbles could cause arcing during electroporation.Use the electroporation pipette to transfer cells to the Neon electroporation tube. Perform electroporation. Transfer electroporated cells to 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of warm medium. Gently invert tube and place at 37 °C. Caution:  When pipetting electroporated cells into tube with warm medium, avoid contact between the pipette tip and the medium as this could cause arcing due to presence of FBS in the medium.Repeat step B11 two more times for the same condition.Before moving to the next condition, rinse the electroporation pipette tip in PBS multiple times.Centrifuge electroporated cells using MiniSpin at 300× g for 1 min.Resuspend in 1 mL of warm medium, plate in 10 cm dishes (one dish per condition) with final 10 mL of medium and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.Clean and dispose of electroporation kit components according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Critical:  At sections C–F, strictly follow standard procedures for handling RNA. Treat work surfaces and pipettes with 70% ethanol and RNaseZap. Carry out all procedures on ice and always keep samples and solutions on ice. See General note 2.Cell lysis Prepare solutions.35 mL of PBS + CHX 0.1 mg/mL2.5 mL of lysis buffer1.2 mL of TBS 1×Add CHX at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to electroporated cells and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.",
    "Place plate on ice and wash cells once quickly with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS + CHX 0.1 mg/mL.Scrape quickly in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS + CHX 0.1 mg/mL while keeping plate on ice.Transfer cells into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge using MiniSpin at 300× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cell pellets in 200 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge using MiniSpin at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer 180 μL of supernatants (Input) into new 1.5 mL tubes.Note: Transfer less than 200 μL of supernatant to avoid collection of pelleted material. Make a 10 μL aliquot for RNA isolation. Keep at 4 °C and perform RNA isolation (see section E) at the same time as the eluted RNA (see section D, steps 9–10).Immunoprecipitation Note: Use 40 μL of beads slurry per condition. Beads need to be mixed to achieve a homogenous suspension. Handle beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use a magnetic rack to separate beads from solutions. Transfer 120 μL of beads slurry to a 1.5 mL tube. Remove solution in which beads were stored.Wash beads twice in 600 μL of ice-cold TBS 1×.Note: Gently invert tube 4–5 times to wash beads. Add 750 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer and split equally into 3 × 1.5 mL tubes.Add 170 μL of Input samples to respective tube containing beads.Incubate tubes at 4 °C overnight gently rotating at 10–30 rpm.Prepare solutions.3 mL of wash buffer.600 μL of puromycin elution buffer or 600 μL of 3× Flag peptide elution buffer.Discard supernatants (flowthrough).Wash beads twice with 0.5 mL of ice-cold wash buffer.Note: Gently invert tube 4–5 times to wash beads. Perform elution. See General note 3.",
    "Elution by puromycin: add 200 μL of puromycin elution buffer to each tube containing beads and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min gently rotating at 10–30 rpm. Collect Elution samples and keep on ice for RNA isolation to be performed straight after.orElution by 3× Flag peptide: add 100 μL of 3× Flag peptide elution buffer to each tube containing beads and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min gently rotating at 10–30 rpm. Collect eluates and repeat step. Collect eluates again and pool with previous respective eluates (total volume of elution samples 200 μL). Keep on ice for RNA isolation to be performed straight after.Perform RNA purification as in section E.RNA isolation Isolate RNA using Monarch RNA Cleanup kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These include a step of DNA digestion. Elute in 30 μL of ice-cold nuclease-free H2O.Assess RNA concentration and purity using the NanoDrop.Add EDTA at final concentration between 0.1 and 1 mM to samples.Note: This is optional. However, addition of EDTA may reduce the activity of any contaminating RNases. Make sure that EDTA is compatible with both the RNA isolation method and the reagents for downstream RT-qPCR. Pause Point:  Purified Input and Elution samples can be stored at -80 °C long term.One-step RT-qPCR See General note 4.Thaw RT-qPCR kit components, primers, and purified RNA samples on ice.Prepare a reaction master mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For three conditions, prepare the equivalent of 20 reactions (includes one extra reaction to account for pipetting errors).Note: Quickly vortex and spin all reaction reagents before use. Distribute master mix to 19 wells of a 96-well plate.Distribute each RNA sample to three wells.Add a volume of H2O equivalent to the volume of RNA samples in a single well to the well corresponding to the no-template control reaction.",
    "Critical:  Avoid formation of bubbles while pipetting during steps F3–F4. This might interfere with the amplification reaction.Cover plate with optical adhesive film.Quickly spin the plate to collect drops at the bottom of wells and to remove potential bubbles.Cover plate with darkening foil while setting up RT-qPCR machine.Load plate onto the RT-qPCR machine and start reaction. Perform one-step RT-qPCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions."
