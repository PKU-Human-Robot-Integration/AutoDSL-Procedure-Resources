The protocol requires that hPSCs are at a confluence of 75%–80%. For passaging, hPSCs must be in a single cell suspension. This protocol was adapted from (Lyall et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Meseguer-Ripolles et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/611-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of differentiation processes and treatments required at each timepoint\nWhen hPSCs are at 75%–80% confluence, aspirate media.\nWash each well with 18°C–25°C 1X DPBS (without Ca2+/Mg2+) and then aspirate.\nAdd 1 mL of Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies™) to each well and incubate cells at 37°C/5% CO2, for 5–8 min, to promote dissociation of cells from the growing surface.\nWhilst cells are dissociating, prepare the Laminin-521-coated plates. Carefully aspirate Laminin-521 from the well, without disturbing the coating on the growing surface.\nCritical: Do not allow the Laminin-521 to dry out at any point. If the Laminin-521 pools and exposes a dry plastic growing surface, then coating has not been successful and must be repeated prior to starting the differentiation process.\nImmediately after aspirating, add 1 mL of supplemented mTeSR1™, pre-warmed to 37°C, containing 10 μM Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 to each well of a 6-well plate. This is half of the media that will be added to each well.\nNote: ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 is used to enhance hPSC attachment and survival in single cell suspensions.\nIncubate the LN-521 coated plates, with ROCK-supplemented media, at 37°C/5% CO2 until the hPSCs are dissociated and ready for plating.",
    "To determine whether hPSCs have formed a single cell suspension, observe the plates under a standard light microscope. If the cells are not ready, increase the incubation step, to a maximum of 10 min. Cells will start to look round when their edges are detaching from the growing surface.\nAspirate the Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent and immediately add 1 mL of pre-warmed supplemented mTeSR1™ with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to each well.\nDetach cells from the growing surface using a cell scraper.\nCollect the media, containing suspended hPSCs, into a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min, at 18°C–25°C.\nAspirate the media without disturbing the cell pellet and then tap the tube to ensure that there are no clumps.\nTo the Falcon tube, add 10 mL of supplemented mTeSR1™ with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Slowly pipette up and down to resuspend the cell pellet. Count the cells using an automatic cell counter and use Trypan Blue to exclude dead cells. Count cells three times and calculate the mean number of cells.\nNote: Manual counting is not recommended as it introduces user-to-user variation\nSeed the cells at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells per cm2 growing surface. Seeding density may require optimization for different well sizes or shapes.\nPlace the plate on a flat surface and gently shake the plate up and down, then left to right, for 10 times each.\nIncubate the hPSCs at 37°C/5% CO2 for 24 h before starting the differentiation protocol.\nHepatocyte-like cell differentiation\nTiming: 17 days\nThis protocol describes how to differentiate hPSCs to hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and generates homogeneous populations. This protocol below was previously described (Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "Once hPSCs reach 40% confluence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), normally 1 day after seeding, begin the differentiation process. This timing is variable and it can take between 18 and 24 h for cells to reach 40% confluence if cell counts are not accurate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/611-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 and refresh the media every 24 h for 3 days.\nOn day 3, H9 cells should achieve an endodermal morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Aspirate endoderm differentiation medium and replace with hepatic progenitor differentiation medium. Incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 and refresh the media every 48 h for 5 days.\nOn day 9, H9 cells should achieve a hepatoblast morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Aspirate the hepatic progenitor differentiation medium and replace with hepatocyte maturation medium, supplemented with 10 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor and 20 ng/mL oncostatin M. Incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 and refresh the media every 48 h for 9 days.\nOn day 17, H9 cells should achieve a hepatocyte morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). HLCs are now mature and ready to be used in downstream assays.",
    "To determine that cells are functioning as mature hepatocytes, measure CYP3A4 activity on day 17, using the P450-Glo™ assay (Promega), as per the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.promega.co.uk/products/cell-health-assays/adme-assays/p450-glo-cyp3a4-assay-and-screening-system/?catNum=V9001#protocols[href=https://www.promega.co.uk/products/cell-health-assays/adme-assays/p450-glo-cyp3a4-assay-and-screening-system/?catNum=V9001#protocols]). Results should be normalized to protein content of the well analyzed. Measure protein using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225#/23225[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225#/23225]).\nNote: At days 0, 3, 9 and 17, collect cells to measure mRNA of the pluripotency marker NANOG, and the hepatocyte markers HNF4A and ALB (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This enables the tracking of the changing cell phenotype throughout the differentiation process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/611-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Differentiation process leads to loss of pluripotency and gain of hepatocyte maturation markers\nTemporal expression of pluripotency marker (NANOG) and hepatocyte markers (ALB and HNF4A) during differentiation of hPSCs to HLCs (data are expressed as mean± SD; n = 8).

This protocol was adapted from (Lyall et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nOn day 17 of HLC differentiation, aspirate the hepatocyte maturation media. Replace this with hepatocyte maturation media supplemented with sodium L-lactate (10 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and octanoic acid (2 mM). Incubate the cells at 37°C/5% CO2 for 48 h.\nNote: Following induction of steatosis, cells from a single well can be used for either imaging or mRNA collection, but the same well cannot be used for both purposes.\nFor microscopy analysis of lipid accumulation, aspirate cell media and replace with 4% (weight/volume) paraformaldehyde in DPBS. Incubate at 18°C–25°C for 15 min.\nAspirate the paraformaldehyde and replace with DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 18°C–25°C, to permeabilize the cells.",
    "Stain the cells with 2 μL/10 mL HCS CellMask™ Red, 2 drops/mL NucBlue Live ReadyProbes® Reagent, and 1:1000 BODIPY™ 493/503. Following incubation with these stains, incubate in the dark, at 18°C–25°C, for 30 min.\nFollowing staining, use fluorescence microscopy to assess intracellular lipid accumulation. For this purpose, we used an Operetta CLS High-Content Analysis System.\nTo further confirm lipid accumulation, mRNA of markers for lipid droplets, perilipin 2 (PLIN2), PLIN4 and PLIN5 can be measured.\nTo purify mRNA from HLCs, wash cells twice with DPBS. Incubate the cells with 1 mL QIAzol for 5 min at 18°C–25°C. Then purify mRNA using the Monarch® Total RNA Miniprep Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.neb.uk.com/products/neb-catalogue/nucleic-acid-purification/monarch-lt;sup-gt;-amp;reg;-lt;-sup-gt;-total-rna-miniprep-kit[href=https://www.neb.uk.com/products/neb-catalogue/nucleic-acid-purification/monarch-lt;sup-gt;-amp;reg;-lt;-sup-gt;-total-rna-miniprep-kit]).\nReverse transcribe RNA using the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1907#/AM1907[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AM1907#/AM1907]).\nMeasure mRNA using the Luna® Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (https://international.neb.com/products/m3004-luna-universal-probe-qpcr-master-mix#Protocols,%20Manuals%20&%20Usage[href=https://international.neb.com/products/m3004-luna-universal-probe-qpcr-master-mix#Protocols,%20Manuals%20%26%20Usage]) and the conditions outlined in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_611_1.csv\nNote: Measurements of lipid marker mRNA should be used in tandem with microscopy to give confidence that steatosis is developing in HLCs treated with lactate, pyruvate, and octanoic acid."
