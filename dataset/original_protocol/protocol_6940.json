    "Material preparation Archaeal biomass must be freeze-dried beforehand.Note: As for every lipid extraction procedure, the growth medium may contain a significant amount of lipids unrelated to the cells to be analyzed. To avoid extracting these lipids from the culture medium, it is important to rinse the cells twice with an appropriate isotonic solution prior to freeze-drying. Remove all traces of potential organic contaminants by combusting all glassware, sand, celite, and glass wool at 450°C for 4 h before use. Rinse the glassware with deionized water, acetone, and DCM (in that order). Let it dry before use.Silica gel is pre-extracted with DCM in a Soxhlet apparatus.All reagents and solvents (except Hept) must be high grade, i.e., >99% purity, to reduce the risk of contamination.Note: High purity solvent can also be obtained by distillation if possible. Hept is cleaned from organic contaminants by filtration over a column filled with silica gel.Prepare 100 ml of 1.2 N HCl in MeOH by adding 10 ml of HCl 37% to 90 ml of MeOH.Note: The solution can be stored for several weeks in a capped glass bottle at room temperature. Prepare 100 ml of MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v) by adding 50 ml of DCM into 50 ml of MeOH.Note: The solution can be stored in a capped glass bottle at room temperature for several weeks. Prepare 50 ml of Hept/IPA (99:1, v/v) by adding 0.5 ml of IPA to 49.5 ml of Hept.Note: The solution can be stored for several weeks in a capped glass flask at room temperature. Prepare 1,000 ml of Hept/IPA (95:5, v/v) by adding 50 ml of IPA to 950 of Hept.Note: The solution can be stored for several weeks in a glass bottle at room temperature. Prepare a 1,000-ml glass bottle filled with Hept.",
    "Note: The solution can be stored for several weeks at room temperature. Archaeal cell hydrolysis (Figure 1)Transfer the archaeal cell pellet to a PyrexTM glass tube using a small glass funnel.Use 4 ml of 1.2 N HCl in MeOH to resuspend the archaeal cell pellet and rinse the glass funnel using glass pipettes and a hand pump.Note: The volume at this step may be modified depending on the size of the cell pellet. However, do not fill the PyrexTM tube above half of its total volume. Tightly close the PyrexTM tube with a cap containing a PTFE seal.Note: Double check that the cap is closed to avoid any evaporation that could lead to the destruction of the sample. To avoid any cross-contamination of samples and contamination of the oven in case of leakage, put 5 cm of sand in a glass bottle, place your PyrexTM tubes in the sand, and close the bottle with a stopper.Heat your samples at 110°C for 4 h.Note: This procedure is strong enough to remove most of the archaeal polar head groups without further degrading archaeal lipids, i.e., ether linkages remain unharmed. Take your samples out of the oven and let them cool down to room temperature.Note: At this step, if your tubes were not sealed tightly enough, your sample might have dried out and completely burned (black-brown color of the sample), which might result in the destruction of core lipids. As a quality control of the procedure, check that tubes still contain solvent and that cell pellets are almost completely disrupted and colorless. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4118/bioprotoc-11-16-4118-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Core lipid extraction (Figure 2)Once your sample has cooled down, carefully open the PyrexTM tube.Warning: Due to the gas generated during the heating step, hot gas and liquid may gush out from the tube when opening it. Add 4 ml of DCM into the PyrexTM tube (final MeOH/DCM 1:1, v/v).Note: The volume at this step may be modified depending on the size of the cell pellet. Create a filter by placing glass wool and then celite into a glass funnel. Place the glass funnel onto a 50 ml-round-bottomed flask suited for the rotary evaporator.Transfer the sample onto the filter and filter it through the funnel into the flask to remove the solid particles (i.e., cell debris) from the lipid extract.Rinse the PyrexTM tube twice with 4 ml of MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v) and filter it into the same flask as above.Rinse the filter into the same flask twice with 4 ml of MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4118/bioprotoc-11-16-4118-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Abbreviations: MeOH, methanol; DCM, dichloromethane.Sample preparation for HPLC analysis (Figure 3)Dry the sample under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator set to 40°C.Rinse the flask with MeOH and dry again under reduced pressure to allow for the complete evaporation of the remaining HCl/H2O.Once dried, carefully dissolve the content of the flask with 0.5 ml of Hept/IPA (99:1, v/v) to recover core lipids and transfer into a 2 ml-vial using a glass syringe.Rinse the flask three more times and transfer into the 2 ml-vial.Dry the sample under a steam of N2.Resuspend the sample into 1 ml of Hept/IPA (99:1, v/v) prior to HPLC analysis.Note: The lipid extract can be stored at -20°C for long periods of time (i.e., several years). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4118/bioprotoc-11-16-4118-g003.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Schematic of the workflow for the core lipid extract preparation for HPLC analysis. Circled numbers refer to the steps in the text. Abbreviations: MeOH, methanol; Hept, heptane; IPA, isopropanol.HPLC-MS core lipid separation and analysisNote: This section is based on Tourte et al. (2020), but the nature and volume of solvents can be adjusted to fit the requirements of your chromatographic separation, i.e., nature and size of the column. Start your chromatography instrument.Set the temperature of the column thermostat to 30°C.Empty the trash collectors and fill the vial used for rinsing (Hept/IPA 95:5, v/v).Feed the chromatography manager software with the gradient used for HPLC chromatography.Note: Here, we used the following gradient with A = Hept/IPA (95:5, v/v) and B = Hept, and a flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1: 95% B (5 min isocratic) to 65% B in 30 min (5 min isocratic), then to 0% B in 1 min (10 min isocratic), and back to 95% B in 1 min (5 min isocratic). The total run time per sample is 57 min. Double-check for stable pressure in the system to ensure proper separation. Flush your system if necessary.Start the MS instrument.Feed the MS manager software with the conditions for the MS analysis.Note: Here, we used the following MS conditions: nebulizer pressure, 50 psi; APCI temperature, 420°C; drying temperature, 350°C; drying gas (N2) flow, 5 L min-1; capillary voltage, -2 kV; corona, 4 µA; and scan range m/z, 600-2,200. Double-check that all parameters properly reach the set values.Place the 2 ml-vials containing your samples dissolved in 1 ml of Hept/IPA (99:1, v/v; see Step C6) onto the HPLC autosampler.Fill the chromatography manager software file with your sample information and sequence.Note: The injection volume is set to 10 µl.",
    "To enhance reproducibility, adjust the concentration of your samples (Step C6) rather than change the injection volume. Run your sequence.Note: Run a control sample every 30-40 analyses to check for appropriate separation and intensity. Reproducibility is evaluated by running selected samples in duplicate or triplicate and a reference sample. For instance, as a reference sample, we used a core lipid extract from Pyrococcus furiosus, which contains diphytanyl glycerol diethers (DGD) and multiple isomers of tetraether lipids, i.e., glycerol mono-, di-, and trialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GMGT, GDGT, and GTGT, respectively) with 0 to 4 cyclopentane rings, to assess the performance of the HPLC column. Additionally, run a standard mixture (synthetic archaeal-like lipids can be purchased from Avanti) to assess the relative response factors of the compounds detected. As a standard mixture, we used a solution of DGD/GDGT0 at 2:1 molar ratio which gave a relative response factor of DGD ca. 10 times lower than that of GDGT0 under our analytical conditions (Tourte et al., 2020). Chromatogram and mass spectrum analysisNote: Relatively few examples of archaeal core lipid mass spectra have been published, but identification can be aided by referring to, e.g., Hopmans et al. (2000). Draw the total ion current (TIC) of your analysis using mass spectrum and chromatogram processing software.Major compounds, i.e., the most abundant on the TIC, are tentatively identified based on their mass spectra, fragmentation patterns, retention time in LC, and comparison with published data (where possible). Use an average of several spectra of a given core lipid peak to ensure proper identification (Figure 1).Note: Very few ions besides the protonated adduct of the intact compound are generated by our APCI procedure, and compounds are thus identified based on their protonated masses. To further ascertain the structures of identified core lipids, MS/MS can be performed.",
    "Draw the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) by extracting the masses of all compounds identified (Figure 4). For each compound, select a mass range suited to your MS system.Note: Considering our system, we usually use a mass range of ±0.5. Integrate each peak on your EIC to determine the relative proportion of each core lipid and correct with the response factor of the compounds under your analytical conditions (see Step D11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4118/bioprotoc-11-16-4118-g004.jpgFigure 4. Core lipid analysis of Thermococcus acidaminovorans. Cells were grown under optimal conditions (85°C, pH 9.0, 3.0% NaCl (w/v); Dirmeier et al., 1998). The chromatogram was drawn by extracting the following masses: 653.5, 1302.5, and 1304.5. Inserts show the mass spectrum and the resulting core structure for each colored peak: green, diphytanyl glycerol diether (DGD); blue, glycerol trialkyl glycerol tetraether with no cyclopentane ring (GTGT0); and purple, glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether with no cyclopentane ring (GDGT0). The indicated masses correspond to protonated adducts. Correcting for the response factors observed under our analytical conditions, DGD, GTGT0, and GDGT0 had relative proportions of 46, 1, and 53%, respectively."
