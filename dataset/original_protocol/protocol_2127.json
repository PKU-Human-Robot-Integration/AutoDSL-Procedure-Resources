According to Alzet ® instructions, the pumps are composed of a semipermeable outer membrane, an intermediate osmotic layer, and a flexible reservoir for the solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Due to the high osmotic pressure difference between the osmotic layer and the tissue environment where it is implanted, the water fluxes into the pump through the semipermeable membrane. As the water enters the osmotic layer, it compresses the flexible reservoir, displacing the ASO solution from the pump at a 0.11 μL/h constant rate in the case of 28-days long 100-μL capacity pumps. Also, the pumps have a start-up gradient until the pumps are ready to deliver the solution. To accomplish this period and start the infusion at the time of surgery, all pumps must be primed in vitro prior to implantation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1712-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Components and internal structure of the Alzet osmotic mini-pump\n(A) Components of the mini-pump in a millimetric scale. 1: 100 μL volume mini-pump body (1.5 × 0.6 cm); 2: Flow moderator (1.3 cm) composed of a styrene acrylonitrile flange and a 21-gauge stainless steel tube; 3: 3.7 μL/cm polyvinylchloride catheter tubing; 4: brain infusion cannula composed of a 30-gauge 3-mm stainless steel tube and a polycarbonate flange and pedestal; 5: polycarbonate spacer disc for height adjustment (0.5-mm height).",
    "(B) Internal structure of the mini-pump body, composed by a cellulose ester blend semipermeable outer membrane, a high osmolarity salt osmotic layer, and a thermoplastic hydrocarbon elastomer impermeable drug reservoir. Due to the high osmotic pressure difference between the osmotic layer and the tissue environment where it is implanted, the water fluxes into the pump through the semipermeable membrane. As the water enters the osmotic layer, it compresses the flexible reservoir, displacing the ASO solution from the pump at a 0.11 μL/h constant rate.\nPrepare 100 mL of RNase-free aCSF.\nPlace the following items in a sterilized biosafety cabinet, taking care not to directly touch anything to maintain sterility: osmotic mini-pump, a flow moderator, a catheter, a brain infusion cannula, and a spacer disc from Alzet ® osmotic mini-pump in a biosafety cabinet. In addition, prepare a 1 mL sterile syringe, a scalpel blade, a millimetric ruler, and a rubber band.\nPut the ASO working solution on ice and let it slowly thaw.\nAdd three drops of cyanoacrylate adhesive (e.g., Loctite ®) to the brain infusion cannula pedestal and insert into one spacer disc. Place the cannula in the cabinet and wait until the adhesive is fully dry.\nCut a catheter into 1.5 mm segments.\nPush the flow moderator cap until it has a third of the tube in front of it.\nConnect the catheter with the flow moderator and the brain infusion cannula and spread a drop of adhesive around each junction to prevent leakage. Wait until the adhesive is fully dry.\nAttach the filling needle to the syringe and load it with ASO solution.\nCritical: do not start the loading of osmotic mini-pumps until all are ready to avoid keeping the ASO at room temperature.",
    "Fill the flow moderator and catheter with ASO solution or vehicle (aCSF) until a drop of the liquid comes out of the brain infusion cannula.\nSlowly fill the osmotic mini-pump with the ASO solution or vehicle (aCSF). Observe the pump shadow to control the level of the solution and stop filling when a drop comes out of the pump.\nCritical: avoid the formation of bubbles in the pump and catheter that will impede the flow of the solution.\nCarefully insert the flow moderator into the pump.\nTie all filled osmotic mini-pumps with the rubber band and attach them into a 100 mL beaker. This will avoid any mixing of the ASO and the saline solutions.\nFill the beaker with 0.9% saline until all the bodies of the osmotic mini-pumps are submerged. Incubate the pumps at 37°C for 24 h to initiate ASO delivery.\nNote: priming time could differ depending on the duration of the osmotic mini-pump. Refer to the corresponding Alzet ® instructions to adjust the incubation time.\nPart two: Stereotaxic surgery\nTiming: 90 min / mouse\nThis section details how to prepare mice and perform the stereotaxic surgery procedure. The entire process will consist of the injection of the AAV solution into mouse SNc/VTA, followed by the implantation of the osmotic mini-pump and the guide cannula for the microdialysis probe. The double implant will be fixed to the mouse skull with anchor micro-screws attached to the skull and dental cement to attach each piece.\nPhase 1: Animal preparation\nTiming: 5–10 min\nPrepare the isoflurane vaporizing system with 0.8 L/min O2 and open the induction box circuit with 3% isoflurane flow.\nAnesthetize the mouse by placing it in the induction box.\nAlternatives: mice can be anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (25 mg/kg) or another long-lasting anesthetic solution.",
    "Wait until the mouse is fully anesthetized. Inject buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously to alleviate pain,\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad to avoid dropping body temperature during the surgery, shave the head hair and sanitize the head skin with 70% ethanol.\nFix the mouse head in the stereotaxic system by inserting the ear bars into the mouse’s ear canals.\nCritical: ensure that the mouse is fully fixed before starting the surgery to avoid it from moving while in the frame. Check that the graduation marks of both ear bars coincide and that both eyes are parallel to the bars. If the animal is properly positioned, a gentle movement of the nose should not alter the position nor loosen the head.\nHook the front teeth into the adapter clamp and adjust the position of the adapter away from the mouse until you feel resistance.\nExchange the flux circuit towards the anesthesia vaporizing mask and reduce the isoflurane concentration to a maintenance dose (1.5%).\nGently approximate the anesthesia vaporizing mask to the mouse nose and check its sedation state by loss of pedal reflex.\nNote: if the mouse wakes up before this step, place it back in the induction box.\nPhase 2: Skull exposure and drilling\nTiming: 15 min\nOnce mouse is fixed and fully anesthetized, apply an ocular lubricant to the eyes to prevent dryness.\nMake an anterior-posterior incision in the head skin using a sterile scalpel, using sufficient pressure to cut through the skin but not into the skull.\nNote: the incision should be large enough to access the skull until the occipital bone is visible.\nPinch both sides of the skin with bulldog clamps and open them to obtain a wider view of the skull.",
    "Prior to starting the AAV administration procedure, very carefully insert the hemostatic forceps or a blunt surgical scissor into the mouse body and slightly open and close the jaws to create a subcutaneous pocket next to the scapula, where the osmotic mini-pump will be placed.\nNote: the osmotic mini-pump should be placed parallel to the brain and the spinal cord. The pocket should be at least 1 cm longer than the pump, but not too large as the pump could move to the side of the animal.\nGently remove the connective tissue with the scalpel and clean the skull surface with a sterile cotton swab. Wait a few minutes to ensure drying of the skull and to see the cranial sutures.\nLevel the mouse head to obtain a right coordinate reference:\nMove the syringe pump attached to the Hamilton syringe to place the needle tip to the bregma and annotate the dorsoventral coordinate.\nRepeat the process at the lambda point.\nReposition the dial of the anterior stereotaxic clamp to adjust the z-coordinate until the dorsoventral coordinate is equal at the bregma and lambda points.\nMove the needle tip to the bregma and write down the anteroposterior and mediolateral coordinates.\nFind the coordinates of the target areas based on the atlas of the mouse brain (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), using bregma as the zero point (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C–3F):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1712-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Injection and implantation coordinates in the stereotaxic surgery procedure",
    "(A) Perforation sites in the mouse skull (steps 32 and 33), indicating the site of AAV injection in SNc/VTA (red), the site of implantation of the osmotic minipump brain infusion cannula in the ventricle side (green) and cannula microdialysis guide in striatum (purple). The three additional gray dots correspond to the suggested locations for the anchor screws.\n(B) Site of the implants and anchor screws after surgery. After the application of the dental cement, only the upper part of the guide cannula will be visible outside the implant structure, while the brain infusion cannula and the anchor screws must be completely covered by the cement. Scale bar: 5 mm.\n(C–E) Nissl (left) and anatomical annotations (right) from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and Allen Reference Atlas – Mouse Brain (Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2004, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; ), respectively showing the specific site for AAV injection into SNc/VTA (C, step 39), the specific site of the osmotic minipump catheter implanted in the lateral ventricle (D, step 52), and the microdialysis guide cannula implant site in the striatum (E, step 59). The neurotransmitter exchange membrane is 2 mm.\n(F) Representative diagram showing the location of the cranial implants and the osmotic minipump inside the scapular subcutaneous pocket, connected by the minipump catheter.\nSNc/VTA: –2.9 mm posterior; –1.3 mm lateral to bregma; –4.25 mm ventral from skull.\nLateral ventricle: –0.34 mm posterior; +1.0 mm lateral to bregma; –2.2 mm ventral from skull.\nStriatum: +0.5 mm anterior; –2.4 mm lateral to bregma; –2.8 mm ventral from skull.\nLift the syringe at each point and mark the target sites with a fine waterproof marker, which will serve as puncture sites.",
    "Note: depending on the mouse strain, body weight and age, coordinates may change and often need to be adjusted. We recommend administering several dye injections in the target brain areas and confirming the accuracy of the stereotaxis coordinates before starting the AAV administration.\nNote: considering unilateral infusion surgery, in order to have enough space for both the guide cannula and the osmotic mini-pump, make sure to place the AAV infusion and guide cannula sites in the same hemisphere and the osmotic mini-pump brain infusion cannula on the opposite side.\nLift the syringe on the vertical axis and move the tip to a security position.\nMark three additional points where three anchor screws will be implanted, equidistant from the osmotic mini-pump point.\nCritical: to allow each implant to take place in the mouse skull, ensure that the screws are at least 1.5 mm away from the osmotic mini-pump brain infusion cannula, and with sufficient distance from the guide cannula site. To ensure maximum fixation, make sure that the three screws are located in different skull bones.\nDrill three small shallow holes (for SNc/VTA, lateral ventricle and striatum, respectively) by using the dental drill at the marked sites on the skull, applying gentle downward pressure while drilling (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCritical: at target sites of interest, stop immediately once the drill stoke has passed through the skull, so as not to puncture the brain and avoid tissue damage. Some bleeding may occur if the dura or parenchyma are damaged; in that case, use a cotton swab to clean the blood.\nPartially drill the three anchor screw sites, without drilling completely through the skull, by placing the dental drill more parallel to the skull. This will allow a better fixation of the screw and prevent the implants from loosening.\nPhase 3: AAV injection",
    "Timing: 20–25 min\nTake an aliquot of AAV working solution and place it on ice to prevent severe thawing.\nBring the needle back to the bregma point and recalculate the coordinates for AAV injection.\nBring the needle to the calculated position and lower it into the hole, until the needle tip is just at the level of the skull. Use this point as the zero for the depth coordinate.\nNote: if the needle tip does not penetrate through the hole, drill again to be sure there are no debris of the skull or dura mater.\nLift the syringe and clean the needle of the microinjection syringe with RNase-free water. Check for clogging. Withdraw automatically 1 μL of the AAV working solution.\nLower the syringe as slowly as possible to reach the SNc/VTA.\nInject 1 μL of AAV solution at a rate of 0.15 μL/min. After completing the infusion, wait an additional 10 min to ensure complete infusion of AAV solution.\nNote: to avoid ocular damage to the mouse while infusing, turn off the arm light in the meantime.\nConfirm that the syringe volume has been delivered. Draw the syringe as slowly as possible to avoid backflow of solution along the needle track.\nLift the syringe and rinse the needle tip with RNase-free water. If there is blood residue, use sterile cotton swabs to remove it and re-rinse the needle.\nRemove the syringe from the syringe pump and place it in a safe, sterile box.\nRemove the syringe pump arm from the stereotaxic frame and place it in a safe place. Replace it with the arm equipped with the osmotic mini-pump brain infusion cannula holder.\nPhase 4: Osmotic mini-pump implantation\nTiming: 20–25 min\nUncap the primed osmotic mini-pumps and place them in a Petri dish filled with sterile saline solution (0.9%).",
    "Hold an anchor screw with needle-pointed forceps and place it over one of the screw marks. Using a micro-screwdriver, apply gentle pressure towards the skull while turning it. The anchor screw should enter firmly into the skull.\nInsert the screw until there is less than 1 mm between its head and the skull surface. Check the screw fixation by touching it carefully on one side.\nCritical: do not insert the screw completely. This will allow dental cement to flow between the skull surface and the screw head, which will provide a stronger implant fixation. If the screw hole is too wide, the screw will feel loose when touched, or will fall directly into the hole without screw-driving it in; in that case, the implants risk moving or falling out during the post-operatory time, so drill another narrower hole for the screw and discard the large one.\nRepeat steps 45 and 46 for the remaining two anchor screws.\nNote: the distance between the screw holes and the osmotic mini-pump brain infusion cannula should be large enough for implantation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), but it is recommended to fix the anchor screws pointing obliquely away from the center of the skull and not completely vertical.\nPlace a primed osmotic mini-pump into the cannula holder by the removable tab and adjust the fixation, with the pump pointing toward the mouse body.\nPlace the brain infusion cannula over the drilled hole and very carefully insert the pump into the subcutaneous pocket of the mouse body, leaving the catheter and the cannula out.\nLower the cannula until the needle is just level with the skull. Use this as the dorsoventral coordinate zero point.\nLift the cannula and carefully add several drops of cyanoacrylate adhesive around the hole.",
    "Note: make sure that the adhesive does not cover the hole or adhere to the tip of the cannula needle to prevent clogging. It is recommended to use a 10 μL micropipette tip to apply the adhesive more precisely.\nInsert the brain infusion cannula carefully and slowly until the appropriate depth is reached.\nNote: If necessary, apply more adhesive around the contact area between the cannula pedestal and the skull.\nHold the cannula in position for 5 min until the cyanoacrylate is completely dry and the cannula is fixed.\nNote: make sure that the adhesive is completely dry before proceeding. The following steps will require dental cement which may interfere with the cyanoacrylate if it is still wet.\nLoosen the cannula holder grip and lift it up.\nHeat a scalpel for several seconds and carefully cut the cannula holder. The plastic composition will melt in contact with the scalpel, so make the cut in one movement to avoid the cooling of metal and plastic.\nIf necessary, close the caudal part of the skin incision with grips or absorbable sutures, avoiding contact with the pump catheter.\nPhase 5: Microdialysis guide cannula implantation and post-operative care\nTiming: 20–25 min\nAttach a guide cannula to the clip equipped on the other stereotaxic arm.\nPlace the cannula over the last drilled hole and lower it until the cannula tip is just in contact with the skull. Use this as the zero point of the dorsoventral coordinate.\nCarefully and slowly insert the cannula until determined depth is reached.",
    "Note: keep in mind that, after replacing the dummy, the probe will exceed the depth of the cannula. Therefore, the implantation depth of the guide cannula should be calculated by subtracting the length of the probe membrane (See part three: microdialysis probe implantation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]) and the desired depth of the probe. In our case, the dorsoventral coordinate for implanting the guide cannula was -2.8 mm, whereas for the microdialysis probe it was -4.8 mm, indicating that the dialysis membrane for neurotransmitter exchange is 2-mm long.\nMix the dental cement powder with the acrylic solvent in a Petri dish or an equivalent resistant container.\nWhen the mixture is partially fluid, carefully apply it to the skull, making sure that it makes contact with all implants and the screws are still partially visible.\nAllow the cement to dry for 10 min, checking by touching the cement with a needle.\nNote: avoid letting the mixture leak into the subcutaneous pocket. If necessary, touch the closed skin to make it contact with the caudal region of the skull. The fluidity of the mixture will allow the cement to flow below the screw heads.\nWhen the cement is dry, release the cannula clip and lift the stereotaxic arm.\nRelease the skin from the bulldog clamps.\nRemix the dental cement components until a slightly less fluid mixture than in step 61 is obtained.\nApply a second layer of cement over the implants until all components are covered, except for the guide cannula, which should be covered until the lower half of the cannula body.\nCritical: All skin around the implants should be in contact with the cement to prevent the reopening of the incision. If necessary, repeat from step 65.\nAllow the cement to dry completely.",
    "Gently remove the ear bars from the stereotaxic frame, remove the anesthetic mask, and take the mouse from the instruments.\nIf suturing was necessary in the caudal part of the incision, apply appropriate antiseptic treatment over it.\nIndividualize the mouse in a new clean cage and keep it on a heating pad.\nMonitor the mouse until it wakes up and moves on its own.\nNote: cement implantation and subcutaneous insertion of the pump may generate pain in mice, so once the animal has recovered, provide buprenorphine or other analgesic treatment as indicated by the institutional guidelines. The mini-pump implant may make it difficult for mice to freely access water and food, so provide them at the bottom of the cage along with environmental enrichment.\nNote: the recovery time after surgery should not be less than 72 h before proceeding to the next part of the protocol.\nPart three: Microdialysis probe implantation\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the preparation of the microdialysis probes and their implantation in the mice cannulas the day before the microdialysis experiment. The probes should be rinsed before use and then exchanged by the dummy, which avoids clogging around the guide cannula. In this example, CMA7 6 kDa microdialysis probes will be used.\nImmerse the tube adaptors in 70% ethanol for 15 min.\nFill one syringe with aCSF and one with deionized water and mount them in a microdialysis pump.\nPrepare the microdialysis probe.\nMount the probe in a holder clip and place it in a vial filled with aCSF.\nAttach a tubing adapter and FEP tubing to the blue tubing of the microdialysis probe and connect it to the syringe cannula.",
    "Flush the probe with ethanol at 10 μL/min flow to wash out the air inside the probe. If bubbles remain, gently tap the clip holding the probe.\nAdjust the pump to the required perfusion flow rate (See part four: microdialysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]) and check for leaks.\nConnect the FEP tubing to the water syringe and flush the probe again.\nCritical: do not touch the probe membrane during the process. If it receives any hit and/or leaks are detected, discard the probe.\nNote: while preparing all the necessary probes, place the ready probes in a vial filled with deionized water.\nPrepare the isoflurane vaporizing system with 0.8 L/min O2 and open the induction box circuit with a 3% isoflurane flow.\nAttach a primed probe to the aCSF syringe on the microdialysis pump and set it at a rate of 10 μL/min. This flow pressure will allow the membrane to stand straighter and prevent bending.\nAnesthetize the implanted mouse by placing it in the induction box. Wait until the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nPlace the mouse on a firm surface and carefully hold its head.\nRemove the dummy from the cannula guide and carefully insert the microdialysis probe until the main body of the probe is completely inside the cannula body.\nPlace the mouse in the microdialysis cage and allow it to wake up from anesthesia. After implantation of the microdialysis probes, the mice should be allowed to rest overnight (12–16 h).\nNote: if the mouse recovers from anesthesia before probe insertion, place the mouse back in the induction box.",
    "Note: the microdialysis cage can be a regular standard mice cage and should be large enough for the mouse to freely move. It must have attached a support for the balance arm (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In this case, we use a 20 × 20 × 20 cm methacrylate box open at the top.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1712-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Components and setup of the microdialysis system\n(A) Components of the microdialysis set-up system in a millimetric scale. 1: transparent fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing with the syringe connector attached; 2: red FEP tubing; 3: 22-gauge single channel plastic swivel with an attachment for the collecting vial; 4: multi-axis counter-balanced lever arm; 5: 300-μL polypropylene collecting vial; 6: blue tubing adapters for connecting FEP tubing; 7: 1-mL sterile syringe of 4.70 mm inner diameter.\n(B) Assembled microdialysis set-up with a 20 × 20 × 20 cm methacrylate box for mice placement and a syringe pump. Arrows indicate the direction of the perfusate flow: 1, from the syringe to the swivel (red arrows); 2, from the swivel to the implanted microdialysis probe (blue arrow); 3, from the microdialysis probe to the collecting vial attached to the swivel (green arrow).\nPart four: Microdialysis\nTiming: 6–8 h\nThis section details how to perform the in vivo microdialysis experiment on freely moving mice. During the experiments, a physiological solution is perfused at a constant flow rate by a microdialysis pump through the inner tube of the probe to its distal end, reaching the exposed semipermeable membrane located in the brain area of study. Low molecular weight substances (less than 6 kDa), such as neurotransmitters, diffuse from the outside to the inside of the probe according to a concentration gradient.\nPrepare the solutions for perfusion.\nPrepare artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1% DMSO as basal perfusate.",
    "Prepare the veratridine working solution:\nTo prepare the stock solution, dissolve the veratridine powder in DMSO at 5 mM. For safe storage, the stock solution should be kept at −20°C.\nDilute the stock solution in aCSF to obtain 50 μM veratridine perfusate. This perfusate will have the same concentration of DMSO as the basal perfusate.\nNote: ensure that both basal perfusate and veratridine-containing perfusate have the same final concentration of DMSO (1%).\nPrepare the perfusate collection vials by adding 5 μL of concentrated perchloric acid (HClO4 10 mM) in each vial, which prevents oxidation of DA in the dialysate.\nNote: the collecting vials should be filled with HClO4 up to a maximum of one day before starting the microdialysis experiment to avoid evaporation.\nSet up the microdialysis room and system (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B):\nTo allow for proper adaptation of the mice, turn on the room light 1 h before the start of the experiment.\nPrepare the system to allow the animals to move freely. Attach the balance arm to the cage and mount the swivel on it. The swivel arm has a holder for holding the plastic vials.\nPurge the tubing system and connect the probes to the pump.\nFill the sterile syringes with aCSF + 1% DMSO and tap them gently to remove all air bubbles. Place them in the pump.\nConnect the inflow line from the syringe to the swivel using the FEP tubing and tubing adaptors.\nTo ensure good perfusate flow, set the pump to a rate of 100 μL/min and perfuse aCSF + 1% DMSO through the system before connecting it to the dialysis probes, to be sure that there is no air in the entire system.",
    "Change the flow rate to 10 μL/min and attach the FEP tubing to the probe inlet tubing. Wait until the perfusate flows freely out of the probe outlet tubing.\nConnect the outlet tubing to the probe outlet and place the end of the tubing into the vial to collect perfusate fractions.\nCritical: check that the inlet and outlet tubing is protected against kinking, as well as to prevent it from being chewed by mice. Before connecting the entire dialysis circuit, make sure that the perfusate comes out normally and the probes are not obstructed.\nChange the flow rate to 1.5 μL/min. Check that the volume of dialysate collected is as expected.\nNote: the flow rate of 1.5 μL/min is adjusted for a syringe of 1 mL capacity and 4.70 mm inner diameter. In case of using another type of syringe (different volume and/or internal diameter), the infusion rate should be corrected in order to provide the adequate volume of dialysate for subsequent analysis in HPLC system (in our study it is 30 μL/20 min).\nStabilize the mice in the established conditions for 1 h before starting the collection of the dialysate fractions, to ensure an adequate exchange of neurotransmitters across the membrane.\nCollect the perfusate samples in vials containing perchloric acid in 20 min fractions. Keep the collected vials at −20°C. The six initial samples obtained are used to establish basal DA concentrations.\nNote: depending on the experimental design, the number of fractions and the collecting time can be modified.\nChange the perfusate solution. This step begins when the sixth sample has been collected.\nPrepare new syringes filled with veratridine 50 μM solution.\nPlace a discard vial to the vial holder, disconnect the inlet tubing from the swivel, and place the new syringes in the pump.",
    "Set the pump at a rate of 100 μL/min and perfuse veratridine solution through the system until there is no air in the tubing system.\nNote: The required time perfusing at 100 μL/min depends on the dead volume of the tubing, which is determined by the length of the tubes.\nChange the flow rate to 1.5 μL/min and connect the inlet tubing to the swivel. Wait 5 min to ensure that no aCSF solution remains in the tubing.\nPlace a new vial in the holder and collect the dialysate sample after infusing veratridine for 20 min.\nAfter collecting the dialysate corresponding to the veratridine treatment, repeat step 85 using syringes filled with aCSF to collect eight more basal samples.\nPause point: if necessary, perfusate samples can be stored at −20°C for 24 h.\nAfter collecting the last fraction, disconnect the dialysis system and flush sequentially with deionized water, 70% ethanol, and air.\nAt the end of the microdialysis experiment, euthanize the animals and remove their brains for verification of the implantation of the microdialysis probes.\nPart five: Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis section describes how to measure the DA and DOPAC levels in the collected dialysate fractions by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrochemical detection (EC). The procedure described here uses HPLC equipment consisting of a Waters 515 isocratic pump, a Waters 717plus HPLC auto-sampler, a 2.6 μm particle size (7.5 × 0.46 cm) C18 column, a Waters 2465 electrochemical detector (+0.7 V), and a Waters IN-Line AF degasser. The equipment is connected to an interface that transmits the collected signal to a computer, where it is converted into a chromatographic profile using Total-Chrome software.\nPrepare 2 L of mobile phase for the HPLC system.",
    "Allow the mobile phase to flow during 14–16 h through the chromatographic circuit. The mobile phase flows through the degasser to purge any air bubble or solubilized air.\nConnect the mobile phase inlet lines to the HPLC/EC system and set the flow rate at 0.8 mL/min with an internal column pressure of 2000–2200 psi. Set the oxidation-reduction potential of the electrode to +0.7 V.\nNote: using these conditions, the chromatographic retention time of DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) is 2.5–2.8 min and 3.0–3.2 min, respectively. The detection limit for DA is approximately 3 fmol.\nPrepare the standard solutions of DA and DOPAC at different concentrations. This will require a serial dilution in order to obtain an adequate calibration curve for determining the DA and DOPAC levels in perfusates (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1712-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparation of the DA and DOPAC standard solution for the HPLC-ED calibration curve\n(A) Serial dilution of DA hydrochloride in aCSF + HClO4 10 mM to obtain a 4.49 fmol/μL working solution.\n(B) Serial dilution of DOPAC in aCSF + HClO4 10 mM to obtain a 9.89 fmol/μL working solution.\n(C) Mix of DA and DOPAC working solutions to obtain the standard solution, which will be injected into the HPLC-ED system for the generation of the calibration curve.\nPrepare 100 mL of aCSF with HClO4 10 mM for the serial dilutions.\nWeight 1.13 mg of DA hydrochloride and dissolve it in 9.5 mL methanol + 500 μL HClO4 10 mM [solution 1.1].\nNote: the actual DA and DOPAC weight must be corrected according to manufacturer’s commercial formulation of the compound and/or purity. In this case, the subtraction of the hydrochloride molecular weight will correspond to a 0.81× correction factor for DA, and the 98% purity of DOPAC will correspond to a 0.98× correction factor.",
    "Dilute serially solution 1.1 until reaching the working solution adequate concentration:\nAdd 20 μL of solution 1.1 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [solution 1.2].\nAdd 20 μL of solution 1.2 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [solution 1.3].\nAdd 20 μL of solution 1.3 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [DA working solution, W.S.].\nWeight 2.25 mg of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and dissolve it in 9.5 mL methanol + 500 μL HClO4 10 mM [solution 2.1].\nDilute serially solution 2.1 until reaching the working solution adequate concentration:\nAdd 20 μL of solution 2.1 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [solution 2.2].\nAdd 20 μL of solution 2.2 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [solution 2.3].\nAdd 20 μL of solution 2.3 into 1 mL aCSF+HClO4 [DOPAC working solution, W.S.].\nMix 500 μL of DA and 500 μL of DOPAC working solutions for getting the standard solution.
