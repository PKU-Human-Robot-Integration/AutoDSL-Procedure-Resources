    "1. DMD Setup\nThe DMD board, UV light guide (with collimator) and 4x objective lens are all mounted vertically on a vibration isolation table.\nThe UV light guide should be adjusted so that the light hits the mirror array at an angle of 45° relative to the plane of the mirrors, and 24° below the plane of the mirrors (Figure 1).\nThe objective lens is mounted so that the distance from the DMD to the objective lens corresponds to the focal length associated with the lens.\nAn inverted microscope is placed below the objective lens, such that the focused light reflected from the DMD can be visualized through the microscope. The distance from the objective lens to the polymerization surface should approximately correspond to the working distance of the lens. The stage on the microscope can then be used to adjust this distance to finely focus the image. This distance may vary depending on the chosen polymerization surface.\n2.  Dual Hydrogel Constructs for Tissue Explant Cultures\nA. DRG explant adhesion\nCoat the walls of 6-well collagen coated cell culture inserts (Corning) with Rain-X, taking care to avoid the membrane itself.  (Alternatively, a hydrophobic barrier pen may be used.)\nHydrate inserts overnight with 1.5 mL of adhesion medium in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Adhesion medium is neurobasal medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5mM L-glutamine, and 20 μg/mL NGF.\nHarvest embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from E-15 rat pups. DRG should be plated onto collagen coated 6-well inserts, as many as four per insert.\nIncubate inserts for 2 hours to allow for DRG adherence to the membrane.\nB. Dynamic mask photopolymerization",
    "A digital micromirror device (DMD) is a 1024 x 768 array of individual mirrors, similar to that in projection televisions, which selectively reflects light based on mirror position. For our purposes, the DMD is used to pattern ultraviolet (UV) light onto photocrosslinkable hydrogels, creating specifiable hydrogel geometries in a simple and rapid manner. Figure 1 depicts the setup of the DMD and UV light path. Though our DMD is a standalone unit, the device can also be integrated for use with many existing microscopes.\nRemove all excess liquid from insert, and add 500 μL of polymerization medium inside the insert. Polymerization medium contains 10% PEG (MW 1000) and 0.5% Irgacure 2959 dissolved in neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 μg/mL NGF and 1% Pen/Strep.\nPlace the insert underneath the DMD device on a Rain-X treated glass slide.\nLoad the appropriate black and white image to be used as a \"photomask\" on the DMD, through the use of the included ALP-3 basic GUI program. For our purposes, a bifurcating shape was chosen to allow for implementation of neurite guidance systems.\nUsing an inverted microscope for visualization, align the tissue explants with the appropriate location on the photomask using a visible light source reflecting off the DMD.\nSwitch the visible light source for the UV light source, and illuminate the PEG solution until crosslinking is sufficient. (For the conditions given and 5.0 Watts/cm2 incident on the DMD, crosslinking can be completed in as little as 55 seconds.) Repeat for all four DRG on the insert.\nWash each insert three times with sterile DPBS and 1% Pen-Strep.\nAdd 1.5mL growth medium underneath the cell culture inserts, and allow to equilibrate in an incubator for 30 minutes. Growth medium is neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27, 1% Pen/Strep, 0.5mM L-glutamine, and 20 μg/mL NGF.",
    "C. Secondary hydrogel\nPuramatrix\nFor neuronal applications, 1% Puramatrix is diluted according to manufacturer's instructions to 0.15% in sterile H2O and supplemented with 1 μg/mL soluble laminin.\nAll excess media must be removed from the PEG voids, which contain the DRG explants, using a sterile cotton tip applicator, Kimwipe, or micropipette.\nPuramatrix is added to the PEG voids with a micropipette in order to fill the empty space without overflowing. Depending on void volume, typically ~ 1 μL is used per construct.\nPuramatrix begins the process of self-assembly immediately upon contact with a physiological salt solution, i.e. the swollen PEG, but 1.5 mL of growth medium is added underneath the insert and placed in the incubator for one hour to ensure total gelation.\nInitially, Puramatrix is slightly acidic, so change the media after one hour to allow the pH to equilibrate.\nMedia changes are required approximately every 48 hours. Be careful that all media is added underneath the insert, to protect the integrity of mechanically weak Puramatrix.\nAgarose\nFor neuronal applications, agarose is diluted to a 1% solution in growth medium and placed in a 60 °C water bath until the agarose fully dissolves (~1 hr). The solution is then supplemented with 1 μg/mL soluble laminin.\nAll excess media must be removed from the PEG voids.\nAgarose is added to the PEG voids in order to fill the empty space without overflowing. Depending on volume of void, typically ~ 1 μL is used per construct.\n1.5 mL of growth medium is pre-chilled (8 °C) in a 6-well plate, and the agarose containing inserts are transferred to the chilled media and maintained in a refrigerator at 8 °C for at least three minutes to allow agarose to gel.",
    "Finally, the inserts are transferred to 1.5 mL of pre-warmed growth medium (37 °C) and maintained in the incubator at 37 °C, with media changes required every 48 hours.\n3.  Dual Hydrogel 3D Cell Encapsulation\nDual hydrogel encapsulation is appropriate when using any self-assembling gel. The photocrosslinkable gel, in this case PEG, serves as a structural support for the geometric presentation of the self-assembling gel, for example Puramatrix or agarose. Some of the methods, specifically the type of gel and choice of photomask, will depend on the particular desired application.\nLoad an appropriate mask on the DMD. For our application, cell survival, we simply chose a cylindrical presentation of Puramatrix to aid in the imaging of cells. Researchers studying cell signaling might be interested in a compartmental geometry to allow for the diffusion of chemotactic molecules. Additionally, a rough approximation of an artery was shown to represent possible application to blood vessel research.\nTreat the walls of a polyester cell culture insert with Rain-X, and place under DMD on Rain-X coated slide.\nAdd 500 μL of polymerization medium to the insert. Induce PEG crosslinking by exposure to UV light for 55 seconds.\nWash three times with sterile DPBS and 1% Pen-Strep.\nRemove all excess media from the PEG voids.\nSpin down cells at the desired density into a pellet. Care must be taken to remove all medium from the cell pellet prior to mixing, as Puramatrix begins self-assembly immediately upon contact with a salt solution.  Suspend the cells inside 0.15% Puramatrix diluted in sterile H2O supplemented with 10% sucrose.\nInject the Puramatrix/cell/sucrose mixture inside voids in PEG.\nAdd 1.5 mL of growth medium underneath the insert, and allow to gel inside incubator for one hour.\nChange media after one hour, and ~every 48 hours thereafter.",
    "4.  Single Hydrogel 3D Cell Encapsulation\nA single hydrogel encapsulation would be appropriate for any situation where the cells can be examined inside of a photocrosslinkable hydrogel.\nLoad an appropriate mask on the DMD. For cell survival studies, we again chose a basic circular mask to represent a cylinder. Masks similar to those shown in method 4 could again be applied for the appropriate research field.\nTreat a polyester cell culture insert with Rain-X, and place under DMD on Rain-X coated slide.\nCells at any desired concentration can be added directly to the 10% PEG solution, mixing well to ensure homogenous distribution.\nAdd 500 μL of polymerization medium to the insert. Induce PEG crosslinking by exposure to UV light for 55 seconds.\nWash three times with sterile DPBS and 1% Pen-Strep.\nFill with growth medium both below and on top of the insert, changing every ~2 days.\n5.  Thin Film Hydrogel Polymerization\nLoad an appropriate mask on the DMD.\nTreat a collagen-coated polyester cell culture insert with Rain-X, and place on Rain-X coated slide.\nAdd sufficient polymerization medium to just cover the bottom of the insert (~250-300 μL for 6-well plate inserts).  Allow the media to permeate the insert membrane for 30-45 minutes at room temperature.\nRemove excess polymerization medium from the insert with a micropipette or Kimwipe.  Add a sufficient amount of UV-transparent oil to completely cover the bottom of the insert.  Allow the insert to sit for 15-30 minutes at room temperature, long enough for the oil to form a distinct layer above the polymerization medium saturating the insert membrane.",
    "Place the insert and slide under the DMD.  Induce PEG crosslinking by exposure to UV light.  Because of the thinness of the PEG layer, crosslinking can be completed in as little as 15 seconds at 5.0 Watts/cm2 incident on the DMD.\nWash the insert three times with sterile DPBS and 1% Pen-Strep.  (If the persistence of an oily residue is a concern, a mild detergent such as Tween 20 (1%) may be added to the wash buffer.)\nStore the insert in a 6-well tissue culture plate.  Add growth medium to suspended cells, in the desired concentration, and pipette a sufficient volume of the cell suspension inside the cell culture insert to obtain the desired cell density. Then, add enough growth medium below the insert to completely maintain cell viability (~1.5 mL).\nAfter 48 hours have elapsed, wash the insert three times with sterile DPBS and 1% Pen-Strep to dislodge any unadhered cells.  Change media approximately once every 48 hours.\n6. Representative Results",
    "Examples of dual hydrogel constructs containing DRG explants are shown in Figure 2. Notice that cellular migration and neurite extension is limited to the cell permissive region of the dual hydrogel construct. Figure 3 depicts dissociated cells encapsulated similarly inside the dual hydrogel constructs. Due to the dynamic nature of the DMD photomask, the geometry available for encapsulation is limited only by the dimensions and resolution of the optics. Cell encapsulation was also possible inside a single photopolymerizable hydrogel, PEG, and a live/dead viability test was performed as evidenced in Figure 4. Encapsulation in PEG is meant only as an example, as PEG does not represent an ideal environment for neural cells. Therefore, the cell viability realized in our PEG constructs is understandably low. Finally, examples of utilizing thin PEG films as a patterned restrictive layer for cell adhesion on cell culture inserts are shown in Figure 5. Additionally, examples of possible \"bad\" results are offered in Figure 6.\nThe results represent only a small fraction of the possible uses of the methods developed in our lab. They are meant to demonstrate the ease, versatility and viability of our approach, and could be treated as \"proof of principle\" for researchers to develop their own possible adaptations.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2636/2636fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

A) Partial polymerization of PEG, leading to an unusable PEG construct. Improper polymerization can occur due to the presence of a meniscus in the pre-polymer medium, insufficient amounts of polymerization medium, insufficient UV exposure or improper focus of the optics. B) Image portraying polymerized PEG constructs (gray) with neurites labeled with Beta III tubulin (green), DAPI stained cell nuclei (blue). The neurites were able to grow outside of the patterned PEG channels. This often occurs in the condition that Puramatrix overflows on top of the PEG portion during injection."
