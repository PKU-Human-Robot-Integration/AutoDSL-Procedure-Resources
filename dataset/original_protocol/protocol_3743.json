    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicroscope construction and alignment\nTiming: 1–4 weeks\nThis step describes the construction and alignment of the presented tiling light sheet microscope from scratch. All components should be installed according to the microscope design to achieve the designed imaging performance.\nNote: The mechanical and electrical design of the microscope is not included in this protocol. It needs to be obtained separately from Westlake University after the execution of an NDA.\nCritical: The alignment of the tiling light sheet microscope should comply with Class 3B laser safety regulations for optical system alignment. Follow the local institutional guidelines and acquire the approval prior to the construction of the microscope if applicable.\nConstruct the control system of the microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The Windows 10 professional 64-bit operating system is required to be installed on the control workstation.\nInstall the NI PCIe-6323 control board and the device driver.\nInstall the camera frame grabber and the device driver.\nInstall the required commercial software listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], including Labview 2019 developer suite or later version and Matlab 2019a or later version.\nInstall the vendor provided control software and device drivers for the optoelectrical components listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], including the laser sources, spatial light modulator (SLM), PI translation stages, filter wheel, and detection camera.\nConfirm all devices work properly using the vendor provided control software.\nInstall the custom software listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], including the main control software, the phase map generation software, and the image reconstruction software.\nConnect the control workstation to the SH-68A connector blocks with the SHC68-68-EPM shielded cables.\nConnect the microscope optoelectrical devices to the assigned analog outputs, digital inputs, and digital outputs of the SH-68A connector blocks with BNC cables.",
    "The microscope control system construction is completed. Ensure all optoelectrical components can be controlled with the main control software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and work properly.\nConstruct the optomechanical system of the microscope (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1D). Combine and collimate the excitation continuous wave (CW) laser beams.\nInstall the laser sources, laser combiner, and the associated components on the optical table according to the microscope design (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCombine all CW laser beams into a single coincident beam before the expanding and collimating lenses L1 (f=30 mm) and L2 (f=200 mm). Align the rest of the microscope using the 488 nm CW laser.\nExpand and collimate the combined laser beam using lenses L1 and L2.\nNote: Ensure the collimation of the 488 nm laser beam with a shear interferometer. Inspect the collimation of other laser beams. It is normal to have a slight divergence or convergence for other laser beams as different laser sources have different beam waist positions and divergences. The divergence and convergence of different lasers are corrected by the spatial light modulator (SLM) in the microscope calibration steps.\nA coincident laser beam with ∼10 mm beam diameter (1/e2) is obtained after this step.\nAlign the spatial light modulator (SLM) assembly and the Galvanometer assembly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Troubleshooting 1\nNote: The SLM, galvo mirror, and rear pupil of the excitation objectives are conjugated with each other through relay lenses in a 4f configuration. The galvo mirror is used as the reference plane of all conjugation planes. The custom phase map generation software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) is required to perform this step and the following steps of the protocol.",
    "Install the polarizing beamsplitter (PBS) assembly, SLM assembly and the associated components on the optical table according to the design (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Ensure the collimated laser beam from the polarizing beam splitter incidents vertically at the center of the SLM liquid crystal surface.\nRotate the half wave plate HWP1 to maximize the intensity of transmitted light through the PBS.\nInstall the galvanometer assembly on the optical table according to the design.\nCenter the galvo rotating axis to the reference mounting hole on the optical table according to the design using the XY translation stage included in the assembly.\nNote: The conjugation from the SLM to the galvo is aligned reversely as the galvo mirror is used as the reference conjugation plane.\nInstall the optical slit assembly.\nConjugate the galvo mirror to the SLM through relay lenses L4 (f=175 mm) and L3 (f=300 mm).\nThe lens L4 needs to be installed and aligned first. Direct the reflected collimated laser beam from the SLM through the lens L4 without the lens L3. Adjust the position the lens L4 until the laser beam is focused on the galvo mirror.\nInstall the lens L3. Adjust the lens L3 by evaluating the collimation of the laser beam after the lens L4. The lens L3 is aligned if the collimated laser beam passing through both L3 and L4 remains collimated.\nApply a phase map with zero tiling phase to the SLM using the provided phase map generation software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The SLM must stay on to align the rest of the microscope.",
    "Readjust the SLM position to ensure the SLM liquid crystal surface conjugates with the galvo mirror. The conjugate image of the phase map applied to the SLM on the galvo mirror has the sharpest edges when the SLM liquid crystal surface locates at a conjugation plane of the galvo mirror.\nAdjust the position of the optical slit along the excitation light optical axis so that it locates at the back focal plane of the lens L3.\nRotate the half wave plate HWP2 to maximize the intensity of the +1 and −1 diffraction orders of the laser beam. Either the +1 or −1 diffraction order can be used for sample illumination.\nAdjust the tilting angle of the SLM to let either the +1 or −1 diffraction order fall on the center of the optical slit. Adjust the width of the optical slit to enable complete transmission of the selected diffraction order while other diffraction orders are blocked. The width of the optical slit determines the maximal tiling distance of the excitation beam.\nThe SLM modulation surface is conjugated to the galvo mirror after this step. A sharp and uniform laser beam cross section profile that is identical to the amplitude mask of the applied phase map can be observed on the galvo mirror when the SLM is turned on after this step.\nConjugate the galvo mirror to the rear pupil of the excitation objectives (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nAdjust the rotating axis of the galvo mirror and ensure the excitation laser beam reflected by the galvo mirror is parallel to the optical table.\nInstall the prism mirror assembly. Adjust the prism mirrors PM1 and PM2 to ensure the laser beams reflected by both prism mirrors are parallel to the optical table.",
    "Note: The optical table surface is used as the reference of the detection focal plane for microscope alignment. Alignment steps 4a and 4b ensure the excitation beam through both excitation objectives stays in focus during beam scanning. PM1 and PM2 can be readjusted if the excitation beam is found to be off focus during beam scanning after the initial alignment, which is very rare.\nInstall the relay lens assemblies and the excitation objective assemblies according to the design.\nConjugate the galvo mirror to the rear pupil of both excitation objectives through two relay lens assemblies respectively.\nAdjust the lateral position of the excitation objectives and ensure the excitation laser beam is centered at the rear pupil of both excitation objectives so that the excitation beams generated by both excitation objectives maintain the same propagation direction as the beam enters each excitation objective.\nThe excitation path of the microscope is roughly aligned after this step. Only fine adjustment is required after this step.\nInstall the fluorescence detection assembly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nAssemble and install the fluorescence detection assembly according to the design.\nUse a piece of coordinate paper as the alignment target. Place the coordinate pater under the detection objective in parallel to the optical table. Focus the detection camera on the alignment target with ambient light. Adjust the magnification by rotating the magnification knob on the MVX10 microscope body. Ensure the alignment target is in focus within the field of view (FOV) at different magnifications. Perform step 5c if the alignment target is not in focus everywhere.",
    "(Optional) The purpose of this step is to ensure the detection focal plane is parallel to the surface of the optical table. Place a steel shim with appropriate thickness under the detection assembly mounting base if the alignment target is not in focus everywhere within the FOV. Adjust the position of the steel shim until the alignment target is in focus within the FOV.\nInstall the imaging chamber assembly. Fill the imaging chamber with the prepared dye solution. Focus the microscope on the excitation beam without scanning the laser beam.\nReadjust the axial position of both excitation objectives along the excitation light optical axis using the manual translation stages of the excitation objective assemblies to place the excitation beam waist at the center of the detection FOV (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nReadjust the position of the lenses L6 (f=250 mm) and L8 (f=250 mm) along the excitation light optical axis and ensure the conjugation between the galvo mirror and both excitation objectives.\nNote: Step 5e and 5f are only required when the RI of the imaging buffer changes significantly, e.g., the imaging buffer is changed from water to BABB, as the excitation beam waist could drift for nearly a centimeter which is larger than the maximal tiling distance of the microscope. Small RI changes of the imaging buffer (<0.1) can be corrected by phase modulation of the illumination light using the SLM directly. Step 4e and 4f are rarely needed after the initial alignment because the RI of biological tissues cleared with commonly used tissue clearing methods is usually between 1.45 and 1.56.\nScan the excitation beam discretely within the FOV using the galvo mirror. Readjust the prism mirror PM1 and PM2 if necessary and ensure that the excitation beam is in focus at all positions within the FOV (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/668-Fig3.jpg",

An imaging chamber must be cleaned completely and dried up before it can be filled with a different kind of imaging buffer. It is suggested to used different imaging chambers for different imaging buffers.\nThe microscope is aligned after this step. Hardware adjustment is generally unnecessary in most applications after this step unless otherwise specified.\nInstall the sample translation assembly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nInstall the sample translation assembly on the optical table according to the design.\nFocus the detection camera on the sample holder using ambient light. Move the sample holder in the horizontal directions and ensure the sample translation directions are coincident with the lateral directions of the detection FOV.\nThe microscope is ready for imaging after this step.\nMicroscope calibration and operation\nTiming: 5–30 mins",
    "This step describes the calibration and operation of the microscope for imaging cleared tissues. The custom phase map generation software and main control software are required to calibrate and operate the microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: This protocol describes the operation procedure using the provided custom software. More detailed descriptions on the microscope imaging modes and phase map generation mechanism can be found in the previous publication (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nMicroscope calibration (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Troubleshooting 2–4\nFill the imaging chamber with the imaging buffer matches the RI of the cleared tissue sample to be imaged. For example, use BABB for tissues cleared with uDISCO.\nCritical: Some imaging buffers, such as BABB, are toxic. Handle the imaging buffer with care.\nScan the excitation beam discretely to create a grid pattern in the imaging buffer using one of the excitation objectives. Focus the microscope on the grid pattern.\nAdjust the microscope magnification by adjusting the magnification knob on the MVX 10 microscope body based on the desired lateral spatial resolution.\nAdjust the intensity profile of the excitation beam based on the desired axial resolution and tiling number by changing the illumination numerical apertures (NA) using the phase map generation program (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). The phase map generation mechanism was described in our previous publication (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFind the tiling coefficients and focus coefficients to tile the excitation beam on both sides of the detection FOV and keep the excitation beam in focus by adjusting the tiling coefficient and focusing coefficient using the phase map generation software (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E, and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nGenerate the phase maps used to tile the excitation beam within the FOV with the phase map generation software using the calibrated coefficients.",
    "Confirm the excitation beam is in focus at all tiling positions (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E–3J, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nRepeat steps 7e and 7f to calibrate all excitation wavelengths for multicolor imaging and generate the corresponding phase maps using the phase map generation software.\nRepeat steps 7e–7h to calibrate the other excitation objective for the needed excitation wavelengths if both excitation objectives are to be used for imaging.\nRepeat steps 7b–7i when needed after changing the detection objective.\nNote: Microscope calibration using the phase map generation software should always be performed prior to imaging unless the imaging buffer and imaging conditions are the same. The calibration procedures are the same regardless of the detection objective being used for imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Microscope calibration, related to step 7\nMicroscope calibration using the provide phase map generation software and the main control software. Associated with Figures 2, 3, and 4. The Movie contains the following calibration steps. 1. Correct the focal position of the scanning excitation beam by changing the focusing coefficient. 2. Change the intensity profile of the scanning excitation beam by changing the illumination NAs (NAOD=0.05, NAID=0.015, NAOD=0.03, NAID=0.01, and NAOD=0.01, NAID=0). 3. Find the tiling coefficients to tile the light sheet at both sides of the FOV. 4. Generate two groups of phase maps to tile the excitation light sheet with the calibrated coefficients at 6 and 3 positions. 5. Load the generated phase maps. 6. Verify the tiling positions of the generated two groups of phase maps. Related to step 7d–7g.\nThe microscope is ready for imaging after this step.\nMicroscope operation and characterization. Troubleshooting 5\nMount the sample on the sample holder made of stainless steel and load the sample holder on the sample translation stage.",
    "Note: Different sample holders and mounting methods should be used to mount samples of different mechanical properties and shapes. The different sample holder designs, the selection of the appropriate sample holder and mounting method was described in our previous publication (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nSelect the regions of interest to be imaged using the main control program and start imaging. The lateral area of each ROI is the same as the detection camera FOV. The axial dimension of each ROI is determined by the depth of the sample volume to be imaged.\nIn order to characterize the performance of the microscope, adjust the excitation light sheet and tiling number using the provide phase map generation software and image the same sample volume with different spatial resolutions and verify the differences. For example, we imaged the same sample volume using the light sheets of different intensity profiles (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and tiling numbers to show the different spatial resolutions of the acquired results (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/668-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Note: The operation procedure of the microscope for imaging is the same regardless of the sample and the detection objective being used for imaging. A more detailed description of the operation modes of the microscope can be found in the previous publication (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nThe sample imaging is completed after this step.\nImage reconstruction\nTiming: 1–24 hrs\nThis step describes the procedure to reconstruct the result from the acquired raw images using the custom image reconstruction software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: The raw image format is dcimg, which is an image format used by Hamamatsu cameras. The reconstruct image format is TIFF that can be opened by most commercial image analysis software. The actual image reconstruction time depends on the data size and the computation power. It typically costs 15 mins to reconstruct 100 GB raw data with the provided image reconstruction software and the suggested computer configuration. The custom image reconstruction software is required to perform the step. A more detailed description of the image reconstruction mechanism can be found in the previous publication (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nImage reconstruction.\nInput the required parameters, including the tiling number, the boundary positions between each two adjacent tiles, and the size of common areas between each two adjacent tiles. The input parameters are used to calculate the amplitude masks to stitch raw images collected at different tiling positions.\nSelect the raw image files to be reconstructed and start reconstructing.\nRegister and merge the reconstructed 3D images from adjacent sample volumes with Amira or other software.\nThe image reconstruction is completed after this step."
