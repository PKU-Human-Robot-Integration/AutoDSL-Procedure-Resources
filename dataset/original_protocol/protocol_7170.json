    "Preparation of a single cell suspension from cell cultureTrypsinize MCF10A cells by adding 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin to a T25 flask. Incubate in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C for 10 min.Add 1 mL of growth medium (see Recipes) to neutralize trypsin and transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g and room temperature (RT) for 3 min.Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of 1× PBS.Note: Here, we take MCF10A cell as an example. These steps can be adjusted based on different cell lines. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment of MCF 10A cells Note: H2O2-treated MCF 10A cells are used as a positive control, as described in Zhu et al. ( 2021). Compared to the non-treated cells, we detected a significantly higher number of damage-associated single-nucleotide variants in H2O2-treated MCF 10A cells, which demonstrates the ability of our method to detect DNA damage.  Trypsinize MCF 10A cells and resuspend them in 1× PBS, as described in procedure A.Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells with 2 mL of freshly prepared H2O2 (300 μM in PBS).Incubate the cells on ice for 5 min.Dilute the cells 1:100 with cold 1× PBS. The cells then directly proceed to picking and lysis.Preparation of neuronal nuclei from frozen human brain tissueThe preparation of single nuclei suspension and staining with anti-NeuN antibody are performed according to the protocol in Krishnaswami et al. (2016). After staining, single nuclei are resuspended in 500 μL of cold 1× PBS.Note: Here, we take the processing of frozen human brain tissue as an example. This step can be adjusted based on different sources of tissue samples.",
    "Single cell isolation by mouth pipettingPreparation of glass capillaries: Flame the center until the glass pipette softens. Then, remove the glass pipette from the flame and quickly pull to generate the capillaries, usually ~3-fold longer than the original glass pipette length. After pulling, bend the glass pipette until the thin middle part breaks.Prepare the aspirator tube assembly using the glass capillary (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4357/bioprotoc-12-06-4357-g002.jpgFigure 2. The aspirator tube assembly with the glass capillary for mouth pipetting. Prepare the single cell suspension with 1× PBS, as described above.Drip a few PBS drops (3 μL per drop) on the microscope slide (4 drops per slide) and place the slide under the microscope (10× field).Add the cells to one PBS drop and perform a serial dilution, by transferring the cells from one drop to another via mouth pipetting.When only one cell is in the field, pick the cell and deposit it into the PCR tube with 2 μL of lysis buffer (see Recipe 1) via mouth pipetting (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Single cell picking under microscopy.  (Alternative) Single cell isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)Prepare the single cell suspension with 1× PBS.(Optional) Cells can be stained with Hoechst 33342, to facilitate gating.Set up the FACS machine in plate mode and single-cell purity.Sort the single cells into PCR tubes with 2 μL of lysis buffer (the PCR tubes can be placed on a full skirted 96-well PCR plate, or a regular rack for PCR tubes).Note: As downstream reactions require multiple steps of operation on each single cell, we recommend sorting single cells into individual PCR tubes. Cell lysis (estimated time: 90 min)Lyse cells in 2 μL of lysis buffer at 30°C for 90 min.Add 2 μL of stop buffer (see Recipe 2) to each cell, to neutralize the lysis buffer.",
    "After briefly spinning down, the single-cell lysate can be stored at -80°C for future use.Safe stopping point:  The single-cell lysate can be stored at -80°C for up to 3 months.UDG treatment (estimated time: 30 min):Note: This step is designed to remove artificial DNA damage (cytosine deamination) introduced during the cell lysis step. Add 5.5 μL of UDG reaction mix (see Recipe 3) to the single-cell lysate.Incubate at 37°C for 30 min in a thermal cycler.Pre-amplification (estimated time: ~2 hr)Add 0.3 μL of deoxynucleotide (dNTP) solution mix and 0.38 μL of pre-amplification primer mix (see Recipe 4) to each sample. Gently flick to mix and briefly spin down.Perform the following reaction on a PCR machine:First cycle:  Heat the samples at 94°C for 50 s.Pause the PCR machine at 65°C and add 2.8 U Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment).

    "Quench the reaction by transferring the samples to ice and keep them on ice for at least 30 s. After the PCR machine cools down to 10°C, transfer the samples back to the PCR block.Note: The efficient primer hybridization requires fast cooling of the reaction to a lower temperature. The ramping process on a regular thermal cycler is slower than directly placing the sample tubes on ice, which leads to less efficient primer hybridization. Resume the program to finish the second round of annealing and extension: 10°C for 40 s, 20°C for 40 s, 25°C for 40 s, 30°C for 40 s, 40°C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, 55°C for 40 s and 65°C for 4 min 30 s.Third cycle:  Heat the samples at 94°C for 20 s.Pause the PCR machine at 65°C and add 2.8 U Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) to the reaction. Adding the enzyme will take 10–20 s.Perform double-strand conversion with 8 cycles of 63°C for 15 s and 65°C for 20 s, followed by 65°C for 1 min.Quench the reaction by transferring the samples to ice and keep them on ice for at least 30 s. After the PCR machine cools down to 10°C, transfer the samples back to the PCR block.Resume the program to finish the last round of annealing and extension: 10°C for 40 s, 20°C for 40 s, 25°C for 40 s, 30°C for 40 s, 40°C for 1 min, 45°C for 1 min, 55°C for 40 s and 65°C for 5 min.Extensive double-strand conversion:  Pause the PCR machine at 78°C and add 0.2 μL of 10 μM GAT27 primer and 3.8 μL of Ultra-pure H2O.Heat the sample at 94°C for 20 s.Pause the PCR machine at 65°C and add 3.6 U Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment).",
    "Resume the program and perform double-strand conversion with 30 cycles of 63°C for 15 s and 65°C for 20 s, followed by 65°C for 2 min. Next, inactivate the Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment) by incubating the sample at 72°C for 25 min.The preamplification products can be temporarily stored at -20°C for a few days.Yield test (estimated time: ~2 h)For each sample, prepare the qPCR reaction mix (5 μL of iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix, 0.5 μL of 10 μM GAT27 primer, and 4 μL of H2O), and add 0.5 μL of preamplification products for yield test. The qPCR program is as follows: initial activation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, primer annealing at 60°C for 25 s, and primer extension at 72°C for 2 min 20 s.

The example result of the yield test of single human neurons. The negative control (tube without single cell) is colored in red.Split amplification by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) with frequent pipetting mixing (estimated time: ~2 h)Note: The limited reaction time and the inclusion of pipetting mixing steps help to reduce the amplification bias and increase the robustness of MDA reactions. Briefly vortex the preamplification product and split it into three tubes (~4.7 μL per tube) to perform three independent MDA reactions.Add 24.3 μL of MDA reaction mix (see Recipe 5) to each reaction.Add 10 U phi29 DNA polymerase to each reaction on ice, followed by incubation on ice for 3 min.",

After incubating at RT for 30 s, discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Repeat the last step.Remove the residual ethanol.Keep the tube on the magnetic stand with its lid open and air dry the beads until there is no ethanol left (which usually takes 5–10 min).Remove the tube from the magnetic stand.Add 6.5 μL of UV-treated ultrapure H2O for elution. As BSA makes beads very sticky, avoid any pipetting after adding the water. Instead, mix the beads with water by frequently flicking the tube.After mixing well, incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.",
    "Place the tube back on the magnetic stand.After the solution becomes clear, transfer the supernatant to a new PCR tube.Safe stopping point:  The purified MDA products can be stored at -20°C for up to 7 days.Library construction (estimated time: ~2 h)Add 6.3 μL of 2× Illumina Tagment DNA buffer and 0.2 μL of 10-fold diluted Illumina TDE1 to each reaction.

    "After the solution becomes clear, transfer the supernatant to a new PCR tube.Measure the library concentration using the QubitTM dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Briefly, mix 1 μL of library DNA, 1 μL of Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent, and 198 μL of Qubit dsDNA HS Buffer in a clean Qubit assay tube. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min, and then measure the concentration in a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Usually, the concentration ranges from 4.5 ng/μL to 6 ng/μL, which corresponds to 90–120 ng in total.Measure the library size distribution by using TapeStation. Briefly, mix 1 μL of library DNA with 3 μL of Agilent D1000 Sample Buffer in a 0.2 mL tube of an 8-Tube PCR strip without caps. Run the sample on a Agilent D1000 ScreenTape on the 4200 TapeStation System (Figure 4A).Note: Library size after size selection is expected to be between 300–700 bp. Loci test (estimated time: ~1 h)We randomly chose 6 loci (see Table 1) to verify an even amplification using qPCR (Figure 4B–C). For each locus, 5 ng of library DNA is used as the template. The qPCR program is as follows: initial activation with 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 12 s, primer annealing and extension at 58°C for 25 s. The cells with no more than two loci drop out in each split reaction proceed for paired-end (150 bp × 2) sequencing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4357/bioprotoc-12-06-4357-g004.jpgFigure 4.
