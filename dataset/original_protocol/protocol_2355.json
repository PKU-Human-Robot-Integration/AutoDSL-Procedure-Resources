    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerfusion, dissection, and homogenization of mouse brain tissues\nTiming: around 20 min per mouse for steps 1-9 (perfusion and homogenization)\nThis section describes how to properly perfuse, dissect, and homogenize brain tissue into a suitable single cell suspension without excessive loss of microglia through Dounce homogenization at 4°C.\nTo reduce the procedure time, consider enrolling multiple participants for the homogenization step of this protocol. These steps do not need to be carried out within the confines of a biological safety cabinet unless the downstream application is culture of isolated microglia (not recommended). If cell culture is the downstream application, perform all steps where the cell solution is exposed to the atmosphere in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.\nPerfuse adult mouse transcardially with 20 mL of ice-cold HBSS and dissect entire brain or brain region of interest (see note) with razor blades on ice and keep in ice-cold HBSS until homogenization. For a visual reference on transcardial perfusion with a syringe, please see Method Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: Following the perfusion of mouse with ice-cold HBSS, microdissection of brain regions of interest and whole brain razor blade chopping should be performed on a petri dish embedded in wet ice.\nNote: Meninges do not need to be removed at this step, meningeal removal will be accomplished via discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation.\nNote: A perfusion rate of 10 mL/min is recommended to prevent vessel rupture and ensure a thorough perfusion.\nNote: Mice below 2 months of age may not require 20mL to achieve a thorough perfusion, although there is minimal risk in over-perfusing, so we recommend using 20mL regardless of age, with the exception of neonates which cannot be perfused, and brains can be directly extracted following euthanasia.",
    "Note: This protocol can be applied to brain regions as small as an adult mouse hippocampus, although experience with the protocol is recommended as the Percoll layers and cell pellets will be difficult to identify with such a limited input.\nNote: If performing this procedure on multiple mice, brains should be dissected and kept in ice-cold HBSS (7 mL) until razor blade chopping and homogenization. This volume of HBSS is ideal for downstream homogenization. Do not proceed directly to homogenization after dissection.\nNote: Our experience finds that one adult mouse forebrain hemisphere is the ideal amount of tissue for this procedure to achieve the most efficient yield. This procedure can be completed with an entire brain, however in our experimental design, another hemisphere is used for drop fixation or freshly snap frozen. It is recommended to process by half brains for beginners and move to whole brain when protocol is mastered.\nNote: Chopping once or twice sagittally and 3–4 times coronally will reduce the time homogenization takes in the next portion of this protocol and will contribute to a successful homogenization.\nNote: In our experiments, the cerebellum is excluded on account of transcriptional distinction of microglia within this brain region. Depending on the downstream experiment, the experimenter may wish to remove the cerebellum for microglia isolation. This protocol can be performed with the cerebellum intact.\nDump entire contents of one brain in HBSS into a clean ice-cold Dounce homogenizer pre-rinsed with ice-cold HBSS.\nNote: Clean glass homogenizers with soap and water, then rinse 3x with ample distilled water. Finally, ensure that the homogenizers are rinsed with ice-cold HBSS before brain homogenization to ensure proper tonicity within the homogenizer environment.\nVery gently and slowly begin to homogenize the brain tissue with the A pestle (or loose pestle).",
    "Push down on the tissue with the pestle until brain tissue is slightly expelled up and around the sides of the pestle foot and in-between the wall of the homogenizer.\nGently twist to separate the expelled tissue from the rest of the brain tissue.\nNote: For a guide on how to homogenize brain tissue with pestle A, see Method Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nCritical: The quality of homogenization is the single most important factor in determining downstream cell quality. Because this is a mechanical dissociation, it is imperative to be gentle and slow when beginning the homogenization.\nContinue homogenizing gently with pestle A until all remaining chunks can bypass the foot of pestle A upon depression and retraction with minimal resistance. When the mixture is similar in appearance to the image shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, begin homogenization with pestle B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of the homogenization solution after completion of pestles A and B\n(A) Once the homogenization mixture reaches the consistency shown in this image, the suspension is ready to begin homogenization with pestle B.\n(B) Once the suspension reaches the consistency shown in panel B, the suspension is ready to be poured into a 15 mL tube for centrifugation.\nBegin homogenization with pestle B.\nNote: Similar to pestle A, moving too fast or applying too much force with the pestle will apply excessive shear force and will destroy microglia. Therefore, it is critical to apply slow, even strokes with pestle B. For a visual reference on the proper homogenization technique to follow with pestle B, please see Method Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nHomogenize with pestle B until barely any visible chunks are visible.",
    "Note: Some myelin debris will be impossible to homogenize into a single cell suspension but ensure that no pink brain tissue chunks are visible. Consult Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for a visual guide to what can be considered thorough homogenization.\nCritical: In addition to maintaining cell viability, it is critical that as close to a single cell solution as possible is achieved. Doublets and other large cell aggregates will be excluded upon cell sorting, which can reduce microglia yield. However, over-homogenization will also reduce the viability of the preparation and should be avoided.\nOnce thoroughly homogenized, dump contents into a fresh, pre-chilled Falcon 15mL tube.\nRinse homogenizer with ice-cold HBSS (7 mL) and do five slow passes with both pestles A and B. Add the contents of this wash step to the tube containing the homogenization mixture.\nNote: If interested in analyzing homogenous mixture, 500 μL can be taken, centrifuged to pellet the cells and snap frozen for downstream applications.\nRinse the homogenizer with 7-mL ice-cold HBSS and apply vigorous strokes (10 times) with both pestles A and B to ensure no stuck cells which could be added to downstream homogenizations.\nDiscard the HBSS. Repeat the homogenization process for the remaining brains.\nWhen all samples are homogenized, pellet the mixture by centrifuging at 350 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nNote: Given that a slow and careful homogenization is key to the success of this protocol, each brain can take upwards up 15 min to complete with an average of 5 min per homogenization step. Therefore, if many samples are being used in one experiment, multiple people homogenizing can expedite this protocol.",
    "If not already prepared, prepare however many Falcon tubes equal to the number of samples in the experiment by adding 5 mL of 70% Percoll to the 15-mL Falcon tubes and leaving them at room temperature.\nNote: Ensure that 70% Percoll and 37% Percoll solutions are prepared and at room temperature prior to this step.\nRemove tubes from centrifuge and dump out the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet, and place in a rack holder.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the homogenate will look like after centrifugation, please refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: Ensure a thorough resuspension without destroying cells by pipetting. A thorough resuspension will ensure that microglia clumped to other cell types will not get pulled away from the interphase layer. We recommend initially re-suspending with one mL of 37% Percoll with a P1000 and adding the additional 4 mL of Percoll with a pipette controller.\nSlowly and carefully layer the 37% Percoll resuspension on top of the 70% Percoll layer previously prepared in step 11.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the separated layers should look like prior to centrifugation, please refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nCritical: Mixing of the layers will destroy the interphase separation. To avoid this, use the gravity setting of the pipette and very slowly apply the first milliliter of the 37% layer. Hold the tube containing the 70% Percoll at a 65° angle initially to slow liquid travel down the tube. Adjust the angle of the tube to vertical (90°) as you add more 37% Percoll. For a visual guide of this process, please refer to Method Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nOnce all samples are layered, carefully return them to the centrifuge in the respective swinging bucket and set the centrifuge settings to 23°C, 25 min, 800 g, acceleration 3 and brake 1.\nNote: Given the minimal brake, this step will take around 30 min total.\nNote: Remove tubes from centrifuge very gently so as not to disturb the interphase layer.\nNote: Set the centrifuge temperature to 4°C immediately after removing the tubes.\nWhile these tubes are spinning, prepare the necessary number of Falcon 15-mL tubes by dumping out the blocking buffer and filling the tubes with 8 mL of FACS buffer.",
    "Bring all tubes back to the workspace and, using a P1000, collect the interphase layer of cells. Collect between 2 to 3 mL, expelling into the appropriately labeled Falcon 15-mL tube containing FACS buffer.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the layer should look like, please refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Method Video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]. For a visual guide of the vacuuming procedure, please see Method Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6].\nNote: The interphase layer may look like a hazy disc and should appear exactly at 5 mL. After vacuuming this layer with your pipette, the separation between the two layers should become glassy.\nNote: While it is not necessary, it may be helpful to aspirate the layer of myelin debris which will be on top of the 37% layer, with either an aspirator connection or a P1000 to facilitate interphase layer collection.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 4°C, 350 g for 5 min.\nFollowing centrifugation, aspirate or remove all but 300 μL of liquid from the Falcon 15-mL tubes and re-suspend the pellet.\nNote: At this point forward, it will be difficult to identify the pellet and gauge whether the pellet is re-suspended. Ensure even and thorough resuspension by agitating all sides of the bottom of the Falcon 15-mL tubes for subsequent resuspension steps with at least 10 pumps of a P1000.\nNote: fill an extra 15-mL Falcon tube with 300 μL of liquid to give you a reference of the volume to keep in your experimental tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

For a negative control for live/dead microglia, induce membrane lysis by exposing cells to a hypertonic solution or take one sample and vigorously homogenize to induce cell death. For a visual reference of poor homogenization technique leading to a greater number of dead microglia, please refer to Method Video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7] which demonstrates a very fast and aggressive homogenization where a high amount of pressure is applied with pestle A and B, brain tissue is crushed and the fast pestle movement results in shear forces and cell lysis.",
    "Create a master-mix of CD11b-PEcy7, Ly6C-PercpCy5.5 and LIVE/DEAD UV Stain at a concentration of 1:150 for each antibody/dye in FACS buffer, with 300 μL of volume for each sample being accounted for. i.e., - If there are 3 samples, create a 1 mL solution (300 μL × 3 + 100 μL pipette error compensation) of 1:150 LIVE/DEAD, CD11b-PEcy7, Ly6C-PercpCy5.5 (6.6 μL each).\nAdd 300 μL of staining master mix to each Falcon 15 tube containing the re-suspended pellet of myeloid cells. Leave on ice, covered from light for 15 min.\nTo wash the cells, fill the Falcon 15-mL tubes with 8 mL ice-cold FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 4°C, 350 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving only 2–300 μL remaining in the tube. Re-suspend the pellet.\nUsing a P1000, transfer the re-suspended cell solution from the Falcon 15-mL tubes to the filter cap FACS sorting tubes, being sure to expel the suspension through the filter caps.\nFill a FACS collection tube (1.5 mL) with 300 μL of ice hold HBSS.\nUsing a cell sorter, isolate singlet LIVE/dead negative, Ly6C negative, CD11b positive cells.
