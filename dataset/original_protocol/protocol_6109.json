    "Configuration of the microscope for polarizationThe fluorescence polarization microscopy setup should be set up so that a polarized excitation source illuminates the sample and the emitted light is split into two channels, one that is parallel to the excitation polarization and one that is perpendicular. This setup is achieved by placing a polarizer in the excitation path, and then setting up an image splitter with polarization optics to collect the two different polarization channels simultaneously. Remove existing polarization components (e.g., Nomarski DIC optics) from the microscope.Place a linear polarizer in the excitation path. It should be oriented perpendicularly to the optical bench. Align the image splitter with polarization optics per the manufacturer's recommendations (Figure 1). It should be set up so that one half of the image will collect light polarized parallel to the excitation polarizer, and the other half should collect light with polarization perpendicular to the excitation polarizer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190428/20190428231217_6185.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of fluorescence polarization microscopy imaging setup. A polarizer filters the light from an illumination source, and this light is deflected to an objective, where it illuminates the sample. The emitted light from the sample is then filtered by an emission filter. A beam splitter then separates the emitted light into P and S polarizations. Images of both polarizations are projected simultaneously on a single camera. Measurement of the corrective (g) factorTo correct for polarization biases within the instrument, it is important to measure a correction factor, called g. This factor is measured by using a small organic fluorescent dye. Due to its small size, the dye will rotate faster than its fluorescence lifetime, and therefore, its emitted light when excited with a polarized light source should be isotropic. Therefore, any anisotropy that we measure from it can be attributed to the polarization biases of the optical setup.",
    "Prepare 10 μM fluorescein solution (Recipe 1), and aliquot 2 ml into a 35 mm MatTek dish. Image the solution using ‘YFP’ capture conditions (505 nm illumination, EYFP cube), capturing images that are parallel (P) and perpendicular (S) to the excitation polarization plane.Collect a background image using the same camera exposure conditions without illumination.Calculate corrective factor g:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190428/20190428231351_5030.pngCell line maintenanceMaintain HEK293-T cells in T-25 cell culture flasks in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Passage cells every two to three days when they reach about 80% confluence, according to the following protocol: Gently aspirate media from the flask, leaving the cells unperturbed. Wash cells twice with DPBS.Trypsinize with 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C for 1 min.Neutralize the trypsin with culture media. Split the HEK293-T cells at a ratio of 1:20 into a new flask with fresh culture medium. Place in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.Seeding cells onto imaging dishesCells should be seeded onto imaging dishes one to three days before imaging is to be performed. Coat MatTek imaging dishes with 100 μg/ml Poly D-lysine for 1 h. Wash twice with DPBS, and dry overnight at room temperature.One to three days before imaging, seed a suitable number of cells onto the coated MatTek dishes with fresh medium. Cells can be seeded on a day in which the cells are being passed after the trypsin is neutralized, and the number of cells seeded depends on the number of days before imaging. Seed enough cells so that confluency is ~80% the day before imaging. Keep these imaging dishes in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2.TransfectionTransfection should be performed the day before imaging.",
    "If you seed the cells onto the imaging dishes on the same day, wait at least four hours before transfection, and confirm that cells are well adhered before starting transfection. Confluency should be approximately 80% at the time of transfection. Prepare plasmid DNA for biosensors of interest. To monitor Erk activity, Protein Kinase A activity, and calcium, use FLARE mVenus-cp172Venus EKAR, FLARE mCherry-mCherry AKAR, and FLARE mCerulean3-mCerulean3 Cameleon. For these sensors, the N-terminal fluorescent protein (FP) is cloned between BamHI and SphI restriction sites, the molecular switch is cloned between SphI and SacI sites, and the C-terminal FP is cloned between SphI and EcoRI, in a pcDNA3.1+ mammalian expression vector. A stop codon is present at the end of the C-terminal FP. A header sequence, with a poly-His tag and a Kozak consensus sequence is added at the N-terminal position between HindIII and EcoRI. Because the SphI and SacI sites are not unique in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid, cloning steps should be performed in the bacterial expression vector pRSET-B backbone, and then the final sensors should be subcloned into the pcDNA3.1+ mammalian expression vector. Combine 0.33 μg of each plasmid in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (A). In a second 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (B), separately add 3 μl PolyJet transfection reagent to 50 μl of serum-free DMEM.Add the contents of from reagent mixture B dropwise into microcentrifuge tube A taking care to avoid contact with the container walls. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Add the combined PolyJet-DNA mixture dropwise into the center of the imaging dish.Gently swirl the imaging dishes to mix.Incubate the imaging dishes overnight in a 37 °C incubator and 5% CO2. ImagingBefore imaging, prepare 1,000x stock solutions of drugs, including Forskolin, IBMX, EGF, and thapsigargin. Aliquot 2 μl into 1.",
    "5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and keep these on ice.On the day of imaging, pipet out old culture media and wash three times with imaging buffer (HBSS imaging buffer containing 2.0 g/L of D-glucose, pH-adjusted to 7.4, and filter sterilized). After the washes, add 2 ml of HBSS. Make sure that all phenol-red from the culture media has been washed away. During these wash steps, be careful not to disturb the cells, as HEK293-T cells are only weakly adherent, and perform the wash steps gently.Place the imaging dish on the microscope stage and secure it. Focus the image on the cells, and determine the appropriate exposure time and excitation power for each color, so that none of the channels are over-exposed. Because of the image splitter with polarizers, the image should have two halves, one half reflecting the P and one the S polarization, with the P fluorescence approximately 2-3 fold brighter than the S. Image a time course, imaging each color channel every 30 s. Acquire a baseline, which consists of the first ten time points.After the baseline, pause the acquisition to add Forskolin/IBMX, to stimulate PKA. With a P1000 pipette, take up a few hundred microliters of imaging media from the imaging dish, and add to the microcentrifuge tube with the drug aliquot. Pipette up and down to mix. Carefully add this volume back to the imaging dish, on the side of the imaging dish, as to not disturb the cells, with the pipette tip submerged in the media. Pipette gently up and down to mix. Resume the acquisition immediately after drug addition.Repeat drug additions at the desired times for the other stimulations."
