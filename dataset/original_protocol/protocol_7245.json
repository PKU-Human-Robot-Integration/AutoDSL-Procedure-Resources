    "ANIMALS AND TREATMENTS Animals and embryo collection Six-eight-week-old female mice were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) (Ningbo Second Hormone Factory, China) and 44–48 h later, 5 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (Livzon, Zhuhai, China), and then placed with fertile males overnight. Pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a copulation plug in mated females the following morning. Zygotes or two-cell embryos were recovered 20 h and 40 h post-hCG from mated females, respectively. The embryos were collected in HEPES-buffered modified human tubal fluid medium (HEPES-HTF) (O’Neill, 1997), and all components of the media were tissue culture grade (Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, MO, USA) and contained 3 mg bovine serum albumin/mL (Sigma).Medium preparation and treatments Calibrate the concentration of OPP for embryo treatmentTo minimize the embryonic toxicity of OPP during the period of embryo treatment, several doses of OPP should be tested. For example, dilute Component A (20 mM) with KSOM medium (Lawitts and Biggers, 1993) to produce a range of OPP concentrations (e.g., 50, 37.5, and 25 μM) to 400 µL of final working solutions (Table 1).Table 1. Prepare a series of working solutions of Click-iT® OPP (Component A) table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nOPP (μM),KSOM (µL),Component A (µL),DMSO (µL),Total volume (µL)\n0,399,0,1,400\n25,399,0.5,0.5,400\n37.5,399,0.75,0.25,400\n50,399,1,0,400",
    "The example is to prepare three doses of OPP. The control is 0 μM OPP in KSOM medium. Adjust the concentration of DMSO to 0.25% (v/v) in all working solutions.Note: Total volume can be proportionally adjusted depending on the number of treatments; The concentration of OPP can be readjusted or optimized for the different experimental designs. A range of culture medium types are suitable for use depending upon the experimental design (e.g., hTF medium and KSOM, supplemented with or without amino acids). OPP treatment (Figures 1 A1-4)Set up microdrops on culture dishes. Each drop contains 50 µL of OPP working solutions overlaid with 2 mm of heavy paraffin oil (Sigma).Optional: use 60-well Terasaki plates (LUX 5260, Nunc, Naperville, IL, USA), each containing 10 µL of OPP working solutions. Equilibrate in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 2 h.Transfer the embryos into OPP working solutions.Optional: embryo density is optional, e.g., 1–10 embryos in 10 µL of working solutions. Keep the same density in all treatments. Culture and treat the embryos for 2–6 h at 37°C, with 5% CO2 in air tension.CRITICAL: (1) It was suggested that the incubation periods with OPP be between 30 min and 1 h to maximize detection and minimize toxicity (Liu et al., 2012; Signer et al., 2014). However, translation in preimplantation embryos may be different from the somatic cells. In simple formulated medium, 2-cell embryo expressed a peak signal after 6 h treatment with 37.5 µM OPP (Li et al., 2021). Thus, we recommend testing different incubation periods (Figure 2B) with different concentrations of OPP (Figure 2 A) and doses of drugs (Figure 2C) for each stage of embryo development used before the final experimental design is determined (as in the example in Table 1).",
    "(2) Similar calibrations are suggested if the experiments are performed in different oxygen concentrations, as this protocol was designed for the OPP treatment in air tension before final experimental design is determined. STEP-BY-STEP METHOD DETAILS Note: To facilitate systematically processing embryos, we use 60-well Terasaki plates (Figure 1 B1–2). Each well can contain 10 µL of solution and 1–10 embryos. Transfer embryos with minimal solution into the well of the next step and use clean pipettes for each transfer stage. Proceed to embryo fixation and permeabilization (Figure 1 B1–2) Work at room temperature. Transfer embryos treated with OPP into washing solution and rinse once to remove the media.Transfer embryos into 10 µL fixation buffer/well. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Wash embryos twice with washing solution to remove fixative.Transfer embryos into 10 µL of permeabilization buffer and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.Click-iT® OPP Detection (Figure 1 B1–2) Prepare Click-iT® reaction cocktail according to Table 2.Table 2. Click-iT® reaction cocktail table:",

    "Note: Use the Click-iT® reaction cocktail within 15 min of preparation. The number of wells can vary depending on the experiment. It is important to calculate the number of wells you will plate before you start the experiment. Wash embryos twice with 10 µL of washing solutionTransfer embryos into 10 µL of Click-iT® reaction cocktail.Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Protected from light.Wash once with 10 µL per well of Click-iT® reaction rise buffer (Component F).DNA Staining (Figure 1 B1-2) Note: The following protocol is based upon 10 µL of HCS NuclearMaskTM Blue Stain working solution per well. Dilute HCS NuclearMaskTM Blue Stain (Component G) solution (1:2,000, v/v) in 1× PBS to obtain a 1× HCS NuclearMaskTM Blue Stain working solution.Transfer embryos into 10 µL of 1× HCS NuclearMaskTM Blue Stain working solution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light.Wash twice with washing solution and proceed to Imaging and Analysis (below).Imaging Make slides (Figure 1 C1–5)Clean the glass slides and the coverslips with ethanol.Use an insulin syringe with 18–22 G needle filled with vaseline. Make two parallel lanes of vaseline on the slide to support the coverslip. The vaseline lane should 1–2 mm thick.Add a drop of 7 µL 1× PBS onto a slide. (Optional: use standard anti-fade mounting media).Transfer 10 embryos/drop and gently put an 18 × 18 mm coverslip on with forceps; remove any excess fluid from edges of the coverslip with a lint-free absorbent tissue.Seal with nail polish (optional: PathTech, https://www.pathtech.com.au[href=https://www.pathtech.com.au]). Take care not to move the coverslip to avoid squashing the embryos).Scan the slide under fluorescence microscope with filters appropriate for DAPI/Hoechst and FITC for Alexa Fluor® 488 (Figures 2 A–C).",

(Any similar fluorescent microscope systems are suitable)Fluorescence measurement and Data analysis Measure the intensity of the fluorescent OPP stainThe fluorescent intensity of nascent protein synthesis in the fluorescent channel in the nucleus or whole embryo can be measured by suitable analysis software, e.g., ImageJ and ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc.).With ImageJ, open the images of the embryo with dual staining of OPP and NuclearMask blue stain.In the Analyze menu, open Set Measurements and tick “Area”, “Integrated density”, “Mean gray value”, and Standard deviation”.In the image of NuclearMask blue stain, outline the single nucleus using freehand selection of region of interest (ROI). From Analyze > Tool, open ROI Manager. Add this ROI to ROI Manager and rename it.Allocate the ROI for the outlined nuclei from ROI Manager to the image of OPP stain of same embryo. This is the exact localization of the nucleus for the dual staining images of same embryo.Select “Measure” from the analyze menu. The results are shown as a popup box with a stack of values for that nucleus of the embryo cell. The same way to measure the fluorescence of OPP stain of another nucleus.Directly measure the fluorescent stain of the outlined whole embryo using freehand selection of ROI.Record and copy the integrated density (stand for the fluorescent intensity of OPP stain) from the popup box for ROI of each nucleus or whole embryo. Set up an Excel spreadsheet for data analysis from all treatments and controls.Subtract the values in the control treatment of 0 µM OPP from the values from all treatments and controls in the same experiments. The resulting values are used for analysis.",
    "Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (Optional: other Statistic software). Fluorescence intensity (AU, arbitrary units of optical density of staining) was quantitatively analyzed by univariate analysis of variance. This parameter was set as the dependent variable, while the test treatments and drug doses were the independent variables. Experimental replicates were incorporated into the model as covariates. Differences between individual independent variables were analyzed by the least significance difference test. Less than a 5% probability (P < 0.05) was considered significant.Critical: The results from quantitative analysis of fluorescent intensity can vary between experiments due to a range of uncontrollable variables. It is therefore important that embryos from each treatment were processed at the same time and in parallel. All treatments were exposed to the same preparations and dilutions of all reagents. Similarly, all preparations from an experiment were examined microscopically within the same session, and identical microscope and camera settings were used. All image analysis was carried out in an identical manner for each embryo within an experiment. All preparations were carried out by the same experienced operator throughout the study. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4441/bioprotoc-12-11-4441-g002.jpgFigure 2.
