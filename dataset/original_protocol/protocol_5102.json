    "Grow Haloferax volcanii cells to stationary phase (OD600 2.0-3.0) in ATCC974 medium and sterilely mix 1:1 with 40% (v/v) glycerol. Store the 20% (v/v) glycerol stock of cells at -80 °C (long-term).Inoculate the cells by taking a tip of the 20% (v/v) glycerol stock using a sterilized wooden stick and streaking for isolation onto a culture plate that has ATCC974 (described in Recipes section) medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) agar for solid medium and novobiocin (0.2 μg ml-1) to maintain the plasmid DNA. Wrap the plates with Parafilm and transfer to zip-lock plastic bags to prevent loss of moisture. Incubate the cells for around 100 h at 42 °C. Store the cells on the plates in the sealed bags at room temperature in the dark for up to 2 weeks. Inoculate isolated colonies of the Haloferax volcanii strains carrying plasmid pJAM2201 into 4 ml ATCC974 medium with novobiocin (0.2 μg ml-1). Grow the cells at 42 °C in liquid medium with rotary shaking at 200 rpm in 13 x 100 mm2 culture tubes.Monitor the growth of the cells at OD600 using the spectrophotometer. After around 20 h of incubation, the cells will reach log-phase (OD600 of 0.4-0.7). Normalize the log-phase cells by subculturing the cells to an OD600 of 0.06 in 5.1 ml of fresh ATCC974 medium (the added 0.1 ml of medium compensates for loss of culture volume during growth due to evaporation). Grow the cells in the liquid medium for 24 h to again reach log phase with rotary shaking at 200 rpm in 13 x 100 mm2 culture tubes at 42 °C. Determine the OD600 of the log-phase cells by using 0.2 ml of the cell culture and the spectrophotometer.",
    "Harvest the remaining cells by centrifugation (10,000 x g, 6 min, 25 °C) and resuspend the cell pellets by vortexing for 30 sec in 4.2 ml pre-warmed concentrated salt water solution (described in Recipes section) to a final OD600 of 0.7. Collect 1 ml of the cells as the 0 min sample. Treat the remaining cells with 20 μg ml-1 actinomycin D and 50 μg ml-1 anisomycin. Actinomycin D is added into the culture right after the addition of anisomycin. Grow cells with rotary shaking at 200 rpm in 13 x 100 mm2 culture tubes at 42 °C.Note: Actinomycin D is dissolved in acetone to make a stock solution at 10 mg ml-1. Anisomycin is dissolved in methanol to make a stock solution at 20 mg ml-1. Actinomycin D and anisomycin tend to form some precipitants in high-salt buffer, vortex the solution to fully dissolve the antibiotics.Transfer 1 ml of antibiotic-treated cells from the culture tube to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at various intervals (20, 40, 60 min). Immediately harvest the cells at each interval by centrifugation (10,000 x g, 6 min, 4 °C). Carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting as shown in Figure 1 without touching the cell pellets. Freeze the cell pellets at -80 °C before lysis.Note: Vortex the solution in the culture tube for 10 sec right before transferring from the culture tube. The cell pellets are frozen at -80 °C for 1-3 h before further processing of the samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315011723_9159.jpgFigure 1. Image showing how to remove the supernatant without touching the cell pellets. Haloferax volcanii cells after centrifugation appear as red pellets. The authors recommend to put the small tip on top of the big tip when using a 1,000 μl pipette for pipetting.",
    "Resuspend the harvested cells by up and down pipetting in SDS reducing buffer (described in the Recipes section). In this experiment, 1 ml cell culture is collected and ~0.07 OD600 units of cells are analyzed in 5 µl of sample by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the volume of the SDS reducing buffer is added at 71.4 (μl) times the OD600 of the cell pellet. Vol (SDS reducing buffer) (μl) = OD600 x Vol (harvested cell culture) (ml) x Vol (sample loaded on gel) (μl)/0.07. Boil the cell suspension 3 times (5 min each time with 30 sec vortex between each time). Analyze the sample (5 µl per lane) by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting following a regular protocol. Generally, proteins are separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes by wet transfer. Equivalent protein loading is determined by OD600 of cell culture (0.08 OD600 units per lane) and confirmed by staining parallel gels with Coomassie blue. Tbp2-StrepII is detected by mouse anti-StrepII polyclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-alkaline phosphatase-linked antibody (1:10,000 dilution). Flag-SAMP is detected by alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (1:10,000 dilution). Targeted proteins on PVDF are visualized by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star with X-ray film according to the user guidelines.The X-ray films are scanned and the intensity of protein bands by Western blotting is quantified using ImageJ software."
