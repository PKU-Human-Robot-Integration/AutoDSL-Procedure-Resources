Note that sonicator settings vary from instrument to instrument, so check that the optical density of the SWNT solution increases (i.e., turns black) to ensure that the SWNTs are being dispersed.\nCentrifuge the solution for 20 min at 16,100 x g and discard supernatant.\nAdd approximately 45 mL of fresh deionized water.\nRepeat steps 2.1.2-2.1.4 up to 8 times.\nRemove as much water as possible being careful not to disturb pelleted SWNTs and allow SWNT pellet to air dry.\nNucleic acid suspensions of SWNTs\nDissolve nucleic acids (NA) in 0.1 M NaCl to a concentration of 100 mg/mL.\nRemove static electricity from disposable spatula, microcentrifuge tubes and SWNT stock using an anti-static gun.

Seal the channels by taking a long glass coverslip and pressing it onto the top of the double sided tape. Be sure it is centered on the microscope slide so the edges of the cover slip and slide are not flush.\nAdd 100 µL of BSA-Biotin stock solution to 900 µL of 1x Tris buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nFlow 50 µL of the BSA-biotin solution into the channel by pipetting the solution into one end and wicking away solution at the other using a tissue.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Microscopy of SWNT Sensors\nnIR Fluorescence Microscopy\nPerform imaging of surface immobilized SWNTs using laser excitation and an inverted microscope outfitted with an InGaAs sensor array for imaging.\nDirect the laser beam to enter the back illumination port of an inverted microscope using mirrors on adjustable kinematic mounts and a pair of post-mounted irises set to the port height. Ensure the beam is level and straight by confirming it passes through both irises when placed between subsequent mirrors and before it enters the illumination port. If necessary, adjust the beam height using a periscope assembly. Remove any short-pass heat filters on the illumination port that would attenuate the beam.",
    "Insert an appropriate filter cube into the microscope to reflect the excitation light into the objective and collect emission light. This typically consists of a dichroic long pass filter with a cutoff above the excitation wavelength, (e.g., 750 LP) and an emission long pass filter (e.g., 850 LP) to further minimize scattered excitation light from hitting the sensor. Additionally, the emission filter can be chosen to be selective for the emission of SWNTs of a particular chirality.\nPerform fine adjustments to the beam alignment by inserting an appropriate alignment cube replacing the objective with two offset, frosted discs containing 1 mm pinholes. Align the beam to the center of both the lower and upper alignment discs.\nAttach a 2D InGaAs sensor array to the side imaging port of the microscope using an appropriate adapter and a 0.5X lens if necessary to accommodate the sensor size.\nUsing a 100X oil immersion objective (1.4 NA), apply fluorescence-free immersion oil and place the immobilized SWNT sample onto the microscope stage.\nRaise the objective until the oil contacts the bottom of the cover glass (#1.5, 170 µm thickness). Make adjustments to the objective collar if necessary for imaging conditions, e.g., temperature, glass thickness, etc.\nSlowly raise the objective with the excitation source on and monitor the fluorescence signal of the InGaAs camera. Fluorescence intensity should gradually increase as the focal plane approaches the surface and the immobilized sensors come into focus.\nnIR Fluorescence Spectroscopy\n\tNOTE: Fluorescence spectroscopy can be performed using the same microscope setup but by directing the collected light out of the microscope body and into a spectrometer and InGaAs linear array detector.",
    "Using kinematic mounts and mirrors rated for nIR, direct the light path towards the entrance slit of the spectrometer. Focus the light down to a point onto the entrance slit using a focusing lens (e.g., plano-convex, f = 150 mm). This alignment is accomplished by attenuating the laser power to <1 mW and replacing the microscope objective with a 1\" mirror and using a 50/50 beam-splitting filter cube. The excitation light will then leave the microscope body through the exit port and can be used to adjust the mirrors and lens to focus the beam onto the entrance slit.\nAfter replacing the microscope objective and long pass filter, place a well plate onto the stage and record the spectra of an in-focus sample using the spectrometer and InGaAs array.\nMeasuring the reversible response of (GT)15 DNA-SWNTs to dopamine\nMount sensor coated channels onto the microscope stage and bring into focus using a 100X oil objective and InGaAs camera. Add 50 µL of 100 µM dopamine solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the flow channel and record the change in fluorescence intensity.\nWash out the dopamine solution using phosphate buffered saline and observe the change in fluorescence of the individual SWNT sensors.\nWell-plate screening for analyte response of SWNTs sensors\n\tNOTE: Screening of different analytes can be performed using a transparent well plate controlled using a motorized stage. An ideal well plate is transparent to visible and IR and has black sidewalls to minimize crosstalk between the wells.\n\t\nPipette equal volumes of suspended SWNT sensor (e.g., 5 mg/L concentration) into each well, enough to cover the bottom of the well uniformly, typically >100 µL for a 96-well plate and >30 µL for a 384-well plate.",
    "Pipette analytes (e.g., 2 µL, 100 µM final volume) from screening library into the well plates. Prepare each analyte in triplicate to account for potential well-to-well variation, fluctuations of excitation intensity, or temperature.\nRaise the objective (e.g., 20X achroplan, 0.45 NA) while monitoring the emission spectra using the spectrometer and InGaAs array. Optimal position of the objective will put the focal plane approximately in the middle of the sample volume in the well, which should correspond to a maximum in measured intensity.\nFor each sample well, record a 1-10 s exposure to collect a spectrum.\nCompare the emission spectra for each well to a control containing just SWNTs without additional analyte to quantify the fluorescence response.\nSubscription Required.
