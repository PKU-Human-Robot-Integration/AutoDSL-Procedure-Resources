    "This protocol is approved by and follows the guidelines of the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board for human subjects research. It is critically important that all procedures involving MR equipment are performed by adequately trained personnel adhering to the highest standards of MR safety59.\n1. Materials and Preparation\nEnsure that all necessary materials are available prior to the experiment (Figure 2).\nPlug the 31P coil into the in-table coil connector at the end of the exam table closest to the bore. Place a large triangle foam cushion near the head of the MR exam table, but not directly on the 31P coil. Place a head pillow at the other end of the MR exam table, farthest from the bore, for subject comfort.\n2. Subject Positioning (Figure 3a)\nInstruct the subject to lie supine, feet first on the MR table. Place a foam cushion under the knees to support the leg in a partially flexed position.\nPosition the subject close to the right side of the table (the subject's right) in order to center the left thigh as closely to the magnet isocenter as possible, thus ensuring optimal B0 homogeneity in the thigh muscle under examination. Provide the subject with ear plugs and/or headphones.\nPosition the 31P RF coil on the left quadriceps at approximately the midpoint between the patella and the femoral head, and secure to the leg using straps. Place the coil over the lateral portion of the leg, above the vastus lateralis.\nSecure the baby oil to the medial aspect of the thigh with the same straps used to secure the coil to the leg. This facilitates scan localization.",
    "Bind the subject's legs together with a strap placed below the coil and above the knee. Secure the subject's legs to the MR table with additional straps, one above the knee and one midway between the knee and ankle.\nUse the laser light guide to delineate the center of the coil and move the table to the magnet isocenter using this centering landmark.\n3. Exercise Protocol\nExplain to the subject that the exercise protocol consists of three phases: an initial, baseline phase; a short, intense exercise phase; and a recovery phase.\nInstruct the subject to lie still and relax their leg muscles during the baseline and recovery phases of the spectroscopy acquisition in order to minimize motion artifacts.\nProvide a countdown to the subject indicating the start of exercise. At this point, have the subject initiate knee extension/flexion as forcefully and as rapidly as possible against the resistance of the straps.\n\tNOTE: The quadriceps muscles are used to move the left lower leg up and down, until instructed to stop.\nTerminate exercise after a 30% drop in the PCr peak height.\n\t\nObserve the PCr peak height in the acquisition viewer window, and also view it upon completion of the exercise sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: A general guideline is that an approximate 30% drop in PCr peak height corresponds to a Pi peak that is 50% of the height of the PCr peak. If PCr depletion is not occurring rapidly enough to achieve a 30% drop during the exercise phase of the exam, encourage the subject to kick harder or faster while exercising.\n\t\tNOTE: Cessation of exercise is determined by monitoring the PCr peak height and duration of exercise. This may result in slightly different durations of exercise in different patients and can be accounted for in the analysis.\n4. Scan Protocol",
    "Acquire a tri-plane localizer to verify proper subject positioning and identify the location of the 31P coil.\n\tNOTE: The localizer sequence begins automatically and centers at the indicated position using the laser light guide (step 2.9)\nAcquire a second tri-plane localizer.\n\t\nOpen the slice view on the first tri-plane localizer images.\n\t\tNOTE: This process may be different for different software and hardware systems.\nCenter and rotate the slice orientation by left-clicking and holding on the slice group. Rotate the slice group. Ensure that the final orientation of slices matches with the position of the baby oil.\nIn the sequence routine window, increase the number of slices to cover the entire leg in the axial and sagittal images (Figure 3b).\n31P spectroscopy sequence:\n\t\nUse the following non-localized pulse-acquire sequence parameters: TR: 1,000 msec; TE: 0.34 msec; spectral width: 2,000 Hz; flip angle: 90 degrees; acquired data points: 1,024; 4 averages resulting in a time resolution of 1 spectrum every 6 sec.\n31P shim box placement:\n\t\nUsing a mouse, drag the second triplane localizer images into the viewing window at the top of the screen. Drag the spectroscopy sequence into the protocol window and double-click to open.\nUse the position tool bar to visualize the shim voxel (select the black rectangle with horizontal lines). After selecting this option, observe a green box on the localizer images.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the shim voxel.\nMove the voxel by left-clicking and holding the voxel in the center. Change the size and rotate the orientation of the voxel by left-clicking and holding the voxel at the corner of the box. Place the shim box so as to ensure B0 field homogeneity directly below the coil and parallel to the plane of the quadriceps.",
    "NOTE: This is to ensure proper shimming within the sensitive region under the coil, which is the volume of tissue directly below the center of the coil.\nUse the tri-plane localizer images to identify the sensitive region of the coil and adjust the shim box to encompass this region within the quadriceps muscle.\n\t\tNOTE: The shim box can be larger than the true coverage of the surface coil in order to ensure B0 homogeneity within the data acquisition voxel (Figure 3c).\n31P test acquisition:\n\t\t\nOpen the acquisition viewer window and select the head icon in the acquisition tool bar. This will allow for viewing of the spectroscopy acquisition in real time.\nAfter placement of the 31P shim voxel, run the sequence to obtain a single spectrum by clicking the \"run\" button at the top of the protocol window.\nExamine the quality of B0 shimming. Observe the resulting spectrum in the acquisition window. Observe a prominent PCr peak centered at 0 ppm and no significant noise (Figure 4a, left).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Troubleshooting: If the spectrum appears noisy, ensure that the shim box is placed within muscle. Adjust the size and position of the shim box to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Repeat the test acquisition as needed.\nIn order to see the PCr peak height, open the spectrum in the spectroscopy tool (\"Applications\" → \"Spectroscopy\"). Open the patient's folder (folder tree icon), select the appropriate scan, and double-click to load the spectrum.\nPre-exercise T1 image:\n\t\nObtain a single-slice axial T1-weighted image at the center of a coil.\n31P pre-exercise acquisition:\n\t\nCopy the sequence from step 4.4 (that produced the best spectral quality) by left-clicking and dragging the sequence in the protocol window. Use this sequence for all subsequent measurements.",
    "In the sequence routine window, increase the number of measurements from 1 to 10. Select run to acquire 10 measurements while the subject is at rest.\n31P exercise acquisition:\n\tNOTE: Make careful note of the start and end exercise times, as this will be important for analysis.\n\t\nRest: Apply the shim settings from the previous scan and set the sequence to acquire 20 measurements. Instruct the subject to begin kicking after a countdown. Instruct the subject to remain at rest for 2 measurements.\nExercise: Ask the subject to perform the knee extension exercise for ~ 30 sec (or the time required to achieve a 30% decrease in the PCr peak amplitude). After the subject achieves sufficient PCr depletion, ask them to rest.\n31P post-exercise acquisitions:\n\t\nAcquire an additional 20 measurements at rest. Ensure that the post-exercise acquisitions begin immediately following the exercise sequence, without pause or shimming (Figure 4a, right).\n\t\tNOTE: The subdivision of this recovery period into two separate acquisitions permits the analysis of the initial 20 dynamic spectra during the acquisition of the second 20 dynamic spectra, allowing the operator to avoid acquisition of the full recovery period if the exercise needs to be repeated.\nEnsuring exercise quality:\n\t\nCompare the PCr peak heights at the beginning and end of exercise. High-quality exercise sessions result in a ~ 30% decrease in the PCr concentration.\nVerify that the PCr peak height is the same at beginning of rest and at the end of recovery (typically, < 10% difference is desired). This ensures that there was negligible loss of field homogeneity during acquisition.",
    "NOTE: If the PCr breakdown is insufficient, or if there has been a loss of field homogeneity, then repeat the exercise/recovery portion of the exam (taking care to avoid fatigue), ensure that the coil and straps are securely attached, and extend the duration of exercise and/or encourage more vigorous exercise (Figure 4b).\n\t\tNOTE: A comparison of the images obtained in steps 6 and 11 permits an additional quality control step to visualize any displacement of the thigh and coil due to the exercise, thus ensuring that minimal motion occurred during the protocol, which could significantly affect the acquired data.\nFollowing post-exercise T1 imaging, repeat the pre-exercise axial T1 imaging (step 4.5) using the same acquisition parameters.\n\t\nIn addition to sufficient depletion of PCr, measure the end exercise pH to ensure that the exercise did not induce acidosis of the muscle.\nPerform this by measuring the chemical shift between Pi and PCr (δPi) and using the following equation60:\n\t\tpH = 6.77 + log[(δPi-3.29)/(5.68-δPi)]\n\t\tNOTE: The pH should remain greater than 6.861. If the PCr breakdown is sufficient but the pH is too low, repeat the exercise bout for a shorter duration and/or with a decreased intensity.\nSaving Data:\n\t\nSave all acquired spectra as DICOM files and export them for processing using JMRUI.\nIf using a scanner, select all spectroscopy acquisitions in the \"Navigator\" window.\nUnder \"Applications,\" select \"Dicom Tools\" → \"Export MR Spectroscopy,\" and save the DICOM (*.dcm) files to C:/User/MedCom/temp/CDROFFLINE\n\t\t(the tool automatically chooses this location).\nUnder \"Transfer,\" select \"Export to Offline.\" Save to the desired location.\n5. Data Processing and Analysis62\nAnalyze the MR spectra with freely-available JMRUI software (version 5.2; http://www.jmrui.eu/).",
    "Apodize and phase shift the spectra to ensure uniformity over all acquired time points (Figure 5). The PCr peak will be centered at 0 ppm in the spectra.\nUse the built-in AMARES algorithm to quantify the amplitude of the PCr peak in each acquired spectrum. The peak amplitude represents the concentration of PCr within the sensitive region of the surface coil at that particular time point.\nIn the computational software, plot the PCr concentrations as a function of acquisition time. Using the built-in computational software curve-fit tool, fit the PCr recovery period data to the following equation52,63:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54977/54977eq1.jpg\nRecord the values of the baseline PCr (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54977/54977eq2.jpg), the lowest PCr (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54977/54977eq3.jpg), and the recovery time(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54977/54977eq4.jpg.\nEnsure that the appropriate conditions are met during the exercise session by calculating the PCr depletion, the percent difference between the baseline PCr and the lowest PCr. Ideal exercise sessions result in a 20 - 50% depletion.\n\tNOTE: The quality of the curve fitting can be ensured by verifying that the R2 value is greater than 0.75. R2 values are automatically calculated by the fitting software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
