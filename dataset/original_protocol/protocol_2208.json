    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol provides a framework to decipher principles of folliculogenesis. To reach this goal, single-cell genomics followed by well-controlled in vitro cultures to relate comprehensive transcriptome data to causal mechanisms. This protocol involves 5 sections. Section 1: preparation of single metaphase II oocytes and cumulus cells from ovulatory follicles[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] and section 2: preparation of single growing oocytes, fully grown oocytes and ovarian somatic cells from growing and antral follicles[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] are detailed methods to prepare follicular cell suspension for single-cell RNA-seq in section 3: single-cell RNA-seq library construction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]. Section 4: isolating preantral follicles and culturing up to maturation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] and section 5: isolating immature granulosa cells for in vitro culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] offer detailed methods for follicle and follicular cell culture and depend on preference of researchers to follow this protocol.\nSection 1: Preparation of single metaphase II oocytes and cumulus cells from ovulatory follicles.\nSection 2: Preparation of single growing oocytes, fully grown oocytes and ovarian somatic cells from growing and antral follicles.\nSection 3: Single-cell RNA-seq library construction.\nSection 4: Isolating preantral follicles and culturing up to maturation.\nSection 5: Isolating immature granulosa cells for in vitro culture.\nCritical: When preparing a hand-pulled micro capillary pipette for manipulating oocytes, the internal diameter of the opening should be slightly larger than an oocyte (∼100–120 μm); and the opening tip need to be polished by swiftly touching a flame. This is important for removal of zona by brief Tyrode’s exposure without damaging oocytes. Handling these samples needs much practice.\nSection 1: Preparation of single metaphase II oocytes and cumulus cells from ovulatory follicles\nTiming: ∼0.5–1 h",
    "Approximately 15–16 h after hCG injection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), humanely cull the mouse and place on an absorbent pad. Open abdominal cavity, cut peritoneum, and put back digestive system to expose reproductive organs, including two ovaries, two oviducts and two horns of uterus for each mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1817-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar, 50 μm.\nGrasp the upper end of uterus and gently pull away from body, make the first cut between uterus and utero-tubal junction (a narrow tube connects uterus and oviduct). Relocate the forceps near to utero-tubal junction, then a second cut is made between infundibulum of oviduct (the opening of oviduct) and ovary (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Repeat to cut off the other side of oviduct. Put oviducts into a drop of M2 medium in a 35-mm Petri dish.\nNote: Prewarm M2 medium at 37°C for 5 min right before use.\nCritical: Pay attention not to break oviduct during dissection.",
    "Use a pair of fine forceps to grasp isthmus and hold oviduct on the bottom of the Petri dish, immerse the oviduct in a drop of M2 medium. Use the second pair of fine forceps to tear ampulla (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C1) where cumulus-oocyte complexes are located, releasing the clutches of cumulus-oocyte complexes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C2).\nCritical: In response to injection of gonadotropins, ampulla is usually swollen and transparent to be easily identified under a dissecting microscope.\nUse a 20-μL tip to dispense 2 drops (20-μL) of hyaluronidase medium and 2 drops (20-μL) of M2 medium on the bottom of a 35-mm Petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nTransfer the collected cumulus-oocyte complexes by using forceps into the first drop of hyaluronidase. Under a dissecting microscope, incubate cumulus-oocyte complexes in hyaluronidase solution for 2–3 min (no more than 5 min) until the cumulus cells start to loosen. Oocytes surrounded by more sticky cumulus cells should be transferred by a finely pulled glass pipette into a second fresh drop of hyaluronidase, observe until cumulus cells fall off.\nNote: For oocyte surrounded by cumulus cells that are easily shed, only the first drop of hyaluronidase is needed. For stickier cumulus cells, transfer of cumulus-oocyte complexes into the second fresh drop of hyaluronidase is important to minimize exposure time in hyaluronidase. Pipette up and down with Pasteur pipette for a few times helps.\nUse a hand pipette, pick up the dissociated individual oocytes and granulosa cells into a fresh drop of M2 medium and perform two washes in M2 medium droplets.\nUse a 20-μL tip to dispense 2 drops (20-μL) of Tyrode’s medium and 2 drops (20-μL) of M2 medium on the bottom of a 35-mm Petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Transfer a group of 10–12 oocytes into the first Tyrode’s drop, pipette up and down for 3–5 times, further transfer the oocytes into the second Tyrode’s drop, observe until zona pellucida gradually becomes thinning and disappears. Representative pictures of oocytes with zone before Tyrode’s treatment and without zona after Tyrode’s treatment are shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F1 and F2, respectively.\nNote: Expunge the remaining medium in the hand Pasteur pipette into a blank Petri dish (for waste collection) before refill it with new Tyrode’s medium, as any trance of M2 carried would neutralize Tyrode’s effects.\nUse a Pasteur pipette to pick up the zona-free oocytes into a drop of M2 medium to wash, then repeat once in another drop of M2.\nUse a 20-μL tip to dispense several drops (20-μL) of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (dissolved in 1 × DPBS).\nUse a Pasteur pipette to transfer granulosa cells (from step 6) and zona-free oocytes (from step 9) sequentially through two drops of 0.1% BSA (dissolved in 1 × DPBS) to perform washes.\nPick single oocytes or granulosa cells into lysis buffer that is ready to prepare single-cell cDNA (complementary DNA).\nNote: Promptly pick disaggregated single cells into lysis buffer and keep them immediately on ice.\nSection 2: Preparation of single growing oocytes, fully grown oocytes, and ovarian somatic cells from growing and antral follicles\nTiming: ∼1–1.5 h\nApproximately 42–44 h after injection of a single shot of PMSG, collect secondary follicles from ovaries of 3- to 4-week-old mice; collect secondary and antral follicles from ovaries of 7- to 8-week-old mice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1817-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(C) Sequential steps to remove zona pellucida.\n(D) Individual oocytes and ovarian somatic cells are picked for single-cell RNA-seq.\nOvaries are dissected, carefully trimmed, and chopped into 0.5-mm3 cubes.\nNote: The following digestive volume is recommended for 2 ovaries to ensure optimal performance.\nUse a two-stage of digestion procedure to prepare single cell suspension. Digest the minced ovaries in 400μL 1 mg/mL Type IV collagenase at 37°C under 1,000 × rpm for 20 min in a ThermoMixer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSpin at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature and discard the resulting supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 400 μL of prewarmed TrypLE Express at 37°C under 1,000× rpm for 10–15 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Observe under a dissecting microscope to monitor status of cells during dissociation. It is important to gently homogenize by intermitting pipetting every 7–8 min during digestion.\nCritical: Visualize cell suspensions is important for evaluation of cell viability. If cell aggregates are observed, one should perform further gentle pipetting; if debris is observed, one should perform filtering. Once single-cell suspensions are obtained, promptly process to stop digestion. Avoid over incubation in digestive enzymes to avoid damaging cells or lysing.\nStop digestion by adding 400μL of prewarmed M2 medium, pipette the resulting cell suspension and transfer it into a 35-mm Petri dish, at this point single somatic cells or single oocytes could be obtained.\nUse a 20-μL tip to dispense 2 drops (20-μL) of M2 medium on the bottom of a 35-mm Petri dish.\nUse a hand glass pipette, pick up the dissociated individual oocytes and somatic cells into a fresh drop of M2 medium and perform two washes in M2 medium droplets.",
    "Use a 20-μL tip to dispense 2 drops (20-μL) of Tyrode’s medium and 2 drops (20-μL) of M2 medium on the bottom of a 35-mm Petri dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRemove zona pellucida encapsulating growing oocytes by Tyrode’s solution, and then wash zona-free oocytes immediately through 2 drops of M2 medium.\nWash somatic cells (from step 20) and zona-free oocytes (from step 22) in 0.1% BSA (dissolved in 1 × DPBS).\nPick individual zona-free oocytes or somatic cells into lysis buffer that is ready to prepare single-cell cDNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Promptly pick disaggregated single cells into lysis buffer and keep them immediately on ice.\nSection 3: Single-cell RNA-seq library construction\nTiming: ∼2 days\nIndividual single cells from step 12 or step 24 are manually picked into individual 0.2-mL PCR tubes by a hand glass pipette, vortex thoroughly for 30 s, incubate at 72°C for 3 min in a Thermal Cycler, then immediately place on ice.\nAdd 2.85 μL reverse transcription (RT) mix to each sample.\nVortex briefly and spin down at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, perform PCR in a Thermal Cycler as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1817_17.csv\nAdd 7.5 μL PCR preamplification mix to each reaction.\nVortex briefly and spin down at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, perform PCR in a Thermal Cycler as below to amplify cDNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1817_18.csv\nPool 4 μL of each cDNA sample with different barcodes (up to 96 barcodes) together.\nPurify once with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol, elute in 50 μL elution buffer. Purify twice with 0.8 × Ampure XP beads, elute in 21 μL elution buffer.\nCheck size distribution of cDNA samples by a Fragment Analyzer (AATI). The profile of a successful cDNA sample should have a peak at around 1.5 kb (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).",
    "Use 30–40 ng cDNAs as template, add 29 μL index PCR mix, with Biotin index primer to perform a second amplification.\nPerform PCR in a Thermal Cycler as below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1817_19.csv\nThe biotinylated cDNAs are purified once with 0.8× Ampure XP beads, elute in 30 μL elution buffer.\nPause point: The cDNA samples can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for 8 weeks or longer.\nShear cDNAs into 300-bp fragments by an ultrasonicator (Covaris) according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nPurify once with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol, elute in 50 μL elution buffer. Enriched by using Dynabeads® MyOneTM Streptavidin C1.\nConstruct RNA-seq libraries by using NEBNext UltraII DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina according to manufacturer’s instructions. Use QP2 primer and Short Universal Primer to conduct final library PCR amplification.\nPool the final RNA-seq libraries together, measure concentration by the Qubit Fluorometer, check size distribution and process to sequence. The expected average size of final libraries is around 200–800 bp, with a peak occurs at around 400 bp. The yield of the library is usually more than 100 ng.\nPause point: The RNA libraries can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for 8 weeks or longer.\nFor space limitation, we do not provide data analysis details for scRNA-seq data, which covers many aspects by a well-designed project. For detailed computational methods, tools and a comprehensive guide for analysis of scRNA sequencing data, please refer to (Andrews et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nSection 4: Isolating preantral follicles and culturing up to maturation\nTiming: ∼6.5 days",
    "Note: How different systems should be chosen according to aim of the study is reviewed in (Simon et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). In this protocol, to trace growth of each individual follicle, the selected follicles are cultured singly into each well of a 96-well microplate; to avoid any perturbations to lyophilic steroids signalling, the follicles are cultured without mineral oil overlay.\nTo verify candidate factors instructing granulosa-theca interactions or stepwise transition across folliculogenesis, prepuberty mice at 14 days are used to isolate immature follicles for culture. At this age, early preantral follicles predominate, only a few follicles reach antral stage, no corpus lutea forms yet.\nPrepare culture medium for follicle culture (see in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nSterilize surgery tools and pipettes by heating them in a sterilization oven in advance.\nDissect ovaries from 14-day-old female mice, trim and transfer them into L15 medium supplied with 10% FBS and 1 × penicillin-streptomycin.\nNote: Make sure the following steps to dissociate follicles for culture are performed in sterile conditions.\nTransfer ovaries to a laminated-flow hood, immerse them in L15 medium supplied with 10% FBS and 1 × penicillin-streptomycin (15–20 μL medium for 2 ovaries), and mechanically chop into small pieces with a metal blade.\nNote: To preserve follicular integrity and investigate intra-follicle cell-cell interactions, preantral follicles are released mainly by mechanical dissection with only brief collagenase treatment, rather than enzymic digestion.\nIncubate minced ovary tissue in 1 mg/mL Type IV collagenase, at 37°C under 1000× rpm for 10–15 min in a ThermoMixer, to dissociate connective tissues (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). A representative picture showing chopped ovary tissue transferred into Type IV collagenase at the start of digestion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1817-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

IF, immunofluorescence.\nSpin at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature, resuspend the resulting pellet in L15 medium and transfer them into a 35-mm Petri dish.\nReleased individual intact follicles are manually picked by using a hand pipette, based on two criteria: (1) with diameters around 120 μm; (2) oocyte located centrally within the follicle and is surrounded by 1–2 layers of granulosa cells, a basal membrane, and a layer of thecal cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUnder a dissecting microscope, pool the picked follicles and sequentially wash them through three 50-μL drops of L15 medium by a hand pipette, then randomly assign to different treatment groups.\nNote: Perform washes <30 min if possible.\nUse a 20-μL tip to dispense a 20-μL drop of follicle culture medium in each well of a 96-well plate. Culture the follicles singly in each well of a 96-well plate in an incubator at 37°C containing 5% CO2, designating as day 1 of culture.\nOn day 2 of culture, further add 10 μL medium to each follicle droplet; thereafter refresh 10 μL of old medium with fresh medium in each follicle droplet every other day.\nPerform morphological evaluation under a microscope every day until day 6 of culture.",
    "Note: In normal conditions, follicles can growth and expand to form a well-organized structure onset of antrum-like cavity formation. In this in vitro setting, phenotypes like initiation of granulosa-cell death under certain treatment could suggest a role of the treatment. We have previously used this system to study function of Notch signalling pathway in affecting folliculogenesis (Gu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nAlternatives: Morphological evaluation provides a convenient, time-sequential while relatively gross assessment of follicle growth. If needed, histological characteristics of sections of the cultured follicles could provide a detailed phenotype, for example, whether and when atresia and cell death of granulosa cells initiates (Cortvrindt et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSection 5: Isolating immature granulosa cells for in vitro culture\nTiming: ∼2.5 days\nGranulosa cells isolated from immature follicles for in vitro culture are neat to circumvent its intrinsic and substantial heterogeneity during in vivo growth, thus provide a way to directly assess factors affecting granulosa differentiation.\nNote: Prepuberty mice between postnatal days 12–14 are used to isolate immature granulosa cells for culture.\nPrepare granulosa cells culture medium (see in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nCollect preantral follicles as described in step 40 to step 46.\nIncubate the collected preantral follicles in 400μL TrypLE Express at 37°C for 10–15 min, and gently pipette to liberate follicular cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nStop digestion by adding an equal volume of M2 medium.\nSpin at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the resulting supernatant. Resuspend cells with M2 medium.\nFilter cell suspension through a 30-μm cell strainer to obtain granulosa cells.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspend the pellet in granulosa cells growth medium.",
    "Seed cells in a 24-well plate and the plating density is 1 × 106 cells/well. Culture cells in granulosa cells growth medium, allowing cells to adhere for 3 h in an incubator at 37°C containing 5% CO2.\nGranulosa cells are starved for 4 h in granulosa cells starvation medium prior to the beginning of experiment treatment. According to what treatment needed, add the substance in granulosa cells starvation medium for further culture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D)."
