    "Hepatocyte culture and infection with HBVHBV preparation and measurement of HBV virus titers:Seed Huh7 cells to 10-cm dish as 1 x 106 cells/dish with DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-incubator.After 24 h culture, per dish of Huh7 cells are transfected with 10 μg HBV plasmid (pUC19-HBV-C) in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol. At 3 days after transfection, harvest the media in 50 ml tube and clear by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant contains the HBV can be stocked at -80 °C until use for infection. For detection the HBV DNA copies of the harvested supernatant, 100 μl supernatant mixed with 1 μl MgOAc (600 mM), 0.5 μl RNase A (20 mg/ml), 1 μl DNase I (1 unit/μl) and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C to remove the HBV plasmid. The reaction is terminated by adding 2 μl EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0) and incubation for 10 min at 65 °C. Then the HBV DNA is extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, and HBV titers are determined by qPCR as described below (Procedure C. qPCR for quantification of HBV DNA).Seed cells for HBV infection:PHHs are purchased from PhoenixBio Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan) and seeded on biocoat collagen I cellware 12-well plate with 1 ml of PHHs culture medium as 1 x 105 cells/well. HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells are generated by Drs. Takaji Wakita and Koichi Watashi (Iwamoto et al., 2014), and seeded on 12-well tissue culture plate with 1 ml of HepG2-hNTCP-C4 culture medium as 1x105 cells/well. The cells are cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-incubator.",
    "HBV infection:After 24 h, PHHs or HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells are incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with HBV stock aliquots containing the appropriate number of genome equivalents (GEq), which are diluted with 1 ml of culture medium supplemented with 4% PEG 8000. At the end of the incubation, cells are washed three times with culture medium, and harvested for analysis. Note: PHHs or HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells are infected at 10 or 100 GEq/cell, respectively. Encapsidated HBV DNA extractionRemove culture medium, wash cells twice with cold PBS.Add lysis buffer 300 μl/well.Shake with 200 rpm/min for 20 min at cold room (4 °C) to disrupt cells.Transfer all cell lysates to new 1.5 ml tubes. Pellet nuclei and insoluble fractions by centrifugation (15,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 2 min. Harvest the supernatants to new 1.5 ml tubes (on ice).Make a mixture in the following order:table:",

(After this step, the sample can be kept at 4 °C).Add 30 μl EDTA (100 mM, pH 8.0) and incubate for 15 min at 65 °C to stop the reaction.Centrifuge for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, and then harvest all supernatants to new tubes.Make a mixture in the following order:table:\n﻿0,1,2\nMix order,,Volume (μl)\n1,Sample supernatant,330\n2,10% SDS,40\n3,Nuclease free-H2O,18\n4,5M NaCl,8\n5,Proteinase K (20 mg/ml),4\n,Total,400",
    "Incubate the mixture sample for 2 h at 55 °C to digest the HBV core protein and release the viral genome from core particles.Add 400 μl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and vortex thoroughly for approximately 1 min.Centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at room temperature. Carefully transfer the upper layer to a new tube. Add 400 μl chloroform and vortex thoroughly for approximately 1 min.Centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at room temperature. Carefully transfer the upper layer to a new tube.Add 40 μl NaOAc (3 M, pH 5.2), 1 μl glycogen (20 μg/μl) and 400 μl isopropanol.Simply vortex and place on ice for 20 min.Centrifuge for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Add 500 μl of 70% ethanol, centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant as much as possible.Dry the pellet for 20 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet with 100 μl Nuclease free-H2O and briefly spin to collect the sample. (The purified encapsidated HBV DNA can be stock at -20 °C.)qPCR for quantification of HBV DNAPrepare HBV DNA standard sample: The HBV plasmid (pUC19-HBV) is subjected to a 10-fold serial dilutions in Nuclease free-H2O ranging from 0.2 x 103 to 109 copies/μl (1 μg HBV plasmid (pUC19-HBV) contains 1.46 x 1011 DNA copies, http://www.endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php[href=http://www.endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php]). And these diluted samples are used to construct a standard curve for the quantification of HBV DNA. Make a 100-fold dilution of the purified encapsidated HBV DNA samples with Nuclease free-H2O for each qPCR template.Set up the following reaction mixtures for qPCR analysis to measure the copy number of HBV DNA (for one sample):table:\n﻿0,1\nNuclease free-H2O,3.8 μl\n2x SYBR Premix Ex Taq,10 μl\n50x ROX reference dye,0.4 μl\nForward primer (10 μM),0.4 μl",
