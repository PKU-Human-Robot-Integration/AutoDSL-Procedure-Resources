    "Ethics statement: Animals are treated and cared for according to the guidelines of the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues of IASP11. The protocol is approved by the institutional Ethical Committee.\n1. Subjects\nUse male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g at arrival).\nHouse rats in solid-bottom cages in a colony room with a humidity of 40-60% and a RT of 21 ± 1 °C.\nMake water and food available at libitum.\nKeep rats under a reversed 12:12 hr dark/light cycle (lights on at 20 hr).\n2. Surgery\nPer rat, prepare two pieces of chromic gut ligature (5-0) of approximately 6 cm long and place them in sterile saline to avoid drying and becoming stiff and brittle.\nAnesthetize the animal with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and treat with atropine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Monitor the level of anesthesia by extending one leg and pinching the web of skin between the toes with a fingernail to ensure adequate pressure is applied. Ensure that the animal does not flex its limb. If necessary, administer additional pentobarbital.\nShave the head of the rat so that a mid-line scalp incision can be made of approximately 25 mm with equal distances anterior and posterior to the center of the eyes.\nFix the rat’s head in a stereotaxic frame or otherwise fixate the rat’s head. Place the rat on a heated pad to maintain body temperature.\nApply ophthalmic ointment on both eyes to prevent damage from drying.\nScrub the shaved head area with alcohol, then betadine.\nMake a mid-line scalp incision, exposing skull and nasal bone.\nUse an operation microscope to perform steps 2.9 to 2.16.",
    "Dissect the edge of the orbit free, formed by the maxillary, frontal, lacrimal and zygomatic bones, using a cotton-tipped swab and a pair of Dumont forceps. Use the swab to soak up blood from possible bleeding.\nTo give access to the IoN, gently deflect the orbital contents with a precision cotton swab, taking care not to overstretch the anterior ethmoidal nerve which crosses superior to the IoN. Dissect the IoN free from the surrounding connective tissue, using a precision cotton-tipped swab and a pair of Dumont forceps using a spreading motion. Use the swab to soak up blood from possible bleeding.\nTo perform a ligation, push one end of a single piece of chromic gut downward along the frontal bone, medial to the IoN and advance a few millimeters parallel and inferior to the IoN. The ligature is now held in place between the IoN and the frontal bone.\nSlip the tip of a 45 degree angled Dumont forceps under the IoN to place it in close proximity to the ligature. Gently retract the IoN laterally to reveal the ligature and tip of the forceps. Grip the ligature with the forceps and withdraw the forceps laterally from under the IoN.\nPull out the ligature from the orbital cavity until both ends of the ligature are more or less equidistant from the IoN.\nMake a “slip knot” from the two ends of the ligature to allow perfect control over the degree of constriction and slide the knot against the IoN. Slide the knot further to constrict the IoN so that the diameter of the nerve is reduced by a just noticeable amount. Make a normal knot on top of the slip knot so that the amount of constriction remains constant (i.e., to prevent the slit knot from slipping).",
    "Cut the ligatures to leave approximately 2 mm of free ends from the knot.\nRepeat the same procedure (steps 2.11 to 2.15) to make a second ligation 2 mm apart from the first.\nFor sham surgery, perform steps 2.2 to 2.10.\nClose the scalp incision using polyester sutures (4-0) and allow the rat to recover on a heated pad. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and do not return the animal to the company of other animals until it is fully recovered.\nTo avoid pre-emptive analgesic effects on the development of neuropathic pain, do not administer analgesia for post-surgical pain.\n3. Behavioral Test Procedure\nAllow rats to acclimate for at least 8 days to the housing conditions before pre-operative testing.\nHabituate rats to the test procedure at least once daily for three days before pre-operative testing.\nConduct testing in a darkened room with light provided by a 60 W red light bulb suspended 1 m above the center of the test area lighting the center but leaving the circumference dim and the remainder of the room dark.\nMake sure there is sufficient background noise to decrease interference from sudden auditory stimulation. If necessary, provide white noise.\nObservation of face grooming behavior\n\t\nTransport a single rat from the colony to the test room in a covered plastic cage without bedding. Note: Ideally, this should be a short trip with minimal external stimuli.\nPlace the rat in a covered, transparent plastic cage without bedding (l x w x h: 24 cm x 14 cm x 17 cm) with a mirrored back in front of a video camera.\nMake a 10 min recording of the animal’s behavior. During recording, make sure the experimenter is not present in the test room.",
    "Clean the observation cage before placing the next animal.\nMake sure the recorded behavior is analyzed by an experimenter who is blind to the experimental condition of the rat.\nMake a record of each face grooming episode during the 10 min recording. Note: Face grooming is defined as movement patterns in which forepaws are brought in contact with facial areas.\nMake a distinction between two types of face grooming behavior. If a sequence is neither preceded nor followed by body grooming (i.e., grooming of a body area other than the face), categorize the episode as isolated face grooming. If body grooming is performed immediately before or after face grooming, categorize the episode as face grooming during body grooming.\nDetermine the number of face grooming episodes.\n\t\t\nCategorize a time period between face grooming actions that does not exceed 4 sec as an intra-episode space (i.e., a pause between face grooming actions within a single episode).\nCategorize a time period between face grooming actions that exceeds 4 sec as an inter-episode space (i.e., a complete interruption of face grooming actions between two episodes).\nMechanical stimulation testing\n\t\nTransport rats in groups of up to 6 animals from the colony to the test room in a covered cage with bedding. Ensure that this is a short trip with minimal external stimuli.\nPlace the rats individually in transparent plastic cages with bedding (l x w x h: 24 cm x 14 cm x 17 cm) with a hinged lid so that it can be easily opened and closed.\nUse a graded series of five von Frey hairs. Note: The force required to bend the hairs is 0.015 g, 0.127 g, 0.217 g, 0.745 g and 2.150 g.",
    "Habituate the rats to the observation cage and reaching movements for 10 min. Every 30 sec, open the lid and gently touch the wall of the cage with a plastic rod.\nWhen the animal is in a sniffing/ no locomotion state (i.e., with four paws placed on the ground, neither moving nor freezing, but exhibiting sniffing behavior), apply the first von Frey hair within the IoN territory near the center of the vibrissal pad, on the hairy skin surrounding the mystacial vibrissae.\nScore the response of the animal to the stimulation to belong to one of the following response categories4.\n\t\t\nCategorize a complete lack of response as score 0.\nCategorize a stimulus detection (i.e., the rat turns the head toward the stimulating object and the stimulus object is then explored) as score 1.\nCategorize a withdrawal reaction (i.e., the rat turns the head slowly away or pulls it briskly backward when the stimulation is applied, sometimes a single face wipe ipsilateral to the stimulated area occurs) as score 2.\nCategorize an escape/attack response (i.e., the rat avoids further contact with the stimulus object, either passively by moving its body away from the stimulating object to assume a crouching position against the cage wall, or actively by attacking the stimulus object, making biting and grabbing movements) as score 3.\nCategorize asymmetric face grooming (i.e., the rat displays an uninterrupted series of at least three face-wash strokes directed toward the stimulated facial area) as score 4.",
    "Within each animal, apply stimuli in an ascending order of intensity. After a stimulus intensity has been applied to one side, apply it to the other side before moving on to the next stimulus intensity. Randomize the order in which the ipsilateral and contralateral sides are stimulated. Note that the animal must be in a sniffing/ no locomotion state before each stimulation.\nSubscription Required.
