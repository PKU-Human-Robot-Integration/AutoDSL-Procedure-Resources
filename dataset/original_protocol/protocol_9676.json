    "1. Bone-ink fabrication\nSynthesis of α-tricalcium phosphate\n\t\nWeigh out calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO4) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) powders in a 3:2 Ca:P molar ratio. Using a spatula, thoroughly homogenize the two powders.\nAdd the calcium hydrogen phosphate-calcium carbonate powder mixture to a zirconia crucible such that it is no more than 75% full.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid contamination, use a new crucible or a crucible previously used to make the same material. To clean, rinse with 100% ethanol and air-dry in a fume hood until completely dry before adding the powders.\nTransfer the crucible to a furnace. Heat to 1,400 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and hold for 3 h.\nQuench the reaction by removing the crucible from the furnace and leave it atop a refractory block. Allow it to cool completely before handling.\n\t\tNOTE: Use crucible tongs of an appropriate length and ensure adequate heat protection.\nUse a mortar and pestle to break and grind the α-TCP cake such that the resulting granules have a maximum size of 200 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a standard stainless-steel sieve to ensure correct particle size.\nFurther grind the granules using a planetary mill in two stages. First, add 3 mm yttria-stabilized zirconia balls in a weight ratio of 8:1 balls:powder, then 100% ethanol in a weight ratio of 3:1 ethanol:powder. Secure the lid and grind for 2 h at 180 rpm.\nCollect the suspension and separate the balls, using 100% ethanol for washing.\nDry the suspension in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h.\nAdd the dried powder to milling jars with 1 mm zirconia balls and 100% ethanol in the same weight ratios as in the first stage. Grind for 2 h at 180 rpm, separate, and dry.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire synthesis procedure is represented in Figure 1A.",
    "Formulation of bone-ink\n\t\nTo make the bone-ink, add 2 g of α-TCP powder to a ball mill jar that contains 630 µL of glycerol and 130 µL of polysorbate 80 whilst continuously stirring with a spatula.\nAdd 100 mg of ammonium phosphate dibasic ((NH4)2HPO4, APD) and stir to combine.\n\t\tNOTE: Excessive residue of liquid phases left on the spatula will result in a ratio imbalance of the ink components and, hence, the kinetics of setting.\nAdd a 25 mm zirconia ball, secure the lid, and place it inside a planetary mill for 60 min at 180 rpm, pausing halfway to scrape down the sides of the jar with a spatula.\nUsing a spatula, load the ink into a 1 mL syringe. Wrap adequately to avoid contact with moisture. Store at −20 °C if not used immediately.\nBone-ink microstructure characterization\n\t\nPrint the bone-ink in deionized water and allow to set for 5 min.\nWash the sample 3x with 100% ethanol and allow it to dry completely.\nCoat with a thin layer (15 nm thickness) of gold.\nCapture micrographs using a field emission scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.\n2. Fabrication of microgel suspensions for printing\nSynthesis of GelMA\n\tNOTE: This procedure has been tested for batch sizes consisting of 10 g and 20 g of gelatin. This method details measurements for a batch using 10 g.\n\t\nMake a 10% w/w solution of gelatin type A (porcine, Bloom strength 300) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by weighing out 10 g of gelatin and adding it to a conical flask with 90 mL of PBS. Heat to 50 °C while stirring until the gelatin is completely dissolved.",
    "Add 5.796 mL of methacrylic anhydride. Place a rubber cap on the conical flask and continue stirring in the dark at 50 °C for 90 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: Methacrylic anhydride is toxic if inhaled or swallowed and is a skin and eye irritant. Handle only inside a fume hood and use appropriate PPE.\nQuench the reaction by diluting the conical flask's contents twofold with PBS.\nDecant into 50 mL tubes and centrifuge at 3,000 × g at room temperature for 3 min to remove unreacted methacrylic anhydride.\nDialyze the supernatant inside 14 kDa cutoff cellulose dialysis tubes against deionized water at 40 °C for 5 days while gently stirring. Replace the deionized water every day.\nPrepare for storage by decanting into 50 mL tubes, securing the cap, and placing it in the refrigerator for 12 h. Store in a refrigerator for up to 7 days.\nFreeze using liquid nitrogen and immediately lyophilize for 5 days at −54 °C and 0.4 mbar.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the tubes contain no more than 40 mL of liquid when freezing. Once frozen, replace the cap with a covering that allows gas exchange such as a delicate task wipe secured with an elastic band.\nStore the resulting foam in a freezer at −20 °C until required for microgel suspension synthesis.\nSynthesis of GelMA microgels\n\tNOTE: The microgels are synthesized using a water-in-oil emulsion method13 (Figure 2). This method has been tested for GelMA solution volumes of 1-10 mL. The same protocol can be used to synthesize gelatin microgels used to print standalone bone-prints.\n\t\nMake a 10% w/w GelMA solution in PBS by weighing the lyophilized GelMA, adding it to a tube with PBS, and heating in a water bath at 50 °C until fully hydrated.",
    "Add 37 mL of oil per 1 mL of GelMA solution to a beaker, ensuring it is no more than 65% full.\nSet up a double-beaker system on a hot plate with magnetic stirring by placing the beaker containing oil inside a larger beaker.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the two beakers should be such that ice can be easily dropped into the space between their walls. The setup is shown in Figure 2.\nHeat to 40 °C while stirring.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the vortex is not turbulent and has a depth of approximately 1/3 of the height of the oil in the beaker.\nLoad the GelMA solution into a syringe and add it dropwise into the stirring oil through a 0.45 µm filter. Allow the emulsion to equilibrate for 10 min.\nReduce the temperature of the emulsion to 15 °C to thermally stabilize the spheres by adding crushed ice into the space between the two beakers.\nAdd acetone to the spinning emulsion in a volume ratio of 1:11 GelMA solution to acetone.\n\t\tNOTE: Add the acetone gently through a funnel to avoid disrupting the emulsion. Stir for 60 min.\nDecant the contents of the beaker into 50 mL tubes, making sure to wash the walls of the beaker with acetone. Leave for 20 min to allow the dehydrated microgels to settle to the bottom.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash at least 2x with acetone.\n\t\tNOTE: The supernatant should be clear.\nConsolidate into one tube, top up with acetone, and sonicate for 10 s. Wash 2x with acetone.\nStore in acetone at room temperature until required for printing.\nPreparing the GelMA microgel suspension for printing",
    "Prepare a 1% w/w solution of GelMA in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) by weighing lyophilized GelMA into a tube, adding DMEM, and heating in a water bath at 50 °C until fully hydrated.\nEvaporate the acetone from the dehydrated microgels and weigh the resulting powder into a tube. Add acetone and transfer to a sterile environment.\nTo form the microgel suspension, evaporate the acetone and add DMEM, 1% w/w GelMA solution in DMEM, and 2.5% w/w lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) initiator solution to achieve a final packing fraction of 30%. Allow to fully hydrate for at least 12 h at room temperature. Store in a refrigerator for up to 7 days. Allow to come up to room temperature before use.\n\t\tNOTE: The volumes of these reagents are based on the dry weight of the microgels and can be calculated using the equations in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\n,Equation\n,x = weight of dry microgels (mg)\n\"Volume of 1% w/w GelMA in DMEM, a (µL)\",a = 21.93x\n\"Volume of DMEM, b (µL)\",b = 8.773x\n\"Volume of 2.5% w/w LAP solution, c (µL)\",c = 0.6267x\nTotal volume of microgel suspension produced (µL),a + b + c\nTable 1: Equations for calculating the volumes of reagents required to hydrate the GelMA microgel suspensions. Abbreviations: GelMA = gelatin methacrylate; LAP = lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63943/63943fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic of the oil-emulsion method used for microgel synthesis.

Printing bone-ink into cell suspensions",
    "NOTE: Gelatin-based microgels support the adhesion of many different cell types, which makes this approach amenable to single and multiple cells within the microgel matrix. This protocol describes the procedure for using adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), as this is a popular and robust cell type for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.\nCulture the ADSCs in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until confluent.\nDetach the ADSCs from the tissue culture flask by removing the medium, washing with sterile PBS, and incubating at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 150 × g at room temperature for 5 min.\nCount the cells and calculate 5 × 105 cells for each 1 mL of GelMA microgels. Allocate the required volume of cell suspension to a separate tube and pellet as above.\nCarefully remove as much supernatant as possible using a pipette, leaving only the cell pellet. Add the required volume of microgel suspension to the pellet and aspirate gently to ensure even cell distribution.\n\tNOTE: If there are excess air bubbles in the suspension, gently centrifuge to remove and pipette up and down to redistribute the cells.\nLoad the cell-laden microgel suspension into a reactor using a pipette.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, 10 mm x 10 mm x 3 mm reactors with a volume capacity of 100 µL were 3D printed.\nDeposit bone-ink using a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 23 G needle.\n\tNOTE: This can be done with a 3D printer either by retrofitting an extrusion system that allows printing directly from the 1 mL syringe or by loading the bone-ink directly into the printer's extrusion cartridge (Figure 3).",
    "Crosslink the cell- and bone-ink-laden GelMA microgel construct with a UV-crosslinker lamp (405 nm) for 90 s. Immediately transfer to an appropriately sized well plate and cover with complete DMEM.\n\t​NOTE: The aforementioned 3D-printed reactors fit inside 24-well cell culture plates.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Replace the culture medium after 24 h, then every 48-72 h as required.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63943/63943fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of the COBICS procedure showing the hydration of microgels, incorporation of cells, and subsequent printing of bone-ink in the cell-laden microgel suspension. Abbreviation: COBICS = ceramic omnidirectional bioprinting in cell-suspensions; GelMA = gelatin methacrylate. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63943/63943fig03large.jpg]\n4. Cell viability and proliferation assessment\nTo assess bone-ink cytotoxicity, keep cell-laden COBICS constructs in complete culture medium. Perform a Live Dead assay at 24 h, 72 h, and 120 h (or relevant time points).\nAt each time point, wash the constructs with PBS, then add a solution of phenol-free DMEM containing 4 mM calcein and 2 mM ethidium bromide. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nWash with PBS and transfer to a glass-bottomed dish for imaging with a confocal microscope at Ex/Em spectra of 494/517 nm and 528/617 nm.\nSubscription Required.
