    "Intravital imaging allows for visualization of immune cell migration dynamics in the intestinal mucosa. This protocol describes how to identify and expose a section of murine small intestine for intravital imaging while maintaining an intact neurovascular supply (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002]). Although the surgery and imaging protocols are separated here, Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0003] should be started immediately after the surgery is complete. Mice must be maintained in a surgical plane of anesthesia throughout both protocols.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96d075eb-d9e2-4d5f-b1c6-009c512549e6/cpz1516-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nLaparotomy exposing a 2- to 3-cm section of tissue in the lower portion of the mouse abdomen (center).

Anesthetize a 8- to 12-week-old Tcrd-H2BeGFP C57BL/6 mouse by i.p. injection of ketamine-xylazine solution based on weight of the animal (120 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine) with a 27G hypodermic needle attached to a sterile 1-ml syringe according to IACUC-approved procedure.\nThis should be approximately 150 to 200 μl anesthetic.\nEvaluate the level of anesthesia based on respiration rate (55 to 65 breaths per minute), toe pinch, and palpebral reflex. If, at any point, the anesthesia is wearing off (e.g., based on increased respiration rate, blinking, and/or eye muscle twitching due to the palpebral reflex), administer an additional 50 μl of ketamine-xylazine solution until the mouse is fully sedated.\n2. Once the mouse is anesthetized, slowly inject Hoechst 33342–saline solution nuclear dye (37.5 mg/kg) through retro-orbital venous sinus using a sterile 0.5-ml tuberculin syringe with an attached 27G needle. Use lubricant to prevent drying of mouse's eyes.\nGive the mouse 1 to 2 min following Hoechst 33342–saline solution injection to acclimate to the change in circulating volume.\n3. Set heating pad warmth setting to medium and tape a 6 × 6–in. (15.25 × 15.25–cm) absorbent underpad to surface of the heating pad using laboratory tape. Then, use laboratory tape to secure hind legs of the mouse to the absorbent underpad (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002], center). Monitor body temperature using a rectal probe with a thermocouple thermometer.",
    "If performing antibody labeling as in the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0002], begin Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0001] here.\n4. Use operating scissors to make a 2-cm vertical incision along lower midline of the mouse abdomen (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002], center).\nThe skin and peritoneum can be dissected separately to ensure a clean incision that will be easy to close at later steps.\n5. Identify a suitable region of jejunum (2 to 3 cm) for imaging. Use angled forceps to carefully pull out cecum and small intestine until a region of jejunum that is devoid of Peyer's patches and luminal contents is exposed.\nBy locating and gently exposing the cecum first, the colon (striated muscle pattern) and small intestine (smooth, narrower) can be easily identified while minimizing potential damage to the mesenteric blood vessels. Avoid puncturing the cecum or tearing the mesenteric vasculature. Use the forceps to gently nudge the tissue to reduce the likelihood of bleeding.\n6. Leave this area of jejunum tissue externalized while gently returning cecum and any remaining exposed small intestine into the peritoneal cavity.\n7. Create a hole in membrane supporting the mesenteric vasculature by placing a pair of opened angled forceps on each side of the membrane and gently rubbing the forceps tips together.\nAvoid blood vessels while making the hole to maintain vascularization of the intestinal segment. Once the initial hole in the membrane is made, the forceps can be inserted and gently widened to make room for a suture needle to pass through.\n8. To close the incision, use forceps to guide a curved, taper-point needle attached to a 5-cm suture through one side of the peritoneal lining, through the hole in the mesenteric membrane under the externalized intestine made in step 7, and back up through the other side of the peritoneal lining (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002], left box).",
    "Place one suture at the top of the incision and one near the bottom of the opening of the peritoneal cavity. Avoid damaging the vasculature as you pass through the mesentery and tie off the suture. Before tightening the suture to close the peritoneal cavity, “tuck in” any externalized small intestine that will not be imaged. Make sure that your sutures run parallel and do not cross underneath the exposed intestine.\n9. Close skin beneath the intestinal loop by repeating the same process as described in step 8.\nOne suture under the center of the intestinal loop, between the two previous sutures, is sufficient (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002], right box).\n10. Lightly cauterize a line of perforation along length of the externalized jejunum (∼1.5 cm) with an electrocautery (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0002], right box). Using a moistened Kimwipe, immediately apply a few drops of water to cauterized surface to limit heat-induced tissue damage. Wick away residual water with a dry Kimwipe.\nExtreme precision in using the electrocautery is not critical; small gaps in the line are preferable to excessive heat-induced injury to the intestine.\n11. Use Vannas scissors to first cut a small horizontal slit at distal edge of the cauterized line. Insert scissors to cut along the length of the cauterized tissue to expose the luminal mucosal surface for imaging.\nThe exposed mucosal surface should run nearly to each end of the exposed tissue. Forceps can be used to gently remove any excess fecal content remaining on the exposed mucosal surface.\n12. Cover abdomen with a damp Kimwipe to prevent dehydration of the tissue. Transport mouse to the microscope in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0003] in a covered container.",
    "Identifying a cell of interest using a reporter mouse strain is the most efficient strategy for labeling and tracking cell migration during intravital imaging (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0003]); we use TcrdEGFP and TcrdGDL mice to track γδ IELs (Hu et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0012]; Hu et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0013]). However, various immune cells, including CD8α+ IELs, can be labeled with fluorophore-conjugated primary antibodies prior to imaging to identify specific cell populations of interest (Sumida & Cyster, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0031]; Sumida et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0032]; Wang et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0033]).",
    "The antibody labeling protocol described below has been optimized for labeling CD8α+ IELs; however, fluorophore, concentration, and labeling time for an individual antibody are important considerations. Antibodies labeled with far-red fluorophores such as APC or Alexa Fluor 647 are preferred due to their brightness and resistance to photobleaching. Depending on the laser configuration of the microscope and the number of channels to be imaged, it is possible to use one laser channel to image two distinct features within a region of interest. For example, because CD8α+ T cells are spatially distinct from the lumen, Alexa Fluor 633 hydrazide and APC-CD8α can be imaged simultaneously without affecting downstream analysis. This has advantages because the simultaneous acquisition of two features will decrease the length of time it takes to acquire each Z-stack, thus increasing the temporal resolution. However, if the fluorophore-conjugated antibody is dimmer than the similarly labeled hydrazide or if the labeling efficiency is low, the intensity of the brighter feature (lumen) would be oversaturated in post-processing. This would make it challenging to resolve the lumen and the surface of the cell of interest when generating surfaces during analysis. Further, if using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for intravital imaging, the relative expression of the antigen should be considered. The amount of antibody should be in excess to ensure that the cell of interest will be labeled appropriately. Labeling of tissue-resident immune cells, such as IELs, requires more time for the antibody to penetrate into the tissue compared to labeling of infiltrating peripheral immune cells.\nMaterials\n8- to 12-week-old Tcrd-H2BeGFP C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, strain no. 016941)\nKetamine-xylazine solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-rec-0003])\n10 µg anti-CD8α antibody (clone 53-6.7) APC (eBioscience, cat. no. 17-0081-81) diluted in 100 µl endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; 1×, without Ca2+ and Mg2+; MilliporeSigma, cat. no.

The mouse may wake up after the antibody has been administered but prior to surgery. If the mouse is fully awake and mobile, administer another full dose of ketamine-xylazine solution (see step 1) before beginning the surgery. If the mouse has not fully recovered, administer more ketamine-xylazine solution in 50-μl volumes until a surgical plane of anesthesia has been achieved.\n3.

    "Successful visualization of mucosal immune cells using intravital microscopy requires finding a stable field to image, minimizing motion artifacts (such as peristalsis), and optimizing the temporal resolution of image acquisition. Although the weight of the mouse should push the exposed villi against the coverglass, excessive motion due to respiration, peristalsis, and blood flow may make it difficult to find a stable field to image. This protocol will describe how to properly position the exposed intestinal mucosal surface and identify an appropriate field for image acquisition and also provides tips for troubleshooting artifactual motion (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0003]).

A10437) can be used as an alternative luminal dye.\n2. Use a P200 pipet to pipet 150 μl of the 1 μM AF633-HBSS solution from step 1 into the center of a 35-mm petri dish with a coverglass bottom.\n3. Tightly hold the anesthetized post-surgical mouse by pinching skin along either flank, with the exposed lumen facing down, and center mucosal surface flat against the coverglass.\n4. Open microscope incubation enclosure (pre-warmed to 37°C) and place mouse laying in the dish into the 35-mm holder on the stage of the spinning-disk confocal microscope.\nHold the mouse in place by pressing a finger on the back of the mouse to prevent it from shifting while positioning the dish on the stage.\nIn the absence of an incubation chamber, a heated blanket and/or stage can be used to maintain the body temperature of the mouse.\n5. Launch imaging software and set excitation intensity between 10 and 15 mW and the exposure time to 120 to 150 ms for each laser (405, 488, and 640 nm). Select a frame average of “2” and turn on EM gain function to reduce background noise.",
    "6. Use 20× objective and 405-nm laser to visualize the nuclei and identify a field of villi with little to no visible movement by eye. Once identified, use XY scan to record the coordinates for the field of interest. Switch to 63× glycerol immersion objective (with type G immersion liquid) and return to original field of view using the recorded coordinates.\nAvoid selecting areas with artifactual motion due to respiration, peristalsis, or heartbeat. Although drift over time can be accommodated during the analysis, substantial motion that prevents the accurate overlay of multiple channels at a single time point cannot be corrected.\n7. Set first plane for the Z-stack using the 405-nm channel by focusing on the orthogonal plane just beneath the epithelium at the villus tip. Once GFP+ γδ IELs and/or a distinct epithelial monolayer are visible along the outer edge of each villus, adjust focus going down the length of the villus until it is difficult to accurately resolve individual epithelial nuclei. Acquire a 15- to 20-μm Z-stack with 1.5-μm steps (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-fig-0003], right box).\nUsing the exposure times described in step 5, it is possible to acquire a Z-stack in three channels (405, 488, and 640 nm) with 20-s time intervals. Imaging with four channels (405, 488, 560, and 640 nm) can increase the time interval to 30 s.\n8. Confirm that signal in other channels is visible in the selected field and begin image acquisition with EMCCD camera. Record for up to 30 to 60 min in 2 to 3 fields for each mouse. Monitor mouse every 5 min throughout image acquisition, looking for twitching or whisker movement.\nIf possible, open a separate copy of the imaging file that is being acquired after 3 to 5 min to confirm image stability and IEL motility.",
    "It is possible that the mouse will bleed following surgery (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0001]). While the bleeding will eventually clot, blood will dilute the luminal marker (AF633). In this case, removing the mouse, cleaning the dish/coverglass, and replacing the AF633 solution will be required.\nIf the anesthesia begins to wear off, use forceps to gently scruff the neck of the mouse and administer 50 μl ketamine-xylazine subcutaneously to avoid disrupting image acquisition.\n9. Once image acquisition is complete, euthanize mouse by cervical dislocation followed by bilateral pneumothorax.\nAlthough it is possible, it is not advisable to image an individual mouse for more than 4 hr due to the need for repeated ketamine administration. If there is available access to an isoflurane vaporizer, this would be a preferable means of anesthesia administration should an extended time course be needed. Without replacing the luminal marker every hour or two, shedding cells will continue to accumulate in the lumen over time and may eventually become visually distracting.",
    "Once images have been acquired (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-prot-0003]), the resulting videos can be analyzed using Imaris image analysis software. There are multiple software programs available for tracking cell migration, including those that are commercially available (ImarisTrack) and open source software (Fiji/ImageJ, CellTrack). A recent review (Masuzzo, Van Troys, Ampe, & Martens, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-bib-0021]) provides a general overview of the computational capabilities of these programs to assist in decision-making regarding which platform is best suited to one's experimental needs. Although this review focuses on tracking cell migration in vitro, these same principles apply to the intravital imaging described here.\nThis protocol uses ImarisTrack because it has a comprehensive suite that facilitates cell tracking in a complex 3D environment. The auto-regressive motion algorithm for tracking cell migration is specifically designed to predict the best path for each cell (IEL) to provide unbiased data analysis. ImarisTrack renders surfaces around objects within the time-lapse image, which assists in the downstream analyses described below. Finally, the software can accommodate plugins for other open-source software, such as Matlab, to provide access to additional analysis tools. Imaris calculates a wide range of parameters; however, only a select few are described in detail here (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.516#cpz1516-tbl-0001]). This protocol will describe the parameters for tracking IEL motility and metrics of IEL/epithelial interactions, which allows for an unbiased comparison of the migratory behavior of IELs across technical replicates and experimental conditions.\nTable 1.\n                Quick Reference Guide for Imaris Surface Rendering and Tracking\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0,IEL,Lumen\nSurface creation,Surface creation,Surface creation\nSource channel,488 or 640 nm,560 or 640 nm\nThresholding type,Absolute intensity,Background subtraction\nSurface detail (μm),0.5,0.5\nDiameter of largest sphere (μm),-,2-10\nSeed point diameter (μm),7,-\nFilter seed points,Quality,Quality\nFilter surfaces,Number of voxels,Number of voxels\nSurface tracking,Surface tracking,Surface tracking\nAlgorithm,Autoregressive motion,-\nMax distance (μm),8,-\nMax gap (μm),3,-\nFilter track,Track duration,-\nMaterials",

Identify a 30- to 60-min section of video for cell tracking.\nLonger videos can be cropped by selecting “Edit” > “Crop Time” and then selecting the frames to remain after cropping.\nIf drift correction is required (see Troubleshooting), correct drift before continuing with cell tracking.\n3. Generate an IEL surface with “Add new surfaces” tool in the left selection pane.\nIELs can also be tracked using the “Spots” tool following the same basic parameters.\nBoth fluorescent reporter–labeled and antibody-labeled IELs can be tracked with surfaces using the same process. If there are blood vessels in the same channel as the antibody-labeled IELs, these can be filtered out by size or manually removed following surface rendering (see Troubleshooting).\n4. Select “Track surface (over time)” under “Algorithm Settings” menu.\n“Classify Surfaces” and “Object-Object Statistics” can both be used for downstream analysis but can be applied after the surface has been generated. Not selecting these options initially will speed up surface rendering.\n5. Use “Source Channel” to select channel corresponding to IELs to create the surface. Set “Surface detail” to 0.5 μm and “Thresholding” to “Absolute Intensity.”\n6. Set “Absolute Intensity” to select all IELs while excluding autofluorescence or background noise. Enable “Split touching objects (region growing)” and set seed diameter points to ∼7 μm.",
    "The intensity settings will vary between videos depending on the brightness of the fluorophore used to identify IELs. Check multiple time points throughout the duration of the video to ensure that those IELs with dimmer fluorescence intensity are identified by the software.\nUnder the “Color” tab, the surface display setting can be changed to transparent to ensure that the surface is an accurate reflection of IEL volume.\n7. Once the surface calculations are completed, use “Quality” filter to select for IELs and remove any background noise.\n8. Skip “Edit Surface” tab and continue to “Tracking Selection” menu.\nAll changes to surfaces can be made later in this protocol during the track correction phase.\n9.

Open “Edit Tracks” tab and deselect “Focus tracks” so all tracks are displayed. Follow IEL surface along the mapped track to ensure accurate tracking throughout the video. If incorrect, disconnect selected object at the frame with the observed error and connect selected objects to reconnect the track.\nAlthough the tracking algorithm is relatively accurate, it is necessary to visually validate each track.\nSelecting the “Dragon Tail” setting under “Tracks Display” in the “Surface Settings” tab will allow for selection of how much of a track to display.

Be sure to choose a surface detail that does not overlap with the nuclei of the epithelial cells, as this will give inaccurate readings in later steps when calculating surface statistics.\n13. Use “Edit track” tool to remove any incorrectly mapped surfaces that were missed by the filter.\n14. Select “Object-Object Statistics” under “Edit” tab for both the IEL and the luminal surfaces.\n15. Open “Preferences” menu and use “Statistics” tab to select the appropriate statistics for the analysis. Turn on “Object-Object Statistics” under “Edit” tab for each surface/spot.\nThe data that we generated with this protocol used the following statistical metrics: speed, track speed mean, track straightness, track duration, and shortest distance to surface."
