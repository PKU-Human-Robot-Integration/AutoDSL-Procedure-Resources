    "Preparation of essential oil coated silicone rubber surfaces by using hypromellose ointment (see also Figure 1)Mix hypromellose ointment with a particular essential oil (w/w) under aseptic conditions using a sterile porcelain mortar and pestle.Place a layer of essential oil/hypromellose ointment mixture (50 mg) (w/w) in a sterile Petri dish under sterile conditions by using a Bunsen burner.Clean silicone rubber surface sheets by rinsing them with 2% Extran MA02 in water followed by tap water, 70% ethanol solution (v/v) and sterile demineralized water.Place the sterile silicone rubber surface sheet (10 × 10 mm) on top of a layer of essential oil/hypromellose ointment mixture (w/w).Apply a gentle pressure onto the silicone rubber surface sheet to let the essential oil/hypromellose ointment mixture stick onto the material.Take essential oil coated silicone rubber surface sheet gently out of the Petri dish by using sterile forceps and place it in a well of a sterile 6-Well plate for the further analysis.Place the essential oil coated silicone rubber surface sheet vertical on a sterile Petri dish and put them under a light microscope (×10) in order to capture an image that contains thicknesses of both the silicone rubber sheet and the coating.Set the thickness of the silicone rubber sheet as 1.5 mm and estimate the thickness of the essential oil/hypromellose ointment coatings on the silicone rubber surfaces by using ImageJ Software.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3941/bioprotoc-11-05-3941-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Taking essential oil coated surface sheet gently out of the Petri dish.Determination of Candida biofilm formation on essential oil coated surfaces (see also Figure 2)Inoculate Candida strains from stock culture (grown in BHI with glycerol) into Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar by a streak plating technique and incubate them for 24 h at 37 °C under aerobic conditions.Inoculate single colonies of Candida strains for pre-culture preparations into 10 ml BHI broth and incubate overnight at 37 °C without shaking.Inoculate 10 ml preculture into the 200 ml BHI broth and grow it for 24 h at 37 °C without shaking to obtain main culture.Harvest Candida cells by centrifugation at 3,220 × g for 10 min at 5 °C and wash 3 times with 30 ml 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).Count Candida cells that exist in 8 different medium squares of a Thoma Counting Chamber under a light microscope with 40× objective. Calculate the average of the cells for a single medium square and calculate the Candida cell density considering the volume of a single medium square of the Thoma Counting Chamber. Adjust cell density to 3 × 106 cells/ml in BHI broth.Place the essential oil coated silicone rubber surfaces, silicone rubber surfaces with only hypromellose ointment and the silicone rubber surfaces without any coating (positive controls) into the wells of a 24-well plate.Add 2 ml of Candida suspensions to the wells of 24-well plates that include the different silicone rubber surfaces and incubate them for 7 days at 37 °C under aerobic conditions without shaking.After 7 days of incubation, wash gently three times the materials harboring biofilm with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and stain them with a 1% (w/v) solution of crystal violet in sterile distilled water for 20 min at 25 °C.",
    "Subsequently, gently rinse the materials with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) again until no crystal violet residue left in the washing solution.Dissolve crystal violet bound to the biofilm on the different tested surfaces in 2 ml ethanol (96%; v/v) for 20 min (O’Toole, 2011).Measure the absorbance of dissolved crystal violet at 560 nm using a spectrophotometer (O’Toole, 2011).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3941/bioprotoc-11-05-3941-g002.jpgFigure 2.
