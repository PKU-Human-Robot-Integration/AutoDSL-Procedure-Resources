    "Note: The following protocol and representative results use the HDAC inhibitor SAHA as an example compound. However, this protocol is by no means limited to the use of SAHA, and is recommended as a general method to test the effects of soluble compounds on corneal neovascularization. Minor modifications will need to be made for degree of dilution as well as frequency and duration of application. Additionally, compounds that are easily soluble in water will be able to be administered in the absence of DMSO.\nEthical Statement: All animal experiments should only be performed in compliance with national law and institutional regulations. This protocol was approved for use by Tulane University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. \n1. Preparation of Materials (in Order of Use)\nCut a piece of cellulose filter paper (11 μm) into 2 mm circles.\nPrepare a 1 M solution of NaOH by dissolving 20 g of NaOH in 500 ml distilled H2O. Store at room temperature. CAUTION: NaOH solutions are corrosive and can cause alkali-burns.\nPrepare an anesthetic cocktail by diluting 10 ml of 100 mg/ml ketamine and 2.5 ml of 20 mg/ml xylazine in 37.5 ml of 1x PBS for a final concentration of 20 mg/ml ketamine and 4 mg/ml xylazine.\nPrepare a 0.5% solution of proparacaine hydrochloride (for topical analgesia) by dissolving 500 mg of proparacaine hydrochloride in 100 ml of filtered PBS.\nPrepare 1x PBS by dissolving 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, and 0.23 g of NaH2PO4 in 900 ml of distilled H2O. Adjust to 7.4 pH. Bring the solution to a final volume of 1,000 ml with distilled H2O and filter to ensure sterility.",
    "Prepare 1,000x stock solutions of SAHA at ~100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by dissolving 26.4 mg of SAHA in 1 ml of DMSO. Dilute to a 1x (~10 μM) solution in filtered PBS for each use. Store the stock solution at -20 °C for up to one month. CAUTION: DMSO is a known toxin and mutagen.\nPrepare a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde (PFA) for fixation. Under a chemical hood, dissolve 4 g of PFA in 90 ml of PBS. Bring the mixture to 65 °C and titrate to a pH of 7.4. Once the PFA has dissolved, bring the solution to a final volume of 100 ml. Store at 4 °C for up to one month. CAUTION: PFA is a known to be allergenic, carcinogenic, and toxic.\nPrepare 1x blocking buffer by diluting 5 ml of goat serum and 500 ul of Triton X-100 into 94.5 ml of PBS.\nPrepare 1x washing buffer by diluting 500 ul of Triton X-100 into 99.5 ml of PBS.\n2. Alkali-Burn Injury & Compound Treatment\nSoak a round piece of filter paper, ~2 mm in diameter, in a solution of 1 M NaOH.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine, which is ~100 μl of the anesthetic cocktail from step 1.3 per 25 g mouse. Anesthesia should take ~1-2 min to set in. Depth of anesthesia may be determined by gently pinching the toe or tail of the animal, if anesthesia is sufficient there should be no response. Note: Care should be taken to ensure the mouse does not succumb to anesthesia induced hypothermia.\nUsing an eyedropper, topically apply a drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride to the corneal surface for local analgesia.",
    "Using sterile forceps, pick up a piece of NaOH soaked filter paper. If you notice excess NaOH clinging to or dripping from the filter paper, briefly tap the soaked filter paper on a dry piece of filter paper to absorb the excess. Place the piece of NAOH soaked filter paper on the central cornea. Leave it for 30 sec to generate an acute alkali-burn of ~2 x 2 mm2 in area. A surgical microscope is helpful in properly placing the filter paper. Note: Only one eye of the mouse should be injured with the other serving as a control.\nRemove the filter paper. Using a 10 ml syringe, gently flush the eye with 10 ml of 1x PBS twice to wash away residual 1 M NaOH.\nImmediately apply a drop of 1x SAHA working solution (or a vehicle control consisting of PBS diluted DMSO containing no SAHA) topically to the cornea. Repeat application 3x/day for 14 days. Note: during this period a topical antibiotic ointment is not recommended as it may interfere with the development of the injury and the delivery of the compound. Use a liquid antibiotic solution, such as 3% Gentamicin solution, instead.\nProceed directly to Clinical Assessment (Protocol 3 below) or sacrifice the mouse and enucleate the eyes for corneal flat mount (Protocol 4 below) or conventional paraffin/frozen histology.\n3. Clinical Assessment\nPerform a daily examination of the mice in a blinded fashion under a surgical microscope and score corneal NV based on corneal opacity, NV, and vessel size. Use at least two observers and record a final score that is the average of the two.",
    "Score corneal opacity on a scale of 0-4. 0 = completely clear; 1 = slightly hazy, iris and pupil easily visible; 2 = slightly opaque, iris and pupil still detectable; 3 = opaque, pupils hardly detectable; and 4 = completely opaque with no view of the pupil.\nScore NV on a scale of 0-3. 0 = no neovessels; 1 = neovessels at the corneal limbus; 2 = neovessels spanning the corneal limbus and approaching the corneal center; 3 = neovessels spanning the corneal center.\nScore vessel size on a scale of 0-3. 0 = no neovessels; 1 = neovessels detectable under surgical microscope; 2 = neovessels easily seen under surgical microscope; 3 = neovessels easily seen without the microscope.\nUsing a digital camera, take representative images of the eye at 7 days and 14 days.\n4. Corneal Staining and Flat Mounts\nFix enucleated eye in 4% PFA for at least 1 hr at 4 °C.\nTransfer the eye to 1x PBS and use forceps to carefully remove excess tissue.\nWith the aid of a surgical microscope, use a needle (18 gauge) or micro-knife to perforate the pericorneal region of the eye (note: this should release fluid from the eye).\n\t\nFrom the perforation made in section 4.3.1 use a pair of surgical scissors to cut the anterior portion of the eye (cornea) from the posterior portion.\nTransfer the cornea back into 4% PFA for fixation overnight at 4 °C.\nDiscard the 4% PFA (CAUTION: PFA is hazardous and must be disposed of in accordance with institutional regulations) and rinse the cornea three times with 1x PBS to remove any residual PFA.\nIncubate in 1x blocking buffer for at least 2 hr at room temperature to permeabilize the tissue and prevent nonspecific binding of the primary antibody.",
    "Apply primary antibody in 1x blocking buffer, at a 100-500 fold dilution. (e.g. rat anti-mouse-PECAM-1 for detecting blood vessels at 1:100, rabbit anti-mouse-LYVE-1 for detecting lymphatic vessels at 1:500, and/or rat anti-mouse-F4/80 for detecting macrophages at 1:100). Incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nWash six times with 1x washing buffer for 1 hr each time at room temperature to fully remove unbound primary antibody.\nApply a secondary antibody in 1x blocking buffer at a 500-1,000 fold dilution. (e.g. a 488 nm fluorescent tagged goat anti-rat-IgG at 1:800 or a 594 nm fluorescent tagged goat anti-rabbit-IgG at 1:800). Incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nWash three times with 1x PBS for 1 hr each at room temperature to fully remove unbound secondary antibody.\nTransfer the cornea into fresh 1x PBS and, with the aid of a surgical microscope, carefully make four incisions from periphery towards the center. This should divide the cornea into four quadrants of approximately equal size (the resulting shape should look rather like a butterfly) and allow it to lie flat on a slide.\nMount with a mounting medium appropriate for fluorescent imaging. For best results, samples should be imaged immediately and digital photographs taken, but may be stored for several weeks protected from light at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
