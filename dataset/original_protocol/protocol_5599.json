    "Preparation of actinReconstitute vial of lyophilised powder of rabbit muscle G-actin in water (2 mg/ml) and incubate protein for 1/2 h at room temperature (RT). Note: If making up a large stock of actin, freeze in small, single use aliquots at -80 °C.Pre-equilibrate a Superdex S200 10/300 GL column with a minimum of 35 ml of G-buffer.Note: G-buffer is used as both pre-elution and elution buffer.Load 0.5 ml of actin (2 mg/ml) onto the Superdex S200, and run column in G-buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and collect column fractions corresponding to elution volumes of 12-15 ml for analysis. Analyse fractions reflecting the peak of actin protein (G-actin molecular mass is 42-43 kDa) by SDS-PAGE on a NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel under reducing conditions, and visualise proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to confirm purity of G-actin.Pool fractions reflecting the peak of G-actin.Polymerise G-actin (pooled monomeric G-actin from step 1e) to F-actin by adding 1/10 volume of 10x F-buffer and incubating for 1 h at RT.Assay for actin filament bindingUse the actin filaments generated in step A-6 to set up a series of reaction tubes in polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes with a range of concentrations of actin filaments (0, 1, 2, 5 μM) and add a fixed amount of potential actin-interacting protein (Clec9A; 5 μM) or a control protein that does not interact with actin (5 μM) in a total volume of 50 μl. As a control, also include 1 tube of actin alone. Note: The concentration of actin filaments used for each reactions should be based on the initial concentration of G-actin in step A-5.Incubate reactions for 1 h at RT.Sediment actin filaments and associated proteins by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g using a fixed angle rotor for 1 h at RT.",
    "Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube.Wash pellet by adding 50 μl of 1x F-buffer (diluted in G-buffer) and sediment actin filaments and associated proteins by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h at RT.Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1x Laemmli reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (equal volume to supernatant).Set up tubes containing an equal volume of supernatant (from step B-4) with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, or resuspended pellet in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (from step B-6) for each of the reactions of actin +/- actin binding proteins, then incubate samples at 95 °C for 5 min.Analyse samples by SDS-PAGE and visualise proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Quantitate the amount of Clec9A in the supernatant and pellet fractions by densitometry analysis using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer. Note: It is important to note that as the samples are being analysed under reducing conditions, the sizes of the bands do not change on SDS-PAGE. What changes is the shift of the bands from supernatant to pellet as a result of F-actin cosedimentation.Calculate the intensity of the Clec9A bands in the pellet, and the intensity of the total amount of Clec9A (pellet + supernatant). Then calculate the proportion of Clec9A co-sedimenting with F-actin as the ratio of Clec9A in the pellet relative to the total Clec9A (Clec9A in the Supernatant + Pellet), that is, the intensity of Clec9A in pellet divided by the intensity of Clec9A in (supernatant + pellet). The proportion of Clec9A co-sedimenting with F-actin relative to a nonspecific binding control is interpreted as the specific binding to F-actin."
