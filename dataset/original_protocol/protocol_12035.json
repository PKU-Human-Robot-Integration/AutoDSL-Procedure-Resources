    "All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use and Ethical Committees at University of Pavia. Animals were maintained under conditions of 22 °C, 60% air humidity and a light/dark cycle of 12:12 h.\n1.Ovary Isolation\nInject intraperitoneally 2 four-to-eleven week-old CD1 female mice with 10 U of follicle stimulating hormone with a sterile 1 mL insulin syringe.\nWait 46-48 h.\nWeigh the mouse and anesthetize with an intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of Zoletil (Tiletamina and Zolazepan cloridrate). Euthanize by cervical dislocation.\nGrasp the skin covering the abdominal wall using a pair of dissection forceps. Cut the skin and body wall with a pair of scissors and pull open the incision with forceps.\nUsing a pair of tweezers, move the guts aside, pinpoint the uterine horns and localize the ovaries at their extremity.\nGently hold the ovary using watchmaker forceps and use scissors to cut its ligament to the uterus. Repeat with the other ovary.\nTransfer the collected ovaries into a 35-mm cell culture Petri dish containing 1 mL of M2 isolation medium pre-warmed at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air.\nRemove the fat and the oviduct using fine scissors under a stereomicroscope.\n2. Isolation of Cumulus Oocyte Complexes\nPuncture the ovarian surface using sterile tweezers and a 1G sterile insulin needle until antral cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) are passively released.\nCollect COCs with more than three layers of cumulus cells using a mouth-controlled hand-pulled Pasteur micropipette (200 µm in diameter) and transfer them into a 300 µL drop of fresh M2 medium.\nRemove the cumulus cells surrounding the oocytes using a hand-pulled Pasteur micropipette (80 µm in diameter) by gently pipetting in and out for few seconds,",
    "Repeatedly transfer oocytes from a 20 µL drop of M2 medium to another one, until cumulus cells are completely eliminated.\n3. Chromatin Organization-Based Oocyte Classification\nPrepare Hoechst 33342 staining solution at a final concentration of 0.05 µg/mL in M2 medium starting from a mother solution of 5 mg/mL diluted in 1x PBS.\nPlace 3.5 µL micro droplets of Hoechst staining solution at the bottom of a 35 mm Petri dish lid.\nTransfer each single oocyte into a Hoechst staining drop, place the dish onto a pre-warmed (37 °C) heating plate and cover it with a dark lid to avoid light exposition.\nAfter 10 min of incubation at room temperature, observe the oocytes with a fluorescence microscope at 10X magnification under UV light (330-385 nm), for no more than 1-2 s.\nClassify oocytes as a surrounded nucleolus (SN) (Figure 1A), if they present a ring of Hoechst-positive chromatin surrounding the nucleolus.\nClassify oocytes as a not surrounded nucleolus (NSN), if their nucleolus is not surrounded by Hoechst-positive chromatin and shows disperse heterochromatic spots within the nucleus (Figure 1B).\n4. Neural Network-Based Oocyte Classification\nPrepare four 2 µL droplets of α-MEM medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 mM taurine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 75 µg/mL streptomycin and 23.5 µg/µL sodium pyruvate into a 35-mm glass bottom Petri dish and cover them with pre-warmed (37 °C) and pre-equilibrated mineral oil to avoid medium evaporation.\n\tNOTE: If using a live cell-screening system, keep the drops at a specific distance by using a drawn grid of 7 mm x 7 mm as a guideline.\nTransfer 3- 4 oocytes to each drop.",
    "Place the glass bottom Petri dish into a live cell-screening system, equipped with time-lapse recording software (see Table of Materials), which allows the observation of oocyte maturation in an environment with stable temperature (37 °C) and CO2 concentration (5%).\nOpen the time-lapse recording software. On the screen a window appears with a live shot of the oocyte on the left-hand side and all the setting buttons on the right-hand side.\nSelect the center of the oocyte to position it at the screen center. Adjust focus if necessary.\nSelect the Ph button and set the DIA Lamp to 192; the Exposure time to 1/125 s; the Gain to 1.99; and the Resolution to 1600 x 1200.\nSelect FL2 and set the DIA Lamp to 5; the Exposure time to 3 s; the Gain to 2.37; and the Resolution to 1600 x 1200.\nSelect the New point button in order to record the oocyte position within the culture drop. Repeat the same routine for each oocyte within the culture drop.\nSelect Time and set the Acquisition cycle to 8 min and the Total time to 15 h.\nSelect Start time-lapse to start the recording cycle.\nOpen the MATLAB software and write >>cell_piv; and then select the PIV Tool.\nChoose the folder containing the recorded movie and select any of the .jpeg files to load the whole image sequence. For each oocyte, select the region of interest (ROI) by clicking the Select area tool.\nSelect Process PIV in the File menu. Select the Viewer Tool button.\n\tNOTE: The program will calculate the velocity vectors within the ROI and automatically produces a data file, saved as a .mat file.",
    "Select the .mat file to open. Select the button Select ROI tool and draw a circle around the outline of the oocyte. Click Save under the File menu.\n\tNOTE: The vectors in this region are now displayed and the mean magnitude data in the graph window updated for this new ROI.\nOpen the collected mean magnitude data of the whole time-lapse frames recorded into a spreadsheet, with, on the rows, the frame sequence and, on the columns, each single oocyte analyzed.\nOrganize the data of both NSN and SN oocytes into 10 subgroups.\nUse 9 subgroups to train the feed-forward artificial neural network iteratively (FANN) and 1 subgroup for blind testing.\n\t\nRepeat another 9 times, changing the blind testing sample (10-fold cross-validation).\nOpen MATLAB, run the custom-made script main and, upon request, insert the name of the file with the training data (train.txt), the number of NSN and SN oocytes used for training and the time-lapse interval to be analyzed (typically, from frame # 1-2 to frame # 112-113).\nPress enter to perform the training.\nInsert the name of the file with the testing data (test.txt).\nOpen the vector test_outputs_cyt in MATLAB workspace.\n\tNOTE: A window appears on the screen showing, in the first row, the probability to obtain True Positives (TP or True NSN) and False Positives (FP or False NSN) for NSN and SN oocytes, respectively; instead, in the second row, the probability to obtain False Negatives (FN or False SN) and True Negatives (TN or True SN) for NSN and SN oocytes, respectively.\nUse the formula: (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN), to calculate the FANN accuracy, expressed as a percentage.\nSubscription Required.
