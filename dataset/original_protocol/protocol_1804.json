    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare reagents and pipets\nTiming: 30–60 min, on the day of experiment\nAdd 10 mM glucose to 0.5 and 2.5 mm Ca2+HEPES solutions and oxygenate them.\nRefer to Materials and Equipment section for buffer recipe.\nUse 0.5 mM Ca2+ HEPES for bipolar cell isolation and 2.5 mM Ca2+ HEPES for voltage-clamp recording.\nReconstitute RBP-Cy5 peptide in pipet solution and load into filler pipet.\nDilute 1.4 μL of the 2.5 mM Cy5-RBP stock with intracellular/pipet solution (100 μL) (preparation step 4) to a final working concentration of 35 μM.\nLoad diluted solution into filler pipet\nNote: Protect the loaded filler pipet from light by wrapping it in a piece of aluminum foil and place it in a covered ice box.\nPrepare patch-clamp pipets\nPrepare standard pipets.\nUse <10 mΩ for bipolar cell soma, 10–15 mΩ for larger terminals (5 μm), or 15–20 mΩ for smaller terminals (<3 μm).\nFurther details of the shape of the pipet can be found in the Pipette Cookbook from Sutter at https://www.sutter.com/PDFs/pipette_cookbook.pdf[href=https://www.sutter.com/PDFs/pipette_cookbook.pdf]\nNote: Refer to the Materials and Equipment section for more information.\nCoat the pipets with dental wax or other hydrophobic insulator to decrease stray capacitance and improve noise characteristics.\nMelt dental wax in homemade molten supply.\nBriefly dip and rotate the pipet in liquid wax to evenly coat the tip.\nCritical: Ensure that the wax coats the pipet from close to the tip to a point well past the beginning of its taper but do not allow wax to enter the tip of the pipet.\nOptional: Alternatively, the pipet may be insulated with Sylgard 184TM (poly-dimethyl siloxane elastomer; PDMS) but as this requires a specialized apparatus, we use the dental wax procedure described here instead.\nFire-polish the pipets using the microforge instrument.",
    "Turn on the two LED lights in the microforge and set the heat/speed control to ∼6.\nUse the 60×/0.6 objective to position the pipet so that both it and the platinum heating filament are visible.\nSwitch to the 10× long working distance plan achromatic objective to precisely position the pipet tip against the polishing coil. The distance between the pipet tip and the filament should be maintained at ∼75 μm.\nThe polishing is controlled by a foot-pedal. We do a brief polishing by pressing the pedal for a count of ∼3.\nStore the prepared pipets in an air-tight container to prevent any dust particles that can affect the formation of the seal.\nCritical: The quality of the prepared pipets is affected by the shape, appearance, and position of the box filament, the age or freshness of the Drierite desiccant, the temperature of the room, and changes in air flow.\nLocalize single ribbon active zone and track a single SypHy molecule\nTiming: 2 h/ retinal bipolar cell preparation, on the day of the experiment\nPerform a whole cell recording and label the synaptic ribbon.\nSecure the glass-bottom dish plated with bipolar cells firmly to the LSCM sample holder.\nSelect ocular mode to manually search for an intact rod bipolar cell using the LSCM’s 60 X silicon objective lens and focus on the cell of interest using differential contrast to confirm that the cell of interest is a healthy, intact bipolar cell suitable for the experiment. See Troubleshooting, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nSwitch from ocular to LSM mode and use transmitter-detected channel to sharply focus on the selected bipolar cell soma or terminal to facilitate patch-clamping. (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4])\nTo label the synaptic ribbon, perform a whole-cell patch camp recording from the cell terminal with intracellular solution containing 35 μm Cy5-RBP. (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5])",
    "Use a fire-polished, wax-coated glass pipet with a resistance appropriate for soma, large- or small- terminals to obtain an access resistance of less than 20 mΩ.\nCarefully approach the soma or terminal of the selected cell with a brief positive pressure applied via the mouthpiece attached to the electrode holder. Sharp focus on the edge of the cell and the tip of the pipet before advancing the pipet toward the cell. (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4])\nRelease the positive pressure when an indentation forms in the plasma membrane and secure the mouthpiece to prevent any movements during recording.\nA successful whole cell recording requires a tight seal, so the seal resistance must be greater than 3GΩ to proceed. See Troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nAfter establishing the whole-cell configuration, wait approximately 2–3 s for steady state labeling of synaptic ribbons.\nCritical: The labeling period for the synaptic ribbon will be longer when patching soma or for higher access resistance (>30 mΩ).\nCritical: Fast scanning can be used during this process to minimize phototoxicity and photobleaching.\nIn the FV 3000 software, select the dyes used for imaging and perform x-y and x-t line scan imaging single SypHy molecule at a ribbon location molecule. See Troubleshooting, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nZoom in on the cell terminal using the 60× objective and acquire x-y raster scans with a scan speed of 2 μs/pixel (frame size, 256 × 256 pixels) to monitor global SypHy responses to sustained depolarization. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) In these experiments, the bipolar cell terminal is stimulated for 500-ms or for 1-s at 30-s intervals. For analysis, we include terminals with leak current <20 pA.\nNote: Use sequence manager in FV 3000 FluoView software and logic pulses between the PatchMaster and Imaging computers to obtain x-y scans before, during, and after the stimulus. See Troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].",
    "For tracking a newly fused SypHy molecule from a single active zone, we generate rapid x-t line scans with a specific duration of a zoomed region through a selected ribbon to monitor SypHy fluorescence. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) Carefully adjust the focal plane to bring the labeled ribbons into sharp focus to avoid the region of high curvature near the top of the terminal and the plane of adherence of the membrane to the glass coverslip at the bottom of the terminal.\nCritical: Sharp focusing on the ribbon is important to minimize the impact of curvature of the plasma membrane in the z-axis within the optical section and facilitate localization of the plasma membrane with respect to the ribbon.\nNote: Single molecule imaging can be confirmed by PSF quantified by FWHM of a diffraction-limited 27-nm fluorescent bead with the same imaging parameters. (Vaithianathan and Matthews, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Briefly, fit the bead image with two-dimensional gaussian fitting, which will provide a standard deviation (s) of the bead image. FWHM can be obtained using the following equation  F W H M = 2  2 l n 2  σ . Due to the sparseness of SypHy expression in this zebrafish line, the majority of experiments (94.4%) exhibit no detectable events. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by increasing the microscope’s pinhole size, as this will increase the overall intensity of the emitted fluorescence.\nOptional: Single molecule imaging and amplitude can be also confirmed with spontaneously occurring events that can occur long after stimulation (>5s) or occasionally before depolarization as described in (Vaithianathan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nPause point: The following data analysis steps can be performed on a later date.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",

    "(A) Top: Synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar cells from transgenic zebrafish that sparsely express SypHy were voltage clamped by placing the patch pipette filled with Cy5-RBP. We generated rapid x-t line-scans at a ribbon location to obtain high spatiotemporal images of SypHy fusion events. We chose the ribbons that are sharp focused (For example 1, 2 or 5) and at the edge of the plasma membrane to generate line-scan. Bottom: x-t line-scans (white dash lines) were obtained across the ribbon, perpendicular to plasma membrane.\n(B) Left: Representation of a raw x-t raster plot of SypHy (green) and ribbon (red). The line-scans were obtained at 7.44 ms/line consisting of 2000-line scans. Right: TTL trigger from Patch Master computer delivered to the imaging computer to start image acquisition. In addition, horizontal-scan synch from imaging computer is delivered to Patch Master to obtain precise timing of image acquisition. Besides, voltage command, information about calcium current and capacitance measurements for each stimulus also can be obtained from Patch Master computer.\n(C) To enhance the SypHy fluorescence signal and optimize the SNR the same line scan in Figure 2B but averaged 2-pixels along x-axis and 5-pixels along time-axis.\nData analysis\nTiming: 0.5 h/dataset.\nAnalysis of the x-y scans.\nRaw images acquired using the Olympus microscope running FV3000 FluoView software can be opened in NIH ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD; https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]) using Olympus viewer plugins that can be downloaded, as described in the Note below.\nPosition a square region of interest (ROI; 1 x 1 μm) at exocytic hotspots, which can be identified by ribbon fluorescence.

    "The recovery phase of SypHy fluorescence can be obtained by fitting the decay back to the baseline phase with declining exponential using the curve fitting function in Igor Pro 8 software (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR). The recovery phase, which presumably reflects the time for internalization, acidification, and photobleaching, was exponential. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, Bottom)\nNote: To open raw images acquired in Olympus requires Olympus ImageJ Plugin, which can be downloaded from this link: https://imagej.net/formats/olympus[href=https://imagej.net/formats/olympus]. Instructions for installing this plugin are also provided at this link.\nAnalysis of the x-t scans\nUse Olympus viewer to open x-t line-scan images. In the ImageJ software, average the x-t images over 2 pixels in the x-axis and 5 lines in the t-axis using the Scale command on the Image menu. This will optimize the SNR and quantification of RBP and SypHy fluorescence. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C)\nAnalyze the x-axis profile of the x-t line scan to determine the spatial profile of SypHy fluorescence with respect to the ribbon. This can be obtained using ImageJ and Igor Pro8 software, as follows.\nUse the rectangular option in ImageJ to draw a ROI encompassing the entire line-scan. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A)\nNote: Do not continue the analysis if the ribbon profile demonstrates any movement along the time axis and/or bleaching.\nGo to Analyze > Plot profile.\nNote: As standard orientation for analysis, we keep the outside of the cell on the right-hand side. For images that were acquired with the ribbon on the left-hand side, flip both channels horizontally, as follows. Go to Image > Transform > Flip Horizontally.\nClick the list in the bottom panel of the line profile to view the plot values.\nGo to Edit > Select All > Copy.\nOpen Igor Pro 8 software and go to Window > Select New Table > Paste.",
    "In Igor Pro 8, go to Windows > Select New Graph and assign gray values for Y waves and distance as X waves.\nFit x-axis intensity profiles with the equation f(x) = s(x) + g (x) (Vaithianathan et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), where s(x) is a sigmoid function that describes the transition from intracellular to extracellular background fluorescence at the edge of the cell, given by s(x) = b- (c/(1-exp((x1/2-x)/d))), and g(x) is a Gaussian function representing the fluorescence of RBP and SypHy, given by g(x) = a (exp (-(x-x0)2/w2)). The parameters x1/2 and x0 were taken as the x-axis positions of the plasma membrane and the fluorescence emitter, respectively. The parameter b is the intracellular background fluorescence, c is the extracellular background fluorescence, d is the slope factor of the sigmoid function, a is the peak amplitude of emitter fluorescence, and w is √2∗ the standard deviation of the Gaussian function. In practice, the latter parameters were highly constrained by the data or by the measured PSF, essentially leaving only x1/2 and x0 as free parameters in the fitting. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B)\nNote: New fit functions can be entered in the Igor Pro 8 Curve Fitting panel under Function and Data.\nWe identified 81 putative SypHy events out of 1453 x-t line scans in response to sustained depolarization from different ribbons (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). (Vaithianathan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) The control experiment was performed by acquiring x-t line scans in the absence of depolarization (named as null events). Single SypHy molecule fluorescence can be confirmed by imaging a fixed single GFP molecule (Vaithianathan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: Since cells from the SypHy zebrafish line express SypHy sparsely, the success rate of obtaining SypHy fluorescence occurs with low probability (5.6%).",
    "Analyze the time-axis profile of the x-t line scan to determine the temporal profile of SypHy fluorescence with respect to the ribbon and to obtain the kinetics of the SypHy event. This can be obtained using ImageJ and Igor Pro8 software, as detailed below:\nScale the time profile (X axis) with appropriate information. Reorient the x-t scan as demonstrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and obtained the temporal profile (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) as indicated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nEvent amplitude: The difference between baseline amplitude and peak amplitude is defined as the event amplitude. The baseline can be determined by averaging the fluorescence obtained immediately before the depolarization. The timing of depolarization and amplitude of calcium current can be obtained from the Patch Master software. To measure the so-called peak amplitude, we identified the maximum value that occurred early during the SypHy event and averaged 5 points centered around the peak. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nNote: Single molecule amplitude can vary, depending on where the event occurred. Because the z-axis thickness of our optical section was appreciable on the scale of our x-y image, one concern was that SypHy fusion events in the z-axis could provide variable event amplitude for the fusions that occurred at the top of the ribbon or the bottom of the optical section. To define the smallest event amplitude, we randomly chose 203 out of 1372 null events and measured “event amplitudes” by taking the difference between the average fluorescence immediately after the depolarization and at the baseline, averaging 5 measurements. To evaluate the imaging noise, we follow the same approach to measure SypHy and nulls except that noise measurements were made in the absence of a stimulus.",
    "Dwell time: We observed that SypHy events remained at ribbon locations before declining to baseline. We defined the period during which they remained visible as the event duration or dwell time. We quantified dwell time by measuring the duration of fluorescence between the time of the SypHy event and the time at which fluorescence declined to 1s (68% of event amplitude). (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B)\nEnsemble averages: To analyze the properties of SypHy clearance, we categorized events as described below and averaged each group by synchronizing them with the event onset. To compare the SypHy events that occurred at different times after depolarization, we grouped the events as those that occurred within 30 ms of the start of depolarization (burst events) and those that occurred after 500 ms (sustained events). For a locus of fusion with respect to the ribbon, we grouped SypHy events based on their locations relative to the center of the ribbon in the x-dimension (x0 as defined above). SypHy events that occurred at x0 > 50 nm were classified as membrane proximal events, while those that occurred at x0 ≤ 50 nm were classified as membrane distal events.\nWe obtained averages of ensemble events to compare between different categories and established a Monte Carlo simulation of a molecule undergoing a 2D random walk illuminated by a line scan.

    "(B) Spatial (x-axis) intensity profile of x-t raster scan of SypHy (green) and RBP (red) in A. The green dash line is centroid (x0) of the Gauss decline fit of the SypHy fluorescence and red dash line is plasma membrane position (x1/2) of the Gauss decline fit of the RBP fluorescence. The black dash lines are ± 1 σ of the centroid (x0) and were used to define the ROI in lower scan in C (white dash line).\n(C) Temporal intensity profile (time-axis) of RBP and SypHy fluorescence intensity is obtained by reorienting the x-t scan as indicated by the arrow (top).

Kinetic parameters of single SypHy events\n(A) Example of averaged temporal intensity profile of SypHy fluorescence intensity. Event amplitude is measured between “peak” amplitude of SypHy event and the baseline. The peak amplitude is defined by averaging 5 points of maximum value that occurred early during the SypHy event (red dash line indicates start of SypHy event), and baseline is the average fluorescence obtained immediately before depolarization. The voltage protocol shown at the top (red).\n(B) Dwell time is the duration of SypHy events remain at fusion sites with different durations before declining to baseline fluorescence. Dwell time is quantified by measuring the duration between the time of SypHy event occurrence (red dash line), to fluorescence decline to 1σ (68%, black solid line) of event amplitude (black shades).\n(C) Histogram of the event of the 81 SypHy events as shown before in original publication (Vaithianathan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B (Inset)"
