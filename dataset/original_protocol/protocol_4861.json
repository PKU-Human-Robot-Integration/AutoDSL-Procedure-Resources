    "Before isolation of myofibersBorosilicate glass Pasteur pipets ends are too sharp for myofibers. Flame polish them to smooth the end portion and then autoclave (see Note 1).Autoclave one set of tools containing one small pair of scissors and forceps in a sterilization pouch for extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle removal from mouse hind limbs.Coat 6-well plates with around 1 ml of horse serum (horse serum is used to study satellite cells activation as it keeps myofibers suspended). Let plates sit for 1 min, then remove excess (that you can put back in the original bottle to re-use multiple times, if kept sterile). Avoid bubbles. Leave plates open to dry (drying requires ~20 min). Close plates once they are dried and leave under hood at room temperature till ready to use. These plates will be used for isolation and culturing of myofibers following digestion of EDL muscle with collagenase. Following the recipe, prepare base of digestion medium (see Note 2).Following the recipe, prepare collagenase II (see Note 3).Following the recipe, prepare washing solution. To wash EDL muscle before digestion, prepare a 6-well plate with 3 ml per well of washing solution. Each well is specific for one pair of EDL muscles (right and left). There will be 3 washes per pair of EDL.Muscle removal and washingEuthanize mouse by administrating an IP injection of Avertin (2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol) at a dose of 250 mg/kg, followed by cervical dislocation.Spray 70% ethanol on the whole body and pin the mouse face up.Shave hair around hind limb area and gently remove the skin using autoclaved scissors and forceps (see Note 4).Remove carefully fascia surrounding right tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Step-wise procedure for the isolation of EDL muscle from mouse Remove carefully TA muscle without damaging underneath EDL muscle (see Note 5).",
    "The first muscle removed is TA muscle which can be discarded (Video 1).Remove carefully EDL muscle (Figure 1). Second muscle removed in Video 1 is EDL muscle. Avoid stretching of muscle during and after isolation (see Notes 5-7).Put EDL muscle in the well containing washing solution (first wash).Perform isolation of the other side EDL (try to do this step within next 5 min).Put EDL muscle in the same well as the other EDL muscle. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160922/20160922225313_9423.jpgFigure 1.

Arrow points to the tendon of EDL muscle; C. Separating EDL muscle from tendon to tendon; D. Isolation of EDL muscle by cutting distal tendons.Spray the 6-well plate with 70% ethanol before putting it under the biosafety cabinet.Perform second and third washes (30 sec each), by transferring EDL muscle to the next well containing washing solution.Muscle digestion Following the recipe, complete the preparation of digestion medium by adding 400 U/ml of collagenase II to the base of digestion medium. Filter the digestion medium with a 0.22 µm filter.Take a new 6-well plate and put 5 ml of digestion medium per well (for two EDL muscles).Take autoclaved forceps and remove EDL muscles from the 6-well plate used for washing and put them in the 6-well plate containing digestion medium.Put the 6-well plate containing EDL muscles for 1.5 h to 2 h in a CO2 incubator set at 37 °C and 5% of CO2. After the first hour of digestion, check the condition of digesting EDL muscles by putting the 6-well plate under an inverted microscope and visualizing if single myofibers are released from the EDL muscle (see Note 8).",
    "Using sterile Pasture pipette and digestion medium, gently triturate EDL muscle to accelerate dissociation of single myofibers. Avoid over-digestion in collagenase (Figure 2). Excessive digestion generally results in the isolation of hyper-contracted myofibers (see Note 9). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160922/20160922225545_8709.jpgFigure 2. Digestion of EDL muscle using collagenase. Representative phase contrast microscopy images presented here show the morphology of good quality EDL muscle at different stages of collagen digestion (top panel). Top-left image shows tightly bundled fibers of EDL muscle prior to digestion. Top-middle image demonstrates partial dissociation of connective tissue at about 45 min of start of collagenase treatment. Top-right image depicts complete digestion and release of myofibers from EDL muscle. Lower panel images demonstrate corresponding phases of muscle digestion in an improperly isolated EDL muscle. Scale bar = 100 µm.Isolation and culturing of myofibersFollowing the recipe, prepare myofiber growth medium (MfGM).Coat autoclaved Pasteur pipets with horse serum (horse serum prevents myofibers from sticking to glass pipet).Take a new 6-well plate and put 2 ml of MfGM per well (for neutralization of collagenase activity following EDL muscle digestion).Remove 6-well plate containing EDL muscle from the incubator. Observe EDL muscle under the microscope to ensure normal structure and shape of single myofibers.Transfer digested EDL muscles (using autoclaved-flame polished Pasteur pipet) to a new 6-well plate containing 2 ml of MfGM in three wells (see Note 10). Transfer digested EDL muscles from one well to the next in a serial manner with autoclaved Pasteur pipet. Allow digested EDL’s to set in each of the 3 wells for 30 sec. This will neutralize the collagenase enzymatic activity and stop the digestion process. Take 6-well plates coated previously with horse serum and put 3 ml of MfGM per well (for culturing of myofibers).Transfer neutralized EDL muscles in the coated 6-well plate containing MfGM (i.e., well #1).",
    "Using autoclaved coated Pasture pipet, gently flush EDL muscle and myofiber bundles with MfGM. Do not vigorously triturate the muscle as it can cause damage to myofibers (see Note 11).Transfer the EDL muscles from well #1 to well #2. Flush gently EDL with autoclaved coated Pasteur pipet.Move the EDL muscles from well #2 to well #3 and repeat the same process until well #6. The goal is to have myofibers from EDL muscles in each well. Representative images of isolated single myofibers are presented in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160922/20160922225905_3953.jpgFigure 3. Images of normal and hypercontracted isolated single myofiber cultures. Left image represents isolated single myofibers following a successful isolation. Fibers are mostly straight and translucent and their surface is clear of any shears or tears. Right image shows fiber morphology following an inadequate preparation. Red arrows point to hypercontracted fibers while blue arrows point to fragmented fibers. Scale bar = 100 µm.Observe EDL myofibers under the microscope for their shape and structure (see Note 12).Put the 6-well plate containing EDL myofibers in a CO2 incubator set at 37 °C and 5% of CO2. If analysis of satellite cells is desired in the quiescent stage, fix myofibers immediately and proceed to staining. For studying activation of satellite cells, culture myofibers for desired time points. Normally, large satellite cell clusters are observed at 72 h post isolation.Immunostaining of satellite cells for Pax7 and MyoD proteinWith a pipette, carefully remove 2 ml of MfGM, leaving remaining 1 ml with myofibers (see Note 13). Fix myofibers by adding 1 ml of 4% PFA to each well containing myofibers and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT). With a pipette, carefully remove MfGM and 4% PFA, leaving myofibers inside the well. Add 1 ml of 4% PFA to each well.",
    "Incubate the plates for 10 min at RT.Carefully remove 4% PFA solution while leaving myofibers inside the well.Wash each well containing myofibers with 1 ml of PBS. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove PBS leaving myofibers inside the well. Repeat this step 2 times (2 x 5 min).Prepare quenching solution.Add 2 ml of quenching solution to each well. Incubate for 7 to 10 min at RT. Carefully remove quenching solution, leaving myofibers inside the well.Wash wells with 1 ml of PBS. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Remove PBS and leave myofibers inside the well. Repeat this step 3 times (3 x 5 min).Prepare blocking solution.Add 1 ml of blocking solution to each well. Incubate for 60 min at RT. Using Pasture pipet, transfer myofibers from the 6-well plate to a 24-well plate (to minimize the quantity of reagents used). Make 1:100 dilution of MyoD antibody in blocking solution. Similarly, make 1:5 dilution of Pax7 antibody in blocking solution. Carefully remove blocking solution while leaving myofibers inside the well.Add 100 µl of each diluted antibody solution per well of the 24-well plate containing myofibers. After this, the final dilution of anti-MyoD will be 1:200 and anti-Pax7 will be 1:10. Incubate the plate overnight at 4 °C.Next day, remove primary antibody solution from each well while leaving myofibers inside the well.Add 200 μl of PBS to each well of the 24-well plate for washing myofibers. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Remove PBS from the wells and add fresh PBS. Repeat this step 3 times (3 x 5 min).Make 1:1,500 dilution of two secondary antibody (i.e., goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate) in blocking solution.Add 200 µl of secondary antibodies solution to the well.",
    "Incubate for 60 min at RT in the dark.Remove secondary antibodies from each well while leaving myofibers inside.Add 200 μl of PBS to each well and incubate for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove PBS and leave the myofibers inside the well. Repeat this step 3 times (3 x 5 min).Make 1:5,000 dilution of DAPI in PBS.Add 200 µl of diluted DAPI solution to each well. Incubate for 3 min at RT in the dark.Remove DAPI from each well, leaving myofibers inside.Add 200 μl of PBS to each well. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Remove PBS while leaving myofibers inside the well. Repeat this step 2 times (2 x 5 min).Finally, add 200 μl of PBS to each well.Analyze the myofiber-associated satellite cells for the expression of MyoD (green) and Pax7 (red) under a fluorescent microscope. Representative individual anti-MyoD, anti-Pax7, DAPI stained and merged images generated using this protocol have been published in our recent publications (Hindi and Kumar, 2016; Ogura et al., 2015). A representative image of staining of satellite cell cluster on myofibers after 72 h of culturing is presented in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160922/20160922230341_9526.jpgFigure 4.
