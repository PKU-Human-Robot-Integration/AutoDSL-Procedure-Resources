    "Generation of fluorescently tagged proteinsFuse either EGFP or mKate2 (far red) (see Notes 1, 4, 5, 6) to the C-terminus or other suitable sites of the protein of interest using unique restriction enzyme sites present in the expression vectors. Add restriction enzyme sites as needed via PCR or by first transferring to other vectors with multiple restriction sites prior to subcloning into pSLIK or FUGW. If suitable sites for tags are in between domains, add restriction enzyme sites, linker sequences, and tags by patch PCR (Squinto et al., 1990).Subclone the resultant fusion protein cDNA into a doxycycline inducible-lentiviral vector, e.g., modified pSLIK (Addgene #25737) using the Gateway LR Clonase II or the constitutively expressing modified pFUGW lentiviral vector (Addgene #14883) using the unique restriction sites present in this vector. Details of the constructs used for live imaging have been described previously (Dzhashiashivili et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012; Bekku and Salzer, 2020).Lentivirus productionCoat 100-mm dishes with 5 ml poly-L-lysine (10 μg/ml; P5899, No.11 in the reagent list) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature; rinse 3 times with PBS at room temperature.Seed dishes with 6 × 106 293FT cells 24 h prior to transfection and allow cell density to reach ~90% confluence at the time of transfection.Add fresh HEK293 cell medium (5 ml) 30-60 min before transfection.Transfect 293FT cells with 5 μg pSLIK or FUGW lentiviral constructs together with helper plasmids Δ8.9 (6.25 μg) and VSVg (3.3 μg) using the LipoD293TM in vitro DNA transfection reagent.Replace the DNA/LipoD293 complex containing medium with 7 ml HEK293 cell medium 5 h after transfection.Collect media from the cultures 48 h after transfection and transfer to 50-ml centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge for 15 min at 1,700 × g at room temperature and filter the supernatants through a 0.45-μm filter unit.",
    "Filtered supernatants are aliquoted as 0.6-ml samples and stored at -80°C until use.Preparation of dissociated rat DRG neuron cultures and myelinating co-cultures for live imagingCoat the glass coverslip at the bottom of each MatTek dish with 0.5 mg/ml PLL (P1274, No.12 in the reagent list) in 300 μl PBS. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, then wash 3 times with PBS.Next, coat the glass coverslips with 10 μg/ml laminin in 200 μl PBS. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.Prepare dissociated E15-E16 rat DRG neuron cultures for growth as neuron-only cultures or myelinating cocultures as per previously published protocols (Taveggia and Bolino, 2018). Briefly, remove DRGs from rat embryos, incubate them with 1.5 ml trypsin at 37°C for 45 min, add 1 ml C medium, dissociate DRG neurons by repetitive pipetting to triturate ganglia, and centrifuge cells at 193 × g at room temperature for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet by gentle trituration in ~200 μl CF medium containing penicillin-streptomycin (PS) per DRG. Seed dissociated rat DRG neurons, corresponding to the equivalent of 1 ganglion (approx. 2.1 × 104 cells), onto the Matek PLL/laminin-coated coverslip and incubate for 24 h.Cultures are cycled on NBF and NB media every other day for a total of 12 days to deplete all non-neuronal cells, leaving neuron-only cultures.To establish myelinating co-cultures, add 3 × 105 post-natal rat SCs to neuron-only cultures. SCs are prepared from sciatic nerves, and individual aliquots can be stored in liquid N2 as previously described (Kim and Maurel, 2009). To initiate myelination, after 5 days, add vitamin C to the C media to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml; this concentration of vitamin C does not affect the pH of the medium. Myelination typically ensues several days after adding vitamin C.",
    "Dual viral infection and induction of fluorescently tagged proteins in neuron-only and myelinating coculturesDilute the first viral supernatant in C medium containing PS. For neuron-only cultures, add 1:1 (virus: C medium) diluted mKate2-tagged pSLIK virus to one-day-old DRG neuron cultures. For myelinating co-cultures, add 1:1 (virus: C medium) diluted EGFP-tagged pSLIK virus to one-day-old neuron cultures. Incubate cultures with viral supernatants for 24 h.The next day, dilute the second viral supernatant in C medium containing PS. For neuron-only cultures, change the viral medium to freshly diluted EGFP-tagged pSLIK virus (1:1 dilution). For co-cultures, replace the viral medium with new diluted mKate2-tagged FUGW virus (dilution 1:15 of virus: C medium) onto the neuron culture (see Note 9). Incubate for 24 h.Remove the viral medium, add NBF, and culture the infected neurons for an additional 1-2 days until expression is induced. If longer incubation times are desirable to allow further neuron growth, change the medium to NB for an additional 2 days.Add 2 µg/ml doxycycline (final concentration) to either NB or NBF in neuron-only cultures depending on the medium cycle on the day doxycycline is added, or into C plus vitamin C in co-cultures to induce protein expression 24-48 h before live imaging (see Note 8).Note: The schematic time courses of the experiment for neuron only cultures and myelinating cultures (procedures C and D) are shown in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4067/bioprotoc-11-12-4067-g001.jpgFigure 1. Time course of the dual-color live imaging Live imagingChange medium to live imaging media immediately prior to live imaging.Place cultures growing on a MatTek dish onto a 37°C heated microscope stage (Heat Insert P) connected to a temperature control unit (Tempcontrol 37-2).Determine the direction of axonal transport for each vesicle relative to the position of the neuronal soma before or at the onset of live imaging.",
    "Capture images at 2 s intervals for ≥2 min with CCD cameras and the 100× objective (see Notes 2, 3, 8) using the perfect focus setting of the NIS-Elements Advanced Research Software (Nikon) to correct focus drift. Process images using real time deconvolution of the NIS-Elements Advanced Research Software. EGFP-tagged proteins were captured with a GFP filter cube (96362, Nikon); those for mKate2 were captured with a 594-nm laser bandpass set filter (49911, Chroma) cube. See the representative still images of dual color live imaging in Figure 2.Take images of more than 20 neurons for analysis. Loss of focus due to microscope stage drift may require refocusing and may also reduce image numbers available for generating kymographs.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4067/bioprotoc-11-12-4067-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative still images of vesicular co-transport and independent transport. Upper panels: Vesicles containing NF186-mKate2 and NrCAM-EGFP are anterogradely co-transported in the axon as evidenced by the yellow color from the overlap of mKate2-labeled NF186 and EGFP-labeled NrCAM in the same vesicles; an example of co-transported vesicles is highlighted by the yellow arrow. Lower panels: Vesicles containing NF186-mKate2 and Navβ1-EGFP are transported separately in the retrograde direction along the axon; examples of vesicles containing Navβ1-EGFP only are highlighted by the white arrows."
