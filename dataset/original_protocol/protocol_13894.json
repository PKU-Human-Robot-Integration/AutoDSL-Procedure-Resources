    "We designed a prospective, observational, single-center study evaluating the feasibility of tracheal intubation using the RTL with the approval of the University Ethics Committee no 432/24.11.2016 and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03341507. The study involved adult patients with ASA physical status 1–3, requiring general anesthesia for ear, parotid, and rhino-sinus surgery and having a presumed anatomically difficult airway as calculated with The Simplified Airway Risk Index (SARI) score8, with a score ≥ 5, and no airway pathology.\nNOTE: The pre-anesthetic exam focused on airway evaluation aiming to select patients with a modified Cormack-Lehane7 grade of glottic visualization ≥2b. The Cormack-Lehane classification defines the grade of glottis view during laryngoscopy, ranging from unrestricted glottic visualization-grade 1 to inability to see any laryngeal structure-grade 4. The SARI score8 is a multivariate risk score for predicting difficult tracheal intubation. A SARI score of 4 or above, 12 being maximum, enhances the chances of difficult intubation. Seven parameters contribute to the SARI score: mouth opening, thyromental distance, movement of the neck, Mallampati score, the ability to create an underbite, body weight, and previous intubation history.\n1. Patient and equipment preparation\nPremedicate with 1 or 2 mg of midazolam intravenously for 10 min upon patient transportation in the operating theatre.\nHave the patient lie on the operating table with their head placed at a tilt in a sniffing position.\nApply standard hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring: ECG, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory frequency, end-tidal CO2. Monitor patient anesthesia depth using bispectral index monitoring.\nMake sure that an experienced anesthetist or ENT physician is available in case of an emergency.",
    "Prepare a suction device with a suction probe in place and a difficult airway kit at hand. Prepare and check the connective piece with the light source attached with a set of rigid tubes of various sizes: three tubes that are 15-20 cm long with a 1.2-1.8 cm diameter for women and three tubes that are 20-25 cm long with a 1.2-2 cm diameter for men.\nIdentify the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) by palpation of the anterior neck. Ask the patient to swallow and gently palpate the anterior neck with the thumb, the index, and the middle finger. The thyroid cartilage is the structure that moves while the patient swallows.\n\t\nAsk the patient to extend the head and measure the distance between the labial commissure and the thyroid cartilage in a straight line using the thumb and the middle finger. Hold a rigid tube in the other hand while performing the measurement. The mandible impedes the use of a ruler to measure this distance.\nNote the length obtained on the rigid tube prepared, starting from its tip. Do this by directly translating the two fingers used to measure the distance mentioned in the previous step on the rigid tube.\nExpect to find the glottis when using the RTL at a depth equal with the distance between the labial commissure and thyroid cartilage. For a better grip and a useful lever effect, use a tube with a length of about double the above-measured distance.\n2. Induction of general anesthesia and conventional laryngoscopy\nPreoxygenate the patients for 5 min and start anesthesia induction with 2-3 µg/kg fentanyl, 2-3 mg/kg propofol, and 1-1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. Monitor the depth of anesthesia by checking the bispectral index level.",
    "After 1 min of mask ventilation with a pause during generalized muscular fasciculation provoked by succinylcholine, perform standard laryngoscopy with a curved blade laryngoscope, and register the modified Cormack-Lehane glottis visualization grade.\n\t\nIf the noticed degree is <2b, resume the tracheal intubation conventionally with the curved blade laryngoscope.\nIf the glottis view grade is ≥2b, meaning that, at the best, part of the arytenoids and the epiglottis are visible, withdraw the Macintosh laryngoscope, and maneuver further with the RTL.\n\t\tCAUTION: If the mask ventilation is impossible or not efficient, the airway should be secured promptly following the institutional guidelines.\n3. Tracheal intubation with the rigid tube\nCover the upper molars with a rubber teeth protector or a cotton swab on the side of the approach.\nIntroduce the RTL in the oral cavity at the level of the right or left labial commissure with the bevel facing the superior arcade, the prismatic light deflector, and a functioning light source attached, held with the dominant hand with the light deflector inside the palm and the index following the tube.\n\t\nStart with a 1.5-1.8 cm diameter tube to maximize the visual field.\nDisplace the tongue gently to the contralateral site.\nIf the pathology does not require otherwise, a righthanded practitioner should use the right retromolar space for approach.\nUse the nondominant hand to open the patient’s mouth, hyperextend the patient's head, and advance the RTL towards the pharynx.\nApply gentle pressure on the proximal end of the RTL against the protected superior molars as the tip of the tube is reaching the hypopharynx. That way, the tip of the RTL orientates anteriorly on the direction of the glottis.\n\tNOTE: The thyroid cartilage is a landmark when moving the tip of the RTL from the retromolar space towards the midline.",
    "If the epiglottis, the glottis or part of it is not getting into sight, withdraw the tube. At the second attempt, insert the tube in the oral cavity at the level of the incisors as that may make the tongue base and epiglottis easier to access. Once the epiglottis is in sight, slide the tube towards the labial commissure, keeping its tip in place, and advance further.\nAspirate the secretions as needed with a flexible suction probe inserted through the RTL.\nAdjust the position of the larynx with the nondominant hand by gently pushing the thyroid cartilage and follow an imaginary line towards the thyroid cartilage as it improves the time needed for proper glottis visualization.\n\t\tNOTE: When moving the cartilage while looking through the tube, the motion translates to the inner structures around the glottis and helps the practitioner orientate to reach his target.\nAdvance the RTL slowly until it reaches the epiglottis, and then lift the epiglottis with the tip of the device. Make sure that the bevel is oriented posteriorly. At that point, the vocal cords are visible at the distal end of the tube.\n\t\nIf, after lifting the epiglottis, the glottis is not in the visual field, consider using a smaller diameter RTL.\nOnce the glottis is in sight, place the intubating tube introducer through the RTL into the trachea. Do not insert the introducer too vigorously because the bronchial injury may occur.\n\t\nDo not advance any more as soon as the glottis is visible after lifting the epiglottis because of the risk of vocal cord injury.\nExtract the rigid tube.\nPlace a standard cuffed lubricated intubating tube over the introducer into the trachea. Do not use force and gently rotate the intubating tube while advancing.",
    "Make sure there is only a small gap between the inner diameter of the intubating tube and the introducer to reduce the chance of impingement.\nOnce the intubating tube is at the proper depth, 20-24 cm from the labial commissure, remove the intubating tube introducer leaving the intubating tube in place.\nInflate the cuff and confirm tracheal intubation through lung auscultation and capnography.\nInspect the upper lip and the teeth for damage. Be aware that the intubation over an intubating tube introducer carries the risk of vocal cords injury. Check the patient for sore throat and voice disturbance after surgery.\n\tCAUTION: Stop the maneuver if it exceeds 100 s or if the patient desaturates to 80% and resume mask ventilation or an alternative method of securing the airway.\nSubscription Required.
