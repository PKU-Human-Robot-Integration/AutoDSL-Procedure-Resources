    "All work has been approved by the University of Michigan’s internal review board.\n1. Optimizing primary antibodies and slide preparation\nDetermine ideal concentration of antibodies for multiplex using conventional IHC.\nTest the antibodies for the multiplex by manual conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC)13.\nUse specific tissues that have an abundant cell type for each antibody tested such as using tonsil tissue for CD3 antibody testing.\nUse the reference concentration for IHC recommended by the company and then complete IHC with antibody concentrations at the recommended concentrations as well as concentrations above and below the recommended concentration.\nPrepare formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue onto slides.\nUsing a microtome, cut blocks of FFPE tissue at a thickness between 4 and 6 µm and apply to charged slides.NOTE: Using distilled water ensures proper tissue mounting and adherence throughout the multiplex.\nPlace the slides flat, tissue side up, and allow to dry at 37 °C overnight.\nStore slides in a slide box away from extreme temperature until ready to complete the multiplex.\n2. General staining method\nPreparation of wash and antigen retrieval solutions\nPrepare the wash solution of 0.1% TBST by mixing 9 L of deionized water, 1 L of tris buffered saline (TBS) and 10 mL of polysorbate 20.\nPrepare both antigen retrieval solutions (pH 6 and pH 9; Table of Materials) by diluting to 1x with deionized water.\nDeparaffinization and rehydration\nBake slides, lying flat, tissue side up at 60 °C for 1 h in a hybridization oven1. Remove slides from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5−10 min then place in a vertical slide rack.\nTreat the slides in the following solutions sequentially: xylene in triplicate, followed by a single treatment of 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and lastly 70% ethanol for 10 min each using a slide staining set1.",
    "Wash the rack of slides for 2 min with deionized water by submersion in a plastic slide box followed by fixation by submersion in a plastic slide box filled with neutral buffered formalin for 30 min13. Wash the slides in deionized water for 2 min then proceed to antigen retrieval.\nAntigen retrieval\nPlace the rack of slides into a heat resistant box filled to the internal line (approximately 300 mL) with pH 6 or pH 9 antigen retrieval buffer.NOTE: Antigen retrieval buffer can be either pH 6 or pH 9 which may need to be optimized per epitope. However, start by using pH 9 for antibodies that bind to nuclear epitopes and pH 6 for all other antibodies.\nCover the box with plastic wrap and use a rubber band to secure. Place the box into the microwave at the edge of the rotating plate (microwave must be equipped with inverter technology for even heating). Heat the slides for 45 s at 100% power followed by 15 min at 20% power13.NOTE: Microwave treatment may need optimization depending on the microwave used.\nLet the slides cool for approximately 15−20 min.\nPrepare working solutions of antibodies and fluorophores while slides cool.\nPrepare the primary antibody diluent by dissolving 0.5 g of bovine serum albumin granules into 50 mL of TBST. Alternatively, use 50 mL of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to dissolve granules.\nMake each primary antibody working solution to the optimized concentration determined in section 1, in the primary antibody diluent. Estimate approximately 200 µL per slide.\nPrepare the fluorophore working solution by diluting each fluorophore in the fluorophore diluent at a concentration of 1:100.NOTE: This may need to be optimized depending on the antibody. Estimate approximately 100 µL per slide.",
    "On the last day of staining, prepare the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) working solution by adding 3 drops of DAPI into 1 mL of TBST.\nSlide staining (washing and blocking)\nRemove the box from the microwave after cooling and take off the plastic wrap, wash the slides with deionized water for 2 min followed by a 2 min wash in a plastic slide box filled TBST13.\nAfter drying each slide around the tissue with a delicate task wipe careful not to let the tissue dry out, trace around the outside of the tissue using a hydrophobic barrier pen. Do not touch the tissue with the delicate task wipe or pen.\nPlace each slide in the humidified chamber and add blocking solution (approximately 4 drops) to the tissue. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nSlide staining (primary antibody application)\nTake each slide and remove the blocking solution by tapping the side of the slide on a stack of paper towels and using a delicate task wipe to remove excess blocking agent from around the tissue.\nLay the slide back into the humidified chamber and add approximately 200 µL of the working primary antibody. Incubate in the humidified chamber for 1 h at RT.\nWash with TBST for 2 min by submersion in triplicate13.NOTE: After each washing step, changing the TBST will help ensure a cleaner image.\nSlide staining (secondary antibody application)",
    "Dab off the remaining TBST from each slide and apply approximately 3 to 4 drops of secondary antibody (mixture of rabbit and mouse secondary HRP conjugated antibodies). Incubate for 10 min in the humidified chamber at RT13.NOTE: If planning to use a primary antibody that requires a secondary antibody other than mouse or rabbit or choosing to use an alternative secondary antibody, apply the appropriate HRP conjugated secondary to the slides and incubate at RT for 45 min. Optimization of incubation time may be needed for the alternative secondary14.\nAfter incubation, wash with TBST for 2 min in triplicate13.\nSlide staining (fluorophore application)\nApply approximately 100 µL of the fluorophore working solution and incubate in the humidified chamber at RT for 10 min13.\nWash with TBST for 2 min in triplicate13.\nRemoval of antibodies\nMicrowave slides (45 s at 100% then 15 min at 20%) in the heat resistant box (see step 2.3.2) for removal of antibodies13,14.NOTE: This completes one round of the multiplex. This is the only point at which the protocol can be paused. To pause the protocol, leave the slides submerged in the antigen retrieval buffer overnight at room temperature.\nContinue additional rounds of staining. Repeat steps 2.5.1−2.9.1 for the rest of the antibody-fluorophore pairs. Once all antibodies and fluorophores have been used, proceed to section 2.11.\nDAPI application and mounting\nAfter the last staining round in the multiplex, remove the last antibody application with antigen retrieval solution pH 613. Wash with deionized water followed by TBST for 2 min each13.\nApply approximately 150 µL of the working DAPI solution to slides and incubate in the humidified chamber for 10 min at RT1.",
    "Wash with TBST for approximately 30 s and mount coverslips with an antifade mountant. Apply clear fingernail polish at the four corners of the coverslip once the mounting media has dried to secure coverslip (optional).\n3. Details for library, monoplexes, and multiplex\nChoose slides for building a fluorophore library.\nFor a 7-color multiplex gather 7 immune cell rich tissue slides (i.e., tonsil, spleen, etc.) for the library.NOTE: Choose control slides to be used for a fluorophore library with each slide representing each unique fluorophore that will be used in the multiplex. Control slides should have an abundant epitope of choice and may be the same type of tissue for each fluorophore.\nStain and image library slides for use with monoplexes and multiplexes.\nFollow steps 2.1−2.9.1 using the control slides and control tissue slides of choice. Place a different fluorophore on each slide at a concentration of 1:100; one slide should contain only DAPI.\nProceed to section 2.11 except omit DAPI staining and instead use TBST and mount as described.\nAfter letting slides dry overnight, image with all channels DAPI, CY3, CY5, CY7, Texas Red, semiconductor quantum dots, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) setting the exposure to 250 ms with the saturation protection feature1.NOTE: The exposure times can be set at 50−250 ms13.\nUpload the library images onto the software and use in the analysis of the monoplexes and multiplex.\nChoose slides for monoplexes.\nChoose control slides that have an abundant epitope of choice based on optimized antibodies (section 1). For every round of staining to be done in the multiplex, select that number of control slides to create monoplexes.NOTE: The purpose of the monoplex is to determine the best position (order) for each antibody to be used in the multiplex.\nStain monoplexes.",
    "Follow sections 2.1−2.11 using the primary antibody at a different order (position) for each of the slides. Each slide should have only one primary antibody applied at an order (position) different than the other slides.NOTE: For each slide where the round calls for no primary antibody or fluorophore, instead use primary antibody diluent and fluorophore diluent13.\nImage slides and analyze the monoplex.\nUsing the microscope and setting the exposure time to 250 ms for all channels capture each image utilizing DAPI to focus.NOTE: The exposure times can be set at 50−250 ms14.\nUsing the analysis software evaluate each monoplex slide by looking at the fluorescent intensity of the stained marker.\nCompare this intensity to the background. If it is at least 5−10 times higher than the background, the position of that slide is an optimal position to use in the final multiplex.\nChoose slides for the multiplex.\nChoose the slides of interest and add an extra slide to be used as a blank slide for subtraction of autofluorescence after staining and imaging.\nStain the multiplex.\nBased on the monoplex results, choose the appropriate order (positions) for each antibody based on step 3.5.3. Assign each fluorophore to an antibody.NOTE: This may need optimization; however, plan to use bright antibodies for less abundant markers1, co-localizing antibodies should be matched with fluorophores at far spectrums from each other13, and fluorophores with the spectrum 540 and 570 should not be co-localized due to spectral overlap issues1.\nProceed with sections 2.1−2.11 ensuring the blank slide does not receive primary antibody, fluorophore, or DAPI, instead use antibody diluent, fluorophore diluent, and TBST respectively in its place.\nImage multiplex and analyze for integrity of staining\nUsing the microscope and setting the exposure time to 250 ms for all channels, capture each image utilizing DAPI to focus.",
    "Using the analysis software (Table of Materials), evaluate each multiplex by fluorescent false color.NOTE: A clear image should demonstrate each marker clearly. If a marker looks diffuse and grainy or is nonexistent, it is likely that the marker didn’t work and needs to be re-optimized.\nUsing the analysis software, evaluate each multiplex by pathology view. Pathology view will confirm the specificity of each marker. Compare to IHC previously optimized (section 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
