    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-operative managements\nTiming: 10 min\nThe protocol is based on one mouse per time. The procedure can be performed two to four mice in a row, depending on personal skills, assistants and equipment. At least 6 mice per group is suggested to obtain statistically relevant results. Pre-operative preparations will be introduced in this section, including anesthetic agents, mouse positioning, and surgical site preparation.\nRecord body weight of each mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 10 uL anesthetic solution per gram of body weight for a mouse (Ketamine 0.1 mg/g and xylazine 0.01 mg/g).\nPrepare the anesthetic solution by adding 2 mL of Ketamine (50 mg/mL) and 0.2 mL of xylazine (50 mg/mL) in 7.8 mL of phosphate buffered saline.\nNote: The duration of immobilization and anesthesia was at least 40 and 28 min, respectively (Kawai et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPlace the anaesthetized mouse in the prone position upon the feedback-controlled heating pads to maintain the mice body temperature at 36.8°C–37.3°C.\nNote: Secure the limbs with surgical tapes for fully extension.\nGently insert the mini rectal thermistor probe into the rectum to record body temperature.\nShave a 4 × 2.5 cm flank area in the surgical site or a 4 × 5 cm area for bilateral renal IRI by an electrical razor.\nDisinfect the skin with cotton swabs soaked with povidone-iodine solution for 3 times. Remove the iodine solution with normal saline for 3 times.\nCover both of the mouse’s eyes with lubricant tetracycline hydrochloride ointment 1%.\nExpose and clamp the renal hilum\nTiming: 30 min for a mouse (depends on the duration of ischemia)\nIn this section, we introduce the surgical steps to expose the renal hilum via flank incisions, with minimum risk of intra-abdominal organ injury during dissection (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Note: The surgical procedures should be performed under aseptic conditions.\nMake a vertical flank incision for 1.5 cm by surgical scissors layer by layer through the skin, fascia and then muscle layer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nNote: The kidney is located at the middle 1/3 of the body, below the 13th rib and around 0.5 cm lateral to the spine.\nMobilize the kidney from the retroperitoneal fat with a 0.3 cm wide cotton swab in an outward direction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2060-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Main steps of the exposure of mouse renal hilum\n(A) Expose the kidney from the retroperitoneal space by cotton swab in an outward direction.\n(B–D) Liberate the renal pedicle (yellow dotted line) from the renal sinus fat with prevention of ureteral (black dotted line) and adrenal gland (black arrow) injury.\n(E) Placement of a pedicle clamp over the renal pedicle.\n(F) Repeat at the contralateral side as an optional procedure depending on the study design.\nCritical: Use normal-saline soaked cotton swabs to dissect the fascia and adipose tissue to prevent injury of kidney.\nDissect the peri-nephric fat with a cotton swab at the medial side of the kidney to expose the renal hilum (yellow dotted line, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Avoid grabbing the kidney with metallic forceps to prevent artificial trauma to the kidney during the dissection.\nDrill into the renal hilar fat with cotton swabs or forceps above and below the renal pedicle in order to create adequate space for pedicle clamp (yellow dotted line, Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nCritical: Redundant renal sinus fat left behind to the renal pedicle may lead to incomplete renal ischemia as a cushion during pedicle clamping.\nCritical: Avoid injury to the ureter embedded within the peri-hilar fat during vascular clamping (black dotted line, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Critical: Avoid adrenal gland embedded within the adipose tissue above the upper pole of the kidney (black arrow, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nApply the non-traumatic pedicle clamp to the renal pedicle gently (yellow dotted line, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSet the timer immediately for the planned ischemia interval.\nEnsure the successfulness of ischemia by observing the color change of the kidney into dusky appearance uniformly within few minutes (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2060-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expected changes of the kidney after ischemia-reperfusion injury\n(A) Appearance of the kidney after successful clamping.\n(B) Ineffective clamp leads to incomplete renal ischemia.\nReplace the kidney to the retroperitoneal space.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2060-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Stable body temperature intraoperatively with temperature controller\nNote: Keep body temperature stable at around 37°C during the planned ischemia interval.\nCritical: Body temperature control during operation is very important. Cold ischemia will attenuate the ischemia injury of kidney and may make experiments non-reproducible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRepeat the procedure at the contralateral side in the animal model designed for bilateral renal IRI (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Expose and clamp the renal hilum by flank incisions step by step, related to steps 1–17\nAccomplish and wound closure\nTiming: 10 min for a mouse\nReopen the wound and release the pedicle clamp at the end of the ischemia interval.\nCritical: Successful kidney reperfusion should be confirmed by the observation of rapid color change to its original color.\nReplace the kidney into the retroperitoneal space.\nGive 1 mL of 37°C pre-warmed 0.9% saline into the retroperitoneal space before wound closure.\nClose the wound with metallic staples, which will be removed after 7–10 days as the wound healed.\nPost-operative managements\nTiming: 1–14 days\nIn this part, we introduce postoperative pain control, wound care and specimen collection.",
    "Administer buprenorphine 0.05–0.10 mg/kg immediately and then every 8–12 h subcutaneously for 3 days or more for post-surgical pain control.\nNote: Monitor the presentation of pain by using the following criteria: poor appetite with absence of feces, dehydration with skin tenting, loss of mobility with a limb protecting the incisional site, failure to groom with dirty appearance, aggressive behaviors such as squealing or biting…etc.\nObserve the mice in the recovery rack with a temperature of 25°C–30°C for 30 min.\nMonitor the surgical wound every or every other day within one week.\nNote: Euthanize the mouse if wound infection or dehiscence is noticed.\nSacrifice the mice according to the experimental design. Collect the kidney specimen for histology and protein (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2060-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Injured and atrophic renal tubules (black arrow) with interstitial inflammatory cells infiltration (yellow arrow) are evident in post-IRI kidneys. Tubular injury score grade 4. Scale bar: 50 μm, magnification: 40×.\nFor histopathological analysis: store in 10% formalin at 15°C–30°C for 24 h. Change to 70% alcohol at 4°C on the next day.",
    "For frozen section: soak the sample in 4% PFA/PBS for 1–1.5 h, then change to 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for 24 h. On the next day, put the sample into OCT block, and then store with liquid nitrogen at −80°C immediately.\nSnap frozen for further protein and RNA analysis: drop the specimen in liquid nitrogen, and then store at −80°C."
