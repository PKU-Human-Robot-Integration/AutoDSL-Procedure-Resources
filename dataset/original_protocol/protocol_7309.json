    "E. coli transformation and protein purification  For this protocol, we performed the E. coli transformation and protein overexpression induction as described in the original MapR method paper (Yan and Sarma, 2020). We also described these steps in Jauregui-Lozano et al. (2022).Transform BL21 DE3 cells using 10 ng of plasmid and following manufacturer’s instructions from New England Biolabs.Plate transformed cells in LB media plates overnight at 37 °C.Pick a single colony and grow in liquid LB media supplemented with carbenicillin (1 μg/mL), at 37 °C and 225 rpm overnight.The next day, add 4.5 mL of liquid culture into 495 mL of liquid LB media supplemented with carbenicillin and incubate for 2–4 h at 37 °C and 225 rpm. After 2 h of incubation, check optical density of an aliquot of liquid culture until it reaches 0.6 as measured with a spectrophotometer.Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM.Incubate IPTG-containing liquid culture for 3 h at 37 °C and 225 rpm.Prepare fresh GST-wash/equilibration buffer and GST-elution buffer.Centrifuge bacterial lysate for 10 min at 8,000 × g in a cold centrifuge.Remove supernatant and resuspend bacterial pellet in 5 mL of cold PBS buffer with cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor.Sonicate using Branson sound amplifier with amplitude 20% and 5 cycles of 15 s on–45 s off. Make sure that the conical tube containing the bacterial lysate is on ice during sonication.Centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C and 13,000 × g.Transfer soluble lysate to a new 5 or 15 mL conical tube.Equilibrate 1 mL of PierceTM glutathione magnetic agarose beads GST by adding 1 mL of wash/equilibration buffer.Vortex for 10 s, place on magnet, remove supernatant, and add 1 mL of wash/equilibration buffer.Add DTT and EDTA to soluble lysate (final 1 mM for each).",
    "Remove supernatant from beads and transfer the beads to soluble lysate.Incubate for 1–2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation.Using magnet, remove supernatant and add 1 mL of wash buffer. Save 20–50 μL of supernatant as “flowthrough” sample, to later use when running the SDS-page.Incubate at 4 °C with constant rotation.Remove wash buffer using magnet and repeat wash step two more times.Remove wash buffer and add 250 μL of GST-elution buffer.Incubate for 10 min at 4 °C with constant rotation.Collect eluate #1 [e#1] and repeat elution step two more times.To each 250 μL eluate, add 41 μL of 7× cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor previously resuspended in GST-elution buffer.Run SDS-page with flowthrough and eluates to assess purification efficiency (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4516/bioprotoc-12-18-4516-g001.jpgFigure 1. Coomassie-stained SDS page evaluating purification efficiency. Efficiency of GST protein purification was assessed using SDS-page followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. For flowthrough (FT), 20 μg of protein were loaded; for the elution fractions, 2 μg of protein were loaded. GST-ΔRH-MNase will have a size of ~60 kDa, while GST-MNase will have a size of ~40 kDa.After running SDS-page, transfer gel into Coomassie fixing solution for 30 min, and place in a rocker.Transfer fixed gel into Coomassie staining solution for 1 h and place in a rocker.Transfer stained gel into Coomassie destaining solution for 20 min and place in a rocker.Replace Coomassie destaining solution, and place in a rocker.Repeat steps 28 and 29 two more times (for a total of 1 h 20 min destaining). GST-MNase will have a molecular weight close to 40 kDa, and GST-ΔRH-MNase close to 60 kDa.Dialyze protein, add glycerol for storing at -20 °C, and quantify protein according to original MapR method (Yan and Sarma, 2020).",
    "Sample preparation If purifying tissue-specific nuclei from Drosophila, perform nuclei immuno-enrichment as follows: for this protocol, we performed tissue-specific nuclei immunoprecipitation from UAS-EGFP.KASH-Msp300 flies (available at the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, see Methods). These flies, when crossed with a Gal4 fly line, will express a GFP anchored to the outer nuclear membrane in a specific tissue. Then, magnetic beads and GFP antibody can be used to purify these nuclei. We have also described these steps (Jauregui-Lozano et al., 2021), and this approach is compatible with different chromatin profiling techniques.Prepare fresh bead washing buffer, homogenization/wash buffer, and dilution buffer and keep on ice.Incubate 40 µL of DynabeadsTM in 1 mL of bead washing buffer for 10 min at room temperature (RT) with constant rotation.Transfer tube to magnetic rack. Invert rack several times to ensure all beads are bound to the magnet. Remove supernatant with pipettor.Resuspend beads in 1 mL bead washing buffer with 4 µg of anti-GFP antibody.Incubate beads for 30 min at RT with constant rotation to couple with GFP antibody.Using magnet, remove supernatant.Wash beads with 1 mL bead washing buffer for 5 min at RT with constant rotation.Using magnet, remove supernatant.Resuspend beads in 0.1% NP-40 homogenization/wash buffer. Mix three parts dilution buffer with one part homogenization/wash buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% NP-40.Load Dounce homogenizer with 1 mL of homogenization/wash buffer. Keep homogenizer on ice.Transfer Drosophila samples to homogenizer.400 fly heads (flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C) can be used with 1 mL of homogenization/wash buffer to isolate nuclei from neuronal tissue in the adult head.Fresh samples such as larval tissue or whole embryos can also be used.Grind samples with 5 “loose” pestle strokes.Incubate samples on ice for 5 min.",
    "Grind samples with an additional 5 “loose” pestle strokes followed by 10 “tight” pestle strokes.Filter fly homogenate using a 40 µm cell strainer.Add 3 mL of dilution buffer to filtered 1 mL homogenate to a final concentration of 0.1% NP-40.Evenly split 4 mL of homogenate into four 1.5 mL tubes (1 mL per tube).Add 50 µL of bead/antibody solution to each tube.Incubate fly homogenate with bead/antibody solution for 30 min at RT with constant rotation to couple nuclei with the anti-GFP beads.Using magnet, remove supernatant.Combine bead-bound nuclei from all four tubes in 1 mL of 0.1% NP-40 homogenization/wash buffer.Incubate for 5 min at 4 °C with constant rotation.Using magnet, remove supernatant.Resuspend bead-bound nuclei in 1 mL of 0.1% NP-40 homogenization/wash buffer and transfer to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.Incubate for 5 min at 4 °C with constant rotation.Using magnet, remove supernatant.Wash bead-bound nuclei in 1 mL of 0.1% NP-40 homogenization/wash buffer for 5 min at 4 °C with constant rotation.Note: As previously described (Jauregui-Lozano et al., 2021), this method will yield bead-bound nuclei, which is suitable with MapR. Otherwise, purify nuclei using Concanavalin A-coated beads, as described in the original MapR method (Yan and Sarma, 2020).Modified MapR Wash bead-bound nuclei with 1 mL of dig-wash buffer.For every wash step, incubate bead-bound nuclei at 4 °C for 5 min with constant rotation.Using magnet, remove dig-wash buffer, and repeat wash step two more times.Resuspend bead-bound nuclei in 150 μL of dig-wash buffer.Add GST-ΔRH-MNase or GST-MNase to a final concentration of 1 μM.To calculate protein molarity based on protein concentration, use the formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220915/20220915000625_3580.jpg where,μg/mL is the concentration of protein obtained with traditional protein quantification reagents, such as Bradford Assay or QubitTM protein assay kits (Thermo Fisher).MW (kDa) is the molecular weight of the protein.",
    "GST-MNase has a MW of 44 kDa, and GST-dRH-MNase has a MW of 61.5 kDa.The Bioline website has an online calculator that performs this calculation: https://www.bioline.com/media/calculator/01_04.html[href=https://www.bioline.com/media/calculator/01_04.html].Incubate at 4 °C with constant rotation for 1 h.Wash bead-bound nuclei three times with 500 μL of dig-wash buffer.Wash bead-bound nuclei one time with low salt rinse buffer.Resuspend bead-bound nuclei in 200 μL of ice-cold calcium-containing activation buffer, and place on wet ice for 60 s.Using magnet, remove supernatant and immediately add 150 μL of EGTA-STOP buffer.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Using magnet, transfer supernatant to a new tube and extract DNA from the supernatant using ChIP DNA clean & concentrator. The supernatant contains the released R-loop-enriched DNA; make sure you purify DNA from supernatant.Quantify DNA using Nanodrop or QubitTM DNA reagent.Use 100 pg–10 ng of purified DNA to make sequencing-ready MapR libraries using Ovation® Ultralow V2 DNA-Seq library preparation kit."
