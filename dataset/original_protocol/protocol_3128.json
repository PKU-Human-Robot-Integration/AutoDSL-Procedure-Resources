    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nRecovery and Lysis of Organoids\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps describe the recovery of organoids from matrix domes and subsequent lysis in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride.\nRecover organoids from matrix domes.\nAspirate organoid culture media.\nAdd 2 mL of ice-cold Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) per 6-well.\nUse a P1000 micropipette to scrape and collect organoids into LoBind 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nIncubate on ice for 30–60 min, inverting halfway through to mix organoids, to allow matrix to dissolve.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min to pellet organoids.\nDiscard supernatant (including any matrix on top of the pellet).\nWash organoids with ice-cold PBS.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold PBS to each tube.\nGently rotate and invert tube to resuspend organoid pellet.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min to pellet organoids.\nDiscard supernatant (including any matrix on top of the pellet).\nRepeat steps a-d until no visible matrix remains.\nNote: Using ice-cold Cell Recovery Solution and PBS aids with the removal of organoids from extracellular matrix (of the BME domes) and also reduces peptide degradation.\nCritical: Avoid touching organoids while removing supernatant as they will readily stick to pipette tips. BSA should not be added above 0.001% to prevent sticking as this will interfere with the LC-MS analysis.\nCritical: Remaining matrix may interfere with peptide extraction and LC-MS. Organoids should be washed with ice-cold PBS until no visible matrix remains (normally 2–3 times).\nAdd 25 μL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride per organoid dome to resuspend pellet (typically 300–500 μL is used per confluent 6-well) and snap freeze on dry ice.\nPause Point: Samples can be frozen at −70°C until ready to continue with peptide extraction\nPeptide Extraction of Lysed Organoids\nTiming: 21 h",
    "This method describes peptide extraction of whole lysed organoid cultures.\nDefrost the samples on ice and precipitate with a 1:5 ratio of 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in water.\nIf necessary, transfer samples to a larger Eppendorf tube prior to precipitation.\nNote: Precipitation will result in the formation of three layers within the sample; organic, aqueous, and solid cell precipitate. Centrifugation and placing the sample on ice will clarify the layers, see step 5.\nCentrifuge at 3,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and transfer the aqueous phase (lower), without disturbing the precipitate, to a clean LoBind Eppendorf tube.\nEvaporate the supernatant in a rotary evaporator until dry (usually takes ~18 h; overnight evaporation).\nReconstitute in 250 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) and transfer onto an Oasis HLB Prime μElution solid phase extraction (SPE) plate (Waters) and gently apply positive pressure on an SPE manifold.\nWash all samples with the following reagents, ensuring the SPE plate reservoirs are clear before each step.\n200 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v).\n200 μL 5% methanol:1% acetic acid in water (v/v).\nElute the samples into a clean QuanRecovery plate with two 30 μL aliquots of 60% methanol:10% acetic acid in water (v/v).\nEvaporate the supernatant, under nitrogen at 40°C on a Biotage SPE Dry 96 system until dry.\nReconstitute into 75 μL 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 60°C.\nAdd 20 μL 100 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nIncubate for 30 min at 18°C–25°C, in the dark.\nDilute the samples with 25 μL 1% formic acid in water (v/v).",
    "Note: Reduction and alkylation (steps 11–14) breaks disulfide-bonded peptides so they can be identified in the bioinformatics analysis. These steps can be removed but this will reduce the number of positive peptide matches. If a targeted quantitation approach is being used, the SPE extract is to be diluted with 75 μL 0.1 % formic acid in water (v/v) after step 9 for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nPurification of Cell Populations by FACS\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis method describes the isolation of cell populations by FACS based on the presence of fluorescent reporters.\nRecover organoids from matrix domes.\nAspirate organoid culture media.\nAdd 2 mL of ice-cold Advanced DMEM/F12 (ADF) per 6-well.\nUse a P1000 micropipette to scrape and collect organoids into 15 mL centrifuge tube(s).\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min to pellet organoids.\nDiscard supernatant.\nDigest organoids to single cells.\nResuspend pellet in 5 mL of TrypLE Express per 6-well.\nIncubate in a water bath at 37⁰C for 20 min.\nMechanically triturate organoids 10–20 times each with P1000 and P200 micropipettes.\nTake a small drop (~20 μL) of the cell suspension onto a Petri dish and check under a microscope for the presence of single cells.\nRepeat steps b-d, checking digestion at 5–20 min intervals, until a largely single-cell suspension is obtained.\nNote: Digestion to single cells typically requires 30–60 min incubation with TrypLE at 37⁰C, depending on organoid size and morphology. To enhance digestion, organoids can be transferred to a 50 mL tube during step 17 (which prevents organoids settling to the bottom of the tube) but should be returned to 15 mL tubes for centrifugation. Some small clusters of up to ten cells are acceptable at this stage as they will be further broken up by mechanical trituration.\nWash organoids with FACS media.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min to pellet single cells.\nDiscard supernatant.\nMechanically triturate organoids 10–20 times each with P200 and P20 micropipettes.\nResuspend pellet in 5 mL of FACS media.\nRepeat steps a-d two more times, then pass cell suspension though a 50 μm cell strainer.\nRepeat steps 18a–c and resuspend in FACS media supplemented with live cell dyes (for example, 5 μM DRAQ5 and/or 2 μg/mL DAPI).\nTransfer single-cell suspension to 5 mL round bottomed polypropylene FACS tubes.\nSort cell populations of interest directly into 350 μL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in LoBind 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: Where possible we recommend collecting >10,000 cells per population for peptidomic analysis, although we have previously measured high-abundance peptides from as few as 100 cells from fresh tissue. Follow manufacturer instructions regarding use of cell sorters. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example FACS sort layout.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/290-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Single cells were selected based on their side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) (top row) and live single cells were further isolated from dead cells and debris based on DAPI and DRAQ5 fluorescence as indicated, before Venus-fluorescence positive (+ve) cells were distinguished from non-fluorescent negative (-ve) cells (bottom row).\nVortex briefly and then immediately snap freeze cells on dry ice after sorting.",
    "Pause Point: Samples can be frozen at −70°C until ready to continue with peptide extraction\nNote: As there is 10% FBS present in the FACS media, some bovine derived peptides will be carried through to LC-MS analysis. The impact on peptidomics is minimal, however for proteomic analysis the bovine peptides will generate interferences to the database search. If interested in proteomics analysis, use 0.1% BSA or a lower concentration of FBS in FACS media.\nExtraction of FAC-Sorted Cells\nTiming: 21 h\nThaw sorted cell samples on ice and then re-freeze on dry ice (or in a −70°C freezer) followed by defrosting on ice.\nAdd 900 μL of 80% ACN in water to each sample and vortex mix.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and transfer the aqueous phase (lower) to a clean LoBind Eppendorf.\nEvaporate the supernatant in a rotary evaporator until dry (usually takes ~18 h; overnight evaporation).\nReconstitute in 500 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v).\nTransfer samples onto an Oasis HLB Prime μElution solid phase extraction (SPE) plate (Waters) and gently apply positive pressure on an SPE manifold.\nWash all samples with the following reagents, ensuring the SPE plate reservoirs are clear before each step.\n200 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v).\n200 μL 5% methanol:1% acetic acid in water (v/v).\nElute the samples into a clean Quanrecovery plate with two 30 μL aliquots of 60% methanol:10% acetic acid in water (v/v).\nEvaporate the supernatant under nitrogen at 40°C on a Biotage SPE Dry 96 system until dry.\nReconstitute into 75 μL of 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 60°C.\nAdd 20 μL 100 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nIncubate for 30 min at 18°C–25°C, in the dark.",
    "Dilute the samples with 25 μL 1% formic acid in water (v/v).\nGeneration of 2D Organoid Cultures\nTiming: 20 h\nThis method describes the preparation of 2D organoid cultures for secretion experiments. The number of organoids required will depend on expression levels of the peptides of interest and differentiation conditions. To assess gut hormone secretion from intestinal organoid cultures (as described in Goldspink et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), we recommend that one confluent well of a 6-well plate is used to seed six wells of a 24-well plate.\nPre-coat plates with Matrigel.\nThaw Matrigel aliquot on ice.\nPrepare an appropriate volume of 2% v/v Matrigel in ice-cold ADF.\nAdd 300 μL of 2% Matrigel to the required number of wells of a 24-well plate.\nIncubate Matrigel-coated places at 37°C for approximately 1 h.\nMeanwhile, recover organoids from matrix domes.\nAspirate organoid culture media.\nAdd 2 mL of ice-cold Advanced DMEM/F12 (ADF) per 6-well.\nUse a P1000 micropipette to scrape and collect organoids into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet organoids then discard supernatant.\nResuspend organoid pellet in 4 mL of TrypLE Express per 6-well.\nIncubate in a water bath for 8–12 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min to pellet organoids then discard supernatant.\nTriturate 10–20 times with a P200 micropipette to mechanically disrupt the organoid pellet.\nNote: For optimal attachment, aim for small clusters of 10–20 cells (this can be visualized after plating or by directly observing cells in a 15 mL tube at any point under a light microscope).\nResuspend pellet in organoid culture media + 10 μM Y-27632 (250 μL/24-well, pre-warmed to 37°C) to obtain a cell suspension.\nAspirate Matrigel solution from pre-coated plate.",
    "Immediately add pre-warmed organoid culture media + 10 μM Y-27632 (250 μL/24-well) to each well.\nPlate 250 μL of the cell suspension per well.\nNote: To ensure consistency between wells, mix the cell suspension by pipetting regularly during plating to ensure the suspension remains homogenous. After plating, gently shake plates (left to right and back to front) to ensure cells do not clump in the center of the well.\nIncubate overnight (18–24 h) in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) to allow cell adhesion before stimulating secretion.\nCollection of 2D Secretion Supernatants\nTiming: 2 h\nThis method describes the collection of supernatants from 2D organoid cultures stimulated under different conditions. This is performed in 24-well plates and it may be necessary to combine supernatants collected from multiple wells, depending on the peptides of interest and LC-MS sensitivity. To measure ileal gut hormone secretion (as described in Goldspink et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), we combine supernatants from three wells of a 24-well plate. Strong stimulants – such as forskolin/IBMX (each 10 μM) which elevate intracellular cAMP levels – can be used to assess secretion of peptides from a range of cell types. Alternatively, drugs which target specific receptors or molecular pathways can be tested to determine whether these stimulate or inhibit secretion of peptides of interest.\nFollowing overnight incubation, observe cultures under a light microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nNote: See Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] and Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nAdd 0.001% fatty acid-free BSA and, if required, glucose (normally 10 mM) to an appropriate volume of saline buffer and pre-warm to 37°C (this solution is termed secretion buffer).\nWash cultures with pre-warmed secretion buffer.\nAspirate overnight culture media.\nAdd approximately 300 μL of warm secretion buffer to each well to wash cultures.\nAspirate secretion buffer.",
    "Repeat steps b-c twice more then add a further 300 μL of warm secretion buffer to each well and incubate at 37°C for 30 min (meanwhile proceed to step 47).\nNote: These wash steps should not be too gentle as they aim to remove unattached cells or debris and wash off all culture media (which may interfere with LC-MS). The 30 min pre-incubation step allows acclimatization of cells to the low-nutrient secretion buffer.\nPrepare stimulant solutions in secretion buffer (200 μL is required per well of a 24-well plate, and should be made up with 10% excess volume) and keep at 37°C.\nAfter the 30 min pre-incubation, remove all the secretion buffer from wells (using a P1000 micropipette with the plate tilted to a 45° angle) and add 200 μL of stimulant solution to each well.\nNote: To avoid cells drying out, buffer should only be removed from 3–4 wells at a time\nIncubate with stimulants at 37°C for 1 h.\nMeanwhile label and pre-chill (on ice) two LoBind 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes per condition.\nCollect supernatants into pre-chilled LoBind 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: Supernatants from multiple wells can be combined at this step, if required for peptide detection by LC-MS. Steps 50–52 should be performed on ice using pre-chilled tubes to minimize peptide degradation\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any debris or detached cells.\nTransfer 180 μL (or greater volume if multiple wells were combined in step 50) of each supernatant to fresh LoBind tubes, taking care to avoid touching any pellet which forms.\nCritical: As intracellular levels of secreted peptides are normally higher than in supernatants, any detached cells will interfere with quantification\nImmediately snap freeze on dry ice.",
    "Pause Point: Samples can be frozen at −70°C until continuing with peptide extraction\nExtraction of Secretion Samples\nTiming: 1 h\nThis method describes the extraction of peptides from organoid secretion supernatants.\nThaw secretion samples, if frozen, on ice.\nTo each sample, add 50 μL of 1% formic acid in water (v/v) and gently mix.\nCritical: Ensure steps 54 and 55 are performed on wet ice\nNote: If performing targeted quantitation of peptides prepare an internal standard solution in 1% formic acid in water (v/v) and add 50 μL instead of blank solvent\nTransfer samples onto an Oasis HLB Prime μElution solid phase extraction (SPE) plate (Waters) and gently apply positive pressure on an SPE manifold.\nWash all samples with the following reagents, ensuring the SPE plate wells are clear before each step:\n200 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v)\n200 μL 5% methanol:1% acetic acid in water (v/v)\nElute the samples into a clean Quanrecovery plate with two 30 μL aliquots of 60% methanol:10% acetic acid in water (v/v).\nDilute the samples with 75 μL 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v).\nAnalysis of Peptides by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry\nTiming: 130 min per sample\nThis step describes sample data acquisition of extracted samples by LC-MS analysis. Extracts are analyzed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Ultimate 3000 nano LC system coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer according to the analytical parameters stated previously in LC-MS system set up.\nPrior to injection onto the liquid chromatography (LC) system, centrifuge samples at 3,500 × g for 10 min.\nInject samples onto LC-MS system for analysis; recommended volumes of 30 μL for secretion supernatants and lysed organoids, and 40 μL for sorted cells.\nNote: See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] if chromatography is not as expected",
    "Quantification of Peptides in Raw LC-MS Data Files Using Qual Browser and Quan Browser Software\nTiming: up to 4 h depending on the number of LC-MS data files being searched\nUsing PEAKS software (v8.5), open a representative LC-MS file in Qual Browser that will contain peptides of interest.\nExtract the m/z ion specific for the peptide (as specified in the PEAKS software viewer) using the ranges function on the chromatogram pane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/290-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
