    "This protocol follows the approved animal care guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All strains were backcrossed five generations to the C57BL/6J strain.\n1. Embryo isolation and whole mount staining\nBreed 6-week-old females and monitor for the presence of vaginal plug.\nEuthanize the pregnant dam by CO2 inhalation in a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation according to the AVMA guidelines18. Make a Y-incision to the peritoneal cavity using dissecting scissors and forceps. Excise the uterus containing the E9.5 embryos as per approved institutional guidelines.\nDissect the embryos in complete growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with nonessential amino-acids, Na-pyruvate, L-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum). Use forceps to remove the yolk sac, placenta, and surrounding membranes.\n\tNOTE: When required, save each yolk sac for embryo genotyping.\nRinse the isolated embryos in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to remove any residual amniotic tissue and blood.\nPrepare the fixative. Add paraformaldehyde (PFA) to HBSS for a final working concentration of 4% PFA.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is a toxic chemical, so inhalation or direct skin exposure must be avoided. Preparation of the fixative solution is performed under a fume hood with the proper personal protective equipment of gloves and a lab coat.\nAdd 1 mL of fixative to each well of a 24-well plate and place each embryo in an individual well. Incubate the embryos in fixative for 45 min with gentle agitation on a rocker.\n\tNOTE: Critical: All washes and incubations must be done with gentle agitation (maximum 20 RPM) on a rocker or circular shaker, as abrupt handling or movement of the embryos will destroy the fixed cytonemes. Use a pipette to gently remove all solutions.",
    "Remove the fixative and wash the embryos 3 x 30 min in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) with Ca2+ and Mg2+ with added 0.1% Triton.\nAfter washing, incubate the embryos in blocking solution (PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Triton, and 5% goat serum) with gentle agitation. Block 2 x 1 h. After the second blocking incubation, perform one quick rinse of the embryos using fresh blocking solution.\nDuring the second blocking step, prepare the primary antibody solution11. Dilute the antibodies to the optimized concentration in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum.\n\tNOTE: For enhanced visualization of membrane GFP, chicken anti-GFP (1:250) can be used.\nRemove the blocking solution and add 1 mL of primary antibody solution to each well. Incubate at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 3 days.\nFollowing the primary antibody incubation, wash the embryos 5 x 1 h at 20 RPM on a rocker in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum.\nPrepare the secondary antibody solution using F(ab')2 fragment secondaries at a 1:1,000 dilution in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum.\n\tNOTE: Use of F(ab')2 fragments greatly enhances antibody penetration into sample.\nAdd 1 mL of secondary antibody solution to each well. Incubate with gentle rocking at 4 °C in the dark for 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Important: From this point on, minimize embryo exposure to direct light. Optional: To prevent bacterial growth, add 0.2% sodium azide to the secondary antibody solution.",
    "Remove the secondary antibody solution and wash the embryos 3 x 30 min in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum. If not performing actin staining with phalloidin or other actin dyes, after the first wash, add 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum and incubate for 1 h, followed by 3 x 30 min washes as described above.\n\t​NOTE: At this point, the embryos can be stored overnight at 4 °C in PBS or HBSS in the dark until the embedding step the following day. However, it is recommended that embryos are embedded and sectioned immediately.\n2. Embryo embedding, sectioning, and mounting\nPrepare a 4% w/v Low Melting Point (LMP) agarose solution dissolved in HBSS or PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ to a final volume of ~3 mL per embryo. Add the appropriate weight of LMP agarose to HBSS or PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and microwave until the LMP agarose is dissolved.\n\tNOTE: Once the LMP agarose is dissolved, store the solution in a bead bath, incubator, or water bath set to 55 °C to prevent the LMP agarose solution from solidifying.\nUse a 12-well plate as the embedding mold for embryos. Place the 12-well plate in the 55 °C bead bath. Add 2.5-3 mL of 4% LMP agarose to each well that will hold an embryo.\n\tNOTE: Although other molds may be used, 12-well plate volumes are optimal for preparing the agarose block at later stages for sectioning.\nUsing a perforated spoon, transfer the embryos into individual wells containing 4% LMP agarose solution (Figure 1A).",
    "Transfer the 12-well plate from the bead bath to a benchtop. Use pipette tips to gently embed and orient the embryo so it is centered within the solution. Once the embryos are oriented, place the plate at -20 °C for 10 min to allow quick solidification of the block.\n\t\tCRITICAL: Ensure the embryo is positioned in the center of the block. Embryos that sink to the bottom or are too close to the edge of the mold will likely be dislodged from the agarose block while sectioning.\nRemove the entire agarose block from the well using a scalpel and cut a rectangular block around the embryo leaving ~0.3 cm of block on each side. Allow extra length along the caudal end of the embryo. When mounted on the vibratome, orient the embryo in an upright position in the upper section of the block (Figure 1B).\nApply a strip of tape to the specimen holder of the vibratome and superglue the agarose block to the tape, oriented so the blade will generate axial sections of the embryo in an anterior (cranial) to posterior sequence.\nFill the vibratome chamber with cold HBSS to ensure the sample is fully immersed, and then surround the chamber with ice.\nSet the vibratome speed to 0.2 mm/s and frequency between 5 and 7 (50-70 Hz) with cut thickness set to 100 µm. Perform serial axial sectioning of the embryo.\n\tNOTE: Use a slow speed for sectioning. If the cut speed is increased above 0.25 mm/s, sectioning may tear the embryo or dislodge the embryo from the block.\n\t\nDuring the sectioning series, use forceps to gently transfer individual sections to a separate 60 mm dish filled with HBSS. Use forceps to grab the block, not the tissue, to avoid tissue damage and destruction of cytonemes.",
    "NOTE: Tissue sections should remain within the agarose block. If the tissue falls out of the block into the vibratome chamber, gently transfer by lifting the section out. Do not grab or pinch the tissue. CRITICAL: Any folding of tissue sections or abrupt handling will destroy fixed cytonemes in the tissue sections.\nIf not performing F-actin staining, proceed to step 2.10.\n\t\nTo perform F-actin staining, remove HBSS and incubate sections for 40 min with Actin-Red and DAPI solution diluted in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% goat serum at room temperature.\nWash sections 3 x 20 min in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 0.1% Tween-20.\nUsing a hydrophobic marker pen, draw a hydrophobic barrier around the edges of a charged microscope slide and add a small volume of HBSS to fill the area.\nUse forceps or a perforated spoon to transfer sections to the slide.\n\tNOTE: Any tissue sections that are not encased in agarose can be transferred via a transfer pipette.\nRemove excess agarose block using forceps.\nOnce all sections have been transferred to the slide, remove excess liquid via pipetting and the corner of an absorbent towelette, and then add several drops of mounting medium to the slide. Use enough mounting medium to cover the entire coverslip area when cured. Mount the coverslip by gently placing it on the slide.\n\t​NOTE: Avoid applying pressure or disturbing coverslip until the mounting medium has cured.\n3. Imaging\nPerform imaging of tissue sections on any confocal or higher resolution microscope11. Analyze a minimum of three embryos per genotype.\n\tNOTE: Images of tissue sections were acquired using a TCS SP8 STED 3x confocal microscope, followed by LIGHTNING deconvolution."
