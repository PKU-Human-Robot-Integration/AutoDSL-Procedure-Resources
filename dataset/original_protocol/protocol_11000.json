  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals approved by the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid Ethics Committee (CEI 103-1958-A337) and La Comunidad de Madrid (PROEX 294/19) and in accordance with the guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Animals as stated in The International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). The protocol followed the ethical principles for biomedical research with written informed consent. Prior ethical approval was obtained for the use of fresh tissue for the establishment of the tumor organoid cultures. The samples were provided by the BioBank Hospital Ramón y Cajal-IRYCIS (National Registry of Biobanks B.0000678), integrated into the Biobanks and Biomodels Platform of the ISCIII (PT20/00045), and processed following standard operating procedures with the appropriate ethical approval. The tumors were subcutaneously implanted, as previously described22, into immunocompromised 6 week old female NU-Foxn1nu nude mice (see Table of Materials) and passaged in vivo to establish PDAC PDXs.\n1. Experimental preparation\nHandle human samples in a class II biosafety cabinet.\nWear a lab coat, protective gloves, and glasses throughout the procedure to avoid infection by tissue-borne pathogens.\n\t​NOTE: A minimum of 3 h is required to process the fresh tissue sample and plate the organoids and fibroblasts.\nProcess the fresh tissue samples22 within a maximum of 24 h from harvesting, and store at 4 °C in tissue culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) until processing.\nKeep all the samples and reagents on the ice during the entire procedure, and ensure to pre-set a refrigerated centrifuge to 4 °C and use it at a low speed to avoid damaging the cell preparation.",
    "Store P1,000 and P200 pipette tips in a −20 °C freezer to use during the protocol.\nAliquot the basement membrane matrix (see Table of Materials) prior to use. For this protocol, 250 mL aliquots are recommended.\n2. Processing fresh primary tumor tissue to establish tumor organoids and primary fibroblasts\nNOTE: A minimum of 3 h is required to process the fresh tissue sample (either primary human resectable tumors or PDXs) and to plate the tumor organoids and fibroblasts. An outline of the organoid preparation process is shown in Figure 1, from tissue digestion to the plating of the tumor organoids. Before starting the protocol, take out an aliquot of the basement membrane matrix from the −20 °C freezer, and leave it on ice for approximately 30-60 min before use.\nPut a 6-well culture plate in a 37 °C cell culture incubator 3 h before plating the organoids.\nMeasure, photograph, and wash the tissue (step 1.3) with 3 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (F12), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 15 mM Hepes, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 125 ng/mL Amphotericin B, 0.1 mg/mL Normocin) (see Table of Materials) by pipetting up and down and then wash with 3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by pipetting up and down.",
    "Remove the media by aspiration from the tissue culture plate and cut the tissue into 1 mm3 pieces in a sterile tissue culture plate using two sterile blades and 2 mL of Digestion Medium (Advanced DMEM-F12 + 10 mg Collagenase IV/mL, 0.000625% Trypsin-EDTA, and 10 µg/mL DNase). Collect the tissue in a 50 mL tube with 5 mL total of Digestion Media and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C with mechanical digestion with commercially available equipment (see Table of Materials) or with periodic mixing of the sample, by pipetting the sample up and down.\nAdd 5 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12 to inactivate the trypsin, and filter the sample through a 70 µm pore strainer to remove large debris.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS to the top of the filter, and collect the debris and tissue remnants to establish cultures of fibroblasts (see step 5).\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 200-300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and aspirate the supernatant, leaving only the cell pellet. Add 5 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12, and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.\nResuspend the pellet in 4 mL of ammonium-chloride potassium (ACK, see Table of Materials) lysis buffer. Pass the mixture to a 15 mL tube, and incubate at room temperature for 2 min to lyse the red blood cells.\n\tNOTE: This red blood cell lysis step can be removed when there is no visible evidence of contamination.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and aspirate the supernatant. Add 5 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12, and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.",
    "Add 1 mL of commercially available cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) supplemented with DNase (1 µg/mL) to the cell pellet, and incubate for 2-3 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant. Add 5 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12, and resuspend the cell pellet.\nPipette up and down 30 times with a P1,000 pipette to dissociate the cells, centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g, and remove the supernatant.\nTake P1,000 and P200 pipette tips from the −20 °C freezer, and resuspend the cell pellet in the membrane matrix using a P1,000 pipette and cold tips (50 µL per drop, taking into account the pellet volume, six to seven domes per well). Take out the previously heated plate from the incubator. Set a P200 pipette to 48 µL, and use cold tips to create domes of the basement membrane matrix in the pre-heated 6-well plate.\nPut the plate with the basement membrane matrix-cell domes into the 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min to solidify the basement membrane matrix.\nAdd 2-2.5 mL of Advanced DMEM-F12, supplemented with 20 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 ng/mL human placenta growth factor (PlGF), 10 ng/mL recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 769 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and 10.5 µM ROCK Inhibitor (Advanced DMEM-F12 + growth factors) (see Table of Materials).\n3. Monitoring the organoids\nMonitor the tumor organoid culture visually for the first 7 days and then three times per week thereafter.",
    "Change the medium twice per week with Advanced DMEM-F12 containing 20 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 ng/mL human placenta growth factor (PlGF), 10 ng/mL recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 769 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and 10.5 µM ROCK inhibitor (Advanced DMEM-F12 + growth factors).\nCapture images of the tumor organoid culture periodically on day 1, day 3, day 7, day 10, and day 15 after processing the sample and plating the culture in the matrix to observe the growth and viability.\n4. Passage and cryostorage of the organoids\nRemove the culture medium from the 6-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL of an appropriate cell recovery reagent (see Table of Materials) to disassociate the basement membrane matrix and obtain a cell suspension, and recover the supernatant in a 15 mL tube. If the matrix does not dissociate immediately, incubate the sample at 4 °C for 15-20 min until completely dissolved.\nAdd 1 mL of the same cell recovery reagent used in step 4.2 to the well of the plate to recover additional dissociated cells, and add the supernatant to the same 15 mL tube as in step 4.2.\nAdd 5 mL of cold Advanced DMEM-F12, and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant, and dry the pellet carefully by removing any remaining liquid with a 5 mL pipette; avoid moving the tube as much as possible. Resuspend the cell pellet in twice the original volume of basement membrane matrix in order to obtain a passage of 1:2.\nFor the cryostorage of the organoid cultures, resuspend the pellet obtained in step 4.5 in 1 mL of freezing medium (10% DMSO, 20% FBS, 50% DMEM-F12, 10.5 µM ROCK inhibitor), and store at −80 °C.",
    "​NOTE: The volume of basement membrane matrix can be adjusted to perform different passages, such as 1:1 (using the same volume of basement membrane matrix as the original) or 1:3 (adding three times the original volume of basement membrane matrix).\n5. Establishment of fibroblasts\nAfter recovering the debris and tissue remnants in 2 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS, add this to a 6-well plate, and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nRemove the tissue remnants from the fibroblast cultures from step 2.5 by the aspiration of the medium 2 days or 3 days after plating, and replace with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS.\nMonitor the fibroblast culture visually three times per week, and change the culture medium at least twice per week using DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nSubscription Required.
