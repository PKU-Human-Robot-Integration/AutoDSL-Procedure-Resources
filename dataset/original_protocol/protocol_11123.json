    "1. Cell preparation\nPerform all the experiments under sterile conditions in Class II laminar flow microbiological safety cabinet (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nTurn on the hood and allow for the stabilization of the airflow.\nThoroughly spray the interior hood surface with 70% ethanol to eliminate any possible contamination from previous users.\nPrepare 5% of a disinfectant solution in a 500 mL glass beaker. Discard any cell supernatant or cell debris inside the solution.\nThoroughly clean all the micropipettes and tip boxes with 70% ethanol.\nPrepare fresh cell culture media by supplementing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) high glucose media with 10% heat deactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 unit/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin), and 2 mM L-glutamine. For the LX2 hepatic stellate cell line, reduce the concentration of the FBS supplement to 2%.\nWarm culture media before initiating the experiment.\nTake Huh7 and Hep3B HCC tumor cell lines and COS7 and LX2 fibroblast cell lines from their storage rack in liquid nitrogen. Rapidly defrost cryopreserved cells.\nDilute thawed cells with 2 mL of fresh culture media. Centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh warm culture media.\nSeed cells in T75 cell culture flask. Incubate the cells in a cell culture incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in 95% humidified conditions until cells reach 60%-70% confluency.\n2. Cell collection\nAspirate culture media and wash cells three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS).\nAdd 2 mL of pre-warmed 1x Trypsin to detach adherent cells from the bottom of the T75 flasks. Incubate at 37 °C in an incubator for 4 min.",
    "Inactivate trypsin by adding 4 mL of complete culture media. Collect the cell suspension and centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 4 mL fresh culture media.\n3. Cell counting\nGently vortex the cell suspension to ensure homogenous distribution of cells in the centrifuge tube.\nUsing a 10 µL pipette, mix 10 µL of cell suspension with 10 µL of Trypan blue. Gently pipette the mixture up and down four times to ensure complete staining of the outer cell surface with the dye.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer.\n\t\nFirst, place a coverslip over the hemocytometer counting area before loading the stained cell suspension.\nPlace the pipette tip containing the cell suspension into the V groove of the hemocytometer. Gently expel the tip content into the counting slide.\nLeave the slurry to settle for a couple of minutes before fixing it on the microscope stage for cell counting.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid double-counting, only count the cells on the two sides of the large square.\nCount in cells overlapping the top or the right ruling and avoid those overlapping the bottom or the left ruling.\nCalculate the total number of cells.\n\tNOTE: Cell number per ml = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62868/62868eq01.jpg\n4. Collection of fibroblast conditioned media (CM)\nAspirate culture media and wash the LX2 cells three times with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of pre-warmed 1x Trypsin to detach adherent cells from the bottom of the T75 flasks. Incubate the flask at 37 °C in an incubator for 4 min.\nInactivate trypsin by adding 4 mL of complete culture media. Collect the cell suspension and centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature. Count the cells as per step 3.",
    "Seed 1 x 106 LX2 cells in 10 cm3 dishes for 48 h at 37 °C.\nCollect the fibroblast CM after 48 h. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature to pellet any floating cells. Sterile filter the CM using a 0.22 µm filter fixed on the bottom of 20 mL syringes.\nCollect the supernatant CM. Aliquot the CM into 2 mL tubes and store at -80 °C for further applications.\n\t​NOTE: The solution can be stored for 6 months at -80 °C.\n5. Validating cell densities for perfect spheroids\nAspirate culture media and wash the HCC cell lines three times with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of pre-warmed 1x Trypsin to detach adherent cells from the bottom of the T75 flasks. Incubate at 37 °C in an incubator for 4 min.\nInactivate trypsin by adding 4 mL of complete culture media. Collect the cell suspension and centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature.\nCount the cells as per step 3.\nPipette different densities from the tumor cell lines (12000, 6000, 3000, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, and 125 cells) in 20 µL of media on the interior surface of a 10 cm3 lid of a Petri dish.\nAdd 10 mL of sterile PBS to the bottom of the dish to provide humid conditions for the process of spheroid formation.\nInvert the lid of the 10 cm3 dish to allow the media, including the cell suspension, to hang over a humid environment. Leave the hanging droplets for 3 days.\nTake images of the spheroids at 50x magnification using an inverted microscope 3 days after hanging the original droplets.\n6. Heterotypic tumor/stromal spheroids",
    "Suspend 1500 Huh7 HCC cells with 1500 COS7 mammalian fibroblast cells (1:1 ratio) in hanging droplets to form spheres. Add 10 mL of sterile PBS to the bottom of the dish to provide humid conditions for the spheroids.\nInvert the lid of the 10 cm3 dish to allow the media, including the cell suspension, to hang over a humid environment. Leave the hanging droplets for 3 days.\nTake images of the spheroids using an inverted microscope from day 3 until day 10 of culture.\n\t\nPut the 10 cm3 dish on the microscope stage. Adjust the magnification of the microscope at 50x for all spheroids.\nOpen the microscope software on the attached computer and adjust its focus to have a clear image of every spheroid. Use the Capture Tool on the microscope software to save the acquired pictures.\n7. Homotypic Hep3B spheroids in LX2 CM\nSuspend 3000 Hep3B HCC cells in the hanging droplets to form spheres. Add 10 mL of sterile PBS to the bottom of the dish to provide humid conditions for the spheroids.\nInvert the lid of the 10 cm3 dish to allow the media, including the cell suspension, to hang over a humid environment. Leave the hanging droplets for 3 days.\nTransfer Hep3B spheroids into 20 µL of fresh CM from LX2 cells in hanging droplets.\n\tNOTE: Use sterile autoclaved unfiltered 200 µL pipette tips in the process of spheroid transfer to avoid any disruption or injury to the formed spheroids. This is also to eliminate any residual cells that remain unattached to the main single spheroid.\n\t\nUse an autoclaved 20 µL pipette for the transfer process. Adjust the pipette volume to 2 µL. Attach the pipette tip to the pipette.",
    "Invert the lid of the 10 cm3 dish on which the spheroids were formed. Fix the lid on the stage of a light microscope. Adjust the fine focus of the microscope to make each spheroid visible.\nCarefully empty the air from the micropipette by pressing the plunger button. Insert the pipette tip in the droplet, including the spheroid, to be transferred. Get very close to the spheroid without touching it with the tip.\nGently release the pressure on the plunger button to allow the suction of the spheroid into the micropipette tip in 2 µL media.\nTransfer the spheroid into a new droplet hanging on a new 10 cm3 dish, having new media/conditioned media/treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that all the spheroids are successfully transferred to the new 10 cm3 dish using the light microscope.\nTake images of the spheroids at 50x magnification using an inverted microscope from the day of transfer (day 3) until day 7 of culture in LX2 CM.\n8. Calculation of spheroid volume\nAssign a unique numeric identifier for each spheroid so that images from matched spheroids can be captured daily.\nAnalyze images of the growing spheroids using an image analysis software package.\n\t\nOpen each spheroid image within the software package. Using the Freehand selection tool and outline each spheroid. From the Analysis dropdown button, select Set Measurement, and then Area. Press OK.\nManually draw a circle around each spheroid. Once the sphere is circled, press Ctrl + M to allow the program to calculate the spheroid area in Pixels. Convert the area of the spheroid into a volume.\n\t\tNOTE: Volume of spheroidmm3 =0.09403 × imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62868/62868eq02.jpg\nCalculate the change in spheroid volume relative to its volume on the first day of image capture.",
    "NOTE: This is to normalize the spheroid volume to the starting volume and improve accuracy given the natural variation in the starting size."
