    "All blood-drawing procedures should be done by licensed and certified professionals. Use of human subjects for research involves approval from the Institutional Review Board or other appropriate authority. Special precautions regarding informed consent and protecting participant identification need to be followed. All experiments listed in this protocol involve handling of human blood and/or blood products and appropriate personal protective equipment need to be worn at all times. The waste should be considered as biohazard and disposed of according to regulations.\n1. Venipuncture\nIdentify the patient/ participant and confirm with existing records. Explain the study in detail and get an informed consent.\nHave a tray set up for individual patient with tubes marked on a flat stable surface.\nExplain the procedure and make the patient seat comfortably with the arm supported. Inform the patient that he or she will feel a small pinch and should remain still throughout the procedure.\nAttach the needle to the adapter.\nWash hands and wear gloves.\nPrepare the antecubital fossa for venipuncture by cleaning with 70% isopropyl alcohol in concentric circles from center outward. Allow the site to air-dry for 30 sec.\nIdentify the appropriate vein by palpation.\nApply the tourniquet 3-4 in above the puncture site making sure that it is not too tight (while still feeling the radial pulse).\nPerform venipuncture by inserting the bevel of the needle 15-30 degrees to the skin in one smooth motion. Push the blood collection tube through the needle and collect 9 ml of whole blood.\nRemove the tourniquet. Remove the tube from the needle.\nWithdraw the needle and apply the gauze square at the puncture site prior to needle removal. Dispose the needle in an appropriate biohazard container.\nAsk patient to maintain pressure at the puncture site.\nLabel the tubes",
    "Check the puncture site to be sure bleeding has stopped.\nApply adhesive bandage or tape over the gauze square, ask if the patient is feeling alright (no pain, swelling or light headedness)\nThank the patient/participant prior to discharge.\n2. L-PRF Preparation\nImmediately after venous blood collection in the red-topped dry glass tube, place it in the Centrifuge.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 12 min at RT after placing an appropriate counter balance.\nRemove the tube at the end of the cycle. Notice the three layers: platelet-poor plasma (PPP), platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) and RBC base (Figure 1).\nAspirate the PPP using a pipette. Using tweezers gently pull the L-PRF out and place it in a sterile, perforated metal mesh.\nUsing surgical scalpel, scrape the bulk of RBC layer carefully leaving the buffy coat intact.\nGently compress the L-PRF clot (using the sterile metal plate, approximate weight 225 g) for 30 sec. Platelet poor plasma will be squeezed out.\nRemove the plate and gently lift the L-PRF membrane. The L-PRF membrane is ready for use in experiments12.\n3. Uniaxial Tensile Testing\nPlace L-PRF membranes (n=6) on a filter paper for ease of handling and punch into “dog bones” using custom-made metal dies (2.75 mm wide at their narrowest point with a gauge length of 7.5 mm).\nMeasure the thickness of each sample at three spots and take the average.\nCarefully engage the L-PRF membrane in the center of the jaw grips of the uniaxial testing system.\nCarefully tear the filer paper support to expose the L-PRF membrane.\nProgram the instrument so that the movable head is operating at a constant rate (10.0 mm/min) and start the experiment when the L-PRF is still wet.",
    "Record the elastic modulus, energy to break, and strain at break from the software accompanying the uniaxial testing system. These values are calculated automatically and no user defined input is required. Please see Figure 3.\n4. Suture Retention Strength\nPlace L-PRF membranes (n=3) on a filter paper for ease of handling and cut into rectangular samples measuring (10 mm x 25 mm) using a surgical scalpel.\nMeasure the thickness of each sample (average of 3).\nMake a pinhole in the center of the sample using the stainless steel orthodontic ligature wire (220 µm in diameter).\nPass the ligature wire through the pinhole to form a loop and fix it to the tensile testing machine. Place the edge of the L-PRF membrane to the lower jaw grip13.\nProgram the instrument so that the movable head is operating at a constant rate (10 mm/min) and start the experiment.\nRecord the elastic modulus, energy to break, and strain at break from the software accompanying the uniaxial testing system. These values are calculated automatically and no user defined input is required. Please see Figure 3.\n5. Morphological Examination\nPrepare the L-PRF samples for SEM examination using a 10 mm dermal biopsy punch and place them in a 24-well plate.\nWash the samples with PBS and fix with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (in PBS) for 20 min.\nDehydrate the specimens by immersion in sequentially increasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%) for 5 min each.\nTreat with 0.5 ml of 100% HMDS (Hexamethyldisilazane) for 5 min. Aerate O/N to remove excess HMDS14.\nMount samples on stubs using a double-sided tape, sputter-coat platinum for 70 sec and examine in a scanning electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV (or appropriate setting).\n6. Genipin Crosslinking of L-PRF, Trypsin Susceptibility and Ninhydrin Assay",
    "To prepare genipin cross-linked L-PRF, rinse membranes with PBS and soak in 4 ml of 1% genipin solution (in 70% ethanol) for 48 hr. Rinse with PBS prior to experiments to remove excess genipin15, 16.\nAssess the stability of genipin crosslinking of L-PRF by its resistance to degradation by trypsin. Place L-PRF membrane (n=3) and genipin crosslinked L-PRF in 500 µl of 0.01% trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days with a daily change of trypsin.\n\t\nWeigh samples at day 1 prior to enzyme exposure and at day 3. The difference in start and end weight represents enzymatic degradation17.\nQuantify the amount of cross-linking in genipin treated L-PRF (G-PRF) by ninhydrin assay. First prepare the standard curve using glycine (1 mM-0.031 mM) curve to establish the relationship between free amino acid concentration (FAA) and absorbance.\n\t\nHeat PRF samples with 1 ml of 2% (w/v) ninhydrin for 15 min at 100 °C.\nAllow the solution to cool to RT and add 1.5 ml of 50% ethanol.\nAnalyze the absorbance at 570 nm using a suitable spectrophotometer.\nDetermine cross-linking percentage using the formula below15\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53221/53221eq1.jpg\n7. MTS Cell Proliferation Assay\nGrow MC3T3 (mouse calvarial preosteoblasts) in Minimum Essential Medium –alpha modification (αMEM) in T-75 flasks until an 80% confluent monolayer is obtained.\nPrepare fresh, sterile L-PRF membrane (open the L-PRF tube inside the cell culture hood) and transfer the membrane onto a new cell culture dish.\nAspirate media from the flask and rinse the monolayer with PBS, add 5 ml of 0.05% trypsin and place the flask in the 37 oC incubator for 5 min, pipette the contents of the flask into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min.",
    "Decant the supernatant, gently tap the tube to break the cell pellet and re-suspend with 4 ml of fresh α MEM, dispense a mixture of cell suspension (50 µl) and trypan blue (50 µl) into the hemocytometer and count the number of cells\nSeed 4x105 cells within 10 mm glass cloning rings placed on top of L-PRF membranes to retain the cells within the membranes (rings can be removed after 24 hr).\nAt day 4, rinse constructs with PBS thrice for 10 min.\nAdd 1 ml of serum free media and 200 µl MTS reagent to each well and incubate for 2 hr at 37 °C.\nMeasure absorbance from 200 µl aliquots at 490 nm.\nSubscription Required.
