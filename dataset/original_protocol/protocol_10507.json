    "1. Fabrication of Microfluidic Device\nUse a graphic layout software (e.g., AutoCAD) to draw the outline of a T-microchannel. For the T-microchannel, the two feed channels are 90 µm wide and 2,500 µm long, and the confluence channel is 180 µm wide and 3,000 µm long. Connect the end of each channel to an individual circle with a diameter of 1,100 µm.\nMark ‘clear’ and ‘dark’ for the exposure and covered areas, respectively. For a negative photoresist (e.g., SU-8), the shape of the T-microchannel is ‘clear’ and the surrounding is ‘dark.’\nUse a laser pattern generator with a wavelength of 442 nm and a minimum feature size of 2 μm to transfer the pattern of the T-microchannel onto a chrome-on-glass photomask.\nUse the photomask, a substrate (e.g., single-side polished silicon wafer) and a permanent epoxy photoresist (e.g., SU-8) to make a mold through a standard lithography process. The photoresist layer is 55.2 μm thick. In general, the photoresist thickness should be thinner than the depth of correlation of the objective lens17-19.\nUse the mold and a transparent material such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate the T-microchannel20.\nFor fluidic connection, use a stainless steel tube of 2 mm in outer diameter to punch through-holes aligned to the circular patterns on the PDMS.\nTreat the surfaces of the PDMS and a glass slide with oxygen plasma at 60 W for 30 sec. Attach the PDMS to the glass slide. The oxidized surfaces of the two materials create a strong bond. Place the bonded PDMS structure on a hot plate for 5 min at 120 °C.\nInsert Teflon tubes into the punched holes for fluidic connection.\n2. Experimental Setup",
    "Construct the microscale schlieren system from a Hoffman modulation contrast microscope by removing the slit plate in the front focal plane of the condenser and replacing the modulator with a knife-edge in the rear focal plane of the 5X objective3. The depth of correlation, which depends on the numerical aperture of the objective17-19, should be sufficient to cover the entire depth of the microfluidic device. The surface of the knife-edge is blackened by anodic aluminum oxide to reduce its reflectivity.\nMount the high-speed camera to the trinocular tube of the microscope via a C-mount adapter. Have the camera face the optical path of the microscope through a beam splitter. Connect the camera to a desktop computer via an Ethernet cable. Set the gamma correction to 1 for the camera so that its grayscale readout is proportional to the input luminance.\nTurn on the light source. In order to avoid excess heat, use LED (light emitting diode) lighting.\nUse an image processing software (e.g., function imread in MATLAB) to obtain the grayscale values of an acquired image. Remove the knife-edge, adjust the illumination, the aperture and the exposure time so that the average grayscale readout of the image is about 10% less than the maximal value. This denotes the background intensity for a 0% cutoff and we use a value of 230 for an 8-bit image.\nInsert the knife-edge to block the incident light completely. Record the average grayscale readout of the image. This denotes the background intensity for a 100% cutoff and the value is about 15 for an 8-bit image.\nAdjust the position of the knife-edge such that the average grayscale readout of the acquired image lies in the middle of the values for 0% and 100% cutoff. Now the degree of the cutoff is set to 50%.",
    "Prepare two transparent fluids with known refractive indices21 that are completely miscible with each other as the constituents. To evaluate the dependence of refractive index on concentration of the mixture, check the literature21 or use the Gladstone-Dale equation22. If the curve is nonlinear over the entire range, pick other fluid components. Then, choose a designated composition below which the refractive index of the solution varies linearly with the concentration. For example, use dilute aqueous ethanol with a mass fraction of 0.05 and water as the working fluids.\nPut the T-microchannel on the specimen stage. Arrange the T-microchannel so with the confluent channel parallel to the knife-edge (Figure 1).\nPrepare two identical syringes: syringe A is filled with the working fluid that serves as the reference fluid (water), and syringe B is filled with the other working fluid (dilute aqueous ethanol). The size of the syringe depends on the desired flow rate Q and the specification of the syringe pump: Q = πd2V/4, where d is the inner diameter of the syringe and V is the speed of the plunger. Flow pulsation usually can be prevented by choosing a small syringe to increase V23.\nCollect the outlet fluid from the T-microchannel in a beaker. Ensure the Teflon outlet tube is fixed to the beaker's wall and its end is below the liquid level in the beaker in order to avoid vibration that would be caused by droplet breakoff.\n3. Calibration\nAcquire the images of the two fluids mixing and the reference images.",
    "At a given Reynolds number Re, set the flow rate of the syringe pumps, Q. Q is calculated from Q = µ(W+D)Re/4ρ, where µ and ρ are the viscosity and density of the working fluid, and W and D are the width and depth of the confluence channel of the T-microchannel, respectively.\nLoad one pump with syringe A and the other pump with syringe B. Connect the two inlets of the T-microchannel to syringe A and syringe B via Teflon tubing. Start the syringe pumps to deliver the working fluids into the T-microchannel at identical volume flow rates.\nWait until steady flow establishes. The steady flow condition is defined by the emergence of a stationary schlieren pattern.\nUse the camera controlled software to record twenty frames of fluidic mixing at a frame rate of 30 fps.\nStop the pump which is loaded with syringe B. Only pump the reference fluid (water) through one inlet into the confluence channel of the T-microchannel at constant rate.\nWait until steady flow condition is reached and no schlieren pattern is observed.\nUse the camera controlled software to take the reference image, when no optical inhomogeneity is present in the T-microchannel. Record twenty frames at a frame rate of 30 fps.\nRepeat 3.1.1 to 3.1.7 at different Reynolds number: Re = 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 so that no complex flow structure emerges in the confluence region of the T-microchannel24.\nUse an image processing software to divide the acquired image I(i, j) by the reference image I0(i, j)25, where i and j are the pixel indices.\nEmploy a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) package to simulate mixing of the designated fluids in the T-microchannel.",
    "Construct the three-dimensional model for the geometry of the T-microchannel. Discretize the flow domain into structured grids. To increase the accuracy, employ finer mesh in the confluence and the central region of the T-microchannel.\nAssign the physical properties of fluids and establish the boundary conditions to the flow domain. During the solving process, determine the concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient from the concentration obtained in the last iteration26 in order to update the local concentration.\nExamine the sensitivities of the computed results by performing the grid study27.\nFor each node (xi, yi) on the xy-plane, employ the CFD post-processing tool to take the average values of the concentration field across the channel depth by the trapezoidal rule: w(xi, yj) = {∑k [w(xi, yj, zk) + w(xi, yj, zk+1)]∙(zk+1 - zk)/2}/D28, where D is the channel depth. Use the central differencing scheme to compute the derivative of concentration with respect to the cross-stream direction: (∂w/∂y)i, j = [w(xi, yj+1) - w(xi, yj-1)]/(yj+1 - yj-1).\nFor both positive and negative gradients, extract the ratio of grayscale values I/I0 (obtained in 3.2) and the gradient of mass fraction ∂w/∂y (obtained in 3.4) at specified locations such as y = 0 (centerline, streamwise direction) or various given x (cross-stream direction).\nPlot the results and determine the relationship between I/I0 and ∂w/∂y, I/I0 = C1∂w/∂y + C2 (C1 and C2 are constants), with linear regression.\n4. Quantitation",
    "Repeat steps 3.1 to 3.2 for mixing in the target microfluidic device. The depth of the target microfluidic device should be identical or close to that of the T-microchannel. If unsteady phenomenon is expected, acquire a video clip (sequence of images) in step 3.1.4 instead. The frame rate should be high enough to resolve the dynamics of the transient flow clearly, while the exposure time should be identical to the value used in 2.4, 2.5, 3.1.4 and 3.1.7.\nUse the relationship obtained in step 3.6 to convert the ratio of grayscale values to the gradient of mass fraction in the target microfluidic device.\nSubscription Required.
