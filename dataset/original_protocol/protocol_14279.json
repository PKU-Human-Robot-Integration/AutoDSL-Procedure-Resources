    "All procedures in this protocol have been approved by German Animal welfare law and guidelines. Consider using 10- to 12-week-old NMRI nude mice and C57Bl/6 mice (donor: old female; recipient: male) throughout the experiments. Use NMRI nude mice for islet isolation. Keep the mice under defined conditions according to local animal facility regulations.\n1. Induction of Diabetes by Streptozotocin\nOn day -4, measure the body weights of 10 to 12 week-old NMRI nude mice and C57Bl/6 mice using a weighing machine.\nAccording to the measured body weight, prepare a 180 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin in 0.1 mL of saline per mouse.\n\tNOTE: Streptozotocin should be freshly prepared before use and covered with aluminum foil, as it is light-sensitive.\nInject the syngeneic and allogeneic mice each with a single dose of 0.1 mL of streptozotocin (180 mg/kg) intraperitoneally using a 26-G needle.\nOn day -3,-2 and -1 collect 2-4 µL of blood by puncturing the tail veins of non-fasted mice.\nUse 2-4 µL of the blood sample per test strip to measure the blood glucose in NMRI nude mice and C57Bl/6 mice\n\tNOTE: At this point, 80% of the mice should become diabetic (20 mmol/L).\n\t\nUse mice for islet transplantation when their blood glucose levels reach 20 mmol/L.\n2. Isolation of Pancreatic Islets from Mice\nAnesthetize the mice with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection with a 26-G needle.\n\tNOTE: The volumes of ketamine and xylazine were determined according to the body weights of the animals (0.10 mL/10 g).\nKeep the mice in supine position and disinfect with povidone-iodine solution. Confirm proper euthanasia by checking the pedal reflex.\n\tNOTE: In case of C57Bl/6 shave the abdominal region.",
    "Hold the skin with fine forceps and make a midline incision with scissors to expose the abdominal cavity. Place the intestine situs to the left and outside of the abdominal cavity on a sterile gauze compress.\nAdjust the stomach in another direction to locate the pancreas and other associated tissues.\nReach the aorta and make a small cut to drain the blood. Use sterile gauze for blood absorption.\nCarefully remove the intestine. Separate the pancreas from the stomach and spleen.\nExcise the pancreas and place it in a fresh Petri dish. Remove all the unwanted materials, such as fat, using forceps.\nFill a 5 mL syringe with 4 mL of collagenase and inject into the pancreas with a 26-G needle (stock solution: 30 mg of collagenase in 12 mL of Hank's solution).\nMince the pancreas with scissors to increase the surface area for an improved digestion and transfer to a 12 mL red cap tube.\n\tNOTE: Hank's balanced salt solution: HBSS 10x (100 mL), Penicillin-Streptomycin (10 mL), Gentamycin (1 mL), Ciprofloxacin (10 mL), HEPES (35 mL), distilled H2O (900 mL)\nPerform a digestion for 10 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Vortex the sample thrice at a regular interval for 15 s.\nMix the digested pancreas vigorously by hand for 3 min and place it on ice for 10 s.\nAdd 6 mL of cold Hank's solution to stop the digestion reaction and centrifuge at 560 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in 10 mL of Parker/fetal calf serum (P/FCS) medium at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: P/FCS medium: TCM-199 10x (100 mL), FCS (50 mL), Penicillin-Streptomycin (10 mL), HEPES (20 mL), distilled H2O (900 mL)",
    "Identify the islets based on their morphology (spheroid, golden-brown color) under a light microscope. Avoid islets with dark centers. Check for purity and viability by performing dithizone staining under a light microscope.\n\tNOTE: Dithizone binds to zinc ion and provides red-colored stain to the islets.\nUse a 1-mL pipette to count and handpick islets under a light microscope and transfer them to a fresh Petri dish (60 mm x 15 mm) containing 4 mL of P/FCS medium.\n\tNOTE: The volume of P/FCS medium in the Petri dish should not exceed 4 mL in order to ensure oxygen availability.\nKeep the isolated islets in 4 mL of P/FCS medium overnight at 37 °C in an incubator.\n3. Preparation of Animals for Islet Transplantation\nRemove the isolated islets from the 37 °C incubator and place them under a flow bench. Center the islets with a circular swinging motion of the Petri dish.\nFill a 1-mL syringe (blue 23-G needle) with 0.1 mL of P/FCS medium. Then, add 350 islets in 0.3 mL of Hank's solution. Keep the syringe in a vertical position to allow the islets to settle.\nDecrease the volume to 0.05 mL and replace the blue 23-G needle with a brown 26-G needle. To the same syringe, add 0.15 mL of Ficoll (density gradient medium) to the top to reach a final volume of 0.2 mL in the syringe. Avoid air bubbles.\nKeep the syringe in a vertical position and rotate it slightly to avoid the clumping of islets. The islets will settle at the cone of the syringe within 2-3 min.\nMeasure the body weight and blood glucose levels of the recipient mice; the blood glucose levels should be around 20 mmol/L.",
    "Anesthetize the mice with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (20 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection with 26-G needle.\nPlace the mice in supine position on a warm thermal plate (37 °C). Check the depth of anesthesia by pinching the toe.\nClean the abdominal region with povidone-iodine solution (skin disinfectant). To prevent the eyes from drying, keep them moist with eye ointment.\n\tNOTE: In case of C57Bl/6 shave the abdominal region.\n4. Islet Transplantation via the Intraportal Route\nOn day 0, start with a laparotomy by holding the skin with forceps and making a 2-3 cm-long midline incision with a scissor. Place a sterile wet gauze compress around the wound edges to keep it moist.\nPlace the intestine situs to the left and outside the abdominal cavity on the sterile gauze compress.\n\tNOTE: Keep the intestine moist throughout the procedure with pre-warmed 0.9% NaCl solution or sterile gauze dipped in normal saline.\nMove the duodenum and locate the pancreas. Locate the portal vein situated at the ventral site by pushing the pancreas upward. Use a finger and thumb to expose the portal vein and, once exposed, puncture it near to the liver.\nWithin 1 min, slowly and steadily inject the islets (0.2 mL from step 3.4) into the portal vein under the inspection of magnifying glass to avoid any leakage of islets.\n\tNOTE: After injecting, always check for remaining islets in the syringe. Take 1 mL of P/FCS media in a syringe, flush into a fresh Petri dish and count under a microscope.\nPlace a sterile gauge at the puncture site and apply pressure with the index finger (penetration depth: 0.5-1 cm) for 6 min to stop the bleeding.",
    "NOTE: The volume injected should not exceed 0.2 mL. Excessive volume and pressure can damage the islets due to shear stress.\nCarefully place the intestine situs, peritoneum, abdominal muscle layer, and fascia back into position.\nUsing forceps, lift the skin, close the muscle incision with absorbable silk suture, and upper skin layer with 2-3 clips.\nClean the surface with skin disinfectant, apply a wound healer, and place the mice in individual cages. Wound healer provides a water-resistant acrylate layer and protect from maceration and secondary infection.\n\tNOTE: Observe the mice until they have regained sufficient consciousness, provide tramadol (0.2 mg per mouse) along with fluids. In this protocol, mice recovered from anesthesia quickly and tramadol administration reduced the pain. After 7 days, the wound should heal.\nFeed the mice with regular food and water. Food and water consumption and urine excretion will increase after the streptozotocin injection.\nMeasure the blood glucose levels every day for the first week and then once a week in syngeneic mice. In allogeneic mice, measure the blood glucose levels thrice a week for up to 15 days.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
