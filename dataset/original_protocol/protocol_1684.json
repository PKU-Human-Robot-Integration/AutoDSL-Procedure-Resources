    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCleavage reaction\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThe in vitro cleavage reaction will result in digestion of the labeled probe by the endonuclease(s).\nNote: We have successfully used both commercial and home-made preparations of recombinant Ago2 in the cleavage reaction. To set the reaction conditions, it is advisable to perform preliminary experiments with variable ratios of the amount of probe and enzyme. A 10- to 100 fold-molar excess of the enzyme over the probe and 5 nM maximum probe concentration is normally used (see table below).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1240_15.csv\nIf using a different amount of recombinant protein, change the amount of probe accordingly.\nIn our system, the cleavage reaction required pre-incubation of the probe with cytosolic protein extracts (preparation step 1. e). This step might be omitted if it is not necessary for the cleavage reaction under study. Various control reactions for the specificity of the cleavage site and of the cleavage enzyme can be performed, as suggested in the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section.\nTo pre-incubate the probe with the cytosolic extracts, dilute the purified probe to the desired concentration and thaw on ice one 10 μL aliquot of cytoplasmic extracts/reaction. To each reaction tube add (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1240-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Diagram of a typical cleavage reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1240_16.csv\nIncubate at 26°C for 90 min, then move the tubes to ice.\nJust before starting the cleavage reaction, thaw the recombinant Ago2 enzyme on ice and dilute it to the desired concentration using a 1× cleavage buffer. Discard diluted unused enzyme. Add to each tube from step a (except the probe only tube) the following and incubate at 26°C for 90 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1240_17.csv\nStop the reaction by adding 0.5 mL/tube of TRIzol and purify samples.",
    "Samples can be purified according to TRIzol manufacturer’s protocol https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf] and adding 1 μL of Linear acrylamide as co-precipitant, or stored at −20°C STOP point. Avoid prolonged storage to prevent radiolysis of the samples.\nAfter purification, each pellet is resuspended in 20 μL of 2× Gel Loading Buffer from mirVana kit (or NEB supplemented with 18 mM EDTA) and stored at −20°C STOP point or used immediately for PAGE. In case of storage, the samples should be resolved by PAGE in the next few days to prevent radiolysis.\nDenaturing PAGE and auto-radiography\nTiming: 4 h\nThe products of the cleavage reaction will be separated by denaturing PAGE and visualized by auto-radiography.\nSeparate the purified products of the cleavage reaction by PAGE.\nPrepare and pre-run a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (see preparation step 7.a). If needed, change acrylamide concentration according to the size of the reaction products to separate.\nThaw 1 μL of labeled marker (see preparation point 5.a) and add 19 μL of 2× Gel Loading Buffer from mirVana kit (or NEB supplemented with 18 mM EDTA). 1 μL of marker will suffice, as the exposure will be long enough to get a strong signal.\nDenature marker and purified samples from step 2.b for 3 min at 100°C and incubate on ice for 3 min.\nLoad marker and samples on the pre-warmed 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (see preparation point 7.a).\nRun at 20–25 mA for about 2.5 h. If possible, leave an empty lane in between the marker and samples to prevent carry over and over-shadowing of the bands. Use the migration pattern of the loading dyes (see table in preparation point 7.b) to decide when to interrupt the electrophoresis.",
    "Remove the glass plates from the running apparatus and cool one of the glass plates by placing ice on it. This will prevent the detachment of the gel from both glass plates when separating them. Open the glass plates by using a spatula as a lever in between and detach the gel from the sides of the glass plates using a scalpel. Wet the gel dropwise with 1–2 mL of RNAse-free water and place on it a piece of 3MM filter paper, roughly cut to size, to lift the gel off the glass plate. Place the gel in between the sheets of a clear polypropylene plastic wallet and use a fluorescent sticker for orientation, if needed.\nExpose to an X-ray film in an X-ray cassette or to a PhosphorImager screen. If using films, it is better to expose at −80°C using intensifier screens. It is also useful to place two films, one on top and one underneath the gel, to get a long and short exposure. Using tape, secure the film underneath the gel to both the cassette and the gel, so that it will not move when opening the cassette to develop the top film. Troubleshooting Problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]:\nDevelop the top film after 18–24 h exposure. Depending on the intensity of the bands, expose the film underneath the gel for a longer time or place a new film on top of the gel for a shorter exposure. Troubleshooting Problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]."
