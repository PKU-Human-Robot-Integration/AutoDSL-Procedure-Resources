    "1. Setting up the HPLC system\nSet up a system consisting of two independent HPLC pumps (binary pump), one for each buffer. Both pumps need to be controlled together via a computer with respective software or by having a master pump. Implement a piston seal wash for both pumps, either via gravitational force or through a third low pressure pump. Designate one pump for buffer A (termed pump A) and one for buffer B (termed pump B).\n\tNOTE: Both have to be able to generate pressures up to 60 bar (6 MPa) and flow rates of at least 0.5 mL/min.\nConnect both pumps to a dynamic mixer.\nConnect the mixer to an injection valve with a sample loop of at least 1 mL capacity.\nConnect the injection valve to the column with a capillary via the corresponding end fittings.\nConnect the column to the fraction collector by using a capillary with an appropriate length.\n\tNOTE: This description is based on our HPLC system (see the Table of Materials), which requires more manual steps than newer and more sophisticated systems. Our system allows easy access and modification of all components. Quaternary pumps (with the binary gradient described here) can also be used and will lead to elution profiles and overall quality of the analyses similar to those achieved with binary pumps.\n2. Preparation of buffers, column and HPLC system\nPrepare the buffers for the extraction of soluble InsPs: extraction buffer (1 M HClO4) and neutralization buffer (1 M K2CO3). Prepare both buffers with ultra-pure deionized water. They are stable at room temperature for several months. Immediately prior to extraction, add EDTA to both solutions to a final concentration of 3 mM (e.g., from a filtered 250 mM EDTA stock solution).\n\tCAUTION: HClO4 (perchloric acid) is strongly corrosive.",
    "Prepare the buffers for the SAX-HPLC run: buffer A (1 mM EDTA) and buffer B (1 mM EDTA, 1.3 M (NH4)2HPO4; pH 3.8 with H3PO4). Prepare both using ultra-pure deionized water followed by vacuum filtration with 0.2 µm pore-sized membrane filters. These are stable at room temperature for several months.\n\tNOTE: EDTA should be included in all buffers to prevent interactions of cations with InsPs, which could result in altered InsP charge or even insoluble InsP salt complexes.\nProgram the gradient as follows: 0‒2 min, 0% buffer B; 2‒7 min, up to 10% buffer B; 7‒68 min, up to 84% buffer B; 68‒82 min, up to 100% buffer B; 82‒100 min, 100% buffer B, 100‒101 min, down to 0% buffer B; 101‒125 min, 0% buffer B. The optimal flow-rate for this gradient is 0.5 mL/min.\n\t\nDuring the run, collect fractions every minute, starting from minute 1 to minute 96. The remaining 30 min of the gradient serve to wash the column and the system, and do not have to be collected for scintillation counting.\nIf possible, set the maximal reachable pressure before the emergency shutdown of the HPLC pumps to 80 bar (8 MPa). This prevents critical damage to the column’s resin.\nWhen using a new SAX HPLC column, wash it thoroughly (>50 mL) with filtered ultra-pure deionized water before the first use.",
    "NOTE: This will ensure removal of the contained methanol, thus preventing salt precipitation in later steps. If possible, use a separate HPLC pump. If this is not available, make sure that the HPLC has flushed with water before washing the column. The flow-rate should not exceed 2 mL/min. After washing, the column is ready for the analysis and, when properly handled, can be used for 20‒40 runs. After that, the resolution will successively decrease. Prolonged washing with buffer A (>1 h) and performing step 2.6 can help increase the lifetime of the column. If the decrease in resolution persists, the column needs to be exchanged. The gradient can be adjusted to increase the separation between specific inositol polyphosphate species or to decrease the overall runtime. Using different HPLC systems (with different void volume or different volume of the capillaries) will strongly affect the retention times. Also, column changes have minor effects on the retention times.\nPerform a \"mock run\". Instead of an extracted sample, inject filtered ultra-pure deionized water in the HPLC system and run the standard gradient. The fractions do not have to be collected.\n\tNOTE: Step 2.6 is optional. However, it should be performed if one of the following situations apply: A new column is installed; The HPLC system has been used for a different method beforehand; The HPLC system has not been used for longer than 3 days; There was a problem with the preceding run.\n3. Plant cultivation and labeling with [3H]-myo-inositol\nNOTE: The following steps should be performed with sterile components and under sterile conditions, while wearing gloves to protect hands from contamination with the radiolabel. Plant media, especially when containing sucrose, are prone to microbial contamination.",
    "Sterilize A. thaliana seeds with 1 mL of 1.2% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min followed by 1 mL of 70% ethanol for 3 min. Then add 1 mL of 100% ethanol, pipette the seeds with the ethanol onto a circular filter paper and allow them to air-dry under a laminar-flow on a clean bench.\n\t\nWhen using L. japonicus seeds, place them in a mortar and scrub seeds with sandpaper before sterilization to ensure a sufficient germination rate.\nSow out Arabidopsis seeds in 1–2 rows on square Petri dishes filled with solid growth media consisting of half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt solution, 1% sucrose, 0.7% gellan gum in deionized water adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH and allow them to stratify for at least 1 day at 4 °C in the dark.\n\t\nFor Lotus seeds, sow them out in 1 row on square Petri dishes filled with solid growth media consisting of 0.8% bacteriological agar in deionized water and allow them to stratify for at least 3 days at 4 °C in the dark.\nPlace the plates vertically in a growth incubator or climate chamber and allow them to grow for 10–12 days under short-day conditions (8 h light at 22 °C, 16 h dark at 20 °C).\nTransfer 10–20 seedlings into one well of a 12-well clear flat-bottomed cell culture plate filled with 2 mL of half-strength MS salt solution supplemented with 1% sucrose and adjusted to pH 5.7.\nAdd 45 µCi of [3H]-myo-inositol (30–80 Ci/mmol, dissolved in 90% ethanol) and mix by gentle swirling. Cover the plate with the corresponding lid and seal it with microporous surgical tape (e.g., micropore or leucopore tape), placing it back into the growth incubator.",
    "CAUTION: [3H] is a low-energy beta emitter that can be a harmful radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested or absorbed through bare skin. Always wear gloves when handling radioactive material or equipment that has direct or indirect contact to radioactive material. Also follow the local rules for safe handling of radiochemicals (e.g., wearing additional protective clothes, use of a dosimeter and surveys of surfaces for contaminations on a regular basis).\nAfter 5 days of labeling, remove seedlings from the media and wash them briefly with deionized water. Dry them with paper towels and transfer them into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Do not overfill the tube, and place no more than 100 mg FW/tube, which corresponds to approximately 10‒20 17-day-old seedlings.\n\tNOTE: An excess of plant material will dilute the acid during the extraction process and will strongly decrease the extraction efficiency.\n\t\nSnap-freeze the tube in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C until extraction.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be kept at -80 °C for several weeks without compromising sample quality. The growth conditions (media, light, temperature, time) can be modified according to the needs of a specific experiment or plant species. However, care should be taken when diluting the [3H]-myo-inositol, in order to ensure quantifiable SAX-HPLC runs of good quality. Therefore, it is recommended to start with the [3H]-myo-inositol concentrations stated here and reduce it stepwise if desired. During labeling time, plants can be submitted to different treatments (e.g., environmental stresses or chemical agents) to assess the impact of those conditions on global InsPs. To reach steady-state labeling, we recommend to label plants for at least 5 days.\n4. Extraction of soluble InsPs",
    "NOTE: Keep samples and reagents on ice during the whole extraction process. Always wear gloves and protective glasses due to the high risk of contact with radioactive material, especially during grinding. Everything that gets in contact with samples is considered as radioactive waste and should be disposed of according to the local rules for safe disposal of radioactive material.\nPrepare the working solutions for the extraction and neutralization buffer as in step 2.1. Each sample will require 600 µL of extraction buffer and 400 µL of neutralization buffer. Store the buffers on ice.\nTake the samples from -80 °C freezer and keep them in liquid nitrogen until further processing. Grind the samples with a microcentrifuge tube pestle until they start thawing and add 500 µL of ice-cold extraction buffer. Continue grinding until sample is completely homogenized and the solution has a deep green color (if leaves are present in the sample).\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 4 °C at ≥ 18000 x g. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL tube. Keep in mind that the tubes used for extraction are considered solid radioactive waste and need to be disposed of accordingly.\nCarefully add 300 µL of neutralization buffer to the extract. Precipitation of proteins and bubbling will start immediately. Mix by swirling with a pipette tip after a minute and wait for a few seconds before pipetting a small amount (5 µL) on pH paper (ideally range of pH 6–9). The pH should be between pH 7 and 8 in the end.\n\t\nIf necessary, add small amounts (typically 10–20 µL) of either neutralization buffer or extraction buffer until the desired pH is reached. Let the samples rest on ice for at least 1 h with an open lid.",
    "Centrifuge the samples for 10 min at 4 °C at ≥ 18,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: The samples can be either directly used in a SAX-HPLC run or kept on ice (if used later on the same day) or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for 2‒4 weeks. To ensure a high reproducibility and comparability, it is recommended to always freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen for 5 min, even if they will be directly used afterwards. Longer term storage of extracted samples at -80 °C is possible as long as samples are only thawed once. If frozen samples are used for the analysis, make sure that no particles are visible after thawing. Otherwise, centrifuge again for 10 min at 4 °C at ≥ 18,000 x g and transfer the supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\n5. Performing the HPLC run\nEquip the fraction collector with 96 small scintillation vials (capacity of ~6 mL) and fill each vial with 2 mL of a suitable scintillation cocktail (e.g., Ultima-Flo AP liquid scintillation cocktail) compatible with buffers with low pH and high ammonium phosphate concentration (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The number of vials and the size of the vials depend on the fraction collector and scintillation counter used. It is important to at least collect the first 90 fractions, if the gradient described here is used, to obtain a full inositol polyphosphate profile. Also make sure to properly label every vial and its respective lid, to prevent mix-up of fractions or samples.",
    "Start the HPLC system/pumps and have it ready to run. Activate the piston seal wash and keep it activated during the whole run. Load the sample by manually injecting the complete supernatant from step 4.5 (approximately 750 µL) using a suitable syringe (see Table of Materials). If automatic injection is possible, transfer the sample to the corresponding sample vial. Turn the valve from “load” to “inject” position and start the gradient and the fraction collector.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the HPLC system used, the starting procedure might differ, especially when comparing older systems (as described here) with a fully software-controlled newer model. It is very important to ensure that the gradient, the sample injection and fraction collection start simultaneously.\nWhile the HPLC run is ongoing, check the pressure regularly. The starting pressure should be around 18–24 bar (1.8–2.4 MPa) and should slowly rise to 50–60 bar (5–6 MPa) once 100% buffer B is reached.\n\tCAUTION: Decreased pressure might indicate a leak in the system while increased pressure indicates a blockage. Pressure fluctuations (≥ 3 bar in a few seconds) can indicate the presence of air in the system. Keep in mind that everything that leaves the column, as well as every leakage that occurs at the injector or afterwards is radioactive.\n\tNOTE: The pressure also depends on the HPLC system and can be lower or higher than stated here. It will slowly increase after approximately 15–20 runs. However, this does not necessarily influence the quality of the obtained runs.\nAfter the run, close the vials tightly and mix the fractions with the scintillation cocktail by vigorous shaking. Proceed directly with the measurement or keep the vials in an upright position, ideally in the dark.",
    "NOTE: Fractions mixed with scintillation cocktail are stable for weeks and can be measured later. Since the half-life of tritium is 12.32 years, the signal loss is negligible.\nOnce the run of the last sample of the day is finished, stop both HPLC pumps.\n(Optional) To increase the longevity of the system, especially when it is not used regularly, wash pump B and capillaries by placing the capillary from buffer B into a bottle with buffer A and let the pump run for 10–15 min. Before the next use, remember to replace the capillary into buffer B and to uncouple pump B from the mixer to flush it with buffer B. Once the pump and capillaries are filled again with buffer B, reconnect it with the mixer and the system is ready to use.\n6. Measuring the fractions\nInsert the vials into scintillation counter racks and measure each vial for 5 min in a liquid scintillation counter.\nIdeally, use racks that directly fit small vials and avoid hanging in the vials in bigger (e.g., 20 mL) vials to reduce counting errors. The software settings used in this protocol are shown in Supplemental Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: Regularly perform an SNC (self-normalization and calibration) protocol using unquenched [3H] standards. Shorter counting times (1–5 min) are possible to reduce the waiting time. However, to ensure a high counting reproducibility and accuracy, 5 min are recommended.\n7. Data analysis\nExport the measurements from the scintillation counter as a spreadsheet file or a compatible/convertible file format. Evaluate the data with a computer equipped with Excel or similar software, and a suitable analysis software like Origin.\nPrepare a 2-D line chart where the measured counts per minutes (cpm) are plotted against the retention time (see Figure 1, Figure 2).",
    "To compare samples with each other, normalize the data by summing up the cpm from each eluted fraction from minute 25 to 96 for each individual sample.\n\tNOTE: Minute 25 is used as cut-off to exclude unincorporated [3H]-myo-inositol, InsP1 and InsP2 from the analysis, as those tend to fluctuate strongly and cannot be well separated (at least with the gradient proposed in this protocol) and thus strongly change the normalization factor due to their high activity.\nNormalize all data to the sample with the lowest total cpm (in fractions 25‒96) by dividing the total cpm from the sample with the lowest cpm (in fractions 25–96) by the total cpm (in fractions 25–96) of the other samples. The resulting factor can then be used to normalize the cpm from each fraction by multiplying the cpm of each fraction with the factor.",
    "NOTE: In the end, the sum of the cpm values from minute 25 to the end should be equal for all samples compared with each other. Only normalized runs should be presented in the same graph/figure (when presented as actual profiles). Supplemental Figure 2 shows an example of how these calculation steps are made (using only fractions 25–35 of two samples for simplification). However, in some cases it is not necessary to normalize data. For instance, when peaks are quantified according to step 7.4 and presented as percentages of total InsPs (as shown in Figure 3D). As stated before, when presenting multiple analyses side by side as profiles, or when the actual measured activity is used for conclusions (e.g., treatment a) increases InsP7 by x% compared to control, referring to the cpm values of InsP7 of both samples and not to their percentage of total InsPs) normalization is needed. To analyze the effect of genotype or treatment differences on labeling efficiency, it is important not to normalize, as this would invalidate these differences. However, absolute quantification with this method is challenging because the extraction efficiency with this protocol can be variable for various reasons and are sometimes even observed when replica of same genotype and treatment are analyzed. Keep in mind that depending on the HPLC system, column and gradient used for the analyses, the cut-off might need to be changed.\nTo perform relative quantifications of certain inositol polyphosphate peaks and to subsequently create bar graphs that contain data of replications for statistical analyses, continue the analysis with a specialized software that can calculate peak areas of chromatograms (e.g., Origin). See Supplemental Figure 3.",
    "NOTE: Most HPLC systems that are software-controlled are supplied with a respective software capable of this task. Peaks are determined as the fractions with cpm values above background (that varies to a certain degree between runs) and retention times that are similar to previously published data. The retention time of a specific peak is determined in spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) and used to assign peaks for calculation of definite integrals (e.g., in Origin). Supplemental Figure 3 illustrates this process of peak determination, background subtraction and integration of peaks."
