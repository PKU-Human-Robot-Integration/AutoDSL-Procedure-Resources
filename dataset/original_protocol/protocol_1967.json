    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding cells\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nFor culture of adherent cells precoat Lab-tek chamber slides with fibronectin (0.1 mg/mL) by adding 200 μL per well and then incubate for minimum 15 min at 37°C.\nAspirate fibronectin and seed cells at 20,000 cells per well into RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.023 IU/mL insulin.\nAfter 48 h, replace medium with low serum medium (RPMI/0.1% FBS) to starve cells for 20 h, this will maximize cell surface presentation of EGFR.\nNote: Washing cells ×2 with RPMI prior to addition of starve medium may be needed with other cell lines/receptors.\nCritical: Cells need to be evenly seeded onto the coated chamber slide (clumping in the middle or on the edges needs to be avoided as this will obstruct the imaging of individual cells). Visually inspect the health and morphology of the cells before and after the low serum starve to ensure cells are healthy and ready to proceed to the next stage. To maximize cell surface presentation of EGFR a 20 h starve works well for BT-549 cells but should be optimized for different cell lines or when analyzing other receptors. Starve times of 2 h–24 h may be appropriate with certain cell lines or receptors.\nRecycling assay\nTiming: 2–2.5 h\nOn ice prepare master mix for labeling cell surface presented EGFR, volumes below are enough for 6 chamber slides using 8 well/chamber slide:\nNote: Cell surface labeling solution master mix needs to be cold when added to cells.\nPlace cells on ice, aspirate medium and replace with 200 μL of cell surface labeling solution (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) per well.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1565_7.csv\nFor all aspiration steps, gentle manual aspiration using an Eppendorf P1000, or similar, is preferable to prevent detaching of cells from the slide.",
    "Concentration of EGF will affect the proportion of EGFR that undergoes recycling vs degradation, with higher EGF concentrations favoring degradation. To determine an optimal concentration for the recycling assay a range of EGF concentrations 0.1–50 ng/mL can be tested in different cell lines.\nConcentration of antibody to be used in the labeling solution can be determined by performing immunofluorescence staining with the antibody of interest in unstimulated cells. For most antibodies, concentration test range of 0.2 μg/mL – 1 μg/mL would be appropriate.\nLabel baseline cell surface receptors by incubating chamber slides with cell surface labeling solution at 4°C for 60 min with gentle rocking on rocking platform mixer.\nFollowing surface labeling, place all chamber slides on ice.\nFix the baseline (pre-endocytosis) sample with fixation solution for 5 min on ice followed by 10 min at room temperature (21°C–25°C).\nFollowing fixation wash ×2 with PBS (1×) then store at 4°C covered with PBS (1×) until processing.\nFor the remaining chamber slides, while still on ice, aspirate cell surface labeling solution and replace with pre-warmed trafficking solution.\nPerform an endocytosis pulse by incubating cells at 37°C for 15 min to allow EGF dependent internalization of antibody labeled EGFR.\nFollowing the pulse, place all chamber slides on ice.\nOn ice, aspirate trafficking solution (to remove unbound EGF and antibody) and add cold acid strip solution (to strip antibody from remaining surface receptors) and incubate with gentle rocking for 5 min.\nAspirate acid strip solution and wash gently ×4 with cold trafficking solution.\nNote: It is very important that all strip solution is aspirated prior to adding the warm trafficking solution. RPMI with Phenol Red can be used as a check to confirm effective washing (presence of residual acid will result in yellow color).",
    "Fix the post-endocytosis pulse sample and 0 min recycling sample with fixation solution for 5 min on ice followed by 10 min at room temperature (21°C–25°C).\nFollowing fixation wash wells ×2 with PBS (1×) then store at 4°C covered with PBS until processing.\nFor the remaining chamber slide, while still on ice, aspirate cold trafficking solution and replace with prewarmed trafficking solution to allow recycling.\nPerform receptor recycling by incubating cells at 37°C for 30 min to allow antibody labeled EGFR back to the cell surface.\nNote: Time course (5–60 min) of recycling should be initially performed to determine the best time point to use for assessing recycling.\nAfter the 30 min recycling time, fix cells with fixation solution for 5 min on ice followed by 10 min at room temperature (21°C–25°C).\nFollowing fixation wash ×2 with PBS (1×) then store at 4°C covered with PBS (1×) until processing.\nPause point: Once cells are fixed, they can be stored at 4°C covered with PBS (1×) for up to 7 days prior to processing.\nSlide processing\nTiming: 1.5 h\nAspirate PBS and wash cells ×3 in wash buffer (non-perm) or ×3 in wash buffer (perm) [for the post-endocytosis pulse only] (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nAdd 200 μL block solution (non-perm) or block solution (perm) [for the post-endocytosis pulse only] per well and incubate at room temperature (21°C–25°C) for 60 min.\nAspirate block solution and add 200 μL of secondary antibody solution (anti-mouse-Alexa488+ 2 μg/mL) diluted in appropriate block solution) and incubate in the dark at room temperature (21°C–25°C) for 60 min with gentle rocking.\nWash cells ×3 in wash buffer (non-perm) or ×3 in wash buffer (perm) [for the post-endocytosis pulse only] then mount using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI.\nImaging\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "In this protocol fluorescent images were captured at ambient temperature using Leica TCS SP8 with HC PL APO CS2 40×/NA 1.1 water immersion objective. Images were acquired using LAS X software (version 3.5.7) (saved in lif format) on the Leica SP8. Image processing was performed using Fiji/ImageJ.\nFor quantification, z-slices (0.4 μm steps spanning 2.8 μm) were taken per field of view (FOV = 193 × 193 μm) with a minimum of 6 fields of view per condition (total of 80–100 cells per condition).\nImages for comparison were acquired with identical acquisition settings and post-acquisition processing."
