    "1. Freezing of Human Pancreatic Tissue\nRemove adipose tissue, blood vessels, nerves and non-parenchymal tissue with a scalpel and tweezers, and cut the pancreatic tissue into pieces (~0.5-1 cm cubes).    \nPlace one pancreatic tissue piece in the center of a Cryomold, and cover it completely with cold Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound. Put the Cryomold into a jar whose bottom is covered with pre-cooled 2-Methylbutane and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the frozen sample at -80 °C. \n2. Preparation of Frozen Sections\nWear gloves throughout all steps to avoid denaturation of RNA.    \nClean the cryostat knife, specimen holder and paintbrush with cold 100% ethanol and RNase Away. Place the frozen tissue inside the cryostat. \nWait until the tissue, knife and brush reach -20 °C. Label the SuperFrost Plus slides and pre-cool them inside the cryostat chamber while waiting for the tissue to reach -20 °C.    \nApply the Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound on the specimen holder and place the frozen tissue on top. \nOnce the Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound is frozen trim the cryoblock and remove any excess of Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound with a razor blade. \nCut a total of 40 consecutive 10  μm slices from the pancreatic tissue block. Additionally we recommend cutting a first and middle slice to be saved for overview drawings of the pancreatic section that can facilitate the identification of islets within the slices during the microdissection process. \nTransfer the sections from the knife blade to the center of a SuperFrost Plus slide by touching the backside of the slide with your finger (covered with a glove) to warm up only the region to which the section shall adhere. \nDry the sections 1-2  min inside the cryostat at -20 °C, after which you put them into a slide box placed on dry ice. Store the sections at -80 °C.",
    "If necessary, clean the knife blade with paper towels and cold 100% ethanol. \n3. Dehydration of Frozen Sections \nPrepare the Reagents: pour 30 ml freshly prepared 70% ethanol, 30 ml DEPC-treated water, 2x30 ml 100% ethanol and 30 ml xylene into 50 ml Cellstar tubes (Falcons); chill and keep all reagents (except xylene) on ice.    \nClean the working space under the hood with 100% ethanol and RNaseZAP. \nProcess two cryosections as follows: fix in ice cold 70% ethanol for 30 sec, wash with 5-6 quick dips in ice cold DEPC-treated water, dehydrate twice for 1  min in ice cold 100% ethanol, incubate for 4  min in xylene at room temperature (25 °C), and air dry for 3-5  min. Repeat this step with another pair of cryosections.    \nInsert two dried cryosections back to back into a 50 ml Cellstar tube wrapped with aluminium foil to protect them from light and moisture. \n4. Laser Microdissection of Beta-cells with PALM MicroBeam, Zeiss\nClean the microscope with RNaseZAP and mount the Adhesive Cap in the RoboMover.\nSet the following settings: Filter set 09 (excitation: 450-490 nm, emission > 515 nm), AutoLPC mode, 50% laser energy, 65% laser focus, 100% laser speed, 5  μm distance between AutoLPC shots, 6  μm distance to line, working height: -10,100.\nInsert one slide into the stage.    \nLocate the autofluorescent beta cells under microscopic visualisation (5x or 10x lens).\nSwitch to the 40x lens, select the beta cells with the \"Freehand\" selection tool and microdissect them using the laser. \nCapture the tissue of four dehydrated cryosections into one AdhesiveCap. \n    \n    Comment 1: the time to dissect the beta cells of one dehydrated cryosection should not be longer than 10-20 min to avoid rehydration of the tissue sections which would result in RNA degradation.",
    "Comment 2: verify successful microdissection process by visual inspection after moving the stage to the checkpoint. \n5. Lysis of Microdissected Beta Cell Enriched Tissue \nRemove the AdhesiveCap from the RoboMover.    \nPipet 10 μl extraction buffer (XB, PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit, Arcturus) into the lid of the AdhesiveCap and incubate it upside down at 42 °C for 30 min.    \nSpin down at 10,000 x g and put the lysate on dry ice. Store it at -80 °C until the RNA extraction is performed.    \nRepeat steps 3.) to 5.) with all other sections. \n6. RNA Extraction \nCombine all ten 10 μl lysates  \nProceed with the RNA isolation by working at room temperature according to the protocol of the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit, Arcturus, using a 1:1 ratio Extraction Buffer (XB) to 70% Ethanol (including DNase Treatment). \n7. RNA Analysis \nUse 1 μl RNA for analysis of quality and quantity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (PicoChip). Quantitative evaluation is done in reference to a standard RNA loaded in parallel on the chip.  \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
