    "The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Ulm (Statement No. 19/12) and the protocol described therefore follows their guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent.\n1. Stimuli and Testing Environment\nTo keep distractions to a minimum perform the research in a dark or a very dimly lit and quiet room.\nUse an appropriate eye tracking device.\n\tNOTE: There are a wide variety of devices available to perform eye movement studies. In the present research a portable eye movement recording device with goggles was used, which synchronously measure binocular eye positions, using two integrated cameras with an infrared light emitting diode (IR LEDs), one for each eye18.\n\t\nTo ensure optimal eye-tracking, adjust the cameras manually by tilting them in all 6 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 3 rotational) until eye movement detection is optimal.\n\t\tNOTE: The measurements of the system are displayed in real-time on an experimenter's screen to monitor recording quality and participants' response behavior. The key features of the system are described below and detailed specifications are given in Table 1.\nImplement a standardized oculomotor testing paradigm, which is able to detect deficits in eye movement control.\n\tNOTE: This can be a series of tasks like smooth pursuit or saccade tasks, in which participants with impaired eye movement control perform badly (e.g., the methods described by Gorges et al. 201511). These participants have to be excluded from further testing.\nPresent tasks using appropriate software that projects the stimuli on a hemi-cylindrical screen via a projector mounted above the subject's head11. Additionally, ensure that a red laser spot (diameter: 0.3°, position: 10° vertical) is present for the D2-test.\nSeat the participants on an elevated chair with an adjustable chin rest, so that eye-to-screen distance is approximately 150 cm.",
    "Use set A and B of the CPM (12 stimuli for each set) for the first part of the experiment. Show these stimuli as 22° long/15° high matrices with six possible alternatives depicted below, which might fit in a 6° wide and 5° high blank space cut out from the matrix.\nFor the D2-test, use the five blocks with 47 stimuli, corresponding to line 2 - 6 of the standard D2-test15, and depict them one stimulus after another in the middle of the screen with a height of 11° and a width of 2.5°. Make sure each stimulus lasts for 2,000 msec.\n2. Running the Experiment\nBefore the experiment starts, ask participants to fill out a written informed consent form to ensure the study is in accordance with ethical standards.\nGive general instructions concerning the purpose and procedure of the experiment and control for CNS-active drugs, i.e., ask the participant if he/she is currently taking any medication which affects alertness and therefore cognitive performance.\nTurn off all devices which might be a potential disturbance, such as mobile phones or pagers.\nSeat participants comfortably with the chin rest in optimal position. Ensure that the whole screen is visible and ask the participant to maintain posture during the whole experiment.\nAsk participants to place their head on the chin rest and place the videooculography goggles onto their head. Adjust them to individual head size/shape.\n\tNOTE: Thereby, the best possible compromise between comfort for the participant and minimal risk of unwanted slipping during measurement must be made.\nMake sure that both eyes are visible on the experimenter's screen, where the images of the two eye movement recording cameras within the goggles are displayed and then focus the cameras to center the images on the screen.",
    "NOTE: This is important for optimal detection and tracking of the pupil as an improper acuity can lead to a disturbed signal.\nTo ensure continuous recording of eye movements at all times, start calibration of the system by instructing the participant to look in each corner of the hemi-cylindrical screen. In case the signal is lost, change the angle of the camera tracking the respective pupil of the eye to resolve the problem.\nStart the standardized oculomotor testing paradigm described above and exclude all patients with substantial visual impairments as these will cause corrupted task performance.\nInstruct the participant to track a single spot on the screen, oscillating horizontally (± 20°) and then vertically (± 15°) with a frequency of 0.125 Hz to map the non-calibrated orthogonalized 'raw' data from the eye movement recording device with respect to the 'true' orthogonalized eye position for calibration of the system.\nCheck if calibration is acceptable, i.e., if the 'true' eye movement and the 'raw' data are spatially and temporally synchronized and then instruct the participant to not move the head as this might result in bad data quality.\n\tNOTE: Position of the videooculography device and the subject is expected to be stationary during the course of the experiment, so that there is no need for re-calibration.\nExplain the procedure of the training session for the CPM:\n\t\nInstruct the subjects to identify the missing pieces below the upcoming matrices displayed on the hemi-cylindrical screen for which they have infinite time. After making a choice, have the subject close their eyes for at least 250 msec to start off a green frame outlining all of the possible alternatives of missing pieces for 1,500 msec each.",
    "Have the participant choose the alternative they think is correct by closing their eyes for at least 250 msec while their choice is enframed.\nProject the choice separately on the hemi-cylindrical screen. Ask the participants to confirm. If the participant confirms, instruct them to close their eyes again for at least 250 msec.\nInstruct the participants that the next stimulus (matrix with 6 alternatives of missing pieces) will automatically (again, presented by the software described in step 2) appear and that this will be done four times with training stimuli taken from set AB of the CPM14.\nAnswer any questions subjects might have about the procedure. Then, instruct the participants to choose the missing piece of the matrix, as they have learned during the training session and start the CPM (Figure 1).\nExplain the procedure of the training session for the D2-test:\n\t\nInstruct participants to direct their gaze to the center of the screen and observe 47 stimuli separately (47 d's corresponding to line 1 of the standard D2-test).\nInstruct the participants to look at the red laser spot positioned above the stimuli whenever a \"d\" with two dashes is presented until the next stimulus appears. NOTE: If no target stimulus is presented the gaze needs to be focused at the center of the screen where the next stimulus will be presented.\nAnswer any questions subjects might have about the procedure. Then, instruct the participant to proceed for the following five blocks of 47 stimuli, similar to the training session and start the D2-test.\nFor quality control, inspect the data obtained from each session for each subject carefully (visually by a trained experimenter). Check if data quality is corrupted, for example due to technical difficulties, corrupted eye movements or misunderstandings.",
