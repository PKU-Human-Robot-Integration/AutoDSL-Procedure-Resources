  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: When working with RNA maintain a clean working environment to avoid contamination by DNase and RNase enzymes that degrade DNA and RNA. Ensure that pipette tips and tubes are DNase and RNase free. It is also helpful to wipe down lab surfaces and equipment such as pipettes, tube holders, etc. with a decontamination solution.\n1. RNA Transcription with Corrole Treatment\nPrepare the corrole and inhibitor compounds in a 0.01:1 molar ratio of [complex]:[DNA].\n\tNOTE: In our case, the ratio was 4.3 fmol complex: 0.43 pmol DNA, where the DNA template used was apET-28c vector with ligA gene from E. coli under control of the T7 promoter. Other DNA with the T7 promoter are also valid candidates for running the transcription assay.\n\t\nDissolve Actinomycin D, triptolide, tpfc, and Ga(tpfc) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in clean, separate containers. Obtain the final concentration of a 0.01:1 molar ratio of [complex]:[DNA] by using serial dilutions with nuclease-free water.\n\t\t\nDissolve 1 mg Actinomycin D in 1.8 ml DMSO. Aliquot 10 µl to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/100 dilution. Aliquot 1 µl of the dilution to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/1,000 dilution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the final solution of Actinomycin D is 4.3 fmol.\nDissolve 1 mg triptolide in 0.64 ml DMSO. Aliquot 1 µl to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/1,000 dilution. Aliquot 1 µl of the dilution to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a second 1/1,000 dilution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the final solution of triptolide is 4.3 fmol.",
    "Dissolve 1 mg tpfc in 2.9 ml DMSO. Aliquot 10 µl to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/100 dilution. Aliquot 1 µl of the dilution to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/1,000 dilution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the final solution of tpfc is 4.3 fmol.\nDissolve 1 mg Ga(tpfc) in 2.6 ml DMSO. Aliquot 10 µl to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/100 dilution. Aliquot 1 µl of the dilution to a separate container and dilute to 1 ml with nuclease-free water to create a 1/1,000 dilution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The concentration of the final solution of Ga(tpfc) is 4.3 fmol.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These corroles and inhibitors are not soluble in water and must be pre-dissolved in DMSO. Small amounts of DMSO (below 1%) do not induce cytotoxicity in the cells (unpublished data).\nPrior to beginning the transcription reaction, prepare the necessary reagents individually or purchase them from a commercial vendor.\n\t\nThaw on ice all frozen reagents (refer to Table 1 for a list of frozen reagents).\nAllow the 10x Reaction Buffer and the 4 ribonucleotide (ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP) solutions time to mix until they are completely dissolved in solution.\nBriefly centrifuge all reagents to prevent loss of material on the rim of the tube. Once thawed, store ribonucleotides on ice while keeping the 10x Reaction Buffer at RT.\nCombine reagents for transcription reaction at RT (refer to Table 2 for a list of reagents).\n\t\tNOTE: The spermidine in the 10x Reaction Buffer can coprecipitate the template DNA if the reaction is assembled on ice rather than at RT.",
    "Mix thoroughly by flicking the tube or pipetting the mixture up and down gently. After mixing, centrifuge briefly to collect reaction mixture at the bottom of the tube.\nIncubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for a total of 2-4 hr.\n\t\tNOTE: The necessary reaction times will vary with DNA template size and sequence. This step may require optimization for specific sequences. Shorter templates may require longer reaction times for a high yield of total RNA.\nRemove 4 µl aliquots from each reaction after each hour and store at -20 °C. Modify as needed for desired timepoints.\n2. RNA Spin Column\nFollowing the transcription reaction, purify the RNA using microcentrifuge-compatible chromatography columns.\n\tNOTE: Use of RNA spin columns to purify RNA with greater than 20 bases results in greater than 80% recovery.44\n\tNOTE: Column chromatography is a common and convenient method to purify RNA. Other purification methods also exist such as Lithium Chloride precipitation, phenol:chloroform extraction, isopropanol precipitation, as well as other commercially available kits.\n\t\nEvenly resuspend the Sephadex matrix in the column buffer by vigorously inverting the column three or more times. Do this by flicking the column sharply.\nRemove the top cap from the column. There will be some residual Sephadex matrix in the cap; if the cap is filled with the matrix, replace the cap onto the column and repeat the previous step until the majority of the matrix is in the column.\nSnap off the bottom tip of the column.\n\t\tNOTE: Some liquid may escape from the column.\nPack the column.\n\t\t\nPlace column in a sterile (RNase and DNase free) 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube in a tabletop centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with eluted buffer from the column.",
    "Immediately place the column in a new sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and pipette the sample to the center of the column bed. Use 20-50 µl of sample to avoid overloading the column.\nCentrifuge the tube in a tabletop centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The eluent is the purified RNA sample.\n3. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (1% Agarose Gel) 42\nNOTE: Ethidium bromide fluoresces upon binding to DNA and RNA, therefore these biomolecules can be visualized with UV light by incubating them with 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide solution.\nPrepare a 1,000x stock solution of ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) by dissolving 5 mg ethidium bromide in 10 ml of water.\nPrepare Tris Acetate EDTA (TAE) running buffer for gel electrophoresis. To make a 50x TAE buffer combine 2.0 M Tris-acetate with 0.05 M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and adjust the pH to 8.5.\nPrepare a 1% (weight/volume) agarose gel by dissolving 10 g UltraPure Agarose in 1 L 1x TAE buffer and melting the agarose with a conventional microwave oven. Once it has cooled to 50 °C, add 1 ml of 1,000x ethidium bromide to the 1% agarose gel solution, mix by gently swirling or by inverting in a closed container, then pour the agarose solution into a gel-casting platform and allow the gel to solidify at RT.\n\tNOTE: Ethidium bromide is a mutagen and potential carcinogen. Wear gloves and handle solutions carefully. For proper handling procedures of ethidium bromide, please see: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927667[href=http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927667].\nAfter the gel has solidified, place the set gel in the electrophoresis tank. Add enough TAE buffer to cover the gel until the wells are submerged. Check that the level of the TAE buffer is approximately 1 mm above the level of the gel. Remove the gel comb.",
    "NOTE: Removing the comb after wells are submerged prevents air pockets from being trapped in the wells.\nPrepare the RNA samples. Combine 1 µl of each purified sample aliquot with 1 µl Gel Loading Buffer (or with 1 µl 10x loading buffer and diluted to 10 µl with nuclease-free water) and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down with a micropipette.\n\tNOTE: 10x loading buffer contains 20% Ficoll 400, 0.1 M Na2EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.0% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol blue. 0.25% xylene cyanol may also be added to the loading buffer, as it runs ~50% as fast as bromophenol blue and can be useful for monitoring very long runs.42\nLoad the gel with each sample by carefully pipetting the solution into the bottom of each well. Take care not to leave any air bubbles or mix samples between wells.\n\tNOTE: A RNA ladder can also be used to determine the size of the transcript.\nAttach the leads so that the DNA will migrate into the gel towards the positive lead. Set the voltage to the desired level, typically 1 to 10 V/cm of gel. Run the gel for however long is sufficient for significant separation between the RNA fragments, using the migration of dyes to monitor the progress of the separation.\n\tNOTE: A 23 cm x 25 cm gel at 250 V will take approximately 1 hr, while an 8 cm x 8 cm gel at 150 V will take approximately 20 min. Smaller RNA fragments have better resolution when run at higher voltages.\nTurn off the power supply when the dye from the loading buffer has migrated a distance judged sufficient for separation between the RNA fragments.\nImage the RNA under UV light as the ethidium bromide will fluoresce.",
    "Take a picture of the image and compare fluorescence intensities of the purified RNA from each condition.\n4. RNA Quantification via UV-Vis Spectroscopy\nPlace 2 µl H2O on a NanoDrop 2000, or similar machine, and measure the Blank.\nNext, place 2 µl of each RNA sample, following purification, on the spectrophotometer and measure UV-Vis from a wavelength range of 200 nm to 800 nm.\n\tNOTE: An A260 reading of 1.0 is equivalent to about 40 µg/ml of RNA, and pure RNA has an A260/A280 ratio of 2.1.45\nIn the case that absorbance is above 1 O.D., dilute the samples in nuclease‐free water to obtain an O.D. less than 1.\nUse graphing software to plot the various samples and compare O.D. at 260 nm.\nSubscription Required.
