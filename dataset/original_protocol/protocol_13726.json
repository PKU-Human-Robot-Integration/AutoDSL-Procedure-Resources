    "The present research was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Medicine (DI/115/2015) at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and the ethics committee of the Hospital General de Mexico (CI/314/15). The institution fulfills all technical specifications for the production, care, and use of laboratory animals and is legally certified by national law (NOM-062-ZOO-1999). Male Wistar rats weighing 150-250 g (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Facility of the School of Medicine, UNAM, for this study.\n1. Obtaining collagen matrix scaffolds from bovine femur\nObtain the condyle from bovine femur from a slaughterhouse certified by health and agricultural authorities of Mexico.\n\t\nCarefully dissect the condyle fat, muscle, and cartilage with a surgical instrument. Cut the condyle fragments into 3 cm x3 cm fragments using a saw cutter and clean the fat and blood with a towel. Wash the condyle fragments with water.\nBoil (92 °C) the fragments with 1 L of an anionic detergent (10 g/L) for 30 min. Wash the condyle fragments twice to remove any remnants of the anionic detergent.\nDry the condyle fragments for 3 h using filter paper (0.5 mm).\nPrepare a triangular (1 cm x1 cm x1 cm) CMS of thickness 0.5 cm from the fragments mentioned in step 1.1 (Figure 1A).\n\t\nDemineralize the fragments in 100 mL of 0.5 M HCl for 10 min with constant agitation. Remove the HCl.\n\t\tNOTE: Neutralize the HCl with sodium hydroxide (10 M).\nRinse the fragments three times with 100 mL of distilled water, 15 min each time, with constant agitation. Dry the CMS with filter paper (0.5 mm) for 1 h.\nUse a stereo-microscope15 to analyze the structural properties of the CMS (size of pores, pore formation, and porous interconnection) (Figure 1B).",
    "Use a scanning electron microscope16 to analyze the rough surface of the CMS trabeculae (Figure 1C).\nUse the dissection instrument for blending and stretching to evaluate the mechanical changes (plasticity and flexibility) of the CMS (Figure 1D).\nPack the CMS into the sterilization pouch and sterilize it with hydrogen peroxide plasma for 38 min. Store the sterile CMS in the original pack in a dry area at 20-25 °C until use.\n2. Preparation of the surgical area and handling and preparation of the animal model\nSanitize the surgical area, worktable, microsurgery microscope, and seat with 2% chlorhexidine solution. Sterilize all surgical instruments, surgical sponge, swabs, and disposable surgical drape through heat sterilization (121 °C/30 min/100 kPa)\nAssign the rats (n=5) into three groups of five rats per group: 1. sham, 2. hepatectomy, and 3. hepatectomy plus CMS, and follow all the groups on days 3, 14, and 21 days.\n\t\nAdminister ketamine (35 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg) intramuscularly in the hind limb.\n\t\tNOTE: The sedative period typically lasts for 30-40 min.\nShave the abdominal skin (5 cm x 2 cm) using surgical soap and a double-edged blade, and disinfect the skin using topical 10% povidone-iodine solution in three rounds17.\nPlace the animal on a warm plate in the decubitus dorsal position, with the neck hyperextended to maintain a permeable airway (Figure 2).\nEvaluate the depth of the anesthesia through the respiratory pattern and loss of the withdrawal reflex in the limbs.\nPlace a disposable surgical drape around the shaved skin and make an incision (2.5 cm) on the albous line with a scalpel, using the xiphoid process as a reference point. Avoid the abdominal wall blood vessel to prevent bleeding.",
    "Put the abdominal retractor in place and observe the abdominal cavity. Using the dissection forceps, extract the left liver lobe and place it on the metal plate (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: In the sham group, only extract the left liver lobe and then return the liver to the abdominal cavity. Suture the abdominal wall and skin with a 3-0 nylon suture.\nIn the experimental groups with and without CMS, use a scalpel blade and sterile scalpel blade (#15) to perform hepatectomy (approximately 40%) with two cuts. Use a triangular metallic template (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) to perform the hepatectomy (Figure 3B).\nTo prevent bleeding of the liver, maintain surgical compression with a swab on the edge of the liver for 5 min.\nHydrate the CMS in sterile saline solution for 20 min before the surgical procedure. Implant the CMS in the hepatectomy site with four stitches sutures between the liver tissue and the CMS to prevent displacement of the biomaterial. Use 7-0 non-absorbable polypropylene sutures (Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not remove the sutures in a second surgery; sutures can be used as a reference to identify the site of CMS implantation.\nReturn the liver to the abdominal cavity and suture the abdominal wall and skin with a 3-0 nylon suture. Clean the surgical incision with a surgical iodine-soaked sponge in two rounds. Observe and monitor the vital signs of the animals.\n3. Postoperative care\nAdminister meglumine flunixin (2.5 mg/kg) intramuscularly in the hind limb. Administer analgesics as approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.\nFor anesthesia recovery, place the animals in individual polycarbonate boxes with laboratory animal bedding in a noise-free area with temperature control (23 °C).",
    "Observe the recovery of the animals and monitor their water and food consumption for 2 h. Monitor animals post operatively as approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.\n4. Evaluation of liver function in serum\nCollect blood samples (500 µL) from the lateral tail veins of the anesthetized animals before the surgical procedure (baseline values) and at evaluation days 3, 14, and 21.\nCentrifuge the blood samples at 850 × g/10 min at room temperature (23 °C); separate the serum and store it at -80°C until use.\nPerform a panel of liver function tests: serum albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), and direct bilirubin (DB) (Table 1).\n5. Euthanasia and tissue management\nAnesthetize the animals for each evaluation (days 3, 14, and 21) by following the protocol described above.\nEuthanize via methods approve by the institutional animal care and use committee.\nPerform an incision (5-6 cm) on the albous line with a scalpel to observe the organs of the abdominal cavity and take photographs of the hepatectomy area of the sham and the experimental groups, with and without the CMS.\nTake liver samples (2 cm x 2 cm; 0.40-0.45 g) from all the study group animals and place them in a 4% formaldehyde solution for 24 h for subsequent histological evaluation.\n6. Histological analysis\nPreserve the liver tissues in 4% formaldehyde and dehydrate the tissue using a series of alcohol concentrations (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%); place them in xylene (1h) and embedded them in paraffin16.\nCut the paraffin blocks with a microtome into 4 µm-thick sections for the preparation of eight slides.\nPerform H&E and Masson's trichrome staining16.",
    "Observe the stained sections under a light microscope to select the representative areas of the liver, with and without CMS. Obtain photomicrographs at 4x, 10x, and 40x magnification and process the images using appropriate software18 (see the Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
