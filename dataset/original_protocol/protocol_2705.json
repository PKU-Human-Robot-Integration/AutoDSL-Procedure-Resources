    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExcision and human skin grafting\nTiming: 3 h/6 mice (for surgery)\nPost-surgical human skin to mouse dorsum integration duration [4 weeks].\nThis step describes how to graft human skin onto the dorsum of nude mice and how to maintain the graft post-surgery (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2360-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration for the xenotransplantation, STZ induction, and wounding procedures and timeline\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2360-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic illustration for the sterile tie-over bolus dressing technique\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: To generate a humanized skin graft mouse model, nude male mice of 8–10 weeks old will be used as the recipient animals to ensure successful grafting and minimize immune rejection.\nAnesthetize a mouse by placing it into the isoflurane induction chamber for 1–2 min. Then transfer the mouse to the nose cone that is fixed inside the BSC hood.\nPre-heat the mouse cage on a water circulating heat pad set at 37°C.\nDisinfect the skin on the back of the mouse with Povidone-Iodine prep pad and follow with alcohol swabs. Repeat twice more.\nSubcutaneously inject 20 μL of buprenorphine –Sustained Release (SR) with a 25G needle.\nUse a sterile skin marker to mark the excisional area of 2 cm (width) × 2.5 cm (length).\nPerform a full-thickness skin excision on the marked surgical site using sterile forceps and scissors.\nPlace the prepared human skin graft on the surgical site of the mouse.\nSecure the skin graft onto the dorsum of the mouse using 5-0 Monocryl or nylon sutures.\nPlace one stitch for each corner first.\nUse two stitches for each of the shorter sides.\nUse three stitches for each of the longer sides.\nNote: Interrupted stitches are recommended as opposed to continuous stitches to minimize the chance of the mouse tearing off the graft.",
    "Perform a sterile tie-over bolus dressing technique (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPlace the non-adhesive petroleum jelly gauze (Xeroform) on top of the graft.\nPlace a dry bandage on top of the Xeroform.\nWrap self-adhesive tape around the mouse’s mid-section and over Xeroform and dry bandage layers. Wrap until the wound dressing is fixed.\nPlace the mouse back into the pre-heated cage and keep the cage on the heating pad until the mouse wakes up.\nMonitor post-surgically mice every day to ensure that the dressing stays on top of the graft site. If the dressing is removed, the mouse will need to be anesthetized and the dressing retied.\nRemove the dressing under anesthesia on the 7th day after grafting.\nMonitor for healing, scar formation and graft acceptance/rejection every day.\nNote: If at any time post-grafting we deem that the unincorporated graft is detrimental to the animal's safety regarding infection or necrosis, a serial debridement on a weekly basis can be performed under anesthesia to ensure a safe outcome for the mice: a) Subcutaneously administer 20 μL of Buprenorphine-SR; b) Debride the human skin using #15 blade scalpel.\nNote: Euthanize the mouse if the skin is found to be infected.\nGrafted mice will be left to heal for 4–6 weeks so the human skin graft can be fully integrated.\nGrafted mice will be monitored daily by visual examination, and weekly by digital photography.\nMice should be single-housed and appropriately monitored for hypothermia, weight loss, signs of distress.\nBe aware that restrictive bandages may cause respiratory distress. If mouse shows any sign of breathing complication, rapidly remove the bandages.\nIf mice are hypoactive, not eating/drinking, weak, and/or are not nesting, Buprenorphine-SR should be administered to alleviate pain and Diet Gel should be provided to nurture animal.",
    "Note: Accepted skin grafts will show signs of slight wound contraction along the human skin with re-epithelialized edges. Successful grafts have robust capillary refill without evidence of venous congestion.\nSTZ induction\nTiming: 1 h/12 mice, 5 consecutive days (for injection)\nHyperglycemic state duration time prior to wounding: [6 weeks].\nThis step describes how to perform diabetes induction by administering Streptozotocin (STZ) and how to take care of diabetic nude mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Research staff must notify animal resource facility supervisor before STZ induction begins.\nPrepare STZ solution as described in materials and equipment.\nNote: Always prepare STZ solution fresh.\nAnesthetize grafted mouse by placing the mouse into the isoflurane induction chamber for 1–2 min. Then transfer the nude mouse to the nose cone that is fixed in BSC hood.\nNote: We recommend injecting under anesthesia to minimize handling of the transplanted human skin.\nPre-heat the autoclaved mouse cage on a water circulating heat pad at 37°C.\nDisinfect mouse back skin with Povidone-Iodine prep pad, then using alcohol swabs.\nSubcutaneously inject 20 μL of Buprenorphine-SR with a 25G needle.\nDraw STZ solution (15 mg/mL) into 1 mL syringe with a 25G needle and place it on the side of the BSC.\nNote: We recommend drawing up 500 μL of STZ solution and keep the rest on ice.\nTurn mouse over so that their abdomen is facing up.\nDisinfect the abdomen skin with Povidone-Iodine prep pad, then alcohol swabs.\nAdminister STZ solution by performing intraperitoneal injection.\nGive a dose of 55 mg/kg (0.11 mL of a 30 g mouse) once a day for 4 consecutive days. On the 5th day, give a 100 mg/kg dose.",
    "Critical: Typically, the injection site will be in the animal's lower right quadrant of the abdomen to avoid damage to the urinary bladder, cecum, and other abdominal organs. However, the injection site should be alternated between the lower left and the lower right quadrants of the abdomen to avoid repeated trauma to the same area after consecutive injections.\nInsert needle at a 30–40 degree angle and gently pull back plunger prior to injecting to observe contents.\nNote: 1) Aspiration of green material likely indicates that the bowel has been punctured, while aspiration of yellow, liquid material may indicate the bladder has been punctured. 2) The presence of blood indicates an abdominal blood vessel has been punctured. 3) If blood, urine or gastrointestinal contents are drawn back into the hub of the needle, remove the needle from the animal. The syringe/syringe contents and needle must be discarded.\nInject STZ solution.\nNote: The injection volume varies in accordance with the body weight of each individual mouse.\nReplace the needle with a new 25G needle for next mouse injection.\nSubcutaneously inject 300 μL–500 μL sterile saline to keep mouse hydrated.\nPlace the mouse back into the pre-heated cage and keep the cage on the heating pad until the mouse wakes up.\nMonitor mice daily after STZ injection for any signs of pain, illness, and distress.\nAdminister sterile saline subcutaneously if mice present weight loss of 5%–10% body weight.\nCritical: Closely follow the institutional guidelines on use of STZ in rodents.\nConfirm that the mice are in diabetic state.\nFast mice for 5 h on the 7th day after the last STZ injection.\nPrick the mouse’s tail using a 25G needle and use a standard blood glucose (BG) meter to measure fasting blood glucose.",
    "A BG value that is higher than 250 mg/dL is considered diabetic.\nMonitor mouse BG weekly.\nAdminister insulin every other day if 3 consecutive BG measurements exceed 500 mg/dL.\nNote: The dose and frequency of insulin administration (range: 0.1–1.2 U/kg daily) should be increased or decreased in response to a combination of measured BG and body weight. Mice will also be appropriately monitored for any signs of pain or distress.\nMice should sustain a hyperglycemic state for 6–8 weeks prior to the wounding experiment.\nWounding experiment\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to perform a full-thickness punch biopsy injury on the grafted human skin and place selected dressing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2360-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative images of xenotransplantation progress and wounding induction and quantitation\n(A and B) (A) Human transplanted skin over 10 weeks, (B) representative images of post-wounding skin on days 0, 5, and 7 with an example of treatment: alginate hydrogel.\n(C) The wound healing curve for alginate hydrogel treated wounds from Day0 to Day7. Data represent the mean and standard deviation values from n = 6 wounds.\n(D) Representative images of skin integration in a poor state.\n(E) Representative Day7 MTS histology images for the expected outcome.\nNote: After the 6–8 weeks of sustained diabetic state, one or more wounds will be inflicted on the transplanted human skin. Wound size can range from 2 mm to 6 mm in diameter using appropriate biopsy punches. In this protocol, we use 3 mm punch biopsies to inflict two wounds per mouse.\nAnesthetize human skin grafted mouse by placing it into the isoflurane induction chamber for 1–2 min, then transfer the nude mouse to the nose cone that is fixed in the BSC.\nPre-heat the autoclaved mouse cage on a water circulating heat pad at 37°C.",
    "Have treatment dressing and sterilized PBS ready in the BSC.\nDisinfect the back skin with Povidone-Iodine prep pad, then alcohol swabs.\nSubcutaneously inject 20 μL of Buprenorphine-SR with a 25G needle prior to wounding.\nIf needed, use sterile tweezers and scissors to debride the top layer of regenerated skin to have fresh healthy skin for wounding.\nPerform full thickness punch injuries at the center of the human grafted skin area using a biopsy punch.\nPlace the wounded mouse under digital camera set up in the BSC for imaging.\nMeasure the initial (Day 0) wound size using digital calipers and record the value for wound closure analysis.\nPlace choice of dressing immediately on the wounds.\nNote: Treatment options such as patches, drug-eluting bandages,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] or other newly developed therapeutic approaches can be applied to the wounded human skin to study healing.\nCover with Tegaderm, an occlusive dressing, for protection.\nPlace the mouse back into the pre-heated cage and keep the cage on the heating pad until the mouse wakes up.\nClosely monitor mice daily for any signs of pain and/or distress, weight loss, skin wound complications, or infections until the day of sacrifice.\nNote: In this protocol, we sacrifice mice on day 5 after wounding. Due to their small wounds, we recommend sacrificing mice no later than day 5 for better results in histology and molecular analysis.\nWound tissue collection for histological and molecular analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes how to collect wound tissue for histological and molecular analysis.\nSacrifice the mice according to institutional guidelines.\nEuthanize mice with excess CO2 on day 5–7.\nPerform cervical dislocation after euthanizing for confirmation of death.\nGently remove Tegaderm and wound dressing.\nPlace mouse under digital camera set up on the counter for imaging.",
    "Measure wound size using digital calipers and record for wound closure quantification.\nExcise the wound tissue with forceps and scissors including approximately 2 mm of uninjured skin around the wound.\nBisect the wound by using a #15 blade scalpel.\nWrap one piece completely in prepared and labeled tin foil sheet and immerse into liquid nitrogen to snap-freeze.\nPlace the other piece in prepared and labeled cassettes, then submerge the cassettes in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nStore snap-frozen tissues in −80°C for future molecular analysis.\nFor gene expression, first extract RNA from snap-frozen wound tissue using mRNeasy Mini kit.\nThen synthesize cDNA using RT2 First Strand kit/or miScript SYBR green PCR kit.\nPerform real-time PCR using RT2 qPCR Primer assay/or miScript Primer Assay.\nNote: We recommend selecting both mouse and human genes when studying wound healing on human grafted skin as the wound tissue includes both human and mouse cells.\nChange the 10% formalin solution to 70% ethanol after cassettes have incubated in formalin for 48 h.\nSubmit the fixed tissue to histology core for paraffin-embedding and tissue cutting onto slides.\nCritical: Care should be taken to correctly orient the wounds during embedding, so that each microtome section includes the entire length of the wound with the tissue layers and different structures discernible.\nUse sections of 5 μm thickness and perform Masson’s trichrome stain (MTS) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.\nQuantify re-epithelialization from MTS or H&E images by measuring the length of the epithelial tongue covering the wound and dividing by the entire length of the wounds.\nQuantify the thickness of the migrating epithelial tongue.\nQuantify granulation tissue area using MTS images.\nPerform immunofluorescence staining for α-smooth muscle actin, CD31 or other markers of choice.",
    "De-paraffinize tissue section and retrieve antigens of paraffin-embedded tissue sample using buffer solutions according to the antibodies used.\nFollow the general immunofluorescence stain guidelines to incubate section with primary and secondary antibodies at optimized concentrations and timings.\nObtain images of stained slides at X10 or X20 magnification with appropriate microscopy (bright-field microscope or fluorescent microscope).\nUse ImageJ to quantify cells/structures positive for specific markers.\nQuantify wound closure using both FIJI/Image J and caliper measurements (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Express the wound closure result as percentage healed at sacrifice compared to wound size on day 0."
