    "1. Maintaining 4T1 Tumor Cells in vitro\nCulture unmodified 4T1 tumor cells in complete DMEM (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin) in 10 cm tissue culture plates. Incubate in 37 °C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.\nSplit cultures 2-3 times/week. To maintain optimum viability cells should not exceed 80% confluence. Do not use cells for establishing in vivo primary tumors if cultures have been passaged in vitro for >1 month as this decreases malignancy and metastatic potential than earlier passaged cells.\n2. Harvesting 4T1 Tumor Cells for Injection\nAspirate culture medium from the tissue culture plate using a Pasteur pipette.\nAdd 10 ml of 1x sterile PBS containing 2 ml EDTA. Let the PBS solution incubate in the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 5-7 min.\nHarvest PBS solution from plate, rinsing the plate 2-3x with solution, transfer to 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min at 500 x g, at 4 °C, in a bench-top centrifuge.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in serum-free DMEM.\nDetermine cell concentration using a cell counter.\nDilute cells with serum-free medium to 1x106 cells/500 μl (1x105 cells/50 μl (for injection and place cells on ice.\n3. Injecting Mice with 4T1 Tumor Cells\nAll animal studies performed were in accordance with institutional guidelines at the Animal Care Veterinary Services of the University of Ottawa recommendations for all animals receiving orthotopic injections or tumor implants.\nTreat mice subcutaneously with Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) 1 hr before surgery for pain management.\nInduce and maintain mouse under anesthesia using 2.5% isoflurane during the duration of the injection. Pinch the footpad of the mouse to detect reflex response. If none is detected, effective anesthesia levels are reached. Sterile eye lubricant is then applied to prevent corneal drying.",
    "Load a 30 G ½ in \"Ultra-fine\" Syringe with precisely 50 μl of cells suspension. Ensure that all air bubbles are removed from the syringe column by tapping the side of the syringe to dislodge air bubbles.\nPlace mouse (under anesthesia) ventral side up.\nClean the injection site using an alcohol swab and introduce the needle horizontally and directly into the 4th mammary fat pad, slowly dispense the syringe volume.\nUse a cotton swab to clean any possible leakage.\nAllow mice to recover from anesthesia.\nMaintain Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for pain management administered s.c. every 8 hr for 2 days.\n4. Administering Perioperative Treatment in 4T1 Tumor Bearing BALB/c Mice\n           The treatment regimen and route for influenza vaccine administration is identical to the oncolytic virus preoperative treatment.\nAt 13 days post-tumor cell injection, measure the primary tumor using an external caliper. Measure the greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) with the caliper. The modified ellipsoidal formula is used to calculate the tumor volume (Tumor volume = 1/2(length Ã— width2)\nAt 13 days post-tumor cell injection, the primary tumor should measure approximately 1 cm3. When this tumor measurement is attained, prepare perioperative therapy reagent.\nOncolytic virus is one innovative therapeutic that one can administer in the perioperative period. Prepare oncolytic virus (1x109 PFU/1 ml) in 1x sterile PBS and place on ice prior to injection.\nSecure and place mouse into restrainer for intravenous tail vein injection.\nGently heat mouse tail in warm tap water to visualize lateral tail veins.\nLoad a 27 G ½ in \"Insulin Syringe\" with precisely 100 μl of oncolytic virus therapy. Ensure that all air bubbles are removed from syringe column.",
    "Inject the mouse with 1x108 PFU/100 μl/mouse to one of the lateral tail veins. If the needle is appropriately inserted into a lateral vein, no resistance should be felt when depressing the syringe.\n5. Complete Resection of Primary Tumor and Abdominal Left Nephrectomy\nAt 14 days post-tumor cell injection, initiate routine perioperative care following University of Ottawa Animal Care and Veterinary Service approved protocols. Treat mice subcutaneously with Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) 1 hr before surgery for pain management. Induce and maintain anesthesia using 2.5% isoflurane during the surgery. Under sterilized conditions and using sterile surgical instruments, surgical site is shaved and scrubbed. Animals are administered subcutaneous fluids and eye lubricant prior to surgery.\nMake a small incision (1-2 cm in length) to gently and completely remove the primary 4T1 tumor from the mammary fat pad.\nClose the incision with 2-3 9 mm staples.\nExpose the abdomen by cutting through the skin and subcutaneous layer along the ventral midline of the mouse.\nMake an incision at the linea alba (3-4 cm) to access mouse peritoneum.\nExpose the left interior side of the abdomen by moving the overlying bowels to the side. Make sure the intestines are kept moist with a saline soaked sterile gauze.\nUsing a blunt pair of surgical forceps, grasp the left kidney gently.\nUsing a 3-0 wax coated braided silk suture tied into a loop, ligate the hilum of the left kidney and secure with 3 surgical knots. Remove the left kidney with surgical scissors.\nInspect the suture tie carefully to ensure that adequate hemostasis is achieved.\nClose the subcutaneous layer with a continuous loop suture using 5-0 braided absorbable, then staple skin layer using 9 mm staples. Steps 5.2 to 5.10 should require 10 min/animal.",
    "Maintain Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for pain management administered s.c. every 8 hr for 2 days.\n6. Euthanizing Mice and Processing and Quantification of Lung Tumor Burden\nAt 28 days post 4T1 tumor injection, euthanize mice according to Animal Care and Veterinary Services protocol at The University of Ottawa.\nSpray down mouse with 70% ethanol.\nMake initial incision with scissors just below the rib cage.\nExpose the thorax by cutting through the skin and subcutaneous layer along the ventral midline of the chest cavity of the mouse.\nMake lateral incisions through skin and tissue on each side up to the neck of the mouse.\nDissect out the lungs by gently grasping the lung while snipping away the connective tissue above and below the lungs.\nPresoak extracted lungs in cold PBS to remove residual blood, then place in 10% Buffered Formalin.\nPhotograph each lung for tumor metastases assessment. Weigh lungs for tumor burden quantification."
