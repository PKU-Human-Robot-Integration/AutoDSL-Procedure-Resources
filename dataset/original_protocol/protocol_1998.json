We used 400 μM copper(II) chloride and 400 μM BCS in HAP1 cells.\nNote: Drug and metal concentrations should be selected based on the cell type studied and the goals of the experiment (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). If a metal or drug dose that may cause toxicity is being tested for ICP-MS, cell survival in increasing concentrations of the metal or drug should be performed first. For example, the IC50 for copper can for copper can be determined by quantifying cell survival using colorimetric assays like crystal violet (Comstra et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) or fluorescence assays such as Resazurin, and primary cultured fibroblasts can be treated with 50 μM without overt toxicity (Morgan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Thus, we recommend treating cells with 50–400 μM copper(II) chloride.\nIf you are not treating your cells:\nSimply change media the day before you intend to freeze your samples.\nPreparation of cell pellets\nTiming: 2–3 h\nDetach your cells and snap freeze them for storage at −80°C.",
    "Note: You can detach cells using PBS with either trypsin or EDTA (referred to here as PBS-Trypsin and PBS-EDTA). We describe both methods here, as trypsin may be preferred if speed of dissociation is a priority, whereas EDTA may be preferred for some experiments as it better maintains cell integrity. Additionally, some highly adherent cell types (e.g., fibroblasts) may be difficult to detach using PBS-EDTA. In the data shown here, we used PBS-Trypsin.\nNote: The concentration of trypsin used to detach cells may differ depending on cell type. In SH-SY5Y cells, the 10:1 v/v dilution of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in PBS described here is sufficient to detach cells without cell damage.\nNote: Cell pellets can be prepared up to a month before the ICP-MS analysis.\nPreparation on the day of the experiment:\nFor each 15 cm plate, label 1 × 15 mL tube and 5 × microcentrifuge tubes.\nLabel an additional 15 mL tube and 5 × microcentrifuge tubes for blank controls.\nIf using PBS-Trypsin:\nWarm PBS and PBS-Trypsin to 37°C.\nPlace additional PBS on ice.\nFill each 15 mL tube with 3 mL of media. (This will neutralize the trypsin).\nIf using EDTA:\nPlace PBS and PBS-EDTA on ice.\nGet dry ice.\nCool centrifuge and microcentrifuge to 4°C.\nDissociation with trypsin\nNote: Skip to step 11 if using PBS-EDTA.\nWash cells once with 10 mL of warm PBS.\nAdd 3 mL PBS-Trypsin and incubate for 2 min at 37°C until cells begin to detach.\nNote: This may take longer depending on the cell type.\nNote: Do not treat cells too long with trypsin, as this will can cause cell rupture and alter cytoplasmic pools of metals and other elements.\nDetach cells from the plate with gentle aspiration using a pipette.",
    "Transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL tube and dilute with 6 mL of warm PBS.\nFor blank controls, add 3 mL of PBS with trypsin and 6 mL of PBS to the corresponding 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 130 × g (800 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the cells.\nRemove supernatant.\nResuspend in 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nMix well and add 1 mL of your cell suspension to each microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: If you wish to prepare samples with known cell number, replace step 8 with steps 19 and 20.\nCentrifuge at 210 × g (1,500 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the cells.\nRemove supernatant (taking care to remove as much PBS as possible).\nImmediately transfer tubes to dry ice to snap freeze your samples.\nLeave samples on dry ice for 15–30 min.\nTransfer to −80°C for long-term storage.\nPause point: Cell pellets can be prepared up to a month before the ICP-MS analysis.\nDissociation with EDTA\nNote: Skip to step 19 if using PBS-Trypsin.\nWash each plate twice with 10 mL ice-cold PBS.\nAdd 10 mL PBS-EDTA to each plate and place on ice for 10 min.\nNote: This may take longer depending on the cell type.\nDetach cells from the plate with gentle aspiration using a pipette.\nPlace the suspension in a 15 mL tube.\nFor blank controls, add 10 mL of PBS-EDTA to a tube.\nCentrifuge at 130 × g (800 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nTransfer to labeled screw cap tubes.\nNote: If you wish to prepare samples with known cell number, replace step 15 with steps 19 and 20.",
    "Centrifuge this cell suspension at 210 × g (1,500 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant (taking care to remove as much PBS as possible).\nImmediately transfer tubes to dry ice to snap freeze your samples.\nLeave samples on dry ice for 15–30 min before transferring to −80°C for long-term storage.\nPause point: Cell pellets can be prepared up to a month before the ICP-MS analysis.\nNormalization of sulfur and phosphorus content to cell count\nNote: As sulfur and/or phosphorus content were used to standardize measurements across replicates, it is not necessary to count cells before preparing cell pellets. Phosphorus and sulfur are present in multiple biomolecules and represent 1.1% and 0.2% of the mass of a human body respectively (see ID#101913 in BioNumbers[href=https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=101913&ver=1&trm=chemical+composition+human+body&org=] (Milo et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Rumble, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18])). These facts make sulfur and phosphorus good standards likely to be stable under diverse biological natural and experiments conditions. Sulfur is present in cysteine and methionine in proteins and in sugars, nucleic acids, lipids, vitamin cofactors and metabolites, thus acting as a proxy for cell mass that can replace cell number counts or protein determinations. A compendium of biomolecules that contain sulfur can be found in Raab and Feldmann (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]. Phosphorus is an abundant element present in nucleic acids, nucleotides, and phospholipids, making it another good proxy for abundant biomolecules (Walsh, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nNote: If you wish to prepare samples with known cell number as we did here, incorporate these additional steps as you prepare the cell pellets.\nIf preparing samples with known cell number (otherwise, disregard):\nAfter dissociating your cells and transferring the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube (step 6 or 13):\nMix well and count cells.",
    "Calculate the volume of PBS needed to aliquot 1 mL of your cell suspension per tube with your desired cell number.\n(Example: For 1 × 106 cells per tube, if you count 8 × 106 cells, resuspend in 8 mL PBS).\nIf preparing samples with known cell number (otherwise, disregard):\nAfter the first centrifugation (step 7 or 14):\nResuspend in approximately half of the cold PBS needed to obtain your desired cell concentration.\nMix well and count cells again.\nDilute the cell solution with cold PBS to get desired cell concentration.\nMix well and add 1 mL of your cell suspension to each microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: As cells can be lost during centrifugation, not adding the full volume of PBS initially ensures that cells are not over-diluted and final counts are accurate.\nNote: For our samples, we generated cell number curves in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and HAP1 cells treated with copper(II) chloride or BCS (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Example for SH-SY5Y cells: We first resuspended cells to 2 × 106 cells/mL to prepare samples with 1 × 106, 2 × 106, or 3 × 106 cells (0.5 mL, 1 mL, or 1.5 mL of cell suspension per tube, respectively). We diluted the remaining cells by 4 in PBS (500,000 cells/mL) to prepare samples with 250,000 or 500,000 cells (0.5 mL or 1 mL of cell suspension per tube, respectively).",
    "Note: The number of cells per sample should be optimized for each mass spectrometry system and selected based on the expected outcomes, i.e., more cells may be needed to detect smaller differences between groups. Our results suggest high sensitivity for detection of as few as 250,000 cells, with similar correlations between sulfur or phosphorus and metal content for all groups (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1E, see r2 values). (See the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section for additional discussion of the sensitivity of measurements of ultra-trace elements like Co.) Based on extrapolation from the cell counts and standard curves used here, we anticipate that our ICP-MS system can accurately quantify Fe, Cu, and Zn from samples with as few as 1,000 cells, though we prepare larger samples when cells can easily be collected in bulk.\nD. melanogaster larvae sample preparation\nLarvae collection\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCollect larvae from each genotype and wash in PBS to remove food particles.\nNote: D. melanogaster crosses utilized the UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and were raised in polystyrene vials containing 10 mL of standard fly flood. Vials were kept at 24°C in a humidified incubator with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Females from the Actin5C-GAL4,UAS-GFP driver line were crossed to either male w1118 animals or male UAS-ATP7-wt. This allowed comparison between controls and animals overexpressing ATP7 (later referred to as Con and ATP7-OE, respectively). (See Hartwig et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] for more information).\nNote: Complete the steps below for each genotype separately. After collecting, weighing, and freezing all the larvae for one genotype, rinse both petri dishes and refill with fresh PBS before collecting larvae from an additional genotype.\nPreparation on the day of:\nPlace small puddles of 1× PBS in each of two SYLGARD™-filled petri dishes or empty petri dishes.",
    "Get tweezers, Kimwipes, analytical balance, and dry ice.\nNote: The PBS is being used to rinse the larvae, so the quantity does not need to be precise. A smaller pool of PBS in the petri dish where larvae are initially collected will make it easier to keep within the field of view under the microscope.\nUse forceps to collect 3–5 wandering, third-instar larvae, and place them in the pool of 1× PBS in one of the petri dishes.\nNote: The initial pool of PBS will become cloudy with food residue, so it is best to collect larvae from the vial in small batches.\nWith aid of a dissecting microscope, select female larvae for analysis and remove male larvae.\nNote: Male larvae can be distinguished by the presence of gonads under the cuticle in the posterior ventral segment of the animal (Karabasheva and Smyth, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nLightly grasp an individual larva with the forceps and gently jostle it side-to-side within the PBS to remove the food residue.\nIf any food residue is still visible after this process, use the side of one forceps tip to gently brush along the larval body to dislodge the food residue.\nOnce cleaned, move female larva to the pool of PBS in the second petri dish.\nNote: If the larvae are cleaned sufficiently prior to being moved to the second petri dish, this PBS should remain clear and will not need to be replaced as additional larvae of the same genotype are collected. If food particles are visible in the second petri dish, repeat steps 24 and 25 using a third petri dish.\nIf additional animals are needed, clean the petri dish used in step 22, add fresh PBS, and repeat steps 23–25.\nWeighing and freezing larvae\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "After all animals of a single genotype have been collected, individually weigh and freeze each larva.\nUse forceps to remove an individual larva from the petri dish. Place it on a Kimwipe to remove PBS.\nUse forceps to pick up larva from the Kimwipe and place it gently in a microcentrifuge tube. Screw on the cap and label the tube.\nFor blank controls, prepare empty microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: If you wish to prepare samples with known larval weight, first determine the baseline weight of the microcentrifuge tube and screw cap using an analytical balance. Record this value. Reweigh the microcentrifuge tube with the larva and cap and record this value. The baseline value can be subtracted from this post-weight to determine the weight of individual larva. See steps 31 and 32 for pooling samples.\nTransfer tube to dry ice to snap freeze the larva.\nRepeat steps 27–29 for each larva collected.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for up to a month before the ICP-MS analysis.\nNormalization of sulfur or phosphorus content to fly number or weight\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPool larvae together to prepare samples that can be normalized to fly number and/or weight.\nNote: As sulfur content is used as a proxy for fly mass to standardize measurements across replicates (see above: “Normalization of Sulfur Content to Cell Count”), it is not necessary to weigh flies before preparing samples. If you wish to prepare samples with known fly weight and/or pool samples from multiple larvae with similar total weight as we did here, incorporate these additional steps.\nIf preparing samples with known larvae weight (otherwise, disregard):\nTo pool larvae, assign larvae by weight to groups for analysis so that the average fly weight is similar across samples.\nIf preparing samples with known larvae weight (otherwise, disregard):",
    "Gather all microcentrifuge tubes with individual larva and place on dry ice.\nCombine all larvae for a given group in a single tube.\nThis can be done using forceps or by gently tapping the microcentrifuge tube containing the larvae to be transferred over the top of the destination tube.\nIf the larva is stuck to the side of the tube, gently flick the tube or tap against the bench to dislodge it before transferring.\nNote: For our samples, we analyzed between 2–3 independent biological replicates of groups consisting of 1, 2, 4, and 8 individual larvae for each genotype (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). This data was pooled to give a total of 12 independent replicates for WT flies and 10 independent replicates for ATP7-OE flies (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G)).\nNote: The number of larvae per sample should be optimized for each mass spectrometry system and selected based on the expected outcomes, i.e., more flies may be needed to detect smaller differences between groups. (See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].) Our results suggest high sensitivity for detection even for single larva, with similar correlations between sulfur and metal content for all groups (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G, see r2 values).\nICP mass spectrometry\nTiming: 1–12 h depending on the number of samples\nSample preparation\nTiming: 1–3 h depending on the number of samples\nDissolve samples in 70% nitric acid.\nTurn on heat block and set to 95°C.\nRinse a 25 mL or 50 mL tube with MilliQ water.\nAdd a small volume 70% nitric acid (approximately 2 mL) to the tube.\nAdd 20 μL 70% nitric acid to each sample using the repeating pipettor. Take care to ensure that the same volume is added to each tube.\nBriefly centrifuge to collect the nitric acid and the sample at the bottom of the tube if required.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1596_12.csv",
    "Note: Use as little nitric acid as possible to dissolve your samples to maximize the metal content loaded into the ICP-MS. 20 μL is the minimum volume we used. Larger volumes can be used if needed, but it is recommended that you start from 20 μL nitric acid and only add more acid if the sample does not fully dissolve. We increased the volume of acid used for samples with 1 million cells or more to be able to re-run samples if necessary (see volumes listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). We scaled the volume of acid based on cell or larvae number; however, this is not necessary. We would recommend increasing the amount of acid only if necessary to yield a homogeneous solution clear of precipitates for each sample.\nIncubate samples in the heat block at 95°C for 10 min.\nNote: Fully dissolved samples should be fully homogeneous without any particulates and are typically yellow in color. For samples with a particularly high lipid content, like brain tissue, follow the incubation with nitric acid with equal volume of concentrated trace element grade hydrogen peroxide. For further details, see McAllum et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] and troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPause point: Samples in 70% nitric acid can be immediately diluted with 2% nitric acid for analysis or stored at room temperature for 1–3 months. (Typically, we leave samples at room temperature for 24 h before diluting and running the samples. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] if samples are stored long-term and undergo evaporation).\nSample dilution\nDilute samples in 2% nitric acid and load them into the 96 well plate.\nDilute samples 1:40 in 2% nitric acid (add 780 μL to each tube containing 20 μL of sample).\nTransfer each of your samples to a deep 96 well plate (minimum volume 400 μL).",
    "Note: Alternatively, you can transfer the samples in 70% acid directly to the deep 96 well plate and dilute in 2% nitric acid in the well plate.\nNote: We used adjustable tip spacing multichannel pipettes to load our samples in order to save time and reduce the likelihood of pipetting error. This is not necessary but is suggested when working with large numbers of samples.\nNote: We recommend arranging your samples in a tube rack as you load them into the 96 well plate, then take a picture of the layout. This will help ensure that the plate layout can be matched to each sample.\nPause point: If required, seal the 96 well plate with sealing tape and store at room temperature for up to 1 month; otherwise, analyze immediately. (Evaporation is more easily controlled with concentrated nitric acid; thus, it is typically recommended to stop after step 36 if necessary).\nInstrument set-up, calibration, and running samples\nNote: Operating procedures may vary between instruments and models. Contact the instrument technical specialist to learn more about how to configure the ICP-MS being used.\nNote: We recommend the use of the 2DX prepFAST M5 system. Alternatively, a user can manually prepare the standard curve through standard dilution practices.\nNote: Store all standards in polyethylene bottles washed using 1% HNO3 in MilliQ-H2O prior to use.\nNote: The wash, sample dilution, and sample carrier solutions are 2% nitric acid in 18.2 Milli-Ω water.",
    "Note: Here, quantitation of trace elements in larvae or cultured cells were determined with a Thermo iCAP-TQ series inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). A triple quadrupole ICP-MS is required for this method. The instrument was operated in oxygen reaction mode with detection of elements of interest with the third quadrupole (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). This method removes polyatomic interferences by mass shifting the target element by 16Da after reaction with oxygen. The oxygen mass shift and MS/MS detection using a triple quadrupole instrument are critical to measure sulfur and phosphorus. The measurement of S+ and P+ with standard single quad ICP-MS using oxygen mass shift suffers from the inability to distinguish 48SO+ & 47PO+ from 47Ti+, 48Ca+, 36Ar12C+ and 48Ti+ spectral interferences. The implementation of a triple quadrupole allows for the first quad to mass filter for m/z ion at 31 and 32 which filters out the Ti and Ca interference ions. The reaction of S+ and P+ with O2 in the octopole then mass shifts them by one oxygen. Because the 47Ti+, 48Ti+, and 48Ca+, and spectral interferences were filtered out by the first quadrupole, the detection at m/z 47 and 48 of 48SO+ & 47PO+ after the third quadrupole occurs without poly atomic or ion Ca and Ti interference (Balcaen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Diez Fernández et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Together, the relatively recent introduction of the triple quad ICP-MS instruments improves the selectivity and sensitivity for detection of S and P in biological samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1596_13.csv\nPrepare a nine-point external calibration curve to quantify iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and zinc (Zn).\nPrepare 50 mL stock solutions of Multielement Calibration Standard for ICP-MS in 2% nitric acid (1,000 and 100 μg∗L-1; see prepare buffers for ICP-MS[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).",
    "Prepare solutions for the calibration curve. The calibration curve values should range from 0.5 to 1,000 μg∗L-1 and increase by 2× at each point (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 μg∗L-1).\nDilutions can be prepared using the 2DX prepFAST M5 system (Elemental Scientific) or manually through standard dilution practices.\nControl and monitor for potential instrument drift by automatic dilution of the sample with the Internal Standard for ICP-MS during sample introduction using the 2Dx prepFAST M5 system.\nNote: The Internal Standard for ICP-MS is a reference element solution containing 10 μg∗L−1 of Li-6, Sc, Y, In, Tb, and Bi (see prepare buffers for ICP-MS[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). The 2Dx prepFAST M5 system automatically dilutes the sample with the Internal Standard during sample introduction. Commonly, the Internal Standard solution is introduced with the sample via a ‘T’ piece using a peristaltic pump. Alternatively, the Internal Standard can be added manually immediately before analysis is performed; however, this is exceedingly rare.\nPrepare a four-point standard curve for S.\nDilute stock solutions of the Sulfur Calibration Standard for ICP-MS, a 100 mg∗L-1 solution (0.5, 1, 5, 10 mg∗L-1), in 2% nitric acid. Prepare 50 mL of each concentration.\nDilutions can be prepared using the 2DX prepFAST M5 system (Elemental Scientific) or manually through standard dilution practices.\nNote: Here, we did not use a phosphorus standard, so all data in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] are presented as counts per second (cps). However, we plan to perform quantitation of P similarly to S in the future using a certified P standard. (See the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog information for the Sulfur and Phosphorus Standards).\nWarm-up and tune the instrument as recommended by the manufacturer. (Typically requires 20–30 min).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1596_14.csv",
    "aQ3 resolution was set to normal for all of the elements. The list can be expanded to include other elements of interest. Each element was measured 4 times.\nNote: ICP-MS iCAP TQ Tune Solution is the tuning solution for instrument optimization (see the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog information). It contains 1 μg L−1 of cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), lithium (Li), thallium (Tl), and Y in 2% nitric acid.\nNote: Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] contains the acquisition parameters used. The r2 for calibration curves was > 0.9998. The prepFast system was set up with a 0.25 mm ID sample probe and a 250 μL sample loop. The 0.25 mL Precision Method used was provided as a prebuilt program by the manufacturer (Elemental Scientific) that is standard with any PrepFAST system and automates sample uptake, dilution, internal standard introduction, and sample introduction.\nMake up Seronorm Trace Elements Serum L-1 and L-2 standard reference material according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.sero.no/products/seronorm-trace-elements-serum/].\nNote: Seronorm™ Trace Elements Serum L-1 and L-2 are used to externally assess analytical performance.\nReplace any sealing tape previously added with X-Pierce Sealing Film for robotics.\nAdd samples and Seronorm Trace Elements Serum L-1 and L-2 to the sample deck and build the worklist.\nRun the Seronorm Trace Elements Serum L-1 and L-2 (800 μL of a 1:40 dilution in 2% nitric acid) and verify measurement of elements are within +/-20% of the accepted values (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nContinue with measurement of samples (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nIntersperse a Seronorm measurement every 20–30 samples.\nConduct data analysis within the Qtegra software.\nExport values from Qtegra.\nStatistical analysis can be conducted with Excel, GraphPad Prism, or any other relevant statistical analysis software."
