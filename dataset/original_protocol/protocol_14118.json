  "procedures": [
    "Ultrasound imaging in mice is performed with approval of the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol number: 2018-2967). During the imaging, the mice are anesthetized using isoflurane 1%–3% vol/vol and placed on a heating platform to reduce procedural stress and prevent hypothermia. Eye lubricant is applied to prevent corneal damage due to the loss of the blink reflex during anesthesia.\n1. Equipment Setup\nTurn on the ultrasound machine, heating platform, and gel warmer (Figure 1).\nOpen the ultrasound program. Enter the study information, such as the study name and mouse information.\nCheck the isoflurane vaporizer and O2 tank. If the content is low, fill the isoflurane vaporizer and/or exchange it for a new O2 tank.\nConnect the anesthetic scavenging filters to the induction chamber and the nose cone.\nOpen the branch for the induction chamber.\nTurn on the O2 tank.\nTurn the O2 and isoflurane knobs on the anesthesia vaporizer to 1 L/min and 0% vol/vol, respectively, to fill the chamber with O2.\n2. Preparation of the Mouse\nPlace the mouse in the O2-filled induction chamber to minimize unwanted cardiovascular changes due to anesthesia.\nTurn on the isoflurane vaporizer (1.5%–2.5 % vol/vol).\nConfirm the absence of the hind limb withdrawal reflex.\nRemove the mouse from the chamber and place one drop of sterile ophthalmic lubricant in each eye.\nRedirect the anesthesia to the nose cone and close the flow to the induction chamber.\nLay the mouse dorsally on the heating platform with its nose in the anesthesia nose cone.\nApply depilatory cream to the chest or abdomen, using a cotton swab. Minimize the amount of depilatory cream use to avoid irritation.\nWait for 1 min, and then, gently wipe off all cream and hair.",
    "Irrigate the area with warm water and wipe it dry to completely remove the cream.\nDot gel on each of the four copper leads on the platform.\nTape each paw pad down (palms down) to the leads for electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. This will provide the ECG and respiratory physiology of the mouse while anesthetized.\nVerify that the heart rate is between 450–550 beats/min. Since anesthesia affects cardiac function, which can alter the aortic diameter, adjust the delivery rate of anesthesia so that the heart rate is in an appropriate range.\nApply prewarmed ultrasonic gel to the prepared site.\nAttach the probe to the holder.\nRotate the platform for optimal scanning and lower the probe until it is in contact with the ultrasonic gel.\n3. Imaging of the Thoracic Aorta\nTilt down the platform to the left side of the mouse.\nPut the probe on the right edge of the mouse's sternum (Figure 2A). Orient the reference marker on the probe caudally.\nNOTE: The reference marker on the probe indicates the probe direction and is consistent with the maker on the monitor of the ultrasound system (Figure 2A-D). The shape of the marker varies in each ultrasound system.\nUse color Doppler on the thoracic aorta to confirm blood flow.\nAdjust the stage and probe angle to show the aorta clearly (Figure 3A,B).",
    "NOTE: The aortic valve and innominate and pulmonary arteries can be used for anatomical landmarks for the right parasternal long axis view. Therefore, aortic images from this view can include the aortic valve and innominate and pulmonary arteries in one frame (Figure 3A). If it is difficult to capture the entire ascending aorta in one scan, due to aortic pathologies such as aortic dilation and tortuosity, the images should be captured separately. Since separated images have the potential to cause an underestimation of the aortic measurements, fine positioning of the stage and probe is required. The right parasternal long axis view is optimal for imaging the entire ascending aorta (Figure 3C). However, it is often difficult to capture the aortic sinus in this view, especially in aneurysmal aortas. The left parasternal long axis view enables a capture from the aortic root to the proximal ascending aorta as an alternative approach, although this view cannot capture the aortic arch in one frame (Figure 3C). For the left parasternal long axis view, put the probe on the left edge of the sternum (Figure 2B). The stage is flat or slightly tilted to the mouse's right. Carry out the other steps of the procedure in the same manner as the right parasternal long axis view. Advantages and disadvantages of these probe positions are described in Table 2. Aortic images must be captured consistently in either right or left parasternal long axis view.\nCrop the ultrasound image to increase the frame rate, using the knobs for image depth and width.\nChange the focal depth on the dorsal side of the ascending aorta, using the knob for focal depth.\nVerify the ultrasound parameters. The ultrasound settings for this protocol are described in Table 1.",
    "Move the probe gently, using the X- and Y-axis stage knob, to capture the longitudinal aortic image with the largest possible diameter.\nStore one cine loop.\n4. Imaging of the Abdominal Aorta\nPlace the probe transversely, just below the sternum and xiphoid process (Figure 2C). The reference marker on the probe should face the mouse's right side. The abdominal aorta should be located next to the inferior vena cava and/or portal vein (Figure 3D).\nVisualize the abdominal aorta with color Doppler to confirm pulsatile flow.\nNOTE: If the Doppler angle is perpendicular to the blood flow, a color Doppler signal will not appear in the aorta. In addition to color Doppler imaging, the abdominal aorta can be distinguished from the vena cava and portal vein by slightly pressing down the probe. The vena cava and portal vein are compressible, while the aorta maintains its patency.\nCrop the ultrasound image to increase the frame rate.\nChange the focal depth to the posterior wall of the abdominal aorta.\nMove the probe caudally to visualize the branch points of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.\nLocate the right renal artery and use it as a landmark.\nNOTE: Since abdominal aortic aneurysms may lead to aortic tortuosity, adjust the probe angle to image the abdominal aorta perpendicularly. For an internal control, one image of the right renal branch point should be captured.\nCapture a cine loop of the region of interest which shows the maximum dilation in the abdominal aorta (Figure 3D,E).\nNOTE: The localization of aortic aneurysms varies in each animal model. Aortic dilation in angiotensin II-induced mice occurs predominantly in the suprarenal aorta, while CaCl2 or elastase induces aortic aneurysm in the infrarenal aortic in mice.\n5. Postscanning Mouse Care and Cleanup",
    "Wipe off the ultrasonic gel, irrigate the chest or abdomen with warm water, and gently wipe the mouse dry.\nReturn the mouse to its cage, which is placed on a heating pad.\nTurn off the isoflurane vaporizer and O2 tank. Refill the vaporizer if the isoflurane level is low.\nClean the ultrasound machine, probe, and platform with a soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol or glutaraldehyde wipes.\nDownload all files collected during the scan.\nTurn off the ultrasound machine.\nReturn the mice to animal housing rooms after they have recovered from the anesthesia.\n6. Analysis\nAnalysis of thoracic aortic images\nLaunch the analysis software and open the ultrasound data. An example image of analysis software (Vevo LAB 3.0.0) is shown in Supplemental Figure 1.\nSelect one aortic ultrasound image for measurements from the cine loop (Figure 4A,C,E,G and Supplemental Figure 1).\nNOTE: This protocol typically detects six to seven heartbeats in one cine loop. Since the aortic diameter is different between systole and diastole (Figure 4A-G), the measurements need to be examined at a consistent phase of the cardiac cycle. Systole is defined from the R wave to the end of the T wave. In general, T waves are difficult to identify in mouse ECG. Therefore, the aortic diameter in systole should be measured at physiologic systole, defined by visual inspection (Figure 4I). The cardiac phase when the aorta is maximally expanded should be midsystole. End-diastole is easily defined at the R wave of the ECG (Figure 4I). Aortic measurements in end-diastole are simpler than those in midsystole in terms of distinguishing the cardiac cycle.\nDraw a line in the center of the aortic lumen. This center line will be used to ensure that the measurement lines are perpendicular to the aorta (Figure 4B,D and Supplemental Figure 1).",
    "Draw perpendicular lines through the center line from the luminal inner edge to inner edge at the aortic sinus and maximal ascending aortic levels (Figure 4B,D and Supplemental Figure 1).\nMeasure the aortic diameter in at least three separate heartbeats and calculate the mean of the measurements.\nNOTE: The Vevo2100 system uses the Vevo LAB analysis software for measurements of aortic dimension. Brief explanations for each button are as follows. Measurement mode (Supplemental Figure 1A): this mode must be selected for aortic measurements. The slider of a cine loop (Supplemental Figure 1B): the ultrasound frame is selected using this slider. Traced distance (Supplemental Figure 1C): the center line is drawn with this function. Linear distance (Supplemental Figure 1D): the aortic dimension is measured using this function.\nAnalysis of abdominal aortic images\nLaunch the analysis software and open the ultrasound data.\nSelect an aortic image for analysis from the cine loop (Figure 4E,G).\nNOTE: Similar to thoracic aortic measurements, the cardiac cycle may affect the abdominal aortic diameter and area. Measurements should be determined at a consistent phase of the cardiac cycle.\nDraw a line across the largest luminal diameter, from the inner edge to the inner edge of the vessel lumen (Figure 4F,H).\nTrace the inner edge of the aortic lumen for the luminal area (Figure 4F,H).\nAcquire aortic measurements at a minimum of three separate heartbeats and calculate the mean of the data."
