    "All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of the Keio University School of Medicine adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, the Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experimentation at Keio University, and the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for the use of animals in research.\n1. Assembling the Eyeglasses for Mice\nPrepare parts needed for assembling the eyeglasses (Figure 1a). For each mouse, prepare all followings: one head-mounted nylon stick, one higher and one lower titanium frame, two lenses with proper powers according to the purpose of the experiment, one M1.4 size screw with the length of 10 mm, one nut for M1.4 size screw, one plain washer for M1.4 size screw with the thickness of 0.3 mm, and two artificial fingernail tips (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Two kinds of frames exist with different heights. For one mouse, one higher frame and one lower frame are used as a set. Higher frames should be put above the lower ones in order to make the vision fields symmetrical. Frames and lenses are specially designed and manufactured by authors’ research group. These are available by contacting the corresponding authors of this article. Other parts can be found in retail tool shops.\nAssemble the frame for the right and left eye separately.\n\t\nArrange the fingernail tip to face the outside direction to achieve the best protective effect. Adjust the angle between the fingernail tip and the frame to be about 130° to avoid masking the mouse vision field (Figure 1b). Adhere the artificial fingernail tips to the frame using cyanoacrylate adhesive.",
    "NOTE: Fingernail tips can help to protect the lens from being scratched by the mouse. The direction of the fingernail tips must be opposite because the higher frame and the lower frame are used for the right eye and the left eye, respectively.\nWait for at least 12 h to let the adhesive dry completely, then use a nail clipper to adjust the shape of the fingernail tips to be about 1 cm × 1 cm by cutting and trimming.\nAdhere the lens to the frame using cyanoacrylate adhesive. Put the lens onto the frame by hand and hold the frame horizontally. Inject the cyanoacrylate adhesive from the edge of the lens and let the adhesive spread by surface tension.\n\t\tNOTE: The adhesive will erode the lens and influence its transparency, so make sure the adhesive only touches the peripheral part of the lens. Use 0 diopter (D) plano lens as control and minus lens to induce myopia. The effect of different powers of minus lenses (–10 D to –50 D) has been described elsewhere4. To maximize the myopia inducement, –30 D lens is recommended for inducing myopia. FDM can also be induced with the same device simply by changing the lens into the cap of 1.5 mL microtube as the diffuser.\nTighten the screw into the nylon stick together with the washer from the flat side of the stick. Prepare the eye glasses and sticks before the experiment respectively and stock for further use (Figure 1c).\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Measurements of the Refraction and AL Baseline.\nApply one drop of mydriatic agent containing 5 mg/mL tropicamide and 5 mg/mL phenylephrine hydrochloride on each side of the eyeball to dilate the pupil. Wait for at least 5 min before general anesthesia.",
    "NOTE: Dilate the pupil under general anesthesia will cause reversible cataract which influences the measurement afterwards. Always dilate the pupil before general anesthesia and wait for at least 5 min. One drop (approximately 0.05 mL) of the mydriatic agent is enough for dilating the pupil of the mouse eye, while more agent will do no harm to the following steps.\nPut the mouse under general anesthesia. Grasp the back skin of the mouse softly to keep the mouse from bumping its eye until it is completely anaesthetized. Judge the depth of general anesthesia to be enough if the mouse does not move around when it is put on the table freely.\n\tNOTE: A combination of midazolam (40 μg/100 μL), medetomidine (7.5 μg/100 μL) and butorphanol tartrate (50 μg/100 μL) is used here for general anesthesia for mice with a volume of 0.01 mL/g intraperitoneal injection. Generally, less than 5 min are needed for mice to fall asleep. Long time of general anesthesia causes low body temperature and slow heartbeat. To avoid the potential influence of general anesthesia to the measurement, finishing all the measurements within 10 min after the injection of anesthetic is recommended. The butorphanol provided in the anesthetic cocktail provide approximately 4 hours of analgesia. Proper recipe for general anesthesia may different by institutions.\nMeasure the refraction of the mouse eye using an infrared photorefractor4,9,14. Adjust the direction of one of the mouse eyes to keep the first Purkinje image in the center of the pupil and measure the refraction along the optical axis. After the measurement, measure the opposite eye with the same procedures (Figure 2a).",
    "NOTE: The value measured for the refraction is strongly influenced by the position of the mouse eye along the optic axis. Ensure the first Purkinje image is aligned within ±3 degrees from the center of the pupil. The workbench of the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system may be used for fine tuning of the direction of pupil in refraction measurements4.\nMeasure the AL of the mouse eye using a SD-OCT system4,15,16. Define the AL as the distance from the corneal vertex to the brightest boundary near the optical nerve (Figure 2b).\n\tNOTE: Similar with the measurement of the refraction, the AL is strongly influenced by the direction of the mouse eye. The corneal vertex can be confirmed by the point-like reflection on the surface of the cornea. The boundary of the retina side will be very hazy at the point of optical nerve. Adjust the direction a little to let the boundary be clear enough for measuring but not too far from the optical nerve.\n3. Fixation of the Frame onto the Mouse Cranium.\nApply one drop of 0.1% purified sodium hyaluronate eye drop to prevent dryness on each eye.\n\tNOTE: Eye drop on the eye surface will influence the values of refraction and axial length measurements. Do not use the eye drop after the anesthesia until all the measurements are done.\nPut the chin of the anesthetized mouse onto a slope made of clay or anything can be used as a pillow to make the upfront plane of the cranium be horizontal.\nSterilize the hair and scalp between ears and eyes using cotton swab with 70% ethanol.",
    "Cut the skin between ears and eyes to expose the skull for about 0.8 cm2 using surgical scissors and tweezers. Use dental etching liquid and cotton swab to remove the periosteum. Sterilize the surgical scissors and tweezers with 70% ethanol before the surgery of each mouse.\n\tNOTE: Clipping the hair and wearing sterile gloves may be required.  Check the provisions of relevant animal care committee before this procedure. In most cases, the dental etching liquid can be found as one of the attachments in the self-cure dental adhesive system. If the dental etching liquid is not available, use 70% ethanol instead.\nAssemble a set of frames without lens to help fix the stick onto the right position. Put the frames onto the mouse head. Carefully adjust the position of the frames to make sure both eyes are in the middle of the empty frame.\nUse a self-cure dental adhesive system to attach the stick onto the mouse head. Be careful not to let the liquid of the adhere system flow into the mouse eye.\n\tNOTE: The method for using the self-cure dental adhesive system is different between products. Refer to the instruction carefully.\n\tCAUTION: Some of the reagents in the dental adhesive system may be toxic.\nWait for about 5 min and take off the frame and the nut carefully without changing the position of the stick (Figure 3a).\nInject 0.75 mg/kg atipamezole hydrochloride intraperitoneally to help the mouse to recovery from the anesthesia more quickly. Put the mouse into an individual cage until fully recovered. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Initiation of the Myopia Induction and the Maintenance Afterwards",
    "Wait for at least 24 h after the surgery to let the mouse recover from anesthesia completely. Grasp the stick and put on the frames with lenses. The inducement begins at this time point (Figure 3b).\n\tNOTE: To minimize the discomfort during the recovery from anesthesia and give enough time for the dental adhesive system to coagulate, it is highly recommended to put on the frame after the mice fully recovered from anesthesia. The resin cement of the adhesive system will fully cover the cut of the scalp. Therefore, no specific post-surgical treatment is needed for preventing infection and ameliorating post-surgical pain. Right after the first time of putting on the frame, mice will be over conscious to the existence of the lens and scratch it a lot. The gross behavior will be back to normal after a few hours. The mice with lenses can be kept with the same density to the normal mice.\nRemove the frame and clean the lenses and fingernail tips with cotton swabs at least twice a week to maintain the transparency of the lens.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to put the mouse under anesthesia for removing and putting on the frame. Provide a support for the mice to sit on, rather than having them hang while working with them could reduce distress.\n\t\nIf an interim measurement is necessary, put the mouse under anesthesia and measure the mouse as previously described. The inducement can be continued after the mouse recovering from the anesthesia.\nClean the cage at least twice a week.\n\tNOTE: This help to maintain lens clarity. Putting a net between the mouse and the cage bottom to filtrate the food scraps may also be helpful.",
    "Monitor the body weight and gross behavior. Compare them with the same age untouched mice during the whole experimental process.\n\tNOTE: Except for some scratching behaviors, no significant change including the body weight is found between experiment mice with untreated mice.\nSubscription Required.
