    "This study was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines (Basec ID 2019-01578). The video shows the recording of ECochG measurements with a MED-EL implant. The required hardware, software, system setup, and intraoperative implementation may vary depending on the manufacturer. However, the chronological sequence and measurement steps are independent of the brand. If necessary, additional information will be provided for the Advanced Bionics (AB) and Cochlear systems. The description of the theater is given from the surgeon's point of view.\n1. Before the surgery\nIndication\n\t\nPerform ECochG measurements in patients where hearing preservation is the goal.\nOur protocol is as follows: Stimulate with a 500 Hz pure tone, 30 dB above the hearing threshold with a minimum level of 100 dB HL and a maximum level of 120 dB HL. Ensure the following: an acoustic stimulus of a duration of 8 ms, the measurement window of 10 ms length for recording the ECochG potentials beginning 1 ms after the acoustic stimulus, and the measurement repetition set to 100 iterations.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the preoperative hearing test, other frequencies can also be used (i.e., 250 and 1000 Hz)8,14. Stimuli below 1000 Hz are preferred to avoid crossing the corresponding tonotopic intracochlear frequency region (resulting in a non-traumatic drop of the signal amplitude). More recent software versions allow the synchronous real-time measurement of different frequencies15.\nClean the patient's ear canal thoroughly. Check the eardrum.\n\tNOTE: Obstructing ear wax, liquids or debris might affect the sound transmission during ECochG10. The eardrum must be intact with no sign of infection.\nEvaluate the preoperative administration of steroids. At our institution, we use methylprednisolone 125 mg, intravenously administered, 6 h before the start of surgery.",
    "NOTE: Dexamethasone can also be used as part of the standard clinical practice, either the day before or at the induction of anesthesia16,17.\n2. Preparation in the theater\nCheck the required hardware and software for ECochG measurements. See Table 1 for the hardware and software requirements for different manufacturers.\nHave the engineer check the seamless functioning of hard- and software.\n\tNOTE: The following room setup is recommended: the engineer positions him/herself opposite the surgeon. In this way, he/she can monitor the measurement process well and give direct feedback to the surgeon (Figure 1).\nPosition the patient's head so that the mastoid segment of the facial nerve runs approximately horizontal.\n\tNOTE: The neck is thereby slightly retracted and the upper body in a reverse Trendelenburg position. Furthermore, the neck is slightly tilted away, and the head rotated to the not-operated side to give maximal access to the surgeon.\nShave the hair in the retro-auricular region (approximately 3 cm).\nInstall the facial nerve monitoring.\nDisinfect the surgical site and cover it with sterile drapes.\n\tNOTE: It is important that the auditory canal is included in this step. In addition, it is important that the cover must be as thin as possible in the area of the planned receiver coil position (to avoid connection problems between the transmitting and receiving coil). For this reason, choose thin drapes and place the fluid bag as low as possible (Figure 2).\n3. Getting started\nMark the position of the processor, the implant, and the skin incision.\nInject the local anesthesia (mepivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine).\nCheck the ear canal and clean traces of disinfectant solution. Check the eardrum.\nInsert the sterile eartip, connected to a sterile sound tube, deep into the external canal.",
    "NOTE: This step is important because displacement of the eartip leads to significant drops in the presented sound pressure10.\nPlace a large swab into the concha of the operated ear and tilt the ear forward. Fix the earlobe (including the eartip, soundtube, and swab) with a transparent adhesive foil.\n\tNOTE: This technique avoids strong buckling of the eartip and sound tube as well as eartip displacement, which can lead to attenuation of the presented signal. Furthermore, irrigation fluid and blood can no longer enter the external auditory canal.\nBefore connecting the sound tube to the non-sterile transducer, have the engineer check the functioning of the acoustic output.\nConnect the sound tube to the non-sterile sound transducer handled by the engineer. Cover the non-sterile part with a sterile blanket. Ensure that the sound transmission parts are tension-free.\n4. Implant surgery\nIncise the skin up to the temporalis fascia. Make an offset incision (5-10 mm anteriorly) of the periosteum in a lazy S fashion18. Dissect the periosteum off the bone and display the bony ear canal and Henle spine for orientation. Check the thickness of the soft tissue above the future receiving coil and thin it out according to the manufacturer's recommendations as needed.\n\tNOTE: The incision should be large enough to show the mastoid plane and accommodate the implant housing in a tight subperiosteal plane under the temporalis muscle.\nHarvest a 5 mm x 5 mm large piece of dermal fat to seal the posterior tympanotomy and 2-3 small pieces (1 mm x 1 mm) of periosteum to seal the entrance point of the electrode into the inner ear later on.\nPlace the wound retractors.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the retractor does not compromise the soft tissue of the auditory canal. This can cause the inserted eartip to dislodge, which leads to attenuation of the presented signal.\nPerform the surgical access to the middle and inner ear.\n\t\nDrill the mastoid bone with an overhang posteriorly to accommodate the electrode within the mastoid later on. During this step, harvest some bone paté.\nDisplay the lateral skull base cranially and drill out the mastoid bone evenly with the deepest point of dissection above the antrum.\nDisplay the antrum with the lateral semicircular canal.\nThin out the bony ear canal evenly until the short process of the incus is seen.\nDrill the bone caudal to the lateral semicircular canal toward the mastoid tip, parallel to the expected facial nerve. Display the nerve and, if possible, the chorda tympani.\nAccess the middle ear via a posterior tympanotomy. Drill near the buttress between the facial nerve and the chorda until the middle ear space is reached.\nCheck the position of visible middle ear structures (e.g., the stapedius tendon). Ensure that the ossicular chain remains intact.\nEnlarge the posterior tympanotomy caudally until the round window niche is visualized.\nReduce the bony lip of the round window niche until the round window is seen completely.\nDrill an anterior step in the area of the planned implant housing position. Check that the step is of sufficient size with the help of an implant bed indicator. Drill a channel for the electrode.\nRinse the surgical site thoroughly and perform meticulous hemostasis. Finally, place a 1 cm x 1 cm piece of gelatin sponge in the antrum.",
    "NOTE: In addition to surgical management, it is important that the anesthesiologist monitors blood pressure throughout the procedure (to minimize bleeding; if possible, the systolic blood pressure should be below 100 mg Hg). The gelatin sponge will stop drops of blood or irrigation fluid from running into the middle ear.\nChange gloves and wait for the engineer to pass the non-sterile stimulating coil to the scrub nurse. Instruct the nurse to pack the coil into a sterile sleeve.\n5. Insertion and ECochG measurements\nNOTE: At this point, the communication between the surgeon and the engineer is crucial.\nRinse the implant and insert it in the previously created subperiosteal pocket. Ensure a stable implant position against the drilled bony step. Depending on the manufacturer, place the separate reference electrode in an anterior, submuscular pocket. Check that ground and reference electrodes of the implant (on top of the implant, right below the coil) are well covered with soft tissue.\nPlace the stimulating coil above the magnet of the receiving coil. Rotate the transmitting coil 180° back and forth to align the MR-compatible magnets. Wait for the engineer to measure the wireless connection (coupling check). When the connection is 100%, fix the transmitting coil with an adhesive foil to ensure that the coils do not displace during implantation.\nInspect the middle ear again. Ensure that the middle ear space is air-filled. Carefully open the round window membrane. Ensure that the opening is sufficiently large and do not accidentally suction the perilymph.\nInsert the first electrode into the round window. If applicable and depending on the manufacturer, condition the electrode. Now, wait for the engineer to perform an impedance check.\n\tNOTE: Impedance values are manufacturer-specific.As a rough guide, the impedance should be below 10 kΩ.",
    "Insert the electrode slowly while carefully following hearing preservation techniques19. Keep the technician informed of progress (e.g., markers, number of electrodes in the cochlea) during insertion. Also instruct the technician to record and clearly communicate the ECochG potentials, i) if there is a signal (most commonly a CM signal), ii) how the signal evolves, and iii) if there are abrupt signal changes.\n\t\nWith a MED-EL implant, perform the stepwise procedure described previously7.\n\t\t\nith the standard software, use condensation polarity with a recording window of 9.6 ms. Set the measurement delay to 1 ms and perform 100 iterations.\nInsert the electrode slowly and halt the insertion process after every second or third electrode (increase the number of recordings towards the end).\nPerform an ECochG measurement while holding the electrode array in place. Instruct the engineer to communicate as soon as the measurement is complete. Repeat ECochG until a full insertion is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: Since our article's acceptance, MED-EL has released new software (research software version: Maestro with Dataman Acoustic Stimulator v3.0) allowing continuous intraoperative measurements. In our demonstration video, we use this newer version. With the software update, stepwise electrode insertion is no longer necessary to perform intraoperative ECochG recording.\nWith AB or Cochlear implants, record ECochG potentials with alternating polarities while the electrode is moved/inserted8,20. Communicate visible landmarks to the engineer (e.g., first implant marker is reached).\nIn case of an amplitude loss of the ECochG signal, retract the electrode slightly and repeat the measurement21.\nAfter full insertion, have the engineer continue to record ECochG. Communicate each surgical step (e.g., sealing of the round window niche).",
    "Drape the electrode within the mastoid cavity. Seal the round window with small pieces of the previously harvested fat. Stabilize the electrode within the posterior tympanotomy with a larger piece of fascia or periosteum. Embed the electrode in the bony channel with some bone paté.\nHave the engineer check the integrity of the implant (impedance and electrically evoked compound action potentials). Continue with postinsertion ECochG recordings later.\nClose the wound in layers (periosteal layer, subcutaneous layer, skin).\nRemove the sound tube and eartip; check for possible kinking or dislodgment. Finally, check the eardrum."
