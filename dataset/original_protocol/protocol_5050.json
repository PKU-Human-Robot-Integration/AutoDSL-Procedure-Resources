    "Penetration assays   Pipette 20 μl conidial suspension (3 x 107 conidia per ml) of V. dahliae stored at -80 °C in 20% glycerol and plate the suspension culture onto the PDA plate and incubate for 5 days at 26 °C in the dark.    Prepare Minimal medium (MM medium) and autoclave 20 min at 113 °C. Pour plates after cooling the medium down to 50-60 °C and dry the plates in a clean bench.    Cut the flat sheet membranes of cellophane into circles of 90 mm diameter and autoclave 20 min at 113 °C. Lay one circle on each MM plate prepared in step A2.    Use a sterilized pipette tip to inoculate the fungi from step A1 onto the cellophane membrane overlaid on the MM medium. Grow cultures for 3 days at 26 °C in the dark. Then remove the membrane and incubate the medium for 7 days to observe hyphae in the underlying medium for determination of breach of cellophane (Figure 1).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212175419_5033.jpg Figure 1.

Xinluzao NO. 16) and strain V592 of V. dahliae were used in our lab for pathogenicity assays.   Sterilize cotton seeds for 15 min and rinse three times with distilled water. Soak the seeds overnight at room temperature. Germinate seeds in pots filled with wet soil and cover with plastic dome for one week to grow seedlings until two cotyledons are fully expanded.",
    "Transplant 12 seedlings per pot with MS liquid medium and grow at 26 °C with a 16 h light (8,000 lux)/8 h dark cycle for about 2 weeks before inoculation of V592.    Streak V592 onto fresh PDA plates (from older PDA plates or glycerol stocks) and incubate for 1 week. Transfer one plate (90 mm) of mycelia by a sterilized blade into 200 ml Czapek-Dox medium with shaking at 200 rpm for 3-4 days at 26 °C in the dark to obtain conidia.   Prepare the conidial suspension through filtrating the fungal cultures with 4 layers of sterilized gauze to remove mycelia. Measure the concentration of conidia in the suspension using a hemocytometer and adjust to approximately 1 x 107 conidia per ml with Czapek-Dox medium.   Immerse the roots of seedlings with two true leaves to the conidial suspension from step B4 for 1 h (Figure 2A). Put back the inoculated seedlings to MS liquid medium and supply water once a week.   Count disease incidence by the percentage of cottons that showed wilting symptom at 30 dpi (Figure 2B). The infection assay was repeated at least three times with 3 pots of cotton each trial.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212175719_2000.jpg Figure 2. Pathogenicity assay of V. dahliae. A. Root-dip inoculation of cotton seedling with conidia suspension. B. Representative disease symptom in cotton at 30 dpi of V. dahliae.      Fungal recovery To identify the colonization of V. dahliae in vascular tissues, we isolate the inoculated cotton stems to recover the fungi.   Cut the stem above cotyledons of cotton at 30 days post inoculation (Figure 3).   Sterilize the stem sections for 1 min in 70% ethanol within a 50 ml conical tube followed by 60 min in 40 ml of 10% (v/v) H2O2 (dilute the 30% [v/v] H2O2 with distilled water).",
    "Revolve the tube on the rotator at 20 rpm during this process.   Rinse the stems three times with sterilized water for 3 min each time and culture at 26 °C on PDA medium in the dark. The colonies of V. dahliae can grow on the stems within 1 week (Figure 3).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212175927_6195.jpg Figure 3.
