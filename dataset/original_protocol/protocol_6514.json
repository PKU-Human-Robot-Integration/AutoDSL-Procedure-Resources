    "A.  Collecting flies for myofibril preparationRaise flies of the desired genotype in vials. Either make a fresh flip of the dissection stock or set a cross with at least 20 female virgin flies. Maintain bottles until the flies begin to hatch.Collect freshly hatched flies and keep them on fresh food until they reach the desired age.Notes: Flies should be raised under standard laboratory conditions at 25 °C. As wild type we used an isogenized w1118 strain. For our analysis we dissected flies ~24 h after eclosion. B.  Dissecting flies for individual myofibril preparationPrepare dissection solution freshly from 2x relaxing solution and glycerol (see Recipes 1 and 3).Assemble the necessary equipment including two precision tweezers, a pipette, pipette tips, dissection pad, and the dissection solution on ice.Pipette 200 µl ice-cold dissection solution onto the dissection pad.Anesthetize flies and transfer them onto the dissection pad one by one. Remove the head, abdomen, wings and legs from the thorax using tweezers under a stereomicroscope while the flies are still anesthetized. Use IFMs from about 6 thoraces per tube.Move the thoraces into the dissection solution and tear them open. Incubate the hemi-thoraces for 2 h in dissection solution on ice or store them at -20 °C over night.Use tweezers to isolate the Dorsal Longitudinal flight Muscles (DLMs) from the thoraces and place them into an Eppendorf tube in dissection solution supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100.Dissociate the DLMs by pipetting them ~10 times with medium speed using a 200 µl pipette.Spin at 10,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C and wash myofibrils by re-suspending them in 200 µl 1x relaxing solution. To re-suspend the pellet pipette up and down ~10 times with medium speed.Repeat the centrifugation and washing step.Repeat the centrifugation and re-suspend the fibers in 1x relaxing solution.",
    "Use 20 µl 1x relaxing solution per DLMs isolated from 2 thoraces.Notes: For a visual guide on the dissection see Xiao et al., 2017. Our home-made dissection pad is casted from silicon glue (black color). It offers a flat, slightly elastic, washable surface. Commercially available vinyl pads can be used instead. Sufficient dissociation is indicated by the disappearance of all the floating visible tissue pieces. Ideally, it is reached during the last washing/re-suspending step. C.  Fixation of the individual muscle fibersPrepare a humidity chamberFor the assembly of the humidity chamber use a non-transparent plastic box with a lid. It protects the samples from light, which is important in handling fluorochromes. Line the bottom of the box with a wet paper towel to increase humidity. Place the lid of a 6-well plate inside the humidity chamber and cover it with a slice of Parafilm. Use it as a clean and flat platform for the coverslips.Prepare a 24 x 24 mm coverslip and place it on the Parafilm.Pipette a 20 µl drop of the myofibril suspension into the middle of the coverslip prior to fixation.Pipette 200 µl fixative solution (see Materials and Reagents) onto the myofibril drop and fix for 15 min at room temperature.Wash three times with 200 µl 1x relaxing solution.Notes: Lid of the humidity chamber must seal properly to protect the samples during the overnight incubation in the refrigerator. Make sure that the samples never fully run dry. Apply normal wash intensity, the myofibrils will remain attached to the coverslip during regular washes. D.  Immunostaining for dSTORM imagingBlock the samples in 200 µl blocking solution (see Recipe 5) for 30 min in a humidity chamber at room temperature.",
    "Add the primary antibodies in blocking solution and incubate in a humidity chamber overnight at 4 °C (see Table 1 for examples).Rinse five times with 200 µl blocking solution.Add the appropriate Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution (1:600, see Materials and Reagents) for 2 h at room temperature. Also add Phalloidin-Alexa488 (1:200, Life Technologies) as an independent marker.Rinse four times with 200 µl blocking solution and once with 200 µl filtered PBS.Keep the samples submerged in filtered PBS at 4 °C in a Petri dish or a 6-well plate, protected from light until dSTORM imaging.Notes: Apply prolonged washing steps if high background is detected during imaging. Use the Phalloidin Alexa488 channel to unequivocally distinguish the H-zone and I-band during data processing. Achieving ideal labeling density is crucial. Multiple primary antibody dilutions must be tested at constant secondary antibody concentration. The starting dilution must be inspected with confocal microscopy before STORM imaging. Depending on the primary antibody, some samples must be processed immediately, while others can be stored for weeks prior to imaging without a significant drop in quality. E.  Sample preparation for dSTORMPrepare dSTORM imaging buffer freshly (see Recipe 6).Put 40 µl dSTORM imaging buffer on the slide, cover it with the coverslip containing your sample, and seal it with twinsil speed silicone.Clean and dry the outer surface of the coverslip if necessary.Place the sample on the microscope stage.F.  dSTORM acquisitionActivate the focus stabilizing system.If the sample is labeled only with Alexa Fluor 647 the ‘Single channel filter set’ must be used, otherwise select the ‘Quad channel filter set’.Use the 647 nm excitation laser at low power (30 mW, 0.06% AOTF and < 10 W/cm2) to select undamaged, straight, and isolated myofibrils (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Selecting myofibrils for dSTORM imaging.",
    "For measurements we select straight myofibril sections that are parallel with the plane of imaging.Adjust the focus and image the central part of the myofibril.Set ROI size to include only the excited region of the sample.Capture and save a snapshot image (Figures 1A and 1C).Close the shutter of the camera.Increase the 647 nm laser power (300 mW 100% AOTF and ≈2.5-3 kW/cm2) to trigger the photo-switching state of the fluorescent dyes. Wait 5-10 seconds and open the shutter to assess blinking of the fluorophores (Video 2).Notes: If there are overlapping molecules because of too dense labeling, bleach the sample for 1 minute by using simultaneously the 647 nm excitation laser at full power (300 mW 100% AOTF and ≈2.5-3 kW/cm2) and the 405 nm laser at moderate power (10 mW, 40% AOTF and ≈20 W/cm2), Repeat this bleaching procedure for multiple times. If blinking is still too dense, a new sample must be prepared with lower labeling density. If there are overlapping molecules because of insufficient excitation power density (and the laser power cannot be further increased), then stop the measurement, reduce the excitation spot size and restart the measurement. If you cannot reduce the beam size then prepare a new sample with lower labeling density. If high background is detected (e.g., IR background when the ‘Single channel filter set’ is used or anti-Stokes fluorescence from the second dye (Gajdos et al., 2020) when the ‘Quad channel filter set’ is used) use the 690/70 emission filter in addition to the LP 647 filter. For more details on the microscope configuration see Szikora et al., 2020.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Examples for ideal and suboptimal labeling density and fluorophore blinking behavior. In an ideal case blinking of the fluorophores should be bright and clearly separated from each other.",
    "In contrast to this, sparse labeling results in too few signals, whereas in case of too dense labeling the signals are not clearly separated from each other. Scale bar: 5 µm.Acquire 20,000-50,000 frames at an exposure time of 20 ms or 30 ms, and with the EM gain set to 100.Note: The exposure time is set based on the blinking properties of the fluorescent dye (camera count and the number of overlapping molecules). Ideally the exposure time equals the ON-state lifetime of a single fluorescence molecule. The number of acquired frames depends on the bleaching ratio and efficiency of the reactivation. Use the 405 nm reactivation laser at any time if necessary at low power (< 1 mW).Repeat the dSTORM acquisition procedure to obtain data for at least 6 regions per sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200616/20200616235320_9284.jpg Figure 1.
