    "All of the procedures performed in this study were approved by the Ethics Review Committee at the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (approval number 2017BZYYL00120).\n1. Preparation and Characterization of Colloidal Gold\nNOTE: For colloidal gold synthesis, as colloidal gold is easily adsorbed on the inner wall of the vessel and is prone to precipitation by impurities, the vessel for synthesis and storage of colloidal gold should be thoroughly cleaned and soaked in acid (40 mL of distilled water, 360 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid, 20 g of potassium dichromate) or subjected to surface passivation treatment. A citric acid reduction method was used to synthesize colloidal gold.\nTurn on the magnetic stirrer and place the flask (250 mL) on the mixer.\nPrepare 4% gold chloride acid solution and 1% sodium citrate solution, respectively.\nAdd 120 mL of distilled water to a round bottom flask and heat it to boiling on a thermostatic magnetic stirrer.\nKeep boiling, and quickly add 0.5 mL of 4% chloroauric acid and 5 mL of 1% sodium citrate.\nObserve the color of the solution. The pale yellow chloroauric acid solution turns wine red within a few minutes.\nContinue heating for 10 minutes, until the solution changes from colorless to transparent wine red.\nTurn off the power of the thermostatic magnetic mixer, cool to room temperature, and move the mixture to a clean bottle. Store it at 4 °C.\nDetermine the size and morphology of the AuNPs by ultraviolet spectroscopy and TEM imaging.\n\t​NOTE: Different sizes of colloid gold particles for various applications can be obtained by changing the proportion of citrate sodium and chloroauric acid.\n2. Synthesis of AuNPs-mAb Conjugate",
    "NOTE: Since antibodies bind to colloidal gold by electrostatic adsorption, charges on the surface of proteins and colloidal gold directly affect the binding intensity; therefore, the buffer pH value is an important factor affecting the stability of the antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. SSD and anti-SSD mAbs are used as examples in this protocol.\nEvaluation of coupling pH\n\t\nAdd 100 μL of NaCl solution (10% m/v) into eight tubes.\nAdjust the AuNP solutions at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 with 0.1 M K2CO3.\nAdd 100 μL of colloidal gold solution (pH adjusted 5-12) to eight tubes containing NaCl.\nAllow the solutions to stand for several minutes after blending. Observe the color change of each tube solution, and record the tube that remains red.\nChoose the pH value with the least addition of K2CO3 and stable solution color as the optimum pH value for preparing AuNP-mAb conjugates.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not use a pH meter because the probe may be destroyed by AuNPs.\nEvaluation of antibody amount\n\t\nAdd 100 μL of NaCl solution (10% m/v) to eight tubes.\nAdd 100 μL of colloidal gold solution with optimum pH to each tube.\nAdd the monoclonal antibody solutions (protein concentration 0.1 mg/mL-3.2 mg/mL) to the abovementioned eight tubes.\nAllow the solutions to stand for several minutes after blending. Observe the color change of each tube solution, and record the tube that remains red.\nChoose the antibody amount with the lowest concentration of mAb and stable solution color as the optimum mAb amount for preparing AuNP-mAb conjugates.\nPrepare the resuspension buffer: add 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (v/v) PEG 20000 and blend well.\nSynthesis of AuNP-mAb conjugate",
    "Take 10 mL of colloidal gold solution and use 0.1 M K2CO3 to adjust the solution to the optimal pH value.\nSlowly add SSD mAbs at appropriate concentrations and shake at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 83 x g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the precipitate, which contains impurities or precipitated colloidal gold.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 8,330 x g (10,000 rpm) for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, and the precipitate is the colloidal gold-mAb conjugate.\nAdd the resuspension buffer to dissociate the precipitation.\n3. Assembly of the Strip\nNOTE: For later flow immunoassays, the selection and pretreatment of membrane material will directly affect the test, which should be investigated. The immunochromatographic strip consists of a sample pad, a conjugate pad, a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane, an absorbent pad and a PVC board (Figure 1). The membrane material should be checked and evaluated by stereomicroscopy to eliminate inhomogeneity.\nPaste the NC membrane on a PVC board 2 cm apart from the edge of the suction end of the board.\nAdd SSD-BSA (2 mg/mL) dropwise to the NC membrane (2 cm apart from the upper edge) as a test line (1 mm wide), and add goat anti-mouse IgG (1.5 mg/mL) dropwise on the NC membrane (2 cm apart from the lower edge) as a control line (1 mm wide). Control the amount of protein added.\nAttach the absorbent pad to the PVC sheet above the NC membrane and overlap it with the NC membrane by 2 mm.\nSubmerge the glass fiber membrane into the AuNPs-mAb conjugate solution. Dry the wet membrane in an incubator at 37 °C.\nTrim the glass fiber membrane to 5 cm long and 2 cm wide and use it as a conjugate pad.",
    "Paste the pretreated conjugate pad under the NC membrane. The length of overlap with the NC membrane should be 0.1 cm.\n\tNOTE: The glass fiber membrane has a strong ability to bind and release proteins.\nTrim the fusion 3 membrane to 1.8 cm long and 3.5 cm wide and use it as the sample pad.\nPaste the sample pad on the PVC board and overlap it with the conjugate pad by 2 mm.\nCut the assembled paper board into 3.5-mm-wide strips using a cutting machine and compact it using a batch lamination system.\nFinally, place the test strips into the shell, seal them in an aluminum foil bag containing desiccant, and store them away from light. The ICSs are now assembled.\n\t​NOTE: The above is the laboratory procedure. In production, gold spraying equipment and cross-membrane instruments are used to spray gold and make the T and C lines.\n4. Quantitative Detection\nDrop 50 µL of sample solution onto the sample hole to observe the chromatography process.\n\tNOTE: As a result of the capillary action driven by the absorbent pad, the sample solution migrates to the other end of the strip. When the sample solution reaches the conjugate pad, the SSD (antigen) in the sample reacts with the AuNPs-mAb preloaded on the pad. When the solution migrates and reaches the T-line, the AuNPs-mAb without SSD can be selectively captured by SSD-BSA (antigen-carrier protein conjugate), showing as a red color on the T-line. Then, the solution migrates to the C line, where the AuNPs-mAb are captured by goat anti-mouse IgG in the region, thus showing as a red color on the C line.\nAnalyze the strips with a portable strip reader. The machine can provide the ratio of the test line to the control line (T/C).",
    "Evaluate the specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and stability of the ICS test.\n\tNOTE: Under qualitative detection, one red line indicates a positive result (control line). Two red lines indicate a negative result (test and control lines). If the control line is not present, the test is considered invalid.\nSubscription Required.
