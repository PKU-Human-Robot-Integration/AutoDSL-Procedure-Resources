    "Animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Principles of Laboratory Animals, prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, and published by the National Institutes of Health. All animal protocols were approved by the responsible local authority (''Amt für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hansestadt (Office for Health and Consumer Protection) Hamburg'').\n1. Catheter Preparation\nNOTE: Refer to the Table of Materials for information regarding the catheter.\nTake catheter from the catheter holder.\nPull the guidewire from the lumen through the distal port out.\nPut in a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive on the distal end of catheter.\n\tCaution: Wear latex or nitrile gloves.\nPlace the guidewire at the RX port of the catheter and advance it through the lumen to the distal port. Afterwards, pull the guidewire back slightly to leave a space of ~5 mm to the end.\nWait 5 min to allow the adhesive to dry.\nMove the guidewire, it should be fixed. If it is still mobile, repeat steps 1.3 - 1.6.\nFill a 3-mL syringe with 1.5 mL 0.9% saline and connect it to the balloon inflation port.\nPush the syringe plunger to test balloon inflation. Leave 0.6 mL saline in the syringe.\n2. Mouse preparation\nObtain male mice at the age of 14 weeks weighing approximately 30 g.\n\tNOTE: We used animals obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animals. We used C57BL/6J here.\nUse an induction chamber to anaesthetize the mouse with 2.0-2.5% isofurane (500 mL/min oxygen flow rate).\nPlace the mouse on its back on a heating pad and maintain anesthesia with a facemask covering the mouth and nose of the mouse. Check for sufficient depth of anesthesia by pinching the hind feet and tail to verify an absence of reflexes.\nRemove the abdominal hair using a hair trimmer.",
    "Spread the hind legs and fix their position using tape.\nDisinfect the abdominal area using povidone-iodine, followed by 80% ethanol. Repeat this step two more times.\nUse a surgical drape to ensure surgical site does not get contaminated. Open the skin and muscle layers along the linea alba with a scissor (or scalpel) to expose the abdominal organs.\nLay the intestines in a 0.9% saline moisturized glove and wrap to keep them moist.\nUse two fine forceps to remove the fatty tissue above the abdominal aorta.\nUsing an insulin syringe (30G), inject 250 µL of heparin solution (50 U/mL) into the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) and wait 3 min for its systemic distribution. Heparin will suppress hemostasis and prevent undesired clotting during surgery.\nUsing two forceps, dissect the infrarenal aorta down to its bifurcation and its outgoing branch vessels.\nLigate the side vessels, which are expected to be placed in the clamped area, with a high temperature cauterizer.\nStop blood flow by clamping the infrarenal aorta directly beneath the renal arteries.\nPlace a second clamp at a distal position just above the aortic bifurcation.\nPerform a small horizontal incision using scissors at the midpoint between the clamps along the vessel.\n\tNOTE: The size of the incision should be equivalent to 1/3 of the circumference of the vessel.\nInsert a syringe with a (30G) needle into the incision and flush the aorta with 250 µL heparin solution (50 U/mL).\nUsing 10-0 sutures, place one single knot on each side of the incision.\nDilate the aorta by inserting a vessel dilator into the incision and spread the vessel slightly. Repeat the dilation 2 to 3 times.\nMoisturize the balloon-catheter with 0.9% saline.\nInsert the flattened balloon-catheter into the aorta and advance it towards the proximal clamp on the aorta.",
    "When reaching the proximal clamp, carefully open the proximal clamp and inflate the balloon to prevent blood leakage, by injecting ~0.6 mL of saline.\n\tNOTE: The ratio of the inflated balloon to vessel is 1.5:1.\nAdvance the catheter retrograde for approximately 2 cm.\nPull the expanded catheter back, while deflating the balloon slightly by releasing the syringe.\nReattach the proximal clamp when the catheter reaches the incision of the aorta. Deflate the balloon completely and remove it.\nRinse the aorta with 250 µL heparin solution (50 U/mL) using a 30G syringe.\nClose the aortic incision using 10-0 sutures. Place interrupted stitches on each lateral side, followed by one or two stitches on the ventral side.\nOpen the distal clamp. In case of bleeding, close the clamp again and place additional stitches.\nOpen the proximal clamp carefully.\nPlace two swabs on the suture to support it and stop any bleeding.\nPlace absorbable hemostats on the suture to sustain it.\n\tNOTE: An aortic pulse should be visible distally from the incision.\nPlace the intestines back into the abdomen.\nRinse the abdominal cavity with sterile 0.9% saline, which has been pre-warmed to 37 °C.\nClose the abdominal muscle layer using 6-0 running sutures.\nClose the skin with 5-0 running sutures.\nInject 4-5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously before allowing the mouse to wake up. Monitor the animal until it has gained consciousness, maintain sternal recumbency. Keep the animal alone in a cage until complete recovery.\nAdd Metamizole to the drinking water (50 mg/100 mL) as pain medication for 3 days and monitor the animal daily. Usually mice like the sweet taste of metamizole and start drinking immediately after the surgery. If preferred, sustained-release injectable agents can be used instead of metamizole.\n\tNOTE: The observation period for this model is 28 days.\n3. Histopathology",
    "Harvest the balloon-injured aorta after 28 days by preparing the mice as described in steps 2.2 to 2.9.\nUse scissors to remove the balloon-injured aorta (between the bifurcation and 0.3 mm above the renal vessels) and euthanize the mouse by cutting out its heart.\nFlush the lumen of the vessel with 0.9% NaCl.\nFix the harvested vessel in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight and dehydrate it in increasing concentrations of ethanol, starting with 70% ethanol for 2 hours, 80% ethanol for 1 hour, 95% ethanol for 2 hours, and 100% ethanol for 5 hours. Then, incubate the samples in xylene for 2 hours 3 times, before infiltrating the samples with paraffin.\n\tNOTE: Instead of flushing the harvested vessel with 0.9% NaCl, it can be flushed with 4% PFA.\n\tCaution: PFA and xylene are toxic and should be handled with special care.\nEmbed the sample in paraffin and cut into slices of 5 µm thickness using a microtome.\nDeparaffinize the slides with xylene 3 times for 5 minutes.\nRehydrate tissue slides using a decreasing series of ethanol. Start with 100% ethanol 2 times for 5 min, followed by 3 minutes of 95%, 80% and 70% ethanol.\nStain the slides with Masson's trichrome staining as described18.\nDehydrate stained slides in 100% ethanol 2 times for 10 min each. Clear with xylene 2 times for 10 min each and mount in mounting medium.\nView the slides with a bright field microscope. Use a lens with 5x magnification and a numerical aperture of 0.12 for an overview picture or a lens with 20x magnifications with a numerical aperture of 0.35 for detailed observation.\n4. Immunofluorescence Microscopy\nRehydrate tissue slides using a decreasing series of ethanol. Start with 100% ethanol 2 times for 5 min, followed by 3 min of 95%, 80% and 70% ethanol.",
    "Perform antigen-retrieval by heating the slides in antigen-retrieval solution in a steamer for 20 min.\nLet the slides cool down to room temperature.\nAfter washing the slides for three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), apply antigen blocking solution on sections for 30 min.\nWash slides three times for 5 min with PBS.\nIncubate sections with primary antibody diluted in primary antibody diluent.\n\tNOTE: The right concentration and incubation time should be chosen separately for each antibody.\nWash slides three times for 5 min with PBS to remove unbound antibody.\nIncubate sections with a pre-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in secondary antibody diluent.\n\tNOTE: The right concentration and incubation time should be chosen separately for each antibody.\nRemove unbound antibodies by washing the slides for 5 min three times.\nCounterstain the cell nuclei using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min; the final DAPI concentration should be 350 nM.\nMount slides in immunofluorescence compatible mounting solution.\n\tNOTE: Using the wrong mounting solution can obscure the fluorescence signal.\nView slides with a fluorescence microscope. Use a 40x magnification lens with a numerical aperture of 1.3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
