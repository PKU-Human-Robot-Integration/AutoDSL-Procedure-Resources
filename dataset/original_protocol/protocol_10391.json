    "Note: The photomask designs for our microfluidic device fabrication were drawn by using a computer aided design (CAD) software. The designs were then utilized to fabricate chrome photomasks using a commercial service. The PDMS devices were made using soft lithography techniques.11\n1. Fabrication of Master Molds by Lithography\nBefore the photolithography process12, use the 4-inch silicon wafers as a substrate and dehydrate the wafers in a conventional oven at 120 °C for 10 min.\nClean the dehydrated silicon wafers by using oxygen plasma treatment at 100 watts for 30 sec in a plasma cleaner.\nPreheat two hotplates at 65 °C and 95 °C, respectively, for the following baking process.\nCoat 5 g of negative photoresist (PR) on the cleaned silicon wafers by a spin coater; spin at 1,200 rpm (SU-8 50) for 30 sec to produce the microchannel layer.\nPlace the PR coated wafer on a preheated hotplate at 65 °C for 12 min and transfer it to another preheated hotplate at 95 °C for 33 min (for 100 µm thick patterns) to perform a soft bake process.\nAfter baking, place the PR coated silicon wafer on the holder of a semi-automated mask aligner and align it to a 25,400 dpi resolution transparency photomask.\nExpose the PR coated silicon wafer to UV light (365 nm) at a dose of 500 mJ/cm2 to create the PR pattern on the silicon wafer.\nRemove the wafer from the aligner and place it on a hotplate for post-baking at 95 °C for 12 min.\nSoak the wafers in SU-8 developer (propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, PGMEA) solution to wash off uncrosslinked PR for 12 min and gently dry with nitrogen gas to expose the alignment marks.",
    "Again, coat 5 g of negative photoresist on the wafers by a spin coater; spin at 700 rpm (SU-8 100) for 30 sec and 1,200 rpm (SU-8 10) for 30 sec for 300 µm thick pattern and 27 µm thick pattern respectively to make the microwell layer.\nPlace the PR coated wafer on a hotplate at 65 °C for 4 min and at 95 °C for 8 min (for 27 µm deep capture-well layer); and at 65 °C for 40 min and at 95 °C for 110 min (for 300 µm deep culture-well layer).\nAfter cooling, place the PR coated silicon wafer on the mask aligner equipped with UV light.\nExpose the PR coated silicon wafer to the UV light (365 nm) at a dose of 250 mJ/cm2 (for 27 µm thick pattern) and 700 mJ/cm2 (for 300 µm thick pattern).\nBake the wafers at 95 °C for 5 min (27 µm thick pattern) and 30 min (300 µm thick pattern), respectively.\nWash off the uncrosslinked PR by the PGMEA for 6 min (27 µm thick pattern) and 25 min (300 µm thick pattern), respectively, and then dry them with nitrogen gas.\nMeasure the height of pattern features on the wafer with a scanning laser profilometer by placing the wafer on the xy-stage of a scanning laser profilometer.\n\t\nAdjust the focal plane to clearly show the pattern features on the wafer by using the \"camera view\" observation mode under a 20X objective lens.\nSwitch the observation mode from \"camera view\" to \"laser view\", and set the upper and lower positions of the features.\nSet the measurement mode, area, quality, and z-pitch up to transparent (top), 1 line (1,024 x 1), high-accuracy and 0.5 µm, respectively, and then press the start bottom to begin the measurement.",
    "2. Preparation of PDMS Devices for Single-cell Isolation\nBefore PDMS casting, silanize the master molds with trichlorosilane to create a hydrophobic surface, which makes it easier to peel off the PDMS replicas from the master molds.\n\t\nPlace the master molds and a weighting boat containing 200 µl of trichlorosilane in a desiccator, and apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min.\nStop the vacuum and then leave the master molds in the desiccator to silanize the master molds at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\nRemove the master molds from the desiccator and place each master mold in a 10 cm Petri dish.\nMix a total amount of 17.6 g PDMS polymer kit containing a base and a curing agent at a ratio of 10:1, and then pour the PDMS onto the master mold in the Petri dish.\nPlace the Petri dish in a desiccator and apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 1 hr to remove air bubbles in the PDMS.\nRemove the Petri dish from the desiccator and place it in a conventional oven at 65 °C for 3 - 6 hr to cure the PDMS.\nRemove the cured PDMS replicas from the master molds and punch two holes as an inlet and an outlet at the two ends of the microchannel on the capture-well array PDMS replica by a puncher with inner-diameter of 0.75 mm for the fluidic channel (Figure 2A).\nUse tape to clean the surface of the PDMS replicas, and then place the PDMS replicas in a plasma cleaner for brief oxygen plasma treatment (100 watts for 14 sec).\nRemove the PDMS replicas from the oxygen plasma machine.\nAlign a top (containing the capture microwells) and a bottom PDMS (containing the culture microwells) replica by hand under a stereomicroscope and bring them into contact.",
    "Place the aligned PDMS replicas in an oven at 65 °C for 24 hr to achieve permanent bonding between the PDMS replicas to form the final device.\nSoak the PDMS device in a deionized (DI)-water filled container and place the container in a desiccator under vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min to remove air from the microchannel of the PDMS device.\nPlace the DI water-filled PDMS device in a tissue culture hood and use UV light (wavelength of light: 254 nm) to sterilize of the device for 30 min.\nReplace the DI water in the PDMS device with a 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x PBS solution and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to prevent cells from sticking to the PDMS surface.\n\tNote: The BSA coating is critical to improve the transfer efficiency of isolated cells from capture-well to culture-well.\nReplace the 5% BSA solution in the PDMS device with sterilized 1x PBS solution.\n3. Preparation of Single-cell Suspension\nCulture Neural stem cell KT98, and human carcinoma cell A549 and MDA-MB-435 we in Petri dish in conventional cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity) to prepare cells for the PDMS device cell experiment.\nRemove and discard the spent culture medium (DMEM basal medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics) from the culture dish with cells grown to 70 - 80% confluence.\nGently wash the cells with sterilized PBS three times.\nRemove and discard the PBS, and add 2 ml of a recombinant enzyme mixture with proteolytic, collagenolytic, and DNase activities (please see the Materials List for the detailed information).\nIncubate the culture dish at room temperature for 5 min, and then tap the culture dish to facilitate cell detachment.",
    "Add 4 ml of sterilized PBS to disperse cells, and then transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 3 min and remove the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml sterilized PBS and count the live cell number using the standard Trypan Blue exclusion method13.\n\tNote: This resuspension step is critical for preparing well-dissociated single-cell suspension to improve the single-cell isolation efficiency.\n4. Single-cell Isolation and Clonal Culture\nLoad 50 µl of cell suspension at a concentration of 2.2 - 2.5 x106 cells/ml into the microchannel of the PDMS device via the device's outlet hole with a handheld pipette.\n\tNote: The cell suspension loading pipette needs to be stopped and held at the first stop position to avoid introducing air bubbles into the microchannel.\nLoad another 50 µl of cell suspension through the inlet hole to evenly fill up the whole microchannel with cells.\nSeal the outlet hole with a plug (a 3 mm long, 1 mm diameter cut nylon fishing line) to avoid flow induced by hydrostatic pressure from the droplets on inlet and outlet holes.\n\tNote: The plugs were UV sterilized inside a tissue culture hood prior to use.\nFill up a 1 ml sterile syringe with culture medium, eject air bubbles from it, and set it up on a syringe pump.\nConnect the medium loaded syringe to the inlet hole of the PDMS device via a 23 G blunt needle and a poly-tetrafluoroethene (PTFE) tubing.\nRemove the plug from outlet hole and allow a 2-min time interval to allow the cells to settle into the single-cell capture-wells by gravitational force.\nWash away the uncaptured cells with 300 µl of culture medium at a flow rate of 600 µl/min driven by the syringe pump.",
    "Wait for 2 min to stabilize the device, and seal the inlet and outlet holes with plugs to form a closed culture system.\nFlip the device by hand to transfer the captured single-cells to the culture microwells.\nPlace the PDMS device in a 100-mm tissue culture dish, and add 10 ml of sterilized PBS around the device to avoid culture medium evaporation from the microchannel.\nMove the culture dish to a conventional cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity) for clonal culture of the single-cells.\n5. Culture Medium Replenishment\nAfter 1 d of culture, replace the culture medium in the PDMS device with fresh medium to improve cell proliferation.\nPlace two droplets of culture medium on top of the PDMS device near the inlet and outlet holes areas to avoid introducing air bubbles into the microchannel while performing the next step.\nPunch two holes from the top of the PDMS device near the two ends of the microchannel as an inlet and an outlet for the microchannel.\n\tNote: Do not punch through the whole two layers of the PDMS device; instead, just punch through the top layer of the PDMS.\nConnect a 1 ml plastic syringe containing fresh medium to the inlet via a 23 G blunt needle and PTFE tubing.\nFlow 120 µl fresh medium into the device for 5 min to replace the old medium.\nInsert two plugs to seal the inlet and outlet holes, and return the device to the cell culture incubator.\nRefresh the culture medium every 2 d during the period of culture by removing the sealing plugs, followed by repeating steps 5.4 to 5.5.\nSubscription Required.
