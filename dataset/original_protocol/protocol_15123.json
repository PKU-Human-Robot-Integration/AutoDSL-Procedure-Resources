    "Because it is impractical to test for frailty in all patients attending an HIV clinic we recommend the following patients be assessed for the presence of frailty: patients entering care with a CD4 cell count <200, patients complaining of unintentional weight loss, severe neuropathy or patients who are not compliant with HIV therapy.\nObtain verbal consent of the patient to undergo tests for frailty or \"weakness\". Consent need not be written since everything that is performed is part of a normal physical examination.\nPerform a Mini-Cog test if the patient appears confused or apathetic.\n\t\nInstruct the patient to listen carefully to, and remember 3 unrelated words. The examiner states the three words out loud.\nInstruct the patient to draw the face of a clock, either on a blank sheet of paper or on a sheet with the clock circle already drawn on the page. After the patient puts the numbers on the clock face, ask him or her to draw the hands of the clock to read a specific time.\nAsk the patient to repeat the 3 previously stated words. Give 1 point for each recalled word. Patients recalling none of the three words are classified as cognitively impaired (Score = 0). Patients recalling all three words are classified as cognitively intact (Score = 3) Patients with intermediate word recall of 1-2 words are classified based on the clock draw test (Abnormal = impaired; Normal = intact).\nIf the patient fails the Mini-Cog, the clinician should examine further for causes of confusion and/or delirium. Testing for frailty would not be appropriate at this time.\nWeigh patient and assess for weight loss. Someone who is frail may have unintentional weight loss of â‰¥ 10 pounds in the prior year.",
    "Time a patient's walk for slowness. Someone who is frail has a decreased walking time as defined by a timed 15-foot walk test. The time is adjusted for gender and standing height. Men with a height of <173 cm and women with a height <159 cm who walked 15 feet in >7 sec are considered frail; men >173 cm and women >159 cm who walked 15 feet in >6 sec are considered frail.\nDetermine if the patient has weakness. Weakness is established when there is decreased grip strength measured by a dynamometer with the value adjusted for gender and body mass index (BMI). Men with a BMI <24 are considered frail if the grip strength (kg) is <29, for a BMI of 24.1-28, a man is frail if <30, for a BMI >28 a man is frail if <32. For women, a BMI of <23 is considered frail if the grip strength (kg) is <17, a BMI 23.1-26 is considered frail if <17.3, a BMI of 26.1-29 is considered frail if <18, and a BMI >29 is considered frail if <21.\nDetermine if the patient has a low physical activity level. This is established by a weighted score of kilocalories expended per week measured by the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire. The questionnaire asks about activities like daily living, sports and hobbies. Frailty is present when males use <383kcal/week, and females <270 kcal/week.12",
    "Determine if the patient shows evidence of exhaustion. This is self-reported by answering 2 questions from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.13 The questions asked are: How often in the last week did you feel: (a) that everything I did was an effort?; or (b) I could not get going? Answers were: 0 = less than 1 day, 1 = 1-2 days, 2 = 3-4 days, 3 = most of the time. Answering 2 or 3 to either of these questions is a positive criterion for frailty.14"
