    "Ussing chamber electrode preparationChloriding silver wiresThe barrel end of the fitting is female and threaded to accept male-threaded Ag/AgCl (voltage) electrodes, and Ag wire (current) electrodes. Note that Ag wire electrodes can also be used as voltage electrodes, but the AgCl pellet electrodes can only be used as voltage electrodes. Make plenty of spare electrodes, in case they fail during the course of an experiment.Clean the wire electrode with 100% ethanol.To remove old chloride coating, quickly pass the wire through a flame. Be careful not to melt the plastic fitting. A properly flamed wire will be bright silver in color.To chloride the Ag wire, place ~20 mL of fresh full strength common household bleach (Clorox) into a 50 mL plastic tube and immerse the wire for 15 to 30 min, until a purple-gray color is observed. Rinse by dipping the wire into a tube with distilled water, and shake dry before electrode assembly. If the wire does not look uniformly gray/purple, or fails in the ohm-meter test, clean it using ultrafine sandpaper (600 grit), and re-process.AgCl pellet electrodes do not require bleach treatment but, if they become corroded, gently sand them with ultrafine sandpaper, and then rinse with distilled water.Bridge fittings and filling with agarPrepare the agar bridge solution (see Recipes) so that it is melted and at ~65–75°C.The electrode bridge fittings are modified gel loading micropipette tips with a Luer-taper that match the insertion ports (ports 2 and 3, in Figure 1) of the Ussing chamber.Cut the top portion of the tip off, so that the adapter fitting fits snugly into the top of the tip (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4359/bioprotoc-12-06-4359-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Shown are two Ag wire electrodes, one is cleaned (top) the other is fully chlorided (bottom). B. Ag pellet electrode. C. Tip preparation. Diagonal lines indicate the position and orientation to cut the tips with a safety razor blade. The top is cut so that the tips fit well into the electrode adapters, the bottom is cut after the electrodes are filled by agar and assembled. D. Fully assembled electrodes. Scale bar: 3 cm.Fill a 1 mL syringe with approximately 0.4 mL of melted agar solution.Slowly inject the agar/KCl solution into the tip of a bridge fitting, making sure that the tip and fitting are completely filled and that no air bubbles form.Attach the electrodes to the fittings and screw them into place. Allow the solution to cool and solidify within the fittings. The agar solution will properly encapsulate the Ag/AgCl pellet or Ag wire during solidification.After cooling and solidifying, cut the bottom portion of the tips at a 45° angle, to expose the largest possible tip area to the membrane.Testing electrodesConnect the positive terminal (VΩmA) of the volt-ohm-meter to a copper wire in a 50 mL tube containing Ringer’s Saline buffer (Figure 3).Connect the electrode to be tested to the common (com) terminal, which is then placed into the Ringer's Saline buffer. Place only the tip of the electrode under the surface of the buffer, without completely submerging the electrode.Set the ohm-meter to 20KΩ. The resistance should settle to a positive value within a minute or so. If the reading is negative or shows a \"1\" with no decimal places, the electrode is faulty and should not be reassembled.Keep spare electrodes in Ringer's Saline (at room temperature) when not in use during the experiment.Disassemble the electrodes upon completion of the experiment.",
    "Pellet electrodes become easily corroded and can crumble, so it is important that they be cleaned, by thorough rinsing in distilled water, and carefully dried.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4359/bioprotoc-12-06-4359-g003.jpgFigure 3. Testing electrodes. A. Schematic of the electrode testing apparatus.

Remove the entire mesentery as soon as possible following euthanasia.Pin the mouse on a dissecting board, and sterilize it using 70% ethanol in water.Use surgical dissecting scissors to make an incision in the skin, starting just below the sternum. Continue cutting along the midline to the pelvis. Then make transverse cuts on both sides, and pin the skin to the dissecting board.Use forceps to grasp the abdominal wall, and cut it open with surgical scissors.Gently elevate the intestines out of the abdominal cavity, and close with a suture just above the rectum and below the stomach, to avoid leakage.Cut the intestines just past the suture sites. Rinse with Ringer’s Saline buffer.Transfer to a Petri dish containing an elastomer dissection pad wetted with cold Ringer’s Saline buffer and pin the ends of the jejunum to form a circle, spreading the jejunal arcade, allowing easier visualization and isolation of the individual vessel branches (Figure 4A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4359/bioprotoc-12-06-4359-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "Magnified image illustrating the 5th order artery selected for cannulation after removal of the adipose tissue, veins, lymphatic vessels, and connective tissue. Figure 3A and 3C were provided by Perenkita Mendiola at the Dept. of Cell Biology and Physiology, Univ. of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, and used with permission (Wenceslau et al., 2021). Figure 3B is used with permission from         Sabine et al. (2018)        .Use a 10× dissecting microscope to identify the arterioles and venules within the tissue. Both have a clear lumen.Because they are surrounded by vascular smooth muscle, arterioles are smooth walled and more rigid than venules. Lymphatics tend to be more opaque and have more frequent and prominent valves than venules (Figure 4B).Vessel identity can be further verified using markers for arterioles (GJA5) or venules (CLDN11) by Q-RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry (Buschmann et al., 2010; Maier-Begandt et al., 2021).Remove irrelevant tissues to reveal the vessels of interest (Figure 4).Remove 2nd and 3rd order arteries or veins 2–3 mm in length and with diameters of 100 μm or less, then cut longitudinally, and transfer to a 35 mm tissue culture dish containing Ringer’s Saline buffer.At this point, the isolated vessels are ready for mounting into the Ussing chamber. Both veins and arteries can be analyzed using this approach.Alternatively, vessels can be pretreated with different agents or cytokines prior to mounting in the Ussing chamber.Place freshly isolated vessels into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 800 μL of Ringer’s Saline buffer, containing either TNFα (50 ng/mL) or control vehicle 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) pre-warmed to 37°C.Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, while rocking on a nutating platform.Mount the vessels into the Ussing chamber.Ussing chamber assemblyPreliminary chamber preparationMake sure that you have enough Ringer's Saline buffer and that it is pre-warmed to 37°C.",
    "Approximately 36 mL of buffer will be required for initial filling of the chamber assembly. Additional volume will be required to replace fluid lost through normal evaporation, as well as any fluid removed for sampling or buffer exchange during the course of the experiment.Lightly coat the O-ring seals on the inner chamber with vacuum grease (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4359/bioprotoc-12-06-4359-g005.jpgFigure 5. Ussing chamber apparatus. A. Exploded view, used with permission from Warner Instruments, ©2022. B. Photograph showing a fully assembled and connected Ussing chamber.Connect the water circulation source to the chamber, and turn on the circulation bath. Begin water circulation to bring the chamber to the desired operating temperature (usually 15–30 min).Loosely assemble the two half-cells on the chamber base using the two clamp screws, so that there is sufficient clearance for insertion of the cartridge.Insert all electrode bridge fittings into their respective ports. Push gently until they are seated against the internal stops. Make sure that the voltage/clamp apparatus is set to \"zero\", and connect the 2 mm pins of the electrodes directly to the headstage of the voltage clamp. Make sure that V1 and I1 are connected to the same side of the chamber, as well as V2 and I2 (see Figures 1 and 5).Make sure that the 2-way stopcock valves in the drain ports are closed, by turning the handles to a position that is perpendicular to the valve body. After completion of the experiment, these ports provide a convenient way of draining the buffer from the chambers before separating the two halves.Vessel mounting and chamber assemblyOrient a vessel between the two halves of a tissue cassette (Figure 6). Use a light coating of vacuum grease in areas surrounding the tissue, to provide a tight seal. Keep track of apical/basolateral orientation. Vessels are slightly curved.",
    "When placed on a surface with the concave orientation upwards, the apical direction is on top.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4359/bioprotoc-12-06-4359-g006.jpgFigure 6.

Arrow indicates the horizontal opening of the cassette in the photograph. Scale bar, 1 cm. C–D. Magnified image of the cassette showing the opening with an approximate area of 0.26 mm2 (red line; C), which can be completely covered with a longitudinally sectioned vessel (border of the vein marked in blue; D). Scale bars, 750 μm (C) and 650 μm (D). Numerical marks in C and D reflect eyepiece magnification. Figures B-D are from           Maier-Begandt et al. (2021)          , used with permission.Seal the cassettes by surrounding them with a gasket made from parafilm. If the tissue cassettes leak or result in short circuit measurements, apply a thin film of vacuum grease on the inside surface before assembling them.Place the cartridge inserts into the loosely assembled chamber halves (Figure 4). Note that the large hole is on the bottom and will align with the center of the chamber when inserted. After inserting the cartridges, securely tighten the screw clamps, but do not over-tighten. The clamps must be equally tightened for the O-rings to seat properly on the sides of the cartridge inserts. If misaligned or improperly tightened, the chamber will leak. Visually observe the size of the gaps on each side of the chamber halves, and adjust the clamp screws to make this gap spacing equal.Equilibrate the chamber for 5–10 min with Ringer’s Saline solution at 37°C, using a temperature-controlled water bath. Solutions are aerated during the course of the experiment with a 5% CO2/95% O2 medical-grade gas mixture.",
    "Connect the leads from the Ussing chamber to the Multichannel Voltage/Current Clamp controller.Electrophysiological measurementsCalibrationSwitch the FUNCTION to OPEN and switch the METER to voltage (V). The voltage reading reflects all of the asymmetries in the system. To compensate for this, if it does not equal zero, place the OFFSET switch in either the plus or minus position, and adjust the OFFSET control knob until the voltage reads 0.00 on the meter.Set the fluid resistance compensation (FLUID RES COMP) to 0.0.Switch the METER to current (I) and press and hold the PUSH TO ADJ test button. The current should be 60–68 μAmps on the meter. If it is not, adjust the FLUID RES COMP until it falls in range.Set MODE to remote (REM), and control the voltage/current clamp apparatus with the Acquire & Analyze software.Calibration only needs to be done once per Ussing chamber session, unless electrodes need to be changed.TEER and Isc measurementsTo measure voltage potential (mV), clamp the current to 0 μA and then collect 2 min of equilibrium data. A sustained consistent voltage measurement is an indication that the system and sample are working properly. If the system does not provide a voltage measurement, this is an indication that one or more electrodes are not functioning and should be replaced.To measure resistance (Ohm), clamp (set) the voltage at 20 mV, period =10.0 s, duration =0.30 s, and polarity to plus (+). Collect data for at least 10 min, making sure the measurement has reached an equilibrium state. Multiply resistance times area to obtain transendothelial resistance (TEER; Ohm × cm2), as described below. TEER values should be greater than zero; if they are not, then the tissue sample is compromised and should be replaced.",
    "To measure short circuit current (Isc; μA), clamp the voltage to 0 mV, then collect 10 min of equilibrium data.Dilution potential measurementsMeasure the voltage potential (mV) in Ringer’s Saline, by clamping the current to 0 μA, and collecting 10 min of equilibrium data.Replace the Ringer’s Saline in the apical side of the chamber with pre-warmed Diluted Ringer’s Saline/Mannitol (1:4).Measure the voltage potential (mV) with current clamped to 0 μA, and then collect 10 min of equilibrium data.Calculate the Dilution Potential (VDP; mV) as described below.Measurements in Ringer’s Lysine-Cl (optional)Replace both chambers with pre-warmed Ringer’s Lysine-Cl.Measure the voltage potential with current clamped to 0 μA, as described above.Measurements in Ringer’s Na-Aspartate (optional)Replace both chambers with pre-warmed Ringer’s Na-Aspartate.Measure the voltage potential with current clamped to 0 μA, as described above."
