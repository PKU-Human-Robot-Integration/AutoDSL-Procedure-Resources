  "procedures": [
    "The study protocol, including human serum sample use, was approved by the Ethics Committee, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. All participants offered written informed consent, either independently or via their parents (in the case of children). The protocol has been registered online (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Reg No.: ChiCTR-DCC-13004003, refer to http://www.chictr.org/cn/).\n1. Identification of the Study Population\nNOTE: The Allergy Information Repository of State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease (AIR-SKLRD) is the primary source of patient recruitment, because AIR is the most well-documented large database of patients for allergen tests in southern China9,10. AIR has been storing serum samples of patients for nearly a decade. Briefly, these stored samples were previously prepared by centrifuging 5 mL of phlebotomized venous blood for 10 min at 3,000 x g and recovering the supernatant. The serum samples were placed in -80 °C refrigerators for long-term storage. Samples that met patient inclusion criteria were ready to use for all testing in the present study.\nFrom the AIR database, retrieve data about patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma who underwent serum tests for grass allergen sIgE between January 2013 and June 2015, the pre-designed study period.\nSelect patients with mild to moderate allergic rhinitis and/or asthma according to the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)11 and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)12 guidelines. Assign them as the \"study group.\"\nExclude patients with incomplete medical records, those lost to follow up, those who refuse to give informed consent regarding the use of their serum samples for scientific purposes, those with identified immunodeficiency, those currently on immunotherapy or immunomodulatory agents, or those found to have parasitic infections.",
    "Select a contemporary cohort of patients with non-respiratory allergies (i.e., eczema, allergic dermatitis, and food allergy) according to the same exclusion criteria and assign them as the \"control group.\"\nMake sure that the serum samples were collected before any prescriptions or treatments were given to minimize confounding effects on the laboratory findings. Exclude any serum sample not fulfilling this requirement.\nMake sure that all subjects are permanent residents from all parts of Greater Guangzhou (i.e., born or have lived there for more than 10 years).\n2. Study Flow and Measurements of Interest\nRetrieve the serum samples of eligible patients from the bio-bank. To test an allergen/allergen component, use 140 µL of serum (including 100 µL to fill up the dead space).\n\tNOTE: The maximum total serum volume needed for each patient in this study is: 3 specific allergens and 8 allergen components, sIgE = 140 µL * 11 = 1,540 µL.\nWhen using this instrument, primarily test the serum samples for sIgEs to whole allergens of Bermuda grass, Timothy grass, and Humulus scandens. Follow the instructions in Section 3.\n\tNOTE: These pollens were selected for the measurements because Bermuda grass13,14,15 and Humulus scandens16 have been widely reported in China, while Timothy grass17,18,19 is a typical plant species that lives in environments ranging from tropical to temperate zones and is most-studied worldwide.\nSecondarily, test the serum samples identified in step 2.3 to have sIgEs to whole allergens for the presence of sIgEs to allergen components of Bermuda [Cyn d 1 (g216)], Timothy [Phlp 1 (g205), Phl p 4 (g208), Phl p 5 (g215), Phl p 6 (g209), Phl p 7 (g210), Phl p 11 (g211), and Phl p 12 (g212)], and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants [CCD (o214)]. Follow the instructions in Section 3.\n3. Fully-automated Test Procedure using the Immunoassay Analyzing System",
    "NOTE: The whole procedure of allergen sIgE testing, which is fully automated and has been described elsewhere7,8,9,10, follows the manufacturer's protocol.\nStart the fully-automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP1000) and use it to perform the immunoassay throughout the study. Turn on the built-in Information Data Management (IDM) computer.\n\tNOTE: The immunoassay analyzer is routinely in stand-by mode.\nWith the \"Primary Power\" on, switch on the \"System Power\" and wait 3 min until the built-in software starts. Click on \"Load Rinse Solution\" and \"Load Washing Solution.\"\nAdd 140 µL of serum to a vial for each allergen/allergen component test. Label each vial containing 140 µL of serum with an identification number unique to each patient.\nFrom the IDM interface, execute the following steps by clicking on the menu.\nCheck the \"Request List\" window on the IDM to make sure that \"sIgE\" is the test method of choice.\nLoad the sample tubes into the sample racks and the quality-control tubes into the quality-control racks, with bar codes.\n\t\tNOTE: For each patient, testing was initially planned for sIgE to 3 specific allergens and 8 allergen components, or 346*11 (3,806) sample tubes. For each sample tube, 3 quality-control tubes that contain low, medium, and high levels of sIgE control (see the Table of Materials for details) were matched. Eventually, only 58 patients who tested positive in the primary test (step 2.3) were further examined in the secondary test (step 2.3). The loading of tubes can be automatically set on the computer console.\nSelect \"Load Reagents\" in the \"Assay Processing\" screen. Complete the loading of the sample and quality-control racks, development solution, conjugate, calibrators, carrier, pipette tips, stop solution, and washing solution according to the \"Loadlist\" (see the Table of Materials for details).\nIn \"Load and Start,\" press \"OK.\"",
    "NOTE: At the end of the measurement, the results appear on the IDM.\nFrom the IDM interface, select the data to be exported. Click on \"Menu,\" \"Approve,\" and \"Save As\" and export the sIgE measurement results as a spreadsheet file.\nImport the spreadsheet file to a statistical software (e.g., SPSS)10. Using a specific module for Spearman's coefficients from the SPSS menu, analyze the correlations in sensitization between these grass pollens (positive sIgE to whole allergen) and pollen components (positive sIgE to allergen molecules).\n4. Definition of sIgE Reactivity\nNOTE: For an undiluted serum specimen, the range of specific IgE measurement is 0.35 to 100 kU/L.\nDilute the samples with sIgE values >100 kU/L 1:5 and re-assay. Where the value remains higher than 100 kU/L, proceed with further dilutions until an end-point level up to 1,000 kU/L is reached.\nBased on the threshold value of 0.35 kU/L, consider an sIgE level exceeding 0.35 kU/L to be positive5,7,10. Rate the reactivity of the sIgE tests as: class 1 (≥0.35 and <0.70 kU/L), class 2 (≥0.70 and <3.50 kU/L), class 3 (≥3.50 and <17.50 kU/L), class 4 (≥17.50 and <50.00 kU/L), class 5 (≥50.00 and <100.00 kU/L), and class 6 (≥100.00 kU/L).\n5. Statistical Analysis\nAnalyze the data with statistical software (e.g., SPSS)10. Report the quantitative data as the mean and standard deviation, the qualitative data as the median and interquartile ranges (IQR), and the categorical data as the proportion of positive results.\nUse a chi-square test for the between-group comparison of proportions, an unpaired t-test for quantitative data, and a rank-sum test for qualitative data.\nUse Pearson's test for correlation analyses between parametric data, with the correlation coefficients expressed as \"r,\" and Spearman's test for non-parametric values, with the correlation coefficients expressed as \"rs.\" Consider statistical significance to be when P-values <0.05.",
