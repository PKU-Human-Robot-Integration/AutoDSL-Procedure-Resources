    "NOTE: The scheme of the protocol is shown in Figure 1, including a timeline of the procedures.\n1. Culture and Passage of CVE Cells\nCulture CVE cells (bEnd.3 cells) in complete growth medium (high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a T75 cm2 tissue culture flask. Grow at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nRemove and discard the cell culture medium. Rinse the cell layer with 0.25% Trypsin-0.03% EDTA solution, and then add 1 - 2 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to the flask and keep the flask at 37 °C for 3 - 5 min. Observe the cells under an inverted microscope until the cell layer is detached. Add 10 mL of complete growth medium and aspirate the cells by gently pipetting.\nDecant the fluid and cells into a 15-mL centrifuge tube and spin at 700 x g for 5 min to remove cellular debris.\nDiscard the supernatant from the centrifuge tube. Add 10 mL of complete growth medium and re-suspend the cell pellet. Spin the cells at 700 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant from the centrifuge tube. Re-suspend the cell pellet in complete growth medium at a concentration of 2.0 × 105 cells/mL (determined by counting using a hemocytometer; exclude dead cells by Trypan-blue staining).\n\tNOTE: Freshly-thawed cells are sub-cultured for at least 3 passages for experiments.\n2. Seed and Treat Cells on Cell Culture Plates\nSeed cells on a 96-well extracellular flux cell culture plate: 80 µL/well. Place the cell culture plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Note: 16 × 103 cells per well will reach 60 - 80% confluency within 24 h.",
    "If the cells are being exposed to a chemical, add the treatments once the cells are attached to the plate bottom (8 - 24 h after seeding).\n\tNOTE: For transfection experiments, do not add antibiotics in complete growth medium.\n3. Assessment of Mitochondrial Function Using the Bioanalyzer\nPrior to the start of the assay, hydrate an extracellular flux sensor cartridge with calibrant by adding 150 µL of extracellular flux calibrant solution to the plate and incubating O/N at 37 °C without CO2.\nUsing the plate washer station, change the cell culture medium into pH 7.0 extracellular flux assay medium. Incubate the cells at 37 °C without CO2 for 30 - 60 min.\nPrepare working solutions of 8 µM oligomycin, 4.5 µM FCCP, 10 µM rotenone, and 10 µM antimycin A in DMEM. Load 25 µL of the stock solutions into cartridge injection ports: Port A, oligomycin; Port B, FCCP; Port C, rotenone and antimycin A with extracellular flux assay medium. Implement the assay protocol as described in Table 1.\nLoad the hydrated cartridge into the bioanalyzer and perform the calibration by clicking the \"Start\" button. After the calibration is complete, remove the cartridge bottom plate and load the cell plate by clicking the \"Unload Cartridge\" prompt. Continue the assay until the end of all measurements.\nOpen the data file and obtain the rate values from the bioanalyzer. Export the data to a spreadsheet file.\n4. Data Analyses\nNOTE: The calculations for data analyses are formulated below. The values are obtained from the bioanalyzer instrument as the OCR presented in Figure 2.\nTo calculate Basal respiration, subtract the non-mitochondrial respiration (measurements 10 - 12) from the basal value (measurement 3).\n\tNOTE: Basal respiration = Basal - non-mitochondrial respiration = Rate ③ - Rate ⑩~⑫.",
    "To calculate ATP production, subtract the ATP-linked respiration (measurements 4 - 6) from the basal value (measurement 3).\n\tNOTE: ATP production = Basal - ATP-linked respiration = Rate ③ - Rate ④~⑥.\nTo calculate Maximal respiration, subtract the non-mitochondrial respiration (measurements 10 - 12) from the Maximum respiration (measurements 7 - 9).\n\tNOTE: Maximal respiration = Maximum respiration - non-mitochondrial respiration = Rate ⑦~⑨ - Rate ⑩~⑫.\nTo calculate Spare capacity, subtract the basal value (measurement 3) from the Maximum respiration (measurements 7 - 9).\n\tNOTE: Spare capacity = Maximum respiration - Basal = Rate ⑦~⑨ - Rate ③.\nTo calculate Proton leak, subtract the non-mitochondrial respiration (measurement 10 - 12) from the ATP-linked respiration (measurement 4).\n\tNOTE: Proton leak = ATP-linked respiration - non-mitochondrial respiration = Rate ④ - Rate ⑩~⑫."
