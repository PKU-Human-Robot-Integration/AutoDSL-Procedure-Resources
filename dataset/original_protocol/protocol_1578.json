    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe present work describes adapted protocols for the production of LbCas12a (henceforth Cas12a) (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Zetsche et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq) (Chien et al., 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Graham et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Lawyer et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RT) (Graham et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kotewicz et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), and TEV protease (Tev)(Kapust et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Reischl et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). These enzymes were intended to be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by an RT-PCR coupled to CRISPR/Cas detection (Alcántara et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, they can be used in a variety of molecular biology applications, such as nucleic acid amplification, DNA target detection, and in vitro DNA digestion. Protocols were adapted to use minimal laboratory equipment, broadly available in low- and middle-income countries.\nExpression in E. coli\nTiming: two days\nThe following culture and reagent volumes are calculated for one liter (1 L) of protein expression (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Scale proportionally if required. Consider additional 200 mL of LB medium to be used as controls (scaling is not required). Sterilize the media by autoclaving at 15 psi and 121°C for 15 min. Wait for the media to cool down to approximately 45°C (approximately 20 min) and proceed to add the corresponding antibiotic.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Protein expression workflow in E. coli\nMedia preparation\nTotal medium conditions for Taq and RT enzymes: Prepare 2.2 L of LB broth with 30 μg/mL Kan + 17 μg/mL Cam.\nTotal medium conditions for the Cas12a enzyme: Prepare 1.2L of LB broth with 100 μg/mL Amp.\nTotal medium condition for the Tev enzyme: Prepare 1.2 L LB broth with 100 μg/mL Amp + 30 μg/mL Cam.\nStarter culture",
    "Transfer a freshly transformed colony using a pipette tip to a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL of LB with appropriate selection antibiotic(s) (see above section: obtaining enzyme-expressing E. coli[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIncubate at 37°C for 14–16 h with shaking at 150 RPM.\nInduction of protein expression\nInoculate 1 L of fresh media (LB with the corresponding antibiotics) with the starter culture to reach a starting optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.05.\nIncubate at 37°C with shaking at 150 RPM until OD600 = 0.5 (1.5 h) for Tev and LbCas12a or OD600 = 0.8 for Taq and RT (2 h).\nTake a 200 μL sample for pre-induction monitoring.\nIPTG induction:\nFor Taq, Tev, and RT, add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubate at 37°C for 3 h at 150 RPM.\nFor Cas12a, incubate on ice or at 4°C for 10–15 min. Add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2 mM and incubate at 22°C–25°C for 14–16 h at 150 RPM.\nFor monitoring the induction of protein expression, measure the OD600 and take 200 μL of culture at 2–3-time intervals (each hour for Taq, Tev, and RT). For Cas12a, take a sample before cell harvest (store on ice) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Keep culture samples on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Analysis of protein expression by SDS-PAGE",
    "(A) The workflow shows the sample collection from pre-induction to up to 3 intervals of post-induction. Cells collected from 200 μL aliquots were lysed and the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Stained acrylamide gels show M-MLV RT (B), Taq DNA polymerase (C), MBP-LbCas12a fusion protein (D), and the TEV protease (E). The bands corresponding to each protein molecular weight are highlighted by a dotted-stroke box, showing increased band intensity from pre- to post-induction samples. Due to the presence of the auto-cleavage site, two different molecular weight bands are observed on (E), corresponding to the MBP tag protein and TEV protease. The SDS-PAGE gel percentage used is shown in the bottom right corner of the gel picture.\nCell harvest\nKeep flasks with induced cultures on ice. Use 50 mL conical tubes for collecting cells. Avoid loading more than 45 mL of cell culture in each tube. Centrifuge the culture at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nAlternatives: Tubes or bottles for larger volumes can be used depending on rotor availability (i.e. Sorvall or Beckman systems).\nWeigh the cell pellet using an empty tube to tare the balance.\nWash cells with 10 mL per gram of cell pellet weight (1:10 volume buffer/ gram cells) using TAKM or HAKM buffer (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Mmc1.xlsx]). Gently resuspend until the pellet is homogenized.\nCentrifuge at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and weigh the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL per gram of cell pellet weight with the indicated buffers prepared with cOmplete™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Use 1 tablet for 50 mL of each buffer) (pre-cooled at 4°C, Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Mmc1.xlsx]):\nRT: MB1 buffer\nTaq: TaB1 buffer\nCas12: HAKM\nTev: TeB1 buffer",

Discard the supernatant (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nResuspend the cell pellets with SDS sample buffer (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Mmc1.xlsx]) as follows:\n  SDS sample buffer   ( μL )  =   OD  600  ∗ Cell Vol μL  2   \nHeat the SDS-treated samples at 95°C for 10 min, spin briefly.\nRun a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 15 μL of each sample as follows:\nTaq and RT: 10% SDS-PAGE (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C)\nCas12a: 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D)\nTev: 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E)\nRun the gel for 5 min at 100 V followed by 55 min at 200 V.\nStain the gel using Coomassie blue dye or other alternatives available (Sasse and Gallagher, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nDestain the gel by incubating it in 80 mL of destaining solution (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Mmc1.xlsx]) at 22°C–25°C with agitation for 3 h. Change the destaining solution several times until most of the Coomassie blue dye is removed from the gel matrix. Proteins will appear as blue bands. If protein bands are not visible, see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section – problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nProtein purification\nTiming: three days\nCell lysis\nUse two or three freeze-thaw cycles for cell lysis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Thaw the frozen cell resuspension on ice and manually mix every 3 min. Once thawed, re-freeze it at −80°C for 15 min. Thaw it again at 4°C on ice, mixing every 3 min.",
    "Pause point: Take advantage of this time to cool down (4°C) the centrifuge with an appropriate rotor for cell debris removal.\nProceed as indicated for each protein (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A): M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RT)\nAdjust NaCl concentration to 370 mM using a 4 M stock. Mix gently.\nAdjust to 20 mL per gram of cell pellet weight with MB1 buffer containing 370 mM NaCl.\nCentrifuge at 11000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nAlternatives: Other tubes can be used depending on rotor availability (i.e. Sorvall or Beckman systems). If using 50 mL conical tubes for collecting cells, avoid loading more than 45 mL of cell lysates in each tube. Make sure that the selected tubes resist the applied G forces.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL tube. Maintain the clarified lysate at 4°C. Keep the cell pellet for SDS-PAGE analysis in case the protein is undetected in the supernatant.\nNote: Avoid freezing or storing crude lysates.\nTaq DNA polymerase\nHeat the lysis suspension at 80°C for one hour.\nAdjust to 20 mL per gram of cell pellet weight with TaB1 buffer.\nAdjust glycerol to 10% final concentration.\nAdd imidazole to a 10 mM final concentration (use a 2 M imidazole stock solution, pH 8.0).\nAdd β-mercaptoethanol to a 6 mM final concentration.\nCentrifuge at 11000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL tube. Maintain the clarified lysate at 4°C.\nNote: Avoid freezing or storing crude lysates.\nLbCas12a and TEV protease\nCentrifuge at 11000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL tube. Maintain the clarified lysate at 4°C.\nNote: Avoid freezing or storing crude lysates.",
    "Pause point: During centrifugation, take advantage of this time to set up the first step of affinity chromatography (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Optimize your steps and timing to reduce as much as possible the time between cell lysis and loading the lysate onto the first chromatographic column.\nBreak Point: Final purification steps differ from this point onwards as they depend on the desired protein, and whether the purification is manual or automated. Filter the supernatant with a 0.45 μm syringe filter before purification. This will avoid clogging of the column in both manual and automated systems.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1144-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cell lysis and protein purification\n(A) The workflow summarizes the most important steps of the cell lysis on the first part of day 1 (Day 1a). Each protein and the corresponding buffers have been allocated a specific color: M-MLV-RT (black), Taq DNA polymerase (blue), MBP-LbCas12a (purple) and TEV protease (green).\n(B) The top-to-bottom scheme is divided into affinity (Day 1b) and ion exchange chromatography (Day 2b). Each protein and the corresponding buffers have been colored as in (A). A right-sided, purple-colored scheme has been included for MBP-LbCas12a representing the extra steps required for its purification. Extra steps for TEV protease purification have been highlighted in green. The days and the processes including day transitions are shown in light blue.\nChromatography (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) All the steps described below can be performed using a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system (Madadlou et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). A manual procedure using disposable syringes of 10 mL (with a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 30–40 drops/min) can also be performed (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).
