    "1. Set Up\nAll research should be approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board or human subjects review committee prior to data collection.\nIdeally, two rooms should be available to conduct the TSST. A comfortable waiting room should be available to participants prior to beginning the TSST and during recovery periods. A separate interview room should be used during the speech preparation, speech performance and math portions of the TSST to introduce novelty and uncontrolability.\nArrange the interview room so that the participant will be facing confederate interviewers and position video or audio recording equipment in the visual field of the participant. Lab coats should be available for interviewers to wear during the TSST to increase stress during the TSST. Instruct interviewers to maintain eye contact with participants and refrain from making emotional facial expressions during the TSST.\nCarefully consider the research question(s) when selecting dependent measurements. Guidelines for the analysis and publication of various measurements of stress response are provided by several sources (guidelines for the publication and analysis of psychophysiological measures are provided by the Society for Psychophysiological Research: http://www.sprweb.org/journal/index.cfm#guidelines[href=http://www.sprweb.org/journal/index.cfm#guidelines]).5 Consultation of these resources during the design of experiments is recommended.",
    "Set up all equipment needed to record physiological, psychological or endocrine responses to the TSST. This equipment may include (but is not limited to) electrodes and electronic equipment and/or software to record heart rate, cardiovascular reactivity, skin conductance or response, eye blink, muscle contraction/tone, respiratory rate; paper and pencil or electronic versions of psychological instruments such as the State Trait Anxiety Inventory;6 tubes and other collection materials for urine, blood or saliva samples; or video recording equipment. For this demonstration, we will be using three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes to measure heart rate during the TSST, and repeated administration of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure psychological response before and after the stressor. We will utilize a basic recording system designed to measure physiological responses (BioPac MP36 system) to record heart rate.\nIf blood samples (rather than saliva) will be collected during the experiment, efforts to minimize pain and distress during collection should be made. Blood collection procedures can introduce additional physical or psychological stress, confounding response to the TSST.\nWhen the participant arrives, welcome them to the lab. Obtain informed consent and seat the participant comfortably.",
    "Collect demographic information, screening information or additional arrival measures that are required by your experiment. Verify that the participant has not consumed food or beverage (other than water) in the past hour if collecting cortisol measurements.  A short period of fasting is recommended if you will be collecting saliva samples for analysis. Changes in pH associated with acidic food or drink or visible contamination can interfere with accurate measurement of salivary markers. Urine toxicology screening may be required if measures of interest may be contaminated by medication or other metabolites. Information about factors that may affect stress response (e.g. medications, illness, sleep, recent stressful events, social phobia) should also be considered when screening participants.\n2. Pre-stress Measurements\nInstruct the participant to wait comfortably for 45 minutes in the waiting room. You may choose to provide the participant with reading material, such as magazines containing emotionally-neutral content, or another emotionally-neutral activity during this period.\nAfter the 45-minute waiting period, administer the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess pre-stress anxiety.6 Alternatively, other instruments that are designed to evaluate state changes in stress, anxiety or relaxation may be administered (e.g. visual analogue scales).",
    "Collect a \"pre-stress\" saliva sample. Instruct the participant to rinse their mouth with water. Give the participant a 5-10 cm section of drinking straw and a clean, disposable 2.0 ml polypropylene vial. Instruct the participant to tilt their head forward to allow saliva to pool on the floor of the mouth then pass the saliva through the straw into the vial. Collect approximately 1.5-2.0 ml of saliva from the participant. Alternatively, saliva can be collected by using absorbent dental wick (or similar material) and instructing the participant to chew or saturate the material with saliva. If possible, leave the room to provide the participant with privacy. Label and store all saliva samples at -20° C as soon as possible.\nRecord 5 minutes of pre-stress physiological measurements.\n3. The TSST\nIf you will be using a separate interview room (to increase the stress effects of the TSST), bring the participant from the waiting room into the interview room.\nTo begin the TSST speech preparation period, read the following script to the participant: \"This is the speech preparation portion of the task; you are to mentally prepare a five-minute speech describing why you would be a good candidate for your ideal job. Your speech will be videotaped and reviewed by a panel of judges trained in public speaking. You have ten minutes to prepare and your time begins now.\"\nRecord physiological measurements during the 10-minute speech preparation period. Set a digital timer for 10 minutes and leave the room.",
    "After 10 minutes, return to the room wearing a lab coat. Read the following script to the participant: \"This is the speech portion of the task. You are to deliver a speech describing why you would be a good candidate for your ideal job. You should speak for the entire the five-minute time period. Your time begins now.\" The prop video camera should be turned on now, to increase evaluative/performance stress.\nRecord physiological measurements during the 5-minute speech performance period. If the participant stops talking during the speech, allow him or her to remain silent for 20 seconds. If he or she does not resume speaking, prompt the participant to continue speaking by instructing them: \"You still have time remaining.\"\nAt the end of the 5-minute speech performance period, read the following script to the participant: \"During the final five-minute math portion of this task you will be asked to sequentially subtract the number 13 from 1,022. You will verbally report your answers aloud, and be asked to start over from 1,022 if a mistake is made. Your time begins now.\" If the participant makes a mistake, prompt them with: \"That is incorrect, please start over from 1,022.\" Set a digital timer for 5 minutes.\nRecord physiological measurements during the 5-minute math performance period.\nAt the end of the math performance period of the TSST, collect a \"post-stress\" saliva sample.\nAdminister post-stress State Trait Anxiety Inventory.\n4. Post-stress Recovery Measurements\nReturn participants to the original waiting room. During the first recovery period, instruct the participant to wait comfortably for 20 minutes. Set a digital timer for 20 minutes and leave the room.\nReturn to the waiting room after 20 minutes and collect a \"recovery 1\" saliva sample.",
    "During the second recovery period, instruct the participant to again wait comfortably for 20 minutes. Set a digital timer for 20 minutes and leave the room.\nReturn to the waiting room after 20 minutes and collect a \"recovery 2\" saliva sample.\nInstruct the participant to complete the \"recovery\" State Trait Anxiety Inventory.\nDebrief the participant as to the true nature of the experiment. Inform the participant that their performance was not recorded and that no analysis of their speech or math performance will be conducted. Explain to the participant that the tasks with which they were presented were unreasonably difficult and do not reflect upon the participant's aptitude or ability.\n5. Data Analysis\nTo analyze psychological measures, score each State Trait Anxiety Inventory from the pre-stress, post-stress and recovery time points.6\nTo analyze physiological measures, compute a mean heart rate score for each of the 5-minute \"pre stress,\" \"speech preparation,\" \"speech performance\" and \"math\" periods of the TSST. Alternatively, compute mean scores for each minute of the TSST or measure heart rate at discrete time points during the TSST.\nTo analyze neuroendocrine measures, assay salivary samples for hormone concentration using commercially available EIA kits.\n6. Optional: Additional Salivary Cortisol Assay Protocol Information (reproduced from Salimetrics salivary cortisol assay kit insert)\nBring all salivary assay kit reagents to room temperature.\nPrepare wash buffer according to kit instructions.\nDetermine plate layout and pipette 25 μL of standards and controls into appropriate wells in duplicate.\nThaw saliva samples, vortex and centrifuge at 1,500 X G (@3,000 RPM) for 15 minutes.\nPipette 25 μL of clear liquid from centrifuged samples into appropriate wells in plate (in duplicate).\nPrepare enzyme conjugate and pipette 200 μL into all wells.\nMix plate for 5 minutes at 500 rpm and incubate for an additional 55 minutes.",
    "Wash and blot the plate 4 times with wash buffer.\nAdd 200 μL tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution to each well using a multichannel pipette.\nMix the plate for 5 minutes at 500 rpm and incubate in the dark for an additional 25 minutes.\nAdd 50 μL stop solution to each well and mix for 3 minutes at 500 rpm to stop the reactions.\nWipe the plate bottom clean and read the plate in a plate reader at 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding stop solution.\nTo calculate cortisol concentration, compute the average optical density for all duplicate wells. Subtract the average optical density of the non-specific binding wells from the average optical density of the zero, standard, control and sample wells.\nCalculate the percent bound (B/Bo) for each standard, control and sample by dividing the average optical density of these wells (B) by the average optical density of the zero wells (Bo). Determine the concentration of the controls and samples by interpolation using software capable of logistics.\n7. Representative Results:\nThe representative data presented here is compiled from a review of the literature and two studies that were conducted in our lab during the afternoon with healthy adult male participants. These data are intended to approximately represent the results that might be found using the protocol presented in this article.",
    "This TSST protocol (Figure 1) induces increases in self-reported anxiety (as measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory; Figure 2), heart rate (Figure 3), and salivary cortisol concentrations (Figure 4). The experimental protocol illustrated in Figure 1 is meant to provide one example of how various measurements might be made during a data collection session with the TSST. The timing of measurements and the inclusion of different measures will be dictated by the specific research question. If using an intervention that is intended to reduce anxiety and/or stress response, blunted or attenuated increases in these measures are predicted.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3238/3238fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
