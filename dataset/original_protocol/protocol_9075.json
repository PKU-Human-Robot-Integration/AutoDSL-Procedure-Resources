    "1. Pull Glass Electrodes\nPull single barrel electrode. Use single barrel glass capillary with filament and pull tip to a diameter of about 1-2 micrometers, shaft length of 10-12 mm, and corresponding electrode resistance of about 12 MOhm (range 5-20 MOhms) as measured in 0.9% NaCl solution. Lower electrode resistances would result in more background activity and thus more difficulty in isolating unitary activity from individual neurons. For pulling this electrode, use either a horizontal or a vertical puller with either heating filaments or heating coils.\nPull multibarrel electrode. Due to the much larger diameter of multibarrel glass and the need of even heat distribution around the entire multibarrel, a powerful puller with a larger diameter heating coil, not a heating filament, is needed. A multibarrel pipette has to be inserted in the center of the heating filament with no contact to the heating coil. Note that besides the 5-barrel pipettes described here, 3-barrel or 7-barrel pipettes are commercially available alternatives. Pull glass to a pipette tip of about 10 micrometers total diameter, or less. The tip will be broken to the correct diameter in the next step, so the exact tip size is less critical during the pulling process than the overall shape of the electrode tip, which should be long and relatively thin. Refer to the image in Figure 1C for the desired electrode tip shape. Short and stubby electrode shapes (Figure 1B) will cause a substantial amount of tissue damage when advanced into the brain, while very long and thin electrode shapes (Figure 1A) will bend and thus will make it difficult to break the electrode tip to the correct diameter (see step 2).\n2. Modify Electrode Tips",
    "Before the two electrodes can be glued together, they have to be modified. The shaft of the single electrode needs to be bent before it can be attached to the multibarrel to make sure the combined shaft of the finished piggy-back electrode is as thin as possible. Additionally, the tip of the multibarrel electrode has to be broken off in order to ensure low resistance for iontophoresis.\nBend shaft of a single barrel electrode by about 20 degrees. Use the smallest Bunsen burner flame possible. Typical \"small\" Bunsen burners from standard lab supply companies create flame sizes that are far too large for this application. To circumvent this problem use the smallest commercial Bunsen burner and secure a syringe needle (~ 18 gauge) to the top of the burner, and seal the connection using dental cement. When operated, the flame should be difficult to see, about 5 mm or less in diameter, and about 8 mm tall. Any air movement in the room will extinguish that flame, so it is a good idea to operate the burner in a closed room, or to use wind shields. Move the single barrel electrode through the flame to bend it by about 20 degrees. Aim to have the burner flame melt the glass at the transition area at about 10 millimeters away from the electrode tip. To avoid melting the tip of the electrode we suggest that the electrode be held at about 45 degrees, tip pointing downward, and move the electrode through the flame relatively quickly.",
    "Break off the tip of the multibarrel electrode. To ensure visual control while breaking the electrode tip, use a microscope with a minimum 10x objective and 10x oculars. A measuring scale inserted in the ocular will also be needed to measure tip sizes. Attach a piece of plexiglass to the microscope such that the end of the plexiglass can be seen in about one-third to one-half of the field of view of the microscope. In our case, the plexiglass piece is about 25 x 70 mm and 5 mm thick and attached via a screw that can be secured into a custom made thread in the microscope stage. It is important to have a design that allows for the plexiglass moving independently of the slide. Place the multibarrel electrode in a bed of modeling clay on a glass slide, and insert the slide containing the electrode into the microscope stage's slide holder. Using the microscope stage's xy manipulators, gently move the electrode tip against the plexiglass piece, and observe the breaking of the tip through the microscope oculars. Attempt to cleanly break the multibarrel's tip to a cumulative diameter of about 25-35 micrometers. Discard pipettes with tip diameters that broke off too large, or tips with uneven breaks. We discard approximately 30% of our multibarrel electrodes due to undesirable tip shapes.\n3. Assemble Piggy-back Electrode",
    "Position electrodes. Remove plexiglass piece used in step 2.2 from the microscope stage. Secure completed multibarrel electrode into modeling clay on a glass slide, tip pointing slightly upward. Pointing upward will be important for step 3.2, the gluing of the two electrodes. Tips that point up cause the glue to run away from the tip, avoiding gluing the electrode tips. Insert bent single barrel electrode into electrode holder of the custom made micromanipulator (Figure 2). Using visual guidance first and then microscopic guidance, lower the single barrel electrode onto the multibarrel electrode. The single electrode should be lowered directly into the groove that is formed by the arrangement of the 5 barrels, with its tip protruding the tip of the multibarrel tip by about 5-10 micrometers. When lowering the single barrel, closely observe the angle that is formed between the two electrodes. For best outcome avoid any angles in which the tips point apart from each other, but rather attempt to lower the single electrode onto the multi perfectly parallel or even with its tip touching the multibarrel first, forming a VERY slight 'wedge' arrangement. Since the single barrel tip is very flexible, it will bend when the single electrode is lowered a little further after the tip has reached the top surface of the multi barrel electrode, forming a clean composite tip that has a small amount of spring action built in that helps holding the tips together. However, if the angle between single barrel and multibarrel electrode is too steep (too much of a wedge), the spring action will be too high and bend the electrode arrangement downwards.",
    "Glue electrode shafts together. Glue the shafts of the two electrodes together using cyanoacrylate (superglue). Place a small drop of glue onto the small side of a flat toothpick and touch electrode assembly with the glue drop. Start at the position most distal of the tips and slowly move toothpick with glue drop along electrode shafts towards the electrode tips. Using too much glue, or applying glue too close to the electrode tips will result in gluing the electrode openings, rendering the electrode at least partially nonfunctional.\nStabilize joint with dental cement. Mix a small amount of dental cement and dental acrylic in a small disposable plastic dish or weigh boat, using a flat toothpick. Wait until cement becomes moldable and apply a small amount to the joint between the two electrodes to stabilize the joint (pink material in Figure 3). Allow about 15 min to dry.\nRemove and store electrode. Carefully remove the completed piggy-back electrode first from the micromanipulator holder, and then detach from the glass slide, and store in a dustproof container.\n4. Prepare Electrode Fill Solutions\nPrepare electrode fill solutions. Since iontophoresis requires charged molecules, most agents have to be dissolved either in an acidic or alkaline environment (typically at a pH of about 3-4, or a pH of about 8-10, respectively). A number of chemicals that are often used in iontophoresis are listed in Table 1. For agents that are not listed in the table, determine from the pKa value, whether it would be easier to use the molecule in an acidic or an alkaline environment to keep the molecule charged, and dissolve accordingly. For best results, mix all solutions fresh daily.\n5. Fill and Prepare Electrodes",
    "Just before using the electrode, back-fill each barrel with its respective drug, using carbon fiber 28 - 34 gauge needles attached to syringes with syringe filters. Fill the 4 outer barrels of the 5-barrel configuration with the drugs of choice, and the center barrel with 3M NaCl as a balancing barrel. Fill the single barrel recording electrode with 3M NaCl as well. Adding a dye to the NaCl solution, such as fast green or phenol red will make it easier to see the electrode tip during placement of the electrode onto the brain surface. Insert the electrode into the electrode holder of the recording setup and insert all wires into the appropriate glass barrels. Use insulated silver wire from which about 1 cm of insulation has been removed at the tip. There should be 5 wires for the multibarrel electrode (4 drug barrels and one balancing barrel), plus the amplifier wire that needs to be inserted into the recording single barrel electrode.\n6. Turn on Iontophoresis Pump Modules\nTurn on iontophoresis pump modules and test all the barrels. The electrode test function of each pump module will help determine if the electrode barrel is functional. To prevent leakage of the drugs from the barrels when not in use, a retention voltage in the opposite polarity as the molecule charge needs to be applied."
