    "The clinical study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research Approval Committee of the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record No. KY2022014).\n1. Preparations before operation\nItems preparation:\n\t\nPrepare items such as Rheum officinale Baill, normal saline, Iodine volts swab, medical tape, medical gauze, medical bending plate, hand disinfectant, and medical rubber glove (Table of Materials).\nUse an ultra-micro pulverizer to make 100 g of Rheum officinale Baill into powder in advance and seal it in a plastic bag for later use.\nBefore treatment, please take 15 g of Rheum officinale Baill powder and use 15 mL of normal saline to make a paste of medicinal powder. Place the paste on a curved plate.\nPatient preparation:\n\t\nAdvise the patient to empty the bladder in advance. Let the patient lie on his/her back, bend the knees, relax, and fully expose the abdomen.\nOperator preparation:\n\t\nClose doors and windows, pay attention to protect the patient's privacy and prevent the patient from catching a cold.\nSelect Shenque point (RN8) and bilateral Tianshu points (ST25) on the patient's abdomen10, and evaluate the local skin of the patient's points to ensure that the skin around the selected points is free of lesions or damage while keeping the local points clean and dry (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\t\t​NOTE: The Shenque acupoint (RN8) is in the umbilical region, central umbilical cord. The Tianshu point (ST25) is located in the abdomen, 2 finger-cun each around the navel (finger-cun means the proportional unit of the thumb, 2 finger-cun equals ~6.67 cm)15.\n2. Operating steps",
    "Disinfect the hands, then press the Shenque point (RN8) and bilateral Tianshu points (ST25) of the patient's abdomen with the thumb fingertip. Press each acupuncture point 50 times, and make sure to rotate the thumb in a clockwise direction while pressing (Figure 3).\n\t\nChange the intensity of pressing the acupoints from weak to strong. Press at ~1 s/time and at a frequency of 30-60 times/min until the patient feels a slight feeling of soreness. If the patient does not tolerate it during the procedure, stop the operation immediately.\nRub the palms of both hands until they are warm, then massage the patient's abdomen 50 times clockwise with the palms (Figure 4). Gradually massage from the navel to the outer circle and then from the outer circle back to the navel.\n\tNOTE: The scope of the circle is centered on the navel, with 2 finger-cun as the radius, i.e., the radius is equal to ~6.67 cm.\n\t\nEnsure the massage action is gentle and the force is not too heavy. Ensure the frequency of massage is from slow to fast, stable and moderate, about 30-50 times/min. It is best to feel slightly warm in the abdomen. If the patient develops intolerance during the procedure, stop the operation immediately.\nWear medical rubber gloves and use iodine volts swabs to disinfect the patient's local acupoints. Take about 3/4 of the prepared medicine from the medical bent plate, roughly divide it into 3 equal parts, make them into a shape similar to a ring (diameter x thickness of about 3 cm x 0.5 cm) and apply them to medical gauze separately.\nFix the medical gauze containing the medicine to the Shenque point (RN8) and Tianshu points (ST25) in the patient's abdomen with medical tape, respectively. Remove it 6 h later.",
    "Require the patient to wear clean and breathable clothes after the acupoint application operation.\n\t\nAsk the patient to avoid strenuous exercise to prevent the drug from falling off and flowing. Promptly remove the drug residues from the patient's local skin and assist the patient in getting dressed.\nInform the patient not to scratch if the local skin is itching, burning, or painful, and remove the drug in time. Keep the local skin clean with normal saline.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
