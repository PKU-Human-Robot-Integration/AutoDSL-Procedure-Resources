    "Prepare protein extracts from cultured cells: \n1. place 10cm petri dish \\(where cells are cultured) on ice\n  2. wash profusely 3 times with cold PBS \\(keep cell culture dishes on ice), vacuum-suck the extra volume of PBS at last wash\n  3. add between 750uL and 1.5mL of freshly prepared, cold Cell Lysis Buffer \\(dilute 10x cell lysis buffer from Cell Signaling with ddH2O, and complement with ThermoScientific \"Halt Protease & Phosphatase \\(100x)\")\n  4. scrape cells with regular flat tip scraper \\(keep on ice)\n  5. tilt petri dish and leave for 5min cell suspension in lysis buffer/inhibitor cocktail \\(keep on ice)\n  6. collect the cell lysates in eppendorf centrifuge tubes\n  7. spin for 15min at 14,000rpm at 4degC\n  8. transfer the supernatant in new tube \\(do not collect any pelleted debris), aliquot 50 to 100uL \\(or larger volumes) per eppendorf, and freeze at -80deg\n  \nPrepare protein extracts from tissue biospecimens. \n1. flash-freeze resected tissue and store at -80degC\n  2. on the day of protein extraction, pulverize tissues and collect in tubes \\(keep on ice at all time).\n  3. add between 750uL and 1.5mL of freshly prepared cold Cell Lysis Buffer, and follow the protocol detailed for the cultured cells \\(above)\n  \nKinase enzyme activity assay. \nSTEP 1: automated liquid dispensing of kinase assay reagents and incubation\n1. Use/program a liquid dispensing instrument to aliquot: peptide + sample + ATP + buffer solutions in 384-well plates, where each well contains one peptide, and an individual 384-well plate simultaneously assesses the phosphorylation activity profile of one sample. \n  2. Keep all reagents on ice \\(or on cold blocks) until enzymatic reactions are started.\n  3. Automate the dispensing of a final 8uL reaction mixture per well in 384-well plates, where each well contains the following reagents:",
    "- kinase assay buffer \\(KaB1x): prepared daily and diluted in ddH2O from KaB10x stock solution Cell Signaling cat.# 9802.\n- 250nM ATP: prepared and diluted daily from ATP stock solution \\(Cell Signaling cat.# 9804) in KaB1x.\n- 200ug/mL 11-mer peptide: lyophilized stocks originally prepared as 1mg/mL in KaB1x, 5% DMSO)\n- samples: typically made of either 5ng/uL recombinant kinase enzyme protein or 10ug/mL protein extract from cell or tissue lysates kept on ice and diluted in KaB1x <30min before experimental testing \\(protein extracts from biological samples prepared\nCRITICAL STEP: while dispensing steps occur, keep all 384-well plates on cold blocks at all time\n4. Once dispensing of reaction mixtures is completed, incubate 384-well plates for 30min at 30degC.\n  5. After enzymatic reactions are completed, dispense Kinase-Glo revealing reagent \\(Promega; cat.# V3772) using automated liquid dispensing instrument\n  \nSTEP 2: generate luminescence profiles\n1. Measure luminescence using Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader from BioTek"
