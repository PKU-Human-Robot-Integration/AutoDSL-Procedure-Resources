    "Patient samples were handled according to the medical ethical guidelines described in the Code of Conduct for Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue of the Dutch Federation of Biomedical Scientific Societies (www.federa.org).\n1. Prepare Slides\nObtain resected tissue material (any kind of tissue) from a pathology department after obtaining medical ethical committee permission to use resected material.\n\tNOTE: For the current experiment, pretreatment tumor samples were obtained from primary oropharyngeal tumors diagnosed in the Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands between 1970 and 2011, selected as described before (n = 162)13. The size of the tissue was only limited by the requirement for a sufficient amount of tumor tissue to reliably take 4 microscopic images inside the tumor.\nFix the tissue in 4% buffered formalin for a minimum of 12 h. Dehydrate the tissue in a graded series of ethanol. Wash it in xylene and embed it in paraffin wax using an automated tissue processor.\nCut 4 µm-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections on glass slides using a microtome. Place the tissue block in the microtone tissue holder using standard procedures.\nCut ribbons of tissue and lay them on the surface of a water bath containing deionized water at 45 ºC. Use a slide suitable for immunohistochemical staining to fish out a section by placing the slide in the water directly underneath the section. Carefully move the slide up at an angle, taking the section out of the water and sticking it onto the slide.\nLet the slides dry overnight at 37 °C.\nDeparaffinize the FFPE slides by immersing them completely in fresh 100% xylene, three times for 5 min each. Rehydrate the slides by submerging them twice in fresh 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and 50% ethanol for 5 min each.\n2. Perform Antigen Retrieval",
    "Wash the slides in deionized water for 5 min.\nPreheat Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (10 mM Tris plus 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.0) to boiling temperature using a microwave. Perform antigen retrieval by submerging the slides in the preheated EDTA buffer and keeping the buffer at this temperature for 10 min in the microwave.\n\tNOTE: Any microwave with a power of 900 W can be used.\nLet the slides cool down in the buffer for 2 h.\n3. Stain Tissue Slides\nWash the slides twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min each.\nDraw a circle around the tissue with a hydrophobic pen to prevent the diluted antibodies from spilling off the slide. Wash once more with PBS; this is optional.\nIncubate the tissue with primary antibodies (anti-CD3 1:50, anti-FoxP3 1:200, and anti-IL-17 1:50) diluted in 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at room temperature overnight.\n\tNOTE: The volume per slide depends on the size of the tissue, but it is typically 50 - 150 µL. Substitute the primary antibodies with antibodies of the same isotype class with an unknown specificity for the negative control slides at the same dilution as the CD3, CD8, and FoxP3 antibodies (i.e., rabbit Ig isotype control antibody, mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody, and goat IgG isotype control antibody).\nWash the slides three times with PBS for 5 min each.\nIncubate the tissue with a combination of fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies targeting the primary antibody species and/or isotypes (i.e., 1:200 donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 488, donkey anti-rabbit IgG A546, and donkey anti-mouse A647) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: The volume per slide depends upon the size of the tissue but is typically 50 - 150 µL.",
    "After adding the secondary antibody, keep the slides protected from light as much as possible by storing them in a dark box or by wrapping the box in aluminum foil.\n4. Mount and Counterstain Tissue Slides\nWash the slides three times in PBS for 5 min each.\nMount the slides using an aqueous anti-fade mounting medium containing a nuclear counterstain (e.g., DAPI). Analyze the slides using a fluorescent microscope as soon as possible (within two weeks). Store the slides in the dark at 4 °C until analysis.\n5. Analyze Stained Tissue Slides\nObtain four images of each slide using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20 - 25X objective. Take images at random locations throughout the total tumor area included in the slide to capture a representative fraction of the tumor.\n\tNOTE: A standard magnification of 250X should be used. Any fluorescent or laser scanning microscope can be used, provided it has the filters and lasers needed to visualize the fluorochromes used.\n\t\nFor visualization of Alexa 488, use an excitation maximum of 490 and an emission maximum of 525; for visualization of Alexa 546, use an excitation maximum of 556 and an emission maximum of 573; for visualization of Alexa 647, use an excitation maximum of 650 and an emission maximum of 665; and for visualization of DAPI, use an excitation maximum of 358 and an emission maximum of 461.\nSave the images as image files (i.e., jpeg and tiff) in the software available to the user.\nDiscriminate between tumor epithelium and tumor stroma areas based on the nuclear and cellular shapes of tumor epithelial versus stromal cells after consulting a pathologist.",
    "To determine the total stromal surface area, draw a line around all area(s) occupied by stromal cells (rather than tumor cells) and record the surface area using the image analysis software provided by the microscope manufacturer.\n\t\t\nClick on the \"Overlay\" tab under the image; choose the \"Closed Poly-line\" shape and click on it. Demarcate the boundary between tumor epithelial and stromal fields by clicking around the area until reaching the first point again.; this provides a measure for that area.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Once the shape is closed, a number will appear next to the shape encircling the surface area of the selected image (A = x µm2).\nSubtract this surface area from the total image surface area (provided in image properties) to calculate the epithelial surface area. Exclude vascular, necrotic, and autofluorescent areas by drawing a line around them, recording the size of the provided area and subtracting that from the epithelial surface area.\nSave all surface area numbers in a spreadsheet file to calculate the average surface areas and cell numbers per slide.\nUsing the image analysis software, determine if the cells are single-, double-, or triple-positive by checking the fluorescence of all four channels.\n\t\t\nCount the single-, double-, and triple-positive cells in each image using ImageJ.\n\t\t\t\nDownload ImageJ. Open an image by clicking on \"File\" and \"Open\" and selecting the image to be analyzed. Right-click on the \"Point Tool\" (a red square in the middle of four lines) and select the \"Multi-Point Tool.\" Double-click on the \"Multi-Point Tool\" and count the number of different cell types in the image by selecting a different counter number for each cell type.",
    "NOTE: Count all the cells of each different cell type, as identified by the presence of one, two, or all three fluorescent colors. Exclude DAPI, as this nuclear counterstain is present in all cells and is used to discriminate tumor cells from immune cells. Each cell type is counted using a different counter number. Count the cell numbers of each cell type separately in the tumor epithelial and stromal areas by choosing a different counter number each time. Do not count cells within blood vessels and largely autofluorescent areas.\nRecord the number of cells analyzed in each counter bin for each image in a spreadsheet file.\nDivide the total number of cells for each cell type over the total surface area of tumor epithelium and tumor stroma analyzed.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nNOTE: All statistical analyses should be discussed with a statistician to assure quality of data. For general statistics, use any medical statistics guide14.\nTest the correlations between cell frequencies using a Spearman's rank correlation rho test.\nTest the statistical differences in the numbers of positive cells between patient groups using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test.\nTest the correlations between cell numbers and disease-free survival (i.e., time from diagnosis until local or distant recurrence of death or disease) by dividing the patients in groups based on a cut-off number of cells using Kaplan-Meier curve generation and log rank analysis15.\nPerform multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\nSubscription Required.
