    "1. Mammalian cell culture and transfection\nPlate 2 x 106 cells in a 100 mm culture dish. Use four dishes for each transfection.\n\tNOTE: The number of cells required may vary for different cell lines. Optimization may be necessary before proceeding to the isolation step.\nThe next day, transfect the cells with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2. Cell harvest\nDiscard the culture medium 48 h post-transfection.\nWash the cells with ice-cold PBS (10 mM sodium phosphates, 2.68 mM potassium chloride, 140 mM sodium chloride) twice.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 0.5x protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.5x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) to each dish.\nCollect the cells with a cell scraper and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation using a swing bucket rotor at 400 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet gently in 5 mL of homogenization buffer (HB; 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA supplemented with 0.03 mM cycloheximide, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail).\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 1,300 x g for 10 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of HB.\nHomogenize the cells with a Dounce homogenizer for 15-20 strokes.\n\tNOTE: Other homogenization methods, for example, passing the sample through a syringe, could be used. The homogenization efficiency could be revealed by observing the homogenate under a phase-contrast microscope.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 2 mL centrifugation tube.\n\tNOTE: Harvest 50 µL of homogenate with 12.5 µL of 5x sample buffer and label it as total lysate.\nAdd 0.7 mL of HB to the homogenate.\nSpin the diluted homogenate at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The pellet contains nuclei and unbroken cells.\nCollect 1.5 mL of the supernatant and repeat step 2.12 once.\nCollect 1.4 mL of the supernatant and label it as post-nuclear supernatant (PNS).\n3. Density gradient column preparation\nTransfer 1.2 mL of PNS to an ultracentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 mL of 62% sucrose solution (2.351 M sucrose, 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4) to the sample and mix well by gentle pipetting.\n\tNOTE: The resultant solution is a 40.6% sucrose solution.\nAdd 3.3 mL of 35% sucrose solution (1.177 M sucrose, 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4) carefully on top of the sample.\nAdd 2.2 mL of 25% sucrose solution (0.806 M sucrose, 3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4) carefully on top of the 35% sucrose solution.\n\tNOTE: The refractive index of the 62%, 40.6%, 35%, and 25% sucrose solutions at room temperature are 1.44, 1.40, 1.39, and 1.37, respectively. The refractive indexes of the sucrose solutions could be checked with a refractometer to ensure the precision and consistency of the experiment.\nFill up the ultracentrifugation tube with HB.\n\t​NOTE: Temporarily store the prepared density gradient column at 4 °C.\n4. Fractionation and recovery of recycling endosome-containing fraction\nCentrifuge the column at 210,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °C.\nCollect 12 fractions (1 mL each) carefully, starting from the top of the gradient.\n\tNOTE: The recycling endosomes should be found at the interface between 35% and 25% sucrose solutions. The collected fractions can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.\nDilute all the fractions with 1 mL of dilution buffer (3 mM imidazole at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA).\nCentrifuge the diluted sample at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and add 50 µL of 1x sample buffer to harvest the fractions.\nAnalyze the protein contents in the fractions by western blotting.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
