    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing HEK293 cells – Day 0\nTiming: 12–24 h\nPlate HEK293 cells in a Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)-containing plate containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA) (If possible, it would be better not add antibiotics to the culture medium at this time).\nNote: The cell seeding number depends on the culture scale.\nCheck cell confluency before transfection.\nNote: Cells should reach 80%–90% confluency by observing under microscope at the time of transfection.\nNote: Cell condition is one of the crucial factors for AAV vector production. If the condition is poor, including the presence of strange cell shapes, use a new cell stock to properly produce AAV vectors.\nTransfection of AAV plasmids – Day 1–5\nTiming: 1 h (for step 3)\nTiming: 1 h (for steps 4 to 8)\nFour plasmids containing the AAV genome, adeno virus helper genes, Tet-Cap, and CMV-Rep2 are co-transfected into HEK293 cells for AAV vector production. Plasmids for conventional AAV vector transfection can be prepared as control. For comparison, the plasmid transfection volume must be adjusted similarly by adding an empty plasmid. Any transfection reagents can be used for this protocol.\nTransfect plasmids to HEK293 cells.\nSmall scale (such as 6-, 12-, or 24-well-plates).\nCommercialized transfection reagents can be used according to manufacturer’s instructions. (Example; HilyMax https://www.dojindo.co.jp/manual/H357e.pdf[href=https://www.dojindo.co.jp/manual/H357e.pdf], Lipofectamine 3000 https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flipofectamine3000_protocol.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Flipofectamine3000_protocol.pdf])\nPrepare Opti-MEM medium in a tube (the suitable medium volume depends on transfection reagent)\nAdd plasmids to the tube in the following ratio:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3185_12.csv\nAll plasmids are added in a tube containing Opti-MEM medium.\nAdd transfection reagent to each tube according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nMix samples well by vortex (it depends on manufacturer’s instructions) and incubate them for 10–20 min at room temperature (RT; 20°C–25°C).\nAdd samples dropwise to each well for plasmid transfection into cells.",
    "Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2, 90%–95% humidity for 12 h in a CO2 incubator.\nLarge scale (such as T225 flask, Cell Factory [2528 cm2]]).\nPrepare PEI-MAX solution and 150 mM NaCl solution.\nThe following protocol is for transfection using Cell Factory (Culture medium; 400–500 mL.\nPrepare 50 mL (1/10 volume of culture medium) of 150 mM NaCl solution in a 225 mL tube.\nAdd plasmids to the tube in the following ratio:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3185_13.csv\nAll plasmids are added in a tube containing 150 mM NaCl solution.\nAdd 6825 μg of PEI-MAX (3.5-fold to total DNA amount (μg)) to each tube.\nNote: The volume of PEI-MAX needs to be optimized to obtain best results by your cell condition such as transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity against DNA and reagents.\nMix samples well by up-side-down and incubate them for 20 min at RT.\nTake approximately 100 mL of culture medium from culture flask and add it to a new tube.\nAdd the plasmids mixture to 100 mL of culture medium and mix well (the total volume is approximately 150 mL).\nReturn the mixture to the flask for plasmid transfection into cells and mix the medium gently.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 12 h in a CO2 incubator.\nNote: Cells must be adherent in this transfection step to obtain maximum AAV vector production. If some cells float during transfection, the efficacy of AAV vector production decreases.\nAt 12 h post-transfection, prepare fresh, warmed complete culture medium.\nAdd doxycycline (Dox) with a final 2 μg/mL concentration to fresh medium.\nDiscard culture medium from the flask.\nAdd fresh complete medium containing Dox in the flask.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 3 days (small scale) or 4 days (large scale).",
    "Note: Generally, adding Dox at 10–15 h post transfection is advantageous for efficient AAV vector production. However, vector production efficiency may depend on the cell condition and experiments.\nHarvest cells and supernatants – Day 5\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPrepare the AAV lysis buffer, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), chilled 5 mM EDTA/PBS solution on ice, and 40% PEG solution.\nHarvest cells and supernatants.\nSmall scale.\nPrepare the tubes for the samples.\nPipette the culture medium to detach all cells from plate.\nCollect the cells and supernatant in a tube.\nStore samples in −80°C before use.\nLarge scale.\nPrepare the tubes for the samples.\nCollect the culture supernatants in tubes and add 1/4 volume of 40% PEG solution, and store the mixture at 4°C for at least 4 h after mixing well until AAV vector collection in supernatants in subsequent steps.\nNote: Only supernatant is needed to harvest AAV vector in culture meidum at this moment. Detached cells may exist in supernatant at this step. These cells can be separated from the supernatant by centrifugation, and the cell pellet can be mixed with sample at step b-5.\nCarefully wash the cells using 1 × PBS while avoiding detaching cells, and discard PBS.\nNote: If many detached cells are present in this step, collect the samples in a tube and mix them according to step b-5.\nAfter the PBS wash, add 100 mL of ice-chilled 5 mM EDTA/PBS solution to the cell flask, and incubate the cells at RT for 10–15 min to detach the cells.\nCollect solutions containing cells in a tube, and centrifuge at 2000–3000 × g for 10 min, and then discard the supernatant.\nWash the flask with 100 mL PBS and collect the cells in tubes.\nRepeat step b-5 twice to collect the cells from the flask completely.",
    "Centrifuge samples at 2000–3000 × g for 10 min, and then discard the supernatant.\nNote: If the entire volume of supernatant cannot be collected in a tube, centrifugation can be performed separately for each wash sample.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the pellets on ice or in −80°C before use.\nCentrifuge the supernatants-PEG mix (after the 4-h 4°C incubation) from step b-2, at 2000–3000 × g for 20 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, and dissolve the supernatant-pellet in 8–10 mL of AAV lysis buffer.\nAdd dissolved samples (step b-11) to each tube containing cell pellet at step b-9, and store samples at −80°C before use.\nPause point: You can stop experiment after freezing samples.\nAAV vector extraction and purification – Day 5–6\nTiming: 1–2 days (for steps 11 to 34)\nFor AAV vector extraction and purification, you can use global standard methods.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Ultracentrifuge steps to purify AAV vectors require items described in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3185-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Ultracentrifuge for AAV vector purification\n(A) Items used for ultracentrifugation to purify AAV vectors.\n(B) Diagram of layers containing AAV vectors before and after ultracentrifugation.\n(C) The position of the needle to collect AAV vectors after centrifugation.\nExtract AAV vectors\nPrepare a 37°C water bath and liquid nitrogen (or cold ethanol using dry ice).\nIncubate the frozen samples in a 37°C water bath for 10–15 min until they have thawed entirely.\nMix the samples well by vortexing for 10–20 s.\nThen place samples in liquid nitrogen (or cold ethanol using dry ice) for 20 min until completely frozen.\nRepeat steps 12–14 thrice (four times in total).\nCentrifuge the samples at 5000–8000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cell debris.\nTransfer the supernatants to new tubes (The supernatants comprise the crude AAV vector solutions).",
    "Note: For small scale preparations, you can filter the supernatants using 0.22 μm syringe-top filter to eliminate cell debris after centrifugation (step b-16).\nDigest free DNAs in solution with a DNase treatment.\n[Small scale]\nPrepare DNase solution, such as Turbo DNase, according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nTake 4 μL of sample and digest free DNAs in a 20 μL reaction volume. Example: TURBO DNase or TURBO DNA-free kit (ThermoFisher)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3185_14.csv\nIncubate the samples at 37°C for at least 4 h.\nAfter the reaction, inactivate the DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n(For example, inactivate DNase by adding 1 μL of inactivation reagent from the Turbo DNA free kit and mixing samples well. Centrifuge samples at 8,000–10,000 × g for 5 min and then collect supernatants into a new tube for elimination of DNase.)\nAdd 1 volume of water to dilute DNase-treat samples.\nNote: Samples are diluted with 1/10 from the initial concentration.\nNote: Because AAV vector yield by small scale is small, samples before DNase treatment (step 17) can be used for various assay. However, the step of DNase treatment (step 18) is required to check AAV vector titer in solution (Quantification; step 34–40).\nProceed to the quantification step.\n[Large scale]\nAdd benzonase with 50 units/mL as the final concentration to each tube.\nIncubate the samples for at least 4 h at 37°C.\nProceed to the purification step.\nPurify AAV vectors\nPrepare ultracentrifugation tubes and 54, 40, 25, 15% Opti-prep (Iodixanol) buffers.\nNote: Opti-prep buffers should be prepared ahead of time.\nLayer 54, 40, 25, and 15% Opti-prep gradients (from the bottom to the top) in ultracentrifugation tubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) slowly to not mix layers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3185_15.csv\nApply the sample (step 18 b-3) on top of the 15% layer.",
    "If making multiple samples can add AAV lysis buffer to the top for balance.\nPerform ultracentrifugation at 30,000–40,000 rpm (approximately 170,000–280,000 × g) for 6–15 h at 4°C–10°C.\nNote: Normally, centrifugation is performed for 12–15 h (overnight).\nCheck the layers after ultracentrifugation and collect the entire second layer from the bottom (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C), which contains full and empty AAV vectors, with syringe.\nNote: The second layer contains full (including AAV genome) and empty AAV particles. To select the portion containing full AAV vectors, the fractionation for second layer can be performed.\nNote: If further purification is needed, re-ultracentrifugation can be performed using the samples in this step.\nAdd 1 volume of AAV lysis buffer to dilute the sample.\nPrepare Amicon Ultra 100 kDa MWCO column (4 mL or 15 mL, Merk) by adding 4–15 mL of AAV lysis buffer to pre-wash the membrane, and then centrifuging the column at 3000 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the flow-through, and immediately add the sample (at step 25) to the pre-washed column.\nCentrifuge the sample at 3,500–4,000 × g for 40–60 min.\nNote: Samples are sticky and may not easily pass through the column. In this case, increase the centrifugation time until most samples pass through the column.\nAdd 4 mL of fresh AAV lysis buffer to wash the column (If you use a 15 mL column, add 15 mL of AAV lysis buffer)\nCentrifuge the sample at 3,500–4,000 × g for 20–40 min.\nNote: Adjust the optimal remaining volume of solution in the column by centrifugation time.\n(Optional) Wash column by repeating step 29–30.\nCollect the remaining solution above the column, which contains AAV vectors.\nFilter sample further using a 0.45 μm syringe.\nAliquot AAV vector solutions into tubes and keep them in −20°C or −80°C before use.",
    "Note: Because AAV vectors are usually stable, they can be stored at 4°C for short periods.\nPause point: You can stop experiment after finishing this step.\nQuantification of AAV vectors – Day 7\nTiming: 3–4 h\nTo use the produced AAV vector for various assays, you need to determine the AAV vector titer using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or other methods.\nPrepare the qPCR reagent, primer sets targeting the inverted terminal repeat (ITR), standard (quantified AAV vector, plasmid containing AAV genome, fragment of ITR), and samples.\nPrepare 107, 106, 105, 104, 103, 102 vg/μL of standard samples and a negative control.\nPlace the standard and samples in separate wells in a PCR plate in duplicate or triplicate, and seal the plate.\nIncubate the plate at 95°C for 10 min to denature AAV vectors.\nNote: Instead of DNA plasmids or fragments, we recommend using viral particles for the standard and denaturing them together with samples in the same plate because the efficacy of AAV genome release from particles and capsid proteins in the reaction may affect the qPCR result.\nPrepare the qPCR master mix, including primers, according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n(As example of a qPCR reaction with a reaction volume of 20 μL): 1 μL of sample, 12.5 μL of 2 × qPCR buffer, 0.1 μL of primer 1 (10 μM), 0.1 μL of primer 2 (10 μM), 11.3 μL of pure water).\n(Example; TB Green Premix Ex Taq II https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/RR82LR/RR82LR_UM.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/RR82LR/RR82LR_UM.pdf])\nNote: The concentration of the samples in this protocol are 1/10 dilution from the original samples.\nPerform the qPCR reaction according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: The reaction conditions depend on the reagents and instrument. Fast and conventional PCR cycles are applicable.\nAnalyze AAV vector titer in samples.",
    "Note: After determining the AAV vector titer, these vectors can be used for various assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blots, immunoprecipitation, infection studies on cells and injection into mouse models.\nNote: After aliquoting, the AAV vectors can be kept at −20 or −80°C for long-term storage, at 4°C for short-term storage, for 1–2 weeks, before use."
