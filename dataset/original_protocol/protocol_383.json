    "1. Phosphopeptide ligation with a carrier protein to generate ligated phosphoprotein \\(LPP) substrates\n  &#x2022; Timing, 4-16 h \nAn intein mediated protein ligation \\(IPL) reaction is conducted by mixing the carrier protein \\(CP) and phosphopeptide \\(T3pThr, or Cdc2pTyr) in a molar ratio of at least 1:25 \\(CP: peptide). The reaction is usually carried out at 4&#xB0;C for 16 h or at 25&#xB0;C for 4 h, with ligation efficiencies typically in the range of 40%-75% when using purified peptides possessing an N-terminal cysteine.  This extent of ligation usually requires the synthetic peptide to be present at a final concentration of 0.5-1.0 mM. The ligation reaction is evaluated by a shift of mobility of the LPP compared to the unligated CP on a Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE. Peptides can be stored in a powder form or as a stock solution \\(5-10 mM) at -80 &#xB0;C. The excess of unligated free peptide can be removed by dialysis using a nitrocellulose filter or a Slide-a-lyzer. For a large scale purification of LPP, gel filtration or chromatography can be performed. \nLigation Protocol\n  2 X Peptide Solution \\(2 mM)  12.5 &#x3BC;l\n  10 X Carrier Protein Reaction Buffer 2.5 &#x3BC;l\n  Carrier Protein \\(1.0 mg/mL)  10.0 &#x3BC;l\n   Total volume                25.0 &#x3BC;l\nPAUSE POINT Ligation products can be stored at &#x2013;20 &#xB0;C for up to one month or &#x2013;80 &#xB0;C for at least 6 months.\n2.  Substrate Coating\n  &#x2022;  Timing, overnight \nDilute the ligated phosphoprotein \\(LPP) substrates in PBS buffer and apply the samples to a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. Coat each well with 100 &#xB5;l of a diluted LPP sample containing 2 &#xB5;g CP and approx. 1.5 &#xB5;g peptide or a 13 &#xB5;M peptide solution \\(~1.5 &#xB5;g peptide). Incubate the plate at 37 &#xB0;C overnight. \n3.  Phosphatase reaction\n  &#x2022;  Timing, 1-2 h",
    "Wash each well coated with LPP substrate three times \\(each with 100 &#xB5;l PBS). Add phosphatase and 10 X buffer to each well, and incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 h or following manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendation. \n&#x2022; T-Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatse \\(TC PTP) Reaction\n5 &#x3BC;l 10X TC PTP reaction buffer                           \n0.25 &#x3BC;l TC PTP \\(10,000 unit/ml)\n44.75 &#x3BC;l dH2O\n50 &#x3BC;l reaction  \n&#x2022; Protein Phosphatse1 \\(PP1) Reaction\n5 &#x3BC;l 10X PP1 reaction buffer \n5 &#x3BC;l 10X MnCl2                          \n0.4 &#x3BC;l PP1 \\(2,500 unit/ml)\n39 &#x3BC;l dH2O\n50 &#x3BC;l reaction                        \n                      \n4.  Immunodetection\n  &#x2022;  Timing, 4.5 h\nAfter phosphatase treatment, wash each well three times with 100 &#x3BC;l PBST \\(or TBSTT). Add 100 &#xB5;l of PBST containing 4% non-fat milk and incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 h.  Wash each well with PBST three times. Add 100 &#xB5;l of phospho-specific antibody prepared in PBST containing 2% non-fat milk and incubate at 37 &#xB0;C for 1 h with mild shaking. Wash three times with 100 &#x3BC;l PBST. Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody prepared in PBST containing 2% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h. \nAfter three washes with PBST, 100 &#xB5;l of ABTS developing solution containing 20 mM ABTS \\(Sigma), 0.12% hydrogen peroxide and 50 mM citrate buffer \\(pH 4.0) is added to each well and the colorimetric signal is measured at OD<sub>415</sub>."
