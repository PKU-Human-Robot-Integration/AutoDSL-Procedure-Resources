    "Animal studies were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee of the Trudeau Institute. 8-12 week old C57BL/6 mice were used for the study.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nPrepare and sterilize surgical instruments.\nPrepare isoflurane-based anesthesia system with nose cone, and heated pad. Make sure heated pad is not overheated (<39 ºC).\nMake sure that the isoflurane gas scavenging canister is positioned correctly to ensure the exhaust ports at the bottom of the canister are not blocked or occluded in any way. Weigh gas scavenging canister prior to procedure and document weight on canister. Discard canister when canister weight exceeds 50 g of accumulated weight (~12 hr).\n2. Anesthesia\nAnesthetize mouse with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber (1 L/min O2).\n\t\nAssess anesthetic depth by an inability to remain upright, loss of purposeful voluntary movement, loss of blink reflex, muscle relaxation, and loss of response to reflex stimulation (toe or tail pinch with firm pressure).\nAssess respiratory rate and pattern by observing chest wall and abdominal movements. Under optimal anesthesia, the breath rate should be ~ 55-65 breaths per min.\nRemove mouse from the induction chamber and quickly shave the abdomen area of the mouse.\nTo prevent corneal desiccation, place bland ophthalmic ointment in the eyes.\nPlace mouse on the heated pad and connect it via nose cone to anesthesia system. Make sure latex nose cone membrane firmly fits over the head of the mouse and there is no leak of isoflurane.\nReduce isoflurane rate to 1.5%, and inject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) subcutaneously to prevent wind-up of the pain-cascade.\nWipe the skin of the operation area with a sterile cotton swab soaked with Betadine surgical solution followed by 70% ethanol.\n3. Surgery",
    "Make a mid-line 3-5 cm laparotomy with operating scissors. Cover operation area with sterile non-adherent pad moistened with saline. Isolate cecum and ileum and expose the superior mesenteric artery using cotton swabs moistened in saline.\nTo facilitate clip applying, make small nicks in the mesentery surrounding the superior mesenteric artery using fine iris scissors.To do this, gently raise the intestine with dressing forceps and cut mesentery on both sides of the superior mesenteric artery at the desired clip position (Figure 1A). Then, add few drops of sterile saline to the area of desired clip position before applying clips.\n\tNote: To perform the sham surgery, follow the surgical procedure up to step 3.2. Do not apply clips. Instead, maintain the tissue moist by added warm saline as described in 3.6 for 1 hr. Afterwards, proceed to step 4.1,\nOcclude the first order branches of the superior mesenteric artery with microvascular clips (70 g force) using a clip applier to create a 5-7 cm region of the ischemic ileum adjacent to cecum (Figure 1B). Although the position of the vessels is conservative, there might be slight variations between mice (see examples on Figure 1). Therefore, 2 or 3 clips are usually required (see the location of the clips on Figure 1A, D, E, black arrows).\n\tNote: Use high quality vessel clips. High pressure clips can damage vessels and prevent regeneration whereas low pressure clips (<30 g) may not completely block blood flow.\nBlock collateral blood flow through the intestine using two microvascular clips across vessels (40 g force), demarking the region of ischemic intestine (Figure 1). Occlusion of collateral vessels is required to prevent blood supply from adjacent blood vessels (see the location of the clips on Figure 1A, D, E, green arrows).",
    "Optional: Add heparin solution (6 USP units/ml), to prevent blood clotting. Dropwise add 0.5 ml of heparin solution to the isolated intestine.\nWet sterile non-adherent pad delicate wipes with saline pre-warmed to 37 °C and apply to surgical area. Make sure that wipes remains wet during the entire procedure.\nMaintain ischemia for 60 min using 1-1.5% isoflurane anesthesia throughout. If ischemia procedure is performed correctly, the ischemic region will change to wine red in color in approximately 30 min. Note that blood vessels distal to the clip position are enlarged during ischemia (Figure 1, right panels) indicating successful occlusion.\nClosely monitor the mouse during the ischemia stage. Continue to apply saline solution to the non-adherent pad covering the surgery site.\nMark the edges of the ischemic area by pipetting 20 μl of Gill`s 3 hematoxylin on the tissue to facilitate harvesting the ischemic tissue and adjacent healthy tissue from the same mouse for comparison (Figure 1E, right panel).\n4. Reperfusion Stage\nAt the end of the ischemia add few drops of saline on the clip area and gently remove microvascular clips with clip applier. Then, gently push the intestine back to the abdominal cavity using saline moistened cotton tips. Remove non-adherent pad and close the abdominal wall and skin using 9 mm stainless steel wound clips. If reperfusion is performed longer than 3 hr, use an absorbable vicryl suture to close the abdominal wall before applying wound clips on skin.\nMaintain mice in a heated clean cage for desired amount of time (30 min, 60 min, 120 min, or 180 min) for the reperfusion phase.\nCheck animals at least every 30 min to assure stability.\n5. Necropsy and Harvesting of Small Intestine\nEuthanize mice by CO2 overdose followed by cervical dislocation at the desired time following reperfusion.",
    "Open abdominal cavity and collect the ischemic intestinal tissue for further analysis. Harvest healthy normal tissue adjacent to the injured tissue as an internal control to account for any systemic reaction to injury.\n\tNote: This control is more appropriate than the sham operated control mice because sham operated mice do not undergo a systemic reaction to IR-induced injury.\nWash out intestinal content using 30 ml syringe with attached gavage needle filled with saline and then cut the intestine longitudinally. If a sample of intestine is required for gene expression analysis, cut a 1.5 mm fragment longitudinally, and use the remaining piece for histological analysis.\nFor histological analysis, prepare a Swiss roll using a pair of forceps to roll the intestine.\nTo maintain the rolled form, place the pieces of intestine between biopsy foam pads in tissue cassettes (Figure 2). Place the cassettes in 10% buffered formalin.\nFix tissue in formalin for at least 24 hr. Replace formalin with 70% Ethanol for an additional 24 hr. Store tissue in 70% ethanol indefinitely at room temperature.\nEmbed in paraffin, cut 5 µm sections and stain with hematoxylin and eosin using a standard protocol (Figure 3).\n6. Scoring\nScore the murine ischemia-reperfusion injury as summarized in Table 2. Choose an appropriate scoring method.\nOptional: Divide the field of view into four sections since the severity of the injury varies throughout the section.\nCalculate the average grade of each section from scores obtained blindly.\nCompare the grade of the injured tissue between cases and control as well as to the uninjured tissue using a Kruskal-Wallis Test, followed by a Dunn's multiple comparisons test.\nSubscription Required.
