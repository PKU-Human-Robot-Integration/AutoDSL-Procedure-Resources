    "Stool aliquoting/pulverizationNote: All steps were performed in a biosafety hood due to use of human feces and risk of viable infectious organisms. Washing and preparation of mortars and pestlesThoroughly sterilize working area with 10% bleach followed by 75% EtOH and UV exposure for 10 min to minimize contamination.Prepare 10% bleach beaker for scrapers.Bleach mortar/pestles for 10 min in 10% bleach solution.Place versi-dry sheets in hood.Place samples on dry ice in hood.With remaining dry ice, place open microtube freezer box stably on top of dry ice with empty pre-labeled tubes and place in hood.Tear heavy duty aluminum foil into pieces around 10 inches wide. Then using a flat surface, tear this into 3 approximately equal squares. Do this twice (6 squares). Place these in the hood.Once the 10 min bleach is finished, rinse all 6 mortars and pestles with dH2O and set on another versi-dry to dry slightly, and then set upright in hood on versi-dry. UV for 10 min along with all other equipment to be used.When done, place pestles in mortars, and set all but one to side, stack aluminum foil.Add large mound of gloves to hood.Add liquid N2 to Dewar.Pulverization of stoolDouble glove. Note: This is not needed if not using human stool.Place large Kim-wipe on top of the versi-dry. Place mortar and pestle on it. Open a sterile package of stool scrapers.Place a piece of aluminum foil into mortar and mold to inner shape of mortar.Select sample to use, bring out of dry ice and set on Kim-wipe.Identify corresponding pre-labelled screw-cap tubes, and bring them to front of the box.Fill Styrofoam cup 3/4 full with liquid N2 from Dewar. Pour some liquid N2 into the box of screw-top tubes, and pour enough into the mortar to fill it ½ way full.",
    "Place cup to side of mortar (recommend having some liquid N2 remaining).Take a stool scraper out of package.Open sample tube.Use stool scraper to carefully get sample out of tube into the mortar. Try to get the whole sample out at once.Note: May need to warm sample tube in hands to slightly thaw around edges. Do not thaw longer than necessary to remove sample. Once out, place now empty sample tube into the box of tubes to re-freeze, consider adding small amount of liquid N2 near the tube to aid with re-freezing.For large chunks of stool, use pestle to break apart. When all large chunks have been crushed to small pieces, then pulverize with pestle. Intermittently add more liquid N2 to mortar as needed to keep sample from thawing out until pulverized completely.Let liquid N2 boil off. Sample now has the texture of a powder.Immediately take a fresh tube and scrape approximately 200 mg sample into the tube, tap the tube onto clean side of cold mortar to settle contents to bottom, and place it back into microtube box. Repeat with the remaining 3 tubes. If any sample remains after aliquoting 200 mg to new tubes, scrape remaining sample into the original tube, tapping tube onto a clean cold portion of the mortar to settle contents to the bottom of the tube. If needed, remove aluminum foil from the mortar to get any remaining bits of sample. Notes: a. Sample left in aluminum foil thaws VERY quickly once out of the mortar.b. Do not screw on caps tightly as it is likely they still have some liquid N2 present.Place stool scraper into bleach beaker, aluminum foil into autoclave bag, pestle into mortar, deglove, take Styrofoam cup out of hood. Place Kim-wipe into an autoclave bag.",
    "If versi-dry is dirty, remove versi-dry and place it into the autoclave bag.Carefully place mortar and pestle in bleach bath.Repeat process for total of 6 samples.Store samples at -80 °C.Wash as above and repeat as needed.VLP enrichment protocolPulverize as above ~200 mg of stool into sterile 2 ml screw cap tube on dry ice to keep frozen.Add 400 µl cold SM buffer per sample. Keep on ice. Vortex on high speed for 5 min. Note: It is possible to use a 2 ml tube adapter plate to hold all sample tubes at once if available. Avoid touching tip to tube when adding reagents. Change tips between samples to avoid cross-contamination. Low speed centrifugation is used to avoid lysing bacteria. Goal is to get everything into solution. More SM buffer can be added if needed.Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer supernatant to a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge a second time for 10 min at 2,000 x g at 4 °C. Note: Sometimes a third spin is needed to clarify supernatant. Final supernatant volume should be at least 200 µl because a fraction of the volume will be lost in the subsequent filtration. More SM buffer can be added if needed. Filter supernatant once through a 0.45 µm filter. Then filter twice through 0.22 µm filters. All filtration steps use 1 ml Luer-lok syringes and 13 mm diameter filters.Note: Filtering once through 0.22 µm filter is sufficient, but 2 x 0.22 µm filtration steps were used in this manuscript. If the filter clogs: pull the plunger out to relieve pressure, take off the filter and put a new one on. If the initial sample volume was low, may need to use a pipette to recover remaining sample from the old, clogged filter.",
