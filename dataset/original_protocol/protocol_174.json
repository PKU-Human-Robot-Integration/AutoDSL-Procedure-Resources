    "**Dissection**\n1. Carefully remove the skin and blubber minimizing damage to the major subcutaneous veins. \n  2. Examine the visible and larger subcutaneous veins for bubbles.\n  3. Take photos of veins with bubbles.\n  4. Sample bubbles*<sup>1</sup>.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: If pneumothorax is suspected, gas sampling could be done by using the vacutainer®, inserting the double pointed needle in between the ribs*<sup>2</sup>. Do not open thoracic cavity\\!\n5. Open first the abdominal cavity carefully \\(try not to cut medium to large size vessels). \n  6.  Examine the mesenteric and renal veins as well as the lumbo-caudal venous plexus for bubbles.\n  7. Take photos of bubbles within vessels.\n  8. Sample bubble’s content “_in situ_” using the insulin syringes*<sup>1</sup>.\n  9. Look for subcapsular emphysema.\n  10. Sample the subcapsular \\(gas) emphysema in situ using the vacutainer®*<sup>2</sup> .\n  11. Sample intestinal gases using the vacutainer*<sup>2</sup>. Preferably take at least three samples from different locations.\n  12.  Open thoracic cavity. If desired, ribs could be disarticulated except the first 3 or 4 cranial ones. These ribs should be cut at 1/3 from the vertebral articulation. \n  **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid cutting large vessels   \n13.  Cut the pericardial sac dorsolaterally \\(making a “window”) to have access to the pericardial veins, keeping the sac for filling up with water after first examination. \n  **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid making the pericardial sac window too large.\n14.  Examine the coronary vessels through the window.\n  15.  Take photos of vessels and bubbles.\n  16.  Sample bubbles*<sup>1</sup>.\n  17.  Fill the pericardial sac with distilled water.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: distilled water is used to prevent atmospheric air contamination.\n18.  Sample the gas from the heart \\(right and left ventricles) using the aspirometer*<sup>3</sup>.\n  19.  Sample the gas from the Aorta and the pulmonary trunk*<sup>3</sup>.\n  20.  Follow up with routine necropsy protocol.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP**: do not cut any systemic vein or sample organs until this step is reached. \n21.  Separate the head from the body. \n  22. You might disarticulate the mandible to have a better access to the pteryoid sacs.\n  23.  Sample pterygoid sacs using the vacutainer®*<sup>2</sup>.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: do not open the sinuses before gas sampling.\n** **<sup>1</sup> Gas sampling from bubbles in veins*\n**CRITICAL STEP**: place the vein under water whenever possible to avoid atmospheric air contamination.\n1. Sample each bubble with a new dispensable insulin syringe \\(BD Plastipak U-100 insulin)\n  2. Inject the content immediately into a new vacutainer® each time.\n  3. Label the vacutainer® with volume recovered and location of the bubble.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: Use one new syringe and one new vacutainer for each bubble.\n**<sup>2</sup> Gas sampling from cavities \\(intestine, pterigoyd air sacs) and gas associated lesions \\(pneumothorax and subcapsular emphysema)**\n1. Couple the vatuainer®  plastic holder to the double pointed needle\n  2. Insert the needle into the cavity\n  3. Push the vacutainer®  against the other end of the needle\n  4. Leave for a few seconds\n  5. Remove the vacutainer®\n  6. Remove the needle\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: If any of theses steps is not done following this sequence, atmospheric air contamination will occur.\n**<sup>3</sup> Gas sampling from the heart cavities using the aspirometer**\n1. Fill up all the aspirometer system with distilled water, including the needle on the top of the burette.\n  2. Remove any bubbles found in the system.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**: If the system is not completely filled with distilled water or if there are bubbles, this air will contaminate your sample\n3. Move up the aspirator bottle to a higher height than the aspirometer level and let water run out from the sampling needle \\(Figure 2).   \n  4. Insert the sampling needle into the heart cavity.",
    "5. Move down the aspirator bottle to a lower height than the aspirometer level.\n  6. Wait for blood alone or blood mixed with gas to be suctioned \\(Figure 3). \n  7. Once no more gas is suctioned, clamp the sampling tube. \n  8. Move the aspirator bottle to the same level as the aspirometer. \\(Gas will separate from the liquid and accumulate in the top of the burette)\n  9. To collect the gas, insert a vacutainer® in the needle at the top of the burette.\n  10.  Open the stopcock.\n  11.  Recover your sample.\n  12.  Close the stopcock.\n  13.  Remove the vacutainer®.\n  14.  Repeat steps 10-13 as many times as necessary to collect all the gas. \n  15.  Measure water temperature in the aspirator bottle.\n  **CRITICAL STEP**:  If steps from 3-13 are not done carefully following this sequence, air contamination will occur.\n**Storage and transport**\n1. Store the samples at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n  2. Store blank tubes with the samples; one blank per sample or a minimum of 3 blanks per animal.\n  3. If samples need to be transported in a plane, they should travel within the passenger cabin to prevent dramatic changes in atmospheric pressure that might alter the vacuum tubes. \n  \n**Gas analyses and calculations**\n1. Analyze a minimum of three blanks per animal.\n  2. Calculate the detection limit for your gases based on the blanks as follows: _S<sub>min</sub>_= _S<sub>blank</sub>+3S<sup>2</sup><sub>blank</sub>_\n   , where _S<sub>min</sub>_ is the minimum detectable signal, _S<sub>blank</sub>_, is the average signal for a given gas in the blanks, and _S<sup>2</sup><sub>blank</sub>_ is the associated standard deviation.\n3. Correct for deviations if the aspirometer is used."
