    "All methods described herein that use experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Chang Gung University (CGU 13-014).\n1. Collect Lumbar DRG from Experimental Rats\nUse 2 to 3 week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats for lumbar DRG collection.\n\tNOTE: DRG neurons collected from rats over 4 weeks of age do not grow well under the culture conditions described herein.\nSterilize all surgical instruments in an autoclave.\nAnesthetize the rat with a 1:1 mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (20 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection (IP)) and wait until the animal shows no foot-withdrawal response in a toe-pinch test.\n\tNOTE: Different anesthesia strategies can be used successfully in this protocol.\nSacrifice the rat by decapitation with a commercial guillotine.\nUse the guillotine to isolate the body trunk of the rat between the forelimb and femur. See Figure 1A for a diagram of the region to be collected.\n\tNOTE: The caudal cut line should be just rostral to the femur. The lumbar L6 DRG will be excised if the cut site is too high in the spinal column.\nCut along the sternum and remove all organs/tissues with dissection scissors (Figure 2A-a).\nCut along the side of trunk to collect the dorsal part of the rat and remove the skin. See Figure 1B for a photograph of the dissected dorsal trunk.\nPrepare the tissue on ice before collecting DRG. Clean the fur and blood from gloves, and sterilize them with 75% ethanol before proceeding to the next step.\nRemove the muscles covering the lumbar spine. First, make two cuts along the sides of the spinal column (left and right) and one lateral cut to mark the rostral extent of the lumbar spine. Then, remove the dorsal muscles of the spine with bone cutting forceps (Figure 2A-b).",
    "Remove the dorsal portion of the vertebrae with bone cutting forceps and expose the spinal cord.\nRemove the spinal cord with dissection scissors (Figure 2A-c) and forceps (Figure 2A-d).\nIdentify the lumbar DRG by counting vertebrae from the last rib (Thoracic Vertebra 13). See Figure 1C for a diagram of the vertebrae positions.\nCollect the bilateral lumbar DRG (L1-L6) with micro-scissors (Figure 2A-f) into a 35-mm culture dish with 2 mL ice-cold serum-free medium. Remove the neuronal fibers (as indicated in Figure 1C) from connecting DRG, then transfer it into the culture dish to improve the purity of the cultures.\n\tNOTE: The collected DRG can be kept in medium on ice for about 1 h. Meanwhile, multiple rats can be euthanized to create a larger pool of DRG.\n2. Primary Culture of Rat Lumber DRG\nNOTE: The following steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1x penicillin/streptomycin in 1x DMEM-F12.\nCoat the cell-culture treated 24-well plate with 200 µg/mL poly-L-lysine for 2 h then wash with sterilized water.\nPre-incubate the culture dish with 1 mL culture medium in a 37 °C CO2 incubator before use for least 30 min.\nTransfer the DRG-containing 35 mm dish into a laminar hood, and wash the DRG with serum-free medium 3 times by pipette.\n\tNOTE: The outside of the dish should be cleaned with 75% ethanol before transferring into the hood. The 35 mm dish can contain DRG from a number of rats (this will depend on the demands of the experimental design).",
    "Move the DRG (from a single rat or combined from multiple rats) to a new 35 mm culture dish, which contains 2 mL of collagenase type IA (1 mg/mL in serum-free medium) with sterile tweezers (Figure 2A-e).\n\tNOTE: The collagenase solution should be sterilized by passing it through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nDigest the DRG in the collagenase solution in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 30 min.\nRemove the collagenase solution and wash the DRG 3 times in 2 mL Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS).\n\tNOTE: There may be residual fibers or tissues that come off the DRG into the solution. Remove them by pipette with the washing solution.\nAdd 2 mL pre-warmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA into the DRG-containing 35 mm dish and digest the DRG in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 30 min.\nTransfer the 2 mL of DRG-containing solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube by glass pipette.\n\tNOTE: The DRG might stick to the glass pipette so this step should be performed with care. DRG loss can be avoided by keeping the DRG-containing solution in the tapered end of a glass pipette (about 0.5 mL) and transferring the solution into the centrifuge tube slowly but without pause.\nCentrifuge the solution at 290 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and add another 2-mL serum-free medium to resuspend the DRG.\nRepeat step 2.10 2 times but change the serum-free medium to pre-warmed culture medium on the last time.\nManually triturate the DRG approximately 60 times using a flame-polished Pasteur pipette (length 230 mm and tip head inner diameter 1 mm). See Figure 2B for a photograph comparing the orifice of a flame-polished Pasteur pipette to a non-polished pipette.",
    "NOTE: The inside diameter of the flame-polished Pasteur pipette is approximately 10% smaller than the control pipette and the inside of the tapered end should be smoother. Be careful not to create bubbles when triturating the cells.\nRemove the poly-L-lysine-coated dish from the CO2 incubator. Aspirate the incubated culture medium from the dish, and seed the dissociated cells onto the coated dish.\nSeed the DRG cells from one rat (bilateral collection from L1-L6, for 12 total DRG) into four wells of a 24-well plate; there are approximately 5 x 104 cells in one well of a 24-well plate.\n\tNOTE: This density is suitable for the detection of the released CGRP or SP and also suitable for immunostaining. For Western blot or RNA extraction, seed the DRG cells from one rat (bilateral L1-L6) into one well of a 6-well plate.\nReplace the culture medium on the following day with the addition of 10 µM cytarabine (Ara-C) and 100 ng/mL NGF, and refresh the medium every two days thereafter.\n\tNOTE: The thoracic DRG also can also be cultured by this protocol, if they have been collected from the thoracic spine.\n3. Transfection of NPFFR2 siRNA in DRG Cells\nPerform the transfection of NPFFR2 siRNA and control siRNA according the manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: The protocol will need to be adapted if the chosen transfection reagent is different from the one we used (see the Table of Materials).\nOn Day 3 after cell plating, change the medium to 0.5 mL pre-warm serum-free medium and incubate the DRG in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 1 h.\nAdd 50 nM of siRNA (in 1 µL RNase-free water) into 12.5 µL serum-free medium.\nAdd 2.5 µL transfection reagent into 10 µL serum-free medium.",
    "Mix the solution from steps 3.3 and 3.4 by pipette, and incubate this mixed transfection solution for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd the transfection solution into one DRG-containing 24-well plate and mix the solution with medium by gentle shaking.\n\tNOTE: Multiple transfection solutions should be deployed at the same time if multiple wells need to be transfected.\nIncubate the DRG in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 6 h.\nAdd 0.5 mL/well of culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1x penicillin/streptomycin in 1x DMEM-F12, with the addition of 10 µM Ara-C and 100 ng/mL NGF, into the 24-well plate.\nIncubate the DRG in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for another 66 h (refresh the medium at 48 h).\n4. Release of Neurotransmitters from Primary DRG Cells\nOn Day 6 after cells were plated (72 h after siRNA transfection), change the culture medium to 200 µL serum-free medium, and incubate the cells in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 30 min.\nAdd 1 µL stimulation chemical(s) and gently mix the media by pipetting. Incubate the dish in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for the designated time.\n\tNOTE: In this article, the cultured cells were stimulated with the NPFFR2 agonist, dNPA (D.Asn-Pro-(N-Me)Ala-Phe-Leu-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Arg- Phe-NH2, 5 nmol), for 1 h.\nCollect the culture medium from the culture dish and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove any suspended impurities.\nCollect the supernatant from the centrifugation and dilute the samples with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), as needed. Assay the levels of neurotransmitters with enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits.\n\tNOTE: Here, the supernatants were diluted 1:100 before analyzing the level of CGRP. The supernatant was not diluted before analyzing the level of SP.\n5. CGRP and SP EIA",
    "Analyze the samples immediately according to the CGRP or SP EIA kit manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: The protocol will vary depending on the kit used.\nRinse the CGRP EIA wells 5 times with wash buffer supplied within the kit.\nAdd 100 µL samples with 100 µL anti-CGRP acetylcholinesterase (AChE) tracer into the CGRP EIA wells, and add 50 µL samples, 50 µL anti-SP AChE tracer and 50 µL anti-SP antiserum into the SP EIA wells.\nSeal the CGRP and SP wells with plastic film which is supplied within the kits.\nIncubate the wells overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the wells 5 times with CGRP or SP wash buffer and remove all the residual solution from the wells.\nAdd 200 µL Ellman's reagent into the CGRP or SP wells which is supplied within the corresponding EIA kits.\nIncubate the CGRP wells for 30 min at room temperature, and incubate the SP wells for 90 min at room temperature. Protect the wells from light for both assays.\nRead the plates at wavelength 414 nm and calculate the results according to the corresponding EIA instrument.\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the bottom of the wells by hand all the time and clean the water stains from the well bottom by lens cleaning wipes before adding the Ellman's reagent.\nSubscription Required.
