    "During DCIS, a premalignant stage in breast cancer, cells remain within the basement membrane and the myoepithelial cell layer, but invasive cells start to grow into the duct. This stage is also accompanied by deposition, linearization, and thickening of collagen I fibers, resulting in increased ECM stiffness (Kaushik et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0013]). Progression to IDC from DCIS involves the breach of tumor cells through the basement membrane and further stiffness of the surrounding ECM. To model DCIS and the first stage in mammary cancer progression, we demonstrate a method for growing uniform spheroids with an intact basement membrane surrounding the spheroid. For the purpose of this protocol, we use two cell lines (MCF10A and MDA-231BO) to show the method and the possible variability of the basement membrane surrounding the spheroids. MDA-231BO cells (Yoneda, Williams, Hiraga, Niewolna, & Nishimura, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0023]) were a gift from Dr. Kandice Tanner.\nMaterials\nCell lines and culture media:\n               \nMCF10A cells (ATCC, cat. no.

CLS7007)\nHumidified incubator at 37°C with 10% CO2\nBenchtop centrifuge for plates (e.g., Eppendorf 5810R) at room temperature\nDay 1\n1. Using a multichannel pipettor, seed 2000 cells per well in sterile ultra-low-attachment U-bottom 96-well plates. Culture for 8-16 hr in a humidified 37°C, 10% CO2 incubator.\nCalculate the number of cells needed based on a final volume of 200 μl per well. Include enough for at least ten extra wells when using a multichannel pipettor.\nDay 2",
    "2. Centrifuge plates for 5 min at 18 × g, 25°C to initiate aggregation of cells within each well.\n3. Incubate at 37°C for 2 days to allow cells to grow and form more compact aggregates.\nDay 3\n4. Thaw Matrigel basement membrane matrix by leaving it overnight at 4°C in the back of a refrigerator or in a cold room.\nMatrigel can begin to polymerize and form small clumps if not thawed slowly overnight. The process described above ensures that the Matrigel will thaw gradually and yield a homogeneous solution when added to the wells. Leaving pipette tips in the refrigerator overnight for handling the Matrigel also helps ensure that the Matrigel will not polymerize prematurely during pipetting.\nDay 4\n5. Remove 100 μl medium from each well using a multichannel pipettor, being careful to touch the pipet tips to the inside wall of each well before slowly aspirating.\n6. Prepare a 10% (v/v) Matrigel solution by diluting the stock in ice-cold supplemented DMEM/F12 medium (concentration 7.1 mg/ml).\n7. Pipet 100 μl of 10% Matrigel into each well, making the final Matrigel concentration 5% compared to the original stock.\n8. Centrifuge plates for 5 min at 18 × g 25°C.\nIt is important to centrifuge plates at 25°C. Centrifuging at 4°C during this step will result in patchy assembly of basement membrane around the spheroids.\n9. Return to incubator and allow spheroids to grow for 2 days after addition of Matrigel.\nYou should see formation of very round spheroids the next day, but 2 days are needed to ensure adequate assembly of basement membrane components around the spheroids. If you let spheroids grow for only 1 day, the basement membrane will look patchy when immunostained.",
    "During cancer progression, invasive cancer cells invade through the basement membrane and migrate through the ECM microenvironment, which generally consists primarily of collagen type I protein. DCIS has been shown to form in more mammographically dense tissue with increased collagen density (Ursin et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0020]). Collagen I is known to be a cellular signaling and proliferative molecule, as shown by the Keely lab (Provenzano et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0017]), but linear collagen type I in the ECM can also act as a highway on which invasive cancer cells can crawl and migrate (Fang, Yuan, Peng, & Li, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0010]; Provenzano et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0016]). Here, we describe a method for embedding 3D tumor spheroids with an intact basement membrane in a collagen type I gel for invasion studies.\nBefore beginning, the detailed protocols of Dr. Andrew Doyle are used to isolate rat tail collagen I (see Current Protocols article: Doyle, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0008]), label collagen gels (Doyle, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0009]), and acid wash and activate MatTek dishes by silanization (see Current Protocols article: Doyle, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0007]) to ensure that the collagen gels remain adherent to the bottom of the dish and that cells do not preferentially adhere directly to the dish. It is critical that these protocols be followed exactly.\nMaterials\nDulbecco's PBS with calcium and magnesium (DPBS; HyClone, cat. no. SH30264.02)\n6.0 mg/ml rat tail collagen stock solution in 20 mM acetic acid (see Current Protocols article: Doyle, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0008])\n10× DMEM (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-rec-0001])\n10× reconstitution buffer (RB; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-rec-0003])\n1 N NaOH (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-rec-0002])\n96-well U-bottom plate with spheroids (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0001])\nHanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; Current Protocols, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0004])\nCulture medium (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0001])\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube\nCeramic tile (large enough for a MatTek dish)\nPositive-displacement pipettors and pipet tips\npH strips (e.g., MColorpHast, pH range 6.5-10, Millipore-Sigma, cat. no. 1.09543.0001)\nInverted microscope",
    "MatTek dishes (35 mm, no. 1.5 coverslip, 20-mm opening; cat. no. P35G-1.5-20-C), acid-washed and silanized (see Current Protocols article: Doyle, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-bib-0007])\nHumidified incubator at 37°C with 10% CO2\nPrepare neutralized collagen\n1. Place a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and a ceramic tile in a rectangular ice dish to chill. Also place DPBS, collagen stock solution, and aliquots of 10× DMEM, 10× RB, 1 N NaOH, and 1 N HCl on ice.\nThe tile will provide a smooth surface on which the MatTek dishes will be placed on ice and kept cold. The tube will be used for neutralizing the acidic collagen solution.\n2. Calculate the volume of 6.0 mg/ml stock collagen (Vcollagen) needed to give 200 μl per dish of 4 mg/ml neutralized collagen. For two dishes:\n         \nVcollagen × 6.0 mg/ml = 400 μl × 4.0 mg/ml\nVcollagen = 266.7 μl collagen\nTransfer this amount of stock collagen to the prechilled 1.5-ml tube using a positive-displacement pipettor and tip.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure to keep the tube of collagen on ice at all times.\n3. Add 1/10th volume of 10× DMEM and 10× RB (40 μl each), and mix well by pipetting up and down.\n4. Centrifuge by pulsing for 10 s to remove any bubbles.\nIt is okay to have bubbles when the collagen is mixed, as long as they are completely removed by centrifugation.\n5. Add an initial 6 μl of 1 N NaOH, mix well, and test the pH by putting a small drop on a pH strip and waiting 1-2 min for the pH to change. Adjust the pH until it is between 7.0 and 7.4 and the solution has a peach tint.",
    "The solution will turn bright red when NaOH is first added, but should turn orange/peach as the solution is mixed. If the color goes back to yellow, add 1 N NaOH in 1-μl increments until it is peach color. If the pH exceeds 7.4, lower it using 1 N HCl. Keep track of the volumes of NaOH and HCl added, as the volume of DPBS will need to be adjusted accordingly.\nThe required volume of NaOH will depend on the particular collagen preparation as well as the final desired concentration and volume of collagen.\n6. Calculate the volume of DPBS (VDPBS) needed to reach the desired collagen concentration:\n         \nVDPBS = Vfinal – Vcollagen – VDMEM – VRB – VNaOH\nVDPBS = 400 – 266.7 – 40 – 40 – VNaOH\nAdd this volume of ice-cold DPBS to the neutralized collagen.\nEmbed spheroids in collagen gel\n7. Remove a 96-well U-bottom plate with spheroids from the incubator and examine all spheroids under an inverted microscope to ensure that they have formed tight, compact spheres rather than loose aggregates. Mark wells in which the cells are not spherical using a lab marker to avoid transferring them to the collagen gel.\n8. Gently aspirate 100 μl medium from one well, making sure to gently touch the pipette tip to the wall of the well without disturbing the spheroid. Add 100 μl HBSS to the well to wash the spheroid.\n9. Repeat two more times to ensure that the spheroid is adequately washed.\n10. Cut off the tip of a 200-μl pipette tip using a sharp, sterile razor blade.\nThe blade can be sprayed with 70% ethanol to sterilize it.\n11. Place an acid-washed and silanized MatTek dish on the cold tile for ∼1 min to cool the bottom of the dish.",
    "Cooling the dish will keep the gel from starting to polymerize right away. The dish should not be left on the cold tile for more than 3-4 min, however, because it will start to accumulate condensation.\n12. Gently aspirate the washed spheroid into the cut pipette tip, bring it to the very tip by expelling the medium between the spheroid and the tip, and then expel the spheroid into the neutralized collagen.\nThis process minimizes the volume of medium transferred to the neutralized collagen.\nMultiple spheroids can be added to one MatTek dish. To keep the concentration of collagen consistent, an equal number of spheroids should be added to each dish.\n13. Using the same cut tip, transfer 200 μl neutralized collagen with spheroid(s) to the center of an activated MatTek dish. Spread the gel with the pipet tip so that it covers the entire bottom of the dish and check under an inverted microscope to ensure that there are no air bubbles at the edges of the glass circle.\n14. Place the dish in a 37°C incubator for 30 min to allow the collagen gel to polymerize.\n15. When the gel is opaque (indicating that it has polymerized), slowly add 2 ml warm medium to the dish by touching the pipette tip to the wall of the dish and slowly releasing the medium.\nDo not add less than 1 ml medium, as the medium can evaporate quickly in the incubator. Be careful not to disrupt the gel, because liquid can travel under the gel through small gaps, causing the collagen gel to pop off the coverslip.\n16. Change the medium every 2 days by removing 2 ml and adding 2 ml fresh warm medium. Be very careful when aspirating medium from the dishes to avoid dislodging the collagen gel.",
    "For an easier approach to embedding the spheroids and controlling the distance at which the spheroids are situated above the glass bottom of the dish, one can sandwich the spheroid between two layers of collagen gel. Here, the bottom layer is fully polymerized, the spheroid is placed on top of this layer, and then the top layer is added over the spheroid and polymerized. It is important to note that some cell types can anomalously migrate along the horizontal plane between the two layers of collagen, rather than migrating outward in all dimensions through the gel. Other cell types, such as fibroblasts, will migrate outward easily into the collagen gels.\nSee Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0002] for all materials.\n1. Prepare neutralized collagen (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0002], steps 1-6).\n2. Place a MatTek dish on the cold tile for ∼1 min to chill.\n3. Place 60 μl neutralized collagen in the center of the dish and spread it with the pipet tip so that it completely covers the glass surface.\n4. Place the dish in the 37°C incubator for 30 min for the collagen to polymerize.\n5. Check spheroids and wash three times with HBSS (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0002], steps 7-9).\n6. Using a cut 200-μl pipette tip, gently aspirate a spheroid and place it in the center of the MatTek dish, on top of the polymerized collagen (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0002], steps 10 and 12).\n7. Pipette 140 μl neutralized collagen onto the spheroid and tilt the dish to spread the collagen around the surface of the dish.\n8. Return the dish to the incubator for 30 min for the collagen to polymerize.\n9. Add warm medium to the dish and culture cells, changing the medium every 2 days (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.105#cpcb105-prot-0002], steps 15-16).",
    "One of the advantages of 3D spheroids embedded in a hydrogel is that the spheroid can be easily immunostained to study the individual or collective migration of its cells into its surrounding ECM.

Remove the medium from each MatTek dish slowly by tilting the dish to one side, and, using a 1-ml pipette tip, carefully aspirate and remove the medium completely from the dish.\nDo not keep the dishes out too long at room temperature. After removal of the growth medium, immediately move to the next step. Cells can retract their protrusions if they are left out of 37°C for too long.",
    "3. Immediately add the fixative solution from step 1 by slowly pipetting 2 ml down the wall of the MatTek dishes. Use a P1000 single-channel pipettor and 1000-µl pipet tip. Leave for 1 hr at 37°C.\n4. Aspirate the fixative solution and discard properly.\n5. Wash with DPBS three times for 15 min each and leave the dishes on the rocker each time.\n6. Freshly prepare a 0.5% Triton X-100 permeabilization solution in DPBS, add this to the MatTek dish, and leave on the dishes overnight in a 4°C cold room on the rocker.\n7. Wash three times with DPBS. Each time gently rock the dishes using the rocker.\n8. Prepare a blocking solution consisting of 5% donkey serum in DPBS, and add 500 μl per well of the blocking solution in each of the MatTek dishes.\n9. Prepare a primary antibody solution based on the manufacturer's recommended concentration. Here we prepare a 1:200 solution of collagen IV antibody in DPBS (optional: add 5% donkey serum to the antibody solution). Leave on a rocker for 4 hr at room temperature or at 4°C in cold room, overnight.\n10. Aspirate and wash away unbound primary antibody with DPBS three times, 15 min each time on the rocker, at room temperature.\n11. Prepare a secondary antibody solution by diluting donkey anti-goat 647 immunofluorescent secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution in DPBS. Also add DAPI (1:200 dilution) and phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200 dilution) to this secondary antibody immunostaining solution. Leave the secondary antibody in the MatTek dishes for 4 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in cold room.\n12. Wash three times with DPBS. Each time gently rock the dishes using the rocker. After the last wash, put them in 1-2 ml of DPBS.",
    "You can store the dishes in 4°C for 3-4 days, but make sure to place them in a petri dish with the lid on, and parafilm the outside to keep the gels from drying out.\n13. Image the spheroids using a confocal microscope."
