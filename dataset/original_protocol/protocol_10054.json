    "1. General Instructions and Precautions\nSelect suitable, undamaged measuring/mixing glassware (flasks, beakers, etc.) and other labware (spatulas, scoops, etc.) for use.\nHandle glassware carefully to avoid damaging, and wear latex or nitrile gloves to avoid contaminating the glassware/labware with residues from fingertips and to protect your skin.\nClean chosen glassware/labware thoroughly using detergent solution and water by scrubbing with a soft bottle brush until clean and all residues are removed.\nRinse thoroughly with tap water and then with deionized (DI) water. Place on drying rack to air dry.\nOptional: Rinse the cleaned glassware/labware with isopropyl (IPA, 99.5%) and place under vacuum to evaporate all residual IPA to ensure they are free of any contaminants (~2 h). Remove from vacuum chamber and place in clean environment.\n\tNOTE: Use lint-free wipes for wiping glassware and labware. Purchase and use sterile small glass vials and safe-lock tubes for materials preparation and sample storage. For further details on glassware cleaning and other laboratory standard operating procedures, refer to the JoVE Science Education Database28.\n2. Preparation of Aqueous Buffer Solution \nWearing latex or nitrile gloves, select an appropriate and clean glass container to prepare 50 mL of aqueous buffer (500 mM sodium chloride (KCl), 10 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.0).\nUsing a digital, high precision mass balance and a clean spatula, dispense 1.86378 g of KCl onto clean weighing paper and then add to the glass container.\n\tNOTE: The amounts of KCl and MOPS should vary depending on the desired volume and desired final concentrations.\nWeigh 0.10463 g of MOPS and add to the glass container. Then, add 50 mL of DI water to the glass container and vortex thoroughly until KCl and MOPS are completely dissolved.\nStore the buffer solution at room temperature and use when needed.",
    "NOTE: While buffer solutions can be stored for relatively long periods of time, it is recommended to use freshly prepared buffer solutions for better and more consistent results.\n3. Preparation of Liposomes \nNOTE: Step 3.1 only applies if phospholipids are acquired as lyophilized powders, and therefore, may be skipped if the phospholipids are purchased in chloroform.\nDissolve 5 mg of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) or Brain Total Lipid Extracts (BTLE) lipids in 1 mL of chloroform in a 5 mL sterile glass vial.\nWhile gently swirling, evaporate the chloroform under a gentle stream of dry nitrogen until a lipid film remains at the bottom of the vial.\nPlace the vial containing the lipid film under vacuum for 10-12 h to allow for complete removal of residual chloroform.  \nRemove the vial from the vacuum chamber and rehydrate the lipid film by adding 10 mL of the aqueous buffer solution prepared in Step 2 to achieve a final lipid concentration of 2 mg/mL.\nFreeze (-20 °C) and completely thaw the lipid suspension six times to facilitate multilamellar liposome assembly.\n\tNOTE: Let the mixture thaw at room temperature, never in a heated environment.\nUsing a commercially available extruder, extrude the liposome solution by forcing the complete lipid suspension through a 0.1 μm pore diameter track-etched membrane. Extrude the suspension 11 times in immediate succession to obtain unilamellar liposomes with diameters of c.a. 100 nm needed for proper lipid monolayer formation. Store the liposome suspension at 4 °C and use within 1 week of preparation. For simplicity, refer to the resulting liposome solution as “A”.",
    "NOTE: For the extrusion of BTLE liposomes, the researcher is encouraged to warm up the extruder to 45-50 °C, higher than the phase transition temperature of BTLE lipids (~ 37 °C)23,29, to enable easier extrusion. Hydrated BTLE liposome suspensions can also be directly prepared (in place of freeze-thaw and extrusion) by placing the closed suspension vial into in a bath sonicator at 55 °C for ~15 min.\n4. Reconstitution of Alamethicin Peptides \nNOTE: This procedure describes the process of alamethicin reconstitution in liposomes to a final concentration of 1 μM. This concentration is sufficient to induce nA-level currents similar to those previously published12. Increasing the peptide concentration will reduce the switching threshold and increase the amplitudes of currents induced by applied voltage29.\nDissolve alamethicin peptides in ethanol to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, vortex briefly to mix well, and store the stock solution in freezer (-20 °C).\n\t​NOTE: Alamethicin peptides are usually purchased in powder form.\nIn a 1.5 mL safe-lock tube, mix 99 μL of solution “A” with 1 μL of alamethicin stock solution to achieve a final alamethicin concentration of 13 μM in the liposome suspension.  Vortex to mix well. Refer to the resulting peptide-liposome solution as “B”.\nMix 117 μL of solution “A” with 10 μL of solution B to achieve a final alamethicin concentration of 1 μM, and then vortex to mix well. Refer to the resulting solution as “C”.\nStore the solutions “B” and “C” at 4 °C and use as needed.\n5. Preparation of Agarose gel\nUsing a digital, high precision mass balance and a clean spatula, add 0.5 g of agarose powder to a clean weighing paper.\nTransfer weighed agarose to a 100-mL clean glass beaker and add 50 mL of DI water to the agarose.",
    "NOTE: This will yield a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel solution.\nPlace a clean stirring magnet inside the glass beaker and place the beaker on a stirring hot plate.\nWhile stirring, bring the mixture to a boil until agarose is completely dissolved.\nRemove the beaker from the hot plate to let the mixture cool to room temperature. Store at 4 °C and use when needed.\nBefore using again, re-melt the agarose by heating with a hot plate or microwave.\n6. Fabrication of the Oil Reservoir\nNOTE: The procedure described below is just one of many ways that an oil reservoir can be fabricated. The reader is encouraged to design and fabricate a reservoir based on available materials, machining capabilities, and specific needs.\nUsing a band saw, cut a 12 x 12 x 12 mm acrylic cube from a larger 12 mm thick acrylic sheet.\nMill a 12 mm diameter hole to a depth of 8-12 mm in the acrylic tube (Figure 1a).\n7. Preparation of Electrodes \nUsing scissors, cut two pieces (75 mm) of silver wires (125 μm-diameter).\nUsing an open-flame lighter, melt one end of each silver wire to form small spherical balls (around 250 μm in diameter).\nImmerse the ball ends in bleach for 1-2 h to create a silver silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) coating. A dark gray color indicates that the Ag/AgCl coating has formed (Figure 2a).\nRemove both wires from bleach, rinse thoroughly with DI water and place aside on a clean lint-free wipe.\nDip the ball ends into molten agarose gel to create a thin layer. This gel coating helps to anchor the aqueous droplets onto the wires under oil.  \nUsing a glass cutter, split a 10-cm long, 1/0.58 OD/ID mm borosilicate glass capillary into two 5 cm capillaries.",
    "Insert one of the glass capillaries into an electrode holder (Figure 2b, c), and then feed one of the Ag/AgCl wire into the glass capillary (Figure 2d). Feed the other Ag/AgCl wire into the second glass capillary.\nMount the second glass capillary to a glass micropipette holder (Figure 2e, f).\n8. Setting Up the Experiment \nPlace a 1 mm thick, 25 x 75 mm glass slide on the stage of an inverted microscope (Figure 1a).\nDispense a few drops of hexadecane oil onto the center of the glass slide, and then place the oil reservoir directly onto the oil on the glass slide.\n\tNOTE: Adding oil between the glass slide and oil reservoir is used to match the refractive index of the substrate to provide clearer and sharper images.\nCompletely fill the oil reservoir with hexadecane oil. Make sure the reservoir is positioned above the objective lens.\n\tNOTE: Other hydrophobic oils may be used as well.\nConnect the electrode holder to the headstage of a current amplifier. The headstage must be mounted on a micromanipulator (Figure 1a) to minimize electrode length and electrical noise.\nMount the glass micropipette holder with the second Ag/AgCl wire onto another micromanipulator (Figure 1a).\nUsing the manipulators, position the electrodes such that the agarose coated tips of the Ag/AgCl wires are fully submerged into the oil reservoir at a similar vertical plane.\nAlign the two electrodes and separate them by a few millimeters (Figure 1a, b).\n\tNOTE: After adding the droplets (described in Step 13), the wires must be brought all the way down until the electrode tips are touching the bottom of the oil reservoir. This step will ensure that the wires do not oscillate, and thus, will minimize unnecessary fluctuations in the measured current.\n9. Proper Grounding to Reduce Electrical Noise",
    "Create a Ground bus by threading a screw into the anti-vibration table on which the microscope is placed (Figure 3a).\n\tNOTE: Using an anti-vibration table is required to minimize vibrations from the surrounding, which might cause undesired fluctuations in measured current.\nUsing a conductive wire, connect the screw to an earth ground (Figure 3a), and then connect the microscope stage to the Ground bus.\nPlace a Faraday cage over the experimental setup to reduce noise and then electrically connect it to the Ground bus (Figure 3b).\n\tNOTE: It is always recommended to avoid unnecessary ground loops, as they may lead to an increase in measurement noise level.\n10. Feedback-Controlled Heating \nMachine an aluminum heating shell in which the oil reservoir can snugly fit29.\nMake sure to leave an opening at the bottom of the shell to be able to view through the shell via the inverted microscope.\nPlace a 30 x 30 mm resistive polyimide flexible heating element underneath the aluminum shell.\nPlace an insulating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) wafer beneath the heater to reduce heat loss in the downward direction and protect the microscope stage.\nInsert a thermocouple into the oil phase. After making sure the thermocouple does not touch either Ag/AgCl wire, connect the thermocouple wires to a thermocouple data acquisition board and record temperature using custom programming software.\n\tNOTE: Write an On-Off, proportional integral (PI) feedback temperature control to enable heating and passive cooling of the oil temperature to a desired value. Codes can be provided to readers upon request.\n11. Setting Up the Software and Equipment \nPrepare the data acquisition software by powering on computer(s), microscope, function generator, current amplifier, and low-noise data acquisition systems.",
    "NOTE: While any current sensing equipment may be used, the following instructions are specifically for the one listed in Table of Materials. Researchers who wish to build their own current amplifier can refer to Shlyonsky et al.30.\nOn the front panel of the patch clamp current amplifier, set the front panel display and source-measurement Mode dials to VHOLD/IHOLD and V-CLAMP, respectively.\nOn the front panel, set the Lowpass Bessel Filter to 1 kHz and Output Gain to 0.5.\n\tNOTE: Choosing a low output gain enables recording larger higher current amplitudes, whereas increasing the gain sacrifices measurement range for reduce measurement noise.\nSet the Configuration to WHOLE CELL β = 1. This value may be later switched to 0.1 to allow recording of larger amplitude currents.\nSet all other control dials to zero or in a neutral position.\nInitialize the software by double-clicking on the icon of the desktop.\nClick Configuration | Digitizer to open the Digitizer dialog, and then click the Change button.\nIn the Change Digitizer dialog, select the appropriate digitizer from the Digitizer Type list.\nClick the Scan button to detect the digitizer.\nClick OK to exit the Change Digitizer dialog, and then click OK to exit the Digitizer dialog.\nClick Configure | Lab Bench.\nIn the Input Signals tab of the Lab Bench, set the scale factor to 0.0005 V/pA.\n\tNOTE: This value must be updated if the gain or β values are changed.\n12. Pipette Offset \nNOTE: The procedure described below applies only to current amplifier mentioned in Table of Materials.\nUsing a micropipette, deposit 200 nL of the aqueous lipid solution “A” onto the ends of each Ag/AgCl wire under oil.",
    "Bring the droplets into contact and press the ZAP button on the front panel of the amplifier to coalesce the droplets into one volume spanning both electrodes. This should induce a short-circuit response.\nSet source-measurement mode dial to TRACK.\nChange the front panel display dial to VTRACK.\nTurn the PIPETTER OFFSET dial (clockwise or counterclockwise) until meter reads 0 mV and is stable. \nReturn the source-measurement mode dial to V-CLAMP and the front panel display dial to VHOLD/IHOLD.\n13. Formation of the Lipid Bilayer \nRelease the droplets that were previously deposited by moving the electrodes vertically out of the oil phase. This causes the droplets to fall from the electrodes into the oil. Re-submerge and position the electrodes in oil.\nUse the micropipette to deposit 200 nL of lipid solution “A” on each of the wires.\nWait for 3-5 min to allow for spontaneous lipid monolayer assembly to occur at each water/oil interface.\n\tNOTE: As the lipid monolayer forms, the water/lipid/oil interface surface tension decreases, which can cause the droplets to sag if the surrounding oil is sufficiently less dense21.\nLower the electrodes (and droplets) until the ends of both electrodes barely touch the bottom of the oil reservoir (Figure 1b), and then move them horizontally to bring the droplets into contact.\n\tNOTE: The lipid bilayer will spontaneously thin by excluding excess oil from between the contacting droplets. Typically, this process occurs within 1 min.\n14. Electrical Characterization of the Biomolecular Memristor\nLipid Bilayer Formation\n\t\nTo record the lipid bilayer formation, which corresponds to an increase in electrical capacitance between droplets, apply a 10 Hz, 10 mV triangular waveform voltage using a function generator (Figure 4) connected to the external input of the patch clamp amplifier.",
    "NOTE: Due to the capacitive nature of the lipid membrane, the resulting current response should be a square waveform (Figure 4). During the lipid bilayer formation, Step 11.6, the researcher should see a growth in the peak-to-peak current amplitude and also observe a visual change between connected droplets (Figure 4).\nCurrent-voltage measurements\n\tNOTE: The biomolecular memristor is modeled as a resistor and a capacitor in parallel12,21. Therefore, the current response of the device can contain both resistive and capacitive components depending on the frequency of the applied voltage. To study the memristive nature of the device, and to obtain the pinched hysteretic current-voltage relationship12, it may be necessary to subtract capacitive current from the total current. The protocol below describes this procedure.\n\t\nUsing a function generator, apply a voltage waveform (triangular or sinusoidal) to an alamethicin-free lipid membrane assembled with droplets of solution “A”.\nRecord the induced current response across multiple frequencies.\n\t\tNOTE: Capacitive currents are minimized at frequencies below 10 mHz.\nRecord the size of the interfacial lipid bilayer by either measuring the diameter of the lipid membrane on computer, or by recording the peak-to-peak current amplitude resulting from the 10 Hz, 10 mV triangular wave. The current amplitude is proportional to the membrane capacitance, which in turn is proportional to the area of the membrane.\nRemove the droplets that contain no alamethicin.\nAdd new aqueous droplets using solution “C” and form a lipid bilayer.\nUse the micromanipulators to adjust contact between droplets such that the bilayer has a similar area (diameter or square-wave current amplitude) as the one formed earlier.\nRepeat steps 14.2.1 and 14.2.2.\nSubtract current recorded in step 14.2.2 from current recorded in step 14.2.7.\nPlot the induced current versus applied voltage for each frequency and waveform to obtain the “pinched hysteresis” memristive response.\nPulse experiments",
    "Using a custom programming software and analog voltage source, generate voltage pulses with specific high and low amplitudes, ON time, and OFF time.\n\t\tNOTE: This is not needed if the voltage pulses could be generated using a commercial function generator.\nRecord the current in response to applied pulses.  \nDue to the capacitive nature of the memristor, capacitive spikes will be recorded. Remove spikes by applying a low-pass filter with appropriate passband.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
