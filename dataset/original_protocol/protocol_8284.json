    "1. Production of Recombinant Uncoupling Proteins (UCPs) and the Formation of Planar Bilayer Membranes\nProduce recombinant UCP1 and UCP3 as described by Rupprecht et al.9 and Hilse et al.10\nForm planar bilayer membranes on the tips of conventional dispensable plastic pipettes as described by Beck et al.7\n2. Preparation of the Micro-agar Salt Bridge Electrode\nAdjust a microcapillary pipette tip (see Table of Materials) to the appropriate length.\n\t\nMark the position on an empty tip at which the buffer-containing tip will be attached to and use a sliding caliper to measure the length of the micro-agar salt bridge electrode.\n\t\tCAUTION: The microcapillary tip must be long enough to enter the buffer solution for the measurements.\nCut the microcapillary tip with a sharp knife or blade and clean the cut surface with ethanol and water.\nPrepare the AgCl-coated electrode.\n\t\nCut off an Ag wire of approximately 8 cm in length and clean it with ethanol and water.\nTake a piece of sandpaper and smooth down the surface of 1 cm length at the end of the wire, which should be in contact with the salt solution.\nDip the smoothed end into a 3 M KCl solution and coat it electrochemically with chloride by using a DC supply at 1.5 V for 10 s.\nClean the electrode with water, dry it, and adjust the length of the AgCl electrode from the uncoated side so that it penetrates the microcapillary tip as deep as possible.\n\t\tNote: The protocol can be paused here.\nPrepare a 3 M KCl salt solution with 1% (v/v) agarose.\n\t\nWeigh out 4.47 g of KCl and dissolve it in 20 mL of water by stirring it in a flask.\nRemove the stirrer, weigh out 0.2 g of agarose, and add it to the flask.",
    "Heat up the solution to 100 °C to melt the agarose and prevent it from clotting.\n\t\tCAUTION: The flask will be very hot. Do not touch it with bare hands. Use gloves for handling.\nFill the microcapillary tip with the agarose salt solution.\n\t​CAUTION: The solution is hot. Protect hands and work carefully to avoid splashes.\n\t\nIf the agarose starts clotting, heat up the salt solution to fully melt the agarose again.\nSoak 10 µL of the agar salt solution into the microcapillary tip. Soak it slowly and carefully to avoid air bubbles in the tip.\nRemove the tip from the pipette and push in the AgCl electrode from the broader side of the tip. Ensure that the electrode penetrates the salt solution.\nCool down the electrode to room temperature and plug it into the amplifier.\nPrepare the buffer for the measurements.\n\t\nWeigh out 0.710 g of Na2SO4, 0.195 g of MES, 0.121 g of TRIS, and 0.023 g of EGTA, then add 100 mL of distilled water to a beaker and stir the solution.\nCheck for the pH value of the buffer by using a pH electrode and adjust the pH value to 7.32.\nCheck that the reference electrode and the agar salt bridge electrode are in electrical contact.\n\t\t\nAdd 1 mL of buffer to a plastic container.\nDip in the reference electrode and the agar salt bridge electrode and check for a signal response. If the signal response is correct, proceed to step 2.7.\nIf there is a false signal response or no electrical contact at all, perform the following troubleshooting.\n\t\nCheck if the electrode is in contact with the salt solution and push the electrode into the solution.\n\t\tNote: If the solution is already too sticky, remove the micro-agar salt bridge and prepare a new microcapillary tip.",
    "Check if there are air bubbles within the salt solution. If yes, prepare a new microcapillary tip.\nCheck if the salt solution is in contact with the buffer solution. If not, then cut off another 1 mm of the tube end of the tip.\n\t\tCAUTION: Be sure that the tip is still long enough to penetrate the buffer-containing tip. If there is still no contact, prepare a new microcapillary tip.\nIf none of these steps help, prepare a new microcapillary tip.\nFor storage, dip the agar salt bridge electrode into a 3 M KCl solution.\n\tNote: The protocol can be stopped here. For a pause overnight, store the electrode in 3 M KCl salt solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare the buffer-containing plastic tip.\n\tNote: If the electrode was stored overnight, take it out and let it heat up to room temperature for 30 min.\n\t\nTake a microcapillary tip and bend the tube, 2 cm from the edge of the narrow part, approximately 90 degrees using a heating wire.\nUse a very sharp knife or blade and cut off the tube around 5 mm from the bend.\nClean the surface at the end with ethanol and water and measure the diameter of the hole of the tip. From this, calculate the area of the surface.\nCoat the surface of the tip with 85:15 (v:v) hexane:hexadecane.\n\t\t\nPipette 3 µL of the solvent and remove it from the tip.\nWait 1 min so that all of the residual solvent in the tip has evaporated.\nFill the measurement tip with 3 µL of buffer and plug it onto the salt bridge electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Check again if the salt bridge electrode and the reference electrode are in electrical contact by performing step 2.5.3.\nIf there is no electrical contact, check for the following:",
    "Check whether the salt bridge electrode is in contact with the buffer solution. If not, then either increase the volume of the buffer in the tip or prepare a longer microcapillary tip.\nIf there is an air bubble, remove the tip from the micro-salt bridge electrode, refill the buffer in the tip, and plug it into the electrode again.\n3. Measurement of the Electrical Parameters of the Membrane Reconstituted with Recombinant Protein\nApply a triangular alternating voltage signal with maximal voltage Umax = 50 mV and ΔTramp = 50 ms, which creates a rectangular alternating current response. From the mean values of the positive and negative currents (I+ and I-), calculate the capacity of the membrane according to the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq1v2.jpg\nApply a voltage ramp ranging from -50 mV to +50 mV and record the current. Fit a linear function to the data - the slope is the conductance - and calculate the x-axis intersection point of the fit.\nDischarge the solution in the plastic tip and fill a new one with a buffer containing an increased substrate concentration.\n\t\nIf no membrane is formed within the first 20 - 30 s, discharge the volume and refill it. This guarantees that the concentration gradient across the membrane does not significantly change during the membrane formation.\nAfter the formation of a membrane, perform steps 3.1 and 3.2 again to verify proper membrane formation and to get the x-axis intersection point.\n4. Calculation of the Substrate Turnover Rate\nNOTE: See previous work for details3,7.\nEstimate the amount of protein in the membrane from the molecular mass of lipid and protein (MLipid and MProtein), the area of the membrane and of one lipid head group (AMembrane and ALipid), and the mass ratio of the protein per lipid (r).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq2v2.jpg",

R is the gas constant, T the temperature, z the charge of the transported substrate, F the Faraday's constant, and c1 and c2 the concentrations of the substrate of both sides of the membrane.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq3v3.jpg\nFrom the current-voltage recordings, take the reverse potential calculated with the difference of the x-axis intersection points from the linear fits in the presence and absence of the substrate gradient.\nCalculate the proportion of substrate conductance, GSubstrate, to the total membrane conductance, Gtotal, by the ratio of reverse potential to Nernst potential11.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq4v2.jpg\nCalculate the substrate turnover number ΔNSubstrate per time unit ΔT from the substrate conductance (GSubstrate), the applied voltage U, and the charge of the substrate z:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq5v2.jpg\nFrom the ratio of transported substrate per time to the number of proteins, calculate the turnover rate κ.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58552/58552eq6v2.jpg"
