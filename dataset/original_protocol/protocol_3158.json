A single confluent 10 cm dish of 293FT\n      cells will typically provide enough cells to plate 20 wells in 6-well\n      plates.\n    \n        Detach 293FT cells from tissue culture dish (15 min).\n        \nAspirate media from 10 cm dish.\nWash cells once with 5 mL PBS and aspirate.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA to cells.\n            Incubate the 10 cm dish at 37°C for approximately 3–5 min or until\n            cells begin to detach from the surface.\n          \n            Add 9 mL of DMEM growth media directly to the trypsin-EDTA/cell\n            mixture.\n          \n            Pipette mixture up and down vigorously to generate a single-cell\n            suspension.\n          \n        Count and seed cells (15 min).\n        \n            Add 15 μL of cell suspension to a 1.7 mL microfuge tube containing\n            15 μL of trypan blue and mix.\n          \n            Pipette 10 μL of this mixture into duplicate cell counting chambers\n            and determine cell number using an automated cell counter.\n            Alternatively, a hemocytometer can be used for cell counting.\n          \n            Dilute cell suspension to 2 × 105 cells/mL and plate 2 mL\n            of the diluted cell suspension (4 × 105 cells) into each\n            well of the 6-well plates, seeding enough wells for the planned\n            assays.\n          \n            Incubate plates at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 18 h, allowing\n            the cells to recover and attach to the well surface.\n          \nNote: We recommend using 293FT cells that\n      have been passaged no more than 20 times after purchase from the supplier.\n      We have found that using cells at a higher passage number results in\n      reduced transfection efficiency and greater variability in the NanoBRET\n      readings.\n    \nDay 2: Transfect cells\nTiming: 1 h\n      In this step, the pCMV5-BRAFREG-Halo and pCMV5-Nano-BRAFCAT",
    "NanoBRET expression constructs are transfected into cells.\n    \n        Transfect DNA complexes into cells.\n        \nDilute NanoBRET plasmids to 5 ng/μL.\nDilute pcDNA3.1 empty vector to 100 ng/μL.\nPre-label sterile 1.7 mL tubes for each assay condition.\n            Place 100 μL of serum-free Opti-MEM into each of the pre-labeled\n            tubes.\n          \n            Add 20 ng of pCMV5-BRAFREG-Halo, 5 ng of\n            pCMV5-Nano-BRAFCAT, and 200 ng of pcDNA3.1 empty vector\n            directly into the Opti-MEM diluent.\n          \n            Add 2 μL of X-tremeGENE 9 to each sample and vortex briefly to mix.\n          \n            Pulse spin tubes in microfuge to remove any liquid that has\n            accumulated in the lid.\n          \n            Incubate tubes for 15 min at 20–25°C to allow transfection complexes\n            to form.\n          \n            Add transfection complexes dropwise to wells with attached cells.\n          \n            Incubate plates at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 16 h to\n            allow expression of the exogenous proteins.\n          \nCritical: It is important that empty\n      vector DNA (pcDNA3.1) be included in the transfection mix with the\n      NanoBRET DNA constructs, as failure to add carrier DNA greatly reduces the\n      transfection efficiency and results in inconsistent or weak NanoBRET\n      signals. However, the amount of empty vector DNA can be reduced if other\n      expression constructs are co-transfected. For example, if 100 ng of a\n      plasmid encoding HA-tagged-KRAS G12V is co-transfected with the NanoBRET\n      constructs then the amount of pcDNA3.1 can be reduced by 100 ng. In\n      addition, given the sensitivity of the assay to expression levels,\n      dilution accuracy and the use of high-purity plasmid DNAs, such as those\n      obtained through commercially available plasmid maxiprep kits or by cesium\n      chloride purification, are critical for both the transfection efficiency\n      and reproducibility of the results.\n    \nCritical: Appropriate controls should\n      be included when first performing the assay or when evaluating previously\n      untested variants. Co-expression of an activated KRAS mutant, such as",
    "G12V, is an appropriate external control for detecting a reduction in BRAF\n      autoinhibitory interactions. As an internal control for reduced BRAF\n      autoinhibition, BRAFREG-Halo construct containing the\n      RASopathy-associated BRAF-CRD mutations T241P or Q257R can be used. It is\n      expected that incorporation of these mutations will reduce the BRET ratio\n      by approximately 50% when compared to the WT NanoBRET pair. Finally, a\n      control condition consisting of untransfected cells should be included and\n      is particularly helpful when examining the expression levels of the\n      NanoBRET-tagged proteins by western blot analysis (Days 4 and 5).\n    \nDay 3: Replate cells\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\n      In this step, the cells are transferred to a 384-well white-walled tissue\n      culture plate in either the presence or absence of the fluorescent\n      NanoBRET HaloTag 618 ligand. In addition, to confirm that the expression\n      levels of the BRET-tagged proteins are equivalent between samples, the\n      remaining cells are replated into fresh 6-well plates for western blot\n      analysis on Days 4 and 5.\n    \n        Assemble materials and prepare work area for cell replating (10 min).\n        \n            Label three sets of sterile 1.7 mL tubes (Set 1–3) and one set of\n            sterile 15 mL conical tubes for each of the samples.\n          \n            Pre-warm trypsin-EDTA along with serum-free Opti-MEM (no phenol red)\n            and Opti-MEM (no phenol red) containing 10% FBS in a 37°C water\n            bath.\n          \n            Pre-cool a low-speed centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor to 4°C.\n          \n            Gather the following items and pieces of equipment:\n            \nMulti-channel pipette and tips.\nReagent reservoirs.\n384-well white-walled tissue culture plates.\n6-well tissue culture plates.\nCell counting chambers.\nTrypan blue stain.\n        Collect and count cells (20 min).\n        \n            Aspirate growth media from 6-well tissue culture plates that contain\n            cells.\n          \nAdd 250 μL of trypsin-EDTA to each of these wells.\n            Incubate plates at 37°C for 3–5 min or until cells begin to detach\n            from the well surface.",
    "Add 1 mL of 10% FBS Opti-MEM (no phenol red) to each well.\nPipette vigorously to generate a single-cell suspension.\nTransfer cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd 10% FBS Opti-MEM to make a total volume of 2 mL.\n            Mix cells and transfer 15 μL of the cell suspension to the 1.7 mL\n            Set 1 tubes.\n          \n            Centrifuge the cell suspension in the 15 mL tubes at 200–300 × g\n            for 5 min at 4°C.\n          \n            During centrifugation, add 15 μL of trypan blue stain to the cell\n            suspension in the 1.7 mL Set 1 tubes.\n          \n            Count the cells as described above in Step 2 (a concentration of\n            6–8 × 105 cells/mL is typical).\n          \n            After centrifugation, aspirate the media and flick the bottom of the\n            tubes to loosen the cell pellets.\n          \n            Resuspend the cell pellets in serum-free Opti-MEM (no phenol red) to\n            yield a final cell concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL.\n          \n            Pipette vigorously to generate a homogeneous single-cell suspension.\n          \nNote: After detaching cells from the\n      6-well tissue culture plates, cells are resuspended in Opti-MEM containing\n      10% serum to neutralize the proteolytic activity of trypsin (Step 5d).\n      However, in Step 5m, cell pellets are resuspended in serum-free Opti-MEM\n      prior to replating, which is needed to quiesce the normal cell signaling\n      pathways that can promote BRAF activation.\n    \n        Replate cells (1–1.5 h).\n        \n            Invert 15 mL tubes several times to ensure a homogeneous single cell\n            suspension.\n          \n            Pipette 500 μL of the cell suspension into the sterile 1.7 mL Set 2\n            and Set 3 tubes.\n          \n            Add 0.5 μL of the Halo618 ligand into each of the Set 2 samples (+\n            ligand) and 0.5 μL of DMSO into each of the Set 3 samples (vehicle).\n          \n            For each condition, mix samples thoroughly and transfer the cells in",
