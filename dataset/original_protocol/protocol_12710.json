    "1. In vitro transcription and gel purification of the target RNA\nClone the sequence of interest into plasmids containing T7 and/or SP6 promoters using established molecular cloning techniques12 or kits.\nLinearizing the DNA template for in vitro transcription\nAmplify the sequence of interest by PCR of the plasmid with primers designed to include the T7 promoter region through the insert, +20-30 bp upstream and downstream as previously described13.\nAlternatively, digest 5 µg of the plasmid using a restriction enzyme (RE) cut site available downstream the insert according to the instructions provided by the supplier of the RE.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember to double-check that the insert is not cut by the selected RE. Selection of the RE used in this step can dramatically affect the yield of the transcript. Preferentially, linearize with a blunt or 5'-overhanging end producing RE to avoid template switching of the T7 RNA polymerase on the opposite DNA strand14. Try different RE if initial yields are insufficient.\nPurify the resulting DNA using the kit for DNA agarose gel extraction and clean-up. Elute the DNA with 30 µL of water.\nMix well by vortexing, pipet 1.5 µL and measure DNA concentration with a microvolume spectrophotometer.\nUse 250 ng of DNA to check the quality and size of the purified DNA on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1x TBE buffer migrated for 1 h at 4 V/cm.\nThaw the frozen reagents of the in vitro transcription kit. Place the T7 RNA Polymerase Mix on ice, and the other reagents on a nutator at room temperature. Immediately after complete thawing, quick spin the rNTP tubes for 5 s to collect solution at the bottom of the tubes and place on ice. Keep the 10x Reaction Buffer at room temperature to avoid precipitation.",
    "Pipet into a 1.5 mL tube the following components of the 20 µL transcription reaction at room temperature in the indicated order: 6 µL of water, 2 µL (0.1 - 1 µg) of linear DNA template, 2 µL of 75 mM ATP solution, 2 µL of 75 mM GTP solution, 2 µL of 75 mM CTP solution, 2 µL of 75 mM UTP solution, 2 µL of 10x Reaction Buffer and 2 µL of T7 RNA Polymerase Mix.\n\tNOTE: For DNA template generated by PCR, use 100 - 200 ng DNA; for DNA template generated by restriction enzyme digest of a plasmid, use ~1 µg. Active recombinant His6-tagged T7 RNA Polymerase can be purified in E. coli15.\nMix the tube thoroughly. Quick spin for 5 s to collect reaction solution at the bottom of the tube, then incubate at 37 °C for 2-4 h.\n\tNOTE: Every transcript will behave differently depending on the DNA template, its length, its sequence or structure. Optimize in vitro transcription conditions by testing different incubation times up to 6 h; different concentrations of DNA template, T7 RNA Polymerase, or NTP; or addition of supplementary MgCl2 to what is present in the T7 RNA Polymerase Mix.\nAt the end of the incubation period, add 1 µL of DNase I per 20 µL reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The transcription reaction can be temporarily kept on ice until the polyacrylamide gel is ready.\nProceed with purification by polyacrylamide gel.\n\tNOTE: Since RNA is sensitive to pH and RNase contamination, use RNA dedicated equipment and RNase-free reagents.",
    "Determine the percentage of polyacrylamide for the gel depending on the size of the transcript of interest: 3.5% for 100-2000 nt (XC: 460 nt ; BB: 100 nt), 5% for 80-500 nt (XC: 260 nt ; BB: 65 nt), 8% for 60-400 nt (XC: 160 nt ; BB: 45 nt), 12% for 40-200 nt (XC: 70 nt ; BB: 20 nt), 15% for 25-150 nt (XC: 60 nt ; BB: 15 nt), and 20% for 6-100 nt (XC: 45 nt ; BB: 12 nt).\nPrepare the urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel by combining the following reagents in a 50 mL conical tube: 9.6 g of molecular grade urea, 2 mL of 10x TBE, x mL of 40% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide mix (29:1) and water up to the 20 mL mark on the tube, where x=20 mL/(40%/gel percentage %).\n\tCAUTION: Polyacrylamide gels often contain un-polymerized acrylamide which is a toxic material that can produce a hazard when introduced to the environment. Dispose of polyacrylamide gels through the institution’s chemical waste program.\nMicrowave for 15 s at 30% power. Place on the nutator for 10 min at room temperature or until urea has completely dissolved.\nWhile the gel mixture is rotating, retrieve a gel cassette (18-well, 1 mm thick; 13.3 x 8.7 cm (W x L)), remove the comb and position the cassette for gel casting.\nQuick spin the 50 mL tube for 5 s to collect gel solution at the bottom of the tube. Add 125 µL of 10% ammonium persulphate solution (APS). Place on the nutator for ~ 1 min. Quick spin again for 5 s.\nAdd 25 µL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and carefully mix by pipetting up and down 5 times with a 25 mL pipette avoiding bubbles.\nPipette into the gel cast and carefully insert the gel comb avoiding bubbles.",
    "Tighten the seal by adding a large binder clip over the top of the cassette.\nAllow the gel to polymerize for 1 h.\nOnce the gel has solidified, remove the binder clip. Insert the cassette into the electrophoresis box. Add 1x TBE buffer into the top and bottom reservoirs.\nRetrieve transcription reaction. Add water up to 100 µL, then add 100 µL of 2x Gel Loading Buffer. Prepare the ladder by mixing the recommended amount with water to 10 µL and 10 µL of 2x Gel Loading Buffer to a separate 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate both the ladder and the in vitro transcription reaction in the thermomixer at 70 °C for 15 min.\nWhile the samples are denaturing at 70 °C, carefully remove the comb, clean the wells by pipetting up and down each well with a P1000 pipette, and immediately pre-run for 10 min at 100 V.\nOnce the samples have completed their 15 min denaturation at 70 °C, remove the tubes from the thermomixer and immediately place on ice.\nClean each well of the gel again with the P1000 pipette. Load 20 µL of the ladder on the first well to the left, 20 µL of the RNA sample on 10 separate wells, and 20 µL of 1x Gel Loading Buffer on the unutilized wells.\nRun the gel at 100 V for 60 -240 min, depending on the % polyacrylamide of the gel.\n\tNOTE: The dyes in the Gel Loading Buffer will separate into two bands as they traverse the gel, a slow migrating Bromophenol Blue (BB) blue band, and a fast migrating Xylene Cyanol (XC) cyan band. The approximate migration of these bands in different % polyacrylamide gels is well known (see step 1.11) and can be used to estimate the migration of RNA in the gel.",
    "Once the gel has been stopped, carefully remove the gel from the cassette.\nPlace the gel in a clean box containing a solution of 50 mL of 1x TBE buffer with 50 µL of nucleic acid gel stain and incubate for 5 min on a rocker to stain the RNA.\nTake a before and after band excision picture of the gel on the gel imaging system, preferably using blue light instead of UV transillumination.\nExcise each band of interest using a nuclease-free disposable gel cutting tip. After each well, transfer the tip containing the gel slice to a 1.5 mL tube and briefly spin to collect the gel slice. Repeat until all the bands have been collected in the same 1.5 mL tube.\nOnce all the gel slices have been collected, add 100 µL of nuclease-free water or TE buffer to the 1.5 mL tube. Store at 4 °C for ~48 h. This allows the RNA to exit the gel slices into the solution.\nAfter 48 h, pipet the water or TE buffer to a fresh 1.5 mL tube. Dispose of the remaining gel slices. Purify the RNA via clean-up kit as follows.\n\t\nEquilibrate the spin column at room temperature for at least 30 min.\nTo the 100 µL of RNA solution in the new 1.5 mL tube from step 1.32, add 350 µL of RLT buffer and mix well for 2 min on a nutator. Spin for 1 s at 200 x g to collect solution at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 675 µL of 100% EtOH and mix well for 2 min on the nutator. Spin for 1 s at 200 x g and immediately proceed to the next step.",
    "Transfer 565 µL of the mixture onto the spin column and spin for 1 min at 15,000 x g. Empty the collection tube by aspiration.\nRepeat previous step with the second half of the sample.\nAdd 500 µL of RPE buffer to the column and spin for 1 min at 15,000 x g. Empty the collection tube by aspiration.\nAdd 750 µL of 80% ethanol to the column and spin for 1 min at 15,000 x g. Empty the collection tube by aspiration.\nPlace the column in a new 2 mL collection tube with the lid open and spin at 15,000 x g for 5 min.\nTransfer the column to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 17 µL of water on the center of the column and spin at 15,000 x g for 1 min to elute. Elute again using another 17 µL of water. The total recovered volume should be 32 µL.\nMix well by vortexing, pipet 1.5 µL and measure the concentration of the RNA using a microvolume spectrophotometer.\nCheck the quality of the RNA purification by urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel as in steps 1.11-1.29.\n2. In vitro RNA methyltransferase assay\nSet up the 100 µL RNA methyltransferase assay in a 1.5 mL tube on ice as follows: 23 µL of water, 10 µL of 10x TBS (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1.5 M NaCl), 2 µL of 0.05 M EDTA, 5 µL of 100 mM DTT, 40 µL of 50% glycerol, 4 µL of 58 µM 3H-SAM, 5 µL of 20x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 1 µL of RNaseOUT (optional), 5 µL of RNA and 5 µL of Methyltransferase.",
    "CAUTION: Radioactive tritiated material is hazardous and should only be handled while wearing gloves, a lab coat and any other necessary PPE. All pipette tips and tubes in contact with radioactive material are considered solid radioactive waste. Dispose of all solid and liquid radioactive waste according to the lab’s approved radioactive waste protocol.\n\tNOTE: Include control samples without the methyltransferase and without the RNA. The reagent concentrations may require optimization and/or inclusion of divalent cation salts, such as MgCl2, or unlabeled SAM. The optimal range of final RNA concentration is from 50 nM to 1 µM, while the methyltransferase concentration is from 25 nM to 300 nM.\nMix thoroughly by gently vortexing the tube. Spin 5 s at 200 x g to collect the solution at the bottom of the tube. Incubate the tube(s) at 37 °C for 2 h.\nClean up the reaction using column purification as in step 1.32.\n\tCAUTION: Be very careful to properly dispose of any radioactive materials, particularly during the column washes (pipette out instead of aspirating waste from collection tubes).\nPerform liquid scintillation count\n\t\nSet up the scintillation count rack with one vial per sample, one vial for background measurement and one vial for the swipe test. Fill the vials with 5 mL of scintillation counting solution.\nAdd 10 µL of each eluted radioactive RNA sample into 1 vial, and tighten the lid and mix gently.\nPrepare the swipe test vials. Thoroughly rub cotton swabs on all surfaces and equipment used during the protocol. Add swabs to the vials filled with 5 mL of scintillation solution and tighten the lid.",
    "Run the samples on the scintillation counter as follows. Open the counter hood, insert the rack into the machine and close the hood. Select Count Single Rack. Select Select User Program. Select or create a program that measures tritium (3H) for 60 s. Hit Count Rack. Repeat the scintillation count three times.\n\t\tNOTE: The equipment will measure the scintillation count of each sample and output to both the screen and a printout. Protocol can be paused here if desired. Remaining RNA samples from step 2.3 should be frozen at -80 °C for later use.\nProceed with the autoradiogram\n\t\nPrepare and pre-run urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel as in steps 1.11-1.20.\nPipette 20 µL of radioactive RNA material into a new 1.5 mL tube containing 20 µL of 2x Gel Loading Buffer. Mix well. Prepare the ladder as in step 1.21. Incubate the samples at 70 °C for 15 min.\nWash the wells of the gel once more immediately before sample loading. Load 20 µL of the prepared ladder, 20 µL of the samples, and 20 µL of 1x Gel Loading Buffer on remaining lanes. Run the gel at 100 V for 60-180 min, depending on polyacrylamide percentage.\nOnce the gel finishes running, remove the gel from the cassette and place it in a box containing 50 mL of 1x TBE buffer with 5 µL of ultrasensitive nucleic acid gel stain.\nIncubate for 5 min on the rocker to stain the RNA.\nCarefully take the gel out of the box and place it on the UV transilluminator of the gel imaging system with the wells up and the ladder on the left.",
    "Focus the camera on the gel, turn on the UV light and then take an image of the gel by exposing from 50 ms to 1 s depending on signal intensity.\nTurn off UV exposure, and save image as Tiff file.\nPlace the gel back into the box. Remove TBE. Fix the gel with 50 mL of fixing solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 40% ultra-pure water) for 30 min at room temperature on a rocker.\nGently move the gel again to a fresh black box containing 25 mL of the autoradiography enhancing solution. In the absence of a black box, cover the box with aluminum foil to protect the solution from light.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature on the rocker.\nGently lift the gel and place it face-down on a sheet of plastic wrap with the wells up and the ladder on the right-hand side. Place two sheets of chromatography paper on the back of the gel. Gently flip the entire stack.\nPre-heat the gel dryer to 80 °C. Move back the plastic cover on the gel dryer. Insert wrap, gel and chromatography paper stack under the plastic cover and move the plastic cover back down to create a seal.\nDry for 1 h at 80 °C in the gel dryer.\nTurn off the gel dryer and gently remove the stack. Remove the wrap and second chromatography paper. Tape remaining chromatography paper with the dried gel in an autoradiogram cassette.\nAdd 1 sheet of autoradiography film in the dark room.",
    "Place the cassette at -80 °C and develop the film after 1 h to 4 weeks depending on signal intensity, which can be judged based on the previously measured scintillation counts: 1-4 weeks for 250-1,000 cpm, 24 h to 1 week for 1,000-10,000 cpm and 1 h to 24 h for >10,000 cpm.\nOnce the film is developed, place the film on top of the cassette and carefully mark with a lab marker the 4 edges of the gel, each well, and the position of the XC and BB dyes.\nScan the film at 300 or 600 pixels per inch resolution and save the image as Tiff file.\nSubscription Required.
