  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This protocol is composed of five sections: (1) isolation of mouse bone marrow and differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), (2) fabrication of CNC/agarose/D-mannitol hydrogel substrates in a 24-well system and culture of BMMCs on the substrates, (3) removal of BMMCs from the CNC/agarose/D-mannitol hydrogel substrates and analysis of viability and biomarker expression using flow cytometry, (4) 3D bioprinting of hydrogel scaffolds from a commercially available fibrillar nanocellulose (FNC)/sodium alginate composite biomaterial ink, and (5) culture of BMMCs on FNC/sodium alginate hydrogel scaffolds and analysis of viability using flow cytometry, XTT, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) microtiter assays.\n1. Generation of the BMMC culture\nNOTE: Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation following isoflurane anesthesia. The tibia and femur were isolated, and whole bone marrow was harvested. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines and Policies with approval from the Health Science Animal Care and Use Committee for the University of Alberta.\nPrepare complete RPMI-1640 culture medium by adding the supplements listed in Table 1 to the indicated final concentrations. Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.4-7.6 using NaOH, filter-sterilize using a single-use, bottle-top filter (0.2 µm pore size), and store at 4 °C in the dark for up to 2 months.\nObtain femurs from mice in accordance with the local University Animal Care Committee protocols and procedures.\n\tNOTE: In this study, femurs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice, but any strain can be used if it is relevant to the study.",
    "Using scissors, remove skin and muscle from the hip joint, and then gently pull the femur by twisting slightly out of the hip socket (Figure 1). Be careful not to break off the femoral head. Cut the tibia away from the femur at the medial fabella using scissors. Remove the paw by cutting just above the calcaneum and discard.\nUsing a scalpel, remove skin and cartilage from femur and tibia pieces. Using scissors, make a clean cut on each end of the femur and tibia, exposing the red bone marrow within. If required, remove the fibula at this point, but note that it may aid in the manipulation of the tibia during bone marrow flushing.\nPrepare a 26 G needle with a 5 mL luer-lock syringe, and fill with approximately 5 mL of complete media prepared as described above.\n\tNOTE: At this point, incomplete RPMI without the additives can also be used to save on reagents.\nHolding the femur or tibia with forceps, insert the needle into one end of the bone and gently press the syringe. Hold the bone over a 50 mL sterile conical tube, and gently inject approximately 5 mL of medium into the bone, applying some pressure. Observe pieces of bone marrow fall out the other end of the bone as thin red ribbons and into the conical tube.\nSpin down the aspirates and resuspend in complete medium, or transfer directly into a T175 cm2 sterile tissue culture flask containing 50 mL of complete RPMI-1640 medium. Maintain the aspirates in complete RPMI-1640 medium with 30 ng/mL mouse recombinant interleukin (IL)-3.",
    "After 1 day, observe the cultures under a light microscope. The culture will be composed of a heterogeneous population of cells of varying shapes and sizes and even larger pieces of bone marrow. Feed cell cultures by adding 15 mL of fresh medium every 3-5 days using the complete RPMI-1640 medium as described above, and ensure the cell density never exceeds 1 × 106 cells/mL. Once per week, spin down cells at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature, resuspend in fresh complete RPMI-1640 medium, and split 1:4 into 50 mL of medium in fresh T175 flasks.\nAfter 4 weeks, determine cell purity by measuring the surface expression of CD117 (Kit) and FceRI receptors by flow cytometry as described below (section 3.2).\n\t​NOTE: After 4 weeks, 99% of cells should be double-positive for CD117 (Kit) and FcεRI.\nAt 4 weeks and onward, maintain the BMMCs with 20 ng/mL of IL-3 in complete RPMI-1640 medium. At approximately 6 weeks, the cells will stop dividing and will no longer require splitting. Feed the cultures every 3–5 days, pellet the cells by centrifugation once per week, and resuspend in fresh complete RPMI-1640 medium.\n2. Fabrication of the CNC/agarose/D-mannitol hydrogel substrates and BMMC culture\nIn a glass bottle, add 0.2 g of agarose powder to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2% w/v) to a final volume of 10 mL, and boil for 1 min at 100 °C to dissolve.\nDissolve 2.5 g of CNC powder in PBS to a final volume of 10 mL to prepare a 25% w/v mixture.\nDissolve 2 g of CNC powder in PBS to a final volume of 10 mL to prepare a 20% w/v mixture, and serially dilute the 20% w/v mixture to prepare 10, 5, and 2% w/v CNC mixtures.",
    "Heat the 25, 20, 10, 5 and 2% w/v CNC mixtures to 37 °C for 10 min (Figure 2A).\nAdd 0.46 g of D-mannitol to the hot agarose solution (4.6% w/v) and dissolve.\nMix the pre-warmed 25, 20, 10, 5 and 2% w/v CNC-PBS mixtures with the hot agarose/D-mannitol solution in separate conical tubes at a 1:1 ratio to yield final CNC concentrations of 12.5, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1% w/v in the hydrogel mixtures.\nWorking quickly, add 500 µL/well of the above solutions prepared in step 2.6 in quadruplicate to a 24-well culture plate, and let stand for 30 min at room temperature to facilitate polymerization (Figure 2B).\nCarefully layer 1000 µL of the BMMC suspension at a density of 1.1 × 106 cells/mL on top of the hydrogel substrates with a micropipettor, and avoid touching the gel with the tip of the pipette as this will damage the gel surface and generate particles.\nIncubate the BMMCs on the hydrogel substrates in a sterile incubator (5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) at 37 °C for 18 h.\n3. Flow cytometric analyses\nFlow cytometric analysis of BMMC viability via PI exclusion\n\t\nCarefully remove the culture medium containing BMMCs from the top of the CNC/agarose/D-mannitol, avoiding the gel, and transfer the cells into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nWash the BMMCs twice with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and resuspend in 180 µL of PBS-0.5% w/v BSA to a final density of 1.5 × 106 cells/mL. Transfer the cells to a 96 well round-bottom plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Filter-sterilize all PBS-0.5% w/v BSA solutions twice using a 0.2 µm pore-size syringe filter, and store at 4 °C.",
    "Add 20 µL of PBS-0.5% w/v BSA, or 10x PI (100 µg/mL) prepared in PBS-0.5% w/v BSA, to the cells to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL, and incubate for either 1 h at 4 °C or 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Acquire fluorescence data using a flow cytometer equipped with an Argon ion laser (488-514 nm) and bandpass filter to enable detection of fluorescence emission at 578 nm. Acquire 20,000 events per sample at a flow rate of 30 µL/min at room temperature. Analyze the data as described below (sections 3.2.7-3.2.10).\nFlow cytometric analysis of BMMCs for Kit (CD117) and FcεRI surface receptor expression\n\t\nCarefully remove the culture medium containing BMMCs from the top of the CNC/agarose/D-mannitol, avoiding the gel, and transfer the cells into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nWash BMMCs twice with filtered PBS-0.5% BSA at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and resuspend in 180 µL of PBS containing 0.5% w/v BSA (1.5 × 106 cells/mL). Transfer the resuspended cells to a 96-well round-bottom plate.\nAdd 20 µL of 10x antibody working solutions to the cells to achieve a final concentration of 0.06 µg/mL of CD117 (c-Kit)-phycoerythrin (PE) and 0.06 µg/mL of FcεRIα-allophycocyanin (APC), respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: The 10x antibody working solutions must be prepared in filter-sterilized PBS-0.5% w/v BSA.\nAdd 20 µL of 10x isotype control working solutions containing either rat IgG2b κ isotype control-PE or Armenian hamster IgG isotype control-APC to separate wells containing cells that have not been stained with either of the antibody-fluorophore conjugates in step 3.2.3.",
    "NOTE: The isotype controls, rat IgG2b κ isotype control-PE and Armenian hamster IgG isotype control-APC serve to control for non-specific attachment of antibodies to the BMMC. As BMMCs do not express high levels of FcR, there is rarely high background fluorescence detected with isotype control antibodies. Prepare the 10x isotype control working solutions in filter-sterilized PBS-0.5% w/v BSA.\nIncubate the 96-well round-bottom plate for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark.\nWash the cells by adding 200 µL of fresh PBS-0.5% w/v BSA buffer to each well, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash step once more. Carefully remove the supernatant without touching the cell pellet; leave behind some supernatant to ensure that the cell pellet remains undisturbed.\nAfter washing, resuspend cells in 100 µL of 0.5% w/v BSA, 0.05% w/v sodium azide in PBS (pH 7.4) that has been sterile-filtered twice with a 0.2 µm pore-size syringe filter. Acquire fluorescence data in the PE and APC detector channels using a flow cytometer, as outlined above in step 3.1.3.\nAnalyze data using software capable of viewing and analyzing flow cytometric data files with the extension \".fcs\".\nBegin analysis by plotting forward scatter (FSC) along the x-axis and side scatter (SSC) along the y-axis, and gate for the conserved cell population with a FSC range of log10 1.5-5.0 and an SSC range of log10 0.75-3.25 in the untreated and unstained cells as shown in Figure 3A(i),(ii).\n\t\tNOTE: This serves to ensure that cell debris with low FSC and SSC values are eliminated from the analysis. Mast cells are normally very granular (high SSC) cells and large (high FSC) when compared to other immunological cell types, such as monocytes and lymphocytes.",
    "Next, generate FSC vs. SSC dot plots and histogram profiles of untreated samples that have been stained with the dye, antibodies, or isotype controls, and obtain mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the PE or APC channels according to the emission spectrum of the specific antibody-fluorophore conjugate or dye used. Apply the same set of gates and parameters to all BMMC samples incubated with different CNC/agarose/D-mannitol substrates and stained with the corresponding isotype controls, antibodies, or dye; obtain MFIs.\n\t\t​NOTE: Essentially, the FSC vs SSC dot plots of the untreated stained samples should be indistinguishable from untreated/unstained samples, obtained in step 3.2.9, to ensure that the staining procedure does not alter the cell size (measured by FSC) or granularity (measured by SSC) (Figure 3A(i),(ii)).\nCalculate average MFIs and standard error of mean (SEM) for each sample from 4 independent experiments followed by generation of graphs using a statistical analysis software package.\nPrepare histogram overlays in the flow cytometric data analysis software (Figure 3B, 4A(ii),B(ii)).\n4. 3D Bioprinting of FNC/sodium alginate hydrogel substrates\nNOTE: The 3D bioprinter used in this study is a pneumatic-extrusion system equipped with two independent, temperature-controlled printheads. The biomaterial ink used to 3D bioprint the hydrogel scaffolds is formulated of (a) highly hydrated fibrillar nanocellulose (FNC), which is morphologically similar to collagen, (b) sodium alginate, and (c) D-mannitol. It is supplied as a sterile hydrogel suspension in 3 mL cartridges to which sterile luer-lock conical bioprinting nozzles (22, 25, or 27 G) can be attached.\nUse this protocol with the printheads and printbed at room temperature, where the room temperature is 20-25 °C.",
    "Store the biomaterial ink cartridges at 4 °C to maintain stability of the hydrogel composite. Prior to commencing 3D bioprinting, remove a cartridge (3 mL) from the refrigerator and allow it to equilibrate to room temperature.\nInstallation of a Bioink cartridge onto the INKREDIBLE+ 3D Bioprinter\n\t\nRemove the blue end caps from the 3 mL biomaterial ink cartridge (Figure 5B(i)), and affix a sterile 22 G (blue) conical bioprinting nozzle to the luer-lock end of the Bioink cartridge.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential to affix the desired conical bioprinting nozzle to the bioink cartridge prior to installing the cartridge and performing the subsequent calibration steps, as failure to do so will result in improper calibration of the z-axis of the 3D bioprinter.\nConnect the air pressure supply tubing for printhead 1 (PH1, left) to the opposite end of the cartridge, and insert the cartridge with its attached conical bioprinting nozzle into the vertical slot of PH1 (Figure 5A(ii)).\nFirmly seat the cartridge in PH1 with the conical bioprinting nozzle extending below the printhead. Tighten the screw on PH1 clockwise until finger-tight to lock the Bioink cartridge in place. Note that 3D bioprinting can be performed with PH2 left empty.\nCalibrating the x-y-z axes of the 3D bioprinter\n\t\nPower on the 3D bioprinter, and launch the bioprinter software on a PC connected to the 3D bioprinter via a USB 2.0 cable.\nIn the software, click the CONNECT button to sync the software with the 3D bioprinter.\n\t\tNOTE: The sync is successful when the printhead ultraviolet light-emitting diode lights cycle on and off, and the HEPA filter fan cycles off and on again. The software must be synced to the 3D bioprinter prior to homing the bioprinter axes and the starting point calibration, as outlined in the subsequent steps.",
    "Observe four options in the main control menu of the 3D bioprinter: (i) PREPARE BIOPRINT, (ii) BIOPRINT, (iii) UTILITIES MENU, and (iv) STATUS SCREEN. Select the PREPARE BIOPRINT option, then scroll down to and select the HOME AXES option.\n\t\tNOTE: The 3D bioprinter will then move the printhead assembly backward and leftward to calibrate the y- and x-axes, respectively. Thereafter, with the printheads paused in the far left position, the bioprinter will raise the printbed until the z-axis calibration switch (located on the printbed) makes contact with the conical bioprinting nozzle installed on printhead 1\nAfter successful calibration of the x-y-z axes, observe the slight lowering of the printbed and the relocation of the printheads to above the center point of the printbed (Figure 5A(i)).\nStarting point calibration of the bioprinter for bioprinting in 24-well plates\n\t\nRemove a sterile 24-well culture plate from its sealed plastic wrapping, and mark a dot of at the center point of well D1 on the underside of the plate with a permanent marker. Remove the plate cover, and place the 24-well culture plate on the printbed with well D1 located at the front left corner of the printbed.\nOn the main control menu, select UTILITIES MENU and then select MOVE AXIS. Move the printheads in 1 mm increments along the x- and y-axes until the conical bioprinting nozzle of PH1 is directly over the dot marked under well D1. If necessary, fine-tune the position of the conical bioprinting nozzle over the dot by moving the printheads in 0.1 mm increments.\nRecord the x- and y-coordinates of the conical bioprinting nozzle when directly over the center of well D1, as indicated on the control panel screen of the 3D bioprinter.",
    "NOTE: In the case of the INKREDIBLE+ 3D bioprinter used here, the x- and y-coordinates are as follows: x : -46.5 and y : -27.5. These coordinates serve as the starting point at the center of well D1 for bioprinting in a 24-well plate.\nNext, raise the printbed in 1 mm increments until the bottom of well D1 is almost touching the conical bioprinting nozzle installed in printhead 1. Fine-tune the movement of the printbed in 0.1 mm increments if necessary (Figure 5A(ii)). Then, from the UTILITIES MENU, select the Z-AXIS CALIBRATION option, and further select and confirm the STORE Z CALIBRATION option.\nReturn to the main menu, and select the PREPARE BIOPRINT option. Scroll down to and select the CALIBRATE Z option.\n\t\tNOTE: The 3D bioprinter will now lower the printbed upon successfully executing the z-axis calibration (Figure 5A(iii)).\nUpdating 24-well plate G-code file with correct starting point coordinates\n\t\nOpen the provided 24-well plate geometric code (G-code) file in the bioprinter software (Supplemental File 1).\n\t\tNOTE: This 24-well G-code file encodes the printing of 2-layer 5 x 5 x 1 mm rectilinear constructs in each well (Figure 5C(i),(iii)). The provided G-code files can be used with any 3D bioprinting software.\nNote that Line 1 of the G-code file reads G0 X-50.0 Y-33.5 ;Center Position of D1 well. Update the x- and y-coordinates on Line 1 with the values obtained in step 4.5.3, i.e., Line 1 should now read G0 X-46.5 Y-27.5 ;Center Position of D1 well. Save the file under a new name.",
    "​NOTE: This procedure serves to calibrate the G-code file so that printing will commence in the center of well D1 based on the x,y coordinates of the specific 3D bioprinter being used. This approach can be used to calibrate the 24-well plate G-code file for printing with any extrusion 3D bioprinter. For the purpose of this study, only the left half of the 24-well plate, i.e., wells A1-3, B1-3, C1-3, and D1-3 were printed. A separate G-code file that encodes the printing of 2-layer 5 x 5 x 1 mm rectilinear constructs in a 3 x 4 grid is also provided (Supplemental File 2, Figure 5C(ii)).\nAdjustment of extrusion pressure for Printhead 1 (PH1)\n\t\nEnsure that the pneumatic pump is tightly connected to the rear air intake port of the INKREDIBLE+ 3D bioprinter, and turn on the pneumatic pump.\nPull out the forward control knob located on the right side of the INKREDIBLE+ 3D bioprinter.\n\t\tNOTE: The forward control knob adjusts the pressure for PH1, while the rear control knob adjusts the pressure for PH2.\nObserve the digital pressure gauges for PH1 and PH2 located on the front of the bioprinter each read close to 0 kPa. Slowly rotate the forward control knob clockwise until the pressure indicated on the left gauge for PH1 reaches 12 kPa (Figure 5A(iii)).\nPlace a folded tissue paper or piece of waterproof, sealing film under the print nozzle of the installed cartridge, being careful not to touch the print nozzle.\nFrom the main control menu on the 3D bioprinter, select PREPARE BIOPRINT.",
    "Navigate to and select TURN ON PH1. Note that the biomaterial ink starts to extrude from the print nozzle. If necessary, increase the extrusion pressure by rotating the control knob clockwise until the biomaterial ink is extruded in a continuous filament, and record the new pressure setting. Work quickly to avoid wasting biomaterial ink.\nSelect TURN OFF PH1 to stop extrusion of the biomaterial ink, remove the tissue paper or film containing the extruded biomaterial ink from the printbed, and close the bioprinter door.\n\t\t​NOTE: The 3D bioprinter will automatically turn on the air pressure supply to PH1 during printing as instructed by the G-code file.\n3D bioprinting of rectilinear hydrogel substrates in a 24-well plate format\n\t\nFrom the main control menu on the 3D bioprinter, select UTILITIES MENU. Navigate to and select DISABLE SD PRINT, which will allow the bioprinter software to transmit G-code files to the 3D bioprinter for printing.\nClick on the LOAD button in the bioprinter software, and select the updated 24-well plate G-code file saved in step 4.6.2.\nIn the right-hand control panel in the software, select the PRINT PREVIEW tab, and click on the PRINT button to commence bioprinting in well D1.\n\t\tNOTE: If using the 3 x 4 grid well plate G-code file, the bioprinting will terminate in well A3 of the 24-well plate (Figure 5C(ii),D), as opposed to well A6 if a full 24-well plate is printed.\nUpon completion of bioprinting of the rectilinear constructs, cover the 24-well plate with its lid and move it to a class II biosafety cabinet.\nImmerse each rectilinear construct in two drops of sterile 50 mM CaCl2 solution (Figure 5B(ii)), and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: This serves to ionically crosslink the alginate polymer chains with the Ca2+ ions and allow the rectilinear constructs to maintain their structural integrity.\nCarefully aspirate the CaCl2 solution from each construct, and rinse once in 1 mL of 1x PBS (pH 7.4) to remove excess CaCl2 (Figure 5D).\nTo prevent dehydration of the bioprinted hydrogel constructs, maintain the 3D bioprinted rectilinear constructs in fresh 1x PBS until the BMMCs are ready to be seeded onto the constructs (Figure 5D).\n5. Incubation of BMMCs on 3D bioprinted rectilinear scaffolds and viability testing\nIncubation of BMMCs on 3D bioprinted rectilinear hydrogel scaffolds\n\t\nSeed aliquots of BMMCs onto the 3D bioprinted rectilinear scaffolds in triplicate for four different durations, e.g., 6, 18, 24, and 48 h, so that all treatments terminate simultaneously. Use BMMCs seeded into empty wells in triplicate for the same durations as untreated controls.\nAseptically transfer BMMCs from a T175 cm2 culture flask to a sterile 50 mL conical tube, and pellet the BMMCs at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 mL of fresh complete RPMI medium containing 20 ng/mL of IL-3, and calculate the live cell density by counting an aliquot of trypan blue-stained BMMCs using a hemacytometer.\nBased on the cell density calculated in step 5.1.3, prepare a 6 mL aliquot of the BMMC suspension at a final density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "For the 48 h incubation setup, aspirate PBS from wells A1-3 containing the 3D bioprinted rectilinear hydrogel scaffolds, and pipette 1 mL of BMMC (1 × 106 cells/mL) suspension into each well. Also, pipette 1 mL of BMMC (1 × 106 cells/mL) suspension into wells A4-6 without bioprinted constructs to serve as the untreated control. Incubate the remaining wells containing bioprinted scaffolds (B1-3, C1-3, D1-3) in RPMI without additives to prevent dehydration until the appropriate time is reached for seeding with BMMC for the 24, 18, and 6 h treatment durations. Fill the wells without bioprinted scaffolds (B4-6, C4-6, D4-6) with 1 mL of PBS until the appropriate time is reached for seeding with the BMMCs for the 24, 18, and 6 h time points.\nIncubate the 24-well plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.\nFor the 24 h incubation setup, aspirate pre-existing culture medium/buffer from wells B1-6, and seed 1 mL of BMMC (1 × 106 cells/mL) suspension into these wells. Return the plate to the incubator.\nFor the 18 h incubation setup, aspirate pre-existing culture medium/buffer from wells C1-6, and seed 1 mL of BMMC (1 × 106 cells/mL) suspension into these wells. Return the plate to the incubator.\nFor the 6 h incubation setup, aspirate pre-existing culture medium/buffer from wells D1-6, and seed 1 mL of BMMC (1 × 106 cells/mL) suspension into these wells. Return the plate to the incubator.\nFor incubation termination, dispense samples from each well of the 24-well plate for (i) PI staining and analysis by flow cytometry, (ii) XTT cell viability assay, and (iii) LDH release assay. Therefore, ensure that a round-bottom 96-well plate and the necessary 1.5 mL microfuge tubes are labeled well in advance of the endpoint of the incubation.\nCell sampling for XTT metabolic assay",
    "Thoroughly resuspend the BMMCs in the culture medium within each well, being careful not to damage and fragment the 3D bioprinted hydrogel scaffolds.\nAseptically transfer 40 µL of the homogeneous BMMC suspension from each well to sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes containing 760 µL of fresh complete RPMI medium (final volume = 800 µL), and vortex briefly to mix.\nDispense 100 µL of the diluted BMMC suspensions in triplicate into a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate that is suitable for recording absorbance measurements (see the Table of Materials) on a microplate spectrophotometer.\nDispense 50 µL of XTT working solution to each well containing the BMMC cell suspension using a multichannel micropipette.\n\t\t​NOTE: Prepare XTT working solution by mixing 5 mL of XTT reagent with 100 µL of electron-coupling reagent. Thaw these components from -20 °C in a 37 °C water bath immediately before use.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 24 h.\nAt the end of the incubation, remove the 96-well plate from the incubator and allow to cool to room temperature. Record absorbance values on a microplate spectrophotometer at 450 nm with background subtraction at 650 nm.\nSupernatant sampling for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\n\t\nTransfer the remaining BMMC suspensions (960 µL) from each well of the 24-well plate to microfuge tubes, and pellet the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nPipette three 100 µL aliquots of the cell culture supernatant from each microfuge tube into a 96-well microtiter flat-bottom plate. Discard the leftover supernatants from each microfuge tube, and retain the BMMC pellets for further staining with PI in sections 5.4.1-5.4.8.\nPipette 50 µL of the LDH working solution into each 100 µL aliquot of supernatant.",
    "NOTE: Refer to Supplemental File 3 for the preparation of LDH assay reagents.\nIncubate for 1 h in the dark at room temperature.\nPipette 50 µL of 1 M acetic acid to each well to stop the reaction.\nRecord absorbance values on a microplate spectrophotometer at 490 nm with background subtraction at 680 nm.\nFlow cytometric analysis of BMMC viability via propidium iodide (PI) exclusion\n\t\nResuspend the BMMC pellets in flow wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.5% w/v BSA), and pellet the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRepeat the wash step with flow wash buffer once more.\nResuspend each BMMC pellet in 400 µL of flow wash buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: There will be 24 resuspended BMMC samples in total: 12 BMMC samples incubated on bioprinted hydrogel substrates (4 time points in triplicate) and 12 BMMC samples incubated in wells without bioprinted constructs (4 time points in triplicate).\nIn a round-bottom 96-well microtiter plate, pipette 20 µL of flow wash buffer into wells A1-12 and B1-12. In the same microtiter plate, pipette 20 µL of 10x PI staining solution (100 µg/mL PI in flow wash buffer) into wells C1-12 and D1-12.\nDispense 180 µL of the 12 BMMC samples incubated on bioprinted hydrogel substrates into wells A1-12 (one sample per well). Dispense 180 µL of the 12 BMMC samples incubated without bioprinted hydrogel substrates into wells B1-12 (one sample per well). Use the BMMC samples dispensed into wells A1-12 and B1-12 as unstained controls for each treatment condition (24 controls in total).\nDispense 180 µL of the 12 BMMC samples incubated on bioprinted constructs into wells C1-12 (one sample per well). Dispense 180 µL of the 12 BMMC samples incubated without bioprinted constructs into wells D1-12 (one sample per well).",
    "NOTE: The BMMC samples in wells C1-12 and D1-12 will be stained at a final effective PI concentration of 10 µg/mL (24 stained samples in total).\nIncubate the plate either for 1 h at 4 °C or 15 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAt the end of the incubation period, analyze the samples directly from the microtiter plate on a flow cytometer as previously described under the section 3.1.\nSubscription Required.
