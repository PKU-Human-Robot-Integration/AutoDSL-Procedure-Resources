    "The study protocol described here was approved by the NCI at Frederick Animal Care and Use Committee. NCI-Frederick is accredited by AAALAC International and follows the Public Health Service Policy for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animal care was provided in accordance with the procedures outlined in the “Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011; The National Academies Press, Washington D.C.).\n1. Preparation of cells for injection\nNOTE: Mouse brain tumor primary cells (MBRs) used for this model were originally isolated from tamoxifen induced TRP GEM mice, as described in El Meskini et al.5. Details on the cell preparation can be found in this reference.\nPerform the following steps using sterile technique in a biosafety cabinet.\nCulture primary brain tumor cells in vitro until they reach the exponential growth phase.\nHarvest the cells in 0.25% trypsin, and once they have detached, dilute them with growth medium to inactivate the trypsin.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 400 x g and wash with serum-free media. Repeat once prior to counting.\nCount the cells manually or with an automated cell counter. Resuspend the cells in 5% sterile methylcellulose in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at the desired concentration, based on a final injection volume of 2 µL. The desired cell concentration may vary based on the cell line and brain tumor model. For GBM GEM TRP cells, we inject 2 µL of a 25 x 106 cells/ml solution, or 50,000 cells.\n2. Mouse strain\nBreed or purchase an appropriate mouse strain that matches the strain background of the brain tumor cells. For TRP cells, use 9-week-old B6D2F1/J mice (from a cross between C57BL/6J [B6] females and DBA/2J [D2] males) as tumor cell recipients.\n3. Setting up the surgical area",
    "NOTE: All surgical steps are conducted using aseptic technique in a clean, sanitized environment. Scrubs and personal protective equipment, including a mask, should be worn by the surgeon. Surgical tools must be heat-sterilized prior to use.\nPlace surface protectors under the stereotaxic apparatus and on the work surface.\nAttach the vinyl tubing from the anesthesia machine to the IN port of the gas anesthesia platform of the stereotaxic apparatus, and another tube to the OUT port.\nConnect the digital display to a power source and to the apparatus.\nConnect the micropump controller (Figure 1A) to a power source and attach the micropump (Figure 1A) to the manipulator arm of the apparatus (also see the manufacturer instructions).\nSet the micropump to 5.6 nL/s for the 2,000 nL volume injection.\nTurn on the hot bead sterilizer.\nPlug the mouse heating pad into the temperature controller and connect to a power source. Place the plate on the stage platform. Set the plate temperature to 37 °C.\nBackload a 30 G precision syringe, being careful not to introduce bubbles. Insert the plunger and attach the needle. Make sure to grip the needle by the hub only. Depress the plunger until a drop of the methylcellulose cell mixture dispenses through the needle. Clean the needle with a 70% alcohol preparation pad by carefully wiping the sides of the needle, or by placing a sterile gauze pad on the work surface and blotting it. Take care not to bend or break the needle.\nAttach the precision syringe to the micropump and rotate manipulator arm away from the stage, to prevent syringe-needle displacement prior to placing the mouse on the stage.\n4. Preparing the mouse for surgery",
    "Anesthetize the mouse by placing it in the induction chamber with the isoflurane vaporizer set to 2.5%, or according to institutional guidelines. Turn on the isoflurane flow to the nosecone.\nTransfer the mouse to the stereotaxic apparatus and secure to the nosecone, with the top teeth positioned onto the nosecone support (Figure 1B, 9). Tighten the knob on the nosecone to secure (Figure 1B). Ensure an appropriate level of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch to check for reflex.\n\t\nMonitor the ears, feet, and mucous membranes for color (pink) to ensure adequate oxygenation. Also, monitor the respiratory rate (an increase or decrease could indicate the need to adjust isoflurane levels).\nInsert ear bars (Figure 1B) into both ears and tighten the knob to secure the head.\nApply eye ointment to lubricate the eyes while the mouse is under anesthesia.\nUse curved forceps to pluck the hair on the mouse's head to an area about 150% larger than the planned incision, to ensure adequate aseptic conditions.\nInject 0.5-1 mg/kg buprenorphine SR analgesia subcutaneously, or use another protocol-approved analgesic.\nPosition the mouse rectal probe to monitor internal temperature and prevent hypothermia due to anesthesia. Keep the mouse body temperature between 36.5 and 38.5 °C.\nSanitize the surgical field using outward circles, alternating between a surgical scrub and ethanol three times.\nUsing forceps to pull the skin taut, make an incision of approximately 1 cm with the scalpel blade, starting between the eyes. The bregma should be visible through the incision.\n\tNOTE: For proper sterile technique, touch the surgical site only with the tips of sterilized tools, and place tool tips down on a sterile surface only (such as the inside of an autoclaved tool pack).",
    "Use the wooden end of cotton-tipped applicator to scrape away excess connective tissue, and then the cotton end of another applicator to dry.\n5. Cell injection\nReturn the manipulator arm with the syringe attachment over the mouse, tightening the knob to secure. Use the X and Y knobs in the horizontal plane to move the syringe mount over bregma. Lower the needle using the Z knob to confirm the bregma position. Set the digital readout console to zero.\nUse the X and Y knobs and the corresponding digital readout to move the needle to the desired position. For the cortical cortex location, the appropriate coordinates are 3 mm posterior, 2 mm lateral right to the bregma, and 2 mm deep from the dura mater. Use the Z knob to move the needle to surface of skull.\nPuncture a hole in the skull using a 1 mL syringe with an attached 25 G needle. Place the bevel of the needle toward the 30 G precision syringe and needle, and carefully rotate the manipulator arm to the side. Using thumb and finger, roll the needle back and forth slowly with gentle pressure until the needle tip just pierces the skull cap.\nUse a cotton tipped applicator to dab any blood away from the needle hole. Replace the manipulator arm to the appropriate position with the loaded precision syringe needle above the hole. Align the tip of the needle with the hole, using the Z knob to lower the needle down to the brain dura, and set the digital readout console to zero.\nUsing the Z knob, lower the needle 1 mm, and then wait 1 min. Repeat until the desired depth is reached (2 mm as indicated).",
    "NOTE: The needle is lowered slowly to prevent additional damage to the surrounding brain tissue and back-flow of the cell solution.\nStart the micropump, and then monitor to ensure that the pump stops when 2 µL has been injected. This process should take about 6 min at the indicated speed. Then, wait 1 min prior to moving the needle.\n6. Removal of the needle and wound closure\nRaise the needle 1 mm and then wait 1 min. Repeat until the needle is completely free from the skull.\nIf necessary, use a cotton-tipped applicator to dab any blood away from the injection site.\nUsing the wooden end of a cotton-tipped applicator, take a small piece of bone wax (~1 mm) and shape it into a cone. Place it into the opening in the skull, pushing the wax into the hole.\nHeat forceps using a bead sterilizer and use them to melt remaining wax on the skull and smooth it.\nPlace roughly two drops of bupivacaine (anesthetic) solution into the incision and use forceps to pull the edges of skin together.\nPull the skin taut and place one or two wound clips to close the skin.\nPlace the mouse in a clean recovery cage on a heating pad in a draft-free area, and closely observe the mouse. Allow the mouse to wake up fully from the anesthesia, resuming normal activity, before returning it to regular housing.\nCheck on the mouse daily following the surgical procedure and administer pain management, according to institutional guidelines.\n\t\nIf buprenorphine SR (Step 4.6) is used for analgesia, the sustained-release formula lasts for 72 h. Repeat the injection only if visible pain or discomfort is present after 72 h. When performed correctly, the mice recover well from the intracranial injections and additional analgesia is not needed.",
    "Remove the staples 7-10 days post-surgery.\nMonitor tumor growth by live animal imaging (MRI).\n\t\nEuthanize the mice when humane endpoints are reached (i.e., if the animal loses 20% body weight or becomes hypothermic).\nDue to the invasive nature of these brain tumors, observe the mice for neurological symptoms, such as uneven gait, partial paralysis, spinning, or head tilt. Euthanize a mouse if any of these clinical signs of advanced tumor growth are observed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
