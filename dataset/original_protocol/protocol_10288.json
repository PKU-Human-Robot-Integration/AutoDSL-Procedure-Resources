    "All procedures were performed according to the National Institute of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals and followed institutional guidelines (Landesamt für Soziales, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Abt. Lebensmittel- und Veterinärwesen, Zentralstelle, Saarbrücken, Germany).\n1. Preparation of Surgical Instruments\nKeep ready the dissection scissors, surgical forceps, small preparation scissors, fine forceps and a sterile Petri dish with 15 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin) for harvesting epididymal fat pads.\nExpose the surgical instruments to a disinfecting solution for 5 min. Alternatively, sterilize them (steam sterilization; 121 °C, 20 min).\n2. Animals and Anesthesia\nChoose carefully the strain of the mice as indicated for the study and the subject under investigation.\n\tNOTE: In this study we used male wild-type C57BL/6 mice as donors for the harvesting of epididymal fat. Of interest, ad-MVF may be also isolated from transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive donor animals (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J)22. This bears the major advantage that the fragments are easily detectable by immunohistochemical staining of GFP after implantation into GFP-negative wild-type mice14.\nAnesthetize the animals with an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (15 mg/kg) and ketamine (75 mg/kg). Make sure that the animals are deeply anesthetized by performing a toe pinch with no response. Eye lubricant is not indicated as the donor animals are sacrificed after fat harvesting.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that analgesia and surgical sterility are in agreement with the respective guidelines of the country and institution where the experiments are planned.\n3. Harvesting of Epididymal Fat Pads\nTransfer the animal to an operation table. Place the animal in a supine position under a surgical stereomicroscope and confirm deep anesthesia using toe pinch.\nImmobilize the paws by taping them to a surgical drape and disinfect the abdomen with disinfecting solution.",
    "Separate the abdominal skin free of the underlying muscle layer with the dissection scissors.\nPerform a midline laparotomy with the dissection scissors and laterally unfold the flaps of the abdominal wall.\nBilaterally identify testis, epididymis and the epididymal fat pad using the fine forceps (Figure 1). Do not harm the intestinal structures to prevent fecal contamination of the fat pads.\nHarvest the epididymal fat pads with the small preparation scissors and the fine forceps under the stereomicroscope. Keep a safety margin of several mm between the epididymis and the fat to reduce the risk of accidental epididymal harvesting.\n\tNOTE: This procedure can also be performed without a stereomicroscope. However, this may further increase the risk of accidental injury of the epididymis and spermatic cords.\nTransfer the epididymal fat pads into a Petri dish containing 15 mL of DMEM pre-heated at 37 °C for the transport to the cell laboratory.\nSacrifice the animal by incision of the abdominal aorta or cervical dislocation.\n4. Isolation of ad-MVF\nPrepare three sterile Petri dishes with 15 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterile 14-mL polypropylene (PP) tubes, a sterile 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask, sterile 1.5-mL conical microcentrifuge tubes and sterilized fine scissors.\nWash the fat pads thrice in Petri dishes with 15 mL of PBS under a laminar flow hood.\nTransfer the fat into a 14-mL PP tube. Determine the volume of harvested fat tissue (in mL) by means of the tube scale. Mince the fat tissue mechanically with the fine scissors until a homogeneous tissue suspension is obtained.",
    "Transfer the minced tissue with two volumes of collagenase NB4G (0.5 U/mL PBS) into a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask by means of 10-mL measuring pipette. The total volume becomes thrice the volume of fat tissue measured in step 4.3. Perform tissue digestion in an incubator for 10 min under vigorous stirring by means of an automated stirrer (size of magnetic stir bar: 25 mm) at 37 °C and humidified atmospheric conditions with 5% CO2.\nObserve a small fraction (10 µL) of the digested tissue under a microscope to judge whether the digestion can be stopped. Ascertain that the digestate mainly contains \"free\" ad-MVF next to single cells, indicating the appropriate point to stop the enzymatic digestion process (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: This step requires experience with the procedure and is critical for the quality of isolated ad-MVF. Prolonged fat digestion results in a single-cell suspension without ad-MVF.\nNeutralize the enzyme with two volumes of PBS/20% FCS. The total volume becomes thrice the volume of the cell-vessel suspension in step 4.4. Transfer the cell-vessel suspension back into new PP tubes.\nIncubate the suspension for 5 min at 37 °C to separate ad-MVF from remaining fat by gravity. Then carefully remove the main fat supernatant with a 1-mL precision pipette. Repeat this cycle several times with a 100-µL precision pipette until the suspension appears to be fat-free.\nPut a 500-µm filter on top of a 50-mL conical centrifuge tube. Transfer the cell-vessel suspension with a 10-mL measuring pipette from the 14-mL PP tubes onto the filter membrane to remove remaining fat clots. Transfer the filtered suspension into new 14-mL PP tubes according to the number of individual ad-MVF isolates for the planned experiments.",
    "NOTE: For in vitro assays focusing on microvascular network formation, it may be beneficial to further purify the cell-vessel suspension to improve the imaging quality during microscopic analyses. For this purpose, the suspension may be additionally filtered once with a 20-µm filter to remove single cells from the ad-MVF collected on the filter.\nCentrifuge the cell-vessel suspension (600 x g, 5 min, room temperature) to obtain a pellet containing ad-MVF.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant until 1 mL is left. Resuspend the pellet with ad-MVF in this 1 mL and transfer the suspension into a 1.5-mL conical microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the ad-MVF suspension in the microcentrifuge tube (600 x g, 5 min) to obtain a pellet.\nRemove the supernatant to resuspend the pellet in the required final volume of PBS / 20% FCS.\n\tNOTE: The number of ad-MVF per isolate can be assessed by microscopic counting. For this purpose, 1/10 of the final cell-vessel suspension is diluted 1:10 in PBS and 100 µL of this dilution are transferred into a well of a 96-well plate. The entire number of ad-MVF exhibiting a vessel-like morphology is then counted and extrapolated to the whole isolate. The required ad-MVF concentration and purification can be individually adapted to the respective in vitro or in vivo application of the ad-MVF. This can include the embedding of ad-MVF in collagen gels for the in vitro analysis of microvascular network formation or the seeding of ad-MVF on scaffolds for in vivo implantation into tissue defects.\nSubscription Required.
