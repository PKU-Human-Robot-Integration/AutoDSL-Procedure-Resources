    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAAV injection and optical fiber implantation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThis step describes how to inject AAV expressing GCaMP7s at the site of the mouse SCN and implant an optical fiber for recording calcium signaling. By completing AAV injection and optical fiber implantation at the same time in one operation, we avoided the damage to mice caused by the second operation and the difficulty of positioning the SCN nucleus.\nAAV loading.\nMix AAV-VGAT-Cre and AAV-FLEX-GCaMP7s at a ratio of 1:2 (final virus titer) by pipetting.\nCut a small piece of parafilm and stick it on the adhesive slide, and pipette 3 μL of virus mixture onto the parafilm.\nFix the AAV injection pump on the stereotaxic apparatus, pipette the AAV into the glass micropipette, and mark the level of the virus suspension with an oil pen to observe the situation of AAV injection in real-time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1833-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The main experimental steps of AAV injection and fiber implantation\n(A) Load the AAV in the homemade syringe.\n(B) Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane.\n(C) Fix the head of the mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus.\n(D) Clean the surface of the skull with hydrogen peroxide.\n(E) Level the skull (Scale bar: 1mm).\n(F) Drill a hole in the skull at the bregma.\n(G) Mark the AAV injection and fiber implantation sites.\n(H) Inject AAV.\n(I and J) Implant the fiber tip.\n(K) Fix the optical fiber in place using dental cement.\n(L) Dock the optical fiber between the head of the mouse and the fiber patch cord connected by rotary joints.\nAnesthesia and skull leveling.",
    "Anesthetize a 2-month-old C57 wild-type mouse with 2.5% isoflurane, then fix its head on a stereotaxic apparatus; the concentration of isoflurane was maintained at 1.5% during surgery (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nTurn on the animal homeothermic system and adjust the temperature to 35°C。\nApply the proper amount of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse.\nCut the hair on the mouse head with scissors, and disinfect the scalp with 75% alcohol. Make an incision to expose the skull. Wash the surface of the skull with PBS and then wipe it with 3% hydrogen peroxide to show the sutures of the skull.\nSecure the skin of the head to the skull with 3 M tissue adhesive (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nSkull leveling (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nPlace the glass micropipette on the holder, dip the tip of the micropipette with the ink of the oil pen, move the micropipette to the bregma point of the mouse skull using the stereotaxic apparatus, lower the glass micropipette until it touches the skull surface, and set coordinates (X, Y, Z) to (0, 0, 0) mm.\nMove the micropipette up and 1 mm (a longer distance will make the leveling more precise) to the left of the bregma point and then lower the micropipette to the surface of the skull to read the Z-axis value.\nMove the micropipette to the right of the bregma point by 1 mm in the same way, and read the Z-axis value. If the Z-axis difference is ±0.01 mm, the left and right skull surfaces are considered to be at the same level, otherwise, continue to adjust the left and right heights.",
    "After the left and right horizontal adjustment is completed, return the micropipette to the bregma point and set the coordinates to zero, then move the micropipette upward and move it 4.2 mm to the lambda point. If the Z-axis reading is ±0.03 mm, the anteroposterior axis of the skull is considered level; otherwise, continue to adjust the front and rear heights. After confirming that the anterior and posterior skull surfaces are level, continue to check whether the left and right are still level. If so, the leveling step is completed.\nAAV injection.\nUse an 0.8 mm diameter skull drill to drill a hole with a diameter of about 1.5 mm at the bregma point of the mouse skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). Carefully remove the dura with ophthalmic forceps to expose the central blood vessel.\nLabel the AAV injection site. Move the glass micropipette to the position of coordinates (AP -0.05, ML +0.15, DV 0) mm, lower it to the cortical surface, record the distance X (about 250 μm) between the skull surface and the cortex, and mark it with ink (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nLabel the fiber implantation site. Move the glass micropipette further to the right by 0.15 mm, lower the micropipette to the surface of the cortex, and mark it with ink. Add PBS to the puncture hole dropwise to keep it moist.\nMount the syringe pump that contains the AAV on the stereotaxic apparatus. Move the syringe micropipette to the AAV injection site, zero the Z-axis coordinate and lower the micropipette to a depth of 5.85-X mm slowly.\nInject 150 nL of the mixed virus at a rate of 50 nL per minute, leave the glass micropipette in place for 10 min after injection, and then slowly withdraw it (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nOptical fiber implantation.",
    "Prepare an optical fiber tip with a diameter of 200 μm, a length of 6 mm, and a numerical aperture of 0.5. Clean the exposed part of the optical fiber with 75% alcohol and then remove the residual alcohol with sterile PBS (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nInstall the holder with the optical fiber tip on the stereotaxic instrument. Rotate the holder to the left at an angle of 5 degrees, then inhale the PBS on the cortical surface, move the optical fiber to the fiber implantation site, and set the coordinates to zero.\nPuncture the cortex of the fiber implantation site with a syringe needle, then drop a small amount of PBS again, and slowly lower the fiber tip to a depth of 5.65-X mm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nNote: If the cortex is not pierced with a syringe needle, it will be hard for the fiber to enter the tissue and cause considerable damage to the brain.\nOptical fiber fixation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nAspirate the PBS on the surface of the skull and cortex, and then drop a small amount of 3 M tissue adhesive to fill the drilled hole, and wait for the adhesive to completely turn into a solid.\nFirst fix the fiber at the junction site of the fiber tip and the skull with a small amount of dental cement (core fixation), and then fix the entire fiber tip to the skull surface with dental cement. Be careful to minimize contact between the dental cement and the scalp.\nWithdraw the optical fiber holder and put a dust cap on the fiber tip.\nCritical: If the tissue adhesive is not completely solidified, the optical fiber will not be fixed firmly, which will damage the mouse brain tissue during long-term recording, reduce the signal quality or record no calcium signal.",
    "House mice in individual cages and wait 2–3 weeks for virus expression.\nCalcium signal recording and analysis\nTiming: 12 days\nThis step describes the software settings, screening of positive mice, long-term calcium signal recording, analysis, and SCN slice verification. Through the method of screening first and recording later, we can reduce the overall time of the experiment and ensure that a batch of experiments can get enough positive results.\nWait 3 weeks for mice to recover after surgery. After the mice are anesthetized with isoflurane, the dust cap on the mouse head should be removed and docked with the fiber patch cord (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L). The mice should be placed in the recording cage, and food and water should then be added.\nRecording software settings.\nTurn on the multi-channel fiber optic recording instrument and the software. After selecting the recording channel, set the sampling rate to 30 Hz, the exposure time to 30 ms, the gain to 10, and adjust the 470 nm LED light power to 15% and the 410 nm LED light power to 10%. (The light power is about 10–15 μW.).\nSelect the interval recording mode, with a recording time of 35 s and an interval time of 565 s; that is, 35 s will be recorded every 10 min.\nSelect the storage location for the record file, close the recording box, turn off the lights in the room, and click record to start. Minimize human activity around the instrument during recording.\nMice screening (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1833-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Protocols for screening of positive mice using Inper Data Process software",
    "By importing raw data (step 1, Data Source), removing invalid data (step 2, De-Inter), extracting valid data (step 3, Extract Trend), displaying normalized calcium signal data (step 4, deinter_MCorrected) and displaying baseline reference signal data (step 5, deinter_control_signals), mice with obvious rhythmic calcium signals within one day can be selected as positive mice (the recorded signal is from the SCN). This graph shows data from two positive mice.\nOne day after recording, import the raw data with the Inper Data Process software.\nRemove the invalid 565 s of data with De-Inter.\nExtract the 35 s of valid date with Extract Trend.\nSelect deinter_MCorrected on the upper panel to display the normalized calcium signal with blue color.\nSelect deinter_conrol_signals to display the baseline reference signal (environmental noise) of the 410 nm channel in purple color in the lower panel.\nScreen the mice with rhythmic calcium signaling by the above method.\nAfter recording for 9.5 days in screened mice, use the same method described in step 10 and get the result of normalized raw SCN calcium signals.\nUse the SQLiteStudio software to extract the deinter_MCorrected data from normalized raw data, and store it in CSV format.\nNote: To avoid a baseline difference caused by the inconsistent virus expression of each mouse, it is acceptable to normalize the data from 0 to 100. Normalization will have little effect on the results when exploring changes in SCN circadian phase. While external stimuli can affect SCN amplitude, we do not recommend data normalization.\nVisualize calcium signal data by PyCharm software and related codes (4-channels data, from c-1 to c-4)。\nSelect the path of the CSV file in the 135 lines of code (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1833-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Visualization of long recorded calcium signals using code",
    "(A) Change the storage path of the CSV file to be analyzed.\n(B) Change the format of the output image, including SVG and PNG formats. (True means output, False means no output.) Change the frequency resolution of the calcium signal wavelet analysis. The larger the value is, the more frequency bands will be analyzed.\nSelect the output file format and the frequency resolution of the wavelet analysis in lines 157–167 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nRun the code to output calcium signal visualization results and energy value files of calcium signals at different frequencies. The frequency parameters can be adjusted manually.\nSlice verification of the recording site.\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital.\nLay the mouse on its back with its limbs fixed on the foam board. Open the mouse chest to expose the heart. The needle for perfusion should be inserted into the left ventricle, and the needle should be fixed; then, the right atrium should be cut, and the mouse should be perfused with 10 mL of 1× PBS and 10 mL of 4% PFA solution.\nCarefully pull out the optical fiber and dental cement on the surface of the mouse skull, collect the mouse brain tissue, and place it in 4% PFA for 48 h at 4°C.\nCut 40–50 μm coronal sections with a Leica vibratome and collect them in 24-well plates containing 1× PBS.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, observe whether there is a tissue defect at the position of the optical fiber implantation.\nPick up the brain slice where the optical fiber implantation site is located, put it into 1× PBS solution containing 10000× DAPI and incubate for 5 min, then wash the brain slice with 1× PBS for 5 min.",
    "Add about 50 μL of 1× PBS solution dropwise to the adhesive slide. After it forms droplets, spread the brain slices in the droplets, remove the droplets and air dry at room temperature. Then, seal the slides with 50% glycerol and nail polish.\nTake pictures using a fluorescence microscope.\nOptional: For clearer seeing of the damaged area caused by optical fiber, it is necessary to get brain slice by cryostat to check the fiber position. Alternatively, it is more convenient and quicker to use a vibratome in processing multiple brain samples."
