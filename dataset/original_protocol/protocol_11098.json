    "The study was approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent before screening.\n1. Game Contents Development\nNOTE: The mobile game-based upper extremity virtual reality program for patients with stroke (MoU-Rehab) consists of mobile game applications.\nInstall the studio and environment for development using a programing language.\nCollect data on x, y and z-axis locations of patients' movements through the built-in sensors of the smartphone.\nAllocate storage for data on the motion, location, and velocity with the following source code:\n\tfloat[ ] gravity_data = new float[3];\n\tfloat[ ] accel_data = new float[3];\n\tfloat[ ] m_acc_data = new float[3];\n\tfinal float alpha = (float)0.8;\n\tGather data measured by the built-in sensor with the following source code.\n\tSensorManager sm = (SensorManager) getSystemService(SENSOR_SERVICE);\n\tSensor mSensor = sm.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);\nSend the data to the tablet PC after image processing through the short-distance wireless connection to display x, y, and z-coordinates as images on the screen.\nDesign all game applications to improve the strength, endurance, range of motion, control, speed, and accuracy of movement in the upper extremity.\n\tNOTE: Board-certified physiatrists (rehabilitation medicine doctors) and occupational therapists gathered and discussed what therapeutic maneuvers would be appropriate to transform into game programs. Movements in each joint was targeted based on the conventional occupational therapy methods that promote the recovery of upper limb function and improve the strength, endurance, range of motion, control, speed, and accuracy of movement in the upper extremity\nRecommend game applications to each patient according to their upper extremity function measured by the Brunnström stage.",
    "NOTE: The Brunnström stage (B-stage) for the arm and hand evaluates the upper extremity recovery stages (1=flaccid, no voluntary movements; 7= normal function)16. For example, patients categorized as Brunnström stage 1 used applications that induce shoulder flexion/extension movements with the assistance of the unaffected arm. Patients categorized as Brunnström stage 5 used applications that require precise control of movements.\nAdjust the level of difficulty of the game applications individually, by changing the speed, maintenance time for the specific posture, and range of motion according to the severity of the upper extremity dysfunction. Refer to the examples with detailed information as below (Figure 2).\n2. Study Design\nNOTE: A quasi-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the program's feasibility and effectiveness. Participants who (1) were diagnosed with ischemic stroke; (2) had the ability to follow a one-step command; (3) had the medical stability to participate in active rehabilitation, and (4) had upper extremity impairment, were included. Patients were excluded if they (1) had delirium, confusion, or other severe consciousness problems, (2) suffered from uncontrolled medical conditions, (3) were unable to follow commands because of severe cognitive impairment, (4) had a visual disturbance, and (5) had poor sitting balance. Participants were recruited at the university hospital.\nTo make the participants completely blinded to the group assignment, assign them to either control or experimental group by admission period because participants needed to share the OT room.\nEnsure that the patients in the intervention group received 30 min of conventional OT and 30 min of the mobile game-based VR upper extremity rehabilitation program using a smartphone and a tablet PC.\nEnsure that the patients in the control group received conventional OT alone for 1 h per day.",
    "NOTE: The rehabilitation program for both groups consisted of 10 sessions of therapy, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks.\nEducate the patients in the intervention group on how to use the program in the first treatment session, although each game application provided brief instructions at the beginning. Ensure that the patients used the program for 30 min on their own during the study.\nAssess the outcome measurements at the beginning, at the end of the treatment and at a one-month follow-up.\nLet a single blinded evaluator who is an experienced occupational therapist perform all the clinical assessments during all the testing sessions.\n\tNOTE: The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity (FMA-UE), which measures the motor function of the patients' hemiparetic arm (0 = lowest score; 66 = highest score).17 The secondary outcome was evaluated by the Brunnström stage (B-stage) for the arm and hand and manual muscle testing (0–5).\n3. Usage of Mobile Game-based VR Upper Extremity Rehabilitation Program\nHave the participant sit on the desk.\nPlace the tablet PC on the desk and turn the tablet PC on.\nTurn the smartphone on and turn on the short-distance wireless connection on the smartphone.\nSelect the game application on the tablet PC by touching the screen of the tablet PC.\nEnable short-distance wireless connection on the tablet PC and connect to the smartphone.\nPut the smartphone in the armband and attach the armband to the upper arm or forearm using a commercially available smartphone armband according to the desired movement.\nChoose either the basic version or the customized version.\nSelect the game speed, time, a number of target movements, and the expected achievement of the game on the touchscreen of the tablet PC on the customized version according to the participants’ ability.",
    "Let the participant touch the start button. Ask the participant to take a posture following the commands of the game. Move the maximal range of motion for calibration.\nStart playing the game and move to the next game when the game ends (generally 5–10 min long).\n\"Honey Pot Guard\" Game\n\t\tNOTE: This game targets the elbow flexion and extension motion.\n\t\t\nAsk the patients to beat a bear from the honey pot by throwing apples using the movement of the elbow joint.\nLet the patient throw apples when the flexed elbow is extended.\nAdjust the level of difficulty by the location where the bear appears and the speed at which a new bear appears based on the available range of motion and speed of the motion in the patient's elbow joint.\n\"Protect the Bunny\" Game\n\t\tNOTE: This game targets the shoulder abduction and adduction motion.\n\t\t\nAsk the patients to protect the bunny by catching stones with a net using the movement of the shoulder joint.\nEnsure that the net moves when the adducted shoulder is abducted.\nAdjust the level of difficulty by the location where the stone appears and the speed with which a new stone appears based on the available range of motion and speed of motion in the patient's shoulder joint.\n\"Put out Fire\" game\n\t\tNOTE: This game targets the shoulder abduction and adduction or shoulder flexion and extension.\n\t\t\nAsk the patients to put the fire out with the water hose through the window; the water hose is moved according to the motion of the shoulder.\nEnsure that the water hose moves right and left and up and down according to the motion of the shoulder joint; the time needed to put out the fire depends on the size of the fire.",
    "Adjust the level of difficulty by the location where the fire appears, the speed with which a new fire appears, and the size of the fire based on the available range of motion and the speed and endurance of motion of the patient’s shoulder joint.\n\"Flower Splash\" game\n\t\tNOTE: This game targets the shoulder abduction and adduction, elbow flexion and extension, or wrist pronation and supination motion.\n\t\t\nAsk the patients to water the moving seed with a watering can by the motion of the joint and make the flowers blossom.\nEnsure that when the seed moves, the watering follows according to the motion of the joint.\nAdjust the level of difficulty by the moving speed of the seed with respect to the accuracy and speed of motion.\nTrack the patients' upper extremity movements by the built-in sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) of the smartphone, and transfer information about the movement to the tablet PC through the short-distance wireless connection.\nProvide visual and auditory feedback for patients on their movement with the display on the tablet PC.\nDemonstrate the real achievement of the game as compared with the expected achievement at the end of the game.\nSubscription Required.
