    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCloning of sgRNAs into pX459\nTiming: 1 week\nThe vector pX459 can be used to express sgRNA, Cas9 and the selection marker puromycin in the same cell (a map of pX459 is provided at https://www.addgene.org/62988/[href=https://www.addgene.org/62988/]). The described cloning procedure was modified from (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nAnnealing and phosphorylation of oligonucleotides.\nReconstitute oligonucleotides in ddH2O to 100 μM.\nPhosphorylate and hybridize reconstituted oligonucleotides.\nPrepare the following reaction in a 200 μL PCR tube and incubate in a thermocycler for 30 min at 37°C followed by 5 min at 95°C. Ramp down temperature from 95°C to 25°C at 5°C/min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1326_3.csv\nDilute hybridized oligonucleotides 1:250 in ddH2O to obtain a 80 nM sgRNA solution.\nRestriction and ligation into pX459.\nPrepare the following reaction in a 200 μL PCR tube and incubate in a thermocycler for 6 cycles at 37°C for 5 min followed by 23°C for 5 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1326_4.csv\nTransformation into chemically competent E. coli TOP10.\nTransform 50 μL of competent E. coli with 3 μL of the ligation reaction.\nFollow the heatshock protocol as described in the manufacturer’s manual (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C404010#/C404010[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C404010#/C404010]).\nPlate transformed cells onto LB agar plates containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin and incubate for 12–16 h at 37°C.\nPick a single bacteria colony into 3 mL of LB medium containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin and incubate for 12–16 h at 37°C and 200 rpm.\nIsolate plasmids from 1 mL of the bacteria culture using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit or other commercial kits.\nValidation of successful insertion of sgRNAs into pX459.\nPerform Sanger sequencing using a primer targeting the U6 promoter.\nAlign Sanger sequencing trace with the expected sgRNA sequence.\nIsolation of endotoxin-free plasmids for transfection.",
    "Inoculate 250 mL of LB containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin with 0.5 mL of the remaining bacterial culture containing the validated sgRNA plasmids and incubate for 14 h at 37°C and 200 rpm.\nIsolate plasmids using GeneJET Endo-free Plasmid Maxiprep Kit.\nAlternatives: Other commercial kits and techniques for plasmid isolation are available and can be used. Make sure to include an endotoxin-removal step during plasmid isolation as endotoxins will increase cytotoxicity during transfection.\nResuspend plasmids in sterile ddH2O and determine DNA concentration.\nPause point: Plasmids can be frozen and stored until later use.\nTransfection of neural precursor cells and single-cell plating\nTiming: 7 days\nNeural precursor cells are transfected with the respective plasmids pX459+sgRNA. Transfected cells are selected using puromycin treatment and plated at single-cell density to establish clonal cell lines (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1326-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation of clonal neural precursor cell cultures\nDepicted are bright field microscopy images of the neural precursor cell culture before gene editing (left), a neurosphere formed after plating of transfected cells (middle), and a neural precursor cell culture expanded from a single neurosphere (right). Scale bars: 50 μm.\nNote: This protocol describes the clonal expansion of single neural precursor cells as neurospheres. The outlined steps were optimized for the generation of clonal lines from neural precursor cells that had been isolated from the hippocampus of adult mice. For alternative protocols, which describe the clonal expansion of neural precursor cells derived from other stem cell niches as monolayers, please refer to (Bressan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Dewari et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPreparation of neural precursor cell cultures.\nDay 1: Passaging of neural precursor cells for transfection. Plate 500,000 cells per T25 flask.\nCulture cells for approximately 48 h until they reach 60% confluence.",
    "Day 3: Preparation of neural precursor cells for transfection. Perform a half-medium change: remove 3 mL of proliferation medium and replace it with 2.5 mL of fresh proliferation medium.\nTransfection of neural precursor cells (day 3).\nPreparation of transfection mix.\nPrepare dilution 1: mix Optimem reduced serum medium with 8 μL P3000 Reagent and 15 μg of plasmid to reach a volume of 250 μL.\nPrepare dilution 2: mix 240 μL Optimem reduced serum medium with 10 μL Lipofectamin.\nAdd dilution 1 to dilution 2, mix by brief vortexing and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–23°C.\nAdd transfection mix to cells, swirl plate, and incubate for 36 h in a cell culture incubator.\nNote: For deletion of gene regions, cells are transfected with two plasmids encoding the different sgRNAs (15 μg each plasmid).\nNote: The outlined lipofection protocol causes no visible signs of cytotoxity in mouse hippocampal neural precursor cells and yields transfection efficiencies of 10% with pX459+sgRNA, which is sufficient for generating clonal cell lines.\nAlternatives: Other transfection techniques applicable to neural precursor cells, such as nucleofection, magnetofection or nanoparticles, have been described elsewhere (Sapet et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Bressan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Wani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nAlternatives: Cas9 and sgRNAs can also be delivered to neural precursor cells by transduction. Make sure to choose the appropriate plasmid for virus-based delivery (https://www.addgene.org/crispr/cut/[href=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/cut/]).\nSelection of transfected cells (day 5).\nPrepare selection medium: add 2 μg/mL puromycin to proliferation medium.\nReplace proliferation medium with selection medium and incubate for 24 h in a cell culture incubator.\nNote: After incubation with selection medium, a high number of cells are expected to die. The percentage of surviving cells will depend on the transfection efficiency.\nFor recovery of cells, replace selection medium with proliferation medium (day 6).\nSingle-cell plating (day 7).",
    "Detach neural precursor cells from T25 flasks: remove medium, wash once with PBS and incubate with Accutase (0.5 mL/T25) for 5 min at 37°C (or until cells are detached).\nResuspend cells in 10 mL of wash medium and pellet for 5 min at 300 × g.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend cells in 10 mL proliferation medium and determine cell concentration using a Neubauer chamber.\nDilute 500 cells in 30 mL proliferation medium containing 2 μg/mL heparin. This corresponds to an approximate cell dilution of 16.7 cells/mL. Mix cell suspension and distribute into an uncoated 384-well-plate (75 μL/well).\nTo obtain sufficient numbers of neurospheres, we recommend to plate three 384-well-plates per sgRNA construct.\nIncubate for 14 days in a cell culture incubator to allow neurosphere formation.\nNote: Addition of heparin stabilizes growth factors such that medium changes are not necessary during the incubation period.\nCritical: Proper quantification and dilution of cells is critical. Too high cell concentrations increase the risk of obtaining mixed clonal lines. Too low cell concentrations reduce the numbers of neurospheres obtained.\nOptional: After single-cell plating, the cells that were not plated can be frozen or expanded as a mixed population and used to assess gene editing efficiency. Editing efficiency can be tested using methods such as the SURVEYOR assay described in detail in Ran et al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] or by PCR and sequencing. Please refer to the section “Validation of gene knockouts” below for a description of how to detect gene editing events by PCR and sequencing.\nExpansion of clonal neural precursor cell lines\nTiming: [2–4 weeks]\nClonal monolayer cultures of hippocampal neural precursor cells can be obtained by dissociating single neurospheres and expanding them as monolayers.\nObserve all wells of the 384-well-plate and label the wells that contain neurospheres (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])",
    "Note: Comparing total numbers and sizes of neurospheres obtained per plate between knockout and control cultures (transfected with sgRNA against lacZ) gives an estimate of the function of the manipulated gene for neural precursor cell proliferation.\nTransfer individual neurospheres into single wells of a poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well-plate using a 100 μL-pipet. Dissociate neurosphere in the 96-well by gently pipetting up and down 10 times.\nNote: Cells should attach within the next hours and expand as monolayer cultures (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nWhen the cells in the 96-wells reach 80% confluence, passage into 6-well-plate.\nWhen the cells in 6-well reach 80% confluence, split cells: Freeze 0.5 million cells and resuspend 50,000–100,000 cells in lysis buffer suitable for analysis of genomic DNA (for instance ATL buffer contained in QIAamp DNA Micro Kit).\nNote: At this point, cell lines were already expanded and are ready to be used for experiments directly after genotyping. For alternative strategies, in which cell lines are first genotyped and then expanded, please refer to (Bressan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Dewari et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPause point: Cell lines can be frozen at this step until later use.\nValidation of gene knockouts\nTiming: [2 days]\nGenotyping of neural precursor cell lines enables the identification and characterization of cultures with homozygous gene knockouts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1326-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Identification of homozygous knockout lines and representative analysis\n(A) Left, PCR-based amplification of the Hcar1 gene revealed a single product at the size of the shortened fragment in a Hcar1-modified clonal culture, suggesting that this culture contains a homozygous deletion. A product at the size of the wildtype fragment was observed in a control (lacZ-transfected) clonal culture. Right, Sanger sequencing of the purified PCR product from the Hcar1-modified clonal culture confirmed the deletion. Arrows indicate cutting site of Cas9.",
    "(B) Sequencing of the PCR product from the Atf3-modified clonal culture reveals a deletion of a single adenosine residue in allele 1 and an insertion of a single adenosine residue in allele 2. Both indels resulted in frameshifts, identifying this culture as a homozygous knockout of Atf3.\n(C and D) Representative analysis of knockout neural precursor cells. Proliferation of the modified cell lines can be assessed by BrdU assays as described in (Bernas et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). (D) The role of the modified genes in formation of neurons (Tubb3-positive) and astrocytes (Gfap-positive) can be analyzed by immunocytochemistry after differentiation of neural precursor cells as described in (Bernas et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Scale bars in (C and D): 50 μm.\nIsolation of genomic DNA from harvested cells using QIAamp DNA Micro Kit as outlined in the manufacturer’s manual (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/]) or using other DNA isolation techniques.\nAlternatives: Genotyping can also be performed using crude DNA extracts after resuspension and incubation of cells in home-made lysis buffer (Bressan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) or commercially available extraction solutions such as QuickExtractTM DNA Extraction Solution.\nAmplification of genomic sequence flanking the target region using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and the respective genotyping primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1326_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1326_6.csv\nRun 20 μL of each PCR product mixed with 4 μL of 6× loading dye on an 1% agarose gel.\nAnalyze gel and confirm single bands.",
    "Note: Deletions of larger gene regions using the dual sgRNA approach can be detected by a shift in band size of the PCR product. Homozygous deletions should exhibit single bands at the size of the expected mutated fragment and no PCR product at the size of the wildtype fragment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). PCR products at the size of the wildtype fragment can indicate either wildtype alleles or indel formation (e.g., after cutting at the target sequence of only one of the sgRNAs). Since indels can lead to loss-of-function mutations, identification of heterozygous gene knockouts requires sequencing of the PCR product.\nCritical: Knockouts using the single sgRNA approach (formation of indels) cannot be detected by PCR but must be verified by sequencing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Homozygous knockouts must contain indels that result in frameshifts in both of the two alleles. Heterozygous knockouts must contain one wild-type allele and one allele with frameshift mutation.\nPurify the remaining PCR product (which was not loaded onto the gel) using QIAGEN PCR purification kit or other techniques.\nSanger sequencing of the PCR product and alignment of the obtained sequence to the reference sequence of the respective mouse gene.\nNote: To obtain sequences of both alleles, mixed Sanger sequencing traces can be deconvoluted using online tools such as TIDE (http://shinyapps.datacurators.nl/tide/[href=http://shinyapps.datacurators.nl/tide/]), CRISP-ID (http://crispid.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/[href=http://crispid.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/]) or other deconvolution techniques. Please refer to the respective webpages for detailed instructions.\nAlternatives: Parallel sequencing of the PCR product (MiSeq) enables quick and accurate detection of indel formation in both alleles and does not require deconvolution of a mixed trace (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nNote: Knockouts of coding genes should be validated at the protein level using western blot or immunocytochemistry with protein-specific antibodies."
