    "Expression of His-tagged CARD1 ectodomain in apoplastic space of N. benthamiana Note: We expressed non-tagged CARD1ecto, and purified it by conventional column chromatographies in our previous study (Laohavisit et al., 2020). Although it is possible to purify non-tagged proteins, the purification procedure is simpler in His-tagged proteins. Clone the nucleotide sequence encoding CARD1 from Arabidopsis genomic DNA (amino acids 1–546) into the pEAQ-HT vector, in frame with a His tag at C-terminus (CARD1ecto-His), using standard molecular biology techniques (Figure 1).Notes:  The native signal peptide of CARD1 should be intact, so that CARD1ecto-His is secreted into the apoplastic space. In the pEAQ-HT vector system, a gene of interest is inserted between a modified 5’-untranslated region (UTR) and the 3’-UTR from Cowpea mosaic virus RNA-2, and co-expressed together with silencing suppressor p19 (Sainsbury et al., 2009; Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008). This permits an extremely high-level and rapid production of proteins of interest (see Figure 1). We used genomic DNA to clone the construct, but cDNA should also work. For His-tag at C-terminus, pEAQ-HT should be digested with AgeI and SmaI restriction enzymes (Figure 1, see Sainsbury et al., 2009 for details). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4387/bioprotoc-12-08-4387-g001.jpgFigure 1. The pEAQ-HT vector map. Top, a simplified pEAQ-HT vector map. Bottom, a close-up of the restriction enzyme map.After sequence confirmation, transform electrocompetent cells of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 with pEAQ-CARD1ecto-His, using an electroporation system (machine default settings for Agrobacterium tumefaciens are capacitor = 25 μF, pulse controller = 200 Ω, and Voltage = 2.4 kV). Plate out the transformed cells onto LB agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin.Confirm the Agrobacterium colonies with correct transformation using PCR, and make glycerol stocks for long term storage.",
    "Pick a fresh colony or take a small portion of the glycerol stocks of Agrobacterium into 5 mL of LB liquid media supplemented with 100 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubate it with shaking at 120 rpm at 28°C overnight.Dilute 2 mL of overnight culture with 18 mL of fresh LB liquid media supplemented with 100 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and incubate with shaking at 120 rpm and 28°C for 4 h.Centrifuge the Agrobacterium at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.Add 10 mL of Agroinfiltration buffer, and resuspend the pellet.Repeat steps 6–7.Measure OD600 of the suspension and adjust it to 0.3.Infiltrate the Agrobacterium suspension into whole leaves of 5-weeks-old N. benthamiana from the abaxial side, using 1 mL needleless syringes. The infiltrated area should turn darker in color compared to the unfiltrated area (Yin et al., 2017).Note: In our experiment, we infiltrated approximately 30 leaves to obtain approximately 1 mg of highly purified CARD1ecto-His protein. For other proteins of interest, it is recommended that the experimenter perform small-scale pilot experiments (for instance, 8–10 leaves per construct) to ascertain how much protein can be obtained, since different proteins will show different expression levels. Extraction of apoplastic fluid from N. benthamiana leavesAfter 4–7 days post inoculation, harvest the infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves and pile them together, such that the abaxial side of the leaves points upward.Carefully place the pile of leaves into a 500-mL Pyrex beaker containing 150 mL of vacuum-infiltration buffer. Afterward, place a 300-mL Pyrex beaker on top of the pile, such that leave samples are submerged in buffer (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4387/bioprotoc-12-08-4387-g002.jpgFigure 2. Set-up for vacuum infiltration.",
    "Place the assembled beaker (with leave samples) into a vacuum desiccator, and apply a pressure of 60 hPa for 10 min using a pump (or other appropriate equipment). Bubbles should be released from the leaves.Slowly release the pressure inside the desiccator. We usually allow at least 10 min for the pressure to return to normal.Note: In this step, expanded air bubbles in the apoplastic space shrink significantly and vacuum-infiltration buffer will replace this space. The color of the leaves should turn darker as the apoplastic space has been filled with buffer. If you do not notice any differences, this suggests that the vacuum infiltration process has not been successful, and step 3 should be carefully repeated. Carefully take out individual leaves from the beaker and gently remove excess buffer using paper towels. Set these aside.Meanwhile, assemble the apoplastic fluid collection unit. This consists of the following materials:20-mL single-use needleless plastic syringe with the plunger removed (i.e., only the barrel part is needed)50-mL centrifuge tubes, non-skirtedTo assemble the apoplastic fluid collection unit, simply place the barrel part of a 20-mL sized syringe into a 50-mL centrifuge tube (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4387/bioprotoc-12-08-4387-g003.jpgFigure 3. Set-up of the apoplastic fluid collection unit. Per apoplastic fluid collection unit, take 6–8 leaves from step 5 and separate them into two piles (3–4 leaves per pile). Next, carefully roll the leaves from one pile (from the base to the apex of the leaf) and place this into the barrel part of the apoplastic fluid collection unit. The abaxial or adaxial sides can be faced in any direction. Repeat for the second pile (Figure 3B).Note: For our experiment, we used approximately 30 leaves to purify CARD1ecto-His protein, which corresponded to 6 apoplastic fluid collection units.",
    "Place the apoplastic fluid collection units (with leaves) in a swing rotor, and centrifuge at 1,500 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Note: Centrifugation should be performed using a swing rotor, to maximize recovery of the apoplast fluid. Apoplastic fluid should appear at the bottom of the 50-mL centrifuged tubes. Transfer the fluid to a separate tube and centrifuge again at 1,500 × g and 4°C for 3 min, to ensure all fluid has been extracted. Finally, pool all the apoplastic fluid into a single tube.Centrifuge the collected apoplastic fluid from step 9 at 10,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Collect the supernatant, and centrifuge it again at 10,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Filter the supernatant with a GD/X syringe filter. The resulting filtrate is now ready for the next step of purification.Note: The filter unit should have a 0.45 µm pore size. CARD1ecto-His purification by Ni2+-affinity chromatographyNote: Monitor the absorbance at 280 nm to detect proteins throughout the purification process. Connect a HisTrap excel column (capacity of 5 mL) to an FPLC system (such as the AKTA pure), and wash this column with 25 mL of ultrapure water (5 column volumes, CV) at 5 mL/min (1 CV/min).Note: Wash volume and the flow rate should be adjusted according to the column size used. Equilibrate the column with 25 mL (5 CV) of equilibration buffer at 5 mL/min (1 CV/min).Load the apoplastic fluid sample onto the column with a superloop at 2.5 mL/min (0.5 CV/min).Note: Depending on your FPLC machine configuration and your sample volume, you can also load your sample manually. Wash the column with 25 mL (5 CV) of wash buffer at 5 mL/min (1 CV/min).Elute the His-tagged protein with 25 mL (5 CV) of elution buffer at 5 mL/min (1 CV/min).",
