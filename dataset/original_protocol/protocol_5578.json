    "Maintenance of BON cellsBON cells are neuroendocrine tumor cells that are derived from a metastasized human pancreatic tumor (Parekh et al., 1994). They contain numerous DCVs and secrete serotonin, neurotensin and pancreastatin under stimulatory conditions (Parekh et al., 1994). Due to their relatively large DCVs and rapid growth, BON cells are good models to study DCV exocytosis (Karatekin et al., 2008; Samuel Tran et al., 2004).BON cells are cultured in 10 cm tissue culture dishes with 10 ml culture medium (see Recipes) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.BON cells are typically split every three days at a 1:5 or 1:6 ratio. To split cells from a confluent 10 cm dish:Wash BON cells with 5 ml HANK’s (with 1 mM EDTA) buffer (see Recipes).Add 1 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min to detach cells. Add 5 ml normal culture medium and mix well with cells to terminate trypsinization, transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical centrifugation tube and pellet cells by a low-speed centrifugation (1,000 x g, 5 min).Resuspend cells with 5 or 6 ml normal culture medium and add 1 ml to each 10 cm dish with 9 ml culture medium inside.For siRNA transfection, we recommend using BON cells 48 h after splitting, when cells are healthy and growing at log phase.NPY-Venus secretion assayThe NPY-Venus secretion assay uses BON cells that stably express NPY-Venus, which can be obtained from the Martin Lab or generated by following the steps described in Procedure D ‘Establishing NPY-Venus-expressing cell lines’. All the volumes in this section are for one well of a 96-well plate.siRNA transfectionMix siRNA and transfection reagents in 96-well plates with either Metafectamine SI or RNAiMAX.",
    "For each siRNA treatment, we recommend having 8 replicates, with 4 of them used to determine Ca2+-stimulated secretion and the other 4 for background secretion (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101173313_0545.jpgPrepare BON cell suspension with a concentration of 1.8 x 105 cells/ml in normal growth medium (see Procedure A). Add 100 μl cell suspension to siRNA mixture after the incubation step is complete. Leave the plate at room temperature for 10 min before transferring to tissue culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Incubate cells for 48 h before conducting the secretion assays.Prepare buffersPrewarm PSS-Na (see Recipes) to 37 °C.Prepare stimulation buffer by adding ionomycin (dissolved in DMSO, 5 mM stock) to PSS-Na at a final concentration of 1.25 μM. Each well designed for stimulation requires ~100 μl stimulation buffer.Prepare control buffer by adding DMSO to PSS and make sure DMSO concentration (1/4,000 dilution if ionomycin stock solution is 5 mM) is identical to that in the stimulation buffer. Each well designed as control requires ~100 μl control buffer.Prepare lysis buffer by adding Triton X-100 to PSS at a final concentration of 1%. Each well requires ~100 μl lysis buffer.Stimulate cells for secretion (Figure 1B)Remove culture medium with a multichannel aspirator. Wash cells with 200 μl pre-warmed PSS-Na once and remove washing buffer. Add 100 μl stimulation buffer or control buffer to the cells. Incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Transfer 95 μl supernatant to a 96-well assay plate. Avoid disrupting cells. Add plain buffers (stimulation and control buffer) to 3 empty wells for background normalization. Keep the plate in the dark. Add 95 μl lysis buffer to cells, and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.Use a pipette to mix cells with lysis buffer and then transfer 95 μl to a 96-well assay plate.",

A graphic summary of the NPY-Venus secretion assay. A. Plate design for an example experiment of testing two siRNAs of interest. A positive control siRNA that is known to inhibit NPY-Venus secretion (e.g., CADPS siRNA) and a negative control siRNA that is known not to affect NPY-venus secretion (e.g., Dharmacon non-targeting siRNA D-001210-03-20) should always be included in each experiment. 8 wells are used for each siRNA with 4 wells for stimulation with ionomycin/Ca2+ and the other 4 for background secretion. 6 wells are left blank so that the same wells on the black assay plates (see B) can be used for determining the background fluorescence of plain buffer. pos control siRNA: positive control siRNA; neg control siRNA: negative control siRNA. B. Steps of the NPY-Venus secretion assay. From left to right: conduct reverse transfection with siRNAs; after two days of incubation, remove culture medium and wash cells with pre-warmed PSS-Na; stimulate cells with PSS-Na containing either ionomycin or DMSO and then transfer the supernatant to a black assay plate; lyse cells with 1% Triton X-100 and then transfer to a black assay plate; add plain buffer to the reserved wells (see A) and then determine NPY-Venus fluorescence with a plate reader. Refer to texts for details.Measure NPY-VenusDetermine NPY-Venus fluorescence in supernatant and lysates by a Tecan plate reader. We recommend using a monochromatic plate reader (excitation 505/20 nm, emission 535/10 nm), but we were also successful using the filter sets for GFP/FITC (excitation 485/20 nm, emission 535/25 nm). The NPY-Venus secretion assay can be adapted to high throughput screening with the help of automated liquid handling systems.For siRNA transfection, deliver 1.",
    "2 μl siRNA from siRNA library to 96-well plates with a multichannel pipette or an automated liquid handling system.For siRNA transfection, deliver 100 μl cell suspension to siRNA mixture by an automated liquid handling system (Biotek Microflo dispenser). For NPY-Venus secretion, conduct all the liquid handling steps with an automated liquid handling system (Thermo Scientific Matrix Hydra DT 96-well liquid handler).3H-serotonin secretion assayThe serotonin secretion assay uses parental BON cells. The NPY-Venus cell lines should also work, although we haven’t tested them for this assay. Please be advised that the serotonin secretion assay deals with radioactivity and therefore the experiment has to be carried out according to local regulations in a radioactivity laboratory and waste has to be disposed of properly. All the volumes in this section are for one well of a 96-well plate.siRNA transfection.Follow the steps as described in Step B1 (see Note 2). Load cells with 3H-serotonin 24 h after siRNA transfection by adding the following mixture to each well (do NOT replace culture medium).3H-serotonin (1 mCi/ml): 0.2 μlL-ascorbic acid (150 mM) (see Recipes): 0.33 μlH2O: 1.47 μlTotal: 2 μlMeasure serotonin secretion after 18 h incubation with 3H-serotonin.Follow the same steps as described in Step B3, except that:For Step B3d: instead of transferring supernatant to assay plates, collect them into 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge to remove intact cells and cell debris. For Step B3f: instead of transferring cell lysates to assay plates, simply transfer them to tubes for scintillation counting. No centrifugation is required.After centrifugation, transfer secretion buffer and cell lysates into new scintillation counting tubes and quantify 3H-serotonin with a scintillation counter.",
    "Establishing NPY-Venus-expressing cell lines We have generated two stable BON cell lines, H8 and F6, that express DCV cargo, NPY-Venus (see Note 3 for differences), which can be obtained from the Martin Lab. Alternatively, one may generate NPY-Venus-expressing cell lines by the following steps. Please be advised that lentivirus packaging and transduction experiments should be conducted in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory and wastes should be disposed of according to local regulations.Lentivirus packagingSplit 2.5 x 106 HEK293FT cells to each 10 cm tissue culture plate, and incubate cells overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The next morning, transfect HEK cells for lentivirus generation with the following protocol: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101173952_8263.jpg6-8 h after transfection, remove medium from cells and replace with viral production medium (DMEM with 30% FBS, see Recipes).24 h after transfection, replace with fresh viral production medium again. 48-60 h after transfection, collect culture medium and properly dispose of cells. Centrifuge culture medium at low-speed (1,000 x g, 5 min) to remove dead cells and cell debris, then filter supernatant through a 0.45 μm pore membrane and collect in a 32 ml sterile polycarbonate ultracentrifugation tube.Pellet lentiviral virions by ultracentrifugation at 33,000 rpm (or 11,000 x g), 4 °C for 2 h in a Ti70 Beckman rotor. Carefully take out the centrifugation tube and mark the position of the viral pellet at the outside wall of the tube near the bottom. Carefully remove the supernatant and add 100 μl cold sterile PBS to cover the viral pellet. Incubate in cold room (4 °C) overnight. The next morning, use a pipette to resuspend a few times and aliquot concentrated viral solution (20 μl each) into separate tubes. Store viral solution at -80 °C or use immediately. Avoid repeated freeze and thaw.Lentiviral transductionSeed 1.",
    "5 x 104 BON cells into each well of a 96-well plate (5 wells in total). Incubate overnight to allow cell attachment. The next afternoon, transduce BON cells by replacing medium with the following lentiviral solution. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101174146_2291.jpg18 h after transduction, remove lentiviral-containing medium and replace with fresh culture medium.48-72 h after transduction, check NPY-Venus expression with a fluorescence microscope. Choose one well where the majority of cells are healthy and fluorescent for single cell screening (see Note 4).Single cell screeningTrypsinize NPY-Venus expressing cells and make a cell solution. Seed cells to 96-well plates with a FACS sorter (1 cell/well) or by serial dilution (0.5 cell/well). Place the plates in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.After about a week, check the plates and mark wells that have a single clone. Discard empty wells or wells that have multiple clones.Frequently check candidate wells and replace medium if necessary. When cells grow into aggregates with hundreds of cells, vigorously pipette with a 200 μl pipette tip to disperse into single cells.Continue to culture the cells until they cover > 50% area of a well. Check cells by fluorescence microscopy and choose clones that express NPY-Venus for the next step. Split candidate clones into three separate 96-well plates and incubate for 48 h. Use two plates for screening. Follow the steps described in Procedure B to select clones that have high percent secretion with ionomycin stimulation and low percent secretion with DMSO control. Keep the best clones (1~3) and discard the rest. Expand cells, freeze some vials in freezing medium (see Recipes) and store liquid nitrogen."
