The doubling time during exponential growth will be ∼3 h for the S. acidocaldarius strain DSM639 and ∼4.5 h for the S. islandicus strain E233S, but these times could be variable if mutant strains are grown or different growth media employed..\nCritical: The culture is hot and needs to be handled with care.\nDay 2\nTiming: 2 h\nFix cells as follows. It is important to take a cell culture and mix it with formaldehyde as quickly as possible. Also, make sure to incubate the mixture at 25°C. Variation in the temperature during fixation could lead to variable fixation efficiency (see troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more detail).\nTake 20 mL of the culture while keeping the flask in the water bath. Quickly mix it with 80 mL of ambient Fixation Buffer (approximately 20°C). Use Fixation Buffer containing 2.5% formaldehyde for S. acidocaldarius (the final concentration is 2% after the mixture) and 5% for S. islandicus (the final concentration is 4% after the mixture).\nIncubate the mixture for 30 min at 25°C with agitation (110 rpm).\nAdd 5.6 mL of 2.5 M glycine to quench the crosslink reaction. When fixation is carried out with 4% of formaldehyde, add 11.2 mL of 2.5 M glycine instead.\nIncubate the mixture for 10 min at 21°C without agitation.\nWash the fixed cells as follows.",
    "Dispense the mixture into two 50-mL tubes and centrifuge them at 3,120 × g for 30 min, 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant but leave ∼2 mL of it in each tube to avoid loss of cells.\nResuspend the cells in the left supernatant and dispense the suspension into as many 1.5-mL tubes as you need.\nSpin down for 2 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellets together in a total of 1 mL ice-cold 1× PBS.\nSpin down for 2 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS.\nRepeat the sub-step f.\nStore the pellet at −80°C.\nNote: The fixed pellet can be kept at least for a month.\nDNA digestion followed by proximity ligation\nTiming: 11 h or 1 day\nThis section describes how to digest crosslinked cellular DNA with HindIII. Generated 5’-overhangs are filled in using a biotin-conjugated nucleotide and then treated with ligase to join DNA fragments crosslinked to each other. Ligation junctions are purified with streptavidin at a later step.\nResuspend a cell pellet in 320 μL of 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA (for S. acidocaldarius) or 1 × NEBuffer 2 (for S. islandicus).\nMix 20 μL of the suspension with 780 μL of 1× PBS to measure OD600.\nDilute the remainder of the cell suspension to an OD600 of 4. For the dilution, use the same buffer as used in step 6. Use 400 μL of the diluted cell suspension for subsequent steps.\nIf you are using S. acidocaldarius, treat cells with proteinase K as follows to partially disrupt the cell wall. Skip this step when using S. islandicus.",
    "Dilute proteinase K solution to 2 mg/mL in 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA. Add 4.8 μL of the diluted proteinase K solution and incubate the sample for 20 min at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nImmediately spin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nFor wash, resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA and spin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nRepeat sub-step c three times for a total of 4 washing steps.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL of ice-cold 1 × NEBuffer 2.\nSpin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C to remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 μL of 1 × NEBuffer 2.\nThe total volume of the cell suspension will be variable due to residual supernatant not removed in step 10. For accuracy, transfer 50 μL of the suspension to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nTo permeabilize the cells and remove non-crosslinked DNA-binding proteins for subsequent digestion, add 5.55 μL of 10% SDS for a final concentration of 1%. Incubate the mixture for 15 min at 65°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nImmediately cool down the tube on ice for 90 s.\nNote: A precipitate could form if the tube is left on ice too long.\nSpin down condensate briefly and mix by pipetting.\nAssemble the following reactions in 1.5-mL tubes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_702_18.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_702_19.csv\nIncubate the samples for 4 h at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nAssemble two of the following reactions in 1.5-mL Eppendorf Safe-Lock Tubes to label restriction ends with biotin. The amount of Klenow Large Fragment is critical for optimal labeling efficiency. To avoid pipetting a small amount of the enzyme, we recommend making a pre-mixture of dNTPs, NEBuffer 2, and the enzyme for multiple samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_702_20.csv",

Mix the Samples L by inverting the tubes every 30 min.\nOptional: You can do ligation overnight (>12 h) instead of 4 h.\nCross-link reversal\nTiming: >12 h (overnight)\nReverse the crosslinks as follows for subsequent DNA purification.\nAdd the following reagents to each Sample L.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_702_24.csv\nAdd 5 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K to each of all samples.\nIncubate the samples for 6 h at 65°C and then for > 6 h at 37°C. Agitate the samples at 600 rpm during the incubation. Overheating of the samples could lead to DNA degradation by endogenous nucleases (see troubleshooting problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more detail).\nDNA purification 1\nTiming: 8 h\nThis section describes how to purify DNA and confirm successful DNA digestion and ligation. Also described is how to estimate biotin labeling efficiency by PCR amplification of a ligation junction followed by restriction digestion.\nDispense the two Samples L into a total of four 1.5-mL tubes (∼560 μL/tube).\nAdd 1 volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to each tube and mix by hand. Spin down for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 21°C.\nTransfer aqueous phase in each tube (80 μL for Sample U and Sample D and 510 μL for Sample L) to a new 1.5-mL tube. Be careful not to disturb the interphase.",
    "(For Samples L only) Repeat 28. Take 450 μL of aqueous phase from each tube and combine them for a total of 1,800 μL. Dispense the combined extract into three 1.5-mL tubes.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to each tube.\nFor Samples U and D, add 2 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen to each tube. For Sample L, add 2.7 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen to each tube. Addition of glycogen improves DNA yield and makes the DNA pellet more visible.\nAdd 1 volume of isopropanol and leave the samples for 1 h at −20°C.\nSpin down for 1 h at 21,000 × g (or the maximum speed), 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and rinse the pellet in 500 μL of 70% ethanol.\nSpin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g (or the maximum speed), 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and spin down briefly to remove residual ethanol.\nLeave the tubes open for 10 min at 21°C to air-dry the pellets.\nFor Samples U and D, dissolve the pellet in 20 μL of 1 × NEBuffer 2 containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A. For Sample L, dissolve the three pellets together in 40 μL of 1 × NEBuffer 2 containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A.\nIncubate the samples for 30 min at 37°C.\nPause Point: You can stop the experiment by storing the samples at −20°C.",
    "Run 5 μL of each sample on a 0.7% agarose gel for quality control. Sample U (undigested control) should run as a tight band above 10 kb in size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). You will also see larger DNA stuck in the well. Sample D (digested, but not ligated) should run as a smear that starts from slightly above 10 kb to ∼0.5 kb. Sample L (digested and then ligated) should generate a band above 10 kb as observed for Sample U. It is acceptable to see a small amount of smear in Sample L. See troubleshooting problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for potential problems and solutions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/702-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

The library was constructed using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and analyzed by Agilent 4150 TapeStation System and a D1000 ScreenTape. The peaks for the DNA library and upper and lower markers are indicated.\nPause Point: You can stop the experiment by storing the remainder of Sample L at −20°C.\nEstimate labeling efficiency by restriction digestion of a PCR-amplified ligation junction. Ligation of two biotin-labeled ends, generated by complete fill-in of HindIII sites, forms a NheI site. On the other hand, ligation of unlabeled ends regenerates a HindIII site. Thus, labeling efficiency can be estimated as how much of the PCR product is cleavable by NheI. If the DNA labeling was successful, 30%–60% of the product will be cleaved by NheI alone relative to that cleaved by the double digestion.",
    "Perform PCR in a total volume of 60 μL using Hi-C DNA (Sample L) as a template, a PCR enzyme of your choice, and the appropriate primer set for the species you are working on (Sac_QC_F and Sac_QC_R for S. acidocaldarius or Sis_QC_F and Sis_QC_R for S. islandicus). We routinely amplify 0.6 μL of the template DNA using 0.2 mM each of dNTPs, 0.3 μM each of the primers, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase.

Labeling efficiency can be estimated as the fraction of the PCR product digested by NheI relative to that digested by NheI and HindIII. Note that even the double digestion will not cleave all the PCR product, likely due to inefficient digestion, mutations at the ligation junction, and so on (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If the DNA was labeled efficiently, 30%–60% of the product will be cleaved by NheI alone compared with that cleaved by the double digestion.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/702-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Estimation of biotin labeling efficiency\nHi-C DNA from S. acidocaldarius was used as a template for PCR reaction followed by restriction digestion. The DNA was run on a 2% agarose gel.
