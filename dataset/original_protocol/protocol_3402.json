    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section describes the preparation of tamavidin 2 protein, lipid nanorods and tamavidin 2 2D crystals covering the mica surface, as well as the immobilization of lipid nanorods on the 2D crystals. Tamavidin 2 is an avidin-like biotin-binding protein from Pleurotus cornucopiae, and it consists of 141 amino acid residues. The article by Takakura et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] contains detailed information on the discovery, properties, expression, and purification methods of tamavidin 2. The sequence of tamavidin 2 is available from GenBank (GenBank: AB102785) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3167-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The DNA and protein sequence of tamavidin 2 from GenBank (GenBank: AB102785)\nPrepare the expression vector for production of tamavidin 2 protein\nTiming: 2–4 weeks\nPrepare an appropriate plasmid for protein expressions in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells.\nNote: Expression vector pET-17b (Novagen) with the DNA sequence coding tamavidin 2 in NdeI-XhoI sites (pET-17b-tamavidin 2) in our case was designed and purchased from GenScript.\nExpression and purification of tamavidin 2 protein\nTiming: 4 days\nThis subsection summarizes our modified method of expression and purification of tamavidin 2 protein from the report by Takakura et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Tamavidin 2 is expressed at high levels in soluble fractions in recombinant E. coli and can be purified in a single step using a 2-iminobiotin agarose gel.\nTransform competent E. coli cells (e.g., BL21(DE3)) with the expression vector.\nGrow the E. coli cells harboring the expression vector in LB medium (800 mL) containing an appropriate antibiotic (e.g., 100 μg/mL of ampicillin for pET-17b vector) at 37°C until the absorbance at 600 nm reaches 0.5–0.8.\nAdd 800 μL of 0.5 M IPTG (final concentration: 0.5 mM) to the LB medium. Shake at ∼120 rpm for ∼18 h at 25°C.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4°C (4000 × g for 10 min).",
    "Store the cell pellet at −80°C.\nPrepare Buffer L, Buffer W, Buffer E, and Buffer S. See the ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ section for preparation.\nPurify tamavidin 2 following the protocol by Takakura et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Below is the protocol with the slight modification.\nResuspend the pellet in Buffer L (50 mL) and add 50 μL of 1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (final concentration: 1 mM).\nSonicate the suspension on ice (0.2 s of pulse with an interval of 0.8 s at ∼200 W for 10 min).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 4°C (18,000 × g for 40 min) and collect the supernatant.\nPurify the clear supernatant using 2-iminobiotin agarose (Thermo Fischer Scientific).\nTransfer 2-iminobiotin agarose resin slurry (2 mL) into an empty column (Bio-Rad).\nEquilibrate the column with 4-column volumes of Buffer L.\nApply the supernatant to the column.\nWash the column with 20-column volumes of Buffer W.\nElute tamavidin 2 protein by adding 5-column volumes of Buffer E.\nConcentrate the eluted tamavidin 2 solution and exchange buffer to Buffer S using Amicon Ultra-15 (NMWL 10k).\nCentrifuge the tamavidin 2 solution (12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min) and collect the supernatant.\nNote: The molar extinction coefficient of tamavidin 2 is 41,750 M−1·cm−1·subunit−1 at 280 nm.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Concentrate the tamavidin 2 solution up to 150 μM (absorbance at 280 nm = 6.26).\nNote: Stability of tamavidin 2 is very high and its biotin-binding activity is rarely reduced by storage in solution at 4°C for at least 1 year.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] In our experiment, tamavidin 2 solution purified and stored at 4°C for >3 years is used.\nPrepare lipid nanorods\nTiming: ≥3 h",
    "Lipid nanorods, formed by the spontaneous assembly of galactocerebrosides, have been used for HS-AFM observation of dynamin.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Biotinylated lipids must be included to immobilize lipid nanorods onto tamavidin 2 2D crystals. Below is our slightly modified protocol from the report by Colom et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nPrepare a 100-nmol mixture of phospholipids containing galactosylceramide and biotinyl cap PE (in our case1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]: 40 μL of 1 mM galactosylceramide; 15 μL of 1 mM POPC; 5 μL of 1 mM POPE; 6 μL of 1 mM PI; 6 μL of 1 mM POPS; 6 μL of 1 mM POPA; 12 μL of 1 mM cardiolipin (CL); 10 μL of 1 mM biotinyl cap PE [40:15:5:6:6:6:12:10 mol %] in chloroform (100 μL in total)) in a 5-mL glass bottle.\nDry chloroform under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas to produce lipid film.\nPlace the glass bottle in a vacuum desiccator for ≥2 h to completely evaporate the chloroform.\nNote: You can keep the glass bottle in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h.\nAdd 100 μL of buffer you want to use (e.g., 20 mM of HEPES-NaOH containing 150 mM of NaCl, pH 7.0) to the lipid film and incubate for 10 min followed by vortexing to prepare 1 mM lipid mixture solution.\nTransfer the lipid mixture solution to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSonicate it in a bath sonicator for 10 min (40 W, 42 kHz).\nSonicate it further with a tip sonicator for ≤5 s (50 W, 20 kHz).\nCritical: Longer sonication time produces vesicular structures rather than nanorods. Details are shown in ‘problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]’ of ‘troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ section.\nProtect from light and keep the 1.5-mL tube on ice until use.\nPrepare tamavidin 2 2D crystals on mica\nTiming: 20–30 min",
    "This subsection describes the preparation of tamavidin 2 2D crystals on mica. Tamavidin 2 2D crystals have been a useful substrate that develop directly on the mica surface to immobilize biotinylated proteins or membranes.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] See the protocol by Uchihashi et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for HS-AFM setup and observation. We use a sample scanning HS-AFM instrument (MS-NEX, Research Institute of Biomolecule Metrology Co., Ltd.) and cantilevers (length: ∼7-μm, width: ∼2-μm, thickness: ∼0.08-μm, resonant frequency: 1.2 MHz in air, spring constant: 0.15 N/m) with electron beam deposited/EBD tips (USC-F1.2-k0.15, NanoWorld). HS-AFM images were viewed and analyzed using the software Kodec4.4.7.39.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nPrepare crystal buffer and fixation buffer. See the ‘materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ section for preparation.\nAdd 1 μL of 150 μM of tamavidin 2 (A280 = 6.26) to 20 μL of crystal buffer (final concentration, 7.1 μM) and mix by gentle pipetting.\nCritical: Do not incubate for >60 min after the dilution with crystal buffer. Details are shown in ‘problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]’ of ‘troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ section.\nDeposit a drop (∼2 μL) of the diluted tamavidin 2 solution onto freshly cleaved mica by scotch tape and incubate for 5 min.\nRinse the mica surface with 0.01% glutaraldehyde diluted with fixation buffer and keep the last drop on the mica for 5 min.\nCritical: Glutaraldehyde fixation after incubation of tamavidin 2 on mica is an indispensable step for stabilization of 2D crystals. Rinse with imaging buffer before glutaraldehyde fixation may wash out tamavidin 2 from the surface.\nRinse the mica surface with imaging buffer you want to use for HS-AFM imaging (in our case,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] 20 mM of HEPES-NaOH containing 150 mM of NaCl, pH of 7.0).\nSet up HS-AFM, start imaging and confirm 2D crystals of tamavidin 2 formed on the mica surface.\nNote: Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows an example of the expected results.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3167-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Typical HS-AFM images of tamavidin 2 2D crystals on mica surface prepared by this method\n(A and B) Scan range: 500 nm × 500 nm (250 × 250 pixels) (A) and 100 nm × 100 nm (200 × 200 pixels) (B); Height scale: 0–9 nm (A) and 0–1.5 nm (B). Images were acquired at 1.5 s/frame (A) and 0.6 s/frame (B).\nKeep a drop of imaging buffer on the mica after HS-AFM imaging.\nNote: The tamavidin 2 2D crystals covering the mica can be stored at ∼23°C in a humid container for several days. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows an example of a humid container.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3167-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Photograph of a humid container example for keeping tamavidin 2 2D crystals on mica glued to a glass stage\nA sheet of Kimwipes is fixed with scotch tape and wetted with Milli-Q water in a plastic Petri dish. A drop of buffer solution (e.g., 20 mM HEPES-NaOH containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) (∼2 μL) is kept on mica. The glass stage is loosely fixed to the bottom of the Petri dish with double-sided adhesive tape to prevent it from falling over. The space between the container and the lid is sealed with parafilm.\nImmobilization of lipid nanorods onto tamavidin 2 2D crystals\nTiming: <10 min\nImmobilization of lipid nanorods can be achieved by applying the lipid nanorod solution to the tamavidin 2 2D crystals.\nMix 9 μL of buffer solution (e.g., 20 mM HEPES-NaOH containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) and 1 μL of lipid solution (kept on ice after sonication) to prepare 0.1 mM of lipid solution.\nExchange the buffer solution on tamavidin 2 2D crystals to 0.1 mM of lipid solution.\nKeep a drop of 0.1 mM of lipid solution on mica for 5 min.",
    "Set up HS-AFM and start imaging.\nNote: Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] shows an example of the expected results. Typically 3–10 lipid nanotubes with different length (∼0.1–1 μm) are observed in 1 μm × 1 μm area.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3167-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. HS-AFM images of lipid nanorods immobilized on tamavidin 2 2D crystals\nThe sizes of lipid nanorods are 30–50 nm in diameter and ∼0.1–1 μm in length. Scan range: 1250 nm × 1250 nm (250 × 250 pixels); Height scale: 0–45 nm (left) and 0–48 nm (right). Images were acquired at 1.5 s/frame.\nApply proteins of interest to the lipid nanorods immobilized on tamavidin 2 2D crystals after removing the glass stage from the HS-AFM setup or add proteins of interest to the imaging buffer while HS-AFM imaging.\nNote: You can incubate the proteins with lipid nanorods before applying it to tamavidin 2 2D crystals. The timing of addition of the proteins will depend on the proteins and the events you want to observe. For example, if you attempt to observe dynamin-coated lipid nanotubes, it would be preferable to mix dynamin and nanorods before fixation on tamavidin 2 2D crystals because fixation may interfere with the formation of dynamin assembly around the nanorods.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]"
