    "1. Secondary structure predictions of a single chain fragment variable (scFv) protein\nBuild the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) protein's 3D structure with BLAST protein data bank (PDB), KABAT numbering, and the modeling software. The scFv consists of a linker (Gly4-Ser) that connects a variable heavy chain (VH) and a variable light chain (VL).\nUse the molecular modeling software to build the linker as a loop structure, and perform all these methods as described in previous studies2,19,20.\n2. Template selection and scFv and EGFR 3D structure prediction and homology modeling\nChoose template 1ivo for EGFR structures (based on its high resolution). Download the 1ivo.pdb file from the pdb website, as shown in Figure 1B.\nPrepare the input 1ivo.pdb file as described below.\n\t\nIn the 1ivo.pdb file, remove all external ligands by opening the pdb.org website and selecting the 1ivo. Structure, and looking for the name of the ligands under the small molecule title on the 1ivo structure page of the pdb website.\nFind the ligand name NAG. Open the 1ivo.pdb file downloaded from the pdb website and find the termination residue (TER.).\nDelete the residues of the external ligands in the 1ivo structure, starting from the residue after TER. and before the residue ends. Save the 1ivo.pdb file on the system.\nPrepare the saved 1ivo.pdb file as described below.\n\t\nDownload the Autodock docking software (autodock.scripps.edu) from the window selection area. Click on the Open 1ivo.pdb File.\nUse the Edit command to choose Add Hydrogen > Add, then select Polar Only, and then press Ok.\nUse the Edit command to add Kollman charges (Supplementary Figure 1). Use the Edit command to delete water. Save the 1ivo.pdb file on the pc.\nMinimize the energy of the 1ivo.pdb structure as described below.\n\t\nDownload SPDBV. software from http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/disclaim.html. Open the 1ivo.pdb file.",
    "Select all. Select the command Perf > Energy minimization > Ok (Supplementary Figure 2). Save the 1ivo file on the pc.\nPrepare the full model scFv using homology modeling as described below.\n\t\nDownload the modeling software17 and the Python script 3.7.9 shell from the Window- 64. Keep the downloaded software files in the D drive.\nPrepare the input files as described below.\n\t\nLoad the scFv Pdb file in fasta format from the NCBI website and rename the file TARGET.ali. as described in Supplementary Coding File 1. Choose the template using the Blast section in NCBI, paste the sequenced file, select in pdb format 7det.pdb as described in Supplementary Coding File 2, and then submit. Then, use the pdb.org website to obtain the template file.\nPrepare the third input file as align2d.py (Python) as described in Supplementary Coding File 3, which opens as shown in Supplementary Figure 3A. Press the Show More Option, then go to Edit with IDLE > Edit with EDLE (64-bit). Run using the run module 5 command in the align2d.py to obtain two output files: Tar- 7det.ali and Tar- 7det.pap.\nComplete the previous three steps to use the command in the last input file.\nAdd a new input file model-single.py (command python file) as shown in Supplementary Coding File 4 and as described below.\n\t\nPress the Show More Option, then go to Edit with IDLE > Edit with EDLE3.7 (64-bit). Run using the (run module 5) command as shown in Supplementary Figure 3B.\n\t\t​NOTE: The resulting output files are the six files of the homology models shown in Supplementary Figure 3C.\n3. Receptor secondary structure prediction and evaluation\nDetect the homology models' correction and accuracy as described below.\n\t\nCreate the Ramachandran plot for the scFv models and EGFR models by downloading the visualization tool from  https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studio-visualizer-download.",
    "Open the file, then right-click with the mouse and select the display sequence (Supplementary Figure 4). Copy the sequence and paste it into the Pictorial database of 3D structures (pdbsum) www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/.\nSelect search by sequence, paste the copy of the sequence, and then submit it. Create the plot as shown in Figure 1B,D.\n4. Protein-protein docking\nDownload the virtual screening tool software.\nGo to File> Read Molecules > Load 1ivo.pdb. Right-click on the protein in the autodock panel to make a macromolecule. Right-click again to make a ligand (Supplementary Figure 5).\nClick in the autodock panel to select protein and then select ligand.\nOpen the protein list. Then, from the list, select scFv Protein.\nGo to Toggle Selection Spheres. Adjust the grid box to the center of the receptor. Click Forward when the round pink button appears.\nTo prepare the pdbqt files for both scFv-antibody and EGFR (1ivo) structures, use the following steps.\n\t\nGo to C Drive > Program Files (86) > Users, then choose the pyrx file that contains macromolecules and protein output files that were saved as a pdbqt file.\nThen, save the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody pdbqt file.\nDownload PyMOL software at PyMOL | pymol.org. Use PyMOL software to show the scFv antibody-receptor EGFR configurations.\n\t\nGo to file and open C:\\Users\\ilham\\.mgltools\\PyRx\\Macromolecules\\protein. Prepare the docking configurations of the scFvantibodyinteracting with the receptor in Figure 2A as described below.\n\t\t\nUse the display option to show the (1ivo)-receptor file as sequence residues with a white background shown in Supplementary Figure 6.\nDisplay the docking configuration file with higher resolution to see the ligand color in green and red residue colors. Display the (1ivo)-receptor rigid surface in yellow.\nPrepare the docking configurations of the scFvantibodyinteracting with the receptor in Figure 2B, as described below.",
    "Download the docking software from the window selection area. Use Autodock to show the scFv antibody-receptor EGFR configurations and conformations.\n\t\t\nIn Autodock, choose the Analyze Option, then open the Autodock Vina result. Go to File and open C:\\Users\\ilham\\.mgltools\\PyRx\\Macromolecules\\protein.\nSelect the protein receptor pdb file, then select the area of the ligand configuration (scFv antibody structure). Connect the rigid surface of the receptor with the configuration ofthe docked structure and hide the rest of the receptor. Hide the far residues of the receptor from the connected residues to the ligand, as shown in Figure 2B.\nThe protein-protein complex was then considered ready to perform MD simulation.\n5. Molecular dynamic simulation (MD simulation) of the EGFR-scFv antibody docking complex\nDownload the MD simulation software and use it as follows.\n\t\nPrepare the EGFR (1ivo) pdb file using the reparation wizard as in Supplementary Figure 7A. Operate the preprocess section to refine the file. Send the refined file to be set in the system builder.\nLoad the molecular dynamics simulation software from the working directory. Add the ions and upgrade the refined file to reach 20 Å to submit the job (Table 1), also shown in Supplementary Figure 7B.\nLoad the EGFR (1ivo) pdb from the imported file, then choose 100 ns timesteps to run it (Supplementary Figure 7C).\nStart the analysis of the simulation after the completion of the MDsimulation as described below.\n\t\nCreate a job folder and save it in the cms file . Load the cms file to perform this step in the MD simulation.\nCreate a working directory for project folders and report the energy values. Use S.I.D. pdf to report the simulation, as shown in Figure 3A, and the interaction diagram and H bond, as shown in Figure 3B.",
    "Load the pdf file of cms by browsing from the folder and use TIP3P as the model for file volume minimization.\nCreate the solvation file to perform this step shown in Supplementary Figure 7D. Save pdf file through the software, and analyze the data, resulting in Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6.\nGenerate an MDsimulation finalization setup by creating the resolve file. Find the results in the boundary box, as shown in Figure 7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
