    "1. Remove the colon punch biopsies to isolate lamina propria cells; Wash the entire length of colon thoroughly with incomplete medium \\(RPMI) in a Petri dish to remove fecal waste. Transfer the fragments to another Petri dish containing 10mL of complete medium, incubated in ice.\n  2. CRITICAL STEP For efficient isolation of the cells it is necessary to remove the fat from small fragments of colonic tissue using forceps and surgical scissors. \n  3. Place the samples in a Petri dish and shaken with slow agitation \\(100rpm) for 10 min. Remove the supernatant with a Pasteur pipette and discarded. This process is repeated six times. \n  4. Transfer the fragments of tissue to a small culture bottle containing 10mL incubation solution \\(DTT), and shaker for 30 min \\(120rpm) at 37ºC. The incubation solution can be discarded and the process repeated for a further 30 min.\n  5.  Add 10mL wash solution \\(HBSS/HEPES) and shaker for 10 min \\(120rpm) at 37ºC to wash the DTT from the tissue fragments. \n  6. CRITICAL STEP This process is essential to remove the collagen from the colon tissue. \n  7. After this step, in the bottle containing the tissue fragments, add 10mL collagenase solution and shake gently \\(120rpm) in the shaker for 45 min at 37ºC. \n  8. Remove the collagenase solution supernatant after 45 min, transfer to a Falcon<sup>®</sup> 15mL tube. Centrifuged the supernatant \\(1400rpm) for 10min at 4ºC, resuspend in 0.5µL complete medium and store on ice. All these steps must be repeated four times.\n  9. Place the cells in a single Falcon<sup>®</sup> 15mL tube and add 9mL of distilled water to lyse erythrocytes; ten seconds later add 1mL of PBS to neutralize this action. After centrifuging at 1400rpm for 10 min at 4ºC, the pellet is resuspended in 0.5µL complete medium.",
    "10.   Analyze the number of cells in a 10µL sample using a Neubauer camera and the solution should be calibrated to 1x10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. The cells can be blocked with leishmaniasis negative dog serum and kept for a minimum of 20 minutes on ice.\n  11. Utilize the vital dye Trypan Blue \\(0.4% \\(wt/vol) in HBSS) to verify cell viability. The reactivity of Trypan Blue is based on the fact that it does not interact with cells unless the membrane is damaged. All cells that exclude Trypan Blue are viable. \n  12. Dilute the antibodies for superficial markers with ADS, and the intracellular markers in permeabilization buffer. \n  13. Plate the cell suspensions \\(20µL) on 96-well U-bottom plates \\(Limbro Biomedicals<sup>®</sup> 175, Aurora, OH, USA) at a concentration of 1x10^7 cells/mL with antibodies to cell surface \\(Table 1).\n  14. Refrigerate the plate for 15 min, and after this time 150µL of cold PBS, add to each well and centrifuge \\(1300rpm) at 4ºC for 10min. The supernatant is removed from the wells and 200µL of 2% formaldehyde is added to fix the cells. \n  15. Transfer the contents of the wells to FACS \\(Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) tubes and store in the refrigerator in the dark.  \n  16. Remove the supernatant for intracellular marking \\(Table 2), add 150µL of PBS-W, and centrifuge the samples at 1300rpm at 4ºC for 10 min; remove the supernatant again. Add the permeabilization buffer \\(150µL); slowly mix the samples manually and kept for 10 min at ambient temperature. Centrifuge the plate for a further 10 min \\(1300rpm at 4ºC) and remove the supernatant. \n  17. Add the intracellular antibodies including the isotypes and incubate for 40 min at room temperature. Add permeabilization buffer \\(150µL), centrifuge the samples and remove the supernatant. This process can be repeated once.",
    "18. Resuspend the cells in 150µL PBS-W, centrifuge and remove the supernatant; add 200µL of 2% formaldehyde and transfer the content of the wells to FACS tubes, and store in the refrigerator in the dark. \n  19. Analyze the cells on an analytical flow cytometer equipped with a laser emitting at 488nm \\(FACSVantage<sup>®</sup>, Becton-Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA). Perform acquisitions on 50.000 events \\(whole cells can be distinguished from fragments by gating based on the forward and side scatter signals<sup>12</sup>. Process numerical data using FlowJo software version 7.2.5 \\(Tree Star. Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). \n  20. To assess the lamina propria population cells of the colon the phenotypic aspects of the lamina propria cells can be expressed in two different forms: percentage \\(%) of cells expressing a given phenotypic marker, using cell and isotype control cutoff, with a bimodal distribution, and geometric mean fluorescence intensity \\(MFI). The latter approach is used for semi-quantitative expression of phenotypic markers with a unimodal distribution. Three-color flow cytometry panels optimized for use in dogs were employed to characterize mononuclear cells phenotypically in colon biopsies, on the basis of the mean fluorescence intensity and frequency. The analysis of cells should focus on the composition of the sub-populations. The cells surveyed were: CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, FOXP3<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>, TLR9<sup>+</sup>, TLR2<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup> and mannose<sup>+</sup>. This provides an opportunity to compare the mucosa of dogs with various clinical states of leishmaniasis."
