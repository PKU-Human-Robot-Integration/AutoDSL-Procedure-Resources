    "Gene cloningGFP-mCherry-PEX26TM was constructed in several steps as described in Deosaran et al., 2013. First, the PEX26 ORF from pSPORT-PEX26 (Invitrogen) was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pmEGFP-C1, to insert the entire ORF of PEX26 at the C-terminus of GFP. Next, the entire PEX26 but its C-terminus tail-anchor domain (TM) was removed by PCR using two primers containing a BglII site. Finally, primers containing a BglII or BamHI sites were used to PCR amplified mCherry. Following digestion with BglII and BamHI, the PCR product was inserted into the BglII site on the pmEGFP-PEX26TM vector to generate the GFP-mCherry-PEX26TM (RG-PEX26TM) vector. Refer to Figure 2 for a schematic. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191212/20191212012115_0650.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram of the construction of the RG-PEX26TM construct. Restriction enzymes used are indicated. Small arrows indicate the location of primer used. Cell seeding Here we will describe work done on HeLa cells which were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% CO2. Media was filter sterilized with FBS. However, this protocol can be adapted to most transfectable cell lines. We have tested this protocol in a number of transfectable cells such as MEFs, Cos7, U2OS, Hek293 and MDCKs. To seed cells, first warm sterile media and PBS to 37 °C. Thaw trypsin and warm to room temperature. Remove cells from the incubator and aspirate growth media. Wash with PBS (about 5 ml) and aspirate. Add trypsin to the flask at an appropriate volume to ensure cells will not dry (i.e., 1 ml trypsin in a T25 flask).Incubate cells in trypsin at 37 °C for 3-5 min.Once cells are no longer adhered to the flask, add media to dilute and inactivate the trypsin (about 5 ml).",
    "Collect media containing cells in a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min to pellet cells.Following centrifugation, aspirate media and resuspend the cells in fresh media.Count the cells using a hemocytometer or other cell counting device.Seed cells in a 4-well Lab-Tek chamber (or equivalent coverslip system that allows for live cell imaging) at a density of 25,000 cells/well. Total volume within the well should be 0.5 ml. For other cell types or longer procedures, seed cells at an appropriate density for transfection.Allow cells to adhere and rest for 24 h before transfection in the 37 °C incubator. Cell transfectionOn Day 2, transfect with the RG-PEX26TM construct (and any other construct required for the experiment). Use 1-2 μg of DNA per well and Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, combine 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine2000 with 50 μl of Opti-mem medium in a 1.5 ml tube. Allow it to sit for 5 min. In another 1.5 ml tube, combine 50 μl of Opti-mem medium and DNA. Combine the lipofectamine and DNA containing mixtures and let sit for 20 min. Do this for each transfected well. Add complete mixture (100 μl) to each well.Let cells grow for 24-36 h.Change media to DMEM + FBS or HBSS without FBS. HBSS induces mTORC1 related pexophagy due to amino acid starvation. Both are supplemented with 2 μM E-64 and 0.5 mM leupeptin to prevent degradation of protein inside lysosomes and allow detection of mCherry signal. Incubate at 37 °C for 4-24 h. Incubation at 37 °C is accomplished through the use of a CO2 dependent incubator. Image acquisitionFor imaging, the cells should be imaged under the appropriate conditions (i.e., 37 °C and 5% CO2).",
    "If using a microscope system without CO2, the media should be replaced with appropriate CO2 independent media supplemented with 0.5 mM leupeptin and 2 μM E-64.Ensure microscope is powered on and warmed up to 37 °C before starting.For each set of experiments, calibrate settings such that the mean GFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities (IG/R) are approximately equal (i.e., IGFP/ImCherry = 1). Calibration will depend on the microscope used, however in short, the laser, gain and speed should be set to have the background close to zero intensity while most of the signal for the fluorophores are not saturated. The ratio of the mean intensity for RFP over GFP for each cell should be close to 1 for the control cells. Ensuring that GFP and mCherry signals are approximately equal allows for optimal detection of changes in the fluorescence intensity ratio upon pexophagy induction. For each trial, all conditions should be imaged on the same day. Either 3D z-sectioning or a single slice can be used for quantification but ensure to keep the imaging method consistent throughout trials. Refer to Figure 3 for sample images. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191212/20191212013014_7465.jpgFigure 3. HeLa cells transfected with RG construct. Control cells have been incubated in DMEM supplemented with E-64 and leupeptin as above. Starved cells were grown in HBSS for 12 h before imaging, also supplemented with E-64 and Leupeptin. Both cells are expressing GFP-mCherry-PEX26TM. Control cell (Top) shows almost equal GFP and mCherry pixel intensities. Cells where pexophagy has been induced by amino acid starvation (Bottom) show increased 'red-only' signal indicating peroxisomes have been targeted to lysosomes. Note, an increase in ‘red-only’ signal is more easily observable as a decrease in green fluorescent intensity. Red fluorescent intensity should not change. Scale bar = 10 μm"
