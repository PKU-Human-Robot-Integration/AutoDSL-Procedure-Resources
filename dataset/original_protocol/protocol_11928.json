    "1. Media and imaging dishes preparation\nMS plates: Add 0.5x Murashige & Skoog MS medium, 1% agar into deionized water and then adjust pH to 5.8 using potassium hydroxide solution (Optional: Add 1% sucrose for the long-term plant growing). Autoclave and pour plates.\nImaging dishes: Fill plastic Petri dishes (6 cm wide, 1.5 cm depth) to 0.5-0.8 cm with 1.5% molten agarose.\n2. Plant growth\nArabidopsis growth\n\t\nSow sterilized seeds on MS plates and place plates under 4 °C for two days. Then, move MS plates to a short day (8 h light/ 16 h dark), at 22 °C for two weeks.\nTransplant seedlings to soil and grow them in a short day (8 h light/ 16 h dark) at 22 °C for four weeks.\nTransfer plants to continuous light, at 22 °C to induce the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage and for imaging the inflorescence SAMs.\nTomato and soybean growth\n\t\nIncubate the seeds covered with wet filter paper under 28 °C till they germinate.\nTransplant seedlings to soil and grow them in a long day (16 h light/ 8 h dark) at 25 °C for one week or longer for imaging the vegetative SAMs.\n3. Dissection of the shoot apex\nDissection of the inflorescence shoot apex\n\t\nCut the inflorescence shoot apex together with 1-2 cm main stem from the bolted Arabidopsis plants with a razor blade. Hold the basal part of the main stem and remove as many older flower organs as possible from the main stem by dissecting out the peduncles with jewelry forceps.\n\t\tCAUTION: Avoid cutting fingers when using a razor blade. Dispose of the used razor blades to a proper sharps’ container.",
    "Hold the attached stem of the shoot apex with jewelry forceps or fingers in the field of the stereomicroscope, continue removing the rest of flowers till nearly the whole SAM can be viewed from the eyepieces. Remove peduncles clearly at the junction of the main stem.\nDissection of the vegetative shoot apex\n\t\nTo view the vegetative SAMs from either tomato or soybean, dissect out the cotyledons, leaves, and roots from the plants.\nHold the hypocotyls of the plants under the stereomicroscope and further dissect out the leaf primordia covering the vegetative SAMs using jewelry forceps.\n4. Staining\nTo directly visualize cells in SAMs, use freshly prepared propidium iodide (PI) solution to stain cell walls. Dissolve PI powder in sterile, deionized water, make 1mL PI staining solution at the concentration of 1 mg/mL and store the PI solution in microcentrifuge tube covered with aluminum foil.\nPipette 50 µL PI solution in a clean and empty Petri dish and dip the whole dissected shoot apex into dye for 2 min. Rinse the stained shoot apex twice in sterile, deionized water. During the staining process, immerse the whole inflorescence SAM or vegetative SAM into the PI solution to achieve the uniform staining.\n5. Image collection\nNOTE: For this method, all the SAMs are imaged using an upright confocal microscope and with a 20x water-dipping lens. As described in other protocols9,12,13,15, it is also feasible to image SAMs using an inverted microscope. In addition, the live imaging can be achieved using different brands of confocal microscopes, with the same sample preparation steps. In this study, the imaging steps are described in detail as an example.\nPierce a hole at the center of an imaging dish using forceps and stick the stained shoot apex upright in the medium.",
    "Fill the imaging dish with sterile, deionized water to completely immerse the sample. Viewing from the stereo microscope, pipette up and down to remove air bubbles trapped around the meristem. Then, adjust the angle of the stem in the agar to make sure that the SAM is fully visible from directly above.\nPlace the imaging dish on the sample stage of the confocal microscope. Lower water-dipping lens and raise the microscope sample stage to let the tip of lens dip into the water.\nOpen the confocal microscope software and locate the SAM in the brightfield in the eyepieces. Move the SAM sample right below the objective lens through adjusting the XY controller, then focus on the SAM from eyepieces through cautiously adjusting the Z controller.\nOperate the acquisition function in the confocal microscope software (see Table of Materials), start the Live mode to view the sample from the computer screen, and set up all parameters for the laser scanning experiment.\n\t\nWhen adjusting the parameters, use Range Indicator function to define whether the signal is saturated or not.\nOptionally, apply the Reuse function to reload all the parameter settings from the selected confocal file.\n\t\tNOTE: Suggested imaging parameters: Laser line (excitation): 515 nm or 561 nm; Emission 570-650 nm; pinhole: 1 airy unit (AU); Gain: 600-750, scan mode: Frame; Frame size: either 512 X 512 or 1024 X 1024; scanning speed: from 7 to Max; Scanning direction: bi-direction; Averaging number: 2-4; Averaging method: mean; Bit depth: 16 Bit; Scanning Interval: 0.5-1 µM. Further, optimize all these parameters based on the nature of different plant samples and the specific imaging needs.\n6. Image processing",
    "For visualizing optical orthogonal and transverse section views, use the same commercial software for the imaging acquisition. Open the original confocal file, click ortho menu, select ortho. Then select either x position, y position and z position of the image, and save the images as the tiff files.\n\t\nOptionally select 3D distance function to define the physical distance between two points that have been selected from the stack of the confocal images.\nAlternatively, use Fiji/Image J, the open resource image processing package to visualize the orthogonal and transverse section views.\nOpen the original confocal file with Fiji, click image menu, select Stacks and then select Orthogonal views.\nSelect XY, YZ, and XZ planes in the middle position and save as Tiff format images.\nFor visualizing a 3D transparent projection, use the same software.\n\t\nOpen the original confocal file, click 3D menu, and select Transparent to generate a 3D projection view.\nOptionally click 3D menu, select Appearance, and then select Transparency to adjust three parameters of the projection including Threshold, Ramp and Maximum for the transparency of the 3D image.\nClick 3D menu, select Appearance, and select Light to adjust the brightness of the 3D image.\nExport the projected images and save them as the Tiff files.\nFor visualizing a 3D maximum intensity projection, open the confocal files with the same software, and click the 3D menu.\n\t\nSelect 3D menu and select Maximum.\nAlternatively, use Fiji/Image J to visualize a 3D maximum intensity projection.\nOpen the original confocal file with Fiji, click Image menu and select stacks.\nSelect 3D project and save as Tiff format images.\nFor visualizing the depth coding view of the 3D images, use the same software.\n\t\nClick 3D menu and select Appearance.\nSelect Special and select Depth Coding.",
    "Alternatively, use Fiji/Image J to visualize the depth coding view.\nOpen the confocal files, click image menu, select Hyperstack.\nSelect Temporal-Color code and save as Tiff format images.\n\t\tNOTE: The depth coding z-stack also can be achieved through the plugin Z Code Stack for Fiji.\nFor visualizing the 3D rotation view as shown (Movie 1 and Movie 2), use the same software (See the Table of Materials).\n\t\nOpen the confocal files, click 3D menu, and select Series.\nSelect Render series, and select one of the four options including Turn around x, Turn around y, Start and end, and Position list.\nSave the render series as the AVI files.\nAlternatively, use Fiji/Image J to visualize the 3D rotation view.\nOpen the original confocal file with Fiji, click Image menu, and select Stacks.\nSelect 3D project and save as AVI format videos.\nSubscription Required.
