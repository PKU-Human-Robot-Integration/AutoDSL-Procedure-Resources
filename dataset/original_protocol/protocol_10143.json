    "All experimental procedures were carried out at the University of California, Irvine.\n1. Buffers and Solutions\nPrepare Lysogeny Broth (LB) in a 1 L glass bottle by adding 25 g of LB-Miller mix in 1 L of double-distilled water (ddH2O). For Petri dishes, add an additional 20 g of agar. Autoclave to sterilize. Pour 25 mL of molten agar medium into 10 cm-diameter Petri dishes and allow to solidify at room temperature. Store liquid media at room temperature and agar plates at 4 °C.\nPrepare Glucose Yeast Peptone (GYP) plates in a 1 L glass bottle by mixing 1 g of D-glucose, 2 g of peptone, 0.25 g of yeast extract, 4.2 g of KH2PO4, 5.1 g of Na2HPO47H2O, and 25 g of agar in 1 L of ddH2O. Autoclave to sterilize. Pour 25 mL of molten agar into 10 cm-diameter Petri dishes and allow to solidify at room temperature. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare Peptone S (PS) medium in a 1 L glass bottle by mixing 10 g of peptone, 7 g of yeast extract, 15 g of D-glucose, 0.12 g of Na2HPO47H2O, 1.4 g of KH2PO4, 40 µg of vitamin B12, and 80 µg of Folic acid in 800 mL of ddH2O. Calibrate an electronic pH meter using pH 4 and pH 7 standards if the pH meter has not been used within a day.\n\t\nMeasure the pH of the PS medium using the pH meter. Add either 5 M KOH or 5 M H3PO4 to adjust the pH to 6.5. Adjust the final volume to 1 L using ddH2O. Filter sterilize using 0.22 µm vacuum filter and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceed cautiously with the pH adjustments by wearing protective equipment including gloves, protective clothing, eye protection, and face protection.",
    "Prepare 10x Development Buffer Prime (DB') buffer in a 1 L glass bottle by adding 3.4 g of KH2PO4, 13.4 g of Na2HPO4 7H2O, and ddH2O to a total volume of 800 mL. Calibrate an electronic pH meter using pH 4 and pH 7 standards if the pH meter has not been used within a day.\n\t\nMeasure the pH of the buffer using the electronic pH meter. Adjust the pH to 6.5 by gently adding either 5 M KOH or 5 M H3PO4 as needed. Adjust the final volume to 1 L using ddH2O and sterilize by autoclaving. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceed cautiously with the pH adjustments by wearing protective equipment including gloves, protective clothing, eye protection, and face protection.\nMake 1x Development buffer (DB) by mixing 100 mL of 10x DB' buffer with 1 mL of sterilized 2 M MgCl2, and 1 mL of sterilized 1 M CaCl2. Adjust the final volume to 1 L in a 1 L glass bottle using an autoclaved sterilized ddH2O. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare PS:DB medium in a 1 L glass bottle by mixing 100 mL of sterilized PS medium, 100 mL of sterilized 10x DB' buffer, and sterilized ddH2O to a total volume of 1 L. Supplement with 1 mL of sterilized 2 M MgCl2 and 1 mL of sterilized 1 M CaCl2. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare the calcein-AM stock solution by adding 50 µL of DMSO to 50 µg of calcein-AM in the plastic container supplied by the manufacturer. Store at -20 °C.\n2. Growth and Maintenance of Amoebae",
    "Grow E. coli strain B/r17 as a food source for amoebae during the initial growth period. Streak E. coli B/r from a frozen stock stored at -80 °C onto an LB agar plate and incubate at 37 °C overnight to obtain single colonies.\nInoculate a single colony of E. coli B/r into 2 mL of LB medium and incubate in a roller drum or a shaker at 37 °C overnight.\nBring the overnight E. coli culture to the room temperature. Using a wooden stick, inoculate amoebae from a frozen stock kept at -80 °C into 750 µL of the overnight culture.\n\tNOTE: Use D. discoideum strain AX3, which is capable of axenic growth18. This step does not require axenic growth, but subsequent steps will have his requirement.\nImmediately add 700 µL of the amoebae-E. coli mixture onto a Glucose Yeast Peptone (GYP) plate. Spread the culture evenly on the surface of the plate by tilting it back-and-forth and side-to-side as needed. Avoid the use of a spreader.\nPlace the GYP plate with agar facing up in a box that maintains high humidity. Use two disposable plastic containers (183 cm x 183 cm x 91 cm) stacked on the top of each other. Fill the bottom container with approximately 25 mL of water and place the top container with several 0.5 cm-diameter holes drilled through the flooring of the container to allow moisture to move from the water reservoir to the top container.\nIncubate the GYP plate and box at 22 °C for 4 - 5 days until amoeba spores are observed growing near the surface of the plate (Figure 2). Use a refrigerated incubator to incubate plates rather than incubation at room temperature.",
    "​NOTE: After spores have grown, they remain viable on plates for several weeks when stored at 4 °C. Store the plates with agar side facing up. After 3 - 4 days of incubation, zones of clearing within the bacterial lawn can be observed, which indicate the onset of amoeba sporulation.\n\t\nObserve small amoebae spores above the plate surface after 4 - 5 days of incubation (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not grow the amoebae for longer than a week, as the quality of the spores decreases beyond this time period.\nCollect amoebae spores to prepare for the axenic growth of the amoebae by sweeping a sterile 1 mL pipette tip parallel to the surface of the plate. Collect spores from half of a 10 cm Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the tip to the surface of the agar plate as this motion will collect large numbers of E. coli.\nResuspend the amoebae on the tip of the pipette by immersing the tip into 1 mL of PS medium and gently pipetting up and down.\nTransfer the inoculated mixture into a 250-mL flask containing 25 mL of the PS medium supplemented with the antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 0.25x concentration.\n\tNOTE: Store the antibiotic-antimycotic solution as 250 µL aliquots at -20 °C. Avoid repeated cycles of thawing and freezing of this solution as this may decrease its efficacy.\nGrow amoebae axenically at 22 °C in a rotating shaker at 100 rpm. For the virulence assay in step 5, grow cells to an optical density measured at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2 to 0.5.",
    "NOTE: This step requires 3 - 4 days of growth from the time of inoculation (step 2.7). If cells have grown to a higher density, dilute the culture back in PS medium to an OD600 of 0.05 or lower and grow back to an OD600 of 0.2 to 0.5.\n3. The Growth of P. aeruginosa\nPick a single colony of P. aeruginosa from an LB plate, inoculate it into a 2 mL PS:DB culture, and grow overnight at 37 °C to saturation.\n\tNOTE: Do not add the antibiotic-antimycotic solution to the PS:DB media.\nDilute the overnight culture 1:100 or 1:1,000 into a 6 cm-diameter Petri dish using PS:DB. If the virulence of planktonic cells is solely being assayed, grow the cultures using conventional culture tubes instead. Shake the culture on a benchtop rotator set at 100 rpm at 37 °C.\nHarvest cultures at specific time points to ensure reproducibility. At 30 min to 1 h prior to assessing virulence, prepare an agar pad as described in section 4.\n\tNOTE: Virulence in P. aeruginosa is induced by approximately 8 h of growth on surfaces.\nTo isolate the surface-attached cells, remove the liquid medium from the Petri dish, wash immediately with 1 mL of DB buffer to remove planktonic cells, and proceed immediately to step 5.1.\n\tCAUTION: Do not wash longer than 30 s as this will perturb and detach surface-attached cells and may affect the virulence measurement.\nTo isolate planktonic cells, transfer 10 µL of the culture from the Petri dish to a clean Petri dish and proceed immediately to step 5.1.\n4. Microscopy - Preparation of the Agar Pad\nPrepare agar pads about 30 min to 1 h before amoebae are ready to be mixed with P. aeruginosa.",
    "Microwave 50 mL of 1% (w/v) agar in DB buffer in a 250 mL flask. Mix every 20 s until clumps of agar disappear.\nCool the molten agar by placing it in preheated 55 °C water bath for 15 min.\nAdd 15 µL of the calcein-AM stock solution to 15 mL of the molten agar in a conical tube. Mix by gently inverting the tube 4 - 5 times and proceed immediately to the next step.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step in a polypropylene 15 mL centrifuge tube. Do not use a thick glass container as this will cause the agar to solidify too quickly.\nPour the molten agar mixture on top of a 12 cm x 10 cm glass plate and allow the agar to solidify for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cut the solidified agar pad into smaller 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm sections by placing the glass plate over a printed grid and cutting along the grid using a metal ruler.\nKeep the gel hydrated in a humid box until it is ready for use.\n5. Microscopy - Preparation of the Bacteria-amoeba Sample for Imaging\nTo assay the virulence of surface-attached bacterial cells, add 10 µL of amoeba cells from step 2.10 to surface-attached bacteria from step 3.4.\n\tNOTE: This step describes the mixing of amoebae with bacteria.\nTo assay the virulence of planktonic cells, mix 10 µL of amoeba cells from step 2.10 with 10 µL of planktonic bacteria from step 3.5.\n\tNOTE: Do not wash the axenically-grown amoeba cells (at an OD600 of 0.2 to 0.5) before mixing with the bacteria. No E. coli growth will be observed in the amoeba culture due to the use of the antibiotic-antimycotic solution.",
    "Immediately place the 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm calcein-AM agar pad from step 4.5 on top of the bacteria-amoeba mixture on the Petri dish surface.\n\tNOTE: Place the agar pad on top of the mixture using a quick smooth motion. Do not lower the pad slowly onto the mixture as this motion tends to push cells towards the periphery and away from the underside of the pad. This step will ensure that bacteria and amoebae are evenly mixed, immobilized and that both cell types are confined to the same plane.\nRemove excess liquid by gently pipetting out any remaining liquid surrounding the agar pad. Allow the Petri dish to dry for 20 min at room temperature.\nCover with the Petri dish with a lid and incubate the immobilized amoeba-bacteria mixture at room temperature for an additional 40 min. Proceed to step 6.1.\n\tNOTE: It is important to incubate all samples for the same amount of time, as the background fluorescence increases over time. An incubation time of 1 h is recommended. Incubations for longer than 1 h are less reproducible as amoebae cells may begin to burst.\n6. Microscopy - Image Acquisition\nImage amoebae using a fluorescence microscope capable of acquiring brightfield and green fluorescence images. For green fluorescence, use green fluorescence protein (GFP) filters with 474/27 nm and 525/45 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Use a 10X (≥0.3 numerical aperture) objective to image the amoebae.\n\tNOTE: The calcein-AM in the agar will cause dying amoebae to fluorescence in the green fluorescence channel. Healthy amoebae are otherwise not fluorescent.\nAdjust acquisition times for the phase contrast, GFP channels to limit phototoxicity, and optimize the dynamic range of the image intensities. Substitute the differential interference contrast (DIC) phase contrast if necessary.",
    "NOTE: Use 100 - 200 ms exposures for phase contrast and GFP fluorescence if possible. Keep the exposure and instrument settings unchanged throughout the entire experiment. This is critical for computing the host killing index.\nAcquire images for at least 100 amoeba cells in order to obtain good statistics for calculating the host killing index.\n7. Image Analysis and Host Killing Index\nPerform image analysis using ImageJ.\nOpen the phase contrast image file in ImageJ by clicking on File | Open and selecting the image. Adjust the threshold by clicking on Image | Analysis | Threshold. Adjust the lower and upper threshold to select only the intensity peak (Figure 3A).\nConvert the image to binary by clicking Process | Binary | Make Binary. Fill holes by selecting Process | Binary | Fill Holes.\n\tNOTE: Using the image in Figure 1 as the source, steps 7.1 - 7.2 will produce an image in which the amoebae and surface-attached bacteria appear as dark regions (Figure 3B).\nEnsure that the Area and Mean gray value boxes are checked in Analyze | Set Measurements. Measure the approximate size of the amoebae by selecting the oval tool on the main toolbar. Click Analyze | Measure and note the area of representative amoebae.\nCreate masks for the amoebae by clicking Analyze | Analyze Particles. In the size box, enter the area that will include the amoebae but exclude the bacteria. Select Masks in the dropdown menu bar for the Show option. Ensure that the Add to Manager box is checked.\nClick OK and an image showing only the amoebae and an ROI Manager dialog will appear (Figure 3C).",
    "Open the fluorescence image using File | Open and selecting the appropriate file. Select all the regions in the ROI Manager by holding down the Shift Key and Clicking on each region in the list (Figure 3D).\nClick the Measure button in the ROI Manager. This will open a Results window displaying the mean intensity value of each amoeba.\nCopy the fluorescence values for each amoeba into a spreadsheet program and calculate the host killing index by taking the average of all fluorescence values.\nSubscription Required.
