    "The research protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants completed a written consent form.\n1. Participant classification and screening\nEnroll RP subjects and HCs closely matched in age, gender, and education.\nEnsure that all participants meet the following criteria: 1) able to be scanned with an MRI scanner (e.g., no cardiac pacemakers or implanted metal devices); 2) no claustrophobia; 3) no heart disease, hypertension, or cerebral diseases.\n2. Acquisition of fMRI data\nNOTE: A 3 T MRI scanner with eight-channel head coil is used in this protocol.\nAsk each participant to remove metal objects before entering the MRI scanner room after a final safety check.\nInstruct the participant to lie down on the bed and ensure that the orbitomeatal line is perpendicular to the bed. Then place foam pads in the bilateral temporal region of the head to prevent head movement and provide earplugs to reduce the noise of the scanner.\nInstruct the participant to lie at rest, to keep his/her eyes closed without falling asleep, and not think of anything in particular during scanning.\nAdjust the participant’s head position through the positioning light. Make sure that the axis positioning cursor is parallel to the lateral canthus and the sagittal positioning cursor coincides with the midline of the face. Next, move the bed to make the axis positioning cursor stay 2 cm above or below the participant’s eyebrows.\nNotify the participant of the start of the scanning session. Using the scanning console, start the structural localizer scanning to determine the position of the participants’ head in the scanner and allow planning for subsequent structural and functional scans.\nPerform fMRI with the following sequences and parameters.",
    "Perform three-dimensional brain volume imaging (3D-BRAVO) MRI with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 8.5 ms/3.3 ms; thickness = 1.0 mm; no intersection gap; acquisition matrix = 256 x 256; field of view = 240 x 240 mm2; and flip angle = 12°.\nObtain functional images using gradient echo-planar imaging blood oxygenation level-dependent (EPI-BOLD) imaging with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2,000 ms/25 ms; thickness = 3.0 mm; gap = 1.2 mm; acquisition matrix = 256 x 256; field of view = 240 x 240 mm2; voxel size = 3.6 x 3.6 x 3.6 mm3; and 35 axial slices.\nKeep an eye on the condition of the participant during the duration of the scan, instruct them to move as little as possible, and stop scanning if the participant has any discomfort.\nRemove the participant from the scanner and ask the participant to sit up carefully at the end of the experiment.\n3. Data preprocessing and software preparation\nNOTE: The functional images analyzed in this protocol are preprocessed by SPM8 and the toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI, http://rfmri.org/dpabi)9 based on MATLAB 2013a. Perform the following preprocessing steps separately for each fMRI session.\nOpen the DPABI software in the MATLAB terminal by clicking dpabi, then choose DPARSF 4.3 Advanced Edition and import the folder \"FunRaw\" (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The FunRaw folder contains the DICOM file for each participant.\nClick FunRaw to import the fMRI scan files into DPABI with a consistent numbering scheme (e.g., \"sub0001\", \"sub0002\", etc.). Select the working directory and the initial EPI and T1 directories and continue to select all desired parameters in steps 3.3–3.9 before clicking Run in section 4.",
    "Type the parameters: Timing points = 240 and TR = 2 (Figure 2). Select the EPI DICOM to NIFTI to convert the functional images from DICOM to NIFTI format and remove the first 10 volumes of each function images.\nCheck the boxes for Slice Timing and Realign in the DPABI software to correct the remaining 230 volumes of functional blood oxygenation level-dependent images for slice timing effects and head motion corrected.\n\tNOTE: For head motion, the data of participants with head movement >2 mm or rotation >2° during scanning should be excluded. For slice order, the sequence of numbers in the vector is the acquisition time order of these layers. The selected slice number is 40, slice order is [1:2:39,2:2,40], and the reference slice is 39.\nSelect Normalize by DARTEL with the DPABI software.\n\tNOTE: By selecting this option, the software will automatically perform spatial normalization using individual T1-weighted structural images registered to the mean fMRI data. The resulting aligned T1-weighted images are segmented using the DARTEL toolbox for improved spatial precision during normalization of fMRI data. Normalized data (in Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] 152 space) are resliced at a resolution of 3 x 3 x 3 mm3.\nRemove the linear trend by selecting Detrend in the DPABI software.\nCheck the box for Nuisance Covariates Regression and select the following parameters: head motion model, white matter signal, global mean signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal.\nCheck the box for Scrubbing to remove the bad time points due to head motion in the DPABI software.\nRetain signals between 0.01–0.08 Hz by checking the box Filter [0.01-0.08] in the DPABI software to remove high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency drift.\n\tNOTE: After the data preparation, ReHo and FC analysis can be performed.\n4. ReHo and FC analysis",
    "For the ReHo computation, open the DAPABI software through MATLAB and select 27 voxels in the cluster. Left click ReHo and smooth [6*6*6], then select Run.\n\tNOTE: A Kendall's coefficient of concordance is assigned to a given voxel by calculating the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance of time series of 27 voxels and their nearest neighbors. To reduce the influence of individual variations on statistical comparisons between groups, ReHo maps of each voxel are z-transformed using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. The remaining z ReHo maps are spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 6*6*6 full width at half maximum.\nFor the FC computation, open the DAPABI software through MATLAB and define the altered ReHo brain regions between both groups as regions of interest (ROIs). Click on Functional Connectivity and define the ROI (centering at x = 0, y = -69, and z = -3 with radius = 10 mm), then select Run.\n\tNOTE: Correlation analysis of the time course for each participant is performed between the spherical seed region and whole brain voxels. All FC maps are z-transformed by Fisher’s r-to-z transformation to reduce the influence of individual variations on statistical comparison between groups. The radius of the ROIs around the coordinates should be 10 mm (X = 0, Y = -69, Z = -3).\n5. Statistical analysis\nFind the folders named ReHo and FC after processing the relevant file data. Sort the files of zReHo.nii and zFC.nii, classifying them into four subfolders: \"RP-group-ReHo\", \"HC-group-ReHo\", \"RP-group-FC\", and \"HC-group-FC\".\nOpen DPABI through MATLAB to perform a one sample t-test.\n\t\nLeft click Statistical Analysis, then click one-Sample t-test. Name the output result \"one-sample-t-test-RP\" and set the output directory.\nLeft click Add Group Images and open the \"RP-group-ReHo\" subfolder.\nIn the Mask File option, left click to open the \"BrainMask-05-61*73*61\" subfile in the \"mask\" folder.",
    "Select Compute to run the program. Perform this same procedure for the \"one-sample-t-test-HC\" group.\n\t\tNOTE: The one-sample t-test is used to analyze and display mean ReHo maps of each group in DPABI software.\nOpen DPABI through MATLAB to perform a two sample t-test.\n\t\nLeft click Statistical Analysis, then select two-sample t-test. Name the output result \"two-sample-t-test-ReHo\" and set the output directory.\nLeft click Add Group Images and open the \"RP-group-ReHo\" and \"HC-group-ReHo\" subfolders.\nIn the Mask File option, left click to open the \"BrainMask-05-61*73*61\" subfile in the \"mask\" folder.\nSelect Compute to run the program. Perform this same procedure for the \"two-sample-t-test-FC\". Click Statistical Analysis and Gaussian random field (GRF) correction [two-tailed, voxel-level (0.01) and voxel-level (0.05)] and then click Run.\n\t\tNOTE: The differences between groups of zReHo maps and zFC maps are compared by two sample t-tests. GRF is used to correct for multiple comparisons and regressed covariates of age and sex with DPABI software.\nUse BrainNet Viewer software (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/) to show the results.\n\t\nOpen BrainNet through MATLAB and click on Load file. For surface files, click Browse and select BrainMesh-ICBM152-smoothed.nv, then click Ok; for volume files, select spm-T.nii (this includes ReHo and FC results), then click Ok.\nUse statistical software to process the data obtained from the previous step.\n\tNOTE: The chi-squared test is used for sex comparisons, while independent-samples t-tests are used for other clinical variables. Continuous variables are represented by means and standard deviations.\nConduct Pearson correlation coefficient analysis to identify the relationships between zReHo values and zFC values of different brain regions and visual measurements data by using statistical software.\n\t\nObtain ROI signals of zReHo values and zFC values in each participant by DPABI software. Click ROI signals extractor and Add directory with ROI mask.nii file.",
