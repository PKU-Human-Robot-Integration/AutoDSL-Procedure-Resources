    "1. Expression and Isolation of Target Proteins with a Baculovirus-mediated Insect Cell Expression System\nDirectionally clone blunt-ended PCR products of target proteins from house flies.\n\t\nDesign PCR primers of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the house fly MdαE7 gene based on their sequences and the special requirements of the chosen vector (Table 1).\nUse a thermostable, proofreading DNA polymerase and primers from step 1.1.1 to perform a 150 µL PCR reaction (30 µL of reaction buffer, 3 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1.5 µL of DNA polymerase, 6 µL of house fly template DNA, 7.5 µL of forward primer, 7.5 µL of reverse primer, with water to a final volume 150 µL). Heat the PCR reaction to 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min).\n\t\t\nRun a 1% agarose gel with 150 µL of PCR product.\nExcise the target DNA fragments from the agarose gel with a sharp, clean scalpel: 1317 bp for MdαE7 and 858 bp for GFP. Purify the DNA using commercially available gel extraction kit following manufacturer’s protocol (Table of Materials). Dissolve the purified DNA in 15 µL of distilled water.\nRun a 1% agarose gel with 1 µL of purified DNA to check integrity. Use another 1 µL of purified DNA to measure concentrations with the spectrophotometer.\nConstruct an entry plasmid for target proteins",
    "Set up the cloning reaction. Mix freshly purified DNA products from step 1.1.3 and commercially available entry vectors containing attL-sites (Table of Materials) at a molar ratio of 1:1 (0.5-2 µL of fresh PCR product at 70-200 ng/µL concentrations: 0.5 µL vector). Then add 1 µL of commercially available salt solution (1.2 M NaCl2 and 0.06 M MgCl2) and add water to a final volume of 6 µL. Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nTransfer 4 µL of cloning reaction products in step 1.2.1 into 50 µL of chemically competent E. coli cells. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the cells for 30 s in a 42 °C water bath without shaking.\nPut the tube back in ice for another 2 min. Add 250 µL of room temperature S.O.C. medium (2% tryptone; 0.5% yeast extract; 10 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 10 mM MgSO4; 20 mM glucose). Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with gently shaking.\nSpread 50-200 µL of the bacterial culture in step 1.2.3 on the selective LB plates (1 g of tryptone; 1 g of NaCl; 0.5 g of yeast extract; 1.5 g of agar dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. Autoclave and add 0.1% of 50 mg/mL kanamycin). Incubate LB plates for 16 h at 37 °C for the colony growth.\nPick 5-10 colonies and re-suspend them individually into 5 µL of distilled water.",
    "Perform PCR by adding 5 µL of reaction buffer, 0.5 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.25 µL of DNA polymerase, 1 µL of suspended colonies, 1.25 µL of 10 µM M13 forward primer, 1.25 µL of 10 µM reverse primer of the target gene, and water to final volume of 25 µL. Heat the PCR reaction to 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98° C for 10 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min (Table 1).\nRe-culture 3 µL of suspended colonies from step 1.2.5 in TB media (100 mL of phosphate buffer containing 0.17 M KH2PO4 and 0.72 M K2HPO4 with 450 mL of base broth medium containing 6 g of tryptone, 12 g of yeast and 2 mL of glycerol, sterilized, containing 0.1% 50 mg/mL kanamycin) for 16 h. Extract ultra-pure plasmid DNA following manufacturer’s protocol.\nUse 200 ng/µL ultra-pure plasmid from step 1.2.7 for commercial Sanger sequencing with M13 forward and reverse primers. Verify the correct insertion of the target gene in vector based on the sequence map provided by manufacturer.\nStore the sequence-verified ultra-pure plasmid DNA samples of MdαE7 and GFP in -20 °C.\n\t\tNote: These are the entry plasmid DNA of MdαE7 and GFP.\nConstruct a recombinant baculovirus by performing Lambda recombination (LR) reaction.\n\t\nRespectively, mix 1 µL of 300 ng/µL entry plasmid DNA of GFP, MdαE7 from step 1.2.7 or entry plasmid DNA of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) provided by the cell transfection kit with 5 µL of commercially available (containing attL sites) C-term linear DNA (containing attR sites) in 250 µL PCR tubes. Add TE buffer to make a total volume of 8 µL.",
    "Note: The reactions of GFP and CAT were used as control groups.\nAdd 2 µL of commercially available Lambda recombination (LR) enzyme mix (Table of Materials) into each mixture of step 1.3.1 to catalyze the LR reaction. Gently mix and incubate at 25 °C overnight (≈16 h).\n\t\tNote: The LR reaction facilitates the recombination of an attL-containing entry plasmid DNA with an attR-containing C-term linear DNA to generate an attB-containing expressing virus. This step produces the recombinant baculovirus for each target protein.\nDilute 1 µL of LR reaction products from step 1.3.2 20X. Perform PCR using a Polyhedrin forward primer and V5 reverse primer (Table 1). Use 5 µL of PCR products to run a 1% agarose gel to check the quality.
