    "1. Design and construction of guide RNA (gRNA)\nNOTE: Each gRNA is made up of two 60 base pair (bp) oligonucleotides that are annealed to generate a 100 bp double stranded (ds) oligonucleotide (Figure 1A-C). The timeline for gRNA design, generation, and testing cutting efficiency is approximately 2 weeks (Figure 2).\nSelect the DNA region of interest to be genome edited and identify 3-4 23 bp sequences that fit the format, 5'-G(N19)NGG-3'. These sequences should be located within 20 bp of the region of interest.\n\tNOTE: Targeting can be performed on the sense or anti-sense strand.\nEvaluate the gRNA sequences for genomic redundancy and off-target probability using a resource such as CRISPOR (http://crispor.tefor.net).\nIncorporate the 20 bp target sequence (excluding the protospacer adjacent motif or PAM) into two 60-mer oligonucleotides as shown (sequences are 5' to 3' and red and green are reverse complements as shown in Figure 1C).\nOrder the two 60 bp oligonucleotides from vendor of choice. Once the oligonucleotides are received, resuspend each to a final concentration of 100 µM in ddH2O. Make a working stock of 10 µM.\nAnneal the two oligonucleotides and generate a 100 bp dsDNA fragment using DNA polymerase (Table of Materials). Combine 5 µL of 10 µM forward oligonucleotide and 5 µL of 10 µM reverse oligonucleotide in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strip tube and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min. Cool the reaction for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nSet up the PCR as described in Table 1. Perform PCR amplification in a thermal cycler using the parameters outlined in Table 2.",
    "Visualize the PCR products on a 1.5% (w/v) ethidium bromide (EtBr) agarose gel electrophoresed at 80-100 V for 40 min. Excise the 100 bp band (Figure 3A), visualized on an LED light box, from the gel using a razor blade and purify using a gel extraction kit (Table of Materials).\n2. Design of PCR primers for screening\nPerform screening of the edited DNA using forward and reverse PCR primers that are specifically designed to amplify a 400-500 bp region of the gene of interest (Table 2). Use DNA isolated from any control iPSC line to confirm a clean amplicon when performing the screening PCR.\nVisualize PCR products on a 1.5% (w/v) gel following electrophoresis at 80-100 V for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Sequencing of edited clones is performed using a nested primer that is designed following confirmation of the screening primer set. Samples are sent to a commercial source for sequencing.\n3. Preparation of gRNA_cloning vector plasmid\nTo linearize the cloning vector, take a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and add 1-5 µg of DNA of the gRNA_cloning vector along with 4 µL of the AflII restriction enzyme buffer and 1.5 µL of AflII restriction enzyme. Bring up the reaction to 24 µL of ddH2O. Mix the reaction by pipetting up and down. Incubate at 37 °C overnight (O/N).\nElectrophorese on a 1% agarose gel at 80-100 V for 1 h and excise bands (expected band size is ~3519 bp).\nExtract and purify as in step 1.6.\n4. Assembly of gRNA vector\nSet up reactions and assemble DNA fragments using the assembly kit (Table of Materials) at 1:5 ratios of AflII digested gRNA cloning vector to 100 bp gel purified insert, as described in Table 3.",
    "Incubate the reaction at 50 °C for 15 min. Dilute the reaction 1:3 in ddH2O and use 3 µL for bacterial transformation, as per manufacturer’s instructions (Table of Materials). Plate cells on kanamycin LB/agar plates.\nPick 3-5 colonies per gRNA. Inoculate each colony in 4 mL of LB and grow O/N at 37 °C in an orbital shaking incubator.\nPurify plasmid DNA using a miniprep plasmid isolation kit, and sequence each gRNA using the following primers to ensure successful cloning: Forward: GTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTTAAAGG; Reverse: TGCCAACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCT.\n5. Test gRNA cutting efficiency\nPlate hESCs on irradiated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in a 6-well plate, as previously described21. When the cells reach 70-80% confluency, prepare the transfection master mix outlined in Table 4.\nMix by pipetting and incubate at RT for 15 min. Add dropwise to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 48 h (with a media change after 24 h).\nHarvest cells for sorting after 48 h.\n\t\nRemove MEFs enzymatically (Table of Materials) with a 3 min RT incubation.\nRinse cells 1x with hESC medium (Table 5) and scrape into hESC medium + 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (Table of Materials).\nPellet cells at 300 x g for 3 min and resuspend in 0.5 mL of hESC medium + 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\nFilter into a 5 mL tube through a 35 µm cell-strainer cap.\nUsing fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), gate on live cells and sort the green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells.\nTransfer a maximum of 1.5 x 104 sorted cells directly into a 10 cm2 dish coated with 1:3 basement membrane matrix (Table of Materials) and irradiated MEFs in hESC medium (Table 5) containing Y-27632 dihydrochloride.",
    "Change medium daily using the hESC medium (Table 5) without Y-27632 dihydrochloride and manually pick clones after 10-15 days, when colonies are ~1 mm in diameter.\n\t\nUsing a P200 pipette and microscope, carefully scrape a single clone and draw cells into the pipette.\nDisperse the cells by gently pipetting 3-4x in a 96 well plate in the medium drawn up with the colony.\nDispense into PCR strip tubes for screening and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 min. Pick 20 colonies per gRNA.\n6. Clone screening\nIsolate DNA by incubating cell pellets in 20 µL of proteinase K buffer (Table 5) (1 h at 55 °C and 10 min at 95 °C) and vortex vigorously. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 min and collect the supernatant.\nPerform screening PCR (section 2) in a total volume of 20 µL using a master mix including primers designed to amplify the region of interest and 5 µL of the proteinase K digest. Use genomic DNA isolated from the cell line that was gene edited as a control.\nEvaluate size changes of PCR products following 1 h electrophoresis at 70-90 V on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel (Figure 3B,C). Any size difference is indicative of cleavage.\n7. Precise genome editing in pluripotent stem cells using single strand oligo DNA (ssODNs)\nDesign 100 bp ssODNs centered around the most efficient gRNA sequence determined to have the best cutting efficiency.\nPrevent re-cleavage of the recombined ODN by introducing silent mutations in the gRNA sequence. A single silent mutation in the PAM sequence is sufficient, but if not possible, 3-4 silent mutations will work.\n\tNOTE: To facilitate screening of targeted clones, the introduction of a restriction site within ~20 bp of the gRNA sequence is ideal.",
    "Design one ODN with the desired base change(s) to create the mutation of interest and one ODN without the base change(s).\n\tNOTE: These changes should be no more than ~20 bp from the predicted CRISPR/CAS9 cut site, as recombination drops off considerably at greater distances.\nOrder the two ssODNs from vendor of choice and resuspend in water to make 1 µg/µL stocks. Store stocks at -20 °C.\n8. Transfection setup\nTo transfect the ssODN and the CRISPR-CAS9 plasmids, plate the target cell line in a 6-well dish on irradiated MEFs to reach 70-80% confluency after an O/N incubation.\nSet up the transfection reaction as described in Table 6. Mix the reaction by pipetting and incubate for 15 min at RT. Add the transfection reaction mixture dropwise to the cells.\nAfter 48 h, prepare the cells for cell sorting as described in section 5.3.\nPick colonies ~10 days after plating single cells using a 200 μL pipette. Transfer 100 μL of cells to one well of a 24 or 48 well plate previously coated with gelatin and irradiated MEFs in hESC medium with Y-27632 dihydrochloride. Use the remaining 100 μL for DNA isolation as described in section 6.\n9. Checking for mutations in single colonies\nTo check for successful integration of the ssODN, take 5 µL of DNA isolated from each colony to perform PCR using the screening primers designed in section 2. Purify the PCR products (Table of Materials) and prepare the restriction enzyme digestion using the unique enzyme site created in the ssODN.\n\tNOTE: This digestion also includes the restriction enzyme buffer and the manufacturer's recommended concentration of restriction enzyme in a volume of 40 µL.\nMix the reaction by pipetting and incubate at the manufacturer's recommended temperature for 1-3 h.",
    "Visualize the digested PCR products on a 1.5% (w/v) EtBr agarose gel electrophoresed at 80-100 V for 40 min. If successful integration of the ssODN has occurred, sequence specific mutations using a nested primer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
