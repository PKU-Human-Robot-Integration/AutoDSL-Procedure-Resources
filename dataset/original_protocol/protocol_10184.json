    "1. Chemical Solution Preparation\nNOTE: The following steps are for preparing chemical solutions required in later steps. These can be made in bulk and stored for several months.\nTo begin, prepare 50 mL of purified, deionized water by sterilizing in a 254 nm UV crosslinking oven for 15 min (15 mJ/cm2 total exposure) to neutralize any contaminating DNA. Heat to 37 °C for use in following steps.\nMake 10 mL of a 40% total (T) and 3.3% crosslinker (C) (29:1) polyacrylamide precursor solution. Weigh 3.867 g of acrylamide monomer and 0.133 g of bis-acrylamide monomer. Combine and bring volume up to 10 mL with warm purified water and vortex until dissolved. Store protected from light at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Premixed 40% T, 3.3% C (29:1) polyacrylamide solutions can be purchased commercially.\nMake 10mL of 50% T, 5% C gel solution. Weigh 4.750 g of acrylamide monomer and 0.250 g of bis-acrylamide monomer. Combine and bring volume up to 10 mL using warm purified water and vortex until dissolved. Store protected from light at room temperature.\nMake 10 mL of a 50% (w/v) sucrose solution. Add 5 g sucrose to a graduated cylinder and add warm purified water up to a total volume of 10 mL. Vortex until dissolved and store at room temperature.\nMake 10 mL of 10% APS (w/v). Add 1 g of ammonium persulfate (APS) to a graduated cylinder. Add cold (~4° C) purified water up to a total volume of 10 mL and vortex until dissolved. Immediately freeze in aliquots of 200 µL.\n2. Gel-seq Cassette Fabrication\nNote: Gel-seq was originally developed with upright cassettes (see Table of Materials for more information); however, this protocol can be adapted to work with any standard gel electrophoresis cassette.",
    "Prepare gel precursors in three separate plastic tubes by adding reagents as shown below in Table 1. Do not add either APS or Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) until directed in the following steps. Vortex ingredients to mix thoroughly.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\nFiller Gel Precursor,Filler Gel Precursor,High Density Gel Precursor,High Density Gel Precursor,Low Density Gel Precursor,Low Density Gel Precursor\n\"40%T, 3.3%C Acrylamide Bisacrylamide Solution\",1.6 mL,\"50%T, 5%C Acrylamide Bisacrylamide Solution\",2.4 mL,\"40%T, 3.3%C Acrylamide Bisacrylamide Solution\",0.6 mL\nDeionized Water,10.2 mL,Deionized Water,1.0 mL,Deionized Water,4.8 mL\nSucrose Solution (50% w/v),2.6 mL,Sucrose Solution (50% w/v),0.6 mL,,\n10X Tris-Borate-EDTA,1.6 mL,,,10X Tris-Borate-EDTA,0.6 mL\n,,,,,\nAmmonium persulfate (10% w/v),104.0 µL,Ammonium persulfate (10% w/v),50.0 µL,Ammonium persulfate (10% w/v),39.0 µL\nTEMED,6.0 µL,TEMED,1.0 µL,TEMED,2.2 µL\n,,,,,\nTotal Volume,16.1 mL,Total Volume,4.1 mL,Total Volume,6.0 mL\nTable 1. Gel Synthesis Reagents. Polyacrylamide gel precursor reagents sufficient for fabrication of 2 cassettes.\nDe-gas gel monomer solutions by inserting a needle through the cap of the tube and connecting this needle to a house vacuum line. Submerge this assembly in an ultrasonic bath set to high and wait until bubbles stop emerging from the liquid before moving to next step (~60 seconds / tube).\n\tNOTE: The quality of the vacuum and power of the ultrasonic bath is not critical so long as bubbles can be seen emerging from the solution.\nAdd TEMED and APS to the filler gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately add 6 mL of the filler gel precursor to each gel cassette by pipetting the solution into the top of the cassette. Use a 1 mL micropipette to add the precursor in six increments to avoid spilling. The total time for this step should be less than 3 minutes.",
    "Ensure the fluid is level by positioning the cassettes upright on a level table. Fill the remainder of the cassette with deionized, degassed water. Pipette the water, again using 1 mL increments, slowly into the center of the cassette to minimize mixing. Allow the polymer to cure for at least one hour, up to overnight.\nAfter the polymer has cured, invert the gel cassettes over a sink to remove the water overlay. A compressed air gun can be used to gently dry the interface by blowing air through the top opening of the cassette from a distance of 6 inches.\nAdd TEMED and APS to the high-density gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately add 320 µL of the high-density precursor to the cassette, again using a 1 mL pipette. Ensure the fluid evenly coats the filler gel layer by rocking the cassette back and forth around 3 times. This step should take less than three minutes.\nFill the remainder of the cassette with deionized, degassed water. Pipette slowly with a 1 mL pipette into the center of the cassette to minimize mixing. Allow the polymer to cure for at least fifteen minutes, preferably an hour.\nAgain, invert the gel cassettes to remove the water overlay. Compressed air can be used to gently dry the interface. Add TEMED and APS to the low-density gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately fill the remainder of the cassette (~1.65 mL) with the low-density gel precursor and insert the gel comb.\nPipette an excess of reserve precursor at the top of the comb as it will be absorbed during polymerization. Allow the polymer to cure at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Gels can be stored for a week or more in a buffer of Tris-Borate-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (TBE buffer).\n3. Sample Preparation and Reverse Transcription",
    "Starting with a suspension of the cells of interest, and working in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laminar flow hood, use a hemocytometer or an automatic cell counter to calculate the cell concentration. Dilute the cells to a concentration of 100 to 1000 cells per µL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: This protocol has been validated on a range of cells including PC3, HeLa, and mouse liver cells.\nUsing reagents provided in the WTA kit (see Table of Materials), mix 19 µL of lysis buffer and 1 µL of RNase inhibitor to prepare a 10X stock solution of reaction buffer. Create a lysis master mix of sufficient volume containing 0.5 µL of reaction buffer and 2.75 µL of nuclease free water for each sample.\nPipette the cell suspension up and down 5 times to re-suspend settled cells and then pipette 1 µL of sample into a 200 µL nuclease free strip tube sterilized by UV. Repeat as necessary depending on number of samples. Be sure to include a negative control by pipetting 1 µL of nuclease free water instead of cells for one reaction. Next, add 3.25 µL of lysis master mix to each sample and mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.\nPreheat a thermal cycler (with heated lid) to 72 °C. Add 1 µL of RT primer and 1 µL of 20 µM random hexamer with WTA adapter (5′-AAGCAGTGGTAT-CAACGCAGAGTAC-NNNNNN-3′) to each sample. Reserve at least one tube as a positive control for gDNA library preparation and add 2 µL of water instead of primers.\n\tNOTE: Random hexamer with WTA adapter is optional and has minimal impact on sequencing results.",
    "Incubate samples at 72 °C in the preheated thermal cycler for 3 minutes to lyse the cells. Remove cells from thermal cycler and place on ice for 2 minutes. Store the positive control at 4 °C until step 5.\nWhile the cells are lysing, create a sufficient volume of reverse transcription master mix for all RNA samples containing the following reagent ratios: 2 µL of first strand buffer, 0.5 µL of template switch oligonucleotide (TSO), 0.25 µL of RNase inhibitor, and 1 µL of reverse transcriptase (100 U/µL).\nPreheat thermal cycler to 42 °C. Add 3.75 µL of reverse transcription master mix to the remaining samples, bringing the total sample volume to 10 µL. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nPerform reverse transcription by immediately placing samples in a preheated thermal cycler. Run the following program: 42 °C for 90 min, 70 °C for 10 min, 4 °C forever. This is a safe stopping point.\n4. Gel Separation and Sample Recovery\nCarefully clean a gel electrophoresis chamber using a DNA removal product. Apply several mL of the liquid cleaning agent to a disposable lint free wipe and wipe across all surfaces of the chamber, and then fill the chamber with clean 0.5x TBE. For optimal results, place the entire apparatus in a 254 nm UV crosslinking oven and sterilize for 15 minutes (15 mJ/cm2).\nInsert the Gel-seq cassette into the gel electrophoresis chamber and lock it into place. Slowly remove the gel comb by pulling straight up. Move slowly to avoid tearing the gel or ripping any of the arms.",
    "Keeping the samples from step 3 on ice, reserve at least one sample as a positive control for cDNA library generation. Store this control at 4 °C until step 6. Add 2 µL of 6X loading dye to the remaining samples, bringing the total volume to ~12 µL. Thoroughly mix the samples by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nCombine 1 µL of a DNA ladder with 2 µL of 6x loading dye and 7 µL of water. Pipette this mixture into lane 1 of the Gel-seq cassette as an electrophoresis control. Pipette the samples from the previous step into separate lanes of the Gel-seq cassette. Be careful to prevent contamination between wells by inserting the pipette fully into each well and removing it using only a vertical motion.\nUsing a standard gel electrophoresis power supply, apply an electric field of 250 V across the Gel-seq cassette for 30 minutes to separate the gDNA from the cDNA/RNA hybrids. Once separated, remove the Gel-seq cassette from the gel electrophoresis chamber and open the two halves of the cassette by prying the edges with a scraping tool.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the gel in half just below the high-density layer. Discard the half that contains filler gel by picking it up with your gloved hand. Gently peel the remaining gel off of the cassette by scraping it with a paint scraper or other similar tool. Place this section of the gel into a dish containing ~30 mL of 0.5x TBE with 3 µL of gel stain.",
    "Cover the container to minimize photobleaching and soak the gel while gently shaking the container for 5 minutes. Place the gel on plastic wrap and take a UV image using a gel documentation system (for further detail see Ref. 13). A 30 second exposure typically produces clear images. Verify that separation has occurred.\nMove the gel to a UV transilluminator to facilitate visualization of the nucleic acids. Wearing appropriate UV glasses, confirm the results from the gel documentation system. The gDNA should be located at the start of the low-density gel and the cDNA at the interface of the low-density and high-density regions.\nUse a scalpel, cut out the regions of the gel containing the gDNA and cDNA. Samples are best recovered by cutting a 4 mm by 10 mm rectangular section of gel; however, the exact geometry will depend on the gel electrophoresis system used. Remember to also cut the lane loaded with the negative control.\nPlace each excised section of gel into a strip tube by using a pair of blunt end tweezers. Be careful not to apply too much force or the gel will split into multiple pieces. Should this happen, simply pick up each piece and add it to the tube.\nGrind the gel in each tube using the tip of a pipette (200 µL pipette tips work well) by moving the pipette tip in a circular fashion against the bottom of the tube. Add nuclease free water (40 µL into the gDNA samples and 80 µL into the cDNA samples) to each tube before removing the pipette tip used to grind the gel to minimize sample loss.",
    "Place the strip tubes to a vortex mixer inside of a 37 °C incubator and shake for 8 - 12 hours. This allows the nucleic acids to diffuse out of the gel and is a natural stopping point for this multi day protocol.\nPipette the samples into an 8 µm mesh filter plate and spin the plate at 2600 x g for 5 minutes to strain out the gel fragments. Lift the mesh filter plate away from the housing plate and pipette the gel-free water samples into a new 200 µL strip tube.\nAdd 1 µL of protease (0.9 AU/mL) to each sample containing gDNA, mix well by pipetting up and down, and incubate at 50 °C for 15 min followed by a heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. This step is critical for depleting nucleosomes and makes the gDNA accessible for subsequent reaction steps.\nUsing an 18 gauge needle, poke holes in the caps of all sample tubes. Place the samples in a vacufuge to reduce liquid volume. gDNA samples should be reduced to 5 µL and cDNA samples reduced to 10 µL.\nDepending on the vacufuge and number of samples, the total evaporation time will vary between 30 and 60 minutes. If the sample volume falls below the target volume, simply add nuclease free water to increase the sample volume.\n5. gDNA Library Preparation\nUsing a fluorometer or similar technology, quantify the DNA concentration in each gDNA sample from step 4 as well as the positive control from step 3. For a detailed protocol see the fluorometer reference manual.14",
    "Dilute the samples to 0.2 ng/µL of DNA. Depending on the starting cell type and quality of results required, lower concentrations may still produce viable libraries. Some experimentation will be required; however, the authors had success with libraries as low as 0.1 ng/µL.\nComplete gDNA library preparation by following the library preparation half reaction volume protocol in Step 7.\n6. cDNA Library Preparation\nStarting with the 10 µL cDNA samples and positive control from step 4, add 12.5 µL of 2X qPCR mix, 0.5 µL cDNA PCR primer, and 2 µL nuclease-free water.\nPerform PCR in a real-time thermocycler using the following protocol: hot-start at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 20-30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. Total sample volume is 25 µL. Monitor the reaction curves and stop the amplification before the reactions leave the exponential phase (linear signal increase versus cycle number) in order to avoid PCR artifacts due to overamplification. For more on avoiding overamplification, see the discussion section of this paper as well as Ref. 15.\nAfter amplification, clean the product using solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads following the protocol in step 8. Once completed, proceed to the next step.\nUsing a fluorometer or similar technology, quantify the DNA concentration in each cDNA sample as well as the positive control from step 4. Dilute the samples if necessary to contain approximately 0.2 ng/µL of DNA. Slightly lower concentrations still produce viable libraries. Some experimentation will be required, however the authors had success with libraries as low as 0.1 ng/µL.",
    "Optional step: Perform a standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation on 1 - 2 µL of each the qPCR product to validate the library generation reaction worked. A sample image of successful result is shown in Figure 4. For a detailed protocol on how to conduct polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, see Ref. 16.\nComplete cDNA library preparation by following the library preparation kit half volume reaction protocol in Step 7.\n7. Library Preparation with Half Volume Reactions\nLibrary preparation follows the library preparation kit protocol using half volume reactions.17 All reagents referenced in this section of the protocol are from the library preparation kit (see Table of Materials). Begin by UV sterilizing a sufficient number of strip tubes for the number of samples to be processed.\nPerform the transposase reaction by adding 5 µL transposase buffer to each strip tube to be used in the assay. Then add 2.5 µL input DNA at 0.2 ng/µL (0.5 ng total) followed by 2.5 µL transposase. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nIncubate at 55 °C for 5 minutes, then hold at 10 °C. After the sample reaches 10 °C, remove it from the thermocycler and immediately add 2.5 µL transposase stop buffer to each sample. Keep the samples at room temperature for 5 minutes.\nPrepare the PCR reaction to amplify the transpose treated sample by adding 7.5 µL library prep PCR mix, 2.5 µL of an index 1 primer, and 2.5 µL of an index 2 primer. These primers are proprietary and are supplied by the manufacturer of the library preparation kit. Mix well by pipetting up and down 5 times.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that unique primer combinations are used for each sample. There are 12 different index 1 primers and 8 different index 2 primers, making it possible to uniquely label up to 96 different samples. Choose a unique combination of primers for each sample.\nPerform PCR using the following program on a thermocycler. The sample volume is 25 µL.\n\t   72 °C for 3 minutes\n\t   95 °C for 30 seconds\n\t   12 cycles of:\n\t         95 °C for 10 seconds\n\t         72 °C for 30 seconds\n\t         55 °C for 30 seconds\n\t   72 °C for 5 minutes\n\t​   Hold at 10 °C\nClean the prepared libraries using SPRI beads following the protocol in step 8. The libraries should be validated using gel electrophoresis or a similar assay. Refer to the library preparation kit manual for details on how to validate libraries.17\n8. Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization Bead Library Cleaning\nSolid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads should be stored in 1.5 mL aliquots and should be brought to room temperature before each use. It is also recommended to prepare fresh 80% ethanol for each experiment. The following steps are based the SPRI bead protocol in the WTA kit manual.18\nAdd 1 µl of the WTA kit lysis buffer to each PCR product. Vortex the SPRI beads until evenly mixed, then add 50 µl of SPRI beads to each sample. Mix by pipetting the sample up and down 10 times and then incubate the samples at room temperature for 8 minutes.\nBriefly spin the samples to collect the liquid from the side of the tubes. Place the samples on a magnetic separation device for ~5 minutes until the liquid appears completely clear.",
    "While the samples are on the magnetic separation device, slowly pipette off the supernatant and discard - be careful not to disturb the ring of beads on the tube. Next add 200 µL of 80% ethanol to each sample without disturbing the beads. Wait for 30 seconds and then carefully pipette off the supernatant. Repeat this step (ethanol wash) once.\nAllow the samples to dry for 30 s - 1 min. Do not over-dry the samples as large fragments will become permanently bound to the beads.\n\tNOTE: A brief dry time is recommended to ensure all traces of ethanol are removed. Should trace amounts of ethanol remain behind they can slightly inhibit downstream reactions.\nRemove the samples from the magnetic separation device and add 15 µL of water to each sample to elute the DNA from the beads. Pipette up and down and ensure the beads are removed from the sides of the tubes. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. Briefly spin the samples and then place them on the magnetic separation device for ~1 minute until the solution appears clear.\nWhile the samples are on the magnetic separation device, slowly pipette up the supernatant and transfer it to clean tubes. Be careful not to disturb the ring of beads on the tube. Discard the tubes with beads.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
