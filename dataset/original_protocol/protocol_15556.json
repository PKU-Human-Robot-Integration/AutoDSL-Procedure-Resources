    "All animal experiments complied with local laws and guidelines for animal use, and were approved by the local Ethical Review Committee at the University of Glasgow. Animals were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986, under the auspices of a UK Home Office Project License. For this study, in-house bred adult C57BL/6J mice were used. The use of young females (8-12 weeks) is recommended due to the higher success rate of pregnancy; males can be reused for multiple rounds of breeding. Figure 1 represents a schematic overview of the described method to generate mixed neuronal and glial cultures.\n1. Preparation of the tissue culture consumables\nPrepare the plates and/or dishes containing microscopy coverslips inside a Class 2 Safety cabinet. Sterilize all reagents or autoclave to ensure sterility during the culture period.\nAdd the appropriate volume of BA-PLL (13.2 µg/mL poly-L-lysinehydrobromide [PLL] in boric acid buffer [BA] [50 mM boric acid, 12.5 mM sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5]; see Table of Materials) to each well (1,000 µL/well in a 6-well plate, 100 µL/well in a 96-well plate; volumes are summarized in Table 1). For microscopy coverslips, add 20 mL of BA-PLL to a 9 cm diameter tissue culture dish containing 200 sterile coverslips, and swirl to distribute evenly.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1-2 h.\nRemove the BA-PLL solution from each well or dish containing microscopy coverslips, and wash by adding 20 mL of sterile water, swirling the coverslips, and then removing the water. Repeat this wash step three times. For a dish containing coverslips, leave sterile water in the tissue culture dish on the final wash to easily remove the coverslips.\nRemove as much liquid as possible with a sterile pipette and allow to dry for at least 2 h to overnight.",
    "Store the coated plates at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\n\tNOTE: The prepared boric acid with poly-l-lysine (BA-PLL) solution can be reused up to three time, adding new PLL each time. Store the BA-PLL at 4 °C. Dishes are treated with BA-PLL, as the PLL allows the cells to stick down and grow. Without this treatment, the cells will lift after approximately 1 week of culture and no longer be able to differentiate.\n2. Dissection of E17 embryonal brains\nCo-house one or multiple female mice with a male mouse. Check the females daily for a mucus plug, indicating mating has taken place.\n\tNOTE: Any \"plugged\" female mice need to be separated from the male to ensure the correct start date of gestation. Mice can be weighed to confirm pregnancy or monitored visually.\nCull the pregnant mouse at E17 using appropriate methods in compliance with local animal welfare guidance and laws, for example, by raising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, a lethal anesthetic overdose, or dislocation of the neck.\n\tNOTE: The chosen method must not disrupt the embryos. For this study, exposure to a rising concentration of carbon dioxide gas followed by confirmation of death by severing the femoral artery was used to cull pregnant dams.\nPlace the culled, pregnant mouse on its back on a dissection board; while pinning it down is not required, it might make it easier for inexperienced researchers. Pinch the midline of the abdomen using forceps. Using sharp scissors, cut open the abdomen through the skin and the peritoneum over the midline from the genitalia to the ribcage, being careful not to puncture the uterus.\n\t\nThe mouse uterus has two horns, each typically containing one to five embryos. Remove the uterus containing the embryos from the mother and immediately place it on ice.",
    "Cut through the yolk sack on the side of the placentas, being careful not to damage the embryos, and remove the embryos from their yolk sack.\nImmediately decapitate the embryos. Add the decapitated heads into a dish with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) (HBSS-/-) on ice.\n\tNOTE: If genotyping is required, one can remove the tail at this stage for genetic analysis. When multiple genotypes are expected, the heads of each embryo should be kept separately for culturing.\nUsing angled forceps, position the head on its side facing left.\nPierce the eye with one edge of the forceps, firmly holding the chin with the other.\nStarting at the nape, gently tear the skin of the scalp along the midline toward the tip of the snout.\nEntering through the spinal cord, noticeable as a white oval, use the angled forceps to crack open the skull along the midline, exposing the brain.\nGently peel the skull away on the side facing upward, exposing the brain.\nLift the brain out of the skull, disposing of the skull once the brain has been completely removed.\nUsing the forceps, remove the meninges, which are noticeable as a thin membrane with dense blood vessels.\nPlace the brains into a bijou (see Table of Materials) containing 2 mL of HBSS-/- on ice.\nRepeat steps 2.6 to 2.13 with the remaining brains, adding up to four brains per bijou.\nAdd 250 µL of 10x trypsin to the bijou and triturate the brains by shaking the bijou. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: All steps from this point forward should be performed in a sterile tissue culture hood.",
    "Thaw 2 mL of soybean trypsin (SD) inhibitor (Leibovitz L-15, 0.52 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor from soybean, 40 µg/mL DNase I, 3 mg/mL bovine serum albumin [BSA] fraction V; see Table of Materials) from -20 °C by placing it at 37 °C.\nAdd 2 mL of SD inhibitor to each bijou containing brains (per bijou containing up to four brains), shaking the bijou again to disperse it evenly.\n\tNOTE: SD inhibitor decreases the trypsin activity to prevent unnecessary digestion of the samples and preserve cell viability.\nWithout centrifugation, remove 2 mL of the supernatant from each bijou and transfer into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, being careful not to transfer cell clumps.\nTriturate the remaining cells in the bijou with a 19 G needle attached to a 5 mL syringe by aspirating the suspension twice. This will create a thick mucus-like mixture.\n\t\nRepeat twice more using a 21 G needle. If there are clumps remaining, triturate once more with the 21 G needle.\nTransfer the cells from the bijou to the same 15 mL centrifuge tube (from step 2.18) using a 23 G needle.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nRemove all the supernatant using a 5 mL serological pipette and transfer it to another 15 mL centrifuge tube, being careful not to disturb the loose pellet at the bottom containing the required cells.\nCentrifuge the supernatant again at 200 x g at RT for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: This step is not essential, but if one requires many cells or has few embryos, one could perform this step to recover as many cells as possible from the supernatant.",
    "Using 10 mL of plating media (PM) (49% Dulbecco's modified eagle medium [DMEM], 1% penicillin/streptomycin [Pen/Strep], 25% horse serum, 25% HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ [HBSS+/+]; see Table of Materials), combine and resuspend the two pellets together to create a whole cell suspension.\nCount the cells using trypan blue and either a hemocytometer or digital cell counter, and dilute the cell suspension with PM to a concentration of 1.8 x 106 cells/mL.\n3. Plating the cells\nAdd the required volume of the cell suspension to the required format as detailed in Table 1: 1,000 µL per well in 6-well format, 50 µL per well in 96-well format, or 100 µL per coverslip.\nIncubate for 2-4 h at 37 °C with 5%-7% CO2. Check the cells have adhered using an inverted microscope.\nRemove the media and top up with new differentiation media (DM+: DM- including 10 µg/mL insulin. DM-: DMEM, 1% Pen/Strep, 50 nM hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL biotin, 2.5 mL 100x N1 media supplement; see Table of Materials). Volumes are detailed in Table 1. Press down any floating coverslips using a sterile pipette tip.\n4. Maintaining the cultures\nNOTE: These cultures require feeding thrice weekly to support optimal growth and differentiation. The cultures will reach optimum health and maturity for experiments on DIV (days in vitro) 21. Cells can be kept in culture for up to 28 days, after which the cultures quickly degenerate.\nThree times per week until DIV12, replace part of the supernatant with fresh DM+ by removing 500 µL per well in 6-well format, 50 µL per well in 96-well format, or 500 µL per dish containing three coverslips, and adding 600 µL per well in 6-well format, 60 µL per well in 96-well format, or 600 µL per coverslip dish (Table 1).",
    "Three times per week from DIV13 onwards, replace part of the supernatant with fresh DM- by removing 500 µL per well in 6-well format, 50 µL per well in 96-well format, or 500 µL per dish containing three coverslips, and adding 600 µL per well in 6-well format, 60 µL per well in 96-well format, or 600 µL per coverslip dish (Table 1).\nSubscription Required.
