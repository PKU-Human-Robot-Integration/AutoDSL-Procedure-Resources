    "The experiments described herein were approved by the Ethical Research Committee of the University of Murcia, Spain, and were performed in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Commission. The steps described were performed under standard operating protocols that were part of the plan of work and have not been performed solely for the purpose of filming the accompanying video to this paper.\n1. Preparation of Cells and Mammalian Expression Vector\nNOTE: Here, we briefly describe a protocol for preparation and transfection of a cell line (human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293)); however, appropriate cell specific protocols for the cell type of interest should be optimized (e.g., stem cells).\nMaintain HEK-293 cells in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% sodium pyruvate, 2 mM Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Once cells are sub-confluent, split at a ratio of 1:3.\nStart splitting the cells by aspirating the media, then wash once with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), remove excess PBS and then incubate with 2.5 mL of 0.5x Trypsin-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (5 min, 37 °C).\n\t\nAdd one volume of DMEM media (supplemented as described above) to stop the reaction, and then detach the cells by slowly and gently aspirating up and down with an electronic pipette.\nThen, transfer the cell suspension to an appropriate container (e.g., 15-50 mL conical centrifuge tube). Centrifuge in a swing bucket (100 x g), discard the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with sterile PBS.\nResuspend the pellet in fresh DMEM media and seed at an appropriate cell density (e.g., 1 x 106 cells in a 75 cm2 flask) in fresh culture flasks or large dishes according to local laboratory practices.",
    "Replace existing media with fresh media every 2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The expression vector was derived from pIRES1hyg and used according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described21. p(EGFP) IRES1hyg was generated by subcloning EGFP cDNA as a BamHI + NotI insert from pEGFP-N1 into the BamHI + NotI digested pIRES1hyg21.\n1 day before transfection, seed HEK-293 cells at a density of 0.5 x 105 cells/cm2 in 12- or 24-well tissue culture plates.\nOn the day of transfection, prepare DNA-lipid transfection reagent complexes in separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (1 tube/well).\n\t\nStart by adding 250 µL of reduced serum medium into each tube, and then add 4 µg DNA (mix gently).\nSubsequently, add 250 µL from a previously prepared mix of 10 µL lipid transfection reagent and 250 µL of reduced serum medium, to each tube (mix again gently).\nFinally, proceed with transfections, by incubating HEK-293 cells with DNA lipid transfection reagent complexes for 4 h, and then replace with DMEM medium supplemented as described above (step 1.1), and incubate for another 48 h. Perform drug selection of stable transfectants with 100 µg/mL hygromycin B.\nDetach HEK-293 cells with trypsin as described above (step 1.2). After washing the cells in sterile PBS, resuspend in an appropriate vehicle (e.g., 10% v/v InI in PBS), to achieve a final cell concentration of 5 x 106/mL.\n2. Preparation of the Rabbit",
    "NOTE: The positioning of the rabbit and the transducer for IMI is not optimal to evaluate morphology and function of the heart of the animal. Thus, it is advisable to perform a complete echocardiographic examination20 prior to the IMI (see below), and at subsequent time points as defined by the experimental design. This will aim to evaluate the baseline anatomical and functional characteristics of the heart in the animal that will receive an injection, and also evaluate the effects, of IMI in the function of the heart.\nPerform this examination in a blinded fashion and following the guidelines of the Echocardiography Committee of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging22,23,24.\nObtain a simultaneous 1-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing throughout the whole echocardiographic study.\nAnesthetize the rabbit with ketamine 10 mg/kg, combined with medetomidine 200 µg/kg, intramuscular (I.M.) injection.\nVerify the level of anesthesia after 10-20 min following administration of anesthesia.\nUsing a hair clipper remove the hair of the chest widely (e.g., below the neck to the sub-xiphoid region) (Figure 1A).\nShave additional regions of 1-2 cm2 in the internal face of the right forelimb (mediocubital region) and of both hind limbs (mediotibial region) (Figure 1B).\nPlace adhesive ECG electrodes on the shaved regions of the limbs to synchronously monitor the heart rhythm during the procedure (Figure 1C).\nPlace the animal in the decubitus supine position on a thermal blanket, with the limbs outstretched using surgical tape attached to the table (Figure 1C).\n\t\nMake sure the ears are flexed backwards behind the head/back of the rabbit, and at a position that is lower than its forelimbs, since this helps to maintain correct positioning of the thorax of the animal throughout the procedure.",
    "Allow the animal to breathe spontaneously whilst administering oxygen by face mask throughout the whole procedure (100%, 2-3 L/min).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56699/56699fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Percutaneous Contrast Echocardiography-guided IMI Technique in the Rabbit\nClean and disinfect the skin of the thorax with a chlorhexidine-based solution.\n\t\nUse an aseptic technique throughout the whole procedure, according to current best practice.\nWhenever possible, and if reasonably practicable, perform a fully sterile procedure, including, but not limited to, the use of sterile material such as gowns, gloves, surgical wound drapes, sterile dressing material for the table, as well as a sterile ultrasound transducer cover and sterile ultrasound gel. This will reduce to a minimum the risk of introducing pathogens to the animal receiving IMI, and is standard practice in the clinical setting (e.g., during cardiac puncture).\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to always proceed in line with local and national regulations of animal research applicable to the local institution and country of practice.\nApply ultrasound transmission gel to the chest and/or to the transducer, and with the transducer cord around the experimenter's neck, perform a quick window scan of the animal's heart, which is often helpful to visualize anatomy and to plan for the IMI.\nPlace the transducer manually at the 4th-6th intercostal space, 2-3 cm away from the right parasternal line with an angle of incidence of ~ 90° with respect to the right side of the thoracic wall (Figure 2A).",
    "Adjust the location of the transducer relative to the intercostal space as well as its anteroposterior and dorsoventral angle to optimize a modified short axis view at the level of the papillary muscles. Identify in this view the right ventricle (RV), left ventricle (LV), interventricular septum (IVS), posterior wall (PW), as well as anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM) papillary muscles (Figure 2B).\n\t\nHave a wide field of view by significantly increasing the depth using the appropriate control on the system (e.g., button, dial).\nPay particular attention to obtaining a symmetrical image in this view, as well as appropriate differentiation of endocardial and epicardial contours, and, if necessary, adjust through image optimization controls (e.g., gain).\nOnce the optimal echocardiographic view is obtained (Figure 2B), maintain this position throughout the rest of the procedure, whilst a second operator performs the IMI (see below).\n\t\nWhilst holding the transducer, avoid concealing the transducer orientation mark, which should always be facing forward, thus allowing its alignment with the needle in subsequent steps (Figure 2A, C).\nWith a 24-G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe, place the needle close to the skin of the left hemithorax in a symmetric mirroring position with respect to the transducer. Then, manually align the needle with the transducer orientation mark at an angle of ~ 90° (Figure 2C), and slowly advance the needle through the skin and into the chest cavity.\n\tNOTE: The percutaneous needle insertion in this position and orientation facilitates the visualization of the needle in the plane of the ultrasound beam (Figure 2D, E), thus allowing real time monitoring and, when necessary, adjustment of the location of the needle relative to the target region of the myocardium (Figure 2G, H).",
    "With the tip at the target location, slowly deliver the injectate (up to 0.25 mL per injection site) within 10-30 s (Figure 2E), whilst slowly and gently retracting the needle during injection to increase the extent of the myocardium treated.\n\t\nUse InI 10% (v/v) diluted in PBS for standardization of the technique, and as an in situ tracer whilst acquiring competency, as well as to confirm successful targeting of all four IMI sites within the myocardium by gross pathology and histopathology (see Representative Results). Once competency is achieved, InI could be substituted by a suitable commercial ultrasound contrast agent if desired.\n\t\tNOTE: Delivery of 10% (v/v) InI diluted in PBS either with or without cells into the myocardium results in transmural hyperechogenicity (i.e., echo bright appearance) at the target site of injection (Figure 2E, F). Transient deceleration or acceleration of the heart rate, associated with premature ventricular contractions (e.g., isolated, couplets and triplets) are frequently observed even from the first contact of the needle with the epicardium as well as during and/or shortly after IMI. However, no life-threatening arrhythmias are developed, and acute adverse effects are rarely observed using up to 0.25 mL (1.25 x 106 cells) of injectate per IMI injection site (see Representative Results and Discussion).\nPerform subtle changes in the angle of incidence of the needle as necessary to complete injections of 0.25 mL to each of the four target IMI sites (three in the left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and one in the IVS).\nAfter completing the percutaneous contrast echocardiography-guided IMI procedure, evaluate heart rhythm (e.g., through serial ECG trace and/or 24 h Holter ECG), and perform serial window echocardiographic scans to verify the absence of complications, until the animal is fully recovered from anesthesia, and only then transfer to a light cycle room.",
    "Here, we use 24 h Holter ECG to monitor the effects of IMI with InI on heart rhythm for 24 h. For this, we compared a group of 6 rabbits with normal phenotype (Normal Group) and a group of 6 rabbits that received intravenous administration of Doxorubicin (a cardiotoxic anthracycline drug, commonly used for the treatment of cancer; DOX group) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/week for 8 weeks, and then both cohorts received IMI with InI.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56699/56699fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
