    "Adult wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained under standard photoperiod (14/10 h light/dark) and temperature (28 °C) conditions. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the French and European Community Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Research (86/609/EEC and 2010/63/EU) and were approved by the local Ethics Committee for animal experimentation.\n1. Establishing a Model of Acute Hyperglycemia in Zebrafish\nPrepare a stock solution of tricaine (MS-222) by dissolving 400 mg of tricaine powder in 97.9 mL of water and 2.1 mL of 1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9). Adjust the pH to 7 and aliquot for storage at -20 °C.\nPrepare an anesthetic for the adult zebrafish by putting 5 mL of tricaine (stock solution) into 100 mL of fish water (final tricaine concentration: 0.02%).\nTransfer one zebrafish (3 to 6 months) from its tank to the anesthetic until it stops moving.\nRemove the fish using a cut pipette and quickly dry it on absorbent tissue paper.\nWeigh the fish.\nPrepare a syringe of D-glucose dissolved in 1X PBS and inject 50 µL of D-glucose (2.5 g/kg bodyweight).\n\tNOTE: For instance, a 0.6 g fish will receive 50 µL of 3% D-glucose/PBS solution.\nPut the fish on its back and insert the needle of the syringe into the intraperitoneal cavity.\nSlowly inject the D-glucose/PBS solution and then place the fish back in the water.\nCheck on the fish until it recovers completely. Return it to its tank until the required time for performing the blood glucose measurement is reached.\n\tNOTE: The blood glucose is measured 1.5 h after the injection.\n2. Establishing a Model of Chronic Hyperglycemia in Zebrafish\nPrepare a 2 L tank of clean fish water.\nDissolve 40 g of D-glucose into the 2 L of fish water for a final D-glucose concentration of 111 mM.",
    "Immerse 5 to 7 adult zebrafish in the D-glucose-containing water.\nReplace the D-glucose fish water every 2 days in order to avoid the growth of bacteria or other micro-organisms.\nAfter 14 days of treatment, place the fish briefly in fresh water to remove the D-glucose outside the body prior to taking the blood glucose-level measurement.\n3. Measuring Blood Glucose Levels in Zebrafish\nCover the fish with ice for rapid euthanasia.\n\tNOTE: Do not use an overdose of tricaine, as this induces wide variations in blood glucose levels. Do not leave the fish in the ice for too long, as this will cause the blood to clot.\nWipe the fish with absorbent tissue paper to remove all water and to avoid any blood dilution during the blood glucose measurement.\nRemove an eye using dissecting forceps and wait until the eye cavity is filled with blood.\nPut a test strip on a glucometer and insert the strip into the eye cavity.\nMeasure the blood glucose levels.\n4. Analyzing Brain Cell Proliferation Following Hyperglycemia\nSolutions and buffers: requirements and preparation\nPrepare 1 L of 1x PBS by adding 100 mL of 10x PBS to 900 mL of distilled H2O (dH2O) and mix.\nPrepare 1x PBS with 0.2% detergent (PBS-T; see the table of materials).\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare 1 L of PBS-T, add 2 mL of detergent (see the Materials Table) to 1 L of PBS.\nPrepare an ethanol series (100% x 2; 95%; 85%; 70%; 50%, and 30%) and 0.85% NaCl.\nPrepare blocking buffer: PBS-T containing 0.5% to 1% milk powder.\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare 200 mL of blocking buffer, add 2 g of milk powder to 200 mL of PBST.\nPrepare antigen retrieval buffer, sodium citrate.",
    "NOTE: To prepare 1 L of sodium citrate buffer, add 2.94 g of sodium citrate trisodium salt dehydrate to 1 L of dH20. Adjust the pH to 6 prior to filling to 1 L.\nPrepare a 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS buffer, adding 4 g of paraformaldehyde to 100 mL of 1x PBS. Warm it under agitation at 58-60 °C until it dissolves completely.\nSample preparation for immunohistochemistry: fixation and dehydration\nAfter measuring the blood glucose level, separate the head from the body by cutting the head behind the gills.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, the brain can be directly extracted and frozen for other experiments, such as mRNA extraction.\nFix the heads overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS (PFA-PBS).\nThe next day, briefly wash the heads in PBS.\nDissect the brains carefully using a microscope. Rinse the fixed heads with PBS and use a needle to secure a head under a dissecting microscope. Remove the eyes and the top of the skull with forceps. Carefully extract the brain and place it in 1x PBS.\nSuccessively wash the fixed brains with 1x PBS for 30 min, 0.85% NaCl for 30 min, 70% EtOH/0.85% NaCl (v/v) for 15 min, 70% EtOH for 15 min (twice), 85% EtOH for 20 min, 95% EtOH for 20 min, and 100% EtOH for 20 min (twice). Incubate overnight in a final 100% EtOH solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Dehydrated brains can remain for several months in 100% EtOH at 4 °C before paraffin embedding.\nSample preparation for immunohistochemistry: tissue preparation for paraffin embedding\nPlace the brains in a small glass beaker.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use a plastic receptacle, as toluene can damage some plastics.\nRemove the ethanol and replace it with toluene, as the brains must be totally recovered by toluene. Perform two 30 min baths of toluene.",
    "Remove the toluene and place the brains in an embedding cassette. Put the closed cassette in melted paraffin series beakers at 58-60 °C (30 min in each paraffin beaker). Turn on the warming inclusion forceps. At the end of the paraffin baths, take out the cassette and pour some liquid paraffin into a mold.\nPour the melted paraffin into a mold and place the brain inside. Orient the brain using the warming inclusion forceps, using the anteroposterior orientation of the brain as a guide. Let the paraffin harden on the cooling part of the embedding machine.\nFor technical reasons, position the brains along the anteroposterior axis. After unmolding the paraffin block, crop it and fix it on a cassette, with the melted paraffin in the proper orientation to allow for transversal sectioning.\nInsert the paraffin block into the arm of the microtome. Cut 50 µm-thick sections until the brain sample level is reached. Trim the paraffin block to obtain a trapeze and adjust the sectioning thickness to 7 µm. Collect the paraffin ribbons using paintbrushes and place them on black paper. Cut them gently every 3 to 4 sections.\nPut a slide on a warming plate and cover it with dH2O water.\nGently position the cut ribbons on the water. Remove the water with absorbent tissue paper when the paraffin ribbons are sufficiently spread out/unfolded. Remove the last drops mechanically. Remove the water from the slides and let them dry for at least 3 h on the warming plate at around 30-40 °C.\nImmunohistochemistry procedure\nRemove the paraffin wax by placing sections in three containers of xylene for 7 min each.",
    "Rehydrate the sections by putting the slides in two containers of 100% EtOH for 2 min each, followed by baths of 95% EtOH, 85% EtOH, 70% EtOH, and 30% EtOH for 30 s each. Finally, briefly put the slides in dH2O and twice in PBS for 5 min each.\nPerform antigen retrieval by incubating the sections in citrate buffer in a microwave (2 min at 500 W) until the buffer starts to boil. Let the slides recover at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash three times in PBST, 5 min each, and block the sections for 45 min in PBST containing 1% milk. Incubate overnight with primary antibodies (e.g. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for proliferative cell staining; 1/100) diluted in blocking buffer (i.e. PBST, 1% milk).\nWash three times in PBST, 5 min each, and incubate the sections for 90 min with appropriate secondary antibodies (e.g. goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488; 1/200) diluted in blocking buffer and with DAPI (1/500).\nWash three times in PBST, 5 min each, and mount the slides with fluorescent mounting medium (see the table of materials).\nAnalyze the staining using an epifluorescence and/or confocal microscope.\nQuantify the brain cell proliferation on at least three successive brain sections of a region of interest in at least three distinct animals.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, brain embedding can be done in agarose to proceed to vibratome sectioning and free-floating immunohistochemistry, as previously described24.\nStudying the impact of hyperglycemia on brain repair mechanisms\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the investigation of brain repair under acute and chronic hyperglycemia can be performed after stab wound injury of the telencephalon, as previously described24,25,26. Briefly:\n\t\nAnesthetize adult zebrafish with tricaine.\nPlace the fish under a dissecting microscope with light.\nHold the fish with one hand.",
    "With the other hand, insert a 30 G syringe vertically through the skull into the medial region of the right telencephalic hemisphere.\nPlace the fish back into fresh fish water, D-glucose-supplemented water (111 mM), or control fish water. Allow the fish to survive for 7 days post-injury.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to step 4 for the rest of the procedure.\n5. Imaging the Biodistribution of Radiolabeled Molecules by PET/CT in Zebrafish: Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) to Analyze Glucose Metabolism\nPrepare a 50 µL syringe containing 20 MBq of a saline solution of [18F]-FDG.\nPlace the syringe behind the radiation protective screen.\nAnesthetize an adult zebrafish with tricaine.\nPlace the fish behind a radiation protective screen.\nInject [18F]-FDG into the intraperitoneal cavity. Wipe the injection site with a small piece of tissue paper to prevent the detection of residual [18F]-FDG that could leak out of the fish belly.\nUse a radioisotope calibrator to measure the remaining activity contained on the syringe and the tissue to calculate the exact injected dose.\nPlace the fish on a new, small piece of absorbent tissue soaked with tricaine and gently wrap it up. Place the fish with the absorbent tissue on the bed of the PET/CT imager.\nInsert the bed into the PET/CT imaging system and start the acquisition.\nProceed to conduct the PET/CT acquisition.\nAt the end of the procedure, place the fish back into a small amount of fresh fish water.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, after the [18F]-FDG injection, the fish can be put back into a small amount of fresh water for 10 min to 1 h to facilitate the diffusion of [18F]-FDG before anesthetizing the fish once again for PET/CT imaging.\nSubscription Required.
