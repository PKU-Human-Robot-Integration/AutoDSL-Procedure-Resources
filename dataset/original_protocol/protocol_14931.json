    "Note: All animal studies should be performed under approved institutional protocols and animal care guidelines.\n1. In Vivo CLI imaging BAT with 18F-FDG\n1.1 Background Imaging:\nBefore 18F-FDG injection, place four nude mice in an induction chamber that has been connected with isoflurane balanced with oxygen for 5 min to induce anesthesia. Then place the four anesthetized mice into the imaging apparatus.\nAcquire the background image with the following parameters: Open filter, f = 1, bin = 8, FOV = D, and exposure time = 120 sec, stage temperature = 37 °C.\n1.2 BAT Imaging with 18F-FGD:\nInject the anesthetized mice with 280 µCi of 18F-FDG in PBS intravenously in the tail vein. After the injection, return the mice to a cage equipped with food and water.\n\tNote: It is necessary to intravenously inject 18F-FDG to achieve a decent contrast around BAT area. Only a very weak contrast can be seen with the same amount of 18F-FDG if an intraperitoneal injection is used.\nAcquire CLI images at 30, 60, and 120 min after 18F-FDG injection with the same parameters as background imaging (step 1.1.2). For each imaging session, allow 5 min for the anesthesia reinduction.\nTo quantify the signal to noise ratio (S/N), use the imaging software interface to draw two equal sized ellipse ROIs over the interscapular BAT and an area adjacent to the BAT (reference area) (Figure 1b).\n1.3 Validation of the CLI Source:\nAnesthetize four mice and inject the mice with 280 µCi of 18F-FDG intravenously.\nSacrifice the mice 60 min after the injection of 18F-FDG by injection of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP). Carefully remove the skin from the interscapular area. Image all of the mice with the same parameters as above (1.1.2), at the same time (Figure 2a).",
    "Carefully remove the interscapular white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT, and then image the dissected mice with the same parameters (Figure 2b).\nFrom the CLI images, calculate the contribution from BAT by using two ROIs with the following equation: R(BAT) = (CLIa-CLIb)(BAT)/(CLIa-CLIb)(BAT-removed), where ROIa is for the interscapular area and ROIb is for the reference area (Figure 2b).\n2. BAT Imaging Application\n2.1 Monitoring Activation with NE\nDivide nude mice into two groups (n = 4 each).\nInject one group with norepinephrine (NE) (50 µl, 10mM) intraperitoneally. Use the second group as a non-activated control. After 30 min, anesthetize both groups with isoflurane for 5 min, and then intravenously inject each mouse with 18F-FDG (220 µCi).\n\tNote: The intraperitoneal injection of NE should be 30 min before 18F-FDG injection to avoid dramatically agitating the mice.\nImage the mice 60 min after 18F-FDG injection using the same parameters as the above protocols.\n2.2 Monitoring Activation Under Cold Exposure\nMeasure the body temperatures of the mice in the cold room with a rectal thermometer. Temperatures should be about 30 °C.\nImage the mice 60 min after 18F-FDG injection by using the same imaging parameters as the above protocols. Use mice that are kept at room temperature (25 °C) as the controls, and image them with the same.\nFor a cold exposure study, place the mice in a cold room (4 °C) for 4 hr before 18F-FDG injection and return the mice to the cold room after each imaging session and after recovering from anesthesia.\nparameters as above.\n2.3 Monitoring Deactivation of BAT Under Long Anesthesia\nFor long anesthesia (60 - 70 min), inject mice intraperitoneally with ketamine/xylazine and keep them under anesthesia for 60 - 70 min at room temperature.",
    "Once the mice are anesthetized, inject 18F-FDG (220 µCi) intravenously via the tail vein.\nImage the mice 60 min after 18F-FDG injection by using the same parameters as the above protocols.\n3. Spectral Unmixing and Multispectral Cerenkov Luminescence Tomography Studies\nAnesthetize a mouse for 5 min, and then inject 300 µCi 18F-FDG intravenously. Acquire multispectral images 60 min after 18F-FDG injection from the animal’s dorsal side with the following parameters: f = 1, bin = 16, acquisition time = 300 sec per filter, emission filters = 580, 600, 620, 640, 660 and 680 nm.\nConduct spectral unmixing with Living Imaging 4.3.1 software and select two components (BAT and unspecific signals) and automatic unmixing (Figure 4).\nConduct the 3D reconstruction according to the method reported by Kuo et al. 28,43. Incorporate the Cerenkov emission spectrum into the diffuse light propagation model, apply Tikhonov regularization in the NNLS (nonnegative least squares) optimization of the residuals, and generate the surface tomography (which is used for 3D image coregistration) from the structure light imaging (Figure 5).\n\tNote: For multispectral CLI spectral unmixing and tomography, at least 5 images with different filters are needed."
