    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe above section describes best practices for maintaining and expanding healthy primed hPSC colonies using visual inspection and culling, as needed, until the time of seeding for differentiation experiments. The following step-by-step method details the directed differentiation of primed hPSCs into each of the three primary germ lineages using chemically defined nutrient-balanced media formulations (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1847-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Workflow timeline schematic\nIllustration of a primed hPSC-derived differentiation timeline for each germ lineage. Primed hPSCs should be seeded two days (48 h) prior to the start of differentiation. Culture media must be changed every day (24 h). The differentiation endpoint for endoderm is three days (72 h) post-start of differentiation, whereas the endpoint for mesoderm and ectoderm differentiation is five days (120 h) post-start of differentiation. The method of differentiated cell harvesting depends on downstream applications.\nCritical: No antibiotics are present or used in hPSC culture medium. All steps must be performed under sterile conditions. Take extra caution in all steps by using sterile reagents and filtration. If any cloudiness or opaqueness appear in culture media, or when colonies are dying in suspension, throw the stock away and start with new cells, as contamination is likely to have occurred.\nSeeding hPSCs for differentiation\nTiming: 1–1.5 h, two days prior to differentiation",
    "This section covers harvesting and single cell seeding of primed hPSCs for directed differentiation experiments. Typically, we discard hPSCs that have exceeded 10 passages post-thawing and start from another cryovial from a well-characterized working bank (Gu et al., 2016b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Hong et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Kuilman et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). We encourage users to test cells for mycoplasma contamination using standard kits of choice, such as the Lonza MycoAlert Kit, prior to starting the differentiation procedure. Additionally, take care to visually inspect the spent culture media for any cloudiness or opaqueness, as this may indicate bacterial or fungal contamination. Users should routinely check stock hPSC cells for the presence of pluripotency and absence of differentiation biomarkers using flow cytometry or RT-qPCR to ensure starting cell populations are of high quality (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Growth and expansion of hPSC colonies to 70%–80% confluency, which yields ∼2.0–3.0 × 106 cells in the 6-well microplate format, is optimal for harvest and seeding of growing colonies at the start of the differentiation procedure. The protocol below provides detailed procedures for harvesting hPSCs from a 6-well tissue culture-treated polystyrene microplate and seeding into 12-well plates. These steps can be adapted to other plating formats by adjusting the numbers of cells or colonies and media volumes accordingly.\nPrepare 12-well tissue culture-treated polystyrene microplates coated with Corning Matrigel® basement membrane matrix (as described in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\nIdentify and remove regions of differentiation using aspiration (as described in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) in the stock 6-well hPSC culture plate before harvesting.\nRemove the media from the 6-well hPSC culture plate by aspiration.\nWash hPSCs gently to not disrupt colonies with 1 mL 1× DPBS. Aspirate to remove the 1× DPBS.",
    "Add 1 mL/well of Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent to hPSC colonies and incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 10 min.\nAdd 1 mL/well of 37°C DMEM/F-12 media to dilute out Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent.\nUse a cell scraper to gently scrape colonies and cells off the bottom of the 6-well culture plate and collect combined contents of the plate into a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Ensure they are dissociated into single cells by pipetting against the surface of each well with a P1000 3× before collecting into a 50 mL conical tube.\nCount the number of hPSCs harvested for use with a hemocytometer.\nOptional: Automated cell counters are acceptable, but we recommend validating automated counting machines using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the harvested hPSCs at 450× g for 5 min.\nAspirate media gently to avoid disrupting the cell pellet.\nResuspend the hPSCs in 1 mL of 37°C mTeSR(+) containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632.\nCritical: It is critical to add ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, into the media because it prevents apoptosis induced by single cell dissociation of hPSC colonies. Otherwise, the survival of hPSCs post-seeding will be markedly reduced (Kurosawa, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCalculate the volume required to plate primed hPSCs in mTeSR(+) media with 10 μM Y-27632 at 6.5 × 104 cells/cm2 final concentration.\nAspirate the media off the coated 6-well tissue culture-treated polystyrene microplate.\nPlace 1 mL/well of hPSCs in mTeSR(+) media with 10 μM Y-27632 into Matrigel®-coated 12-well tissue culture-treated polystyrene microplates.\nCritical: Make sure that hPSCs are evenly distributed.\nIncubate the seeded microplate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 24 h.\n24 h post-plating (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), gently wash the primed hPSCs with 1 mL 1× DPBS without calcium or magnesium. Aspirate the 1× DPBS gently.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1847-Fig3.jpg",

In case of over-confluence (>85%), repeat the seeding as efficacy of differentiation will be decreased.\nMaking chemically defined, nutrient-balanced media for tri-lineage differentiation\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This section details the preparation of media for chemically defined, nutrient-balanced directed differentiation of primed hPSCs into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm lineages. Of note, the protocol endpoint for endoderm is three days (72 h) post-start of differentiation, whereas the endpoint for mesoderm and ectoderm differentiation is five days (120 h) post-start of differentiation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Additionally, be sure to exclude insulin, transferrin, and chemically defined lipid concentrate from the base media for ectoderm differentiated cells because B-27 and N2 supplements already contain these factors. The Base Media Preparation Tables provided below note this difference. These cytokine combinations have been optimized and adapted from previous studies (Chambers et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Loh et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13], 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Here, we also include formulation instructions for Gln-free medium as an example; however, this protocol for chemically defined, nutrient-balanced media is non-limiting, meaning that it can be adjusted for any nutrient deprivation study.\nMake mesoderm/endoderm or ectoderm base media according to the provided recipes for lineage differentiation of choice in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nA range of experimental manipulations can be made by modifying DMEM/F12 nutrient composition. Additionally, we also provide an example for Gln-free base media in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. In this instance, DMEM/F12 no Gln is used and GlutaMAX was excluded.\nNote: We recommend first sterile filtering base media and then adding sterile cytokines to generate differentiation media because lineage-inducing cytokines could stick to the filter membrane, affecting their final concentrations, and causing undesirable reduction or variability in hPSC differentiation within or between experiments.\nOptional: A substitute for GlutaMAX is L-Gln. However, L-Gln is not stable at 4°C and is therefore not recommended.\nSterilize each final media preparation using a 0.22-micron polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filter.\nPause point: At this step, base media preparations can be stored at 4°C for use within two weeks.",
    "Critical: Sterile, non-expired cytokines that have not undergone multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be added immediately prior to the start of each experiment to ensure efficacy.\nAt the start of differentiation (D0) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), add sterile lineage-inducing cytokines to each respective base media for each desired indication (Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1847_9.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1847_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1847_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1847_12.csv\nBelow, we provide tables to guide the addition of cytokines to the different types of base media for lineage-specific differentiations.\nDilute stock cytokine solutions using sterile techniques and store according to the manufacturers’ instructions (varies).\nCritical: Prepare aliquots of stock cytokine solutions to extend storage life and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles that can reduce potency.\nNote: Be careful because each day of differentiation may require the addition of different cytokine combinations to enhance the success of this protocol. See specific schedules in the tables, below.\nDirected differentiation of hPSCs to primary germ lineages\nTiming: 30 min–1 h per day\nThis section provides instructions for the execution of hPSC directed differentiation into each of the three germ lineages, starting with the transition of mTeSR(+) hPSC maintenance cultures to lineage-specific differentiation media.\nRemove spent mTeSR(+) maintenance media from wells and wash the hPSC colonies gently with 20°C 1× DPBS w/o calcium & magnesium.\nAdd 1 mL/well (∼263 μL/cm2) of 37°C appropriate differentiation media.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nEvery 24 h, repeat gentle washing and media changes according to the cytokine schedule above (Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]) until hPSCs have committed to a directed lineage (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1847-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
