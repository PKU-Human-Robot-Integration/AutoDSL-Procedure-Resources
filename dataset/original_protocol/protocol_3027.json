    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBacterial subculture\nTiming: 5 min, start 3 h before infection time.\nSubculture the bacteria until it reaches an optical density (OD600) of 2, optimal for cell infection.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDilute 150 μL of the overnight culture in 5 mL of LB in a 50 mL centrifuge tube supplemented with the adequate antibiotic, if any.\nGrow the bacteria for 3 h in an incubator with an orbital shaker at 37°C, 220 rpm.\nAgar bottom layer\nTiming: 30 min\nThe soft agar experiment will consist of 2 layers of soft agar. A 0.7% bottom layer, which will prevent the cells from sinking to the bottom of the well, and a top layer of 0.45%, which contains the cells. The bottom layer should be prepared during the bacterial subculture time.\nWarm up solutions to reach a stable temperature\nPre-heat growth medium (DMEM-; DMEM+FBS+Gent100 and DMEM+FBS+Gent10) to 37°C.\nMelt 3% soft agar solution using a microwave. Swirl the solution every 10–20 s to avoid clumps (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C). Avoid boiling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2775-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Melting the 3% soft agar solution\n(A) 3% soft agar solution before melting.\n(B) 3% soft agar solution checked during melting.\n(C) 3% soft agar solution fully melted.\n(D) ThermoMixer used to maintain the 3% soft agar solution at 42°C. Related to Step 2.\nLet the 3% soft agar solution cool down using a 42°C water bath or a ThermoMixer with 300 rpm agitation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPrepare the 0.7% agar bottom layer by diluting 5 mL of the 3% soft agar solution in 16.5 mL of DMEM+FBS+Gent10. Mix gently by pipetting up and down until the solution is homogeneous. Avoid bubbles as much as possible. Do not invert the tube. Act fast as the solution will start solidifying within a few min at RT.",
    "Directly pour 3 mL of the mix into each well of a 6-well plate. The bottom of each well should be completely covered.\nCritical: Avoid air bubbles by gently pouring the solution by applying the tip of the pipette to the wall of the well. Fill the pipette with 1 extra mL to avoid completely emptying the pipette when filling the well. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: Use 3 wells per condition. Here 2 conditions (infected and non-infected cells) are compared so a complete 6-well plate is used.\nCarefully transfer the 6-well plate to a flat shelf of a fridge at 4°C.\nLet the plate cool down for 20 min until the bottom layer is fully solidified. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer the plate into the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, with internal humidity of circa 90%.\nNote: Keeping similar timing for bacterial growth will increase experimental reproducibility.\nBacterial infection\nTiming: 4 h\nAt the end of the 3 h bacterial subculture, measure the concentration of bacteria.\nFill a cuvette with 1 mL LB medium.\nBlank the spectrophotometer.\nFill a cuvette with 200 μL of the bacterial subculture in 800 μL of LB medium (volume final 1000 μL, dilution 1:5).\nSeal the cuvette with parafilm and measure the OD600. The 1:5 dilution should have an OD600 of circa 0.4, corresponding to the late log phase of the bacterial growth. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer 1 mL of the bacterial subculture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin down for 1 min at 9000 g.\nAspirate the supernatant (here LB).\nNote: Salmonella pellets can easily detach within a few min. Act fast and leave a safe volume above the pellet to avoid discarding bacteria.\nWash the bacteria with 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM-.\nSpin down for 1 min at 9000 g.\nAspirate the supernatant (here DMEM-).",
    "Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM-.\nPrepare the infection mix by diluting the bacteria in DMEM- according to the OD600 measured and the MOI wanted. Here is a detailed example of calculations:\nWe expect a cell confluency of circa 90%, corresponding to 2 × 105 cells per well. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. For an MOI of 20, 4 × 106 bacteria should be added per well.\nThe ideal volume of infection mix to add per well is 0.5 mL. This allows covering the whole well while using a minimal volume to facilitate bacteria-cell interactions. To add 4 × 106 bacteria to the cells within a volume of 0.5 mL, the bacteria concentration should be 2 × 4 × 106 = 8 × 106 bacteria/mL.\nTo infect 2 wells, prepare enough volume for the number of wells + 0.150 mL to account for loss during pipetting. Here the volume is 2 × 0.5 mL + 0.150 mL extra = 1.150 mL.\nFor an OD600 of 2 and assuming a conversion factor OD600 to CFU of 6.5 × 108, the concentration of bacteria in the subculture is 2 × 6.5 × 108 = 1.3 × 109 bacteria/mL.\nThus, 1.150 mL of “infection mix” can be prepared by diluting 7 μL of washed bacterial subculture into 1.143 mL of DMEM-.\nCritical: The conversion factor from OD600 to CFU to use should be established in each lab during spectrophotometer calibration.\nTake the 12-well plate containing the cells from the incubator.\nRemove the cell medium and add 0.5 mL of infection mix to the cells of the “infected” conditions and 0.5 mL DMEM- to the cells of the “non-infected” condition.\nPut the cells back in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nWash the cells twice with pre-warmed DMEM-.",
    "Add 1 mL of pre-warmed DMEM+FBS+Gent100 per well.\nPut the cells back in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nNote: The washes remove most of the extracellular bacteria. The remaining extracellular bacteria attached to the cells will be killed by gentamicin. As gentamicin is not cell permeable, the intracellular bacteria are not affected by the gentamicin treatment.\nOptional: In case the S. Typhimurium strain expresses a fluorophore, the efficiency of bacteria infection can be observed on a (bench-top) fluorescence microscope, if available.\nAspirate the medium and replace it with 1 mL pre-warmed DMEM+FBS+Gent10.\nNote: The concentration of gentamicin is decreased after 1 h to avoid the accumulation of intracellular gentamicin (especially by endocytosis) that could affect intracellular bacteria.\nPut the cells back in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 h.\nAgar top layer\nTiming: 30 min, followed by 2–3 weeks of incubation\nPrepare the 0.45% agar top layer containing the cells.\nCritical: Make sure that all media are at 37°C and remelt the 3% soft agar solution if it is no longer fully liquid (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-1C). Keep the 3% soft agar solution at 40°C–42°C using a water bath or a ThermoMixer with 300 rpm agitation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCollect the cells from the 12-well plate:\nRemove the medium from each well.\nGently wash each well with 1 mL of PBS.\nRemove PBS.\nAdd 200 μL of trypsin per well.\nIncubate the cells for 5 min at 37°C.\nVerify that cells are ready to detach using a bench microscope.\nAdd 800 μL of DMEM+FBS per well to stop the action of trypsin.\nResuspend cells and pull 2 wells corresponding to 1 condition in one 15 mL centrifuge tube (so in total 2 mL per tube).\nSpin down at 300 g for 4 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend every pellet in 1 mL of DMEM+FBS+Gent10.\nCount the cells for each condition.\nNote: Various cell counting methods exist. Cells can be counted manually or automatically using counting chambers or automated cell counters, respectively. While automated cell counting is less time-consuming, manual counting is less expensive.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Both types of cell counting methods can be used for this step.\nFor each condition, transfer 2 × 105 cells in a new 15 mL centrifuge tube and complete the volume to 6.8 mL with DMEM+FBS+Gent10. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd 1.2 mL of melted 3% soft agar to one of the cell-containing centrifuge tubes resulting in a final agar concentration of 0.45% and a final volume of 8 mL.\nCritical: Perform Steps 28–32 fully for one condition before moving to the next. Adding soft agar to all samples at once would risk agar solidification before pouring.\nCritical: The 3% soft agar solution should be fully melted but not too hot to avoid damaging the cells. Ideally, the solution should be maintained around 40°C–42°C using a water bath or a ThermoMixer.\nUsing a 5 mL pipette, take 2.5 mL of the cell and agar-containing solution (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPass the cells through a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell-strainer cap (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCollect the solution in the round-bottom tube and pass it through a second cell strainer cap. This will avoid cell clumping. Use the pipetboy gently to avoid bubbles (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPour 2 mL of the solution on the top of the agar bottom layer. Thus 5 × 104 cells are seeded per well (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Troubleshooting 6–7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRepeat Steps 29–32 twice more starting from the same cell and agar-containing tube to fill 3 wells of the 6-well plate per condition.",
    "Critical: The addition of melted soft-agar to the cell suspension and the pouring of the solution are technically challenging steps that can introduce important variations to the results. Thus, it is recommended to use technical triplicates.\nRepeat Steps 28–33 with the next condition.\nCarefully transfer the 6-well plate to a flat shelf of a fridge at 4°C.\nLet the plate cool down for 20 min until the top layer is fully solidified. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nFill the spaces between the wells with sterile water or PBS to prevent the fast drying of the agar gel.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2–3 weeks (or until cell colonies are visible). Troubleshooting 9–10[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods Video S1. Filtering and deposition of the top agar layer, related to Steps 29–32\n    \nImage acquisition of the plate\nTiming: 1 h\nWhen small cell colonies are visible, acquire the 6-well plate using the GelCount device and the GelCount Software.\nNote: In case a GelCount device is not available, manual counting of the colonies using a bench microscope can be performed. Of note, manual counting is more time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective than automated detection.\nCritical: cell colonies should be counted before they grow too much and overlap. Check the plate regularly with a cell culture microscope to see if cell colonies start forming (several cells attached together are considered as a forming colony).\nTurn on the GelCount device using the back on/off button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The plate tray is then ejected from the device (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2775-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plate acquisition with the GelCounter device\n(A) GelCounter device, red arrow: insert button.\n(B) 6-well plate tray.\n(C) Screenshot of the GelCounter software used for image acquisition. Related to Steps 39–49.\nExtract the 6-well plate tray (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and place it under the hood.",
    "On the computer connected to the GelCount device, start the GelCount software.\nClick the “Setup wizard” button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, circle 1), and select a 6-well plate format and a resolution of 2400 dpi. Troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nWipe the bottom of the 6-well plate(s) with 70% ethanol to remove dust. Troubleshooting 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlace the 6-well plate(s) within the tray and take a picture of the plate positions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTake off the cap of the 6-well plate(s).\nNote: The acquisition of the colony on the GelCount device will likely compromise the sterility of the culture. However, if the plate needs to be acquired several times, a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as Primocin at 100 μg/mL can be spread over the agar top layer to prevent microbial contamination.\nInsert the tray with the plate within the GelCount device and press the central button to close the device (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, red arrow).\nOn the GelCount software, select the number of plates to acquire (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, circle 2).\nPress “acquire only” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, circle 3). The acquisition will take around 5–10 min per plate.\nSave the files (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, circle 4).\nNote: The quantitative analysis of the cell colonies can be done at a later time on any off-line computer equipped with the GelCount software (i.e., it is not required to use the computer connected to the GelCount device).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods Video S2.
