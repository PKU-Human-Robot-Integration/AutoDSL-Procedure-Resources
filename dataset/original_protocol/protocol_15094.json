    "This new model is an adaptation of a previously published organotypic hippocampal brain slice approach9-12. Modifications and additions were introduced to optimize the cancer cell-brain tissue interactions and to guarantee reproducibility. The study was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. Animals were treated carefully according to the guidelines for animal care at the University Medicine Göttingen. The organotypic brain slice coculture can be subdivided into two steps. Step one is the preparation of the organotypic brain slice. Step two comprises the tumor cell preparation and deposition in the coculture model.\n1. Organotypic Brain Slice\nPrepare the dissection medium consisting of minimum essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 4.5 mg/ml of glucose.\nDecapitate the mice from any mouse strain between postnatal day six and eight (P6-8).\nRemove the brain rapidly from the skull under aseptic conditions and transfer it to ice-cold dissection medium.\nRemove the frontal pole and the cerebellum from the whole brain section.\nFix and stabilize the brain on a stage with cryo glue and 5% agarose.\nSlice the brain sections horizontally to a 350 μm thickness by using a vibratome.\nCollect four to six whole brain slices from a single mouse brain, depending on the species and age.\nPrepare the culture medium consisting of 50% MEM, 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), 25% normal horse serum (NHS), 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, Munich, Germany), and 4.5 mg/ml glucose.\nPut each organotypic brain slice on a 0.4 μm polycarbonate transwell membrane insert in a six-well plate with 1 ml of cultivation medium in the lower well.\nCulture organotypic brain slices overnight in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C incubator.\n2. The Slice Coculture Model",
    "Embed 105 of GFP-transfected tumor or other cells (e.g. MCF-7-GFP cells) in 20 μl gel matrix, consisting of 15% RPMI medium and 85% ECM gel.\nPlace the MCF-7- gel matrix mix into a sterile metallic spacer (3.8 mm diameter) directly adjacent to the cortical region of the organotypic brain slice and incubate for 2 hr.\nRemove the spacer and allow the 3D tumor spheroid to coculture with the organotypic slice for 24-96 hr.\nChange the culture medium every other day.\n3. Immunofluorescence Staining of Astrocytes and Microglial in the Organotypic Brain Slice Coculture\nFix the organotypic brain slice coculture with 4% paraformaldehyde for 8 hr at 4 °C.\nWash the slice coculture with PBST (PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100) for 5 min.\nBlock the samples with normal goat serum in PBST (1:20) at room temperature for 1 hr.\nStain the astrocytes by incubating the brain slice coculture with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein monoclonal antibody (GFAP, 1:200 in PBST) for 36 hr at 4 °C followed by goat anti-mouse-TRITC (1:100 in PBST) staining for 1 hr at room temperature.\nWash the samples with PBST three times for 5 min. \nStain the microglial cells with ILB4-Alexa Fluor 647 (1:100 in PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature.\nCounterstain the brain slice coculture with DAPI (1:1,000) for 3 min at room temperature.\nMount and coverslip the brain slice coculture with DAKO fluorescent mounting medium.\nEvaluate the grade of tumor invasion based on the following scoring system: 0 = none of the cells; + < 1/3; ++ = 1/3 - 2/3; +++ ≥ 2/3 of the invaded cells (first measure the length of the contact section between the tumor plug and slice, then measure the fraction of contact detectable by the invading cells).\n4. Live Imaging of the Interaction between Glial and Tumor Cells",
    "Perform the experiment under a Leica inverted DMI 6000B microscope at 10X magnification lens and a Leica DFC 350 FX CCD camera."
