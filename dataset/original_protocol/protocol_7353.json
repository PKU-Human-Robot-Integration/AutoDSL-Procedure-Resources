  "procedures": [
    "The procedure below outlines three main steps: (A) bead preparation, (B) protein–RNA binding reactions, and (C) streptavidin–biotin pull-down and detection. This procedure was originally applied to study the binding affinity of the interaction between Nab3 RRM and a biotinylated small nucleolar RNA (e.g., snR47) probe (Lee et al., 2020). If this procedure is to be used with other protein–RNA interactions, then we recommend taking into consideration how variables (e.g., RNA probe length, RNA structure, buffer conditions, temperature, etc.) may affect the RNA–protein interaction and adjust accordingly (see Notes 2 and 4). Further, the protein source here is the recombinant His-tagged Nab3 RRM, expressed and purified from E. coli. A pure protein source is preferred if obtaining binding affinity measurements is desired (see Note 2).Bead preparation Cut off the end (2–3 mm on average) of a P200 tip and transfer 150 μL (i.e., 75 μL dry bead volume) of streptavidin-agarose to an Eppendorf tube (see Note 3).Centrifuge beads at 500 × g for 2 min and discard the supernatant (see Note 5).Wash with 1 mL of wash buffer for 5 min with end-to-end rotation.Spin down beads at 500 × g for 2 min and discard the supernatant.Repeat steps A3–A4 twice.Add 300 μL of wash buffer containing 5% BSA to the beads and incubate for 4 h with end-to-end rotation.Spin down beads at 500 × g for 2 min and discard supernatant.Wash with 500 μL of wash buffer for 5 min with end-to-end rotation.Spin down beads at 500 × g for 2 min and discard supernatant.Repeat steps A8–A9 five times but retain the supernatant of the fifth wash for a Bradford assay.",
    "In triplicates, add 10 μL of wash buffer (as a blank) or the supernatant retained in the previous step to 190 μL of diluted Bradford reagent in a 96-well microplate and measure absorbance at 595 nm.Proceed to step A13 if the supernatant is indistinguishable from the blank. If not, repeat steps A8–A9 until this result is obtained.Resuspend beads in 260 μL of wash buffer.Distribute 20 μL of beads (approximately 5 μL dry bead volume) into individual PCR tubes using a P200 tip with the end cut off.Keep the prepared bead suspension at 4 °C or on ice until needed.Protein–RNA binding reactions Remove RNA probe, protein stock, and protein storage buffer from -80 °C and leave to thaw on ice.Prepare binding reactions in PCR tubes as 10 μL reactions according to Table 1. Adjust volumes to achieve desired protein or RNA concentrations.Table 1. Protein–RNA binding reactions. The example below shows an initial experimental setup for preparing binding reactions with a fixed RNA probe concentration of 25 μM, varying protein concentration from 1 to 50 μM, and reaction controls.table:",

    "Incubate in a thermocycler for 30 min at 15 °C.Place the reactions on ice and immediately proceed to Section C.Streptavidin–biotin pull-down and detection Note: Unless otherwise stated, all centrifugations should occur on the mini centrifuge (2,200 × g) at room temperature. Transfer each binding reaction or control to a separate PCR tube containing prepared beads.Incubate at 4 °C for 2 h with end-to-end rotation.Spin down beads for 2 min and discard the supernatant.Wash beads with 100 μL of wash buffer for 5 min with end-to-end rotation.Repeat step C3.Repeat steps C4–C5 four times.Add 20 μL of Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol to elute the bound protein.Mix and heat tubes in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 5 min.Spin down beads for 2 min.Load the entire sample (supernatant) on a standard SDS-PAGE gel (here, a 17% gel was used, which is specific for the recombinant protein of interest due to its small size; see Notes 6 and 7).Run the gel at 120 V for approximately 2 h (until the dye front reaches the bottom).Transfer proteins onto a PVDF membrane at 180 mA for 2 h.Block membrane in blocking buffer for 1 h.Wash membrane five times for 5 min with TBST (see Recipes).Incubate membrane with appropriate antibody or probe (HRP-conjugated HisProbe) for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C.Wash membrane five times for 5 min with TBST.Image membrane by standard chemiluminescent detection with ECL substrate.Representative data imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4560/bioprotoc-12-23-4560-g001.jpgFigure 1.
