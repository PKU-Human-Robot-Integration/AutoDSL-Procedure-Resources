Initial dissection of the inner ear\n(A) After hemisecting the skull, the brain is removed.\n(B and C) (B) The portion of the skull containing the inner ear is extracted and (C) transferred to a dissection dish containing dissection medium.\n(D) The inner ear is extracted from the surrounding bone.\n(E) The stapes is removed from the oval window (if still present).\n(F) The inner ear is transferred to a plate containing 4% PFA fixative using a small spoon.\n(G–I) (G) A hole is made at the apex of the cochlea and (H) fixative is perfused through the round and (I) oval windows using a needle and syringe.\n(J and K) (J) The cochlea is incubated in fixative for 30 min before (K) being transferred to PBS. Graphics of the inner ear were adapted with permission from Shutterstock.\nDiscard the hemisected brain and remove the portion of the temporal bone of the skull containing the cochlea and vestibule (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nImmediately place the bone containing the cochlea and vestibule into 25°C dissection buffer in a 35-mm dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Critical: Make sure that the osmolarity of the dissection buffer is at physiological levels as it can affect the tissue integrity.\nNote: The dissection buffer is stored at 4°C once opened and used at 25°C for the procedure.\nFor a demonstration of steps 6 and 7, see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nUnder the stereoscope, gently detach along the outer edges of the cochlea and vestibule with #5 forceps to extract the organs from the surrounding bone (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTrim away additional tissue and (if still attached) remove the stapes from the oval window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nUsing a small spoon, transfer the cochlea to a 35-mm dish containing 4% PFA diluted in dissection buffer at 25°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCritical: During dissection and in all steps, great care must be provided to ensure that samples always stay immersed in liquid. This is particularly important for the maintenance of the tip links, as even brief moments in contact with air can cause them to break. (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nNote: For mice younger than P5, it may be possible to dissect the full organ of Corti very quickly and immerse it directly in fixative, rather than perfusing through the cochlea as described in steps 9 and 10. If a fast dissection is performed, skip ahead to step 11.\nFor a demonstration of steps 9 and 10, see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nOpen a small hole in the apex of the cochlea (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nUsing a 1-mL syringe with a 26G × ½ needle, gently flush 0.5 mL fixative (25°C) through the oval window, and 0.5 mL fixative through the round window (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H and 2I).\nNote: A flow of fixative out of the hole in the apex of the cochlea should be visible. Fixative is perfused at a rate of approximately 0.1 mL/sec.",
    "Using a small spoon, transfer the cochlea to a 2-mL tube containing 1.5 mL of fixative.\nIncubate in fixative at 25°C for 30 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nUsing a spoon, transfer the fixed cochlea to a 2-mL tube containing 1.5 mL of PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nPause point: It is best practice to perform the immunostaining right after the tissue fixation. It is possible to store the tissue in PBS for a maximum of one to two days; however, this might affect the antigenicity.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

Cochlear perfusion with PFA (related to steps 9 and 10)\nStep 2: Fine dissection of the organ of Corti\nTiming: 10–20 min depending on the mouse age\nExcising the organ of Corti from the cochlear bone and removing the tectorial membrane, Reissner’s membrane, and the stria vascularis allows the whole tissue to be mounted for clear imaging of the hair bundle.\nFor a demonstration of steps 14–19 at postnatal day 6, see Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nFor a demonstration of steps 14–19 at postnatal day 21, see Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nPlace the inner ear in a dish containing PBS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1685-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fine dissection of the inner ear\n(A) The inner ear (in this example, P6) is placed in a fresh plate containing PBS.\n(B and B′) The cochlear bone is chipped away, starting from the apex of the cochlea and working toward the base.\n(C, C′, and D′) The stria vascularis is peeled away from the organ of Corti, starting from the apex.\n(D, E, and E′) Reissner’s membrane, which sits above the organ of Corti, is removed.",
    "(F and F′) The tectorial membrane is removed, allowing direct access to the hair bundles at the apical surface of the hair cells.\n(G, H, and H′) (G) The organ of Corti is separated from the central cochlear bone, known as the modiolus, resulting in (H and H′) the fully dissected organ of Corti. Graphics of the inner ear were adapted with permission from Shutterstock.\nStarting at the hole in the apex of the cochlea, gently remove the outer bone along the cochlear length with #5 forceps (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nCrack along the center of the spirals, avoiding the areas where the stria abuts the bone.\nOnce a hole has been opened along the cochlea, slowly chip away at the remaining bone to reveal the stria.\nNote: If the vestibule is still connected to the cochlea, it is an ideal place to grip with forceps to restrain the organ for dissection.\nAgain, starting at the apical point, slowly remove the stria vascularis (the outermost tissue forming a partial wall around the organ of Corti) using fine #55 forceps.\nNote: For P6 and younger mice, the whole stria can often easily be removed in one attempt, spiraling down the organ. For older mice, extreme care must be taken in trimming below the apical region (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nRemove Reissner’s membrane (a thin, flat membrane that juts out above the organ of Corti) using #55 forceps.\nNote: Reissner’s membrane must often be removed in multiple steps along the cochlea (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nRemove the tectorial membrane (a nearly invisible membrane that sits closely on top of the hair cells) using #55 forceps (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3F′).",
    "Note: The tectorial membrane is translucent and often very difficult to see. For mice at P11 or older, it can be seen when looking at the organ of Corti from the side. For younger mice, the tectorial membrane might come off in pieces and might be difficult to see unless it is actively being removed. In either case, it is best to gently grab the tectorial membrane using fine (#55) forceps at the location where it is expected to be (above the hair cells). Once the membrane has been grabbed, pull it away from the tissue and it should become visible as it unrolls. By P11, it should be possible to remove nearly the whole tectorial membrane in one attempt.\nUsing forceps, remove the organ of Corti from the central bone spire known as the modiolus by gently puncturing or tearing the tissue between the organ and the bone.\nNote: The organ of Corti should easily be released from the modiolus when dissecting. (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, 3H, and 3H′). Alternatively, the organ can be left on the modiolus during staining for ease of handling.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Fine dissection of the organ of Corti (related to steps 14–19)—Postnatal day 6\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Fine dissection of the organ of Corti (related to steps 14–19)—Postnatal day 21\nStep 3: Immunostaining and mounting\nTiming: 24 h\nThe steps for hair bundle immunostaining include permeabilizing (opening pores in the membrane), blocking (preventing nonspecific antibody binding), primary antibody incubation (targeting the protein of interest), secondary antibody incubation (providing immunofluorescence to the target of interest), phalloidin incubation (staining the actin filaments of the stereociliary cytoskeleton), and mounting the sample for ease of imaging.",
    "Note: Opening pores in the stereociliary membrane via permeabilization allows antibodies to access intracellular proteins. The tissue must be blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of antibodies. A low amount of mild detergent (Tween-20) is maintained in all solutions to reduce the surface tension on the sample which prevents it from adhering to surfaces.\nNote: Here, we stained the protein espin-1 with a commercially available antibody (Clone 31, BD Biosciences), which generates consistently specific and strong labeling in the hair bundle. Espin-1 is an actin-bundling protein located at the tips of the stereocilia. Although espin-1 staining varies during development, it is expressed at the stereocilia tips as early as P0 (Salles et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nUsing a small spoon, transfer the organ of Corti to a glass Micro-Test Staining Dish containing 200 μL permeabilization buffer (4% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1685-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Immunostaining the organ of Corti\n(A) To identify a protein of interest (in this case, espin-1), the tissue is first placed in a Micro-Test Staining Dish well containing PBS.\n(B) The PBS is removed, keeping a small drop to cover the tissue, and permeabilization buffer is added for 20 min at 25°C, shaking.\n(C) Permeabilization buffer is removed, and blocking buffer is added for 1 h at 25°C, shaking.\n(D) After discarding the blocking buffer, the tissue is incubated for 12–16 h at 4°C, shaking with buffer containing diluted primary antibodies.\n(E) The primary antibody solution is removed, and the tissue is washed with blocking buffer three times 5 min at 25°C, shaking.\n(F) After the last wash, buffer containing diluted fluorescent secondary antibodies is added for 1 h at 25°C, shaking.\n(G) Secondary antibody is discarded, and the tissue is washed with blocking buffer once for 5 min at 25°C, shaking.",
    "(H) Blocking buffer is removed, and buffer containing diluted fluorescently labeled phalloidin (to stain the actin core) is added for 20 min at 25°C, shaking.\nNote: The glass dishes described in this protocol are used because they do not strongly bind with antibodies and can be reused. Some plastics like polypropylene adsorb proteins including antibodies and could potentially decrease staining efficiency. However, if disposable plastic must be used, choose a plastic treated for low binding. In terms of tube shape, we suggest 2-mL tubes with pointed bottoms which allows easy visualization of the samples and requires smaller amounts of diluted antibody.\nNote: All reused materials, such as glass dishes, spoons, dissecting equipment, etc., are cleaned after each use with a thorough rinse with Milli-Q water.\nIncubate in permeabilization buffer for 20 min at 25°C with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker (60 rpm for this and all following shaking steps).\nRemove permeabilization buffer, leaving a small drop of buffer covering the sample.\nAdd 200 μL blocking buffer (4% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPause point: Blocking can be performed for longer periods, even for 12–36 h at 4°C. However, as different incubation times can affect the intensity of staining and/or the background, always use the same protocol to compare samples of different genotypes.\nRemove the blocking buffer, leaving a small drop of solution covering the sample.\nAdd 200 μL of dilution buffer (1% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) containing the diluted primary antibody (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "Note: The espin-1 staining in this protocol was performed at a 1:200 dilution. Multiple antibody dilutions should be tested to find the ideal condition when initializing a protocol (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section). Start with the dilution recommended by the manufacturer of your antibody of interest and test 2–3 times sequential higher dilutions.\nNote: Antibody staining of the protein of interest and phalloidin staining of the actin core of the stereocilia allow clear localization of hair bundle proteins.\nIncubate at 4°C for 12–16 h with gentle shaking.\nNote: Place the sample plate in a Western blot box or empty pipette tip box with a lid to prevent liquid evaporation during longer incubations. To saturate the air in the box with water and further limit evaporation, a Kimwipe dampened with distilled water can be placed in the bottom of the box below the Micro-Test Staining Dish. Finally, the box can be sealed with parafilm.\nRemove the primary antibody solution, leaving a small drop of solution covering the sample.\nWash 3 × 5 min with 200 μL dilution buffer at 25°C with gentle shaking (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nRemove the dilution buffer, leaving a small drop of solution covering the sample.\nAdd 200 μL of dilution buffer (1% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) containing the diluted secondary antibody (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: For the staining performed in this protocol, a 1:500 dilution of secondary antibody was used.\nIncubate at 25°C for 1 h, protected from light, with gentle shaking.\nNote: From this point on, the samples should be protected from light as much as possible to reduce photobleaching of the fluorophores. This can be done by placing the sample plate in a Western blot box and covering the samples with aluminum foil during the incubation steps until mounting.",
    "Wash 1 × 5 min with dilution buffer at 25°C with gentle shaking (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nRemove the dilution buffer, leaving a small drop of solution covering the sample.\nAdd 200 μL of dilution buffer (1% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) with diluted phalloidin (1:500 dilution of 6.6 μM solution, methanol reconstituted, or 1:1000 dilution of 66 μM solution, DMSO reconstituted) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nNote: DMSO reconstitution of phalloidin may be more stable for long-term storage. We have found excellent results with both solvents.\nIncubate at 25°C for 20 min, protected from light, with gentle shaking.\nNote: The intensity of phalloidin staining can be increased by extending the incubation time; however, this might result in oversaturated staining of the stereociliary actin core (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nWash 5 × 5 min with dilution buffer at 25°C with gentle shaking.\n(Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nRemove the organ of Corti from the modiolus if still attached.\nPerform final trims on the tissue including removing any remaining pieces of Reissner’s membrane.\nCut the tissue into “turns”, or curved portions of the organ that can lie flat on the slide without overlapping with themselves (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1685-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(F) In the direction of sound-induced force deflection for a large region of hair bundles, gently roll the coverslip onto the turn, and hold firmly in place for 10 s.\n(G) Absorb any excess mounting medium with a Kimwipe.\n(H) Seal the coverslip in place with fingernail polish to prevent movement while the mounting medium is hardening.\n(I and J) Close-up visualization of how rolling the coverslip in the direction of hair bundle deflection can cause hair bundles to lie flat in an optimal orientation to visualize all stereocilia. Note the ridge located on the surface of the epithelium can be used as a landmark to verify sample orientation.\nNote: By properly trimming and mounting the whole organ of Corti, the hair bundle and individual stereocilia can be visualized.\nNote: For the full organ of Corti, the tissue can be separated into three turns: an apical turn, a middle turn, and a basal turn.\nUsing the smallest spoon possible, transfer the turns to the slide (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: As an alternative to using a spoon, a glass Pasteur pipette with the tip enlarged using a glass etcher could also be used. However, plastic transfer pipettes should be avoided, if possible, as the tissue can easily stick to the sides of the pipette.\nRemove excess liquid with a pipette but keep a small drop to cover the tissue (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nAdd a drop of mounting medium (Prolong Gold or similar is ideal) onto the turn (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nCritical: Make sure to remove as much of the dilution buffer as possible as it can alter the refraction index of the mounting medium.\nCritical: Make sure the turn does not come in contact with air as this might potentially affect the hair bundle’s integrity.",
    "Note: Alternatively, the mounting medium can be added to the slide first, and the turn can be placed in the medium using the smallest spoon possible. This can only be done if the quantity of liquid transferred with the turn is extremely limited.\nUnder the stereomicroscope, use forceps to orient the sample facing upward and push it to the bottom of the mounting medium droplet until it sits on the glass slide.\nCritical: Make sure the turn is facing upward when mounting. When the turn is observed from the side, there should be a central ridge running through the organ of Corti on the same side as the hair bundles (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I). This ridge should be facing upward to image hair bundles (for a demonstration of steps 39–47, see Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nSelecting a large region of hair bundles, slowly roll the coverslip down onto the sample in the direction that the hair bundles would be deflected by sound-induced forces (from the intrados of the arched tissue to the extrados) (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E, 5F, 5I, and 5J).\nCritical: Perform this step slowly. If the coverslip is rolled too quickly, it can move the sample, which may end up damaging it.\nUsing two hands, firmly hold the coverslip in place for 10 s to ensure that the bundles are lying flat.\nNote: Holding the coverslip firmly in place helps to bring the hair bundles very close to the glass coverslip. Not only does this help to push the hair bundles to lie flat, allowing imaging of the full hair bundle, but it reduces the distance between the hair bundle and the coverslip, improving the imaging resolution.\nUse a Kimwipe to remove any excess mounting medium from the edges of the coverslip (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).",
    "If appropriate, seal the coverslip with nail polish.\nNote: If imaging immediately or if using a non-hardening mounting medium, the coverslip should be sealed with nail polish. Regardless, the coverslip can be sealed at the corners to prevent movement before allowing the mounting medium to harden at 4°C (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]H).\nNote: With this mounting technique, many of the hair bundles will be very close to the coverslip with little mounting medium between the sample and the glass. Because of this, even when using a hardening mounting medium, excellent images can be obtained immediately after mounting if the coverslip is sealed into place, since the refractive index of the mounting medium will not have a major impact on the resolution of those specific bundles. However, for bundles that are not lying directly against the coverslip, better images can be obtained after allowing the mounting medium to cure (e.g., for Prolong Gold, 24 h) before sealing.\nPause point: After mounting, the samples can be stored in the dark at 4°C until imaging. Imaging should be performed as soon as possible for best results but can be performed up to at least a week later. Although excellent images might be obtained at later time points, oxidation or photobleaching of fluorophores might potentially affect the outcomes.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S5. Mounting the organ of Corti on a microscope slide (related to steps 39–47)\nStep 4: Imaging the hair bundle\nTiming: about 3 h\nImmunofluorescence imaging of a properly mounted tissue can provide clear insight into the localization of a protein of interest (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1685-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(A and B) (A) A confocal microscope (or better) is used to localize (B) fluorescently labeled proteins of interest located within the stereocilia in samples mounted below a coverslip. Note that the stereocilia are close to the apical surface of other cells.\n(C) Example of espin-1 immunostaining at stereociliary tips in P11 mouse inner hair cell hair bundles.\n(D) Example images of phalliodin-labeled inner hair cell hair bundles from different regions (very apical, apical, middle, basal, and very basal) throughout a P7 organ of Corti.\nScale bars for (C) and (D): 5 mm.\nAt the eye piece, locate and bring the turn into focus using the phalloidin emission channel under 10× magnification.\nStill at the eye piece, switch to at least a 63× objective.\nNote: Make sure to add the proper immersion medium for the objective (e.g., oil, glycerol).\nNote: The numerical aperture (NA) of the lens being used will directly affect the attainable lateral resolution. The larger the numerical aperture, the greater the maximum resolution that can be obtained. In our protocol, our 10× objective has an NA of 0.45 and our 63× objective has an NA of 1.4.\nVisually scan the sample and identify regions with hair bundles properly oriented for imaging (lying flat with the inner stereociliary rows on top).\nOnce the region of interest is centered, switch to acquisition mode.\nQuickly adjust the laser intensity and gain in the phalloidin channel such that no pixels are oversaturated.",
    "Note: Lower laser intensity causes less bleaching and is less likely to cause bleed-through into other channels. For strong staining (such as phalloidin), laser power can often be below 0.5%. For less intense staining, it is still best to attempt to keep the laser power below 10% if possible. The maximum laser power used was approximately 5.5 μW for the 488 laser and 49.8 μW for the 561 laser.\nQuickly adjust the laser intensity and gain in the channel pertaining to the protein of interest such that no pixels are oversaturated.\nSelect the z-stack region and step size and crop the image to the bundles of interest.\nNote: Minimum z step size should be checked with your imaging system. Different microscopes have different limitations. The z stack region should encompass the full hair bundle. For reference, we collected data for this image with a z depth of 2.24 microns with a step depth of 330 nanometers. However, the z depth will be different from bundle to bundle, depending on its size and how flat it is lying.\nPotentially adjust parameters such as the pinhole (a larger pinhole increases the intensity and signal-to-noise ratio, but decreases the lateral resolution), averaging (increases the signal-to-noise ratio), accumulation (increases signal) and the speed of acquisition to obtain optimal images.\nAcquire the image z-stack.\nNote: After imaging, adjusting the image parameters post-imaging can help to reveal cleaner signal and reduce background.\nAfter imaging, adjust the high and low intensity levels using an image processing software (e.g., Imaris or Fiji) to obtain low background and clear signal.",
    "Either select a z-slice containing the staining of interest, or select a range of z-slices to generate a maximum intensity projection, or generate a 3D-reconstruction of the image (for an example of 3D-reconstructed bundles, see Miller et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to localize the protein of interest."
