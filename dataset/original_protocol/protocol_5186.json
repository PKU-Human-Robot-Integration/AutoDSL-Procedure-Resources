    "Protein expression and purificationTransform the pET15b vectors carrying Drp1 to Rosetta 2(DE3) pLysS competent cells.Plate the cells on an LB plate containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol (see Recipes) and incubate overnight at 37 °C. Select and place a colony into a 10 ml LB plate supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol (see Recipes). Shake the bacteria culture overnight at 37 °C at 200 rpm (New Brunswick Scientific, series 25).Dilute the 5 ml of the culture into 1 L of the same growth medium and continue to grow the culture for 3-5 h at 37 °C using an incubator shaker at 200 rpm (New Brunswick Scientific, series 25).Cool down the cultured cells on ice, and add 0.2 ml of 0.5 M IPTG (see Recipes) to 1 L of LB buffer. Final IPTG concentration is 0.1 mM.Shake the culture overnight at 16 °C using a refrigerated incubator shaker (The Lab Companion, IS-971R) at 200 rpm with cooling system. After incubation, move the culture medium to a 1,000 ml bottle (Beckman Coulter) and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in a JLA8.1000 rotor (Avanti J-26XP).Wash the bacteria twice with 40 ml PBS via centrifugation at 2,400 x g in a GH3.8 rotor using a CS-6R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 15 min and freeze cell pellets at -80 °C. Resuspend the frozen cell pellets in 40 ml of lysis buffer (see Recipes). Sonicate the bacteria on ice for 10 x 5 sec at setting 5 and then 10 x 5 sec at setting 2 using a Fisher Scientific Sonic dismembrator model 100. Centrifuge the cell homogenate at 2,400 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in a GH3.8 rotor using a CS-6R centrifuge.Centrifuge the supernatant at 20,100 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in JA-20X (Avanti J-E).",
    "Pass the supernatant through a Millex-HA syringe filter with a pore size of 0.45 µm.Incubate the lysate with 2 ml of pre-washed 50% Ni-NTA beads (His-Bind Resin, Novagen) overnight at 4 °C using a Labquake Shaker Rotisserie.Load the sample in a 15-ml column (Poly-prep chromatography column, Bio-Rad Laboratories) in a cold room. Wash the beads with 3 ml of lysis buffer and then 15 ml of lysis buffer.Wash the beads with 3 ml of wash buffer (see Recipes) and then 15 ml of wash buffer. Elute His6-tagged recombinant Drp1 proteins from the column using 0.9 ml of elution buffer (see Recipes) three times and collect eluents into nine 300-µl fractions.Identify fractions containing Drp1 proteins using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Combine peak fractions (typically fractions #3 and 4) (Figure 1) and mix them with 15 ml of lysis buffer without imidazole. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170503/20170503181545_1372.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of purified Drp1 by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue stainingPass the samples through an Amicon Ultra Centrifugation Filter (50k filter for full length Drp1 and 10k filter for domains) three times using lysis buffer without imidazole. The final volume is typically 1 ml.Mix the sample with final 20% DMSO, aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. Typically concentrations of full-length Drp1 were 30 µM.Flotation assayUnless otherwise noted, mix the lipids in a POPC:rhodamine-DPPE:variable lipid ratio of 84:1:15 (% mol). Dry up the lipids using nitrogen gas for 5 min and additionally dried in a SpeedVac overnight. Add 100 µl/one sample of 20 mM MES (pH 7.0)/100 mM NaCl (see Recipes) in lipid film and vortex for 1 h.Conduct five freeze-thaw cycles using dry ice and a 42 °C heat block. Generate the unilamellar liposomes via extrusion through a nanopore membrane with a pore size of 400 nm.",
    "This process is repeated 21 times. Confirm that the liposome is formed using fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170503/20170503181903_7374.jpgFigure 2. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of liposomesCheck the fluorescence intensity of rhodamine-PE by POLARstar Omega (Wavelength; Ex 544 nm, Em 590 nm) and then adjust the concentration of lipids based on the rhodamine intensity using 20 mM MES (pH 7.0)/100 mM NaCl.Mix the liposomes (5 mM lipids) with His6-Drp1 (5 μM) (final volume: 200 μl) and incubate at 4 °C with gentle mixing using a Labquake Shaker Rotisserie for 1 h in 20 mM MES (pH 7.0)/100 mM NaCl (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170503/20170503181947_8604.jpgFigure 3. Drp1 and liposomes are incubated and analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Amounts of Drp1 that co-migrate with liposomes into fractions 1 and 2 are quantified.Dilute the Drp1-liposome mixture in final 1.73 M sucrose/20 mM MES (pH 7.0) (final volume: 1.25 ml) placed at the bottom of tubes. Then overlay 2.9 ml of 1.25 M sucrose/20 mM MES (pH 7.0) and 0.85 ml of 0.25 M sucrose/20 mM MES (pH 7.0) (Figure 3). Centrifuge the sucrose gradient at 287,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C in an SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Collect the five fractions (0.5, 0.75, 1.75, 1.75 and 0.25 ml) from the top. The majority of the liposomes typically floats to the top two fractions.Measure the rhodamine intensity using a POLARstar Omega. Analyze each fraction (equal volume) using SDS-PAGE and silver staining (SilverQuestTM silver staining kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions."
