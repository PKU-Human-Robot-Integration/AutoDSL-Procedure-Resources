    "The preparation of primer stock solutions and the FRET-qPCR setup were carried out separately in different biosafety cabinets.The DNA extraction should be performed on a clean working desk, that is only used for DNA extraction, with a separate set of pipettes, used only for this purpose. Additionally, false positive results are prevented by the use of aerosol-resistant pipette tips. During DNA extraction and FRET-qPCR setup, the gloves should be changed several times, to avoid cross contamination between different (sometimes high positive) samples. When removing the capillaries from the cycler after the PCR reaction is finished, take care that no capillary breaks! A broken capillary containing a positive sample bears the risk of a carry-over contamination, and has to be carefully cleaned, and gloves changed! Additionally, in the FastStart DNA Master HybProbe mix, dTTP is replaced by dUTP, allowing the use of uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) as an additional carryover prevention measure.Human blood samplesWe recommend tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to prevent the coagulation of blood. In contrast to heparin (also used as anticoagulant), EDTA does not inhibit PCR and is frequently used for hematological, as well as molecular diagnostics. Gloves have to be worn all the time, because human blood samples might be infectious. Additionally, eye protection should be worn to minimise the chance of infection in case of aerosol generation, splashes, or other accidental spillages. Postal transport at room temperature should not exceed 48 h. Then, the blood samples should be stored at 4°C and DNA extraction should be performed the next day. Alternatively, store of the blood samples at -20°C until DNA extraction is possible.DNA extraction (QIAamp DNA Mini kit)Kit contents: QIAamp Mini Spin Columns, Collection tubes 2mL, Buffer AL, Buffer AW1 (concentrate), Buffer AW2 (concentrate), Buffer AE, Proteinase K.",
    "All components are stable for up to one year after delivery at room temperature (15–25°C).All centrifugation steps are performed at room temperature (15–25°C). Brief centrifugation means 5–10 s at maximum speed; this is sufficient to remove liquid from the lid, and collect the content at the bottom of the tube.Add absolute ethanol to Buffer AW1 and AW2, as indicated on the bottles.Pipet 20 µL of Proteinase K into the bottom of a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.Add 200 µL of EDTA blood (invert the tube several times before pipetting the 200 µL!)Add 200 µL of Buffer AL, and mix by vortexing for 15 s.Note: Do not add Proteinase K directly to Buffer AL. Incubate in the ThermoMixer with shaking at 56°C for 10 min.Briefly centrifuge the tubes, to remove drops from the lid.Add 200 µL of absolute ethanol, vortex for 15 s, and briefly centrifuge the tubes.Carefully apply the mixture (620 µL) to the QIAamp Mini spin column (in a 2-mL collection tube). Close the cap and centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min. Place the spin column in a fresh 2-mL collection tube, and discard the tube containing the filtrate.Add 500 µL of Buffer AW1, and centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min.Discard the filtrate and the collection tube.Place the spin column in a fresh 2-mL collection tube, add 500 µL of Buffer AW2, and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 3 min.Discard the filtrate and the collection tube.Place the spin column in a fresh 2-mL collection tube (not provided), and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 1 min, to eliminate possible Buffer AW2 carryover.Place the spin column in a clean 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, add 100 µL of AE buffer, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Centrifuge at ≥6,000 × g for 1 min, to elute the purified DNA from the spin column.Store the DNA at 4°C until qPCR-setup (stable for several weeks at 4°C, or stable for 5 years when frozen at -20°C).FRET-qPCRPrepare primer and probe stock solutions (see working stock preparation instructions).The LightCycler® Fast Start DNA Master HybProbe kit is stored at -25–-15°C: Kit Contents: vial 1a (LightCycler® Fast Start Enzym), vial 1b (LightCycler® Fast Start reaction mix), vial 2 (MgCl2 stock solution, 25 mM), and vial 3 (H2O, PCR-grade).All centrifugation steps are at room temperature (15–25°C). Brief centrifugation means 5–10 s at maximum speed; this is sufficient to remove liquid from the lid, and collect the content at the bottom of the tube.Prepare the LightCycler® Fast Start DNA Master HybProbe (10× concentrated): thaw one vial 1a, and one vial 1b.Briefly centrifuge vial 1b and one vial 1a (enzyme).Pipet 60 µL from vial 1b into vial 1a, and mix gently by pipetting 5 times up and down. DO NOT vortex!Label vial 1a (red cap) with the new labels provided, it is now vial 1. Add the date; the reagent is stable at 4°C for 7 days.Thaw and mix vial 2 and vial 3, until all frozen parts have disappeared. Briefly centrifuge all tubes listed in Table 2.Table 2.
