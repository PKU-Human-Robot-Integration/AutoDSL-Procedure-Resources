    "Part I: Sample collection Collection of interstitial fluid from the hypothalamic area by means of a microdialysis methodAdminister pentobarbital solution intraperitoneally to a c57BL/6J mouse (male, at 10-25 weeks old) with a dose of 50 mg/kg body using an insulin syringe (29 gauge of needle x 12.7 mm, 0.5-ml). Tilt the mouse with its head slightly toward the ground, and insert the needle at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen and to a depth in which 1/2 of the needle length is placed in the peritoneal cavity. Use caution to avoid injection of the intestinal organs and urinary bladder.Attach a guide cannula to a manipulator of the stereotaxic instrument in the vertical plane (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000356_2523.jpgFigure 1. Attachment of a guide cannula on the stereotaxic instrument. A. Stereotaxic instrument SR-5M-HT obtained from Narishige. B. A guide cannula is attached to the tip of a manipulator of the instrument.Under anesthesia, attach an ear bar to the mouse so that its sinciput is horizontally held.Before the surgery, wet the mouse head thoroughly with physiological saline to avoid the hairs adhering to scissors and disturbing the operation. Alternatively, you can shave the scalp, although this is not necessary for the following operation.Remove the scalp at the top of the head around the bregma with scissors in a circle of at most 3 mm in diameter so that the skull becomes visible.Carefully remove the periosteum and aponeurosis covering the skull using tweezers and scissors until the film disappears.Wipe the skull with cotton wool, and let the surface dry for about 10 min.The bregma is difficult to visualize when the surface is wet.",
    "Until the bregma appears, make a hole of approximately 1 mm in diameter in the posterior part of the exposed skull using a dental drill to attach an anchor screw to fasten the guide cannula. The screw should be attached near the guide cannula to be set. Move the manipulator just as the tip of the guide cannula comes over the bregma (Figure 2), and then record the vertical and horizontal tick marks of the stereotaxic instrument.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000424_1078.jpgFigure 2. Setting the tip of the guide cannula onto the bregma of the skull. The photo represents the tip of a guide cannula on the bregma.Move the tip of the guide cannula from the bregma, 0.9 mm forward, 0.1 mm right, and mark the position with oil-based ink. To drill a hole at the position, the guide cannula needs to be detached; therefore, it is recommended that the position set is marked with an oil-based ink before the cannula is removed.Use a dental drill to make a hole of about 1 mm in diameter at the marked point.Move the cannula down, touch it to the surface of the brain (at the level of the dura mater), and read the scale of the depth.Move the cannula further down slowly to a depth of 4.0 mm from the surface. This operation usually takes at least 1 min. Wipe the blood off with absorbent cotton when the surgical area bleeds during the operation. If bleeding does not stop, keep cotton where the blood is coming out from until it stops. If the mice bleed by more than a tenth of whole blood, usually estimated as 1/13 of the body weight, discontinuation of the operation should be considered.Fasten the cannula to the skull with instant adhesive temporarily.",
    "When the instant adhesive hardens, use dental cement to seal the gap between the guide cannula and the skull.When the cement is set, detach the cannula from the manipulator.Using a precision screwdriver, attach an anchor screw to the hole made in Step A8.Coat the skull and anchor screw firmly with dental cement, and then fasten the cannula with the anchor screw. Please make sure the guide cannula cannot be moved; it may come off or move when the mouse moves freely, resulting in inaccurate measurements.Once the cement is dry, apply woodworking glue to cover the surface of the cement. It usually takes approximately 10 and 5 min for the cement and glue to harden, respectively.When the glue has hardened, release the mouse to its cage.The next day, anesthetize the mice with pentobarbital and use tweezers to pull off the dummy probe that was inserted inside the guide cannula.Insert a fresh microdialysis probe, and fix it with dental cement. Before insertion, rinse the probe according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In our case, the tip of the probe was dipped in 70% EtOH solution and infused with KRPB for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Then, the tip of the probe was transferred into KRPB and infused with KRPB for another 5 min at the same flow rate. Probes were usually prepared on the day of use.Keep the mice in their cages for another 5 days to recover from postoperative damage. If the mice lose body weight of 25% or more after the operation, the experiment is not recommended due to severe damage to the brain.Attach the mouse to a free-moving device, transfer it to an acrylic cage, and infuse KRPB at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The dialysate sample should be collected every hour in 0.",
    "6-ml microtubes kept on ice (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Collection of dialysate from free-moving mice. The mouse can freely move in the acryl cage during KRPB infusion. KRPB flows from a blue tube, and dialysate samples are collected from a colorless tube. (This video was made at Kanazawa Univ. according to guidelines from the Kanazawa Univ. on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Kanazawa University under protocols # AP-143148, AP-153511, AP-163750.)Two hours after initiation of infusion, administer LPS (100 μg/kg body) intraperitoneally to the mouse using an insulin syringe.Six hours after administration, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation, and isolate the brain. Fix the brain overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA solution.Collect the probe, dip it in 10 ng/ml PGE2/KRPB solution, and infuse KRPB at 37 °C for 1 h at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Store the collected dialysate sample at -30 °C until use. We confirmed that PGE2 in the dialysate is relatively stable by storage at -30 °C for at least one week.Embed the brain tissue fixed with 4% PFA in paraffin, and prepare brain sections attached on a glass slide.To remove paraffin from the sections, dip them in fresh xylene for 4 min in a glass container, and repeat this step 4 times.Dip the sections into absolute EtOH, followed by 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70% EtOH solution for 4 min each to remove xylene from them.Stain nuclei with hematoxylin for 1 min. After washing with tap water for 5 min, to visualize the cytoplasm, stain the sections with eosin for 40 s. Wash off extra eosin with tap water and dip the slides in 80% solution, followed by 95% EtOH and absolute ethanol for 10 s each to make them dehydrated.",
    "Dip them into fresh xylene for 3 min, repeat this procedure three times, and then seal the sections using a mounting agent and cover glass.Confirm the insertion position of the probe in the brain with a stereomicroscope (Figure 3). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining makes it easy to observe the place of probe insertion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000450_9373.jpgFigure 3. HE staining in the mouse brain after the microdialysis experiment. The histological image of the mouse brain coronal section is shown after microdialysis probe insertion. The arrow indicates the place of an edge of the inserted microdialysis probe. The indicated bar represents 1,000 µm.Collection of hypothalamic tissuesAdminister LPS (100 μg/kg body) intraperitoneally to a mouse.At the designated period of time, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.Immediately, decapitate the mouse, incise the scalp and avoid damage to the brain, expose the skull, and then isolate the whole brain. The dissection can be performed on tissue papers spread on ice.Place the brain ventral side up on glass plates on ice to keep it relatively cold.Dissect out the diencephalon by coronal cuts just in front of the optic chiasma and behind the mammillary body. Remove the arcuate nuclei by another coronal cut in the middle of the optic tract, from rostral to infundibulum. Please see the previous article (Salehi et al., 2012) for detailed procedures.Cut the obtained brain block along the anterior commissure, and collect the ventral side of the anterior commissure as the hypothalamic tissue in a 1.5-ml microtube. Freeze the hypothalamic tissue immediately in liquid nitrogen, and store in a -80 °C deep freezer until use. The frozen samples can be stored for at least one week, under which PGE2 is relatively stable.Collection of CSFNote: CSF was collected based on the method reported previously (Liu et al., 2012).",
    "Administer LPS (100 μg/kg body) intraperitoneally into a mouse.At the designated period of time, anesthetize the mouse with pentobarbital (i.p. administration, 50 mg/kg body).Under anesthesia, attach the mouse head to the stereotaxic instrument with its neck tilted forward as much as possible. Take caution not to break the neck by bending it too much. Further information is provided in the previous report (Liu et al., 2012).Cut and remove the skin over the occipital region with scissors, and expose the dura of the cisternal region with tweezers.Attach a glass micropipette horizontally to the manipulator of the stereotaxic instrument.Insert the tip of the micropipette into the dura at a depth of approximately 1 mm, and then suck up the CSF into the micropipette. The volume of the collected CSF should be approximately 10 μl.Transfer the collected CSF to a 1.5-ml microtube.Freeze the CSF immediately in liquid nitrogen, and store in a -80 °C deep freezer until use. The frozen samples can be stored for at least one week, under which PGE2 is relatively stable.Part II: PGE2 extractionInterstitial fluid (The schematic figure is shown as Figure 4)Transfer 100 μl of dialysate sample to a 1.5-ml microtube, and add 200 μl of 1.25 ng/ml d4-PGE2 (as an internal standard) and 15 μl of 10% formic acid aqueous solution (v/v). Set the final concentration of d4-PGE2 at 0.635 ng/ml by addition of 85 µl of de-ionized water. The concentration of 0.635 ng/ml corresponds to 5 ng/ml when the sample is set to 50 μl with the mobile phase, which is high enough not to be affected by daily fluctuation of the measurement.Add 500 μl of ethyl acetate, and shake vigorously for 15 min.Spin the sample by a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min at 21,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5-ml microtube, and evaporate the supernatant to dryness under reduced pressure at room temperature for 30 min with a Savant SpeedVac SPD2010.Reconstitute the obtained residues with 50 μl of 25% acetonitrile solution containing 0.075% formic acid (v/v), and dissolve them as much as possible by shaking for at least 10 min.Separate the undissolved materials or debris by centrifuge for 10 min at 21,000 x g at 4 °C, and then obtain the clear supernatant.Apply the supernatant to LC-MS/MS to determine Cisf of PGE2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000525_9684.jpgFigure 4.
