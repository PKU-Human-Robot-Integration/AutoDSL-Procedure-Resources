  "title": "Modified paired end rapid library preparation protocol for 454 GS Junior 8 kb library preparation using Covaris g-tubes and BluePippin electrophoresis",
  "procedures": [
    "Base protocol is the Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method Manual, 20 kb and 8 kb Span, GS Junior Titanium Series, March 2012. See attached \"Supplementary Manual\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3223/original/GSJuniorPairedEndLibraryPrepMethodManual-20kb-8kbSpan_March2012.pdf?1409053168.\nModifications by Hill lab \\(Saskatoon) group:\nStart with 15 µg of sample genomic DNA in 150 µL Tris-HCl pH 8.0 \\(genomic DNA preparation of 100 ng/µL) - same as original protocol\nSection 3.1 - DNA Fragmentation \\(HydroShear) - completely disregard this section. Instead, use Covaris g-tubes.\n• Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later.\n• Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes - Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8,600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube.\n• Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later.\nSection 3.2 - Fragment End Repair\n• For 25°C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work.\n• Disregard step 3 \\(don’t need this agarose gel).\n• Step 4m - use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing \\(just rock the tube back and forth).\nSection 3.3 - Circularization Adaptor Ligation\n• Step 1 - change the 2x rapid ligase buffer for 10x rapid ligase buffer \\(New England Biolabs product) and only add 10 µL \\(reduces mixture to 100 µL from 190 µL).\n• Stop at the end of Step 4 and disregard Steps 5-11. Instead, take the entire sample and load onto a BluePippin cassette. Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later.",
    "• To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5th lane with BluePippin marker.\n• Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5,000-11,000 bp.\n• When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0.1% Tween 20 solution \\(supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample.\n• Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column \\(0.5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14,000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14,000 x g. Invert column in a clean collection tube and spin for 2 min at 1,000 x g.\n• Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later.\n• Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA \\(unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin.\n• Continue to next section\nSection 3.5 - Fill-In Reaction\n• At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit. You need to achieve at least 6 ng/µL to continue.\nSection 3.6 - Circularization\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.7 - Nebulizer Assembly \\(3.7.1) and DNA Nebulization and Collection/Purification of the Fragmented DNA \\(3.7.2)\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.8 - Fragment End Repair\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.9 - Immobilization Bead Preparation",
    "• For Step 1 - prepare 2x Library Binding Buffer by mixing 5 mL Molecular Biology Grade Water, 4 mL of 5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 10x TE.\nSection 3.10 - Adaptor Ligation\n• For Step 4 - incubate at 25°C for 1 hour in a thermocycler.\nSection 3.11 - Library Immobilization\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.12 - Library Amplification\n• Prepare the PCR mixture as indicated for the sample and a second mixture to run without sample as a negative control. Save a few µL of the sample PCR after amplification and the negative PCR sample to run on the BioAnalyzer chip at the end.\nSection 3.13 - Sizing Mix Preparation\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.14 - Final Library Size Selection\n• No changes to protocol\nSection 3.15 - Library Quality Assessment\n• Step 1 - use BioAnalyzer chip and run the PCR sample and negative control from Section 3.12, as well as the final sample. Also, quantify final sample using Life Technologies’s Qubit ssDNA quantification kit."
