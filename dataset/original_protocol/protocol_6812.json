    "The experimental procedure for the detection of mitochondrial function in human PBMCs using a XF Analyzer is shown schematically in Figure 2. This is followed by a detailed description of the individual work steps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3980/bioprotoc-11-07-3980-g002.jpgFigure 2. Workflow diagram of mitochondrial function measurement in human PBMCs using a XF AnalyzerDay before the experimentHydration of XF24 sensor cartridge (consisting of the cartridge lid, the sensor cartridge itself and the utility plate; see Figure 3B and 3C):Add 1 ml XF Calibrant Solution into each well of the utility plate.Remove air bubbles that might arise at the sensors with a pipette tip.Incubate the assembled plate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight.Switch on the XF24 Analyzer (see Figure 3A) and let it warm up to 37 °C overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3980/bioprotoc-11-07-3980-g003.jpgFigure 3. XF24 Analyzer (A) and XF24 sensor cartridge (B and C). The sensor cartridge, including markings of the sensors, is shown from above (B) as well as from below (C). In addition, the injection ports are marked (B) and the utility plate is depicted (C).Programming of measurement protocol on the XF Analyzer:Equilibration: 30 minMeasurement period 1:Mixing: 4 minWaiting: 2 minMeasuring: 3 min→ 3 repetitionsInjection of port A (50 µl of 7.5 µM oligomycin; final concentration 0.75 µM)Measurement period 2:Mixing: 4 minWaiting: 2 minMeasuring: 3 min→ 3 repetitionsInjection of port B (55 µl of 10 µM FCCP; final concentration 1 µM)Measurement period 3:Mixing: 4 minWaiting: 2 minMeasuring: 3 min→ 3 repetitionsInjection of port C (60 µl of 16.7 µM rotenone/antimycin A; final concentration 1.67 µM)Measurement period 4:Mixing: 4 minWaiting: 2 minMeasuring: 3 min→ 3 repetitionsDay of the experimentCoating of XF24 cell culture microplate:Add 30 µl of Poly-D-Lysine working solution (50 µg/ml) into each well and incubate the plate for 1 h at RT.",
    "Discard the supernatant, wash each well with 300 µl ddH2O and let the plate air dry under sterile conditions (approximately 30 min).Isolation of PBMCs (continue with this step during microplate coating; see Figure 4):Add 15 ml of Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS (RT) into a 50 ml LeucosepTM tube and centrifugate at 1,000 × g for 30 s at RT.Dilute an appropriate volume of anticoagulated human blood at a ratio of 1:2 with 0.9% NaCl solution (at least 7.5 ml and at most 15 ml).Transfer the resulting volume (at least 15 ml and at most 30 ml) into the prepared LeucosepTM tube and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at RT in a swing out rotor with brakes switched off.Harvest the PBMC fraction which appears as white layer between the plasma and the Ficoll above the porous barrier of the LeucosepTM tube [for detailed information see manufacturer's instructions or refer to Matt and Bergemann, (2019)]. To do this use a 1,000 µl Eppendorf pipette and collect the PBMCs in a 50 ml screw cap tube.Wash the cells once with 10 ml PBS and centrifuge at 250 × g for 10 min.Repeat the washing step twice with 5 ml PBS each.Determine the number of cells using a Neubauer counting chamber improved.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3980/bioprotoc-11-07-3980-g004.jpgFigure 4. Isolation of PBMCs with a LeucosepTM tube. On the left side, the tube is filled with Ficoll-PaqueTM below and anticoagulated and diluted blood above the porous barrier. On the right side, after density gradient centrifugation, the tube shows the following layers from top to bottom: plasma – PBMCs – Ficoll-PaqueTM – porous barrier – Ficoll-PaqueTM – erythrocytes and granulocytes.Prepare the assay medium and preheat at 37 °C before use.Seeding PBMCs onto pre-coated XF24 cell culture microplate:Note: 4 to 5 wells per condition are recommended.",
    "The wells A1, B4, C3 and D6 are normally used as background wells (without cells). An exemplary plate layout as well as an image of PBMCs seeded on Poly-D-Lysine is shown in Figure 5. Take 5 × 105 of the isolated PBMCs per well and centrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min.Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µl assay medium per well.Add 100 µl of cell suspension per well.Fill the background wells with 450 µl assay medium.Centrifuge the plate at 250 × g for 1 min in a swing out rotor with brakes switched off.Add 350 µl assay medium to the wells with cells (final volume in each well: 450 µl).Incubate the plate at 37 °C without CO2 until measurement (on average about 1 h).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3980/bioprotoc-11-07-3980-g005.jpgFigure 5. Exemplary plate layout of an XF24 cell culture microplate (left side) and a bright field microscopy image of PBMCs seeded on a Poly-D-Lysine coated XF24 cell culture microplate (right side). Left side: The wells A1, B4, C3 and D6 are used as background wells (without cells). One color (light green, dark green, dark orange, light orange) represents one condition each. There are 5 wells per condition. Right side: The image shows PBMCs in 100× magnification.Loading of XF24 sensor cartridge with compounds:Prepare compounds as follows:Dilute 4.86 µl of 2.5 mM oligomycin solution in 1,615 µl assay medium (results in  7.5 µM).Dilute 6.48 µl of 2.5 mM FCCP solution in 1,614 µl assay medium (results in 10 µM).Dilute 10.82 µl of 2.5 mM rotenone solution and 10.82 µl of 2.5 mM antimycin A solution in 1,598 µl assay medium (results in 16.7 µM each).",
    "Load the injection ports of the XF24 sensor cartridge as follows:Note: Avoid the formation of air bubbles in the injection ports and handle the XF24 sensor cartridge with care after loading in order to prevent dripping down of the compounds. Fill all ports A with 50 µl of 7.5 µM oligomycin.Fill all ports B with 55 µl of 10 µM FCCP.Fill all ports C with 60 µl of 16.7 µM rotenone/antimycin A.Start the run in the XF Analyzer (follow the instructions of the software):Place the XF24 sensor cartridge (without lid) in the XF Analyzer and start the calibration.After completion of the calibration, replace the utility plate by the XF24 cell culture microplate and start measurement.Normalization of measurement results to the number of cells:Resuspend PBMCs in the final volume of each well (615 µl) by repeatedly pipetting up and down.Determine the number of cells per well using a Neubauer counting chamber improved."
