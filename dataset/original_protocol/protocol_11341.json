  "procedures": [
    "Whole brains were obtained with approval from the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) of the Florida State University. A total of twelve mouse brains (3 brains from each age group: 2, 4, 6, and 8 months) from a C57BL/6 J background were used for EV extraction, as previously described16. Lung tumor specimens were generously donated by Dr. Mandip Sachdeva under approval of the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University IACUC. Lung tumors were derived from the human adenocarcinoma cell line H1975 grown in immunodeficient Balb/c nu/nu nude mice. Data from two representative tumor replicates are highlighted in this study.\nNOTE: A schematic overview of the vesicle isolation and purification method is provided in Figure 1.\n1. Tissue Dissociation and Differential Centrifugation\nPrepare 10 mL of dissociation buffer (10 mg of papain; 5.5 mM L-cysteine; 67 µM 2-mercaptoethanol; 1.1 mM EDTA) in Hibernate-E medium per approximately 0.4-1.0 g of tissue. Note that all solutions used for EV enrichment and purification should be diluted in ultrapure filtered water.\nAdd whole fresh or frozen tissue to dissociation buffer in a 50 mL conical tube, and incubate in a warm water bath at 37 °C for 20 min. Tissue may be cut into smaller fragments before incubation if needed.\nFollowing the incubation, add protease and phosphatase inhibitors for a final 1x concentration to the dissociation buffer containing the tissue.\nPour the solution containing the tissue into a loose-fit Dounce homogenizer, and gently dissociate the tissue using approximately 30 slow strokes per sample. The number of strokes may be adjusted based on tissue consistency.\nTransfer dissociated tissue in buffer to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells and remaining fibrous or cohesive tissue fragments.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a clean 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet and discard large cellular debris.\nTransfer the supernatant again to a clean 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 40 min at 4 °C to pellet undesired larger vesicles or small apoptotic bodies.\nNOTE: This pellet can be saved for additional study of larger vesicles if desired.\nDecant the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter into a clean 12 mL ultracentrifugation tube.\nNOTE: Densely fibrotic tissue samples may not be easily filtered. These samples can be filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer, then passed through serially smaller needles (18 G, 20 G, 22 G) before filtering through the 0.45 µm filter.\nUltracentrifuge the sample at 100,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet small EVs.\nDecant the supernatant and leave the ultracentrifugation tubes inverted for 5-10 min, tapping frequently to remove residual liquid on the sides of tubes. Residual fluid can also be aspirated using an aspirating vacuum pipette.\nRe-suspend EV pellet in 1.5 mL of 0.25 M sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4). It is important to ensure full re-suspension of the pellet in this step. To do so, cover the tubes with parafilm before vortexing EVs into solution. Rock the ultracentrifuge tubes for 15-20 min at room temperature before a final vortex mix.\nBriefly centrifuge the tubes at a speed no more than 1,000 x g to recover the liquid suspension at the bottom of the tube.\nProceed to the gradient purification steps below, or if needed, store EV suspension at 4 °C overnight.\n2. Density Gradient Purification",
    "Add 1.5 mL of 60% iodixanol (stock solution in water) to the 1.5 mL sucrose/Tris buffer containing EVs to create a final solution containing 30% iodixanol. Pipette up and down several times to mix solution thoroughly. Be cautious to avoid losing solution in the pipette tip, as the high iodixanol concentration is quite viscous.\nTransfer the 30% iodixanol buffer solution containing EVs to the bottom of a 5.5 mL ultracentrifugation tube.\nPrepare at least 1.5 mL of 20% and 10% iodixanol solutions per sample in ultrapure water from the 60% iodixanol stock solution.\nMeasure 1.3 mL of 20% iodixanol and carefully layer on top of the bottom gradient layer using a syringe and an 18 G needle. To avoid mixing the layers at the density interface, keep the bevel of the needle in contact with the inside of the ultracentrifugation tube just above the meniscus and add the solution dropwise.\nLayer 1.2 mL of 10% iodixanol solution on top of the 20% iodixanol layer using the same technique as above.\nCarefully balance and load the ultracentrifugation tubes into rotor buckets and centrifuge in a swing-bucket rotor at 268,000 x g for 50 min at 4 °C. Set the acceleration and deceleration speeds of the centrifuge to the minimum rates allowed to avoid disruption of the density layers.\nLabel ten 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample to correspond to fractions 1 through 10 of the density gradient. Fraction 1 is designated as the topmost fraction that will be first removed, while fraction 10 is the bottom fraction last removed.",
    "Once the gradient ultracentrifugation has completed, gently remove the tubes from the rotor buckets and place in a stable holder. A visible band of vesicles will often be seen in the fraction of interest. Pipette ten serial fractions of 490 µL from the top of the gradient into the corresponding tubes. There will be a small amount of fluid remaining at the bottom of the tube that likely contains contaminating proteins. This sample can be discarded, or retained as fraction 11 if desired.\nMeasure the refractive indices of fractions using a refractometer. This can also be performed with a control gradient run in parallel if sample conservation is necessary. Pipette 20-30 µL of each fraction containing iodixanol onto the refractometer surface, and estimate the density by comparing the refractive indices to known iodixanol densities. Note that fractions can be stored overnight in the iodixanol-containing solution if needed before proceeding to the next ultracentrifugation wash step.\nTransfer each fraction to a clean 12 mL ultracentrifugation tube. Add 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) to the tube and mix by pipetting slowly up and down.\nNOTE: PBS added to the samples should be particle-free, ensured by filtering sterile PBS through a 0.22 µm filter and storing at room temperature to avoid salt precipitation.\nAdd an additional 6 mL of 1x PBS to the top and again mix carefully.\nUltracentrifuge the tubes at 100,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C to re-pellet small vesicles. Decant the supernatant and tap the tubes dry before lysis of vesicles for protein analysis (Step 3) or re-suspension of EVs for morphologic analysis (Step 5).\n3. Lysis and Immunoblot Confirmation of EV Proteins",
    "NOTE: If preservation of whole vesicles for morphologic characterization or biological activity is desired, researchers can proceed directly to Step 5. In initial experiments, or before mass spectrometry analysis, all fractions recovered should be analyzed by immunoblot to confirm fractions with EV proteins.\nTo lyse EVs for protein analysis, add 40 µL of strong lysis buffer (5% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 120 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 8 M urea) with the addition of protease inhibitor to EV pellet in ultracentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: If non-reducing conditions are desired for antibody detection of proteins, substitute ultrapure water for 2-mercaptoethanol in the strong lysis buffer.\nEnsure complete re-suspension of pellet and lysis of EVs in buffer by placing parafilm over the ultracentrifugation tube, vortexing vigorously, then rocking for 20 min at room temperature before a final vortex.\nBriefly centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 30-60 s to recover the entire sample volume. Transfer the sample to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and store at -20 °C to -80 °C until further processing.\nTo prepare purified lysates for immunoblot analysis, add 5x Laemmli sample buffer (10% SDS, 250 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1 mg/mL bromophenol blue, 0.5 M DTT, 50% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) to the samples for a final concentration of 1x.\nNOTE: If non-reducing conditions are desired, replace the DTT and 2-mercaptoethanol with ultrapure water.\nIf whole tissue homogenate controls are desired, lyse the tissue in the urea-containing strong lysis buffer detailed above with protease inhibitor, then centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min to discard the remaining extracellular matrix, whole cells, or intact cellular debris. Add 5x Laemmli sample buffer to the tissue homogenate for a final concentration of 1x.",
    "Boil the sample buffer containing EV or tissue homogenate samples at 95 °C for 5-10 min, then load equal volume (from the equivalent of 0.1-0.3 g of starting tissue material; 1-2 µg of purified EV protein) of fractions 1-10 into a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Load equal mass of tissue homogenate. Greater volume of samples may be needed for detection by less sensitive antibodies.\nProceed with gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as previously detailed21 to confirm EV proteins in the purified lysates and compare relative EV abundance in fractions.\nNOTE: Once EV protein has been reproducibly demonstrated in consistent fractions, the final ultracentrifugation wash described in Step 2.12 may be limited to gradient fractions of interest.\n4. EV Protein Quantification\nUse a detergent- and urea- compatible fluorescence-based assay if sensitive quantification of EV proteins is desired for further analysis (see Table of Materials). Note that some fluorescence-based assays are compatible with the bromophenol blue present in Laemmli sample buffer, facilitating direct lysis of the EV pellet (in Step 2.12) in this buffer if preferred.\nIf the aforementioned fluorescence-based protein quantification kit is used, spot 1 µL of sample or standard in at least duplicate on the provided filter paper, and continue protein quantification according to manufacturer's instructions.\n5. Characterization of EV Morphology\nTo examine whole vesicles after the final centrifugation wash in Step 2.12, thoroughly re-suspend EV pellet in particle-free 1x PBS. Store EVs at 4 °C for no longer than one week until processing to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nNOTE: It is beneficial to have previously confirmed fractions consistently containing enriched EV protein by immunoblot analysis to limit morphological analyses to fractions of interest.\nPerform nanoparticle tracking analysis on whole EV samples to determine the concentration and size of vesicles in preparations, as previously detailed22.",
    "Characterize EV morphology and confirm size measurements by electron microscopy of vesicles, if desired. EM grids can be prepared from vesicle suspensions following Step 5.123, or alternatively can be processed as block preparations24 from pellets following Step 2.12.\n6. In-gel Purification and Trypsin Digestion for Mass Spectrometry Analysis\nIf characterization of EV proteomes by mass spectrometry is desired, load equal mass (at least 10 µg of protein) of fractions containing EVs into a pre-cast polyacrylamide gel to separate and purify proteins. Manufacturer supplied pre-cast gels are preferred to reduce the levels of potential contaminating proteins (e.g., keratin) being introduced into the samples.\nRun the sample at least 0.5 inches into the polyacrylamide gel for protein purification, then fix and stain with Coomassie dye, as previously described in detail25.\nCut the lanes into 1 mm3 cubes for trypsin digestion, as previously detailed19,26.\nLoad 5 µL of digested peptide sample into LC-MS/MS instrument for separation on the analytical column and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry according to parameters specified in detail16.\nSubscription Required.
