    "1. Prepare the flow chambers\nClean the glass coverslips\n\t\nUsing wash bottles with distilled water, ethanol, and isopropanol, rinse the 24 mm x 50 mm coverslips in the following order: water, ethanol, water, isopropanol, water. Dry the coverslips with a stream of clean nitrogen. It is important to rinse the coverslips from top to bottom, holding the bottom corner with soft-tipped forceps. Dry the coverslip in the same direction to avoid transferring contamination from the forceps (Figure 2A).\nSimilarly, rinse the 24 mm x 24 mm coverslips with distilled water, ethanol, and distilled water. Dry the coverslips with a stream of clean nitrogen.\nIdentify the working side of the coverslip, place a drop of distilled water on the surface of the clean coverslip and follow steps 3.1–3.2 of the protocol. Usually only one side of the 24 mm x 50 mm coverslip has the optical quality suitable for MP measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: After focusing, no significant surface imperfections should be detectable, and the “signal” value shown in the data collection software should be less than 0.05% (Figure 1A-C). The working sides of all coverslips in the box are oriented in the same direction. The same procedure should be used to test the efficiency of the coverslip cleaning.\nAssemble the flow chamber\n\t\nPosition the 24 mm x 24 mm coverslip on a piece of aluminum foil. Place strips of double-sided tape on top of the 24 mm x 24 mm coverslip as shown in Figure 2B and cut the tape along the edge of the glass. Separate the coverslip from the aluminum foil and attach it to the working side of the 24 mm x 50 mm coverslip (Figure 2C).",
    "NOTE: Channel size can vary, but a width of 3 mm–5 mm is recommended. Wider channels require larger sample volumes and very narrow channels may be difficult to load. Usually, two parallel channels can easily be created on the 24 mm x 24 mm coverslip. Protocol can be paused here.\n2. Prepare the antibody-antigen samples for the affinity measurements\nFilter at least 2 mL of the PBS buffer using 0.22 µm syringe filters to remove dust particles or aggregates. Centrifuge the protein stock for 10 minutes at the maximum speed of the tabletop centrifuge (approximately 16,000 x g).\n\tNOTE: PBS is the recommended buffer for this protocol, but MP has no particular buffer requirements, and other biological buffers are also acceptable. However, high glycerol concentrations (>10%) and very low ionic strengths (salt concentration <10 mM) may affect the image and data quality and are not recommended.\nDetermine the actual concentrations of the antibody and antigen stocks by measuring their 280 nm UV absorbance.\nCalculate the measurement concentrations of the antigen-antibody mixture. If the estimated value of the antibody binding affinity is not known, plan to prepare a sample with 30 nM antigen and 20 nM antibody concentration. When the approximate affinity is known, the antibody to antigen ratio and their concentrations should be optimized according to the expected Kd values. Use the total antigen concentration in the mixture equal to the sum of the expected Kd and the total antibody concentration in the equation below. Assuming Kd1 = Kd2 for the two paratopes of the antibody, this will result in comparable concentrations of the free antibody and the antibody-antigen complexes in the sample.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61784/61784equ04v2.jpg",
    "Adjust the antibody concentration to keep the total protein concentration in the sample within the 10 nM and 50 nM range. Best results are obtained using mixtures with antibody concentrations between 5 nM and 25 nM.\n\tNOTE: MP detects proteins with a molecular mass larger than 40 kDa. Consequently, sample concentrations of antigens with a molecular mass smaller than 40 kDa can exceed the typical 50 nM limit. However, at concentrations higher than approximately 100 nM, even low molecular mass antigens might affect the image quality and accuracy of the Kd determination.\nPrepare 50 µL of the antibody-antigen mixture at its final measurement concentration calculated in step 2.3.\n\tNOTE: Only one sample of the antigen-antibody mixture is required for the Kd determination. However, preparing several samples with different antigen to antibody ratios can help optimize sample concentration. If data from several samples are collected, they can be analyzed via a global fit.\nIncubate the antigen-antibody mixture(s) for approximately 10 min at room temperature to allow the binding reaction to reach chemical equilibrium. Avoid unnecessarily long incubation times.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time may vary depending on the binding kinetics. To confirm that the chemical equilibrium has been reached, sample measurements can be repeated at different incubation times. Time-invariant Kd values indicate sufficiently long incubation. Prolonged incubation may lead to significant protein adsorption to the surface of the plastic labware and, consequently, to significant errors in the protein concentration determination. For this reason, low-adhesion labware is strongly recommended for MP sample preparation13.\n3. Collect the Mass Photometry data\nApply a drop of microscope immersion oil on the MP instrument objective and place the assembled flow chamber on the microscope stage. Make sure the oil spans the gap between the coverslip and the objective.\nLoad the flow chamber and focus the mass photometer.",
    "Deposit 10 µL of a clean, filtered buffer solution at one end of the flow chamber channel prepared in step 1. Liquid will enter the channel by capillary action.\nAdjust the stage’s Z-position to focus the microscope on the working surface of the 24 x 50 mm coverslip.\n\t\t\nIn the Focus Control tab of the data collection software, use the coarse stage movement Up and Down buttons to make the initial adjustments.\nClick the Sharpness button to show the sharpness signal readout and use the fine Up and Down adjustment buttons to maximize the Sharpness value.\nClick the Set Focus and Lock Focus buttons to activate the focus tracking function. A properly focused image (Figure 1A,C) should have the “signal” value below 0.05%.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the “signal” value at the maximum sharpness position is above 0.05%, this may indicate impurities on the glass surface or in the buffer.\nUsing the same channel, load 20 µL of the antibody-antigen sample by depositing it on one side of the channel and blotting the liquid from the other end with a small piece of blotting paper (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: The volume of a 3–5 mm wide channel is approximately 10 µL. The additional sample volume is recommended to completely replace the buffer present in the channel and to avoid sample dilution.\nAfter loading the sample, immediately click the Record button to start data collection, acquiring a 100 s video (Figure 1D).\nAt the end of the data collection enter the file name and click OK to save the data file.\nDiscard the coverslips and wipe the oil from the objective lens with cotton optical swabs wet with isopropanol.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Analyze the MP data",
    "Process the collected video file using the MP data processing software to identify the landing events.\n\t\nUse the File/Open menu option to load the file for the analysis and click Analyze.\nClick the Load button to load the calibration function and save the analyzed data using the File/Save Results As menu option.\nFit the molecular mass distribution with Gaussian functions to obtain relative concentrations of each species in the sample. This analysis can be performed using a common scientific graphing software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nImport the “eventsFitted.csv” file into the software and plot the molecular mass distribution (column M in the .csv file) using the Plot/Statistics/Histogram function.\nDouble click on the histogram to open the Plot Properties window. Disable automatic binning and select a bin size of 2.5 kDa. Click the Apply and the Go buttons to create the Bin Centers and Counts data.\nSelect the Bin Centers and Counts columns and use the Analysis/Peaks and Baseline/Multiple Peak Fit menu function to fit the histogram with Gaussian functions. Double click to indicate the approximate peak positions on the distribution plot and then click the Open NLFit button.\nCheck the Fixed checkboxes for the “xc” peak centers and set their values to the expected molecular masses of the free antibody and the single and double antigen-antibody complexes. Check the Share option for the width parameters. Click the Fit button. The fitted peak height values of the Gaussian components represent the relative concentration of each species in the sample11.\n\t\tNOTE: Bin size may be adjusted to optimize the resolution of the mass distribution plot. The MP precision limit is approximately 1 kDa, and smaller bin sizes might amplify the noise of the distribution, while not revealing any additional information. Very large bin sizes will obscure the fine details of mass distributions.",
    "Calculate the concentration fraction of each species using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61784/61784equ05v2.jpg\n\twhere the hi and fi values represent peak heights and concentration fractions of the free antibody and the single- and double-bound antibody in the sample, respectively.\n5. Calculate equilibrium constant values\nFit the concentration fractions of the interaction species calculated in step 4.3 with Eq. 1 and 2 using a suitable analytical software. Here we demonstrate a method to calculate equilibrium constants using a spreadsheet program14 (see Supplementary Information).\n\t\nOpen the “Kd calculation.xlsx” worksheet. In this worksheet, the cell values in rows 1 to 10 highlighted in yellow can be modified to perform the equilibrium constants calculations.\nEnter the estimated Kd values in nanomolar units into cells B1 and B2 in the table. Those starting values will be optimized in the fitting procedure. If the estimated Kd values are not known, leave the default values in cells B1 and B2 unchanged.\nEnter the values of (cAb)tot and (cAg)tot in nanomolar units into cells D2 and E2. Enter the fraction values calculated in step 4.3 into cells F2, G2, and H2. If multiple samples at different concentration ratios were measured, additional concentration values obtained for those samples can be entered in rows 2 to 10.\nSelect the Data/Solver menu function. Enter “$B$15” in the “Set Objective” box and “$B$1:$B$2” into the “By Changing Variable Cells:” box. Select the Min radio button for the To: option. Check the Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative checkbox and select GRG Nonlinear as the solving method. Click the Solve button. The best fit Kd1 and Kd2 values will be shown in cell B1 and B2 and the final sum of squared errors in cell B15.",
    "NOTE: If the Solver function is not active, select Options under the File menu in the spreadsheet program. In the Add-ins category select the Solver Add-in under the Inactive Application Add-ins and click the Go button. Check the Solver Add-in checkbox and click OK.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61784/61784fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Mass photometry images. (A) Representative native view image of the imaging buffer collected on a clean coverslip and (B) on a coverslip with surface imperfections.
