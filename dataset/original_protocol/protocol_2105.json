    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nReagent preparation and determination of the solubility of test chemicals\nTiming: 1 day\nDissolve each test chemical in an appropriate solvent, either PBS or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), according to the ECVAM study (Genschow et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Because chemicals dissolved in DMSO are poorly water-soluble, check the concentration at which they can be dissolved in the culture medium.\nSelect appropriate stock solvents for each chemical based on the manufacturer’s datasheet, and prepare the stock at a soluble concentration. Determine storage temperature and duration in accordance with the datasheet.\nDilute stocks of chemicals with low water solubility in the culture medium and check for precipitation.\nDilute each chemical stock 100-fold in StemFlex medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min and visually check for precipitation. If precipitation is observed rather than dissolution, dilute the stock solution with DMSO and then dilute 100-fold in the medium.\nCell lines and culture conditions\nTiming: 2 weeks\nHuman iPSC line 201B7 (RIKEN Cell Bank, Japan) was routinely cultured in StemFlex medium (A3349401, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on culture plates coated with Geltrex Matrix (A1413202, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nGeltrex coating of culture wells.\nRemove Geltrex from the −80°C freezer and thaw on ice.\nMix ice-cold DMEM/F-12 and Geltrex at a ratio of 100:1 and add the Geltrex solution to culture wells in the following volumes:       35 mm dish and 6-well plate: 1.5 mL/well.       12-well plate: 600 μL/well.       24-well plate: 300 μL/well.       48-well plate: 150 μL/well.       96-well plate: 60 μL/well.\nIncubate the culture plate with 1% Geltrex solution at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for at least 1 h for coating.",
    "Note: To avoid repeated freezing and thawing, dispense into microtubes according to the volume used. Geltrex can be stored at 4°C for up to one week and at −80°C for up to six months. Make sure the Geltrex does not form bubbles.\nThaw the frozen stock of iPS cells.\nPre-warm StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632) to 37°C in a water bath.\nRemove the vial of cells from the storage container and quickly thaw in a 37°C water bath. Alternatively, add 1 mL of StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632) to the vial if the stock volume is less than 200 μL, and thaw by pipetting gently.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube pre-filled with 4 mL of StemFlex medium and centrifuge at 200 × g for 4 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in fresh StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632).\nDiscard the Geltrex solution from the pre-coated wells and seed the cells in culture plates at the following densities:       35 mm dish and 6-well plate: 1.25 × 105 cells/well.\nThe following day, change the medium to StemFlex medium if few single cells are present.\nClump passaging of iPS cells using Versene Solution. Following the recovery of the cells, start a culture in which the first passages are clumping passages to maintain cell-cell adhesion. Carry out passages when 60%–80% confluency is reached.\nPlace the 6-well plate with 1% Geltrex solution in a CO2 incubator in advance and incubate at 37°C for at least 1 h for coating.\nPre-warm StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632) to 37°C in a water bath, and equilibrate PBS and Versene Solution to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDiscard the medium from the culture wells and wash the wells once with 2 mL of PBS.",
    "Add 1 mL of Versene Solution to the wells and let stand at room temperature for 5–8 min.\nDiscard the Versene Solution and wash the wells 4–5 times with medium to remove the cells.\nDiscard the Geltrex solution from the pre-coated wells and add a 1/5 volume of the cell suspension to the wells.\nSingle passage of iPS cells using TrypLE Select Solution. The second and subsequent passages are made by dispersion into single cells; passages are carried out when 60%–80% confluency is reached.\nPlace the 6-well plate with 1% Geltrex solution in a CO2 incubator in advance and incubate at 37°C for at least 1 h for coating.\nPre-warm StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632) to 37°C in a water bath, and equilibrate PBS and TrypLE Select Solution to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDiscard the medium from the culture wells and wash once with 2 mL of PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE Select Solution to the wells and let stand at room temperature for 5 min.\nWhen cell adhesion is observed to weaken under a microscope, remove cells by gently pipetting 5–10 times with a 1000 μL pipette and collect the cells in a 15 mL tube pre-filled with 4 mL of StemFlex medium.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 4 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and loosen the pellet by tapping 3–5 times.\nSuspend the cells in 2 mL of StemFlex medium (+ 10 μM Y-27632) and pipette 5–10 times.\nTake a subset of the cell suspension and mix it 1:1 with trypan blue to measure the number of viable cells.",
    "Discard the Geltrex solution from the pre-coated wells and seed the cells in the wells at the following densities:       35 mm dish and 6-well plate: 1.25 × 105 cells/well.       12-well plate: 5.0 × 104 cells/well.       24-well plate: 2.5 × 104 cells/well.\nIf the cells reach greater than 10% confluency the following day, change the medium to StemFlex medium.\nNote: In an attempt to minimize the time spent on cell counting to prevent cell viability from declining and to reduce the variability of cell counts, it is recommended that replicate measurements be performed using a cell counter. If counting cells manually, dilution of the cell suspension is recommended to shorten the cell counting time.\nCytotoxicity test\nTiming: 5–7 days\nTo distinguish whether a chemical has a specific adverse effect on the FGF signaling pathway, it is necessary to show that the effect occurs at concentrations lower than those that cause severe cell injury. Therefore, prior to evaluating the effects of chemicals on signaling pathways, the relationship between the chemical concentration and cell viability must be evaluated.\nSeed the established cell lines in Geltrex-coated flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates at a viable cell density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well.\nNote: Because evaporation of the culture medium may adversely affect the assay, fill the outermost wells of a 96-well plate with sterile water and only use the central 60 wells for the assay.\nThe following day, replace the medium with 100 μL/well of StemFlex medium.\nWhen 40%–60% confluency is reached, perform the cytotoxicity test. Immediately prior to the addition of the chemical, replace the medium with 100 μL/well of StemFlex medium.",
    "Add the chemical stock to the StemFlex medium so that the final concentration of the solvent, PBS or DMSO, is at an upper limit of 10% and 1%, respectively. This will result in a solvent concentration with an upper limit of 1% and 0.1% for PBS and DMSO, respectively, after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals that are not fully soluble in the medium due to low water solubility, mix the chemical stock with DMSO and then add to StemFlex medium at the final concentration determined by the solubility test. The final concentration of DMSO in the medium should also be 1% in this case.\nNote: The maximum concentration of the chemical to be used in the toxicity study was set at 1000 μg/mL in a previous study (Genschow et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, 10000 μg/mL is the upper concentration limit of the chemical solution before addition. This will result in a final concentration of 1000 μg/mL after addition to the wells.\nFurther, dilute the test chemical solution from step 10 with StemFlex medium to make a 2-fold dilution series and add 11 μL to each well. For non-treated groups, provide a final concentration of 1% PBS or 0.1% DMSO, depending on the solvent used for the test chemical. (0 h).\nTwenty hours after the addition of the test chemical, add 10 μL/well of CCK-8, followed by incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. For all tests, prepare a cell-free control as a blank with only CCK-8 reagent added to the medium. (20 h).\nMeasure the absorbance at 450 nm in each well 4 h after CCK-8 addition. (24 h).",
    "Note: Similar to the CCK-8 assay, MTT assay and resazurin assay can also be used to evaluate cell growth inhibition caused by chemical exposure with the reduced activity of living cells as an indicator.\nSubtract the absorbance of the blank from that of each sample well. Compare the absorbance readings obtained under the experimental conditions with those of the vehicle control group and calculate the cell viability as follows:\n  C e l l  v i a b i l i t y =   A b  s  s a m p l e   − A b  s  b l a n k     A b  s  v e h i c l e   − A b  s  b l a n k      \nPerform a total of at least three biological replicates and calculate the relationship between drug concentration and cell viability. Then, fit a four-parameter Log-Logistic curve using the LL.4 model of the drc package, an R language program, to estimate the 50% inhibitory concentration of viability (IC50).\nSignal disruption assay\nTiming: 6 days\nFour days before adding the ligand, seed the established cell lines in 96-well white plates at 1.0 × 104 cells/well.\nNote: Because evaporation of the culture medium may adversely affect the assay, fill the outermost wells of a 96-well plate with sterile water and use only the central 60 wells for the assay.\nThe following day, replace the medium with 200 μL/well of StemFlex medium.\nThe day before ligand addition, replace the medium with 100 μL/well of APEL2 medium.\nNote: StemFlex medium contains a variety of growth factors, including bFGF. To minimize the influence of components of the medium and to reproducibly assess FGF signal disruption, a recombinant protein-based medium that does not contain animal products such as bFGF should be used for the assay.",
    "Replace the medium with 100 μL/well of APEL2 medium (+1% endurazine) at least 2 h before adding the test chemical.\nNote: It takes 2 h for the luminescent substrate to equilibrate in/out of the cell.\nMeasure the luminescence intensity of each well immediately before adding the chemical.\nAdd the chemical stock to APEL2 medium so that the final concentration of the solvent, PBS or DMSO, is at an upper limit of 10% and 1%, respectively. This will result in a solvent concentration with an upper limit of 1% and 0.1% for PBS and DMSO, respectively, after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals that do not completely dissolve in the medium due to low water solubility, the chemical stock should be mixed with DMSO and then added to the APEL2 medium at the final concentration determined by the solubility test described above. In this case, the final concentration of DMSO in the medium should also be 1%.\nNote: The maximum concentration of chemicals to be used in the toxicity study was set to 1000 μg/mL in a previous study (Genschow et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, 10000 μg/mL is the upper concentration limit of the chemical solution before addition. This will result in a final concentration of 1000 μg/mL after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals with strong cytotoxicity, the half growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) estimated from the cytotoxicity test should be used as the final concentration after addition to the wells.\nFurther, dilute the test chemical solution from step 21 with APEL2 medium to make a 2-fold dilution series with a total of 8 concentrations per chemical and add 11 μL to each well. For non-treated groups, administer a final concentration of 1% PBS or 0.1% DMSO, depending on the solvent of the test chemical. (-1 h).",
    "Measure the luminescence intensity of each well immediately before ligand addition.\nAdd 12 μL/well of bFGF diluted to 20 ng/mL in APEL2 medium to a final concentration of 2 ng/mL. For non-treated groups, prepare a solution of PBS (+ 0.1% BSA) and the bFGF solvent diluted 1000-fold in APEL2 medium and add 12 μL/well. (0 h).\nMeasure the luminescence intensity of each well at repeated time intervals. The manufacturer’s manual indicates that the luminescence can be stably detected for up to 72 h.
