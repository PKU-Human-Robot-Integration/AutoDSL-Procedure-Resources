PBS (or FertiCult) or take pre-prepared tubes out of fridge.\nIf using pre-prepared tubes, check the solution preparation date noted on the tube. The medium expires 3 months after the indicated date.\nLabel the tubes with the subject’s identification/reference number and the date of sampling, put aside.\nFill in the information sheet provided (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1679-Mmc1.pdf]) with the subject’s identification number/tag, the genotype and if possible, information concerning the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacterial strains isolated from the subject.\nPrepare the sampling equipment:\nSterilized nose speculum (can be sterilized with 70% ethanol or other approved sterilizing solution that is not harmful to humans).\nSterilized Politzer tweezers (tweezers are pre-sterilized; if these are not available, they can be sterilized with 70% ethanol or other approved sterilizing solution that is not harmful to humans).",
    "Assemble 4 flat cotton meshes: these will be used to apply the local anesthetic to the nasal turbinate. Assemble two meshes approximately 5 cm and two meshes approximately 10 cm long (the longer ones will be used in the 2nd application, as they have to reach further back into the nostril area at the following point 3c). Roll the proximal end rolled into a cone, in order to introduce the mesh as far as possible up the subject’s nose (4 meshes in total per subject) (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1679-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Nasal brushing technique, related to step 4\nThe brushing should take place at the lower turbinate in the middle third (the anterior third is covered with non-ciliated epithelium).\nBrush with five to ten rotational and linear movements.\nNote: The subject may feel a localized tingling sensation in their nostrils and the brushing will probably cause some eye watering, but this discomfort will pass rapidly.\nRemove the brush from the nostril.",
    "Place the brush in tube with sterile PBS (or in the 2nd 15 mL tube with FertiCult if being sent to an alternative institution for testing) and shake the brush vigorously in the medium for 15 s.\nIf an endoscopy brush is used, it is possible to “sweep/scrape” the brush using the plastic sheath. Normally one should see mucosal fragments floating in the solution.\nAt a minimum, obtain one brushing per nostril. Ideally, brush each nostril twice, if possible (the same brush can be used for subsequent brushings of the same nostril).\nWhen the last brushing has been completed, shake the brush in the labeled tube and leave it inside. Cut the remaining wire if needed to allow the brush to fit entirely into the tube. Seal the labeled tube and set aside (preferably on ice or in the fridge).\nRepeat the procedure with the other nostril.\nIf the tube containing FertiCult was used and the sample is meant to be sent to another center, add 0.1 mL of antibiotic solution to each of the labeled tubes containing the samples (using a sterile procedure, if possible).\nThe labeled tubes with PBS are now ready for culture (and the labeled tubes with FertiCult for shipping). Deliver biological material to the laboratory as soon as possible, preferably on wet ice. If the brushes are kept in the Ferticult, the tubes can be transported at room temperature (18°C–23°C) within a 48-h time window.\nPreparation of the sample before expansion: (30 min). After collection of the samples from the subject, the preparatory steps are as follows:\nTry to remove as many cells as possible from the brush. One can use the sheath from the wire, on which the brush is attached, to isolate the cells. Once cells are removed, the brush can be discarded.",
    "Centrifuge the content of the tubes at 500 × g, 5 min, and 4°C.\nGently aspirate the supernatant avoiding touching the pellet and discard the liquid.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Trypsin (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]: Aliquots), resuspend the cells, and leave for 5–7 min in the incubator at 37°C.\nAdd 1 mL of amplification medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for preparation) to stop the enzymatic process. Combine the content of the two tubes and mix gently.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate and discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in the 1 mL of amplification medium.\nEvenly distribute the cell suspension into collagen-coated flasks (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for preparation) containing:\n10 mL of amplification medium (75 cm2 flask).\n5 mL of amplification medium (25 cm2 flask).\nNote: This step defines Passage 0 of the cell culture.\nPut the flask into the incubator at 37°C until the following day. In the most optimal conditions, it is advisable to check cells 24 h after culture initiation, allow a minimum of 12 h for the cell adhesion.\nNote: Amplification of the cells usually takes between 3–5 days after starting the culture, if the proliferation of the cells takes longer than a week, there is a risk that the cells will not grow successfully.\nNote: As a rule, a standard brush procedure (2 brushings per nostril and the 2 nostrils sampled) will allow one 75 cm2 flask to be seeded.\nA brushing of a single nostril can be seeded in one 25 cm2 flask.",
    "Lung Explant Samples (2 days: Day 1: 1–1.5 h). Lung explant samples (from normal or diseased lungs) are surgically supplied; it is not the remit of this manuscript to provide detailed guidance on sampling of lung explants. Briefly, bronchi after lobectomy or pneumonectomy or samples taken during lung transplantation are the sources of bronchial endothelial cells. The lung specimens are transported to the laboratory in a container filled with the PBS or culture medium, on wet ice. The lung explants should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible, ideally within 24 h.\nNote: Thaw the Pronase and prepare the medium in advance (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment], Dissociation Media).\nPronase is a commercially available mixture of proteases, used to help dissociate cells.\nAfter receiving the lung explant, the whole lung explant sample, including the transport media should be added (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]: Transport medium) into the 10 cm Petri dish (all procedures to be conducted in sterile conditions).\nUse a scalpel blade (for this procedure, a disposable lab scalpel blade can be used with a plastic handle or as an alternative, disposable stainless-steel lancets individually foil wrapped) to remove and discard the necrotic parts of the bronchi and put the cleaned piece of the bronchi into the empty 50 mL tube (see Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1679-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

Thus, early exposure of the human tissue to the antibiotics is of great importance.\nAfter repeated step ii., fill the tube containing the explant with 14 mL of the pre-prepared DMEM/F12-FTVC medium (from the 50 mL tube, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]: Dissociation Media), to prevent the bronchi from drying out.\nDissociation of the airway epithelial cells:\nAdd 4 mL of Pronase to the 50 mL tube containing now only 36 mL of DMEM/F12-FTVC.\nAspirate the 14 mL of medium from step d.\nTransfer the bronchi into the DMEM/F12-FTVC-Pronase solution.\nIncubate the bronchi over night at 4°C on a rotator (12 h for best results, possible minimal time of 4 h at 10–20 rpm - if it is possible to adjust it, as there may only be one speed set by default).\nPause point: NEXT DAY (Day 2: task will take approximately 1–1.5 h).\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tube containing the bronchi: 500 × g, 5 min, and 4°C.\nGently aspirate the supernatant, leaving 20 mL in the tube. Do not discard that 20 mL but pass it through the autoclaved stainless strainer at 100 μm pore size minimum to the 50 mL container/tube.\nAdd 20 mL of DMEM/F12-FBS20%-FTVC medium to neutralize the remaining Pronase.\nShake to mix well, then vortex for 2 min.\nPut the content of the tube (bronchi and medium) into a 15 cm Petri dish.\nThen bisect the lung explant with the sterile scalpel.",

Polyp samples may be obtained from the surgical intervention known as a polypectomy. This surgical procedure can be offered to patients with isolated or syndromic nasal sinus polyposis, resistant to medical treatment and who present as symptomatic with nasal obstruction, smell disorder, chronic rhinorrhea, or repeated sinus infections. Specimens obtained from patients without cystic fibrosis are used as Wild Type (WT). The polypectomy is often associated with the opening of the sinuses. It is an endoscopic intervention, that is, through the nasal cavity with a camera. It is performed under general anesthesia. The patient leaves the evening or the day after the operation. The polyps are then transported in sterile PBS or culture medium in the 50 mL tube on wet ice.\nThaw the Pronase and prepare the dissociation media in advance (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nAspirate transport medium (be careful to not aspirate small polyps).\nPlace the polyp in an empty 50 mL falcon tube.\nWash the polyp to eliminate blood cells:\nAdd 25 mL of PBS-DTT to the polyp and shake manually for 1 min.\nAspirate medium.\nRepeat the steps i. and ii.\nNote: DDT solution helps to remove excess mucus and lower the potential bacterial impact on contamination of the sample.",

Measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)\nFor resistance measurements (according to the manufacturer manual):\nTurn the Power on, on the EVOM2.\nSterilize the electrode with 70% ethanol (submerge the electrodes for several seconds) and air dry.\nConnect the electrode to the meter.\nSet the Function switch to Ohms.\nTurn the Mode Switch to R.\nTurn the range switch to 20k (kΩ, ×1000 = Ω).\nMeasure the blank resistance and record the value (R blank).",
    "The short electrode should be placed in the insert (apical compartment), the longer arm of the electrode is located in the basolateral compartment.\nAll movement should be performed gently to avoid damage of the cell monolayer.\nPush the measure R button.\nRecord the given number which will be expressed in kΩ.\nMeasure the sample (R sample) in the same manner. It is advisable to perform the measurements in duplicates.\nPerform the measurements in rather fast pace as the temperature may impact the results (one method to minimize temperature-induced variability in TEER measurements between samples is to place the culture plate on a pre-warmed 37°C heat block during measurements).\nTo obtain the reading: (R (sample) Ω - R (blank) Ω) × 0.33 cm2 (membrane area).\nClean, dry and store the electrode.\nNote: If evaluation of epithelia by TEER is conducted when the cells are already under ALI conditions, sterile physiological saline solution should be added on the apical side to allow electrical contact with the electrode. A volume of solution sufficient to allow insertion of the apical electrode should be used (∼100 μL). After measurement, the saline solution must be removed to return to ALI condition.\nFor further guidance, please refer to: https://www.wpiinc.com/media/wysiwyg/pdf/EVOM2_IM.pdf[href=https://www.wpiinc.com/media/wysiwyg/pdf/EVOM2_IM.pdf] (the meter models may differ).\nFreezing cells (Depending on number of flasks from 30 min to 1.5 h).\nPrepare freezing medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPrepare cryotubes with the name of the subject/identification number (as per local site policy), site ID, the type of cells, passage number, date of freezing, initials of the person performing the freezing and if possible, the number of frozen cells.\nFreeze cells at P0 and at no higher than P2.\nChoose a 75 cm2 flask of cells (P0-P2) at 80%–90% confluence.\nAspirate and discard the medium from the flask.",
    "Add 10 mL of PBS.\nRemove the PBS (the purpose of steps f and g is to remove residual medium from the flask).\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin and put into incubator for 7 min.\nTap the flask, with the palm of your hand, to help the cells detach. One should keep the flask in a horizontal position to avoid spreading the suspension.\nTo stop the trypsin activity, add 10 mL of amplification medium.\nRinse the cell-growing surface well.\nRepeat the process several times trying to produce a strong flow in order to detach as many cells as possible.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g, 4°C, and 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in a sufficient (refer to the pellet size) amount of the regular medium. Count the cells and spin the whole content of the tube.\nIn each cryovial, freeze around 1–2 × 106 cells per 1 mL of freezing medium.\nResuspend the cells in the desired amount of freezing medium. Re-distribute equal amounts of cell suspension to each cryotube.\nPlace the cryovials in Mr. Frosty (Nalgene) and put into a −80°C freezer.\nThe next day, move the preserved sample to the nitrogen storage container, where the cells can be kept for many years.\nDefrosting (30 min).\nPrepare the materials needed:\nWarm up the water bath to 37°C.\nPrepare the amplification medium.\nWarm up the medium to 37°C.\n15 mL tube(s) and 75 cm2 flask(s).\nRemove cryovials from the nitrogen storage tank.\nLeave the cryotube for a few minutes in the water bath (up to 2 min), taking care not to submerge the whole vial in the water.\nNote the label on the vial before wiping it with alcohol, to avoid losing the information from the cryotube.",
    "Using a 1 mL pipette, transfer the defrosted cells to the empty 15 mL tube.\nIn a drop-wise manner, add 1 mL of the warm amplification medium.\nAfter one minute, again add 1 mL of amplification medium and wait an additional minute.\nNext fill the tube with 10 mL of amplification medium and centrifuge for 2 min at 230 × g.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nCheck what number of frozen cells is indicated on the cryovial. Resuspend the cell pellet in the volume of amplification medium required to achieve, at least, a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nPut the cell suspension into the flask(s) containing a sufficient amount of the medium, as follows:\n75 cm2 flask: seed up to 2 million cells to a total volume of 10 mL amplification medium.\n150 cm2 flask, seed up to 4 million cells to a total volume of 15 mL amplification medium.\nPlace the flasks in the 37°C incubator and observe cell expansion over the course of the next 2–3 days.\nEND OF PROCEDURE."
