    "1. Chip mask preparation\nNOTE: Steps 1.1 - 1.3 only need to be performed once upon initial receipt of the chip mask. They ensure the mask does not bow during use. The design of the microfluidic masks was previously described11,14. Masks were designed in-house and commercially fabricated using high resolution stereolithography (Figure 1A).\nCover the top surface of the mask with plastic sheeting to protect this surface from adhesive. Secure the chip mask to an equally sized acrylic sheet using spray adhesive. Clamp the pieces together overnight to allow the adhesive to fully cure. After the adhesive is dry, remove the plastic sheeting from the top of the mask.\nAttach the bottom of the acrylic sheet to a 3D printed leveling box (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Files 1-4) using double-sided tape. Press firmly to ensure a tight bond.\nSeal any small openings near the detachable wall of the leveling box with a waterproof sealant. Allow the sealant to cure for 24 h.\nClean the surface of the mask with 70% ethanol (EtOH). Place the leveling box with the desired chip mask in the oven. Use a digital protractor to ensure the top of the mask is level. Adjust the leveling screws if necessary.\n2. PDMS fabrication\nNOTE: A shallow-well (1 mm) chip design is used for functional activity (formation and resorption) assays, and a deep-well (10 mm) chip design is used for mechanical loading studies. The bottom of the deep-well is formed by attaching a separate thin PDMS membrane (Figure 1B).\nLid layer (Layer 1)\n\t\nCombine 63 g of PDMS prepolymer and 6.3 g of curing agent (10:1 ratio) in a plastic cup. Mix thoroughly with a disposable cell spatula and degas in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min.",
    "Slowly pour mixture into the prepared leveling box. Let the PDMS sit for 30 min and then bake at 45 °C for 18 h.\nLoosen the edges of the PDMS with a tapered laboratory spatula and remove the polymer sheet from leveling box.\nCut individual lids to size (70 mm x 34 mm) using a scalpel and a 3D printed template.\nPunch access holes through each lid with a biopsy punch (1 mm diameter).\nSurface clean the lids with packaging tape.\n\t\tNOTE: If the lids are not being used immediately, wrap each in packaging tape and store at room temperature (RT).\nWell and microchannel layer (Layer 2)\n\t\nCombine the PDMS prepolymer and curing agent (10:1 ratio) in a plastic cup. The shallow-well design requires 43 g of prepolymer and 4.3 g of curing agent, and the deep-well design requires 227 g of prepolymer and 22.7 g of curing agent. Mix the polymer vigorously and degas for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This assumes a mask dimension of 152.4 mm x 152.4 mm.\nSlowly pour mixture over appropriate pre-leveled mask. Let the PDMS sit for 30 min and then bake at 45 °C for 18 h.\nLoosen the edges of the PDMS with a tapered laboratory spatula and carefully peel the polymer away from the mask. Use a scalpel and 3D printed template to cut out individual chips.\n\t\tNOTE: For loading studies it is important that the chip dimensions (70 x 34 mm) are precise and that the well is located in the center of the chip.\nSurface clean the PDMS with packaging tape.\n\t\tNOTE: If the chips are not being used immediately, wrap each chip in packaging tape and store at RT.\nThin PDMS membrane (Layer 3)\n\tNOTE: This layer is only used for the deep-well design.",
    "Add 12.7 g of PDMS prepolymer and 1.3 g of curing agent (10:1 ratio) to a plastic cup. Mix vigorously and degas for 30 min.\nSlowly pour polymer into prepared leveling box and thoroughly scrape plastic cup to remove as much PDMS as possible.\nUse cell spatula to spread PDMS over entire surface.\n\t\tNOTE: If the polymer is not manually spread out, surface tension will be sufficient to prevent the polymer from forming a uniform sheet.\nLet the PDMS sit for 30 min and then bake at 45 °C for 18 h.\nLoosen the edges of the PDMS with a tapered spatula and carefully remove the PDMS sheet from the leveling box. Cut individual membranes that match the dimensions of layer 2.\nMeasure the membrane thickness at the center of the membrane using calipers. Discard any membranes that are outside of the desired thickness (0.5 mm ± 0.1 mm).\nCarefully clean membranes with packaging tape and place on a piece of paraffin film.\n\t\tNOTE: If the membranes are not being used immediately, cover the top of the membrane with packaging tape and store at RT.\n3. Functional activity substrates\nNOTE: Polystyrene discs and bone wafers must be attached to the bottom of wells that will be used for osteoblast and osteoclast cultures, respectively.\nPolystyrene discs (Figure 1C)\n\t\nPlace masking tape on the back side of a tissue culture treated polystyrene coverslip. Cut circular discs from the coverslip using a sharpened cork-borer (5.4 mm diameter). Submerge the discs in 70% EtOH and leave overnight.\nGently scrub the top surface of the disc with a cotton tipped applicator soaked in 70% EtOH. Ensure that the outer edge of the disc is thoroughly cleaned.",
    "Using two pairs of forceps, hold the disc and remove the masking tape backing. Place the disc treated side down and clean the back side with a cotton tipped applicator.\nDip the wooden end of a cotton tipped applicator into a degassed mixture of uncured PDMS and place a small amount of the polymer on the bottom of the desired well.\n\t\tNOTE: Remaining uncured PDMS can be stored at -20 °C.\nPlace the polystyrene disc, treated side up, into the well and gently press down on the disc with a cotton swab. Ensure that no uncured PDMS comes in contact with the treated side of the disc.\n\t\tNOTE: If PDMS does come in contact with the treated surface of the disc, remove the disc from the well and repeat steps 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 with a new disc.\nLet the chip sit on a level surface for 30 min and then bake at 65 °C for 4 h.\nBone wafers\n\t\nUse forceps to place a bone wafer (6 mm diameter, 0.4 mm thick) on the bottom of a 100 mm dish. Hold the wafer steady with the forceps and gently etch an 'X' on the back of the wafer with a scalpel.\n\t\tNOTE: During the imaging process, the 'X' is used to distinguish between the back of the wafer and the surface on which cells were seeded.\nUse the wooden end of a cotton tipped applicator to add a small amount of uncured PDMS to the bottom of the desired well. Place the bone wafer, marked side down, into the well and use a cotton tipped applicator to press the wafer down.\nLet the chip sit on a level surface for 30 min and then bake at 65 °C for 4 h.\n4. Chip assembly and sterilization",
    "Activate the surfaces of layer 1 and layer 2 with a plasma cleaner for 30 s using a medium radio frequency (RF) power setting (equivalent to approximately 10.2 W).\nAlign the access holes in layer 1 with the microchannels in layer 2 and firmly press the two layers together.\nFor the deep-well design, repeat step 4.1 with layer 2 and layer 3. During the plasma treatment, use double-sided tape to attach the paraffin film of layer 3 to a flat surface.\nUse a scalpel to trim off excess material from the PDMS membrane. Carefully peel away the sheet of paraffin film from the bottom of the chip\nBake the chip at 65 °C for 10 min to increase bond strength between the PDMS layers.\nInsert angled dispensing tips (18 Gauge, 0.5 in, 90°) into the access holes in the lid. Secure the dispensing tips to the lid with a two part epoxy. Use a micropipette tip to apply the epoxy around each dispensing tip.\nAfter the epoxy has fully cured, surface clean the chip with 70% EtOH and place in a biosafety cabinet. Perform all subsequent steps within the biosafety cabinet.\nConnect a 5 mL syringe to the dispensing tips with sterile silicone tubing (1/32'' ID, ~10 cm in length) and fill the entire chip with 70% EtOH for at least 30 s. For the shallow-well design, administer all liquids with a syringe pump set to a flow rate of 4 mL/h. For the deep-well design, administer all liquids by slowly dispensing the syringe by hand.\nRemove the EtOH from the chip and sterilize the chip with UV light overnight.\nWash the chip 3 times with dH2O. Fill the chip with dH2O, remove tubing from the dispensing tips and incubate for at least 48 h at 37 °C.",
    "5. Mechanical loading device assembly\nNOTE: The design and fabrication processes for the 3D printed mechanical loading device (Figure 2A-C) were previously described and all design files for printed components have been previously provided13.\nAutoclave all components of the loading device for 30 min at 121 °C.\n\tNOTE: To avoid warping of printed components, wrap each piece individually in foil and place on a hard flat surface during the autoclaving process. Metal hardware can be wrapped together. Complete all subsequent steps within a biosafety cabinet.\nPlace a compression spring around the shaft of the platen and insert the platen into the central hole on the bottom of the base (Figure 2D).\nAttach the dial block to the bottom of the base using four self-tapping screws.\nPlace a second compression spring around the central screw. Insert the screw into the hexagonal-shaped hole in the bottom of the dial and screw the assembly into the threaded hole in the center of the dial block.\nScrew four male-female standoffs into the bottom of the base.\nRemove slack from the device by turning the dial counterclockwise until the top of the platen is below the top of the base. Then slowly turn the dial clockwise until the top of the platen is level with the top of the base.\n6. Experimentation\nNOTE: Protocols for functional activity experiments were previously provided11,12.\nLoading studies (Figure 3)\n\t\nFollowing step 4.9, use a 5 mL syringe to remove dH2O from the deep-well chip. Coat the bottom of the well with 200 µL of 0.15 mg/mL type I collagen (CTI) in 0.02 M acetic acid for 1 h.\nRinse the chip three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with calcium and magnesium (DPBS++).",
    "Place chip into the chip holder and seed with MLO-Y4 osteocytes at a density of 2 x 104 cells/mL in minimum essential alpha medium (MEMα) supplemented with 5% calf serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nRemove the tubing from the dispensing tips and place the chip into a deep-well culture dish (150 mm x 25 mm). Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 72 h.\nAttach sterile tubing to dispensing tips and use a 5 mL syringe to remove spent culture medium from the chip. Slowly dispense in fresh culture medium to refill the chip.\nPlace the chip holder into the rectangular inset on the top of the loading device base. Feed the tubing through the slots located on the loading device lid and secure the lid to the base with four pan head screws and hex nuts.\n\t\tNOTE: To ensure that the lid remains level, first secure two screws that are located diagonally from one another before securing the remaining two screws.\nApply load to the cells by turning the dial clockwise until the desired platen displacement is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: The device is designed so that one rotation of the dial equates to a platen displacement of 1 mm. The strain field generated on the top of the PDMS membrane was previously modeled as a function of platen displacement using finite element analysis (FEA)13.\nPlace the loading device into an empty P1000 micropipette tip box. Incubate the cells with the applied load for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The loading time period used here serves as an example. Alternative loading times can be used.",
    "Following incubation, remove the load from the cells by turning the dial counterclockwise until the platen returns to the original starting position. Remove the lid from the device and place the chip holder into the deep-well culture plate. Incubate the cells for a 90-min post load recovery period.\n\t\tNOTE: Again, the recovery time period used here serves as an example. Alternative recovery times can be used. For long term studies, feed cells every 72 h.\nUse a 5 mL syringe to remove the conditioned medium from the chip.\n\t\tNOTE: This medium can be saved and stored at -80 °C.\nRemove the chip from the chip holder and use a tapered spatula to break the bond between the PDMS lid and well layer.\n\t\tNOTE: Cellular assays can now be performed following any protocol established for a cell culture plate.\nSubscription Required.
