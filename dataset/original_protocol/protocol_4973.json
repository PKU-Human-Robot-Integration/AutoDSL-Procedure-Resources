    "Plating cells for proliferationSeed 5,000 mesenchymal stem cells per cm2 in a 175T flask with complete culture media (50 ml). Next day, replace half the medium (25 ml) with fresh complete culture media. Exchange the culture medium with fresh minimum essential medium-alpha culture media every 2-3 days until cells are at least 70-80% confluent. At 70-80 % confluency, wash the cells with DPBS once and then detach the cells with TrypLETM Express enzyme. Induction of in vitro chondrogenesisFor chondrogenesis procedure, wash cells with 30 ml of in vitro chondrogenesis-inducing media (without BMP-6, TGF-β3, and ITS+) twice in a 50 ml tube. For washing, centrifuge suspended cells in the 50 ml tube at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Count the cells using a hemacytometer.Suspend the cells with in vitro chondrogenesis-inducing media in a 15 ml tube at a final concentration of 2 x 105/400 μl.Centrifuge the cells in the 15 ml tube at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Be careful not to shake the tube, culture the cell pellet with in vitro chondrogenesis-inducing media in the incubator. Loosen the cap of the tube for gas exchange and keep the tube upright (Figure 1).Culture the cell pellet in in vitro chondrogenesis-inducing medium for 2 weeks. Replace the medium with fresh in vitro chondrogenesis-inducing media twice a week (first media change after 3 days and second media change after 4 days).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128182843_0125.jpgFigure 1. Pellet culture using a 15 ml tube in a CO2 incubator. After centrifugation, the 15 ml tube was carefully moved into a CO2 incubator. During culturing period, the 15 ml tube should be placed upright using a conical tube rack.Induction of in vitro hypertrophyFor hypertrophy induction, wash the cell pellet with in vitro hypertrophy-inducing media twice.",
    "Add 400 μl of fresh in vitro hypertrophy-inducing media into the 15 ml tubeCulture the cell pellet with in vitro hypertrophy-inducing media for 2 weeks. Replace the medium with fresh in vitro hypertrophy-inducing media twice a week (first media change after 3 days and second media change after 4 days).Immunohistological analysisWash the cell pellet using DPBS and fix using 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 2 h at room temperature. Freeze the cell pellet in OCT compound at -20 °C. Cut into 5 μm thick cryostat sections and place on a charged glass microslide. Frozen sections are dehydrated for 10 min in ethanol and briefly immersed in distilled water to remove OCT compound.To block activity of peroxidase, apply enough Peroxidase Block solution (Component of DAKO DAB Kit) to cover specimen and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Rinse gently with distilled water. To block nonspecific antibody-binding sites, apply enough Protein Block solution to cover specimen and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Rinse gently with distilled water.After washing, the slides are incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody against type X collagen diluted in 0.05 M Tris-HCl with 1% BSA.Wash the slides with 500 ml of DPBS (containing 0.1% Tween 20) using a staining jar for 10 min. Repeat one more time.Apply enough Labelled Polymer-HRP anti-mouse solution (Component of DAKO DAB Kit) to cover specimen and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Wash the slides with 500 ml of DPBS (containing 0.1% Tween 20) using a staining jar for 10 min. Repeat one more time.Wash the slides with 500 ml of DPBS using a staining jar for 10 min. Repeat one more time.Apply enough DAB + Chromogen solution (Component of DAKO DAB Kit) to cover specimen.Rinse gently with distilled water.",
    "For counter staining, apply enough Hematoxylin solution to cover specimen and incubate for 1 min.Wash the slides with 500 ml of distilled water using a staining jar for 2 min. Repeat two more times.Dehydrate the slides consecutively in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 1 min in each solution. Set the slides in 100% ethanol for 2 min and repeat one more time. Set the slides in Shandon Xylene Substitute for 2 min and repeat two more times.Mount the slides with Shandon Xylene Substrate Mountant."
