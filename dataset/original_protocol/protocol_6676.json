    "Create the stimulusThe visual stimuli was created with custom Python scripts, and recorded with the Windows Game Recorder (Microsoft Corporation) for replay in behavioral tests. Code for the looming shadow stimuli is available at: www.github.com/kpc-simone/shadow-graphics.[href=https://github.com/kpc-simone/shadow-graphics]   The looming shadow stimulus is comprised of a black disk that appears on a light background in three distinct phases.A static 2 cm in diameter disk is presented for 3 s.The disk expanding in size to 20 cm over the next 2 s.Finally, the 20 cm diameter disk remains for an additional 3 s.   A train of ten of these stimulus, with a 2 s interstimulus interval, can be reproduced by running the script reported as example1.py.   Before and after the black disk, a uniform grey (RGB reference 128, 128, 128) background is presented on the monitor.Create the background for the habituation sessionDuring the habituation period the animal is exposed to the looming shadow apparatus with no stimulus but only the grey background on the screen as the only light source. For the habituation period a static background can be created using PowerPoint or by pausing the first frame(s) of the stimulus.Set up of looming shadow testIn case a uniform background is not available in the testing room place the plastic arena inside a larger monochrome arena that will act as a solid color background. Having a solid background increases the quality of the behavioral video recording (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of the looming shadow arena. A. Looming shadow arena with the shelter. B. Looming shadow arena with larger monochrome arena to provide a uniform background.Place the shelter in one corner of the arena allowing it only to be accessed by the animal form one side (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Shelter placement in the looming shadow arena Place the LCD screen above the arena (30 cm) facing downward to display a visual stimulus. If the arena is larger than the screen, place the center of the screen toward the area not covered by the shelter (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g003.jpgFigure 3. Monitor placement in the looming shadow arena Connect a PC or a laptop to the LCD screen. Duplicate the screen and open the video with full screen using Windows Media Player classic. Critically, and unlike the most moderns media players, this version does not alter the luminance in the testing arena when the video is paused or completed (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g004.jpgFigure 4. Laptop set up and connection Within the testing room the lights should be off and the only light source available for the animal is the one provided by the screen situated on top of the arena acting as a virtual sky (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g005.jpgFigure 5. The monitor is the sole light source during the test The testing room should remain quiet and the investigator should not be within the animals range of view (2 m in a dark room, Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g006.jpgFigure 6. Proposed positioning of the materials and experimenter The camera should be placed above the arena in one of the corners, allowing the capture of the entire arena. The live recording should be visible at all time for the experimenter (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g007.jpgFigure 7. Camera placement allowing the capture of the entire arena Acclimatization to the testing room and apparatusHabituate the animal to the testing room for 3 days before starting the habituation procedure for the apparatus. Transport the animal to the room using the same method every day. The animal should remain in the room for a minimum of 30 min every day.",
    "During the 3 days of habituation to the testing room the animal should be habituated to the fiber photometry patch chord. Remove the top part of the homecage and the nesting material and connect the animal to a fiber optic cable, leaving them to freely explore the homecage for 15 min.Habituate the animal to the apparatus. Move the animal to the testing room 15 min prior to the start of habituation. After this 15 min, turn the lights off in the room and turn on the screen with the background screen displayed. The light coming from the screen will be the only source of light during this phase of the habituation. Connect the animal to the fiber optic patch chord and place it in the arena and allow it to explore for 20 min. This procedure should be repeated for 3 days. They do not need to be consecutive but the last day of habituation should occur 24 h before the testing begins. The habituation to the apparatus is important to ensure a proper display of the escape behavior.Test dayMove the animal to the testing room 15 min prior the test.The computer should be on and connected to the LCD screen with the video ready to play.Room lights should be off and the only source of light is coming from the screen situated above the apparatus.Turn on the Doric system and load the protocol for the session. Assign one of the digital ports of the Doric system to trigger the video recording. The power of the 465-nm LED is adjusted to 30 µW at the end of the patch cord using a power meter (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g008.jpgFigure 8.",
    "Doric in-vivo calcium set-up  Before placing the animal into the looming shadow apparatus, connect the fiber optic patch chord to the animal and start the fiber photometry recording. Allow for 10 min of baseline recording in the homecage.Introduce the animal into the arena on the opposite side from where the shelter is. Allow 3 min of exploration time, while recording calcium activity, before initiating the stimulus presentation.After the initial 3 min of habituation/baseline, 5 overhead looming visual stimuli will be presented.The stimuli should be presented only when the animal is in the opposite side of the arena from where the shelter is. The orientation of the animal is irrelevant. Also, leave at least 1 min of inter-trial interval. Control the inter-trial interval by pausing the video after the disappearance of the most recent stimulus presented (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g009.jpgFigure 9. Image of stimulus presentation during the test After the delivery of 5 stimuli the test is over and the animal can be removed.NOTE: If the animal does not leave the shelter in 10 min between shadows the test can be suspended and the animal should be removed from the study. The maximum time allowed before suspending the test can be modified, this 10 min time provided here is just a reference based on experience. After 10 min in the shelter the probability for an animal to leave that shelter in a short period of time is low. Transfer the animal to its home cage and record for an extra 10 min.After the post-test recording, stop the recording and detach the animal from the fiber optic cable.Clean the apparatus with 70% v/v ethanol solution between subjects.A proposed timeline for the full experiment is detailed in the figure below (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3826/bioprotoc-10-22-3826-g010.jpgFigure 10.
