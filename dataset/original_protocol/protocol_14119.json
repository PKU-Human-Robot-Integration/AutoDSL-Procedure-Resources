    "This work was approved by the research ethics committee of Beijing Chaoyang District Committee of Science & Technology and the ethics committee of Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and child Healthcare Hospital, and that the protocol follows the guidelines of the hospital’s human research ethics committee.\n1. Ultrasound exam preparation\nProbe selection\n\t\nSelect a high-frequency linear probe (≥9.0 MHz) for POC-LUS to ensure high resolution.\n\t\tNOTE: A higher frequency linear probe is used to assure higher resolution. For infants with a lower gestational age or lower birth weight, a higher frequency probe is required. When the penetration is not enough, decrease the frequency or change to a lower frequency liner probe. If no suitable linear probe is available, consider using a high-frequency (≥8.0 MHz) convex array probe.\nProbe disinfection\n\t\nDisinfect the probe before and after patient examination to avoid nosocomial infection and cross-contamination.\n\t\tNOTE: The easiest, most convenient and effective disinfecting method is the use of special disinfection wipes. Alternatively, powderless gloves or probe covers can also be considered.\nPreset selection\n\t\nChoose a LUS preset.\nOptimize the image for lung scanning if there is no LUS preset.\n\t\t\nSelect one of Small Parts presets.\nModify the parameters to perform lung scanning. Adjust the Depth button to make it 4-5 cm.\nPress the Focus Zone button to have 1-2 focuses and adjust the focus position near the level of pleural line. Turn on the SRI (Speckle Reduction Imaging) button and select level 2-3 to reduce the speckle noise.\nTurn on the CRI button (Crossbeam) and select level 2 to improve contrast resolution. Activate the Harmonics to improve the signal-noise ratio or use the fundamental frequency for sharper A-lines or B-lines.\nUltrasound gel application\n\t\nWarm up the gel.",
    "Apply a layer of gel on the transducer. Make sure to avoid air bubbles between the transducer and the skin surface.\n2. Infant positioning\nKeep the infant in a quiet state.\nSwaddle the infant exposing only the area to be examined.\nPlace the infant in the supine, prone or side position before and during the process of examination.\n\tNOTE: In general, we do not recommend using sedatives while pacifier use is encouraged. Supine positioning is convenient for scanning of the anterior and lateral chest. Prone or side positioning is convenient for scanning of the back and lateral chest.\n3. Lung partitioning\nSix-region method\n\t\nDivide each lung into three regions: anterior, lateral and posterior lung area. To do this, use the anterior axillary line and the posterior axillary line as boundaries. Divide both lungs into a total of six regions.\nTwelve-region method\n\t\nBy using the line that connects the nipples, divide each lung into upper and lower lung fields, resulting in a total of 12 regions on both sides of the lungs.\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully scan the entire lung fields. Each of the 6 or 12 areas should be scanned separately to ensure comprehensive coverage and to minimize the possibility of missing existing lung lesions.\n4. Scan mode selection\nB-mode ultrasound\n\t\nPress the 2D button on the user interface to start B-mode scanning.\n\t\tNOTE: B-mode scanning is the most important and the most commonly used mode in obtaining LUS images. The majority of lung diseases can be diagnosed with B-mode scanning.\nM-mode ultrasound\n\t\nPress the M button on the user interface to start M mode scanning if needed.\n\t\tNOTE: M-mode ultrasound is helpful for further confirmation of the possibility of pneumothorax.\nColor or power Doppler ultrasound",
    "Press the C button or PD button on the user interface to start the color or power Doppler examination if needed.\n\t\tNOTE: Doppler ultrasound is used occasionally to assess the blood flow in the large area of lung consolidations or to distinguish the bronchi from blood vessels.\n5. Scanning methods\nPerpendicular scanning\n\t\nPlace the transducer perpendicular to the ribs and slide it from the midline to the lateral side along the wide axis to perform the perpendicular scanning.\nAfter initial area of the lung is scanned, move the transducer from up to down and scan the remaining areas until all the lung fields are examined.\n\t\tNOTE: Perpendicular scanning is the most important scanning method. Keeping the transducer perpendicular to the ribs is the key to obtaining accurate and reliable results.\nParallel scanning\n\t\nRotate the transducer 90° after finishing the perpendicular scanning. Keep the transducer parallel to the ribs and slide it along the narrow axis to realize the parallel scanning.\nAfter the initial area of the lung is scanned, move the transducer from up to down to scan the remaining areas until all the lung fields are examined.\nTransdiaphragmatic scanning\n\t\nPlace the transducer below the xiphoid and angle the transducer from side to side to scan the diaphragm and the bottom of lungs via the liver as the acoustic window.\n\t\tNOTE: Increase the depth and turn on virtual convex scanning to expand the far field area if needed."
