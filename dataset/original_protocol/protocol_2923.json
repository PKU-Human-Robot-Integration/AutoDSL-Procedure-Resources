Plating cells in high-density spots to induce neural rosette formation\n(A) Timeline for the first part of the differentiation up to day-in-vitro (DIV) 10. Human iPSCs kept in E8 Flex media are split into 12-well plates on DIV0, and neural differentiation is induced by dual-SMAD inhibition with SB431542 and LDN193189. On DIV7, early neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are split into high-density spots in 6-well plates to continue high-density differentiation and promote neural rosette formation.\n(B) Cells in 12-well plate on DIV1 of neuronal differentiation. Note the confluent and uniform distribution and appearance of the cells in a monolayer. Scale bar 100 μm.\n(C) Cells in 12-well plate on DIV7 of neuronal differentiation, just before the split into spots. Note the high density and uniform appearance of the cells without much cell death or formation of clumps. Scale bar 100 μm.\n(D) Dried POL plate just before making spots. Note the even crystalline (white) sheet in coated wells on the sides vs. uncoated wells in the middle (arrowheads).\n(E) Spots on 6-well plate the day after plating (arrowhead/dashed line). Note the uniform, dense appearance without holes.\n(F) NPCs in the center of the spot 3 days after plating (for location see illustration). Distribution of cells is still very even, and no clear rosettes are visible yet. Note the bright, half-moon-shaped structures of cells indicating correct differentiation (insert in the bottom right, yellow arrowhead). Scale bar 100 μm, insert 50 μm.",
    "(G) Edge of the spot around DIV10 (for location see illustration). Cells at the spot edge begin forming a “shoulder” of densely packed cells, separating cells inside the spot from outside of the spot. Cells on the inside will later form rosettes, while the shoulder and cells outside may differentiate aberrantly and should not be used in the next steps of the protocol. Scale bar 100 μm.\nPrepare required number of iPSCs on vitronectin-coated 6-well plates as described above.\nPrepare required number of GTX-coated wells of a 12-well plate; as a starting point coat two to three wells of a 12-well plate per well of a 6-well plate of iPSCs.\nCritical: Clean off spontaneously differentiated cells in the iPSC culture thoroughly prior to starting the neural induction, as these will inhibit neuronal differentiation. Aberrant differentiation of iPSCs should be <5%. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nSplit iPSCs into wells of a GTX-coated 12-well plate when they are 70%–80% confluent; this day is defined as Day-in-vitro 0 (DIV0).\nAdd 0.5 mL Accutase to the well with iPSCs.\nIncubate 5–8 min at 37°C until most cells detach when shaking/tapping the plate; if unsure, monitor under a microscope that cells are detaching.\nAdd 1 mL DMEM-F12, gently triturate to single cells with a P1000 pipette and count cells.\nTransfer required amount of cell suspension (1 million cells per well of a 12-well plate) into a 15 mL conical tube and spin 4 min at 170 g.\nNote: All centrifugation steps are performed with these parameters at RT unless indicated otherwise.\nAspirate media and resuspend pellet to a single cell solution at 1 million cells/mL in NI supplemented with RI (10 μM).",
    "Plate 1 mL of cell suspension (1 million cells) per well of a 12-well plate on the prepared, GTX-coated plates (resulting in a cell density of 260,000 cells/cm2).\nEvenly distribute cells by moving the plate back and forth in two directions.\nNote: Cells should have formed a confluent monolayer on the next day (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Increase plating density the next time if cells are not confluent on this day and decrease density if issues with detaching cells occur later.\nNote: If required, cell clumps can be carefully removed using a vacuum pump, but plating density and resuspension to single cells should be optimized to avoid formation of clumps, also see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nChange NI media every day until DIV7.\nThe first days, feed 1 mL NI per well of a 12-well plate.\nIncrease media volume to 1.5–2 mL on DIV5-7 to ensure sufficient supply with growth factors and nutrients.\nNote: Sufficient nutrient supply will improve the quality of the high-density spots in the next step.\nOptional: use E6 – NI gradient for difficult-to-differentiate cell lines on DIV0 and DIV1 starting with the split; also see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for more information\nOn DIV0, perform split as described above using 1 mL E6-NI gradient medium-1 instead of NI.\nOn DIV1, change medium to 1 mL of E6-NI gradient medium-2.\nOn DIV2, change medium to NI and continue with the standard protocol.\nNote: Depending on the cell density and iPSC line, each well of a 6-well plate of iPSCs will yield 2–4 million cells. We recommend optimizing this first split (starting cell density, number of cells per well of a 12-well plate) for each cell line depending on its proliferative capacity.\nNeural rosette formation in spots\nTiming: around 1 week",
    "In this step, neural precursor cells (NPCs) are plated in spots to achieve maximum cell density while allowing sufficient nutrient supply when fed once per day. High density plating is crucial to achieve high quality cortical neuron differentiations. A schematic overview of this step is included in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nOn DIV6 (=one day before the split), coat wells of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of each PO and L as described under “Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”. Depending on the proliferative capacity of the iPSC line, one full 12-well plate is usually split into 4–8 wells of a 6-well plate.\nOn the day of the split, the cells should look as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nOn DIV7 (=day of the split), aspirate coating solution completely and leave the plate open in the laminar flow hood to dry for about 20–30 min, turn around once after 10–15 min to allow even drying.\nNote: A crystalline sheet will appear, there should be no clear gaps in the sheet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPerform the high density split into spots on DIV7, also see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nAspirate the medium and add 0.5 mL Accutase to the cells, incubate 10 min at 37°C.\nAdd 1 mL DMEM-F12 (10 μM RI can be added to DMEM-F12 when more than one plate needs to be split simultaneously).\nWash off cells with a P1000 pipette to obtain a single cell suspension, pool the suspension in a 15 mL conical tube and count the cells.\nSpin down cells, aspirate supernatant, resuspend cells in appropriate amount of NI/RI to get 30 million cells per mL, make sure to obtain a single cell suspension.",
    "Put one 250–350 μL drop per well on dried POL 6-well plates. The cell suspension should stay in the middle of the plate and not disperse (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]), do not introduce air bubbles.\nIf necessary, spread the spot slightly by gently tilting and tapping the plate, such that its diameter is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the well diameter (depending on the spot volume).\nNote: Avoid contact between the cell solution and the edges of the well, as this would pull cell solution towards the edge, resulting in deformed spots with lower cell density and uniformity.\nLet cells attach for 60 min at RT without adding additional media; put the lid on the plate and keep inside the hood (i.e., do not put the cells into the incubator) to avoid dislodging the spot while cells are attaching.\nAfter 60 min, add 2 mL NI/RI very gently to the wall of the plate with a serological pipette, tilt the plate very gently to spread out the NI, ensure that cells stay in the spot and are not washed off (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nThe next day, shake or tap the plate to dislodge any non-attached/dead cells and replace the medium with fresh 2 mL NI; the spots should stay on the plate and form a dense, uniform cell layer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nChange NI media every day, 3–4 mL feeds are sufficient to bridge one weekend day.\nOn DIV10, switch to 2 mL NM media.\nStarting from DIV10, for subsequent feeds change NM media every day, 3–4 mL feeds are sufficient to bridge one weekend day.",
    "Around DIV10, a “shoulder” of partially non-cortical cells forms at the very edge of the spots (containing neural crest cells and other cells) while the high-density cells in the middle of the spots soon start forming neural rosettes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nCritical: The quality of cells in the 12-well plate before making spots needs to be very high. The cells should be in a uniform layer and should not peel off the well or start dying (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C) – if they do, the starting cell density in the 12-well plates needs to be optimized. For more proliferative iPSC lines, the day of making the spots can be shifted to DIV6 to ensure cells are confluent in the 12-well plate after plating but do not peel off on the day of making the spots. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nCritical: Drying of the POL-coated plates is critical for the successful generation of spots. It is crucial to have an even crystalline sheet appear on the bottom of the plates, as spots will peel off if they are placed onto gaps in the sheet. The relative hydrophobicity of the sheet will contain the area covered by cells which allows for the high cell densities required for successful neuron differentiation. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nOptional: If not enough cells are available to prepare spots at the indicated density (30 million cells/mL) and volume (250–350 μL), spots can be made with smaller volumes but same density. This will however disproportionally decrease final rosette yield, as the area of the spot \"shoulder\" - containing potentially aberrantly differentiated cells - will be increased relative to the area of rosettes on the inside which are used for further differentiation (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and step 15 below).",
    "Optional: If cell density is low on DIV10 (e.g., holes are forming) when changing to NM, bFGF (20 ng/mL) can be added to NM for the next 2 feeds. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nNote: On DIV13-15, the rosettes in the spots can be used to differentiate astrocytes using the serum-free protocol by Perriot et al.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2669-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Expansion and enrichment of neural rosettes\n(A) Timeline for the second part of the differentiation. Early NPCs in spots start forming rosettes, which are collected around DIV23 using neural rosette selection reagent (NRSR) and manual selection. Rosettes are further expanded by another split using Accutase around DIV30. Late NPCs and early neurons are then either frozen for cell banking around DIV37 or split again with Accutase into single cells for subsequent long-term culture.\n(B) Rosette formation in spots on DIV18. Left: Overview image (for location in the spot see illustration). Note uniform, chess-board-like structure of rosettes. Scale bar 100 μm. Right: Magnification of indicated area showing typical structure of single rosettes. Scale bar 50 μm.\n(C) Accumulation of rosettes around DIV23. Shown is the edge of the spot (see location in the illustration). Note multiple “circles” and brown appearance of densely packed, accumulated rosettes inside the spot (bottom right). At this stage, spots commonly have a clearly defined shoulder (dashed line), which separates the desired, pure NPCs in rosettes from neural crest and other aberrantly differentiated cells. The shoulder will be used as guidance to manually isolate the rosettes during the NRSR split along the dashed line (see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Scale bar 250 μm.\n(D) Isolated rosettes around DIV28 (after NRSR split). Only rosettes and migrating NPCs are visible (dark, compact and rounded cells), note outgrowth of neurites from late NPCs/early neurons.

    "Methods video S1. Generation of high-density spots on dried, POL-coated plates on DIV7 of the protocol, step 8\n    \nExpansion of neural rosettes\nTiming: around 3 weeks\nIn this step, the population of NPCs is expanded to increase the number of resulting neurons at the end of the differentiation protocol. To achieve this, it is crucial to maintain the integrity of neural rosettes. A schematic overview of this step is included in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nWhen neural rosettes appear, usually around DIV15 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), feed cells for 2 consecutive days with 2 mL NM supplemented with bFGF (20 ng/mL) (= NM + bFGF), to support proliferation and expansion of the rosettes.\nFor subsequent feeds, change NM media every day, 3–4 mL feeds are sufficient to bridge one weekend day.\nWhen rosettes start accumulating (usually around DIV20–23: the culture develops brownish, dense areas/circles visible under the microscope, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C), split cells with NRSR (STEMdiff Neural Rosette Selection Reagent), also illustrated in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nNote: NRSR is a reagent that is designed to specifically dislodge rosettes without breaking them apart, resulting in separation of rosettes from undesired cells. Here, it is used in combination with manual selection of neural rosettes inside the spot to increase the purity of the culture and enrich for NPCs; using this procedure, only one NRSR split is required to obtain pure neuron cultures.\nDepending on the density and size of the spots, split the spots in a 3:2 to 3:4 ratio onto POL-coated 6-well plates; as a starting point split one spot into one well of a 6-well plate.\nAspirate media.\nAdd 1 mL NRSR, incubate 30–60 min at 37°C (optimize time for cell line used).\nAspirate NRSR and add 1.5 mL NM.",
    "Manually isolate rosettes from inside the spot using a pipette tip (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C), do not touch the “shoulder” of the spot or cells outside the spot.\nCollect dislodged rosettes in a 15 mL conical tube, triturate slightly to break up larger clumps (5–10× with Pasteur pipette or P1000 if more careful), make sure to not dissociate the neural rosettes into single cells.\nSpin down cells, remove supernatant, carefully resuspend cells in NM + bFGF, triturate 1–2× with 5 mL serological pipette.\nPlate 2 mL of the cell suspension per well of a POL-coated 6-well plate.\nNote: The goal of this step is to keep rosettes intact but break up aggregates of rosettes and give them more space for growth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Rosettes need to be grown at high density without generating too many single cells, as these will fall out of cell cycle, reducing final cell yield. Therefore, special attention should be paid when triturating the cell suspension. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nFeed with NM + bFGF on the next day.\nFor subsequent feeds, change NM media (without bFGF) every day to every other day.\nCultures should contain single rosettes and small aggregates of rosettes, but few to no other cell types or large clumps of cells, the NPCs (radial-glia-like cells) in the middle of the rosettes will keep dividing and the cultures will become denser (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nWhen rosettes become almost confluent (usually around DIV30–33), split again to give cells more space, also see Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nSplit 3 wells into 3–5 wells, depending on density and proliferative capacity of the cell line.\nIncubate with 0.5 mL Accutase for 4 min at 37°C, do not aspirate, add 1 mL NM.\nWash cells off with plastic Pasteur pipette or P1000 pipette.",
    "Pool and triturate gently with Pasteur pipette or P1000 to separate rosettes from each other; avoid making single cells.\nSpin cells down, resuspend in fresh NM + bFGF and plate in 2 mL per well of a 6-well plate.\nFeed with NM + bFGF on the next day.\nFor subsequent feeds, feed with NM media every day to every other day.\nNote: The cultures should look like the rosettes before the Accutase split, but less dense with more neurites (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).

Accutase Split of NPCs, steps 19 and 28\n    \nFreezing and thawing of neural rosettes\nTiming: 15 min for each freezing or thawing procedure, 1 day to coat plates before thawing\nIn this step, we describe how to freeze the neural rosettes for long-term storage in a liquid nitrogen tank, as mature cortical neurons cannot be frozen. We also describe how to thaw the neural rosettes. A schematic overview of this step is included in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nPause point: Rosettes can be frozen at this point and stored in liquid nitrogen for extended periods of time (months to years). Long-term culture of the differentiated neurons can be resumed at any later timepoint, allowing for synchronization of different cell lines and cell types for long-term culture.\nFreezing of neural rosettes works best between DIV35 and DIV41.\nAdd 0.5 mL Accutase to the cells, incubate for 4 min at 37°C.\nDo not aspirate Accutase, add 1 mL NM and triturate cells gently with Pasteur pipette without breaking up rosettes, collect cells in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Spin down cells and resuspend the NPCs in 1 mL cold Freeze Medium for Neural Rosettes for every 1–2 collected wells, depending on cell density; triturate 2–3× with 5 mL pipette.\nTransfer cell suspension to cryovials and freeze vials with 1 mL cell suspension in prechilled Mr. Frosty at –80°C, save a drop to genotype cells if needed.\nThe next day, transfer frozen rosettes to liquid nitrogen tank (−80°C is not sufficient for long-term storage).\nOptional: To facilitate planning, count cells before freezing by triturating a small, representative aliquot to single cells. Freeze down NPCs at about 10 million cells per cryovial to thaw them into one well of a 6-well plate. Document yield (i.e., counting the neurons obtained from the differentiation) and/or quality of the cells (e.g., by taking representative brightfield images) to optimize future differentiations and adjust subsequent experimental setups.\nThawing of neural rosettes.\nCoat required number of wells/plates with POL the day before thawing.\nPrepare 9 mL Neurobasal media in 15 mL conical tubes, one tube per vial thawed.\nPrepare Thawing Medium for Neural Rosettes, use 2 mL per vial thawed (if plating in wells of a 6-well plate).\nQuickly thaw frozen rosettes in a 37°C water bath until only a small clump of ice remains.\nFor each vial, slowly add 0.5 mL of the prepared Neurobasal media into the cryovial to dilute Freeze medium, carefully pipette the rosettes up and down 1–2× with Pasteur pipette (if no large clumps are present) or the P1000 pipette (if large clumps are present).\nGently transfer the thawed cell suspension to the prepared tubes with Neurobasal media.\nSpin down cells and aspirate supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cells in 2 mL Thawing Medium for Neural Rosettes using Pasteur pipette (P1000 if there are larger clumps) and plate into one well of a 6-well plate (assuming cells were frozen at ∼10 million cells/vial), shake plate to distribute cells and transfer to incubator.\nOn day post thaw (DPT) 1, if the media is yellow, add 1–2 mL fresh NM + bFGF on top.\nOn DPT 2, do a full feed with 2 mL NM + bFGF.\nFeed 2 mL NM on following days as needed.\nOn DPT 4–7, split the neurons for long-term culture as described below.\nNote: Neuronal long-term cultures can also be generated directly from differentiated cells without freezing. In order to do so, perform another Accutase split as described in points 19–21 between DIV37-DIV41, and mature the rosettes further until DIV 43–48 when plating of the neurons for long-term cultures is performed (see below).\nNote: as alternative to RVC, both RI or CEPT10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] can be added to thawing medium.\nOptional: To ensure cortical identity of the differentiated neurons, stainings for neuronal markers can be performed as we describe in the Expected Outcomes section. If other neuronal cell types are detected, refer to troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nLong-term culture of differentiated cortical neurons\nTiming: 1 day to coat plates, 20–45 min for splitting the cells, 1 month to 1 year for long-term culture\nIn this step, we describe how to plate the neurons in different well formats to ensure stable culture of the cells for up to 12 months.\nSplit rosettes on DPT 4–7 (or alternatively 4–7 days after the last split) onto 6/12/24-well, POL-coated plates; this is usually DIV41–47.",
    "Note: Cells should have recovered from thawing by rearranging into rosettes, with early neurons being generated as seen by neurite formation. The space between rosettes should be free of other cell types and dead cells that may be visible after thawing should be gone after media changes.\nPlate the cells at these recommended cell densities (160,000–210,000 cells/cm2) to obtain uniform neuronal networks:\n24-well plate: 300–400 k cells/well.\n12-well plate: 0.6–0.8 mio cells/well.\n6-well plate: 1.5–2.0 mio cells/well.\nNote: Neuronal survival after the final split may vary. We recommend aiming for the highest possible density in the provided range that still allows uniform neuron growth without major clumping. If the density is too high, clumping will occur due to clustering of the neurons.\nPrepare required number of POL-coated wells/plates as described above.\nPrepare the following before the split:\none 15 mL tube with 4 mL NM per well of a 6-well plate with rosettes.\nrequired amounts of Accutase (0.5 mL per well of a 6-well plate with rosettes).\nthe required amounts of plating medium: NB+/B27+ supplemented with DAPT (10 μM) and RVC (1:100); for plating: use 2 mL/ 1 mL / 0.5 mL for wells of 6-well/12-well/24-well plates respectively.\nAspirate NM, add 0.5 mL Accutase to rosettes and incubate 6–10 min at 37°C (depending on density and morphology).\nNote: If unsure about the incubation time, check under the microscope that neurons are detached, and neurites are retracted to not harm the cells when triturating; if this is not the case increase the incubation time for Accutase.\nAdd 1 mL NM to Accutase with a P1000 pipette, thereby detaching the cells.",
    "Carefully triturate 8–12× with P1000 to break up any remaining rosettes and generate a single cell suspension; making single cells works best by holding the plate at a 45°- angle and pipetting cells in and out of the P1000 tip while moving the tip left and right (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: When triturating, stay inside the cell suspension, avoid generating air bubbles and focus on large clumps in the suspension. Do not overtriturate cells, if small clumps remain after ∼12× triturating, use the optional straining step below to remove them.\nCollect the cells in the prepared 15 mL tube with 4 mL NM (cells are diluted to facilitate counting and reduce harsh contact of the neurons with the plastic).\nOptional: Transfer single cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into the prepared 15 mL tube to remove any remaining large clumps from the suspension. Large clumps should not remain in the suspension as they often contain proliferative NPCs and thus impair stable long-term neuronal culture. Pre-wet the cell strainer and the wall of the 15 mL tube with media to minimize cell loss and death.\nCount cells (one well can contain 5–20 million cells depending on cell density).\nTransfer the required number of cells into a new tube, spin down.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend and gently triturate with P1000 pipette in 1 mL Plating medium until no clumps are visible anymore (usually 4–6×).\nAdd required media volume to reach recommended cell density and plate quickly (occasionally mix the tube when plating many wells).\nNote: DAPT inhibits Notch signaling and thereby promotes terminal differentiation of NPCs into neurons.",
    "Note: If neurons are to be plated onto glass coverslips for imaging, the coverslips need to be pre-treated with 30% HCl at least 12 h to roughen the glass surface. Afterwards, wash coverslips 4–5× with de-ionized water to fully remove the acid. Store coverslips in 100% Ethanol. Dry off Ethanol and coat the coverslips with POL as described above before use.\nNote: Cells are very sensitive at this stage, therefore it is important to work as quickly as possible, minimize trituration, and to not introduce air bubbles. Always add cells directly into media if possible.\nExtended culture of neurons over longer time periods (1 month–1 year).\nFeed the cells 2 days after plating with NB+/B27+ with DAPT.\nBefore the feed, tap the plate to dislodge debris and dead cells into the supernatant.\nOn day 3, do a half-feed.\nPrepare the required amount of NB+/B27+ medium and supplement it with 10 μM DAPT and 5 μM 5-Fluorouracil and 5 μM Uridine (pre-mixed as 5FU) as indicated in the “Materials and Equipment” section.\nNote: 5-Fluorouracil is added to kill residual dividing cells, while Uridine is added to minimize the effect of 5-Fluorouracil on transcription and thus reduce toxicity in non-dividing cells.\nConsecutively do half feeds with NB+/B27+ supplemented with DAPT and 5FU two to three times per week.\nDAPT should be added for a total of 7 days (starting with the day of plating).\n5FU should be added for a total of 10–14 days (starting at the feed 3 days after plating).\nNote: If a lot of cell death occurs during 5FU treatment, tap the plate to dislodge debris and do a full feed.",
    "Note: Ensure that media volumes stay constant during half feeds by briefly tilting plates after removing media and checking contents in individual wells, media in peripheral wells may evaporate faster.\nAfter the 5FU treatment ends, switch to half feeds with NB+/B27+ two to three times per week.\nCells will start growing neurites the day after plating; after two weeks, the cells will have formed a dense neuritic network; there should be over 95% neurons and no large patches of other cell types, some astrocytes may be present 1–2 months after plating.\nNote: We tested long-term neuron culture with different neuronal media. Neurons can also be fed with NB/B27, NB/B27 PLUS and will survive for long-term, but in our experience, the cultures are more stable in NB PLUS/B27 PLUS in terms of survival for extended culture periods of >4 months. We did not test Brainphys for long-term culture, because we noted increased contamination with astrocytes."
