    "Maintenance of C. elegans Isolate eggs from gravid hermaphrodites using the hypochlorite method as follows:Wash gravid hermaphrodites from 2-4 10 cm NGM plates with 15 ml of S Basal.Pour worms in S Basal into a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge the tube(s) at 1,000 × g for 30 s.Aspirate the supernatant, leaving the worm pellet (volume: ~0.1-0.5 ml).Add 3.5 ml of Worm Bleach Solution (see Recipes), shake vigorously, and wait for one minute.Centrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 30 s.Remove the supernatant by pouring it off the tubes or by using an aspirator.Add 3.5 ml of Worm Bleach Solution (see Recipes) and shake vigorously.Monitor the lysis of the worm cuticles by using a dissecting microscope. Shake vigorously periodically. Most worms will dissolve in four to five minutes, leaving the eggs, which are protected by the eggshells. Do not bleach the worms for more than seven minutes, as the eggs will start to die.Centrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 30 s, remove supernatant.Wash eggs with 15 ml of S Basal three times to remove all traces of bleach.Add 5-6 ml of S Basal into the tube.Rotate the tubes on a rotisserie at room temperature for 16-24 h to let the eggs hatch to obtain a synchronous L1 population.Count the concentration of worms in the tube from Step A1 as follows:Put 80 µl of S Basal into a 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tube.Gently shake the tube containing L1 larvae from Step A1, take 20 µl of these L1 larvae and add it into the 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tube (5 times dilution).Pipette up and down several times to disperse the worms in S Basal equally.Take 10 µl from the microcentrifuge tube and spot it on a blank NGM plate in a shape of a line.",
    "Count the number of L1 larvae on three different lines and average the obtained numbers.Divide the averaged number by 2 to obtain worm count per µl in the original tube (or divide number by 10 and multiply by 5 to compensate for dilution).To calculate the volume of worms needed for seeding, divide the desired number of worms by the worm count per µl. For example, to transfer 6,000 of L1 larva from a tube containing 30 worms per µl, use 200 µl (6,000/30) of the L1 larvae.Transfer ~6,000 synchronized L1 larvae onto 2-4 10 cm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50.Grow worms at 20°C for 72 h for the next cycle of egg isolation. If working with temperature-sterile worms, incubate them at 15°C for ~120 h instead.Preparation of NGM-OP50 platesGrow E. coli OP50 in LB broth for 16 h in a shaker-incubator at 37°C with 225 rpm of agitation to a saturated culture.Centrifuge bacterial culture at 3,260 × g for 30 min at 4°C.Concentrate bacteria by removing supernatant and adding S Basal (40 ml S Basal for each liter of the culture, achieving 25-fold concentration).Seed 2 ml of concentrated bacteria onto each 10 cm NGM plate. Allow the OP50 lawn to dry before using. These plates can be stored in a closed container at 4°C for several weeks.Preparation of RNAi-expressing bacteriaGrow RNAi-expressing E. coli in LB supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline and 25 μg/ml carbenicillin for 16 h in a shaker-incubator at 37°C with 225 rpm of agitation.Subculture with 100-fold dilution in LB supplemented with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin and grow for another 6 h in a shaking incubator at 37°C with 225 rpm of agitation.Centrifuge bacterial culture at 3,260 × g for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Concentrate bacteria by removing supernatant and adding S Basal (40 ml S Basal for each liter culture, achieving 25-fold concentration).Seed bacteria onto NGM plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1 mM IPTG (2 ml of concentrated culture for each 10 cm plate and 0.5 ml of concentrated culture for each 6 cm plate).For double RNAi experiment, measure optical densities (OD600) of each culture with a spectrophotometer. Dilute the cultures so that the final mix of cultures is equivalent and seed as described in Step C5.Growing C. elegans for experimental setupUsing E. coli OP50Pipette ~6,000 L1 worms onto 10 cm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50.Incubate worms-containing plates in a 20°C incubator for 46 h.Using RNAi-expressing E. coli Pipette ~2,000 or ~6,000 L1 worms onto prepared 6 cm or 10 cm RNAi plates, respectively.Incubate plates at 20°C for 46 h.For either food sourseWash synchronized young adult worms from NGM plates into a 15 ml conical tube with S Basal.Centrifuge tubes at 1,000 × g for 30 s.Remove liquid and add 14 ml S Basal.Repeat Steps D2a and D2b two more times to remove excess bacteria.Remove liquid and add 1.8 ml (if 6 cm plate was used) or 5 ml (if 10 cm plate was used) S Basal to achieve density of ~1 worm/µl.Pipette 100 µl of worms (~100 worms) into each well of a 96-well plate (half-area, black, clear bottom).Image worms by using a Cytation5 (Procedure F) and/or measure fluorescence using LP Sampler and COPAS FP BioSorter (Procedure G).C. elegans exposure to mitochondrial inhibitorsWash synchronized L4/young adult worms from NGM plates into a 15 ml conical tube with 15 ml of S Basal.Centrifuge tubes at 1,000 × g for 30 s.Remove liquid and add 5 ml S Basal.",
    "Pipette 100 µl of worms (~100 worms) into each well of a 96-well plate (half area, black, clear bottom).Aspirate liquid with an EL406 Washer Dispenser (volume of remaining liquid: ~40 µl).Add 60 µl of S Basal supplemented OP50 (final OD: 0.03) and compound of interest.Note: In this study, we used a combination of 0, 25, 37.5, or 50 µM rotenone (Sigma) and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, ACROS Organics). Image worms every two hours for twenty hours by using Cytation5 (Procedure F) and/or measure fluorescence by using LP Sampler and COPAS FP BioSorter (Procedure G).Imaging with automated microscope (Cytation5)Prepare worm-containing plates as described above (Procedures D and E).Run Gen5 software.Set up for kinetics experiment or take images at a certain time point. Imaging should be performed with identical settings for the biological replicates for the same experiment.Analyze images with Gen5 cellular analysis pipeline:Select an image.Click on ‘Process’, select ‘Image Preprocessing’.Apply Image preprocessing for fluorescence images, click ‘OK’.On the transformed image, click on ‘Process’, select ‘Digital Phase Contrast’, click ‘OK’.On the digital phase contrast and transformed image, click on ‘Analyze’.Choose ‘Cellular Analysis’ on the ‘Analysis’ panel.Click on ‘Edit options’ and adjust values (threshold, background, minimum and maximum object sizes, etc.) as optimized.Click on ‘Apply’ and then ‘Apply changes’.Export values into Microsoft Excel for downstream processing.Fluorescence measurement with flow vermimetry (COPAS FP BioSorter and LP Sampler)For operation with COPAS FP BioSorterPrepare worm-containing plates as described above (Procedures D and E)Wash worms into a 50 ml conical tube (from RNAi plates or from treatment with compounds).Let worms settle to the bottom of the tube via gravity, aspirate liquid, and add 50 ml S Basal.",
    "Once worms are re-settled, aspirate liquid and add 5 ml S Basal for every 5,000 worms (aim for a final concentration of 1 worm per µl).Proceed to fluorescence measurement with COPAS FP BioSorter machine. Measurement should be performed with identical settings for the biological replicates for the same experiment.Analyze data obtained from COPAS FP BioSorter.For operation with LP Sampler and COPAS FP BioSorterPrepare worm-containing plates as described above (Procedures D and E).At the appropriate time point, wash the 96-well plate three times to remove any remaining drugs or dyes by using the EL406 machine. Allow worms to settle via gravity between washes.Proceed to fluorescence measurement with LP Sampler and COPAS FP BioSorter machine. Measurement should be performed with identical settings within the same experiment.Analyze data obtained from COPAS FP BioSorter.Analyzing output data from COPAS FP BioSorterOpen the output file (delimited, .txt) in Microsoft Excel, R, or another statistical package.Filter data based on ‘In Regions’ column, ‘0’ indicates samples that are detected outside of region of interest and ‘1’ indicates samples that lie within the region of interest.Normalize fluorescence value (‘Green’, ‘Yellow’, or ‘Red’) with TOF.Perform relevant statistical testing using normalized values."
