    "NOTE: All the samples were treated by phenylthiourea(PTU) egg water to inhibit pigment.\n1. Generation of Tg (fabp10a:il34) Transgenic Constructs and Fish Injection\nClone the 2.8 kb fabp10a promoter8 and the IL-34 coding regions (ENSDART00000126460.3) of zebrafish into the pTol2 vector to generate the fabp10a-il34 construct. Inject the constructs into one-cell stage Tg (mpeg1: GFP) and WT fish embryos together with the transposase mRNA. Raise the fabp10a-il34 injected WT embryos to adult9 and identify the transgenic founder by in situ hybridization.\nNOTE: The injection of the Tol2 construct directly into another transgenic could be problematic if the other transgenic line is made with the same transposon system. A general practice would be to make an independent transgenic line and subsequently cross the new line with another reporter line. This ensures that there will be no effects of the new transgenesis on a previously inserted transgene.\n2. Fluorescent Whole Mount In Situ Hybridization (WISH) Combine with Immunostaining\nSample fixation\nCollect embryos of transient injection or stable IL-34 transgenic line which crossed with Tg (mpeg1: GFP) at desired stages.\nNOTE: For this case, the embryos were collected at 4 d post fertilization (dpf). (If needed) remove the chorion by syringe.\nFix the embryos with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature (RT) (about 25 °C).\nWash the embryos with phosphate buffered saline plus Tween 20 (PBST) 3x 5 min.\nDehydrate the embryos separately with 50% methanol in PBST (50% Methanol/PBST) and 100% methanol, 1x 5 min each. Then, change to fresh 100% methanol and store at -20 °C (at least 2 h).\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nProbe hybridization (Day I)\nRehydrate the embryos in the previous steps with 50% methanol in PBST (50% Methanol/PBST), then wash with PBST 3x 5 min.",
    "Digest the embryos with proteinase K in PBST at RT (final concentration: 10 µg/mL; 1:2000 in PBST).\nNOTE: Digestion time depends on the embryos stage: Less than 36 h post fertilization (hpf), no need; 36 hpf-2 dpf embryo, 3-5 min; 2-3 dpf embryo, 10 min; 3-4 dpf embryo, 15 min; 4-5 dpf embryo, 15-20 min; 5-6 dpf embryo, 20-27 min; >6 dpf embryo, 25-30 min at RT (about 25 °C).\nDiscard the digestion solution and perform fixation again with 4% PFA, for 20 min at RT.\nWash the embryos with PBST 2x 10 min.\nDiscard the PBST, perform pre-hybridization with heated hybridization buffer (HB buffer) at 65 °C for 5 min, recycle the HB buffer into the original tube.\nPerform pre-hybridization with new heated HB buffer at 65 °C at least 1 h.\nPre-heat the probe9 (for this case was an il34 probe, 1 ng/mL) at 65 °C at least 10 min. Then recycle the HB buffer into the original tube. Perform hybridization with the pre-heated probe at 65 °C overnight.\nAntibody treatment (Day II)\nPre-heat the 50% formamide/2x saline sodium citrate plus Tween 20 (SSCT), 2x SSCT, 0.2x SSCT at 65 °C.\nRecycle the probe into the original tube and store the probe at -20 °C.\nWash the embryos separately with 50% formamide/2x SSCT; 2x SSCT; 0.2x SSCT, 3x 20 min or 2x 30 min each at 65 °C.\nWash the embryos with PBST 3x 5 min.\nBlock the samples with 600 µL of blocking buffer (5% filtered fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBST) for 1 h at RT.\nAdd 400 µL of Anti-digoxigenin-HRP antibody solution (1:1,000-1:2,000 in blocking buffer) and incubate the embryos at 4 °C overnight. If signals are weak, use 1:500 dilution of antibody.\nColoring and primary antibody incubating (Day III)",
    "Remove the antibody; wash the embryos with PBST, 6x 20 min at RT.\nRinse the sample with 30 µL of 1x Plus Amplification Diluent for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the diluent by pipetting out; dilute Fluorophore Tyramide Stock Solution (Cyanine 3 Plus Amplification Reagent (Cy3) or Cyanine 5 Plus Amplification Reagent (Cy5), for this case Cy3 was used) 1:50 in 1x Plus Amplification Diluent to make the Fluorophore Tyramide Working Solution. Prepare 50-100 µL of working solution for each sample.\nIncubate the sample in the Fluorophore Tyramide Working Solution for 5-15 min in dark at RT. If signals are weak, extend the incubation time to 30 min.\nStop the reaction by changing the working solution with PBST and examine the signals.\nWash the embryos with PBST 3x 10 min at RT.\nIncubate the sample with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. For this case, use the Goat-Anti-GFP antibody as the primary antibody.\nSecondary antibody staining (Day IV)\nWash the embryos with PBST for 4x 30 min.\nIncubate the embryos with secondary antibody at 4 °C overnight. For this case, use Alexa 488-Anti-Goat antibody as the secondary antibody.\nTake pictures (Day V)\nWash the embryos with PBST 3x 10 min at RT.\nStore the embryos in 70% glycerol in dark at 4 °C overnight or -20 °C for longer.\n3. Live Imaging\nSample selecting",
    "NOTE: Use the live image to directly observe whether macrophages of Tg (fabp10a: il34; fabp10a: DsRed; mpeg1: GFP) fish would migrate into the liver under IL-34 induction during 3-3.5 dpf. Here the Tg (fabp10a-DsRed) transgenic line is used to label the liver region and make it visible, to facilitate the localization of the liver and to determine whether macrophages migrate into the liver. Before imaging, use a fluorescence microscope to select the DsRed and GFP double positive embryos.\nFish mounting\nUse a metal bath to heat 1 mL of 1% low melting agarose to above 90 °C to completely melt it.\nAfter the low melting agarose is cooled to body temperature, add 50 µL of 0.2% tricaine, and uniformly mix tricaine with the agarose.\nMove the anesthetized embryos to a small dish mounted with a cover slide on the bottom, remove the surrounding water, slowly drop the low melting agarose on the embryos, carefully set the position of the fish before the agarose is solidified, keep the liver area close to the cover slide on the bottom of the dish.\nAfter the low melting agarose is solidified, carefully cover it with another layer of agarose to reinforce it.\nPlace the dish on the confocal microscope carrier table, cover the fish with the E2 solution10 with tricaine and start imaging.\nSoftware operation of the confocal microscope\nOpen the ZEN black 2.3 software, install the living cell workbench onto the microscope carrier table.\nClick Locate | Incubation | Temperature to set the temperature to 29 °C.\nPlace the dish in the center of the living cell workbench, cover the fish with the E2 solution10 with tricaine.\nClick the Acquisition menu, select the required scan mode and lasers in the Smart Setup menu, then select Z-Stack and Position.",
    "Click the Experiment Designer menu, select Enable Multi Block Experiment, in the first block, to find the sample under the low magnification, then switch to the high magnification, let the observed area in the center of the visual field.\nSet the position and Z-Stack information, select the appropriate laser intensity, scanning layers and imaging speed.\nCreate a new block and repeat the above steps. After setting up all blocks, set the appropriate number of loops and start recording (Figure 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
