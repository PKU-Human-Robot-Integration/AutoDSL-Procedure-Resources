    "1. Multi-layer Device Design\nNOTE: Features of different heights and/or photoresists must be added sequentially to the wafer during different fabrication steps to create final composite features. Therefore, designs for each separate height and photoresist to be included on a wafer must be printed on their own mask (Figure 4).\nDownload a computer-assisted design (CAD) drafting program (e.g., AutoCAD Educational Version).\nDefine the 4\" wafer area by drawing a 4\" circle. Wafer designs (Figure 4, Additional Resources) are provided as an example.\nInside the 4\" wafer outline, place device borders using 300 µm polyline rectangles. Use these device borders for alignment during photolithography.\nCreate different layers for each different height or photoresist needed for the final design (i.e., flow round, flow low, flow high, and control in the design) using the Layers panel.\nDesign features of a particular desired height on the corresponding layer. The example design shows 4 different active layers, each with its own color (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: Device borders, global text, and the wafer outline should be made on their own layer (i.e., 1-Negative in the designs), which, later, will appear on all layers for global alignment. Features of different photoresist (such as fully sealable valves that must be fabricated with positive resist) must appear on different layers, regardless of height.\nUsing closed zero-width polylines, design device features within device borders.\nConsider design parameters in Table 1 to increase chances of successful fabrication.\nFor each height, select that layer in the Layers panel and add all features of that height.\nReady designs for transparency film printing using the Basic Mask File (Additional Resources) where each 4\" wafer circle is inserted within a 5\" rectangular border. Each layer will be printed on a separate transparency film for sequential addition of each photoresist layer.",
    "NOTE: This Basic Mask File represents the final designs used for printing.\n\t\nTo complete design, turn all Layers off except 1-Negative and the AZ50 XT valve layer. Copy the entire wafer with the active layer (i.e., valves) and global features (i.e., device borders).\nOpen the Basic Mask File and paste this design into the rectangle entitled AZ50 XT valves. Use the outer wafer border for alignment and subsequently delete it after pasting.\nRepeat for the rest of the layers (e.g., in the example design: flow square low, flow square high, and control). Example transparency files are provided (Additional Resources).\nSend files to a commercial printing company (e.g., FineLine Imaging) for printing on transparency film. Use 32,000 DPI for printing >10 µm features and up to 50,000 DPI for smaller features. If features less than 7 µm are needed, order a Chrome Mask instead of a transparency film.\nTable 1: Design Parameters and Suggestions.

Preparing a Wafer for Photolithography\nNOTE: These steps additionally appear in table-format in Table 2.\nIn cleanroom or designated clean area, clean and dehydrate a 4\" test-grade silicon wafer (single-side polished).\nRinse the wafer well with methanol.\n\t\tNOTE: No further cleaning steps are needed if using the SU-8 adhesion layer described below. Other adhesion layers that deviate from this protocol (e.g., HMDS) often require more thorough cleaning, such as piranha etching.\nBlow dry with N2 or compressed air.\nBake on an aluminum hotplate at 95 °C for 10 min to fully evaporate solvent.\nFabricate a uniform 5 µm thick layer of SU-8 2005 to improve adhesion for subsequent photoresist layers.",
    "Place the cleaned wafer on a spin coater, turn on the vacuum to affix it to the spin chuck, and blow away dust with N2 or compressed air.\nApply 1-2 ml of SU-8 2005 negative photoresist in center of wafer and spin as follows: spread: 500 rpm, 10 sec, 133 rpm/s acceleration; cast: 3,000 rpm, 40 sec, 266 rpm/s acceleration.\nRemove wafer and soft bake by switching wafer between two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C according to the following program: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 3 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nAllow wafer to cool to RT.\nPlace wafer in the chuck of a UV mask aligner and expose without a mask ('flood exposure') for a total energy deposition of 124 mJ (here, 20 sec at ~6.2 mW/cm2 lamp intensity). If available, select hard contact mode to achieve a 300 µm wafer: mask separation.\nRemove wafer and post-exposure bake by switching the wafer between two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C as follows: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 4 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nFabricating Rounded Valves\nUse online AZ50 XT valve predictor resource26 to plan spin speeds for desired valve dimensions and heights.\n\tNOTE: The following steps will deposit a 55 µm layer of positive photoresist for valve definition and reflow rounding.\nPlace the wafer on a spin coater, turn on vacuum to affix it to the spin chuck, and blow away dust with N2 or compressed air.\nApply 2-3 mL of AZ50 XT positive photoresist to center of the wafer. Spin as follows: spread: 200 rpm, 10 s, 133 rpm/s acceleration; cast: 1,200 rpm, 40 sec, 266 rpm/s acceleration; Snap spin to remove edge bead: 3,400 rpm, 1 sec, 3,400 rpm/s acceleration.",
    "In a 5\" Petri dish, lay down the wafer carefully and let relax for 20 min.\nSoft bake the wafer on a hotplate: 65 °C - 112 °C, 22 min, 450 °C/h ramping speed.\nRemove the wafer and let rest overnight at RT in a Petri dish for ambient rehydration.\nTape Flow Round transparency mask to 5\" glass plate print-side down (closest to wafer) and load into mask positioner of the UV mask aligner. Expose the wafer to 930 mJ of UV in 6 cycles (e.g., 6 cycles of 25 sec at ~6.2 mW/cm2 lamp intensity, 30 s wait time between exposures).\nDevelop wafer immediately by immersing in a stirred bath of 25 mL of AZ500k 1:3 Developer in 6\" glass dish for 3-5 min or until bath turns purple and features emerge.\n\t\nRemove the wafer and rinse well with DI water.\nAssess pre-reflow height using a profilometer (stylus force of 10.5 mg).\n\t\tNOTE: Operate the profilometer according to manufacturer instructions, carefully positioning the force stylus next to a feature channel on the desired layer before profiling. Settings used throughout this protocol were the following: stylus force 10.5 mg, length 1,000 µm, speed 200 µm/s, regime down-up.\nReflow hard bake the wafer to melt and round valve features as follows: 65 °C - 190 °C, 15 hr, 10 °C/hr ramping speed.\nLet the wafer cool to RT. Assess post-reflow height using a profilometer (stylus force of 10.5 mg). Heights of 55 µm ± 2 µm should be expected for this device geometry.\n3. Fabricating Variable Height Features in Tandem\nProceed to variable height fabrication with the developed wafer with Flow Low, Flow High and Herringbone Mixer transparencies of the Bead Synthesizer design.",
    "To adjust protocol for the designs, use manufacture data sheets25 to determine exposure energy, spin speeds and bake time parameters, allowing for ± 5% tolerance.\n\tNOTE: This protocol fabricates a 55 µm tall Flow Low layer using SU-8 2050 negative photoresist spun over the valve features.\nPlace the cleaned wafer on spin coater, turn on the vacuum to affix it to the spin chuck, and blow away dust with N2 or compressed air.\nApply 1-2 ml of SU-8 2050 negative photoresist to center of the wafer and spin as follows: spread: 500 rpm, 10 sec, 133 rpm/sec acceleration; cast: 3,000 rpm, 40 sec, 266 rpm/sec acceleration. Spin photoresist over developed valve features.\nCarefully place the spun wafer in 5\" Petri dish and let relax for 20 min on flat surface or until any streaking patterns fade.\nRemove the wafer and soft bake by placing on two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C as follows: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 8 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nAllow the wafer to cool to RT.\nTape the Flow Low transparency mask to a quartz 5\" glass plate print-side down (closest to the wafer) and load into the mask positioner of the UV mask aligner.\nPlace the wafer in UV mask aligner chuck and, using microscope eyepiece or camera, carefully align new Flow Low layer features to Flow Round valve layer features. Begin by aligning horizontal, vertical and tilt axes of device borders to the device border features on mask. Next, align cross-hair features between layers. Finally, confirm that valve features intersect Flow Low features where applicable.\nExpose to 170 mJ UV deposition (28 sec at ~6.2 mW/cm2).",
    "Remove the wafer and post-exposure bake by switching between two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C as follows: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 9 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nWithout developing, allow the wafer to cool to RT and proceed to fabrication of Flow High layer. This Flow High layer will add 30 µm of photoresist to the undeveloped 55 µm photoresist layer to yield 85 µm features in previously unexposed locations.\nRepeat steps 3.3 to 3.10 using SU-8 2025 and the Flow High layer mask with these modifications for the spin coat settings: spread: 500 rpm, 10 sec, 133 rpm/s acceleration; cast: 3,500 rpm, 40 sec, 266 rpm/sec acceleration.\nExpose to 198 mJ UV deposition (32 s at ~6.2 mW/cm2).\nWithout developing, allow the wafer to cool to RT and proceed to fabrication of Chaotic Mixer Herringbone layer. Final features in this layer will have a total height of 125 µm: 55 µm from the Flow Low layer, 30 µm from the Flow Square layer, and 40 µm from this Chaotic Mixer Herringbone layer (see Figure 3) and include 35 µm herringbone grooves.\nRepeat steps 3.3 to 3.10 using SU-8 2025 and the Herringbone layer mask with the following modifications, ensuring that herringbone grooves are completely within Flow High channel outlines.\nUse the following soft bake program: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 7 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nExpose to 148 mJ UV deposition (24 s at ~6.2 mW/cm2).\nAfter all layers have been completed, develop by immersing the wafer in a stirred bath of 25 ml of SU-8 developer in a 6\" glass dish for 3.5 min or until features clearly emerge. Check that features have clear, defined feature boundaries using a stereoscope.",
    "Hard bake the wafer to stabilize all photoresist features on a hot plate as follows: 65 °C - 165 °C, 2 hr 30 min, 120 °C/h ramping speed.\nAssess feature height in all layers using a profilometer (stylus force of 10.5 mg).\n4. Control Wafer Fabrication\nClean, dehydrate, and fabricate a 5 µm adhesion layer on a new 4\" silicon wafer as in Section 4.\nFabricate a 25 µm Control Layer using SU-8 2025 negative photoresist.\nPlace the wafer on a spin coater, turn on vacuum to affix it to the spin chuck, and blow away dust with N2 or compressed air.\nApply 1-2 ml of SU-8 2025 negative photoresist in the center of the wafer and spin as follows: spread: 500 rpm, 10 sec, 133 rpm/s acceleration; cast: 3,500 rpm, 40 sec, 266 rpm/sec acceleration.\nRemove the wafer and soft bake by switching between two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C as follows: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 5 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nAllow the wafer to cool to RT.\nAlign the control transparency mask to a 5\" glass plate and load into UV mask aligner.\nPlace the wafer in chuck of UV mask aligner and expose to 155 mJ UV deposition (25 sec at ~6.2 mW/cm2 lamp intensity).\nRemove the wafer and post-exposure bake by switching between two hotplates set at 65 °C and 95 °C as follows: 65 °C: 2 min, 95 °C: 6 min, 65 °C: 2 min.\nDevelop by immersing the wafer in a stirred bath of 25 ml of SU-8 Developer in 6\" glass dish for 1 min or until features emerge. Check features using a stereoscope.\nHard bake the wafer to stabilize photoresist features as follows: 65 °C - 165 °C, 2 hr 30 min, 120 °C/hr ramping speed.",
    "5. Silane Wafer Treatment for Easy PDMS Lift-off\nPlace the completed wafers in wafer rack within a bell-jar vacuum desiccator inside a fume hood free of water or water-soluble reagents.\nUnder the hood, use a dropper to apply 1 drop of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (PFOTS) to a glass slide and place inside the desiccator.\nClose the desiccator lid and apply vacuum for 1 min.\nAfter 1 min, turn off vacuum without re-pressurizing or evacuating bell jar.\nLet the mixture sit for 10 min while aerosolized PFOTS coats wafer surface.\nOpen the bell jar lid and remove wafer using tweezers. Place into a Petri dish for PDMS replica molding. Dispose of silane-coated slides in proper hazardous waste.\n\tNOTE: Wafers coated with fluorinated silanes can be used hundreds to thousands of times without re-treatment. A sacrificial layer of 1:10 PDMS can be cast on wafers, cured, and discarded after the first silane treatment to remove excess silane groups from wafer surface.\n6. PDMS Replica Molding\nFabricate multilayer microfluidic devices in a \"push up\" geometry on glass according to existing open-access protocols16.\n\tNOTE: A detailed protocol can additionally be found on the website27.\nBy visual inspection, ensure all valves are aligned properly to control lines and all inlets (on both the flow and control layers) are punched fully before proceeding.\n7. Production of Hydrogel Beads from Droplets\nConnect tubing (e.g., Tygon) loaded with water to a flow control system (e.g., syringe pumps, fluidic controllers, or an open-source solenoid valve array with reservoirs28).\nConnect metal pins to tubing and connect to device ports at control line inlets. Pressurize device control lines by setting the flow control system of choice to 25 psi for each line. Ensure that valves close and re-open by inspection under the microscope.",
    "NOTE: Follow manufacturer instructions for the flow control system of choice. In this work, a custom software-controlled pneumatic system applies pressure to each line using solenoid valves that toggle between 25 psi compressed air (pressurized) and atmospheric pressure (depressurized). Details on this system can be found in Discussion.\nPrepare custom microfluidic pressure vessels for reagent and oil loading.\nUsing a push-pin, punch two holes in the top of a cryogenic vial tube, insert capillary PEEK tubing into one hole, and insert a metal pin connected to the tubing into the second hole.\nSeal tubing in place with epoxy. Let dry for 1 hr.\nWhile waiting, in a microcentrifuge tube, suspend 3.9 mg of LAP photoinitiator into 100 µl of DI water ([LAP] = 39 mg/ml) to prepare photoinitiator solution used for polymerizing droplets to hydrogel beads. Protect from light.\nIn a second microcentrifuge tube, add 132 µl DI water, 172 µL PEG diacrylate, 12 µl LAP solution, and 85 µL HEPES buffer to make hydrogel droplet solution.\nTransfer the hydrogel droplet solution to the completed cryogenic tube vessel.\n\tNOTE: Additives for other applications such as nanocrystals, magnetic particles or biological molecules can be included within the HEPES component.\nConnect the tubing of the cryogenic tube vessel to a controllable pressure source and connect the PEEK tubing to the device reagent inlet.\nPrepare 10 mL of light mineral oil with 2% v/v nonionic surfactant (e.g., Span 80) and 0.05% EM90 for oil droplet emulsion. Filter using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and load 1 ml into a second cryogenic tube vessel.\nInsert PEEK tubing at the device outlet for collection of droplets.",
    "Remove air bubbles from the device by pressurizing oil, water, or PEG mixture inlets (4 psi operational pressure). Turn on all valves. Sequentially turn off each valve in a fluid pathway after 1 min or until air bubbles have permeated through the PDMS device. For instance, to de-bubble herringbone mixers, turn on valves Inlet 1, Mix 1 out, and Mix Waste. Then depressurize Inlet 1, Mix 1 out, and Mix Waste until all bubbles are gone.\nWhen the device is repressurized after debubbling, depressurize Ro1 oil valve and set oil pressure to 10 psi.\nSet PEG mixture pressure to 9 psi, depressure upstream valves (Inlet 1, Drops 1) and adjust as necessary to produce droplets of the desired size. Droplet size can be determined via microscopy using a camera with 50 fps or higher.\nWhen the droplets have stabilized, position a 5 mm spot from a UV light source (e.g., a UV spot curing system with liquid light guide (LLG) or a focused UV LED) over the polymerization region of the device and apply 100 mW/cm2 UV (365 nm) from the UV source.\nPressurize bead sieve valve to watch polymerized beads collect and ensure that droplets have hardened into beads. Adjust LLG as necessary to achieve full polymerization.\nDepressurize bead sieve valve and collect beads into tube through outlet PEEK tubing.\nSubscription Required.
