    "All experiments described were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nNOTE: Select cancer cells and fibroblasts that match the host mice for mouse strain. Select cancer cells and fibroblasts that match the sex of the host mouse. Obtain mice from breeding colonies or purchase them from reputable vendors. Introduce tumors into mice that are ~8-10 weeks of age. Mice with fur will be in the telogen or resting phase of the hair follicle cycle. Plan for a ratio of 0.5 to 3 fibroblasts to cancer cell.\n1. Determine the appropriate number of mice to be used for experimentation\nPrior to performing the studies, perform a power analysis to determine the appropriate number of mice to use for the studies. Use the following formula to determine sample size for an experiment with the specified power:\n\tn = (Z(1-α/2)+Z(1-β)/ES)2\n\tIf α is the selected level of significance (usually 0.05), then 1-α/2 = 0.975 and Z=1.960.\n\tβ is the power and if 80% power is desired, then Z=0.84.\n\tES, the effect size = \\μ1-μ0\\/σ\n\twhere μ0 is the mean under hypothesis H0, μ1 is the mean under hypothesis H1, and σ is the standard deviation of the outcome of interest22.\n\tNOTE: More information on calculating sample size can be found22.\n2. Generate cancer cells for injection\nDetermine the relevant growth rate with the following equation:\n\tGr = (ln (N(t)/N(0)))/t\n\tNOTE: An example for cells that double in 24 hours is shown\n\tDoubling time = ln(2)/growth rate\n\t24 hours = ln(2)/growth rate\n\t24*growth rate = .693\n\tGrowth rate = .693/24= .028875\nDetermine the number of cancer cells to plate and the amount of time the cells need to be grown prior to injection.\n\tNOTE: 0.25-1 million cancer cells are injected for each tumor formed.",
    "Calculate the number of days required to generate a sufficient number of cells according to the equation\n\tN(t)=N(0)egr*t\n\twhere N(t) is the number of cells at time t, N(0) is the number of cells at time 0, gr is the growth rate, and t is the time.\n\tNOTE: An example of these calculations for growing 500,000 cells to generate 106 cells into each of 12 tumors. Based on these calculations, 5 days is sufficient to grow the necessary number of cells:\n\tN(t)=N(0)egr*t\n\t12 x 106 = 500,000e(gr*t)\n\t12 x 106=500,000e(.028875*t)\n\t24=e(.028875*x)\n\tln(24)=0.028875x\n\t3.178=0.028875x\n\t​X=110 hours= 4.59 days\n\tAllow extra time for cells to attach to the plate and for cells that are lost during collection.\nPlate cancer cells.\n\tNOTE: Wear gloves and lab coats when working with cultured cells.\n\tNOTE: Perform cell manipulations in a laminar flow hood to minimize the introduction of microbes from the air into the samples. Treat the tissue culture hood with ultraviolet light prior to use. Use sterile technique and only sterile cell culture plasticware and consumables such as tissue culture-treated plates, pipets, and conical tubes.\n\t\nCalculate the correct number and size of tissue culture plates based on the number of cells in the vial and the desired cell concentration once plated.\nLabel tissue culture plates.\nPrepare a water bath with water at 37 °C.\nAliquot medium into conical tubes and place in a water bath at 37 °C. Many cancer cells can be grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nRemove the required number of vials of frozen cells from the liquid nitrogen freezer.\n\t\tNOTE: Use freezer gloves when handling cells in a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nQuickly thaw the cell vials in the water bath while gently shaking.",
    "​NOTE: Add ethanol to gloves while handling vials to maintain sterility.\nUsing sterile technique in a tissue culture hood, pipet the cells into a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge the cell mixture at 180 x g for 5 minutes.\nGently remove the supernatant with sterile suction or a sterile 10 mL pipet.\nGently resuspend the cells in the pellet into 1 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS.\nPipet the resuspended cells onto a labeled tissue culture plate with a sterile p1000.\nUsing sterile 10 mL pipets, pipet medium with serum into tissue culture plates.\nIncubate tissue culture plates in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nExpand cancer cells to generate sufficient cancer cells for injection.\n\tNOTE: Monitor cells with light microscopy for confluency. Trypsinize every two to three days or as needed to prevent the cells from reaching 100% confluence. If a large number of cells are required, use hyperflasks (Table of Materials) to grow a large number of cells in a space- and medium-efficient way. Each time the cells need to be passaged, follow this procedure:\n\t\nRemove the medium from the plate with sterile suction or a sterile 10 mL pipet.\nGently wash the plate by pipetting on warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Then remove the PBS with sterile suction or a pipet.\nPipet 5 mL of 1x Trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS for a 10 cm plate onto the cells and incubate for 5 minutes at 37 °C.\nRemove cells from the plate with gentle taps to dislodge the cells from the plate.\nUsing a sterile 10 mL pipet, collect the cells into DMEM with 10% FBS serum in conical tubes.\nCentrifuge conical tubes at 180 x g for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the supernatant by pouring it off. The cell pellet should be visible. Watch it to make sure it remains in the tube.\nResuspend the pelleted cells by adding 1 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS and pipetting up and down gently.\nAliquot resuspended cells onto new tissue culture plates of the appropriate size with DMEM + 10% FBS (10 mL of media is suitable for a 10 cm tissue culture plate).\n3. Generate fibroblasts for injection\nNOTE: Primary fibroblasts will senesce after too many doublings/passages. It is important to use primary fibroblasts after a limited number of passages or doublings. Keep track of the number of passages or doublings that the fibroblasts have grown from the mouse or human skin. Use fibroblasts with fewer than 15 passages for primary human dermal fibroblasts. Use fibroblasts with fewer than 9 passages for mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are altered when they become confluent. Trypsinize the fibroblasts when they are approximately 90% confluent. Fibroblasts will have different properties depending on how they are cultured. Many scientists promote culturing on more physiologically relevant substrates than tissue culture plates such as 3D collagen matrices that more effectively capture tissue-like environments23,24,25.\nUse the equation in section 2.1 to determine the growth rate for the fibroblast cells.\nUse the equation in section 2.2 to determine the number of days required to expand the fibroblasts.\nPlate the fibroblasts as described in section 2.3 using the appropriate medium on the appropriate day to ensure cancer cells and fibroblasts will be ready for injection on the same day.\nExpand the fibroblasts in the appropriate medium to generate a sufficient number of fibroblasts needed following the procedures described in section 2.4.\n4. Shave mice to prepare mice for injection",
    "NOTE: Wear lab coats, hair nets, shoe covers, and gloves when working with mice.\nOne to two days prior to injection, in accordance with the rules of the Institutional Animal Care Committee, anesthetize the mice. If using isoflurane for anesthesia, use a mixture of isoflurane and O2. Place the mice in an anesthesia chamber and introduce an isoflurane (5%)/ O2 mixture to induce anesthesia. Then, place the nose cone on the anesthetized animal to maintain the surgical plane of anesthesia with a constant flow of isoflurane (2%)/O2 mixture.\nCheck the animals to ensure they are in the appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia by pinching the mouse's toe and confirming the mouse does not move.\nUsing an animal clipper with surgical blade #40, gently remove the fur from the appropriate positions on the flanks of the mice by passing the animal clipper over the skin multiple times until the fur is removed.\nMonitor the mice until they recover from anesthesia.\n5. Prepare cancer cells and fibroblasts for injection\nNOTE: Cancer cells and fibroblasts should be injected as soon as possible after collection, preferably within 30 minutes. On the morning of the injection, harvest the cancer cells and fibroblasts separately from tissue culture plates. For each cell type perform the following steps:\nRemove the medium from the tissue culture plate with gentle sterile suction or by pipetting off the medium.\nGently pipet on 5 mL of PBS without disrupting the cells. Swirl the PBS. Gently aspirate the PBS with suction or pipet off the PBS.\nGently pipet 5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA in PBS onto the cells layer and incubate for 5 minutes at 37 °C.",
    "Remove cells from the plate with gentle taps to dislodge the cells. Pipet the cells several times with a 10 mL pipet and transfer the cells to a conical tube containing DMEM with 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes at 180 x g for 5 minutes.\nRemove the supernatant by gently pouring it off, retaining the cell pellet. Wash the cell pellet twice with PBS. Each time, pipet 10 mL of PBS onto the cells. Gently mix with a p1000 pipet.\nCentrifuge the cells as in step 5.5. Gently remove the PBS with a pipette and repeat.\nResuspend the washed, pelleted cells in 1 mL of PBS with a p1000.\nClean a hemocytometer slide with alcohol and dry.\nPipet 100 µL of the cell mixture into a tube and add 400 µL of 0.4% Trypan blue for a final Trypan blue concentration of 0.32%.\nGently fill the chambers of a glass hemocytometer underneath the coverslip by pipetting the cell mixture until the chamber is full.\nUsing a microscope, focus on the grid lines of a 10x objective.\nCount the live, unstained cells and blue cells in one set of 16 squares.\nCount all 4 sets of 16 squares.\nAverage the cell count for the clear and blue cells from the 4 sets of 16 squares and multiply by 10,000. Multiply by 5 to correct for the 1:5 dilution from the Trypan blue.\nThe final counts are the concentration in cells/mL for the viable and dead cells. Multiply by the volume to determine the total number of cancer cells and fibroblasts. Confirm that the fraction of cells that are viable is >80%.\nConfirm that there are a sufficient number of melanoma cells and fibroblasts for all of the injections planned, assuming at least 20% loss of sample during the injections.",
    "Transfer the required number of cells to a new conical tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation (180 x g for 5 minutes).\nRemove the supernatant with a 10 mL pipet.\nResuspend the pellet at the required concentration in the appropriate amount of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) GRADE PBS (50 µL per tumor for intradermal injection and 100 µL per tumor for subcutaneous injection).\n6. Inject cancer cells and fibroblasts into mice\nNOTE: If approved by the institutional Animal Care Committee, inject two tumors into each mouse, one on each flank. Randomize which mouse will receive which injection on the right and left flanks. Depending on the number of mice to be injected, anesthetize the mice and inject cancer cells and fibroblasts into the mice in batches.\nFor subcutaneous injection of cancer cells\n\t\nAnesthetize mice as described in section 4.1.\nWipe the shaved skin with alcohol swabs.\nFill a sterile syringe with the desired volume of cells or cell mixture and cap the syringe with a 27-gauge needle.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure no air bubbles are present. Flick the syringe as needed to remove bubbles. Once cells have been introduced into the syringe, keep the cells within the syringes well-mixed by continuously inverting the syringes to prevent clumping.\nInsert the needle into the subcutaneous region on the mouse's flank and gently inject the cells into the mouse. Use 100 μL cell suspension per tumor for subcutaneous injection(using volume more than 100 μL per injection is not recommended).\nMonitor the mice until they recover from anesthesia. If needed, provide the mice with extra insulating materials like huts and/or heating pads to help the mice to fully recover.\nFor intradermal injections of cancer cells\n\t\nAnesthetize mice as described in section 4.1.\nWipe the shaved skin with alcohol swabs.",
    "Fill a sterile syringe with the desired volume of cells or cell mixture and cap the syringe with a 27-gauge needle.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure no air bubbles are present. Flick the syringe as needed to remove bubbles. Once cells have been introduced into the syringe, keep the cells within the syringes well-mixed by continuously inverting the syringes to prevent clumping.\nInsert a 27-gauge needle into the intradermal region of the skin on the mouse's flank and gently inject the cells into the intradermal region in the mouse. Use 50μL cell suspension per tumor for intradermal injection (using volume more than 50 μL per injection is not recommended).\nMonitor the mice until they recover from anesthesia. If there are signs that the mice are in distress, consult a veterinarian. If needed, provide the mice with extra insulating materials like huts and/or heating pads to help the mice to fully recover.\n7. Monitor mice during tumor growth\nMonitor mice daily for any signs of pain or distress (hunched posture, writhing, vocalization, stretching out along the cage, pressing their abdomen to the bottom of the cage floor, or reluctance to move around the cage) or abscess formation. If there are signs that the mice are in distress, consult a veterinarian.\nOnce tumors are formed, measure tumor volume approximately every two to three days. Measure tumor length (the longest side) and width (perpendicular to length) with calipers.\n\tNOTE: Best practices are for the same person to perform these measurements throughout the experiment to reduce variability in the data. For measurements, anesthetize mice as described in section 4.1\nCalculate tumor volumes with the formula Volume= 0.5 x (Length x Width2).\n8. Harvest tumors and measure tumor weights",
    "Euthanize mice when tumor growth reaches an experimental endpoint established by the institution Committee on Animal Care. Place mice in a chamber and euthanize them with slow (20-30% per minute) displacement of chamber air with compressed CO2 for one minute past cessation of respiration.\nPerform cervical dislocation on the mice. Restrain the rodent on a firm, flat surface. Place a sturdy pen or another object against the back of the neck at the base of the skull. Quickly push forward and down with the object restraining the head while pulling backward with the hand holding the base of the tail. Confirm with palpation that the spinal cord is severed.\n\tNOTE: Cervical dislocation should be performed by experienced lab personnel.\nFor each mouse in the experiment, confirm that the mouse is no longer alive by checking that there is no breathing, no heartbeat and no response to a toe pinch.\nUsing a sterile scalpel and surgical scissors, excise the entire tumor from the mouse. With surgical scissors, trim non-tumor tissue from the tumor.\nWeigh the tumor on an analytical balance and record the tumor weight.\n9. Statistical analysis of tumor volumes and tumor weights\nCompare tumor volumes over time in each group with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Perform paired analysis if two tumors were injected per mouse.\nCompare tumor weights among the groups with ANOVA using a two-tailed test. Tukey's post-hoc test can then be used to determine which groups are significantly different from each other. Perform paired analysis if two tumors were injected per mouse.\nSubscription Required.
