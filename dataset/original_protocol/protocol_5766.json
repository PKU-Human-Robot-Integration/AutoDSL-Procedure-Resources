    "Plant and virus preparationGrow rice plants under the following greenhouse conditions during the whole experiment - approximately 12 h of light, 28 ± 1°C (day) and 25 ± 1°C (night), and 75% relative humidity. Perform inoculation at the 2 to 3-leaves development stage (Figure 1), roughly 2 weeks after inoculation (WAI). Apply a suitable fertilizer to the soil for optimal growth.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180530/20180530183249_1508.jpgFigure 1. Two weeks old IR64 plants, ready for inoculationUse the following recommended rice varieties as checks: IR64, Bouake 189 or BG90-2 (susceptible O. sativa varieties); Azucena or Moroberekan (partially resistant O. sativa controls); accessions with any of the high resistance genes (RYMV1, RYMV2 or RYMV3; Thiémélé et al., 2010; Orjuela et al., 2013; Pidon et al., 2017) (resistant controls).Propagate RYMV isolates on any of the susceptible control accessions – it is highly recommended to always use the same accession. Mechanically inoculate the plants (as described below) and harvest the leaves at 3 WAI when symptoms reach the 5 to 7 severity level (the symptoms severity scale is described below). Infected leaves may be kept at -20 °C for several months or years.InoculationCut the RYMV-infected leaves to be used as the source of inoculum into 0.5-1 cm pieces. Add Fontainebleau sand (about 200 mg to 1 g of leaves). Grind the mixture in a mortar with 0.1 M phosphate inoculation buffer, pH 7.2 (10 ml of buffer to 1 g of leaves) (Recipe 1; see Video 1). A minimum of 100 µl of inoculum per plant is required.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation of RYMV inoculum from infected rice leaves Add two pinches of carborundum and mix with a pestle.Using gloves, rub leaves twice with ground inoculum as shown in Video 2. Keep at least 5 plants of the susceptible check variety as a non-inoculated control.",
    "After 5 min, rinse the leaves with water to eliminate the excess carborundum (see Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Mechanical inoculation of RYMV on rice leaves Symptoms observationObservation for symptoms can start between 10 and 15 days after inoculation (DAI), when symptoms first appear on susceptible control plants. The date of appearance of symptoms can be monitored on each plant on a daily basis. Symptoms are observed on newly emerged leaves.The symptom severity scale on the leaves (Figure 2) is derived from the Standard Evaluation System for Rice (IRRI, 2002) but does not consider a reduction in plant height and delayed flowering:1 = Leaves green (no apparent symptoms);3 = Leaves green but with sparse dots or streaks;5 = Leaves green or pale green with mottling;7 = Leaves pale yellow or yellow;9 = Leaves turn orange or show necrosis and sometimes die.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180530/20180530185012_7683.jpgFigure 2. Symptom severity scale on rice leavesDAS-ELISAHarvest samples of the last emerged leaves between 10 and 15 DAI. The samples can be used fresh, rapidly frozen at -20 °C, or dried in a herbarium.For sample preparation with tissue lyser (QIAGEN), place 25 mg of fresh material (or 10 mg of dried material) in a 2 ml tube with a metal bead. Put the tubes in liquid nitrogen for 5 min. Grind in tissue lyser for 30 sec at an oscillation frequency of 30 Hz. Add 500 μl of 1x PBST. Vortex vigorously. Alternatively, grind the same quantity of samples with pestle and mortar with 500 µl of 1x PBST and then transfer to a 2 ml tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 5,200 x g. Keep the samples for up to 24 h at 4 °C or frozen at -20 °C before using them for the ELISA test.",
    "CoatingDilute antibodies directed against purified RYMV virions in the coating buffer (Recipe 2) to a concentration of 1 µg/ml IgG or according to the dilution factor recommended by the provider. Add 100 μl of antibodies solution per well, except in the wells at the edges of the plate which should be filled to avoid edge effect. Cover the plate and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C in a moist environment (box with moist paper).WashingDiscard the coating solution from the wells. Wash the plate by filling the wells with 1x PBST using a wash bottle and decant the washing buffer immediately (for a quick wash) or after 3 min. Proceed successively to a quick wash and three 3 min-washes. Remove residual buffer on a paper towel (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. DAS-ELISA plate washing BlockingAdd 200 μl of 3% (3 g by 100 ml) skimmed milk in 1x PBST per well. Cover the plate and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.WashingDiscard the solution and wash for 3 min with 1x PBST. Remove residual buffer on a paper towel.Deposit of antigensAdd 100 µl of the sample supernatant to the wells. Cover the plate and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. Always include positive controls (usually the RYMV inoculum) and negative controls (PBST buffer alone and non-inoculated plant) among samples. Two technical replicates of both controls and samples are recommended.WashingDiscard the sample solution from the wells and remove residual sample solution on a paper towel to avoid inter-well contamination. Proceed to wash with 1x PBST as described in Step C2 above and remove residual buffer on a paper towel.Addition of enzyme-conjugated antibodiesDilute the antibody against RYMV conjugated with alkaline phosphatase in 1x PBST according to the recommendations of the provider or as determined experimentally according to Hill et al. (1981).",
    "Add 100 μl of the conjugated antibodies solution per well. Cover the plates and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.WashingProceed to wash as described in Step C2 above.Addition of substrate Dissolve pNPP tablets in the substrate buffer (1 mg/ml; Recipe 3). As pNPP is light-sensitive, be careful to keep it in the dark as much as possible. Add 100 μl of substrate solution per well. Incubate in the dark and at room temperature for 1 h. Read the optical density (OD) at 405 nm on a microplate reader."
