    "1. Preparation of the Molecular Probe and Flow Cytometer\nDilute stock solutions of the nucleic acid probes, which are supplied as a 5 mM solution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to aliquots of required concentrations in ultrapure filtered H2O.\nStore the nucleic acid probes in dark conditions between -5 oC and - 25 oC until use.\nTurn on the flow cytometer and load software package (see table of Materials/Equipment for FCM specifications).\nPlace an empty haemolysis tube (12 x 75 mm) on the sample injection probe (SIP), click unclog and then back flush to start the FCM cleaning process.\nNOTE: Some sample stages for the SIP can accommodate several types of tubes including microcentrifuge tubes.  The molecular probe diluent and sheath fluid used in the FCM apparatus is from an analytical grade “type 1” 0.22 µm membrane filtered source.\nPlace a fresh haemolysis tube with 2 ml of ultrapure filtered H2O on the SIP, set a time limit for 10 - 15 min and a fluidic speed to fast (or a flow rate of >66 µl/min).\nSelect a new data cell, put on relevant thresholds for fluorescence and light scatter channels to reduce background noise and click 'run'.\nIf the total events per second are not below the manufacturers' recommendation, then run a 2 ml sample of decontamination solution for 2 min on fast and then repeat steps 1.4 & 1.5.",
    "NOTE: Please check manufacturers’ recommendations for FCM start-up cleaning protocols, as they can vary between models.  Testing for specific thresholds also needs to be in line with the FCM model as some equipment allows the user to apply voltages gains to the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) enhancing or decreasing the electrical signal recorded from the optical detectors.  The FCM model used in this experiment has fixed voltage PMTs and used a threshold of 80,000 forward light scatter (FSC-H) to exclude particles smaller than 2.0 µm and electronic noise.\n2. Preparation of Cultures and Initial Cell Counts\nAutoclave 98 ml of ultrapure filtered H2O and 2 ml of algal media (x50 concentration) in a 250 ml beaker for 20 min at 120 oC.\nFrom an initial monoculture of M.aeruginosa (PCC 7806) in a high steady state density place 2 ml of the sample into a tube under the SIP. Disaggregate any colony formation by vortexing or sonication20 and confirm evenly dispersed cells through light microscopy.\nNOTE: Excessive exposure to ultrasonic waves can lead to cell lysis and should be used with caution.  Since sonication can collapse gas vesicles (as found in species like M.aeruginosa) outputs such as side light scatter (SSC-H) intensity can become more sensitive.\nWithin the FCM software, select a histogram plot to record data from forward light scatter (FSC-H) and configure the plot specifications by clicking \"log\" to view in a log scale on the axis.\nIn a separate output, select another histogram (log axis) to record natural fluorescence such as the accessory photosynthetic pigment phycocyanin (FL4-H, 675 ± 12.5 nm), found in M.aeruginosa.\nUse a light source that can excite phycocyanin and a detector which can filter the emissions from the resulting fluorescence.",
    "NOTE: Photosynthetic pigment such as chlorophyll can be excited with the commonly used 488 nm blue laser, whereas phycocyanin is excited over 600 nm and will only be detected with a red light source21.  Check with the flow cytometers manufacturer for excitation light sources and the spectra of emission detectors, here both a 488 nm and a 640 nm laser were used along with a 675 ± 12.5 nm optical filter.\nFor recording of the highest resolution select settings closest to the core size of the target organism (10 µm) and a relatively slow flow rate (14 µl/min).\nNOTE: For the best resolution samples should be run according to manufactures recommendation of events per second.\nBefore acquiring data use a threshold to gate out light scatter and / or fluorescence signals that are caused by electronic background noise or cell sample debris.\nSelect a new data cell, create a density plot with FSC-H and SSC-H parameters on a log scale and click run.\nIf sample density leads to an excessive event rate, dilution steps can be taken to increase accuracy and precision.\nOn the density plot apply software gates from the previous histogram to exclude low level scatter signals, produced by background noise or debris (FSC <320,000). Conversely gate the higher relative fluorescence phycocyanin signals from cells and only include these events (FL4, 56,000 - 1,950,000).\nUse the number of cells recorded in the gated areas and divide it by the total volume of sample that has passed through the FCM, to work out how many cells per ml.\nNOTE: The FCM model used here has a microprocessor controlled peristaltic pump system allowing sample volume to be determined.  Other FCM equipment may require a calibrated bead suspension or a calculation of H2O weight/volume differences to verify total sample volume.",
    "Add the required volume of cells to the freshly prepared media in order to start a batch growth cycle (250,000 cells/ml) of M.aeruginosa.\nNOTE: Species will differ in growth rates depending on their in-situ environment parameters and nutrient availability, so a batch cycle should be pre-recorded to determine life cycle phases.\n3. Optimization of Molecular Probe Cell Uptake\nHarvest half of the M.aeruginosa culture prepared in step 2 from an exponential phase and use as a 'live' control.\nNOTE: Samples diluted from a high density culture straight to an exponential phase may affect optimization results through dead cell turnover, compared to that of cultures inoculated from an initial lag / induction phase.\nPrepare the other half as a 'dead' control by using methods such as 70% ethanol, heating samples at 60 oC for 1 hr, paraformaldehyde or 4% formaldehyde for 30 min6,11,22. Check variations in the samples microenvironment (e.g., pH).\nNOTE: The positive, heat-killed, ‘dead’ control in M.aeruginosa is distinguished from a ‘live’ sample through its decrease in phycocyanin signals.  Inducing mortality by other methods may not cause the same output and will vary in species.\nSet up mixed samples using different ratios of 'live' and 'dead' samples (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%).\nDisaggregate colony formation by vortexing or sonication and check pH.\nSelect a 488 nm laser alongside detectors which can record fluorescence from the green (FL1, 530 ± 15 nm) and orange (FL2, 585 ± 20 nm) nucleic acid probes and the 640 nm laser to record phycocyanin signals through its respective detector.",
    "NOTE: When bound to DNA, the green nucleic acid probe has an approximate fluorescence excitation wavelength of 504 nm and emission maxima of 523 nm, whilst the orange nucleic acid probe has an excitation wavelength of 547 nm and emissions maxima of 570 nm.  A 488 nm argon ion solid state laser can be employed to excite both molecular probes, however, a green laser (up to 547 nm) will produce a higher orange fluorescence.\nAs a starting point, introduce the molecular probe with manufacturers recommended concentration to the 50% 'live' and 50% 'dead' culture and incubate in the dark.\nSelect a new data cell, place the sample under the SIP with thresholds and triggers that will reduce background noise (FSC-H 80,000).\nCreate a density plot with FSC-H and SSC-H parameters, and three histograms. One histogram using the respective molecular probe optical detector channel (FL1 or 2), one to detect phycocyanin emissions (FL4-H) and the other FSC-H, all on a log scale.\nIncubate the samples of M.aeruginosa with the nucleic acid probes in darkness for up to 60 min, recording in separate data cells, at a number of time points (1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min).\nNOTE: When adjusting parameters such as pH check with manufactures for potential reactions from certain chemicals (for the tested nucleic acid probes a buffer cannot contain phosphates or high levels of monovalent or divalent cations, as the binding with DNA will be reduced).\nApply a software gate to only include the FSC-H histogram (320,000 - 1,500,000) for the target organisms cell size, into the respective fluorescence probe channel histogram.",
    "NOTE: The concentrations used in this protocol were 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 µM, which can be altered by either increasing or decreasing the volume of M.aeruginosa sample or initial stock solution of nucleic probes.\nIn the fluorescence probe channel, apply another inclusive software gate to the highest peak in the histogram (green FL1-H, 240,000 - 1,650,000, orange FL2-H, 30,000 - 165,000) and subsequently gate that positive probe fluorescence into the density plot.\nRun steps 3.1 - 3.11 with 100% \"live\", 100% 'dead' and all mixed culture samples, adjusting the molecular probe concentrations (e.g x 0.1 to x 10) and / or temperature and pH levels if necessary.\nCompare the number of positive molecular probe fluorescence signals to the original cell density of 'dead' cells (taken from half total FSC-H or a 100% 'dead' culture) to find the total percentage of cells stained with the nucleic acid probes.\nDo this for each time period within each concentration to find the optimal protocol for the highest percentage of cell nucleic probe uptake without producing non-specific staining (use the means in a One-Way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, if the data is non-parametric).\n4. Molecular Probe Fluorescence Discrimination\nFor testing of fluorescence interference / overlap from intrinsic or non-specific cell staining select the 50% 'live' and 50% 'dead' mixed culture data and take off all gates.\nApply a software gate to only include the FSC-H histogram (320,000 - 1,500,000) for the target organisms cell size, into the phycocyanin channel histogram.\nGate the highest phycocyanin peak and label as 'live', with the addition of the lowest peak labelled as 'dead'.",
    "Perform a further gate step into the respective molecular probe fluorescence histogram channel, using one at a time, the 'live' and then 'dead' phycocyanin (FL4) signals, recording both mean wavelengths.\nNOTE:  The mode for inducing mortality in this experiment was done by heat treatment, which under this protocol clearly decreases phycocyanin signals.  Other methods of producing populations of ‘dead’ cells may yield different outputs in the acquired runs.\nRatio the mean wavelengths of the positive molecular probe fluorescence ('dead') and the intrinsic / non-specific signal ('live') to determine protocol sensitivity.\nNOTE: To improve fluorescence discrimination of ‘live’ and ‘dead’ populations, increase the carbon source to active stain uptake in nutrient depleted cells or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to improve cell wall permeability and resulting fluorescence signals6.  Limited compensation in some FCM models for spectral overlap can be performed by user-manipulated pairwise correction during sample acquisition (PMT voltage changes) or from post-analytical specialised software.\nSelect the optimized protocol where the highest amount of 'dead' cells has been stained without the occurrence non-specific staining. If a number of test have similar results accept the protocol with the lowest concentration and incubation time, along with good fluorescence signal discrimination.
