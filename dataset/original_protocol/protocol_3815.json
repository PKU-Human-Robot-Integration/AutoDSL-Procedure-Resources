The experimental approach—briefly summarized—entailed synchronizing cells at the G1/S transition followed by releasing them into S phase in the presence of 200 mM HU. At the first level of comparison, i.e., within the same strain, we identified DSBs enriched in HU-treated sample compared to the G1 control sample using MACS2 peak calling in both samples simultaneously. Therefore, in this section we use this approach as an example. In addition to the current approach we have also compared DSBs in replication inhibitor-treated cells to those in vehicle-treated cells in asynchronous cell cultures (I.J. and W.F., unpublished data). Importantly, in this unpublished study we have also identified DSBs in vehicle-treated cells, i.e., spontaneously DSBs, by applying single-sample peak calling in MACS2. Therefore, our experimental approach can be extended to directly comparing different strains (WT or mutant) for spontaneous or drug-induced DSB formation. In all experiments we recommend embedding at least 10ˆ8 cells in each agarose plug to ensure successful library production. That being said, we have observed that certain conditions such as prolonged (3 h) treatment with 50 mM HU reproducibly caused low success rate of library production despite embedding > 10ˆ8 cells per plug. In those cases we have resorted to pooling more than two agarose plugs in a single DSB-labeling reaction or increasing the cell number per plug accordingly.",
    "Grow cells in either YEPD or SC medium at 30°C unless temperature-sensitive strains are used. Varying experimental conditions (e.g., with or without replication inhibitor treatment or cell cycle synchronization) can be applied. For each Break-seq sample approximately 100 mL of cell culture at OD660 of 0.6–0.8 is recommended, for it will yield approximately 4–5 agarose plugs each containing 10ˆ8 cells.\nIf using synchronized cell culture, log phase cells at OD660 of 0.3–0.4 are synchronized in G1 by the addition of alpha factor at 200 nM or 3 mM for bar1 or BAR1 strains, respectively, followed by incubation for approximately 1.5 generations, or until the unbudded cell population reaches at least 90%. The cell culture would reach an OD660 of 0.6–0.8 at this step. Replication inhibitors can be added at this step if desired. For instance, HU (an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase) is added at 200 mM.\nImmediately following the addition of replication inhibitor drugs cells are released from the G1 arrest into S phase by the addition of pronase at 0.02 mg/mL or 0.3 mg/mL for bar1 or BAR1 strains, respectively. Cells are harvested at discrete times during S phase.\nAdd NaN3 to the harvested cells to a final concentration of 0.1% (e.g., add 2 mL of 10% NaN3 to 200 mL cells). Optional: Remove 1 mL for flow cytometry analysis using SYTOX Green to monitor S phase progression. Transfer the cells to a Nalgene polypropylene bottle of the appropriate size and containing frozen 0.2 M EDTA (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1D, e.g., 40 mL of 0.2 M EDTA for 200 mL of culture).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/733-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of frozen EDTA solution for harvesting yeast culture\nAn autoclaved 500-mL Nalgene bottle (A) is used to prepare 40 mL frozen 0.2 M EDTA by storage in a -20°C freezer (B–D).",
    "Critical: The use of frozen 0.2 M EDTA ensures rapid cooling of the cells to arrest growth and minimize potential nucleolytic degradation.\nCentrifuge at 3000 rpm (1966 g) for 5 min at 4°C.\nWash the cell pellets twice by adding 5–10 mL of 50 mM EDTA then centrifuging as above, twice.\nResuspend the cells in 50 mM EDTA to a final concentration of 2×10ˆ9 cells/mL and warm the cell suspension in a 45°C water bath for 5 min.\nAdd an equal volume of 1% low-melt InCert (or SeaPlaque) agarose in 50 mM EDTA, also prewarmed to 45°C.\nCritical: Make sure that agarose remains warm during the plug making process to prevent hardening. Process samples one at a time and keep the remaining samples in water bath. While mixing agarose with cells by pipetting, take precaution not to generate air bubbles before pipetting into plug molds. Perform this step carefully but swiftly as the agarose will harden in epi tube within approximately 5 min.\nMix the suspension thoroughly by vortexing, then pipette 100-μL aliquots into each CHEF agarose plug mold (∼10ˆ8 cells/plug). Agarose plugs are allowed to harden at 22°C–26°C for 15 min or 4°C for 5 min.\nNote: This procedure will make 0.5% agarose, which is fairly fragile, but is crucial for in-gel enzymatic reactions such as end-repair.\nExtrude the agarose plugs from the mold into the wells of a six-well cell culture plate (  ≤  3 plugs per well).\nAdd 6 mL of freshly prepared Spheroplasting Solution to each well. Incubate at 37°C for 4 h with constant but gentle shaking (abbreviated as “shaking” below).\nAspirate the Spheroplasting Solution.\nAdd 6 mL of LDS Solution. Incubate at 37°C with shaking for 15 min.",
    "Aspirate the LDS Solution, then add 6 mL of fresh LDS Solution and incubate with shaking at 37°C for ∼ 16 h.\nNext day, wash the agarose plugs twice by incubating with 6 mL of 0.2 X NDS with shaking at 22°C–26°C for 30 min each time.\nWash the agarose plugs thrice by incubating with 6 mL of TE pH 8.0 with shaking at 22°C–26°C for 30 min each time.\nAgarose plugs can be stored at 4°C in the six-well plate while submerged in TE pH 8.0 for up to 6 months. To prevent evaporation the plate is wrapped in plastic. During long term storage change the buffer TE pH 8.0 every month.\nNote: We have constructed Break-Seq libraries with success from samples stored for up to a year. Results were consistent with technical and biological replicates prepared a year prior.\nCell culture and agarose plug preparation for mammalian cells\nNote: To date, we have published DSB mapping in human lymphoblastoid cells with and without replication stress induced by aphidicolin (a DNA polymerase inhibitor) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Chakraborty et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Below we describe this approach in details as an example. In addition, we have successfully mapped spontaneous DSBs (no drug treatment) in breast epithelial cell lines (MCF-7 and MCF-10A) as well as 3D organoid cultures of primary cells derived from patients with aggressive prostate cancer (W.F. and N. Wagaman, unpublished data). Therefore, we believe Break-Seq is widely compatible with different cell types as well as treatment conditions. Regardless the cell type we aim to produce at least 10ˆ6 cells per agarose plug. Adjust the starting cell numbers erring for up to 20% loss during processing.",
    "Grow the lymphoblastoid cells to exponential phase at a concentration of 5×10ˆ5 cells/mL. For adherent cells grow to up to 80% confluence. After the aphidicolin incubation step (see below) the cell concentration would be ∼10ˆ6 cells/mL. We aim for 10ˆ6 cells per agarose plug. Therefore, for each sample we require at least 5 mL of cell culture, which will produce 2 agarose plugs erring for loss during washes.\nRemove 1 mL of cells for flow cytometry analysis.\nNote: This step is similar to the one described above with yeast cells except that mammalian cells are stained with propidium iodide.\nAliquot the remaining cells. To experimental samples add aphidicolin to a final concentration of 0.2–0.6 μM. To a mock control sample add equal volume of DMSO, the solvent for aphidicolin stock solution.\nHarvest cells after 24 h incubation by centrifugation at 800 rpm (140 g) for 8 min at 22°C–26°C . Remove 1 mL before centrifugation for flow cytometry analysis.\nWash each cell pellet from 5 mL of cell culture with 2 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS buffer. Scale up if more cells are used. Spin down at 800 rpm (140 g) for 8 min at 22°C–26°C .\nResuspend the cells in 500 μL ice-cold 1× PBS and transfer cell suspension to an epi tube.\nSpin down at 2000 rpm (874 g) in a table-top microcentrifuge at 4°C.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of ice-cold 1× PBS to a final concentration of ∼3×10ˆ7 cells/mL.\nMake 1% low melting agarose in 1× PBS on hot plate. Equilibrate the solution in a 43°C water bath. Equilibrate the cells at 43°C as well for 5 min.\nAdd equal volume of 1% agarose to cells, mix and cast in a CHEF agarose plug mold. Cool the agarose plugs on ice for 10–15 min.",
    "Note: Agarose plugs containing mammalian cells are translucent and are slicker and more fragile than those containing yeast cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Plugs with yeast cells will become translucent after cell lysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/733-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Humidity chamber(s) used for processing agarose plugs during labeling reactions and subsequent washing\n(A–F) The figure shows a 3D printed design (A–E) and a jerry-rigged design if a 3D printer is not available (F). The components of the 3D printed humidity chamber include: a base which holds the buffer (A), a porous tray with a handle where the agarose plug (3D printed to life size 0.5 cm × 1 cm × 0.1 cm in green color) is placed, which fits into the base (B), a cap for the base and tray for maintaining humidity (C). (D) A multi-chamber design which contains three bases fitted with three individual trays and caps and connected to a pump. (E) A peristaltic pump which circulates solution through the multi-chambers.

(F) A jerry-rigged humidity chamber using a 1-mL tip box as the base and the insert from a 1-mL tip box as the tray.\n(G) A real agarose plug placed in the center of the parafilm laid on the platform of the jerry-rigged humidity chamber, without (left) and with (right) 100 μL End-repair reaction buffer. Note that the buffer surrounds the agarose plug and stays “hovered” with surface tension.",
    "Critical: Make sure that agarose remains warm during the plug making process to prevent hardening. Process samples one at a time and keep the remaining samples in water bath. While mixing agarose with cells by pipetting, take precaution not to generate air bubbles before pipetting into plug molds (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nExtrude the plugs into 6 mL of lysis buffer in a 50 mL falcon tube. Incubate at 50°C for ∼ 16 h.\nChange the lysis buffer by removing plugs from the old solution and transferring them into a new falcon tube with fresh lysis buffer. Incubate at 50°C for ∼ 16 h again.\nNote: Handle with care as agarose plugs will become transparent and might fall out with buffer if poured.\nWash the agarose plugs by incubating in 6 mL of TE pH 8.0 at 22°C–26°C for 1 h.\nRepeat step 1.b.xiii (above) twice. Store agarose plugs in 6 mL of TE pH 8.0 at 4°C for ∼ 16 h. Change for fresh TE pH 8.0 every month during long term storage.\nDSB labeling and library construction\nTiming: 5 h for step 2\nTiming: 2 h for step 3\nTiming: 1 h for step 4\nTiming: 50 min for step 5\nTiming: 40 min for step 6\nTiming: 1 h for step 7\nTiming: 16–18 h for step 8\nTiming: 1 h for step 9\nTiming: ∼16 h for step 10\nIn-gel labeling of DSBs by end-repair",
    "Note: The 3D printed humidity chamber will be used in the subsequent steps for preparing/washing the agarose plugs as well as for end-repair incubation in step 2.g. While using it for preparing/washing plugs, the plugs rest directly on the mesh and are submerged in the buffer. While using it for end-repair labeling the agarose plugs are placed on a piece of 2-cm diameter parafilm and the water level is just below the mesh as shown (Video 1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/733-Mmc1.zip]). If not using the 3D printed device the agarose plugs can be washed in a six-well plate and the humidity chamber can be set up as described in Materials and Equipment, under “Alternatives”.\nMake 10× stock reaction buffer by adding the following reagents to 20 mL of AgD H2O:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_16.csv\nBring the volume to 50 mL with AgD H2O.\nTransfer agarose plugs to a new six-well plate, one plug per well or per humidity chamber.\nNote: If using the multi-chamber design substitute the washing steps below by connecting the multi-chamber base to the peristaltic pump and flow 50-mL of the respective buffer through the chambers. Adjust the pump speed to exhaust the 50-mL buffer in approximately 5 min.\nWash each plug twice with 5 mL TE 0.1 with rocking at 22°C–26°C for 15 min each.\nMake 1× reaction buffer from 10× stock reaction buffer. Wash each plug twice with 5 mL 1× reaction buffer with rocking at 22°C–26°C for 30 min each.\nDuring the last wash, prepare labeling reaction mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_17.csv",
    "Note: We estimate that the maximal volume of each agarose plug is 100 μL. Thus, each 100 μL labeling reaction is intended for a single agarose plug. Scale up accordingly with multiple agarose plugs. For recipe of dNTP mix containing Biotin-14-dATP, refer to the beginning of the protocol. All other reagents herein are provided by the End-It kit.\nSet up the labeling reaction by adding 100 μL of labeling mix to each plug in the humidity chamber. Add the reaction mixture dropwise on top of each plug and let it hover all over the plug. Close the lid on the humidity chamber.\nNote: Before adding the labeling reaction mix to the plugs, dab-dry the plugs with the corner of a Kimwipe to remove any residual buffer from the previous step.\nIncubate the humidity chamber containing agarose plugs in a 25°C incubator for at least 1.5 h.\nNote: Longer incubation time up to 2.5 h is preferred.\nWash twice with 5 mL TE 0.1 with rocking at 22°C–26°C for 15 min each.\nWash/Equilibrate twice with 200 μL 1× β-Agarase buffer on ice for 30 min each.\nNote: Set up ice bath in a large container such as a 20-liter sterilization pan. Place the lid of the six-well plate on ice as the tray to hold the plugs. Line the lid with parafilm and place plugs on the parafilm. The β-Agarase buffer would hover over the plug. Use a glass plate as a lid for protection.\nAgarose digestion and release of chromosomal DNA\nTransfer each plug to an epi tube.\nMelt the agarose by incubating in a 70°C water bath for 10 min and mix occasionally by flicking the tube.\nTransfer the epi tube to a 42°C water bath and incubate for 5 min.",
    "Add 3 μL β-Agarase to each plug and incubate at 42°C for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 13500 rpm (39803 g) for 30–60 sec to pellet the undigested agarose. Transfer the supernatant (containing DNA) to a new epi tube.\nCritical: It is important to ensure that all the agarose is digested/separated from the DNA before proceeding further as the leftover DNA tends to interfere with sonication.\nNote: (Optional) Add 100 μL β-Agarase buffer to the pelleted agarose, repeat steps 3.d–3.e to increase yield.\nFragmentation of chromosomal DNA by sonication (using Covaris M220)\nTransfer 100 μL of the β-Agarase-digested DNA sample from step 3.e above into a Covaris snap-cap tube (microtube AFA Fiber Pre-slit Snap-Cap 6×16 mm, Covaris #520045). Typically, there is excess volume of DNA sample from step 3.e, then transfer the excess volume into a second Covaris sanp-cap tube. Sonicate using the preloaded protocol from Covaris named “DNA_300_bp_130_μL_Snap_Cap_microtube”.\nTransfer sonicated DNA to a new epi tube.\nPool DNA from the same sample from multiple tubes in step 4.a. Transfer any remaining β-Agarase-digested DNA from step 3 to the same snap-cap tube above.\nRepeat sonication using the same preloaded protocol above.\nPool the sonicated DNA from the same sample into the epi tube above. Repeat for all samples.\nAnalyze 5 μL of DNA by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel to confirm the shearing of DNA to an average size of < 500 bp (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/733-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Lane 2, flow-through of the sample in lane 1 after AMPure purification.\nNote: Typically, we observe 400 bp average size. Please refer to the troubleshooting section for potential problems encountered with DNA sonication.\nUse Qiagen PCR cleanup kit to purify the DNA by following manufacturer’s instructions. Elute each DNA sample with 50 μL of Elution Buffer (EB) provided by the kit.\nNote: If the DNA quantity is much greater than 20 μg then multiple columns would be required. The maximum load we have tried is 15 μg per column without significant loss. The DNA can also be ethanol-precipitated instead of column purification. For ethanol precipitation add 10% volume of 3M Sodium Acetate (NaAc) pH 5.0 followed by two volumes of ice cold 100% ethanol to one volume of sonicated DNA. For 200 μL of sonicated DNA add 20 μL of NaAc and 400 μL of 100% ethanol. Incubate at −80°C for ∼ 16 h and centrifuge to collect DNA on the next day.",
    "Measure DNA concentration using double stranded DNA setting on a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Estimate potential loss rate during purification for future reference.\nPause Point: The samples can be stored for ∼ 16 h at 4°C at this point.\nEnd-repair of fragmented DNA\nMix the sonicated/sheared DNA with the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_18.csv\nMix well and incubate at in a 25°C incubator for 45 min.\nPurify through a Qiagen PCR purification column.

Elute DNA in 52 μL EB.\nMeasure DNA concentration using up to 2 μL of eluted DNA on a NanoDrop. Calculate the amount of INPUT DNA from the remaining 50 μL prior to streptavidin purification below.\nNote: We typically obtain 2.5 - 5 μg of INPUT DNA per sample. When the DNA amount falls below 1 μg it may result in too little bound DNA and prevent successful DNA library construction.\nCapturing labeled DNA by Streptavidin beads\nAdd 50 μL EB to each DNA sample above to make up the final volume of 100 μL.\nMix the M270 Dynabeads suspension (10 mg/mL) well by swirling the bottle. Pipette 50 μL of Dynabeads suspension per sample into an epi tube situated on a magnet holder and let it sit for 2 min at 22°C–26°C before removing the supernatant.\nCritical: Use a low-retention microcentrifuge tube to minimize sticking of magnetic Dynabeads to the plastic.",
    "Note: The binding capacity of the Dynabeads for dsDNA is ∼10 μg/mg beads. Assuming each agarose plug contains 5 μg of DNA with 10% biotinylated DNA (see below), one needs 5 μL of Dynabeads. Thus, using 50 μL of beads per agarose plug exceeds the capacity by approximately ten-fold.\nAdd 100 μL 1× B&W buffer, mix by pipetting 12 times.\nPlace the epi tube on magnet and let it sit for 2 min at 22°C–26°C before removing the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 7.c and 7.d twice.\nAdd 100 μL (twice the original volume, final concentration of Dynabeads 5 mg/mL) 2× B&W buffer, mix by pipetting 12 times.\nAdd equal volume (100 μL) of DNA, mix by pipetting 12 times.\nIncubate at 22°C–26°C on a rotator for 30 min.\nPlace the epi tube on magnet and let sit at 22°C–26°C for 2 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new epi tube and measure the concentration on a NanoDrop to calculate the amount of FLOWTHROUGH DNA.\nCalculate the amount of BOUND DNA and thus, biotinylated DNA, as follows:\nBOUND DNA = INPUT DNA (step 6.d) – FLOWTHROUGH DNA (step 7.j)\nTypically, we obtain 1–1.5 mg BOUND DNA, approximately 10% of INPUT DNA.\nWash the Dynabeads twice with 100 μL 1× B&W buffer.\nWash the Dynabeads twice with 100 μL EB.\nResuspend Dynabeads in ligation mix (see the next step).\nAdapter ligation to (streptavidin-)BOUND DNA\nMix the following reagents and add to the Dynabeads from the previous step.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_20.csv\nMix well and incubate at 22°C–26°C for ∼ 16 h on a rotator.\nNext day, wash twice with 200 μL 1× B&W buffer.\nWash twice with 200 μL EB.\nResuspend in 44 μL EB.\nPCR amplification of labeled DNA",
    "Take 22 μL of the above DNA/Dynabead mix for each PCR using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix.\nNote: As described above we typically obtain 1 – 1.5 μg of BOUND DNA on the Dynabeads. However, in certain conditions it could be as low as 200 ng. When the BOUND DNA is less than 500 ng, use the entire 44 μL of DNA/Dynabead mix for each PCR.\nPCR Reaction Mix (50 μL):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_21.csv\nPCR amplify the DNA using the following PCR conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_733_22.csv\nTransfer the PCR product into an epi tube, place the tube on the magnet and let sit for 2 min at 22°C–26°C . Analyze 4 μL of the supernatant by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Pipette the rest of the supernatant into a fresh epi tube.\nPause Point: The samples can be stored at 4°C for ∼ 16 h at this point.\nFree adapter removal by AMPure purification\nSwirl the AMPure bottle to resuspend the magnetic particles.\nUse 1.8 volumes of AMPure beads per 1 volume of DNA solution (81 μL for each 50 μL PCR reaction).

Do not put the mix on the magnet right away.\nPlace the epi tube on the magnet and let sit for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh epi tube to save as flow-through for later analysis.",
    "Ethanol-precipitate the flow-through as described above.\nResuspend the ethanol-precipitated DNA pellet in 10 μL of TE 0.1.\nWithout removing the tube from the magnet, add 200 μL of 70% ethanol onto the beads and incubate at 22°C–26°C for 30 sec. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: Slowly drip the 70% ethanol onto the magnetic beads to wash them sufficiently.\nRepeat step 10.i.\nLeave the epi tube cap open to air dry for 20 min.\nCritical: This duration has been empirically determined in our lab environment. We recommend setting a timer for 20 min and then check the sample every 5 min. Once the beads appear dry we also double check by sniffing to ensure complete removal of ethanol. In most cases, 20 min is sufficient to allow ethanol to dissipate completely. Occasionally, we had to lengthen the drying period to up to 25 min.\nElute DNA by adding 40 μL of AgD H2O or TE 0.1 and pipette mix 10 times and vortex for 10 sec.\nIncubate at 22°C–26°C for 10 min with frequent mixing by vortexing.\nNote: Lengthen the incubation to ∼16 h at 4°C to increase binding of free adaptors to the beads.\nPlace the epi tube on magnet and let sit for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new epi tube. This resulting Break-seq DNA library should be stored at −20°C.\nAnalyze 1 μL of the DNA library as well as all of (10 μL) the adapter flow-through from step 10.h by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Repeat steps 10.a–10.p if the free adaptors in the DNA library persist. Excessive free adaptors present in the final library might interfere with the sequencing reaction."
