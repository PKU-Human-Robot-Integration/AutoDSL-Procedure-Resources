    "This study was approved by the institutional review board as belonging to an \"exempt\" status category, and, as such, the program evaluation data collected from the students and teachers did not require consent. The ultrasound and electroencephalogram recordings outlined below were conducted on standardized patients (SPs) with full understanding that this was part of an educational outreach event.\n1. Equipment positioning and connections\nBroadcast laptop computer\n\t\nPosition the laptop computer (Figure 1A, thick red arrow). on a centrally located table serving as the broadcast studio central station. Plug the charger of the laptop into a surge protector so the laptop is fully charged for the entire outreach event.\nPlug the universal serial bus (USB) cable of a high-quality microphone condenser microphone into the USB port of the laptop or use a multiport USB extender if needed.\nVideo switcher for video input selection and picture-in-picture (PIP) capability\n\t\nPlug the power cable of the video switcher (Figure 1A, thick green arrow) into a surge protector and attach the other end of the power cable to the \"power\" plug on the video switcher.\nPlug the USB cable to the \"USB out\" port of the video switcher and plug the other end into the USB port of the broadcast laptop.\n\t\tNOTE: The USB out of the video switcher essentially acts as a webcam and should be recognized as such by web-based video platforms.\nPlug the video switcher-supplied ethernet cable into the ethernet port of the video switcher. Plug the other end of the cable into a USB3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and then plug the USB end of the adapter into another USB port of the broadcast laptop or use a multiport USB extender if needed.\nDownload the video switcher software on the dedicated broadcast laptop using the link supplied by the company.",
    "Tripods and overhead rig for video camera mounting\n\t\nPosition an overhead modular studio rig over the anatomical specimen station with a large table positioned underneath (Figure 1B). Attach and center an adjustable camera mount to the overhead rig (Figure 1B, red arrow) so that it is centrally located over the anatomical specimen station. Mount a high-quality video camera equipped with remote control onto the camera mount (Figure 1B, blue asterisk). Plug the camera power cable into the camera power port.\nStrategically position sturdy, adjustable tripods in the broadcast area (Figure 1A and Figure 1C,D, blue arrows). Position one main camera for wide-angle views at each station. Position any additional cameras for close-up views at the various stations (e.g., ultrasound station to show probe placement on the standardized patient [SP]).\nMount a high-quality video camera on each tripod (Figure 1A and Figure 1C,D, blue asterisks). Plug the compact power adapter into a nearby outlet and the other end into the charging port of the camera.Attach a lens hood to block stray light from ceiling lights.\n\t\tNOTE: Although most video cameras come with battery packs, it is wiser to use power cables so that the camera does not unexpectedly lose power during a broadcast. The remote control capability of the overhead camera allows for easy adjustment of the zoom feature without having to block the live video feed inset view by standing in front of the anatomical specimen station. The presenter or another staff member can adjust from a distance.\nPlug a mini HDMI to HDMI cable into the mini HDMI port on each camera. Plug one end of an extra-long HDMI cable (e.g., 15 ft long) into the mini HDMI cable. Position the HDMI cables to run toward the video switcher.",
    "Position the HDMI cables in the room to enable easy movement and tape them onto the floor to prevent tripping. Wrap the HDMI and power cables attached to the camera mounted on the overhead rig around the rig structure so that they are not in view of the main station camera and do not fall down during the broadcast.\nMultiport HDMI switcher\n\t\nConnect those video cameras selected to provide video feed for the small inset in PIP mode to a multiport HDMI switcher equipped with a remote control (Figure 1A, thin green arrow).\n\t\tNOTE: A multiport HDMI switcher will be necessary if the number of HDMI input devices exceeds the maximum of four HDMI ports available on the video switcher.\nConnect the output HDMI of the multiport HDMI switcher to one of the four main HDMI inputs on the video switcher.\nSecondary laptop computer for slide presentations and serving as the wireless interface to the EEG laptop\n\t\nConnect the secondary laptop computer (Figure 1A and Figure 1C, thin red arrow) to its power charger and plug this into the surge protector.\nConnect one end of an HDMI cable to the HDMI port on the laptop and the other end to one of the HDMI inputs on the video switcher.\nCharge up a wireless remote control and plug the USB receiver into one of the USB ports of the secondary laptop computer.\nPreload any slide presentations onto the desktop of the presentation laptop.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of customized \"welcome slides\" will personalize the virtual presentation.\nBroadcast monitors\n\t\nStrategically position laptop computers on a chair/stool near each station to be used as broadcast monitors (Figure 1A-C, yellow arrows). Plug the laptop charger into the surge protector.",
    "NOTE: These monitors are required so that the presenter can observe the broadcast just like any participant. This capability is especially important at the anatomical specimen station to be able to adjust the position of the specimens on the screen.\nActivate the wireless internet connectivity of the laptop so that it is ready to use.\nUltrasound scanning station setup\n\t\nPosition a clinical ultrasound laptop device and a laptop cart in a central region of the ultrasound dedicated station (Figure 1A, purple arrow).

This may take some time depending on the length of the virtual outreach session.\nAnatomical specimen-specific content\n\t\nHeart specimen station",
    "Use sheep, pig, and cow heart specimens to demonstrate differences in heart sizes and the relative size of the human heart (i.e., between sheep and pig hearts) (e.g., see Figure 1B). Demonstrate the pericardial sac in a sheep specimen and the surface anatomy of the heart using pig hearts.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Human cadaveric hearts can be used in these demonstrations if age-appropriate for the target audience (e.g., upper-level high school students).\nIdentify the major blood vessels entering and leaving the heart using a heart model (Figure 3A). Demonstrate the location of the coronary arteries and discuss how blockage can cause a heart attack.\nDemonstrate the internal anatomy features of the heart (Figure 2B). Point to the four chambers and valves and mention their one-way function mediated by changes in pressure not electrical activity (Figure 3A). Point out the intrinsic pacemaker cells in the heart walls using a heart model.\nMention the different thicknesses of the ventricular walls and talk about hypertrophy of the heart when it must work harder (e.g., during prolonged hypertension). Point out the interventricular wall and discuss babies being born with a hole in their heart (i.e., in the interatrial or interventricular septum).\nBrain specimen station\n\t\t\nUse a model to discuss the two main cell types that make up the nervous tissue in the brain (e.g., neurons and glia). Discuss the function of dendrites versus axons, how neurons connect with each other at a synapse and that this is an electrochemical process, how glia wrap around axons to form myelin, and that multiple sclerosis is a disease that leads to demyelination.",
    "Demonstrate the major portions of the human brain (i.e., cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem) and contrast with the spinal cord. Point out the major fissure and gyri and sulci landmarks that characterize the surface of the cerebral hemispheres, such as the longitudinal fissure that separates the two cerebral hemispheres (Figure 3B, red arrow) and the central sulcus that separates the primary motor cortex and sensory cortex (Figure 3B, yellow arrow). Discuss the localization of function in the various lobes and the somatotopic arrangement of the primary motor and sensory cortex. Discuss the shrinking of the gyri in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.\nDemonstrate the major structures in a midline section of the brain (e.g., corpus callosum, thalamus, hypothalamus) and in coronal sections of the brainstem and forebrain. Point out the pigmented appearance of the substantia nigra and its importance in Parkinson's disease. Identify parts of the ventricular system and relate this to a ventricular full cast model.\nUltrasound station content\n\t\nBasics of ultrasound\n\t\t\nExplain how ultrasound has a frequency higher than what humans can hear. Explain how the probes are the source of the sound and that the speed is determined by the medium it is traveling through. Explain that US devices assume that the speed of sound in the body is 1,540 m/s but that different structures in the body have different conduction speeds. Explain that an echo in ultrasound is produced when sound travels from one medium to another and encounters resistance.",
    "Orient the students to understand that the top of the ultrasound image is closest to the probe placed on the chest. Demonstrate B mode imaging of the heart in various planes of view (e.g., parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis) and point out the chambers and valves. Demonstrate color mode for imaging the flow of blood through the heart and explain that red means movement toward the probe and blue movement away from the probe.\nIn the parasternal long axis view of the heart (e.g., Figure 2E), identify the mitral valve, which regulates the flow of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle during diastole, and the aortic valve, which regulates the flow of blood from the left ventricle out to the aorta during systole. Show how the mitral valve alternates with the aortic valve and mention that the alternate closing of the valves produces the lub-dub of the heartbeat heard with a stethoscope.\nIn the short axis view of the heart, identify the circular appearance of the left ventricle and the semilunar shape of the right ventricle. Angle the probe to visualize the aortic valve with the inverted Mercedes Benz sign.\nComputerized tomography (CT) station content\n\t\nExplain how CT scanners send X-rays through the patient in a spiral fashion allowing for 3D reconstruction in any plane. Use a case to explain the appearance of bone and metal (i.e., white) versus fluid (gray) and air (black) on CT images.",
    "Select the multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) mode on the anatomy visualization table (i.e., click on the blue man icon | MPR) and choose each of the three major planes that will then appear in a panel on the left side. Double-tap the image to load it to the main screen and then double-tap again to reduce it. Demonstrate how the images scan through the body in different planes of view (e.g., coronal, sagittal, transverse).\nFor CT imaging of the heart, demonstrate the relative size of a normal-sized heart compared to the lungs (e.g., rule of thirds). Identify the four chambers of the heart, follow the aorta out of the left ventricle, and then identify the major branches of the aortic arch. Show an example of an enlarged heart with an implanted pacemaker (e.g., Figure 2G). Use this case to demonstrate an enlarged heart that occupies most of the left side of the thorax.\nShow an example of a patient who has undergone open heart surgery as evidenced by the presence of metal wires holding the sternum together. Select the saved icon to demonstrate the occluded right coronary artery and identify and follow the coronary artery bypass grafts (one on the right and two on the left) that arise from the aorta and travel to the heart (see Figure 3C).\nElectroencephalography station content\n\t\nShow the wireless headset on an SP (inset, Figure 3D, yellow asterisk). Point out the 14 different leads (7 on each side) that are positioned over specific lobes of the brain. Discuss how the electrical activity of neurons and glia in the various lobes travel through the bone to the surface electrodes on the skin.",
    "Turn the threshold up on the software to demonstrate that the entire brain is active. Reduce the threshold of the EEG waves in the wireless EEG software to demonstrate the localization of zones of high activity within specific lobes (e.g., frontal lobe and parietal lobe) (Figure 3D, left panel). Monitor the changes in activity in various lobes to demonstrate that there are general patterns of activity but that they are not repetitive each time.\nDiscuss how EEG activity consists of different waves with specific frequencies.Use the sliders on the brain visualization software window to isolate specific waveforms (e.g., alpha waves and beta waves). Have the SP chew to demonstrate movement artifacts of EEG recording or close their eyes to demonstrate the increase in alpha wave activity. Discuss the uses of EEG recording in a clinical setting (e.g., epilepsy or sleep studies)."
