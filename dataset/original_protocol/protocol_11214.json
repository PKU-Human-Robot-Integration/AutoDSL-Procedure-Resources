    "All methods described herein have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Ohio State University (P.I. Gina Sizemore; Protocol #2007A0120). All rodent survival surgery IACUC policies are followed, including use of sterile techniques, supplies, instruments, as well as fur removal and sterile preparation of the incision site.\n1. Intracranial injection of breast cancer cells\nNOTE: The method described herein utilized the DB7 murine mammary tumor cell line derived from a primary MMTV-PyMT tumor23. Previous studies have established intracranial injection of DB7 cells as a model of BCBM with histology that mimics that of the human disease12. Importantly, immune-competent FVB/N mice are used for this model as DB7 cells were derived from this mouse strain. As this is a breast cancer model, adult female mice are used for these studies.\nPrepare cells.\n\t\nIn a sterile hood, aspirate media from cell culture plates using standard techniques.\nWash cells with 1x DPBS and trypsinize using manufacturer’s protocol.\nAdd an appropriate volume of FBS-containing media to stop the trypsin reaction and determine the concentration of cells using a hemocytometer or preferred method.\nPellet cells at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate media, wash with 1x DPBS, re-spin at 300 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend cells in 1x DPBS to an appropriate concentration, approximately 50,000 cells per injectable volume of 2 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell number is dependent on the aggressiveness of the line and needs to be determined by the investigator. We routinely use 2 µL, but use of volumes <6 µL is reported15,16,17,18,19. Low volumes are crucial to maintain precision.\nPlace resuspended cells on ice until injected to maintain viability.\nPrepare mice for surgery.",
    "For mice with fur: remove fur from the cranium, either by depilatory cream/lotion or by shaving. Do this within 24-48 h prior to surgery as performing this step too close to surgery can interfere with skin quality and suture strength.\n\t\tNOTE: Female FVB/N mice weighing approximately 25 g were used due to the study of metastatic breast cancer, a predominantly female disease.\nAdminister analgesics as determined by the IACUC and attending veterinarian: a subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine SR-LAB (0.5-1 mg/kg dose, Buprenorphine stock: 0.5 mg/mL for a dosage of 0.0025-0.088 mL) at least 1 h prior to surgery to provide up to 72 h analgesia, which may be repeated 48-72 h after the first dose, if needed. Also administer NSAIDs (20% ibuprofen in drinking water e.g., 1 mg/5 mL) at least 24-48 h before surgery and continue for 2-7 days after surgery to provide a minimum 72 h post-operative analgesia.\n\t\tNOTE: At The Ohio State University, Buprenorphine SR-LAB is administered by the University Lab Animal Resources Veterinary staff as it is a controlled substance.\nPrepare stereotactic units for surgery.\n\t\nTurn on all anesthesia machines, digital Vernier scales, and digital injectors.\n\t\tNOTE: All surgical tools should be adequately cleaned and sterilized prior to surgery.\nUtilize anesthetic machines with an induction chamber attachment in a biological safety cabinet (Figure 1A).\nEnsure all tubes from anesthesia machines are connected to the stereotactic frames (Figure 1B, inset 1C) and clamps on the tubes are open for all units being used. Close any clamps on tubes going to stereotactic frames that will not be used for surgery.\nSet anesthesia machines to manufacturer recommended nose cone flow rate based on the mouse weight (e.g., 25 g animal weight: nose cone flow rate 34 mL/min).",
    "NOTE: The head holder included in this stereotactic set up is recommended only for adult mice. Ensure that the manufacturer recommendations included with the stereotactic set up are followed.\nEnsure that the appropriate anesthetic (e.g., isoflurane) prefilled in the syringe is attached to the anesthesia machine (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: Over-priming the syringe can cause too much anesthesia to be delivered to the mice during surgery and result in an anesthetic overdose.\nPrepare the drills by twisting the stage lock, inserting a drill bit adaptor and a 1 mm drill bit into each drill and lock the drill by manually tightening the bit-lock.\nAttach drills onto the stereotactic frames (Figure 1C).\nClean Hamilton syringes with 5 alternating washes of 1x DPBS, then 70% ethanol, then once again in 1x DPBS. Place aside until animal is prepped for injection.\nSet digital injector to deliver at a rate of 0.4 μL/min and a target of 2 μL. This rate and volume allow for slow introduction of tumor cells into the brain, which reduces pressure and associated damage.\nPlace mice on stereotactic frames.\n\t\nAnesthetize mice (e.g., isoflurane) using the aforementioned induction chamber.\nMaintain mice throughout the procedure at a deep anesthetic plane. The % anesthesia administered by the machine depends on a number of factors including: flow rate, degree of stimulation, and body temperature. Monitor the mice frequently throughout the procedure for depth of anesthesia by evaluating for rhythmic respirations (animal is not gasping); lack of palpebral reflex (fluttering of the eyelids when stimulated with a cotton tip applicator); and lack of toe pinch (withdrawal of limb upon the noxious stimulus of pinching the toes).\n\t\tNOTE: Different strains of mice will have a different response to anesthesia.",
    "After mice are at an appropriate, deep anesthetic plane, transfer the mice to the stereotactic unit. Use a heating pad while the mouse is on the stereotactic machine to maintain body temperature and an appropriate anesthetic plane.\n\t\tNOTE: To achieve low profile we use air-activated hand warmers placed within an inverted pipette tip box (mouse elevating box in Figure 1D).\nOpen the mouse’s mouth and place teeth in the trough of the mouth bar located on the nose piece on the stereotactic frame (Figure 2A). Slide the nose cone over the mouse’s nose/mouth (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\nPlace mice with their heads level to the mouth bar. Gently open the mouth with the blunt end of a cotton tip applicator and slide into place. Ensure the nose cone is fully over the mouse’s nose or anesthesia will not be delivered properly. The nose cone will not engage with the nose if the teeth are not seated within this groove (Inset Figure 2A).\nUsing a sterile cotton swab, place eye lubricant on each of the mouse’s eyes. Application of eye lubricant mitigates drying of the cornea and reduces the chance of corneal damage and postoperative complications related to corneal trauma.\nStabilize the mouse’s skull by depressing the left ear bar up against the medial canthus of the left ear, locking it in place using the screw on the stereotactic frame. Then slide the right ear bar against the medial canthus of the right ear and screw tight on the stereotactic frame (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the mouse’s head is level and straight when placing ear bars. If the head is crooked or angled, the injection will be in the incorrect place in the brain. The ear bars should be tightened ONLY until the skull is immobilized upon stimulation with moderate manual probing.",
    "Make a calvarial window.\n\t\nPrepare and clean the scalp with 3x alternating passes each of a betadine solution and 70% ethanol. Due to the close proximity of the surgical site to the eyes, use the betadine solution over the surgical scrub.\nUsing a sterile scalpel, make a 3 mm incision through the skin along the central median aspect of the cranium (following the sagittal suture line). Bleeding at the incision should be minimal. Should it occur, apply consistent, firm pressure at the site of bleeding with a sterile cotton tip applicator for >30 seconds.\nIdentify and orient the drill perpendicular to the bregma (Figure 2C), making sure to reset the digital Vernier scale to zero.\nMove the drill 2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture and 1 mm anterior to the coronal suture (Figure 2C). For reproducibility, ensure the location to the left or right of the sagittal suture line remains consistent for all animals.\nTurn the drill onto its highest speed. Ensure skin is moved away from drill to avoid tissue damage caused by the rotating bit and carefully initiate the drill onto the skull. Drill a hole roughly 0.5 mm deep through the calvaria, resulting in the calvarial window. Be careful not to lower the drill too far or it will drill into the brain. Dropping sterile saline at the drill site while the drill is in motion can offset any heat generated by the machine that may cause thermal damage to the surrounding tissue.\nOnce the calvarial window is made, carefully raise the drill and remove it from the stereotactic frame.\nClean the drill bits using 70% ethanol and set aside if being used again. If not, remove drill bits and submerge in 70% ethanol.\nInjecting cancer cells into the brain",
    "Attach the automatic injector unit to the stereotactic apparatus (Figure 1D).\nPull up >2 µL of cells thoroughly resuspended in 1x DPBS in a clean Hamilton syringe. Be sure to resuspend cells immediately prior to filling the syringe to reduce clump formation and ensure a homogenous cell slurry. It is ideal to pull up 6-8µL of cell volume to ensure there are no air pockets/bubbles.\nPlace the Hamilton syringe onto the injector apparatus, and prime the needle for injection by dispensing a small amount of volume onto a disposable sterile drape to ensure the injector is working properly. Wipe the syringe with 70% ethanol with a cotton tip applicator (Figure 1D, inset). This removes tumor cells from the outer barrel of the needle shaft reducing the risk of tumor cell seeding along the injection tract.\nAlign the needle tip to the center of the calvarial window, nearly touching the exposed cerebrum.\nReset the digital Vernier scale to zero.\nSlowly insert the needle to a depth of 3 mm into the brain and allow the needle to remain in the brain for at least 60 seconds before proceeding. This time frame allows the brain parenchyma to conform around the needle, which reduces back pressure and potential expulsion of tumor cells along the needle tract.\nSelect Run on the injector screen to begin the delivery of cells to the injection site. It will take approximately 5 min to inject this volume. The prolonged time for this step is to reduce secondary damage caused by injection force on the brain parenchyma.\nOnce the injection protocol is finished, allow the needle to rest in the brain for at least 3 min, again allowing the brain parenchyma to acclimate to the injection.",
    "After at least 3 min, raise the needle from the brain at a rate of 0.75 mm/min. Do this at an extremely slow and consistent manner to reduce back pressure and tumor tracking up the needle tract.\nOnce the needle has exited the brain, carefully remove the Hamilton syringe from injector and clean as described in step 1.2.8.\nApply warm bone wax to the calvarial window using a sterile cotton swab. The bone wax acts as a physical barrier to keep the tumor within the skull.\nClose the incision (e.g., 5-0 PDS dissolvable sutures in a simple interrupted pattern OR suture clips, whichever is most comfortable for the surgeon).\nStop the administration of anesthesia and remove the mouse from the apparatus by unlocking and sliding out the ear bars, sliding the nose cone off the mouse, and disengaging the teeth from the mouth bar.\nPlace the mouse in a clean cage that is on a warmer set to 37 °C for recovery. Monitor mice during recovery, which typically occurs 10-15 minutes after anesthesia has been discontinued.\nAfter the mouse is recovered, monitor for early removal criteria as determined by the host institution’s IACUC.\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging\nAdminister Gadolinium-based contrast agent (100 µL/20 g body weight mouse of 0.1 M MultiHance) to mice by standard intraperitoneal injection24 10-20 minutes prior to imaging. Then anesthetize using an induction chamber with an inhaled anesthetic (e.g., isoflurane) mixed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (i.e., supplied room air gas).",
    "Place mouse on a heated holder to maintain body temperature. Secure the head with ear prongs and a bite bar, and place holder in the 9.4 T magnet equipped with a mouse brain surface coil. Maintain anesthesia during imaging time, a study typically takes about 20 min per mouse. Monitor respiratory rate and heart rate (~70 bpm) throughout the procedure using a pneumatic pillow and small animal monitoring system.\nObtain a localizer image, and then image the mouse brain using a T2-weighted RARE sequence (TR = 3500-4228 ms, TE=12 ms, RARE Factor = 8, FOV=2.0 x 2.0 cm, matrix size = 256 x 256, 1 mm or 0.5 mm slice thickness, NA=2-4, 15-30 contiguous slices) and post Gadolinium-based contrast T1-weighted RARE sequence (TR = 1200 ms, TE=7.5 ms, RARE Factor = 4, FOV=2.0 x 2.0 cm, matrix size = 256 x 256, 1 mm or 0.5 mm slice thickness, NA=2-4, 15-30 contiguous slices).\nPost-imaging, place mouse in a cage on a warmer set to 37 °C for recovery.\n3. Volumetric tumor measurements\nObtaining total tumor volume\n\t\nOpen MRI DICOM data file in ImageJ, an image processing software available as a free download through the National Institutes of Health (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)25.\n\t\tNOTE: ImageJ allows viewing of DICOM files, which is required to utilize the embedded pixel dimensions for tumor volume calculations (see Image, Properties where “unit of length” can be set as desired (e.g., mm)).\nUse the Freehand Selections tool to draw an outline around the tumor. Perform these selections in a dark room to enhance visibility. Do not adjust brightness/contrast to maintain consistency between sessions.",
    "Under the Analyze tab, select Measure to obtain the area of the selected region. If unit of millimeters was chosen in step 3.1.1., area will be given in cubic millimeters. If desired, embed the Freehand Selection by selecting ctrl+D. Change the output color by going to Edit | Options | Color. Convert the image to an RGB image (Image | Type | RGB color) prior to saving as a .tif file.\nProceed with measuring all tumor-containing slices for an individual mouse and copy values into an appropriate data analysis software program (e.g., Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism).\nSum the areas from each slice to get total tumor volume. Be sure to correct the area based on slice thickness (area/thickness).\nComplete steps 3.1.1.-3.1.5. until all mice have a total tumor volume. Given the somewhat subjective nature of outlining the tumors, it is ideal if the same methodology is repeated multiple times and averaged to reduce technical error.\nTo set scale bars, open DICOM data file and go to Analyze | Tools | Scale Bar. Since the dimensions are already embedded in the DICOM file, just pick the desired length/width. Covert to an RGB image (Image | Type | RGB color) prior to saving as a .tif file.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
