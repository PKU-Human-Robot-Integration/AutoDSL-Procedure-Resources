    "This protocol describes the procedure to isolate A. thaliana trichomes at high yield, based on our previous publication (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]). This is achieved by extended incubation of A. thaliana seedlings in EDTA-containing buffer, in combination with mild agitation on a magnetic stirrer. The low-cost chelating agent EDTA is thought to weaken the trichome-leaf interaction by complexing calcium ions that are essential for the crosslinking of pectin in the middle lamella. At the same time, agitation creates the necessary mechanical stimulus to gently detach the trichomes from the leaf. Essential in this regard is the size ratio between stirring bar and beaker, to allow efficient mixing while avoiding crushing the seedlings. Although glass beads were used during trichome release in our original protocol (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]), in subsequent experiments we obtained similar yields without glass beads. We, therefore, describe here the procedure without the use of glass beads.\nAfter their release, trichomes are separated from the seedlings by two consecutive filtration steps. Several cycles of release and enrichment are carried out to achieve full trichome yield and prevent a potential loss of cytosolic trichome content, which might be caused by long agitation periods (>1 hr), as described elsewhere (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]). Since the trichomes remain intact and retain their cellular content during this procedure, trichome samples obtained by this protocol can be used for various types of downstream analyses.\nMaterials\nA. thaliana seeds [here: Col-0 ecotype, e.g., Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC) ID N1093]\nNote that the protocol is likely to work with many different A. thaliana ecotypes and also other plant species.\nSoMi 513 soil (HAWITA, Vechta, Germany, EB/19748)\n50 mM EDTA-PBS buffer (see recipe) prepared using:\n10× PBS buffer, pH 7.5 (see recipe)\n250 mM EDTA stock solution (see recipe)",

    "1. For the cultivation of A. thaliana plants, place a propagation box with sieve bottom (500 × 320 × 60 mm) in a large propagation tray (600 × 400 × 60 mm; Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001]) and fill the propagation box with sieve bottom with soil.\nWe have used SoMi 513 soil (HAWITA, Vechta, Germany). Other soil types suitable for propagation of A. thaliana are expected to work equally well.\nPress the soil firmly, as the A. thaliana seedlings will then be able to thrive.\n2. Spray the soil thoroughly with tap water. Also, fill the large propagation tray with water so that the soil gets completely soaked.\n3. Evenly distribute A. thaliana seeds on the soil surface (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001]). Adjust the number of seeds according to the desired plant age. For 42-day-old seedlings, we recommend about 200 seeds per propagation box.\nYou can use a small metal kitchen sieve (width: 75 mm) for an even distribution.\nAvoid sowing too densely, as otherwise the seedlings will be too close and will limit the growth of one another.\n4. Moisten the seeds by spraying them with tap water.\nSpray the water perpendicularly to the soil surface so that the seeds do not get scattered.\n5. After seeding, place a perforated metal plate (470 × 270 × 1 mm, perforation: ISO 7806-1983 Rv 0.5-1.09) on the soil surface (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001]).\n6. Moisten a cover for the propagation tray (provider, Hermann Meyer KG) from the inside and place it over the propagation box.\n7. Cultivate the A. thaliana seedlings under short-day conditions until they reach the desired age.",
    "We grow plants using a photoperiod of 10 hr day-1 at 20/22°C, 80%-90% relative humidity, and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 80-100 μmol m-2 s-1 for 49 days. Other growth regimes might be used, but may affect trichome size and density.\nThe age of the plants to be used can vary. In our original paper, seedlings were grown for 42 days. Using younger plants is also possible. However, consider that the size of the plants may affect trichome yield.\n8. When the seedlings are old enough and have grown through the holes in the perforated metal plate, harvest the aboveground part of the seedlings by cutting them with a razor blade (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001], “Harvest”). Capture the seedlings in a second propagation box with sieve bottom or any suitable sieve, for washing (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001], “Washing”).\nPlace the razor blade at a slight angle on the metal plate. Hold the seedlings with the other hand and cut the stems directly above the surface of the metal plate. This allows for a harvest without roots that is largely dirt-free.\n9. Remove soil-derived impurities by rinsing the seedlings in the sieve thoroughly with tap water for at least 30 s.\nThorough rinsing considerably enhances sample purity after trichome enrichment.\n10. Dry the seedlings thoroughly using paper towels.\nFirst, slightly shake the seedlings. Then, spread them out on a dry surface and carefully pat them dry with paper towels. Repeat the process 2-3 more times with dry paper towels.\nExcessive water will influence seedling mass and, thus, calculated trichome yield per harvested seedling fresh mass.\n11. Place a single triangular stirring bar into each of the required 500-ml beakers and prepare the seedling batches (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0001], “4: Batch preparation”).",
    "The recommended size of stirring bars for 500-ml beakers with an inner diameter of 85 mm is 80 mm.\nA propagation box of seedlings provides enough material to fill four 500-ml beakers.\nPlace a 500-ml beaker on a balance, tare the balance, and transfer your desired seedling fresh mass per batch (36 g max. for A. thaliana) to the beaker. Repeat the process for all beakers.\nIn case you want to store the seedlings overnight, cover the beaker with aluminum foil to protect the seedlings from drying. Store the seedlings at 4°C overnight.\nRelease of trichomes\n12. For each 500-ml beaker, freshly prepare 250 ml of 50 mM EDTA-PBS buffer using the EDTA and PBS stock solutions as described in Reagents and Solutions. Add the buffer to the beakers with the seedlings (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Buffer application”).\nIn case of a high fresh mass of seedlings (>30 g), it has proven advantageous to allow the seedlings to soak in the buffer for about 5 min before proceeding with trichome release.\n13. Optional: Cover each beaker with aluminum foil.\n14. Stir the seedlings in the beaker at room temperature for 30 min and 300 rpm using a magnetic stirrer (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Agitation”).\nMonitor closely, especially for the first 10 min, as stirring could stop depending on the amount of seedlings.\nEnrichment of released trichomes by filtration\n15. Separate trichomes from seedlings by filtration, using four layers of screen door mesh and a funnel. To do this, pour the buffer solution containing the trichomes through mesh and funnel, and collect it in a clean beaker (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Filtration”). Keep the residual plant mass in its original 500-ml beaker.\nAfter filtration, rinse the seedlings with some 1× PBS buffer to remove all detached trichomes.",
    "16. Pour the buffer-trichome suspension through a cell strainer to capture the trichomes (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Capture”). Collect the buffer solution in its original 500-ml beaker with the processed seedling mass.\nSlowly pour the solution through the cell strainer to prevent it from spilling over.\nRinse the beaker containing the buffer-trichome suspension with some 1× PBS buffer and swirl it gently, to recover all trichomes.\n17. Transfer the gathered trichomes from the cell strainer to a 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube using a small spatula (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Transfer”).\n18. Optional: Repeat steps 14–17 (we recommend two times) using agitation periods of 15 min each to enhance trichome recovery (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0002], “Reapplication”).\n19. After enrichment, use the trichomes immediately for purification (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-prot-0002]) or store temporarily for future use.\nThe enriched trichomes can be stored at 4°C in 1 ml PBS buffer for a few days. For long-term storage, trichomes can be frozen in liquid nitrogen either with or without PBS buffer and then stored at −80°C, or preserved by freeze-drying (note that liquid should be removed first, see below). We recommend freeze drying for all analyses that require tissue disruption, such as the biochemical quantification of monosaccharides, and for transcriptomics and proteomics approaches.\nOptionally, the fresh mass of the enriched trichomes can be measured before purification, to evaluate the trichome isolation process. For this purpose, remove excess liquid (as described below) and transfer the trichome bulk mass with a small spatula to a precision balance. We usually retrieve about 300 mg trichomes from 36 g of 42-day-old Col-0 wild type A. thaliana seedlings (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-tbl-0001]).",
    "Excess liquid should be removed for both weighing and freeze-drying, using a pipette. For this purpose, place a 10-200 µl pipette tip under the trichome bulk mass at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube and remove liquid by pipetting. During pipetting, the trichome bulk mass will clog the pipette tip and thus act as a filter preventing single trichomes from entering the tip, allowing you to retrieve the entire excess liquid.\nTable 1.\n                Yield After Trichome Isolation from Different Plant Speciesaa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-tbl1-note-0001_54]\ntable:\n﻿Organism,FMPlant [g],FMTrichome [mg],DMTrichome [mg],Rel.

Values for A. thaliana FM and DM represent approximate benchmarks that were met regularly in our hands. Values for plant species other than A. thaliana represent the outcome of a single experiment. Relative (Rel.) trichome amounts indicate trichome yield per harvested plant fresh mass. Data from Huebbers et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]).\n20. After isolation, monitor the successful release of trichomes by microscopy. To this end, use a leaf disc sampler to prepare leaf discs (5-10 mm diameter) of the processed plant material and check for remaining trichomes on the leaf surface.\nCommonly, the trichome release procedure ensures a near-complete removal of trichomes from the leaf surface. Due to the autofluorescence of A. thaliana trichomes, ultraviolet illumination can facilitate the validation procedure (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0003]).\nCheck the integrity of the enriched trichome sample by microscopy. To do this, apply 40 µl of trichome suspension (about 300 mg ml-1 trichomes in PBS buffer) to a microscopy slide and evaluate by bright-field microscopy whether most trichomes (>95%) are intact (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0003], “Before DGC”). For the transfer of trichome suspensions, use pipette tips cut at the 10-µl graduation.",
    "If an unusually high proportion of trichomes (>5%) displays damage, such as missing branches or ruptured stalks, see Troubleshooting.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/54de2a4c-aea0-4b75-92f9-1f19f98856df/cpz1541-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nUsing microscopy and visual inspection of samples to evaluate the quality of the various steps of the trichome isolation procedure.

    "After release and enrichment (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-prot-0001]), trichome samples may display impurities such as foliaceous debris and fine particles (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0003] and 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0003], “Before DGC”). Thus, we developed a procedure based on discontinuous sucrose DGC for the purification of enriched trichomes. While these impurities do not considerably influence the biochemical analysis of cell wall monosaccharides, we have encountered differences during transcript profiling and after LC-MS/MS between trichome samples before DGC and after DGC (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]), so users may want to consider this protocol depending on their downstream application.\nMaterials\n20%, 40%, and 80% (w/v) sucrose in water, or 15%, 30%, and 60% (m/v) Nycodenz® (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany, cat. no.: 18003) in water\nEnriched trichomes (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-prot-0001], step 19)\n1× PBS buffer (see recipe for 10×)\n15-ml reaction tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany)\n1-ml syringe (e.g., Injekt® Luer Solo; Braun, Melsungen, Germany, cat. no.: 916601V or similar)\nCannula (e.g., Sterican 21G × 2\t Braun, Melsungen, Germany, cat. no.: 4657527 or similar)\nMicropipettes and pipette tips\n1000-µl UltraPoint® graduated TipOne® pipette tips (Starlab, Hamburg, Germany, cat. no.: S1111-6001 or similar).\nNote that these tips were cut with scissors at the 250-µl graduation for proper trichome transfer.\nCentrifuge (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf) with swing-out rotor (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany)\n2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany)\nAnalytical balance M-Power (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Göttingen, Germany, cat. no.

Prepare one DGC tube per trichome sample and the necessary number of additional tubes for balancing the centrifuge.",
    "First, apply the lowest-density layer (0% sucrose) with a pipette. Then, use a syringe and a cannula to carefully layer the 20% sucrose solution below the 0% sucrose layer. To do this, pass the cannula through the 0% sucrose layer, place the tip of the cannula at the bottom of the tube, and apply the 20% sucrose solution. Follow the same procedure to place the 40% sucrose layer below the 20% sucrose layer and the 80% sucrose layer below the 40% sucrose layer.\nIn case Nycodenz is used as density gradient medium, layering of the gradient is carried out as described for sucrose.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8ed42ee7-e15a-46c1-a084-57a16462befd/cpz1541-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nPurification of trichomes by density gradient centrifugation (DGC). After release and enrichment, trichomes can be subjected to discontinuous DGC to reduce crude and fine impurities. For this purpose, a sucrose gradient is assembled using a syringe and a cannula as described in the main text. Percentages correspond to the concentration of sucrose (m/v) in the different layers of the discontinuous sucrose gradient. Note that Nycodenz® can be used as an alternative gradient medium. In this case, solutions of 15%, 30%, and 60% Nycodenz® resemble the densities of the various sucrose layers, as shown elsewhere (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]). After centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 × g in a swing-out rotor, trichomes are collected from the bottom of the 15-ml tube and washed, to remove remnants of the gradient medium. The outline follows the method described in Huebbers et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]).\n2.

Carefully place the trichomes in PBS buffer on top of the density gradient.",
    "To transfer the trichomes, use a pipette tip with the end cut off to widen it.\n4. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g, room temperature, using a swing-out rotor.\n5. Carefully remove the 0%, 20%, and 40% sucrose fractions and discard them.\nThe bulk of trichomes are found in the 80% sucrose fraction.\n6. Fill the whole 15-ml reaction tube with 1× PBS buffer, and mix its contents by inverting the tube.\n7. Centrifuge 3 min at 3000 × g, room temperature.\n8. Discard the supernatant and repeat steps 6 and 7.\n9. Discard supernatant and carefully remove excess liquid.\nUse a small pipette tip, to avoid taking up the trichomes.\n10. Transfer the purified trichomes to a 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nUsing a small spatula can be helpful here.\n11. Use the purified trichome samples for further downstream processes, or store temporarily.\nFor a few days, the purified trichomes can be stored at 4°C in 1 ml PBS buffer. For long-term storage, trichomes can either be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C, or preserved by freeze-drying. We recommend freeze drying for all analyses that require tissue disruption, such as biochemical quantification of monosaccharides and transcriptomics and proteomics approaches.\nOptionally, the fresh mass of the purified trichomes can be measured as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-prot-0001], step 19. As described elsewhere (Huebbers et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-bib-0005]), purification does not considerably impair trichome yield and, thus, the user should expect about 270 mg g-1 purified trichomes per harvested 42-day-old A. thaliana fresh mass.\nFor weighing and freeze drying, excess liquid should be removed, as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-prot-0001], step 19.\n12. Visually inspect the trichome sample. After a successful purification, the trichome sample should have no remnants of greenish coloration or crude debris (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.541#cpz1541-fig-0003], “After DGC”).",
