    "Day 0: PBMC IsolationNote: All steps in the present protocol should be completed in a sterile hood, using sterile technique, and all reagents should be sterile. Obtain human peripheral blood buffy coats or whole blood from healthy donors. The cell number data presented in Figure 1 below are based on the use of 50 ml buffy coat samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603220427_9994.jpgFigure 1. Cell numbers obtained for total PBMCs, CD14+ cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. Buffy coats from healthy donors (n = 12) were obtained from LifeSource. First total PBMCs were collected via centrifugation with a Ficoll-Paque PLUS gradient. The collected PBMCs were counted, and CD14+ cells sort purified. The CD14- cells were further separated into CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell populations via sorting. The data are presented as the number of obtained cells, with the average cell numbers presented above each indicated population.Resuspend the buffy coat cells 1:1 volumetrically in 1x DPBS. For example, add 25 ml of 1x DPBS to a 50 ml conical, and 25 ml of the buffy coat sample. The buffy coat-DPBS mixture should be evenly mixed via pipetting.In a separate 50 ml conical add 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque PLUS, and then overlay 35 ml of the above buffy coat-DPBS mixture.Centrifuge the layered tubes of buffy coat-DPBS mixture plus Ficoll-Paque PLUS at 400 x g for 30 min at room temperature with the break turned off on the centrifuge.Following the spin, collect the PBMC layer and place the PBMCs into a fresh 50 ml conical. See the following link for the manufacturer’s support protocol (https://cdn.gelifesciences.com/dmm3bwsv3/AssetStream.aspx?mediaformatid=10061&destinationid=10016&assetid=12637[href=https://cdn.gelifesciences.com/dmm3bwsv3/AssetStream.aspx?mediaformatid=10061&destinationid=10016&assetid=12637]).Centrifuge the 50 ml conical tubes containing the PBMCs at 300 x g for 10 min to pellet the PBMCs.",
    "Wash the PBMC pellet 3 times with 30 ml of 1x DPBS, and the PBMCs should be pelleted via centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min.Following the last wash, count the PBMCs using a hemocytometer.Day 0: CD14+ monocyte isolation and culture Place 500 x 106 of the PBMCs cells into a 15 ml conical tube to complete the CD14+ monocyte isolation via the use of human CD14 positive selection beads (Miltenyi, CD14 MicroBeads, human,  130-050-201  ) following the manufacturer protocol. Both the CD14+ cell and CD14- cell fractions should be saved, as the CD14+ cell fraction will be cultured in the presence of recombinant human cytokine to generate the B7-H4+ macrophages for the macrophage-T cell co-culture portion of the protocol. The CD14- cell fraction will be used to sort purify either the CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells required for the macrophage-T cell co-culture portion of the protocol.Culture the purified CD14+ cells at 5 x 106 cells/well (2.5 x 106 cells/ml) in 6-well plates. The final volume present in each well is 2 ml of complete RPMI medium.At the initiation of culture, the desired final concentration of recombinant human cytokine(s) is added to the respective wells containing CD14+ cells. The present protocol uses recombinant human IL-10 plus IL-6 (at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml) to induce the expression of B7-H4 on the surface of the resultant macrophages collected on day 3 post culture. However, the recombinant cytokines used can be altered to allow for the expression of the desired surface molecules on the CD14+ cells post culture.Culture the CD14+ monocytes at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 3 days.",
    "Day 0: T cell isolation and cryopreservation From the CD14- cell population collected above, place these cells into either a human CD4+ T cell Automax sort (Miltenyi, CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit, human, catalog number:  130-096-533  ) or human CD8+ T cell Automax sort (Miltenyi, CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit, human, catalog number:  130-096-495  ). The manufacturer protocol should be followed.The purified CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells should be counted and cryopreserved at 10 x 106 cells/ml with 2 ml of cells per tube in cell freezing medium.To do so, pellet the T cells at 300 x g for 10 min, and resuspend the T cells in completed RPMI and adjust concentration at 20 x 106 cells/ml.Mix the T cells (20 x 106 cells/ml) 1:1 volumetrically with the freezing medium by slowly adding the freezing medium drop-wise to the T cells, and then rapidly aliquot cells into pre-labeled cryovial tubes, such that the final cell concentration of T cells per tube is 10 x 106 cells/ml.The T cells should be frozen overnight in the -80 °C freezer with a Mr. Frosty Freezing container (or a Styrofoam box works as well). The cells should be transferred to liquid nitrogen the following morning.Day 3: T cell preparation for macrophage-T cell co-culture Pull vial(s) of frozen T cells out of the liquid nitrogen, and rapidly thaw the cells in a 37 °C water bath.Transfer the thawed T cells (~2 ml of T cells in freezing medium) to a 15 ml conical (Corning CentriStar tube, orange cap) and add 10 ml of complete RPMI medium.Spin the cells down at 300 x g for 10 min.Wash the cells 3 times with 10 ml of 1x DPBS.",
    "Count the T cells collected from the cryovials, and the T cells will next be labeled with CFSE prior to setting up the macrophage-T cell co-cultures.CFSE labeling of T cells.Wash the T cells 3 times with 1x DPBS, and following the last wash resuspend the T cells at 20 x 106 cells/ml in 1x DPBS.Prepare an equal volume of 0.8 μM CFSE in 1x DPBS in separate tube.Quickly add the CFSE mixture to the tube containing the T cells. The final concentration of CFSE is then 0.4 μM within the tube containing the T cells to be stained.Cover the tube containing the T cells with foil, and incubate the T cells at room temperature for 8 min with gentle rocking.To quench the CFSE staining reaction, add 0.5x volume of sterile FCS and mix the tube containing the T cells by inverting, and incubate the tube at room temp with gentle rocking for an additional 5 min.Following the CFSE quenching step, spin tube containing the CFSE-labeled T cells at 300 x g for 10 min and wash the T cells 2 times with 15 ml 1x DPBS.Recount the T cells before using in desired application.Resuspend the T cells at 5 x 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium.The T cells are now ready to be added to the co-culture wells.Day 3: Macrophage preparation for co-culture Remove the 6-well plates containing the IL-10 and IL-6 conditioned CD14+ cells from the incubator, and gently swirl the plate to remove the non-adherent cells. Remove and discard the 2 ml of medium containing the non-adherent cells. The present protocol utilizes the live adherent cells, i.e., macrophages.To harvest the macrophages, add 1 ml of 1x DPBS containing 2 mM EDTA, and incubate the plates at 37 °C for 15 min.",
    "Following the above incubation, add 2 ml of complete RPMI medium to each well and collect the cells. Be sure to pipette mix each well thoroughly while limiting the amount of bubble formation, such that as many macrophages as possible can be collected.Pellet the collected macrophages via centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 min, wash the cells 3 times with complete RPMI medium, and count the macrophages.Resuspend the macrophages at 1 x 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium.The IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophages are ready to be added to the co-culture wells.Day 3: Set up of the co-culture wells For the IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophage and CFSE-labeled T cell co-cultures, the cells are cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates.Prior to the addition of the macrophages and T cells, coat the flat-bottomed 96-well plate with anti-CD3 (0.5 μg/ml, 100 μl/well, coating wells for 2 h at 37 °C, wells washed 3 times with 1x DPBS).Following the coating of the culture plate wells with anti-CD3, wash the wells 3 times with 200 μl/well of 1x DPBS.After washing the culture plate wells and removing the 1x DPBS wash volume via aspiration, add 100 μl/well (equaling 1 x 105 cells/well) of the IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophage macrophages from above.Add 50 μl/well (equaling 2.5 x 105 cells/well) of the CFSE-labeled T cells from above.Add the appropriate amount of species and isotype Control antibody or anti-B7-H4 contained within 50 μl of complete RPMI. For example, if final concentration of Control Ab or anti-B7-H4 is 10 μg/ml within the well, Control Ab or anti-B7-H4 should be diluted to 40 μg/ml in completed RPMI, such 50 μl of the working stock of Control Ab or anti-B7-H4 can be added to each respective well.",
    "Incubate the IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophage and CFSE-labeled T cell co-cultures at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 3 days.Day 6: Analysis Remove the co-culture plates from the incubator, and gently swirl the plate to remove the non-adherent cells. Collect the non-adherent cells via pipette mixing the wells, transfer the cells into a clean FACS tube.The non-adherent cells will be analyzed via flow cytometric staining for Live/CD4+ T cells and Live/CD8+ T cells to assess the level of T cell proliferation as determined by CFSE dilution.Spin the cells down at 300 x g for 10 min, and collect the supernatant into clean microfuge tubes. The supernatants will can be used fresh or frozen at -80 °C, and the level of secreted IFN-γ measured via either Luminex or ELISA.Wash the pelleted cells 3 times with 10 ml of 1x DPBS.Following the last wash, incubated the cells with 100 μl LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (1:1,000 in 1x DPBS) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark.Wash the cells 3 times with 1x DPBS + 5% FCS.Following the last wash, incubated the cells with 100 μl of Fc Receptor Binding Inhibitor Polyclonal Antibody (1:100 dilution in 1x DPBS + 5% FCS) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark.Wash the cells 3 times in 1x DPBS + 5% FCS.Following the last wash, incubated the cells with 100 μl of either anti-CD4 APC or anti-CD8 APC (1:100 dilution in 1x DPBS + 5% FCS), respectively, for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark.Wash the cells 3 times with 1x DPBS, and resuspended in 300 μl of 1x DPBS + 5% FCS, and analyzed on the flow cytometer."
