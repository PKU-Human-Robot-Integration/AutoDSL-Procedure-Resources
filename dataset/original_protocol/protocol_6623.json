    "The single cell trapping protocol can be divided into 4 parts: 3D microstructure design, 3D microstructures construction on chip, cell suspensions preparation, and oil film with surfactant for single cell trapping on chip. The final fraction is done by the digital microfluidic system. The detailed protocols for each part are as following:3D microstructure designWe use AutoCAD to design the microstructures. The microstructures include repetitive structure arrays (Figure 1). The yellow frame in Figure 1 shows the single structure, which consisted of four walls (rectangular frames), each one with a width of 7 μm, a length of 20 μm, and a small gap of 2.5 μm (Figure 1, right) between the ends of each wall, forming a semi-closed well between the walls. The designed microstructures were used to produce a mask for the following photolithography experiments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924082349_0070.pngFigure 1. The designed structures for single cell culture with Auto CADFor 3D microstructures fabrication on chipThe DMF chip is composed of three parts: the bottom plate, the top plate, and the conductive adhesive tape as spacer to connect the top plate and bottom plate. We used autoCAD to design the electrode patterns. Then chromium electrodes (Cr) were patterned on glass plates by and purchased from Changsha Shaoguang Chromium Edition Company, China. ITO top plates were purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Company, China. Figure 2 showed the process for the bottom and top plates fabrication and the assembling of bottom plate and top plate with spacer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924082332_3275.pngFigure 2. The process for the bottom (A-D) and top plate (E-F) fabrication. (G) The assembling of bottom plate and top plate with spacer to form a DMF chipThe detailed protocols are as following:Coat 10 μm SU-8 layer on the bottom plate as the dielectric layer.",
    "Plasma treatment for the designed chromium patterned bottom plate for 1 min (The plate is placed in the chamber of plasma cleaner equipment. First, the plate is treated with vacuum and then oxygen. Then the surface of the plate will be ionized. This process is called plasma treatment. The plasma treated plate will promote the bonding between SU-8 and plate. Plasma treatment is a very common used technique in the microfabrication field.).Pour SU-8 3010 (4 ml) on the bottom plate to cover about 1/3 area of the chip.Spin coat at 500 rpm, 5 s and sequentially 3,000 rpm, 30 s with spin coater (The procedure is as follows: excess SU-8 solution was poured to the glass substrate, which is rotated at high speed to spread the SU-8 solution by centrifugal force until the solution spins off the edges of the glass substrate and the desired thickness of the SU-8 film is achieved).Bake the chip for 3 min at 65 °C, 5 min at 95 °C on hot plate.Precise patterning of the dielectric layer with mask aligner via UV exposure for 18.5 s.Post-bake the chip at 65 °C for 3 min and 95 °C for 3 min on hot plate.Develop the chip with SU-8 developer for 1 min (The plate was immersed in the SU-8 developer solution. The transparent parts on the mask after UV exposure will help UV light irradiate the plate directly and strengthen the bonding between SU-8 and the plate. After developing, the pattern of the transparent parts on the mask will be printed as SU-8 film on the plate, while the pattern of the opaque parts on the mask will not be printed and washed off.).Coat 60 μm thickness SU-8 on the chip as fences to prevent droplets from drifting.",

The SEM image result for the designed 3D microstructuresChip assemblyThe DMF chip consists of the bottom plate, a spacer (made of adhesive tapes) to connect the two plates, and a top plate, as shown in the insert real image of Figure 4. The bottom plate is a main part of the DMF chip. A series of chromium electrodes are designed and fabricated on a glass plate, which is used for droplet operation by charging the electrodes or not. We also call it as bottom plate. A 1.5 mm diameter hole is drilled on the top plate by laser cutting machine for sample loading (the inserted image in Figure 4). The scheme of the chip pattern is shown in Figure 4, including sample loading position, the electrodes with microstructures for cell culture and other electrodes aid for the sample moving to the cell culture spots. All the cell culture spots in Figure 4 contain the semi closed well system illustrated by the Figure 3 SEM image. The grey droplet in Figure 4 illustrates the travel of a drug or cell culture suspension from the pipette tip to one of the cell culture compartments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924082251_0685.pngFigure 4.

The electronic control system was used to control the charge of the DMF chip. Each electrode is connected to a contact electrode pad patterned at the edge of the DMF chip through chromium lines patterned on chip, and further connected to the control electronics panel by jumper wires connector. A power supply is connected to the contro electronics. Physical relays on the control board are used as the switches to turn on or turn off the charging of each electrode. The commands are sent from a computer software via Bluetooth to the control electronics). All the operations were carried out in clean bench.Place the chip in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for a long-time culture (24 h).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924082234_9406.pngFigure 5.

    "Figure 6 is an example image of a compartment of the \"cell culture spots\" in Figure 4. Each circle is a cell in this image. The restriction of the 3D microstructures beneath each droplet would force the droplet to form a curved interface due to the interfacial tension, which promotes the single cell trapping. The cells sit in the semi closed well, as shown in Figure 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200924/20200924082217_5839.pngFigure 6.
