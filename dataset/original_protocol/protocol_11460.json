    "1. Preparation\nPrepare MCF10A culture medium: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1) with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL epithelial growth factor, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and 10 µg/mL insulin.\nPrepare serum-free medium: DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 20 ng/mL epithelial growth factor, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and 10 µg/mL insulin.\nUse the following siRNA sequence:\n\tsiControl:\n\tForward: 5'-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3'\n\tReverse: 5'-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGdTdT-3'\n\tsiTIP60:\n\tForward: 5'-UGAUCGAGUUCAGCUAUGAdTdT-3'\n\tReverse: 5'-UCAUAGCUGAACUCGAUCAdTdT-3'\nUse 10-cm cell culture dishes and 24-well plates.\n2. Transient Depletion of TIP60 Using siRNA\nOn day 1, aliquot 15 µL of transfection reagent (e.g., Lipofectamine RNAiMAX) and 2 mL of reduced serum medium (e.g., Opti-MEM) and mix them with 10 µL of each siRNA (10 µM stock), respectively.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for 20 min.\nSeed 1 x 106 MCF10A cells together with 3 mL of culture medium in a 10 cm dish. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nAdd the siRNA mixture drop by drop to the 10 cm dish.\nShake the dish to ensure that the cells are equally distributed before putting it into the 37 °C incubator.\nAfter 6 h of incubation, replace the siRNA-containing medium with 8 mL of fresh culture medium.\nOn day 2, prepare another batch of siRNA mixtures and incubate them at room temperature for 20 min.\nAspirate out 8 mL of the culture medium added on day 1 and replace it with 3 mL of fresh culture medium.\nAdd the second batch of siRNA mixture to the dishes drop by drop. Shake the dishes to ensure that the reagents are fully mixed before putting them into the incubator.\nAfter 6 h, replace the siRNA-containing medium with 8 mL of fresh culture medium.\n3. Seed Cells for the Wound-healing Assay",
    "On day 3, discard the medium and wash the cells once with 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. Discard the PBS buffer.\nTrypsinize the siControl and siTIP60-treated cells by adding 1 mL of 1x trypsin-EDTA buffer to the plate. Put it back in the incubator for 20 min.\nAdd 4 mL of complete culture medium to each plate, resuspend the cells by pipetting, and transfer them to a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells with 5 mL of serum-free medium and count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nPrepare a cell suspension of 6 x 105 cells/mL for both the siControl and siTIP60; ensure that the cells are well-mixed. Add 500 µL of the cell suspension to one well of a 24-well plate to ensure 100% confluency. Seed 5 to 6 wells each for siControl and siTIP60.\nGently shake the plate back and forth and then side-to-side to ensure even distribution. Avoid a circular motion. Leave the plate in the incubator for 24 h.\nHarvest the remaining cells to check the knockdown efficiency of TIP60. To do so, centrifuge the remaining cell suspension at 200 g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nIsolate RNA using a commercial reagent, following the manufacturer's protocol, and proceed to real-time quantitative PCR to evaluate the knockdown efficiency.\n4. Create the Wound\nCheck under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that the cells are fully attached. Observe the cells under the microscope (4X, 10X, and 20X magnification) to ensure that the cells are fully attached that a confluent monolayer of cells has formed.",
    "NOTE: siControl cells usually attach better than siTIP60 cells. This is expected because the depletion of TIP60 makes the cells more mesenchymal-like20. Here, a normal benchtop white-light phase contrast microscope is used.\nTo generate the wound, gently scratch a straight line across the center of the well with a 200 µL pipette tip; the length of the wound generated is same as the diameter of the well. Repeat this step for all remaining wells. Use a new pipette tip for each well.\nGently wash each well 5 times using serum-free medium to remove the detached cells.\nAdd 1 mL of serum-free medium to each well and proceed to live-cell imaging.\n5. Setup of Live-cell Imaging\nTurn on the microscope and the temperature control at least 1 h before setting up live-cell imaging to ensure that the temperature in the chamber reaches 37 °C.\nTurn on the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas supply before starting the live-cell imaging. Set the CO2 concentration to 5%.\nPlace the 24-well plate on the stage of the microscope and select the objective lens with 10X magnification for imaging. Direct the emitted light to the eyepieces instead of the camera and adjust the focus to locate the wound and the cells around it.\n\tNOTE: In this case, white light with phase contrast was used.\nUse a live-cell observer system to mark the position of the wound in each well.\n\tNOTE: The automated stage of the live-cell imaging system allows for image acquisition at multiple positions. Images are taken on every marked position once every interval.\nSet up the time condition: 1 h interval and 72 h duration; according to this setting, the system will take pictures at each marked position every hour for 72 h. Set up any desired time interval and period for monitoring.",
    "NOTE: Here, a duration of 72 h is best because these cells start dying after 72 h in serum-free medium.\n6. Tracking Single-cell Movement\nExport the data after 72 h. Export the data both as images in JPEG format and as videos in AVI format.\n\tNOTE: This is important because ImageJ software can only recognize videos in AVI format. The different cell migration speeds between siTIP60 and siControl cells can be clearly observed in the video.\nOpen the AVI video in the ImageJ software.\nOpen the MTrackJ plugin (the plugin must be downloaded and installed separately): Plugins > MtrackJ.\nAdd a track for single cells chosen from the video by clicking the \"Add\" tab in the MtrackJ toolbar. Choose a cell at the tip of the invasive front and a cell that can migrate on its own (single-cell migration). Follow the movement of the chosen cells on the video and trace them using MtrackJ.\nMeasure the distance of movement by clicking the \"measure\" tab on the toolbar.\n\tNOTE: Here, almost no cells in the siControl moved as single cells, making it difficult to measure single-cell movement, whereas many of the siTIP60 cells moved as single cells. However, the movement of cells located at the invasive front can still be traced and calculated in both siControl and siTIP60 cells.\nSave the video with the tracks in AVI format.\n7. Quantification of Cell Migration Ability\nFor quantification, select images at 0 h and images at \"n\" h, where \"n\" refers to the timepoint when either the siTIP60 or siControl cells have completely closed the wound.\n\tNOTE: Here, 48 h was chosen, as the wounds in siTIP60 cells were almost completely closed.",
    "Quantify the percent migration using ImageJ using the following formula: (area of wound at 0 h - area of wound at \"n\" h) / area of wound at 0 h x 100.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
