    "Expression and purification of recombinant Ran in Escherichia coli Recombinant Ran and its mutant RanP180L were separately cloned into a pET-15b expression vector, incorporating an N-terminal 6x his-tag fusion and a thrombin digestion site. The vector map including the inserted gene is shown in Figure S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20201226/3886 Supplementary Figure S1 S3.docx]. The following purification protocol for Ran and RanP180L is modified from a previous report (Bibak et al., 2004). For the purification of Ras and RCC1, please refer to these studies (Pu and Dasso, 1997; Burd et al., 2014).Transform the vector encoding 6x his-Ran (or 6x his-RanP180L or the 6x his-tagged small GTPase of interest) into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Amplify the bacteria in liquid broth medium in 2.5 L culture flask. Induce protein expression by adding 200 μl 1 M IPTG (Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside), and shake the flask at 37 °C at 220 rpm for 3 h.Place the flask on ice before harvesting the cells. Transfer the cells into a 1 L centrifuge bottle. Harvest bacteria by centrifuging at 4,700 × g at 4 °C for 15 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 30 ml of pre-chilled lysis buffer. Transfer the resuspended cells into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.Sonicate the cells in an ice-water bath for 10 min (4 s on/6 s off at 50% amplitude). Centrifuge at 39,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman refrigerated centrifuge for 30 min.Fill a chromatography column with 3 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA resin. Equilibrate the column with 10 ml of wash buffer. Repeat the equilibration three times. Incubate the clarified lysate with the resin in the chromatography column at 4 °C with rotation for 15 min.Wash the resin with 10 ml of wash buffer 7-10 times.Elute the protein with 7 ml elution buffer. Repeat three times.",
    "Concentrate the eluate at 3,200 × g at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge using a centrifugal filter. Transfer the concentrated eluate into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 21,000 × g for 5 min. Discard the pellet.Load the supernatant (1 ml) onto a size exclusion chromatography column (Superdex 200 Increase) to exchange the buffer to stock buffer. Collect the peak fractions (usually from 15.5 ml to 17.5 ml) at a volume of 0.5 ml/tube. Run an SDS-PAGE gel with 5 μl of the peak fraction sample mixed with 2 μl of loading buffer to assess purity of the protein. An SDS-PAGE gel that shows the final pure proteins is shown in Figure S3[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20201226/3886 Supplementary Figure S1 S3.docx].Concentrate the protein by centrifugation in a centrifugal filter at 3,200 × g at 4 °C until the final protein concentration is 5 to 10 mg/ml when measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Aliquot 1 mg of protein per tube. Freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen and store the protein in a -80 °C freezer.Pilot experiment to test mant-GDP loading efficiency (optional)Mant-GDP loading efficiency in this assay can vary depending on the type of GTPase or the mutation. This step may be skipped if the GTPase is known to have high GDP binding preference.Thaw 1 mg of purified Ran. It does not matter if the protein is charged with GDP (or GTP) or not.Incubate 3 nmol of Ran, 5 μg of RCC1, and 3 nmol of mant-GDP in a total volume of 800 μl in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube for 20 min at RT (room temperature). The RanGEF RCC1 helps to accelerate nucleotide exchange and shorten the time requried to reach equilibrium.",
    "Add 20 μl of exchange buffer, exchange buffer plus 25 nmol GTP, and exchange buffer plus 25 nmol GDP, into three separate wells in a 96-well plate (i.e., three wells per buffer for a total of nine wells).Aliquot the incubated Ran mixture from step 2 into the nine wells prepared in step 3 (80 μl/well). Incubate the plate at RT for 30 min to reach equilibrium.Read the fluorescent signal using a fluorescence microplate reader at Ex/Em = 360 nm/440 nm.Analyze the data. To proceed, there must be a difference between the buffer and GTP sample, or between the buffer and GDP sample, preferably more than 20 times higher than the standard deviation.Note: A low difference relative to standard deviation indicates that the protein has relatively low affinity for GDP. In this case, mant-GTP instead of mant-GDP should be used to test the loading efficiency before proceeding to the dissociation assay. One may also pre-charge the protein with mant-GDP according to a pervious protocol (Kanie et al., 2018), preferably with more than 50% of the protein being charged with mant-GDP, before proceeding to the following steps. Mant-GDP dissociation assayTo estimate the relative GTP/GDP binding affinities or the ‘GTP preference’, we devised the following mant-GDP dissociation assay, whereby wild-type Ran (RanWT) or RanP180L were first charged with mant-GDP, then the bound-mant-GDP was dissociated by adding increasing concentrations of free GTP or GDP. Two competitor-dissociation response curves can be plotted, from which the IC50 values, termed IC50GDP and IC50GTP can be determined. BiasGTP, which is defined as IC50GDP divided by IC50GTP, is then calculated as a unified measure of the GTP preference for a small GTPase that describes how biased the GTPase is toward GTP.Thaw 1.0 mg of Ran, 0.1 mg of RCC1, 100 mM GTP, and 100 mM GDP on ice.",
    "Note: GTP should be checked for possible GDP contamination, especially after long-term storage. GTP-containing buffer should be kept on ice or stored at -80 °C. Purify using an anion exchange Q column if needed. GTP and GDP stocks may be prepared in exchange buffer at 100 mM concentrations. Dilute GDP or GTP to 1.25 mM using the exchange buffer. Make eight 2.5-fold serial dilutions of 1.25 mM GTP or GDP with the exchange buffer. The lowest concentration should be ~ 0.8 μM.Note: When generating BiasGTP for only one protein, the experiment should be repeated several times with different serial dilutions (not prepared at the same time), so that the reported BiasGTP value does not reflect dilution errors. At least 60 μl of solution (for three repeats) for each GDP or GTP concentration is required. When comparing a few proteins, a serial dilution stock should be prepared and used for all proteins (even if there are dilution errors, the errors will affect all BiasGTP values to the same extent). We recommend preparing 1 ml for each concentration for comparing five proteins. Mix 264 μg of Ran, 10 μg of RCC1, and 10 nmol of mant-GDP with mant-GDP exchange buffer to a total volume of 4 ml. Incubate for 20 min at RT.Notes: Mant-GTP should be used for GTP-preferring small GTPases. If mant-GDP or mant-GTP is chosen correctly, incubating an equal molar ratio of protein and mant would in theory result in at least 50% mant-labeled proteins. Our unpublished data showed that the ratio of GDP-, GTP- or mant-GDP/GTP-loaded proteins is not important, as long as the labeling efficiency is well above the level of noise (see Procedure B).",
    "A higher concentration of mant-GDP or mant-GTP does increase the labeling level and the observed signal; however, the background noise would be even greater (mostly due to pipetting errors), and thus may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio. Due to an unknown reason, desalting the sample to reduce background noise sometimes fails to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Hence we do not recommend an extra desalting step in this assay. The minimum volume of the protein mix for one protein is 3.84 ml (14 concentrations × 3 repeats, and 6 buffer samples, 80 µl each). Add 100 μl exchange buffer to all the peripheral unused wells of a 96-well plate (as indicated in Figure 1A) to avoid edge effects.Note: Edge wells tend to have slightly smaller readings. Using only the center wells can prevent these edge effects, especially when one wishes to increase the assay time. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3886/bioprotoc-11-02-3886-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Error bars represent standard deviations of triplicates. IC50 values are shown in Table 1. C. RanP180L dissociation profile. P180 is located at the C-terminal autoinhibitory tail of Ran.Add 20 μl of different concentrations of GTP or GDP or buffer to 48 wells in the middle (as indicated in Figure 1A). Each concentration is tested in triplicate. There are six buffer samples (Figure 1A, colored in pink).Note: The assay may be conducted with quadruplicate readings for better precision.",
    "Aliquot 80 μl/well of the protein mixture into the 48 wells to make a total volume of 100 μl (final concentrations: 2 μM Ran-nucleotide, 0.04 μM RCC1, and seven concentrations of GTP or GDP ranging from 250 μM to 1.0 μM).Shake the plate gently three times for 30 s in a fluorescence microplate reader. Incubate the plate at RT for 30 min.Read the fluorescent signal using the fluorescence microplate reader at Ex/Em = 360 nm/440 nm. Shake the plate and repeat the reading. Do this three to five times.
