    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNuclei purification\nTiming: 1 h\nDuring these steps, nuclei are extracted from mouse skeletal muscles. This protocol can be used with either fresh or frozen skeletal muscle. For freezing, remove all liquid (PBS or medium) and snap freeze the muscles in liquid nitrogen. Store the muscles in liquid nitrogen or a -150°C freezer. The day of the experiment, let the muscle thaw for 5 min on ice before adding ice-cold lysis buffer and proceeding with the nuclei purification.\nLysis of the tissue:\nDissect the muscles of interest and place them in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS+RNase inhibitor in a 2 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/885-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Nuclei extraction from adult skeletal muscle\n(A) Amount of dissected skeletal muscle used for nuclei isolation.\n(B) The muscles are chopped with a pair of scissors for 2 min on ice.\n(C) Indicative picture of the muscles after chopping. The size of the muscle pieces should be around 1–2 mm.\n(D) Muscle preparation before and after Douncer homogenization.\n(E) Nuclei pellet after filtration and first centrifugation. A colorless pellet of the size shown in the picture is required.\nCritical: The amount of skeletal muscle used depends on the conditions (wild type resting muscle, regeneration, atrophy, etc.). For wild type, resting conditions the range of muscle quantity is 150–400 mg, equivalent to 3-6 adult tibialis anterior (TA) hindlimb muscles. It is strongly recommended to test different quantities of tissue before the experiment and check if the number of the sorted nuclei is sufficient.",
    "Discard the PBS and add 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer. Chop the tissue with a pair of clean dissection scissors for 2 min in the same 2 mL tube, keeping the tube on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The resulting pieces of chopped muscle should be approximately 2–3 mm in diameter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer the chopped muscle into a 15 mL tube and add 4 mL of lysis buffer. Lyse for additional 3 min on ice with gentle shaking.\nAdd 9 mL of wash buffer and transfer the preparation into the 15 mL Douncer. Place the Douncer on ice and while on ice, lower and raise the pestle gently 10 times, avoiding bubble formation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: The reciprocating motion of the pestle should be carried out quite effortlessly, without the need to apply strength; otherwise, this is an indication of excess muscle that will jeopardize nuclei integrity.\nFiltration wash and staining:\nFilter the nuclei with a 70 μm cell strainer in a 50 mL conical tube. Before filtering, rinse the cell strainer with 1 mL of wash buffer without RNase inhibitor. Collect the flow through and re-filter using a 40 μm cell strainer in a clean 50 mL tube (pre-rinse the 40 μm cell strainer with 1 mL of wash buffer).\nTransfer the nuclei into a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 g, 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Critical: The purification is good when the pellet is visible and clear in color (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). If the pellet is less than 1/4 of what is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E, the number of nuclei recovered after FACS may be insufficient. In this case, increase the amount of tissue used initially. If the pellet is too large and not white in color, reduce the initial amount of muscle. Excessive amounts of muscle may compromise the efficiency of nuclei extraction and increase the quantity of debris.\nGently discard the supernatant with an automatic pipetboy up to the 2 mL level and remove the remaining liquid with a P1000 pipette manually. Do not discard by inverting the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of wash buffer + RNase inhibitor by gently pipetting 5 times and transfer it in a clean DNA LoBind 1.5 mL tube to wash off the ambient RNA. Centrifuge 5 min at 500 g, 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL of wash buffer + RNase inhibitor by gently pipetting 5 times and add DAPI to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.\nIncubate for 5 min in the dark on ice with gentle shaking.\nAdd 1 mL wash buffer + RNase inhibitor, gently pipette and centrifuge 5 min at 500 g, 4°C. Resuspend the pellet by gently pipetting in 300 μL of wash buffer + RNase inhibitor.\nFACS sorting of nuclei\nTiming: 30 min\nDuring these steps, nuclei are purified by FACS based on DAPI staining.\nFACS isolation of nuclei:\nFilter the nuclei in FACS tubes with a 35 μm nylon mesh-screen filter cap (rinse the filter with 50 μL of wash buffer + RNase inhibitor before and after filtering).\nMaintain a 1.5 mL collection tube at 4°C.",
    "FACS the nuclei based on the DAPI staining, with an 85 μm nozzle and a flow rate pressure of 45 psi. The nuclei should cluster separately from the debris (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C). FACS sorting gates should be set to keep the nuclei population and exclude debris. Note: Unstained, DAPI-negative control nuclei could be used once for gating, although the signal-to-noise ratio is particularly high.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/885-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nuclear purification by DAPI-based cytometry\n(A) Nucleus preparations stained with DAPI after Douncer homogenization. Arrows point to debris (DAPI negative, solid arrows) and nuclei-debris aggregates (dotted arrow). Scale bar 400 μm.\n(B) Nuclei preparations stained with DAPI after FACS. An almost complete elimination of debris is evident. Scale bar 400 μm.\n(C) Nuclei from hindlimb and forelimb muscles of adult mice are sorted by FACS based on DAPI signal (≈50% DAPI+). Nuclei preparations stained with DAPI after FACS. Green arrows point to elongated nuclei, a characteristic feature of myonuclei, whereas gray arrows point at more rounded nuclei, probably deriving from other cell types. Scale bar 200 μm.\nCollect a minimum of 10 000 nuclei. Optimally, collect approximately 200 000 nuclei in 10 min.\nOptional: At this stage, the nuclei preparation can be quality-controlled with brightfield or a fluorescent microscope to ensure that they are intact, of regular shape and that there is no residual debris (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). For brightfields microscope, mix 10 μl of nuclei with 10 μl of Trypan blue 0.4% and spread the nuclei on a glass slide, place a coverslip and visualize them. For fluorescent microscopy, directly spread the nuclei on a glass slide, place a coverslip and visualized them with a DAPI filter and in phase-contrast.\n10x GEM generation, library preparation, and sequencing\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The RNA of each nucleus can be sequenced individually using either the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹReagent Kits v3 or the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹReagent Kits v3.1. Nuclei are encapsulated into gel beads with individual barcodes using the Chromium Controller machine. Following encapsulation, cDNAs are manually generated and amplified and the library is prepared. The library is then sequenced and analyzed. These steps must be conducted by strictly following the manufacturer’s protocol depending on the kit used. We will only present a summary of the first steps for the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹReagent Kits v3.1 thereafter.\nEncapsulation of nuclei:\nDetermine the volume of nuclei to be loaded into the 10X Chromium Controller. For this, divide the number of targeted nuclei times 1.6, by the concentration of nuclei after FACS (calculated during the test experiments). For example, if you target 5000 nuclei and have a concentration of 250 nuclei/μL after the FACS, the volume of nuclei to load into the machine is 5000∗1.6/250 = 40 μL. As a general principle, the number of nuclei you load into the 10× Chromium Controller is twice the number you will target. For example, if you want to target 5000 nuclei, you should load 10 000. The maximum volume of sorted nuclei that can be loaded is 41.3 μL.",
    "Critical: If the concentration of nuclei is less than 200 nuclei/μl after the FACS, the preparation cannot be loaded directly into the 10X Genomics platform. In this case, FACS a minimum of 200 000 nuclei, centrifuge the nuclei at 500 g/10 min at 4°C, discard very gently the supernatant and resuspend the nuclei in a small volume of wash buffer + RNase inhibitor (for example 60 μl). Then precisely determine the concentration of nuclei with an automatic cell counter (like Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter from Thermo Fischer Scientific).\nThe rest of the protocol (GEM generation, RT, clean up, amplification, library construction and sequencing) must be carried out by strictly following the 10X Genomics protocol. In all conditions, the targeted number of sequencing reads per nucleus is 50 000.\nAnalysis:\nAfter sequencing, demultiplex the fastq files with the Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline into library-specific FASTQ files. Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell RNA-seq output to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis. Cell Ranger is freely provided from 10x Genomics.\nThe quantity of intronic reads is greater for the snRNA-seq compared to the scRNA-seq. It is therefore advisable to include these intronic reads in the analysis. For that, create a custom reference package including intronic and exonic reads, with cellranger mkgtf and cellranger mkref according to 10xGenomics instruction. Align the reads in the reference genome using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nOnce aligned, barcodes associated with these reads-cell identifiers and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), undergo filtering and correction. Reads associated with retained barcodes are quantified and used to build a transcript count table.",
    "It is advised to use SoupX software (Young and Behjati, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) to reduce the level of background of ambient RNA contamination. Use Seurat software (Stuart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to keep the nuclei with >200 and <2500 nFeature RNA and <5% mitochondrial genes.\nNote: The parameters of filtering can be adjusted depending on the data quality and conditions.\nVisualized, clustered and perform differential gene analysis using Seurat software."
