    "All methods presented here have been established under a research study, which was approved by the institutional review board of Stanford University. The \"off label\" use of ferumoxytol was performed under an investigator-initiated investigational new drug application (IND 111,154).\n1. 24 h Prior to PET/MRI Scan: Patient Safety Screening\nScreen the patient for potential magnetic field hazards using an MRI safety questionnaire. If the administration of intravenous MRI contrast agent is planned, check contraindications, such as history of allergies and kidney function, among others.\nInform the patient of purpose, procedure, risks and benefits prior to the scan.\nWeigh the patient for calculation of radiotracer and contrast agent dose.\nAsk the patient to fast for at least 4 hours before the scan.\n2. 1-2 h Before the PET/MRI Scan: Patient Preparation\nAsk the patient to remove all metallic objects and change into a gown. If there are any implanted metallic objects, make sure that they are safe for MRI scanning. Use a metal detector as needed. Do not perform the PET/MRI if there is a concern for patient safety.\nPlace an intravenous line in a peripheral superficial vein or access a port-catheter.\nDilute ferumoxytol (5 mg Fe/kg bodyweight) 1:4 in saline, and infuse slowly over at least 15 min according to FDA protocols10.\n\tNote: Ferumoxytol can be used \"off label\" as a contrast agent through an investigator-initiated IND, because it provides long lasting vascular and tissue enhancement for the duration of the entire scan. Alternatively, a cyclic gadolinium chelate can be administered directly before start of the PET/MRI scan. For patients with liver lesions, gadoxetate disodium may be chosen.\nCheck the patient's blood-glucose levels with a glucometer.If the patient's blood-glucose levels are above 200 mg/dL, consider re-scheduling the PET/MRI scan.",
    "45 min prior to the PET/MRI scan, administer 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) at a dose of 2 MBq/kg bodyweight in 1 mL of saline through the intravenous line.\n3. PET/MR Image Acquisition\nNote: For this protocol, we used a 3.0 Tesla GE Signa integrated PET/MRI system bundled with MP24_R03 scanner software.\nSave the protocol for the whole-body scan (Table 1) and local tumor scan (Table 2) on the scanner, so that these can be easily retrieved without losing much time to search sequences or adjust protocols.\nFor patients with lymphoma, prescribe a whole-body scan only, either extending from head to toe or extending from head to mid-thigh level, according to the clinical oncologist's request. For all other patients, prescribe a whole-body scan from head to toe followed by a separate local tumor scan.\nIf a tumor is already appropriately centered in one of the whole-body PET slabs, prescribe and run the dedicated MRI sequences during the whole-body scan in order to save time; e.g., an abdominal tumor can be scanned with the whole-body coil.\nTo enable easy retrieval and review of PET/MRI data for the Radiologist, save the \"diagnostic\" images under one accession number. Later (see step 4.3.5) save the source images under a second accession number in the PACS system.\nUse the same localizers throughout the scan and make sure the patient doesn't move for the duration of the scan. This enables co-registration of the acquired PET and MRI data later.\nPrescribe the necessary MRI sequences within each PET slab. The integrated PET/MRI system then allows for the simultaneous acquisition of PET data and MRI data.\nAsk the patient to void directly before entering the scanner room.\nWhole-Body PET/MRI Scan",
    "Position the patient on the PET/MRI table in a supine position. If the patient cannot lay supine, scan the head supine and the whole body in prone position. For very tall patients, acquire the lower legs in a second step. For patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma, make sure to cover the whole affected bone from joint to joint (e.g., whole femur from hip to knee joint).\nClose a breathing belt around the patient. Then position a head coil and 2-3 surface coils on the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and extremities of the patient.\nAcquire whole-body localizers in three planes; axial, coronal and sagittal (Table 1) using the generic localizer protocol. Select the number of stations according to patient height. Scanning direction can be either from head to feet or feet towards head.\nPrescribe the entire protocol before starting the whole-body scan. Streamline this process and use a pre-saved protocol so that children do not lose patience.\nPrescribe axial PET slabs first, using the maximum axial field of view (FOV, typically 25 cm) and 3 min data acquisition. Depending on patient size, 4-5 slabs will cover head to mid-thigh and 9-10 slabs will cover the whole body.\nIn the scanner software, enable two separate reconstructions for the PET data: one non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET and one MRI attenuation corrected (MAC) PET. Use a matrix size of 192 x 192. Use 28 subsets with 2 iterations. The PET/MRI software allows for attenuation correction accounting for patient, patient cradle and dedicated MRI coils using sequences described under 3.7.7 below.\nFill each PET slab with a low-resolution Liver Acquisition with Volume Acquisition (LAVA) sequencefor Attenuation Correction (MRAC) and a higher resolution LAVA sequence for anatomical co-registration of 18F-FDG-PET data. Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) can be added as deemed appropriate (Table 1).",
    "In the Task menu select the PET Task, click Add Task, click Add Postprocessing, choose MRAC Autobind (User) and then click Setup which will bring up an additional menu. Select all consecutive Water MRAC for the PET slabs and click Accept. This will enable the software to automatically merge the MRAC.\nApply similar steps to merge the DWI. In this case, choose the first PET slab and click on the DWI sequence. Then click Add Task and follow the same additional steps as in 3.7.8.\nAdd a dedicated T2-sequence for evaluation of the lungs and/or mediastinum (Table 1).\nLocal PET/MRI scan\nPlace an appropriate coil over the primary tumor. For extremity tumors, a flex coil may be used. For bone tumors, make sure to cover the adjacent joint (e.g., for an osteosarcoma of the distal femur metaphysis, include the distal femoral epiphysis and knee joint). For primary tumors of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, placement of coils for local tumor and whole body staging can be done at once (see step 3.7.2). The separate materials/equipment list provides an overview of PET-compatible MRI coils available on the scanner.\n4. Image Data Processing\nNote: To obtain the merged whole-body PET/MRI scan, the following four steps must be done: 1) reconstruct the PET image data, 2) merge the individual MRI data acquisitions to a single image volume, 3) co-register the PET to the MRI data, and 4) generate a PET whole-body maximum intensity projection (MIP). The scanner software greatly simplifies these steps.\nMerging of individual MRI data",
    "Select all individual MRI data sets of a specific sequence, e.g.,LAVA 1 through 9, and press the Autobind button. The software then constructs a merged MRI data set. Save the merged MRI data set. The software automatically names the data set and adds it to the series list.\nCo-registration of PET and MRI data\nTo co-register the merged MAC PET-data and merged LAVA-data, select each data set which needs to be co-registered and press the ImageQC button. The software then shows both the individual non-co-registered data sets and the co-registered data set in two planes in six separate windows.\nSelect the MRI data and window-level appropriately, since this cannot be adjusted once the co-registered scan is finalized and saved.\nSimilarly select the co-registered PET/MRI data set and window-level the PET data. It is also possible to adjust opacity, zoom and position of the co-registered data before saving.\nChoose the appropriate slice orientation for the co-registered data set, i.e., axial or coronal.\nLastly, save the adjusted co-registered PET/MRI data set:\n\t\t\nChoose Batch in the Film/Save menu. Select Loop and scroll all the way to the most cranial slice and click Set Start, then scroll down to the most caudal slice and click Set End.\nIn the description field, choose an appropriate filename. Use a consistent and easily recognizable file name for all studies, so that the radiologist and clinician can easily find a specific data set (e.g., PET-LAVA Whole-Body).\nClick Preview and let the scan scroll from head to toe while checking that the final result is acceptable in terms of fusion accuracy and window levels. Close the preview and then select OK to start rendering the PET/MRI scan. The rendering process can be followed by observing the image index track bar.",
    "Follow the same steps to co-register the MAC PET-data and the dedicated T2 MRI sequence for evaluation of the lungs. Since the PET-data FOV extends beyond the MRI, set the start and end of the scan to include only the co-registered part.\n\t\tNote: The local PET/MRI can be co-registered following the same steps.\nGenerate PET whole-body MIP overview\nTo generate a PET whole-body maximum intensity projection (MIP), select the MAC PET and any MRI data set and press the ImageQC button.\nDouble-click on the window with PET data only, and hover the cursor in the upper left corner to select View Type, and then select VR. This will create a 3D reconstruction of the PET data. Again, hover the mouse in the upper left corner to select rendering mode and then select HD MIP to finally create the PET whole-body MIP overview.\nTo save the MIP overview choose Batch in the Film/Save menu and select Rotate. Adjust the number of images to 60. In the description field choose an appropriate file name. Click Preview and check that the final result is acceptable. Close the preview and then select OK to start rendering the MIP overview. Make sure the rendering is complete before you exit.\nSend the diagnostic image data sets to the institutions Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) by selecting the appropriate series and click on the desired Network in the Destinations menu.\nTo save the source images under a different accession number, click Edit Patient and change the accession number. Then repeat the send procedure.\n5. Image Analysis and SUV Measurement\nLoad the co-registered PET/MRI data in an FDA-approved medical imaging viewer to read and analyze the scan. Commercial PET/MRI viewers allow for measurement of the maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) in 3D.",
    "Note: For this specific protocol, we used MIM version 6.6.\nChoose Calculate SUV statistics from the tool bar. Position the region of interest (ROI) around the tissue exhibiting pathological 18F-FDG uptake on the co-registered PET/MRI. The ROI diameter can be enlarged by holding and dragging with the right mouse button. The software will determine both the mean and maximum SUV value. For patients with lymphoma, measure the liver and mediastinal blood pool as a standard of reference. Follow institution-specific guidelines for reporting of SUV measurements.\nSubscription Required.
