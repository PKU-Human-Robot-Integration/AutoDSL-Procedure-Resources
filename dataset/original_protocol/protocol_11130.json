    "All animal experiments were approved by Animal Experiments Committee (Dier Experimenten Commissie, D.E.C.) under license AVD1060020172410. All animal were maintained in accordance with local guidelines using standard protocols (www.ZFIN.org).\n1. Preparation\nReagents\n\t\nPrepare egg water: 0.6 mg/L final concentration sea salt.\nPrepare 5 mg/mL Tricaine 25x stock: Mix 5 g of Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate or MS-222) powder, 900 mL of demineralized water, and 21 mL of 1 M Tris (pH 9). Adjust to pH 7 and fill up to 1 L. Tricaine can be stored at 4 °C for short term (up to six months) or can be stored at room temperature for a month at room temperature when protected from sunlight.\nPrepare 1.5% (w/v) agarose in egg water: 1.5 g in 100 mL of DPBS. Microwave to dissolve.\nPrepare 1% (w/v) low-melting agarose in egg water: 1.5 g in 100 mL of DPBS. Microwave to dissolve.\nPrepare 2% (w/v) PVP40 stock in DPBS: 1 g of PVP40 in 50 mL of DPBS. Vortex and incubate at 37 °C to facilitate dissolving. Store at room temperature.\nUse DMSO. It is often used as the solvent in drug treatments and should be stored at 2-8 °C the dark.\nUse TrypLE, a synthetic trypsin replacement that is less damaging to the cells and allows for the gentle dispersion of strongly adherent cells.\nPrepare Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) without Mg2+ and Ca2+ for washing the cells. The lack of Ca2+ impairs cell-cell adhesion through cadherins.\nPrepare lentiviral plasmids: psPAX2 (plasmid #12260) and pMD2.G (plasmid #12259) gifted by Didier Trono and either a GFP (Plasmid #106172) or tdTomato (Plasmid #106173) encoding transfer plasmid (Addgene).\nUse LipodD293: Highly efficient HEK293T optimized transfection reagent.\nAgarose dish",
    "NOTE: When using dishes that have been stored for a long time make sure to add a small volume of egg water to the dishes before starting injection (this will prevent the fish from drying out too fast).\n\t\nPrepare 1.5% (w/v) agarose coated dishes (agarose dissolved in egg water).\nUse immediately, or store at 4 °C in inverted position.\n2. Needles\nNOTE: Make sure that the capillaries have been calibrated on the filament used. When switching either the filament or the capillary, determine the ramp value of the capillaries on the filament used (see needle puller manual).\nOne glass capillary will yield two micro injection needles. Before making needles, check the structural integrity of the filament (2.5mm box filament) of the needle puller.\nMake sure that both filament and capillary are calibrated to get the corresponding ramp value. When the filaments structural integrity is compromised (i.e., uneven, holes, molten etc.), change the filament.\nUse the following program (Needle #99, Heat=ramp+15, pull=95, velocity=60, time=90). Store the needles in a designated Petri dish (containing either clay or tape to stick the needles to)\n3. Generation of lentiviral particles\nNOTE: To prevent a waste of time and resources a quick tumorigenicity check can be performed prior to lentiviral transduction. This is done to ensure that the cell line to be used is sufficiently tumorigenic in the zebrafish model, to this end the cells can be stained with a CMdiI (or analogous tracer) as described in Liverani et al. 2017 15.\nPlate HEK 293t cells one day prior transfection to achieve a confluency of approximately 70% (routinely done by splitting a full flask to the same volume culture flask at a dilution 1:3 one day prior).",
    "At the day of transfection, co-transfect the required packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G viral envelope expressing plasmid along with either a GFP (Plasmid #106172) or tdTomato (Plasmid #106173) encoding the transfer plasmid. The exact amount of plasmid used is specified in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Both psPAX2 and pMD2.G were gifted by Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid #12260 and #12259, respectively).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62356/62356fig01.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the described zebrafish engraftment system. A) The timeline of the approach, with breeding the zebrafish at day 0 (B1). The fish are harvested in the morning after crossing the fish (day 1). After 48-54 hours the fish have largely hatched (shedding their chorion) and the fish are injected (retro-orbitally or systemically, B2) after cleaning the water of the chorion debris (day 2). The larvae are subsequently screened using a stereo fluorescent microscope and all larvae displaying unwanted phenotypes are discarded (day 3). Depending on the goal of the experiment either the larvae are imaged over time (B3, engraftment kinetics, imaged at 1-, 4- and 6-days post injection (dpi)) or the fish are randomized and entered into experimental groups, treated with drugs and compared to vehicle control (drug screening, imaged at 6 dpi).

Add 32 µL of LipoD293 reagent to 500 µL of serum-free DMEM, and vortex to mix completely. Mix both volumes together thoroughly. Allow the plasmids and the lipoD293 to complex for 20 minutes.\nAdd dropwise to a 75 cm2 cell culture flask containing 70% confluent HEK293T cells containing 9 mL of complete culture medium. Add the transfection mixture directly to the cell layer using a serological pipette (flask in horizontal orientation).",
    "Replace medium with 20 mL of fresh complete DMEM 16 hours post-transfection. Harvest supernatant after 72 hours post transfection. Aliquot viral supernatant in 1 mL aliquots and store at -80 °C. The lentiviral supernatant is stable at -80 °C for at least 1 year.\n4. Lentiviral transduction\nBefore lentiviral transduction, establish a kill curve when using a selectable lentiviral construct.\nFor the kill curve, plate the cell line to be transduced in a 12 well plate (confluence approximately 10-20%). Add a dose curve of the selectant (approximate concentrations for kill curves: puromycine 0.5-10 µg/mL, blasticidin 1-20 µg/mL, geneticin (G418) 100-2000 µg/mL, hygromycin 100-2000 µg/mL).\nChange the medium every three days to assure a stable concentration of the chosen selectant.\nAdd 1 mL of lentiviral supernatant to 9 mL of culture medium, containing a final concentration of 8 µg/mL polybrene on 20-40% confluent cells. Volumes can be scaled down, while maintaining this ratio of supernatant/medium.\n16-24 hours post transduction, exchange the medium. When required, repeat the former step to enhance phenotype penetrance (check fluorescence to decide if another transduction is required).\n48 hours post transduction, select the cells using the antibiotic corresponding to the resistance marker incorporated into the lentiviral cassette. The concentration to use for the selection of the transduced cell population should kill the wild-type population within 7 days after application of the selectant (i.e., allowing the transduced cells to outgrow the wildtype population).\nApply viral supernatant in different multiplicities of infection (MOI's) to ensure that the transduction and the genetic lesions incurred by the cellular genome does not negatively affect cell viability or tumorigenicity.\n5. Breeding zebrafish\nOn day 0, 2 days prior to engraftment of cancer cells, mate adult zebrafish in \"family cross\" fashion at room temperature (Figure 1).",
    "Remove the tank of zebrafish from the housing system (maintained at 28.5 °C).\nSeparate the fish into small breeding clusters at a 1:1 ratio male: female, with 10 fish per cluster. Place the fish in small breeding tanks, in water drawn from the housing system, above a slanted grate (slanted, to mimic the shallows wherein zebrafish would naturally spawn).\n\tNOTE: Induced by the decline in temperature from 28.5°C to room temperature (25°C) and the entrance into the next light phase of the dark/light cycle the fish will spawn.\nSubsequently, remove the adults and transfer into their housing tank.\nCollect the eggs and wash with egg water using a strainer. Divide the eggs to approximately 75-100 per dish and maintain at 28.5°C.\nApproximately 6 hours post collection, clean the dishes of dead or malformed embryos.\nThe next morning, exchange the egg water and again clean the dishes of dead embryos.\n6. Harvesting cells\nNOTE: Proper cell preparation is key to the implantation procedure, using a superfluous amount of cells allows for easier downstream processing. The third centrifugation step is critical, as this will leave you with only the cell pellet, the remaining PBS stuck on the sides of the centrifuge tube greatly exceeds the final resuspension volume.\nPrewarm all media and solutions used in cell culture in a 37 °C water bath before use.\nAdd 2 mL of TryplE per 75 cm2 culture flask or 1 mL per 25 cm2 flask and incubate until all cells are rounded. For most cell lines 2-5 minutes should be sufficient. For highly epithelial cells or fibroblastic cells 5-10 minutes should allow for proper detachment (insufficient trypsinization will hinder downstream processes, and facilitates cell aggregation during implantation).\n\t\nGently tap the side of the flask to dislodge remaining cells.",
    "Add up to the original culture volume of complete medium. Pipette up and down gently but thoroughly with a serological pipette to shear cell clumps into single cell suspension. Do not generate foam during this process as foam is indicative of mechanical shearing of the cells.\nTransfer into a sterile 15 mL tube and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 200 x g at room temperature. Aspirate supernatant and add 1 mL of sterile PBS. Carefully and thoroughly resuspend the cells using a sterile 1000 µL pipette.\nRemove 20 µL cell suspension for counting and transfer the remaining cell suspension to the centrifuge. Centrifuge for 4 minutes at 200 x g at room temperature.\nCRITICAL STEP: Remove all PBS, centrifuge for 30 s at 200 x g at room temperature, and remove the remaining PBS.\nDilute the cells to 250 cells/nL in 2% polyvinylpyrrolidon 40 (PVP40, 2% (w/v) in DPBS) as follows:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62356/62356eq1v2.jpg \n\t(for example, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62356/62356eq02.jpg\nThoroughly resuspend the cells, while preventing the formation of air bubbles (cells can be kept for at least 2 hours in 2% PVP40 without loss of tumorigenic potential).\n7. Xenograft modeling\nAll experiments should be performed in compliance with local animal welfare regulations.\nDepending on the application two main variations in experimental design are classified as a phenotype assessment (7.1 the pre-screening stage) and secondly 7.2 a screen where either the cells have been modified prior to engraftment or 7.3 where the embryos are treated with a chemical inhibitor.\nPre-screening and determination of tumorigenic potential\n\t\nEngraft zebrafish larvae of interest (WT, transgenic or reporter line) at 2 dpf with a varying number of fluorescent cells (i.e., 200, 400, 600 ±100).",
    "Screen larvae 16-24 hours after injection to remove outliers (extremely high or low cell numbers in circulation for the ectopic model, or cells inside the head for the orthotopic model) and remove wrongly engrafted fish. Indicate nr of larvae per experimental group for group analysis vs kinetic analysis of the same larvae.\nMonitor the zebrafish larvae at regular intervals (1,2,4,6 days post injection (dpi)) and image 20 individuals (as described in steps 9 and 10), out of a pool of ±50 larvae.\nMonitor general phenotype and disease progressions and subsequently quantify with ImageJ (measuring integrated density of the fluorophore signal in the cancer cells).\nPlot the data to visualize the cancer cell growth kinetics within the zebrafish (Figure 3).\nModify cells a priori (knock down or knock out of a gene of interest) and engraft into zebrafish.\n\t\nEngraft fish and remove all unwanted phenotypes (per condition).\nImage the individuals at 1 dpi (20 larvae per group). Individuals can be imaged at set intervals (1,2,4 and 6 dpi).\nAt 6dpi after imaging, euthanize the fish by overdosing with tricaine (10-fold over dosing at 0.4 mg/mL) and discard on absorbent paper lining a funnel.\nTreat fish with drugs after engraftment.\n\t\nPrior to drug application on engrafted zebrafish, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on zebrafish (titrate down from 10 µM- 0.150 nM, using the highest volume of solvent as a negative control) we have set the MTD as the concentration where >80% of individuals survive the entire treatment.\nOne day post injection, remove the unwanted phenotypes.\nRandomly divide the fish into groups (36-48 individuals/ condition) and maintain in a 24 wells plate with 6 larvae per well in 1 mL of egg water.",
    "Apply drugs 24 hours after engraftment. As a control use the same amount of solvent (DMSO, EtOH etc.) at the highest volume applied for an experimental group.\nStart drug treatment at the maximum tolerated dose. Change the egg water containing drug every other day. Remove egg water and dead larvae as completely as possible during every change.\n8. Injection\nNOTE: Use a pneumatic pulse controller coupled to a compressed air line, supplying pressure in surplus of 100 psi. This allows for enough pressure to both inject (≈20 psi) and to eject possible cell aggregates (≈100 psi). The starting pressure and time should be approximately 200 ms at 20 psi. If either has to be decreased more than 50% at the start of the injection either the cell suspension is too fluid (cell or PVP40 concentration too low) or needle opening is too large.\nCarefully remove a capillary needle from its container. Break the needle to form an opening of ø20 µm, using a fine watchmakers' forceps.\nCarefully and thoroughly resuspend the cells using a 20 µL pipette tip. Pipette cell suspension into the open glass capillary needle using a long (microloader) tip. Load the needle into the micro manipulator.\nPlace ~20-40 larvae anesthetized in 0.04 mg/mL tricaine on an agarose dish using a transfer pipette. Remove excess moisture to immobilize the larvae using a transfer pipette. The larvae will mostly be oriented in a lateral fashion due to the presence of a still relatively large yolk sac.\nInject the larvae with approximately 200, 400 and 600 cells via the Duct of Cuvier (doC) for ectopic model.",
    "Similarly, inject larvae retro-orbitally (RO). To yield the orthotopic model (injecting 100 ±50 cells), modify the pneumatic pulse length on the picopump (start at ~20 psi, 200 ms and adjust accordingly). During injection ensure that the larvae do not dry out. Make sure that all (or most) larvae are injected.\nFlush off injected larvae with fresh egg water and transfer to a labelled clean Petri dish (pooling up to 150 individuals per dish). Repeat this process until sufficient larvae are injected.\nAfter engraftment, maintain the fish at 34 °C in a humidified incubator, where 34 °C is the highest temperature readily tolerated by zebrafish and allows for efficient engraftment of mammalian cancer cells.\n\t​NOTE: In general, with injection of single cell lines in both doC and RO we have observed an approximate death due to mechanical damage of <5% (mechanical damage kills the larvae between 1-16 hours post injection).\n9. Screening\nUsing a stereo-fluorescence microscope, screen the fish for the appropriate phenotype 1 hour post implantation when comparing cells modified a priori (or 1 day post implantation, when screening drugs, before the random assignment into treatment groups).\nLarvae implanted through the doC should have cells in the tail between 1 hour and 16 hours post implantation. Remove all other fish, including fish that display abnormality, from the injected pool.\n\t​NOTE: Larvae implanted retro-orbitally should have cells only in the interstitium behind the eye, larvae that have cells spread throughout the head or body are removed from the pool.\nClean positively screened larvae and randomly assign to experimental groups.\nAfter engraftment, maintain fish at 34 °C in a humidified incubator and monitor daily. Hematogenous dissemination of cells implanted through the doC is almost instantaneous, whereas metastatic spread of cells implanted in the RO cavity will spread after 2-4 days.",
    "10. Epifluorescent imaging of zebrafish larvae\nAnesthetize zebrafish larvae with 0.2 mg/mL tricaine, either by adding tricaine to the water of the fish or by moving a sub-population of fish from the maintenance dish to a dish containing 0.2 mg/mL tricaine.\n\t\nKeep zebrafish in a dish with tricaine until they remain stationary, until stimulation of the lateral line does not induce flight behavior.\nTransfer fish to an agarose covered Petri dish, approximately 10 per dish. Remove the majority of the water though gently raising one end of the dish (allowing the water to gently pool in the lower end of the Petri dish). If done carefully all fish will align, tails facing downwards.\nImage all fish from the top of the dish to the bottom. Then wash the fish off with egg water into a dish without tricaine.\nRepeat until enough individuals are imaged.\nThen transfer the larvae either back to the 34 °C or cull (at 6 dpi) through overdosing with tricaine (i.e., 0.5 mg/mL, incubating for 10 min, prior to discarding on absorbent paper lining a funnel).\n11. Confocal imaging of (engrafted) zebrafish larvae\nAnesthetize zebrafish with 0.2 mg/mL tricaine as described previously.\nPlace a glass bottom confocal dish under a stereo microscope and focus on the bottom of the dish. Transfer 5-10 larvae to a glass bottom confocal dish. Remove as much water as possible.\nCover the larvae with 42 °C, 1% low melting agarose dissolved in egg water. Make sure that the agarose has cooled down to at least 42 °C before use; higher temperatures might harm or kill the larvae.",
    "Using the stereomicroscope, quickly but gently orient the larvae pushing it down, using a trimmed down micro loader tip. If a ventral orientation is required, hold the larvae in place with the tongs of a watchmaker's forceps (without touching the embryo).\nWhile the agarose sets make fine adjustments to the orientation of the larvae. Allow the larvae to set completely before transferring to the confocal microscope.\n12. Setting the confocal microscope\nSwitch on the green (488 nm) and red (564 nm) excitation laser lines. Place the confocal dish in the holder of the confocal microscope. Using the epifluorescence, move the light bundle to coalesce with the first fish (setting x and y). Through the ocular set the focus to coincide with the center of the larvae (setting z).\nSet 700 gain on both fluorescent channels, 1-5% laser power. Increase laser power and decrease offset to approximate full dynamic range. Do not over saturate the signal, but enhance the signal to merely show a few saturated pixels.\nWhen capturing a stitch, set the start and end of the larvae along one axis (either x or y), if set along one axis a whole embryo can be imaged in 1 x 4 segments and can be post processed into one image using ImageJ.\nAfter imaging, remove the larvae from the agarose by gently tearing it around the embedded larvae using watchmaker's forceps. Otherwise, euthanize the larvae by overdosing with undiluted tricaine, covering the agarose with a layer of tricaine and incubating 10 minutes.\n13. Data analysis\nOpen the individual data sets in ImageJ/Fiji (i.e., control, drug A, drug B, drug A+B) separately, starting with vehicle control.\nOpen the analysis macro (annotated script available) (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4290225).",
    "In brief the macro analysis does the following: concatenates all open images (one condition); splits the images into the separate channels comprising the image; closes all accessory channels (leaving the cancer cell channel); runs a thresholding algorithm, on the entire concatenated sequence; measures integrated density of each individual image; and saves the measures as an excel sheet in the root folder.\nRun the macro analysis on all conditions.\nCombine measurements (in general at least n=2*20) and remove outliers (Q-test in Graph pad Prism v8).\nNormalize measurements either to solvent control or to day 1 (dependent on the type of experiment, the former for a drug inhibition experiment and the latter for a growth kinetics experiment). Express measurements as normalized cancer cell burden (y axis) over time or condition (x axis) as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively."
