    "The animal experiments conducted in this study received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Baylor College of Medicine. All procedures were carried out in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Young (7-9 weeks) and old (12-16 months) C57BL/6J male and female mice were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparation of the imaging system\nPosition a heating pad on the imaging platform (see Table of Materials) to ensure the mouse's body temperature is maintained during imaging. Activate the heating pad and adjust the temperature to 35 °C.\nRemove the dust cover and turn on the laser scanning ophthalmoscope. Place a 55° lens on the machine.\nSet up the imaging software (see Table of Materials) and input essential information, including genotype, gender, age, etc. When the imaging session commences, select the IR (Infrared channel) for capturing ICGA images.\n2. Animal preparation prior to ICGA and FA\nWeigh the mouse to determine the amount of anesthesia (Ketamine/Xylazine 70-100/2.5-10 mg/kg, see Table of Materials) needed.\n\tNOTE: Optimizing the dosage is crucial as the metabolic profile varies among different mouse strains. It is essential to determine the appropriate dosage to avoid the mouse waking up before completing the imaging or the risk of an overdose and potential animal mortality.",
    "Use a 1 mL sterile syringe with a 30-32 G needle to deliver anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection. Gently pinch one of the mouse's paws to check whether the mouse is adequately anesthetized. If the animal exhibits any response or movement, it is advisable to wait for additional time before proceeding to the next step. This allows the animal to settle and ensures optimal conditions for the subsequent procedures.\nAdminister 1% tropicamide ophthalmic solution drops to dilate both eyes of the mouse. Wait at least 30 s before using 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride drops (see Table of Materials) on both eyes to reduce eye movement and blinking. Follow this up with lubricant eye gel drops.\n\tNOTE: Throughout the entire duration of anesthesia, it is important to address the issue of extreme dryness in the mouse's eyes, which can lead to corneal opacity. This opacity makes subsequent imaging challenging due to hindered visibility. To prevent this, it is crucial to apply lubricant eye gel drops continuously to keep the mouse's eyes moisturized.\nPlace the mouse on a heating water pad.\n\tNOTE: Mice possess a high surface area to volume ratio, resulting in increased heat loss to the environment. When combined with the temperature drop induced by anesthesia, this can pose a significant risk to the mouse, potentially leading to death due to hypothermia. It is crucial to take necessary precautions to prevent hypothermia and ensure the mouse's well-being during the procedure.\nPrepare a 1:1 volume mixture of 2 mg/mL ICG and 20 mg/mL Fluorescein dye (see Table of Materials). Administer 250 µL of the mixture through intraperitoneal injection using a 1 mL syringe and a 32 G needle.",
    "Insert the needle in the bottom left quadrant of the mouse abdomen near the hind legs at an angle parallel to the mouse's skin to avoid perforating any organs.\nCarefully withdraw the plunger and verify that no blood has entered the syringe cap. Proceed to inject the dye slowly and steadily, maintaining a consistent pace.\n\t\tNOTE: The ICG dye must be filtered with a 0.22 µm syringe filter before use.\n3. ICGA and FA\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad of the imaging platform to start imaging.\nPosition the mouse's body at a 45-degree angle to the camera and rotate its head slightly downwards. This allows the optic nerve to be in the center of the camera's focus.\nUsing a cotton swab, delicately wipe the eye to remove the layer of lubricant eye drops or gels on the eye being imaged first. Ensure to apply the lubricant gel drops immediately after completing the imaging procedure.\n\tNOTE: Leaving the eye without lubrication for more than 1 min while under anesthesia is not recommended.\nMove the camera toward the mouse's eye. Select the FA channel from the acquisition module. The luminescence emitted from the FA channel can be used to position in the center of the mouse cornea for faster placement.\nPosition the mouse's head in a way that the optic nerve is centered on the screen, avoiding the need to tilt the laser scanning ophthalmoscope at an angle. Make minor adjustments to the mouse's head position to achieve the desired alignment.\nOn the acquisition module, select the ICGA channel. Ensure that the laser intensity is set to 100% and select the 55° option to match the appropriate lens. This ensures optimal settings for the laser scanning ophthalmoscope.",
    "NOTE: To prevent oversaturation, it may be necessary to use a lower laser intensity, typically around 25%-50%, when imaging the early stage. Adjusting the laser intensity in this range can help capture clear and accurate images without causing oversaturation.\nWhen the eye occupies the entire screen on the imaging software, make adjustments to the sensitivity and focus settings to obtain the clearest image of the CNV membrane.\n\t\nRotate the round black button on the acquisition module to adjust the sensitivity of the image.\nRotate the knob on the ophthalmoscope to adjust the focus. The optimal focus for visualizing the retinal vasculature using FA is typically within the range of 35-45 D (diopters). On the other hand, the ideal focus for visualizing the choroid using ICGA is generally between 10-15 D.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the different sizes of CNV membrane, it may be necessary to adjust the focus in 10-30 D to obtain optimal imaging of the vascular morphology.\nOnce the focus and the sensitivity have been adjusted to achieve the best possible image, press the round black button on the acquisition module to normalize the image. Once normalization is complete (all frames captured), click on the acquire button on the touchscreen panel to save the image. Moving the camera around to image CNV from different angles may be necessary. The mouse can also be oriented in different positions to provide the best image of the CNV lesion.\n\tNOTE: One may have to readjust the focus or positioning of the laser scanning ophthalmoscope when viewing vasculature farther from the optic nerve.\nSwitch back to the FA channel using the acquisition module. Complete the same steps listed in steps 3.6-3.7 to adjust the sensitivity and focus of each image to capture the leakage of the CNV lesion.",
    "NOTE: Ensure the correct sensitivity is selected to avoid oversaturation of the CNV leakage and artificially increase the leakage area.\nImage the \"early phase\" of ICGA and FA 3-4 min post-injection.\n\tNOTE: The \"early phase\" is the time when the choroidal vasculature can be clearly and distinctly seen. During the middle phase, which typically occurs between 4-8 min, the retinal and choroidal vessels are much more faded and diffused. As the late phase (>8-10 min) sets in, both the choroidal and retinal vessels become indiscernible. Hyperfluorescent CNV lesions, however, exhibit maximal contrast against the diminished background. These mentioned timings are variable and depend on the concentration and amount of ICG dye injected. A greater amount of ICG dye tends to increase the timeline of each phase and provide more distinct vessels. A phase should be defined based on the key features listed above rather than an absolute time.\nOnce all images have been acquired, apply a gel lubricant or ointment to the mouse's eye and carefully monitor the mouse on the heating pad for recovery. It usually takes 1.5 h for the mouse to recover fully.\nPlace the mice back into their cages and the designated holding area once they have fully recovered from the anesthesia and are awake.\nBefore shutting down the imaging system and laser, export the images as either TIFF or JPEG files for subsequent analysis.\n4. RPE/choroid flat-mount and staining\nFix the eyes in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Wash the eyes with PBS three times. Remove the lens and cornea.\nIncubate the eyes in blocking solution (10% bovine serum albumin, 0.6% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Repeat PBS wash three times.",
    "Incubate the eyes with isolectin GS-IB4 Alexa-flour 568 conjugate and anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (see Table of Materials) overnight in the blocking solution.\nWash three times with PBS. Incubate the samples with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (see Table of Materials) for 2 h at room temperature.\nPerform 4 radial cuts from the edge to the equator. Carefully remove the retina17.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken to ensure the neovascular membrane is not accidentally detached.\nMount the flat-mounted choroid on a glass slide. Visualize the CNV using confocal microscopy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
