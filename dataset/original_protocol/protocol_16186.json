    "In this protocol, users will aggregate dissociated PSCs into three-dimensional (3D) spheres termed embryoid bodies (EBs). PSCs are first grown in the appropriate cell culture medium and allowed to reach the appropriate confluency. Then, the PSCs are dissociated into single cells in suspension and are seeded onto a 96-well plate in which the organoids will differentiate and be maintained. The ROCK pathway inhibitor thiazovivin is kept in the medium while cells are being seeded, to improve survival and inhibit apoptosis of the cells in suspension. The 96-well plate is then centrifuged to induce the formation of spherical aggregates from the cells in suspension, resulting in the EBs. The EBs are maintained in cell culture medium until the start of the differentiation protocol, described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0002].\nMaterials\nPSC cells (e.g., iPSCs reprogrammed in the lab (Malik & Rao, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0037]; Panopoulos et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0047]; Takahashi & Yamanaka, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0059]) or obtained from commercial sources (see Strategic Planning)\nEssential 8 Flex medium (Gibco, cat. no.

Passage iPSCs.\n         \nAspirate medium from sub-confluent iPSCs and wash cells with 1 ml/well of PBS.\nAspirate PBS and passage cells using ReLeSRTM, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Passage the cells at a 1:6 well ratio by resuspending one well of detached cells in 12 ml of E8 Flex containing 2 µM of TZV, and then seeding onto six wells of a 6-well plate coated with Matrigel, at a volume of 2 ml per well.",
    "Replace medium after 24 hr and culture cells in E8 medium until sub-confluency (70%-80%) is reached. If more cells are desired, repeat for the other well; if not, discard the cells in the second well.\nRepeat step 2 to maintain cells in culture until you are ready to create organoids. iPSCs can be passaged for >50 passages without any karyotypic abnormalities.\n3. Aspirate medium from sub-confluent iPSCs and wash cells with 1 ml of PBS. Use 2-3 wells of the 6-well plate from step 2 for each desired 96-well plate of organoids.\nThe number of organoid plates created is up to the user and will depend on the experimental design. If the user intends to run two immunofluorescence assays on three different test compounds with eight organoid replicates, they will therefore need 2 × 3 × 8 = 48 organoids for healthy and 2 × 3 × 8 = 48 organoids for diabetic conditions, resulting in one full 96-well plate of organoids.\n4. Aspirate PBS from each of the wells you will use and add 1 ml of room temperature Accutase to each of them. Gently tap the side of the plate 3-5 times every minute to induce cell detachment. Continue doing so for ∼5 min or until most cells have detached. Monitor the cells under a light microscope to ensure cells have detached.\nAccutase should not be warmed above room temperature, as this may cause permanent inactivation of the enzyme.\n5. Prepare 1 ml per well of E8 Flex containing 2 µM TZV. Stop the reaction by adding 1 ml of this mix to each well. Gently pipette the cells up and down 2-3 times using a wide-tip p1000 pipette to dissociate any remaining cell aggregates, and transfer medium from all wells to a single conical 15-ml Falcon tube.",
    "As mentioned in Strategic Planning, E8 Flex should be at room temperature.\n6. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n7. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of E8 Flex + 2 µM TZV, gently pipetting up and down 2-3 times. Make sure to pipette up and down enough so that the pellet is resuspended.\n8. Take 10 µl of medium with cells and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube containing 990 µl of PBS, to prepare a 1:100 dilution. Count the number of dissociated cells using a Moxi Cell Counter.\nFor a higher concentration of cells (e.g., >10 million cells), and for counting purposes, a further 1:10 dilution is recommended. Take 10 µl from the diluted cells and dilute in 90 µl of PBS, for a final 1:1000 dilution.\nCell can also be counted using a hemocytometer (see Current Protocols article: Strober, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0057]).\n9. Gently mix the medium with cells using a wide-tip p1000 pipette to create a uniform cell suspension, and transfer the cells to fresh E8 Flex + 2 µM TZV in a 15-ml Falcon tube. Adjust to a final cell concentration of 100,000 cells/ml.\nFor one 96-well plate, transfer 1.1 million cells and adjust to 11 ml to obtain 100,000 cells/ml.\nCell aggregation into embryoid bodies\n10. For a single 96-well plate, and using a serological pipette, transfer 11 ml of E8 Flex + TZV containing 100,000 PSCs per ml into a reagent reservoir.\n11. Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 100 µl of cell-containing medium to each well of a 96-well clear ultra low attachment microplate, for a total of 10,000 cells per well.",
    "A total of 9.6 ml of cell-containing medium will be used; the remaining 1.4 ml in the reservoir are to ensure that exactly 100 µl of medium can be easily transferred into each well using a multichannel pipette.\n12. Centrifuge the plate for 3 min at 100 × g, room temperature.\n13. Carefully remove plate from the centrifuge, check aggregates under a light microscope, and place the plate in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\nThe cells should have aggregated into a ball near the center of the well (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-fig-0002], left).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed449dd1-7565-46d5-a6ca-c5058149f12f/cpz1461-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nEmbryoid body generation.

Carefully remove 50 µl of medium from the wells using a multichannel pipette and add 200 µl of fresh E8 Flex medium. Return to incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for an additional 24 hr.\nAt the end of this period, the user will obtain the EBs.\nFresh E8 Flex medium should not contain TZV and should be at room temperature. There should be a total volume of 250 µl of medium in each well.\nThe EBs should look like small spheres (∼200 µm) (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-fig-0002], right).\n15.

    "Here, the user will begin a time-specific (i.e., same time of day for every required medium change) differentiation protocol on the PSC-derived EBs generated in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0001], based on three Wnt pathway modulations. The basal medium of differentiation will differ across organoids, with half of the plate placed in healthy glucose and insulin levels and half in hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic levels, the latter to simulate diabetes conditions. Aside from the levels of glucose and insulin in the medium, all other conditions are identical, and the organoids are differentiated in the same manner at the same time, side by side. Care should be taken when performing medium changes on the developing organoids, as they are in suspension at the bottom of the well and very delicate and, therefore, sensitive to agitation. The user is advised to conduct the removal and addition of medium slowly on the side of the well, and to vary the angle of the multichannel pipette in accordance with the level of medium.

    "1. Prepare an aliquot of healthy differentiation medium and a separate aliquot of diabetes differentiation medium. Prepare 10 ml of each for a single 96-well plate.

Take the 96-well plate containing the EBs (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0001], step 14, containing 250 µl of medium per well) out of the incubator and remove 166 µl of medium (i.e., 2/3 of total volume) using a multichannel pipette from each well. To half of the plate (48 wells), add 166 µl of the healthy differentiation medium prepared in step 1 per well. To the other half, add 166 µl of the diabetes medium per well.\nAs only 2/3 of the medium is replaced, the concentration of the differentiation compounds that the EBS are exposed to are 4 µM, 0.36 pM (1.25 ng/ml), and 0.08 pM (1 ng/ml) for CHIR99021, BMP4, and Activin A, respectively.\nThis day marks day 0 of differentiation.\n3. Incubate the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for exactly 24 hr.\nNote the time the differentiation has begun and perform subsequent medium changes within a 20-min window of that time in the following steps (e.g., if the medium change on day 0 of differentiation in step 2 was executed at 10:00 am, all subsequent medium changes in steps 3-10 should be executed between 9:50 am and 10:10 am on their respective days).",
    "4.

Return the plate to the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for exactly 24 hr.\nIt is recommended that the plate be labeled with healthy and diabetic on each side, to ensure that organoids in the healthy conditions only receive healthy differentiation medium, and those in the diabetic conditions only receive diabetes differentiation medium.\n5. On day 2, prepare 10 ml of healthy differentiation medium and 10 ml of diabetes differentiation medium per 96-well plate, each with 3 µl of 10 mM WNT-C59, for a final medium concentration of 3 µM WNT-C59.

Take the plate out of the incubator and remove 166 µl of medium from each well (i.e., 2/3 of the total volume) using a multichannel pipette. Add 166 µl of fresh healthy or diabetes maintenance medium to the corresponding wells. Return the plate to the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "10. Perform medium changes every 48 hr by removing 166 µl of medium from each well (i.e., 2/3 of the total volume) using a multichannel pipette and adding 166 µl of fresh healthy or diabetes maintenance medium to the corresponding wells. Proceed to downstream analyses (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0003]) on differentiation day 15, or continue culturing for longer-term organoid maintenance.\nAll organoids are expected to spontaneously beat by day 10. Organoids grown in diabetic conditions should appear larger and more circular compared to the control counterparts (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-fig-0003]). Users may notice that the medium surrounding the diabetic organoids is depleted more quickly, causing it to turn yellow; this is expected, and is likely related to size and metabolic rate differences of the diabetic organoids.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6171d952-968d-4d09-bf22-dd91415d777f/cpz1461-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nDay 15 heart organoids differentiated under healthy and diabetic conditions.

Glucose levels of 11.1 mM or more are considered diabetic in humans.",
    "This protocol describes the steps for subjecting the healthy and diabetic organoids from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0002] to immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence analysis can help to identify key cellular markers within the organoids and to investigate the effects of pregestational diabetes on structural composition and morphology in the developing human heart organoids, such as myocardial and epicardial tissue formation.\nIn this assay, the organoids are fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA), and primary antibodies are used to detect tissue-specific proteins (e.g., TNNT2 for cardiomyocytes and WT1 for epicardial cells) within the organoids. Secondary antibodies, which are conjugates with fluorescent labels, are then used to visualize the location of the primary antibodies under confocal microscopy. This technique allows us to determine the tissue composition of the organoids and visualize the structural organization of major heart tissues in relation to one another. The epicardium, for example, plays a crucial role in the developmental stages of the heart, and gives rise to other cardiac cell types (J. Cao & Poss, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0006]; Y. Cao, Duca, & J. Cao, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0007]), while the myocardium makes up the muscle tissue and forms the heart chambers (Keung et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0024]; Zhao et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0065]). The formation of these heart tissues is critical for establishing a recapitulative human heart model in vitro. Visualizing the development of these tissues in the organoids using immunofluorescence can provide essential information on the health of the heart organoids in response to treatments or toxicity screening.\nWe also briefly comment on how to prepare the organoids for other assays not described here, including live assays or RNA-based assays such as RT-qPCR or RNA-seq. We describe how to transfer and prepare the organoids for these analyses.",

    "1. Cut off the pointed end of a p200 pipette tip about 10 mm from the bottom so that the opening of the tip is about 3 mm in diameter.\nThis allows collection of the organoids without causing damage as they enter and exit the tip.\n2. Remove the day 15 organoids plate (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-prot-0002]) from the incubator. Using the p200 pipette with a cut tip (step 1), slowly collect one organoid from a well by collecting 100-200 µl of medium with the organoid. To do this, hold the pipette straight up and then lower it to the bottom of the well as you slowly extract the medium along with the organoid.\nThe organoid should be visible to the naked eye inside the tip.\n3. Slowly dispense the collected organoid and medium into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Collect the necessary number of organoids per condition into this same tube, but without exceeding 8 in a single tube; larger amounts of organoids per tube are not recommended for some downstream analyses. If performing immunofluorescence, proceed to step 6.\nOrganoids should sink to the bottom of the tube in a few seconds. It is recommended that 6-8 organoids be collected for each tested condition in each assay (e.g., 8 healthy organoids and 8 diabetic organoids in separate tubes to be used for immunofluorescent co-staining of cardiomyocytes and epicardial cells).\n4. For live assays, transfer organoids in tube with medium to the secondary location for the live assays (e.g., calcium transient imaging, see note below), and analyze immediately.\nOrganoids should not be kept at room temperature for more than 1 hr.",
    "Live assays may include, but are not limited to, calcium transient imaging for electrophysiology and live fluorescent imaging for transgenic lines with fluorescent markers or molecular probes. Live assays should be conducted according to manufacturer's instructions or published protocols (Lewis-Israeli, Volmert, Gabalski, Huang, & Aguirre, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0032]; Ming et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0041]) and are not described in this protocol.\n5.

Proceed to RNA extraction using an extraction kit such as RNEasy Mini Kit from Qiagen, per the manufacturer's instructions. Subject the RNA to the analysis of interest, for instance, (see Drakhlis et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0012]; Lewis-Israeli et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0032]; Manivannan et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0038]).\nFour organoids typically yield 40-100 ng/µl of RNA.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence analysis\nTubes should not contain more than 8 organoids per tube; higher numbers will reduce the effectiveness of the fixing process.\n6. Remove as much medium from the tube of organoids as possible without disturbing the organoids at the bottom.\n7. Prepare 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and add 400 µl to each tube. Incubate for 30-45 min at room temperature.\n8. Prepare a stock solution of 20 mM glycine in PBS by adding 150 mg of glycine to 100 ml of 1× PBS (store stock solution at 4°C for up to 1 month). Remove PFA without disturbing the organoids at the bottom of the tube, and wash three times with 400 µl PBS supplemented with 20 mM glycine, each time for 5 min.\nFixed organoids can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.",
    "9. Remove PBS-glycine from each tube without disturbing the organoids. Add 100 µl of immunofluorescence blocking solution and place on a thermoshaker at room temperature overnight, shaking at 300 × g.\n10. Remove immunofluorescence blocking solution from each tube without disturbing the organoids. Wash once with 100 µl of PBS.\n11. Prepare antibody solution (see Reagents and Solutions) with added primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommended antibody dilution [e.g., Anti-Cardiac Troponin T antibody (Abcam, ab8295) at a 1:200 dilution, and Recombinant Anti-Wilms Tumor Protein antibody (Abcam, ab89901) at a 1:100 dilution, diluted in immunofluorescence antibody solution]. Remove PBS from the tube without disturbing the organoids and add 100 µl of immunofluorescence antibody solution containing the desired primary antibodies. Place on a thermoshaker at 4°C set to 300 × g, for 24 hr.\n12. Remove immunofluorescence antibody solution without disturbing the organoids, and wash with 100 µl PBS three times, for 5 min each. Keep the tubes on the thermoshaker at 300 × g during the washes.\n13. Prepare antibody solution (see Reagents and Solutions) with secondary antibodies added according to the manufacturer's recommended antibody dilution [e.g., Donkey anti-Rabbit I Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor™ 488 (Thermo, A-21206) at a 1:200 dilution, and Donkey anti-Mouse Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor™ 594 (Thermo, A-21203) at a 1:200 dilution, diluted in immunofluorescence antibody solution]. Remove PBS from each tube without disturbing the organoids and add 100 µl immunofluorescence antibody solution containing the secondary antibodies corresponding to the primary antibodies used in the previous step. Place on a thermoshaker at 4°C set to 300 × g, for 24 hr. Cover thermoshaker with aluminum foil to provide a dark environment for the tubes.",
    "14. Remove immunofluorescence antibody solution without disturbing the organoids, and wash with 100 µl PBS three times, each time for 5 min. Work with minimal light exposure, to minimize the effect on the fluorophores of the secondary antibodies.\n15. Prepare slides by pipetting a drop of 90-µm Polybeads around the inside corners of where the cover glass will be. Dry the Polybeads using a Kimwipe. Place a drop of clearing mounting medium over the Polybeads so that they remain in place.\nPlacing mounting medium on top of the beads first will prevent them from moving around when adding the organoids and accidentally overlapping with the organoids during imaging.\n16. Using a cut p200 pipette tip (see step 1), transfer the stained organoids to the slide, positioning them between the Polybeads. Dry excess PBS around the organoids using the tip of a Kimwipe. Space out the organoids so that they do not touch each other and therefore interfere with the imaging process. Do not exceed 8 organoids per slide, for ease of imaging.\n17. Place approximately 120 µl of clearing mounting medium on top of the organoids on the slide, ensuring that no bubbles are formed. Use a pipette tip to reposition organoids that may have moved when the mounting medium was added. Cover with a cover glass.\n18. Seal the perimeter of the cover glass with transparent nail varnish, and store in the dark overnight at room temperature before imaging. Store in the dark at 4°C for long-term storage (up to 6 months).\nAn overnight incubation before imaging provides enough time for the clearing mounting medium to settle, improving the quality of image acquisition.",
    "19. Proceed to imaging using a confocal microscope (e.g., Nikon Instruments A1 Confocal Laser Microscope). Use a 10× objective for full organoid structure analysis, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-fig-0004], or a 60× objective for cellular-level imaging analysis, as previously described (Lewis-Israeli et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-bib-0032]).\nFor whole-organoid (10×) imaging, it is recommended to acquire a Z-stack 20-80 µm in depth using the recommended Nyquist sampling frequency step size (∼2-3 µm). For high-magnification (60×) imaging, it is recommended to acquire multiple Z-stacks of 5-10 µm in depth using the recommended Nyquist sampling frequency step size (∼0.2-1 µm), and at least six different locations throughout the organoid, for representative image acquisition.\nRepresentative confocal images are shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.461#cpz1461-fig-0004].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a3622812-2a13-4874-a781-76137ff2fd0b/cpz1461-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nConfocal immunofluorescence images of representative day-15 organoids differentiated in healthy and diabetic conditions. Organoids grown under healthy (5.5 mM glucose) and diabetic (11.1 mM glucose) conditions were fixed on day 15 and stained for the cardiomyocyte-specific marker TNNT2 (red), the epicardial specific marker WT1 (green), and the nuclear dye DAPI (blue), allowing visualization of the disparities in morphological organization of the heart tissues between the conditions. Scale bar: 500 µm."
