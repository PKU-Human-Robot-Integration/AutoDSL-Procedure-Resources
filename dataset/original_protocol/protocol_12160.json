    "NOTE: The overall scheme of protocols is shown in Figure 1.\n1. The Dissection of the Larval Ring Gland (RG)\nNOTE: In D. melanogaster, which belongs to cyclorrhaphous Diptera, the PG is within a composite endocrine organ called the ring gland (RG, Figure 2D). Since it is unfeasible that the PG is surgically separated from other types of cells (discussed later), a practical target is to isolate an intact, undamaged RG by dissection.\nPreparation of larvae at the appropriate developmental stages\n\tNOTE: To synchronize the developmental stages of D. melanogaster larvae, it is necessary to collect eggs within a narrow time window and to collect larvae at the appropriate times.\n\t\nCollect eggs for 2 h on a grape-juice agar plate at 25 °C.\nCollect newly-hatched 1st instar larvae under a dissecting microscope with forceps and transfer them to a small vial containing mashed standard yeast/cornmeal fly food.\n\t\tNOTE: The age of larvae is represented by \"hours after egg laying (hAEL)\", \"hours after hatch (hAH)\", or \"hours after L3 ecdysis (hAL3E)\".\nAt the appropriate time point, collect the staged larvae with a disposable plastic loop to avoid undesirable injury. To minimize a difference in developmental progression of the 3rd instar larvae, collect the 2nd instar larvae at 70 hAEL (48 hAH) and allow them to molt in 2 h intervals. Then, collect the 3rd instar larvae within 2 h after the L3 ecdysis; this procedure gives 0-2 hAL3E larvae.\nTransfer the staged larvae to a dish filled with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nRinse the larvae with PBS to remove residual food from the body.\nCoarse dissection of larvae under a dissecting microscope\nHold the mouth hook of a larva with forceps. Sever the larval body at the anterior one-third of the body length using micro scissors.",
    "Hold the cut end of the anterior larval body with one pair of forceps. Using the other pair of forceps, gently push the tip of the head toward the inside of the body; this procedure turns the larval body inside out.\n\t\tNOTE: This step can be skipped for the dissection of 1st instar larvae.\nRepeat steps 1.2.1-1.2.2 with additional larvae for 5-10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of larvae should be equal to or less than 20 to save time for dissection.\nFillet dissection of larvae\n\tNOTE: This method allows keeping the position of tissues to remain intact.\n\t\nLeave larvae in water only for 1 h. The larvae are immobilized due to asphyxiation.\nPut a larva dorsal side up in a drop of PBS on a silicon-coated dish, with its dorsal side up.\n\t\tNOTE: The dorsal side has 2 tracheal tubes running longitudinally.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, insert an insect pin into the anterior tip of the larva using forceps. Stretch the larval body to the posterior side and put a second pin into the posterior tip of the larva.\n\t\tNOTE: In addition to insect pins, a needle made from a tungsten wire can be useful21. A needle can be embedded in a pipette tip through heating for use as a dissecting needle.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, make a small incision near the tail with micro scissors. From the incision, cut the dorsal cuticle longitudinally along the dorsal midline toward the head. Be careful not to damage tissues under the cuticle.\nStretch the bodywall cuticle on each side and place 4 pins at each corner of the dissected bodywall.\nRemove a portion of anterior fat body with forceps, to expose the brain-RG complex be exposed on the surface. Remove a pair of salivary glands, if necessary.",
    "Fixation and staining of tissue with immunohistochemistry\nPut the anterior one-third of the larval bodies (step 1.2.2) into a 1.5 mL microtube filled with 500 µL the fix solution (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS). Fix less than 20 samples at one time, otherwise PBS attached to the fixed samples may cause an unfavorable dilution of the fixative. For fillet dissection, remove a drop of PBS and then add a drop of fix solution.\n\t\tNOTE: For fix solution, either 3.7% formaldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde may be used.\nIncubate the dissected tissues in the fix solution for 30 min at room temperature (RT) or alternatively for 2 h at 4 °C.\nReplace the fix solution with 500 µL PBS and quickly rinse the samples 3 times. Wash the samples with 500 µL 0.3% PBT (PBS + 0.3% octylphenol ethoxylate) for 15 min on a rocker at RT. For fillet dissection, remove the insect pins and transfer the samples into a 1.5 mL microtube.\n\t\tNOTE: For increasing the permeability of antibodies into tissues, the samples are treated with 500 µL 2.0% PBT for 1-2 h on a rocker at RT.\nReplace PBT with 500 µL blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin in PBT). Incubate the samples for 1.5 h on a rocker at RT.\nReplace the blocking solution with 50 µL the primary antibody solution, i.e. antibodies diluted in the blocking solution.\nIncubate the samples overnight on a rocker at 4 °C.\nReplace the primary antibody solution with 500 µL 0.3% PBT and quickly rinse the samples 5 times. Wash the samples 3 times with 500 µL 0.3% PBT for 15 min each on a rocker at RT.",
    "Replace 0.3% PBT with 50 µL the secondary antibody solution (dye-conjugated antibodies diluted in the blocking solution). For nuclear staining, 0.5 µL 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 mg/mL stock solution) is added to 50 µL solution. Incubate the samples on a rocker for 2 h at RT or alternatively at 4 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the samples in the dark.\nReplace the antibody solution with 500 µL 0.3% PBT and rinse 5 times. Wash the samples 3 times with 500 µL 0.3% PBT for 15 min each at RT.\nFine dissection of the brain-RG complex containing the PG and mounting\nUse a disposable pipet to transfer the immunostained samples to a dish filled with 0.3% PBT.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid inconvenient bubbles during dissection and mounting, 0.3% PBT can be replaced with PBS.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, hold the cuticle or mouth hook with one pair of forceps. Using a 27 G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe as a \"knife\", cut the anterior tip of the esophagus and eye discs to remove the brain-RG-eye disc complex from body cuticle.\nSeparate the esophagus and gut from the brain-RG-eye disc complex with forceps. Since the esophagus passes through the brain above the ventral nerve cord (VNC), pull out the gut to the posterior side.\n\t\tNOTE: To remove extra imaginal discs from the samples, cut the connections between the brain, eye discs, and leg discs with a needle knife.\nRepeat the steps 1.5.1-1.5.4 for other samples.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent tissue debris from sticking to the samples, transfer each completed sample to a different clean dish filled with 0.3% PBT or PBS.\nTransfer the samples to the center of a clean glass slide with a micropipette.",
    "NOTE: For 2nd or 3rd instar larvae, the end of a micropipette tip should be truncated with a razor blade.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, align individual samples with their dorsal side up by using forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: The RG is located on the dorsal side of the brain (Figure 2A). This alignment facilitates the specification of individual samples during imaging.\nTilt a glass slide and wipe off as much excess PBT as possible. Put a drop of mounting reagent on a side of the slide. Place the edge of a cover slip from the other side of the drop and put the cover slip on the samples slowly with forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure prevents the samples from moving outside the cover slip.\nStore the samples at 4 °C. Keep the samples in the dark.\n2. The Dissection of the Ovary in Adult Females\nPreparation of adult females\nFeed female flies with standard yeast/cornmeal fly food for 3-4 days to fatten up the ovary. Maintain at 25 °C.\nDissection of the adult female ovary\nAnesthetize female flies with CO2 gas and cut off their heads.\nTransfer fly bodies to a 3 cm dish filled with PBS.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, hold the thorax on the dorsal side using forceps. Grasp the abdominal segment A5 or A6 with the other forceps and peel away the abdominal cuticle toward the posterior side. Wipe off the sticky cuticle from the tip of the forceps.\nPinch an oviduct and take out the ovary from the body.\nComb and spread the tips of the ovary with forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: This operation improves the efficiency of immunostaining.\nDissection of adult female brain, VNC and reproductive organs.\n\tNOTE: This method allows the innervation of the ovary to be kept intact.",
    "Anesthetize female flies with CO2 gas and transfer them to a silicon-coated dish filled with PBS.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, hold the proboscis and peel away the head cuticle to expose the brain with forceps. Remove the trachea attached to the brain.\n\t\tNOTE: The brain is a white and rounded structure. The brain connects to the VNC in the thorax.\nHold the thorax on the dorsal side and cut off the legs and wings with one pair of forceps. Using the other pair of forceps, peel away the thorax ventral cuticle from the bases of the legs. Once the VNC is exposed, remove the residual dorsal cuticle and muscles attached to the VNC using forceps. Be careful not to damage the connection between the brain and the VNC.\nUse forceps to peel away the abdominal cuticle and expose the ovary and their interactive organs including neurons, the crop, the gut, the oviduct, the uterus, and the accessary gland.\nRemove the residual tissues including the trachea and the fat body using forceps.\nFixation and staining of tissue with immunohistochemistry\nTransfer approximately 8-10 pairs of the ovaries to a 1.5 mL microtube filled with 250 µL the fix solution (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) and incubate the samples for 30 min at RT.\nReplace the fix solution with 500 µL PBS and quickly rinse the samples 3 times.\nWash the samples 2 times with 500 µL 0.1% PBT for 5 min each at RT.\nReplace PBT with 50 µL blocking solution. Incubate the samples for 1 h on a rocker at RT.\nReplace the blocking solution with 50 µL the primary antibody solution.\nIncubate the samples overnight on a rocker at 4 °C.",
    "Replace the primary antibody solution with 500 µL 0.1% PBT. Wash the samples 3 times with 500 µL 0.1% PBT for 15 min each on a rocker at RT.\nReplace 0.1% PBT with 50 µL secondary antibody solution. For nuclear staining, add 0.5 µL DAPI  to 50 µL the solution. Incubate the samples for 2 h on a rocker at RT.\nReplace the secondary antibody solution with 500 µL 0.1% PBT. Wash the samples 3 times with 500 µL 0.1% PBT for 15 min each on a rocker at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: The washing procedure can be done at 4 °C overnight. Keep the samples in the dark.\nMounting the samples onto glass slides\nTransfer the samples to a glass slide with 0.1% PBT using a micropipette.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid inconvenient bubbles during dissection and mounting, 0.1% PBT can be replaced with PBS.\nFor the ovary, separate the strings of the ovarioles from each other with forceps under a dissecting microscope. Do not injure the tips of the ovarioles containing the germaria. For the brain-VNC-reproductive organ complex, remove the residual cuticle and arrange the position on a glass slide.\nWipe off as much excess PBT as possible and put a drop of mounting reagent in the center of the samples. Place a cover slip slowly using forceps.\nStore the samples at 4 °C. Keep the samples in the dark.\n3. Imaging with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope\nObserve the samples under the microscope and bring the steroidogenic organs in the field of view. Once the view is fixed, switch the imaging system to the image acquisition mode.",
    "NOTE: The 10-20X objective lenses are used to obtain the images of the brain-RG complex or the whole ovary. Alternatively, the 40-63X objective lenses (water or oil immersion) are used for visualizing the subcellular localization of proteins in GSCs or the neuronal innervations of the PG and the ovary.\nSet up the parameters of image acquisition on the attached software. Select the combination of fluorescence (e.g. GFP and RFP). By fast scanning procedure, adjust the laser power, the sensitivity of detectors (Gain/Offset), and the size of the pinhole.\n\tNOTE: To acquire images at high quality, the scanning laser power and the sensitivity of detector (Gain) should be optimized for each sample. To outline the shape of the tissues, a transmitted-light image can be taken in addition to a fluorescent image.\nTake Z stacks of the images. During a continuous fast scan, move the focal plane with the focus drive of the microscope and set the starting position and the end position. The number of slices and the interval distance between slices are adjusted accordingly.\nSelect the scan speed, the scan method, and the bidirectional scan mode.\n\"Start the real scans\" for image acquisition.\nSave the image with the format of the attached software.\n\tNOTE: The original image files contain the information of image acquisition parameters and scales. Exported images can be processed using an image processing software on the computer22.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
