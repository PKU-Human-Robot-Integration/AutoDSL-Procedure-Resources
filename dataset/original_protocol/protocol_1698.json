    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSteps 1–36 outline how to perform photo-assisted recording of oxytocin neurons in freely moving rats.\nChronic implantation of an opto-electrode and microdrive\nTiming: 2 h\nOT neurons reside mainly in the PVN and SON together with other neuronal cell types, making them difficult to target during in vivo electrophysiology experiments. This issue can be solved by employing viral tools that enable the expression of particular transgenes in the desired cell population. Here we describe a procedure to implant an opto-electrode, which is an optic fiber coupled to a recording electrode, into the target brain region to allow for optogenetic tagging (opto-tagging) of the OT neuron population.\nNote: The term ‘opto-electrode’ used in this text will refer to an optic fiber coupled to either a basic silicon electrode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A1) or a tetrode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A2), both of which have been tested using this protocol. Both types have different strengths and limitations, therefore the choice of opto-electrode will depend on the specific goals of the study.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1283-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Implantation of opto-electrodes and photo-assisted recording of oxytocin neurons\n(A1) Silicon probe electrode inserted into a single-axis optic fiber integrated with a microdrive (opto-electrode).

    "(B1) Surgical steps for the implantation of the microdrive: two ground/reference screws are implanted in the posterior part of the skull and craniotomy holes are drilled above the target brain areas. Scale bar, 500 μm. (B2) Use pre-heated wax to seal the implantation hole and the naked opto-electrode shank, then apply a 3D-printed plastic cover around the probe implantation site and fix it with UV glue. Finally, suture the skin, put a copper mesh around the whole implanted drive and solder the grounding wires to the copper mesh to form a mini-faraday cage (see C2). (B3) Mount the microdrive on the stereotaxic arm with the adapter, loosen the lateral screws to free the optic fiber (see text) before implantation. Then align the probe tip to Bregma zero point and move it above the target coordinates, and slowly implant it half way before the mirodrive base touches the skull. Fix the microdrive base on the skull first with UV-glue, then apply dental cement.

It is necessary to ground every potential source of electrical noise to the faraday cage using a grounding hub. This includes the stereotaxic frame arms, probe adapter, preamplifier, and power supplies of any nearby devices.",
    "(F) Picture of an anesthetized rat during acute recording covered with a transparent box with a grid of holes for ‘airpuff’ stimulations on the skin in various body regions. Arrows depict sequential order of stimulation sites.\n(G) Impulse generator (Master-9) and diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) lasers (DreamLaser) for blue light optogenetic stimulation.\n(H) Opto-electrode for acute recording and photo-stimulation (Neuronexus).\n(I) Two representative single units monitored in real-time during implantation (waveforms on the left) and PSTH of the units aligned to blue light pulses (histograms on the right). The upper panel shows a putative interneuron displaying indirect activation as indicated by a 180 ms delay in the onset of increased spiking activity following the blue light pulses. The lower panel shows a putative OT neuron as it responds to blue light pulses with a very short (<10 ms) delay.\nThis approach combines the extracellular recording of neural activity with the selective excitation of OT neurons via the cell-type specific expression of channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), an excitatory light-sensitive ion-channel activated by a specific wavelength of light (λ ∼ 470 nm). In this approach, the opto-electrode is accompanied by a microdrive (oDrive, Neuronexus or Versa-8 optical, Neuralynx) which will be fixed to the top of the skull following implantation of the opto-electrode. The microdrive is shielded from physical damage and electrical interference by using a protective copper mesh, which facilitates chronic recording in freely moving rats.\nFor surgery preparation, follow steps 1–5 of the viral injection section in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section after making note of the following modifications:\nMake the incision on the skin at least 2 cm long and use four bulldog skin clamps to ensure adequate exposure of the entire Bregma–Lambda region, which is required for successful implantation of the opto-electrode/microdrive system.",
    "Clean the skull around the implantation site with 2% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to prevent micro-bleeding before drilling any extra holes.\nAvoid leakage of H2O2 into the holes designated for viral injection.\nUsing the high-speed drill, make six holes (0.5 mm diameter) in the skull around the implantation site. Install two stainless-steel screws (0.6 mm diameter) pre-soldered with silver wires (ground and reference) in the two most caudal holes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B1). Install regular stainless-steel screws in the remaining four holes.\nCover the six screws with a thin layer of UV glue (RelyX Unicem 2 Self-Adhesive Resin Cement) for better anchoring on the skull surface.\nMake sure not to apply any glue to the Bregma point and implantation site as they have to remain intact for the following steps.\nUse micro-drills (HSS mini milling cutters 0.5 × 40 mm ball nose) to enlarge the PVN injection hole for the implant, and remove the debris with a rubber suction bulb.\nPenetrate the dura with a fine needle or insect pin.\nIf bleeding occurs, apply gentle pressure with a micro hemostatic sponge. If excessive bleeding occurs, please refer to ‘problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]’ for potential solutions.\nNote: If there is tissue hyperplasia around the craniotomy hole from the previous viral injection, carefully clean it with sterilized PBS solution, remove excess tissue or protective gel with fine tweezers, and then enlarge the hole with the drill to obtain the desired diameter (0.5–1 mm); the implantation site must be clean and white brain tissue must be visible for the success of this protocol.",
    "Propel the microdrive to extend the pre-mounted opto-probe or opto-tetrodes up to half of the driver’s full length (e.g., 10 mm out of 20 mm, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A1). Then attach the microdrive to the stereotaxic arm with an adaptor and verify that the opto-electrode shank is perfectly aligned to the vertical bars on the stereotaxic frame in all directions.\nCritical: The Neuronexus oDrive is designed with lateral optic fiber fixation screws (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B2). Carefully loosen them first before propelling the probes. This step can only be done before implanting the probe, as any physical contact will damage the probe and brain tissue once it has been implanted. Neglecting this step can also cause the optic fiber to break while propelling the probe.\nCritical: If using any other customized opto-tetrodes, it is important that the optic fiber tip is placed 300–500 μm above the tetrode’s recording sites (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A2). A higher distance will not allow for optogenetic activation, whereas a smaller distance will generate strong photo-electrical noise during opto-stimulation. We recommend using a 200 μm fiber cannula with a 0.37 NA (numerical aperture) to ensure sufficient light coverage and penetration of the recording area. The conductance of each channel should be measured before implantation. We recommend gold-plating the tetrode tips and checking before implantation that the impedance of each electrode is 0.3–0.5 MΩ. If large photo-electrical artifacts from opto-stimulation are detected on the recording electrodes, please refer to ‘problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]’ for potential solutions.\nNote: When working with tetrodes, it is recommended to apply a drop of sterilized PBS onto the tetrodes as the superficial tension of the liquid drop will keep the wires close together and thereby facilitate easier implantation.\nMount the microdrive with the opto-electrode onto the stereotaxic arm with an adapter.",
    "Repeat the stereotaxic calibration of the skull with respect to Bregma using the tip of the opto-electrode (be careful not to touch the skull) and then position the shank above the craniotomy hole (AP: −1.8 mm, ML 0.35 mm for PVN).\nFor non-tetrode opto-electrodes, position the probe medial and the optic fiber lateral to the skull midline.\nIn all cases, make sure the opto-electrode shank will fit in the craniotomy hole before attempting implantation.\nSlowly insert (10 μm/s) the opto-electrode into the brain tissue until reaching a point above the target depth (DV −7.5 mm).\nIf bleeding occurs during insertion, pause and wash with PBS for 1 min before continuing (see ‘problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]’ for potential solutions).\nIf the electrodes bend upon entering the brain (usually due to incomplete puncturing of the dura), retract the electrodes from the brain tissue, wash with PBS thoroughly, adjust the position 100 μm anterior or posterior and then re-attempt the implantation.\nNote: When working with tetrodes, wax should be applied prior to fixation of the drive base on the skull because of the short distance between the drive base and electrodes.\nSeal the probe shank and implantation hole with heated wax.\nPlace some solid wax around the electrodes, then carefully melt it with the tip of a soldering gun (80°C–100°C); alternatively, place solid wax in a beaker and use heat to melt it, then draw it into a syringe and quickly apply it to the electrodes implantation site before it turns solid again.\nCarefully remove any excess wax that remains on the skull surrounding the craniotomy hole (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B2). The purpose of the wax is to seal the hole in the event of bleeding and to prevent dental cement from contacting the electrodes, which would prevent movement of the microdrive.",
    "Fix the base of the microdrive onto the rat’s skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B3) with UV glue (3M RelyXUnicem 2) and apply dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus Kulzer; interior layer 1:2, outer layer 1:1 liquid:solid component ratio) around the microdrive base and the six anchor screws to achieve a firm and solid implant.\nAfter the dental cement has solidified, mount the Omnetics connector onto the microdrive (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B4).\nPrepare a custom-made square-shaped copper mesh to protect the microdrive and the opto-electrodes from physical damage (e.g., due to self-grooming).\nSolder the wires from ground and reference screws to the copper mesh to build a mini-faraday cage around the implanted head-stage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C2).\nSeal the copper mesh all around the microdrive with solder.\nFix the copper mesh to the skull with dental cement.\nIf neural recordings display high amounts of electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio, please refer to ‘problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]’ for potential solutions.\nCritical: Carefully prevent any leakage of soldering material onto the rat’s skin. The copper mesh helps to decrease electrical noise from the environment. In order to prevent artifacts from the animals movements, the ground wires must be firmly soldered to the copper mesh and secured to the skull with dental cement.\nLet the dental cement dry for 10 min and then place the rat in a heated recovery cage without any objects that can potentially damage the implants during awakening.\nAfter recovery, place the rat in a single-housing cage with a high ceiling to avoid damage to the head stage (e.g., remove any obstacle in the cage that can potentially hit the implanted opto-electrode). If the implanted head-stage becomes detached or damaged, please refer to ‘problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]’ for potential solutions.",
    "Monitor the health status of the rat every day for one week after the implantation, administer analgesic via the drinking water (e.g., Dafalgan 500 mg/L, tablets, store at room temperature (15°C–25°C)). Rats typically return to normal behavior 3 days after surgery. However, if the rat continues to frequently scratch the surgical site, it is recommended to administer additional analgesic (e.g., Rapidocain 30 mg/kg, i.p., stock concentration 10 mg/mL, store at room temperature), as needed.\nCritical: optic fiber tips are extremely vulnerable, especially during the connection with the fiber patch cord. Make sure it is well protected after surgery. For the Neuronexus oDrive, secure it with lateral screws; for customized opto-tetrodes, it is recommended to fix the optic fiber ferrule, and only mount the tetrodes to the microdrive to allow them to move independently (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A1 and 2A2).\nOptically assisted identification of oxytocin neurons\nTiming: 30–60 min\nOnce the opto-electrode is correctly placed in the target region, short pulses of light are used to evoke time-locked responses in the neurons which are expressing the light-sensitive opsin (ChR2) and to distinguish the neuronal population of interest from other neighboring neurons.\nStarting from day 3 following implantation until day 7, the experimenter should handle the rat for 15 min/day for habituation to the connecting procedure.\nTurn on the laser 30 min before starting the recording to preheat the system. Adjust the laser power to have a stable output power of 10–20 mW/mm2 (after coupling the optic patch cord to the laser). Measure the power of each optic fiber in advance with an optical power meter (e.g., PM100D, Thorlabs) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).",
    "Critical: Handling of the laser system (Class 3B for visible-light lasers with output power > 5 mW) can be hazardous for eye exposure and must be used by instructed personnel only. Precautions when handling the laser include keeping the beam away from the eye or face and using laser safety glasses or goggles designed for the specific wavelength of the laser. Also, remember that reflections of mirrors, glasses, and shiny surfaces can be just as hazardous as the direct beam. Do not wear watches or jewelry when handling the laser beam.\nNote: A damaged patch cord is another reason for failed optogenetics stimulation. It is important to make sure both tips of the fiber patch cord are perfectly polished and no light leakage from the fiber cable occurs. The coupling efficiency should be above 90% from the light source.\nConnecting procedure of the implanted rat to the recording system:\nGently lock the rat’s head with one hand.\nConnect the optic fiber to the fiber patch cord and the Omnetics connector with the pre-amplifer (always align the connector and the pre-amplifer correctly with the printed logo “Omnetics” on the same side).\nAttach the recording cable (SPI ultra-thin wire, Intan) to the recording system and connect the fiber patch cord to the laser.\nPlace the connected rat into a clean and empty cage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D1).",
    "Critical: Handling of the animal is crucial to reduce the stress caused by the connecting procedure. Unhabituated rats are very likely to damage the opto-electrodes; well-handled rats should sit calmly on the experimenter’s arm. If the animal displays signs of stress during handling despite habituation, wait until the rat calms down before proceeding to any further steps. Alternatively, animals could be lightly anesthetized (3–5 s) in the isoflurane chamber prior to connecting the cables, note however, that this has to be permitted by the animal welfare licenses. If the rat has lost or broken the implanted head-stage, please refer to ‘problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]’ for potential solutions.\nSet the parameters of the triggering device (e.g., Master-9, A.M.P.I.) to activate the laser (wavelength 473 nm, DreamLasers) in 10 ms pulses with different inter-pulse intervals (stimulation at 1 Hz, 5 Hz, or 10 Hz with 300, 1500, and 3000 pulses, respectively) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nTurn on the data acquisition system (DAQ), link the laser TTL output to the digital input of the DAQ board, and start the electrophysiology recording and the stimulation sequence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C1).\nVisualize the light-evoked response of the recorded single units online in the raster mode (aligned to the laser TTL signals).\nCheck if some neurons are activated by the light pulses, which provides an indication that the electrodes have been correctly implanted in the target region.",
    "Afterwards, in the offline mode, analyze the sorted spikes in a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) aligned to the onset of the light pulses. Only units that show a clear increase (+3 standard deviations compared to the average of a duration of 100 ms during pre-stimulation, peak response within 10 ms delay) in response to the light pulses are labeled as ChR2-expressing OT neurons (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. I lower panel, also see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. A with red marker and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nIf no action potentials (spikes) are detected with the recording electrodes in the target region (PVN), please refer to ‘problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]’ for potential solutions.\nIf no neurons respond to the blue laser stimuli or have a long delay and/or jittered response, please refer to ‘problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]’ for potential solutions.\nNote: OpenEphys GUI (starting from version 0.2.7) has a built-in online PSTH function, it is useful to visualize the real-time laser response of any recorded units.\nSave the channel number and firing properties of the optically responding cells for easier identification in the analysis (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H and 2I).\nNote: When using silicon probes, the channel arrangement illustrated in the channel map provided by the manufacturer has to be converted depending on the type of adaptor and preamplifier used. We recommend to check carefully the channel arrangement before implanting the probe by inserting it slowly, using the stereotaxic arm, into sterile PBS solution and visualizing the noise level of each channel in real time on the recording acquisition system. When electrodes are inserted into the PBS solution the noise level of the corresponding channel should decrease due to the higher conductivity of the solution compared to air.",
    "If no units were found responding to the laser stimuli, propel the microdrive 50–100 μm and wait a few hours before re-doing the steps above. Do not propel the microdrive more than 200 μm per day. Please refer to ‘problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]’ for potential solutions if the problem persists.\nCritical: Only neurons displaying a response to the light pulses with a short latency (less or equal to 10 ms) can be considered a primarily responding neuron. Other units showing responses, but with higher latencies are likely to be secondary responses, therefore not specific to the cell type of interest (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. I upper panel, also see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], A borderless panel).\nRecording of identified oxytocin neurons during social behavior\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nAfter the identification of light responding cells (opto-tagging), it is important to perform the in vivo recordings with experiment protocols as soon as possible, usually within 3–7 days, to maximize the likelihood of acquiring the signal from the same opto-tagged neurons. The following protocol can be used for extracellular recording in freely-moving rats and social interaction of novel conspecific rats.\nBring the experimental rat and the stimulus rats into the recording room at least 30 min prior to the recording, to allow the rats to habituate to the new environment (this might vary depending on your experimental design).\nPlace the experimental rat, already connected to the neural recording system, into the recording chamber (open field arena, square 60 × 60 cm) and start the recording session (electrophysiology recording and video camera need to be synchronized, e.g., by TTL outputs or LEDs).",
    "Let the rat freely explore the open field arena for 10 min. This session will serve as a ‘baseline’. Gently remove the rat from the arena and place it into an empty clean cage for an interval of 15 min.\nFor social interaction, place the experimental rat and a conspecific naïve rat (in our case, female Wistar rat, 8–16 weeks old, 220–300 g) in opposite corners of the recording chamber at the same time and let them interact for 10 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D2).\nNote: Always thoroughly clean the arena with 70% ethanol followed by distilled water prior to the experiment to remove any odour that may alter the normal behavior of the rats. Use low illumination (< 20 Lux) in the recording chamber to avoid stress for the animals.\nTrack the rat’s locomotion with an automated tracking software (e.g., Ethovision XT11, Noldus) and manually annotate social interaction events.\nRemove both rats from the recording chamber and place them in separate cages.\nRepeat the steps 17–21 at the end of the recording session to confirm the identity of opto-tagged neurons for further analysis.\nNote: It is important to keep a record of the OT neurons before, during, and after social interaction, because the signal can be noisy during social interaction due to large motion noise. Therefore, the OT neurons identified previously can serve as a template for spike sorting.\nAlternative: temporary implantation of opto-electrodes and acute recording of oxytocin neurons in anesthetized rats\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "Acute recordings in anesthetized rats allows for the monitoring of neural activity from opto-tagged OT neurons while mimicking social somatosensory stimuli. This mimicry can be achieved by applying external stimuli, such as ‘airpuffs’, to the rat as described in Tang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]. To record neural activity of OT neurons with temporary opto-electrodes in anesthetized rats, follow the same procedure as described in steps 1–13 and 14–21 for chronic implantation with the following changes:\nNote: Opto-tetrodes are not suitable for acute recordings because they bend easily during repeated use and are difficult to clean between implantations.\nAttach a temporary opto-electrode (Neuronexus) and it’s connectors to the stereotaxic arm. Then immediately connect the preamplifier and optic fiber patch cord to the probe as it is not feasible to connect them after the implantation.\nImplant only two screws on the rat’s skull for grounding and referencing purposes. No anchor screws are needed because the probe will be removed after recording.\nConnect the probe’s ground and reference pins with the wires attached to the ground and reference screws, respectively.\nNote: It is recommended to solder micro connectors to the grounding wires on screws and probes before implantation to facilitate the process. Otherwise you will need to solder the wires together during implantation.\nPeriodically apply sterilized PBS solution on the rat’s skull to keep the brain moist during the whole implantation and recording procedure. Monitor the rat’s breathing rate during the whole process.",
    "Critical: Electrophysiological recordings of anesthetized rats that are head-fixed to the stereotaxic device require an electrically isolated environment (ideally a faraday cage over the whole setup) and proper grounding (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E), as any open-end electronic devices nearby can generate electrical noise detectable by the preamplifier. In our experience, the digital meter of the stereotaxic frame, the heating plate, and the laser generators (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G) were the major sources of electrical noise. It is important to ground everything to the faraday cage and check the basal noise level of the signal (<25 μV after applying band-pass filter) before implanting and recording. If neural recordings display high amounts of electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio, please refer to ‘problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]’ for potential solutions.\nIf opto-tagged neurons were not found after the first implantation, retract the opto-electrode (200 μm/min for the first 5 min, then 2 mm/min until fully retracted), wash it with PBS, and redo the same procedure. We are typically able to record from each site 2–3 times, after which the brain tissue becomes too damaged for further recording. If action potentials (spikes) still cannot be detected after repositioning the opto-electrode in the target region, please refer to ‘problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]’ for potential solutions.\nPerform an acute recording of opto-tagged OT neurons while delivering external sensory stimulation, such as ‘airpuffs’, to the rat (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAfter recording, carefully retract the opto-electrode and unplug the connectors. Wash the probe following the protocol described below. Gold-plating is advised after repeated usage, make sure the impedance of each channel is 0.3–0.5 MΩ.\nSacrifice the rat after recording, perfuse it with PFA (4%) and extract the brain to verify the implantation site.\nNote: Silicon Probe cleaning and care protocol:",
    "After withdrawing the probe from the brain tissue at the end of an experiment, immediately rinse it with a gentle stream of distilled water. Soak the probe (only the silicon shank; avoid soaking the epoxy or PCB) in a protein-dissolving detergent (e.g., enzyme cleaner AN000689 from Thomas Recording, 1 g/50 mL of distilled water) or diluted surgical instrument detergent (e.g., EmPower from Metrex, 1:128 in 20°C–40°C water). This process may take 0.5–2 h depending on the residual tissue. After the protein dissolving procedure, isopropyl alcohol (e.g., 70% IPA) can be used for sterilization, but not for more than 15 s. Using isopropyl alcohol without firstly dissolving the residual tissue from the probe could cause protein to stick to the electrode sites. Do not use ultrasonic cleaners and do not autoclave probes as this may cause damage.\nSteps 37–46 describe how to image the oxytocin neurons population with fiber photometry in vivo.\nOptically assisted implantation of optic fiber for photometry recording\nTiming: 30–45 min",
    "Fiber photometry allows for the capture of calcium-dependent fluorescent activity in a cell-type specific neuronal population, such as the OT neurons in the PVN, using an optic fiber. This technique relies on the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) that changes its fluorescence as a function of intracellular calcium ion concentration. Among these sensors, the most commonly used are proteins from the GCaMP family (Chen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), which are able to rapidly emit a fluorescent signal (λ = 473 nm excitation peak wavelength, λ = 515 nm emission peak wavelength) in response to changes in intracellular free calcium concentration. These fluorescent signals are commonly used as a proxy for neural activity. Three to four weeks after the injection of a viral vector designed to express GCaMP6s in OT neurons (rAAV-OTp-GCaMP6s) in the PVN, an optic fiber is implanted above the PVN where it collects the fluorescent signal emitted by the OT neural ensemble (Grund et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Tang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: The implantation procedure can be optimized by recording the signal from the optic fiber during surgery. Once the optic fiber tip is approaching the target region where GCaMP6s is expressed, it is expected to detect an increase of the fluorescence collected in the green channel (515 nm).\nFollow the initial steps (1 to 5 in the ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section) for surgery preparation, as described in the section for viral injection, to obtain a clean and exposed skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1283-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

(C3) Real-time visualization of calcium signal acquired with fiber photometry imaging.\nPerform the craniotomy (circular shape, 1 mm diameter) above the target region using a high-speed drill.\nBe careful when drilling, especially when approaching blood vessels toward the end. It is important to avoid contaminating the optic fiber tip with blood as it might reduce the fiber’s optical transparency.\nIf excessive bleeding occurs, please refer to ‘problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]’ for potential solutions.\nNote: Clean the craniotomy region with 2% H2O2 and let it dry for 1 min, make sure there is no blood or exudates. If blood contacts the fiber tip, retract the tip, clean it with ethanol (70%), and repeat the procedure.",
    "Connect the fiber tip to the fiber photometry recording setup with an optic patch cord (mono fiber optics patch cord, Doric Lenses) and visualize the output fluorescence. Then connect the implantable fiber cannula (Thorlabs, CFMXD10, CFMC54L10) to the fiber patch cord with quick release interconnectors (Thorlabs ADAF2, ADAL3) or mating sleeves.\nNote: We recommend using a 400 μm diameter, 0.5 NA implantable fiber cannula that can capture the fluorescence emitted from a larger brain volume and thereby increase the signal-to-noise ratio up to 4 times greater than a fiber cannula with a 200 μm core diameter.\nAttach the optic fiber and patch cord to the stereotaxic holder, making sure the optic fiber is perfectly aligned to the vertical bars on the stereotaxic frame in all directions. Then slowly (10 mm/s) insert the fiber until it is ∼100 μm above the target region (for PVN, DV −7.9 mm) to maximize the fluorescence signal collected from the target cell population (Qin et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nWhile inserting the optic fiber into the brain tissue, the experimenter should see a visible increase in the fluorescent signal when approaching the region where the calcium sensor is expressed. Fine tune the final depth of the fiber in such a way as to maximize the fluorescent signal.\nNote: If the optic fiber was successfully implanted above the GCaMP6s sensor expression site, it should be detected as an increase of the background fluorescent signal, as well as transient calcium signals due to spontaneous activity of the cells.",
    "Critical: The optic fiber cannula used for imaging (400 μm diameter) is larger than the opto-probe (100–200 μm), thus the insertion process needs to be very slow in order to avoid tissue damage. It is recommended to withdraw 0.3 mm for every 1 mm of insertion to allow the surrounding brain tissue to adapt. Inserting the cannula too rapidly may cause the brain tissue to be pushed down, leading to the dislocation of the target site.\nAfter reaching the desired depth, secure the optic fiber on the rat’s skull using dental cement and four anchor screws (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A2), as described in steps 3 and 8. Wait until the dental cement has solidified.\nRelease the optic fiber then carefully lift up the arm of the adaptor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A3).\nSuture the wound closed and place the rat in a heated recovery cage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A4).\nNote: We do not recommend using a protective cap for the optic fiber tip because, in our experience, the rat will always remove the cap within a few days. Furthermore, if the cap is attached too tightly there is a risk of breaking the fiber implants each time the cap is removed. Alternatively, simply clean the fiber tip with 70% ethanol and a cotton swab before each recording.\nIn the 3 days following the surgery, check the animal’s health status daily and administer analgesics as described for the surgical procedure in the viral delivery section.\nPhotometry recording of a neural population in vivo\nTiming: 1–3 h",
    "Note: Allow at least 1 week of recovery from the surgery before starting the imaging session. Usually, the signal to noise ratio of fiber photometry will increase after recovery from bleeding and inflammation caused by implantation surgery. Choose a fiber patch cord with low auto-fluorescence (LAF, Doric Lenses). Photo-bleaching is advised 1 h prior to the recording session to minimize auto-fluorescent noise (for details refer to the protocol below). The auto-fluorescent noise is mainly generated from the external layers of the fiber patch cord. If using a CMOS camera-based fiber photometry system, this issue can be softened by selecting a region of interest only in the center of the fiber core.\nNote: Patch Cord Photobleaching protocol (derived from Doric Lenses, (https://www.doriclenses.com/downloads/ApplicationNotes/LAF_Application_Note_V1.0.0.pdf[href=https://www.doriclenses.com/downloads/ApplicationNotes/LAF_Application_Note_V1.0.0.pdf]).\nDue to their chemical composition optical fibers possess an innate fluorescence (autofluorescence), which may interfere with photometry measurements. Autofluorescence can be drastically reduced through photobleaching, which involves exposing the fiber to light of a high intensity in order to bleach the fluorophores responsible for autofluorescence. Photobleaching is necessary before any photometry experiment and has to be performed while the system is disattached from experimental subjects (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B1).",
    "The procedure includes the following steps: Connect one end of the patch cord to the optical fiber output of a blue LED light source, typically the one used for the experiment. Place the opposite end of the patch cord in a beam dump or black box. The disconnected end of the patch cord will emit intense light during the photobleaching process; it is important that it is isolated to avoid harm or damage. Set the output current of the light source to its maximum value. Leave the light on for 1–2 h. An illumination for 1–2 h should decrease the autofluorescence by 75 % (typically) of its initial value. Further photobleaching (12+ hours) can reduce the natural autofluorescence by 90% (typically) of its initial value. Repeat the process for each patch cord should there be multiple channels. Photobleaching provides a temporary reduction of autofluorescence. Repeat this procedure before each experiment to ensure a minimal level of autofluorescence. As autofluorescence recovery is very slow, a simple 1 h exposure can be sufficient if the patch cord was used in the last few days. If motion noise or artifacts are present during fiber photometry in vivo imaging, please refer to ‘problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]’ for potential solutions.\nAttach the low-auto fluorescent patch cable to the cannula tip on the rat’s head and record the baseline calcium activity (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B2 and 3B3).",
    "Note: Reduce the amount of light present in the recording room to a minimum in order to avoid interference with the collected fluorescent signal. With the Thorlabs interconnector, the fiber cannula is sheltered from the environmental light (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C1). If using other connectors (mating sleeves), it is advised to put a black cover on it (e.g. heat-shrink tubing) to block the environmental light. It is also important to make sure the DAQ system itself is grounded because electrical noise can contaminate the voltage-converted fluorescent analog signal (output of the fiber photometry recording system, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C2). If neural recordings display high amounts of electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio, please refer to ‘problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]’ for potential solutions.\nVisualize the collected fluorescent signals (both 405 nm isosbestic control channel and 473 nm GCaMP6s calcium signal channel) from the optic fiber in the DAQ software.\nTo visualize the change in fluorescent signal online, apply a band-pass filter (low-cut 0.1 Hz and high-cut 100 Hz), and a 3kHz sampling rate to reduce data size due to oversampling, which is sufficient considering the slow calcium dynamics of GCaMP6s (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C3).\nIf no fluorescent signal or only a very weak signal is detected during imaging, please refer to ‘problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]’ for potential solutions.\nCritical: Due to GCaMP6s sensor fluorescence bleaching, the optical signal will decrease over time, thus it is necessary to adjust the final output of the LED power to minimize the bleaching effect. We recommend using an output power of 50–100 μW/mm2 (from the fiber tip) with a 20 Hz stimulation rate. We also do not recommend recording for more than 3 hours continuously (this time may vary for different fluorescence sensors).",
    "Note: Photometry imaging can be employed in animals that are awake and freely moving or while they are anesthetized. In the case of recording exclusively in anesthetized animals (acute recording Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B2 and 3B3), no anchor screws are needed and imaging can be done immediately after implantation of the fiber cannula in the GCaMP6s-expressing region (refer to the ‘airpuffs’ protocol with fiber photometry imaging in Tang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). After recording, the optic fiber can be retracted from the brain, washed with ethanol (70 %) and reused more than once.\nHistological verification of recording locations\nTiming: 3 days\nThe recording location of opto-electrodes and optic fibers are verified post-hoc with immuno-histological techniques. If the expression of genes of interest delivered by viral vectors is absent or not sufficient, please refer to ‘problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]’ for potential solutions.\nAfter the experiment, euthanize the rat using a single intra peritoneal injection of a ketamine (400 mg/kg)/xylazine (80 mg/kg) solution.\nPerfuse the brain transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution.\nDecapitate the rat, dissect out the brain and post-fix it in 4% PFA at 4°C with gentle agitation for 12 h.\nCut the brain coronally and slice it into 50-μm thick sections with a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica).\nCollect the slices containing the brain region of interest (e.g., PVN) in a 12-well plate and perform immunohistochemistry on the free-floating sections.\nBlocking step: incubate the sections in blocking buffer (1×PBS + 1% Triton + 5% normal goat serum (NGS)) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Use 1 mL of blocking buffer per every 4 slices.\nPrimary step: incubate the sections in primary solution (1×PBS + 1% Triton + primary antibodies) for 24–48 h at 4°C (cold room) with gentle agitation.",
    "First washing step: wash the sections in 1×PBS (4 washes, 10 min each) with gentle agitation.\nSecondary step: incubate the sections in secondary solution (1×PBS + 1% Triton + fluorescent secondary antibodies) for 2 h at room temperature, in the dark with gentle agitation.\nSecond washing step: wash the sections in 1×PBS (4 washes, 10 min each) with gentle agitation.\nMounting step: mount the sections on Superfrost Plus (Thermo scientific) microscope glass slides (4 sections per slide), let them dry completely, then cover with glass coverslips (24 × 50 mm, Roth).\nAcquire high-quality images of immunoimmune-stained sections (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and 4H) with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (e.g., Leica TCS SP5).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1283-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
