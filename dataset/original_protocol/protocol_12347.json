    "This study has been approved by the ethics committee of the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe. All animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). For all culture experiments mouse pups ranging from 1 to 7 days of age were used.\n1. Isolation of mTECs from Thymus\nNOTE: The following digestion steps were performed as described previously1 under sterile conditions with some modifications as follows.\nDecapitate the mouse pups and remove the thymus. Place the thymi on ice in a Petri plate containing RPMI 1640 medium (containing 5% FCS).\nCut the thymi into fine, small pieces and place in a round bottom tube with ~5-30 ml RPMI media and gently stir using a magnet for 10 min at RT.\nThereafter, decant the supernatant containing mainly thymocytes and digest the remaining tissue sequentially with one round of collagenase type IV (0.2 mg/ml and 57 U/ml final concentartion) for 15 min each at 37 °C, followed by collagenase/dispase (0.2 mg/ml and 1.2 U/ml final concentration) for 25 min each at 37 °C in a water bath with magnetic stirring until the thymi are completely digested. Use 1 ml enzyme per two to three thymi.\nAgitate the tissue once every 7-10 min with a Pasteur pipette. Pool the collagenase/dispase fractions and filter through a 70 µm gauze.\nEnrich the mTECs by magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Perform the purification of mTECs by magnetic cell sorting as described previously11, and shown in Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: For magnetic sorting of mTECs we used the following antibodies: anti-CD80-PE (16-10A1, use at 1:100 dilution) and anti-EpCAM-bio (G8.8, use at 1:100 dilution)12. Immature and mature mTECs using MACS were defined as: CD45- EpCAM+ CD80- and CD45- CD80+ respectively.",
    "After MACS purification (purity of immature mTECs = 83.1 ± 6.3 % and mature mTECs = 79.23 ± 3.42%), seed the mTECs onto the organotypic cultures as described below (Section 2.3).\nAlternatively, sort mTECs by FACS (using 100 µm nozzle) after CD45 MACS depletion using the following antibodies: anti-CD45-PerCP (30-F11, use at 1:100 dilution), anti-Ly51-FITC (6C3, use at 1:100 dilution), anti-EpCAM-Alexa647 (G8.8, use at 1:500 dilution) and anti-CD80-PE (16-10A1, use at 1:100 dilution). Exclude dead cells using propidium iodide (1:5,000) (Day 4). Immature and mature mTECs using FACS were defined as: PI- CD45- Ly51-EpCAM+ CD80- and PI- CD45- Ly51- EpCAM+ CD80+, respectively.\n2. 3D Organotypic Co-cultures (OTCs)\nNOTE: The 3D-dermal constructs for organotypic cultivation of keratinocytes were prepared as described previously9,13. At all steps cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The OTCs using mTECs were prepared with slight modifications as follows.\nPreparation of Human Fibroblasts\n\tNOTE: The human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from explant cultures of de-epidermised dermis as described previously9.\n\t\nIn brief, cut strips of human skin ( ~5 cm length) and treat with thermolysin (0.5 mg/ml in saline with 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4) O/N at 4 °C.\nThereafter, separate the epidermis from the dermis using forceps.\nFinely cut the dermis into small pieces, place in a 10 cm Petri plate and allow to dry for 1-2 hr under a sterile airflow. Supplement the explants regularly with DMEM containing 20 % FBS.\nSplit the out-growing fibroblasts when confluent (usually around 3 weeks) using 0.1 % trypsin making sure that the explants continue to adhere to the plate for further consecutive rounds of outgrowth.\nExpand the fibroblasts from the same explants for up to 3 times in DMEM with 10 % FBS and cryo-preserve them14. Use the same batch of fibroblasts for each experimental series.",
    "NOTE: The fibroblasts were not irradiated for the set-up of the dermal equivalents.\nPreparation of the Scaffold\n\t\nCut the 0.4-0.6 mm thick viscose, nonwoven fibrous material (product details in supporting excel sheet) into well demarcated circles using a sharp 11 mm diameter metal puncher to exactly fit into 12 well-filter inserts. Then place it into the 12- well filter insert (polyester capillary pore membrane, 3 µm pore size) as a scaffold. Place the complete filter setup into a sterile 12-well plate.\nPrepare the fibrin gel using a fibrin glue-kit for surgery consisting of a combination of fibrinogen and thrombin. Pre-dilute the fibrinogen- as well as the thrombin-component of the kit to 8 mg/ml and 10 units/ml, respectively. For a single well of a 12-well plate proceed as follows.\n\t\t\nDilute 100 µl fibrinogen (8 mg/ml) with 100 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+, pH 7.0. Dilute 100 µl thrombin (10 units/ml) with 100 µl FCS containing 270,000 fibroblasts.\nDispense 200 µl of the thrombin containing fibroblasts cell-mix onto the scaffold, to which add 200 µl fibrinogen (1:1 mixture), resulting in a final concentration of fibrinogen of 2 mg/ml and of thrombin of 2.5 units/ml. Mix well and distribute evenly over the whole area of the scaffold by gentle pipetting (Day 1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: After 30 min at 37 °C a clot enclosing the fibroblasts will have formed, filling completely the internal spaces of the scaffold and forming a smooth upper surface.\nCo-culture with mTECs\n\t\nFor pre-culture, submerse the organ cultures in DMEM with 10 % FBS, 50 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid and 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 with a medium change every other day for 4-5 days.",
    "On the day of mTEC seeding, replace the medium by rFAD medium (1:1 DMEM + DMEM/F12) with 10% FBS, 10-10 M cholera toxin, 0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid, RANK ligand (0.1 μg/ml) and 500 units/ml of Aprotinin, thus preventing precocious fibrinolysis by serine proteases secreted by fibroblasts.\n7-8 hr later, set-up the co-cultures by seeding 250,000 mTECs (either complete mTECs, or CD80lo and CD80hi subsets), in a volume of 100 µl per well on top of the fibroblast scaffold. Count the cells using a Neubauer chamber (Day 4).\n\t\tNOTE: At all times the thymus 3D organotypic cultures are submersed in media unlike skin OTCs which are air-lifted.\nAfter 24 hr incubation, supply the cultures with medium (total medium exchange) as mentioned above (step 2.3.2) now containing reduced amounts of Aprotinin, 250 units/ml (Day 5).\nIn order to assess the proliferative activity of mTECs, add EdU (6.7 µM/ml, i.e., 10 µM/well) to OTCs for 4 hr before termination of the cultures. Perform the staining of OTC cryo-sections as described in the EdU Imaging Kit combined with co-staining of keratin 14. Determine the proliferative indices of mTECs, by either counting the K14+ EdU+ cells in two sections of each culture specimen or by flow cytometry (EdU flow cytometry, Section 1.7 but instead of Ly51-FITC use CDR1-PB15 at a 1:100 dilution and 2.3.6.4).\nFollowing 4-7 days of co-culture, terminate the OTCs and process for RNA isolation, cryo-sectioning or FACS analysis (Day 8-11).\n\t\t\nTerminate the cultures using a forceps, separating the scaffold/dermal equivalent from the filter of the well insert.",
    "For cryo-sectioning, embed the entire OTC in OCT compound and freeze in liquid nitrogen vapor before cryo-sectioning. Prepare 5-7 µm thick OTC sections using a cryostat and store at -20 °C until use. For immuno-histochemistry of cryo-sectioned OTCs use anti-keratin 14 (AF64, use at 1:1,000 dilution), and anti-vimentin (GP53, use at 1:100 dilution) antibodies. Perform the indirect immuno-histochemistry staining using respective secondary antibodies.\nFor RNA isolation, add 1 ml Denaturing solution (containing phenol and guanidinium thiocyanate) in a screw cap of a 2 ml RNase free tube. Cut the entire OTC into pieces with a scalpel and add into the tube containing denaturing solution. Mechanically shred the OTCs with FastPrep instrument twice for 30 sec at a speed of 6.0, place in between on ice for 2 min (the sample can be stored at -80 °C after this point). If frozen at -80 °C, thaw on ice. Centrifuge the tubes at 11,500-13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, incubate for 5 min at RT and follow RNA isolation protocols using Acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction as described by the manufacturer.\nFor FACS analysis, remove the scaffold and separate the membrane from the fibrin/fibroblast/mTEC gel. Finely cut the gel with a scalpel and digest it in a FACS tube for ~20 min or until completely digested with 2 ml of collagenase/dispase at 37 °C in a water bath with magnetic stirring. Agitate the enzyme solution with a Pasteur pipette once every 5 min. After complete digestion, filter the cell suspension through a 70 µm filter; stain the single cell suspension using the antibodies as described in 1.7 and analyze by flow cytometry.\nSubscription Required.
