    "For the porphyrin extraction (adapted from Nakayashiki and Inokuchi, 1997) Culture bacterial cells until a final cell suspension equivalent to 100 ml with an A600 of 0.4.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 7,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min and wash the pellet in 20 ml pre-chilled 0.05 M Tris pH 8.2-2 mM EDTA.Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of the same buffer.Measure the A600 of the culture suspension and adjust to equalize the A600 of each sample by adding Tris-EDTA buffer.Spin down cells at 7,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Resuspend the cell pellets in 1 ml ethyl acetate/acetic acid (3:1, v/v).Lyse the cells by sonication for 2 min with power 3 on ice.Remove the cell debris by centrifugation at 7,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min and then transfer supernatant to a fresh tube.Add 1 ml H2O, vortex, and centrifuge at 7,000 x g for 5 min. Remove and discard the aqueous top layer.Repeat step 8.Add 100 µl of 3 M HCl to solubilize the porphyrins.Centrifuge after vigorous vortexing before transferring upper layer containing the water-soluble porphyrins into a fresh Eppendorf tube.For the LC/MS/MS analysis Perform the LC separation with Zorbax SB-Aq column.Use 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase B.Use a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.Perform a stepwise elution as follows: 0-1 min 100% A, then gradually decrease down to 5% A until min 10. Maintain 5% A until min 18 and then increase to 100% A until min 19. Maintain 100% A until the end (min 24).Set the autosampler at 5 °C.Inject sample (1 μl) from step 11 above.Acquire the mass spectra with positive electrospray ionization (ESI) with the ion spray voltage set at 5,500 V.",
    "Set the source temperature at 450 °C.Set the curtain gas, ion source gas 1, and ion source gas 2 at 32, 65, and 50, respectively.Use multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) to monitor coproporphyrin III (m/z 655.4 --> m/z 596.3) and protoporphyrin IX (m/z 563.2 -->  m/z 504.1). Use 1 µg of the porphyrin standards for the initial tests.Measure the peak areas of the resulting chromatograms with Analyst 1.6. Note that this is a qualitative assessment. A standard curve using the corresponding porphyrin references is required to obtain absolute values."
