    "All animal experiments were performed according to the 'Principles of laboratory animal care' as well as to the current version of the German Law on the Protection of Animals.\n1. Preparation of Antisense-Morpholino (MO)\nTo prepare a 3 mM MO stock solution, add 100 µl of sterile, ultrapure water to the lyophilized MO (300 nmol in glass vial). For complete dissolution, heat the stock solution to 65 °C for 5 min. Seal the vial with Parafilm and store the MO stock solution at room temperature (RT). Do not chill the MO stock solution because that could cause an association of the MO with the vial walls.\nPrepare a 1 mM MO working solution by diluting the MO stock solution with sterile, ultrapure water and add 0.5% phenol red solution to a final concentration of 0.05%.\n\t\nTo get 10 µl of a MO working solution, add 3.3 µl MO stock solution and 1 µl of 0.5% phenol-red solution to 5.7 µl water. Before preparing a new batch of working solution heat the MO stock solution to 65 °C for 5 min.\nPrior to use, centrifuge the MO working solution to prevent needle clogging. For example, spin 10 µl of MO stock solution at 15,000 x g for 5 min (RT) and remove 8 µl of the supernatant for injection.\n\tNOTE: Loss of activity may occur in morpholino solutions over time 11. To exclude this, one can test the solutions by UV spectrometry following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. In case of the used wt1a morpholino a reduced effectiveness has not been observed over a long period of storage (3 mM working solution was stored longer than one year).\n2. Setting Up Mating Pairs and Collection of Fertilized Eggs",
    "The afternoon prior to microinjection, set up five pairs of the Tg (wt1b: GFP) line, each in a breeding container equipped with a removable sieve to separate males and females during night.\n\tNOTE: To ensure that enough eggs are available for a successful injection experiment, fish used as mating pairs should have been pre-screened and evaluated as good \"producers\".\nThe next morning, after the lights turn on, put the male and female together above the sieve that prevents the fish from eating up their eggs.\nWatch the spawning. Once an amount of eggs are laid that can be injected before the 4-cell stage is reached (approximately 50), separate male from female again. Transfer the eggs with a Pasteur pipette into a petri dish filled with embryo water for a first round of injection. To get additional rounds of eggs, place a mating pair together and separate several times.\n3. Preparatory Work for Microinjection\nNOTE: Perform steps 3.1 and 3.2 in advance.\nTo prepare a dish that holds the embryos in position during the injection (microinjection dish) insert a glass slide at a 40-45° angle into a 94 mm Petri dish filled with liquid, transparent, pure, food grade silicon. Remove the slide when the silicon is hardened. That produces a groove in the silicon layer.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use 1.5-3% agarose instead of silicon and store the dish at 4 °C.\nGenerate injection needles from glass capillaries with a needle puller.\n\t\nUse capillaries that contain internal filaments.\n\t\tNOTE: The filament will help to transport the MO solution toward the tip of the needle after backfilling (see 3.3).",
    "Establish appropriate settings on the needle puller. Good needles for injection into zebrafish should have long and thin tips 12. Generate tips with a length of approximately 10 mm and a diameter of 1.5-2 µm at their very end. For example, use a horizontal needle puller with following settings: Heat = 330, Pull = 0, Velocity = 40, Time = 100.\nExamine the quality of the needles under a dissecting microscope and sort out those with short or too long tips.\n\t\tNOTE: Needles with short tips tend to damage the embryo while such with very long and thin tips bend when touching the chorion and do not penetrate it.\nBackfill the needle with 2 µl of MO working solution by using a microloader tip and insert it into the needle holder of the microinjection apparatus.\nAs the needles are closed at the tip end, generate an opening by pinching back the very end of the needle with sharp tweezers under the dissection microscope. Alternatively use the microinjection apparatus to gently push the tip to a rigid surface (e.g. small metal block or back of tweezers).\nCalibrate the injection volume by injecting the MO working solution into a drop of mineral oil placed on a graticule. Adjust the duration of injection for producing a drop diameter of 75 µm to obtain an injection volume of approximately 200 pl.\n4. Microinjection Procedure\nArrange the 1-cell stage embryos along the groove of the microinjection dish with the vegetal pole toward the direction from where the needle comes (toward the 45° angle of the groove).\nPerforate the chorion and the yolk with the needle and inject 200 pl of the 1 mM MO working solution (0.2 pmol) into the yolk of 1- to 2-cell embryos.",
    "Using a Pasteur pipette with a wide opening, collect all of the injected embryos in a Petri dish filled with embryo water and incubate them at 28.5 °C.\nIn the afternoon, remove dead embryos by using a Pasteur pipette with a wide opening and replace the embryo water.\n5. Preparation of Embryos for In Vivo Imaging\nThe next morning, replace the embryo water with embryo water containing 0.003% N-phenylthiourea (PTU) to inhibit melanization. Do not apply PTU before the end of gastrulation because it interferes with early embryonic development.\n\tCAUTION: PTU is toxic and teratogenic. Wear gloves at all times and avoid inhalation and contact with skin.\nDechorionate the embryos with sharp tweezers under a dissection microscope at the desired developmental stage. Grab the chorion with one pair of tweezers and try to grab the other side of the chorion with a second pair of tweezers. Carefully pull the tweezers in opposite directions without disrupting the embryo.\nAnesthetize the embryo by replacing the embryo water containing PTU (0.003%) with embryo water containing PTU (0.003%) and 0.02% Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (Tricaine).\nEmbed the embryo in low melting agarose on a coverglass-bottomed µ-dish with a 50 µm relocation grid. Proper embedding requires some practice.\n\t\nPrepare 1 ml aliquots of 0.7% agarose in 1.5 ml reaction tubes and put them on a heat block set to 36 °C. Use a Pasteur pipette with wide opening to transfer the embryo to the µ-dish. Remove excess embryo water using a Pasteur pipette with ultra-thin tip and overlay the embryo with tempered agarose.",
    "While the agarose is still liquid, orient the embryo with two gel loader tips in the desired position, with regard to the structure of interest as well as the distance to the relocation grid. Place the structure of interest (here the pronephros) as close as possible to the glass bottom (here: dorsal down) and in close vicinity to the grid.\nFor optimal image quality minimize the agarose layer between the embryo and the glass bottom by placing the structure of interest of the embryo as close as possible to the bottom. Besides that, locate the embryo in close vicinity to the grid but take care that the grid will not overlay with the structure of interest. Embed 3-4 embryos in different µ-dishes each and use the one that is positioned best.\nWhen the agarose is hard enough to hold the embryo wait for 2-3 min and overlay the embedded embryo with embryo water containing 0.003% PTU and 0.02% Tricaine. Decant the excess embryo water or remove it by using a Pasteur pipette with ultra-thin tip. Close the lid of the µ-dish at the lock position to prevent evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid the occurrence of air bubbles in the µ-dish, as they would impair image recording.\n6. Microscopy\nNOTE: Use a microscope equipped for optical sectioning via structured illumination. Record images with a software containing the following modules: Multichannel, Z-Stack, Time Series, Software Autofocus and Extended Focus.\nAcquisition of Z-stacks\nInvert the µ-dish. The glass bottom now faces toward the objective and the µ-dish serves as an imaging chamber.\nToggle the slider into the grid position and enable the structured illumination mode in the software controls.\nCalibrate the grid focus for the channel(s) of choice with the specimen to be examined (embedded embryo) by following the instructions of the Focus Calibration Wizard.",
    "Activate the z-Stack acquisition mode and set it to center mode. Focus into the middle of the specimen and set it as the center plane of the z- stack by clicking Center. Set the dimension of the z-stack by defining the range around the center position.\n\t\tNOTE: Object structures should not be seen sharply outside the first and the last plane of the z-stack.\nAdjust the spacing between optical sections. For best z-resolution click the Optimal button. Based on the objectives depth of field the software will set a recommended distance following the Nyquist criterium (50% overlap).\n\t\tNOTE: If aiming for smaller file sizes and the structure permits, set a larger spacing size manually. Setting smaller steps than recommended will merely result in larger file sizes without increasing lateral information.\nTime-lapse Imaging\nOpen the Time Series tool and set the interval of the time series experiment. For example record z-stack images every 30 min over a period of 5 hr.\nTo correct for focal drift over time, set up an autofocus strategy. Check the Focus Strategy dialogue box, select Software Autofocus from the drop-down list and choose the TL-Brightfield channel as reference channel.\nStart each time point with the autofocus. In order to assure a reliable search range within an optimized time frame, set a fixed 200 µm relative search range. This range is fully scanned (Range Coverage parameter) with basic quality (Quality parameter) in a maximum step size (Sampling parameter).\nTo increase precision of the autofocus, activate the metering within a focus region of interest (focus ROI) and position said focus ROI in the live view window around the structure of interest.",
    "NOTE: If the system lacks the Software Autofocus module which updates the center z-position automatically during time-lapse recording, pause the experiment at a given time and adjust the focus manually and continue the experiment.\nTo compensate for a potential xy-drift during time series recording, position a particular point of the imprinted grid (of the imaging chamber) into the crosshairs of the software and save the positioning by making a screenshot.\nStart the time series experiment. Before the time series interval is over, pause the experiment and, if necessary, re-adjust positioning according to the screenshot. Continue with the experiment.\n7. Image Processing\nSwitch to the processing tab and select the Extended Depth of Focus (EDF) in the Method dialogue box. Since optical sections are acquired, apply the Maximum Projection algorithm to the image series.\n\tNOTE: Here the algorithm will project the brightest or the darkest pixel from stack to a composite 2D image in a first step and eventually use the one with the highest variance as a result image for each time point.\nUse the Movie Export method to create a time lapse movie (e.g. avi or move file) out of the EDF image series."
