    "NOTE: Ensure that all work is performed at room temperature in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood. All ‘drops’ in this protocol are defined as 5–20 µL, depending on the operator’s preference.\n1. Initial Setup\nAllow female whiteflies to oviposit on clean leaves. Examples for oviposition arenas include clip cages or leaves cut to fit on agar in a Petri dish. Make a coverable hole in the clip cage or Petri dish cover to insert and remove the adults. Alternatively, quickly put a vessel of collected adults on ice and, then, deposit them on the leaf. Limit the time between oviposition and egg fixation to no more than 60 min, to ensure the observation of the sperm transition into the paternal pronucleus in eggs.\nNOTE: Eggs not removed from the leaf can be reared to adulthood to record adult sex ratios.\nBefore or during whitefly oviposition, prepare a microscope slide by cleaning it with soap and water, drying it well, and then stretching a piece of paraffin film over one end, making sure the paraffin film surface does not break (Figure 1).\nNOTE: The paraffin film is hydrophobic and semi-opaque, allowing liquids to form drops and eggs to be more easily seen.\n2. Dechorionation\nWith a glass Pasteur pipette, add drops of bleach solution (0.83% sodium hypochlorite) to the paraffin film.\nNOTE: It is easier to keep track of eggs if only 2–3 eggs are in each drop. Alternatively, to manage a large egg number, collect the eggs in drops of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCAUTION: Bleach is corrosive; wear gloves when handling bleach and do not inhale.\nRemove the adult whiteflies from the leaf.",
    "Place the leaf under a microscope to see the eggs clearly and collect the eggs singly and carefully with a thin probe. To make a probe, insert a minuten nadel pin at 45° or at a comfortable working angle into a melted pipette tip (Figure 2).\nTransfer the eggs to bleach or 1x PBS. If using 1x PBS, remove the 1x PBS with a glass Pasteur pipette once all the eggs are collected and, then, add bleach to the eggs.\nNOTE: When collecting eggs, slowly lift the egg from its base until the pedicel is removed from the leaf. The pedicel is sticky, and the egg will commonly stick to the probe tip until it is dipped into the bleach.\nNOTE: It is recommended to use separate glass Pasteur pipettes for all reagents, and the pipettes may be modified with heat to make the tips narrower and reduce the risk of accidentally aspirating whitefly eggs. To prevent residue and contamination, clean the pipettes with deionized water after every use.\nWait for 10 min. If there is an interest in embryogenesis in eggs older than 1 h, leave the eggs in bleach for up to 15 min.\nNOTE: For eggs that are up to 1 h old, 10 min is sufficient.\n3. Fixation\nNOTE: These steps are taken from a Hymenopteran protocol17.\nRemove the bleach (containing the chorion fragments) with a glass Pasteur pipette and discard it. Add drops of glacial acetic acid with a glass Pasteur pipette and wait 3 min.\nCAUTION: Proceed with this step under a fume hood. Glacial acetic acid is corrosive; wear gloves when handling glacial acetic acid and do not inhale, especially in combination with the residual bleach.",
    "Remove the glacial acetic acid with a glass Pasteur pipette and add drops of Clarke’s solution (3:1 of absolute ethanol:glacial acetic acid) with a glass Pasteur pipette. Wait until most of the solution has evaporated (or 10 min max).\nAdd drops of 70% ethanol to the eggs with a glass Pasteur pipette and wait until most of the ethanol has evaporated (or 10 min max).\n4. Staining\nRemove any residual ethanol with a glass Pasteur pipette and add drops of 1x PBS to the eggs with a glass Pasteur pipette to get the pH close to 7.0. Set the microscope slide in a humidity chamber to prevent desiccation, for example, in an empty pipette tip box with a wet paper towel inside (Figure 3). Wait at least 30 min.\nNOTE: This is the best point if a pause is needed, as long as the humidity chamber can prevent desiccation.\nRemove the 1x PBS with a glass Pasteur pipette, and add drops of 0.1 μg/mL DAPI, a DNA fluorescent stain, with a glass Pasteur pipette. Set the microscope slide in a dark humidity chamber and wait at least 15 min.\nCAUTION: DAPI is an irritant, so handle it with gloves.\n5. Washing\nRemove the DAPI with a glass Pasteur pipette.\nAdd drops of 1x TBST (5x solution made from 30 g of Tris, 43.8 g of NaCl, 5 mL of polysorbate 20, and 1.0 g of NaN3 [pH 7.5], and brought to 1 L with PCR grade water) to the eggs with a glass Pasteur pipette. Wait 5 min before removing the 1x TBST with a glass Pasteur pipette. Repeat this step 2 times.\n6. Mounting",
    "After the final wash, carefully pipette all the eggs from the paraffin film onto a clean part of the microscope slide. Remove excess 1x TBST; then, add 20 µL of mounting media (80% glycerol and 20% 1x TBST with 2% n-propyl-gallate) and place a clean cover slide on top of the eggs.\nFor long-term storage, seal the cover slide with clear nail polish and, then, either store the slide in the dark at 2 °C or immediately view it under a fluorescent microscope.\nSubscription Required.
