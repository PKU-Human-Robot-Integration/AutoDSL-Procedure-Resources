    "The experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines for the National Care and Use of Animals and the experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n1. Animal Habituation\nObtain male adult rats from animal laboratory and maintain them under a 12 h light/dark cycle (light on from 7:00 to 19:00) with free access to food and water.\nHandle the animals by playing with them or patting them twice per day for two weeks before the experiments.\nRandomly assign animals into saline or morphine groups.\n2. Drug Preparation\nPrepare morphine hydrochloride as 10 mg/mL and inject rats intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a volume of 1 mL/kg.\nAs a control, inject rats with saline at a volume of 1 mL/kg.\n3. CPP Apparatus\nConstruct a three-chamber CPP apparatus with different tactile (floor) cues and test rats' initial preference to two side chambers. The apparatus consists of two large black side chambers (30 cm × 25 cm × 30 cm, L×W×H) and one middle white chamber (11 cm × 25 cm × 30 cm, L×W×H) with white smooth PVC floor. The two side chambers have different floor textures as somatosensory cues: one with a grid plexiglass floor, the other with a rough PVC floor.\nVary the combination of tactile cues to make sure that the apparatus is unbiased, since a biased apparatus is susceptible to yielding false positive results4.\n\tNOTE: An important methodological issue in the design of the CPP apparatus is whether the apparatus is \"biased\" or \"unbiased\"4. If one group of untrained rats shows no initial preference for one side chamber over another, the apparatus is considered \"unbiased\". Otherwise, consider it as \"biased\"13.\n4. CPP Procedure",
    "Establish the morphine-induced CPP paradigm mainly according to previous studies21,22 with modification of conditioning time points, number of conditioning sessions, conditioning trial period and testing time points20. A short description is given below, of which the experimental schedule is depicted in Figure 1.\nPre-conditioning phase\n\t\nDuring this phase (day 1 to 3), remove guillotine doors to allow free access to the entire apparatus and place the animal in the middle chamber.\nRecord the activity of the animals for 15 min.\nCalculate the time spent in the two side chambers on day 3 as the baseline and refer this as T0.\nRemove rats that enter less than -four times to either of the side chambers from the experiment23 as these rats are likely to have problems in general well-being (e.g., dirty fur and having tumors). Check the health state of the animals during the whole experimental period.\nConditioning phase\n\tNOTE: Conditioning phase includes 6 days (day 4 to 9).\n\t\nFor morphine-conditioned subjects, inject rats i.p. with morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline (1 mL/kg) alternately in the morning (9:00) and evening (19:00) sessions (10 h apart).\nConfine rats immediately after each injection to its drug-paired (non-preferred) or saline-paired (preferred) chamber for 45 min (Figure 1B).\nKeep the video recording system on.\n\t\tNOTE: According to our experience, around 5% of rats have the respiratory depression after the first injection of morphine (10 mg/kg). In such a case, to increase the survival rate of respiratory depressed rats, get the rat out of the conditioning chamber, pull its tongue out and put it on a white tissue paper in its home cage.",
    "For saline-conditioned controls, give rats saline injections (1 mL/kg) prior to exposure to one side chamber of the CPP apparatus during the morning session and to the other side during the evening session for 45 min/session in line with morphine group (Figure 1C).\nTesting phase\n\t\nDuring this phase, remove guillotine doors to allow free access to the entire apparatus and place the animal in the middle chamber to let them freely explore the whole apparatus for 15 min.\nRecord their activity during this 15 min.\nCarry out three post-conditioning tests, i.e., test 1 (T1), test 2 (T2) and test 3 (T3), 2 days, 10 days and 18 days after the last conditioning session in a morphine-free state, respectively (Figure 1A).\nVary testing time points for different experimental goals.\n\t\tNOTE: To minimize the number of rats required, a within-subject design is employed. However, to exclude the extinction effect, a between subject design is required.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58384/58384fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental procedures.

Data Analysis\nCalculate the CPP score in morphine(saline) group as: CPP score = the time spent in the drug-paired (non-preferred) chamber/ the total time spent in both conditioning chambers.\nPerform data analysis of CPP scores and entrances to side chambers with appropriate statistical methods using SPSS.\nPresent all behavioral data as mean ± SEM, where SEM is the standard error of mean. Consider values of p<0.05 as statistically significant and indicate by asterisks (*) and octothorpesin (#) in the figures."
