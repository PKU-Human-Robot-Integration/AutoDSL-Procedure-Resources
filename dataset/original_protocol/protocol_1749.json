    "In this section, you construct a cDNA library from the input substrates (“human pri-miRNA substrates” that are not incubated with the Microprocessor). This part is based on a protocol modified from the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit using custom RT & PCR primers. This library is used to measure the processing efficiency of individual pri-miRNAs by comparing the amounts of input substrates and cleavage products obtained from the cDNA library of processing products. Of note, the custom primers have 1–3 internal degenerate bases to increase nucleotide diversity during sequencing by synthesis (SBS) step in Illumina sequencing platform (see https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/07/what-is-nucleotide-diversity-and-why-is-it-important.html[href=https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/07/what-is-nucleotide-diversity-and-why-is-it-important.html]).\nNote: You can perform the experiments in this section parallel with the RT reaction (step 154) in the section \"construction of cDNA library from processing products[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5].\"\nPerform reverse transcription reaction using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nMix the following reagents.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1338_25.csv\nIncubate the mixture in a thermocycler at 65°C for 5 min.\nImmediately place the tube on ice and rest for 3 min.\nAdd the following reagents to the mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1338_26.csv\nIncubate the mixture in a thermocycler at 55°C for 1 h and then 70°C for 15 min (\"cDNA; input substrates\").\nPerform PCR to generate cDNA library for Illumina sequencing.\nUse half of the cDNA (10 μL).\nPCR mixture (1× scale reaction; 50 μL)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1338_27.csv\nPCR cycling conditions\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1338_28.csv\nTransfer the PCR products to a fresh 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 150 μL of TDW, 1 mL of 100% EtOH, 20 μL of 3 M NaOAc, and 1 μL of GlycoBlue coprecipitant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the 50 μL PCR reaction.\nStore the tube at −80°C for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 20,000×g, 4°C for 30 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet twice using 1 mL of 75% EtOH.",
