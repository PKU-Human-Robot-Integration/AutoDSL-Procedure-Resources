  "procedures": [
    "The mouse is the most commonly utilized animal model in hearing research, mainly due to the readily available mouse genome sequence data, the ability to generate transgenic mice, and the relative similarity to the human cochlea (Santi, Rapson, & Voie, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0020]). The detection of proteins in mouse cochlear sections has, therefore, remained an essential technique in inner ear research. Unfortunately, a high staining background results when using methods for indirect detection of murine proteins with primary antibodies raised in a mouse. This phenomenon has been termed the “mouse-on-mouse” background. It results from the binding of the anti-mouse secondary antibodies by the (Fc) and antigen-binding (Fab) fragments of the native mouse tissue immunoglobulin (Lu & Partridge, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0010]). When using the indirect detection methods, the anti-mouse secondary antibody cannot distinguish the exogenous mouse primary antibodies from the native mouse immunoglobulins. This non-specific binding results in a high background signal that can obscure antigen detection, especially when labeling proteins in the cell membrane or extracellular matrix.",
    "Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies are widely used in immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining of murine tissues, and several techniques were developed to eliminate the “mouse-on-mouse” background, such as using directly labeled antibodies (Hierck, Iperen, Gittenberger-De Groot, & Poelmann, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0008]; Tse & Goldfarb, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0021]), or blocking with Fab fragments (Nielsen, Borup-Christensen, Erb, Jensenius, & Husby, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0013]; Yamashita & Korach, 1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0023]). Numerous commercial staining kits have also been made available to detect mouse proteins using primary mouse antibodies. Unfortunately, no blocking method has been universally agreed upon, since the blocking protocol has to be optimized for each application. Indeed, previous studies have shown the “mouse-on-mouse” background to be tissue-specific, suggesting that immunolabeling protocols need to be adjusted for each tissue type (Lu & Partridge, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0010]). The latter finding indicates that immunohistochemistry protocols, established on other mouse tissue types, may not always be appropriate to use on murine cochlear sections. Recent histological and ultrastructural studies have shown that a significant portion of the membranous cochlea is acellular and consists of extracellular matrix proteins (Santi & Johnson, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0019]; Santi et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0018]). Thus, the problem of “mouse-on-mouse” background becomes especially challenging when performing cochlear immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.\nHere, we describe a simple double-blocking immunofluorescence protocol to label mouse cochlear cryosections, which virtually eliminates the “mouse-on-mouse” background. The protocol contains a conventional blocking step with serum, and an additional blocking step with a commercially available anti-mouse-IgG blocking reagent. This technique has been successfully used in recent work for protein detection in the murine cochlear cryosections (Bassiouni, Dos Santos, Avci, Lowenheim, & Muller, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0003]). It significantly reduces the “mouse-on-mouse” background in murine cochlear sections while increasing only slightly the duration of the protocol.\nMaterials\nMice\n2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-rec-0005])\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-rec-0006]), 1× Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-rec-0003])\n30% sucrose (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-rec-0003])",

Refer to previously published protocols and video tutorials for the technique of harvesting and processing inner ear tissue (Akil & Lustig, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0001]; Bako et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0002]; Fang, Wu, Chai, & Sha, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0005]; Haque, Pandey, Kelley, & Puligilla, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0007]; Landegger, Dilwali, & Stankovic, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0009]; Montgomery & Cox, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0011]; Mulvaney & Dabdoub, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0012]; Ogier, Burt, Drury, Lim, & Nayagam, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0014]; Parker, Brugeaud, & Edge, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0015]; Tung, Di Marco, Lim, Brichta, & Camp, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0022]).\"\n5-6,Poor antigenicity with good morphological preservation,Consider reducing tissue fixation or perform antigen retrieval .",
    "5-6,\"Poor morphological preservation (e.g., degeneration of the organ of Corti or stria vascularis)\",Consider stronger tissue fixation or better perfusion of the perilymphatic space with the fixative (in adult cochleae).\n9,\"Fine morphology suboptimal (e.g., tears in the Reissner's membrane)\",\"Instead of a single dehydration step with 30% sucrose, the specimens can be submerged in serial dilutions of sucrose for 1 hr of each step (5%, 10%, 20%, and then 30% sucrose) at RT, after which, the specimens are incubated overnight at 4°C. This serial dehydration is not necessary for embryonic and postnatal samples and may provide better morphological preservation only in the ossified fluid-filled adult cochlea.\"\n15-20,Blurry morphology (tissue sections too thick),Reduce slice thickness during cryosectioning. Excellent morphology can be obtained with 10-12-µm thick sections.\n15-20,Sectioning artifacts (cuts and tears),\"Change the cutting blade and the glass cover. If sectioning artifacts still persist, consider increasing the slice thickness.\"\n26,Sections washing off during antigen retrieval,\"Adult cochlear sections tend to be washed out from the slides during the heat-induced antigen retrieval. One solution to this problem is to apply mechanical compression to the coverslipped slide during the antigen retrieval procedure, as described recently (Eckhard, O'Malley, Nadol, & Adams, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-bib-0004]).\"\n26,Hydrophobic pen barrier washing out after antigen retrieval,\"Using a surfactant such as Triton X-100 and the antigen retrieval may wash off the hydrophobic barrier around the sections. In such case, apply the hydrophobic pen again, before proceeding to the blocking step.\"\n28-37,Specific antibody signal too weak (with otherwise good antigenicity),\"Decrease the dilution of the primary and/or secondary antibody (i.e., higher concentration). Consider antigen retrieval.\"",
    "28-37,High fluorescence background,\"Perform control experiments to determine the source of background. Mouse-on-mouse background shows a consistent pattern in the cochlea (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-fig-0005]), which should not be mistaken for non-specific binding. According to the underlying cause of the background, either increase the dilution of the secondary antibody or optimize blocking. Old secondary antibodies tend to aggregate and form precipitates, which may lead to high non-specific fluorescence. In this case, researchers may try centrifuging the antibody and recovering the supernatant. Otherwise, use a new lot of the antibody (or a new, unused frozen aliquot).\"\n28-37,High mouse-on-mouse background,\"Usually, the double-blocking protocol strongly reduces the mouse-on-mouse background, which practically eliminates the problem for most antibody staining. If there is still a high mouse-on-mouse background after double-blocking, this usually means that the primary antibody signal is weak, since it shows a similar brightness to the mouse-on-mouse background. In this case, it may help to increase the concentration of the primary antibody or to perform antigen retrieval.\"\n28-37,Sections dry out during the protocol,\"The slides should be incubated with a wet tissue paper in a humidified chamber. If sections frequently dry out, consider adding more antibody solution to each slide, to sufficiently immerse the slides. The only disadvantage to adding more solution is the cost of the antibodies. Ideally, a slide should be covered with at least 100 µl, and preferably 200 µl of the antibody solution.\"\n2b. Transfer the isolated inner ear samples into a culture dish with a pre-chilled 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA solution).\n3b. Puncture the bony otic capsule at the cochlear apex in the region of the helicotrema, with fine forceps, to allow the drainage of the perilymph from the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani.",
    "4b. Open the oval window by removing the footplate of the stapes, and then open the round window by perforating the round window membrane with a pair of sharp forceps. (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-fig-0001])\n5b. Perfuse the perilymphatic fluid spaces slowly with cold 2% PFA through the round and oval windows using a thin (27-G) needle syringe. Proceed to step 6.\n6. Transfer the separated half-heads (animals p0-p7) or isolated inner ears (animals older than p7) into a 50-ml Falcon tube filled with paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% solution for 2 hr at 4°C for tissue fixation.\n7. Rinse the specimens at room temperature (RT) three times, each time in a 50-ml Falcon tube filled with 50 ml of 1× PBS for 2 min.\n8. Decalcify the bony inner ear specimens of juvenile and adult mice (starting from p7) in 10% (w/v) EDTA in 1× PBS for 24 hr at 4°C.\nCheck the degree of decalcification by holding the semicircular canal with a pair of forceps. If sufficiently decalcified, the specimens should be soft to touch, such that the semicircular canals are gently compressible with the forceps. If not sufficiently decalcified, the inner ear specimens could be left in 10% EDTA in 1× PBS (at 4°C) for an additional day (total of 48 hr).\n9. Dehydrate the specimens in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C, or until the specimens sink.\nDay 2: Cryoembedding\n10. Fill the cryomolds with the OCT medium (e.g., PolyFreeze cryoembedding medium), and transfer the specimens into the filled cryomolds.\n         \nOrient the early postnatal half-head specimens, with the head (or half-head) lying horizontally flat on the bottom of the mold (resembling an axial cut). Usually, the postnatal heads (or half-heads) can be oriented by eye without the need for a microscope.",
    "Orient the adult inner ear specimens lying horizontally flat on the bottom of the mold, with the cochlear nerve facing down, such that the modiolus is mostly parallel to the surface of the mold. This orientation facilitates obtaining “mid-modiolar” sections during cryosectioning. Since the adult inner ear specimens are rather small, they should be placed in the correct orientation under the microscope.\n11. Remove air bubbles manually with a pair of forceps. Alternatively, use vacuuming devices to remove the air bubbles. In our experience, the vacuuming step is not essential, especially not with the early postnatal (p0-p7) specimens.\n12. Allow the specimen to settle in the OCT medium for 3-5 min at RT before freezing them. This step is crucial in the fluid-filled cochlea of adult animals.\n13. Place the cryomolds at −80°C, where they can be stored for several months to years.\nDay 3: Cryosectioning and immunostaining\n14. Place the cryomolds in the cryostat for 30 min to adapt to the chamber temperature.\n15. Adjust the chamber temperature to the desired temperature for each experiment\nThe ideal temperature should be adjusted depending on the tissue type, consistency, and slice thickness. We recommend a chamber temperature of −28°C for sectioning tissue blocks with mouse half-heads or isolated adult inner ears.",
    "16. Remove the tissue blocks from the cryomolds by holding the sides of the molds while applying finger pressure from below the molds until the tissue blocks slip out. Apply OCT medium on the metal chucks, which fit into the fixed cooling units of the cryostat (only one tissue block can be placed on one chuck and processed at one time). This semisolid OCT medium acts as a “glue” to fix the tissue blocks onto the metal chucks. Quickly place the tissue block on the chuck before it freezes. After this extra “OCT glue” gets completely frozen, the tissue block should be firmly fixed to the metal chucks.\n17. Proceed to section the block in a usual fashion, which may differ according to the cryostat being used. Typically, razor blades are used to trim excess OCT medium from the tissue blocks, and paintbrushes are used to scrape away excess OCT residues.\n18. Start sectioning from the upper part of the half-head specimen by cutting “empty sections” containing only OCT medium (without any tissue) first.\n19. Keep adjusting the sectioning conditions until homogeneous slices without cracks or tears are obtained, and then continue cutting (and discarding) thick sections in a “trim” mode, until reaching the eye, which can be easily macroscopically identified in the tissue block. The eye is positioned slightly higher than the cochlea; thus, it can serve as an orientation point for the position of the cochlea (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-fig-0002]). After reaching the eye, it is advisable to cut thin sections (12 µm) and examine them under a light microscope, until you have “usable” cochlear sections.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d4be2f9-c901-4167-9643-cad517ad9967/cpmo84-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Schematic illustration of the orientation of the tissue blocks for cryosectioning. The mouse half-heads are placed horizontally flat on the bottom of the cryomolds. The cryosectioning proceeds in a transverse plane (dotted lines) parallel to the surface of the tissue blocks. The cryosectioning is started from the upper part of the half-head specimen by cutting “empty sections” containing only OCT medium (without any tissue). The researcher should proceed with cutting (and discarding) thick sections in a “trim” mode until reaching the eye, which can be easily macroscopically identified in the tissue block. The eye is positioned slightly higher than the cochlea; thus, it serves as an orientation point for the position of the cochlea. Once the eye is reached, proceed by cutting and collecting thinner sections (12 µm).\n20. To collect a section onto the microscope slide, gently touch the room-temperature SuperFrost Plus™ slides to the frozen sections, allowing the tissue to stick to the slides. Each slide may hold three to five tissue slices (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-fig-0003]). In this manner, one mouse cochlea is usually collected in 10-12 slides. It is advisable to place one section on the first slide, then one on the second slide, and so on, until all the slides contain one tissue section, before returning to place the next section on the first slide. This procedure aims to make the slides as similar as possible to each other, which provides a better comparison between slides after staining and fluorescence microscopy.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/758ea64d-2951-46d5-b4f6-0277b0f36da3/cpmo84-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nAn example layout of tissue slices on a glass slide. Each slide holds three to five tissue slices.\n21. Leave the slides to dry for 1 hr at RT.",
    "The drying process allows the sections to adhere more firmly to the coated slides and minimizes the risk of specimens falling off during the immunolabeling procedure.\n22. Store the slides at –80°C in a standard slide container until immunostaining, if the staining will not start on the same day. The slide containers do not need to be airtight.\n23. Air-dry the slides for 20 min at RT in a standard immunostaining tray (if they were previously stored at –80°C).\nThis step is not necessary if the slides were not frozen.\n24. Circle the sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen (e.g., PAP Pen or ImmEdge® pen).\n25. Rehydrate the sections with 1× PBS for 5 min at RT.\n26. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER), if needed.\nThe pH, temperature, and duration of heat-induced epitope retrieval should be individually determined for each antigen. The majority of antigens can be unmasked by heating the slides in a commercial citrate buffer solution for 5 min in a microwave or a pressure cooker. Fill the slide rack with the citrate retrieval buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-rec-0002]) and pre-heat in the microwave for 1 min, and then insert the slides into the pre-heated rack and place back in the microwave oven for an additional 5 min. Adjust the temperature to be as close as possible to the boiling point (around 90°C-95°C). Be careful to adjust the temperature/time ratio for the retrieval procedure. Heating the slide rack at very high temperatures for 5 min in a microwave oven might cause evaporation of the retrieval buffer and drying of the slides.\n27. After retrieval, wash each slide with 500 µl of 1× PBS for 5 min at RT. Aspirate the 1× PBS.",
    "28. Add 200 µl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS onto each slide for 20 min at RT.\n29. Perform the first blocking step with 200 µl 5% serum in 1× PBS (or 5% serum in 0.1% Triton X-100).\nThe concentration of serum in each protocol should be individually optimized according to the antigen. Use a serum from the species from which the secondary antibodies are derived.\n30. Wash three times, each time with 500 µl 1× PBS for 5 min at RT.\n31. Perform the second blocking step using a commercially available anti-mouse-IgG blocking reagent for 1 hr at RT, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n32. Wash again three times, each time with 500 µl of 1× PBS for 5 min at RT.\n33. Dilute the primary antibodies in 0.5% serum in PBS.\n34. Incubate with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. Place 100-200 µl of an antibody solution on each slide (depending on the number of sections on the slide).\nAny standard immunostaining tray/chamber may be used if it can be covered with a lid. It is imperative to maintain the humidity of the chamber by wetting some tissue paper with tap water and placing inside a wet tissue paper for the duration of the incubation (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmo.84#cpmo84-fig-0004]). When working with very expensive or rare primary antibodies, it is often possible to recollect the primary antibody solution and reuse it in another round of immunostaining within a few days. Reusing is only possible with robust primary antibodies, and only suitable for qualitative purposes. Keep the antibodies for reuse at +4°C and avoid re-freezing.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4a20c046-938c-41c0-8d84-16713e1fe578/cpmo84-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
