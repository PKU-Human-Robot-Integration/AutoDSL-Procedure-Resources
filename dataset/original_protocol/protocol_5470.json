    "Trafficking–DQ-Red BSA in HeLa cells Note: This protocol provides general guidelines and a procedure to perform trafficking assay using DQ-Red BSA as a cargo in HeLa cells. For other cell types, check which culture media and culture supplements the cell line you are using requires before starting cultures.The suggested cell number, concentration of DQ-BSA to be used, and transfection conditions are provided as a starting point. We recommend users to optimize these conditions based on the cell types they are using for the assay in order to obtain best results.   Cells are seeded on coverglass slips according to the experiment to be performed, for example siRNA transfection or plasmid transfection for over-expression studies. Note: For RNAi studies, seed 60,000 HeLa cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish containing 4 glass coverslips. After a period of 16 h, transfer individual glass coverslips to 24-well cell culture plate and siRNA treatment is performed as described in the next step. For overexpression related experiments, seed 0.18 million HeLa cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish containing 4 glass coverslips, and post 16 h of cell seeding, transfections is carried out as described below. The users are recommended to optimize the cell seeding density based on the cell type and their growth rates. In general, for RNAi studies that go upto 48-72 h, the starting cell density should be kept around 15-20%. For overexpression studies, the confluency of the cells should be around 40% at the day of transfection.   Perform the gene silencing or overexpression of exogenous plasmids in cells. siRNA is transfected using Dharmafect (GE) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol and plasmid DNA transfection is carried out using XtremegeneHD (Roche).",
    "Proceed with the assay once effective gene silencing is achieved upon siRNA treatment or expression of an exogenous gene is observed upon transfection of plasmid in case of over-expression studies. Note: For RNAi studies using Dharmafect (GE) reagents, > 80% silencing of an endogenous gene can be achieved within 48 h after siRNA transfection into HeLa cells. Similarly, expression of exogenous plasmid can be achieved within 16 h post-transfection using Xtremegene HD transfection reagent (Roche) in HeLa cells. However, users are recommended to determine the optimal conditions (siRNA concentration, period of siRNA treatment, transfection reagent, concentration of plasmid etc.) in order to achieve effective silencing of gene of interest or expression of transfected gene for their cell line of choice. Once these parameters are optimized, proceed with the trafficking assay post transfection.    Prepare the media for trafficking in a BD Falcon 15 ml centrifuge tube as follows: Trafficking media: DMEM + 1% serum + 1% NEAA + 1% GlutaMax + 1% HEPES Note: 300 µl for one well of a 24-well plate is sufficient to submerge the cells. Increase the volume of media required according to the dish size.   Warm the media at 37 °C.   DQ-BSA preparation: stock concentration–2 mg/ml; working concentration–10 µg/ml.   Calculate the amount of DQ-Red BSA required and add to trafficking media pre-warmed at 37 °C. Keep this mix at 37 °C for another 5 min. Note: Always make sure to spin the stock DQ-Red BSA (see Recipes) tube prior to making the ligand-trafficking media mix i.e., DQ-Red BSA mixed with trafficking media. This will ensure settling down of any DQ-BSA aggregates that may interfere with the trafficking assay and analysis of results.    Wash the cells seeded on coverslips once with pre-warmed 1x DPBS.",
    "Add the ligand-trafficking media mix to cells and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified cell culture chamber for 1 h and 6 h, respectively.   After the desired time points, fix cells with 4% PFA prepared in 1x DPBS for 10 min at room temperature.   To mark the nucleus, DAPI staining can be performed. Make DAPI stock solution of 1 mg/ml in sterile water, and use 1:1,000 dilution for staining the cells. Incubate coverslips with DAPI containing solution for 20 min followed by three washes with 1x DPBS and mount the coverslips on a glass slide using Fluoromount G.

The video describes the steps of DQ-Red BSA trafficking assay including preparation of cargo containing media, important precautions to be taken and the method of performing the experiment.                                                            Imaging, quantification and data analysis   The cells are imaged on a single plane using confocal microscope (LSM 710, ZEISS).   Analysis the image using ImageJ software (NIH).   Quantify the Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) as described:   Open the desired confocal image (.lsm file format) in ImageJ software.    Split channels and keep the window of desired channel open.    Select the cell by making an outline using ‘freehand selection’ tool.   Go to ‘Analyze’ → ‘Set measurements’ → ‘Select area, integrated density and mean gray value’.   Go to ‘Analyze’ again → Click on ‘Measure’.   A result window opens from where the values are copied to an Excel sheet.    For measuring the background intensity of the image, select 5 random areas in the image that do not have cells and repeat the above mentioned steps.    CTCF = Average Integrated intensity - (Average area x Average mean of background).",
    "Calculate the CTCF for each cell and plot the mean value.

Screenshots of important steps of CTCF analysis using ImageJ      For analyzing the number of DQ-Red BSA puncta in cells, use ‘Analyze Particle’ tool of ImageJ software and perform the quantification as described below:   Open the desired confocal image in ImageJ software.   Split channels of the image and select the channel of your interest. Close rest of the channels.   If there are multiple cells in an image, then crop out the cell of interest in the selected channel.   Duplicate the image (Shortcut–Ctrl + Shift + D).   Select any one of the two duplicate images and follow the steps written below.   Go to ‘Image’ → ‘Adjust’ → ‘Threshold’ → select for the Algorithm from the drop box and see which one highlight the punctate structures best in your image or set the threshold ‘manually’ → ‘Apply’.   Go to ‘Analyze’ → ‘Set measurements’ → select ‘Mean gray value, Area and Limit to threshold’.   In the same window, redirect to–select the image other than that was selected in step 4e → Press ‘OK’.   Go to ‘Analyze’ → ‘Analyze Particles’ → select ‘Display results and summarize’ → press ‘OK’.   Two result windows will open. One will have the data from every individual particle whereas the other one will be the summary having the average of the values from all the particles in the cell analyzed. Copy the data to an Excel sheet and analyze.   The result summary file shows the total count of particles analyzed, which is the number of DQ-Red BSA punctae in a cell.
