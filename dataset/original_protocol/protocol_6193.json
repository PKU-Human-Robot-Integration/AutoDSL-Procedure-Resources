    "Prepare the following solutions in advanceTSB (or LB) and TSB (LB) agar plates (see Recipes).50 mM HADA stock solution (see Recipes).10 and 1x sodium citrate buffers, 1x PBS and 3% paraformaldehyde (see Recipes).Note: Filter and cool 10x and 1x sodium citrate buffers, 1x PBS and 3% paraformaldehyde solution on ice prior to use. Growing the cellsDefrost glycerol stock solutions of the bacterial strains on ice. Streak the strains BW25113 (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000), D456 (Edwards and Donachie, 1993) and CS703-1 (Meberg et al., 2001) on TSB agar plates using an inoculation loop and incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C. Inoculate 25 ml of TSB (or LB) media with a single bacterial colony and incubate overnight at 37 °C. Dilute the overnight cultures to an OD578 of 0.1 in TSB (or LB) media and grow at 37 °C until they reach an exponential OD578 of 0.4.Labeling the cellsDilute the cells to an OD578 of 0.1 in a final volume of 500 μl of pre-warmed (37 °C) TSB (or LB) in a sterile 1.5 ml micro-tube. Add 2.5 µl of the 50 mM stock solution of fluorescent derivative of D-alanine (HADA) to the sample to achieve a final concentration of 250 μM and incubate with shaking for 30 min at 37 °C. Stop bacterial growth and washing steps to remove the excess of HADAAdd one-tenth of the final volume (50 µl) of ice cold 10x sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.25) to the growing cultures. Place the samples on ice until the centrifuge (step 2) is ready to use.Centrifuge the samples for 2 min at 16,200 x g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant carefully and resuspend the cell pellet in 1.5 ml ice cold 1x sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.0) by gentle pipetting.",
    "Centrifuge the samples for 2 min at 16,200 x g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant carefully and resuspend the cells in 1.5 ml ice cold 1x PBS (pH 7.4) by gentle pipetting and centrifuge the samples again. Repeat the washing step with ice cold 1x PBS (pH 7.4) for another time. Remove the supernatants of the samples carefully without touching the cell pellets.Note: It was reported that HADA is virtually non-fluorescent in acidic pH or non-buffered water and cells imaged at a pH above 7.0 showed the maximum brightness of HADA labeling (Kuru et al., 2015). Therefore, the last two washing steps with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) are crucial. Cell fixationResuspend the cell pellets in 12.5 µl 1× PBS and 12.5 μl of 3% paraformaldehyde (see Recipes) for cell fixation. Mix well by pipetting and store on ice or 4 °C until microscopic analysis. Note: Microscopic analysis of the labeled cells should be performed immediately. Microscopic analysisPipette 3 μl of the fixed cells in a well of the prepared microscopic agarose slide (see Recipes) and place a square shaped cover glass carefully on top and press gently. Analyze the labeled cells with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon Plan Fluor × 100/1.30 Oil Ph3 DLL objective) equipped with a Photometrics/Cool SNAP HQ2CCD camera using the phase contrast and DAPI channel (filter set: Chroma 49000, excitation at 350/50 nm, emission 460/50 nm). Use exposure times of 100 ms for phase contrast and 1 s for fluorescence images.Note: Using this optimized protocol, all analyzed cells were completely labeled, a stronger signal at the septum of constricting cells was revealed (see Figure 1). The addition of 10x sodium citrate buffer to the growing cells, the initial wash with 1x sodium citrate buffer at pH 3.",
    "0, and the rapid processing of the samples on ice improved the removal of unincorporated HADA and led to a decreased background fluorescence signal and improved signal detection. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190726/20190726015324_7981.jpgFigure 1. PG labeling of E. coli cells using the fluorescent D-amino acid HADA. A. BW25113 (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000), D456 (Edwards and Donachie, 1993) and CS703-1 (Meberg et al., 2011) cells were incubated with 250 µM HADA for 30 min (long pulse labeling). One-tenth of the final volume of 10x sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.25) was added to the cell cultures prior to short washing steps performed at 4 °C. First the cells were washed once with 1x sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.0) followed by two washing steps with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and visualized by phase contrast (left) and fluorescence microscopy using the DAPI channel (right). Scale bars, 2 μm. B. Optional"
