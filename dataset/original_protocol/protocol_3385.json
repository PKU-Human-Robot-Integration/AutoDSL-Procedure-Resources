    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest of mouse liver\nTiming: 10 min per mouse\nThis procedure describes liver perfusion and harvesting liver from mice. This protocol is validated for non-diseased and MASH livers.\nClean the hood and prepare for perfusion by filling 10 mL syringes with PBS and 1 mL syringes for cardiac puncture.\nEuthanize mice following the institutional Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nExpose the peritoneal and thoracic cavities.\nPerform cardiac puncture through the right ventricle with a 1 mL syringe to remove circulatory immune cells.\nInject 5 mL of PBS into the left ventricle, ensuring the liver inflates. Snip the portal vein and look for bleeding, then perfuse another 5 mL into the heart. The liver should turn less red.\nHarvest the liver from the mouse in one piece.\nNote: Remove the gall bladder (located under the right lobe). Cut connective tissue to facilitate the removal of the liver in one piece.\nWeigh the liver and place it in a labeled 50 mL tube with 10 mL of RPMI on ice.\nRepeat steps 2–7 for each mouse.\nCritical: Perfuse slowly to achieve homogeneous perfusion of the liver. If using CO2 for euthanasia, do not leave mice for too long in the CO2 chamber to avoid blood clots interfering with the perfusion.\nPreparation of single-cell suspension\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThis step describes how to isolate a single-cell suspension of intrahepatic lymphocytes, MOMFs, monocytes, and neutrophils from a mouse liver.\nTransfer the liver in 10 mL RPMI to a gentleMACS C-tube. Homogenize the liver using a gentleMACS dissociator (Program: C.O1, 0 TUBE).\nTransfer the homogenate to a 50 mL conical tube, and add RPMI up to 50 mL.",
    "Centrifuge at 60 × g for 1 min at a temperature between 20 and 25°C with no brake.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL tube.

Centrifuge to pellet (300 × g for 5 min at 4°C).\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of Maxpar PBS (PBS free of contaminating metals).\nCount the cells and determine viability using preferred methods.\nTransfer the desired cell number (typically 1 × 106–3 × 106 cells) to labeled flow cytometry tubes. Centrifuge to pellet (300 × g for 5 min at 4°C).\nCell surface staining for CyTOF\nTiming: 2.5 h",
