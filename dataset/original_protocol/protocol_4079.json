    "Apoplast protein extraction from plant materialNote: Acetylesterase activity assay can be applied not only for apoplast proteins but also for total proteins extracts and purified enzymes. Harvest 2-5 g of aerial parts (stems, leaves, siliques, flowers, and buds) of plants and immediately cut into 5 mm segments using a sharp razor blade.Place plant material into a 10 ml syringe which had its tip sealed with Parafilm (Figure 1A-B).Add 5 ml of pre-cooled extraction/reaction buffer. Place the syringe into a centrifuge tube (tip is showing downwards, Figure 1C) and treat under vacuum in exicator (Figure 1D-E) twice for 15 min with a 5 min break in a cold room at 10 °C.Open the tip of syringe, carefully drain the buffer by gravity flow and discard it.Centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 10 °C.Place apoplast extracts accumulates at the bottom of the tube on ice.Estimate protein concentration by NanoDrop or by Bradford assay described at Bradford Protein Assay[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/wenzhang.aspx?id=45] (He, 2011).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140126/20140126153254_0825.jpgDilute apoplast extract with extraction/reaction buffer to obtain 0.128 mg in 100 µl.Note: Amount of protein for assay will vary depending on the enzymatic activity and specificity of acetylesterases present in extract. Here we perform example made on Arabidopsis extracts. Prepare blank negative control by adding of 1 μl of 200 mM pNP-acetyl to the 100 μl of boiled for 10 min apoplast extract containing 0.128 mg of protein.Add 1 μl of 200 mM pNP-acetyl to 100 µl of diluted apoplast extract.Incubate at room temperature for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 min reading blank and samples absorbance at 460 nm in microplate reader at each time point.Prepare standard curve by measuring absorbance at 460 nm of 100 μl pNP solution diluted in series of concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 2 mM. All dilutions prepare in 3 replicates.",
    "Calculate the slope of the line which will give STD1 value equal to absorbance of 0.1 μmoles of pNP.Measure OD460 sample-OD460 blank for each time point and calculate the slope.Calculate the amount of released pNP using the following formula:Slope/STD1*0.1/0.128Slope (from step B6)0.1 and STD1 (from step B5)0.128 (from step B2)Obtaining valueу will indicate amount of released pNP µmoles per 1 min per 1 mg of apoplast proteinsAssay for acetylesterase activity using  natural substrates (cell wall derived polysaccharides)Apply 0.12 mg of apopalst protein in extraction/reaction buffer to 20 mg of natural substrate in total volume 0.6 ml.Prepare blank negative control by adding 0.12 mg of boiled apoplast protein in extraction/reaction obuffer to 20 mg of natural substrate.Incubate at room temperature for 0, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h shaking at 130 rpm.At each time point spin down polysaccharide material (1 min at 17,000 x g) and take an aliquot 100 μl of supernatant.Note: After taking the aliquot vortex the pellet and continue incubation.Dry the aliquot using SpeedVac.Re-suspend dry material in 40 μl of Re-suspension buffer (use vortex).Add 100 μl of deionized water and mix carefully.Add 100 μl of acid-alcohol solution and mix carefully.Add 260 μl of Ferric Perchlorate reagent and mix carefully.Incubate at room temperature 15-30 min.Measure the absorbance at 510 nm.Measure OD510 sample-OD510 blank for each time point and calculate the slope.Prepare standard curve using glucose-penta-acetate with a series of dilutions from 0.1 mM to 2 mM in 40 μl solution following by steps C7-12 paragraphs from above. Calculate slope which will give STD2 value equal to absorbance of 0.2 nmoles of acetyl residues.Calculate the amount of released acetyls from natural substrates by following formula:Slope*0.2/STD2/0.02Slope (from step C12)0.2 and STD2 (from step C8)0.02 (from a. 0.",
