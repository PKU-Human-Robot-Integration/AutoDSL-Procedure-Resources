    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Expression of fluorescent proteins in xenopus embryos\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThe protocol is adapted from Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual (Sive et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) and Obtaining Xenopus laevis embryos (Shaidani et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nTo obtain X. laevis eggs, stimulate ovulation in X. laevis adult females by subcutaneous injection of (800 units/animal) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (ChorulonR) into the dorsal lymph sacs.\nFrom 16 to 24 h post-stimulation, collect eggs from stimulated females by manual squeezing. Eggs are collected in empty Petri dishes.\nPerform in vitro fertilization with sperm from adult males.\nTo collect sperm for in vitro fertilization, the males need to be euthanized to explant the testes. Males are euthanized by immersion in a 2 liter bath of benzocaine solution (2,6 mL/L) through immersion of frogs in benzocaine bath (2 liter per frog) for 15 min followed by cervical sectioning of the spinal cord posterior to the skull.\nNote: Before cervical sectioning, check that the male is unresponsive to foot pinching with tweezers.\nUsing dissection scissors, cut through the skin and the abdominal muscles to open the lower abdominal cavity on the ventral side. The testes are found on the dorsal side of the cavity, on either side of the aorta, behind the fat bodies. Cut the testes out and trim away any attached fat and viscera. Transfer at 4°C in 0.1× MBS (Modified Barth’s Saline; see the recipe for 1× MBS below) for in vitro fertilization on the same day.\nNote: testes can be stored at 4°C in Leibovitz's L-15 Medium, GlutaMAX™ Supplement culture media (ThermoFisher) for up to a week without significant loss of sperm viability.",
    "Cut a quarter to a third of testis and crush it with a plastic microcentrifuge pestle in 0.5 mL of 0.1× MBS into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nWith a glass pipet, deposit the solution of crushed testis evenly on the eggs. Use the plastic pestle to distribute the eggs into a monolayer on the Petri dish and wait for 5 min before covering them with 0.1× MBS for 1.5 h.\nDe-jelly the fertilized eggs with gentle agitation for about 10 min in 2% cysteine in 0.1× MBS at pH 8. The cysteine solution should be prepared immediately before use. Once the jelly-coat is dissolved and the eggs have started to pack, wash extensively in water to remove the cysteine. Note: Prolonged exposure to cysteine will damage embryos.\nKeep embryos in 0.1× MBS at 13°C, 18°C or 23°C until they reach the stage suitable for injection (8- or 16-cell).\nOnce the first cell division is completed, transfer embryos in Ficoll 4% in 1× MBS\nPrepare materials for microinjection:\nMicro-manipulation and micro-injection device Nanoject II (Drummond).\nPull glass needles from 1.14 mm (outer diameter) × 3.5\" length × .53 mm (inner diameter) glass microcapillaries (3.5\" Drummond #3-000-203-G/X) with a needle puller (inner tip diameter must be 10–30 μm).\nBack-fill the glass needle with mineral oil using a Drummond syringe with a 30 gauge, 2\" long blunt needle, (Drummond Scientific). Pay special attention to avoiding air bubbles. Mount the glass needle on a micro-manipulator. Break the tip of the glass needle with surgical grade tweezers, at an angle of 45°.\nShort before injection, prepare the injection mix (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with mRNA coding for mRFP (500 pg/blastomere) and pα-tub::GFP or pα-tub::LifeActGFP (50–60 pg/ blastomere). Both plasmids must have been previously linearized by NotI.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1147_3.csv\nNote: Plasmid linearization increases the number of GFP-positive MCCs.",
    "(Optional) Constructs can be co-injected with morpholinos to deplete specific proteins. Note: Morphant cells can be visualized by mRFP tracer co-injected with morpholinos. Alternatively, fluorescent morpholinos can be used to directly visualize live morphant MCCs.\nNote: adjust the concentration of each construct to the final volume to be injected in each blastomere: injection volume per blastomere of 10nl is preferentially used but it can be increased to 20nl when injection mixture includes morpholinos.\nDeposit a 1–3 μL drop of the injection mix on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish and load it into the glass needle by suction.\nInject the loaded construct mix under the apical surface of the ventral animal blastomeres (precursors of the non-neural ectoderm) of 8 cell- or 16 cell-stage embryos. Ventral blastomeres can be distinguished by their darker pigmentation\nNote: to maximize the number of fluorescent MCCs, both ventral animal blastomeres of 8 cell-stage embryos are injected. On the other hand, mosaicism can be increased by injecting only two of the four ventral animal blastomeres of 16 cell-stage embryos.\nTransfer embryos in 2% Ficoll in 0.1× MBS and culture at 13°C.\nCulture embryos in 0.1× MBS for 1–2 days at the preferred temperature (13°C–23°C) until the first signs of stage 14 (earliest stage at which α-tub-driven expression of fluorescent proteins can be detected in the injected MCCs; see developmental table).\nNote: Incubation of sibling injected embryos at different temperatures will result in different developmental rates (Nieuwkoop et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), thus allowing to perform several live imaging experiments with a single batch of injected embryos. For example, embryos cultured at 23°C are ready for imaging 15 h post-injection while embryos cultured at 13°C can be imaged 48 h post-injection.",
    "Note: Considering the possibility of sample loss caused by embryo death or embedding problems, we recommend to inject at least 10–15 embryos per condition.\n(Optional) Pharmacological inhibitors can be added to the culture medium. In Chuyen et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Axitinib or CK-666 was added to culture medium from stage 12 onwards.\nStep 2: Preparation of sample for live imaging\nTiming: 30 min\nImmobilization of samples is the key step for successful live imaging (Bostock et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The α-tub-driven expression of fluorescent reporter proteins in MCCs becomes detectable around stage 14 (25 h post fertilization at 18°C) but in the following hours the embryonic epidermis is subjected to significant strains due to embryo elongation, which can affect the process of image acquisition. The method we propose here is a home-made montage to limit tissue movement during live imaging. A list of possibly encountered problems has been established (see problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in Troubleshooting).\nAs soon as embryos reach stage 14, sort the fluorescently labeled embryos under a stereomicroscope (excitation/emission settings for GFP (488/510) and RFP (532/588)).\nNote: Due to the mosaicism caused by unequal plasmid inheritance, not all MCCs may be labeled and fluorescence intensity may increase with time, leading to the detection of additional MCCs during recording. By default, select embryos with the highest number of GFP-positive MCCs.\nPrepare the embedding medium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1147-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Embedding of embryos for live imaging\n(A) Equipment and materials required for experiment: 100 mL glass bottle containing molten 0,8% low melting point agar in 0,1× MBS; box of 24∗40 mm coverslips; a petri dish containing transfected stage 14 embryos with MCCs expressing fluorescent reporter; plastic pipette or flame-polished glass Pasteur pipette, needle-less syringe filled with silicon grease and forceps.",
    "(B) Using a 10 mL needle-less syringe filled with silicon grease, delimit a roughly 2cm2 area chamber onto a 24∗40 mm coverslip but do not completely close the chamber.\n(C) Image of a 2cm2 open silicon chamber onto a 24∗40 mm coverslip.\n(D) Silicon chamber filled with 3–4 drop of molten agar and 4 embryos.\n(E) Image of an embryo with field of GFP-positive cells oriented upward.\n(F) Embedded embryos between two coverslips ready for live imaging.\n(G) Schematic illustration of embryo embedding between two coverslips. Right panels represent transversal view of flatten embedded embryo, which can be imaged from both sides.\nWith microwave or 37°C water-bath, melt 0.8% low melting point (LMP) Agar in 0.1× MBS.\nNote: when melted with microwave, wait until the solution goes below 40°C (roughly, when it becomes possible to hold the tube bare-handed).\n(Optional) If embryos have been treated with a pharmacological inhibitor and if the treatment must be extended during time-lapse recording, the inhibitor can be added to molten LMP Agar\nNote: in this case, melt with 37°C water-bath to avoid thermal destruction of the inhibitor\nUsing a 10 mL needle-less syringe filled with silicon grease, delineate a chamber of roughly 2cm2 area onto a 24×40 mm coverslip (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nUsing a flame-polished glass Pasteur pipette or plastic pipette fill the chamber with 3–4 drops of molten agar (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: keep the silicon chamber opened to allow air exit when the second coverslip is applied (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing a flame-polished glass Pasteur pipette or plastic pipette, drop 4–5 selected embryos in molten agar (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and position them with the help of a forceps, such that the regions richest in GFP-positive MCCs face upwards (this can be done under a fluorescent dissecting microscope) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Note: the time between steps 2 and 3 should not exceed 2minutes to prevent the agar from hardening (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nQuickly seal the silicon grease chamber with a second coverslip before the agar sets (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: embryos might roll during the sealing process. If this happens, it is possible to rotate them back in a favorable position by gently sliding the two coverslips against each other. If embryos have entirely rolled over and GFP-positive MCCs locate on the other side, this technique increase by two-fold the chance of success of getting an optimal field for live imaging since cells may be filmed through the bottom coverslip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nPress gently the two coverslips to slightly flatten the embryos without crushing them (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nCritical: since developmental stage cannot be estimated once embryos are embedded we recommend to start live imaging experiment immediately after embedding.\nStep 3: Spinning-disk confocal live imaging of MCCs in embryonic epidermis\nTiming: 2–8 h\nMCCs start expressing fluorescent reporters when they are still irregularly distributed within the inner layer of the epidermis. During image acquisition, MCCs first migrate within the plane of the inner layer to disperse at regular intervals and later migrate radially to intercalate among outer-layer cells. To record the movements of MCCs through the thickness of the two epidermal layers, we use spinning-disk confocal microscopy to acquire z-stack images at high speed. Our protocol was designed to characterize MCC movements relative to each other and to outer-layer cell junctions. We also wanted to measure the time of contact between MCCs, the evolution of MCC speed relative to mutual contact events and the MCC migration path relative to outer-layer cell junctions.",
    "Thus, it is critical to choose samples in which MCC labeling and orientation are optimal. Since MCCs randomly migrate laterally, some MCCs may exit the region of interest, while others may enter it. For the successful exploitation of time-lapse movies, it is essential to maintain the same field of view via frequent manual realignment.\nNote: As the embryo has a convex surface, the ideal region to be filmed is where the epidermis is flattened by contact with the coverslip.\nPosition the coverslip ‘sandwich’ in the imaging chamber of the Nikon Roper spinning-disk Eclipse Ti inverted confocal microscope.\nNote: the chamber must be stabilized at 23°C to reduce developmental variability between experiments.\nChoose the objective and select the optimal field with mercury lamp HBO 50 W fluorescent illumination.\nSet up microscope for z-stack time-lapse acquisition: 20μm-deep Z sections; z-step = 0.5–0.7 μm; 2 frames averaging; time interval 30 s–2 min (depending on the number of channels used).\nAdjust exposure time and laser power to the fluorescence intensity of the different channels.\nNote: the z stack acquisition time must be at least 5–10 sec shorter than the time interval between stacks (see step 12).\nSelect a field of interest and set your stacks range taking as reference the 561 nm channel and the surface of the outer layer cells for the most apical z and the 491 nm channel, which labels the MCCs within the inner layer for the most basal z.\nLaunch time-lapse acquisition for 2–10 h. Note: Although some fluorescent cellular debris can be observed (Icha et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) the use of a fluorescent caspase activity reporter never revealed significant cell death (Chuyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). However, tissue collapse has been reported in experiments which last longer than 10 h .",
    "During embryo development, morphogenetic movements will cause displacements in X, Y or Z direction. Whenever necessary, adjust manually the X, Y and Z axes, taking advantage of the 5–10sec lapse of time between stacks using the joystick Nikon TI-S-EJOY system (see point 3 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nStep 4: Movie stabilization and quantitative analysis of MCC behavior\nTiming: 1 day\nRaw data obtained with spinning-disk confocal time-lapse imaging are processed for image and movie visualization and further quantification as indicated below. The multidimensional images are processed with the imageJ/Fiji free software and two individual homemade Python scripts.\nZ-stacks from confocal video microscopy are converted into single plane projection by maximum intensity or sum intensity projection. Each channel is processed separately with the optimized z-section corresponding to the outer/inner layer cell staining.\nStabilization of movements caused by tissue growth in the x,y axis is done as following:\nWith “manual tracking “Fiji plugin (https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-tracking[href=https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-tracking]), a single vertex is tracked frame by frame to extract its coordinates as reference for movie stabilization.\nA first Python 3 script has been developed to quantify this latter tracked vertex drift at frame level and correct it (see https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/refocus.py[href=https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/refocus.py]).\nWe then use the “Image Stabilizer” Fiji plugin (https://imagej.net/Image_Stabilizer[href=https://imagej.net/Image_Stabilizer]), which implements the Lucas-Kanade algorithm to further stabilize the movie (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1147-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of a movie before and after the different steps of stabilization",
    "Initial time point (top) and final time point (bottom) from projection of time-lapse movies (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]) are shown in original, refocused and stabilized format (refer to Quantification and Statistical Analysis, step 1 to 2). In the original movie, a reference vertex (white arrowhead) is tracked frame by frame through the movie. Using extracted coordinate of the tracked vertex, images are refocused to preserve the original position of that vertex. Next, stabilized images are obtained by using the “Image Stabilizer” Fiji plugin, which implements the Lucas-Kanade algorithm to further stabilize the movie. On the bottom images, the dotted squares demarcate the conserved frame with stabilized position. In the original movie, the tracked vertex has drifted from its initial position. In refocused and stabilized movies, the frame of interest is repositioned to maintain the tracked vertex on its initial position. Note that in refocused and stabilized movies, the MCC tracked in white has been cut by the reframing. Consequently, after reframing only MCCs within the conserved frame can be scored.\nNote: Depending on the filmed region, embryo morphogenetic movements can cause heterogeneous tissue deformation, which complicates image stabilization. This is particularly sensitive with 10× or 20× magnification (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] in Troubleshooting).\nQuantification of MCC migratory behavior:\nStabilized movies are used to track all visible GFP-positive MCCs. The centroid of each cell is manually tracked with “manual tracking“ Fiji plugin throughout each movie to analyze the migratory behavior of MCCs. Open the stabilized movie and create one track per MCC. One by one, click manually on the centroid of each MCC from the beginning to the end.\nNote: Finding position of MCCs can be difficult (see point 5 in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Another Python 3 script has been developed to generate a set of “behavioral descriptors” using the tracked MCC centroid file to further characterize the migratory behavior of MCCs: distance of displacement, cumulative travelled distance, migration direction, instant velocity. (see: https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/analysis.py[href=https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/analysis.py]). This script is fully parameterizable by the user: smoothing of centroid position (x,y) to avoid manual tracking artifacts (sigma parameter), smoothing of stabilization throughout the whole movie (window parameter), unit of measure relationship (pixmicron parameter), unit of time relationship (framesec parameter). An excel file is then generated containing all the “behavioral descriptors” for the given movie."
