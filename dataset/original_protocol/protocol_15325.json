  "procedures": [
    "1. Intravenous injection of Ad-2D6 into ophthalmic sinus\nUnder sterile conditions, dilute the Ad-2D6 virus stock solution to a concentration of 5 x 109 pfu/ml in RPMI and keep the Ad-2D6 virus solution on ice. Injection of two doses of 5 x 108 pfu (intravenous and intraperitoneal) has proven to result in the most reliable outcome of autoimmune hepatitis in mice of the FVB strain.\nAnesthetize mouse with 4% isoflurane in an anesthesia chamber. Pinch the hind leg to make sure the animal is anesthetized.\nHold the mouse by the back of the neck and tighten the loose skin of the head with thumb and middle finger. Like this, the eye protrudes slightly by the traction to the skin adjacent to the eye.\nPlace the needle vertically into the medial canthus (junction of eyelids closest to the animal's nose) and slowly inject 100 μl Ad-2D6 virus solution.  It is important not to apply too much pressure, to avoid damage of the vessels and trachea.\nSlowly withdraw the needle to avoid spillage and close the eyelids.\nInjection worked well if the virus solution does not leak out trough the nose and the eye slides back to its initial position.\nImmediately following the intravenous injection, perform a standard intraperitoneal injection of the second 100 μl of the Ad-2D6 virus solution.\nAlternatively, the intravenous injection can be executed via the tail vein. However, injection via the ophthalmic sinus is much easier to perform and minimizes the loss of virus solution. It has been demonstrated that these two techniques can be used interchangeably and that both routes are equally effective 10.",
    "Infected mice are monitored for adverse effects and obvious signs of suffering and pain, such as loss of appetite, loss of weight, loss of mobility, failure to groom, rough hair coat, hunched appearance, as well as licking, biting, scratching, or shaking a particular area (i.e. site of injection). Although the mice display a massive damage to the liver in the CYP2D6 model, the mice seem healthy and show no signs of suffering, pain or stress. Nevertheless, indicators of severe liver failure, such as serum aminotransferases are determined on a regular basis or are part of the performed experiments. Serum aminotransferase levels of >1000 U/l should only appear as a direct result of the virus infection, but not chronically. If the serum aminotransferase levels are chronically above 1000 U/l (severity limit) the mice are sacrificed. \n2. Mouse eye bleeding\nAnesthetize mouse with 4% isoflurane in an anesthesia chamber. Pinch the hind leg to make sure the animal is anesthetized.\nHold the mouse by the back of the neck and tighten the loose skin of the head with thumb and middle finger. Like this, the eye protrudes slightly by the traction to the skin adjacent to the eye.\nPlace the tip of the capillary tube at the lower or inner corner of the eye and gently but firmly slid alongside the eyeball to the ophthalmic venous sinus. The venous capillaries rupture and the resulting hemorrhage fills the orbital cavity.\nSlightly withdraw the capillary tube to free the tip so that the accumulated blood is drawn into the tube.\nWhen enough blood is collected, the tube is withdrawn and the eyelids closed. Bleeding stops upon withdrawal of the tube and reestablishment of normal ocular pressure upon the venous complex.",
    "Blood in the capillary tube is transferred to a Microtainer tube and incubated for 30 min on ice.\nThe Microtainer tube is centrifuged at 7500 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.\nThe supernatant corresponds to the serum which is transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -80 °C.\nSerum can be used to determine antibody titer by ELISA. Indicators of liver damage such as the serum levels of the hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT/GPT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST/GOT) can be assessed using the according test strips from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) and a Reflotron Plus analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\nAlternatively, blood sampling can be done via the tail vein or via the superficial temporal vein11.\n3. Mouse liver perfusion\nRemark: This step is important to avoid a contamination of isolated liver lymphocytes by blood lymphocytes\nEuthanize the mouse by lethal doses of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation.\nMount the animal laying on its back on the styrofoam board. Use 23 G needles to pin extremities.\nMoisturize and disinfect the mouse with 70 % EtOH\nAbout 1 cm away from hind legs, make an incision through the skin and the muscle layer. Cut on both sides of the animal working up to the diaphragm.\nWhen the diaphragm is reached the skin can be flipped backwards.\nCut the diaphragm away from the rips then cut the vena cava.\nMove the stomach and the intestines off to the side, exposing the portal vein.\nIn the portal vein insert a 27 G needle connected to a 5 ml syringe filled with cold PBS. Let the PBS slowly wash the blood out of the liver.\nDissect the liver by grabbing onto the diaphragm and cutting the diaphragm away from the body.",
    "Transfer the liver to a petri dish and remove the diaphragm, the gallbladder and any other tissue still connected to the liver\nTransfer the liver to 10 ml PBS in a 50 ml tube on ice or embed in OCT compound.\n4.

Carefully add 10 ml cold collagenase buffer and press through strainer. Collect suspension and filter through strainer two times more.\nTransfer suspension to fresh 50 ml tube on ice. Process next liver.\nIncubate liver cell suspension at 37 °C for 60 min, mix gently every 15 min.\nCentrifuge at 30 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer supernatant to a fresh tube, leaving 5 mm fluid above pellet\nCentrifuge at 650 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard supernatant, leaving 3 mm above pellet\nResuspend pellet in 20 ml Percoll buffer",

Representative Results\nInfection of mice with Ad-2D6 induced two distinct stages of liver damage. In the first days after infection, virus infection of the liver causes an acute increase of serum aminotransferase levels, an indicator of hepatocyte death6. This first, acute stage occurs independent of the expression of hCYP2D6 and can also be observed after infection with an empty control virus (Ad-Control) or a virus expressing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP). In contrast, the second stage is autoimmune-mediated and dependent on the expression of the triggering molecule hCYP2D6. This autoimmune stage occurs within 2-4 weeks post-infection and persists for several months6.\n \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3644/3644fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The CYP2D6 model. Wildtype FVB or C57BL/6 mice are injected with two doses of Ad-2D6 (intravenous and intraperitoneal). At a time of interest the liver and the serum are collected and assessed for liver damage and formation of hCYP2D6-specific antibodies and T cells.\nThe following features are characteristic for the persistent autoimmune hepatitis developing after Ad-2D6-infection of wildtype FVB or C57BL/6 mice in the CYP2D6 model: First, the liver shows an aberrantly changed morphology. In particular, the liver lobes are fused, hyperplasic nodules appear scattered over the entire liver and a massive capsular fibrosis is visible (figure 2).\n \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3644/3644fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Liver morphology. Typical Ad-2D6-induced liver damage as detected at week 4 post-infection. Note that the individual liver lobes are fused (arrowheads). Hyperplasic nodules appear scattered over the entire liver (arrows). Infection with a control adenovirus not expressing hCYP2D6 has no effect on the liver morphology.",
    "Second, extensive and persistent cellular infiltrations appear in the peri-portal and parenchymal regions of the livers of Ad-2D6-infected but not Ad-Control-infected mice (figure 3A). Fibrosis predominantly develops in the subcapsular region with some collagen bundles protruding into the parenchyma (figure 3B).\n \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3644/3644fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Liver histology. A: H&E staining of liver tissue section of FVB mice infected with either Ad-Control or Ad-2D6 at week 4 post-infection. Note that significant infiltrations of mononuclear cells are only present in Ad-2D6 infected mice (single arrows). Triple arrows indicate larger cellular infiltrations in the liver parenchyma bridging between neighboring portal tracts. B: Immunohistochemical representation of liver fibrosis at week 4 after infection with Ad-2D6 or Ad-control. The liver sections have been stained for collagen using an anti-collagen I antibody. Note multiple layer of collagen disposition under the liver capsule (triple arrows) with some bundles protruding into the parenchyma (single arrows) and the presence of large clusters of infiltrating cells (arrowheads). Two representative liver sections are displayed for each condition. Size bars: 100μm.\nA third feature is the generation of high titers of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies, which have a similar epitope specificity to human LKM-1 antibodies 6,13. Last, hCYP2D6-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are generated that predominantly home to the liver. Such hCYP2D6-specific T cells can be detected by stimulation with immunodominant hCYP2D6 peptides and subsequent measurement of IFNγ expression by an intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS) (figure 4). hCYP2D6-specific CD8 T cells kill Ad-2D6-infected target cells in vivo 12.\n \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3644/3644fig4.jpg",

Liver lymphocytes have been isolated at week 4 after Ad-2D6-infection and were stimulated with either the immunodominant CD4 or CD8 hCYP2D6 epitope overnight. Generation of IFNγ was detected by intracellular cytokine staining and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). The percentage of hCYP2D6-specific CD4 and CD8 cells is indicated."
