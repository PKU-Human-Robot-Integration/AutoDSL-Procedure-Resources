    "Human tissue studies were conducted on deidentified specimens obtained from the Southern California Islet Cell Resource Center at City of Hope. The research consents for the use of postmortem human tissues were obtained from the donors' next of kin, and ethical approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of City of Hope (IRB No. 01046).\n1. Physical dissociation (estimated time: 1-2 h)\nPlace a fresh artery on a 10 cm dish and wash with sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS).\nWith sterile forceps and dissection scissors, remove the fat and outer connective tissues until the vessel is clean. Measure the length of the vessel with a ruler placed outside of the dish and take pictures for records (Figure 1A).\nPre-warm appropriate digestion buffer to 37 °C: for scRNA-seq use cell-dissociation enzyme; for cell culture assays use 1-6 mg/mL of Collagenase D, 3 mg/mL of bacteria-derived protease, 100 mM of HEPES, 120 mM of NaCl, 50 mM of KCl, 5 mM of glucose, with 1 mM of CaCl26,38 (pH 7.0, does not require adjustment) added 5 min prior to use.\nTake the mesenteric artery (typically with a diameter of 6-8 mm) and cut lengthwise with scissors to open the vessel lumen vertically.\nUsing needles, attach the vessel onto black wax on all four corners, leaving the intima exposed (Figure 1B).\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed digestion buffer to intima. Take a sterile scalpel and scrape the lumen of the vessel gently twice.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of this procedure is to dissociate the intimal layer, which may need practice. Enough force needs to be exerted to remove endothelium, but not so much that the deeper layers of tissue are also removed, which will reduce the EC representation.",
    "Transfer the digestion buffer into a 5 mL tube. Add 1 mL of digestion buffer to the intima and pipette up and down carefully to collect the remaining cells and add to the 5 mL tube. Incubate cells at 37 °C, rotating at 150 rpm for 5 min.\nAdd 2 mL of M199 medium (or D-PBS if proceeding with scRNA-seq) to the cell suspension to quench the enzymatic reaction. Mix gently and centrifuge at 4 °C, 600 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and store the supernatant separately to culture as a control to observe if all cells are captured in the pellet in step 1.8. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of M199 medium (or D-PBS if proceeding with scRNA-seq).\nAssess the cell viability by mixing 10 µL of trypan blue with 10 µL of cell stock. Observe the cell morphology and count the cells using a hemocytometer.\n\t​NOTE: At this point, cells can be used for protein or RNA quantification or cultured in vitro using EC culture media following standard protocols39. Alternatively, they can be prepared for sequencing as described in the next section.\nFor the culture, coat two wells of a 6-well plate by pipetting 500 µL of attachment reagent into wells for 30 min at room temperature. After removal of attachment reagent and washing with sterile D-PBS, dispense the full cell stock into one well, and the supernatant kept as a control into the second well.\n2. Preparation for scRNA-seq studies (estimated time: 3-4 h)",
    "Centrifuge the cell stock from step 1.11 at 4 °C, 600 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet gently with a P1000 pipette and wide-bore tip in 1 mL of 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in D-PBS. Mix well to ensure a single-cell suspension.\nPass the solution through a 40 µm strainer to remove cell debris. If debris remains, pass through a second strainer into 4 mL of 0.04% BSA in D-PBS.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C, 600 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of 0.04% BSA in D-PBS using a P1000 pipette with a wide-bore pipette tip. Mix well to ensure a single-cell suspension.\nAssess the cell viability by mixing 10 µL of cell stock with 10 µL of trypan blue. Using a hemocytometer, observe the morphology, determine whether there is a single-cell suspension without clusters, check for tissue debris, and calculate the number of living and dead cells.\nIf cells are clustered or debris remains, repeat washing with 0.04% BSA in D-PBS or pass through 40 µm strainer again.\n\tNOTE: While this will reduce the yield, it is important that cells exist in a clean single-cell suspension for optimal sequencing.\nThe single-cell suspension can be used for scRNA-seq.\n3. Spatial transcriptome profiling (estimated time: 3-4 h)\nAdd isopentane (2-methylbutane) to a metal canister and chill in liquid nitrogen (LN2) or dry ice (LN2 is preferred as it will bring the temperature lower than dry ice). Pour optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) in wells of labeled plastic cryomolds taking care to not create bubbles and remove those that appear. Leave cryomold on dry ice to chill.",
    "Cut at least two coronal sections, 1 cm in length of the vessel. Using long (12\") forceps, submerge the tissue in isopentane until frozen. Quickly submerge the tissue in OCT at orientation with the lumen visible in the center. Take care to remove any bubbles, especially those next to the tissue.\nUsing long (12\") forceps, grasp the cryomolds, and hold them in the metal canister. While the base of the molds should be in the liquid, it should not be too deep to allow isopentane to run over the tissue. Observe the freezing, the OCT will become white progressively from the outside in 1-2 min.\nStore these sections in a sealed container at -80 °C for up to 6 months.\n\tNOTE: Maintain samples on dry ice at all times and do not allow more than one freeze-thaw cycle. This tissue can be used for histological analysis, RNA/DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or spatial transcriptomics, which will be described now.\nSet up the cryostat temperature to -20 °C for the chamber and -10 °C for the specimen head. Equilibrate OCT embedded vessel sections, knives, brushes, and slides to -20 °C in the cryostat for approximately 30 min. While equilibrating, clean the machine and all equipment that may touch the sections, including the blade, with 70% ethanol followed by RNase decontamination solution.\nAttach the sample by dispensing a small amount of OCT onto the circular cryostat block and placing the sample on top before it freezes. Place the block into the center of the specimen head and screw the block in place using a tall black handle on the left. Cut away any excess OCT surrounding the vessel.",
    "Setting the cutting thickness to 10 µm on the cryostat, cut approximately 60 sections and place them in a pre-cooled 1.5 mL tube. These sections will be used to assess the RNA quality. Upon removal from cryostat, immediately add 1 mL of RNA extraction reagent and vortex until the sections are completely dissolved.\nAdd 200 µL of chloroform and mix until the solution resembles a strawberry milkshake. Centrifuge at 11,200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the aqueous phase (clear phase on top of white and pink layers) and add 500 µL of isopropanol to it. Mix by inverting the tubes over 10 times and place at -80 °C for at least 20 min.\nCentrifuge at 11,200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Dissolve the purified RNA pellet in 5 µL of RNase-free water. Examine the RNA Integrity Number (RIN).\n\tNOTE: Samples with RIN ≥ 7 are preferred, but RIN ≥ 6 is acceptable. The number of tissue sections and volume of solution for RNA dissolving may require optimization depending on the system used to ensure the final RNA concentration is within the RIN function range to allow for accurate RIN evaluation.\nPractice cutting and placing sections properly within the fiducial frames using plain glass slides before proceeding to commercially available tissue optimization or gene expression slides. This can be achieved by drawing 6.5 mm x 6.5 mm squares on a plain glass slide, cooling to -20 °C in the cryostat, and placing sections in this capture area.\nCut 10 µm sections with anti-roll plate in place, flip and carefully flatten by gently touching the section through the surrounding OCT.",
    "Using RNase-free cryostat brushes place the tissue section within the square, using only the surrounding OCT. Immediately place one finger (in gloves) on the backside of the capture area to melt the section to the slide.\nOnce the section has adhered, place the slide onto the cryobar to allow the section to freeze. Care must be taken to avoid tissue folding and tissue overlying the demarcated edges of the fiducial frame. If necessary, cut the tissue into halves or quarters along the lumen using a blade to ensure the vessel section fits within the 6.5 mm x 6.5 mm frame.\nCut 10 µm sections of tissue as per 3.12-3.14 onto tissue optimization or gene expression slides. Transfer the slide to a slide mailer placed on dry ice. Store slides at -80 °C for up to 4 weeks before proceeding with published spatial protocols33,34.\n4. Sequencing data analysis (estimated time: up to 1 week depending on familiarity with software)\nNOTE: For spatial transcriptomic analysis only, skip to step 4.8. scRNA-seq data is processed using the standardized pipeline aligned to human hg38 reference transcriptome. The R package Seurat (v3.2.2) is used to analyze scRNA-seq data following published guidelines40.\nFilter using well-established quality control metrics: rare cells with very high numbers of genes (potentially multiplets) and cells with high mitochondrial percentages (low-quality or dying cells often present mitochondrial contamination) are removed.\nNormalize data using \"sctransform\", a method to improve sample integration compared to log-normalization. These normalized data are used for dimensionality reduction and clustering, while log-normalized expression levels are used for analysis based on gene expression levels, such as cell-type classification41.",
    "Select marker genes per cell type, for example, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) for ECs, lumican (LUM) and procollagen C-Endopeptidase Enhancer (PCOLCE) for fibroblasts, B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) and CD52 for macrophages, C1QA and C1QB for monocytes, and myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and transgelin (TAGLN) for vascular smooth muscle cells36.\nCompute the average expression level across single cells between each pair of markers in order to have a single marker with an average expression level associated with each cell type42.\nApply a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with two components to the expression data of each marker across single cells in order to separate cells into two sets, namely, highly expressing the marker and lowly expressing the marker. In this way, for each marker, each single cell is assigned to one of the two components42.\nUse statistical enrichment for the set of marker genes, a Fisher's exact test, to assign a cell type to each cluster. By doing so, a set of p-values are obtained per cluster, each corresponding to a cell type. The cell type with the lowest p-value is assigned to that cluster.\nProcess the spatial transcriptomic data using the Space Ranger pipelines resulting in spatial de-barcoding and generation of quality control (QC) metrics, including total aligned reads to hg38 human transcriptome, the median number of Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) or genes per spot35.\n\tNOTE: The R package Seurat (v3.2.2) is used to analyze the Space Ranger-processed data following published guidelines40.\nNormalize data using \"sctransform\", a method which is demonstrated to improve the downstream analysis compared to log-normalization given the heterogeneity of the tissue and the very high variance in counts across the spots.\nSubscription Required.
