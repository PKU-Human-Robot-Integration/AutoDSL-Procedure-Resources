  "procedures": [
    "Choice of optical clearing protocolSeeDB2G (RI = 1.46): SeeDB2G is optimized for glycerol-immersion lenses to achieve the highest resolution, but water- and multi-immersion objective lenses are also useful with reasonable resolution. SeeDB2G is useful for larger tissues due to lower viscosity.SeeDB2S (RI = 1.52): SeeDB2S is optimized for high-NA oil-immersion objective lenses. Since SeeDB2S is viscous and oil-immersion lenses typically have a short W.D. (0.1-0.2 mm), we recommend using relatively thin samples (< 300 μm thick slices) for SeeDB2S.In this protocol, we describe the protocol for high-resolution/super-resolution imaging of mouse brain slices. However, SeeDB2 is also useful for high-resolution imaging of other organisms (e.g., Drosophila), other organs and sample types (mouse oocytes), cultured cells, and frozen sections. See the original paper (Ke et al., 2016) and SeeDB Resources[href=https://sites.google.com/site/seedbresources/seedb2-protocol] for details.Note: SeeDB Resources (https://sites.google.com/site/seedbresources/[href=https://sites.google.com/site/seedbresources/]) provide updated information from the authors, see Ke et al., 2014.Choice of objective lenses and slice thicknessBecause of the working distance limitations in high-NA lenses, only one-fourth to half of the depth accessible by 20x lens can be reached by 63x or 100x lenses. Be sure to select neurons located close to the surface. See Table 1 showing examples of objective lenses used for confocal imaging.Table 1. Examples of objective lensesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015202816_7578.jpg+, optimal; ±, non-optimal; -, not suitable. Data based on Leica and Zeiss objective lenses.SeeDB2G (Figure 2)Dissect the mouse brain after an intracardiac perfusion of 4% PFA in PBS. Post-fix the brain sample in 4% PFA at 4 °C with gentle shaking overnight.Wash the sample in PBS three times with gentle shaking (10 min each).Embed the sample in 4% low-melting point agarose/PBS with desired orientation and then cut the brain with a vibratome.Transfer the sample into the permeabilization solution and incubate with shaking overnight (> 16 h) at 4 °C.",
    "Antibody staining and counterstaining should be performed prior to the clearing process. Optional: Perform antibody staining in 3 ml using 5 ml Eppendorf tubes on a rotator. After blocking with blocking buffer (0.5% skim milk, 0.25% fish gelatin, 2% saponin in PBS) for 24 h at 4 °C, incubate samples with primary antibodies in washing buffer (2% saponin in PBS) for 24 h. After three washes with washing buffer, incubate samples with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 12-16 h. Wash samples three times (2 h each) in washing buffer. Note: We recommend 2% saponin for thick mouse brain samples; however, for the thinner slices, lower concentrations of Triton X-100 are also workable. Antibodies are able to penetrate up to 200-300 μm in depth. Transfer the sample into a new tube filled with solution 1 and place it on a rotator. Incubate for 6-10 h for whole-mount samples, 2-4 h for slice samples (200-500 μm).Transfer the sample into a new tube filled with solution 2 and place it on a rotator. Incubate for 6-10 h for whole-mount samples, 2-4 h for slice samples (200-500 μm).Transfer the sample into a new tube filled with SeeDB2G with saponin and place it on a rotator. Incubate for 6-10 h for whole-mount samples, 2-4 h for slice samples (200-500 μm). An example of transmission images is shown in Figure 4.Notes: Do not store samples in solutions containing saponin. For thin slice or neonate samples, prolonged incubation (> 24 h) in solutions containing saponin may cause damage to the sample. Store the sample in SeeDB2G (without saponin) till mounting and imaging.SeeDB2-cleared samples can be stored in Eppendorf at 4 °C for up to 6 months. Sodium azide (0.05%) should be added for the long-term storage.",

    "Graphic protocol for SeeDB2Imaging chamber preparation and sample mounting (Video 1 and Figure 3)(Optional) Stand the sample in SeeDB2G/S for 2-4 h to remove the air bubbles.Note: If air bubbles are heavily accumulated in the tube, transfer the sample to a new tube filled with SeeDB2G/S and incubate it for 2-4 h. Cut the silicone rubber sheet into appropriate size using scissors or a utility knife.Remove the protection sheets (stuck to both sides, only found in 0.2 mm silicone sheet) and press the sheet onto the glass slide. Push the rubber sheet to remove air bubbles between the glass slide and the rubber sheet.Leave a drop of SeeDB2G/S (from the storage tube, not a fresh one) into the chamber, and pick up the brain slice with a perforated spoon and a paint brush to mount the sample.Note: Do not place the brain slices onto a dry surface. Do not expose SeeDB2S solution or SeeDB2S-cleared samples to the air for long time (> 5 min). (Optional) Remove the air bubbles in the imaging chamber with a paint brush.Gently press the cover glass onto the imaging chamber and use the spillover of SeeDB2G/S to seal the cover glass. See Figure 3 for mounted samples on a glass slide.Note: Do not use nail polish to seal the sample. The excess amount of SeeDB2G/S will form a tight film after air drying. Use an appropriate immersion media for high-resolution fluorescence imaging. Use glycerol (Refractive index = 1.46) for SeeDB2G, and oil (Refractive index = 1.52; Type F) for SeeDB2S. SeeDB2G/S cannot be used as an immersion media. Figure 5 shows an example of confocal images. Figure 6 shows super-resolution images (Airyscan and STED).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Imaging chamber preparation and sample mounting. Cut a silicone rubber sheet (1 mm-thick and 0.",
    "2 mm-thick are shown in this video) into an appropriate size with scissors or a utility knife. A silicone rubber sheet will adhere to a glass slide, by removing air between the rubber sheet and the glass slide. Mount cleared samples (cleared samples are often difficult to find) using a perforated spoon and a paint brush. Use No. 1.5H coverslips to seal the samples.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015202542_8343.jpgFigure 3. Slice sample ready for imaging. A 220 μm brain slice was mounted within the imaging chamber. A silicone rubber sheet (0.2 mm thick) was used for the spacer, and a coverslip is placed to seal the sample. The silicone rubber sheet will adhere to the glass slide and coverslip without adhesive. The spill-over of the SeeDB2G/S will form a tight film after air drying.Anticipated Results (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015202629_0665.jpgFigure 4.
