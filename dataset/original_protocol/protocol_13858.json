    "Experiments presented in this paper are performed according to the German law and to the European animal care guidelines. The animals are bred in the animal facility of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Science, University Hospital Aachen, Germany, under supervision of Prof. Dr. R. Tolba and Dr. A. Teubner (animal welfare officer).\n1. Animal Care\nKeep the mice in a specialized care unit, ensuring proper access to food and specialized veterinary control and treatment. If the animals are moved or purchased from third parties, please ensure a one week accommodation period before undergoing the procedure.\n2. Hyperlipidemia Inducement\nFeed 6 - 8 week old, 18 - 20 g, female (optionally) ApoE-/- mice with an atherogenic diet (21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol, 19.5% casein, wt/wt) one week prior to the surgical procedure and continue the diet until the atherosclerotic plaque analysis is to be performed.\n3. Surgical Preparation\nAnesthetize the mice using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine by bodyweight and 10 mg/kg xylazine by bodyweight. Confirm proper anesthetization prior to surgery by the lack of reflexes and whisker movement. Place a small amount of sterile eye ointment in the eye to minimize drying.\nEnsure the maintenance of sterile conditions to avoid infections during surgery by using sterile materials and instruments.\nShave the mice in the ventral neck region. Disinfect the skin with betadine prior to incision. Make a 1 cm skin incision in the median region of the neck area, on top of the trachea.\nSeparate the two fat bodies to ensure a proper view over the tracheal region. Use retractors to hold the muscle layer and expose the carotid artery. If present, perform the blunt-dissection of the thin muscle layer covering the carotid artery.",
    "Use sharp curved forceps to separate the carotid artery from the vagus nerve and jugular vein. Thus, the bifurcation area with the internal and external carotid artery should be visible. Use 0.9% NaCl in order to avoid tissue dryness during the surgical procedure.\n4. Wire-Injury\nPlace a 7 cm long 0/5 silk suture under the carotid artery, proximal to the aortic arch. Make an open loop, ready to be closed at any time.\nPlace two 0/7 silk sutures (each 1.5 cm long) around the external carotid artery: one loop close to the bifurcation point, and one loop as distal as possible. Prepare them as an open loop, ready to be closed at any time.\nPlace one 0/7 silk suture (1.5 cm long) under the internal carotid artery. Prepare it as an open loop, ready to be closed at any time.\nPosition the mouse table with the mouse head towards the operator to ensure proper positioning for the guide-wire insertion during the denudation (Figure 1A).\nUnder the microscopic view, stop the blood flow through the common carotid artery by holding and pulling the ends of the 0/5 silk suture with hemostat forceps.\nImmediately after the common carotid artery ligature, close the suture loops placed on the internal carotid artery and the distal suture on the external carotid artery tightly (Figure 1B).\nPerform a small incision (arteriotomy, half of the vessel diameter) distal to the external carotid artery, between the two loops, using small scissors (Figure 1C). If the incision is too big, please follow the troubleshooting instructions (see the Discussion).\nUse commercially polished guide wires or use in-house specialized personnel to polish the guide wires. Disinfect the 14 inch polished flexible guide-wire with alcohol and moisten it in a droplet of 0.9% NaCl to ensure proper sliding into the vessel.",
    "Insert the guide-wire into the common carotid artery via the transverse arteriotomy of the external carotid artery (Figure 1D). Obtain endothelial denudation by passing the guide wire along the vessel while rotating. Repeat this procedure three times. Maintain the same amplitude of rotational movement in each mouse to increase the reproducibility.\nClose the proximal loop on the external carotid artery tightly. Restore the blood flow in the carotid artery by cutting the suture around common artery and the suture around the internal carotid artery.\n5. Suture and Recovery\nRemove the retractors and return the muscle layer and the two fat bodies to the physiological position.\nClose the skin with three separated sutures 0/6, if echocardiographic measurements are needed. If no imaging is needed, use metallic clips to close the skin.\nLay the mouse down on its left side under the infrared light until it wakes up. Do not leave an animal unattended nor in the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nFor future identification, mark the mouse using the local system. Ask the animal welfare officer from the local institution.\n6. Analysis of the Atherosclerotic Plaque\nAnesthetize the mice at the end-time point using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine by bodyweight and 10 mg/kg xylazine by bodyweight. Confirm proper anesthetization by the lack of reflexes and whisker movement.\nPerform exsanguination by retro-orbital or cardiac puncture and collect the blood for further analysis2.\nDisinfect the skin with betadine. Open the thoracic cavity and remove the right auriculum of the heart. Perfuse phosphate buffered solution through left ventricle to remove the remaining blood from the vessel and then perfuse 4% PFA to fix the tissue.",
    "If no fixation is required, explant the carotid artery immediately after washing2,4,11. Perform standard protocols with analyses of interest: paraffin embedding, cryosection, mRNA or protein analysis, etc.\nFor morphometrical measurements, carefully explant the carotid artery including the bifurcation, with minimal manipulation, as proximal to the aortic arch using curved forceps and small scissors.\nEmbed the carotid artery in the paraffin block using standard embedding protocols. To perform transversal sectioning, place the carotid artery upright on bifurcation. Cut 5 Âµm thick serial sections starting with the bifurcation and collect them all on coated histological slides (Figure 2A).\nStain every 10th section using Movat staining to highlight the laminas2,4,11. After collecting microscopic pictures of all vessels (using a 10X objective), measure the lumen, as well as the internal and external lamina for each section, using special designed software2,4,11, as shown in Figure 2B. Calculate the intimal growth and media of the vessels.\nAnalyze smooth muscle cells and macrophage content, or endothelial recovery in serial sections, using usual immunohistological staining2 (Figure 2C)."
