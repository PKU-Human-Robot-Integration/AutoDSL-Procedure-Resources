    "This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation LANUV Recklinghausen (#84-02.04.2016.A374). Generally, this procedure is performed on adult mice >10 weeks of age. However, it is possible to perform this surgery on younger animals as well. Surgical tools must be sterilized before use and all steps are to be performed under aseptic conditions.\n1. Induction of Anesthesia and Intubation\nInject buprenorphine 0.1 µg/g body weight intraperitoneally for pain relief. Repeat the intraperitoneal injections of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine every 8 h for the next three days after surgery.\nFor induction, place the mouse into an anesthesia induction box which is connected to the vaporizer set to 3.0 Vol% of isoflurane with an oxygen flow of 1 L/min.\nEnsure deep narcosis by inducing a tactile stimulus.\n\tNOTE: Increase Vol% of isoflurane up to 5%, if anesthesia induction fails or narcosis is not deep enough.\nPinch the tail of the mouse to ensure reflex absence. In case of complete absence of reflexes, weigh the mouse for optimal ventilator setup (see 1.12).\nMove the mouse to a temperature-controlled operating table to maintain a body temperature of 37 °C throughout the procedure.\nPlace the nose of the mouse in a plastic cone which is connected to the anesthesia induction box to maintain narcosis.\nFix the upper incisors of the mouse with a nylon suture. Fixate the extremities with an adhesive tape.\nApply pressure on the hind paw with the tip of the forceps to ensure an adequate narcosis again. In the absence of a withdrawal reflex proceed with the following steps.\n\tNOTE: Increase volume % of isoflurane if anesthesia induction fails or narcosis is not deep enough and wait for the absence of the withdrawal reflex.\nPlace sterile ophthalmic lubricant on the corneas to prevent desiccation under anesthesia.",
    "Lubricate the rectal probe to avoid rectal trauma. Insert a rectal temperature probe to ensure a core temperature of 37 °C.\nDepilate the throat and the upper chest with depilatory cream according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wipe off the cream after 1 min. If necessary, repeat this step until successful.\n\tNOTE: Use cotton-tipped swabs in case of bleeding.\nClean the depilated area with 70% ethanol. Then apply povidone-iodine for local skin disinfection 3 times and for at least 3 min.\nAdjust ventilator settings to physiological parameters. Set the respiratory rate to 150/min and tidal volumes to 8-10 µL/g body weight (BW).\nPut on a new pair of sterile gloves. Place the mouse under a surgical microscope and place a sterile fenestrated drape over the mouse.\nIncise the skin at the midline about 3 mm under the mandibular down to the 2nd rib. Identify midline and connective tissues of the submandibular gland. Then use angled intracapsular forceps to gently divide the gland at the midline bluntly with two forceps and explore the tracheal muscle.\nPrepare the trachea gently by pulling the para-tracheal muscles apart bluntly with intracapsular forceps.\nPull on the tongue with forceps to straighten the throat for easier intubation conditions and gently insert an intubation cannula (OD 1.2 mm) inside the trachea. Confirm the intubation by direct visualization of the tube inside the trachea and by checking for proper chest movement.\nAdjust the isoflurane concentration after intubation to 2% isoflurane with a flow of 1.0 L/min and 100% O2.\n\tNOTE: If breathing movements do not stop or mice start moving, first increase the respiratory rate up to 180/min. If necessary, increase the isoflurane concentration up to 3.5% secondarily until the mouse stops breathing on its own. Evaluate leakages or inadequate filling of the vaporizer as the most common problems.",
    "Alternatively, perform intubation as suggested in the following sub steps.\n\t\nPosition the mouse on a table at a 60° angle.\nFixate the extremities of the mouse with adhesive tape and recline the head.\nPlace a cold-light source directly on the skin above the larynx.\nPull the tongue gently with forceps to visualize the vocal chords.\nInsert a plastic tube of an IV-cannula (24 G) through the vocal chords and connect the plastic tube to the ventilator settings.\nConnect the ventilator to the cannula to confirm intubation by synchrone chest movements.\n\t\tNOTE: If breathing movements do not stop or mice start moving, first increase the respiratory rate up to 180 per min. If necessary, increase secondarily the isoflurane concentration up to 3.5% until the mouse stops breathing on its own. Evaluate leakages or inadequate filling of the vaporizer as the most likely problems.\n2. Preoperative Doppler Measurement\nPrepare both carotid arteries which lay adjunct to the trachea by gently pulling the connective tissue apart with forceps.\nPlace the tip of the 20 MHz Doppler probe with some sterile ultrasound gel on the right and the left carotid artery at an angle less than 45°.\nSlowly rotate the probe to move it lateral and medial to find a Doppler signal and tilt the probe to optimize the signal.\nUse a Doppler software to display and store flow velocities in the right and left common carotid arteries on a computer.\n3. Thoracotomy\nUse a set of sterile gloves for each individual mouse to prevent surgical site infections.\nExpand the skin incision down to the 2nd intercostal space with a scissor.\nIdentify the 2nd intercostal space visually by counting the ribs and then bluntly penetrate this space with intracapsular forceps.",
    "NOTE: The 1st rib is located under the clavicle and is therefore not visible because the 2nd intercostal space is found between first visible rib (i.e. 2nd rib) and the 3rd rib.\nOpen the 2nd intercostal space with the help of forceps tips and insert the retractors.\nAdjust the retractors with a rubber band attached to the operating table to have a clear view of the thymus.\nIn case of bleeding use a cotton-tip and press on the superficial vessels for 2 min.\n4. Banding of the Transverse Aorta\nAdjust the magnification to 200% to identify midline and connective tissues. Then use angled forceps to gently divide the thymus. Remove fatty tissue until the aortic arch can be seen clearly.\nPrepare a tunnel with angled tying forceps under the transverse aorta between the brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery (see Figure 1). Hold the end of a 6.0 suture with the help of fine forceps and pass the thread under the aortic arch.\nTake the thread with the second forceps from the other side of the arch.\nCut off a 3-mm long piece length of a 27 G to use the needle as a the spacer for TAC-ligation for mice weighing between 19 - 25 g body weight and a 26 G needle as a spacer for mice >25 g BW.\nCarefully place the spacer parallel to the transverse aorta.\nPrepare a loose double knot on the spacer and ensure optimal placement of the spacer in parallel to the aorta. Then tie the first throw and quickly perform a second contrary throw. Remove the spacer promptly.\nTo perform sham mice for control, follow the same protocol omitting the ligation of the aorta.",
    "Close the 2nd intercostal space with a 6.0 polypropylene suture. Pay special attention to the subclavian vessels when ligating.\nSuture the skin using a 6.0 polypropylene suture in a continuous suture pattern.\n5. Confirmation of Successful Ligation of the Transverse Aorta\nPlace a 20 MHz Doppler probe on both sides of the neck at a 45° angle as in section 2.\nDocument the flow velocities on each side.\n\tNOTE: A successful TAC can be validated by Doppler flow velocity as shown in Figure 2. A flow velocity ratio of 4 - 10 between the right and left carotid artery usually guarantees adequate TAC (see Figure 2).\n6. Heart harvest\nInduce narcosis according to steps 1.2. and 1.3.\nPlace the mouse in an euthanasia chamber and adjust the carbon dioxide flow rate to displace 10 - 30% of the volume/minute.\nFixate the mouse on a surgery table. Open the abdomen with scissors and harvest blood from the inferior vena cava with a cannula for further analysis.\nCut the diaphragm and the sternal bone with strong scissors and remove the heart.\nRemove all arterial and connective tissue before weighing the heart.\nSeparate the right ventricle and the septum from the left ventricle and weigh both samples.\nFreeze both tissue samples in liquid nitrogen.\nSubscription Required.
