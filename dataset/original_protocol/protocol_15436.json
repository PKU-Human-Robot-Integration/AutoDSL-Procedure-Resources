    "1. Preparation of the Operating Area\nThe operating surface is first prepared by disinfecting the area with 70% ethanol.\nAll surgical instruments are to be sterilized with a hot bead sterilizer before surgery (and in between individual rat surgeries). These instruments include: surgical scissors (2), forceps (1), curved forceps (1), needle holder (2), and a chest rectractor.\nCotton gauze and applicators are to be available in order to manage bleeding.\nAdjust the temperature of a homeothermic blanket system (heating pad), to be used to maintain the body temperature of the animal at 37±1°C, in order to prevent a dramatic fall in body temperature; the size of an infarct is dependent on the duration of occlusion as well body temperature (Tarnavski et al.).\nPrior to anesthesia, each animal will receive a dosage of buprenorphine (0.1-2.5 mg/kg SQ) and carprofen oral tablets (Rimadyl, Bioserv tablet; 1 tablet) the day before the surgery. At the time immediately prior to the surgery, each animal will again receive a dosage of buprenorphine (0.1-2.5 mg/kg SQ).\nNote: For studies involving the assessment of cardiac function and cardiac remodeling over a period of time (7- to 28-days and beyond), a dosage of buprenorphine (0.1-2.5 mg/kg SQ) will be administered, every 6-hours after surgery for 24-48 hours post surgery and carprofen oral tablets will be provided once daily (see \"Post-Operative Recovery\").\n2. Preparation and Intubation of Rats\nPrior to the induction of anesthesia, animals will be examined to identify any pre-existing conditions that may complicate surgical outcome; physical examination will include visual inspection and measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature and body weight.\nIf the animals are determined to be healthy, 250-300 gram male rats (e.g. Sprague Dawley) will be weighed and identifying characteristics will be recorded.",
    "Rats are then anesthetized with 80 mg/kg of pentobarbital; the correct level of anesthesia is verified through the limb withdrawal response by applying pressure of the rat nail bed (toe-pinch reflex) and periodically throughout the procedure.\nBuprenorphine (0.1-2.5 mg/kg; SQ) will be administered at the time of surgery.\nAn electric shaver is then used to shave the fur form the neck and chest areas. Note: For studies involving the assessment of cardiac function and cardiac remodeling over a period of time (7- to 28-days and beyond), fur must be completely shaved away from the surgical area to maintain sterility.\nThe shaved areas are to be scrubbed and disinfected with betadine solution followed by wiping the area with 70% alcohol; this betadine and alcohol scrub and disinfection procedure is to be repeated three times.\nThe anesthetized animal is then placed in a supine position on a homeothermic blanket system (heating pad) in order to maintain body temperature.\nEndotracheal intubation is then performed by first carefully exposing the trachea, to enhance visualization of intubation, by making a 5 mm mid-neck incision and retraction of muscle tissue, just above the trachea. \nThis allows better visualization for insertion of the endotracheal tube (polyethylene size 90; PE 90) where the tubing is beveled on the edge for ease of entrance through the larynx.\nThe endotracheal tube is inserted into the trachea, with visualization aided by using a surgical stereo microscope, by carefully manipulating the tongue while viewing the trachea and the entrance of the endotracheal tube.\nMechanical ventilation is then achieved by connecting the endotracheal tube to Kent Scientific ventilator (TOPO Dual Mode) cycling at 80 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 1.2 ml per 100 gram body weight.",
    "A sterile drape is then placed over the rat, leaving only the surgical area exposed, thus minimizing potential contamination during the operation.  \nThe animal surgeon and assistants are to wear mask, gown, and gloves; with gloves being changed between individual rat surgeries.\n3. Transient Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Artery Ligation\nOnce steady breathing is established, the chest is opened at the left fourth intercostal space, by using hemostats or round end scissors to open the space, but without cutting the tissue so that the risk of bleeding can be reduced.\nA chest retractor is then positioned within the fourth intercostal space; in order to spread the ribs so that the left ventricle (LV) is exposed, taking maximal care not to damage the lung.\nThe pericardium is then opened, but left in place if possible.\nThe proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery will be identified (Figure-1), with the use of a surgical stereo microscope, and the LAD is then transiently ligated (or can be tied with a slipknot) using a 6-0 prolene suture for a 30-minute ischemic period (Figure-1), but without exteriorization of the heart.\nTo allow cardiac reperfusion, microsurgical scissors are used to cut the knot in the ligature (or by releasing the slipknot), made by the 6-0 prolene suture, 30-minutes following ligation of the LAD.\nIn sham control rats, the procedure is identical, except the LAD is not transiently ligated.\nThe outflow is then briefly (1-2 seconds) pinched off on the respirator to allow re-inflation of the lungs. \nThe chest retractor is then removed and the ribs are drawn together using a 2-0 prolene suture with an interrupted suture pattern. \nOnce the ribs are closed, the outflow of the ventilator is again briefly (1-2 seconds) pinched off to ensure proper breathing.",
    "The skin is closed using 6-0 prolene suture with a continuous suture pattern.\n4. Confirmation of Successful Ligation of the LAD Artery\nProper ligation of the LAD will be confirmed by observing blanching of myocardial tissue distal to the suture as well as dysfunction of the anterior wall; as observed during the transient LAD ligation. \nReperfusion will be verified by the return of red color to the myocardial tissue and the demonstration of some recovery of anterior wall motion; as observed immediately following the transient LAD ligation.\nNote:  For studies involving the assessment of cardiac function and cardiac remodeling over a period of time (7- to 28-days and beyond), an echocardiogram will be performed 24-hours post LAD ligation, in order to determine the extent of the induced myocardial infarction.  All animals with a left ventricular fractional shortening (LV FS) < 20%, as determined from an echocardiogram, as well as anterior wall motion dysfunction consistent with the infarct, will be identified and used for follow-up cardiac function and remodeling studies. Sham control rats are expected to have a normal LV FS between 40-45% (del Monte et al).\n5. Post-Operative Recovery\nOnce the surgery is complete, the sterile drape over the animal will be removed. The body temperature (by a rectal thermometer), respiratory rate (by visual inspection), heart rate (by palpitation), and abnormal signs of pain are to be monitored until the animal becomes ambulatory.\nThe rat will be removed from the ventilator and then be placed in an animal cage and allowed to recover from anesthesia. In this cage, one end of the cage will be warmed by a heating pad to allow the rat to seek warmth. Also, water will be available to the rat during this observation period.",
    "If signs of dehydration are observed after surgery, 0.5 ml of sterile saline will be injected intraperitoneally (IP). \nBuprenorphine (0.1‐2.5 mg/kg; SQ) will then be administered immediately after surgery, and during post-operative recovery.\nNote: For studies involving the assessment of cardiac function and cardiac remodeling over a period of time (7- to 28-days and beyond), a dosage of buprenorphine (0.1-2.5 mg/kg SQ) will be administered, every 6-hours after surgery for 24-48 hours post surgery. Carprofen oral tablets (Rimadyl, Bioserv tablet) will also be provided (1-tablet daily) for at least 48-hours post surgery.\n6. Histological Evaluation of the Ischemia Reperfusion\nFollowing completion of the 4-hour reperfusion period, rats are to be anesthetized again with 80 mg/kg of pentobarbital and the LAD is ligated once again (or the slipknot can be retied) (Huang et al and Kaiser et al).\n1 ml of 5 % Evan's Blue (in phosphate-buffered saline) is then injected into the right ventricular chamber and allowed to perfuse for 2-minutes.\nAfter 2-minutes, 1 ml of saturated potassium chloride solution is then injected into the right ventricular chamber in order to stop the heart from beating.\nThe heart is then rapidly excised, embedded in 2% agarose phosphate-buffered saline, and then sectioned in 1-2 mm slices.\nThe viable myocardium is then stained with 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 20-minutes and images of each slice is captured. The images are then quantified in order to identify the amount of myocardial area: (1) that is not-at-risk (blue sections), (2) area-at-risk (AAR; red and white sections), and (3) area that is infarcted (white \"unstained\" sections) (Figure-2).\n7. Representative Results",
    "For studies involving the assessment of infarct size and the area-at-risk (AAR), by Evan's blue dye and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), following 4-hours of reperfusion, proper ligation of the LAD can be confirmed by observing blanching of myocardial tissue distal to the suture as well as dysfunction of the anterior wall; as observed during the transient LAD ligation. Reperfusion can be verified by the return of red color to the myocardial tissue and the demonstration of some recovery of anterior wall motion; observed immediately following the transient LAD ligation. For studies involving the assessment of cardiac function and cardiac remodeling over a period of time (7- to 28- days and beyond), proper ligation of the ischemia followed by reperfusion can also be confirmed by blanching of the tissue, dysfunction of the anterior wall and the return of red color with some recovery of the wall motion following reperfusion. In addition, impaired cardiac function can be determined by an echocardiogram being performed 24-hours post LAD ligation, in order to determine the extent of the induced myocardial infarction.  All animals with a left ventricular fractional shortening (LV FS) < 20%, as determined from an echocardiogram, as well as anterior wall motion dysfunction consistent with the infarct, will be identified and used for follow-up cardiac function and remodeling studies. Sham control rats are expected to have a normal LV FS between 40-45% (del Monte).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2464/2464fig1.jpgFigure 1.
