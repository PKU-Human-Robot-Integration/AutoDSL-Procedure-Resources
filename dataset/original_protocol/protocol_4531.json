    "Warm media in 37 °C water bath.On a surgical bench, harvest the hind limb muscles; place all muscles from one hind limb in a 10 cm dish with 4 ml pre-warmed media (one mouse at a time, keep isolated muscles at 37 °C) (Video 1).Anesthetize mouse by isoflurane inhalation and sacrifice by cervical dislocation.Remove skin covering hind limb muscles.Sever the Achilles tendon and separate the gastrocnemius and soleus.Sever the distal tendons of the anterior compartment muscles including the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus, use a razor blade to separate from the tibia.Sever the quadriceps tendon, use razor blade to separate the quadriceps from the femur.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Hind limb muscle isolation  Mince muscles from one hind limb in the 10 cm dish with media using 2 razor blades into small pieces (1-2 plates at a time, keep all other samples at 37 °C).Once all muscles are minced, use forceps to transfer muscle pieces from each dish into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Pieces should stick together and be easily picked up as one or two aggregates and placed into the tube (Figures 1 and 2). Using a 5 ml pipet, collect the media from the dish and any muscle pieces that were not picked up with forceps and add it to the 15 ml centrifuge tube.Wash the plate with 5 ml media and add it to the 15 ml centrifuge tube. Each tube now contains 9 ml media and the muscle pieces.Add 1 ml stock collagenase solution to reach a final volume of 10 ml of digestion media I.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150814/20150814013555_0606.pngFigure 1.

MincingPlace samples on a shaking water bath, warmed to 37 °C, at 175-325 rpm for 90 min.",
    "Alternatively, if a shaking water bath is not available, place samples in 37 °C incubator and mix contents manually by inverting the tube every 15-20 min. However, this is likely to reduce yield due to sub-optimal digestion. Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 10 ml digestion media II.Briefly vortex samples and return to the 37 °C shaking water bath at 200 rpm for 30 min.Pipet up/down to break up muscle pieces and pass each sample through a 10 ml syringe with 20 G needle 10 times to further release all mononuclear cells into suspension. No visible muscle pieces should remain once completed.Transfer samples to a 50 ml centrifuge tube, washing each 15 ml centrifuge tube 2 times with 12 ml media.Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant, resuspend samples in 10 ml media and pass through a 70 μm cell strainer atop a fresh 50ml centrifuge tube; wash the original tube 2 times with 12 ml media.Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant, resuspend samples in 600 μl media and transfer to 15 ml centrifuge tube, then wash the original tube with 400 μl media. Samples from both legs can be combined into one tube at this step such that the sort sample contains cells from all muscles of one mouse in 2 ml media.",
    "Add 10 μl cell suspension from the 2 ml sort sample in 500 μl media and the following volumes of antibody to separate 5 ml FACS tubes for single color controls:No antibody (unstained control)1 μl FxCycle Violet stain (DAPI)1 μl α7-integrin/PE or FITC4 μl CD34/Alexa Fluor 6471 μl biotin CD45Add the following volumes of primary antibodies to together the original 2 ml sort samples:5 μl biotin CD4510 μl biotin CD11b10 μl biotin CD3110 μl biotin Ly-6A/E-Sca1Gently vortex samples and incubate on ice for 20 min.Add 10 ml chilled media to sort samples or 3 ml FACS buffer to single color controls.Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant, resuspend sort samples in 1.5 ml media or single color controls in 500 μl FACS buffer.Add 1 μl streptavidin APC-Cy7 to the biotin CD45 single color control and incubate on ice for 20 min.Add the following secondary antibodies to sort samples (microbeads first, then remaining antibodies):150 μl streptavidin microbeads10 μl α7-integrin/PE or FITC30 μl CD34/Alexa Fluor 64710 μl streptavidin APC-Cy7Gently vortex samples and incubate on ice for 20 min.Add 10 ml chilled media to sort samples or 3 ml FACS buffer to the biotin CD45 single color control.Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Pre-load LS columns (one for each sample) for depletion with 3 ml media.Aspirate supernatant, resuspend sort samples in 1 ml media or the biotin CD45 single color control in 500 μl FACS buffer.Load each sort sample onto an LS column placed on a MACS magnetic separator, washing the original centrifuge tube 2 times with 3-4 ml media (keeping samples on ice as much as possible).Centrifuge samples at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Aspirate supernatant, resuspend sort samples in 2 ml FACS buffer transferred to 5 ml FACS tubes and add 2 μl FxCycle Violet stain (DAPI) to each sample.Keep on ice until ready for sorting on a BD Biosciences FACSAria cell sorter (Figure 3).a.Cell should be sorted at 20 psi through a 100 μm nozzle.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150814/20150814013841_2165.jpgFigure 3.
