    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with local guidelines in the UK and USA. Experiments conducted at the University of Liverpool were performed under a license granted under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were approved by the University of Liverpool ethics committee. All animal experiments conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparing the FITC-sinistrin\nPrepare 40 mg/mL FITC-sinistrin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: Aliquots can be stored at -20 °C for several months with no noticeable decrease in quality; however multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. FITC-sinistrin is light sensitive - keep the tube protected from light.\nCalculate the volume of FITC-sinistrin required for each mouse:\n\t\nWeigh each mouse on each day of measurement.\nThe recommended dose is 0.15 mg FITC-sinistrin per gram body weight.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nPrepare separate cages for the mice while undergoing GFR measurements. Provide absorbent paper towels and a few pellets of food.\n3. Removing Hair from the Mouse (1-2 days before GFR Measurement)\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane, and once the mouse is asleep, maintain anesthesia with 1.5–2% isoflurane, depending on the breathing rate of the mouse. Place the mouse prone on a heat pad.\nUse an electric shaver, going against the direction of the fur, to remove most of the fur from one side of the mouse’s back. Shave from the top of the hind legs up to the neck, and across the ribs.\nApply a thin layer of depilation cream to the shaved area using a cotton bud (Figure 1A). Move the cotton bud against the direction of the fur to ensure that the cream is applied as close to the skin as possible.",
    "Remove the cream after 1–3 min by washing it off with cotton swabs and warm water. Do not perform the measurement if the skin appears very red and irritated after measurement, and do not repeat depilation within 72 h to avoid damaging the skin.\n4. Preparing the Transdermal GFR Monitor\nUse one of the two sizes of patches that are available. The first is 2.5 x 3 cm2 in size and can be used for measurements in mice directly. The other patches are 6 x 3 cm2 in size and are meant to be used in rats or larger animals but can be cut to a smaller size for use in mice.\nPeel the backing off one side of the patch and stick the GFR device on the adhesive side, positioning the LEDs exactly above the clear window.\nCut the excess adhesive patch to fit the size of the battery and stick one side of the patch to the battery.\n5. Attaching the Transdermal GFR Monitor\nAnaesthetize the mouse with isoflurane as described in step 3.1 and place the mouse prone on a heat pad. Anesthetize mice only for placement of the transdermal GFR monitor and injection of FITC-sinistrin; allow to recover from anesthesia for the measurement of FITC decay.\nClean the pre-shaved skin with 70% ethanol. Place approximately 12 cm of hypoallergenic silk tape under the mouse (Figure 1B; the width of the tape should be reduced to 1.5–2 cm so that it is not too wide for the mouse).",
    "Position the tape so that only approximately 2 cm is on the mouse’s right side, and the rest is on the left. Fold over one edge of the right side of tape for easy placement and removal after the measurement. The left-right instructions for steps 5.3 and 5.6 are for device placement on the right side of the animal and can be swapped for device placement on the left side of the animal if required.\nConnect the battery to the device, remove the backing from the battery and securely place it on top of the device. The device is ready to use and data acquisition starts when the blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) start blinking.\nRemove the backing from the device and place on to the shaved skin. Position the device such that the window exposing the LEDs is over the ribs – do not have it too close to the spine or limbs (Figure 1C).\nSecure the device with the white tape. Secure the right side first (Figure 1D), wrapping it tightly around all edges of the device, then wrap the left side around the mouse and device (Figure 1E). Ideally, the left side of the tape only covers the device, and the right side ends under the mouse’s abdomen.\nAttach the tape by pressing it alongside the circumference of the mouse’s body. The tape needs to be attached firmly, but not tightly. If it is too loose then the device will move around too much and cause movement artefacts. However, it should not be so tight that it restricts breathing or movement or puts too much pressure on the skin.",
    "Leave the device untouched for 3 minutes before the FITC-sinistrin injection to allow a steady background reading to be taken. In this time, warm the tail with a heat pad or glove filled with warm water to prepare for tail vein injection (if using this route).\n6. FITC-sinistrin Injection\nPrepare an insulin syringe with the calculated amount of FITC-sinistrin required for injection (this can be rounded to the nearest 10 μL).\nAdminister FITC-sinistrin by tail vein or retro-orbital injection. FITC-sinistrin should be administered in one smooth but rapid bolus to avoid multiple peaks on the clearance curve. It is better to administer only a partial dose than to have multiple attempts at administering the FITC-sinistrin.\n7. Measuring the GFR\nPlace the mouse in a cage on its own to recover from isoflurane anesthesia and for the duration of the measurement period.\nObserve the mouse in the cage for 1.5 h and then remove the device. Removing the device from the conscious mouse is fast, efficient, and generally well-tolerated by the mouse, but new users may prefer to anaesthetize the mouse for this step.\n\t\nAs one option, anaesthetize the mouse with isoflurane.\nAs the other option, place the mouse on the wire rack on top of the cage, allowing the mouse to grasp the metal bars whilst the device is removed.\nPull off the white plaster tape from underneath the belly in one quick, smooth movement, and remove the device and black plaster from the skin. Be careful that the battery does not disconnect from the device yet.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage.\n8. Reading and Evaluating the Data\nCarefully disconnect the battery from the device\nConnect the device to the USB cable and then connect the cable to the computer\nOpen the reading software (Sensor_ctrl_app.exe)",
