Additionally, we highlight important 3R considerations. Some authors suggest intravenous (i.v.) application of the monoclonal antibody cocktail (Bas et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We found the i.p. protocol to be favorable regarding handling for researchers and animals. In our view, the clinical course of RA is best mimicked by the i.p. method, as the disease onset is slightly slower and the peak less pronounced compared to the i.v. method, which is described to yield higher arthritis severity (Chondrex, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPlace mouse on metal grid (e.g., part of your cage) and allow the animal to gain traction with all four paws, while holding its tail as proximal as possible with your dominant hand (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Set-up before experiment initiation\nSyringes and needles should be provided according to the number of animals to be injected. Ice is used to thaw the CAIA antibody cocktail. Alcohol is used to disinfect surfaces and a spare cage is required as a recovery cage following injections. A standard cage for experimental animals should be equipped with nesting material, food and drinking water enriched with analgesic metamizole.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mouse handling for i.p. CAIA cocktail/LPS/PBS injection\n(A–E) (A) Hold mouse at the proximal tail with your dominant hand, (B) use your non-dominant hand with your thumb and forefinger to firmly grab the animal’s skin, (C) turn the mouse to a supine position and (D and E) inject CAIA cocktail/LPS/PBS i.p. into the lower right abdominal quadrant.\nGently pull back the tail to allow the mouse to hold onto the grid.",
    "Put your thumb and forefinger to the middle of the thoracic spine.\nCarefully apply pressure and move your two fingers toward the neck (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nGrab loose skin at the back of the neck between thumb and forefinger. Hold tail with little and ring finger (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: To ensure ideal handling grab as much skin as possible. By doing so, the abdominal skin will tighten and ease the injection process and reduce stress for mice.\nHold the mouse with the abdomen facing upwards in a 45° angle and the head towards the table. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Abdominal organs will move towards the diaphragm and an i.p. injection can now be performed safely.\nPerform injection.\nAim for the lower right abdomen with the needle directed towards the thorax in a 30°–40° angle to minimize risk of puncturing intestines (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nPerforate skin and slowly aspirate. Check syringe for aspirated liquid.\nOnly apply antibody cocktail if no liquids are aspirated.\nAfter application, wait 5 s and slowly remove needle and syringe.\nNote: We recommend 27–30 G needles, as these diameters are less likely to perforate intestines and hurt the animal, compared to larger needles.\nCritical: Keeping the animal’s head down as well as injecting the solution slowly with an angle of 30°–40° will prevent antibody cocktail reflux from the injection site. Make sure not to move the needle inside the abdomen.\nNote: Puncturing intestines may result in aspiration of green liquid, puncturing an abdominal vessel may result in aspiration of blood and perforating the bladder might lead to aspiration of urine. If any of this happens carefully withdraw and discard the syringe and refrain from a re-injection. Observe the animal for any signs of pain, illness, etc. during the following 48–72 h (UBC, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).",
    "Note: If antibody cocktail reflux occurs after removal of the needle and syringe and exceeds a small drop, you may consider a premature termination of the experiment for the affected animal. As the CAIA model is dose-dependent, the animal may develop less severe arthritis and obtained results are not reliable anymore.\nPut mouse in an extra cage to allow recovery until injections of other mice are completed.\nRelocate all mice to their original cages.\nFor LPS injection on day 3, follow the same instructions (steps 1.–6.) using 100 μg (=200 μL) of LPS instead of the antibody cocktail.\nNote: Avoid changing nesting material (this may include paper tissue, shredded paper, or if available SAFE® compact crinklets or alternative environmental enrichments) during the acute inflammatory arthritis phase (up to day 14). Mice with severe arthritis might not be able to build a new nest and rely on previously built nests. However, always consider hygiene aspects and potentially replace contaminated with pre-formed nests.\nDaily assessments\nTiming: day 0 until euthanasia\nIn this paragraph we elaborate on daily arthritis assessments including the clinical semiquantitative arthritis score, ankle size measurements and grip strength. For details on execution of these methods, please refer to (Maleitzke et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCheck health status and body weight (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Daily body weight assessment\nDaily assessment of body weight is conducted with a regular laboratory scale and glass container.",
    "Note: Following CAIA induction, mice are expected to lose weight until they reach the clinical peak of arthritis around day 8–12. Following LPS injection, mice can lose up to 20–30% of their body weight. Within 24–48 h mice should however start re-gaining weight. Mice with severe loss of body weight without rapid recovery (24–48 h) or signs of reduced overall well-being should immediately be checked by a veterinarian. If deemed necessary, the experiment must be terminated prematurely at this point.\nClinical arthritis assessment employing the semiquantitative arthritis score.\nGrab mouse as described in steps 1.–3. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).\nGive each paw a score between 0–3 based on swelling and erythema (Lee et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]):\n0: No swelling; 1: Mild to moderate swelling and erythematic ankle and/or 1 swollen digit; 2: Moderate swelling and erythematic ankle or swelling in 2 or more digits; 3: Marked swelling along all aspects of the paw or all 5 digits swollen.\nPlace the paw you are scoring on scale paper and apply gentle pressure.\nTake images for documentation (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Daily assessments of semi-quantitative arthritis score and ankle size measurements\n(A–F) (A) Place front and (B) back paws on scale paper to document arthritis severity. Measure (C and D) front and (E and F) back paws with a digital caliper at the maximum diameter of wrist and ankle. Scale bars 500 μm.\nNote: Placing the paw on scale paper while applying gentle pressure will cause the mouse to spread its digits, which allows an easy evaluation of each digit and the paw as a whole.\nQuantitative assessment of arthritis severity.\nGrab mouse as described in steps 1.–3. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).",
    "Carefully measure wrist and ankle thickness with caliper at maximum joint diameter of wrist/front paw (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D) and ankle/back paw (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F).\nNote: Pay attention not to injure the animal’s skin with the caliper. In our experience, measuring ankle and wrist size does often not create reproducible results. Due to the high inter-observer variance, it should only be conducted in addition to clinical arthritis scoring and repeated, if possible, to acquire a representative mean value.\nTo assess pain and functionality in forelimbs we use a grip strength test with a metal grasping grid (Bioseb, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nGrab the mouse by its proximal tail.\nPlace the animal on the metal grid only allowing its forelimbs to grasp the grid (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Daily assessment of grip strength\n(A) Grip strength assessment is conducted using a commercially available electronic device with a metal grasping grid for the mouse to hold on to with its front paws.\n(B) Gently pull the animal backwards horizontally until it lets go.\nGently pull the animal backwards horizontally until it lets go of the grid. Document the value indicated on the screen (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nRepeat measurements five times and calculate mean or maximum values.\nKeep mice in cages between measurements.\nNote: Placing all four limbs on the grid and performing grip strength tests is possible too. The grip strength test measures pain-induced functional impediments, therefore its reliability is reduced when using analgesics (Montilla-Garcia et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). This should be considered in your experimental design.\nJoint extraction\nTiming: day 10/48, 20 min/mouse",
    "In this section we introduce an overview of tissue harvesting, relevant to most murine arthritis experiments. Tissues are harvested at two different endpoints (day 10 and 48) which serves the purpose of analyzing (i) the acute inflammatory and (ii) the chronic resolution phase of arthritis.\nEuthanize mice depending on guidelines provided by your local animal welfare authorities.\nCarefully dissect all extremities.\nStrip left side limbs of all muscle and soft tissue.\nSeparate wrist, ankle, and knee joints. Leave joint capsules intact.\nSnap freeze joint samples in liquid nitrogen for further molecular analysis (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2030-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Schematic diagram for tissue harvesting and overview of clinical, radiological, and histological outcomes\n(A) Proposed distribution of joint and serum samples for radiological, histological, and molecular analyses.\n(B) Exemplified semi-quantitative arthritis score and grip strength over the course of 48 days when comparing wild type animals to a potential arthritis altering intervention.\n(C–E) Representative images of (C) arthritic ankle swelling on day 6 (white arrows), (D) loss of trabecular bone integrity of proximal tibiae in μCT on day 48 (white arrow), and (E) severe intra- and periarticular inflammation of knee joint sections (hematoxylin and eosin-stained) on day 10 (white boxes) following CAIA induction vs. control/sham. (B) created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com]. Scale bars 500 μm.\nStrip right side limbs from skin.\nSeparate and fixate right side wrist, ankle, and knee joints in paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% for 12–24 h at 4°C. (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nWash out and replace PFA with PBS before micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis, which is usually followed by embedding joint samples for histological assessment.",
    "Note: When removing skin and muscle, pay attention to not strip joints of periarticular tissue, as this may destroy the joint capsule and impair further results. Arthritis manifests peri- and intraarticularly, therefore it is advised to preserve these structures for all analyses.\nNote: To distinguish local from systemic arthritis effects on bone and cartilage, we suggest analyzing subchondral bone areas regarding local changes (e.g., talus) and trabecular bone areas (e.g., proximal tibia) for systemic bone alterations. We recommend assessing wrist, ankle, and knee joints as they have all been previously decribed extensively in numerous publications (Bendele et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Khachigian, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Lee et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Spies et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Tu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nNote: Besides harvesting joints and bones, it is recommended to extract blood (serum or plasma) for biomarker assessments through intracardiac puncture following euthanasia. Further tissues to be harvested may include muscle and visceral organs according to specific study objectives (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nPause point: Harvested tissues can be stored in PBS at 4°C for several days to weeks after PFA fixation for at least 12 h. Snap frozen and embedded tissues can be stored at −80°C for extended periods.\nNote: Avoid freeze–thaw cycles."
