    "1. Strains and Plasmids\nBacterial strains\nUse the E. coli strains BW251135, JW4179 (BW25113 tamA::kan)7, BL21(DE3)20, and BL21ΔABCF21. See Table of Materials for further information.\nBacteriophages\nUse the phage P1vir for the general transduction. Store the phage as a liquid stock with a few drops of chloroform (see step 2.2). For more information, see Table of Materials.\nPlasmids\nUse the following plasmids in this protocol: pCP2022, pIBA2-YadA23, and pEibD1024. As control plasmids, use pASK-IBA2 and pET22b (see Table of Materials).\nGrowth conditions\nPropagate bacteria in a lysogeny broth (LB) medium25 with vigorous shaking (180–200 rpm) at 37 °C or 30 °C in the case of BL21ΔABCF and strains containing pCP20.\nPerform plasmid curing at 43 °C.\nFor a solid medium, supplement LB with 1% agar (w/v).\nFor top agar, supplement LB with 0.7% agar and 10 mM CaCl2 and autoclave the medium. Use SOC medium for the recovery after electroporation26.\nUse the following concentrations for antibiotics: 100 μg/mL for Amp and 25 μg/mL for Kan.\n2. Preparing a Phage Lysate\nInfection of the donor strain\nGrow the donor strain JW4197 in 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 and optionally with Kan (25 µg/mL) to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ~1.0. Measure the OD600 value using a spectrophotometer.\nMake a dilution series of an existing P1 phage stock in the LB medium: recommended dilutions are between 10-3 to 10-7.\nMix 200 μL of the bacterial suspension and 100 μL of a given phage dilution in a 15 mL centrifuge tube or equivalent. Prepare as many tubes as phage dilutions. Incubate the tubes for 20 min at 37 °C without shaking.",
    "Add ~3 mL of molten top agar (~50 °C) supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 to the tubes, mix the contents thoroughly by vortexing the tubes shortly, and pour the mixtures onto prewarmed LB plates to make even layers.\nIncubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\nLysate preparation\nThe following day choose a plate with a semi-confluent growth of phage plaques. On a semi-confluent plate, approximately half the surface area of the plate is clear (Figure 3).\nScrape the top agar layer from such a plate using an inoculation loop or a similar tool and place the top agar in a centrifuge tube. Add 1–2 mL of LB and a drop of chloroform and vortex the tube vigorously for ~1 min. Add the chloroform in a fume hood.\nCentrifuge the tube for 15 min at 4,000 x g or faster to pellet the agar and bacterial cells.\nMove the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, avoiding carrying over any debris from the pellet. Add 2 drops of chloroform and store the lysate at 4–10 °C. Add chloroform in a fume hood. Do not freeze the phage lysate as this will result in a significant reduction of the number of infectious particles.\nDetermining the lysate titer\nGrow BW25113 in LB supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 at 37 °C till the culture reaches an OD600 of ~1.0.\nPrepare a dilution series of the phage lysate in LB (e.g., 10-6–10-9).\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful to pipet the sample from the top of the lysate to avoid transferring chloroform to the dilutions.\nMix 200 μL of the bacterial suspension and 100 μL of a given phage dilution in a 15 mL centrifuge tube or equivalent. Prepare as many tubes as phage dilutions. Incubate the tubes for 20 min at 37 °C without shaking.",
    "Add ~3 mL of molten top agar (~50 °C) supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 to the tubes, mix the contents thoroughly by vortexing the tubes shortly, and pour the mixture onto prewarmed LB plates to make even layers.\nIncubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\nThe following day count the number of plaques (clear regions in the bacterial mat) for each plate and calculate the titer of the lysate using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58267/58267eq1.jpg\n\t\tExample: On plates with the dilutions 10-7, 10-8, and 10-9, there are 231, 27, and 2 plaques, respectively. As 100 μL of each dilution was used for the infection, and because the titer is expressed as plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL, the plating factor is 10. These numbers are entered into the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58267/58267eq2.jpg\n\t\tThus, the titer is approximately 2 x 1010 infectious phage particles/mL.\n3. P1 Transduction\nPreparing the recipient cells\nGrow the recipient strain BL21ΔABCF in LB supplemented to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ~1.0. Use a spectrophotometer to measure the OD600 value.\nCalculate the volume of the phage lysate needed to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOI) value of 0.5. To calculate the MOI, estimate the number of bacteria based on the OD600 of the culture. Assume that an OD600 value of 1.0 corresponds to ~109 cfu/mL. Calculate the volume required based on the known titer of the lysate.\n\t\tExample (based on the titer calculated in the example after step 2.3.6):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58267/58267eq3.jpg\nAdd CaCl2 to the recipient strain culture to 10 mM and mix. Take 1 mL of the culture for transduction.\nPerforming transduction\nAdd the appropriate volume of phage lysate to 1 mL of recipient culture (including CaCl2 at 10 mM) as calculated in step 3.1.2 and mix gently.",
    "NOTE: Be careful to pipette the sample from the top of the lysate to avoid transferring chloroform to the mix.\nStatically incubate the mix for 20 min at 37 °C.\nStop the infection by adding sodium citrate, pH 5.5, to 100 mM.\nCentrifuge the bacteria (5,000 x g for 2 min) and remove the supernatant, then resuspend them in 1 mL of fresh LB supplemented with 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5.\nWash the cells twice more as in step 3.2.4 to ensure the removal of free phages and calcium.\nResuspend the bacteria in 1 mL of fresh LB supplemented with 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5. Incubate the bacteria at 30 °C for 1 h with shaking (> 100 rpm).\nCollect the bacteria by centrifugation (5,000 x g for 2 min) and resuspend them in ~100 μL of LB with 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5.\nSpread the bacteria on an LB plate supplemented with Kan at 25 µg/mL and 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and grow the bacteria at 30 °C until colonies appear (~24 h).\nSelecting the transductants\nOnce colonies have grown on the selection plate, restreak them on LB + Kan for single colonies and grow at 30 °C till single colonies appear.\n4. Excising the Kan cassette\nThe transformation with recombination plasmid\nMake the Kan-resistant BL21ΔABCF strain electrocompetent.\n\t\t\nGrow the strain from a single colony in fresh LB (5 mL) supplemented with Kan (25 µg/mL) at 30 °C until the OD600 is ~0.5–0.7.\nFrom here on, carry out the following steps at 4 °C or on ice. Centrifuge the bacteria (5,000 x g for 10 min) and remove the supernatant.",
    "Wash the cell pellet with ice-cold distilled water twice by repeating the previous centrifugation step and, finally, resuspend cell pellet in 100 µL of ice-cold 10% glycerol.\nCool down 1 mm electroporation cuvettes on ice.\nAdd 1 pg of plasmid DNA (pCP20) to the cell suspension, mix the suspension gently, and transfer it to a cooled electroporation cuvette.\nSet the electroporator to 1.8 kV and electroporate the cells.\nRescue transformed cells by adding 1 mL of SOC medium and growing them for 1 h at 30 °C.\nPlate 100 µL of the cells on LB + Amp plates and grow the cells at 30 °C overnight.\nInduction of the recombination\nPick single colonies from the LB + Amp plate and inoculate fresh LB omitting all antibiotics.\nGrow the cells at the non-permissive temperature (43 °C) overnight to induce the expression of FLP recombinase.\nSelecting recombinants\nMake serial dilutions and plate 50 µL of a 105-106 dilution on non-selective plates and grow it overnight at 30 °C.\n5. Verification of the Gene Deletion\nVerification of the plasmid loss and successful recombination\nStreak single colonies from the plates prepared in step 4.3.1 on LB + Kan, LB + Amp, and LB plates without antibiotics, in this order. To aid in the streaking, use a colony grid (see Supplementary File 1). Grow the plates at 30 °C until colonies appear (~24 h).\nPick 10–20 clones that have grown on the non-selective plate but failed to grow on the selective media for further verification.\nAdditional verification by colony PCR \nPerform a colony PCR with primers flanking the tamA coding sequence (see Table of Materials).",
    "Prepare a master PCR mix. The amount of mix needed depends on the number of colonies to be tested (see the example in Table 1). Mix the reagents on ice, add the polymerase last.\nMix the PCR master mix thoroughly, then dispense 20 µL into tubes of a PCR strip. Pick a small amount of each colony to be screened using a sterile pipette tip and add it to a tube. Remember to include the original recipient strain for comparison. Optionally, also include the donor strain.\nRun a PCR reaction (see Table 2 for the program used).\nPrepare a 1% agarose gel.\n\t\t\nFor a 50 mL gel, measure 0.5 g of agarose and add 50 mL of TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Heat the mixture in a microwave oven until all agarose has dissolved.\nOnce the agarose has dissolved, cool the solution to approximately 50 °C, and then add 5 μL of DNA staining dye. Mix the solution well and pour it into a gel tray in a casting chamber. Insert one or more rows of well combs so that there are sufficient wells for all samples, as well as molecular size markers. Allow the gel to set for 30 min.\nOnce the PCR run is complete, add 4 µL of 6x DNA loading dye to each sample. Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber and add TAE buffer till the wells are covered.\nApply 10–15 µL from each PCR reaction to a well in the gel. Also add 5 µL of a molecular size marker. Then, run the gel for 30 min at 75 V.\nOnce the run is complete, image the gel using a blue-light imager.\n6. Other Techniques\nProtein expression",
    "NOTE: The expression of test proteins (YadA and EibD) has been described in detail elsewhere23,24. This is a brief summary of the main steps.\n\t\nTransform BL21ΔABCF ΔtamA with the necessary plasmids (pIBA2-YadA and pEibD10 and the corresponding control plasmids) and select for transformants on LB + Amp.\nFor the protein expression, inoculate 100 mL of LB medium + Amp with 1 mL of an overnight culture of transformed bacteria and grow these at 30 °C until mid-log phase, at which time, induce the protein production with either anhydrotetracycline (at 100 ng/mL) or isopropyl thiogalactoside (at 0.5 mM).\nAfter 2 h of induction at 30 °C, measure the turbidity of the cultures and collect a number of cells corresponding to 50 mL at OD600 = 1.0 by centrifuging the cultures for 15 min at 4,000 x g. Wash the pellet 1x with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and then either store it at -20 °C or process it further as in step 6.2.\nOuter membrane extraction\n\tNOTE: Outer membrane extraction is performed as described in detail by Leo et al.27. The main steps are summarized below.\n\t\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and MnCl2, lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL), and a pinch of DNase I.\nLyse the cells (e.g., using a bead beater).\nCentrifuge the cells shortly (2 min at 15,600 x g) to remove cell debris and move the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 30 min at 16,000 x g, after which, resuspend the pellet in 400 μL of 1% N-lauroyl sarcosine in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.\nIncubate the cells with agitation for 30 min at room temperature, after which, centrifuge them for 30 min as above.",
    "Wash the translucent pellet 1x with 200 μL of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and then resuspend it in 30 μL of 10 mM HEPES and add 10 μL of 4x SDS-PAGE sample buffer.\nActivity assays\n\tNOTE: Perform SDS-PAGE and activity assays for YadA and EibD as described28. The main steps are summarized below.\nSDS-PAGE\nHeat the samples at 50 °C for 5 min before loading them onto a polyacrylamide gel, to avoid denaturing the proteins.\nAfter the separation in SDS-PAGE, transfer the proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane.\nAfter the transfer, block the membrane with 2% skimmed-milk powder in PBS.\nYadA-collagen far-western blot\nAfter the blocking, add bovine collagen type I diluted in blocking buffer to a concentration of 10 μg/mL and incubate the membrane for 1 h.\nWash the membrane 2x with PBS + 0.05% Tween20 (PBS-T).\nAdd the primary antibody (monoclonal anti-collagen COL-1) to the membrane, diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer.\nAfter incubating the membrane for 1 h, wash 2x as mentioned in step 6.3.2.2 and then add the secondary antibody [goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate], diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer.\nIncubate the membrane for 1 h, then wash it 2x with PBS-T. Add an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate to the membrane according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detect the band using a CCD camera.\nEibD-IgG binding assay\nAfter the blocking, add a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit HRP), diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer.\nIncubate the membrane for 1 h, then wash it 2x with PBS. Perform chemiluminescent detection as mentioned in step 6.3.2.5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
