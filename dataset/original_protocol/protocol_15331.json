    "1. Preparing the shear stress modifier (cuff)\nThe shear stress modifier consists of two longitudinal halves of a cylinder with a cone shaped lumen. The half shells are made of thermoplastic polyetherketone produced by a plastic casting procedure. The cast elements are sent out while still connected to the runner. Hence, the half shells have to be cut off before usage. Each cast contains half shells of different sizes ranging from 150 μm - 300 μm (lowest inner diameter at downstream end).\nThe cuff preparation should be performed under a surgical microscope.\nHold the cuff half shell with blunt forceps and gently cut it off from the cast by using a sharp scalpel. This procedure will lead to half shell precursors which have to be further processed.\nPlace the half shell precursor on an even non-slippery plate; fix it with blunt forceps and cut it exactly along the preformed incision in order to remove the closed end. This will yield the cuff half shell ready for use.\nControl the half shells under the microscope and gently remove any remaining sharp edges. The conical inner lumen is essential for inducing different qualities of shear stress within, upstream and downstream of the implanted cuff. A groove on the outer surface of the half shells running perpendicular to the inner lumen serves as a guiding for the thread which finally sticks the half shells together to form the functional cuff.\nStore the cuff half shells, classified according to size, in 70% ethanol.\n2. Implanting the cuff around the right carotid artery",
    "ApoE knockout mice should be around 10 weeks of age and at a weight of at least 20 grams. If plaque development should be investigated under high cholesterol diet, starting such a western type diet 4 weeks prior the cuff implantation is recommended.\nThe whole surgical procedure should be performed under at least semi-sterile conditions: Wear a surgical gown, mask and cap and sterile gloves. Sterilize the instruments for 30 seconds in a bead instrument sterilizer and place them on a sterile opaque sheet. Beware! Instruments have to cool down before use!\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber filled with 3% isoflurane until it is completely anesthetized. Verify depth of anesthesia with response to toe pinch. Alternatively, anesthesia can be performed with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) or alternate anesthetics approved by the IACUC. For i.p. injection, hold the mouse in supine position and inject the anesthetic in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.\nPlace the mouse on a heated surgical plate, in supine position. In order to prevent the eyes of running dry moisten them with eye salve (e.g. Bepanthen eye and nose lotion). Spread the fore- and hind-paws and tape them down to the plate. If performing isoflurane anaesthesia, the narcotic gas flow (2% isoflurane) has to be supplied via a small rodent mask.\nRemove the hair between the mandible and the sternum by either applying depilatory agent (e.g. Pilca Med) or by using a fine electric shaver (e.g. Wella Contura). Shaving has to be performed with caution in order to avoid irritating the skin. If using a depilatory agent, give it 1-2 min for penetrating the hair, thereafter, gently rub until all hair and depilatory agent is removed.",
    "Have ready previously prepared cuff half shells of different sizes (two of each size) and a 2.5 cm-long piece of 6-0 silk suture for interconnecting the half shells at the site of carotid occlusion.\nDisinfect the operating field with liberal amount of Betadine. Use sharp small scissors to open the skin and the underlying fascia of the neck by a 4-5mm medial incision starting from the top of the sternum (manubrium).\nExpand the opening, shift the right parotid gland aside and insert a surgical spreader. Then bluntly dissect into the deep, just left of the trachea (from the surgeons view), where the right sternomastoideus muscle crosses the right omohyoid muscle, until you are able to identify the pulsating right common carotid.\nUsing very fine angled or curved forceps (e.g. Dumont #5/45), dissect the right common carotid artery by gently removing the surrounding connective tissue. Separate the carotid from the vagus nerve - the white, stringy object running directly along the carotid - as this step is necessary to completely expose the vessel. Be careful neither to harm the vagus nerve nor a branch of the left internal jugular vein, which is also in close connection to the carotid.\nIn order to choose the right cuff size, compare the diameter of the exposed carotid with the inner-diameter of the cuff half shells: The largest width of the cuffs lumen should meet the outer diameter of the carotid.\nNow, carefully put the tip of the forceps under the carotid, open the forceps, thread the piece of 6-0 silk suture under the carotid and form a loop. Between the loop and the carotid place one cuff half shell beneath the carotid. The side of largest narrowing has to be downstream.",
    "Place the second cuff half shell within the loop on top of the carotid.\nGently tighten the suture loop using suturing forceps and node the thread. By doing this the functioning shear stress modifier is formed. For the precise fitting of the cuff it is essential that the suture is running exactly within the preformed groove on the outer surface of the cuff.\nMove the right parotid gland back in its original position, approximate and close the skin either using a small amount of 6-0 prolene suture or, alternatively, you can use wound clips.\nInject a single dose of 5 mg/kg Carprofen (e.g. Rimadyl) subcutaneously to provide prophylactic pain treatment and place the mouse in a warming chamber until it recovers. Normally, this takes 30-60 min when using Ketamine/Xylazine anesthesia. When using isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia the recovery period is substantially shorter (10-20 min).\nIn our experience, animals regain normal unstressed activity within the first 24 hours after cuff implantation with the intervention being performed by an experienced surgeon. However, if the animal appears to be distressed even one day post-surgery, repeat the analgesic treatment and consult with veterinary staff.\n3. Explanting the cuff and the carotid arteries\nFor histological analysis the carotid arteries have to be harvested at the end of the observation period. Before starting explantation, the animal has to be killed according to IACUC guidelines.",
    "If the cuff half shells are intended for reuse, carefully remove all tissue fragments and the connecting suture from the plastic elements, dissecting from the carotid arteries, wash and store the half shells in 70% alcohol solution. One should keep in mind that the cuff is embedded in connective tissue adhesions after several weeks of implantation and that one has to dissect the cuff with caution in order not to harm the vessel walls.\nAlternatively, the cuff can be explanted and embedded together with the carotid artery. The plastic material of the cuff is resistant to normal fixation solutions and solvents used for paraffin embedding. Also, the embedded samples can be cut using a normal microtome equipped with normal blades.\n4. Representative Results\nThe cuff has to be placed always around one of the two common carotid arteries of an animal (Fig. 1A, 1B) - the contralateral side serves as a control. On the image presenting the two half shells of the cuff (Fig. 1B) the conical shape of the inner lumen is visible. This conical shape is essential for establishing the three regions with distinct flow dynamics. Typical shear stress patterns induced by the cast calculated from Doppler measurements 11 and the corresponding flow velocities based on phase-contrast velocity MR imaging 12 are given in Figure 2.",
    "When the cuff is implanted in ApoE knockout mice fed a western type diet the altered flow dynamics provoke shear stress induced atherosclerotic plaque deposition (Fig. 3): Upstream of the conical constriction low laminar shear stress leads to massive development of atherosclerotic plaques of a more vulnerable phenotype, characterized by lipid cores close to the central lumen covered only by a thin fibrous cap (Fig. 3A1). The conical inner lumen of the cuff leads to an increase in flow velocity. Nearly no plaque deposition is observed in this area. Directly downstream of the site of the bottleneck the immediate broadening of the artery results in an area of vortices and oscillatory flow parameters, which causes less extended plaque development of a more stable phenotype (i.e. less lipid cores which are localized more close to the media).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3308/3308fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The shear stress modifier - assembly and placement. (A) Schematic drawing of the implanted cuff: The cuff is placed around the right common carotid artery (RCCA) - the contralateral side (LCCA = left common carotid artery) serves as control. (B) In vivo MRI angiography in a mouse: In the maximum intensity projection of a three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography the conical constriction induced by the cast (white arrow) is visible (for details see 12). (H=head, F=feet, R=right, L=left). In the upper right corner a macroscopic view on the inner lumen and the outer surface of the cuff half shells is given. When assembled, two half shells form a conical cylinder which modifies the flow dynamics within the vessel in a defined way. To ensure the right fit, a groove on the outer surface of the cuff (yellow arrow) serves as a guiding for the linking suture.\n \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3308/3308fig2.jpg",

In the upper schematic illustration the different flow properties are indicated and the local approximate values for shear stress are given (based on Doppler measurements 11). Below, corresponding flow velocities for a single animal measured by MRI upstream of the implanted cuff are shown in a T1-weighted cross-sectional MRI-image of the neck (phase-contrast velocity imaging, for details see 12).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3308/3308fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Shear stress induced plaque development in ApoE knockout mice. The upper left corner shows the macroscopic view on the opened neck and exposed carotid arteries of an ApoE knockout mouse under high fat (western type) diet 8 weeks after implantation of a shear stress modifier around the right common carotid artery (RCCA). The opaque white region of the vessel (*) upstream of the cuff corresponds to a site of extensive atherosclerotic plaque deposition. The yellow arrow indicates the thread which combines the two cuff halves. In contrast, there are no signs of plaque deposition in the left common coronary artery (LCCA).",

The schematic illustration gives the corresponding planes (dotted lines) where the sections were located. (A) Upstream of the cuff atherosclerosis leads to massive plaque deposition. Large lipid cores (red arrows), which in part are located close to the central lumen (detail A1) characterize the vulnerable character of these plaques. (B) At the plane of the cuff bottleneck nearly no plaque development is obvious, whereas directly downstream of the cuff (C) oscillatory flow leads to moderate plaque development of a more stable type (i.e. less or no lipid cores).
