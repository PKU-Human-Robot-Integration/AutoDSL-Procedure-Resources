    "These protocols follow the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\n1. Conventional Corneal Collagen CXL (C-CXL)\n1. Preparation of the Patient\n5 days before the surgery, put 1% pilocarpine drops twice a day in the treated eye.\nIn the operating room, in aseptic conditions, lie the patient on his/her back.\nAdminister topical anesthesia such as oxybuprocaine 0.4%.\nClean the eye and the skin around the eye with iodine antiseptic twice.\nUse a lid speculum to keep the eye open.\n2. Epithelial Removal\nMark the central 9.0 mm of the cornea with a circle corneal marker.\nRemove the central 7.0 to 9.0 mm of corneal epithelium by mechanical debridement using a blunt spatula.\n3. Riboflavin Application\nApply 0.1% riboflavin with 20% Dextran on the cornea every min for 20 min.\n4. UVA Irradiation\nIrradiate the cornea with a 370 nm wavelength UVA light at an irradiance of 3 mW/cm2 (5.4 J/cm2 surface dose) and at a 5 cm working distance for 30 min.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53119/53119fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: UVA irradiation in C-CXL. The cornea is irradiated with a 370 nm wavelength UVA light at an irradiance of 3 mW/cm2 (5.4 J/cm2 surface dose) and at a 5 cm working distance for 30 minutes.

End of the Surgery\nPut antibiotic drops (tobramycin 0.3%) and artificial tears (hyaluronate drops 0.18%) into the operated eye.\nPlace a soft bandage contact lens at the end of surgery until re-epithelialization is complete. Re-epithelialization usually takes 3 days.\nPrescribe analgesics such as paracetamol (500 mg) plus codeine (30 mg), 6 pills a day.",
    "After corneal re-epithelialization, initiate topical therapy with steroids (topical dexamethasone 1 mg/ml) and continue for 3-4 weeks. Plus, use artificial tears 4 times a day for 1 month.\n2. Accelerated Corneal Collagen CXL (A-CXL)\n1. Preparation of the Patient\n5 days before the surgery, put 1% pilocarpine drops twice a day in the treated eye.\nIn the operating room, in aseptic conditions, lie the patient on his/her back.\nAdminister topical anesthesia such as oxybuprocaine 0.4%.\nClean the eye and the skin around the eye with iodine antiseptic twice.\nUse a lid speculum to keep the eye open.\n2. Epithelial Removal\nMark the central 9.0 mm of the cornea with a circle corneal marker\nRemove the central 7.0 to 9.0 mm of corneal epithelium by mechanical debridement using a blunt spatula.\n3. Riboflavin Application\nApply 0.1% riboflavin without Dextran on the cornea every 2 min for 10 min.\n4. UVA Irradiation\nIrradiate the cornea with a 370 nm wavelength UVA light at an irradiance of 30 mW/cm2 (5.4 J/cm2 surface dose) and at a 5 cm working distance for 3 min.\nDuring the irradiation, add topical anesthesia (oxybuproca&#239;ne 0.4%) if necessary.\n5. End of the Surgery\nPlace antibiotic drops (tobramycin 0.3%) and artificial tears (hyaluronate drops 0.18%) into the operated eye.\nPlace a soft bandage contact lens at the end of surgery until re-epithelialization is complete. Re-epithelialization usually takes 3 days.\nPrescribe analgesics such as paracetamol (500 mg) plus codeine (30 mg), 6 pills a day.\nAfter corneal re-epithelialization, initiate topical therapy with steroids (topical dexamethasone 1 mg/ml) and continue for 3-4 weeks. Plus, use artificial tears 4 times a day for 1 month.\n3. Iontophoresis (I-CXL)\n1. Preparation of the Patient\n5 days before the surgery, put 1% pilocarpine drops twice a day in the treated eye.",
    "In the operating room, in aseptic conditions, lie the patient on his/her back.\nAdminister topical anesthesia such as oxybuprocaine 0.4%.\nClean the eye and the skin around the eye with iodine antiseptic twice.\nUse a lid speculum to keep the eye open.\n2. Position the Iontophoresis Device.\nApply the sticky passive electrode on the forehead under the operative field.\nApply the active electrode, a suction ring, to the open eye. Center the suction ring on the periphery of the cornea before releasing the suction.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53119/53119fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Iontophoresis device. The passive electrode is applied on the forehead under the operative field and the active electrode, a suction ring, is applied to the open eye.

Riboflavin Application\nFill the suction ring with hypoosmolar 0.1% riboflavin without Dextran.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53119/53119fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

UVA Irradiation\nIrradiate the cornea with a 370 nm wavelength UVA light at an irradiance of 10 mW/cm2 (5.4 J/cm2 surface dose) and at a 5 cm working distance for 9 min.\nDuring the irradiation, add topical anesthesia (oxybuproca&#239;ne 0.4%) if necessary.\n5. End of the Surgery\nPlace antibiotic drops (tobramycin 0.3%) and artificial tears (hyaluronate drops 0.18%) into the operated eye.",
