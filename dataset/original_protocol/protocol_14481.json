  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and the National Research Council's Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (IACUC) and has undergone approval by the Ohio State University IACUC committee.\n1. Initial Set-up\nSet-up the surgical microscope and the operating theater (Figure 3, Figure 4). Turn on all equipment including that for maintaining anesthesia and monitoring vital signs. Turn on the electrosurgical unit and warming pad. Position the infusion pump near the operating table.\n\t\nDraw up 10 mL of liquid isoflurane for inhalation (molecular weight 184.5) in the anesthesia syringe and place it in the anesthesia unit.\nSet-up a 200 mL container of liquid nitrogen near the operating table and another near the centrifuge where blood samples will be processed.\nPosition the surgical instruments, 4-0 and 7-0 braided silk suture, sterile cotton swabs, 4x4 non-woven sponges, 5 mL syringes, and 27 gauge insulin syringes near the operating table.\nPrepare the isoflurane chamber and ensure that sufficient isoflurane is instilled in the anesthesia induction delivery system.\n2. Induction of Anesthesia\nBefore handling the rat put on the following personal protective equipment (PPE): surgical mask, surgical gloves, and disposable gown.\nWeigh the rat and record the weight.\n\tNOTE: Sprague Dawley rats should be used.\nPlace the rat in the anesthesia chamber and turn on the isoflurane and the oxygen. Induce anesthesia using the isoflurane chamber.\nClip the animal's abdominal hair using an electric hair clipper to allow for cleaner exposure (Figure 5).\nPlace the animal back in the isoflurane chamber for an additional one minute. Perform a toe pinch to verify depth of anesthesia.\n3. Procedure\nPosition the rat with the animal's nose in the nose cone and four extremities immobilized with restraints or tape on the warming pad.",
    "Continue anesthesia using the anesthesia delivery system, nose cone and isoflurane with anesthesia at 3.6% for animals weighing between 200 and 250 g and 4% for animals weighing greater than 250 g. Confirm depth of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch and a skin pinch.\nMake a midline abdominal incision from pubis to xiphoid through the skin using sharp scissors (Figure 6).\nMake an incision in the peritoneum along the linea alba from pubis to xiphoid and enter the abdomen taking care not to damage the bladder or bowel. As the liver also sticks to the peritoneum anteriorly near the xiphoid process, ensure that it releases prior to incising the abdominal wall in this area.\nMake a transverse incision through the skin and the peritoneum at the level of the inferior border of the right lobe of the liver.\nTurn the anesthesia down to 1.6% for animals weighing between 200 and 250 g and 2% for animals weighing greater than 250 g.\nRetract the xiphoid process using a curved mosquito clamp.\nPlace rib retractors pulling the ribs as far apart as possible from the midline (Figure 7). Cut the falciform, phrenic and gastric ligaments. Flip the liver up using moistened sterile cotton swabs.\nCut additional ligaments as necessary to gain access to the porta. Perform visceral rotation with saline moistened gauze (Figure 7).\nRemove the loose connective tissue overlying the portal hilum using sharp or blunt dissection. Remove the loose connective tissue overlying the length of the portal vein.\nUse forceps to push through the loose connective tissue posterior to the left portal vein, artery and bile duct making a window and place 4-0 Potts suture but do not cinch down (Figure 8).",
    "Clear off the loose connective tissue overlying the posterior branch to the portal vein that comes in at approximately the level of the right kidney. This vein will be used for cannulation.\nDraw 0.5 mL of blood out of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with an insulin syringe (Figure 9). Place the 0.5 mL of blood in a small vial, centrifuge at 135 x g for 12 min. Attempt to draw off serum.\n\t\nIf a distinct line cannot be appreciated between red blood cells and serum, try to centrifuge for an additional 2 - 3 min at 135 x g. Draw off serum and place in a vial for alanine-aminotransferase (ALT). Snap freeze this specimen by placing it directly into liquid nitrogen.\nCut two pieces of 7-0 suture and place near the vein that will be used for cannulation. Place the first 7-0 loop around this vein as far medial as possible. Tie this loop and use it to retract using a curved mosquito clamp (Figure 10). Place a second 7-0 loop on the vein that will be used for cannulation near its intersection with the portal vein and place one tie, but do not cinch down.\nPrepare the infusion pump with a 5 mL syringe with 3 mL of reagent. Prime the tubing.\nClamp distal portal vein using a microsurgical clamp.\n\tNOTE: This will reduce bleeding when the vein is incised for cannulation.\nCut a 0.5 mm hole in the vein in between the 7-0 stay suture and its intersection with the portal vein using small microsurgical scissors. Use 27-0 catheter to cannulate the left portal venous system (Figure 11, Figure 12). Insert the catheter past the bifurcation of the left and right portal veins.",
    "Check placement of the cannula by infusing 1 mL of normal saline and watch for the left lateral and median lobes of the liver to blanch. Manually confirm that catheter is past the take-off of the right portal vein, but not beyond the take-off of the portal vein feeding the median lobe.\nCinch down the Potts suture and start ischemia time. Tighten 7-0 suture around vein and 27-0 catheter to hold it in place and remove the clamp from the distal portal vein.\nStart the infusion of polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD, 0.00067 g/mL) using the infusion pump. Start the infusion as close as possible to the start of the ischemic time.\n4. Monitoring\nContinue to monitor the animal's vital signs throughout the infusion. Deliver 2 mL of 0.9% normal saline or 2 mL of PEG-SOD (0.00067 g/mL) dissolved in 0.9% normal saline over a period of 15 min.\n5. Reperfusion\nAllow one hour to pass from the beginning of the ischemic time. This is 1-h of warm ischemia time.\nRemove the Potts suture. Remove the 27-0 catheter. Cinch down the 7-0 suture around the vein. Note the time. This marks the time of reperfusion.\n6. Continued Sampling\nDraw 0.5 mL of blood out of the IVC at 120 min post-reperfusion. Draw the blood slowly to avoid lysing red blood cells. Slowly drip the blood into a vial. Ensure that bleeding from the IVC is controlled after each blood draw.\n\t\nIf there is continued bleeding apply gentle pressure with a sterile cotton swab or a small 1 cm by 1 cm section cut from gauze.\nCentrifuge at 135 x g for 12 min. If sufficient separation is not achieved, try an additional 2 - 3 min at 135 x g.",
    "Place half of the serum in a vial for later processing for ALT. Snap freeze these specimens.\n7. Euthanasia\nWhile the rat is still under anesthesia cut the IVC and superior vena cava (SVC) and monitor until blood flow, respiration and heart beat cease.\nIncise the diaphragm and perform a brief hepatectomy by incising the diaphragm in a circle and incising additional connective tissue that remains connecting the liver to the peritoneal cavity. Remove the liver from the peritoneal cavity.\nTake four samples from the left and median lobes of the liver and four samples from the right lobe of the liver. The samples should be as large as possible and their size will be limited only by the amount of available liver tissue. Place these in small, labeled vials, and snap freeze in the liquid nitrogen. Use these for later processing for tissue adenosine triphosphate (ADP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH).\n8. Post-experiment Analysis\nDetermine glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities in liver tissue and serum samples using diagnostic kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nHomogenize the liver tissue with lysis buffer and quantify using a Bradford assay. Analyze tissue lysate by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot using antibodies against cleaved capase-3 and actin. Quantify western blots performed with publicly available software."
