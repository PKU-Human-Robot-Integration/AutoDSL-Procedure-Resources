    "1. Preparation of the FRT-containing hPSC Master Cell Line for Transfection\nCulture hESC/iPSC master cell lines under standard procedures on or off inactivated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (iMEF) using hESC or feeder-free iPSC medium, respectively (Table 1). Prepare 2 (on feeders) or 1 (feeder-free) wells of hPSCs in a 6-well plate for each experimental condition.\nObserve the cultures, and when cells reach 60 - 70% confluency, plate drug-resistant iMEF (iDR4). Briefly, coat the necessary wells of a 12-well plate with 0.5 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution and incubate for 5 min at RT. Plate 125,000 iDR4s per well and incubate O/N with iMEF medium (Table 1).\n2. hPSC Transfection by Nucleofection\nThe following day, pre-incubate hESC/iPSC cultures with fresh media, including 10 µM Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632), for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, take hESC transfection solution from the fridge to pre-warm to room temperature.\nPrepare 1 mL of nucleofection plating medium (Table 1) per nucleofection condition. Take iMEF medium off the wells, wash with 1 mL of room temperature PBS, and add 500 µL of nucleofection plating medium. Transfer the other 500 µL to sterile 1.5 mL tubes and store them at 37 °C until plating. NOTE: A typical RMCE experiment contains three different conditions with molecular ratios of RMCE donor:pFLPe vectors of 2:0, 2:1, and 0:1.\nDetach hESC/iPSC into a single cell suspension.\n\t\nTake off the media, wash it with 2 mL of RT PBS, and add 1 mL trypsin 0.05% or accutase on feeder or feeder-free hPSC cultures, respectively. Incubate for 7 (trypsin) or and 2 - 5 (accutase) min at 37 °C. For the Accutase treatment — cells must remain loose, but attached.",
    "Carefully remove the plate from the incubator and without allowing the cells to detach, remove the dissociation agent by aspiration. Add 1 mL of hESC media and dissociate the loose cells by gently flushing the media on the plate surface, avoiding foaming. Make sure the cells are in a single cell suspension.\nCollect the cells in a clean and sterile 15 or 50 mL tube. Wash the wells with 1 mL of hESC media and collect the cells in the same 15 or 50 mL tube. Take a 50 µL aliquot for counting (during the next step) using a cell counting device. Note down the volume of collection and calculate total cell number. Spin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend the cell pellet to a suspension of 106 cells/mL with PBS using a 5 mL serological pipet and gentle pipetting. Avoid foaming. Transfer 2 mL per experimental condition (approximately 2 x 106 cells) to clean, sterile 15 mL tubes.\nWhile centrifuging, prepare the RMCE donor-pFLPe plasmids mixes in a maximum volume of 10 µL.\n\t\nTransfer 2.5 µg of pFLPe (6.5 Kb) to a clean, sterile 1.5 mL tube. Add a 2:1 molecular ratio of the RMCE donor vector13 to the pFLPe vector. For example, approximately 10 µg of a 12 Kb RMCE donor vector.\nProceed with nucleofection, avoiding foaming in all steps.\n\t​NOTE: Some hPSC transfection protocols apply an additional iMEF depletion step before step 2.4. However, in practice, iMEF is a minor cell fraction in the single suspension that does not significantly alter transfection efficiency, nor will it create contaminating recombinant cells since they are non-proliferative. In addition, it's essential to proceed rapidly during the transfection process to increase viability. For those reasons, iMEF depletion is not applied.",
    "Remove the iDR4 plate and the 1.5 mL tubes with the plating medium from the incubator. One tube at a time, pipet off the PBS carefully without disturbing the cell pellet. Remove as much as possible. Resuspend the pellet with 100 µL of transfection solution by gently pipetting. Transfer the cell suspension to the 1.5 mL tube containing the plasmid mixes and mix gently.\nTransfer the cell-DNA mix to the transfector cuvette, paying attention not to introduce bubbles. Introduce the cuvette in the nucleofector device and apply program A13 (cells cultured on feeders) or F16 (feeder-free).\n\t\t​NOTE: Other transfection methods or nucleofector devices may require optimization of these programs or transfection conditions.\nRetake the cuvette and, using the disposable transfer pipettes available in the nucleofection kit, collect its content by applying 0.5 mL of the plating medium and aspirating all the volume. Conduct this step quickly, but gently and in one movement.\nPlate drop-wise in the 12-well plate containing the iDR4 and 500 µL of plating medium. Repeat steps 2.6.1 - 2.6.4 for the next experimental condition.\nPlace the culture dish onto a shelf in the incubator and move it slowly back and forth and side to side to evenly distribute the cell suspension. Incubate it for 24 h before the next media change to allow the cells to recover in the presence of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632).\n3. Positive and Negative Selection of Cells Undergoing RMCE\nChange culture media daily (1 mL/well), and 2 - 3 d post-transfection, start selection with 100 ng/mL of puromycin.",
    "​NOTE: Optimal concentrations of positive and negative selection reagents need to be determined experimentally for each newly generated hPSC master cell line. Perform a kill curve13, using the master cell line to determine the low dose (concentration at which minimal visual toxicity is apparent after 7 d of selection, but the culture is not overgrown), optimal dose (the lowest concentration at which all cells are dead after 7 d of selection), and high dose (concentration that caused evident toxicity, killing all cells after 2 - 3 d) for both puromycin and Fialuridine (FIAU).\n\t\nAspirate the hESC medium. Wash with 1 mL of PBS. Add hESC medium with 100 ng/mL of puromycin.\nObserve cell growth so that death and growth are balanced. Change media with puromycin daily, following step 3.1.1. When growth rate overtakes cell death, increase puromycin concentration in blocks of 25 - 50 ng/mL up to a maximum of 250 ng/mL. Continue puromycin selection for 5 - 7 d.\n3 - 4 d after starting puromycin selection, around day 6 post-transfection, start selection with 0.5 µM FIAU. Change the media daily and maintain FIAU for no more than 7 continuous days.\n4. Expansion and Characterization of RMCE Lines\nAfter completion of selection, around D14 - 15, resistant RMCE colonies are present and constitute the new RMCE line. Split in bulk in a 1:2 ratio following standard procedures (passage 1, P1).\nPlate 2 wells of a 12-well plate (on or off feeders, depending of the regular culture conditions of the original master cell line). Use one well for further expansion, storage, or experimental set-up (no additional description of these procedures is done in this protocol), and the other one for characterization.",
    "When cells from P1 are ready to split, dissociate the well for characterization into a single cell suspension as described in 2.4 and collect the cells in a 15 mL tube. NOTE: Use cells from the hPSC WT (no genetic modification) and master cell line as negative and positive controls, respectively, for the characterization.\nSpin down at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. Resuspend in 1 mL of PBS and split the sample in two for flow cytometry and DNA analysis13.\nFlow cytometry analysis13 (300 µL):\n\t\nAdd fetal calf serum to the cells in PBS up to a final concentration of 5%. Transfer the cells to a clean FACS tube with a cell strainer and keep them on ice.\n\t\t​NOTE: Cell viability is high in these conditions, so it is possible, but not necessary, to use a fluorescent stain for non-viable cells (e.g., 7-AAD or PI).\nProceed immediately to analysis in a flow cytometer cell analyzer and record 20,000 - 30,000 events. For analysis, set the gates above GFP or tdT background florescence using the WT negative control sample.\nDNA analysis13 (700 µL):\n\t\nTransfer the cells to a clean 1.5 mL tube. Spin down at 300 x g for 5 min at RT and aspirate the supernatant. Proceed to DNA extraction using a commercial kit and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Store the dry pellet at -20 °C for later analysis.\nMeasure DNA concentration.\n\t\nPrepare standard PCR reactions according to the conditions in Figure 3 and Table 213. Run PCR samples on a 2% agarose gel containing 1x DNA gel stain at 150 V for 15 - 25 min. Analyze the run in a gel analyzer."
