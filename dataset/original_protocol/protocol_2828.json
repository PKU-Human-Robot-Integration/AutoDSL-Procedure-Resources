Quartz glass pipettes optimized for bouton recordings have resistances of 7–12 MOhm when filled with potassium gluconate-based internal solution.\nCut glass capillary into ∼5 cm lengths using a triangular file. Clean glass dust from the cut ends using compressed air spray or wipe with finger.\nPull quartz glass pipettes from capillaries.\nNote: Steady-state operation of the pipette puller is typically reached following a few consecutive rounds of pipette pulling.\nInspect pipettes individually at low magnification (e.g., with a stereo microscope) and intermediate magnification (e.g., with a 10× objective) for taper shape (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C), and at high magnification (e.g., using a 100× air objective with 3.4 mm working distance and 0.8 numerical aperture, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for pipette intactness and tip opening diameter.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2533-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Quartz glass pipettes for bouton recordings\n(A and B) Quartz glass pipette filled with fluorophore-containing internal recording solution at low and high stereoscopic magnification.\n(C and D) Quartz glass pipette tip with 10× objective and 100× objective.\nNote: A steep tapering of the pipette shank and thick-walled pipette tips are preferred.\nPause point: We typically record with newly fabricated pipettes and do not keep pipettes for more than 8 h. However, pulled pipettes can be stored for multiple days in a sealed container.\nFill pipette tips with minimal internal recording solution (1–2 μL) using Microloader™ pipette tips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).",
    "Shorten pipettes to minimal length such that the electrode fits under the condenser (∼15 mm for the custom-built holder in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nClean cut ends of glass dust and mount on pipette holder (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1D).\nOptional: We have successfully re-used quartz glass pipettes upon cleaning following the protocol by ref.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] for bouton recordings.\nIdentification of boutons (part II)\nTiming: 5–15 min\nPart II describes the identification of boutons for whole-cell recordings. Bouton identification is based on morphological and functional properties. For morphological identification, we use high magnification, high NA optics as described under Patch-clamp recording setup. For functional identification we use live-staining of active boutons and / or cell-attached recordings prior to establishing whole-cell mode.\nMorphological identification of boutons in unstained cultures.\nInsert coverslip into bath chamber and stabilize position with a metal grid if needed.\nNote: Each coverslip can be used for multiple cycles of bouton identification and recording attempts within ∼1h after insertion into external bath solution. If cells do not survive for at least 1h, see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nBoutons in primary dissociated cultures can be found as both, isolated boutons without an apparent postsynaptic target (labeled a in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C) or boutons adjacent to neuronal cell bodies or dendrites (labeled b and c in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C). If boutons cannot be identified visually in unstained cultures, see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nOptional: Identification of boutons in unstained tissue can be facilitated by prior dye filling in a somatic whole-cell recording. Dye diffusion into the axon subsequently delineates boutons as repetitive axonal enlargements, e.g., as seen in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E of Ritzau-Jost et al. (2021). Bouton identification in acute brain slices requires prior neuronal dye filling1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] or fluorophore-expressing transgenic animals3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] due to the native tissue density precluding visual bouton identification.\nLive-staining of active boutons using FM®1-43 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; ref.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2533-Fig3.jpg",

Membrane breakdown is indicated by a sudden deviation of the passive current transients (asterisk) leading to amplifier saturation (flat current signals following membrane breakdown during de- and repolarization).\nPrepare a high-K external solution (i.e., external recording solution with 40 mM NaCl replaced stoichiometrically by KCl).",
    "Add FM®1-43 to 1 mL of high-K external solution in a petri dish (final FM®1-43 concentration 4 μM) and place in a dark box.\nInsert a fresh coverslip into the petri dish with FM®1-43 high-K external solution in the dark box and incubate for 30–60 s.\nTransfer the coverslip into another petri dish with regular external solution for washing and subsequently transfer into the recording chamber for imaging. If bouton live-staining does not work, see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCell-attached action potential recordings (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nIn cell-attached mode, boutons can be identified by action currents resulting from spontaneous spiking.\nNote: Action currents are recorded in voltage-clamp on-cell mode at the zero-current potential22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] and impose as biphasic, often asymmetric spikes. If differentiation of action currents from noise artifacts is difficult, see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nEstablishment of whole-cell bouton recordings (part III)\nTiming: 10 min per attempt, recordings last for 5–15 min\nPart III provides a step-by-step description of a whole-cell bouton recording. For the basic steps during conventional somatic patch-clamp recordings, we refer to detailed introductory literature elsewhere (e.g., ref.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23],24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). We recommend to first identify a bouton for recording and subsequently immerse the pipette into the bath. Throughout each attempt, a membrane test pulse is applied to monitor pipette or seal resistance.\nSet holding potential to nominal 0 mV (minus liquid junction potential)25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] and monitor pipette resistance using a test pulse.\nImmerse pipette into bath solution with moderate positive pressure (20–40 mbar). Reduce pressure after crossing the bath surface to the minimum level required for solution efflux.\nPosition the pipette tip in a focal plane just above the targeted bouton.",
    "Note: Reducing pipette pressure will lower the risk of pipette block by particles within the internal solution. If very small tip pipettes and / or high fluorophore concentration in the internal solution are used, filter internal solution with 0.1 μm filter (Sartorius Minisart® PES 0.1) before pipette loading.\nBring the pipette in proximity to the bouton (∼1–2 μm; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nSet pipette current to zero.\nSet the pipette pressure to 5–15 mbar.\nApproach the bouton in the direction of the longitudinal pipette axis at minimum micromanipulator speed until you appear to touch the bouton (i.e., the bouton slightly moves). In some cases, a dimple is visible on the bouton surface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nRelease positive pipette pressure slowly and do not apply suction. The recorded bouton will attach to the pipette tip and a gigaohm seal will form with according changes in the test pulse.\nAction currents can be recorded in the cell-attached configuration (see 9.). For difficulties to obtain cell-attached configuration, see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nGently retract the pipette along its longitudinal axis by ∼1 μm to decrease mechanical stress on the bouton membrane.\nNote: This will also reduce the risk of sucking the bouton into the pipette while attempting to establish whole-cell mode.\nDetermine pipette capacitance using a test pulse.\nCompensate for pipette capacitance using the built-in pipette capacitance compensation in cell-attached voltage-clamp mode.\nNote: This capacitance is referred to as Cfast in the EPC10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) or C1 and C2 in the Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). In the latter case, only C1 was used and C2 was set to zero.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nApply mild, as short as possible suction pulses to break the membrane at the pipette tip. In parallel, monitor membrane intactness using a test pulse.",
    "Note: Because of the small capacitance of the bouton and higher series resistance compared to somatic recordings, typical changes in the response to small 5–10 mV test pulses are often not readily visible when establishing bouton whole-cell mode. We instead apply test pulse to 0 mV (duration 5 ms) to monitor active membrane conductance. In this case, upon membrane rupture a sodium current will be elicited that occurs with a delay of <300 μs relative to the test pulse onset followed by a slower and opposed potassium current (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Larger delays and large amplitudes of sodium currents (>500 pA) may indicate close proximity to a nearby soma.\nOptional: Instead of pressure pulses, we successfully used the voltage “zap” protocol by ref.26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] for membrane break down. Specifically, we use 250 mV depolarizations from resting membrane potential for 3 ms with 50 mV increments. Typically, membrane break down and thus transition to whole-cell mode occur at 350–400 mV zap amplitude (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nUpon membrane rupture, whole-cell mode is established. Switch amplifier to whole-cell mode accordingly.\nIf a dye is contained in the internal recording solution, the recorded bouton and adjacent axon can be identified in fluorescence imaging.\nHolding current at −80 mV should be between 0 and -15 pA. Holding currents exceeding -15 pA are a sign of a poor seal or an unhealthy bouton.\nWhole-cell recordings can be maintained for 10–15 min under optimal conditions of no mechanical and chemical stress.",
    "Critical: For stable whole-cell bouton recordings, use constant solution flow in the bath, minimize the pressure of the intracellular solution in the pipette (including adhesive forces), minimize phototoxicity during fluorescence imaging, and minimize the drift of the micromanipulator and the pipette in the pipette holder (see example of holders in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1D for Kleindiek micromanipulators and ref.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] for headstage mounted micromanipulators). If whole-cell recordings cannot be maintained for 10–15 min, see problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nPipette capacitance compensation for current-clamp recordings from boutons (part IV)\nTiming: 2 min for pipette filling and coating per attempt\nCurrent-clamp recordings rely on precise compensation of pipette capacitance including the capacitance of the pipette holder and the headstage of the amplifier.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24],27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27],28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] In contrast to somatic action potentials that are less sensitive to erroneously compensated pipette capacitance (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A), bouton action potentials are smaller and broader when recorded with insufficiently compensated pipette capacitance or larger and narrower with overcompensated pipette capacitance (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29] Therefore, part IV describes precise pipette capacitance compensation (27.) and minimization of total pipette capacitance (28.).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2533-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Precise capacitance compensation is required for boutons current-clamp recordings\n(A) Example soma action potentials recorded without compensation of pipette capacitance (ø Cap. comp), with compensation of the capacitance value determined in voltage-clamp mode (±0 pF), and with small undercompensation (-0.25 pF, -0.5 pF) and overcompensation (+0.25 pF, +0.5 pF) of pipette capacitance. Note the small sensitivity of somatic action potential shape to changes in pipette capacitance compensation.\n(B) Example bouton action potentials recorded with varying pipette capacitance compensation as in (A). Note the strong effect of small deviations in capacitance compensation on the bouton action potential amplitude and duration.",
    "(C) Increasing pipette capacitance compensation in current-clamp mode in a circuit model of a neuronal soma leads to voltage oscillations separable from slower voltage changes across the somatic capacitance. Box: Expansion of the initial current injection-evoked voltage change for different pipette capacitance compensations.\n(D) Current injection-evoked voltage responses in a circuit model of a bouton for different pipette capacitance compensations. Box: Expansion of the initial current injection-evoked voltage changes. Panels (C and D) were modified from Ritzau-Jost et al. (2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCapacitance compensation in voltage- and current-clamp mode deploys different circuits and amplifiers vary in their capacitance compensation precision.\nIn somatic current-clamp recordings, pipette capacitance compensation can be obtained by increasing the compensation until voltage oscillations occur upon current injection (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] However, this method cannot be applied to bouton recordings due to their small membrane capacitance obscuring oscillation onset (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). We therefore previously established a hybrid voltage-/current-clamp approach, in which the pipette capacitance is first determined in the voltage-clamp mode in the cell-attached configuration and this value is subsequently used for compensation in the whole-cell configuration after switching to current-clamp mode.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nThe precision of this approach and of the current-clamp recording in general can be tested for the used amplifier by, e.g., an analog bouton recording circuit model (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] in Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021)1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] or a virtual model 29.\nWe previously compared various amplifiers and found accurate capacitance compensation and hence small errors in recorded action potentials using the Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) in combination with the hybrid voltage-/current-clamp approach.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2533-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Components and reduction of total pipette capacitance",
    "(A) Scheme of the capacitance components adding up to total pipette capacitance (capacitances of the headstage in blue, pipette holder in yellow, and pipette glass in purple). Means to reduce pipette capacitance are illustrated and provided on the right.\n(B) Capacitances for different glass types and treatments, pipette holders, and headstages. Color code as in (A). Glass pipette capacitances are represented as mean ± SEM.\n(C) Example quartz glass pipette with KORASILON® silicone grease to reduce pipette capacitance at increasing magnification (from top to bottom). Arrow indicates edge of applied silicone grease.\nCritical: Accurate action potential recordings were only possible when total pipette capacitance was ≤ 5 pF (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] in Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nThree components mainly contribute to total pipette capacitance: Amplifier headstage input capacitances, pipette holder capacitance (including electrode wire), and the capacitance generated across the immersed pipette glass itself (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nHeadstage input capacitance depends on the amplifier model.\nPipette holder capacitance is reduced by shortening connective and electrode wires and by applying hydrophobic silicone grease (e.g., KORASILON® paste, medium viscosity) on the electrode wire to minimize adhesion of internal solution (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C).\nPipette glass capacitance is reduced by low-capacitance glass types (e.g., quartz glass) and minimal pipette immersion using lowest possible bath solution levels on an inverted microscope.\nNote: The hydrophobicity of quartz glass additionally prevents adhesion of the extra- and intracellular solution along the glass and the silver wire. Adhesion of bath solution along the pipette taper can be further prevented by using a steep pipette immersion angle.\nIf recordings are performed on an upright microscope, consider lifting the objective from the bath solution after establishing the recording.\nApplication of hydrophobic silicone grease on the pipette taper and tip region under a binocular guidance further reduces pipette capacitance (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C).",
    "Optional: We previously also used borosilicate glass pipettes for bouton recordings. However, these have a higher capacitance than quartz glass pipettes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) and may therefore affect signals recorded from boutons (for a comparison of somatic and bouton action potentials recorded with quartz and borosilicate glass pipettes, see Figure S4E in Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Furthermore, borosilicate pipettes have higher resistances than quartz glass pipettes of similar tip opening diameter (Figure S2 in Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] We therefore recommend to test the effect of different pipette types on bouton recordings prior to data interpretation. However, we have not systematically tested application of silicone grease or extensive coating to borosilicate glass pipettes. Therefore, careful capacitance minimization of borosilicate glass pipettes might allow current-clamp recordings of equal resolution as obtained with quartz glass pipettes."
