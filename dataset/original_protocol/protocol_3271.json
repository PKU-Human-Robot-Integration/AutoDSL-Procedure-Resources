    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n96-Well plate preparation – Day 0\nTiming: 1 h\nAspirate the Laminin solution from each well of the 96 well plate.\nAdd 100 μL of the prewarmed cloning medium into each well.\nNote: Gently dispense cloning medium to each well to avoid disrupting the Laminin-521 coating.\nPlace in an incubator at 37°C 5% CO2 for 1 h before starting experiment.\nSingle cell dissociation – Day 0\nTiming: 15–20 min\nCells are gently dissociated into single-cell solution using accutase cell dissociation reagent (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nRemove tissue culture vessels from incubator and place them in biosafety cabinet.\nAspirate medium from the vessels, and wash cells with 1 mL room temperature (RT) 1X DPBS without Ca++/Mg++.\nNote: the volume is for each well of a 6-well plate or a 35 mm tissue culture dish.\nAspirate DPBS from previous step and replace with 1 mL of accutase cell dissociation reagent and place the plate back into incubator for 5–7 min.\nCritical: Time required for dissociation is cell-line specific and it should be empirically tested to obtain optimal viability (>90%).\nRemove the plate from incubator and place it in biosafety cabinet.\nNote: At this point most colonies should be lift in suspension.\nLiberate remaining colonies from the bottom of the plate.\nDraw up cell suspension using a p1000 micropipette and spray remaining adherent colonies off the plate.\nGently pipette up and down twice to break up cell aggregates into single cells.\nTransfer cell mixture into a 15 mL conical tube, and then immediately add 9 mL DMEM F-12 medium to neutralize the accutase reaction (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at RT, aspirate supernatant, and gently resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of mTeSR Plus medium.\nCount viable cells using Trypan blue.",
    "Note: Do not continue if cell viability is below 80%.\nDilute single-cell solution to approximately 1000 cells/mL with pre-warmed mTeSR Plus medium in a 35 mm untreated petri dish.\nCritical: (a) To prevent single cells from attaching to the plate, untreated petri dishes should be used in this step. (b) It is difficult to perform single cell picking when cells are at high density, which could result in the plating of more than one cells in a well.\nRock the petri dish back and forth to separate single cells.\nPlace single cell suspension in a 37°C incubator for 5 min to allow cells to settle, but not attach to the bottom of the petri dish.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Single cell dissociation and picking, related to steps 5–18\nSingle cell picking – Day 0\nTiming: 15–60 min\nSingle-cell selection into 96-well plates using the pulled pipettes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: An experienced cell picker can expect to pick 48 clones (one 96-well plate) in 15–20-min.\nAttach a pre-cut borosilicate glass micropipette tip to the STRIPPER Micropipetter in the horizontal laminar flow cabinet/clean bench.\nRetrieve the 35 mm petri dish containing single-cell suspension and the Laminin-521 coated 96-well plate containing cloning medium from the incubator, and place them in the horizontal laminar flow cabinet/clean bench.\nPick single cells using the STRIPPER Micropipetter under an inverted microscope at 4× or 10× magnification.\nDepress the plunger on STRIPPER micropipette to first stop, carefully place tip in front of desired cell and aspirate (∼1 μL).\nPlace the pipette tip into one well of the Laminin-521 precoated 96-well plate containing mTesR Plus with CloneR2.\nDepress the pipette plunger to the second stop to expel the cell into the desired well.",
    "Note: These pipette tips are very fragile, so be careful not to scratch the bottom of the plate or wells.\nNote: Early attempts of this protocol used Y-27632 Rho Kinase inhibitor, but this yielded poor efficiency. The use of CloneR2 was recommended to us by the manufacturer. However, a recent publication using a cocktail containing chroman 1, emricasan, polyamines, trans-ISRIB (CEPT) was show to have greater efficiency compared to CloneR during fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of hPSCs, and therefore may increase the efficiency of this single cell picking protocol.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nRepeat step 16 until the desired number of cells are selected.\nCritical: To maximize cell viability, we recommend limiting the time span that the cells are outside of the incubator to 30-min intervals to avoid changes in pH level of culture medium.\nPlace 96-well plates containing single cells in the back of tissue culture incubator at 37°C 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nColony maintenance – Day 1 - 10/14\nTiming: 10 min per day\nTiming: 10 min (for step 20)\nTiming: 10 min per day (for step 21)\nTiming: 10 min per day (for step 22)\nRegular medium changes are performed to allow a single cell to attach and form a homogenous colony (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: It is difficult to visualize cell growth between day 1 and day 5. Therefore, it is important to perform medium changes carefully without touching the bottom of each well to avoid disrupting cell attachment.\nIf single-cell cloning is used for selecting iPSC reporter lines, you may check the fluorescence signal on day 1.\nCritical: Minimize the time that the cells are outside the incubator. For the first 5–7 days, only remove the plate from the incubator when performing medium changes.\nOn day 2, perform full medium change with prewarmed 100 μL cloning medium.",
    "Note: It is safest to aspirtate the medium out of the well using a 200 μL pipette. But once comfortable with the depth of the well, a vacuum aspirator may be used with the suction set to lowest setting.\nOn day 3, add an additional 25 μL of prewarmed fresh cloning medium (25% of initial volume) to each well.\nFrom day 4-10/14, perform full medium changes daily with prewarmed mTeSR Plus.\nNote: The colonies may be passaged on day 10 or day 14.\nFluorescent reporter confirmation – Day 1-10/14\nVisual inspection under a fluorescent microscope to confirm fluorescence reporter expression.\nOn day 1, check fluorescent signal using an Evos imaging system or other desired system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Check each well periodically to ensure that the wells of interest maintain reporter expression. During the recovery and expansion period, it is possible that reporter expression is silenced in some cells.\nPassage multiple single-cell clones with various reporter expression levels.\nNote: Since viral integration occurs randomly, it can cause toxicity if more than one integration event occurs in a cell.\nExpansion of single-cell colonies – Day 10–14\nTiming: 60 min\nSingle-cell colonies are expanded for future experiments (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCoat the surfaces of a 24-well plate with 500 μL of Geltrex solution.\nNote: Laminin-521 is only needed to enhance the attachment of single cells after picking. Subsequent passaging of single-cell derived colonies can be done with conventional matrices such as Geltrex and Matrigel.\nIncubate 24-well plates in 37°C incubator for a minimum of 30 min or overnight.\nRetrieve 96-well plates containing sing-cell colonies from incubator, and place them in a biosafety cabinet about 5 min before the Geltrex incubation time is complete.\nAspirate the medium from 96-well plates and wash each well with 100 μL 1XDPBS, without Ca++/Mg++.",
    "Add 100 μL of 0.8 mM EDTA solution per well (pH 7.2).\nPlace 96-well plates in 37°C incubator for 5–7 min.\nCritical: Similar to accutase dissociation, EDTA incubation duration is cell-line dependent and should be empirically determined.\nDuring the EDTA incubation, remove the Geltrex solution from 24-well plates, then add 480 μL of mTeSR Plus medium to one well and 420 μL of medium to a second well.\nNote: The different volumes reflect the need for screening clones after CRIPSR gene editing. One sparsely populated (480 μL) well is for maintenance and a more densely populated well (420 μL) is for genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation. If single-cell cloning is for isolating iPSC reporter lines or population selections, use the same volume and plate an equal number of cells in each well.\nPlace 96-well plates back into the biosafety cabinet and carefully aspirate EDTA solution.\nAdd 100 μL of mTeSR Plus medium to 96-well plates, and pipette up and down to gently dissociate large cell clumps into smaller pieces.\nCritical: Change tips between wells to avoid cross contamination.\nAdd 20 μL of cell suspension to one well of 24-well plates containing 480 μL of mTeSR Plus medium to bring the total volume to 500 μL.\nAdd the remaining 80 μL of cell suspension to the second well containing 420 μL of mTeSR Plus medium.\nPlace plates back into the cell culture incubator at 37°C 5% CO2.\nNote: Researchers may use their established protocols in their laboratories for routine maintenance of hPSCs such as medium change, passaging, and cryopreservation. If your lab does not use mTeSR Plus medium routinely, hPSCs can be gradually transitioned from mTeSR Plus medium to another desired medium.\nNote: Sudden switch between hPSC maintenance medium could reduce cell viability.\nGenome editing confirmation – Day 11–17\nTiming: 120 min",
    "Genomic DNA (gDNA) is extracted from the densely populated well to assess gene editing efficiency.\nLiberate cells from plates as outlined in the “Passaging Colonies” section of the protocol (Step 27–32).\nPause point: Cell pellet can be flash frozen and gDNA isolation can be done later.\nIsolate gDNA using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) using manufacturer’s protocol.\nPause point: Once gDNA is isolated, it can be stored in −20°C freezer until the researcher is ready to proceed to the next step.\nAmplify the region of interest and send out purified PCR products for Sanger sequencing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3041-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. STRIPPER single cell selection can be used to isolate CRISPR/CAS9 genome edited colonies\n(A) Diagram depicting the POGZ gene. Stars on the diagram indicate the locations of mutations for heterozygous POGZ (POGZ+/−; red) and homozygous mutations (POGZ−/−; blue) in the POGZ gene.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(B) Sanger sequencing confirmation of indels in POGZ+/− and POGZ−/− lines (analysis were done using the ICE software from Synthego Inc).\n(C) Next generation sequencing confirmation of indel distribution in POGZ+/− and POGZ−/− lines. Top panel: We observed a ∼50:50 ratio between WT sequence (48.7%) and a modified sequence containing a single nucleotide insertion (51%) in POGZ+/− line. Bottom panel: We observed a nearly 100% (99.81%) variant that is different from the reference sequence in POGZ−/− lines. This figure was modified from Deng et al. 2022.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3041_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3041_3.csv\nNote: We use Eurofins Genomics[href=https://eurofinsgenomics.eu/en/custom-dna-sequencing/] for Sanger sequencing.\nEstimate the gene editing efficiency and indel patterns using the online software ICE from Synthego Inc[href=https://ice.synthego.com/].\nNote: To use this software edited lines must be compared to an unedited control (this should be the original line without going through the gene editing process) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPause point: The researcher may proceed to the next step as desired.",
    "Confirm indel patterns using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on selected clones (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: We use the CRIPSR NGS sequencing service at the Massachusetts General Hospital DNA Core Facility[href=https://dnacore.mgh.harvard.edu/new-cgi-bin/site/pages/index.jsp].\nNote: NGS generates quantitative readouts of sequence variants in each edited stem cell clone, which can be used to confirm the homogeneity of single-cell selection. For example: If it is a wildtype clone, we expect a nearly 100% (above 97%) variant that matches to the NCBI reference sequence.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] If it is a heterozygous knockout (KO) clone, we expect a ∼50:50 ratio between WT sequence, and a modified sequence containing insertions/deletions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). If it is homozygous KO, we expect a nearly 100% (above 97%) variant that is different from the WT sequence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). If it is a compound heterozygous clone, we expect a ∼50:50 ratio between two different variants, both of which contain insertions/deletions. Large indels can slightly skew this ratio in heterozygous lines to more than 70% WT.\nPerform genetic integrity analysis to ensure there are no confounding chromosome abnormalities before starting downstream analyses.\nNote: We use the Illumina Infinium CoreExome-24 v1.4 kit and the genotyping service at University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core Facility[href=https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/advanced-genomics/] and analyze the data using Genome Studio v2.0[href=https://support.illumina.com/array/array_software/genomestudio/downloads.html].\nAlternatives: We have also used hPSC Genetic Analysis Kit from Stem Cell Technologies (Catalog # 07550). This is an alternative approach to check chromosome abnormalities, which is cost-effective but lower throughput.\nPerform other downstream analyses such as RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunostaining."
