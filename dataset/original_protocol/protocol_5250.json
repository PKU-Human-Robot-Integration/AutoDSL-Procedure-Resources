    "Macroscopic phototaxis assay (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530222513_9518.jpgFigure 1. Macroscopic phototaxis assay. Consecutive steps as described in steps A1-A8.Prepare 80 ml of the macroscopic phototaxis plate medium (see Recipes).Mix very gently to avoid any air bubbles.Pour the medium carefully into a square Petri dish and close the lid to avoid over-drying of the phototaxis plate. Let it solidify on an even surface. Plates should always be freshly prepared.Scrape cyanobacterial cells with a sterile 1 µl inoculation loop from freshly grown agar plates or from a macroscopic phototaxis plate (see Note 5) and resuspend in 50 µl 1x BG11 medium (see Recipes) in a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by vigorously twisting the loop (approximately OD750 40 or very dark green color).Place the phototaxis plate on a template with three equally spaced parallel rows drawn over the surface area of the plate. Spot 5 µl of the cell suspension in triplicates in each row. Close the lid and allow the droplets to soak into the plate. This step may take up to an hour depending on the surface of the plate and the density of the cells.Place the phototaxis plate upside down in a non-transparent square box with a one-sided opening. Align the rows of the phototaxis plate parallel to the opening.Incubate the phototaxis plate at 30 °C under a unidirectional white light source with an angle of about 45° (e.g., Philips MASTER TL-D Super 80 18W/840 1SL/25) at approximately 35 µmol photons m-2 sec-1 measured with a quantum sensor at the front side of the phototaxis box.After 1-2 days the finger-like projections of the motile cells can be recorded by scanning the plate or taking a picture (Figure 2). For reproducibility, all results should be recorded after the same time.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530222629_0633.jpgFigure 2.

Microscopic phototaxis assay. Consecutive steps as described in steps B1-B12.Prepare 50 ml of the microscopic phototaxis plate medium (see Recipes).Mix very gently using a pipetting aid to avoid any air bubbles.Pour 5 ml of the medium carefully into each sterile glass bottom µ-dish. Use a pipetting aid and close the lids to avoid over-drying of the phototaxis plates. Let the medium solidify on a level surface to prevent unevenness. As above plates should always be freshly prepared.Scrape motile cyanobacterial cells with a sterile 1 µl inoculation loop from a fresh macroscopic phototaxis plate and resuspend in 110 µl 1x BG11 medium (see Recipes) in a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by vigorously twisting the loop (approximately OD750 1.0 or very light green color). Be careful not to scrape any agar from the surface. The density of the cells is crucial for the outcome of the experiment. If the density is too low, the cells will not move properly. If the density is too high, the cells will obstruct each other and tracking will be negatively affected.Spot 5 x 2 µl droplets of the cell suspension in the center of each plate and let dry for 10-15 min. Avoid over-drying and exposure to intense light (e.g., sunlight on the bench).Carefully place a coverslip on top of the cells immediately after all the liquid has been soaked in. Avoid air bubbles but do not press down with force. If the coverslip is applied too early or pressed down with force, the cells will float and Brownian movement will be observed, predominantly.",
    "If the coverslip is applied too late, over-drying of the surface will hinder cell movement.Lubricate one side of a silicon ring with liquid paraffin and place the ring on the plate. The ring should cover all of the exposed agarose surface to minimize evaporation and prevent jittering of the sample while imaging. Be careful not to contaminate the surface of the coverslip with the liquid paraffin.Incubate the samples in a dark environment for 2-3 h.Place the phototaxis plate on the stage of an upright microscope equipped with a 40x objective and cover it with a non-transparent hollow cylinder with 4 holes positioned in increments of 90°. Insert the LEDs into the holes and align the pins horizontally to the stage. Make sure that the LEDs touch the center of the plate and focus on the cells. The LEDs are positioned at the same height as the agarose surface.Start the microscope software NIS-Elements Basic Research 4.20.01. Dim the condenser light of the microscope so that it is barely visible. Typically, the histogram displayed in the microscope software should be in the lower range for acquisition times > 100 msec. If the intensity of the condenser light is too high, the cells will show impaired directional motility. If the intensity of the condenser light is too low, tracking will be negatively affected.Switch on the RGB-LEDs as desired using a microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino UNO R3 with the software Arduino 1.0.6). For a standard phototaxis assay directional white light illumination from RGB-LEDs (470/525/625 nm at equal intensities) with a total intensity of 10 µmol photons m-2 sec-1, measured with a quantum sensor, is used.Acquire images as necessary.",
