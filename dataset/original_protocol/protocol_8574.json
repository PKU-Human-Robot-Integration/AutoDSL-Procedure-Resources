    "1. Coating the Microelectrode Array with Enzymes or Matrix Layer\nPreparing the protein matrix solution\nWeigh out 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and transfer to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 985 µL of DI water to the microcentrifuge tube containing BSA. Mix the solution by manual agitation (re-pipetting using 1,000 µL pipette ~ 3 times, until the BSA is dissolved).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use vortex to mix the solution as doing so may introduce air into the solution. Also, set the pipette to a volume <1,000 µL (e.g. 700 µL) to avoid introducing air bubbles. The solution may be placed in a microcentrifuge if necessary.\nOnce the BSA solution is dissolved, add 5 µL of 25% glutaraldehyde solution. Mix the solution by inverting the closed tube 3 - 5 times. The resulting solution is 1% BSA with 0.125% glutaraldehyde.\nSet aside the protein matrix solution for 5 min. The solution will appear light yellow in color.\nPreparing the desired enzyme solution (e.g., glutamate oxidase)\nPrepare the glutamate oxidase solution by adding filtered DI water to the lyophilized, purified enzyme (e.g., 50 µL DI water added to 25 units of glutamate oxidase to yield 0.5 U/µL).\n\t\tNOTE: Aliquot stock solution (e.g., 1 µL) and store the aliquots in appropriately sized containers (e.g., 500 µL microcentrifuge tubes) at -20 °C. Aliquots may be stored for up to 6 months under these conditions.\nAdd 4 µL of the BSA/glutaraldehyde solution to the microcentrifuge aliquoted tube containing glutamate oxidase. Mix the solution by manual agitation (re-pipetting with a 10 µL pipette. The pipette should be set to volume < 5 µL). The resulting solution is 1% BSA, 0.125% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 U/µL glutamate oxidase. Use the solution for coating immediately.",
    "Note: Glutamate oxidase coating solution may only be used within 15 min. Although several MEAs may be coated with one prepared solution, it is recommended not to exceed the useable time window for glutamate oxidase. The number of electrodes that can be coated within 15 min vary. Generally, 4 to 6 electrodes can be coated at a time.\nCoating the MEA\nTypically, coat a pair of recording site(s) on a MEA with the desired enzyme (glutamate oxidase) and a different pair of recording site(s) ('sentinel' site(s)) is coated with the inactive protein-matrix.\nUse blunt-tip Hamilton microsyringes (e.g. 10 µL) to coat MEAs with L-glutamate oxidase or inactive protein matrix solution (BSA+glutaraldehyde). The procedures used for enzyme or inactive protein-matrix coatings are the same.\nClean the syringes before and after use (3 rinses with DI water, 3 rinses with methanol, 5 rinses with DI water).\n\t\tNOTE: Dedicated syringes are used for applying coats of enzyme (glutamate oxidase) or protein-matrix. Do not use the same syringe for a different solution. It is recommended to perform protein-matrix coatings before enzyme coatings.\nDraw up glutamate oxidase or protein matrix using a 10 µL Hamilton syringe. Gently press the plunger to dispense a small bead of solution at the syringe tip (visualized using a dissecting microscope).\nUsing the dissecting microscope to target the MEA recording sites, apply the solution to the appropriate recording sites by briefly contacting the recording sites with the solution droplet/bead, which represents one layer. Three layers are sufficient for both the protein-matrix and the enzyme coat. Thick layers can reduce the sensitivity of the MEA.\nRaise the solution droplet straight up and off the recordings sites (i.e. the syringe tip should not scrape across the MEA surface).",
    "Set a timer for 1 min. This is the minimum time requirement between coating applications to the recording site(s). Allow enzyme-coated MEAs to cure at 4 °C for 5-7 days.\nRecord the number of coats applied, how long it took to apply the coatings, the electrode number, and a name and date in a laboratory notebook.\n2. Electroplating with m-Phenylenediamine for Improved Selectivity\nPreparing m-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (mPD) solution\n\tNOTE: Plate the exclusion layer, mPD, to prevent the oxidation of dopamine and other large, interferent molecules (e.g., ascorbic acid), thereby improving the selectivity of the sensor for glutamate/H2O2 over other potentially-interferent molecules.\n\t\nMeasure 50 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a volumetric flask and transfer 50 mL of 0.05 M PBS to a larger (150 mL) Erlenmeyer flask.\nUsing the tubing connected to a nitrogen tank (e.g., using the tubing connected a pressure ejector), attach a pipette tip (e.g. P200 tip) to the open end of the tubing. Place the tubing with the attached pipette tip in PBS solution and cover the solution loosely with parafilm. Turn on nitrogen and gently bubble solution for 20 min.\nWeigh 0.045 g of mPD.\n\t\tCaution: mPD is a potentially carcinogenic substance. Weighing of mPD should be performed using a scale contained within a fume hood. Wear gloves and mask when using mPD. Ensure the hood is functional and that the sash is pulled to the appropriate working level. Immediately clean surfaces that may have been contaminated with mPD to avoid permanent staining.\nAfter bubbling, transfer all of the mPD to the de-gassed PBS solution. Cover the flask opening with parafilm and gently swirl solution to dissolve mPD in solution. Avoid aggressive mixing or use of a vortex as doing so may introduce gasses into the solution.",
    "Transfer the solution to a 50-mL beaker. A stir bar is not necessary.\nElectroplating the electrode\nObtain a reference electrode. Use reference electrodes dedicated to mPD plating only. Use a different reference electrode for calibration procedures.\nPosition the plastic arm of the reference electrode holder over the beaker. Check for air bubbles in the glass reference electrode (may not be able to see). Gently flick the distal end of the reference electrode to remove any air bubbles at the tip.\nPlace the reference electrode through the opening in the plastic arm and lower into the beaker containing PBS. Ensure that the reference electrode does not contact the bottom of beaker.\nConnect the reference electrode to the headstage (e.g. 2 pA/mV) and connect (e.g. DIP connector) the MEA to be mPD plated to the headstage.\nLower the MEA into the beaker solution such that only the MEA tip is submerged in solution. Do not submerge the MEA tips in liquid beyond the black 'bubble' (the black insulation located above the MEA tip). Doing so may damage the MEA.\nRun a 'test' calibration to verify the functionality of the electrode channels and connection to the headstage.\n\t\tNOTE: Although hardware settings should reflect the equipment being used, details related to analyte/interferent type and the concentration do not have to be entered for the 'test' calibration. The recoding mode should be 'Amperometry' and the 'V-applied' should be -0.7 V. Verify typical recording for all channels.\nCancel by selecting 'Cancel' when connectivity of all the recording sites is verified. It is not necessary to save the calibration data.\nSelect the \"Electroplating\" icon on the desktop. The Electroplating Tool Menu will appear. Verify the correct settings are entered:\n\t\tP-P amplitude: 0.25\n\t\tOffset: -0.5\n\t\tFrequency: 0.05\n\t\tDuration (min): 20",
    "Select the 'pause' button to begin plating. The elapsed time field should begin counting down.\nUpon completion (all time elapsed), select 'another MEA' in the popped up menu to begin mPD plating an additional MEA. Replace the plated MEA with an MEA to be mPD plated and repeat the electroplating procedure using the electroplating tool.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use the prepared mPD solution no more than 2 times or within a 1 h time period. Prepare a fresh solution to prepare more than 2 MEAs.\nSelect 'exit software' to finish electroplating. Rinse mPD-plated electrode tips with DI water (to avoid a salt residue) and store (24 h) before calibrating.\nRemove the reference electrode from solution and rinse with DI water before placing into the appropriate storage solution (e.g. 3 M NaCl). Ensure the reference electrode tip is submerged in solution. Slowly lower glass reference electrode into the solution to avoid damaging the glass.\nDispose of the mPD solution in an appropriately labeled hazardous waste container.\n3. Calibrate the MEA for Glutamate Detection and Selectivity (Figure 1)21\nPreparing the solutions needed for calibration.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Table 1.\nPerform calibration under constant stirring (magnetic battery operated stirrer) at 37 °C. Turn on the heating pad or circulating water bath and obtain a small stir bar. Stir slowly but fast enough that when an addition is made (below), the new plateau is reached quickly.\nConnect the headstage (2 pA/mV) to the recording control system and insert the MEA tip into 40 mL of stirred 0.05 M PBS (use a 50-mL beaker).\nConnect the reference electrode. Flick the end to ensure there are no air bubbles.",
    "Open the recording program and click \"Calibration\". Make sure the settings are correct (check that sentinel sites are selected as this may change with different electrodes), choose MEA number and press \"Start\".\nAllow 5 - 10 min for equilibration; begin once the baseline has stabilized (< 0.004 nA/min change).\nSelect \"Baseline\" and add 500 µL of 20 mM ascorbic acid (interferent; final [250 µM]) and select \"Interferent\" (AA is thought of as brain-wide interferent) once the current has reached a new, steady plateau, if any. Allow 0.5 - 1 min between additions. If the MEA is properly electroplated, almost no change should be observed.\nAdd 40 µL of 20 mM L-glutamate (final [20 µM]) and once the current has reached a new, steady plateau, mark 1st addition \"Analyte\". Repeat three times for a total of 3 glutamate additions.\nAdd 40 µL DA. Do not select \"Analyte\"; select \"Test Substance\" - DA may only be an interferent in areas containing DA.\nAdd 40 µL Peroxide. Do not select \"Analyte\"; select \"Test Substance\".\nClick the \"Stop\" button once the calibration is finished.\nTo determine the functionality of the MEA, click the calculation tab and record the following parameters in a lab notebook.\n\t\nFor the MEA design (3,000 µm2) used in these calibrations, use a MEA with a slope of ≥ 0.004 nA/µM but lower slopes can be used for certain experiments. If there is less than a 10% difference in slope between enzyme coated and uncoated sites, then use these MEAs for evoked release only or clean/discard the MEA.\nUse a limit of detection (LOD) ≤ 1.5 µM. If the LOD is greater than 1.5 µM, then use these MEAs for evoked release and uptake only. Do not use these electrodes for recording tonic levels.",
    "Use a selectivity for the desired analyte (i.e., glutamate) over the interferent of > 20 arbitrary units. If selectivity is less than 20, then clean/discard the MEA.\nUse a linearity (R2) of the calibration curve of ≥ 0.90. If linearity is less than 0.90, then clean or discard MEA.\nSave the file with the # of the MEA, date, and initials of the person calibrating.\n4. Assemble the Micropipette\nNOTE: Micropipettes (capillary glass) should have a tip with an internal diameter of 10 - 15 µm.\nPlace the micropipette centrally among all four platinum recording sites and mount 50-100 µm above the MEA using sticky wax and modeling clay.\nTo load the micropipette, use a 1 mL syringe filled with glutamate or KCl solution, a 0.22-µm sterile syringe filter, and a 97 mm long, 28-gauge pipette filler, backfill the micropipette. That is, insert the needle at the top of the micropipette and fill at the bottom of the micropipette (the end toward the MEA), making sure there are no bubbles.\nAttach the micropipette to the pressure ejecting system at 2 - 20 psi for about 1 s.\n5. Plate the Miniature Reference Electrode for In Vivo Use\nPrepare the plating solution (50 g NaCl/90 mL 1 M HCl in a 100 mL beaker (plating bath)) and cut the bath electrode (~ 10 cm length of platinum (Pt) wire (~ 0.02\" diameter)).\nCut a 10 - 15 cm long piece of Teflon coated silver wire (0.008\" bare) and use a razor blade to scrape off ~ 1 cm of Teflon coating from each end of end of silver wire.\nSolder a gold pin on one end and place one end of exposed silver wire into the plating bath.",
    "Using a DC adapter (use only a DC adapter having an output of ~ 9 - 15 VDC max.), clamp the \"red\" (+) wire to the prepared silver wire (reference electrode) on the gold pin side. Clamp the \"black\" (-) wire to Pt bath cathode.\nPlug in the DC adapter. Look for the correct plating process — bubbles should appear at the bath electrode; reference electrode turns a silver/gray color.\nCAUTION: Do not switch the leads [Black (-) vs Red (+)] — plating bath will be ruined if this occurs and fresh plating solution will need to be made. A bad solution will turn yellow in color: DO NOT USE!\n\tNOTE: The plating reaction takes 2-5 min generally: Ag0 + Cl- → AgCl + e-\nTest the reference electrode.\n\t\nSet a multimeter to the 100 - 200 mV DC setting.\nPlace a benchmark (that is, a previously tested electrode known to be working) reference electrode in 3 M NaCl and test against the newly plated reference electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: If using a new reference electrode, soak it in 3 M NaCl before use (12 h recommended).\nPlace the \"red\" (+) lead on the gold pin of the reference electrode to be tested. Place the \"black\" (-) lead on benchmark electrode. An acceptable readout range is ± 10 mV. 0 mV is ideal across the 2 reference electrodes.\n6. General Animal Surgery for MEA Recordings\nPreparation for surgery\nPlace surgery tools in disinfectant the night before.\nRemove the tools from the disinfectant and rinse thoroughly and place the tools on a sterile surgery pad. Obtain a heating pad.\nCalibrate two electrodes and attach the micropipette as described in procedures 3 and 4.\nMake the reference electrode as described in Section 5.",
    "Make 200 µM glutamate and 70 mM KCl. Refer to Table 1.\nObtain the animal and record its weight on surgery sheets.\nPrepare the anesthesia and turn on the heating pad.\nPerform MEA surgery\nUsing isoflurane (4% flow in oxygen), anesthetize the animal in an induction chamber until the respiratory rate has significantly declined and the animal does not respond to toe or tail pinch. Record respiratory rate and body temperature every 15 min.\nPlace the animal in the stereotaxic device using the ear bars to stabilize the head. Make sure the animal is secure and the head does not move. Lower the isoflurane flow to 1.5 - 3% in oxygen. Ensure that the heating pad is properly positioned under the animal and set to 37 °C to provide supplemental heat. Failure to provide supplemental heat may result in profound hypothermia and premature death of the animal.\nApply eye ointment using a sterile cotton applicator and record the respiratory rate and body temperature. Using a battery-powered trimmer, shave the top of the head. Use the small surgical scissors to remove the fur near the ears.\nAt this point, put on the sterile surgery gloves. Apply iodine and then alcohol (three times) to the scalp.\nUsing a scalpel, make an incision straight down the middle of the scalp and spread the skin using bull dog clamps. Take a sterile cotton tip to soak up any blood. Use hydrogen peroxide to facilitate the appearance of bregma and lambda.\nCheck that the head is properly positioned by measuring the D/V and M/L coordinates of bregma and lambda. Coordinate changes should be zero if the head is on a flat plane. Adjust the head and ear bars as necessary to ensure a flat plane.",
    "Find bregma, and zero the coordinates. Using the desired coordinates, move to the left and right and make a mark using a permanent marker. Using a cauterizer/marker, make a large square around the mark with enough room to reach the desired region.\nUsing a sterile rotary tool, drill around the square mark. Soak up any blood using a sterile cotton applicator. Thoroughly disinfect the drill bit prior to each use.\nAttach the MEA to the headstage and backfill the pipette with the first desired solution. Be sure leave a gap in the pipette without solution so that the solution being expelled can be examined. Attach the tubing to the glass micropipette.\nTurn on the nitrogen tank and the pressure ejector (psi=5, time=0.6 s). Test (press manual red button) to ensure the pipette is not clogged before beginning.\nCalibrate the micropipette. Start at 0 on the reticle and place a piece of blue tape on the headstage to indicate the start point. Turn on the digital reader and reset it to zero. Go down 1 mm (DV) and count the number of ticks the solution has moved on the reticle. 10 ticks should equal 1 mm (1 mm = 250 nL), so 1 tick = 25 nL.\nPlace the reference electrode in a remote location from the MEA such that it is still in liquid contact with the brain to complete the circuit.\nFind bregma with the MEA attached and zero the digital reader. Move the MEA to the desired coordinates. Slowly lower the MEA until the tip touches the brain. Zero the DV coordinate and SLOWLY lower the MEA into the brain.",
    "On the recording program, click on the desired calibrated electrode and then click \"Perform Experiment.\" The system will then start recording tonic levels for the analyte of interest while the animal is anesthetized.\nZoom to an axis that will help in observing baseline and allow the electrode to baseline for 20 - 45 min.\nAfter the baseline is stable, set the pressure ejector to .6 s and 5 psi and press the red button on the pressure ejector to eject. Record the time and pressure as well as volume/ticks moved on the injection sheet (Figure 2). Make any notes that are necessary (i.e., larger peaks, dilution effects, clogged pipette, noisy baseline/o-scope).\nFor glutamate injections, wait 3 - 5 min between injections. For KCl injections wait 1 - 2 min between injections. Inject using the same pressure and time at least 3 times. Change time and repeat. Try not to change pressure unless the micropipette is clogged.\nIf the micropipette is clogged, increase the pressure up to 30 psi.\nRecord from the desired brain regions, repeating on both sides of the brain using different solutions. Record a baseline in each new region for 20 min.\nTake the MEA with micropipette attached, rinse with DI water and soak in PBS overnight until all the blood is gone.\nEuthanize the animal and save the brain in a pre-labeled tube and store in the -80 °C freezer or keep one side for fixation. To euthanize the animal, overdose with isoflurane (inhalation). Perform decapitation using surgical scissors and dissect out the desired regions.\n7. Cleaning Coated MEAs after Use\nDo not clean MEAs if unused. If there is lint or dust on the surface, clean with methanol and let dry for 24 h before coating.",
    "Turn on the water bath (80 °C) and soak the tip of the MEA for 30 min. Carefully wipe the tip of the electrode with a cotton tipped applicator to remove any debris that may be left on the electrode tip. Do not get the black \"insulation portion\" of the MEA wet.\nUsing three different sonicators, soak the tip of the MEA in (1) Citrisolv, a commercial solvent and clearing agent (2) isopropyl, and (3) DI water for 5 min. Carefully wipe the tip of the electrode with cotton tipped applicator to remove any debris that may be left on the electrode tip.\nExamine the tips under a dissecting microscope to ensure the layers have been successfully removed.\n8. Analysis\nTo analyze the data, first export the desired experiment by double-clicking the finished experiment and selecting \"export data\" from the file drop-down menu.\nSave this data to the desired file location and open up the analysis program. Click \"open\" in the analysis program and choose the recently saved file.\nGive the program a few moments to upload the file and then check experiment under the event markers tab. Under output, check the boxes for the desired parameters. For example, baseline, amplitude, peak area (area under the curve), Trise, and T80.\nClick refresh and then analyze to export the data to a spreadsheet (this may take a few minutes). The program will give a prompt to save the file to the desired location. Once saved, the file can be edited in a spreadsheet.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
