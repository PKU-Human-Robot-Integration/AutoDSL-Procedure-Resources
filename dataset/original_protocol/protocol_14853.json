    "NOTE: The following protocol was designed for use with adherent cells. Modifications are required to apply the method to non-adherent cells grown in suspension. The CAM experiments described in the protocol are designed for use with cells that express a fluorescent marker (e.g., GFP, RFP, etc.). Nine day old chicken embryos are required on day 2 of the experimental protocol for the CAM experiments.\n1. Preparation and Transfection of Tumor Cells with Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs)\nAspirate medium from T75 flask(s) containing cells of interest, wash with 1XPBS, and add 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Add 10 ml of complete growth medium to each flask and transfer the cells in solution to a 50 ml tube. Count the cells and adjust the volume so that the final concentration is 1.0x105 cells per ml.\nLabel two groups of T25 flasks: one group will contain eight flasks, labeled 1-8, and will be used for the real-time metabolism measurementexperiment; and the second group will also contain 8 flasks and will be used for the chicken embryo CAMexperiment. Add 2 ml of cells in solution to each flask and place in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2 O/N).\nThe next morning (Day 0, Time 0), label three 5 ml tubes as follows: control (non-targeting ASO or siRNA), 'target of interest' (i.e., targeting ASO or siRNA), and Lipofectamine 2000 (or a similar transfection reagent). Dilute the stock ASO solutions to the appropriate concentration with serum free medium in the appropriate tube.\n\t\nAdd the required amount of transfection reagent to the appropriate tube and incubate in serum-free medium for 5 min. Add the transfection reagent solution to the ASO tubes and incubate for 20 min.",
    "Add 250 µl of control ASO transfection reagent solution to each of flasks 1-4 in each group, and 250 µl of 'target of interest' ASO transfection reagent solution to each of flasks 5-8 in each group. Incubate for 4 hr (37 ᵒC, 5% CO2).\n\t\nDuring incubation, carry out the steps described in section 2.1. After the incubation, add 3 ml of complete medium to each flask in the CAM experiment group and return to the incubator O/N (37 ᵒC, 5% CO2). Process the metabolismexperiment group according to the description in section 2.2. Process the CAM experiment set according to the description in section 4.\n2. Biosensor Chip Preparation and Cell Seeding\nIn a sterile environment, carefully wash six biosensor chips with 400 µl of PBS. Sterilize the chips with 400 µl of 70% ethanol for 20 min. Wash three times with 400 µl of PBS.\n\t\nPlace the chips inside sterile tissue culture dishes to prevent contamination. Place three chips in a dish labeled 'control', and three in a dish labeled 'target of interest'.\nLabel two 50 ml tubes as 'control' and 'target of interest'. Wash cells with PBS and add an appropriate volume of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA. Wait until the monolayer detaches and collect the cells from each flask. Deposit the solution into the appropriate tube.\n\t\nCount the cells and adjust the volume so that the final concentration is 6.0x105 cells/ml. Centrifuge and resuspend the cells if the initial concentration is too low.",
    "Add 250 µl of the cell solution to each biosensor chip in the appropriate group (for a total of 1.25x105 cells per chip). Perform this task one group at a time to minimize the risk of confusing the chips. Place the sterile dishes containing the chips inside a humidity chamber to prevent evaporation, and place the humidity chamber in the incubator O/N (37 ᵒC, 5% CO2).\nThe next morning (Day 1), carefully aspirate the medium from each chip and replace it with 250 µl of growth medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1x penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). Incubate for 4 hr (37 ᵒC, 5% CO2).\n3. Metabolism Measurement System Preparation and Solution Preparation\nDuring the incubation, prepare the requisite drug solutions and the metabolism measurement system for the upcoming assay.\n\tNOTE: The metabolism measurement system contains a total of six modules. Each module accommodates one chip per experiment.\n\t\nSubdivide the assay into the following experimental groups: one chip from each of the 'control' and 'target of interest' groups to receive vehicle for the duration of the assay; two chips from each group to receive drug treatment for a defined period of time during the assay, followed by vehicle during the washout period.\nFor drug sensitization studies, modify the length, timing, and concentration of drug treatment to suit the particular drug in question.\n\t\tNOTE: For cisplatin, the following steps were determined empirically with A549 cells, and may vary depending on cell line. Perform all stages with the default flow rate of 4 µl/min.\n\t\t6 hr of growth medium + 0.2% FBS and 1x P/S\n\t\t24 hr of 6 µM cisplatin in medium + 0.2% FBS 1x P/S\n\t\t24 hr of growth medium + 0.2% FBS and 1x P/S",
    "18 hr of growth medium + 0.2% FBS and 1x P/S\n\t\t4 hr of 0.1% Triton-X\n\t\tNOTE: Deviations from these steps will require calculation to determine the required volume of medium and drug solutions based on the desired flow rate and duration of experiment. The following sections are based on the steps described above.\nLabel and fill fourteen 50 ml tubes with 50 ml of growth medium + 0.2% FBS and 1x P/S. Place six in one metabolism measurement system tube rack, six in another, and the remaining two in a third tube rack that also contains tubes with cisplatin. Seal the first two racks with an air permeable membrane to prevent evaporation.\nPrepare a solution of 6 µM cisplatin (of the appropriate volume) in medium + 0.2% FBS with 1x P/S. Dispense the required volume of cisplatin solution into four labeled 50 ml tubes.\n\t\nPlace the tubes in the remaining four slots in the third metabolism measurement tube rack. Ensure that the tubes are placed in the appropriate slots that correspond to the desired biomodules. Seal the tubes with an air permeable membrane.\nPrepare and label six 50 ml tubes and fill them with 20 ml each of 0.1% Triton-X solution in medium. The Triton-X solution will lyse any remaining cells and provide a 'zero' value for each chip. Place the tubes in a fourth metabolism measurement unit tube rack and seal with an air permable membrane to prevent excessive evaporation.\nLoad the chips into the biomodules and initiate the experiment.\n4. CAM Experiment Drug Treatment and Injection\nNOTE: The steps and procedure for preparing chicken embryos for a CAM experiment are described elsewhere19",
    "Begin processing the CAM experiment 48 hr post-transfection (Day 2). Sub-divide the 'control' and 'target of interest' groups into two flasks for vehicle, and two for cisplatin. Aspirate the medium from the flasks and replenish with either 3 ml of fresh medium, or 6 µM cisplatin. Incubate for 6 hr (37 ᵒC, 5% CO2).\nAspirate the medium, then wash and trypsinize the cells; collect the trypsinized cells in solution into four appropriately labeled 15 ml tubes.\n\t\nCentrifuge and wash the cells three times with PBS. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 5 ml of PBS and count the cells.\nAdjust the volume so that the final cell concentration is 1.0x106 cells/ml. Transfer the cell solution into labeled 5 ml tubes for injection, and place on ice. Invert the tubes gently prior to injection to ensure that the cells are well mixed.\nSet aside a total of 24 chicken embryos (9 days old) for injection (6 per group). Perform the injection using a glass needle attached to a flexible tube connected to a 1 ml syringe. The individual performing the injection should be blinded to the treatment group.\n\t\nUsing a stereo microscope, inject 1.0x105 cells in a volume of 100 µl into the venous circulation of the CAM. Use a slow, pulsating technique to inject the full volume of cells. Gently dab the injection site with a soft wipe to stem the flow of blood and absorb any spillage. Label each embryo container appropriately following each injection.\nConfirm the presence and distribution of fluorescent cells in the vasculature of the CAM following injection by visualizing them using a fluorescent microscope. Take note of any embryos in which the number of tumor cells appears low, or the distribution is poor.",
    "Place the chicken embryos in a humidity chamber and store them in an incubator (37 °C, 60% humidity). Wait 7-9 days before enumerating metastatic foci.\n5. Metastatic Focus Enumeration\nDuring the 7-9 day incubation period, monitor the embryos and discard any dead ones. Ensure that the humidity chamber remains moist at all times during the incubation period.\nUsing a fluorescent stereo microscope at 20X magnification, scan the entire upper surface of the embryo CAM in a regular, grid-like pattern.\nCount the number of metastatic foci in each field of view, then tally the number for a final total per embryo. Doing so for the six embryos in each group will provide an average number of metastatic foci per treatment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
