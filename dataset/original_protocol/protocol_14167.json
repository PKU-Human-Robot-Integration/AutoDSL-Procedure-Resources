    "Approval from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee was obtained for all experiments.\nNOTE: Nine to twelve weeks-old female BALB/c mice are obtained. 4T1-luc2 cells, a mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line derived from BALB/c mice that has been engineered to express luciferase, are used. These cells are cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n1. Preparation of Instruments\nThaw a frozen gelatinous protein mixture (e.g., Matrigel) on ice in a tissue culture hood.\nClean and autoclave two sets of surgical instruments (microdissection scissors, Adson forceps, and a needle holder) prior to surgery. Prepare sterilized 5-0 silk sutures and dry sterilant (when serial surgeries are planned).\nClip the middle chest hair of the mice using a clipper and mark the mice for identification by punching the ear prior to the time of surgery.\nPrepare the procedure table, which can be immediately used for the operation.\nSpread an absorbent pad and fix the corners with tape, fix anesthesia nose cones with tape, put sterilant and disinfectant (chlorhexidine, iodine, and 75% ethanol) beside the operating space, and place the mice in operation order.\n2. Preparation of Cells (for 10 Mice)\nNOTE: The cells should be inoculated within 1 h after being detached from the dish to avoid decreased cell viability. Specifically, the cell suspension should be mixed into the gelatinous protein mixture within 15 min after detaching the cells from the dish to maintain their viability.\nCulture 4T1-luc2 cells, a mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line expressing luciferase, in RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2.",
    "Wash the adherent 4T1-luc2 cells in a 10-cm dish with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a 10 mL serological pipette. Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin using a P1000 pipette and, then, incubate the sample at 37 °C for 5 min. Then, add 4 mL of growth media (RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS) using a 5 mL serological pipette and transfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL conical tube in a tissue culture hood. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 180 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 mL of PBS; then, count the cells using the hemocytometer.\nSuspend 2 x 106 4T1-luc2 cells in 40 μL of cold PBS (pH 7.4, 4 °C) in the tissue culture hood.\nMix the 40-μL cell suspension with 360 μL of the gelatinous protein mixture in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice in the tissue culture hood.\nNOTE: The final concentration is 1 x 105/20 μL (1:9 PBS:gelatinous protein mixture). For the orthotopic model (no mastectomy), 1 x 104/20 μL of the final concentration was used, to avoid reaching euthanasia criteria (tumor size > 2 cm) within two weeks.\n3. Cancer Cell Inoculation\nPut the mice in the anesthesia induction chamber with 2-4% isoflurane and 0.2 L/min oxygen flow until the mice breathe calmly (2–3 min).\nGrasp the mouse and inject 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine into its shoulder subcutaneously.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by the lack of reaction to a toe pinch. Insert the mouse’s nose into the hole of the mouse mask, which allows inhalational anesthesia with 2-4% isoflurane and 2 L/min oxygen flow attached to a charcoal canister unit.\nRestrain the mouse’s limbs using lab tape and sterilize its skin using chlorhexidine, iodine, and 75% ethanol, using cotton swabs.",
    "Make a 5 mm skin incision in the middle of the anterior chest wall utilizing sterile microdissection scissors, lift the right-side skin next to the incision and detach the skin from the chest wall using the scissors, and then, invert the skin to expose the right #2 mammary fat pad.\nCarefully inject 20 μL of cancer cell suspension using a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 28.5 G needle into the fat pad under direct vision through the wound.\nNOTE: The needle goes through the wound, not the skin. Keep holding the needle in the fat pad for 5 s prior to pulling it out, which allows time for the gelatinous protein mixture to solidify.\nClose the skin incisions by stitching, using sterile 5-0 non-absorbable sutures.\nAfter surgery, return the animals to a clean cage and monitor them until they have recovered and are moving freely (after ~1–2 min). If an animal does not appear to be in good health within 24 h of surgery, administer buprenorphine (0.2 mg/kg).\nRemove the sutures under anesthesia (see step 3.1) 7 d after the surgery.\n4. Mastectomy\nNOTE: The timing of the mastectomy is very important. If it is done too early, lung metastasis does not occur. If it is done too late, the primary tumor has invaded major blood vessels, which make a complete oncologic resection challenging. Thus, multiple time points were tested for mastectomy to determine which time point produced the appropriate balance in waiting for metastasis before resection became too challenging. After doing so in over 50 mouse experiments, it was demonstrated that mastectomy at 8 days after cancer cell inoculation (or when the tumor size reaches 5 mm) was the ideal time point to achieve that balance13.",
    "Anesthetize a mouse with 2-4% inhaled isoflurane and inject buprenorphine (see steps 3.1 and 3.2).\nRestrain the mouse and sterilize its skin (see step 3.4).\nMake a 5 mm skin incision 2 mm to the left from the surgical scar that was made at the initial cancer cell inoculation, using the microdissection scissors. Extend the incision toward the root of the forelimb to remove the tumor, the skin including the surgical scar, and the lesion in contact with the tumor, as well as the axillary lymph node basin in which most of the time no visible lymph node exists at the time of the mastectomy13. Make sure not to damage the axillary vein.\nClose the skin defects by stitching, using sterile 5-0 non-absorbable sutures in the shape of a “Y”.\nThe same as in step 3.8, return the mouse to a clean cage and monitor until they have recovered.\nRemove the sutures under anesthesia (see step 3.1) 7 days after surgery.\n5. Bioluminescent Quantification of the Primary Tumor (Orthotopic Inoculation Without Mastectomy) or Lung Metastasis (Mastectomy Model)\nNOTE: For primary tumor burden quantification, the bioluminescence is measured 2x a week from the day after the orthotopic inoculation. For lung metastasis quantification, the bioluminescence is measured 2x a week from the day after the mastectomy.\nDissolve D-luciferin in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to a final concentration of 15 mg/mL in a tissue culture hood. Aliquot it into light-shielded 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Store the diluted solution at -80 °C.\nNOTE: For a 20 g mouse, 200 µL of diluted D-luciferin is required.\nOpen the imaging software and click Initialize.\nNOTE: It takes about 15 min to cool the charge-coupled device (CCD). When the CCD reaches the set temperature, the color of the Temperature bar changes from red to green.",
    "Anesthetize the mice with 2-4% isoflurane in a dedicated induction chamber prior to imaging (see step 3.1).\nWeigh the mice.\nInject 150 mg/kg D-luciferin intraperitoneally at the point of the mid-abdomen, using a 28.5 G needle.\nFit each mouse with a nose cone inside the imaging system in the supine position (place a maximum of five mice at the same time). Maintain anesthesia at 1% - 3% isoflurane (in 100% oxygen) through the nose cones during imaging.\nCapture an image every 5 min to detect the peak bioluminescence for 50 min (or up to the confirmed peak bioluminescence).\nSelect Luminescence as Auto, Binning as Medium, and Field of View as D.\nClick Acquire to capture the image.\nReturn the mice to their cage(s) and monitor them until they have recovered (see step 3.8).\n6. Lung Metastasis Tumor Burden Quantification by Ex Vivo Imaging\nNOTE: Lung metastasis quantification is applicable for orthotopic inoculation both with and without mastectomy models. In the mastectomy model, ex vivo imaging or survival observation is chosen, depending on the purpose. In the orthotopic inoculation (without mastectomy) model, most cases produce primary tumor size euthanasia criteria (> 2 cm) approximately 21 days after inoculation.\nQuantify lung metastatic lesions 21 days after the cancer cell inoculation by ex vivo imaging.\nAnesthetize the mice with 2-4% isoflurane in a dedicated induction chamber (see step 3.1).\nWeigh the mice.\nInject 150 mg/kg D-luciferin intraperitoneally (see step 5.6).\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation, 15 min after the injections.\nOpen the abdomen by cutting the skin and peritoneum at the mid-abdomen, using curved Mayo scissors. Extend the incision to both the right and the left. Pull out the liver with forceps until the diaphragm is visualized; then, cut the diaphragm.",
    "Using the curved Mayo scissors, cut the bilateral ribs from caudad (12th ribs) to cephalad (1st ribs) to expose the lungs by flipping the anterior thorax wall.\nIdentify the thoracic esophagus, which looks like a cord connecting the lungs to the spine, by lifting the lungs using forceps and, then, cut the esophagus using the microdissection scissors.\nLift the bilateral lungs and heart using forceps (applying traction pulling down, in the direction of cephalad to caudad) and, then, cut the trachea and major vessels to the lung apex at the cephalad, using microdissection scissors.\nNOTE: This allows for the isolation of the lung and heart from the body.\nRemove the heart from the lung using microdissection scissors.\nPut the lungs in a 10 cm Petri dish.\nCapture the bioluminescence image (see steps 5.7.1 and 5.7.2) 5 min after euthanasia (20 min after the luciferin injection).\nSubscription Required.
