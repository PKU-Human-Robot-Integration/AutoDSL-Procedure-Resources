    "NOTE: The protocol describes a detailed instrumentation modification for upconversion-assisted photoactivation, a synthetic procedure to generate caged PKA-UCNP, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the silica-coated UCNP and caged PKA-UCNP samples, UV and NIR photolysis setup, cell preparation, PKA-UCNP microinjection, a photoactivation study, and the stress fiber staining of REF52 cells.\n1. Fluorimeter Setup for Upconversion Spectrum Measurement\nInstall a 4X objective lens next to the cuvette holder of the fluorescence spectrometer so that the laser is focused on the middle of the cuvette.\nPlace a tunable 0.5- to 8-W 980-nm laser diode 90° against the objective lens.\n\tCAUTION: The operator needs to have laser safety knowledge and wear NIR laser goggles.\nInstall a full reflectance mirror in the light path intersection of the objective lens and laser. Place a black anodized metal plate to block the excitation window of spectroscopy and to protect the interior parts.\nPlace the cuvette of silica-coated UCNP solution (0.2 - 0.6 mg/mL) in the cuvette holder so that a bright upconversion beam can be visualized and can be used to adjust the best light alignment for mirror installation.\nSwitch the spectroscopy to luminescence mode with lowest PMT voltage setting (adjust to a higher setting if the signal is too weak). Adjust the mirror to the best alignment, where the beam is on the middle of cuvette and the PMT picks up the strongest signal.\nMeasure the upconversion spectrum, after alignment, with the desired power setting. Use a thermal pile power meter to build a calibration curve of laser power against the electrical current reading on the laser power supply. Constantly check the laser performance to make sure that the performance is within the calibrated range.\n2. Microscope Setup",
    "NOTE: The following setup works for microscopes equipped with a two-tier optical path. If the user intends to install an excitation light source switch in the back port to make the NIR laser and the halide lamp share the same port, the collimator in the back port will significantly block the NIR because it is designed to reduce sample heating. The user must make a difficult choice: keep the collimator in and suffer from very low upconversion efficiency, or remove the collimator and sacrifice the intensity of excitation light for the epifluorescence.\nNOTE: A cutaway diagram showing the light path scheme for a modified spectrofluorometer, the microscopy for upconversion luminescence and NIR photolysis mode and for epifluorescence and UV photolysis mode, and the experimental setup used for this experiment are illustrated in Figure 2.\nEquip the fluorescence microscope with a metal halide light guide, directed into the back port.\n\tNOTE: In this upper-tier light path where there is a cube turret, one cube position must be empty to allow for NIR coming from the lower-tier light path.\nInstall a tunable 0.5 to 8.0 W 980 nm laser diode in the right-side port, with the side-port collimator open.\n\tNOTE: This enlarges the laser light spot to about 500 µm in diameter when a 10X objective lens is used. Removing this collimator results in a micrometer-range light spot and makes NIR cell irradiation impractical. This collimator is NIR-transparent.\nInstall a dichroic mirror (850-nm short-pass) and an excitation filter (950 nm long-pass) in the lower-tier light path.\nUse a UCNP solution to visualize the NIR light spot. Adjust the position of laser to center the NIR light beam in the field of view to finish the alignment.\n3. Preparation and Characterization of Caged PKA-UCNP Construct",
    "Incubate recombinant PKA (9 µM) with 0.5 mM 2-nitrobenzylbromide (NBB) in caging buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2; pH 8.5) for 1 - 2 h at 25 °C. Quench the excess NBB with 10 mM dthiothreitol (DTT) and then dialyze against 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) to remove excess reagents and salts.\n\tNOTE: The pH of the caging solution is lowered from 8.5 to 7.5 during dialysis with HEPES pH 7.5 for the subsequent immobilization reaction.\nMix the lanthanide salts-Y(CH3CO2)3 hydrate (99.9%, 0.4527 g, 1.38 mmol), Yb(CH3CO2)3 hydrate (99.9%, 0.2533 g, 0.60 mmol), and Tm(CH3CO2)3 hydrate (99.9%, 0.0168 g, 0.02 mmol)-in octadecene (30 mL) and oleic acid (12 mL), heat the mixture to 115 °C for 30 min, and cool them to 50 °C. Next, dissolve the reaction mixture in a methanolic solution (20 mL) with 0.2 g (5.0 mmol) of NaOH pellet and 0.2964 g (8 mmol) of ammonium fluoride by sonication for 15 min. Increase the reaction temperature to 300 °C to get the UCNP core (β-NaYF4:1.0% Tm3+/30% Yb3+) nanoparticles.\nDissolve the core nanoparticles (25 mg) with CO-520 (0.5 mL) in cyclohexane (10 mL). Add ammonia (wt 30% v/v, 0.08 mL) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 0.04 mL) and apply constant stirring for 12 h at room temperature to get the silica-coated β-NaYF4:1.0%Tm3+/30%Yb3+ core nanoparticles.\nIncubate the PKA (6 nmol) or caged PKA (6 nmol) with UCNP (1 mg)15 in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 3 h to immobilize the PKA on silica-coated UCNP via electrostatic interactions.",
    "Filter the mixture using PVDF filter (0.45 µm), centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and redisperse the pellet in HEPES (50 µL, 10 mM, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% protein stabilizer to obtain the purified PKA-UCNP complex. Centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant for a Bradford assay in a 1.5-mL tube.\nAnalyze the unbounded PKA in supernatant saved from step 3.5 with a Bradford assay to back-calculate the PKA substitution level on the UCNP particles, which normally have a substitution level of ~ 4.5 nmol of PKA per mg of particle.\n\tNOTE: The Bradford assay reveals a strong blue color on the pellets, which suggests a high level and stable protein immobilization without desorption, while the supernatant fraction of caged PKA-UCNP solution shows a color similar to HEPES buffer (Figure 4c-4e).\n4. Characterization\nNOTE: The kinase assay is used to quantify the specific activity of pyruvate kinase. In brief, the phosphorylation of the peptide, which is coupled to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, results in the oxidation of NADH. Formation of the latter is monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm.\nDetermine the activity of PKA and PKA-UCNP in a 60 µL total volume of assay mixture containing 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS, 100 mM, pH 7.5), KCl (100 mM), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP, 1 mM), adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 mM), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH, 0.8 mM), magnesium chloride (MgCl2, 1 mM), kemptide (0.4 mM), and a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase mixture (30/40 units of PK/LDH).\nMeasure the decrease in NADH absorbance over time after the addition of PKA solution (2 µL) to the assay mixture. Calculate the slope of the line to directly reflect the activity of the kinase being measured.",
    "Measure the activity of PKA-UCNP15 and the overall activity, which should be well matched with the multiplication product of native PKA-specific activity and the calculated PKA surface-coated amount.\n5. Photolysis Setup\nMeasure all power of the light sources using a thermal pile sensor and calculate power densities (PD = Power (W)/Area (cm2))18 based on the light spot area.\nPerform in vitro UV photolysis experiments on a commercial system with a 365 nm LED (200 mW/cm2)15.\nFor UV photoactivation on the microscope stage, illuminate the PKA-UCNP solution with the excitation light filtered by a commercial cube15.\n\tNOTE: The power density is ~15 mW/cm2, without objective lens focusing.\nFor in vitro NIR photoactivation on the microscope stage, illuminate the PKA-UCNP solution using a 980 nm laser with customized upconversion filter/mirror settings installed on the lower-tier light path, a dichroic mirror (850 nm short-pass), and an excitation filter (950 nm long-pass).\n\tNOTE: The output power density is 5 W/cm2 before 4X objective lens focusing. The power density is estimated to be ~ 68 W/cm2 after 4X objective lens focusing.\n6. Cell Sample Preparation and Microinjection of PKA-UCNP Complexes\nPre-filter the samples through a 0.45 µm filter after PKA immobilization (step 3.5).\nIncubate the cells in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing L-15 medium during the microinjection period for stable pH control outside the incubator.\n\tNOTE:To confirm microinjection completion, co-inject the native PKA-UCNP, caged PKA-UCNP, or PEGylated UCNP (7.5 mg/mL)15 with 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (10 µM) in to cells.\nAdjust the concentration of the PKA-UCNP particles such that, after microinjection, the cytosolic concentration is 1 - 3 μM PKA - a physiological concentration range for PKA in a cell, with the assumption that the injection volume is 1/10 of cellular volume.",
    "Perform the microinjection into the cells (step 6.2) using a microinjector device coupled with a one-axis hydraulic micromanipulator (Figure 3).\nUse a digital pressure gauge to monitor the pressure applied by the microinjector is in the operating range (~50-200 hPa) and seal the dispenser valve in a customized pressuring chamber to provide compensation pressure for microinjection. Pull back the needle using a puller.\nMaintain the injection pressure between 50 and 75 hPa, with an injection time of 200-300 ms and the compensation pressure at 15 hPa to prevent culture medium backflow into needle by capillary action.\nExamine the tip openings of the needles to ensure that they have an external diameter between 1.3 and 1.5 µm, which can be confirmed by taking images using a 40x objective lens.\nWash the cells with 2 mL of L-15 medium containing 10% FBS after the microinjection. Observe the cellular fluorescence imaging from 5(6)-carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) to confirm microinjection completion.\n7. Photoactivation of Caged PKA-UCNP Using UV or NIR Light in Living Cells\nFor UV photoactivation after the PKA-UCNP microinjection, grow the REF52 cells on a 3.5 µm dish, place them on the microscope stage, and irradiate them with UV light filtered by the cube for 3 min without objective lens focusing.\n\tNOTE: REF52 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and cells were subcultured when the confluency reached to 90% every 2-3 days.\nFor NIR photoactivation after PKA-UCNP microinjection, illuminate the cells on a 980-nm laser from lower-tier filter/mirror settings, as described in step 5.4.",
    "NOTE: The power density output is 5 W/cm2 before 10X objective lens focusing and is estimated to be 300 W/cm2 after 10x objective lens focusing. Upconversion is a process that requires a high photon density, especially when a larger anti-Stoke shift is needed. Hence, focusing is needed during photoactivation.\nWhen a larger light spot (650 µm x 520 µm) is needed, irradiate these cells with NIR focused by a 10x objective lens with a collimator for 15 min. Allow for a 5 min dark interval after every 5-min irradiation to avoid heating.\n\tNOTE: When a high spatial-resolution (subcellular light spot) is needed, use the 40X objective lens with a pinhole installed in the exit end of the light guide to generate a subcellular-dimension light spot (5 µm x 4 µm). In this case, 1 s of irradiation is enough for NIR photoactivation due to the high flux of photons.\nAfter UV or NIR photolysis, allow the cells to recover in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h in complete medium to generate cellular responses. Subsequently, fix them in 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min before further staining.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is highly toxic; avoid contact with skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Avoid breathing the powder during measuring and preparation.\n8. Visualization of Stress Fiber Disintegration Caused by NIR Photoactivation\nAfter fixation, use Alexa 594-phalloidin (add 5 µL of 6.6 µM stock solution to 200 µL of PBS for staining; incubate for 25 min at room temperature) to stain and visualize the stress fibers. Visualize the images of Alexa 594-phalloidin (Ex 581 nm/Em 609 nm) using a filter set.",
    "Incubate the cells for 5 min in 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at room temperature. After staining, wash the samples with PBS and separately take fluorescent images of the stress fibers and nuclei.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
