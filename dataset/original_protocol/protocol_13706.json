    "1. Notes on general procedures\nEnsure that all chemicals (buffer components, enzymes, etc.) are kept free of ribonuclease (RNase). Sequester all commercially purchased reagent bottles from general lab use. Wear gloves for all steps of the experimental procedure. Use only glassware and utensils that have been baked (see step 1.2 below) and solutions that have been pre-treated (see step 1.3 below).\nBake all glassware (beakers, flasks, bottles, pipettes, etc.) for a minimum of 4 h at 177 °C. Wrap other utensils (spatulas, stir-bars, etc.) in aluminum foil before baking under the same conditions.\nPrepare a 0.1% (vol/vol) solution of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) in double-distilled water (ddH2O). Using a magnetic stir-bar, stir this solution overnight and then autoclave. Use this DEPC-treated H2O to make all solutions containing Tris; then, filter sterilize using a bottle top vacuum filter. Use regular ddH2O to prepare all other solutions (without Tris); then, treat with DEPC (0.1%, vol/vol) and autoclave.\n\tNOTE: The buffers used in the following set of experimental procedures are listed alphabetically in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nName of buffer,Composition\nBorate buffer,\"0.2 M sodium borate, pH 9\"\nBuffer C,\"20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)\"\nBuffer D,\"10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT\"\n60%D,60% Buffer D and 40% H2O\nEthanolamine,\"0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8\"\nHEPES binding buffer,\"20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9\"\nHEPES wash buffer,\"20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl\"\nRNA loading buffer,\"90% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue\"\nSDS-PAGE buffer,\"25 mM Tris, 169 mM glycine, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pH 8.8\"",

Preparation of NE depleted of U1 snRNP (U1 ΔNE)\nPreparation of anti-U1 beads for immunoadsorption\n\t\nPre-swell 50 mg Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads in excess DEPC-treated H2O to produce approximately 200 µL of swollen beads and then wash in HEPES wash buffer.\nFor this wash and all subsequent washes, pellet the beads by centrifugation (1,000 x g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C for 10-15 s) and remove the unbound wash using a micropipettor and discard.\nMix 150 µL of washed beads with 150 µL of human autoimmune serum specific for U1 snRNP (volume of antibody to volume of beads in a ratio of 1:1).\nAdjust, on the basis of the total volume of (~300 µL from step 2.1.3 above), the mixture to 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, corresponding to conditions of HEPES binding buffer; incubate this mixture with continuous rocking at room temperature for 60 min.\nWash the beads bound with antibodies with 1 mL of borate buffer (0.2 M sodium borate, pH 9) and resuspend in 1 mL of the same borate buffer.\nTo covalently couple the antibody bound to the Protein A-Sepharose beads, add dimethylpimelimidate to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubate at room temperature with rocking for 60 min.\nWash the beads with 1 mL of borate buffer.",
    "To block any unreacted cross-linking reagent, add 1 mL of 0.2 M ethanolamine (pH 8) and incubate at room temperature with rocking for 60 min.\nWash the antibody-coupled beads, hereafter designated as anti-U1 beads, twice with 0.5 mL of TX wash buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 in 60% D).\nDepletion of U1 snRNP from NE (see Figure 1A)\n\t​NOTE: The procedure for preparing NE from HeLa cells was initially developed by Dignam et al.20. We have described the materials and detailed methods for the preparation of NE for splicing assays19 (see steps 2.1 and 3.1 of that reference). NE, as initially prepared is in Buffer C and will hereafter be designated as NE(C). NE(C) dialyzed against and equilibrated with Buffer D will be designated as NE(D).\n\t\nIncubate 200 µL of NE(C) with 100 µL of anti-U1 beads from step 2.1.9 above.\nAdd 5 µL of RNasin to the mixture.\nRotate the microtube head-over-tail at 4 °C for 1 h.\nPellet the mixture by centrifugation (1,000 x g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C for 10-15 s) and collect the unbound material (U1ΔNE) using a Hamilton syringe.\nDialyze the entire volume of U1ΔNE, along with a separate 50 µL aliquot of the original nondepleted NE(C), in separate compartments of a microdialyzer, with stirring, for 75 min against 60% D using a dialysis membrane with 8 K molecular weight cutoff.\nImmediately after dialysis, divide these preparations (U1ΔNE and NE in 60% D) into 20 µL aliquots; then snap freeze in a dry ice/ethanol bath and store at -80 °C.\nAnalysis of the RNA and protein content of U1ΔNE and material bound on anti-U1 beads",
    "After the removal of the unbound material (U1ΔNE) (step 2.2.4), wash the material bound to the anti-U1 beads by adding 0.5 mL of TX wash buffer. Pellet the mixture by centrifugation (1,000 x g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C for 10-15 s) and remove the supernatant using a micropipettor and discard.\nRepeat the wash steps 2.3.1 twice.\nRemove the material bound to the anti-U1 beads by adding 100 µL of 2x SDS sample buffer to 100 µL of the beads and incubating for 10 min at room temperature.\nPellet the mixture by centrifugation (1,000 x g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C for 10-15 s); remove the supernatant by Hamilton syringe, and snap freeze in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Store at -80 °C.\nCompare the nondepleted NE, the depleted NE (U1ΔNE), and the material bound to the beads (removed from the beads by SDS sample buffer as described in steps 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 above). Follow steps 2.3.6-2.3.8 for RNA analysis or steps 2.3.9-2.3.10 for protein analysis.\nFor each sample, extract the RNA with 200 µL of phenol-chloroform (50:50, v/v); then extract again with 180 µL of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:1, v/v). Following extraction, add 300 µL of cold 200-proof ethanol, invert to mix, and store the precipitated RNA overnight at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the ethanol-precipitated RNA (12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Wash the pellets with 150 µL of cold 70% ethanol. Centrifuge again (12,000 x g) at 4 °C for 15 min. Remove the supernatant using a micropipettor and dry the pellets in a speed vac for 10-15 min without heat.",
    "Resuspend the dried RNA pellet in 10 µL of RNA loading buffer, gently vortex, heat to 75-85 °C for 90 s, and then incubate on ice for 2 min. Separate the snRNAs by gel electrophoresis (2 h at 16 mA) through 13% polyacrylamide - 8.3 M urea gels and then either stain with ethidium bromide or subject to northern blotting10,16.\nLoad the protein samples, in SDS sample buffer from step 2.3.5, onto 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophorese at 200 V for approximately 45-50 min in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) buffer.\nTransfer the separated proteins to nitrocellulose membrane at 400 mA for 2 h in transfer buffer.

Assembly of splicing reaction and analysis of products\nPreparation of the splicing substrate\n\t​NOTE: The pre-mRNA substrate, designated MINX, contains two exon sequences and one intron sequence from Adenovirus22. The MINX DNA sequence in the plasmid is under the control of T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase promoters. The materials and detailed methods for the linearization of the MINX plasmid DNA with BamHI restriction endonuclease, transcription by SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of α-32P[GTP] and the purification of 32P-labeled MINX for splicing assays are described previously19 (see steps 2.2 and 3.2 of that reference).\n\t\nStore the radiolabeled MINX as an ethanol precipitate at -20 °C; use the labeled splicing substrate within 4-6 weeks post transcription.\nJust before use, centrifuge the ethanol precipitated 32P-labeled MINX at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C; remove the supernatant with a micropipettor and discard.\nAdd 150 µL of 70% ethanol and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.
