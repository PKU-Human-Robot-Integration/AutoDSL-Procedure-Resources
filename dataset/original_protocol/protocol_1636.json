    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of conditioned medium of mammalian cells containing secreted POI (clusterin)-RFP-GFP-His protein\nTiming: 6 days\nCollect the secreted POI-RFP-GFP-His protein from conditioned medium. Two hundred milliliters of conditioned medium (from 20 100-mm culture dishes) yields about 1 mg of purified protein.\nCulture Flp-in T-REx HEK293 cells stably expressing clusterin-RFP-GFP-His (∼1.5 × 106 cells per dish) in 20 100-mm culture dishes with complete DMEM containing 0.1 mg/mL doxycycline at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nWhen the cells reach 70–80% confluence (∼6 × 106 cells per dish), exchange the medium for advanced DMEM medium with 0.1 mg/mL doxycycline.\nCritical: Do not add FBS to advanced DMEM, because this decreases the purity of the purified protein.\nRemove the culture medium and wash the cells with 3 mL of PBS per 100-mm dish.\nAdd 10 mL of advanced DMEM medium with doxycycline to each 100-mm dish and culture for 4 days.\nCollect the conditioned medium\nTransfer the conditioned medium into 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tubes at 780 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove dead cells and debris.\nTransfer supernatant to a 200 mL bottle (any freezable bottle or tube) and store at −80°C until purification.\nCritical: To prevent photobleaching, samples should be shielded from light in subsequent experiments.\nPause point: The collected medium can be stored at −80°C for a few years.\nPurification of secreted POI (clusterin)-RFP-GFP-His protein from conditioned medium of mammalian cells\nTiming: 10 h\nPurify the fusion protein secreted by the stable cell line from the conditioned medium by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.\nPurify secreted clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.\nTransfer 1 mL (bed volume) of Ni-NTA agarose resin into a gravity-flow column.\nEquilibrate the Ni-NTA agarose resin with 10 mL of column wash buffer 1.",
    "Add 10 mM imidazole to the supernatant (containing POI) to reduce non-specific binding of protein to resin.\nOptional: Retain 20 μL of the supernatant for the analysis by SDS-PAGE.\nLoad the supernatant onto the column.\nOptional: Retain 20 μL of the flowthrough for the analysis by SDS-PAGE.\nWash the resin four times with 10 mL of column wash buffer 2.\nElute the clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein with column elution buffer and collect each elution fraction into a 1.5 mL tube.\nApply 0.5 mL of elution buffer and collect the eluate into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (Fr.1).\nApply 1 mL of elution buffer and collect the eluate into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (Fr.2).\nApply 1 mL of elution buffer and collect the eluate into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (Fr.3).\nApply 0.5 mL of elution buffer and collect the eluate into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (Fr.4).\nApply 0.5 mL of elution buffer and collect the eluate into a fresh 1.5 mL tube (Fr.5)\nOptional: Retain 20 μL of each elution fraction for CBB staining.\nNote: Detect the fractions containing protein by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and pool (fractions 2 and 3 usually contain eluted protein).\nRemove imidazole from the purified protein by ultrafiltration.\nCritical: More than 2 mM imidazole in culture medium interferes with lysosomal activity (Liu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Therefore, it is necessary to remove imidazole from purified proteins for the internalization assay.\nOptional: Dialysis is also suitable instead of ultrafiltration.\nConcentrate the purified protein and bring the buffer to a 0.2-mL final volume using the Microsep advance centrifugal (ultrafiltration) device (30 kDa MWCO) at 2,380 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the flow-through and add 2 mL of cold PBS to the centrifugal device.\nRepeat steps a and b at least three times.",
    "Transfer the concentrate to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nMeasure the concentration by determining the OD280, and store at −80°C.\nNote: 10% glycerol in storage buffer may prevent the aggregation of purified protein during freeze/thaw.\nAnalyze the purification by SDS-PAGE with CBB staining (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1197-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Purification of clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein from conditioned medium of mammalian cells\n(A) Schematic of the purification of secreted protein from conditioned medium.\n(B) Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining of clusterin-RFP-GFP-His. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and CBB staining.\nAdd an equal volume of 2× sample buffer to each fraction and boil at 95°C for 5 min.\nSeparate the fractions by SDS-PAGE and stain with CBB-R250.\nFlow-cytometric analysis of the internalization of GFP-RFP-labeled protein\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes measurement of lysosomal degradation of extracellular clusterin-RFP-GFP-His with misfolded proteins in mammalian cells based on the green and red fluorescence intensities.\nOn day 1, passage HEK293 cells (or the desired cell line for internalization of the POI) and seed at ∼5 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate with complete DMEM.\nOn day 2, cells should be 40%–60% confluent (∼1 × 105 cells per well). Culture cells with or without clusterin-RFP-GFP-His and unfolded protein substrate.\nAdd 0.06 μM Clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein with or without 2.2 μM luciferase to 250 μL advanced DMEM in a 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: For the internalization of other POIs, it may be necessary to optimize the concentration of POI and composition of culture medium.\nTo denature the substrate (luciferase), incubate advanced DMEM with or without luciferase and clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein at 42°C for 20 min.",
    "Wash HEK293 cells with serum-free DMEM and exchange the medium for advanced DMEM treated as in b, and culture for 14 h in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. If HEK293 cells are aggregated after medium exchange, dissociate the cells by pipetting so as not to interfere with internalization efficiency.\nNote: Contamination by FBS might affect the internalization of clusterin.\nNote: Culture time is dependent on internalization efficiency.\nOn day 3, collect the cells and analyze by flow cytometry.\nWash the cells with PBS.\nDiscard the PBS, add 100 μL of trypsin solution, and incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL of FACS buffer and suspend the cells by pipetting.\nNote: Bovine serum in FACS buffer is used for trypsin inhibition.\nPass the resuspended cells through a cell strainer and transfer the cells to a 5 mL round-bottom tube.\nSet up a flow cytometer. Place the 5 mL tube on the sample collector and run the samples.\nSelect a cell population and exclude debris by setting the cell size and granularity parameters (forward-scatter area [FSC-A] vs. side-scatter area [SSC-A]).\nExclude duplet cells (side-scatter height [SSC-H] vs. side-scatter width [SSC-W]).\nExclude dead cells (forward-scatter area [FSC-A] vs. DAPI area [DAPI-A]). DAPI is detected at 405 nm excitation with a 450/45-nm bandpass filter.\nsfGFP is detected at 488 nm excitation with a 525/40-nm bandpass filter. mCherry is detected at 561 nm excitation with a 585/42-nm bandpass filter.\nImmunoblot analysis of the internalization of GFP-RFP labeled protein\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThis step describes measurement of the lysosomal degradation of extracellular Clusterin-RFP-GFP-His with misfolded protein in mammalian culture cells by immunoblot of RFP, which is acid- and protease-resistant.",
    "On day 1, passage HEK293 cells (or the desired cell line for internalization of the POI) and seed at 20–40% confluence in a 12-well plate with complete DMEM.\nOn day 2, cells should be 40–60% confluent. Culture cells with or without clusterin-RFP-GFP-His and unfolded protein substrate.\nNote: Treat as in step 8.\nAdd 0.06 μM clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein with or without 2.2 μM luciferase to 500 μL of advanced DMEM in a 1.5 mL tube.\nTo denature the substrate (luciferase), incubate advanced DMEM with or without luciferase and clusterin-RFP-GFP-His protein at 42°C for 20 min.\nWash HEK293 cells with serum-free DMEM and exchange the medium for advanced DMEM treated as in b, and culture for 14 h in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nOn day 3, lyse the cells and perform immunoblotting.\nWash the cells with cold PBS.\nDiscard the PBS and add 500 μL of cold PBS.\nScrape and transfer the cells to a fresh 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 2,380 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and lyse the cells with 50 μL of lysis buffer.\nIncubate the lysate on ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 20,620 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL tube, and prepare for immunoblotting\nMeasure the protein concentration of the supernatant by Bradford assay (or another standard method).\nMix 40 μL of the supernatant with 10 μL of 6× sample buffer and boil for 5 min at 95°C.\nLoad 10–20 μg of protein per lane and perform SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using standard procedures with a monoclonal anti-RFP antibody (1:1,000 dilution) and monoclonal anti-α tubulin antibody (1:1,000 dilution) together with an anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000 dilution).\nOptional: If needed, lysosomal degradation of POI can be examined using anti-POI antibody."
