    "Use of the animals and protocol procedures were approved and supervised by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Iowa State University (Ames, IA, USA)\n1. Growing of Mixed Glial Cultures\nDecapitate 1- 2 day-old pups quickly with 5.5 inch operating scissors, and place the heads immediately in a 50 mL tube on ice. Note that this decapitation is the mode of euthanasia.\nIn a laminar airflow hood, make a small incision in the skull and meninges using 4.5 inch straight micro-dissecting scissors. Begin cutting from the caudal end to the rostral end (nose). Get underneath the skin by using the opening formed by the decapitation.\nAfter the incision, peel one of the hemispheres to the side. Then use a pair of curved or hooked tweezers to remove the entire brain.\nImmerse the brain(s) in a new 50 mL tube containing 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetate acid (EDTA) for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath. Use 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA per brain.\nWash the brain(s) with fresh Growth Media (10% FBS, DMEM/F12, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% non-essential amino acids) by adding and removing the media. Repeat this 4x.\nFor each brain, plate two T-75 flasks containing growth media. Therefore, add 2 mL of growth media per brain to the tube. Thus, it will be an equivalent of 1 mL of homogenized brain with 8-9 mL of growth media per T-75 flask.\nHomogenize by triturating the brain(s) with pipettes of differing aperture sizes, in order from largest to smallest. When it is visible that the brain tissue is not getting smaller, transition to the next pipette. At the end of the trituration, the suspension should be clear, with no visible chunks.",
    "Use a 25 mL pipette, 5 mL pipette, and then a 10 mL pipette sequentially.\nPass each homogenous brain suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer to make it into a single cell culture.\nFor each homogenized brain, plate two T-75 flasks containing growth media, as described in step 1.5 (1 mL of homogenized brain with 8-9 mL of growth media per T-75 flask).\nChange growth media after 6 d and grow until isolation on the 16th day.\n2. Isolation of Microglial Cells\nAfter 16 days, remove the growth media from the flask and place it in a fresh 50 mL tube. Add 3 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to each T-75 flask. Shake the flasks for 5 min at RT on an orbital shaker.\nCentrifuge the removed growth media at 0.4 x g for 5 min and use to stop the trypsin-EDTA reaction in the subsequent step.\nAfter shaking for 5 min, add a minimum of 4 mL of growth media (fresh or the used media from 2.1.1) to stop the trypsin-EDTA reaction.\nTriturate to ensure that all the cells have been detached.\nAfter trituration, pass the cells through a 70 μm cell strainer to make it into a single cell culture, perform a cell count, and then spin down the cells at 0.4 x g for 5 min.\nFor every 100 x 106 cells (roughly 15 x T-75 flasks), use 1 mL of Recommended Media (2% FBS, DPBS (calcium and magnesium chloride-free), 1 mM EDTA) to resuspend the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: All following steps are tailored for a 1 mL separation.",
    "Take a 5 mL polystyrene tube, add 1 mL of Recommended Media, and mark the meniscus. Add Recommended Media up to 2.5 mL and mark this as well. Discard the Recommended Media and transfer the re-suspended cells to the 5 mL polystyrene tube.\nAdd 50 µL of rat serum for every 1 mL of suspended cells. Incubate for 5 min at RT.\nPrepare selection cocktail by mixing 25 µL of component A and 25 µL of component B. These components are proprietary.\nAdd 50 µL of the selection cocktail to the cells. Incubate for 5 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: For purer cultures, repeat step 2.9 (recommended but not mandatory).\nVortex microspheres for 45 s. Add 80 µL of microspheres per 1 mL of sample. Incubate for 3 min at RT.\nBring the volume to 2.5 mL in the polystyrene tube by adding the Recommended Media.\nPut the tube in the magnet for 3 min at room temperature. Adjust the incubation to increase purity. Slowly pour out the Recommended Media into a 15 mL tube with the magnet still in the polystyrene tube.\nRepeat step 2.12 three more times. Additional magnetic incubations may be performed to increase purity.\nAdd 3 mL of growth media and count the number of cells using a cell counter.\nPlate cells accordingly in Poly-D-Lysine (PDL)-coated plates for treatments. Treat the cells 48 h after seeding inPDL-coated plates. This allows the cells to recover from the stress of separation.\n\tNOTE: Check the purity of the culture using immunocytochemistry as described previously15.\nPlate the negative fraction (collected in a 15 mL tube), which mostly contains astrocytes, in T-75 flasks in the growth medium.",
    "After at least 6 h of incubation in 37 °C incubator, change the medium and let it grow O/N. Split the astrocytes the next day for treatments.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
