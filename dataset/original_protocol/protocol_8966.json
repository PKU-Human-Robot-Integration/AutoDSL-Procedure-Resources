    "1. Developmental Delay/Lethality Assay: The Wild-Type (N2) and Two Mutant (Mut1 and Mut2) Strains Are Tested in Three Clozapine Concentrations in a 12-well Plate\nOn day 1, pour 2 ml NGM medium10 into each well of a 12-well plate (each well with a 2 cm diameter) and allow to harden on the bench at room temperature (RT) overnight. The same day, pick a colony of Escherichia coli OP50 bacteria, infect a bottle of 50 ml LB solution, and culture it in a 37 °C shaker at 220 rpm rotation overnight.\nOn day 2, transfer 20 µl OP50 bacterial culture onto the center of each NGM well. Incubate the plates in a 37 °C incubator or leave them at RT overnight to allow the bacterial lawn to grow thicker.\nMake an 80 mM clozapine stock solution by dissolving clozapine in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) solvent. Then make an 80 µl working solution with the stock solution diluted in 1.7 mM acetic acid based on Table 1.\nNote: The working solution for a particular drug of interest must be determined by doing a series of preliminary concentration tests to find the most appropriate concentration for distinguishing the wild type from the mutants.\nTransfer 80 µl clozapine working solution onto the seeded NGM plate well and swirl the plate to allow the solution to distribute evenly on the surface. Wait for the plate to dry. Use the plate for the assay on the same day or place it in a 20 °C incubator to be used the next day.\nNote: The working solution is a drug suspension due to the low solubility of clozapine, especially at higher concentration. Therefore, vortex the tube before transferring the solution to the drug plate in order to guarantee that the drug concentration is accurate.",
    "Wash worms off a 3.5 cm plate containing many gravid adults with M9 buffer and then spin them down in a 15 ml tube at 2,000 rpm for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant. Add 5 ml bleach solution (NaOH:hypochlorite:ddH2O at 4:1:5) and disrupt the nematodes by gently inverting the tubes.\nObserve the animals until half of them are dissolved at around 5 min. Spin down the eggs at 2,000 rpm for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 14 ml M9 buffer rapidly.\nSpin down the eggs at 2,000 rpm for 1 min and aspirate the supernatant, leaving approximately 100 µl solution. Vortex to suspend the eggs.\nTransfer 2 µl eggs suspended in M9 onto a regular NGM plate to test how many eggs are transferred. Adjust the volume of the suspended eggs to ensure that there are approximately 30-35 eggs in each transfer. Transfer 30-35 eggs to each well of the assay plate, and then incubate in a 20 °C incubator for 24 hr.\nOn the first day of the assay, score the number of eggs hatched. Adjust the total number of hatched animals to 25/well by picking off the extra worms if necessary.\nOn the following days, observe the animals and score them every 24 hr. Developmental stage is scored based on the size of the animal and the shape of the vulva11. The experiment lasts 5-6 days with the most robust effect typically seen on the third or fourth day.\nInput the data into an Excel file and calculate the percentage of animals at each developmental stage for every day of the experiment. Generate graphs with the function '100% Stacked Column' in the '2-D column' menu.\n2. Pharyngeal Pumping Assay: Young Adult Animals for the Wild-type and Mutant Strains Are Scored on Clozapine Assay Plates",
    "The assay plate is made following the same protocol used for the developmental delay/lethality assay.\nPick 50 L4 animals for each strain to seeded NGM plates 24 hr before the assay and incubate the worms at 20 °C.\nPick 10 animals to an assay plate well. Then pick 10 animals to the next well every 15-20 min.\nAfter the animals in the first well have been exposed to drug for 30 min, start the assay by observing pharyngeal pumping under a dissection microscope and score the pumps for 20 sec9. Once pharyngeal pumping is scored, pick the worm off the plate.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
