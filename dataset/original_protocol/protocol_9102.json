    "NOTE: The coding sequence for which the signal peptide is deleted is cloned in the pOPINF vector following a standard in-fusion protocol; the native protein is expressed as a His-tag fusion in Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta cells28,29. The selenomethionine labeled variant is expressed following standard methods according to the manufacturer30. The recombinant SBP is purified as previously described31,32.\n1. Biochemical Characterization\nThermal shift assay\n\t\nPrepare 48 buffer solutions with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.5 and NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 M, and dispense 40 µL in a 96-well plate as described in Table 133.\nAdd to each well 5 µL of the SBP solution at 1 - 2 mg/mL concentration.\nAdd to each well 5 µL of 20x fluorescent stain for proteins (see Table of Materials).\nMix the solutions by pipetting, seal the plate using a transparent adhesive film, and spin for 2 min at 112 x g at room temperature.\nRun the experiment on a real-time machine: Set a temperature ramp of 3 °C/min from 4 to 99 °C with a 10 s hold time, and read the fluorescence every 0.5 °C with excitation at 483 nm and emission at 568 nm.\nAnalyze the fluorescence emission curves for every buffer condition, identifying the melting temperature (Tm) as the minimum of the derivative.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure gives a good indication of the best buffer solution to aid in improvement of protein stability. Choose the pH range and salt concentration based on the buffer condition with the highest Tm and add 2.5% (v/v) of glycerol and 0.5 mM of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to define the buffer solution for the following steps (SEC-buffer).\nMALS and analytical SEC",
    "Perform a two-column volume wash of the pre-packed gel filtration column with degassed filtered water (use a wide range molecular weight 24 mL column).\nConnect the column to the light scattering detector and equilibrate the column with the determined SEC-buffer from the thermal shift assay.\nInject 100 µL of purified SBP at 5 mg/mL into the equilibrated SEC column and flow one column volume of SEC-buffer.\nCheck the elution chromatogram for single or multiple peaks and examine the scattering data using the analysis software, obtaining the molar mass and the polydispersity index for all species.\n\t\tNOTE: For every peak corresponding to an oligomeric species, it is beneficial to check the polydispersity index calculated as molar mass weighted on mass/molar mass weighted on number of molecules (Mw/Mn). A polydispersity value close to 1 indicates a monodispersed peak.\n\t\tNOTE: Once all the oligomerization species are defined, it is useful to study their dependence on protein concentration, as higher concentrations might favor larger oligomer formation.\nExecute multiple analytical SEC runs; inject 100 µL of purified SBP at increasing concentrations (0.1 - 10 mg/mL) into the equilibrated gel filtration column (use a wide range molecular weight 5 mL column) and flow one column volume of SEC-buffer each time.\nCheck the elution chromatogram for single or multiple peaks and analyze the absorbance intensities at 280 nm of the curves corresponding to different starting protein concentrations. If the relative intensities of the different peaks remain constant, then no inter-conversion between the oligomeric species is present. Variation in the relative intensities at different concentrations is an indication of the interconversion between different oligomeric species that is dependent on the protein concentration.",
    "NOTE: This characterization step is fundamental to define which species are more suitable for crystallization. Indeed, distinct monodispersed species are more prone to crystallize if they are in a steady oligomeric state at a defined concentration.\n2. Protein Preparation and Crystallization\nPreparative SEC\n\t\nAfter a one-column volume wash with degassed filtered water, equilibrate with SEC-buffer the preparative pre-packed gel filtration column (a wide range molecular weight 120 mL column).\nInject 1 - 5 mL of purified SBP at 5-50 mg/mL into the equilibrated gel filtration column and flow one column volume of SEC-buffer.\nCollect the column flow-through in 1 mL fractions.\nPool the fractions corresponding to a single monodisperse peak; spin the sample in 15 mL centrifugation filters at 1,500 g and quantify the concentration until the desired concentration is attained (typically 50 - 100 mg/mL for SP0092).\nCrystallization\n\t\nDetermine the optimal concentration range for the crystallization experiment using the Pre-Crystallization Test as described by the manufacturer:\n\t\t\nDispense 0.5 - 1.0 mL of each of the four crystallization test solutions in a different reservoir of a 24-well sitting drop crystallization plate.\nPrepare the crystallization drops by mixing 1 µL of protein solution with 1 µL of reservoir solution, seal the plate, and incubate at room temperature for no less than 1 h (more reliable results are obtained after overnight incubation).\nCheck the drop quality for each concentration using a 10x magnification microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Test at least three different protein concentration: (I) most of the drops remaining clear indicate that the protein is too dilute for crystallization; (II) the presence of heavy precipitate in the majority of the drops implies an excessively high concentration; and (III) a balanced occurrence of both clear drops and precipitate (better if light) is a good indication that the tested concentration is favorable for crystallization.",
    "Prepare the 96-well sitting drop crystallization plates; dispense 100 µL of different commercial crystallization solution in each reservoir well34,35,36,37.\nDispense 100 nL of protein sample at the previously defined concentration (step 1.1.6) in all the crystallization drop wells using a crystallization robotic system.\nDispense 100 nL of the different reservoir solutions to the corresponding crystallization drop wells to mix with protein dispensed in step 2.2.3. Seal the crystallization plate to avoid evaporation and enable the equilibration of the crystallization drop with the reservoir.\nCheck the drops periodically (initially every 1 - 2 days, later every week) using a 10x (at least) magnification microscope to evaluate crystal formation and growth.\n\t\tNOTE: An automated imaging system for protein crystallization can be used for drops visualization and capturing.\n3. Crystal Characterization and X-ray Data Collection\nCrystal mounting\n\t\nPrepare the cryoprotectant solution by adding 25% (v/v) of glycerol (final concentration) to the crystallization condition (thus replacing 25% of water in the initial mixture)38.\nFill a foam dewar with liquid nitrogen and place the sample enclosure part of a uni-puck into the dewar. Allow it to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature.\nCut and remove the sealing tape from the crystallization plate over the drop where the crystals are formed.\nPlace a drop of 1 µL of cryoprotectant solution onto a coverslide positioned in close proximity of the target drop.\nTransfer the selected crystal from the original drop to the cryoprotectant solution drop using a nylon cryo-loop on a SPINE standard base mounted on a magnetic wand39,40.\nQuickly transfer the crystal from the cryoprotectant drop to liquid nitrogen, placing the loop into the first empty position of the uni-puck sample holder.\nRepeat (from the sealing tape cut step) until all the desired crystals are harvested and stored in the uni-puck sample holder.",
    "Place the uni-puck base on the uni-puck using the puck wand and take the puck to the beamline (under liquid nitrogen conditions).\n\t\tCAUTION: Extremely low temperature!\nUse the cryo-tongs and the puck dewar loading tool to load the uni-puck(s) into the beamline sample changer robot dewar. The uni-puck sample holder will detach from the base lid leaving the sample loop holders upright in the sample robot dewar and thus exposed to the liquid nitrogen and accessible to the sample changer robot.\nCrystal characterization\n\tNOTE: The harvested crystals can then be screened for diffraction quality using either a laboratory X-ray source or at a synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray source. Macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines provide a tunable energy source to exploit anomalous diffraction for structure solution. In the following section, a series of working instructions in line with the experimental capabilities of Diamond Light Source MX beamlines is proposed, but these guidelines can also be adapted to MX beamlines at other synchrotrons worldwide.\n\t\nAs a first step, it is useful to either confirm or identify anomalous scatterers in the crystal. This can be conveniently achieved by measuring an X-ray fluorescence spectrum from the crystal. First ensure the X-ray energy of the beamline is set high enough to excite all elements typically expected for macromolecular crystals (14 keV or higher).\nUse the beamline control software to select the sample to be mounted by the sample changer robot; the loop will be automatically centered in the X-ray beam and the crystal centering can be confirmed manually using the beamline control software.",
    "Record an X-ray fluorescence spectrum using the beamline control software: the user selects an exposure time and initiates the measurement (Fluorescence/Fluorescence Spectrum Setting, → Run, Figure 2A). The beamline control software automatically positions the X-ray fluorescence detector in place and determines the minimum incident X-ray flux to obtain a readable signal on the fluorescence detector. The acquired spectrum is then analyzed in an automated fashion with emission peaks fitted to naturally occurring biological elements. These routines are available within the beamline control software graphical user interface (GUI) - GDA (www.opengda.org) at our company and at synchrotrons throughout Europe41,42.\nIf suitable elements are identified that can be exploited for an anomalous diffraction experiment, perform an X-ray absorption edge energy scan to determine the optimal wavelength for collection of anomalous diffraction data from the crystal: on the beamline control software, select the element and initiate the scan (Fluorescence/Fluorescence Scan Setting, → Atom name, → Run, Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: For a single anomalous diffraction experiment, the peak of the absorption edge is used to maximize the anomalous scattering. Experimental considerations for performing a multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment have been previously detailed43.\nTo determine the crystal unit cell parameters, symmetry, and diffraction limit, measure three X-ray diffraction patterns at 45° intervals using the oscillation method (Data Collection/Screening → Run current, Figure 2C). The beamline control software provides the user with a choice of oscillation angle and exposure time, and the ability to set the percentage transmission of the X-ray beam. For a standard crystal screening, an oscillation angle of 0.5°, an exposure time of 0.5 s, and 5% X-ray beam transmission are recommended. The measured diffraction images are automatically analyzed by the EDNA pipeline and return a set of strategies for collection of a complete data set22.\nX-ray data collection",
    "NOTE: The user can select to collect data in standard oscillation mode or inverse beam mode, which enables Friedel mates to be recorded close in time and X-ray dose, and with approximately the same absorption behavior allowing a more accurate measurement of anomalous differences. The latter is useful especially if small anomalous differences are expected and/or the samples are radiation sensitive when carrying out an anomalous diffraction experiment. Considerations on the best data collection strategies to use have been comprehensively reviewed22,23,44,45,46,47.\n\t\nUsing the beamline control software, import the data collection parameters as suggested by the strategy program which will provide:\n\t\ti. Start position of the ω-rotation axis\n\t\tii. Oscillation width of the ω-axis rotation angle for each diffraction image\n\t\tiii. Exposure time for each diffraction image\n\t\tiv. Number of images for a complete dataset (indirectly defining the total ω-axis rotation angle for the whole data collection)\n\t\tv. Percentage of attenuation of the X-ray beam to avoid over-exposure and radiation damage",
    "NOTE: At our institution, for running the data collection, the software pipelines for automated processing of the collected data are well established: (i) The diffraction data are reduced (indexed, integrated, and scaled) by the xia2 pipeline, which generates reflection mtz files for the user as input for phasing and structure solution/refinement48. (ii) When a significant anomalous signal is detected during data analysis, a first rapid automated structure solution pipeline (fast_ep) using SHELX attempts to solve the heavy atom substructure by experimental phasing, providing a phased electron density map where feasible. A second more comprehensive structure solution pipeline automatically undertakes attempts to solve and build the structure using independent software suites49,50,51,52; in cases where this is successful, the user will be provided with an initial model and electron density map. This provides the basis for the user to complete refinement and validate the model with the crystallographic software suites of choice."
