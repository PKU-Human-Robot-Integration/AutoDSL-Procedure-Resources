    "All the procedures in the following protocol were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital for application on patients on December, 15, 2012.\n1. Patient Preparation\nUse the following inclusion criteria: abnormal uterine bleeding; fibroids compressing surrounding organs and causing urinary, digestive, or sexual symptoms; infertility; fibroid is larger than 4 cm while the patient is preparing for pregnancy.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: suspected malignancy; suspected fibroid degeneration; pedunculated, cervical, or intra-broad ligamentous fibroids; preoperative use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues; acute systemic inflammation or pelvic inflammatory disease; patient is currently pregnant, within puerperium, or within three months after abortion; severe coagulation disorders; any other contraindications for general anesthesia or laparoscopy.\nConduct a pelvic palpation and ultrasound examination to determine the location, number, and size of the fibroids.\nInform the patient of the benefits and risks of surgery and obtain written consent, discussing the risks of excessive bleeding and blood transfusion, conversion to laparotomy, tumor cell dissemination during the operation, and postoperative infection.\nPerform the surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Administer to each patient a prophylactic antibiotic dosage of 2 g of cefamandole intravenously 30 min before induction of anesthesia.\n2. Pre-IRCP Preparation\nAfter standard skin sterilization, establish the ports by standard techniques: a 10 mm umbilical port, and 5 mm and 10 mm ancillary ports in the lower abdomen. Connect the 5 mm port with a plastic tube for vacuum drainage, which can suck the smoke during surgery.\nDuring the surgery, have an anesthesiologist carefully monitor vital signs of the patient.\nMaintain the intraabdominal pressure and gas flow rate at 13 kPa and 12 L/min, respectively.\n3. Intracapsular Rotary-cut Procedure (IRCP)",
    "Inspect the pelvis carefully to confirm the size, number, and location of the fibroids. Inject an ischemic solution (6 U pituitrin and 20 U oxytocin diluted in 10 mL of saline) into the myometrium around the fibroids with a 10 mL syringe.\nDetermine the incision position on the most-protruding site of the fibroid and incise longitudinally by a monopolar hook electrode at low wattage (30 W), ensuring the length is no longer than half of the fibroid diameter. Open the pseudo-capsule by a longitudinal cut to expose the fibroid surface (Figure 1A).\nHold the fibroid with the laparoscopic forceps and pull it outward, keeping a certain tension to expose the boundary between the fibroid and the pseudo-capsule (Figure 1B).\nPerform multiple rotary cuts on the fibroid (Figure 1C1) with a monopolar electrical knife in depths of 5–10 mm, shrinking the diameter of the tumor (Figure 1C2) and ensuring not to cut any pieces of the fibroid off.\nMeanwhile, keep pulling outward to facilitate further exposure of the gap between the fibroid and the pseudo-capsule. Remove the smoke by vacuum drainage to keep a clear field.\nRepeat the cutting-pulling procedures on the fibroid in the manner described above with 10 mm intervals, ensuring that each cut is at a certain distance with the prior cut, until the longest dimension of the fibroid is outside the incision. Then, the fibroid will be squeezed out by contraction of the pseudo-capsule and myometrium (Figure 1D). Avoid pulling too hard and blunt dissection to protect fibers and vessels of the pseudo-capsule.",
    "Gently pull the fibroid outward, and the pseudo-capsule should slip off to the base of the fibroid. Continue the cuts on the fibroid until the base of the fibroid is exposed and isolate it from its pseudo-capsule (Figure 1E). Use bipolar electrocautery forceps to coagulate and cut off the blood vessels, always at 30 W. After removal of the fibroid, only a shallow residual cavity is left (Figure 1F).\nClose the residual cavity in a single layer with a 30 cm 1-0 polyglyconate unidirectional barbed thread. Begin the running suture at 5 mm outside of the incisal edge with 1 cm increments. Make sure that the stitching passes through the bottom of the residual cavity, and leave no dead space.\nNOTE: Generally, a single-layer suture is enough to close the residual cavity (Figures 1G and 1H). Occasionally, the fibroid was over 12 cm in diameter and occupied more than 2/3 of the myometrium. In these cases, a \"folding suture\" can be adopted, in which the myometrium on one side of the incision can be sutured on top of the other side to close the residual cavity and strengthen the myometrium.\nAfter suturing, enlarge the 10 mm port to a 15–20 mm port for the introduction of the morcellator. Morcellate the fibroids with a reusable morcellator.\n4. Postoperative Management\nDocument the intra- and post-operative parameters carefully, including the diameters of the fibroids (represented by the diameter of the largest one in cases of multiple fibroids), operation time (from the beginning of incision to the end of suturing), blood loss (calculated by vacuum drainage), and rate of conversion to laparotomy.\nFollow up patients by pelvic examination and ultrasound as well as phone interviews.",
