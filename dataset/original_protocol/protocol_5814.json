    "Remove all open flowers from petunia plants growing in the greenhouse 1 day before protoplast isolation (this will ensure that all open flowers are at a similar developmental stage, i.e., anthesis on the following day, Figure 1).Flower collection and preparation for protoplast isolation (DAY 1)Collect open flowers from plants growing in the greenhouse. Select completely opened flowers (at anthesis) and place them in a 600-ml beaker with 75 ml tap water. For a standard procedure, use 24 flowers which will roughly fit into four 90 x 15 mm Petri dishes at Step A7.All following steps must be performed in a flow hood to maintain sterility. Prepare 3 beakers, one containing 250 ml 5% hypochlorite and two containing 350 ml DDW. In addition, prepare four 90 x 15 mm Petri dishes containing 20 ml enzyme solution each.Immerse each flower using a pair of forceps in the 5% hypochlorite beaker for 30 sec and then rinse twice consecutively by immersing and shaking carefully in the DDW beakers.Place the sterilized flowers on clean sterile paper sheets and cut roughly 1-2 cm below the corolla (Figure 1). Remove all flower organs: stamens, flower tube, calyx, etc. (leave only the corolla). Repeat for all flowers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701204505_0375.jpgFigure 1. Cutting below the corolla to remove all flower organsGently pierce each flower corolla using the kenzan needle point holder with the adaxial side facing up (Figure 2). Proceed immediately to the next step to prevent dehydration of the corolla.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701204534_9359.jpgFigure 2. Flower corolla placed on kenzan needle point holder with adaxial side facing upCut the flower in half and carefully place it in a Petri dish containing enzyme solution with the adaxial side facing down. Repeat this step for all flowers (approximately 12 halves fit in each dish) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701204613_7857.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Flower halves placed in a Petri dish containing enzyme solutionClose the four Petri dishes, seal with Parafilm, cover with aluminum foil and incubate in the dark overnight (around 12 h) at 25 °C.Protoplast isolation and glycoside extraction from vacuoles (Day 2)Protoplast isolation and vacuole isolation Shake the covered plates for no more than 30 min at Room Temperature at 10 rpm.Place the 100-µm cell strainer on top of four 50-ml centrifuge tubes.Wet all filters with 3 ml suspension buffer.Gently shake the plates again by hand for a few seconds (to resuspend the cells). Using a sterile plastic 1-ml cut pipette tip, carefully collect the liquid from one Petri dish, tilt the 50-ml tube and overlay on the cell strainer. Repeat this step until all of the liquid has passed through the mesh (Figure 4). Repeat this step for the three remaining plates, collecting the liquid into the other three 50-ml tubes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701204922_0779.jpgFigure 4. Collecting the protoplastsImmediately after removing the enzyme liquid mix, use 5 ml suspension buffer to wash two dishes (this allows you to collect any protoplasts remaining in the Petri dish). Distribute the final liquid equally between the two tubes. Do the same for the other two dishes. Gently drip 5 ml suspension buffer onto each cell strainer to release protoplasts from the petal debris stuck on the mesh.Centrifuge (5810 R) the four tubes for 15 min at 100 x g at room temperature (RT) using a swing-out rotor, with acceleration set to 2 and brake (deceleration) to 0. Living protoplasts will float whereas cell debris will be pelleted (Figure 5). Keep the tube stable as movement will cause the layers to mix.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701205001_2736.jpgFigure 5.

Filter flask connected to vacuum pumpWith the valve closed, start the vacuum pump and push the pipette very gently through the upper layer with the protoplasts. When the pipette has passed through the protoplast layer, slowly open the valve to initiate suction and suck up the pellet of debris and as much medium as possible but not the protoplasts (Video 1). Remember to close the valve and reduce the suction well before the protoplasts reach the bottom of the tube or your yield will be very low.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Removal of debris in the suspension solution Bring each tube to 25 ml with suspension buffer.Repeat Steps B7-B10 twice.Centrifuge again (4th time) and remove ca. 22 ml of debris using a Pasteur pipette, leaving 3 ml of protoplast solution. Do not leave more than 3 ml in each tube for the lysis to work.Count the cells under a microscope using a hemocytometer (see Data analysis; yield should be ca. 14 x 106 protoplasts/ml) (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701205301_1283.jpgFigure 7. Light microscopy of protoplasts. Scale bar = 45 μm.Add 10.5 ml warm (37 °C) lysis buffer to each protoplast-containing tube, pipette 5-8 times (with a cut tip) and incubate at RT for 2 min. Divide the contents of each tube evenly into two 15-ml tubes. Now you will have 8 tubes. With a 5-ml tip placed along the side of the wall and close to the surface of the liquid, add 4 ml 5% Ficoll to each of the tubes.As in Step B16, add 1.5 ml ice-cold vacuole buffer (0% Ficoll) to each of the tubes.Centrifuge all 8 tubes at 2,000 x g for 45 min at RT using a swing-out rotor, with acceleration = 2 and brake = 0.Vacuoles will accumulate between the 0% and 5% Ficoll fractions.",
    "Gently remove the upper vacuole-free Ficoll layer (transparent), and carefully transfer the vacuoles (ca. 1.5 ml) into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube with a 200-µl tip (with cut end), inserting it along the wall of the tube. Analyze vacuole intactness by light microscopy (Figure 8). Vacuoles can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 day (see Note 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701205334_4005.jpgFigure 8. Ficoll fraction containing vacuoles after centrifugation. Light microscopy of intact vacuoles is shown in the inset. Scale bar = 10 μm.Glycoside extraction from vacuoles Transfer 0.5 ml of vacuole solution into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube (at least in triplicate to allow statistical analyses). Add 1.2 ml of 80% Methyl alcohol to each tube.Vortex vigorously for 10 sec.Sonicate for 20 min ( 60 Hz), vortex for 10 sec every 5 min.Vortex vigorously for 10 sec.Centrifuge (5430 R) at RT for 15 min at 16,000 x g.Incubate for 1 min at RT.Without disturbing the pellet, transfer the supernatant (ca.1.5 ml) from each tube to new 2-ml Eppendorf tubes.Fully evaporate (up to overnight) all of the liquid in a heated speed-vac (300 x g, 36 °C).Fractionation of volatile aglycones (DAY 3)Add 900 µl warm (37 °C) citrate-phosphate buffer per tube with the dry pellet of extracted glycosides.Vortex vigorously until pellet is dissolved.Add 150 µl Viscozyme enzyme mixture to each tube.Vortex vigorously for 10 sec.Carefully (very slowly) add 728 µl hexane standard solution to each tube. Incubate statically in the dark at 37 °C for 8 h.Shake for 2 h at 300 rpm, RT.Centrifuge at 10,500 x g for 10 min at RT.Transfer the upper hexane phase into a 4-ml glass vial. Keep the samples at -20 °C.Transfer 100 µl of hexane solution into a 100-μl insert placed in a 2-ml glass vial.Proceed with GC-MS analyses."
