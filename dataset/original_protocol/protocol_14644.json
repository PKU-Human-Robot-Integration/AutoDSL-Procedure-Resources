    "NOTE: The following FMD procedure is routinely conducted during vascular assessment studies in the Laboratory of Integrative Vascular and Exercise Physiology (LIVEP). All procedures followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgia Regents University. All participants were informed of the objectives and possible risks of the technique before written consent for participation was obtained. Figure 1 illustrates a schematic summary of the essential elements that should be considered for the ultrasound assessment of brachial artery FMD.\n1. Subject Preparation (Prior to Arrival)\nConfirm that the participant has abstained from practicing exercise (≥12 hr), caffeine (≥12 hr), smoking or smoke exposure (≥12 hr), vitamin supplementation (>72 hr) and any medication (≥4 hr half-lives of the drug, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for 1 day and aspirins for 3 days).\nEnsure that the participant is under fasting conditions or has only consumed low-fat meals4 prior to testing.\nWhen testing premenopausal women, it is suggested to conduct the FMD protocol during the menses phase of the menstrual cycle to limit the impact of endogenous estrogens and progesterones8,32,33.\n2. Subject Preparation (Upon Arrival)\nPrior to measurement acquisition, verify that the subject is resting in a supine position in a quiet, temperature-controlled (22 °C to 24 °C) room for approximately 20 min to achieve a hemodynamic steady state.\nAttach a 3-lead ECG in the standard limb lead II position. Using American standard instrumentation, place the white/negative polarity lead just below the clavicle on the right shoulder. Connect the black/ dual polarity lead below the left clavicle near the shoulder and connect the red/positive polarity lead below the left pectoral muscle in the lateral base of the chest.",
    "Extend the subject's arm laterally at about 80° of shoulder abduction and secure the distal forearm in a vacuum packed pillow to maintain accurate position of the arm during the measurement (Figure 2).\nPlace the forearm cuff immediately distal to the medial epicondyle and ensure that nothing is touching the cuff, including the table below (Figure 2).\n3. Baseline Measurements\nMapping the Brachial Artery with the Ultrasound:\n\t\nWhile holding the probe with the hand, position it cross-sectionally and start scanning the inner side of the upper arm beginning at the insertion of the bicep and proceeding proximally.\nWithin B-mode (gray-scale), identify the brachial artery and collateral vessels and use color flow (CF) mode to help confirm the location of the artery. Interpret the color and pulsatility carefully considering the direction of the transducer to ensure assessment of the artery and not the vein.\n\t\tNOTE: With the probe indicator facing the head, red color means flow toward the transducer (arterial flow), while blue means flow away (venous flow).\nIdentification of Brachial Artery:\n\t\nAfter finding the brachial artery, rotate the probe 90° to scan the arm longitudinally. Obtain the image between 2 to 10 cm above the antecubital fossa.\nIdentify anatomical landmarks such as veins and fascial planes for multiple assessments in the same subject (Figure 3).\nSecuring the Probe:\n\t\nSecure the probe in the stereotactic probe holder. Confirm the probe is appropriately fixed to avoid excessive movements. With the probe secured in the holder, ensure that the image is as good as the image that was obtained manually without the holder.\nOptimizing the Resolution of the Image:\n\t\nOptimize the image using the time gain controls (TGC's) with the probe secured.",
    "NOTE: An optimal image is achieved when the clearest B-mode image from the anterior and posterior intimal interfaces between the lumen and vessel wall is obtained.\nHave the technician manually adjust the gain, focal points, dynamic range, and harmonics to get a clear and defined image of the near and far walls of the endothelium.\nDuplex Doppler Mode:\n\t\nFollowing B-mode acquisition, proceed to duplex scanning in the pulsed Doppler mode.\nUse a heel to toe approach with the probe inside the holder by rocking the transducer up on one end more than the other to adjust the brachial artery image and obtain an angle of insonation of 60°.\nBaseline Acquisition:\n\t\nObtain a satisfactory B-mode image that identifies the endothelial layers with clear intima-intima walls of the artery. Ensure that the Doppler signal appears sharp and clear sound with no muffles.\nReset the ultrasound CINE loop by freezing and unfreezing the image. Press F1 to begin recording data on image software. Record baseline data for at least 30 sec. Analyze the average diameter and blood velocity for 30 sec to represent baseline values. Note: Different ultrasounds and software set-ups may require different sequences to obtain the required action.\n4. Vascular Occlusion Measurements\nForearm Occlusion:\n\t\nRapidly inflate the forearm occlusion cuff, using compressed air, to supra-systolic pressures (250 mm Hg) for 5 min to induce arterial occlusion.\nAfter 4 min and 30 sec of forearm occlusion, begin acquiring data.\n\t\tNOTE: Occlusion measurements will be represented by the last 30 sec of occlusion.\n5. Reactive Hyperemia (Post Cuff Release) Measurements\nContinuing to Acquire Data from Pre-cuff Release:\n\t\nDeflate the cuff at 5 min.\nMaintain recording for two minutes following cuff release.",
    "Following 2 min of post cuff release recording, stop and save the recordings. The highest 5 sec averaged interval throughout the 2 min post-occlusion collection period will be used to represent the peak hyperemic diameter.\n6. Analysis of the Results: Edge Detection and Wall Tracking\nDue to the complexity of FMD analysis, use edge-detection and wall-tracking software throughout FMD testing for higher reproducibility according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: This offline analysis is less operator dependent than the manual assessment and therefore improves the accuracy of the FMD data4,34-36. In addition, this off-line analysis system also permits the synchronization with the ECG for the identification of end-diastolic arterial diameters, avoiding distortion of pulse-related changes in diameter4. It should be noted that, although the use of ECG is endorsed to minimize pulsation variability, it is also possible to perform the FMD protocol without ECG gaiting37. Although not recommended, if edge computer-assisted analysis is unavailable, careful manual assessment of both diameter and velocities should be collected36.\nFor the evaluation of vessel diameters, it is necessary to visually inspect each frame to determine the best placement of the ultrasonic calipers along the B-mode image38.\n\tNOTE: Regardless of data analysis method, it is recommended to collect diameter and velocity data every 4 sec during the first 20 sec of reactive hyperemia and every 5 sec for the remaining post occlusion period4.\nSubscription Required.
