    "Sample preparationPrepare liquid Chlamydomonas cultures and collect 1 ml sample when the cultures are in the exponential growth phase. Mix the sample with 19 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Use a Scepter cell counter to determine cell number and cell volume by following the instructions displayed on the screen. Briefly, depress the plunger, submerge the tip, and release the plunger to soak up 50 μl liquid culture into the tip. The Scepter cell counter detects each cell passing through the orifice of the tip, calculates cell density, and displays a histogram of cell diameter or volume on the screen (Johnston, 2010). Based on the calculated cell density, harvest 2 x 106 cells, place it in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge it at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature.Gently re-suspend the pelleted cells in 1 ml Milli-Q water and repeat the centrifugation step.Discard the supernatant and freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen. The samples can be stored at -80 °C for several months.Add 200 µl of extraction buffer to the frozen pellet and mix it by vigorous shaking. The extraction buffer contains TCEP to keep Asc in the reduced form.Transfer the resuspended cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µl glass beads and vortex at maximum speed for 30 sec. Incubate the sample at room temperature for two minutes (during which the sample becomes brownish), then place it on ice. Centrifuge the sample at 19,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.Collect 120 µl of the supernatant (without stirring up the pellet) and filter it into chromatographic vials using 4 mm hydrophilic PTFE syringe filters with a pore size of 0.22 µm.",
    "The samples are stable for 24 h at 4 °C and can be stored at -80 °C for several months; however, freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.Determination of Asc concentration by HPLC (see Nováková et al., 2008a for theoretical basics)Ascorbate can be efficiently separated chromatographically using a Synergy hydro 4u Hydro – RP 80 Å 250 x 4.6 mm column. Attach the column fitted with a suitable guard column (AQ C18 4.0 x 3.0 mm) to the HPLC. Equilibrate the column with mobile phase A for at least 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Set the tray temperature of the autosampler at 4 °C and the column oven temperature at 20 °C. While waiting for the temperature and baseline to stabilize, prepare the sample sequence table. Insert the chromatographic vials containing the samples into the tray of the autosampler.Inject 20 µl sample. For the elution of Asc, use an isocratic mobile phase of 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 2.5, adjusted with orthophosphoric acid) for 5 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min then apply a short acetonitrile (mobile phase B) gradient from 0% to 30% between 3.5 and 6 min to elute the less polar components from the column. Between 8 and 9 min decrease the percentage of mobile phase B to 0% and equilibrate the column to the mobile phase A for an additional 9 min. The total running time is 18 min.Record the signal between 190 and 500 nm at a sampling frequency of 4 Hz and 1,024 spectral resolution with a slit set to 8 nm. The Asc peak appears at approximately 5.1 min with an absorption maximum at around 244 nm."
