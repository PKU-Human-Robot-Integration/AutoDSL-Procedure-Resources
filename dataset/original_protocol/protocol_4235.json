    "Cell growthGrow S. meliloti on YMB plate for 48 h at 30 °C. The optimal temperature for S. meliloti growth is between 28 °C and 30 °C. Inoculate S. meliloti from the stock YMB plate to an OD600 of ~0.1 in 3 ml MMNH4 medium. Grow cells for 48 h at 30 °C, 250 rpm in 14 ml Falcon or glass tubes completely wrapped with foil to prevent light-induced flavin degradation. In case of testing flavin levels in light-grown culture or flavin degradation by light, the foil could be omitted. Dilute the cells 20-fold into 3 ml fresh MMNH4 medium and grow for 1 or 3 days at 30 °C, 250 rpm in 14 ml Falcon or glass tubes covered with aluminum foil. The length of cell growth could vary from several hours to 10+ days depending on the specific question of the research. Remove 1 ml of the growing culture for protein quantification.  These 1 ml samples can be frozen at -20 °C for later protein quantification. (The rest 2 ml of cell cultures will be used for flavin detection, steps B, C and D.) For protein assay, break the cells by sonication (Fisher Sonic Dismembrator 300 with the intermediate size attachment and a power setting of 60 %, three times for 3 min each at 4  °C). Remove cells debris by centrifugation (≥ 3,000 x g; room temperature; 20 min).Measure protein concentration in the cultures by using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. Note: Carry out the rest of the procedure for flavin extraction and analysis under as limited lighting as possible since flavins are extremely light sensitive. Protect extracted and filtered flavins from light by storing in a light-tight container. For long-term storage, samples can be stored below 0 °C in a light-tight container.",
    "Separation of cells from conditioned mediaHarvest cells from 1 ml culture by centrifugation (≥ 10,000 x g; room temperature; 20 min) in pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes.  Transfer the supernatant to clean Eppendorf tubes. It will be used in step C and can be stored at -20 °C in foil wrapped Eppendorf tubes for later analysis.Wash the pellets with 1 ml MMNH4 buffer and centrifuge (≥ 10,000 x g; room temperature; 20 min). Pipet out all liquid and re-weigh the tube to measure the pellet mass. The pellet mass is expected to be at the range between 5 mg and 10 mg depending on the time of growth.The pellet will be used in step D can be stored at -20 °C in foil wrapped Eppendorf tubes for later analysis. To measure secreted flavinsFilter the supernatant left after harvesting the bacteria (step B) using Microsolv 0.22 µm syringe filters.For riboflavin, FMN, and FAD detection, separate the samples by reverse-phase chromatography using a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system with a Waters SunFire C18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 3.5 µm) maintained at 35 °C linked to a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector. Detect riboflavin, FMN, and FAD by using an excitation wavelength of 470 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Run mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 12 min per sample. Maintain the samples at 10 °C. For lumichrome detection, use excitation and emission wavelengths of 260 nm and 470 nm respectively. Use the mobile phase gradient program indicated in Table 1. The column and flow rate are the same as indicated above. Run mobile phase for 15 min. Column temperature 35 °C.Determine the flavin concentration by comparison to standards (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 µM FAD, FMN and riboflavin).",
