    "1. Imaging System\nThe technical details of OFDI have been described previously4-6. Circumferential OFDI was conducted at imaging speeds between 25 and 100 frames per second and between 512 and 2,048 axial depth profiles per circular cross-sectional image. Custom 2.4 Fr (0.8 mm diameter) helical scanning catheters used in this study were designed to operate through the access port of standard bronchoscopes. The catheters consisted of an inner optical core to focus the light onto the bronchial wall and a single-use outer sheath. The catheter body remained stationary during imaging while the inner core was rotated at a rate between 25 and 100 Hz and translated at a pullback speed of between 1.25 and 5 mm/sec. The axial resolution of the system was 6 mm in tissue and provided an image ranging depth of 7.3 mm4-6. Catheter-based OFDI was performed in this study to replicate in vivo bronchoscopic OFDI (Figure 1). However, this protocol may also be applied to imaging with a bench-top optical system (Figure 3 and 4).\n2. Imaging System Set-up\nTurn on imaging system\nSet and record imaging parameters (rotational speed, pullback speed, image acquisition rate, etc). For the OFDI imaging system used in this study, images were obtained at 10-50 fps.\nAttach catheter to rotary junction and pullback device.\nSpin catheter and check for image quality. Adjust system alignment and offset as needed.\n3. Tissue Preparation\nPlace a tabletop disposable absorbent pad on the benchtop and set lung specimen on pad.\nIf imaging a surgical ex vivo specimen from a patient, be sure to consult the pathology department to ensure that all resection margins (bronchial, vascular, and parenchymal margins) have been assessed, documented, and/or removed by a pathologist.",
    "Identify the bronchial airway entering the resection specimen at the hilum. Remove any visible mucus within the airway using a syringe bore. If necessary, attach a longer segment of plastic tubing to the syringe bore to suction deeper within the airway.\nPalpate the exterior surface of the specimen to identify the lesion of interest.\nUsing a fine metal probe, gingerly navigate through the bronchial tree until near the lesion of interest.\nOpen the airway along the probe until the lesion of interest is visible or palpable under the airway mucosa.\nCarefully remove any blood or mucus from the airway mucosa overlying the lesion with a cotton-tipped applicator.\nPlace the OFDI catheter above the airway mucosa and obtain an image to confirm the lesion is underlying the airway mucosa and to identify a high-quality imaging region of interest for histology correlation.\n4. Tissue Marking\nSelect the region of interest in the airway based on previous imaging findings in Step 3.8.\nChoose two points on the tissue along the desired line of imaging. Points may be parallel to either the longitudinal (Figure 2) or circumferential (Figure 3) aspect of the airway, depending on desired results. Space dots no more than 1.5 cm apart so that the portion of tissue may fit in one histology block for processing. If a tissue length of > 1.5 cm is required, then split the tissue length into multiple 1.5 cm long inked regions of interest to create multiple matched imaging:histology pairs.\nDip a fine tipped open bore needle (i.e. 25 gauge 7/8\" long) into the tissue marking dye (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC).\nCarefully wipe excess ink off the outside of the needle with gauze, leaving tissue marking ink only within the needle bore.",
    "Puncture the tissue perpendicular to the airway mucosa at the chosen point along the line of imaging.\nRepeat steps 3.3 to 3.5 for the second point on the airway mucosa.\nIf the ink runs over the mucosal surface away from the puncture site, use a cotton tipped applicator to carefully remove the excess ink.\nRemove mucus or blood on the surface of the airway mucosa with a cotton tipped applicator, if present.\nIf the ink dots are placed circumferentially within an airway, it is useful to pin open the two sides of the airway to flatten the tissue in the imaging field (Figure 3a).\n5. Imaging Tissue\nPlace the OFDI catheter over each ink mark and image to ensure the marks are visible on OFDI. Marks should appear as focal disruptions within the tissue structure with overlying highly scattering particles and underlying rapid signal attenuation, which corresponds to the ink particles within the puncture site (Figure 3b, Figure 4a, Figure 4g).\nIf ink mark(s) are not visible on OFDI, repeat steps 4.3 to 4.7 for the non-visible marks. If ink marks are visible with OFDI, proceed to step 5.3.\nPlace the catheter parallel to the two ink marks on the airway mucosal surface such that the catheter optics overlie the tissue beyond the first ink mark (Figure 2b). Anchoring the proximal end of the catheter with a lightweight object and securing the distal end can help reduce motion artifacts.\nProceed with collecting an OFDI pullback.\nView the OFDI pullback images to ensure both ink marks are visible in imaging and to check for motion artifacts (Figure 3 and Figure 4). If the marks are not visible, repeat steps 5.1 to 5.4.\n6. Collecting and Processing Tissue",
    "Place a green ink dot (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) on the airway mucosal tissue to orient the beginning of the imaging scan, 0.3 cm away from the ink mark that appeared first in the imaging pullback (Figure 2c).\nRemove tissue encompassing the two black ink marks and green ink mark. Trim tissue to fit into a standard histology processing cassette. If cutting fresh tissue is difficult, then the tissue may be fixed prior to removing the tissue for histology.\nPlace tissue in a histology processing cassette and fix in 10% formalin for at least 48 hr.\nProcess tissue in a tissue processor, available through any histology department.\nEmbed tissue in paraffin such that the cut sections will be parallel to the two black ink marks on the airway surface.\nUse a tissue microtome to face the paraffin block until either an ink mark is visible or the entire tissue section is visible, whichever comes first.\nOnce both black ink marks are visible, cut one 5 μm thick section and mount onto a glass slide.\nContinue to cut and mount 5 μm thick sections every 50 μm until the black ink marks are no longer visible or the tissue ends, whichever comes first.\nFollow standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining protocols to stain and coverslip slides.\n7. Image Processing",
    "If images were acquired with a benchtop scanner, or other scanning technique where both ink marks were visible in a single cross-sectional image, then the image can be directly correlated with corresponding histology. If volumetric datasets were acquired with a helical scanning catheter, the images will need to be re-interpolated so that a single 2D image bisects both ink marks for correlation with histology. This can be accomplished using ImageJ or other image processing software. In some instances, the ink may not be readily visible in which case adjacent sections/slides should be examined."
