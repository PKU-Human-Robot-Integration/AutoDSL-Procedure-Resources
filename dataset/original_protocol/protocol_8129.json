    "Brain MR images were acquired as per the protocol approved by the local institutional review board and ethics committee.\nNOTE: The tools for shape modeling and analysis can be downloaded from the NITRC repository: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dtmframework/[href=https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dtmframework/]. The GUI software (DTMModeling.exe) can be executed after extraction. See Figure 1.\n1. Brain MR Image Segmentation\nAcquire brain MR images of individual subjects and brain segmentation masks.\nNOTE: Usually, we acquire T1-weighted MR images for analyses of brain structures. We assume that the MR images are pre-processed for gradient non-linearity correction and intensity inhomogeneity correction using N311, improved N3 methods12, or FSL-FAST13. Some freely available tools for automatic segmentation of human brain structures are listed in Table 1.\nCorrect the segmentation results manually.\nNOTE: Open GUI software supporting manual segmentation are listed in Table 2. Manual segmentation protocols for the brain structures can be found here14,15,16. A video guide on manual segmentation for hippocampus is here17. We describe the protocol for hippocampal segmentation in the next section.\n\t\nOpen the T1-weighted MRI and the automatic segmentation results using the Open File menu.\nLoad the Segmentation plugin by clicking Window Menu | Show | Segmentation.\nCorrect the segmentation mask using the Add, Subtract, and Correction tools in the Segmentation plugin.\nSave the corrected segmentation mask in Nifti format using the Save menu.\n2. Manual Editing of Hippocampal Segmentation\nNOTE: We introduce a protocol for manually editing of brain segmentation using the GUI modeling software based on the MITK workbench (http://www.mitk.org/[href=http://www.mitk.org/]). The MITK workbench provides various functions for the manual and automatic segmentation and medical image visualization. We demonstrate the manual editing process for the left and right hippocampi. Steps for manually editing18 the result of the automatic hippocampal segmentation are as follows.",
    "Open the T1-weighted MR image and the results of the automatic hippocampal segmentation using the MITK workbench software.\nLoad the Segmentation plugin in the MITK workbench by clicking on the menu Window | Show View | Segmentation.\nSelect the coronal view by clicking the right-hand side icon that appears in the top right-hand side corner of the Display window.\nEdit the binary mask of each hippocampus (i.e., left and right) in the coronal view, starting from the hippocampal head to the body as follows.\n\t\nScroll throughout the volume until the uncus is found. Include the uncus in the hippocampal mask where it is present.\nEdit the mask of the hippocampal body after the uncus has receded using the Add and Subtract function in the Segmentation plugin.\nContinue editing the hippocampal mask until the hippocampal tail is found. As the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus recedes superior to the hippocampus, the fornix emerges.\nFinish editing the last coronal slice of the hippocampus in which the entire length of the fornix is visible but not yet continuous with the splenium of the corpus callosum.\nNOTE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces can be contained within the hippocampal regions. The CSF spaces can be removed from the hippocampal masks using the Subtract tool in the segmentation plugin of the MITK workbench. it may be easier to define the hippocampal regions entirely and then go through all coronal slices from the hippocampal head to tail for the removal of CSF spaces.\nFollow the same process for editing the binary masks of both hippocampi.",
    "NOTE: The Add, Subtract, and Correction tools of the Segmentation plugin in the MITK workbench can be used for the manual editing. The Correction tool is easy to handle small errors in the segmentation mask by performing addition and subtraction according to user input and the segmentation mask without additional tool selection.\nSave the binary masks for left and right hippocampi in Nifti format (nii or nii.gz) using the Save menu in the MITK workbench software.\nNOTE: The binary masks of left and right hippocampi should be saved separately for the subsequent hippocampal shape model steps.\n3. Group Template Construction\nNOTE: After the segmentation and manual editing for all subjects, the individual shape modeling requires the template model of the target structure. We construct the template model from the average binary mask for a population, acquired using \"ShapeModeling\" plugin in the MITK Workbench. Steps of the template model construction using GUI software are as follows.\nLoad the ShapeModeling plugin using the menu function: Window | Show View | Shape Modeling.\nOpen a directory containing the binary masks of a study population by clicking the Open Directory button in the ShapeModeling plugin.\nClick the Template Construction button in the ShapeModeling plugin.\nCheck the mean shape mesh and save it in stereolithography (STL) format using the Save menu.\n4. Individual Shape Reconstruction\nNOTE: At this step, we perform the shape modeling for individual subjects using Start Shape Modeling button in the \"ShapeModeling\" plugin. We list the software parameters of this plugin in Table 3. Detailed explanation on each parameter can be found here5. Steps of the individual shape reconstruction using GUI software are as follows.\nLoad T1-weighted MR image and its segmentation mask using the Open File menu.\nNOTE: We use the T1-weighted MR image for visual validation.",
    "Check the modeling parameters in ShapeModeling plugin and modify if necessary.\nNOTE: If the template model is not deformed or the distance between the template model and the image boundary is large, it is recommended to increase the boundary search range. If some geometric distortions are found, increasing maxAlpha and minAlpha with step 0.5 would help to resolve the issue. It is important to check the voxel intensity for the target object in the segmentation mask. If the value is not 1, intensity parameter should be changed accordingly.\nClick the Shape Modeling button to run the shape modeling process and check the result in the 3D view of MITK workbench.\nRepeat steps 4.2 and 4.3, when the template model is not fitted to the image boundary closely.\nNOTE: The template model is visualized with the segmentation mask in the sagittal, coronal, axial, and 3D view of the MITK workbench. The template surface is not deformed when the distance between the template model and the image boundary is less than a threshold which is one tenth of the smallest voxel size.\nSave the modeling result in a stereolithography (STL) format using the Save menu in MITK framework.\n5. Group-wise Shape Normalization and Shape Difference Measurement\nNOTE: At this step, we align the individual shape models to the template model and compute the point-wise shape deformity between the corresponding vertices between the template model and the individual shape model. Steps for the shape deformity measurement are as follows.\nSelect the shape model of a subject in the Data Manager of the MITK workbench.\nNOTE: Users can select multiple models for the deformity measurement.\nPerform the deformity measurement by clicking the Measurement button in the ShapeModeling plugin.\nSubscription Required.
