    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of serum from mouse blood\nTiming: 2 h 30 min\nThis step describes the separation of serum from 24 mice to acquire enough material for the isolation of bacterial membrane vesicles from blood. A starting volume of ∼11 mL full blood from 24 mice yields ∼5 mL of serum. This is performed on the bench top or in a biosafety cabinet, depending on the biosafety level of the samples.\nTo collect blood from mice, mice are euthanatized by cervical dislocation.\nFor this, with one hand, grasp the mouse directly behind the ears and apply pressure on the neck.\nWith the other hand, hold the base of the tail.\nTo dislocate the spinal column from the skull, keep the head of the mouse stationary, then with a firm steady motion lift the tail slightly and pull.\nBy using your fingertips, palpate the neck region to be sure that the spinal column is dislocated from the head.\nOpening of the thoracic cavity to take blood from the heart.\nPlace the mouse on its’ back.\nUse a paper towel soaked in 70% ethanol to quickly disinfect the front of the mouse from the neck to the belly region.\nThen grasp a small flap of skin at the end of the sternum.\nWith sharp, sterile scissors, cut a hole in the skin and musculature at the diaphragm.\nNext, insert one blade of scissors into the opening at the position of the sternum.\nTo open the thoracic cavity, cut through the rib cage and bend the ribs to the side to expose the heart.",
    "With a sterile filter tip (pipette tips large opening 100–1000 μL, with filter, sterile, Carl Roth, #CHC6.1) attached to a micropipette, puncture and insert into the atrium of the heart, and carefully draw blood from the heart while avoiding clogging the pipet tip. In case of pre-mature clotting, collect the clots alongside with the blood.\nTransfer the collected blood into a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube at room temperature (RT; 20°C).\nSerum separation from full blood.\nMix the blood collected in step 2.h by inverting the tube 5-times and then incubate the collected blood at RT for 30 min.\nSeparate the serum from blood cells/clot by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g and 4°C for 10 min.\nCarefully transfer the upper phase, the serum, to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube by avoiding touching the blood clot.\nTo clear the serum further, centrifuge the serum again at 1,500 ×g and 4°C for 10 min and transfer the upper phase to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge.\nStore the serum on ice until further processing.\nCritical: Try to prevent any contamination of the serum with traces of blood cells/clots. Aim at avoiding erythrocyte lysis during the serum preparation by gentle pipetting using pipette tips with a large opening. Contaminations of that kind might interfere with subsequent steps.\nCollection of mouse colon luminal content for BMV isolation\nTiming: 2 h 30 min\nThis step describes how to harvest colon luminal content for the isolation of bacterial membrane vesicles. For enough material, 8 mice per sample (16 mice for 2 samples) are required. This procedure can be performed alongside the ’collection of serum from mouse blood[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]’ described in steps 1–3 above.\nEuthanatize mice by cervical dislocation as described in step 1.\nOpen the peritoneal cavity to sample the colon and its luminal content as follows.",
    "Place the mouse on its’ back.\nUse a paper towel soaked in 70% ethanol to quickly disinfect the front of the mouse from the sternum to the anus.\nThen grasp a small flap of skin and make a ventral incision between sternum and anus using sharp, sterile scissors to cut a hole in the skin.\nRemove the pelt by tearing the skin in the transverse plane.\nOpen the peritoneal cavity by carefully cutting the peritoneal membrane.\nNote: Be careful not to cut any inner organs.\nGrasp the pyloric sphincter and put the stomach together with the small intestine aside until reaching the cecum.\nCut below the cecum. Then grasp the proximal colon and cut the rectum.\nPlace the colon into a sterile Petri dish.\nBy applying gentle pressure on the colon, carefully guide the luminal content to the end of the colon until it leaves the luminal cavity.\nCollect the colon luminal content with a sterile spatula (Merck, Corning single use spatula/spoon, flat end, #CLS3007) into a 50 mL reaction tube in ice-cold 10 mL DPBS.\nStore samples on ice until further processing.\nPre-clearing of BMV-containing supernatants from colon luminal content.\nVortex the colon content for 30 s at ∼1500 rpm (speed position 6; Test tube shakers Genie Vortex Mixer Model: Vortex-Genie 2, Carl Roth, Scientific Industries, #P505.1).\nPellet colon luminal content at 4,000 ×g, 4°C for 5 min, and transfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL reaction tube.\nCentrifuge supernatant at 4,000 ×g, 4°C for 10 min and transfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL reaction tube.\nRepeat step c by spinning the supernatant at 4,000 ×g, 4°C for 10 min and transferring it to a new 15 mL reaction tube.",
    "Finally, spin the supernatant at 6,000 ×g, 4°C for 10 min, then transfer it to a new 15 mL reaction tube.\nTo remove further contaminants, filter the supernatant using a 0.45 μm syringe filter into a new 15 mL reaction tube.\nTo eliminate any remaining bacteria, filter the supernatant using a 0.2 μm syringe filter into a new 15 mL reaction tube. This should yield a total colon fluid volume of ∼4 mL.\nHold the colon content fluid on ice, while equilibrating filter devices (see step below).\nConcentration of serum and colon fluid samples\nTiming: 3 h 30 min\nThis step describes the concentration of the collected mouse serum and colon fluid. This is necessary because separation columns for BMV isolation can hold a maximum of 500 μL of sample volume.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2371-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the assembly and loading of an Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter device\n(1) Seal the filter device with the filtrate collection tube.\n(2) Load the sample into the filter device.\n(3) Add the concentrate collection tube on top of the filter device and push down to seal.\n(4) Insert the sealed filter device into the centrifuge rotor until the rim of the concentrate collection tube is inside the centrifuge rotor well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2371-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematics for the collection of concentrated serum and colon fluid from an Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter device\n(1) Remove the whole filter device from the rotor.\n(2) Disconnect the filter device from the filtrate collection tube.\n(3) Invert the filter device with sealed concentrate collection tube.",
    "(4) Insert the inverted filter device with sealed concentrate collection tube into the centrifuge rotor and spin. Take the filter device with sealed concentrate collection tube out of the rotor and disconnect the concentrate collection tube containing the concentrated serum or colon fluid from the filter device.\nTo concentrate the collected serum and colon fluid to a final volume of 500 μL, use Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter devices for volumes up to 2 mL with a cutoff of 3 kDa (Amicon Ultra 3K device – 3,000 NMW).\nEquilibrate each Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter device with 500 μL ice-cold, sterile filtered DPBS to remove any traces of other buffers/chemicals contained in the filter devices used to preserve the resin.\nNote: The number of filter devices required depends on the volume and the viscosity of the sample.\nEquilibration of Amicon filters is performed as follows:\nPlace the Amicon Ultra-2 filtrate devices into the filtrate collection tubes. Confirm that the filtrate devices are properly sealed in the collection tubes.\nLoad each filtrate device with 500 μL ice-cold, sterile filtered DPBS.\nCover the filtrate devices with the concentrate collection tubes by pushing the collection tubes onto the filtrate devices.\nNote: Be careful not to break the collection tubes. Appropriate sealing of all three device parts is required to prevent breaking of the device during centrifugation (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for schematic instructions how to seal the device parts).\nPlace the filter devices into the centrifuge with swinging buckets. Make sure the filter devices are in contact with the bottom of the rotor and that the rims of the concentrate collection tubes are inside the centrifuge rotor well. Counterbalance with similar devices if required.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 ×g and 4°C for 60 min.",
    "Note: The maximum speed when using a swinging bucket rotor is 4,000 ×g. If using a fixed angle rotor do not exceed 5,400 ×g when centrifuging viscous solutions such as serum to avoid breaking of filters.\nRemove the filter devices from the centrifuge. Then disconnect the filter devices from the filtrate collection tubes containing the flow-through.\nDiscard the flow-through in the collection devices, then seal the filter devices again in the collection tubes.\nUse DPBS-equilibrated Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter devices to load the serum and the colon fluid for subsequent concentration. Perform this as follows:\nRemove the concentrate collection tube from the filter device.\nLoad filtrate devices each with 1.5 mL ice-cold serum collected in steps 1–3 (Preparation of serum from mouse blood) or with 1.5 mL ice-cold colon fluid collected in steps 4–6 (Collection of colon luminal content for BMV- isolation).\nNote: A volume of 500 μL is the maximum volume that can be loaded on each qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 column for the isolation of BMVs. Use as many filtrate devices as required to concentrate each sample (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCover the filtrate devices with the concentrate collection tubes by pushing the collection tubes onto the filtrate devices.\nPlace the filter devices into the centrifuge rotor as described above.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 ×g and 4°C for 60 min.\nRemove the filter devices from the centrifuge.\nDisconnect the filter devices from the filtrate collection tubes.\nThen invert the filter devices tied to the concentrate collection tubes. To recover the concentrated serum and colon fluid, place the inverted filter devices in the centrifuge rotor and counterbalance with similar devices if required.",
    "Immediately centrifuge at 1,000 ×g and 4°C for 2 min. This results in the transfer of the concentrated serum or colon fluid from the devices to the concentrate collection tubes.\nRemove the concentrate collection tubes from the devices (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTransfer the concentrated samples from each filter device into a 1.5 mL low protein binding collection tube. Hold the concentrated samples on ice.\nIsolation of bacterial membrane vesicles by size-exclusion chromatography\nTiming: 2 h 30 min\nMembrane vesicles (MVs) are small vesicles released by eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Bacterial membrane vesicles have diameters of 20–250 nm. Exosomes, membrane vesicles of eukaryotic origin, have a size range of 30–100 nm.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] On the other hand, most microvesicles mainly derived from outward budding of the plasma membrane range in sizes from 100 to 500 nm.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nThis step describes the isolation of MVs from pre-concentrated serum and colon fluid using size-exclusion chromatography. The qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 columns were originally designed for the isolation of exosomes with a size range of 70 nm–1000 nm.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] However, because BMVs co-elute with exosomes, these columns can also permit the isolation of bacterial membrane vesicles (BMVs) from different biological samples.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nA sample volume of 500 μL is optimal for the dimension and resin volume of these columns. The qEVoriginal columns allow MVs to be separated from proteins in biological fluid because of their propensity to elute at different times in different fractions. Each fraction is defined as 0.5 mL eluate. While fractions 1–6 are considered as void volume, MVs elute in fraction 7–9, followed by the majority of proteins (>99%) in fraction 10–12.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2371-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic illustration of vesicle isolation from serum and colon fluid using a qEVoriginal column using a stand",
    "To prepare qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 columns, the following steps need to be performed.\nNote: During BMVs isolation, a clean, sterile environment with as little as possible nucleic acid contamination is required. Include a PBS-only sample to control for any possible contamination during MV isolation via size-exclusion chromatography.\nLet the qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 columns and the sterile filtered DPBS reach working temperature. The operational temperature ranges from 18°C–24°C. Here, we operate at 20°C (RT).\nAssemble the column stand provided by IZON (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nInsert qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 columns into the stand.\nInsert 15 mL reaction tubes into the holder below the columns.\nEquilibrate each column with at least 40 mL of sterile-filtered DPBS as follows:\nOpen the upper cap of a column and add 2 mL sterile-filtered DPBS to the filter on top of the column resin (top-filter).\nRemove the luer slip cap and collect the flow-through in the 15 mL reaction tube below the column.\nConstantly add DPBS on the columns, but not more than 2 mL at a time until each column is equilibrated with at least 40 mL DPBS. Whenever required, empty the 15 mL reaction tube for collecting the flow-through.\nWhen a column is equilibrated, add the luer slip cap to close the column from the bottom to avoid loss of buffer volume.\nNote: Do not let the top-filter of the column run dry. It should be covered with DPBS.\nClose the upper cap of the column if the column is not immediately used.\nTo load the equilibrated qEVoriginal / 70 nm Gen 2 column with the concentrated serum or colon fluid proceed as follows.\nOpen the upper cap of a column.",
    "Remove the remaining buffer above the top-filter while leaving the luer slip cap on the qEVoriginal column.\nImmediately load 500 μL of concentrated serum or colon fluid onto the center of a filter.\nRemove the luer slip cap and instantly start collecting 0.5 mL fractions in 1.5 mL low protein binding collection tubes.\nNote: The first 6 fractions contain the void volume but no membrane vesicles. Therefore, it is recommended to collect the void volume in two 1.5 mL collection tubes to save time and avoid measurement errors of 6 individual tubes.\nAdd DPBS on the top-filter of the column as the last of the sample just levels the filter.\nNote: Prevent any unintentional dilution of the serum or colon fluid sample by adding DPBS before the sample enters the top-filter. Do not let the filter run dry and do not add more than 2 mL DPBS on the top-filter.\nCollect fraction 7 to 9 separately containing the highest amount of MVs. Store at 4°C.\nCollect further fractions (up to 12) that are supposed to contain higher protein content and low membrane vesicles (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nAfter collecting the vesicle fractions, wash the column with at least 20–30 mL DPBS and store at 4°C. The top-filter should be covered with DPBS before closing the upper cap and the luer slip cap.\nOptional: Columns can be reused up to 5 times. For this, the flow rate should be tightly observed. Reduced flow rate indicates that the column was not successfully recovered for reuse.\nOptional: Measure each fraction for membrane vesicle concentration using an Izon qNano and protein purity. The protein concentration of fractions can be determined by usage of Pierce BCA protein assay kit.\nConcentration of membrane vesicle fractions\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This step describes the volume reduction of collected fractions containing membrane vesicles. This step was performed to increase the concentration of bacterial membrane vesicles. In our original study, we conducted 16S rDNA sequencing of amplified vesicle isolated DNA to assess the presence of gut bacteria-derived membrane vesicles in colon lumen or in blood. For this, we pooled and concentrated the MV-containing fractions to increase the bacterial DNA yield from membrane vesicles.\nTo concentrate the collected MV fractions to a final volume of 200 μL, use Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter devices for volumes up to 2 mL with a cutoff of 3 kDa (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nEquilibrate three Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter devices as described in step 7a. In brief, perform the following steps:\nNote: An additional filter device should be used to concentrate the PBS-only sample that serves as negative control.\nPlace the Amicon Ultra-2 filtrate devices into the filtrate collection tubes.\nLoad the filtrate devices with 500 μL ice-cold, sterile filtered DPBS and cover with the concentrate collection tubes.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 ×g and 4°C for 60 min.\nDiscard the flow-through in the collection tubes, then seal the filter devices again in the collection tubes.\nConcentrate the MV fractions using the equilibrated Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal filter devices as described in step 7c. In brief, perform the following steps:\nPool MV fractions 6–9 from each individual sample in a 1.5 mL low protein binding collection tube and invert the tube 3-times. The volume of each MV-containing sample yields ∼1.5 mL.\nLoad each filtrate device with 1.5 mL MV-containing sample and cover with a concentrate collection tube.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 ×g and 4°C for 40 min.\nRemove the filter devices from the centrifuge.\nDisconnect the filter devices from the filtrate collection tubes.",
    "Invert the filter devices tied to the concentrate collection tubes. Insert the inverted filter devices in the centrifuge rotor, counterbalance if required, and immediately centrifuge at 1,000 ×g and 4°C for 2 min.\nRemove the concentrate collection tubes from the devices. Collect the concentrated serum and colon MV-containing samples with a volume of 200 μL from the concentrate collection tubes in sterile low protein binding collection tubes, then store samples at 4°C or long-term at −20°C.\nOptional: To deplete extravesicular nucleic acids from MV preparations, supplement the MV concentrate with 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2. Then, incubate sample with 25 U/mL benzonase (Novagen) for 30 min at 37°C. Finally, add 1 mM EDTA, and heat sample at 95°C for 5 min to inhibit benzonase activity.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This step is required, if aimed at 16S rDNA profiling of vesicle-encased DNA.\nOptional: Different downstream application can be performed including isolation of MV-encased DNA followed by 16S rDNA sequencing, proteomic analyses, or electron microscopy."
