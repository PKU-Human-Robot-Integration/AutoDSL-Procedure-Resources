    "All animal experiments were authorized by the responsible Landesministerium für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV NRW; 87-51.05.2010.A301) in accordance with National and European legislation.\n1. In utero Electroporation\nThis method has been described in detail in JoVE for the rat by Walantus et al.3, as well as Rice et al.4 and is here summarized only briefly. A litter size of 6-8 pups yields a good outcome. There should be at least two non-electroporated embryos in order to increase the overall survival rate (see below).\nPrepare DNA-Mixture that contains 1.5 μg/μl of target-Plasmid (shRNA: pENTR-U6; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR / DISC1 overexpression: pCAX21), 0.5 μg/μl Luciferase containing Plasmid (pCAX), 0.5 μg/μl GFP containing plasmid (pCAGGS22) in 1x PBS solution stained light blue with Fast Green Dye.\nPrepare injection needles out of glass capillaries with a Needle Pipette Puller. And sterilize surgical instruments either by autoclaving or incubation with an alcohol-based disinfectant (kodan Tinktur forte).\nAdminister a pre-operative dose of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) 15 min before surgery to a pregnant rat 16 days after fertilization (E16). Then anesthetize the animal in an isoflurane chamber.\n\t\nUpon anesthesia, place the rat in a supine position on a 37 °C-warmed operation table with breathing mask connected to the anesthesia device, using oxygen setting at 0.4 L/min and isoflurane at 1.8%.\nAfter shaving the abdomen, disinfect the shaved area three times with kodan Tinktur Forte (an alcohol-based disinfectant).\nCover the rat with sterile cloths, exposing only the shaved operation field.\nPerform in utero electroporation.\n\t\nCut the abdomen with a scissor along the linea alba (~2 cm).\nExpose the uterine horns carefully with a ring forceps.\nTake care to keep the uterus wall wet with warmed sterile PBS during the whole surgery.",
    "Inject DNA solution with a thin glass needle into one of the lateral ventricle of the embryos.\nPlace the 7 mm electrode around the head of the embryo. To hit a cell population of upper cortical layers, perform the IUE at E1623 and position the positive electrode on the hemisphere above the injected ventricle with a slight dorsal/lateral tendency. To target hippocampal cells change the positive electrode placement to the opposite side than the injected ventricle with lateral to slightly dorsal direction (Figure 1).\nPerform electroporation by five 50 msec pulses at 55 V with 950 msec breaks with a square wave pulse electroporator.\nSpare the first embryo at the vaginal end of each uterus horn in order to increase the chances of survival of all embryos.\nPut the uterus horns back into the mother rat.\nStich the abdominal wall up with an absorbable Vicryl surgical suture material.\nClose the skin with the Vicryl suture material or with suture clips.\nPlace the mother rat back into the home cage and keep it warm for 2-3 hr.\nHold the rats alone in their home cage in the animal facility room and feed ad libitum. They give birth between E22-24.\nKeep the rat pups with their mother for three weeks and separate them afterwards by gender.\n2. Bioluminescence Live Imaging of the Enzymatic Luciferase Reaction\nThis method is used to analyze the position of the in utero transfected cells. Co-electroporated firefly luciferase cDNA is translated into active luciferase, which upon metabolizing D-luciferin to oxyluciferin, emits a photon (Figure 2). The resulting luminescence can be detected in the brains of positive electroporated young rats in an IVIS Spectrum up to the age of around 35 days postnatally (Figure 4).",
    "In the present study, the luciferase assay and bioluminescence imaging was performed starting at P7. This time point was chosen to allow mother and pups to recover from birth stress. When initially working with the pups at P0, pup survival was severely affected in that the pups were found dead or eaten by the mother.\nInitially, rat pups with successful electroporation are identified by a 2D-bioluminescence picture with an exposure time of three minutes. Subsequently, positive pups are used for creating 3D images in order to specify the location of the electroporated area.\nDilute D-luciferin sodium salt in PBS to a concentration of 15 mg/ml and sterilize it by filtration through a sterile syringe filter.\nWeigh the pups.\nTake the pup in one hand with the abdomen on top and stretch the abdomen slightly. Inject 10 μl/g of body weight of luciferin solution intraperitoneal. For older and more agile ones, pre-anaesthetize the pups with isoflurane in the induction chamber before injecting the luciferin.\nTurn on the isoflurane influx of the XGI-8 Gas Anesthesia System within the IVIS Spectrum with 3% isoflurane.\nPut the snout of the animal into the glass nose cones of the Anesthesia System.\nHold the animal in a prone position until it is in deep anesthesia (2-3 min). Then reduce the isoflurane influx to 1.5%.\nChoose a 2D-bioluminescence measurement to select positive pups from the whole litter. Use the following settings\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen1.jpg\nClick here to view larger figure[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen1large.jpg].\n\t\nSet a checkmark on Photograph with medium binning and F/Stop at 8, the camera takes a photo from above after starting the measurement.\nSet Excitation filter: block.\nSet Emission filter: open.\nSet Binning to medium.\nSet F/Stop at 1.\nSet Stage level A.\nSet luminescence exposure time to 180 sec.",
    "For creation of 3D pictures in order to better quantify the electroporated area from the positive pups, use the following DLIT settings for firefly luciferase.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen3.jpg\nClick here to view larger figure[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen3large.jpg].\n\t\nSet a checkmark on Photograph; the camera takes a photo from above after starting the measurement.\nSet a checkmark on Structure, the surface of the animal is scanned by the IVIS prior the bioluminescence measurement.\nUse following Emission filters and exposure time settings until the age of two weeks:\n\t\tEmission filter 1: 590 nm, exposure time 300 sec\n\t\tEmission filter 2: 600 nm, exposure time 240 sec\n\t\tEmission filter 3: 620 nm, exposure time 180 sec\n\t\tEmission filter 4: 640 nm, exposure time 120 sec\n\t\tFor rats older than P20\n\t\tEmission filter 1: 600 nm, exposure time 300 sec\n\t\tEmission filter 2: 620 nm, exposure time 300 sec\n\t\tEmission filter 3: 640 nm, exposure time 300 sec\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen3.jpg\nClick here to view larger figure[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen3large.jpg].\n\t\tDue to the decrease in signal strength in older animals, the exposure time is enlarged for the three best emission filters.\nSet Stage level B\nSet Binning to medium.\nSet F/Stop at 1\nAfter measurement, mark the rats by an earhole code to differentiate them from each other and to match them to the IVIS Live Imaging pictures\nAt the end of the measurement procedure, turn off isoflurane influx and keep the rat on the warmed plate for some minutes before returning it to its cage.\n3. Analysis of Bioluminescence Images\nThe generation of 3D images, 3D movies and the quantification of the volume of the signal source is made by the Living Image software pre-installed on the IVIS Spectrum.\nGeneration of 3D images\n\t\nFirst, reconstruct a surface topography, therefore set threshold between 20-30%.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen4.jpg\nClick here to view larger figure[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen4large.jpg].\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen5.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50146/50146screen6.jpg",

Behavioral Testing\nBehavioral testing was performed in order to determine whether IUE-mediated gene manipulations in the rat might initiate long-term effects that persist into adulthood. In the present particular case, the effect of transient, unilateral full length human DISC1 cortical overexpression after IUE was investigated by testing locomotion in an open field (OF), with and without a low dose of amphetamine, as a specific test for dopamine-related behavior 24. In a similar procedure performed by Niwa et al. in IUE mice using DISC1 knockdown, IUE mice but not controls showed hypersensitivity to amphetamine18.\nRats that were in utero electroporated with a DISC1 overexpressing vector were held under laboratory conditions with 12 hr light from 7 am to 7 pm and were fed ad libitum. At 3 months of age, rats underwent behavioral testing.\nFor quantifying locomotion as a readout of amphetamine effects, an open-field of a Tru Scan activity system situated in a sound- and light-isolated chamber was used. This system measures the duration time and distance the animal moves, time and distance spent in the margin or center of the open field, as well as rearing behavior25.\nOn the first day, test after saline injection\n\t\nWeigh the animals.\nInject intraperitoneally 1 μl/g body weight of a saline solution (1x PBS).",
    "Right after the injection, put the animal into the open-field and start the measurement of the TruScan system. Record for 15 min and subdivide data into 3 x 5 min parts.\nPut the animal back into its home cage.\nSecond day, test on amphetamine injection\n\t\nWeigh the animals.\nInject intraperitoneally 1 μl/g body weight of a 0.5 mg/ml amphetamine solution.\nRight after the injection put the animal into the open-field and start the measurement of the TruScan system. Record for 15 min and subdivide data into 3 x 5 min parts.\nReturn the animal to its home cage.\nAnalyze locomotion and rearing behavior generated by specific Tru Scan software. Create Graphs with GraphPad (Prism) and calculate statistics by SPSS Statistics software."
