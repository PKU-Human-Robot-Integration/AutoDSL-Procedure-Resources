    "Note: The overall process of fabricating magnetic field-responsive gelatin microgels is illustrated in Figure 1A.\n1. Preparing Solutions and Suspensions\nPrepare a crosslinker genipin (1% w/v) solution by dissolving 20 mg of genipin in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS; pH 7.4). Vortex the solution and place in a 50 oC water bath for 2 hr to completely dissolve the solution.\nPrepare a surfactant solution by dissolving 20 mg of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(propylene glycol)-poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw = 2,900 Da; referred to as L64) in 200 ml of PBS to be at the concentration of 100 ppm.\nPrepare a 15% (w/v) gelatin solution by dissolving 64.5 mg of gelatin in 0.43 ml of PBS. Vortex the solution and place it on water bath at 37 oC until it reaches a sol phase, where the solution becomes fluidic. Then, vortex the gelatin solution 2 - 3 times to ensure the homogeneity of the sample.\nPreparation of p(NIPAM-co-AAm)/MNPs solution with a model drug (BSA):\n\t\nDisperse 10.75 mg of hydrophilic MNPs in 0.43 ml of PBS and then dissolve 12.9 mg of p(NIPAM-co-AAm) in the MNP suspension to make the concentration at 3% (w/v). The increased concentration of p(NIPAM-co-AAm) can be used to achieve an increased deswelling behavior of microgels.\nUse Texas-Red conjugated bovine serum albumin (TR-BSA; Mw ~66 kDa) as a model drug. Dissolve 0.5 mg of TR-BSA in the mixture of p(NIPAM-co-AAm)/MNPs.\nPrepare mixtures of gelatin/p(NIPAM-co-AAm)/MNPs/BSA solution (0.86 ml) by adding mixture of p(NIPAM-co-AAm)/MNPs (0.43 ml) into the gelatin solution (0.43 ml) and then thoroughly vortex them to make a homogeneous mixture. Thus, the concentrations of polymers and MNP become half of the initial concentrations in the final mixture.\n2. Emulsification\nPour 15 ml of silicone oil [polydimethylsiloxane (viscosity 350 cSt)] into a clean and sterile beaker.",
    "Immediately add the pre-prepared aqueous mixtures of gelatin/p(NIPAM-co-AAm)/MNPs/BSA solution (0.86 ml) into the silicone oil and emulsify the aqueous mixture in the oil phase by stirring with a magnetic stirring bar at 900 rpm at 30 oC for 30 min.\n3. Gelation and Transfer of Micro-droplets to an Aqueous Solution\nTransfer the emulsion (~16 ml) from beaker into a 50 ml tube.\nCool down the tube for 10 min at 4 °C for gelation of the micro-droplets in the oil.\nFill the tube with the prepared L64 solution (at 4 oC) up to 50 ml and vigorously shake the tube. It may be possible that a portion of L64 surfactants would be within the microgels.\nCentrifuge the tube for 20 min at 2,300 x g at 4 oC.\nRegularly check for the presence of the pellet of gel particles on the side of the tube. If the particles are not seen, centrifuge for another 20 min at the same speed and temperature. Proceed to carefully remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet formed on the inner wall of the tube.\nRepeat steps (3.3) through (3.5) once more. Each time, transfer the sample to a new tube to avoid the inclusion of any oil droplets in the microgel suspension. After this step, ensure that surfactants or oil droplets are not present in the sample suspension. However, the repeated separation steps may lead to loss of initial materials.\n4. Covalent Crosslinking of the Microgels\nAdd 2 ml of genipin solution (prepared in section 1) to the pellet of gel particles and mix them well by vortexing the solution.\nQuickly transfer the tube of the suspension in water bath at 23 oC to initiate a covalent crosslinking reaction during a desired crosslinking time (e.g., 5 - 120 min).",
    "After crosslinking, immediately remove any excessive crosslinkers by discarding the genipin solution, resuspending the microgels in PBS, and centrifuging the tube for 20 min at 2,300 x g (4 oC). If needed, cautiously break apart formed pellet with a pipette tip. This washing step can be repeated up to 3 times if the genipin is still remaining in the solution.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the microgels in PBS at a desired density (e.g., 5 × 106 microgels/ml) by counting the number with a hemocytometer.\nFor microscopic observations, load the microgel suspension in the space between a slide glass and a cover slip and seal the boundary of the cover slip with epoxy resin.\n5. Application of Alternating Magnetic Field for Triggering Drug Release\nPlace the tube with desired concentration of microgels in aqueous media into the chamber of magnetic coils. If necessary, insert a fiber optic temperature probe into the tube to monitor temperature change of the media during the application of AMF.\nApply high frequency (>100 kHz) AMF at a defined field strength (>5 kA/m) and for a specified duration. Following the application of AMF, centrifuge the sample tube for 20 min at 2,273 x g (4 oC) and collect the supernatant to quantify the amount of TR-BSA released from microgel to the surrounding media using spectrophotometry. The excitation and emission wavelengths for Texas Red are 584 nm and 612 nm, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
