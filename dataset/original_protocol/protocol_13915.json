    "1. Preparation of metal cylinders\nAnalyze cylindrical cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) rods fulfilling the standard specifications for surgical implants for their chemical composition using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy per manufacturer’s protocol to confirm provided values.\n\tNOTE: The elemental composition of the CoCrMo alloy used for this experiment is 65% Co, 28% Cr, 5% Mo and 2% others.\nWet grind the samples with silicon carbide grinding paper starting with a grain size of 500. Use grinding paper in increasing order up to a grain size of 4000.\nPolish the cylinder with 3 µm and 1 µm paste to achieve a surface roughness that is within the tolerance level of surface finish requirements for metallic surgical implants (ISO 5832-12:2019) and total and partial joint replacement implants (ISO 21534:2007).\n\tNOTE: The average surface roughness is determined using a confocal microscope.\nCut CoCrMo rods (Ø of 6 mm) to cylinders with a length of 10 mm.\n2. Harvesting of osteochondral cylinders\nUse bovine stifle joints from skeletally mature animals (aged 18-24 months at the time of sacrifice) and keep them contained and cooled until dissection within 24 h after sacrifice.\n\tNOTE: Joints are purchased from the local butcher. The joint remains closed until dissection.\nTo harvest cylindrical osteochondral plugs under aseptic conditions, disinfect the knee and perform an arthrotomy and expose the medial femoral condyle.\n\tNOTE: The dissection has to be performed with caution not to damage the articular surface.\nInspect the articular surface for macroscopic damages.\n\tNOTE: Discard the sample if the cartilage lacks its whitish, smooth and glossy appearance or if there is blistering, fissures or larger defects.",
    "Align the cutting tube perpendicular to the articular surface of the weight-bearing area and drive the device into the cartilage and subchondral bone by firm strokes with a hammer. At 15 mm penetration depth, twist the device clockwise with a sudden motion.\nRemove the device, insert the white knob and screw it in until the bottom end of the osteochondral plug is visible.\nMark the anteroposterior orientation of the samples with a sterile marker in order to arrange the osteochondral cylinder accordingly during testing.\n\tNOTE: The three-dimensional collagen network and its complex architecture facilitate the unique mechanical properties of articular cartilage and should be considered in the orientation of the samples.\nRinse the sample with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to wash off blood and fat tissue.\nRepeat the steps mentioned above to harvest the desired number of osteochondral plugs (8 mm diameter, 15 mm length).\n\tNOTE: Typically, 9 to 12 osteochondral cylinders can be harvested from the weight bearing area on the medial femoral condyle.\nPlace the samples in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin 200 U/mL; streptomycin 0.2 mg/mL) and amphotericin B 2.5 µg/mL and store them at 4 °C until testing to maintain viability.\nAnalyze control osteochondral plugs immediately after harvesting to establish baseline values (see analysis section).\n3. Tribological testing\nPerform the experiments using a commercially available reciprocating tribometer with a cylinder-on-plate configuration. Requirements for the device are vertical loading and adjustable load and sliding speed. Furthermore, a liquid cell enables to perform the tests in a lubricating solution.",
    "Determine the contact pressure in the CoCrMo-on-cartilage system using a pressure measurement film. Place the pressure measurement film at the interface and apply static load for 30 s to determine initial contact pressure, contact size and shape. Owing to the convexity of the metal cylinder and the articular cartilage, the initial contact area has an elliptical shape in this configuration.\n\tNOTE: The pressure measurement film reacts to the applied pressure showing red discoloration of zones where the threshold pressure is reached or exceeded. For 1 N of load, the contact pressure was determined around 2 MPa by visual comparison with defined contact pressures.\nFix the osteochondral cylinders on the bottom sample holder with the marking aligned with the sliding direction, and mount the CoCrMo cylinders onto the upper load cell.\nAdd the testing solution (PBS with 3 g/L hyaluronic acid) into the liquid cell that results in submerging the osteochondral cylinder and covering the metal-cartilage sliding interface.\nSet the testing parameters (prescribed normal force, stroke and sliding speed), which are then applied and maintained throughout the test.\n\tNOTE: The stroke length of the reciprocating motion must be set according to the contact area to create a migrating contact area (MCA). For plugs that are 8 mm in diameter, a 2 mm stroke allows adequate rehydration of the cartilage.\nStart reciprocal sliding of the CoCrMo cylinder against the articular cartilage immersed in the lubricating solution with the set loading parameters.\nMonitor the coefficient of friction (COF) during the experiments.\n\tNOTE: The COF is assessed automatically but can be calculated using the equation μ=F/W (μ - coefficient of friction; F - frictional force; W - normal load applied by the system).\nTerminate the experiment after the desired testing period.",
    "Remove the osteochondral plug from the sample holder, rinse it with PBS and store it in medium until further biological analysis (see below).\nSubmerge control samples in the testing solution at room temperature for the duration of the test and analyze together with samples that have been exposed to mechanical loading.\n4. Analysis\nNOTE: Osteochondral cylinder are analyzed for metabolic activity and gene expression to investigate biological activity; histology is performed to study cartilage surface integrity and the underlying matrix.\nHistology\n\t\nFor histological analysis, immerse the osteochondral plugs in 4% buffered formaldehyde solution at room temperature until further processing.\nRinse the samples with PBS and place them into a plastic vessel.\nAdd an excess of the ready-to-use decalcifier-solution so that all samples are covered.\nApply constant agitation for 4 weeks for complete decalcification.\nAfter decalcification, embed the samples in water soluble glycols and resins and store them at −80 °C.\nObtain 6 µm sections by cryosectioning transversal to the contact area.\nSubsequently, prepare the samples for Safranin O staining and Fastgreen counterstaining using a manufacturer’s protocol.\nCapture histological images using a microscope and process using imaging processing software.\nMetabolic activity\n\tNOTE: The metabolic activity of chondrocytes in the articular cartilage are investigated with an XTT-based ex vivo toxicology assay.\n\t\nRinse the osteochondral plug using PBS and place the sample in a Petri dish.\nPlace a 24-well plate on a scale and zero the scale.\nCut off the cartilage from the osteochondral graft with a scalpel in one piece.\nBisect the cartilage in two equal pieces so that the contact area is equally distributed onto both cartilage pieces and mince one half to 1 mm³ pieces. The second half is used for gene expression analysis.",
    "Transfer the minced cartilage into one well of the prepared 24-well plate and determine the tissue weight.\nRepeat the steps mentioned above for each sample and add 1 mL of growth medium to each well of the plate.\nAdd the XTT solution (490 µL of XTT labelling reagent and 10 µL of activation reagent) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and mix.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h.\nAfter incubation, remove the supernatant and transfer it to a 5 mL tube.\nExtract the tetrazolium product by adding 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the cartilage tissue in the 24-well plate and apply continuous agitation for 1 h at room temperature.\nRemove the DMSO solution and pool it with the previously collected XTT solution.\nTransfer 100 µL of the sample in triplicates in a 96-well plate on a plate reader and measure the absorbance at a wavelength of 492 nm and a reference wavelength at 690 nm.\nNormalize the resulting absorbance values to the wet weight of each sample and perform analysis using software.\nGene expression analysis\nRNA isolation\n\t\tNOTE: RNA isolation is carried out using a commercial kit (Table of Materials) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer with small amendments.\n\t\t\nMince the second half of the cartilage tissue obtained from the osteochondral plug into small pieces.\nTransfer them to a tube containing ceramic beads and 300 µL of Lysis Buffer (containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The samples can be frozen in liquid nitrogen until further processing.",
    "Thaw the samples for 2 min and use the commercial lyser for homogenization of the tissue. Apply 6500 rpm for 20 s (homogenization step) four times with a 2 min cooling phase after each run (at 4 °C using the commercial lyser cooling device) to fully disrupt the tissue.\nAdd 20 µL of proteinase K and 580 µL of RNase-free water to each tube and incubate them at 55 °C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the samples for 3 min at 10,000 x g and transfer the supernatant to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 0.5 volumes of 90% ethanol to each tube and mix.\nTransfer 700 µL of the sample to an RNA binding column placed in a 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 s.\nDiscard the flow-through and repeat the centrifugation step for the complete lysate.\nAdd 350 µL of Buffer RW1 to the column, centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 s, and discard the flow-through.\nMix 10 µL of DNase stock solution and 70 µL of Buffer RDD.
