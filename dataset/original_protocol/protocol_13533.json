    "This study was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and was approved by the local institutional review board (ID 2020-02561). The patient gave written informed consent for further use of the images and videos. The video shows the processes involved in performing robotic cochlear implantation with the planning software and the robotic system (please refer to the Table of Materials for further details) according to the procedure described by the manufacturer.\n1. Patient candidacy screening\nNOTE: Use existing preoperative computed tomography images for this step. Currently, robotic cochlear implantation with the system used in this protocol is only available from a single manufacturer (see Table of Materials) for implant systems. Please refer to the instructions for use manual of the planning software for specific details regarding button clicks, software commands, and user inputs.\nUse the planning software to load preoperative computed tomography images and to generate the surfaces of the temporal bone, the external auditory canal, the ossicles, the facial nerve, the chorda tympani, and the cochlea.\nUse the planning software to plan a virtual trajectory through the facial recess.\nConfirm a safe distance between the drilling trajectory and the surrounding anatomical structures. To ensure a safe drilling trajectory, the distance of the trajectory to the facial nerve has to be at least 0.4 mm, and the distance to the chorda tympani has to be at least 0.3 mm. Only patients with safe drilling distances are eligible for robotic cochlear implantation.\nUse the planning software to select a suitable electrode array size. In cases with residual hearing, consider including the preoperative audiogram for CI electrode array selection.\n2. Fiducial screw insertion\nPrepare the patient on the OR table and administer general anesthesia as per the conventional cochlear implantation procedure.",
    "Mark the retroauricular incision for the cochlear implant using a surgical marker. Perform the incision, lift the musculocutaneous flap, and use the curette to expose the mastoid cortical bone.\nMark the position of the five fiducial screws. Position the first four registration screws retroauricularly at approximately 20-30 mm in a trapezoid pattern. Place the fifth screw, for patient marker attachment, approximately a thumb distance from the first four screws and as inferior as possible.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the instructions for an illustration of the screw arrangement.\nUse the pre-drill bit and drill handpiece to pre-drill the holes for the screws, with particular emphasis that the drill is held perpendicular to the bone surface.Insert the screws into the pre-drilled holes. Ensure that the screws are firmly fixed in the bone.\n\tâ€‹CAUTION: Always check the stability of the screws. In case of a loose screw, repeat step 2.3. and step 2.4. to reposition the screw.\n3. Preoperative imaging\nPerform computed-tomography (CT) imaging or cone beam CT imaging with a minimum resolution of 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm as per the manufacturer's instructions. Perform imaging under apnea to reduce motion artifacts.\nExport the images via a USB stick and import them into the planning software. Verify the image data quality and visibility of all the screws in the CT data.\n4. Preoperative planning\nNOTE: Perform preoperative planning in parallel with patient preparation (step 5.) to save time. Please refer to the instructions for use manual of the planning software for mesh generation and for specific details regarding button clicks, software commands, and user inputs.\nRun the automatic fiducial screw detection in the planning software. Generate the temporal bone surface mesh.\nGenerate the external auditory canal surface mesh. Generate the malleus and incus surface meshes.\nGenerate the stapes surface mesh.",
    "Generate the facial nerve surface mesh.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure that you segment the facial nerve with a safety margin (e.g., 3 voxels). If desired, let a neuroradiologist verify the labels.\nGenerate the chorda tympani surface mesh. Generate the cochlea surface mesh and specify the target position on the cochlea (usually the center of the round window).\nPlan the drill trajectory and approve the plan with the neuroradiologist. Export the plan to a data stick for transfer to the robotic system.\n5. Patient preparation\nAlign the patient's head within the headrest in a way that the neck is supported by the bottom cushion and the patient's nose is aligned with the center of the head rest's top frame. Ensure that the patient's head is sufficiently fixed in the headrest.\n\tCAUTION: The correct alignment of the head is essential for the accessibility of the robotic system to the surgical site.\nPlace the facial nerve monitoring electrodes. Place the bipolar needle electrodes in the orbicularis oculi and the orbicularis oris for monitoring. Place the self-adhesive pad electrodes on the superficial facial nerve branch for stimulation. Place the monopolar needle electrodes on the chest for stimulation and monitoring.\nTest the correct placement of the electrodes by control stimulation performed according to the instructions for use from the manufacturer of the robotic system.\nCover the robotic system and navigation platform with a sterile drape.\nPlace, align, and fix the patient marker on the fifth screw such that it is visible to the robotic system's tracking camera. Ensure that the patient marker is attached rigidly and that all the joints are firmly tightened. It is critical to avoid any movement of the patient marker after the registration process. In the case of movement, repeat the registration.",
    "Perform patient-to-plan registration, which is the process to relate the virtual plan to the actual patient. Use the handpiece with the registration tool and place it onto each fiducial screw (four times). Perform the registration procedure as per the instructions for use from the manufacturer. The screen on the navigation platform indicates which screw to position the tool on.\nAfter all screw positions are digitized, the registration accuracy is computed. Confirm that the registration accuracy is sufficient to continue by checking the fiducial registration error (FRE). The robotic system does not allow the continuation of the procedure if the fiducial registration error (FRE) is higher than 0.050 mm.\n6. Middle ear access - Phase 1\nInsert the drill bit into the handpiece and attach the irrigation nozzle. Move the robotic arm into the surgical field. The handpiece with the drill slowly approaches the surgical site. Confirm the alignment of the drill bit with the virtual trajectory planned in the planning software.\nStart drilling with the robotic system. The system will drill with a pecking motion until the first safety checkpoint (above the facial recess) is reached. After the first safety checkpoint is reached, move the robotic arm out of the surgical field.\n7. Intraoperative imaging safety check\nRemove the patient marker from the patient. Insert and push the trajectory reference rod inside the drilled tunnel. Drape the patient's head with sterile draping.\nPerform CT imaging or cone beam CT imaging with the help of the neuroradiology department team.\nLoad the CT data into the planning software and confirm together with the neuroradiologist that the trajectory is safe. Refer to the instructions for use of the planning software for further details. Remove the draping and the trajectory reference rod.\n8. Middle ear access - Phase 2",
    "Reattach the patient marker. Ensure that the patient marker is attached rigidly and that all the joints are firmly tightened.\nRepeat the registration by placing the handpiece with the registration tool onto each of the fiducial screws for position digitization. After all the screw positions are digitized, the registration accuracy is computed. Confirm that the registration accuracy is sufficient to continue.\nInsert the drill bit into the handpiece. Confirm the alignment of the drill bit with the drill tunnel and continue drilling until the first facial nerve stimulation point is reached.\nInsert the facial nerve probe to check the integrity of the facial nerve. Afterward, the robotic system will drill to the next facial nerve stimulation point. In total, five facial nerve stimulation points will be tested.\nContinue drilling until the tympanic cavity is reached.\n9. Inner ear access\nNOTE: Inner ear access is a semi-automatic procedure that can be stopped by the surgeon at any time for visual inspection.\nRemove the drill bit from the handpiece of the robotic system and insert the diamond drill bit for inner ear access. Use the trajectory pointer to verify the target upon milling.\nStart the robotic system to mill the bony overhang. The system will automatically stop after breakthrough to ensure that a sufficient aperture for the electrode array is achieved, while aiming to preserve the round window membrane.\nConfirm the inner ear access either via an endoscope or via a microscope through a tympanomeatal flap.\n10. Implant management and electrode insertion\nRemove the patient marker and all five fiducial screws. If not already performed, make a tympanomeatal flap to visualize the cochlear promontory.\nMark the implant body position using the surgical template and prepare the implant pocket.",
    "Mill out the lead canal for the excess electrode lead using an otologic drill. Clean the drilled tunnel with suction and irrigation.\nManually open the round window membrane with a pick. Insert the insertion guide tube into the drilled tunnel. The tube will ensure that the electrode array is protected against blood and bone dust and is directed to the inner ear access.\nFix the cochlear implant body in the pocket and manually insert the electrode array through the insertion guide tube.\nMark the electrode lead to indicate full insertion through the insertion guide tube. Use the insertion guide tube as a reference, i.e., by placing it next to the electrode array such that the medial end of the guide tube is aligned with the intended insertion depth, e.g., the outermost contact. Then, mark the array at the lateral end of the guide tube.\nAfter the final insertion depth is achieved, remove the insertion guide tube. Fix the electrode array with fat and arrange the excess electrode lead as a loop in the mastoid cavity as in conventional cochlear implantation.\n11. Implant telemetry and wound closure\nPerform impedance telemetry and record electrically evoked compound action potentials for nerve response monitoring12.\nClose the wound using disposable stitches."
