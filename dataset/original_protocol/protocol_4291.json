    "Extraction   If using dried (lyophilized) pericarp samples use ~0.25 to 0.5 g for each extraction, grind samples to a powder in a mortar and pestle. If using fresh frozen pericarp samples, use ~2.5 to 5 g for each extraction. Chop the frozen pericarp into small pieces measuring ~4 mm2 using a manual food chopper. See Figure 1.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141001/20141001071743_4903.jpg Figure 1. Processing of fresh Capsicum pericarp. A. Pericarp samples are placed in lower chamber of food chopper. B. Samples are chopped to very small pieces C.     Place samples in a 50 ml plastic tube, add ~25 ml CHCl3 and use the polytron to thoroughly homogenize the sample, ~20 to 30 sec. See Figure 2.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141001/20141001071820_2595.jpg Figure 2. Homogenization of fresh Capsicum pericarp. A. Chopped pericarp in a 40 or 50 ml tube with 25 ml CHCl3. B. Sample is homogenized with polytron for 20 to 30 sec. C. Fresh fruit sample is completely dispersed in CHCl3.    Allow the homogenized tissue to sit in the CHCl3 for 30 min with occasional mixing by either a vortex mixer or by a bath sonicator.   If using frozen fresh samples, centrifuge the sample to separate the CHCl3 phase from the aqueous phase (upper layer); 1,000 x g, 5 min at 4 °C. Keep the CHCl3 phase. If using dried samples, this step is not performed.   Filter the CHCl3 extract using Whatman 1 (or equivalent) filter paper and a vacuum filter.   Transfer filtrate to a ~40 ml glass amber vial and evaporate the solvent using a stream of N2 gas and gentle heating (50 °C). A nitrogen evaporator works well for this step.   Resuspend the dried sample in 1.1 ml of 2-propanol. Bath sonication is advised to help resuspend the material.   Material can be stored at -20 or -80 °C for several weeks.",
    "We keep the extracted sample out of bright light as much as possible. During the time the sample is on the nitrogen evaporator in the fume hood, we keep the lights off in the hood; we store the samples in amber vials and we keep the vials in the dark as much as possible.      Saponification   In a standard microfuge tube, combine 0.5 ml of the 2-propanol extract with 0.1 ml of methanolic KOH, in a 1.8 ml microfuge tube.   Mix well by pipetting, then incubate for 30 min at 50 °C.   Cool the sample by immersion in an ice bath for ~2 min, then add 0.5 ml of water.   Add 0.4 ml of CHCl3. Vortex vigorously.   Centrifuge for 1-2 min at top speed (10,000 to 12,000 x g) in a microcentrifuge to resolve the phases. Lower centrifugal forces will also resolve the CHCl3 and aqueous phases.   Remove (discard) the upper phase; recover the lower phase.      HPLC Analysis   Sample volume for the HPLC is typically 10 to 30 µl. The volume used depends on the concentration of the carotenoid preparation. Determine the OD 450 nm for a 1:100 dilution of the carotenoid sample. If the A450 of the diluted sample is 0.5 to 1.0, then inject 10 µl of concentrated sample onto the HPLC. If the A450 is 0.25 to 0.5, then inject 20 µl. If the A450 is 0.1 to 0.25, then inject 30 µl. If the absorbance is above 1.0, then dilute the sample appropriately. If the absorbance is below 0.1, then concentrate the sample appropriately (e.g. evaporate some of the solvent under a stream of N2 gas).   Chromatography is conducted on an HPLC system with a photodiode array detector using the full visible spectrum (400 - 700 nm) with monitoring employed at 450 nm.",

Stock solutions at 1 mg/ml are prepared in CHCl3 (hexane can also be used).    Samples representing the range of 10 ng to 3 µg are prepared by dilution of the stock solution and independently analyzed by HPLC as described above. The retention time of the single peak and the area under the curve is recorded and plotted against the amount of the carotenoid injected.    In our lab most carotenoids have a linear response at 450 nm for detection between 10 ng to 3 µg, with R2 values of 0.999.    The formulas we used to convert HPLC peak area for the specific carotenoids into concentrations expressed as ng/g tissue are: Antheraxanthin (ng/g tissue): (peak area - 1316.8)/5,816.9/ injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) β-carotene (ng/g tissue): (peak area - 55,271)/4,253.5/ injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) β-cryptoxanthin (ng/g tissue): (41,437 + peak area)/6,758.4/injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) Capsanthin (ng/g tissue): (28,266 + peak area)/4,489.5 injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) Capsorubin (ng/g tissue): (26,864 + peak area)/5,541.4/injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) Lutein (ng/g tissue): (peak area - 1,428.9)/6312/injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) Lycopene (ng/g tissue): (28,266 + peak area)/4,489.5/injected volume (μl) x sample dilution x undiluted sample volume (μl)/tissue mass (grams) Violaxanthin (ng/g tissue): (28,616 + peak area)/7,453.",

We use the calibration curve for β-carotene to estimate the abundance of unassigned carotenoid peaks, those that do not elute at the retention time of a reference standard (e.g. peaks a-g in Figure 3).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141001/20141001071856_2800.jpg Figure 3.
