Sterilize these stock solutions using\n        filters with 0.22 μm diameter pores and use them immediately or maintain\n        them for a maximum of 2 weeks at 4°C.\n      \nNote: α-MDG is a non-metabolizable sugar.\n      Because it is non-metabolizable, when it is taken up by the\n      C. elegans, it accumulates in the body increasing the interstitial\n      osmolarity. Increase in interstitial osmolarity causes shrinkage of the\n      worm body and the cilia of sensory neurons (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n      Glucose and sucrose on the other hand are metabolized, thus, they do not\n      increase interstitial or cellular osmolarity.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\n        After the NGM agar medium cools down to 55°C.\n        \n            Add 1 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 1 mL\n            of 5 mg/mL of cholesterol, 1.25 mL of 10 mg/mL nystatin, 25 mL of\n            0.5 M KP buffer as described above.\n          \n            Add 100 mL of 1.5 M glucose, or sucrose, or α-MDG (final\n            concentration 150 mM) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2641-Fig1.jpg\n                  Figure 1. Schematic representation of the protocols described\n                  here\n                \n                  For each compound the sequence of the procedure is shown from\n                  left to right. The small circles in the plates represent the\n                  eggs.\n                \nCritical: Do this step in aseptic\n      conditions (near a Bunsen burner or under the hood) to maintain sterility\n      of the plates and the stock solutions. To prevent clumping, use the\n      stirring bar you added to the flask to mix the medium while it is cooling\n      and while ingredients are added.\n    \nNote: Remember to vortex the nystatin\n      solution right before adding it to the medium.",
    "Note: Use a sterile thermometer to check\n      the temperature of the medium. Sterilize the thermometer using 10% bleach\n      in water.\n    \nNote: Other concentrations of glucose, or\n      sucrose, or α-MDG can be used.\n    \n        Add 10 mL of glucose, sucrose, or α-MDG supplemented NGM medium into\n        5 cm petri dishes using a 25 mL sterile plastic pipette.\n      \n        Leave the NGM plates at room temperature (around 20°C) with the lid on\n        for about 24 h to allow polymerization and evaporation of excess\n        moisture before seeding with the bacteria.\n      \n        Seed the plates with 500 μL of dead bacteria (see\n        preparation of concentrated dead bacteria[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]).\n      \nNote: To eliminate the possibility that\n      the OP50 bacteria feed on glucose or sucrose dissolved in the plates and\n      thus grow more on these plates than in the control or α-MDG plates, dead\n      bacteria are used for this protocol.\n    \n        Leave the plates under the hood for about 15–20 min to allow evaporation\n        of the liquid.\n      \nNote: The regular NGM plates normally used\n      for routine growth of C. elegans are used here as control.\nSeed 120–150 eggs per plate.\n        Use the worms for imaging or behavioral assays 3–4 days later, when they\n        have reached adulthood. In our experiments we used day 1 adults.\n      \nNote: We have not consistently tested\n      whether growing C. elegans on α-MDG enriched plates for shorter\n      periods of time results in the same osmotic effects. However, we have\n      found that cultivation in 150 mM glucose for 24 h rescues eat-6 and\n      catp-1 mutants’ nose touch avoidance, likely by increasing ATP\n      levels in the cell.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nCritical: Monitor worm development to\n      ensure that animals are at the desired stage since using dead bacteria and\n      α-MDG supplementation slightly delays development (∼ 10 h). If needed,\n      adjust experimental time points to account for effects on development.",
    "Preparation of NGM plates enriched with salts\nTiming: 3 days\n        For NaCl and KCl supplemented plates:\n        \n            Weigh 2.5 g of bacto peptone, 3 g of NaCl, 17 g of agar, 0.2 g of\n            streptomycin, and 11.2 g of KCl, or 8.8 g of NaCl (final\n            concentration 150 mM).\n          \n            Put these components, 975 mL of ddH2O, and a magnetic\n            stir bar into a 2 L flask.\n          \nAutoclave as described above.\nNote: This is the recipe for NGM plates\n      with the addition of KCl or NaCl.\n    \nNote: KCl and NaCl are stable at high\n      temperature, thus, they can be added prior to the autoclaving step.\n    \nAlternatives: KCl and NaCl\n      enriched plates can be prepared starting from 1 M stock solutions,\n      similarly to how the Na-acetate, Na-gluconate, or KHCO3 plates\n      are prepared (see below).\n    \nFor Na-acetate, Na-gluconate, or KHCO3\nsupplemented plates: Prepare the NGM medium as described above\n        but use 825 mL of ddH2O, instead of 975 mL.\n        \n            Prepare 1 M stock solutions of Na-acetate, Na-gluconate, or KHCO3\n            in ddH2O.\n          \n            Sterilize the stock solutions by filtering using 0.22 μm diameter\n            pore filters.\n          \n            Add 150 mL of these stock solutions to the autoclaved NGM after it\n            reaches 55°C to the final concentration of 150 mM (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n          \n        After the NGM medium has cooled down to 55°C, add 1 mL of 1 M\n        CaCl2, 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 1 mL of 5 mg/mL of\n        cholesterol, 1.25 mL of 10 mg/mL nystatin, and 25 mL of 0.5 M KP buffer,\n        as described above.\n      \nCritical: If you use other salts or\n      higher concentrations of the salts mentioned above, using pH strips, check\n      the pH of the plates. Monitor the pH every 2 or 3 days. If the pH changes\n      over time, prepare fresh plates every time they are needed.",
    "The next day, seed the plates with fresh OP50 bacteria.\n        \n            Dip a spreader in a plate containing OP50 in Luria Broth (LB)\n            medium.\n          \n            Drag the spreader across the plate to form a square of bacteria lawn\n            in the center of the plate.\n          \n            Allow the bacteria to grow over night (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n          \nCritical: We noticed that bacteria\n      grow more slowly on KHCO3 enriched plates. To avoid differences\n      in food availability, when comparing conditions to KHCO3\n      enriched plates, seed the plates using concentrated bacteria (see\n      preparation of concentrated live bacteria[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\n    \nNote: If you use other salts that affect\n      the growth of bacteria, use concentrated bacteria instead (as mentioned\n      above).\n    \n        Seed about 120–150 eggs on control NGM plates and on salt enriched\n        plates. Use the worms for experiments 3–4 days later.\n      \nCritical: If the salts you use are\n      affecting the development of worms, adjust the time of the experiments to\n      account for delayed development.\n    \n      Preparation of NGM plates containing serotonin hydrochloride\n    \nTiming: ∼1 h\n        Prepare a 40 mM stock solution of serotonin by dissolving 42.53 mg of\n        serotonin hydrochloride into 5 mL of ddH2O. This quantity\n        will be enough for 5 plates.\n      \nNote: Prepare this solution fresh each\n      time. If you need more plates adjust the amount weighted and volume\n      accordingly.\n    \n        Weigh 0.85 g of agar and add it to a 125 mL flask or beaker containing\n        45 mL of ddH2O.\n        \n            Microwave the solution until the agar is completely dissolved.\n          \n            Monitor the agar in the microwave and stop and mix multiple times to\n            prevent overboiling of the agar.\n          \n        Add a sterile stirring bar and allow the solution to cool down to 50°C\n        while mixing.\n        \n            When the solution has cooled add 1.25 mL of KP buffer and the 5 mL\n            of serotonin hydrochloride for a final concentration of 4 mM (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Critical: The serotonin hydrochloride\n      needs to be added to the NGM solution when the temperature is lower than\n      55°C–50°C to avoid heat-inactivation.\n    \nCritical: Store serotonin in the dark\n      at 4°C as it is light and temperature sensitive.\n    \nNote: We do not add CaCl2,\n      MgSO4, cholesterol or nystatin as worms crawl on these plates\n      for only 30 min.\n    \n        Pour 10 mL of solution in each 5 cm diameter plate and let the plates\n        dry on the bench overnight.\n      \n        Collect adult worms off an NGM plate using 1 mL of M9.\n        \n            Wash the worms twice with M9 by centrifugation (4,000–5,000 rpm for\n            5 min).\n          \nTransfer worms onto a fresh NGM plate without food for 5 min.\n            Finally, transfer the worms onto fresh NGM plates or the plates\n            containing serotonin.\n          \n            Let animals crawl for 30 min before using them for behavioral\n            assays.\n          \nAlternatives: Wash the worms by\n      picking them into a 35 mm petri dish containing M9 and letting them swim\n      for 5 min or transfer them to a fresh plate without bacteria and let them\n      crawl for 5–10 min.\n    \n      Treatment of C. elegans with γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) or\n      bicuculline (on plates)\n    \nTiming: ∼1 h\n        Prepare a 540 mM GABA stock solution by weighting 27.84 mg of GABA and\n        dissolving it into 500 μL of ddH2O. Prepare a 10 mM\n        bicuculline stock solution by weighting 3.67 mg of bicuculline and\n        dissolving it into 1 mL of chloroform.\n      \nNote: Open the chloroform bottle under a\n      fume hood.\n    \nCritical: The bicuculline stock\n      solution is maintained in the dark at -20°C.\n    \nNote: Maintain the GABA stock solution at\n      4°C.\n    \nNote: Bicuculline is a competitive\n      antagonist of the GABAA receptors. It inhibits GABA binding to\n      these receptors.\n    \nNote: GABA was used only for imaging\n      experiments as it causes flaccid paralysis of the worms and thus cannot be",
    "used for behavioral assays. Bicuculline was used for both imaging and\n      octanol and nose touch avoidance assays.\n    \nNote: Bicuculline is toxic when in contact\n      with skin or inhaled. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for\n      protective gear.\n    \n        Prepare a 10 mM dilution of GABA by adding 2 μL of the stock into 106 μL\n        of water.\n      \n        Spread 50 μL of 10 mM GABA stock solution on the surface of NGM plates\n        for a final concentration of 50 μM. Spread 50 μL of ddH2O on\n        other NGM plates as control.\n      \n        For experiments using bicuculline:\n        \n            Dilute 10 μL of 10 mM bicuculline in 90 μL of M9 and spread the\n            dilution on the surface of NGM plates for a final concentration\n            10 μM.\n          \n            Spread 10 μL of chloroform diluted in 90 μL of M9 as control (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n          \nCritical: Thoroughly vortex and\n      quickly pipette chloroform or chloroform containing bicuculline + M9 onto\n      the plate, as the two substances tend to separate in two phases.\n    \nLet the plates dry under the hood for about 10 min.\n        Seed 50 μL of freshly cultured OP50 bacteria on the surface of the\n        plates and let them dry under the hood for about 10 min.\n      \n        Transfer young adult worms to the NGM plates containing GABA,\n        bicuculline, ddH2O, or chloroform.\n        \n            Let the worms crawl for 30 min before using them for imaging or\n            behavioral assays. Bicuculline reduces octanol and nose touch\n            avoidance behavior, while 10 μL of the solvent chloroform has no\n            effect (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nTreatment with nifedipine or forskolin (liquid)\nTiming: ∼2 h\n        Prepare a 12.5 mM forskolin stock solution by weighting and dissolving\n        5 mg forskolin into 975 μL of DMSO.\n      \nNote: Forskolin is an activator of adenyl\n      cyclase. It increases intracellular level of cAMP.\n    \nCritical: The stock solution is\n      maintained at -20°C.",
    "Note: Forskolin is toxic, and it causes\n      headache, fast heart beats, and coughing. Follow the manufacturer’s\n      instructions for protective gear.\n    \n        Prepare a 100 mM nifedipine stock solution by weighting and dissolving\n        173 mg of nifedipine into 5 mL of DMSO.\n      \nNote: Nifedipine is a L-type calcium\n      channel blocker.\n    \nCritical: The stock solution is\n      maintained at -20°C.\n    \nNote: Nifedipine is toxic, and it causes\n      hypotension and reflex sinus tachycardia. Follow the manufacturer’s\n      instructions for protective gear.\n    \n        Prepare the M9 buffer as described in the\n        key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\n      \n        Prepare the S medium by mixing the S basal medium with 10 mL of trace\n        metals solution, 20 mL of the 0.5 M KP buffer, 3 mL of 1 M\n        CaCl2, 3 mL of 1 M MgSO4, and 1 mL of 5 mg/mL of\n        cholesterol (see\n        key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\n      \n        Vortex the forskolin stock solution. Then add 1.6 μL of the forskolin\n        stock solution to 2 mL of M9 buffer to reach a final concentration of\n        10 μM.\n      \n        The nifedipine incubation solution is prepared following the same\n        procedure. In this case, add 2 μL of the nifedipine stock solution to\n        2 mL of S medium to reach a final concentration of 100 μM.\n      \nNote: M9 and S basal are probably\n      interchangeable, but we have not systematically tested this.\n    \n        Add concentrated live OP50 bacteria (see\n        preparation of concentrated live bacteria[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]) at the\n        concentration of 6 mg/mL to the forskolin or nifedipine solutions.\n      \nNote: The control group consists in 1.6 μL\n      and 2 μL of DMSO and 6 mg/mL OP50 in 2 mL of M9 buffer and S medium for\n      forskolin and nifedipine experiments, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n    \n        Add the forskolin or nifedipine incubation solutions, and the control\n        solution to individual 3.5 cm diameter petri dishes.",
    "Pick young adult worms to each plate and let them swim for 30 min.\n          \nCritical: Pick more worms than you\n      need as it may be hard to fish some of them out if they sink to the bottom\n      of the dish.\n    \n        Pick the worms out of the solution using either a pick or an eyelash\n        glued on a toothpick.\n        \n            Transfer the worms into a behavioral assay plate or on a cover glass\n            with agar pad for functional imaging experiments (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])."
