    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExpression of the “double mutant” (DM) reaction centers (RCs) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step begins the process of creating the “Double Mutant” (DM) reaction centers (RCs) for the purpose of the electrochemical experiments. The DM RC is a derivative of the wild type RC, where all native Cys are replaced with Ala or Ser (C(H156)A, C(H234)S, C(L92)S, C(L108)S, C(L247)S) (Mahmoudzadeh et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]); two Cys are introduced in hydrophilic regions to promote binding to a gold surface via a gold-thiol covalent bond (Jun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: This step is based on a previous protocol (Jun et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDay 1. In a test tube, inoculate 10 mL LB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL with a few crystals from a glycerol freezer stock of R. sphaeroides cells containing the pIND4-DM plasmid encoding the DM RC. Grow for approximately 24 h at 30°C, shaken or rotated on a wheel.\nDay 2. Add the 10 mL overnight culture to a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 mL LB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL. Grow for approximately 24 h at 30°C, shaken at 200 RPM.\nDay 3. Split the 200 mL overnight culture into four 50 mL aliquots. Use these aliquots to add to four 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 mL RLB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL. To each flask, add isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein production. Grow for 16 h at 30°C, shaken at 200 RPM.\nDay 4. At the end of the 16 h induction period, optical density (OD650) of the cell culture should be 1.5–2 and orange-red in colour.",
    "Pellet cells by centrifuging at 12000×g for 15 min at 4°C in a J-LITE JLA 8.1000 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nDiscard the supernatant and weigh the cell pellet (wet mass). Typical yields are 7 g cell pellet per L culture.\nPause point: If necessary, the pellets can be stored at −20°C for up to 6 months.\nPurification of the DM RCs\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step extracts and purifies the DM RCs from the cell pellet. Keep the sample and buffers on ice or 4°C throughout the duration of the purification process.\nDay 1. Resuspend the cell pellet by stirring in the resuspension buffer, using 2 mL of buffer per gram of cell pellet (e.g., resuspend a 7 g pellet with 14 mL buffer).\nIf the pellet is frozen, add the resuspension buffer to thaw before resuspending by stirring.\nLyse the cell suspension using a French pressure cell press chilled to 4°C. Maintain a pressure between 22500 and 25000 PSI.\nNote: Ensure that the lysate is not very viscous. Lysate should flow easily in well-defined drops. A gooey lysate indicates that not enough DNase was added. Add a few more crystals of DNase to the lysate and stir gently (to not cause frothing) for 1–2 min. Ensure that lysate is no longer viscous before proceeding to the next step.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 10000×g for 20 min at 4°C in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nNote: The pellet contains unwanted whole cells and large cell membrane fragments. The chromatophores, containing the RCs, are found in the supernatant.\nPipette the supernatant into a separate beaker. Note the supernatant volume.",
    "Using a magnetic stir bar, stir the supernatant in the dark at room temperature (19°C–21°C and add 30% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide solution (LDAO) (w/v) dropwise to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). Add 2 M imidazole to a final concentration of 5 mM. Stir for 20–30 min.\nCentrifuge the solubilized solution at 164000×g for 20 min at 4°C in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nNote: The pellet contains insolubilized cell membrane fragments and precipitated proteins. Solubilized RCs are found in the supernatant.\nPipette the supernatant (avoid the loose pellet) into a new beaker.\nNote: To ensure that RCs are present in the supernatant, dilute (10-fold) the supernatant with the wash buffer and measure the absorbance spectrum (250 nm–1000 nm). Absorbance peaks should be present at 760, 804, and 860 nm (corresponding to the cofactors in the RCs), as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] (blue trace).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Absorbance spectra of 10-fold dilutions of solubilized RCs prior to incubation with the Ni2+-NTA resin (precolumn sample, blue) and following incubation with the Ni2+-NTA resin (column flowthrough, red)\nThe decrease in absorbance at 804 nm in the flowthrough compared to the precolumn sample indicates successful binding of the RCs to the resin.\nCritical: The supernatant should not be turbid. Turbidity indicates that proteins are precipitating and will clog the column in subsequent steps. If turbidity is observed, centrifuge again at 164000×g for 20 mins at 4°C in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent. Further addition of LDAO or imidazole is not recommended. Ensure the supernatant is on ice and work quickly.\nEquilibrate clean Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (approximately 4–5 mL of resin in a gravity column) with 2 column volumes wash buffer. Transfer the resin into a 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Add the supernatant to the 50 mL conical tube containing the equilibrated resin. Rock gently overnight (15–18 h) in the dark at 4°C.\nDay 2. Pour the overnight resin suspension onto a gravity column. Allow liquid to flow through into a clean beaker.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of the flowthrough, diluted 10-fold in wash buffer.\nNote: Compare this spectrum of the flowthrough to the spectrum of the starting material supernatant. The 804 nm peak should be much smaller in the flowthrough, indicating that RCs have bound to the resin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: The binding of the RCs, which are dark purple in colour, should cause the Ni2+-NTA agarose resin to also turn dark purple. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The Ni2+-NTA agarose resin appears dark purple in colour after the binding of RCs\nAdd wash buffer continuously to the column.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of the flowthrough, undiluted, after approximately 5 column volumes of wash buffer, then every 50–100 mL of wash buffer.\nMonitor the absorbance at 280 nm. Wash until this value plateaus to <0.05 AU, then allow the wash buffer to drain to the surface of the resin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Absorbance spectra of column washes during purification by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography\nSpectra are measured approximately every 5–10 column volumes and shows a decrease in absorbance at 280 nm with continued washing.\nNote: The absorbance at 280 nm indicates the presence of proteins, due to aromatic amino acids (Trp, Tyr, Phe).\nAdd 5 column volumes of elution buffer to the column, then allow the buffer to flow slowly.\nMonitor the colour of the eluent. Once a pale purple colour is visible (i.e., A804 >0.015 AU), start collecting the sample. Collect until the flowthrough is no longer coloured.",
    "Measure the absorbance spectrum of the elution, diluted 20- or 50-fold in elution buffer. A clean protein will have an A280:A804 ratio of <1.4.\nCritical: If the A280:A804 ratio is <1.4, proceed to step 17. If the ratio is >1.4, proceed to steps 18–24, where the RCs can be cleaned up further using anion exchange chromatography.\nNote: If storing RCs overnight, since there may not be enough time to complete step 17 in a single day, dilute 10-fold in wash buffer as they are less stable at the high imidazole concentrations found in the elution buffer.\nBuffer exchange the RCs into PBS pH 7.2 and 0.03% LDAO using a 15 mL 100 kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit.\nAdd the eluent (from step 16) to a 100 kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit. Centrifuge at 5000×g for 25 min at a time at 4°C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5 mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nAdd PBS to the retentate to a final volume of 15 mL. Centrifuge at 5000×g for 25 min at 4°C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, or until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5 mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nRepeat the previous step.\nNote: This step exchanges the RCs in Tris to PBS in preparation for electrochemistry.\nPause point: Store the RCs in PBS and 0.03% LDAO in the dark at 4°C for up to a week or −80°C for up to 2 months. If stored at −80°C, avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles as this will damage the protein.",
    "Day 3. If necessary (i.e., A280:A804 ratio is >1.4), an anion exchange chromatography step yields higher purity RCs (steps 18–24). Buffer exchange the RCs into the anion loading buffer using a 15 mL 100 kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit.\nAdd the eluent (from step 16) to a 100 kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit. Centrifuge at 5000×g for 25 min at a time at 4°C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5 mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nAdd anion loading buffer to the retentate to a final volume of 15 mL. Centrifuge at 5000×g for 25 min at 4°C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, or until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5 mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nRepeat the previous step.\nNote: This step removes the NaCl in the elution buffer in preparation for loading onto an anion exchange chromatography column.\nEquilibrate the anion exchange resin with approximately 5 column volumes of anion loading buffer, then allow the buffer to drain to the surface of the resin.\nGently add the RCs to the column, ensuring the resin bed is not disturbed. Let the sample flow through.\nCritical: Make sure that the RCs are in a buffer that does not contain NaCl.\nAdd 5 column volumes of anion loading buffer and collect the flowthrough in approximately 5 mL aliquots.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of each flowthrough aliquot. Monitor the absorbance at 804 nm to determine if RCs are bound or eluting. RCs can be considered to be eluting if A804 is over 0.015 AU.\nAdd more buffer until the RCs have stopped eluting, then proceed to the next step.",
    "Repeat the previous step at increasing concentrations of NaCl: 5 mM, 10 mM, 30 mM, 60 mM, and 80 mM.\nPool the fractions of RCs with sufficient purity (i.e., A280:A804 ratio of <1.4, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Absorbance spectrum of pooled and concentrated elution fractions after purification by anion exchange chromatography\nFractions collected from the column are analyzed for the presence of RCs (A804 >0.015 AU) and for protein purity (A280:A804 <1.4).\nProceed to step 17 to buffer exchange the RCs into PBS pH 7.2.\nNote: RC concentrations can be calculated by using the Beer-Lambert law, given the extinction coefficient (ε804 nm = 288 mM−1-cm−1) for the RC (Straley et al., 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) and the absorbance value at 804 nm corresponding to the accessory bacteriochlorophylls. For example, if A804 = 0.288, then the [RC] = 0.288 / 288 mM−1-cm−1 / 1 cm = 1 μM.\nCritical: Monitor for changes in the absorbance spectrum of the RC, which may indicate loss of structural integrity. For example, a decrease in the 804 nm peak and a concomitant increase in the 760 nm peak indicates that the RCs are degrading (Hughes et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPreparation of gold flag electrodes for RC and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) deposition\nTiming: 30–45 min\nIn this step, gold flag electrodes are cleaned electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a potentiostat.\nRinse a glass electrochemical cell with ddH2O followed by 100 mM KOH. Fill the cell with 100 mM KOH such that the gold electrode is fully immersed.\nNote: Ensure the electrochemical cell has been cleaned previously in a hot acid bath (1:1 ratio (v/v) of H2SO4:HNO3) and rinsed thoroughly in pure water (>18 MΩ-cm).\nGently bubble the electrolyte with argon gas to remove dissolved oxygen.",
    "Once degassed, connect the gold electrode to the working electrode lead from the potentiostat. Similarly, connect a flamed annealed platinum electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode rinsed in ddH2O to the counter and reference electrode leads, respectively. Ensure that the electrodes are fully submerged in the electrolyte.\nSet up a CV with the following parameters:\nScan rate: 25 mV/s\nLower vertex: −1.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl\nUpper vertex: +0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl\nCycles: 15\nNote: Cleaning is considered complete once the CV has reached an equilibrium and displays features that are consistent with gold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. CVs of gold flag electrodes are measured in 0.1 M KOH at 25 mV/s of a cleaned gold electrode (blue) and an RC- and MCH-covered electrode (orange)\nThe well-defined oxidation peak for the cleaned gold electrode at +0.3 V is an indication that the surface is free from contaminants.\nRinse the gold electrode with ddH2O and remove from the holder and using tweezers to hold the gold stem, flame anneal (heat in a butane flame until the gold electrode is dark orange in colour).\nCritical: Careful that the gold does not overheat and melt.\nPause point: The cleaned electrode can be stored in a clean and sealed container, in a position such that the surface is not in contact with the sides.\nDeposition of RC and MCH on gold electrodes\nTiming: 1 h to 2 days\nIn this step, RCs purified from previous steps are deposited onto gold electrodes. This procedure applies to both the gold flag electrodes for photocurrent measurements and single crystal gold bead electrodes for AFM imaging. MCH is used to displace multilayers and non-specifically adsorbed RCs. Varying the MCH incubation time period controls the formation of different RC structural assemblies.",
    "Fully submerge a cleaned gold electrode in 100 μL of an RC solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube of the desired concentration (e.g., 0.5–10 μM). Incubate for the desired period of time (e.g., 10 min to 24 h) in the dark at 4°C.\nRinse the electrode to remove excess RCs by gently dipping in PBS.\nCritical: Be cautious to not aggressively agitate or contact the sides of the container while rinsing.\nFully submerge an RC-deposited gold electrode in 100 μL of a 100 μM MCH solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate for the desired period of time (e.g., 1–24 h) in the dark at 4°C.\nCritical: MCH will adsorb to many things. Take caution to avoid contaminating other experiments.\nRinse the electrode by gently dipping in PBS. The electrode should be used immediately.\nCritical: As formation of well-defined structural assemblies of RCs is the purpose of the experiment, the variables here control the structures. For example, the incubation time and concentration of RCs control how much protein material is initially bound to the electrode surface. The incubation time and concentration of MCH control how much protein material is displaced – non-specifically bound proteins are removed preferentially over those bound covalently.\nMeasuring photocurrents from RCs\nTiming: 6–8 h\nIn this step, the gold flag electrodes with RCs and MCH deposited on the surface are tested to measure the generation of photocurrents under an intensity-modulated illumination from an LED light source.\nNote: This step is based on a previous protocol (Jun et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).",
    "Set up an electrochemical cell with 2 mL of PBS in a cuvette (plastic or glass). Insert the gold working electrode (from the previous step), platinum counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Connect the electrodes to a potentiostat. See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] for an example of the equipment setup.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. A schematic of the spectroelectrochemical cell\nThe cell is constructed in a plastic cuvette with the gold flag electrode oriented perpendicular to the LED positions, which are indicated by the holes in the bottom piece into which the cuvette is placed during measurements.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Example of the equipment setup for photocurrent measurements using a modulated light intensity LED, lock-in amplifier, linear potential sweep generator, and potentiostat\nAdd an aliquot of 1 M hydroquinone (in DMSO), the sacrificial electron donor, to achieve the desired final concentration (e.g., 1–20 mM).\nRun a CV as follows:\nScan rate: 2 mV/s\nNote: Not all potentiostats can scan at such low rates. We find that faster CV scan rates do not allow the use of low pass filters on the lock-in amplifier, resulting in large noise in the photocurrent signals.\nUpper voltage: 0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl\nLower voltage: −0.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl\n2 scans\nNote: Ensure that the currents measured are small (i.e., <10 μA/cm2). This indicates that the MCH layer is effectively blocking faradaic reactions that occur on bare gold or through the MCH layer. While larger faradaic currents can be tolerated, we obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio of the photocurrents by minimizing the faradaic reactions at the electrode surface.\nNote: The photocurrents are measured at the same time as the faradaic current. The lock-in amplifier extracts the photocurrents from the total current (faradaic and photocurrent).",
    "Apply a 13 Hz sine wave to the LEDs (to illuminate the front and back of the gold flag electrode).\nEnsure that the amplitude of the sine wave (center-to-peak) does not exceed the offset current to make sure that the sine wave applied to the LEDs is not clipped. For example, in this work, the LEDs had a 40-mA offset and a 70-mA peak-to-peak current.\nNote: The sine wave generated by the lock-in amplifier is used as the input to the LED driver and subsequently converted to a current (100 mA/V, e.g., 70 mA peak-to-peak current). This signal is added to the constant current set on the LED driver (e.g., 40 mA offset).\nAdjust the amplification settings on the lock-in amplifier to increase the signal to a measurable level at the lock-in amplifier outputs. This is a heuristic approach to find the right settings. Set the lock-in amplifier filters at 24 dB roll-off and time constant of 1 or 3 s. Ensure the lock-in is measuring the amplitude (if using a dual-phase lock-in amplifier like the SR830, a non-zero amplitude should be accompanied by a relatively steady phase signal,).\nThe demodulated signal amplitude output from the lock-in amplifier is connected to the auxiliary input on the potentiostat.\nNote: Ensure that the total current and the amplitude of the photocurrent are measured at the same time.\nNote: The total current from the potentiostat is output as a voltage (converted at a value determined by the settings on the potentiostat, e.g., 1 mA/V) and passed into the input of the lock-in amplifier. Adjust the conversion to ensure the input to the lock-in amplifier is not too large, otherwise an input overload will occur.",
    "The photocurrent magnitude is determined by using the potentiostat setting for the current (e.g., 1 mA/V) and the amplification setting of the lock-in amplifier (e.g., 10 μV/V). For example, using the previously mentioned settings, if the photocurrent amplitude from the lock-in amplifier is 2 V, then this would correspond to a photocurrent of 2 V × 10 μV/V × 1 mA/V = 20 nA.\nCritical: Care must be taken to ensure the setting are accurate, as some instruments output a 10 V full scale signal for the setting on the front panel. Make sure to read the manual to be sure of the conversion factor.\nBegin the photocurrent measurements at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. After a stable photocurrent signal is obtained (approximately 15 s at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), scan the potential slowly to +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl and then to −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl (repeatedly) at 2 mV/s. Record the potential, total current, and amplitude from the lock-in-amplifier every 0.1 s.\nDC photocurrents are measured at the open circuit potential (OCP) of the electrochemical cell. Monitor the potential in the dark (LEDs off) until stabilized (approximately 2 min).\nApply the OCP and continuously measure the current. Monitor the change in the current as the LEDs are cycled on and off (approximately 10–30 s) using a constant current (i.e., sine wave is not used here).\nNote: Since the photocurrents are very small (on the order of nA), the OCP should be adjusted and optimized to ensure the smallest current possible, which would be achieved once the potential is set to a value where no net current flows (i.e., the net rate of HQ redox is zero).\nPreparation of a single crystal gold electrode for AFM imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "In this step, a single crystal gold electrode is prepared and cleaned.\nCut approximately 1.5 cm of gold wire (1 mm in diameter) and secure to a holder using additional gold wire and glass tubing.\nRinse the gold wire with ddH2O thoroughly. Immerse the wire in a solution of aqua regia (1:3 ratio (v/v) of HNO3:HCl) for 10 min. Rinse with ddH2O again.\nFlame the gold wire until the tip of the wire melts. Stop melting when the bead climbs slightly up the wire.\nNote: When the wire begins to melt, it turns from a bright yellow colour to bright orange. Stop melting when a very small bead can be observed moving up the wire.\nRinse the gold wire with ddH2O thoroughly. Immerse the wire in a solution of aqua regia for 10 min. Rinse with ddH2O again.\nRepeat the previous two steps until the bead reaches approximately 2–3 mm in diameter.\nAfter immersion in aqua regia, the etching pattern is examined under a microscope to look for a highly symmetrical pattern that corresponds to the crystallography. Once the surface of the bead has a symmetric etch pattern and does not have any grain boundaries (these show up clearly as dark lines in the microscope images of the electrode), melt the electrode for the final time to smooth out the surface.\nAlternative: Check for the presence of a large flat reflective region on the surface – this is the 111 facet. Repeat the melting and cooling until this region is large enough to place the AFM tip on it (approximately 0.1 mm in diameter). For AFM measurements, the need for a single crystal bead electrode is not critical, just the presence of large 111 facets.",
    "Critical: Once the highly symmetric pattern is achieved on the surface without evidence of grain boundaries, when remelting the electrode, do not let the molten gold go past the top of the bead (i.e., stop melting before it reaches the stem). If the flame is not withdrawn in time, there is a high chance the single crystal pattern will not be retained. Such an electrode will most likely not regain its single crystal character.\nAssemble a glass electrochemical cell for cleaning the electrode surface using a 0.1 M solution of NaOH and purged with argon. Connect the single crystal gold electrode to the working electrode lead from the potentiostat. Similarly, connect a flamed annealed platinum electrode and rinsed saturated calomel reference electrode to the counter and reference electrode leads, respectively.\nNote: Ensure the electrochemical cell has been cleaned previously in a hot acid bath of H2SO4 and HNO3.\nSet up a CV with the following parameters:\nScan rate: 50 mV/s\nLower vertex: −1.4 V vs. SCE\nUpper vertex: +0.6 V vs. SCE\nCycles: 30\nNote: Cleaning is considered complete once the CV has reached an equilibrium and displays features that are consistent with gold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nRinse the gold electrode with ddH2O and flame anneal.\nCritical: Careful that the gold does not overheat and melt.\nThe clean single crystal gold bead electrode can now be used for the deposition of RCs as previously described in the section deposition of RC and MCH on gold electrodes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] for future AFM imaging.\nPause point: The cleaned electrode can be stored in a clean, sealed container such that the surface is not in contact with the sides.\nAFM imaging of a single crystal gold electrode\nTiming: 1–2 h (setup: steps 50–56); 8–24 h (imaging: step 57)",
    "This step outlines the procedure to image a 111 facet on a single crystal gold bead electrode.\nRinse the single crystal gold bead electrode with PBS for 10 s. Rinse with ddH2O for 30 s to remove residual salt. Dry under a stream of argon.\nMount the electrode on the AFM stage and transfer to an optical microscope to coarsely align the 111 facet horizontally (i.e., parallel to AFM stage that has been pre-aligned to be perpendicular to laser beam).\nNote: The 111 facet is a darker circle or an oval spot on the electrode (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). It can be distinguished from the rest of the surface as it appears more matte. The rest of electrode surface is lustrous like a mirror, whereas the 111 facet is not, since it tends to reflect light in a direction away from the viewer and so appearing as though it was matte when viewed under the microscope and illuminated from the sides of the electrode.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Optical microscope image of the whole gold bead electrode without white light illumination\nThe oval matte regions represent the 111 surfaces (black circles). The scale bar is 0.5 mm in length.\nNote: Do not illuminate the electrode with white light directly, as the reflection from the 111 facet will make it hard to visualize.\nIlluminate the electrode surface in the AFM holder with the output from a columnated laser diode. The resulting reflection off the 111 facet is directed onto the surface of paper and will be visible as an intense circular reflection pattern.\nNote: Take care to wear appropriate laser safety glasses, as the reflection from the bead can be difficult to control.",
    "By moving the bead using tweezers, align the reflected beam with the path of the incident light, resulting in a 0° angle between the incident and reflected beams. This ensures that the 111 facet of the electrode is aligned horizontally for optimal AFM imaging conditions. The electrode is now finely aligned with the AFM sample holder. This procedure does not eliminate sample tilt as the AFM tip/cantilever may not always be parallel to the AFM sample holder.\nNote: The alignment does not have to be exactly 0°. Some tolerance is acceptable as the tilt can be corrected during image processing.\nTransfer the finely aligned electrode on the AFM sample holder to the AFM microscope. The 111 facet is found as a bright oval spot, when illuminated with white light in the AFM (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Optical microscope image of the 111 facet on the gold bead surface illuminated with white light\nThe oval spot represents the 111 surface with an AFM cantilever hovering above the surface. The scale bar is 0.5 mm in length.\nNote: The best spot for imaging is the center of the 111 facet, as it has the flattest surface. Avoid imaging on the edge of the facet as multiple atom high steps are present.\nNote: The suggested cantilever for imaging is one with a nominal resonance frequency of 150 kHz and a spring constant of 5 N-m.\nApproach the tip to the surface as usual. Perform a force curve measurement using tapping mode to ensure good contact with the surface and to determine the surface quality. The force curve should consist of clean approach and withdraw lines with relatively small hysteresis (i.e., no cusps or steps on the vertical part) (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig10.jpg",
    "Figure 10. The approach curve represents the forces acting on the AFM tip\nThe red and blue traces represent the approach of the tip to the surface and withdrawal, respectively. The green box illustrates the optimal range for the setpoint to be selected before the scan begins.\nNote: Cusps on the vertical part, may indicate adherence of contaminants to the tip from the surface.\nManually set the optimum setpoint at approximately 80%–90% of the value between surface and the approach cusp (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10], green box).\nScan at a frequency of 0.14 lines/sec, sampling 4096 lines per image.\nRepeat as necessary. Scans can be completed overnight.\nProcessing of a raw AFM image\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step outlines the procedure to process AFM images using Gwyddion, an open-source software available for all major operating systems. The following steps correct for the background and tilt of the AFM images taken from the 111 facet.\nEven after aligning the surface using steps 52 and 53, the AFM image will still be tilted. Removing this planar background or tilt from the image is performed using the “Remove Polynomial Background” method.",
    "Optimal results are obtained by trial-and-error, but some simple guidelines are provided to ensure that the flattening does not introduce artifacts. Correction for the background is accomplished by fitting a polynomial to the whole image in both the X and Y dimensions. The choice of the polynomial is never usually above 3rd order. As shown in Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11], 1st order correction removes the tilt, but low frequency waves are still present. This can be corrected using the “Align Rows” option to align the rows of lines that are out of the average plane (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). The RMS roughness can be monitored, using the “Statistical Quantities”, method to evaluate the flattening process. As shown in Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], the RMS height stays constant after 2nd order background correction and performing “Align Rows” function. This characteristic is a reasonable metric to limit background correction to where it no longer affects the RMS roughness values (shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Example of the AFM flattening procedure\nThe scale bar is 3 μm in length.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1300_8.csv\nPerform a particle analysis (size, height) after obtaining a flattened image.\nSet a threshold of 1 nm and create a mask. Erode the mask twice and dilate once to facilitate watershed separation of the particles. Watershed the resulting image to delineate or separate the particles. Convolution with the tip limits the accuracy of particle footprint estimates; therefore, accurate watershed is considered to be more important than accurate particle footprint determination.\nNote: The mask is used to analyse the AFM image by restricting the particles to be >3 pixels in area and exclude any particles on the edge of the image.\nCreate a histogram of the maximum height and the distribution of the footprint area for each particle."
