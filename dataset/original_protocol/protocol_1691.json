    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, all steps should be performed at a temperature between 20 and 25°C.\nExtraction of Genomic DNA from Budding Yeast\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the extraction of genomic DNA from budding yeast cells using a gentle lysis method based on spheroplasting in order to avoid as much as possible introducing additional nicks into the DNA.\nCritical: In order to maintain spheroplasts intact, do not freeze the cells prior to lysis.\nAlternatives: This protocol is recommended for preparing genomic DNA for detection of strand breaks caused inside cells, as it minimizes the introduction of additional nicks and breaks during the extraction procedure. If a low background of nicks is unproblematic (for example when detecting base modifications not involving strand breaks) or if starting from frozen cells, any other method for the isolation of genomic DNA can be used alternatively.\nHarvest ca. 6×109 cells (300 OD600):\nCentrifuge the yeast culture in a 50 mL tube at 2,000×g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 25 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5.\nCentrifuge again as before and discard the supernatant.\nPrepare spheroplasts:\nResuspend the cells in 4 mL of Y1 buffer.\nAdd 400 μL of Zymolyase 20T solution and incubate at 30°C.\nNote: Spheroplast formation takes ~60–90 min. Its efficiency is monitored by adding 2 μL of 1% SDS to 2 μL of cell suspension on a microscope slide and observing the decrease in the number of intact cells under a stereomicroscope. Samples not treated with SDS can be used as a control. Efficient spheroplasting should result in close to 100% lysis within 2 min of incubation with SDS.\nLyse the spheroplasts:\nPellet the spheroplasts at 2,000×g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "Carefully resuspend the pellet in 4 mL of Y1 buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol, centrifuge as before and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 4.75 mL of yeast lysis buffer.\nInitiate lysis by adding 250 μL of 20% SDS and incubate at 37°C until the solution turns transparent.\nNote: This should normally take about 45 min.\nClear the solution of debris by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 10 min and transfer the supernatant (by pouring) to a fresh 50 mL tube.\nNote: Repeat this step if the supernatant is not cleared of debris.\nAdd 1.666 mL of 5 M potassium acetate, invert the tube to mix and incubate on ice for 45–60 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 17,000×g for 15 min, transfer the supernatant (by pouring) to a fresh 50 mL tube and centrifuge again at 17,000×g for 15 min.\nNote: When handling more than 4 samples, pellets may detach from the wall of the tube over time. In this case, repeat the centrifugation to clear the supernatant of any visible debris.\nPrecipitate the DNA by transferring the supernatant to a fresh 50 mL tube, adding 19.5 mL of 100% ethanol and swirling the tube.\nCollect the precipitated DNA by centrifugation at 8,000×g for 15 min and discard the supernatant.\nRinse the pellet by adding 25 mL of 70% ethanol and centrifuging again at 8,000×g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 4 mL of 70% ethanol to the pellet and distribute the suspension into two 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: Use a wide-bore pipette tip (prepare for example by cutting the tip off a 1 mL pipette tip), pipet slowly and gently and limit the pipetting as much as possible to avoid shearing the DNA while still ensuring complete resuspension.",
    "Note: If the DNA pellet does not resuspend well, it can be incubated in the 50 mL tube for 12–16 h and split into two 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes the next day before proceeding to the next step. This will add one day to the timing of the experiment.\nNote: After splitting the original sample into two tubes, each of these is treated separately and in parallel. Hence, each sample of yeast cells eventually gives rise to two identical samples of genomic DNA. Alternatively, the initial steps can be scaled down to prepare a single sample of DNA.\nCollect the precipitated DNA by centrifugation at 21,100×g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nAir-dry the pellets and gently resuspend in 245 μL of TE each by incubation at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nOn the next day, add 5 μL of 5 M NaCl and 2.5 μL of RNase A to each DNA sample and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nPrecipitate the DNA again:\nAdd 1.5 mL of 100% ethanol to each tube and invert to mix.\nCentrifuge at 21,100×g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nRinse the pellets once with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.\nAir-dry the pellets and resuspend at 4°C by gentle rocking in 250 μL of 10 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.5 for 12–16 h.\nOn the next day, prepare AMPure beads for capturing of the DNA:\nAdd 250 μL AMPure beads to a fresh 1.5 mL DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tube.\nUse a magnetic rack to remove 125 μL of the storage buffer.\nAdd the DNA sample (250 μL) to the bead suspension and incubate for 10 min.\nUsing a magnetic rack, remove and discard the supernatant.",
    "While keeping the tube on the magnetic rack, rinse the beads twice with 500 μL of 70% ethanol each.\nRemove the supernatant and add 125 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5.\nElute the DNA by incubating for 10 min and collecting the supernatant using a magnetic rack.\nNote: A minimum of 10 μg genomic DNA should be recovered at this stage. Typical yields are higher (ca. 25–50 μg).\nPause Point: At this point, the extracted genomic DNA can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nCritical: Storage at 4°C rather than -20°C is recommended because freezing can introduce strand breaks.\nNote: When mapping base lesions or modifications rather than strand breaks, additional treatments (followed by renewed purification using AMPure beads) are applied at this stage to generate the corresponding 3′-OH termini, e.g.:\nabasic (AP) sites: AP endonuclease (APE1) (Sriramachandran et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\npyrimidine dimers: T4 Endonuclease V + APE1 (Sriramachandran et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\nmethylated purines: N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (AAG/MPG) + APE1 (Sriramachandran et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\nribonucleotides: RNase H (Ding et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nDenaturation of Genomic DNA and Ligation of 3′-OH Termini (Yeast)\nTiming: 3.5–4 h\nThis section describes the heat denaturation of the purified genomic DNA and the subsequent capture of the exposed 3′-OH termini by ligation to a biotinylated oligonucleotide.\nNote: The protocol can be applied to DNA preparations from any source, provided that they are available as a solution. For treatment of DNA embedded in agarose plugs, please refer to the protocol for mammalian DNA below.\nDenature the purified genomic DNA:\nIncubate 2.5 μg of genomic DNA at 95°C for 10 min.\nIncubate the suspension on slushy ice for 5 min.\nPerform the ligation reaction to capture free 3′-OH termini:\nSet up the ligation reaction in a PCR tube as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_126_6.csv",
    "ddH2O up to a total volume of 65 μL.\nIncubate the reaction in a thermocycler, using the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_126_7.csv\nNote: The amount of adaptor required for the ligation can be calculated based on the approximate number of nicks expected in 2.5 μg of genomic DNA. A five-fold molar excess of adaptor should then be used. If the expected number of breaks is unknown, use 3.55 μL (resulting in a final concentration of 2.185 μM). Incomplete removal of unligated adaptor can cause various problems during subsequent steps of the protocol, especially when processing native, undigested DNA exhibiting very few breaks. These will become apparent in steps 37, 39 and/or 49 (see Troubleshooting). If the problems cannot be overcome by the measures described in the Troubleshooting section, the ligation reaction would need to be repeated with a reduced amount of adaptor. The appropriate amount will have to be determined empirically in this case.\nPrepare fresh AMPure beads by adding 100 μL of AMPure bead suspension to a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tube and removing the storage buffer, using a magnetic rack.\nAdd 35 μL of 5 M NaCl and 35 μL of ddH2O to the ligation mix and transfer the entire mix to the tube containing the AMPure beads.\nAllow the DNA to bind to the beads by incubation for 5 min. Using a magnetic rack, remove the supernatant from the beads and rinse the beads twice with 500 μL of 70% ethanol while keeping the tube on the rack.\nElute the DNA from the beads by adding 103 μL of ddH2O and incubation for 5 min. Transfer 100 μL to a fresh tube, using a magnetic rack.\nPause Point: At this point, the ligated DNA fragments can be stored at -20°C for up to 3 days.",
    "Note: This protocol continues with step 29 below.\nExtraction of Genomic DNA from Mammalian Cultured Cells\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the extraction of genomic DNA from mammalian cultured cells embedded in agarose plugs in order to avoid as much as possible introducing additional nicks into the DNA.\nAlternatives: This protocol is recommended for preparing genomic DNA for detection of strand breaks caused inside cells, as it minimizes the introduction of additional nicks and breaks during the extraction procedure. If a low background of nicks is unproblematic (for example when detecting base modifications not involving strand breaks) or if starting from frozen cells or tissues, any other method for the isolation of genomic DNA can be used alternatively.\nHarvest up to ~107 cells by trypsinization.\nNote: Using fewer cells is unproblematic, and the protocol can be scaled down considerably when only preparing a single plug.\nWash the cells twice in 25–50 mL of ice-cold PBS + 5 mM EDTA.\nLyse the cells by resuspending them in 1 mL of nuclear isolation buffer and incubating them on ice for 10 min to dissolve the plasma membrane.\nHarvest the nuclei:\nCentrifuge in a swing-out rotor at 1,200×g for 3 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet once by resuspension in 1 mL of nuclear isolation buffer and centrifugation as before. Discard the supernatant.\nCritical: Loosen the pellet by inversion or tapping of the tube, rather than pipetting.\nMix the nuclei with nuclear isolation buffer supplemented with RNase A at a final concentration of 100 μg μL-1 at a ratio of 100 μL of buffer per 20 μL of nuclear pellet and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nCount the nuclei with a hemocytometer in the presence of Trypan blue at a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v).",
    "Note: We do not recommend the use of automated cell counters because they do not produce reliable results for this type of analysis.\nTo prepare agarose plugs, harvest the desired number of nuclei (~700,000 per plug) by centrifugation in a swing-out rotor at 1,200×g for 3 min.\nNote: The number of nuclei used at this step is flexible and can be increased up to a packed volume of ~20 μL per plug.\nRemove all but ~10 μL of supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet of nuclei.\nPrepare prewarmed solutions for agarose embedding of nuclei:\nPrewarm PBS + 25 mM EDTA to 50°C.\nMelt an aliquot of 1.2% (w/v) low-melting point agarose in PBS + 25 mM EDTA at 95°C for 5 min and then let it equilibrate to 50°C for 15 min.\nEmbed the nuclei in agarose:\nResuspend the nuclei (by tapping) at a density of about 700,000 nuclei per 22.5 μL of suspension in the prewarmed PBS + 25 mM EDTA solution.\nMix the suspension 1:1 (v/v) with the molten agarose solution.\nImmediately pipette the cell-agarose mixture into the wells of a 45 μL plug mold (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: Since the precision of 3D printing can be inconsistent, it is important to check before use whether the wells of the agarose casting mold properly fit the dedicated extrusion tool. Use only those wells that snugly fit the tool.\nAllow the agarose to solidify for 1 h at 4°C.\nCombine the plugs into 12 mL tubes filled with 7–8 mL of Proteinase K solution (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) and incubate for 24 h at 42°C.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. How to Cast Agarose Plugs (Illustrating Step 10 of the Mammalian Protocol)",
    "Critical: Only combine plugs corresponding to the same DNA sample, and do not combine more than 3 plugs per tube. Handle them gently as shown in Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], as they are extremely fragile.\nOn the next day, exchange the Proteinase K solution for a fresh aliquot of 7–8 mL and perform a second incubation at 42°C for 12–16 h (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S2. How to Extrude Agarose Plugs from a Casting Mold (Illustrating Step 12 of the Mammalian Protocol)\nCritical: In order to avoid losing the plugs during buffer exchange, let them settle to the bottom of the tube and quickly decant as much of the liquid as possible by tipping the tube while holding a wide spatula tightly to it as shown in Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]. Pouring out the buffer through a sieve, e.g a cell strainer, can also be useful.\nOn the next day, wash the plugs three times with 7–8 mL of plug wash buffer + 1 mM PMSF for 10 min each.\nWash the plugs once with 7–8 mL of plug wash buffer + 1 mM PMSF for 1 h.\nWash the plugs once with 7–8 mL of plug wash buffer for 1 h.\nTransfer each plug to a separate 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube.\nWash each plug twice with 1 mL of TE0.1.\nWash each plug once with 1 mL of TE0.1 for 30 min.\nWash each plug twice with 1 mL of EDTA0.1 for 15 min each.\nBriefly rinse the plugs with ddH2O and remove as much residual liquid as possible (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3. How to Wash Agarose Plugs (Illustrating Step 13 of the Mammalian Protocol)",
    "Pause Point: At this point, the plugs can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 days.\nNote: When mapping base lesions or modifications rather than strand breaks, additional treatments are applied at this stage, i.e. while the DNA is embedded in the agarose plugs, to generate the corresponding 3′-OH termini, e.g.:\nabasic (AP) sites: AP endonuclease (APE1)\npyrimidine dimers: T4 Endonuclease V + APE1\nmethylated purines: N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (AAG/MPG) + APE1\nribonucleotides: RNase H\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S4. How to Prepare Agarose Plugs for the Ligation Reaction (Illustrating Step 21 of the Mammalian Protocol)\nInactivation of the enzymes after this step could be accomplished by heat denaturation in the presence of EDTA or by Proteinase K treatment.\nDenaturation of Genomic DNA and Ligation of 3′-OH Termini (Mammalian Cells)\nTiming: 30 min (day 1) and 3.5–4.5 h (day 2)\nThis section describes the heat denaturation of the agarose-embedded DNA and the subsequent capture of the exposed 3′-OH termini by ligation to a biotinylated oligonucleotide.\nDenature the DNA:\nIncubate the tubes containing the agarose plugs at 95°C for 4 min.\nIncubate the suspension on slushy ice for 5 min.\nMelt the agarose again at 65°C for 5 min and equilibrate to 37°C for 15 min. At the end of this incubation, spin the tube briefly to collect any condensate that may have collected in the lid.\nIn the meantime, prepare a ligation mix:\nCombine the following reagents per sample:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_126_8.csv\nPre-warm the ligation mix to 37°C.",
    "Note: Typically, three plugs are generated for each preparation of genomic DNA. A master mix for several plugs can be made at this step. The ligase is then added separately to each tube at the beginning of the next step to avoid leaving it at 37°C for too long.\nSet up the ligation reaction:\nAdd 3 μL of T4 DNA ligase to the prewarmed ligation mix.\nThoroughly mix the agarose, by tapping, with 20 μL of the prewarmed ligation mix now containing the ligase.\nIncubate the reaction at 16°C for 12–16 h.\nOn the next day, incubate the mixture at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate the ligase and melt the agarose.\nAllow the solution to equilibrate to 42°C for 20 min, supplement with 3 μL of β-agarase and incubate at 42°C for 3–4 h.\nAdjust the sample volume to 100 μL with ddH2O and transfer to a 0.5 mL Bioruptor tube.\nFragmentation and Capture of Biotinylated Single-Stranded (ss)DNA\nTiming: 2 h (excluding quality control)\nThis section describes the fragmentation of the purified genomic DNA and the isolation of the ligated fragments by capture on streptavidin beads.\nNote: From this point onwards, the protocol is identical for yeast and mammalian DNA, independent of whether the ligation was performed in solution or in agarose plugs.\nSonicate the eluate from step 28 (100 μL) to a fragment size of 200 nt, using a Bioruptor Pico.\nNote: Make sure the Bioruptor Pico is cooled to 4°C before sonication. Incubation of the purified samples on ice is not required. The number of cycles (30 s on / 30 s off) depends on the size of the genomic DNA. As a guide, use 4 cycles for yeast or 16 cycles for mammalian DNA.",
    "Critical: Make sure fragmentation yields a fragment size range of 150–450 nt, with an average size of 300 nt. This is best verified by analyzing a 1 μL aliquot of the fragmented DNA either on an Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent 2200 Tapestation) or an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (using an RNA chip). A somewhat broader size distribution is not detrimental, but fragments should not be smaller than 150 bp as these will be depleted in the course of purification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/126-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

The sample sonicated for 4 cycles shows an appropriate size distribution. The low molecular weight marker band is situated at 25 nt.\nClean up the DNA by two rounds of binding to an equivalent of 100 μL of AMPure beads and elution in 100 μL of ddH2O:\nPrepare AMPure beads by adding 100 μL of AMPure bead suspension to a fresh 1.5 mL DNA LoBind microcentrifuge tube and removing the storage buffer, using a magnetic rack.\nAdd NaCl and PEG 8000 to each sample of sonicated DNA at final concentrations of 0.9 M and 7.5% (w/v), respectively (i.e. add 27 μL of 5 M NaCl and 22.5 μL of PEG 8000 solution to a 100 μL sample).\nAllow the DNA to bind to the beads by incubation for 5 min.\nUsing a magnetic rack, remove the supernatant from the beads and rinse the beads twice with 500 μL of 70% ethanol while keeping the tube on the rack.",

Discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads twice with 50 μL of 1× SSC buffer each for 5 min on a rotating wheel.\nNote: This step serves to remove unligated fragments of genomic DNA. When processing more than 5 samples in parallel, reduce the incubation time to 2.5 min to account for the increased processing time due to buffer addition and resuspension of the samples.\nWash the beads once with 25 μL of 20 mM NaOH for 10 min on a rotating wheel.\nNote: This step serves to remove the splinter oligo by alkaline denaturation.\nWash the beads briefly with 100 μL ddH2O.\nElute the DNA by adding 16 μL of ddH2O, incubating at 95°C for 5 to 10 min and collecting the supernatant using the magnetic rack.\nNote: Incubating the samples for 10 min does not affect the subsequent steps.",
    "Critical: Failure to remove unligated adaptors is one of the major sources of poor library quality. It is therefore recommended to verify efficient capture of biotinylated DNA and removal of unligated adaptor by analyzing a 1 μL aliquot of the eluted DNA either on an Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent 2200 Tapestation) or an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (using an RNA chip). The size range of the fragments should reflect the addition of the biotinylated adaptor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/126-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: If a sample is expected to contain few nicks, the sample volume can be increased to 50 μL by addition of ddH2O after completion of the reaction, and 90 μL of AMPure beads should then be used for purification.

    "Using a magnetic rack, remove the supernatant from the beads.\nRinse the beads twice with 500 μL of 70% ethanol while keeping the tube on the rack.\nElute the DNA from the beads by adding 25 μL of ddH2O and incubating for 5 min, then transfer the eluate to a fresh tube, using the magnetic rack.\nRepeat the purification via AMPure beads, this time eluting in 20 μL of ddH2O.\nNote: While removing the eluate, collect only 18 μL and pipette very slowly to avoid transferring any beads along with the supernatant.\nCritical: In order to ensure that the distal adaptor has been efficiently ligated (i.e. the DNA is in a size range of approximately 250–530 bp) and the sample is free of unligated adaptors or adaptor concatemers, analyze a 1 μL aliquot of the purified PCR product on an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent 2100 Bionanalyzer) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/126-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Quality Control for Efficient Amplification of the Library\nThe electropherogram shows GLOE-Seq libraries of high (top) and low (bottom) quality, analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit. (AD: adaptor dimers; LM: lower marker; UM: upper marker). Note that the size range of the libraries shown here slightly exceeds the recommended value; however, a deviation of this magnitude is uncritical.\nDetermine the concentration of the library sample using a Qubit fluorometer and reagents for quantifying dsDNA and prepare a sample pool with a total concentration of 4 nM for loading onto the sequencer.\nSequencing and Demultiplexing\nTiming: 12 h\nThis section describes the settings for sequencing GLOE-Seq libraries on the Illumina platform and the subsequent demultiplexing step that generates the input for the GLOE-Pipe routine.",
    "Sequencing of GLOE-Seq libraries is carried out on an Illumina next-generation sequencer (e.g. NextSeq 500) with settings for single-ended 75 nt reads. For single indexed libraries use 7 nt indices; for dual indexed libraries use 8 + 8 nt indices.\nNote: The necessary sequencing depth will depend on the genome size of the organism from which the samples are derived and on the purpose of the experiment. We aim to retrieve at least 3 million reads for yeast and at least 50 million reads for mammalian GLOE-seq libraries. We typically load a NextSeq 500 flow cell with 1.4 pM of a denatured library that includes 5% PhiX Control, as described in the NextSeq System Denature and Dilute Libraries Guide (https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/ogc/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nextseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15048776-02.pdf[href=https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/ogc/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nextseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15048776-02.pdf]).\nUpon completion of the run, perform demultiplexing with bcl2fastq and the relevant indices to generate FASTQ files for each library. These files will be used as input for subsequent data processing.\nData Processing Using GLOE-Pipe\nTiming: variable (typically up to 1 day for human samples, depending on the specific workstation used for the analysis and the size of the libraries; ~3 min for the test dataset provided on GitHub)\nThis section describes a step-by-step walkthrough of GLOE-Pipe, an analysis pipeline that contains a set of modules for processing raw sequencing data and generating output files to detect, annotate, and visualize strand breaks or modified bases. In its default indirect mode, it identifies the position immediately upstream of a corresponding 3′-OH terminus. This mode should be used when analyzing strand breaks. Alternatively, in its direct mode it identifies the nucleotide immediately downstream of a 3′-OH terminus. This mode should be used when mapping the positions of modified bases by means of treatment with a nuclease that cleaves 5′ to the affected nucleotide.",
    "The pipeline is compatible with GLOE-Seq reads and can be accessed at https://github.com/helle-ulrich-lab/ngs-gloepipe[href=https://github.com/helle-ulrich-lab/ngs-gloepipe]. It is designed to run in a high-performance cluster environment with a Linux distribution, Bpipe (Sadedin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) (version 0.9.9.3) as the domain specific language, and Lmod (https://lmod.readthedocs.io[href=https://lmod.readthedocs.io/]) (version 6.6) as the module system. In addition, GLOE-Pipe requires a set of additional software dependencies listed in the Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] that also need to be installed to run GLOE-Pipe successfully:\nThe gloeseq.pipeline.groovy file contains the locations of the 12 modules included in GLOE-Pipe and how they are linked with each other in the direct and indirect modes.\nThe FastQC and Trimmomatic modules are used by GLOE-Pipe to first report the quality of the raw data and then filter and trim the reads based on quality and adaptor inclusion, respectively. The FastQC module is used again to report the quality of the data after the filtering step.\nThe bowtie2 and BAMindexer modules are used to map the reads to the reference genome, generate BAM (Binary Alignment Map) files and create the index file for each one of them.\nThe bam2bedD and bam2bedI modules convert the BAM files into BED (Browser Extensible Data) files for the direct and indirect modes, respectively. For the direct mode, each read represents one unit of signal that is positioned exactly at the 3′- terminal nucleotide of the original captured fragment. The indirect (default) mode positions the signal one nucleotide immediately upstream of the 5′-end of the original captured fragment, which corresponds to the nucleotide immediately 3′ of the break.",
    "The bedcoverage, bed2bw and rfd modules convert BED files into normalized, non- normalized and replication fork directionality BIGWIG (Big Wiggle) files, respectively. The replication fork directionality (RFD) index reflects the relative strand bias of the break signals and is calculated as follows: RFD = (REV − FWD)/(REV + FWD).\nThe macs2 module performs the breaks calling for the treatment sample by comparing the BED file for each strand to that of a control sample (for example, a digested sample to an undigested control).\nThe breaks_annotation and breaks_detected modules perform the annotation of detected breaks and check the overlap between the detected and expected breaks.\nFinally, the collectBpipeLogs module creates a copy of all log files generated by the previous modules into the logs directory (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/126-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Flowchart of GLOE-Pipe\nNote: For demonstration of the pipeline and testing purposes, a small test dataset can be found in the test_data directory. This directory contains seven FASTQ files and the corresponding configuration file (targets.txt) that is needed to collect the file names and define the sample comparisons used to detect the breaks.\nClone or download the pipeline in your project directory using the link reported on GitHub: $ git clone <git repository url>\n          <project_dir>/GLOEPipe\nMove the test dataset to the project directory and create symbolic links for the files that need to be edited: $ cd <project_dir> $ mv GLOEPipe/test_data . $ ln -s test_data/targets.txt . $ ln -s GLOEPipe/modules/GLOEseq/tool.locations.groovy . $ ln -s GLOEPipe/modules/GLOEseq/tool.versions.groovy . $ ln -s GLOEPipe/modules/GLOEseq/essential.vars.groovy . $ ln -s GLOEPipe/pipelines/GLOEseq/gloeseq.pipeline.groovy . $ ln -s GLOEPipe/pipelines/GLOEseq/bpipe.config .\nAlternatives: Instead of using symbolic links, you can copy the targets.txt file into the project folder and specify the full path for the gloeseq.pipeline.groovy file to run the analysis:\n$ cp test_data/targets.txt . $ bpipe run GLOEPipe/pipelines/GLOEseq/gloeseq.pipeline.groovy\n        test_data/∗.fastq.gz",
    "In this case, the other 5 files (steps 55–59) need to be edited directly in the pipelines and modules directories.\nSet the location and the version of the necessary tools in the tool.locations.groovy and tool.versions.groovy files, respectively. For example: tool.locations.groovy TOOL_DEPENDENCIES=\"/fsimb/common/tools\" // Add the path to the folder which contains all the tools used by GLOE-Pipe TOOL_TRIMMOMATIC=TOOL_DEPENDENCIES +\n          \"/trimmomatic/0.36/\" // Add the subfolder for Trimmomatic tool.versions.groovy TRIMMOMATIC_VERSION=\"0.36\" // Add the version of Trimmomatic that should be loaded (e.g. module load trimmomatic/0.36)\nEdit the essential.vars.groovy file to adapt it to your specific needs:\nEdit the file to include the full paths to:\nthe project directory (ESSENTIAL_PROJECT)\nthe adaptor FASTA file used by the trimmer (ESSENTIAL_TRIMMOMATIC)\nthe reference genome index files for Bowtie 2 (ESSENTIAL_BOWTIE_REF)\nthe reference genome chromosome sizes file (ESSENTIAL_BOWTIE_GENOME_INDEX). For example:\nESSENTIAL_TRIMMOMATIC=\"…/TruSeq3-SE.fa\" // Add the path to the adaptor FASTA file used by Trimmomatic\nIf running GLOE-Pipe on a dataset not derived from budding yeast, change the information regarding the reference genome and corresponding annotations in the following statements: // Annotation packages used by the R scripts ESSENTIAL_TXDB=\"TxDb.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3.sgdGene\" // http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/[href=http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/] - Annotation package for TxDb object(s) ESSENTIAL_ANNODB=\"org.Sc.sgd.db\" // http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/[href=http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/] - Genome wide annotation // Mappable genome size for MACS2 ESSENTIAL_MACS2_GSIZE=\"1.20E+07\" // https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html[href=https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html] // TSS region parameter from –200 bp to +200 bp ESSENTIAL_TSS=200\nNote: The annotation packages contain genomic locations of the transcript-related features (5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), protein coding sequences (CDSs) and exons) and genome-wide annotation databases (SYMBOL, GENENAME and ENSEMBL/ENTREZID) for the budding yeast genome (sacCer3).\nOptional: The user can include up to 3 BED files containing coordinates for the expected breaks. As a default and for the purpose of the test dataset, GLOE-Pipe will use the expected breaks for BsrDI, Nb.BsrDI and NotI:\nESSENTIAL_EB1=ESSENTIAL_PROJECT +",

For example:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_126_17.csv\nThe file is correctly set up for the test dataset. To run GLOE-Pipe on another dataset, the file names, sample names, and comparison name for the treatment and control samples (in the test dataset: BsrDI-digested versus undigested) need to be included in the targets.txt file.\nEdit the gloeseq.pipeline.groovy file to set GLOE-Pipe from the default indirect to the optional direct mode and adjust the set of individual modules as required. This is best done by commenting and uncommenting the relevant lines.\nIf needed, set the pipeline to direct mode: // MAIN PIPELINE TASK (DIRECT mode - optional) run {     \"%.fastq.gz\" ∗ [ FastQC,\n              Trimmomatic +   [ FastQC, bowtie2 + BAMindexer + bam2bedD +   [ bedcoverage, bed2bw + rfd ] + macs2 ] ] +   [ breaks_annotation, breaks_detected ] +\n              collectBpipeLogs }\nRemove unnecessary modules, for example: // Portion of GLOE-Pipe with rfd module … + [ bedcoverage, bed2bw + rfd ] +… // Portion of GLOE-Pipe without rfd module … + [ bedcoverage, bed2bw ] +…\nOptional: new modules can be added to GLOE-Pipe by following the instructions reported in the documentation for Bpipe (http://docs.bpipe.org/[href=http://docs.bpipe.org/]).",
    "Edit the bpipe.config file to adjust the resources (time limit, number of processors and amount of memory to reserve) required by each module included in the pipeline.
