    "The procedures described throughout this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School.\n1. Breeding\nNOTE: There are several published methods for breeding15,16,17,20 that could also be used at this step. Prior to breeding, adult fish are maintained on a 10:14 light:dark cycle at 23 °C and fed a pellet diet (see Table of Materials) once daily. Fish can be bred in a recirculating system with mechanical filtration and UV sterilization. Breeding can also be accomplished in static (non-recirculating) tanks, but fish should not be left in a static tank for more than 3 days, as water quality quickly degrades.\nFill a 5 gal tank with fish-ready water (dechlorinated water adjusted to: pH = 7.1 +/- 2, conductivity = 900 +/- 150 µS, temperature = 23 °C).\nPlace plastic mesh (see Materials) in the bottom of the tank. If breeding in static tanks, affix a water heater to the side of the tank. If breeding in a recirculating system, place a water heater in the system sump.\n\tNOTE: The plastic mesh prevents adults from consuming eggs.\nPlace one female and two male A. mexicanus fish of greater than 1 year old into the tank. Allow the fish to acclimate for 30 min.\nSet the temperature of the heater to 24 °C (or 1 °C warmer than the starting temperature).\nAfter 24 h, increase the temperature by 1 °C.\nAfter 24 h, increase the temperature by 1 °C. Check the tanks daily for eggs by shining a flashlight into the bottom of the tank. Withhold the fish from food during this 3-day period.",
    "If spawning has not been induced after 3 days, turn off the heater and allow the water to return to room temperature (RT) before moving the fish to their original tank.\n2. Hatching Fertilized Eggs\nOnce eggs are identified in a breeding tank, remove the adults and plastic mesh, and reduce the water to a depth of 10 cm using a beaker or cup.\n\tNOTE: To estimate time of spawning, use a transfer pipette to place several eggs into a Petri dish and view them with a stereomicroscope to determine the stage14 and estimate the time of fertilization.\nMove the tank to a convenient work surface and remove any opaque eggs or feces, leaving only the translucent, fertile eggs in the tank.\n\tNOTE: The number of fertile eggs can be recorded at this time.\nFill the tank with fish-ready water (see step 1.1) and add 6-7 drops of methylene blue to the tank as the water fills.\n\tNOTE: The final concentration of methylene blue is approximately 1.5 ppm.\nAdd a heater and aquarium bubbler (attached to an air pump, with a regulator) to the tank.\nSet the heater to 24 °C and adjust the airstream regulator to produce a gentle stream of bubbles.\nPlace a cover on the tank to help maintain the water temperature.\n\tNOTE: The eggs should begin hatching within 24 h of the spawning time.\n3. Transfer of Hatched Larvae to Nursery Containers\nAdd 20 g of salt (see Materials) to 8 L of fish-ready water (see step 1.1) and stir until dissolved. Fill each 1.5 L nursery container (see Materials) with 1 L of the prepared water.\nUse a transfer pipette to move hatched larvae into prepared nursery containers at a density of 20 fish per container.",
    "NOTE: A headlamp can be useful to locate and transfer the hatched larvae.\nAfter all the visible hatched larvae have been removed, agitate the water in the tank by stirring, and/or blowing water jets into the edges and corners of the tank with the pipette.\n\tNOTE: This will help reveal larvae that were missed on the first pass.\nDispose of unused larvae at this stage using the guidelines of the Office of Laboratory Welfare (OLAW). Add sodium hypochlorite to the tank to achieve a final concentration of 6.15%. Wait at least 5 min before pouring down the sink.\nLabel each nursery container with the date and time of fertilization. View nursery containers daily and continue to remove any dead larvae.\n4. Preparation of Rotifer-based Fish Food\nSee Table of Materials for information on obtaining rotifers. Follow the referenced protocol to set up, maintain, and harvest rotifers22.\nPrepare fish food by adding 3 mL of algae mixture (see Table of Materials) to 1 L of harvested rotifers. This mixture will be added directly to the nursery containers as a food supply.\n5. Feeding of Post-larval Fish\nWhen the fish are 5 days post fertilization (dpf), add 3 mL of fish food (prepared in step 4.2) to each nursery container. At the optimal density, rotifers should be visible in dense groups at the corners of the nursery containers, and less apparent at the center of the container. Add additional rotifer mixture until the appropriate density has been reached.\nCheck the containers daily for the presence of rotifers and add more if the concentration gets depleted. Continue to remove any dead larvae.\nWhen fish reach 14 dpf, move them to a tank fit with a recirculating system at a density of 5 fish/L of water.",
    "NOTE: The number of surviving post-larval fish can be recorded at this time.\n6. Whole-mount Immunohistochemistry of Post-larval Fish\nRemove post-larval fish of the desired stage from food for 24 h by pouring the nursery container containing the fish through a nylon mesh strainer and placing the strainer into a container with clean fish-ready water (see step 1.1).\n\tNOTE: It is essential to remove all of the food. Even small amounts of food in the gut are auto-fluorescent and will influence imaging.\nCollect and euthanize the fish.\n\tNOTE: The euthanasia protocol should follow OLAW guidelines and be approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We have noted that tricaine alone does not euthanize post-larval fish, and the fish begin to move when transferred from tricaine to fixative if the fish are not also kept on ice.\n\t\nPrepare tricaine solution in a beaker by adding 0.4 g of tricaine-S and 0.8 g of sodium bicarbonate to 1 L of deionized water, and place it on ice.\nPour the water containing the fish through a nylon mesh strainer to collect the fish. Gently submerge the strainer in ice-cold Tricaine solution and leave it on ice for 10 min.\nFix the euthanized fish.\n\t\nUse a transfer pipette with a cut tip to transfer the fish to a conical tube.\nRemove the Tricaine solution with a transfer pipette and replace with fixative. Incubate with rocking.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixative and fixation time must be determined based on the antibody used. 10% formalin solution (4% formaldehyde, see materials) overnight at 4 °C is adequate for the antibodies listed in the Table of Materials.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formalin is toxic and flammable. Wear personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, and splash goggles) and handle in a chemical hood. Solutions containing formalin should be disposed as hazardous waste.",
    "Use a transfer pipette to carefully remove the fixative without disturbing the fish. Add 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline-triton solution [PBS with 0.1% Triton (PBST), see Materials] and incubate for 15 min at RT with rocking.\nRemove PBST and replace with fresh PBST and incubate for 15 min. Repeat this “washing” one additional time.\n\t\tNOTE: Fish can be stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C for several weeks.\nPerform whole-mount immunostaining.\n\t\nPrepare 50 mL of blocking solution [PB-0.5% Triton X, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.02% sodium azide, 5% donkey serum].\n\t\tCAUTION: Sodium azide and DMSO are toxic. Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, and splash goggles) should be used when handling. Any solutions should be disposed as hazardous waste.\nUse a transfer pipette to transfer the fish to a 4 mL glass vial with screw-top cap. Use a transfer pipette to remove the PBST and add 3 mL blocking solution. Incubate for 1 h at RT with rocking.\nUse a transfer pipette to remove the blocking solution and add primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Incubate overnight at room temperature with agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, add 1:250 dilution of anti-HuC/HuD Neuronal Protein Mouse Monoclonal Antibody (see Table of Materials for a list of antibodies that have been successfully used in A. mexicanus). A set of fish with no primary antibody added should be included at this step. Volume of antibody should be enough to cover the fish and allow for agitation.\nWash the fish 3 times with PBST as described in step 6.3.4. Replace PBST with secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution and incubate overnight at RT with agitation.",
    "NOTE: Optimal primary and secondary antibody concentrations, incubation time, and incubation temperature should be determined for each antibody. Overnight at RT was effective for the antibodies listed in Table of Materials.\nWash the fish 3 times with PBST, with each wash lasting 15 min as described in step 6.3.4.\nTransfer the fish to PBS for short-term storage before proceeding with dissecting, mounting, or sectioning the fish."
