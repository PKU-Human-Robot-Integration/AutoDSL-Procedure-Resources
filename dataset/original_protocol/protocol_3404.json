    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Pulse labeling cells and cell lysis\nTiming: 5 days\nBefore the experiment, ensure that cells (for example human embryonic stem cell lines, fibroblasts or breast epithelial cells) are in their exponential growth phase. For maximum 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU) and 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine (CldU) incorporation, the cells have to actively proliferate and replicate.\nDay 1.\nPulse labeling cells with IdU and CldU.\nPulse the cells with 30 μM (final concentration in the media) IdU (10 mM stock concentration), growing for 4 h.\nWash cells with PBS to remove IdU.\nPulse the cells with 30 μM (final concentration in the media) CldU (10 mM stock concentration), growing for 4 h.\nNote: SMARD can be performed on both suspension and adherent cell lines. Spin down suspension cells after first pulse and wash with 1x PBS before second pulse.\nNote: IdU and CldU are dissolved in ddH2O according to manufacturer’s instruction and both are light sensitive, thus we recommend that labeling is performed without light under the hood and the steps after labeling under yellow light.\nNear the end of the second pulse (about 1 h before), prepare agarose.\nMake 1% low melting agarose (InCert agarose) gel in 1x PBS and boil the agarose solution for 10 min and then equilibrate to 50°C in water bath.\nPre-cool 1x PBS buffer and plug mold (for making the plugs) for 30 min on ice.\nAfter the second pulse, detach, spin cells down and wash cells with 1x PBS.\nCount the cells (use yellow light from now on for the rest of the procedure if possible).\nResuspend the cells in ice-cold 1x PBS to make the final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/mL (that will lead to a final concentration of 1 × 106/plug).",
    "Equilibrate the cells to 42°C in water bath for 5 min. Then add equal volume of agarose solution, mix by pipetting up and down and leave the suspension in 42°C water bath for 1 min.\nNote: Before mixing the agarose solution transfer the agarose solution from 50°C to 42°C about 2 min before mixing with the cells.\nPipette the mixture into the plug molds (∼80 μL per well for Bio-Rad molds). Leave on ice for 20 min to let the plugs solidify.\nTake the plugs out of the plug cast and put them into the lysis buffer (0.5 M EDTA + 1% sarcosine). Add 0.5 mL proteinase K stock solution (20 mg/mL) per 50 mL lysis buffer. Incubate in a 50°C water bath for 14–18 h.\nDay 2–5.\nChange the lysis buffer (by carefully pouring off the liquid so that the plugs stay at the bottom) the next day and add fresh proteinase K (20 mg/mL) in a 50 mL corning tube. Incubate in a 50°C water bath for 24 h.\nRepeat step 9.\nAfter proteinase K digestion, wash the plugs with TE (pH 8) for 1 h at room temperature (RT: 23oC), rotating (we use rocker with 24 rpm, 30-degree tilt angle).\nWash the plugs with TE 8 and incubate the plugs for 1 h at 50°C.\nDiscard buffer and incubate the plugs in TE 8 buffer + PMSF (100 μL stock PMSF/50 mL TE 8, PMSF stock concentration is 100 mM) at 50°C for 30 min.\nRepeat step 13.\nWash the plugs in TE 8 buffer twice at RT for 1 h, rotating.\nAdd fresh TE 8 buffer, leave at 4°C for 14–18 h.\nTransfer plugs to storage buffer (50 mM EDTA + 10 mM Tris-HCl 8.0) the next day, leave at 4°C for 14–18 h.",
    "Transfer plugs into fresh storage buffer and continue storing the cell plugs at 4°C.\nCritical: The cell plugs should be solid before removal and handed very careful. At this point in the process, since the cell plugs are in long-term storage buffer, you can pause and continue to use the cell plugs for SMARD for up to 2 years.\nPart 2: DNA digestion and separation\nTiming: 4–5 days\nDay 1.\nTake out the plugs needed for digestion from the storage buffer, wash with 50 mL TE 8 (for 3–6 plugs), twice for 1 h at RT, rotating.\nQuickly rinse the plugs with water; and then with Pre-digestion buffer (10 mM MgCl2 + 10 mM Tris-HCl 8.0).\nWash with 50 mL Pre-digestion bufferat RT for 1 h, rotating.\nRepeat step 21 twice.\nTransfer plugs to 1.5 mL tubes (one plug/tube). Equilibrate each plug in 1 mL digestion buffer of the enzyme you choose to cut the genomic DNA (NEB buffer with 2X BSA and 4 μL/mL of 100 mM spermidine) .\nWe usually use the rare-cutting enzymes PmeI, SfiI, SbfI, PacI or SwaI to cut the genomic DNA.\nUse GCK or any other program to choose the enzyme and predict DNA fragment size (between 100 to 400 kb) that contains the region of interest.\nWash with digestion buffer a second time for 30 min at RT, rotating.\nAdd 150 μL digestion buffer per plug with 30 unit of enzyme.\nPipette up and down to mix solution (be careful not to touch the cell plug).\nLeave the plug on ice for 30 min to let the enzyme diffuse into the plug.\nLeave the digestion for 14–18 h at the temperature required for each enzyme.\nDay 2.",
    "Next day, tremove (by carefully pipetting) the digestion buffer and rinse the plugs with TE 8 first and then wash the plugs with TE 8 for 1 h at RT, rotating. You can also wash plugs for several hours with TE 8 on ice or leave it for 14–18 h at 4°C.\nPulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE system:CHEF mapper or CHEF DRIII system, Bio-Rad):\nCast low melting agarose gel (usually 0.7% agarose gel is used GTG SeaPlaque). The low melting agarose is dissolved in 150 mL of 0.5x TBE in the microwave. Then, let the solution cool at RT before casting the gel.\nKeep the rest of the melted agarose in the 65°C water bath.\nLet the gel solidify for at least 1.5 h.\nPre-cool 3 L of 0.5x TBE in the PFGE apparatus for 1 h before the run. Circulation is set to 60–70. During the run, the temperature inside the apparatus is around 12°C.\nAfter the gel has solidified, remove a 1–3 cm strip from top of this gel and place plugs and markers on the edge in horizontal position. Pour remaining agarose to fill the gap and to solidify the plugs to gel.\nPre-cool the gel inside the tank for 10–30 min before starting the run.\nSet up the PFGE program.\nNote: The parameters depend on the size of the DNA fragment you need to isolate after the run. For example, 145 kb PmeI fragment: 0.7% agarose gel, 0.5x TBE, 200 volt with an Initial time: 5, Final time: 16, Run time: 36 h.\nDay 4.\nAfter the PFGE run, remove the gel and cut the gel region with the DNA as pictured in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3169-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. PFGE gel after ethidium bromide staining",
    "Two Markers (M2: CHEF DNA Size Marker (0.2–2.2 Mb) S. cerevisiae and M1: Lambda DNA Ladder (48.5 kB - 1 MB)) are placed flanking the DNA inthe cell plugs. Black arrows on the bottom indicate the cut positions. Use a ruler (R) to determine the position of the DNA fragments according to the size of the DNA segment of interest.\nSet aside the gel with the DNA.\nFill the rest with 1% agarose (SeaKem) and stain gel with ethidium bromide (about 0.5 μg/mL) for about 2 h, shaking gently.\nDetermine the position of your DNA fragment based on the size of the PFGE marker and ruler (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCut 0.5 cm DNA fragment containing your region of interest out of the gel strip you set aside using a ruler.\nTo confirm that this gel piece contains your region of interest cut ∼1–2 mm slivers from both ends of this gel piece for PCR, keep the rest of the gel piece in storage buffer.\nMelt the agarose and perform PCR to confirm the presence of your regions of interest:\nWash the gel slices in agarose digestion buffer (TE 8 + 100 mM NaCl + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), equilibrate for at least 2 h.\nTransfer gel slices to a 1.5 mL tube and add 150 μL agarase digestion buffer.\nMelt at 72°C for 20 min and then equilibrate solution at 45°C for 1 min.\nAdd 1.5 μL agarase slowly in circular motion on the surface, mix by rotating the tube and digest the agarose at 45°C for 1.5 h.\nCritical: When adding the agarase (do not mix by vortexing or pipetting!) simply mix by rotating the tube gently with your hands for 1-2 min.\nPerform PCR to confirm the presence of your region of interest:",
    "The separation of the genomic DNA may vary between different PFGE runs. To identify the exact 0.5 cm DNA slice that contains the DNA of interest, use PCR, set up PCR reactions for 6–7 DNA samples surrounding the 0.5 cm gel slice likely to contain the DNA of interest based on the DNA marker.\nUse 1–2 μL of the melted DNA solution for PCR reaction.\nUsing NCBI-BLAST design primers specific to your region of interest.\nPCR reaction conditions vary according to the annealing temperature of the PCR primers chosen. Set up a reaction with at least 30–35 cycles.\nTo confirm amplification, run the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel.\nOptional: For confirmation that the gel piece contains the region of interest Southern blot analysis can also be performed. The slices can be stored in storage buffer at 4°C for up to 2 years.\nPause point: At this point in the process, since the slices are in long-term storage buffer, you can pause and continue to use the gel slices for SMARD for up to 2 years.\nPart 3: Hybridization and immunodetection\nTiming: 5 days\nSTEP 1: Pre-hybridization steps - Slide preparation, Biotin-Nick translation and Agarose Melting to release DNA of interest.\nDay 1–2.\nSlide Preparation (Timing: 2 days + 1–2 days of desiccation).\nSoak slides in 1% SDS for at least 1 h.\nWash the slides with 1% SDS solution followed by rinsing with hot water and a final wash with distilled water.\nImmerse the slides in HNO3: HCl (2:1) solution for 14–18 h in a chemical hood.\nNext day, remove the slides from the acid and transfer to a trough of distilled water.\nWash the slides in distilled water 3 times, 3 min each time.\nDrain excess water from the slides on a paper towel.",
    "Rinse the slides in a trough of Methanol, moving up and down.\nWash the slides in Methanol containing Amino Silane (2 mL stock of Amino Silane in 500 mL Methanol) for 1 h, shaking constantly at 70 rpm.\nRinse off the excess Amino Silane using the first trough of Methanol from step 36g.\nWash the slides in distilled water 3 times, 3 min each time.\nRinse slides in 95% Ethanol twice, air dry with air from a hose with a filter at the end.\nPlace the slides in a desiccator for a day.\nTroubleshooting\nTo obtain well stretched DNA in the following steps, optimal desiccation of the silane coated slides is essential (1–2 days).14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] This can vary depending on the desiccator used, age of the amino silane and atmospheric humidity. The desiccation time might need to be altered to accommodate these variations. The slides can be used within a week if stored within the desiccator.\nBiotin-Nick translation (Timing: 3 h).\nDNA probes specific to the region of interest are prepared for hybridization by biotinylation using nick translation.\nFosmids containing DNA complimentary to the region of interest are obtained from BACPAC resources.\nA standard midi or maxi prep (QIAGEN) is carried out to obtain enough DNA for multiple experiments.\nBiotin-Nick translation of the fosmid DNA is carried out using the Invitrogen kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nOptional: Appropriate size of the biotinylated probe (100–300 bp) can be ascertained by resolving a sample of the nick translated product on a 1% agarose gel. Radio isotopes can be included in the nick translation reaction to ascertain sufficient biotinylation of probes by Southern blotting.\nAgarose Melting to release DNA of interest (Timing: 7 h).\nFrom the gel slice that contains your region of interest, cut ∼1–2 mm slivers from both ends for melting.",
    "Wash the gel slices in 50 mL agarase digestion buffer (TE8 + 100 mM NaCl + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) andequilibrate for at least 2 h, rotating.\nTransfer gel slices into a 1.5 mL tube and add 150 μL agarase digestion buffer.\nMelt at 72°C for 20 min and then equilibrate the tube at 45°C for 1 min.\nAdd 1.5 μL agarase slowly in circular motion on the surface, mix by rotating the tube and digest the agarose at 45°C for 4 h. After digestion, add 0.2 μL YOYO to the DNA slowly in a circular motion and incubate for 30 min.\nCritical: When adding the agarase (do not mix by vortexing or pipetting!) simply mix by rotating the tube gently with your hands for 1–2 min.\nOptional: To save time, this can be done in parallel on Days 1–3. Alternatively, it can be done after PCR detection of the slice containing the region of interest.\nSTEP 2: DNA Stretching and Hybridization (Timing: 2 days under yellow light or in the dark).\nDay 4.\nPrepare the humid chamber by placing two moistened kimwipes inside a black slide box and place box in the 37°C room.\nPrepare the following buffers (5 slides per jar).\nMethanol + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol.\nDenaturation Buffer: 0.1 N NaOH in 70% ethanol + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol.\nFixation buffer: 0.5% glutaraldehyde in denaturation buffer. Glutaraldehyde must be added to the denaturation buffer from previous step just before use.\nNote: Methanol and glutaraldehyde are toxic if inhaled. Prepare and store in the chemical hood.\nDehydration buffers: Two 70% ethanol washes followed by one 95% ethanol wash and a final 100% ethanol wash.\nStretch the DNA.\nTo begin, mark denaturation times and cell line names on slides.",
    "Place a 22 × 22 mm coverslip at the center of the slide. The coverslips must be cleaned with ethanol or methanol just before use.\nStretch the DNA underneath the coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3169-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Stretching DNA on a slide\nUsing a 200 μL large orifice pipet tip, extract 3.5–4 μL of YOYO-stained DNA gently. Pipet out DNA solution slowly from one side of the coverslip, moving up and down along the edge of the coverslip to allow liquid movement by capillary action under the coverslip. Mark the position of the coverslip with a diamond glass marker.\nHint: The stretch of the DNA fibers can be checked under the microscope. For more information regarding good versus badly stretched DNA, please refer to the troubleshooting section below.\nRemove the coverslip gently with a razor blade. Dip the slides into the Methanol + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol buffer. Keep the slides in Methanol buffer for at least 10 min before denaturation.\nDenature the slides with Denaturation buffer for a series of times: 8 min, 12 min, and 16 min.\nNote: longer denaturation times can cause DNA breakage\nNext, add glutaraldehyde to Fixation buffer and fix the slides with Fixation buffer for 5 min.\nDehydrate the slides by washing them with a series of ethanol washes of increasing concentrations: first 70% (# of 70% jars = # of fixation jars), second 70%, one 95% and one 100% ethanol wash. Wash the slides for 1–2 min each time.\nPlace the slides in the original Methanol + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol jars for 60 min before proceeding with the hybridization step.\nTurn on the dry heating block and adjust the temperature to 95°C to denature the probes for hybridization.",
    "Prepare the hybridization master mix in a 15 mL falcon tube and mix in a rotator for at least 30 min (hybridization master mixture contains 40% formamide, 5 M NaCl, 10% SDS, 50% Dextran Sulfate, 1 M Tris pH 7.4, 1 μg/μL COT1 DNA and 10 μg/μL Salmon Sperm DNA).\nHint: Prepare approximately 3 mL for 16 slides.\nAfter the slides have been in Methanol + 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min, start preparing the hybridization-probe mixture in individual Eppendorf tubes by adding 2.5 μL biotinylated probe to 110 μL hybridization mixture.\nDry the slides a little by wiping with kimwipes gently on the back and the side of the slides.\nAssemble the hybridization compartment by placing one 22 × 40 mm coverslip over two 11 × 22 mm coverslips as follows (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–C).
