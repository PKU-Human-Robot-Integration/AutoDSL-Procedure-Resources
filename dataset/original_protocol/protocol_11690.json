    "The strain of eggs used in this protocol was White Leghorn, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Illinois Wesleyan University.\n1. Incubation of chick eggs\nKeep the eggs at ~10 °C for up to 1 week after they are laid to halt development. When ready to initiate chick embryo development, wipe the entire eggshell with lint-free wipes (see Table of Materials) saturated with room temperature water to remove dirt and debris.\nEnsure the eggshell is sanitized. Wipe down the entire egg surface with lint-free wipes dampened with 70% ethanol. Quickly wipe off the ethanol to dry the egg and avoid ethanol absorption through the eggshell to the embryo.\nArrange the eggs horizontally on a tray. Mark the top of the egg to denote the expected position of the embryo. Incubate the eggs horizontally, with the rocking function activated, in a 38 °C humidified incubator.\n2. Windowing the eggs to prepare for membrane dissection\nRemove eggs from the incubator on the third day of embryonic development (E3). Sterilize the top of the eggs with lint-free wipes dampened with 70% ethanol. Dry the ethanol from the eggshell surfaces.\n\tNOTE: To ensure that development was not delayed during the windowing procedure, 6-12 eggs were removed, and the procedure was quickly carried out on these while the remaining eggs were left in the incubator.\nPosition an egg horizontally in a secure egg holder (see Table of Materials). Using the sharp end of dissecting scissors, create a small hole in the top of the eggshell near the pointed end of the egg.",
    "NOTE: This hole will facilitate the removal of albumen, which is necessary to drop the yolk and embryo away from the inner eggshell surface. For egg holders, paper-pulp egg filler flats, within which the eggs come shipped, were used.\nThrough the hole (Step 2.2.), insert an 18 G beveled hypodermic needle. With the needle pushed to the bottom inner surface of the egg and the bevel-side of the needle facing the pointed end of the egg (e.g., away from the expected location of the yolk and the embryo near the middle of the egg), remove 2-3 mL of albumen from the chicken egg and discard.\n\tNOTE: If one's needle nicks the embryo or its associated vasculature during this step, it will result in blood being aspirated with the albumen. This will result in embryo death. Further, if the yolk is inadvertently aspirated along with the albumen during this step, the embryo will not be viable. In either case, the egg should be discarded if the embryo cannot be immediately used for other purposes.\nClean the eggshell surface surrounding the hole with lint-free wipes lightly dampened with 70% ethanol and wipe dry. Seal the hole made for removing albumen with clear tape.\nWith the sharp end of dissecting scissors, make a second \"window\" hole in the top of the eggshell at the marking site (Step 1.3.). Ensure that the scissors do not extend too far into the eggshell to avoid contacting and damaging the embryo or embryonic vasculature, which will often be positioned within the egg directly below the site of the second hole.\nUsing curved iris forceps, widen the \"window\" hole to span ~2-3 cm in diameter and serve as a \"window\" to the developing embryo beneath the shell.",
    "Insert one end of the forceps into the hole, keeping it parallel to and closely juxtaposed with the eggshell. With the other forceps end positioned outside the eggshell, carefully pinch the two forceps ends together, allowing them to break and remove small pieces of the eggshell. Continue breaking and removing eggshell fragments until there remains a 2-3 cm window that directly overlays the embryo.\n\t\tNOTE: Eggs in which embryos do not lay directly beneath the hole made in Step 2.6. must not be used as the forthcoming membrane dissections would be challenging to complete. Even with rocking the eggs horizontally, about 10% of the eggs are unusable due to the poor positioning of the embryo. These embryos can be used for other purposes.\nTo limit bacterial contamination, add through the window hole (e.g., into the egg) ~100-200 µL of Ringer's solution (8 g of NaCl, 0.37 g of KCl, and 0.23 g of CaCl2.2H20 per L of distilled H20) containing Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics (50 U/mL of Penicillin and 50 µg/mL of Streptomycin, see Table of Materials).\nSeal the window hole using clear adhesive tape. Perform the egg sealing by aligning a corner of the tape on the long axis of the hole and pressing the tape to the shell ~1-2 cm away from the edge of the hole.\n\t\nContinue sealing around the opening until a hanging flap of tape is left on one side. Press the two pieces of tape together, creating a domed shape over the hole, and press the flap of over-hanging tape to the shell to finish sealing the egg.",
    "NOTE: Eggs need to be windowed at either E2 or E3. As per experience, windowing prior to E2 results in low embryo viability. Moreover, by E4, the embryo and extraembryonic membranes become attached to the eggshell10, and any attempts to window at E4 or later often result in embryo damage or tearing of extraembryonic blood vessels, with either event leading to the outcome of embryo death.\nReturn the \"windowed\" eggs to the incubator for further development. Ensure to keep the eggs horizontal and turn off the incubator's rocking function.\nRepeat Steps 2.2.-2.9. for each egg.\n3. Microdissections of the extraembryonic membranes\nRemove an E5.5 windowed egg from the incubator. Expose the embryo by cutting the tape away from the window with sterilized dissecting scissors.\nUse a dissecting microscope to observe the embryo and its extraembryonic membranes through the window. If necessary, use scissors or curved iris forceps to widen the window so that the embryo is well-positioned beneath the window, taking care not to damage the embryonic vasculature.\n\t\nAdd two drops of Ringer's solution containing Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics to hydrate the embryo and sterilize the egg.\nUse a dissecting microscope to ensure the embryo is at the proper developmental stage (Hamburger Hamilton stage 27, ~E5.5)11,12 and locate the positions of the amniochorionic membrane (ACM) and the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).\n\tNOTE: At this stage, the embryo is surrounded by the ACM, which comprises the amniotic membrane and overlying chorionic membrane fused and partially covered by the highly-vascularized allantois, which extends from the embryo's gut region and fuses with the overlaying chorion to form the CAM11,12. The ACM is not heavily vascularized, which enables one to dissect these membranes to expose the embryo without damaging blood vessels and harming the embryo.\nPerform extraembryonic membrane dissections at this stage (E5.5).",
    "NOTE: E5.5 is the ideal time to carry out the extraembryonic membrane dissections. Dissecting the membranes earlier (e.g., at E4) before CAM formation reduces embryo accessibility at later stages11. Moreover, at E5.5, the embryo is only partially covered by the highly-vascularized CAM, yet over the next 1-2 days, the CAM quickly envelops and precludes further access to the embryo11,12. For this reason, membrane dissection at E6 or later is challenging as the risk of tearing blood vessels increases.\n\t\nUse a pair of sterilized fine forceps to gently grasp the ACM and pull it away from the embryo. Then use sterilized micro-dissecting scissors to cut a hole in the ACM directly above the forelimb that extends from the membrane overlying the forelimb to the membrane overlying the head.\n\t\tNOTE: This step relaxes the chorion and amnion membranes, thus making them easier to grab and further dissect with forceps in the next steps. See Figure 1 for a helpful schematic of how membranes are dissected through the eggshell window.\nUse two pairs of fine, sterile forceps to gently grab the amnion in two adjacent positions between the ACM and the CAM (e.g., an area between the cut made above the forelimb and the nearest edge of the CAM).\n\t\nCarefully move each pair of forceps, both firmly gripping the amniotic membrane, away from one another, with one pair moving dorsally to the embryo and the other ventrally.\n\t\tNOTE: This motion serves to tear the amnion further while also separating the ACM (which gets pulled in the dorsal direction with respect to the embryo by one pair of forceps) and the CAM (which gets pulled in the ventral direction with respect to the embryo by the other pair of forceps).",
    "Ensure that the membranes are separated when the CAM no longer covers the embryo and the allantoic artery and vein, which emanate from the embryonic gut to the CAM, are readily apparent.\nUse sterilized fine forceps to dissect and remove any remaining amnion membrane covering the embryo. It is most commonly observed that the remaining amnion will partially cover the caudal half of the embryo.\n\t\nUsing sterilized forceps, grasp the amnion near the mid-cranial region of the embryo and carefully pull the amnion in a caudal direction with respect to the embryo toward the earlier displaced CAM. The embryo will now be fully exposed, and further growth of the CAM will mainly occur away from the developing embryo.\n\t\tNOTE: See Figure 1 for a helpful schematic on how the exposed embryo will appear following membrane dissection. Also, refer to a previously published report11 for helpful schematic diagrams of Steps 3.3.-3.6.\nAdd a few drops of Ringer's solution containing Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics to hydrate the embryo and sterilize the egg.\nReseal the window hole using clear tape, as described in Step 2.8. Return the egg to the incubator for further development, keeping the egg horizontal and keeping the incubator's rocking function inactivated.\nRepeat Steps 3.1.-3.8. for each egg.",
    "NOTE: The extraembryonic membrane dissections at E5.5 described above will enable access to the embryo through E7, which is when wounding can be carried out8,9. By E8, the continued growth of the CAM tissue begins to cover the cranial region of the embryo, thus precluding further access to the cornea. If one desires to carry out wounding in older E8-E9 corneas, it is possible to reposition the growing CAM ventrally with respect to the embryo (Step 3.10.). If one wishes to wound at E7, Step 3.10. is not necessary to perform and one may proceed to Step 4, corneal wounding.\nRemove an E7 egg from the incubator whose extraembryonic membranes were previously dissected at E5.5 (Steps 3.1.-3.8.). Grasp with sterilized forceps any available amnion membrane tissues fused to the CAM and gently pull the amnion membrane away from the cranial region of the embryo in a ventral direction with respect to the embryo.\n\t​NOTE: Since the amnionic membrane being displaced away from the embryo is fused to the CAM, the growing and highly vascularized CAM will follow the amnion-grasping forceps and move away from the cranial region. Repeat this step daily to continually displace the CAM away from the embryo until the embryo is at the desired age for wounding.\n4. Corneal wounding\nObtain an egg from the incubator for wounding at the desired embryonic age, E7-E9. Expose the embryo by cutting the tape away from the window with sterilized dissecting scissors. Add a few drops of Ringer's solution containing Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics to hydrate the embryo and sterilize the egg.",
    "Use a micro-dissecting knife to make an incision that spans the extent of the cornea of the right eye (due to how the embryo lays in the egg, the left eye is not accessible but can serve as a non-wounded control), which is parallel to and in line with the choroid fissure (Figure 1). The first cut will traverse the corneal epithelium.\n\t\nUse the micro-dissecting knife to again lacerate the cornea in the same spot as the first incision 2x more (e.g., three cuts total, with cut 2 and cut 3 occurring along with the same position in the cornea as cut 1)11. The second laceration will traverse the basement membrane, and the third will penetrate the anterior stroma.\n\t\tNOTE: If the embryo has settled under the dissected CAM, one can use sterilized curved iris forceps to carefully move the head out from under the CAM. Position the curved iris forceps beneath the head, making contact with the left side of the head. Cradle the entire head on top of closed curved iris forceps and gently raise the head around and above the CAM. To help with viability, use a similar technique with the curved iris forceps to tuck the embryo back under the CAM after surgery to promote proper growth of the CAM.\nAdd 3-4 drops of Ringer's solution containing Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics to hydrate the embryo and sterilize the egg.\nReseal the window hole with clear tape and return to the incubator, leaving the egg horizontal. Allow the embryo to develop and the corneal wound to heal for a desired period (e.g., 0.5-11 days), and then humanely euthanize the embryo by decapitation.",
    "Use curved iris forceps to harvest the eye from a euthanized embryo floating in a Petri dish of Ringer's saline solution by gently grasping the eye on its posterior side, where the eye and facial tissue meet, and carefully lifting the whole eye away and free from the facial tissue.\n\t\nUse fine forceps to poke a small hole (3-5 cm) in the back of the whole eye and fix the whole eye in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight with mild agitation.\nSubscription Required.
