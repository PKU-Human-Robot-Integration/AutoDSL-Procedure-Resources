The cylindrical form is the most used, and it is demonstrated here (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Procedural steps from 1 to 5\nSelect the white squares at the vertices of the cylinder to modify its length and width to 10.0.\nNote: The white squares become red when selected, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The “millimeters” is the default scale, shown at the bottom right as “Snap Grid “. If necessary, it can be changed by clicking on “Edit Grid” and at the “Grid Properties” window, changing the item “Unit” to “Millimeter”, and finally, “Update Grid”.\nSelect the white square in the middle of the cylinder to modify its height to the value to 1 mm.\nNote: Since we intend to use Slicing software to split the geometry into different layers, the height chosen must be a multiple of the layer height. As pointed out by several authors, although thin layers might give better precision (0.1 mm), they can take longer, and without a supporting bath, the cells are more prone to die during longer periods, while thicker (> 0.25) layers might not adhere to the printing table and stick to the needle (for further information, we recommend the following ref. 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nSelect the object and copy-paste it.\nClick on the surface of the new object, and by using the mouse’s left button, drag it to fit the first object.",
    "Click at the dark arrow (pointed up) in the middle of the objects and lift one of the objects 1 mm above the other (by doing this, the option to insert the desired distance is enabled).\nNote: If the user desires to build objects with another height, it is necessary to adjust the vertical translation to fit one object at the top of the other.\nSelect only the object below and click on export (right corner at the top of the screen).\nSelect the option “The selected shape” and the panel “For 3D Print”, select click on “.STL”).\nName the file as “Bottom”.\nSelect only the object above, repeat steps 5 and 5a and name it as “Top” file.\nClose Tinkercad.\nMajor step two: Slicing setup\nTiming: 20 min\nDownload Prusa Slicer at https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/[href=https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/] and select “PrusaSlicer Windows Standalone”.\nInstall by double-clicking on the download file.\nOpen PrusaSlicer and click on “Configuration Tab > Mode >” and select “Expert” to enable additional features.\nSelect the “Print settings” tab on the configuration menu (Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nSelect “Layers and perimeters” on the left menu.\nConfigure the “Layer height” and “First layer height” as 0.2 mm.\nConfigure “Vertical Shells” as 0.\nConfigure “Horizontal shells”, “Solid Layers”, “Top”, and “Bottom” as 0.\nGo to the next subitem on the left menu and select “Infill” (Figure S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nConfigure “Fill density” at 50% and “Fill Pattern” as “Rectilinear” at the “infill” panel.\nNote: Higher infill or cell concentrate can be used if the bioprinted construct requires a higher cell density. At this condition, each construct has around 50.000 cells.\nConfigure “Combine infill every” to 1 at the “reducing printing times” panel.\nConfigure “Solid Infill” and “Fill Angle” to 0 and 90, respectively, at the “advanced” panel.\nSelect “Skirt and Brim” on the left menu (Figure S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).",
    "Configure “Loops (minimum)” and “Brim width” at 0 in “skirt” and “brim” panels, respectively.\nSelect the “speed” on the left menu (Figure S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nConfigure the speed of the “infill”, “Support material”, and “Bridges” to 5 at the “Speed for print moves” panel.\nNote: The cell deposition at higher speeds requires higher flow, which, in excess, leads to cell death and might also reduce shape fidelity.\nConfigure “Travel” to 20 at the “Speed for non-print moves” panel.\nConfigure “First layer speed” to 5 at the “Modifiers” panel. The cell deposition at higher speeds requires higher flow, which, in excess, leads to cell death.\nSelect “Advanced” on the left menu (Figure S6[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nConfigure all variables to 0.4 at the “Extrusion width” panel.\nSave the configuration by clicking on diskette.\nSelect “Filament settings” and “Filament” on the left menu (Figure S7[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nConfigure the “Diameter” as 12 mm on the “filament” panel. The 5 mL syringe has a 12 mm internal diameter; therefore, if a different syringe is used, it is necessary to change this value to obtain the right flow through the needle.\nSet the value as 0 for all the options on the “Temperature” panel.\nSave the configuration by clicking on diskette.\nSelect “Printer settings” and “General” on the left menu (Figure S8[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nClick on “Set” at the “Bed Shape” option in the “Size and coordinates” panel.\nAt the new window, change the shape of the bed to X: “300”, Y: “300”, Origin X “100” and Origin Y “140” and click on “OK”.\nConfigure the “Max Print height” to “100” and “Z offset” to 1.2 at the “Size and coordinate” panel.",
    "Note: The “Z offset” was adjusted to 1.2 because the bioprinting takes place on a petri dish with a 1.4 mm height; each bioprinted layer height has 0.2 mm. This way, at the start, the needle faces the petri dish's surface, assuring higher precision and bioink adhesion at this surface.\nConfigure the parameter “Extruders” to 2 at the “Capabilities” panel.\nSelect “Custom G-Code” on the left menu (Figure S9[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nAt the “Start G-Code” panel, substitute the content to:\n“G1 X0 Y70 Z1.4 F3000”\nNote: The “Start G-Code” command assures that the bioprinting process starts at this position, the same as the sliced file. At the “End G-Code” command the needle moves upwards and holds for 5 s before the initial position with the first extruder.\nAt the “End of G-code” panel Substitute the content to:\n“G1 Z25 F3000\nG4 P5000\nT0\nG1 X0 Y70 Z1.4”\nSelect “Extruder 1” on the left menu (Figure S10[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nAt the “Size” panel, set “Nozzle Diameter” as 0.4 mm.\nSet the value at “0” “for “Length” at the “Retraction” panel.\nSet the value at “0” for “Length” at the “Retraction tool when tool is disabled” panel.\nProceed as steps 11a to 11c for the “Extruder 2” on the left menu. However, set the value of the “Extruder offset” at “85” for “X coordinate” at the “Position” panel.\nCritical: In this case, Extruder 2 is horizontally swift 85 mm from Extruder 1. By setting this condition, the slicing software automatically corrects the relative position of both extruders during the bioprinting process.\nReturn to the “Platter” at the “Configuration menu” and import the two “STL” files exported from TinkerCAD (Figure S11[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nClick “Yes” at the “Multi-part object detect” warning message.",
    "Click on “Bottom” on the right menu to move both parts simultaneously and replace them at position “(X,Y):(0,70)” (Figure S12[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nNote: Certify that the “Bottom” file uses Extruder 1 and the “Top” file Extruder 2; otherwise, select at gear on the right of the option to change the order of the extruders.\nClick “View” and “Front” on the main menu to observe the stacked objects (Figure S13[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nClick “Preview” or “Slice now” buttons to slice the objects.\nUse the bar to visualize the split layer. If the layers are not properly sliced, check possible solutions at problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nClick on “Export G-Code” to export the G-code used to control the printer during the bioprinting process.\nOpen the exported file with the option “open with” and choose Notepad.\nPress CTRL + F to locate the following line “T1”. T1 stands for extruder 2/s syringe.\nAdd the following steps before “T1” and save the file:\n“G1 Z25 F3000\nG1 X-86.429 Y74.285 F3000\nG1 E0.01\nZ2.4 F3000”\nNote: Check command positions to avoid contact with the petri dish while changing the needle for the other bioink (Figure S14[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nMajor step three: Bioink synthesis\nTiming: 7 days\nPreheat 50 mL of PBS at 50°C using a heating plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] summarizes this procedure).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. GelMA synthesis protocol\nCover the top of the Becker with aluminum foil paper to avoid PBS evaporation (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nLet it stabilize for at least 30 min under a fume hood. Complete the following steps in the fume hood.\nAdd 5 g of gelatin from porcine skin and stir it at 250 RPM until it forms a clear solution.\nAdd slowly (dropwise) 0.5 mL of methacrylic anhydride, MA (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nTransfer 0.5 mL to a beaker and add it using a plastic pipette.",
    "Note: This concentration of MA results in Low GelMA, and higher concentrations can also be used (High GelMA 5 mL of MA, Medium GelMA 2–2.5 mL of MA, Low GelMA 0.5–1 mL of MA).\nCritical: MA is a hazardous material, and it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled and may cause damage to the skin if spilt. For further information, check the FISPQ. Acute Tox. 4 Inhalation - Acute Tox. 4 Oral - Eye Dam. 1 - Skin Irrit. 2 - Skin Sens. 1 - STOT SE 3. Personal safety items recommended: Eyeshields, Faceshields, Gloves, type ABEK (EN14387) respirator filter.\nCover the solution with aluminum foil and let it react at 50°C for 2 h.\nMonitor the temperature every 15 min to ensure it does not shift more than ± 2°C.\nNote: A temperature shift higher than the specified might alter the methacrylation degree of GelMA.\nHydrate dialysis membrane in deionized water, about 2 pieces of 50 cm each.\nNote: Test the membranes with deionized water for holes or leaks before use.\nPreheat 50 mL of PBS and dilute the gelatin-MA solution.\nLet it stir for 10 min at the same conditions previously described.\nWith the aid of a glass funnel, pour the solution of gelatin-MA equally into the dialysis membranes.\nClose one of the ends before adding the gelatin-MA solution inside the membrane.\nNote: Let left enough space for air before closing the membrane; the air makes the membrane float and aids homogenization.\nDialyze with distilled water at 40°C for 5 days with mild agitation (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "Note: Cover the Becker with aluminum foil paper to avoid evaporation. Approximately 2 L of distillate water is enough to remove the unreacted MA completely. Change the distilled water with preheated water twice daily and homogenize the GelMA by flipping it upside-down.\nAt the end of dialysis -5th day- remove the content of the membranes.\nMix it with 100 mL of ultrapure water preheated at 40°C.\nNote: If more solution is made, it is necessary to dilute it to 50%; in this case, the content of the dialyzed membranes was 100 mL.\nAgitate for 15 min with magnetic stirring.\nTransfer the solution of GelMA to 50 mL conical tubes and store at −80 for at least 2 days before lyophilization.\nNote: Adjust the volume in each tube to approx. 25 mL and store them horizontally during freezing to optimize the lyophilization process.\nRetrieve the flasks from −80°C, remove the taps and add the top of each conical flask tissue paper.\nLyophilizate the reagent for 2 days (Figure S15[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nStore the freeze-dried GelMA at −20°C until use.\nNote: The GelMA is no longer hazardous at this stage and can be handled as a gelatin.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

    "Add 20 mg of photoinitiator (0.5% m/v) and dissolve it in a furnace at 37°C for at least 4 h or overnight (Figure S16[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nCover the flask with aluminum foil, light exposure activates the photoinitiator.\nNote: This concentration will be later diluted to 4 wt.% by adding an equal volume of Geltrex®. For mechanical tests, the GelMA can be prepared directly at 4 wt.%. The Geltrex® is stored at −20°C; therefore, it is recommended to transfer an aliquot to freeze at least 30 min before using it.\nFilter the solution of GelMA using a syringe and a polypropylene 0.22 μm filter under a laminar flow cabinet.\nNote: During filtering, part of the material is lost. Therefore, more solution needs to be prepared. Filter GelMA without letting it cool down, this compromises the filtering process.\nMaintain the filtered GelMA at 37°C using a water bath until its use.\nNote: Filtered GelMA stored in the fridge can be used within 2–3 days; GelMA mixed with Geltrex® need to be used as soon as possible.\nMajor step five: Multi-layered bioprinting\nTiming: ∼30 min to 4 h\nCell retrieval and resuspension\nRetrieve -HUVEC- cells from the incubator, remove the media, and resuspend the cells using a Trypsin/EDTA solution as follows (Figure S17[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]):\nIncubate the cells in 1 volume of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA warm-solution for 5 min. For instance, 1 volume was considered as 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA.\nInactivate the Trypsin/EDTA solution with the same media volume 1:1 (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin). For instance, 1 volume was considered as 5 mL of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% of Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nRetrieve the filtered GelMA or GelMA/Geltrex® and transfer it to laminar flow cabinet.\nRemove the supernatant of the cells-trypsin-DMEM-12 solution (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).",
    "Critical: Perform this step carefully to avoid aspirating the cells from the tube. Remove first using a 1000 μL pipette and then a 100 μL pipette.\nAdd the filtered GelMA or GelMA/Geltrex® into the -HUVEC- cells and dissociate the pellet with a slow up-down move.\nCritical: Perform this step carefully to avoid forming bubbles in the cell-bioink solution (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.2]). Cell aggregates or cell clumps can be formed, and in these cases, it is advised to use cell strainers before this step (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]).\nTransfer the cells-bioink (HUVEC-bioink) solution to a 5 mL sterile syringe (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).\nPipette the solution inside the syringe body.\nCarefully insert the syringe plunger.\nRemove all the bubbles formed during the process.\nNote: The user can use a 3-way adapter or a syringe luer cap to facilitate the cell-bioink solution transfer.\nAdd a 22G needle (without a bevel) to the syringe with the cell-bioink solution.\nNote: Some distributor sells this kind of needle as an irrigation needle. Another alternative is the use of plastic conical syringes.\nRepeat steps 34–39 for -A549 epithelial- cells to obtain the A549-bioink solution.\nTransfer the syringes with cell-bioink (HUVEC-bioink and A549-bioink) solutions to the refrigerator for 5 min before starting bioprinting.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S4.

    "Note: If possible, perform the bioprinting inside a flow chamber cabinet or reinforce safety precautions. The bioprinter used in this protocol has 710 × 465 × 600 mm (L x X x H), and due to this size, the bioprinting was performed in a culture room (Figure S18[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nTurn on the bioprinter and connect it to the computer using a USB cable (Figure S19[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nOpen the software to control the printer Pronterface.\nClick on the “House” box or digit “G28” in the command line to set zero for all coordinates.\nNote: Most RepRap printers require zeroing before printing, and without this step, the equipment does not recognize the reference coordinates.\nRetrieve the syringes with both cell-bioink from the refrigerator (Step 41).\nAt the left syringe holder, insert the syringe with cell-bioink solutions (HUVEC).\nCritical: The bioprinting was done outside a lamellar flow but in a controlled room. Therefore, we recommend only removing the needle protection when inserting a sterile petri dish below it. The petri dish used in this protocol has 1.4 mm of thickness; at this height, the needle faces the petri dish’s surface.\nAdjust its height to 1.4 mm using the following command line:\n“G1 X0 Y70 Z1.4 F3000”\nClick on “Send” to send the command to the bioprinter (Figure S20[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nNote: The bioprinter used in this protocol has a rotating screw that is used to precisely adjust the need of the petri dish surface (Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]).\nExtrude the bioink until it starts flowing from the needle to the petri dish.\nConfigure the “length” as “0.1” mm for better precision during this step.\nNote: Use higher values for the first approach of the plunger to the syringe. Use the reverse to put away the plunger from the syringe.",
    "Set up the next syringe at right holder-A549-bioink- by lifting the nozzle and setting the extruder 2 to the X-offset position. Use the command line to send the following commands:\nLift the syringe 25 mm by using the command:\n“G1 Z25 F3000”\nNote: After every command line is necessary to click the button “send”.\nTranslate the X-axis to the right syringe using the command:\n“G1 X-85 F3000”\nActive the extruder 2 by using the command:\n“T1”\nMove Z to touch the petri dish by using the command:\n“G1 Z1.4 F3000”\nRepeat step 47.\nLift the Extruder 2 and return to the position of step starting position (Extruder 1, HUVEC bioink) by using the following commands line:\nLift the syringe 25 mm by using the command:\n“G1 Z25 F3000”\nTranslate the X′ axis to the left syringe using the command:\n“G1 X0 F3000”\nActive the extruder 1 using the command:\n“T0”\nMove Z to touch the petri dish by using the command:\n“G1 Z1.4 F3000”\nLoad the Gcode file saved in step 20 of the Major step two section.\nClick on “Load” and select it.\nStart the bioprinting process by clicking on “Print”.\nNote: Each bioprinting cycle takes approximately 2–3 min (Methods videos S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9] and S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc10]).\nCritical: Expose the 3D HUVEC/A549 bioprinted construct to 5 min UV (2 mW/cm2) without the petri dish lid after each printing cycle. The photo-crosslinking efficiency depends on exposure time, the lamp’s intensity, and the distance of the light source to the sample. In this case, we performed UV intensity measurements using an ultraviolet meter.\nRetrieve the 3D HUVEC/A549 construct, cover it with a petri dish lid and store it in the refrigerator for 5 min.",
    "Critical: This bioink is very soft, and 5 min exposure to UV melts the non-gelified part a little. Therefore, this step aims to improve construct stability before adding cell media.\nInsert DMEM-F12 media at 37°C from the side of the petri dish and incubate the HUVEC/A54 bioprinted constructs in an incubator for 24 h (5% CO2, humidity of 90% and 37°C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Visual aspect of a 3D bioprinted scaffold\n(A) Representative image of a bioprinted scaffold.\n(B and C) (B) Optical micrographs of the bioprinting construct right after the bioprinting process, and (C) after 7 days under culture. Magnification 10×, scale bar 100 μm.\nNote: Each petri dish allows 3–4 HUVEC/A549 bioprinted samples; since the syringe axes are fixed, at every finished bioprinting, we only must move the petri dish into a different position to distribute new bioprinted samples (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nThe next day, with the aid of a sterile spatula, retrieve the scaffolds and transfer them to either a 24-well plate and add 1000 μL or to a Transwell® and add 500 μL to the bottom chamber of the well (5% CO2, humidity of 90% and 37°C).\nChange culture medium every 2–3 days.\nNote: Pipette gently as far as possible from the construct to reduce its decomposition. It is normal in long-term cultures that the constructs may degrade so that they can be decomposed if not properly crosslinked or sucked during pipetting. If the construct can be removed, check problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nNote: Transwell® inserts can be used to recreate the air-liquid barrier, transfer the sample with care using a spatula and, if necessary, use a 100 μL pipette to aid scaffold positioning inside the insert.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S7.

This size of petri dish was chosen because 2 mL originates samples with 1.8–2 mm thickness.\nLet it cool down at room temperature for 30 min for gelification.\nNote: This procedure is not adopted during bioprinting because the bioink becomes too viscous and hinders bioprinting. On the other hand, one can test the bioinks in a more stable condition, reducing errors related to measuring and during testing.\nExpose the sample to UV for 5 min. Perform this step without the lid (Figure S21[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Mmc1.extension]).\nNote: GelMA acquires a slightly light grey aspect due to the gelification and crosslinking process.\nWith the aid of a spatula, remove the photocured sample (Methods videos S10[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc11] and S11[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc12]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S10.

    "Note: Perform this step by holding the sample in hand (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nMeasure 3 points for diameter and height using a Digital Pachymeter.\nCalculate the average to insert into the mechanical test machine software.\nCritical: Be careful not to smash the samples during this process. The diameter will pretender lower variation due to the stamping process.\nInsert the sample between the plates and test it on 1 mm/min compression mode.\nSet zero compression force, touch the sample with the plate.\nApply a Preload force of 10 mN.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative stress x strain curve of a 4% GelMA hydrogel\nPoint “A” stands for the compression deformation at fracture.\nCritical: The preload applied is very important to reduce the reproducible results since if you start testing your sample without it, sometimes even a tiny gap difference may interfere with results. Be careful during the approach of the plate to the sample. Proceed with the test until 90% of the cell load or the sample fracture. Test at least five samples for each composition and analyze the data using Blue Hill software (compression modulus at different strains, compressive modulus, and strain at fracture, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nViability assay\nTiming: ∼1 h\nRetrieve HUVEC/A549 construct samples.\nTransfer them to a confocal dish with the aid of a spatula.\nWash the sample 1× with PBS (RT).\nDilute the Live/dead reagent at a proportion of 1:10 (v/v) with media.",
    "Note: Although the Live/dead protocol states adding the reagent at the top of the sample, we noticed that the dilution does not comprise the analysis and might help cell survival during analysis. Depending on the setup conditions, each image can take 2–10 min to be acquired. If the test is done using Transwell®, use a spatula to remove the samples from Transwell® to optimize the Live/dead reagent.\nAdd 100 μL of the Live/Dead solution and incubate at 37°C for 10 min.\nCritical: Protect samples from light until analysis, and seal them with parafilm to avoid drying.\nAnalyze them using 488 (green) and 594 (red) nm lasers for Calcein AM (488, alive) and Propidium Iodide (594, dead) at a confocal microscope.\nDetermine the cell viability.\nSplit the image into green -viable- and red -dead- channels.\nCalculate the area occupied by each channel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2923-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Live/dead assay after 1 day of culture\nScale bar 100 μm.\nNote: ImageJ® is one of the most accessible software to calculate image properties (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6])."
