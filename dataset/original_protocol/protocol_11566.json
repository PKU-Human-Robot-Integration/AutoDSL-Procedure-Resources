    "All procedures are conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Animal Care and Housing\nUpon arrival in the colony, house male Wistar rats weighing 200 - 225 g at arrival in pairs in a temperature (21 °C) and humidity-controlled environment with a reversed 12 h light-dark cycle.\n\tNote: Depending on the rationale of the experiments, rats may be single-housed.\nAllow the rats to acclimate to the vivarium and the light cycle for at least one week before starting an experiment and handle them daily. Weigh the animals once weekly.\nGive rats free access to chow and tap water for the duration of the experiment (water deprivation is not necessary to initiate responding12). Conduct all behavioral testing during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle in a dark testing room.\n\tNote: Although we routinely use young adult male Wistar rats (postnatal days 62 - 65), this protocol can theoretically be suitable for investigating other strains of rats, as well as sex and/or age differences.\n2. Operant Training\nConduct all behavioral training and testing in identical operant chambers measuring 30.5 × 29.2 × 24.1 cm and containing grid floors and waste pans lined with bedding (changed in between animals to reduce odor cues), housed in sound-attenuating cubicles equipped with exhaust fans for ventilation.\n\tNote: Rats are trained by operant-conditioning from day 1 of training (a response on a lever is necessary to obtain a reinforcer) between + 1 h and + 8 h of the dark cycle. There is no pre-exposure to alcohol, nor food or fluid shaping before alcohol training.\nEquip each operant chamber with stimulus lights, syringe pumps and two retractable levers positioned laterally to a liquid cup receptacle. Interface chambers and control by a computer using the appropriate software.",
    "Note: Most vendors will provide self-administration packages containing all the necessary components as well as software and interfaces necessary to control the chambers.\nWrite an operant-conditioning program that initiates the fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of 20% ethanol reinforcement (an operant schedule in which a response is reinforced only after a specified number of responses) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For example, in a fixed-ratio 1, rats have to produce one response to obtain a reinforcer (see the Supplemental Code Files section for an example of a FR1 program). Execute the following commands.\n\t\nExtend two levers to mark the onset of the session and to signal alcohol availability.\n\t\tNote: One lever press on the lever associated with ethanol (active) is rewarded by the delivery of a volume of 100 μL of 20% ethanol in water in the adjacent drinking well and initiates a concomitant 5-s time-out period signaled by the illumination of the cue-light above the lever. The cue-light is introduced on day 1 of the training.\nDuring the time-out period, record responding although it has no scheduled consequences. Record responses on the other lever (inactive) although they never have behavioral consequences. Note: The inactive lever serves as a control to assess non-specific behavior.\nRecord the number of responses on the active lever (response rates) and the number of 20% ethanol rewards earned.\nAfter 30 min have elapsed, retract the two levers to signal the end of the session and to signal the end of alcohol availability.\nSave and archive all data.\nBefore starting the training session, check the proper functioning of all devices in each operant chamber (retractable levers, fluid dispenser).\nPrepare the 20% v/v ethanol solution from 190 Proof (95%) ethanol diluted in tap water.",
    "Note: Ethanol solution can be kept at room temperature. Depending on the manufacturer, stock ethanol solutions may be up to 99.98%. Also note that, while in most published manuscripts, ethanol concentrations are usually presented as volume/volume, some may present them as weight/volume.\nFill the syringe with the 20% ethanol solution and make sure that there are no leaks or air bubbles in the infusion lines. Manually push a small volume of ethanol through the infusion lines to make sure that ethanol will be correctly delivered into the receptacle from the first reinforced response. Dry the receptacle with a paper towel and make sure that it is empty before starting the session.\nLoad the software that controls the FR schedule of 20% ethanol reinforcement\nTrain operant- and drug-naive rats under a FR1 schedule to self-administer 20% ethanol without water deprivation during 30 min sessions.\n\t\nTransport the rats from the vivarium to the testing room using a transport cage.\nAssign each rat to one chamber. Take each individual rat from the transport cage and put it in the assigned self-administration chamber.\nTry to keep the conditions of the experiment consistent each day. Therefore, always test rats in the same self-administration chamber at roughly the same time every day.\nStart the software that initiates the FR1 schedule of 20% ethanol reinforcement.\nAt the end of the session, remove the rats from the self-administration chambers and return them to the vivarium.\nIn order to manually confirm that the alcohol solution is consumed by the animals, use a paper towel and check if the receptacle is dried. Alternatively, use a 1 or 2 mL syringe and collect the fluid remaining in the receptacle to estimate the volume that is not consumed.",
    "Note: For a more precise measurement (but also more expensive), it is possible to equip each chamber with a lickometer system connected to the liquid cup receptacle that allows a precise count of the licks produced by the rats during the self-administration session.\nClean the walls and grid floor of each chamber with a surface disinfectant.\nAfter use, maintain the infusion lines by cleaning them with a 70% ethanol solution. When not in use, insert the cap to avoid mold and dust.\nAfter each session, collect and analyze the data generated. More particularly, calculate the mean number of active lever presses, the mean number of alcohol rewards obtained as well as the mean number of inactive lever presses.\n\tNote: In most papers, alcohol consumption is also presented as ethanol intake in g/kg (bodyweight). Ethanol intake can be calculated using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53305/53305equation1.jpg\n\tWith volume consumed (mL) - number of rewards earned ± unitary volume/reward and density of ethanol at room temp - 0.789 g/mL.\n\tFor example, if a rat weighing 400 g earned 20 rewards of 20% v/v ethanol solution:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53305/53305equation2.jpg\nConduct sessions 5/6 days a week until stabilization of performance (defined as a minimum of 15 sessions and no change greater than 15% in the total number of rewards earned during the last 3 sessions).\n\tNote: Once rats have reached a stable baseline on FR1, the operant conditioning program can be modified according to the manufacturer's instructions to increase the number of responses necessary to obtain an alcohol reward. The fixed-ratio can for example be increased to FR2 or FR3 in order to minimize accidental reinforcement.\nMeasure blood ethanol concentrations:",
    "To confirm that the rewards obtained in a self-administration session are consumed by the rats, measure the blood ethanol concentrations following self-administration. Once rats have reached a stable baseline, collect blood from the lateral tail vein immediately following the session. Insert a 23 G needle into the blood vessel and collect 50 µL blood samples using a capillary tube.\nTransfer the 50 µL blood samples to 10 mL headspace vials and add 50 µL of 1:1,000 isopropyl alcohol as internal standard. Prepare a standard curve 10 to 300 mg/dL from ethanol standards. Process samples with a headspace sampler with a chromatography column13 according to the manufacturer settings.\nProgressive ratio\n\t\nUse progressive ratio (PR) schedules to assess the motivation of the animals to consume a reward14. PR is an operant schedule in which the number of responses to obtain a reinforcer is increased gradually (in other terms, rats have to work harder for each successive reward).\n\t\tNote: Contrary to FR sessions, a PR session is not timed and will only be terminated once 30 min has elapsed without a completed ratio.\n\t\t\nPlace rats in their assigned operant boxes and allow them to respond for 20% ethanol under a PR schedule of reinforcement: Keep all experimental conditions identical to those used in the FR schedule (see step 2.3), except increase the response requirement or cost within-session (i.e., the number of lever presses required on the active lever to receive a single ethanol reward) according to the following formula: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32… Note: An example of the PR program is provided in the Supplemental Code Files section.\nTerminate the PR session once 30 min has elapsed without a reward.",
    "Note: The breakpoint is defined as the last completed response requirement during the PR session.\n3. Testing the Predictive Validity of an Operant Model of Alcohol Self-administration\nNote: Once rats have acquired a stable self-administration baseline (see step 2), it is possible to assess the predictive validity of the model by testing the efficacy of naltrexone, a currently FDA-approved medication for alcohol dependence in reducing 20% ethanol self-administration. We recommend doing this testing on the highest FR achieved during training (FR2), when responses are reliably high. Once predictive validity is established, the model can be used to evaluate new drug candidates.\nBefore test day, give rats subcutaneous saline injections 30 min prior to self-administration sessions to habituate them to the injection during a minimum of two consecutive self-administration sessions or until responding for ethanol is not affected by the saline injections (defined as no change greater than 15% in the total number of rewards earned during the last 2 sessions).\nDissolve naltrexone in saline and adjust the pH to reach neutrality to facilitate the injections to the animals. Inject the drug at a volume of 1.0 mL/kg 30 min before a session, using the subcutaneous route of administration. Note: The literature provides good evidence for a dose choice between the ranges of 0.1 - 1mg/kg, so 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg are used in this protocol.\n\tNote: Research indicates use of both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes of administration for naltrexone, though their potency may differ with subcutaneous injection being 30-fold more potent that intraperitoneal injections15. For this reason, we recommend using the subcutaneous route as the use of this route for the injection of naltrexone has been validated and replicated by various laboratories in a range of concentration between 0.1 and 1 mg/kg12,15,16.",
    "During test day, inject rats in a balanced/random order in a between-subjects design across one of the four naltrexone dosing cycles (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) 30 min before the self-administration session.\nBetween each dosing cycle, allow rats to washout the drug with a minimum of two consecutive self-administration sessions or until responding for ethanol is back to baseline. Note: As a result, at the end of the test, all rats have been injected with each of the four doses.\nAfter this phase, select the most efficient dose (1 mg/kg) and test the effect of naltrexone on the motivation of the animals to consume alcohol using a progressive ratio schedule (see step 2.12).\nSubscription Required.
