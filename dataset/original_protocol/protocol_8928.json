    "All experimental procedures involving animals were optimized to reduce animal suffering and were approved by the Commission for Animal Experimentation, University of Amsterdam, DEC protocol # DED204 and DED250.\n1. Coverslip Preparation\nCut down the coverslips to a size of 15 mm x 15 mm using a carbide or diamond scribe, so that they fit into the wells of a 12-well plate.\nWhile working in a fume hood, start coverslip coating by fully submerging coverslips in concentrated nitric acid solution (70% wt/wt) in a glass container. To ensure even distribution shake, then incubate for a minimum of 4 hr. It is possible to reuse the concentrated nitric acid solution for approximately 2 times, but it can loose color by exposure to light.\nRemove the concentrated nitric acid solution and wash the coverslips four times in distilled water for 30 min, carefully shaking after each wash.\nWith caution remove the water.\n\tNote: the next three steps are performed in a sterile laminar flow cabinet.\nSoak the coverslips in 96% EtOH. Remove the coverslips from the EtOH solution and let them dry.\nFlame the coverslips and put them in a glass container. Use fine forceps to handle the coverslips (Dumont style no.5 forceps for example).\nCover the container with aluminum foil and bake in a dry-heat oven for 12-16 hr at 180 °C. Baked coverslips can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month if covered tightly.\n2. Coverslip Coating\nThe coverslip coating procedure favors neuron attachment to the glass surface and dendritic arborization 14.\nIn a sterile laminar hood, use sterile small forceps to place the individual coverslips in single wells of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 500 μl of Poly-L-lysine solution (or sufficient amounts to submerge the coverslips).",
    "Wrap the plate in aluminum foil to prevent evaporation and leave it overnight at room temperature.\nBefore starting the culture, aspirate the Poly-L-lysine solution carefully in a sterile laminar hood.\nWash each well with 1 ml of sterile water twice, whilst preventing them to dry out.\nAspirate water completely, add 1 ml of plating medium and leave the coverslips in the tissue culture incubator until ready to plate the cells. It is recommended to plate the cells within 24 hr.\n3. Removal of Brains from E16-E19 Rat Embryos\nSterilize the surgical instruments by heating them in a dry sterilizer overnight or washing them with 70% EtOH. Dry thoroughly if EtOH is used.\nPrepare several 30 mm dishes with 1x HBSS buffer and keep them on ice.\nEuthanize the rat dam with an intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (160 mg/kg Euthasol in a volume of ± 0.4 ml).\nCheck for the absence of reflexes.\nSpray the dam's abdomen with 70% EtOH.\nMake an incision along the abdomen and remove the uterus.\nRemove the embryos from the uterus and place them in a 100 mm diameter petri dish.\nRemove the heads of the embryos with large scissors and place the heads in a new petri dish containing cold 1x HBSS buffer.\n\tNote: from here to step 7.1 the procedure is performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow cabinet.\nHold down the heads along the sides with big forceps.\nWith small scissors, make a sagittal cut in the skin on top of the head, then laterally peel the skin down with a large forceps.",
    "Use the same approach as in step 3.10 to remove the skull. Make a sagittal cut starting at the caudal end; gently opening the skull without damaging the brain tissue. Fold the two halves of the skull away laterally exposing the brain.\nWith the blunt spatula, scoop out the brain and place it in fresh cold 1x HBSS.\n4. Dissection of the Hippocampi\nIt is very important that the dissection is done as quickly as possible in sterile conditions to ensure cell viability. Keep the samples cold on ice.\nRemove and discard the cerebellum with the fine scissors.\nSeparate the two hemispheres of the brain by making a sagittal cut along the midline.\nTake each hemisphere and place both in a new 30 mm dish containing fresh cold 1x HBSS.\nPlace each hemisphere such that the temporal lobe faces the bottom of the dish.\n\tNOTE: From here on, it is recommended to use a dissecting microscope.\nGently hold the midbrain using a small forceps and remove the midbrain with another pair of forceps. Leave the remainder of the hemisphere intact containing the cortex and the hippocampus.\nTurn over the tissue, so that the hippocampus is now facing the bottom of the dish.\nGently hold the hemisphere in place with a fine forceps. By using another fine forceps, carefully and gently remove the meninges. It is easier to start at the olfactory bulb. Use caution so as not to damage the hippocampus.\nOrient the tissue so that the hippocampus is now facing up. The hippocampus can now be seen by its characteristic C-shaped structure.\nBy using fine forceps, dissect out the hippocampus. Collect it in a new 30 mm dish containing fresh cold 1x HBSS.\n5. Cell Dissociation and Plating",
    "Count the total number of hippocampi, then cut them into small pieces.\nCollect the pieces in a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing 3 ml 1x HBSS.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and carefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 6 μl Trypsin per hippocampus.\nIncubate for max 20 min at 37 °C. Swirl after 3 min.\nWash two times with 5 ml of fresh cold 1x HBSS and discard the supernatant.\nAfter the second wash, add 1.5 ml of plating medium, pre-warmed to 37 °C. The serum in the plating medium will inactivate Trypsin activity.\nSlowly triturate 30x with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette until all pieces of tissue are homogenously dispersed into single cells. Avoid any bubbling.\nAdd 5 ml of plating medium pre-warmed to 37 °C.\nCount cells using a Trypan blue vital staining.\nSeed 50,000 cells per well of a 12-well plate in 1 ml plating medium, prepared in Section 2 (total volume 2 ml).\nGently rock the plate to evenly distribute the cells.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 2-3 days, replace half of the plating medium (0.5 ml) with culture medium containing 10 µM FUDR.\n\tNote: Dendritic spine imaging is performed 16-17 days after plating (16-17 days in vitro, DIV).\n6. Rat Hippocampal Primary Neuron Transfection using Lipofectamine\nOn DIV 14-15 neurons are transfected using the following protocol:\nPrepare plasmid DNA expressing GFP and incubation medium (10 ml of Neurobasal medium with 100 μl of glutamax).\nPre-warm the incubation medium to 37 °C.\nPrepare DNA mix (Tube A). For each coverslip add 1 μg of DNA in 100 μl of plain Neurobasal medium. Gently mix.\nPrepare Lipofectamine mix (Tube B). For each coverslip add 2 μl Lipofectamine in 100 μl of plain Neurobasal medium. Gently mix.",
    "Add the Lipofectamine mix to the DNA mix dropwise.\nIncubate in the laminar flow hood for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 1 ml of pre-warmed incubation medium to plate 1.\nStore plate 2 for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nGently add dropwise 200 μl of the DNA/Lipofectamine mix to each well and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nWith the use of small forceps lift the coverslips containing the neurons and rinse them by dipping them in a 3 cm dish containing fresh warm Neurobasal medium and move them to plate 2.\nIncubate the transfected neurons at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 hr.\nCheck for transfection efficiency 24 hr after transfection.\n7. Immunostaining and Mounting of Rat Hippocampal Primary Neurons\nTo improve fluorescence intensity in transfected cells, perform an immunostaining protocol to enhance GFP detection 48 hr after transfection.\nPrepare 4% PFA and 0.05 M TBS.\nWarm the 4% PFA solution to 37 °C.\nGently aspirate the medium from the wells containing the coverslips.\nAdd 500 μl of warm 4% PFA carefully to prevent damaging the dendrites.\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash with 1x HBSS 3 times for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: at this point samples could be stored up to 3 weeks at 4 °C or immunostaining can be started immediately.\nIf samples were stored, wash with 0.05 M TBS 3 times for 5 min.\nBlock with TBS-BSA (1%) solution at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash with 0.05 M TBS 3 times for 5 min.\nAdd the primary antibody diluted in incubation mix.\nIncubate the plates for 1 hr at room temperature.\nFurther, Incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nRemove the primary antibody.\nWash with 0.05 M TBS 3x for 5 min.",
    "NOTE: from this point on, keep the coverslips protected from light.\nAdd the secondary fluorescent-conjugated antibody diluted in incubation mix.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2 hr.\nRemove the secondary antibody.\nWash with 0.05 M TBS 3 times for 5 min.\nWash with 1X TB 2 times for 5 min.\nUse fine tweezers to remove to coverslips from the wells.\nDry any excess of TB with a tissue and mount the coverslips using mounting medium.\nSeal with nail polish to prevent evaporation of mounting medium.\n8. Dendritic Spine Imaging using Structure Illumination Microscopy\nDendritic spine imaging using the SIM system described in the materials has a lateral resolution (XY) value of approximately 85-110 nm and an axial (Z) resolution value between 200 - 250 nm, providing a factor of 2 times improvement in resolution compared to wide-field microscopy.\nNOTE: Dendritic spine imaging using SIM is done typically 2 days after step 7.22, but could be done up to 3 weeks later if samples are kept in the dark and under a controlled temperature of 22 - 23 °C.\nTurn on the 488 nm laser, the mercury lamp, the stage controller, the piezo controller, the halogen lamp for transmitted light and the PC and start up the SIM software in the \"ANDOR for N-SIM\" mode.\nClean the 100x TIRF objective with 95% ethanol three times, and if necessary with petroleum ether.\nUse the following filter settings: 520 LP with a 488 dichroic.\nPut a drop of immersion oil on the objective. Check that there are no air-bubbles in the oil-drop. Move the objective upwards until the oil touches the sample.\n\tNote: Place a cover over the stage to protect the sample from ambient light and dim the lights in the room as much as possible.",
    "Set the correction collar of the objective to 37 °C, 200 µm, to obtain the best symmetry of PSF. In order to set the correct collar position, first position the objective ring at the optimal nominal position and then check a 100 nm bead sample. According to the best PSF's symmetry, slightly change the collar position around the nominal one.\nFor illumination, use 3D-SIM grating (3D 1layer 100X/1.49 all wavelengths). To begin the grating alignment place the selected grating block into the SIM illuminator, with the 100X 1.49 objective in place. Use a 100 nm bead sample mounted in media, with a concentration that can allow isolating 10-15 beads for a field of view (FOV). After setting the objective correction collar to the desired position, select the 3D-SIM illumination and start the software-guided alignment procedure. It will run (5 phases) x (1 direction) x (100 z-planes) images, from which it will reconstruct the FOV with beads. After selecting a single bead via an appropriate ROI, covering the entire bead including the out-of-focus blurred light, the software will start an automatic PSF fitting and it will adjust the grating position according to the result.\nTo check the performance of the microscope, repeat the grating alignment every 2 weeks, because of the possible misalignment caused by table movements and/or temperature drifting. Furthermore, also check the laser intensity and stability according to the manufacturer's suggestions.\nClean the sample surface with 95% ethanol three times.\n\tNote: For the next steps see figure 3 for an overview of the control panels and the correct settings within the SIM software.\nIn the SIM software, select the Optical Configuration Eye FITC and select an empty filter block in Turret 1 for visual inspection with white light.",
    "Set the focusing speed and the travel speed of the XY table to \"Fine\".\nOpen the shutter and quickly focus on the sample.\nClose the shutter again and set the Z-coordinate to zero.\nSelect the green filter in Turret 1 for visual inspection using the green channel.\nSet the intensity of the mercury lamp to the lowest setting.\nMove to the border of the sample carefully, making sure that the objective does not touch the sealant.\nOpen the shutter and quickly scan through the sample with the lowest possible intensity.\nUpon encountering a sufficiently bright dendrite of interest and centering a segment of interest in the field of view, close the shutter.\nSet the software to Optical Configuration 3D-SIM 488 and the camera settings to read-out mode EM, gain 1 MHz 16-bit, exposure time 100 msec, laser power 5% and EM gain 200.\n\tNOTE: Check that the green filter in Turret 2 is selected and that Turret 1 is empty.\nCheck that the grating is set to ‘Moving' and click Live to view the sample with laser light and through the camera.\nActivate the Look Up Table.\nCenter the object of interest if necessary and focus with the focusing speed set to Extra Fine.\n\tNOTE: in the read-out mode EM gain 1 MHz 16-bit, the target intensity for a good SIM image is between 30,000-45,000.\nQuickly adjust the camera settings to get an intensity value between 30,000-45,000 in the read-out mode EM gain 1 MHz 16-bit. Initially use:\n\t\nLaser power: 0% - 20% (with samples prepared as described above, 5% or 2.6 mW is sufficient)\nExposure time: 50 msec-2 sec\nRead-out mode: EM gain 1 MHz 16-bit\nEM gain: 0-300\nConversion gain: 1x - 5.1x\nFormat for Live: No binning\nFormat for Capture: No binning",
    "NOTE: with these settings 6.3% ± 1.3% bleaching is routinely achieved, within a 10% limit of acceptable maximum bleaching, which could significantly affect the image quality 15.\nClick Stop to turn off Live view.\nConfigure the settings of the 3D Z stack in the ND Sequence panel to:\n\t\nRange: 2 µm\nSet size: 120 nm\nZ plane\nClick Home position\nSelect the Optical Configuration 3D-SIM 488 in the Lambda section\nSelect 3D-SIM as the acquisition mode in the N-SIM pad.\nRun the ND Sequence acquisition and save the raw data.\nSelect the Optical Configuration Eye FITC again and repeat steps 8.15-8.27 until the entire sample has been imaged\n3D Image reconstruction: The data acquired in step 8.23 can either be reconstructed right away or later on. Start by reconstructing the Z stack with the default reconstruction settings in Reconstruct Slice or Reconstruct Stack mode and adjust if necessary.\n\tNOTE: for best results, Z stacks should be made with the indicated step size and reconstructed in Reconstruct Stack mode. Always check the validity of the reconstructed image by comparing it to the raw data or, preferably, a wide-field image. The parameters that can be adjusted for the reconstruction process are the contrast and high frequency noise suppression. Both of them influence how different raw image properties are taken into account during the reconstruction process. In case of low modulation depth raw data, the contrast parameter plays an important role. If the user has datasets with a low signal-to-noise ratio, then the high frequency noise suppression parameter can influence the reconstruction quality severely.\nWhen imaging in finished, center the XY stage and move the objective all the way down to its resting position.\nUnmount the sample and clean both the sample and objective with 95% ethanol.",
    "Shut down the software and the PC and switch off all other devices.\n3d reconstruction and spine classification of the acquired images can be carried out after converting the files to TIFF as described before using NeuronStudio software (see Figure 4) 16.\nUse the following parameters for reconstruction in the NeuronStudios software:\n\t\nVolume: Voxel dimensions: X: 0.03 μm; Y: 0.03 μm; Z: 0.120 μm.\nDendrite detection: Attach ratio: 1.3; Minimum length: 5 μm; Discretization Ratio: 1; Realign junctions: Yes.\nSpine detection: Minimum height: 0.2 μm; Maximum height: 5.001 μm; Maximum width: 3 μm; Minimum stubby size: 10 voxels; Minimum non-stubby size: 5 voxels.\nSpine Classifier: Neck ratio (head-neck ratio): 1.1; Thin ratio: 2.5; Mushroom size: 0.35 μm;\nNeuronStudio parameters used for rendering: Neurite vertex shape: solid eclipse; Neurite vertex color: by type; Neurite edge shape: line; Neurite edge color: single color; Spine shape: solid eclipse; Spine color: by type.\n\tNote: After 3D reconstruction is it also possible to set the volume render. The default threshold was set to 20 with the 'Regenerate volume rendering' option active. Opacity was set by 'Automatic Intensity' checked. 'Surface only' and 'Use Point Pre-Rendering' options were also active\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
