    "Generation of the transgenic CBRb mouse and all animal care and experiments associated with the study were approved by the Creighton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and performed by their guidelines.\n1. Transgenic CB-Myc6-Rb1 Construct\nNOTE: The cloning of CBRb into a pTet_Splice vector was done in a multi-step process (Figure 1A and 1B).\nPerform the first stage cloning into the pCS2+CB-Myc6 vector.\nTo create the CBRb transgene construct, amplify a 1583-bp-long Rb1 cDNA fragment (528 amino acids corresponding to the amino acid region 369–896) of the RB1 protein using the following primer set: for EcoRI+RB 1243F, use GGGGAATTCATTAAATTCAGCAAGTGATCAACCTTC, and for XbaI+EcoRV+RB 2826R, use CCCTCTAGATATCTATTTGGACTCTCCTGGGAGATGTTTACTTCC.\nClone the fragment generated (1546 bp) between the EcoR1 and XbaI restriction sites of the pCS2+CB-Myc6 vector as previously described1,12.\n\t\tNOTE: The 1012-bp-long CB-Myc6 construct (337 amino acids) fused to the Rb1 fragment resulted in a protein of approximately 865 amino acids (about 108 kDa), which is slightly smaller than the endogenous RB1 protein (~110 kDa) (Figure 1A), with a CB-Myc6 tag at the N-terminus and Rb1 at the C-terminus.\nPerform the second stage subcloning into the pTet-Splice vector.\nTo amplify the CB-RB-Myc6 fusion fragment and to gain the Tet-promoter, amplify the cassette, consisting of the CB-myc6-Rb1 using primers containing the EcoRV (XbaI+EcoRV+RB 2826R) and SalI sites: for SalI+CBF, use CCAGTCGACAGGATGTGGTGGTCCTTGATCCTTC.\nSubclone the fragment generated (2567 bp) into the pTet-Splice vector, between the SalI and EcoRV restriction sites, in such a way that the entire TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 transgene, including the SV40 intron and the PolyA signal, can be isolated through a single digestion with NotI (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: The NotI fragment was used to generate the transgenic funders.\n2. In Vitro Testing of the TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 Transgene\nDox-regulation: NIH3T3 cell line\nNOTE: Unless otherwise stated, all volumes have been adjusted for a 6-well plate.",
    "Grow NIH3T3 cells following the vendor's specifications, using the recommended cell culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 10% CO2.\nCotransfect the cells with pTet-Splice and pCMV-Tet3G vectors (from step 1) for 24 h. Follow the steps mentioned below for cotransfection.\n\t\t\nMix 2–4 µL of the lipid-based transfection reagent/well and 1 mL of incomplete (without serum) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 5 min at room temperature. For a 12- or 24-well plate, use 250 or 500 µL of culture media, respectively, and adjust the transfection reagent volume accordingly.\nAdd 2–3 µg of plasmid DNA/well to the transfection reagent-DMEM and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd the mix containing DNA and the transfection reagent in DMEM to each well. After 3–4 h of incubation, add 1 mL of complete media (so that the final volume is 2 mL/well). Keep aliquots of Dox stock (1 mg/mL) and add 2 µL in each of the wells (+ Dox). Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nNOTE: Control samples should consist of cotransfected cells not treated with Dox (- Dox), as well as NIH3T3 cells transfected only with the transactivator pCMV-Tet3G vector and treated with Dox for a 24 h period. For pCMV-Tet3G, concentrations of 0.1–1 µg/mL Dox should be sufficient to induce the transgene expression.\nTest the reversibility of the construct using the HEK293 cell line.\nTo test the reversibility of the TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 transgene, culture HEK293 cells in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) following the vendor's specifications and cotransfect with both pTet-Splice and pCMV-Tet3G vectors for 24 h, as described above (step 2.1.2).\nFor the transgene inactivation, remove the Dox-containing media after 24 h, wash the cells 2x–3x with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubate them in Dox-free media for an additional 24 h.",
    "NOTE: Upon Dox-removal, the transgene inactivation and regular protein expression should be resumed within that 24 h period.\nTo assess the functionality of the TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 construct in promoting unscheduled cell proliferation, perform the functional analyses using an HEI-OC1 cell line, as described below.\nCulture HEI-OC1 cells in 10% DMEM under permissive conditions (33 °C with 10% CO2). For cell proliferation studies, count the cells using a cell counter, and plate 10,000 HEI-OC1 cells on a 96-well plate in a 200 µL volume. Incubate the cells overnight.\nOn the following day, perform a transient cotransfection of pTet-Splice and pCMV-Tet3G vectors using a lipid-based transfection reagent (see steps 2.1.2). In a separate well, perform pmR-ZsGreen1 transfection at2-µg using the lipid-based transfection reagent (steps 2.1.2) to calculate the transfection rate. Use non-transfected cells as controls.\nDetect the presence of green fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm) for the transfected cells 24 h after transfection. Record the presence or absence of green fluorescence and calculate the rate of transfection as the total number of GFP-positive cells (transfected cells) over the cells labeled with DAPI (total cells).\nNOTE: We estimated a transfection rate of ~70%.\nTo induce transgene expression, add 1 µg/mL Dox to a subset of transfected cells while using the other subset as control (-Dox). Use untreated HEI-OC1 cells as additional controls.\nTo assess cell proliferation, use a cell proliferation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\t\nIn brief, 48 h after transfection, remove the cell culture medium and add 100 µL of 1x dye-binding solution to each well of the microplate. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nThereafter, measure the fluorescence intensity of each sample using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 530 nm).",
    "To further assess cell proliferation using immunocytochemistry, plate the HEI-OC1 cells on a cover glass in a 12-well plate and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n\t\t\nOn the following day, cotransfect with the pTet-Splice and pCMV-Tet3G and perform the Dox treatment (+ Dox). Use untransfected cells as controls. Process HEI-OC1 cells for Ki-67 labeling.\nFix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature. Wash the cells 3x with ice-cold PBS and incubate the cells in 0.25% non-ionic detergent in PBS for 10 min.\nWash the cells again, 3x in PBS for 5 min, and block using 10% serum in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate the cells in 500 µL of Ki-67 primary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the cells 3x for 5 min with PBS. After that, incubate the cells with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and wash the cells 3x with PBS for 5 min each in the dark.\nFor phalloidin labeling, incubate the HEI-OC1 cells in 1:200 phalloidin for 30 min. To label the nuclei of cells, incubate the cells with 5 µg/mL DAPI for 10 min at room temperature.\nNOTE: Ensure that the phalloidin dye conjugate is different than the secondary antibody conjugate.\n3. Generation of CBRb+/ROSA-CAG-rtTA+ (CBRb) Transgenic Mice and In Vivo Testing of the DN-CBRb Approach\nUpon confirmation of the effective Dox regulation of the TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 transgene, purify the NotI fragment and microinject them into mouse zygotes, which are later transferred into pseudo-pregnant females.\nNOTE: These procedures were carried out at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) Mouse Genome Engineering Core Facility.",
    "After delivery, genotype the pups using a primer set specific to the CB-Rb1 fusion region: for CBRb F, use 5' CTGTGGCATTGAATCAGAAATTGTGGCTGG 3′, and for CBRB R, use 5′ GTACTTCTGCTATATGTGGCCATTACAACC 3′.\nNOTE: The PCR product size observed on agarose gel is 401 bp (60-bp CB region + 341-bp Rb1 region (Table 1). Ten independent founder lines were identified, based on the presence of the TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 transgene. In five of these lines, progeny inherited the transgene, which confirmed the germline transmission of the transgene. One of the transgenic lines was ultimately used to establish and maintain the line and generate experimental TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 animals for further studies.\nBreed adult TetO-DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 mice to the ROSA-CAG-rtTA tetracycline inducer line (Stock #006965) (alternatively, breed to a tTA inducer line) to generate experimental DN-CBRb mice. Genotype the offspring of this cross using the following primer set: for rtTA-WT R, use GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG; for rtTA Mutant R, use GCGAGGAGTTTGTCCTCAACC; and for rtTA Common, use AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT. The PCR product sizes are 340 bp (mutant), 340 bp and 650 bp (heterozygote), and 650 bp (wild-type).\nGenerate a dose-response curve of the RB1 protein following the Dox treatment to determine the time and length of the Dox treatment necessary to elicit a transgene expression.\nNOTE: In this experiment, western blot and qRT-PCR were used to assess tissue-specific transgene activation and RB1 expression.\nPerform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the genomic insertion of the transgene.\nNOTE: This was carried out at the Centre for Applied Genomics of the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). ELISA or western blotting (using protein-specific antibody) can be used to assess transgene activation, tissue-specificity, and changes in the levels of the endogenous POI. For the DN-CB-myc6-Rb1 construct, we used an anti-RB1 antibody.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
