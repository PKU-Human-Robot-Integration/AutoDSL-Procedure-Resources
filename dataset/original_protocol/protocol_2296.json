Homogenize carefully the sample.\nNote: If the isolation cannot be performed right after blood drawn, the blood can be kept at room temperature for a maximum of 8 h on a rocker.\nCarefully layer the diluted blood sample on Ficoll.\nCritical: When layering the sample do not mix it with Ficoll but slowly dispense it on top of the Ficoll volume.\nCentrifuge at 750 g for 20 min at room temperature, with the brake off.\nRemove as much of the plasma (upper yellow layer) as possible using a 10 mL pipette,\nCritical: Removing of the plasma should be done leaving the PBMCs layer (whitish ring) undisturbed at the interface between the plasma and the Ficoll.\nGently harvest the PBMC ring and transfer the cells in a new 50 mL Falcon: Add 30 mL of RPMI. Centrifuge at 550 g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the PBMCs in 10 mL of RPMI. Count the cells and centrifuge at 750 g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in FBS/DMSO (90:10) at 10 million cells/mL. Distribute the cells in cryotubes between 5 to 10 million per cryotube and freeze at −80°C.\nNote: After 3 days at −80°C, cells can be transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nErythroblast proliferation\nTiming: 10 days",
    "This section describes all the steps to obtain a culture composed at more than 90% of CD71+ CD36+ cells ready for reprogramming. This step of the protocol is based on a previous study by van den Akker et al. (van den Akker et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nOn day 0, thaw 10 million of frozen human PBMCs in PBS + FBS 20%.\nCentrifuge 5 min, 300 g at room temperature. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells by performing up-and-downs with a pipette in 1.5 mL of Erythroblast medium.\nTransfer the cells into one well of a low-binding 24-well plate.\nIncubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 1, add 500 μL/well of Erythroblast medium, gently resuspend the cells with a 1000 μL pipette to homogenize the culture and split into two wells (1 mL/well). Add another 500 μL of Erythroblast medium per well. Incubate the cells at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 4, sort CD71+ cells by MACS. This procedure is performed using CD71 microbeads (Miltenyi) as described in the Manufacturer’s instructions: link[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001286.PDF]. Briefly:\nHarvest all the cells and centrifuge 5 min at 300 g at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 240 μL in MACS buffer. Add 60 μL of CD71 Miltenyi microbeads. Incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nAdd 6 mL of MACS buffer. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 g at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nInsert the MACS column into the MACS separator magnet. Wash column with 500 μL of MACS buffer. Add the 500 μL of CD71 labeled cells into the column. Wash with 3× 500 μL of MACS buffer.",
    "Remove the MACS column from the separator magnet and place it in a 15 mL Falcon collection tube. Add 1 mL of MACS buffer into the MACS column, immediately flush out positive fraction by firmly applying the plunger onto the column. Collect the flow through (CD71+ cells fraction). Centrifuge the positive fraction 5 min at 300 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of Erythroblast medium (you should obtain about 500′000–1′000′000 cells). Transfer into a new well of a low-binding 24-well plate. Incubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2.\nNote: During the MACS procedure. Supernatant can be discarded by inverting the Falcon tube and cells are resuspended first by flicking the tube with a finger and then by up-and-down pipetting.\nOn day 5, resuspend erythroblasts by gentle flushing. Incubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 6, if confluence is high (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B), resuspend the cells and split into two wells (500 μL/well). Add 1 mL/well of Erythroblast medium. If confluence is not high (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D), carefully remove 500 μL of medium (do not shake to plate, the cells must stay at the bottom of the well for medium removal) and add 1 mL of Erythroblast medium. Resuspend the cells to distribute them evenly in the well and incubate the cells at 37°C 5% CO2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1902-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Confluence of erythroblasts post sorting\n(A and B) Pictures A and B (different zoom) show representative cultures of confluent erythroblasts forming many clusters. These cells need to be split into two wells on day 6.\n(C and D) Pictures C and D (different zoom) show representative cultures of non-confluent erythroblasts forming a few clusters that do not need to be split on day 6. Scale bar: 200 μm.\nOn day 8, repeat step 13.",
    "Critical: By day 11, more than 90% of cells should be double positive for CD71 and CD36 and confluence should be good (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). We routinely obtain more than 95% double positive cells but reprogramming can be carried on with a purity of 90% (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). The enrichment of this population needs to be assessed by flow cytometry before proceeding to reprograming. Cells are resuspended by up and down pipetting, counted and around 150,000 cells are co-labeled with anti-CD71-PE and anti-CD36-FITC antibodies (standard flow cytometry staining procedure (Perriot et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])). Cells are then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. While performing the purity check, erythroblasts should be kept in culture in the incubator. If percentage is lower than 90%, the culture can be prolonged in the same medium up to day 15 (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1902-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars: 100 μm.\nErythroblast reprogramming\nTiming: 21 days",
    "This section describes the different steps to obtain hiPSCs from erythroblasts: electroporation of erythroblasts, culture until appearance of hiPSC clones and picking of these clones. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for a general timeline. These steps are based on the original publications by Chou et al. (Chou et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and Okita et al. (Okita et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nStep 15 directly follows the purity check by flow cytometry if the purity of erythroblasts is >90%.\nOn day 11, perform electroporation of erythroblasts with the episomes allowing cell reprogramming. Before starting the procedure, coat 3 wells of a 6-well plate with Matrigel.\nPrepare the reagents for electroporation:\nAdjust the concentration of the plasmids pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK and pCXLE-hUL to 1 μg/μL.\nMix the three plasmids together by adding 2 μL of each plasmid.\nPrepare the nucleofection mix using the solutions from the Human CD34+ Nucleofector kit (Lonza) as followed: 82 μL of nucleofection solution + 18 μL of supplement.\nResuspend and count the erythroblasts.\nCollect 1 million erythroblasts and centrifuge 5 min at 300 g at room temperature. Completely remove the supernatant. Freeze the remaining erythroblasts as described in step 7 for PBMCs.\nResuspend the cell pellet with the nucleofection mix (100 μL) and add the 6 μL of plasmid mix. Homogenize by up-and-down pipetting (avoid bubble/foam formation).\nTransfer cell suspension into the sterile cuvette provided with the Nucleofector kit and close the cuvette with the lid. The cell suspension must cover entirely the bottom of the cuvette without air bubble.\nSelect the Nucleofector program T-016 (CD34+ cells program).\nInsert the cuvette into the Amaxa Nucleofector and start the T-016 program.\nRemove the cuvette. Foam must be visible on the surface of the mix indicating the electric shock happened.",
    "Add 500 μL of erythroblast medium to the cuvette and transfer cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube. Avoid repeated aspiration of the sample and bubble formation.\nUse 500 μL of erythroblast medium to rinse the cuvette and add it to the cell suspension. Add 5 mL of erythroblast medium and distribute 2 mL of cell suspension in each Matrigel-coated well of the 6-well plate. Incubate at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 13, carefully add 1 mL of erythroblast medium on the side of the well without removing medium from the plate not to disturb cells. Incubate at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 14, carefully add 1 mL of ReproTeSR medium on the side of the well without removing medium from the plate not to disturb cells. Incubate at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOn day 16, repeat step 19.\nOn day 17, remove all the medium and slowly add 2 mL of ReproTeSR medium. Incubate at 37°C 5% CO2.\nNote: The erythroblasts frozen at this stage can be used for restarting the procedure in case of failure or to be used as reference for assessing cellular identity (see quality control section). Thawing of erythroblasts should be done as described in step 8.\nCritical: This medium change should be as gentle as possible to avoid detachment of erythroblasts from the plate. At this stage, some cells should start to adopt a morphology similar to epithelial or mesenchymal cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nFrom day 18 onward, change medium everyday as in step 21.\nNote: During the next seven days, reprogramming will continue to occur and newly generated hiPSCs will proliferate. Once hiPSCs are densely clustered together and form an identifiable colony (or clone) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D), they can be individually picked to generate an independent hiPSC line (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).",
    "Human iPSC clones are picked between day 25 and 32 depending on the emergence of hiPSC colonies. Before starting hiPSC picking, coat one 35 mm dish with Matrigel for each clone to be picked. Once coating is done, remove the Matrigel solution.\nAdd 2 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF medium supplemented with Y-27632 (10 μM).\nScrap the chosen hiPSC clone with a 200 μL micropipette and aspirate the clumps as you detach them.\nTransfer the clumps to a 35 mm dish.\nName the newly generated hiPSC line with unique ID. Cells are now at passage 1.\nNote: Once a clone is picked and transferred to an individual 35 mm dish, it generates an independent clonal hiPSC line. Each hiPSC line should have a unique cell identifier. We suggest following the recommendations from the European Bank for induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC) (Kurtz et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The proposed format is as followed: XXXXXXi000-A.\n“XXXXXX” (combination of 2–6 capital letters) for the origin of the line (institute or lab).\n“i” for hiPSC lines or “e” for embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines.\n“000” (numerical 3-digit code) for the donor ID.\n“A” (capital letter) for the clone number.\nWash 3 times with PBS the well in which you just picked the hiPSC clone and add 1 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF medium.\nRepeat steps 16 and 17 individually as many times as needed to generate several lines.\nCritical: Human iPSC clones from one well of the 6-well plate should all be picked the same day to avoid picking twice the same clone.\nCritical: The picking procedure is to be done with extreme caution as you have to work over the wells without any antibiotics. Be very careful to avoid as much as possible passing over the wells in order to prevent from contamination.",
    "Note: Several hiPSC lines should be generated per donor to ensure that any phenotype observed in downstream experiments is the reflection of an intrinsic feature coming from the donor and not a byproduct of the reprogramming procedure that would be unique to a given hiPSC line regardless of the donor. Usually, at least two lines per donor are recommended when comparing groups of donors (e.g., patients vs healthy donors).\nHuman iPSC amplification and cell banking\nTiming: 21 days\nThis section describes how to amplify hiPSCs and bank them prior use for downstream experiments.\nThe day following hiPSC picking, remove the medium of individual clones and add 2 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF medium.\nRepeat step 26 every day from Mondays to Thursdays. On Fridays, add 3.5 mL of StemMACS iPS-Brew XF medium instead of 2 mL. The medium does not need to be changed during the weekend.\nOnce the cells have reached about 80% confluence, passage them as followed:\nRemove the culture medium.\nWash with 1 mL of PBS without Mg2+ Ca2+\nAdd 1 mL of ReLeSR solution and incubate for about 3–5 min. Monitor the detachment process under the microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The edges of the colonies should have retracted and some holes formed within the colony (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1902-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative pictures of hiPSC morphology during passaging\n(A) hiPSC colony before passaging.\n(B) hiPSC at the end of the incubation time (3–5 min) with the ReLeSR solution. Colonies exhibit retracted edges with refolding (arrows) as well as holes in the center (asterisks).\n(C) Detached hiPSC clumps (arrows) of the right size for plating (100–200 μm). Scale bar: 200 μm.\nCarefully remove ReLeSR solution from the dish.",
    "Add 1 mL of Complete StemMACS™ iPS-Brew medium and gently spill it on the cells. Perform a second gentle spilling on the cells. This procedure will result in detachment of hiPSCs from the plate and generates hiPSC clumps of 100–200 μm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nHarvest the cells in a Falcon tube and complete the volume of Complete StemMACS™ iPS-Brew medium to seed at a splitting ratio of 1:8 to 1:10 (2 mL of medium per dish).\nPlate the cells in 35 mm dishes and transfer the 35 mm dishes to the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Once in the incubator, move the dishes left to right and back and forth to ensure homogenous repartition of the clumps in the dish.\nChange the medium the day after passage and routinely as in step 27.\nNote: Some hiPSCs will not detach from the plate and will thus not be harvested. In particular, differentiated cells or colonies containing differentiated cells along with hiPSCs should not detach with this procedure. It is advised not trying to detach them, in order to keep a hiPSC culture as pure as possible, without differentiated cells.\nCritical: The optimal seeding density should be determined empirically after several trials. A too high seeding density or poor clump repartition will result in higher differentiation. Usually, a 35 mm dish, which is confluent at 80% can be split up into 10 new dishes.\nCells should be amplified for at least three weeks to ensure the stabilization of the cell line and episome fading.\nPause point: Human iPSCs can be frozen at this point (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). For logistic reasons, we recommend to select four lines per donor to move forward with quality controls and to freeze the remaining lines early as backup in case of quality control failures.",
    "For freezing, harvest hiPSCs from one dish as described in step 28. a to e.\nHarvest the entire clump suspension and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend in 2 mL of Cryostor and divide them into four cryotubes, with 500 μL per cryotube.\nFreeze at −80°C. After 3–7 days at −80°C, cells should be transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nFor cell thawing, quickly thaw the cell suspension at 37°C. The medium should not be completely thawed to increase cell survival.\nAdd 0.5 mL of StemMACS™ iPS-Brew medium to the vial.\nHarvest the cells without up and down and transfer them into 4 mL of StemMACS™ iPS-Brew medium.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 g at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 mL of StemMACS™ iPS-Brew medium supplemented with Y-27632 (10 μM).\nDistribute 2 mL per 35 mm Matrigel-coated dish and incubate at 37°C. The next day, change the medium and continue cell culture as described above.\nHuman iPSC quality controls\nTiming: 3 weeks\nPrior to downstream use, hiPSCs need to pass several quality controls (QCs) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). These controls are part of the good practices for hiPSC research as described by the EBiSC (Steeg et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sullivan et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). These QCs are absolutely necessary to ensure of the good quality of the hiPSCs. They have been regrouped in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1902-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(C) Full pluripotency was monitored by immunofluoresence staining of pluripotency markers (SOX2, OCT4, Tra-1-60) (in red). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (in blue). Scale bars: 200 μm. Pictures were acquired with inverted microscope Axiovision Observer.Z1.\n(D) After differentiation of hiPSC into embryoid bodies (EB), the capacity of hiPSC to form the three embryonic germ layers was assessed by IF staining with one marker per germ layer (green): ectoderm (PAX6), endoderm (AFP) and mesoderm (SMA). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars: 200 μm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1902_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1902_7.csv\nTo generate embryoid bodies in order to assess the pluripotency of hiPSCs, follow the procedure below.\nRemove hiPSC medium from one 35 mm dish at 80% confluence.\nAdd 1 mL of accutase.\nIncubate until the edges of the hiPSC colonies start retracting (similar to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nRemove accutase and add 2 mL of DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nCarefully scrap the hiPSC colonies using a cell lifter taking care of keeping the cells as clumps.\nTransfer the hiPSC clumps into 1 well of a low-binding 6-well plate.\nThe next day, EB should have formed. Split them into 2 wells of a low-binding 6-well plate and add 1 mL of DMEM/F-12 + 20% FBS to each well.\nPerform 2/3 of medium change every 2–3 days for 8 days.\nOn day 10 after EB formation, plate the EBs on Matrigel. At this stage, EB should have a round or oblong morphology with size between 300–600 μm.\nContinue the culture by changing the medium every 2–3 days.\nAfter 14 days, fix the cells with PFA 4% for 10 min at room temperature. Wash 3 times with PBS and stain the EBs for assessing the expression of the markers from the three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm (Pax6), mesoderm (SMA) and endoderm (AFP))."
