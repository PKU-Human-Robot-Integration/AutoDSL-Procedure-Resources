    "Note: Animals are trained on a relevant behavioral paradigm. For our experiments we used a motor forelimb reaching task (Padmashri et al., 2013). The technique described may be adopted to evaluate synaptic changes in any brain region relevant to a specific behavioral paradigm. Synaptosome preparationPrepare fresh artificial cerebrospinal fluid (1x ACSF) and bubble with aerobic air mixture at room temperature for at least 15 min.Prepare a 4 mM MgSO4 ACSF (high Mg2+ ACSF) and keep in an ice bath with constant bubbling. Anesthetize the animal using isoflurane gas and euthanize by decapitation.Make a sharp incision through the skin on top of the skull. Separate the skin from the bone.Make a straight incision from the Foramen Magna to the top of the skull. Separate out the two sections of the skull to expose the brain.Wash the brain with about 1 ml cold High Mg2+ ACSF.Isolate the brain and lay out transversely (Figure 1C). Cut off the cerebellum and the olfactory bulb (Figure 1D). Stand the brain on the caudal side and cut out the ventral portion of the brain (Figure 1E). Glue the caudal portion of the brain on the vibratome plate using a rectangle piece of agar as support (Figure 1F). Make sure the brain is submerged under ice cold High Mg2+ ACSF during slicing (Figure 1G). High Mg2+ ACSF is used as this prevents excitotoxicty to neurons by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Make thin coronal sections until the corpus callosum from the two hemispheres join (Figure 1H). Then make two 750 micrometer coronal sections which now contain the primary motor cortex M1 (1 mm anterior and 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma and 0.75 to 2.5 mm lateral).Incubate the slices in a submersion chamber in ACSF at room temperature for 1 h with constant bubbling.",
    "After incubation, place the brain slice on a petri dish under ASCF and constant bubbling at room temperature. Use a blade to isolate the forelimb region of primary motor cortex by making cuts 0.75 and 2.5 mm lateral to the midline (Figure 1I).Place the brain tissue into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 300 µl of 0.32 M sucrose media 1 (see Recipes) containing protease inhibitor (1 tablet in 50 ml of media).Homogenize with a hand held homogenizer for one minute with up and down movements. Spin down the homogenized sample at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 ºC. The pellet obtained contains nuclear and cellular debris and is discarded.Collect the supernatant which contains suspended synaptosomes and spin at 13,500 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet obtained is the required synaptosomal preparation. Note: The preparation obtained is an approximately 70% enriched preparation of synaptosomes. The preparation has contamination with mitochondria and debris from endoplasmic reticulum organelles. To prepare a more purified form of synaptosomes this preparation will have to be passed through a sucrose or percoll gradient and has not been described in this protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150215/20150215174710_2724.jpgFigure 1.

Electron microscopy image of a synaptosome with pre and postsynaptic component obtained from the protocol described (scale bar 1 micrometer) To evaluate synaptic GluA1 changesAspirate out the supernatant from step A14.Re-suspend the pellet in 200 µl of RIPA lysis buffer.Lyse the preparation by sonication on ice (no post lysis spin required as the cellular debris is insignificant).Estimate the protein levels by relevant protein estimation protocols (BCA assay from Pierce).Run the protein lysates using a standard western blotting technique. We have run 20 microgram of protein for our experiments.",
    "To immunoblot use Millipore anti GluA1 at 1:1,500 dilution as primary antibody and Cell signaling anti-rabbit HRP as secondary antibody at 1:5,000 dilution."
