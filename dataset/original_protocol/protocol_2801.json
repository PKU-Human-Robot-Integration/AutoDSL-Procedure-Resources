    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nGeneration of Human Fibroblasts\nHuman fibroblasts can be isolated from human heart tissue or differentiated from a human embryonic stem cell line. The choice of which avenue to collect human cardiac fibroblasts depends largely on availability and research purpose. Human specimens are rare, and their collection requires either the use of available repositories or a medical-school collaboration. In this protocol we acquired human cardiac tissue from the Duke Human Repository and isolated human cardiac fibroblasts using the below described protocol. Of note, primary cardiac fibroblasts are the target cells of our interest as direct cardiac reprogramming aims to regenerate cardiomyocytes in situ.\nAlternatively, human fibroblasts can be easily and largely generated from a human embryonic stem cell line. Therefore, it would be a better choice to use them if large quantities of cells are required for experiments like screening. In this protocol, we acquired previously differentiated H9F fibroblasts from the lab of Jidong Fu. We briefly summarize this protocol below. Please see Fu et. al. (2013)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for further details on H9F derivation from the H9 human embryonic stem cell line.\nIsolation of Human Cardiac Fibroblasts from Heart Tissue\nTiming: 8 Days\nPrepare a 10-cm gelatin coated plate: Coat a 10-cm tissue culture plate with 0.1% gelatin. Incubate the plate for 15-30 min in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.\nAfter incubation, carefully aspirate the gelatin without touching the bottom of the plate and replace with 2 mL of pre-warmed HCF medium.\nWash the human heart tissue with PBS for several times to remove blood.\nMince the adult human heart tissue into small aggregates (∼1mm3) using a sterile razor blade.\nTransfer the tissue aggregates to the prepared 10-cm gelatin coated plate containing 2 mL of HCF medium.",
    "Critical: After 4 hours of incubation, add 8 ml of warm HCF medium slowly and carefully along the wall of the plate to not disturb the attached aggregates (Video S1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n            \nVideo S1. Careful Application of Media to Culture Plate\nCarefully aspirate the media without touching the bottom of the plate. Media can then be added by one of two methods (1) by leaning the pipette against the side of the tissue culture plate wall or (2) by touching the pipette tip against the wall of the tissue culture plate and allowing the media to gently cover the cells. For both techniques slowly and gently expel the media from the pipette. Leave a little bit of media in the pipette tip to prevent expelling the last bit of media too forcefully.\nIncubate for several days (∼7 days) to allow for explant culture and cell migration. (see Troubleshooting 1)\nWhen the cells reach 100% confluency, dissociate the explanted cardiac fibroblasts into single cells by adding 2 – 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin to the 10-cm plate, and incubate for 5 min at 37°C (see Troubleshooting 2).\nAdd 5 mL of HCF medium to inactivate the trypsin and mix well by gently pipetting up and down using a 5 mL pipette.\nStrain the cell solution through a 40 μm cell strainer.\nCollect the flow through and pellet the cells by centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nCritical: 1 x 106 of cells can then be plated on a gelatin precoated plate (see Troubleshooting 3 & 4).\nPause Point: Alternatively, cells may be stored at −80 °C for short-term storage or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage until later use. Freeze cells in 10% DMSO/FBS.",
    "Alternative Method: Differentiation of Fibroblasts from H9 Human Embryonic Stem Cells\nTiming: 3 Weeks\nIn this protocol, we used H9 cells that were cultured with mTeSR1 on one plate of a 6-well plate at 80%–90% confluency for further differentiation.\nPrewarm 6 mL of Dispase in a 37°C water bath for 10 min.\nRemove mTeSR1 from the well and rinse with 1 mL/well of DMEM/F12.\nAdd 1 mL per well of warm Dispase and incubate at 37°C for 7 min.\nDiscard Dispase and rinse with 1 mL/well of DMEM/F12 twice.\nAdd 1 mL per well of mTeSR1 and gently scratch the well with a 1 mL pipette.\nRepeat step 15 with another 1 mL/well of mTeSR1 to avoid over pipetting.\nPellet cell aggregates by centrifuge at 50 x g for 3 min\nCarefully resuspend aggregates with H9F medium and transfer into low attachment 10-cm Petri dish.\nAllow embryoid bodies to form during culture for seven days. Change the medium every other day.\nAfter seven days, plate the embryoid bodies onto a gelatin-coated tissue culture plate containing H9F medium to facilitate the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts. (See Troubleshooting 5).\nSplit the cells every four – five days to maintain 80% confluence.\nAfter 2 weeks the cells are ready for use.\nPause Point: Alternatively, the cells may be frozen down in 1:10 mixture of DMSO/FBS at a density of 1 x 106. The cells may be stored at −80 °C for 2-3 weeks or transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage until use.\nPreparation of the Reprogramming Viruses",
    "The hMGT133 protocol has been tested with both retroviral and lentiviral packaging (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Retrovirus hMGT will infect only mitotically active cells. Whereas lentiviral hMGT will infect both non-dividing and actively dividing cell types, enabling the infection of a greater variety of cell types than retroviruses. The user should decide which type of viral packaging would be best to suit their desired cell type and outcomes. The protocol for both types of viral packaging is described below (see Troubleshooting 6).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/25-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Four hMGT Plasmid Variations to Choose from Depending on Experimental Needs\n(A) A retrovirus polycistronic hMGT construct.\n(B) A polycistronic hMGT lentiviral construct based off of the pll3.7 backbone (gifted from the lab of Qing Zhang), where hMGT is driven by a UBC promoter and puromycin is driven by an Ef1α promoter.\n(C) A polycistronic hMGT lentiviral construct based off of the pll3.7 backbone, in which hMGT is driven by CAG and puromycin selection is driven by an EF1α promoter.\n(D) A polycistronic hMGT lentiviral construct based off of the pLenti-GFP backbone (Addgene, cat. no. 17448), in which hMGT is driven by an Ef1α promoter and puromycin selection is driven from a PGK promoter.\nTiming: 5-6 Days\nOn day 0, coat a 10-cm tissue culture plate with 1x poly-L-lysine and incubate for 5-10 min at 20 to 25°C (see Troubleshooting 7).\nPrewarm premade 293T Medium and 0.05% Trypsin in 37°C water bath for 30 min.\nSeed 5 × 106 cells of 293T cells onto the plate and culture for 17 – 18 h in 293T medium (see Troubleshooting 8 & 9 and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/25-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of Retroviral Particles\n(A) An example of 80%–90% confluency of 293T cells. Cells should appear similarly immediately prior to transduction. Scale bar for both images is 100 μm.",
    "(B) Viral precipitation gathering at the bottom of 50 mL tube after a 17 - 18 h incubation with PEG/PBS.\n(C) After centrifugation, the viral pellet should appear as a white or beige pellet at the bottom of the 50 mL tube. All traces of liquid should be removed after second spin. The beige / white pellet should appear as shown here, without any excess liquid.\nOn day 1, pre-warm DMEM medium with no additives to 20 to 25°C\nCritical: see Troubleshooting 10.\nReplace the spent 293T medium with 9 mL of 293T transfection medium at least one hour before transfection.\nPrepare the below listed two solutions in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes for each intended retrovirus. If also packaging miR-133 prepare an additional DNA solution and NanoFect solution for that retrovirus as indicated by the (OR) below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_25_1.csv\nVortex each solution at medium speed thoroughly and incubate for 5 min at 20 to 25°C.\nCritical: Transfer Mix (2) into Mix (1) and vortex again for 10 seconds (see Troubleshooting 11).\nQuickly spin down the solution from tube wall and cap.\nIncubate the final mixture for 15-20 min at 20 to 25°C.\nAdd the final 1 mL of transfection mixture in a circular dropwise motion to the 293T cells, starting at the outer rim of the dish and ending in the center of the 10-cm plate.\nGently swirl the plate in back and forth and side-to-side motion to ensure even distribution of the transfection mixture. Incubate the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 17- 18 h.\nCritical: The following day (day 2) early in the morning (do not exceed 20 hours post transfection) aspirate the medium with careful attention to the appropriate procedure for discarding BSL2 virus containing medium.",
    "Replace the spent medium with 8 mL of fresh 293T medium.\nCritical: Virus Collection Point 1:  Approximately 48 hours after transfection (on day 3), collect the supernatant using a disposable syringe and filter it using 0.45 μm syringe filter into a 50 ml conical tube. Store this tube for 17 – 18 hours at 4°C.\nGently and slowly add 8 mL of fresh 293T medium along the side of the culture plate and incubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 17 – 18 h. Be careful not to dislodge the cells when removing or adding the medium.\nCritical: Virus Collection Point 2 : On day 4, repeat step one from day 3, by filtering the additional 8 ml of medium into the same 50 ml conical tube that was stored at 4 °C for 17 – 18 hours.\nTo precipitate the virus, add 2 mL of 40% of PEG/PBS solution to every 8 mL of viral supernatant. The final concentration of PEG is 8%.\nMix well by inverting the solution five to six times. Refrigerate the solution at 4°C for 17 – 18 h (see Troubleshooting 12).\nOn day 5, centrifuge the PEG-viral mixture at 3000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the viral particle may appear as a beige or white pellet at the bottom of the tube (Figure 2 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nCentrifuge the tube again at 3000 x g for five minutes to get rid of any residual liquid.\nAfter this second spin, remove all traces of liquid by aspiration. Be careful NOT to disturb the pellet (Figure 2 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nResuspend each viral pellet per 10-cm dish in 100 μl of cold, sterile DMEM at 4°C (see Troubleshooting 13).",
    "The virus is now ready for use.\nPause Point: It can be aliquoted in cryogenic vials and stored at −80 °C for future long-term use or at 4 °C for a few days.\nCardiac Reprogramming\nTiming: 2 Weeks\nThe hMGT133 method of human cardiac reprogramming described below is a fast and efficient way to directly reprogram human cardiac fibroblasts using a minimal number of transcription factors and additives. Reprogrammed hiCMs can be collected for characterization within just two weeks of transduction and demonstrate cardiomyocyte-like properties (Zhou et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nHuman cardiac fibroblasts are cultured and split every four days after revival to ensure their increased growth (see Troubleshooting 14).\nThe day before reprogramming, precoat the desired number of wells on a 24 well plate with pre-dissolved SureCoat for 1 h at 37°C. (see Troubleshooting 15).\nAfter 1 h aspirate the excess SureCoat and seed human cardiac fibroblasts at a density of 2 × 104 cells per 24-well (see Troubleshooting 16 & 17).\nOn day 0, replace the fibroblast medium in each well with 500 μl of iCM medium (Figure 3 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/25-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Brightfield Image of Reprogrammed hiCMs\n(A) Standard human cardiac fibroblasts at reprogramming day zero.\n(B) 11 days after transduction, hMGT133 infected cells start to undergo some morphology changes.\n(C) 14 days after reprogramming, cells that were not infected with hMGT133 appear like standard fibroblasts.",
    "(D and E) At reprogramming day 14, fibroblasts that were infected with hMGT133 are morphologically distinct from the fibroblast appearance at day zero and have a cardiomyocyte-like appearance. Note, that depending on the density of cells in culture, the individual cell shape of hiCMs may be clearly seen in a less dense culture (D), or less clearly seen in a denser culture (E). hiCM appearance as seen in either (D) or (E) is fine and is due the final density of cells. Scale bar for all images is 100 μm.\nAdd 10 μl of hMGT retro or lentivirus, 10 μl of miR-133 retrovirus, and 8 μg/mL polybrene per 24-well (see Troubleshooting 18).\nIncubate for 48 h in a 37°C, 5% CO 2 tissue culture incubator.\nOn day 2, remove the spent iCM medium and replace with 1 mL of fresh iCM medium supplemented with 1 μg/mL puromycin.\nIncubate the cells in iCM/puromycin medium in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for four days to select for cells that have successfully been infected with the retrovirus or the lentivirus (see Troubleshooting 19 & 20).\nOn day 6, Replace the iCM/puromycin medium with fresh iCM media lacking puromycin. The only cells remaining in culture should be those that have successfully taken up the hMGT construct.\nIncubate for four days in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.\nOn day 10, aspirate the spent iCM medium and replace with 1 mL of CM medium (see Troubleshooting 21). The cell morphology begins to change at this time point (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIncubate for four days in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.",
    "On day 14, the reprogrammed cells should now transform from fibroblast morphology to a round shaped morphology (Figure 3 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C-E) and can be collected for characterization of hiCM phenotype and reprogramming efficiency."
