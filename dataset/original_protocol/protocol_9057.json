    "1. Embryo Isolation/Preparation\nThis technique can be used for mouse or rat. In this protocol we demonstrate the CSF collection technique and cerebral cortical explant dissection with mouse embryonic brain. We will comment on any important differences for rats versus mice that exist within the general techniques. For the embryonic age staging system, E1 is classified as the day of the plug for rats, and E0.5 is classified as the day of the plug for mice.\nPrepare a micro-dissection dish with Sylgard Silicone Elastomer. Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer is supplied as a two part liquid component, Part A and Part B. Part A and Part B are mixed in a 10:1 ratio by weight or volume. After the liquid components are mixed, pour the sylgard elastomer into a Petri dish to cover the entire surface of the dish. Some air bubbles may be present that will dissipate during the curing process. Place the Petri dish lid on and allow the elastomer to cure. The elastomer can be cured at room temperature for 24 hr, or at higher temperatures (e.g. 37 °C) for faster curing. Once the liquid components solidify, the dissection dish is ready to use. The dish can be used repeatedly for multiple experiments, provided that it is cleaned well following the procedure.\nPreparation of the micro-capillary pipette (needle). Micro-capillary pipettes are prepared by applying heat and pull using a Narishige PC-10 vertical micropipette puller with the following settings: One step pull; Heater #2 set to 58; 100 g pull weight. The fine tip of the micropipette is carefully snapped off using fine #55 forceps. The resulting average inner diameter of the needle is 85 μm.",
    "Prepare the aspirator assembly for CSF aspiration. Insert micro-plunger provided with micro-capillary pipettes into the capillary needle. Alternatively, attach a plastic disposable filter to the end of the aspirator tube assembly that is connected to the micro-capillary pipette. Push the needle through the gasket into position on the opposite end of the aspirator assembly.\nTransfer embryo isolated from the litter to a micro-dissection dish prepared with Sylgard.\nRemove the extra-embryonic membranes and tissues so that the embryo is clearly exposed. Each tissue layer-first the uterine wall and then the decidua-can be dissected using fine iridectomy scissors (i.e. Fine Science Tools # 15000-02). At each implantation site, first the uterine wall, then the decidua can be incised parallel to the long axis of the uterus, and the incision can then be opened further using fine forceps. The decidua can be removed after a similar incision, exposing the fetal membranes. Care should be exercised so that the fetal membranes are not incised or punctured.\nWash with sterile Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and remove excess fluid from the surrounding embryo using a pipette as well as a kimwipe or filter paper cut into triangles.\n2. Ventricular CSF Collection\nVisualize embryo under the dissection microscope: for mouse, the embryo should be laying on its side, such that one has a sagittal view of the developing embryo. With rat embryos E16 or older, position the embryo on its dorsal spinal column, along its longest planar dimension, from a cranial to caudal direction, as if the embryo is lying on its back. In this manner the CSF can be collected from both right and left lateral ventricle.",
    "Steadily insert the micro-capillary pipette into the lateral ventricle, mesencephalic ventricle, or cisterna magna, attempting not to contact the neuroepithelial cells once the pipette has been inserted. For mouse embryos E14.5 or older, the CSF can be aspirated from the right ventricle and then the needle removed and inserted into the left ventricle. Because of the patency of the ventricles and the neural tube in embryos younger than E14.5, the entire CSF volume can often be aspirated from the lateral ventricles with a single needle insertion. However, this is not always the case as developmental times and patency of the connecting ventricles may vary slightly, and therefore, the micro-capillary pipette can also be inserted into the cisterna magna to collect the maximal CSF volume.\nOnce the micro-capillary pipette is inserted into the lateral ventricle, mesencephalic ventricle, or cisterna magna, carefully and gently begin aspirating the CSF into the pipette, using either the micro-plunger to create negative pressure and aspirate the CSF, or by providing a gentle negative pressure created by mouth such that CSF starts to gently flow into the micro-capillary pipette in a slow and controlled fashion. We recommend that the viewer checks with their own local officials regarding institutional policies on these approaches.\nContinue to apply negative pressure and collect the CSF into the micro-capillary pipette. In both mouse and rat embryos of E16.5/E17 or younger, it is possible to observe the ventricle collapse slightly by the appearance of a divot forming on the side of the head that the micro-capillary pipette is in. In older embryos, due to the larger size of the brain, it may not be possible to observe the head collapsing.\nStop applying pressure and gently remove the micro-capillary pipette from the lateral ventricle.",
    "Gently expel the CSF sample into an Eppendorf tube that has been chilled on ice.\nContinue collecting the CSF from an entire litter of animals and pool the samples into the same tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove any contaminating cells.\nAnalyze the samples for any signs of contaminating neuroepithelial cells or red blood cells. Signs of contamination are usually indicated by the fluid appearing cloudy or red/pink, or the presence of a pellet with a blood tinged spot. After centrifugation, the CSF can be analyzed microscopically for any evidence of cells or cellular debris. If there are signs of contamination the fluid should be discarded. As an additional control, the pellet content may also be stained for cells. A clean CSF sample can be used for cell culture, cortical culture, spectrometry, western blot, ELISA, and other assays. The clear CSF should be transferred to a new sterile Eppendorf tube. The sample can now be used for analysis, pooled with other samples, or snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The freezing and thawing of small samples of fluid may result in a small volume decrease and changes in protein concentration. This can be avoided by freeze drying the samples.\n3. Cortical Explant Dissection\nTransfer the E14.5 embryo isolated from the litter onto a micro-dissection dish prepared with Sylgard.\nRemove embryo from extra-embryonic membranes and tissues as described in Step 1.5.\nWash with sterile Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and remove excess fluid from the surrounding embryo using a pipette.\nDissect through the cervical region separating the head from the rest of the embryo (Figure 1A).",
    "Using a fine scalpel (ophthalmic knife), cut down the midline of the scalp. Grasp each side of this incision with fine forceps and remove the skin. Next, use iridectomy scissors to make an incision that runs the length of midline of the developing cranium. Subsequently, make two additional incisions, approximately 1/3 of the distance from the anterior and posterior ends of the developing skull. Use fine forceps to grasp the \"flaps\" of cranium that result from this part of the dissection, and remove the developing skull tissue, exposing the cortex (Figure 1B).\nUsing the scalpel bisect the brain along the midline in the mid-sagital plane, separating the right and left cortical hemispheres (Figures 1B, C). The pia and arachnoid are left attached to the cortex, and the dura is removed together with the developing skull.\nPrepare each cortical hemisphere separately. Place the hemisphere medial side up so that you can see the ganglionic eminence and the developing cortex (Figures 1C, D).\nUsing the scalpel, make a coronal incision through the cortical neuroepithelium caudal to the developing olfactory bulb. This incision should begin at the anterior boundary of the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences, and extend through the anterior cingulate region of the developing cortical rudiment (Figure 1E).\nMake another coronal incision just caudal to the posterior boundary of the lateral ganglionic eminence (Figure 1F). This incision should also extend from the lateral boundary of the ganglionic eminence to the medial wall of the developing cortical rudiment.",
    "Retract the cortical \"flap\" created by the two incisions made in steps 3.7 and 3.8, using a scalpel or gentle pressure from a stream of HBSS delivered with a 200 μl pipettor to avoid mechanical damage to the cortex. Then make a transverse incision along the boundary separating the lateral ganglionic eminence from the developing cortex (Figures 1G, H). Then, dissect away the developing hippocampus and cortical hem of the medial telencephalon, at the apex of the neocortex where the lateral cortical surface meets the interhemispheric wall.\nMake a transverse incision along the boundary separating the lateral ganglionic eminence from the developing cortex (Figure 1H).\nRemove any extra dissected tissue that is on the Sylgard plate from the dissected cortical explant. One can use gentle pipetting with fresh HBSS buffer to pipette away any extra dissected tissue. The dissected cortex is now with meningeal side facing down (Figure 1I).\n4. Transferring of Cortical Explant\nPrepare a platinum wire loop connected to a glass pipette. Heat the glass pipette with a folded platinum wire inserted in the end of the glass pipette. By twisting the end of the platinum wire loop, the size of the loop can be increased or decreased, and the loop can be shaped to fit the size of the explant desired. (This can be prepared beforehand and reused.)\nHeat the end of the platinum wire to sterilize the loop.\nIsolate the dissected cortical explant and remove the extra HBSS media by gentle pipetting, leaving a small amount to use with the wire loop.\nPlace a 1 cm polycarbonate membrane in a 4 cm diameter imaging dish.\nUsing the side of the platinum wire loop, gently flip the cortex so that the meningeal side is facing up.",
    "Lift the cortical explant off the dissection dish, by placing the explant in the middle of the loop and using the intrinsic hydrostatic forces to lift the explant on a flat plane.\nGently place the explant on the polycarbonate membrane, and lift the platinum wire loop away such that the explant remains on the membrane on a flat plane with the ventricular surface making contact with membrane.\nGently lift the membrane and pipette 50 μl of CSF or other media under the membrane.\nCover the imaging dish, place it in a humidified secondary container, and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 hr to support continued cell proliferation and explant growth. Figure 2 depicts a schematic of the final cortical explant dish preparation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
