    "This study was approved by the ethics committee of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital (approval number: 2021-12-K04). All of the following steps were performed according to standardized procedures to avoid injury to the patients and the surgeons. Informed patient consent was obtained for this study. The surgeon must be skilled in conventional core decompression procedures to ensure that the surgery can be performed in a traditional way in case of inaccurate navigation or other unexpected situations.\n1. Preoperative diagnosis and grading of ONFH\nIdentify patients with clinical symptoms of ONFH; typical symptoms such as persistent or intermittent pain in the groin region with ipsilateral hip or knee radiating pain. Physical examination showed deep tenderness in the groin region, Patrick's sign, a limited hip motion of internal rotation and abduction, or necrosis changes of the femoral head measured using X-ray, CT, and MRI.\nAccording to the association research circulation osseous (ARCO) staging, review patients' X-ray, CT, and MRI of the hip and determine the staging of ONFH. Two doctors conduct this work independently. If disagreements arise, ask a third expert to make the final decision.\nRecord the preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Harris hip score using a questionnaire.\nInclude patients using the following criteria: 1) patients with ONFH; 2) stage I, IIA, and IIB of ONFH confirmed by imaging examination (X-ray, CT, and MRI); 3) the femoral head core decompression surgery is planned. Exclude patients when: 1) patients reject the CD surgery; 2) preoperative routine examination indicates surgical contradictions, such as infection or poor basic condition; 3) patients refuse to be enrolled in the group.\n2. System registration and accuracy testing",
    "Run the AR-assisted orthopedic surgery system (due to commercialization issues software details cannot be provided) and click on Orthographic Video to activate the depth camera. An image of the surgical area will be displayed on the screen after activation (Figure 5A). Position the optical tracking device so that its tracking area can completely cover the surgical area (Figure 5B).\nClick on NDI Setting to select the device access port, COM4. Click the Virtual Needle Length Setting (generally a Kirschner needle is 180 mm long) and a virtual Kirschner needle image will be automatically generated in the surgical area in the video.\nDivide the planned surgical frontal area into upper and lower levels with each level 30 cm x 30 cm in size, and with a height difference of 15 cm between the levels. The system automatically inputs this spatial information of the surgical area in the software.\nEvenly allocate every level with 10 matching points; for every 30 cm x 30 cm area, divide it into three equal parts, with two parts having three points each, and one part (left part) having four points. Ask the assistant to place the non-invasive body surface marking frame (Figure 2C) according to the points. Once done, click on Match. The system's own special image for registration will be automatically superimposed on the marking frame (Figure 5C). Consider the registration of this point successful when the image and the marking frame coincide completely.",
    "Move the frame to the next registration point and repeat step 2.4. until all registration points are completed. As the shape of the marking frame equipped with the puncture device (Figure 3A2) is exactly the same as the non-invasive body surface marking frame, once the registration is completed, the former can also be tracked by the optical tracking device in the surgical area.\nMove the puncture device randomly in the surgical area to detect the matching degree of virtual needle and tracking delay (Figure 6). As the red-blue virtual Kirschner needle body automatically fits with the actual needle in the surgical area, the augmented reality display of the Kirschner needle is successful (Figure 5D).\n\tNOTE: During the registration process, the position of the optical tracking device and depth camera should not be changed at will. If so, the spatial position relationship of virtual surgery will change, causing inaccurate matching between the virtual Kirschner needle and the physical one, and registration has to be re-conducted.\n3. Patient and system preparation before puncture\nAfter entering the operating room, ask the patient to lie down in supine position and fix the lower limb of the affected side (Figure 7). Administer general anesthesia to all patients.\nPrepare the surgical site with iodine and 75% alcohol, and place the non-invasive body surface positioning device (sterilized using standard procedures) on the patient's affected hip.\nMove the C-ARM fluoroscope to the side of the operating table and position the source above the hip joint. Align the source with the depth camera and record the position of the surgical table as position 1.",
    "After the first fluoroscopy, export the BMP format radiograph to the system workstation, open it in Photo Editing, and adjust its gray scale by clicking on the Light Scale Option. Rotate clockwise and flip horizontally once by clicking the corresponding buttons to convert to BMP. Then, open it by clicking Painting 3D and save as the JPG format, which contained non-invasive body surface marking frame, and name it image 1 (Figure 8A).\n\tNOTE: This conversion process is to promote the success of the system identification. Because of the special requirements of image conversion, it is necessary to adjust the gray scale of the X-ray image for rotation and inversion.\nSlide the operating table directly below the depth camera to the operating area marked as position 2. Position 1 (in step 3.3) and position 2 are two points on the same horizontal plane, 30 cm apart.\nIn the AR-assisted orthopedic surgery system, click File > Front X-ray image, and select image 1. the system automatically identifies the non-invasive body surface marking frame on the skin surface of the patient, and then superimposes this image to the hip joint in the surgical video (Figure 8B).\nUsing the augmented reality display of the X-ray image and real-time video generated above, the surgeon plans the puncture path based on this.\n4. Puncture assisted by surgical system\nThe surgeon stands on the affected side and performs the following steps. Hold the puncture device and determine the best insertion angle. Mark the insertion point on the skin surface, guided by the virtual Kirschner wire and the X-ray image of the hip joint in the surgical video.\nSelect a Kirschner wire with a diameter of 2.5 mm and pierce it from the insertion point. Observe the insertion depth and angle in the video and adjust it timely.",
    "When the virtual needle has reached the target area of necrosis, stop the puncture process and retain the screen shot as image 2 (Figure 9A) for subsequent puncture accuracy evaluation.\nIndwell the needle. Move the operating table to position 1 for the second fluoroscopy to verify the actual puncture condition of the Kirschner wire. Record the image file as image 3 (Figure 9B).\nPuncture is successful when the location of the Kirschner wire meets all of the surgeon's requirements. Then, use the lancet to cut the skin around the needle, and separate every level of soft tissue till exposing sub-trochanter bone, roughly to a depth of 3 cm. Drill into the necrotic area along the Kirschner wire with a 5 mm trephine to complete the subsequent operations (artificial bone or autologous bone implantation).\nAfter finishing all the procedures, close the skin with 3-0 silk thread and cover with sterile dressing (Figure 10). After returning to the ward, provide the patients accepted common orthopedic postoperative medication, like infection prevention, analgesia, and fluid infusion. If no complication occurs, discharge the patients 3 days after surgery.\n5. Operation evaluation\nImport image 2 and image 3 into an image processing software and adjust the opacity to 52%.\nClick the Masking button to overlap the two images, then click the Rulers button to measure the distance (Lvirtual) between the virtual tip and the puncture point of the femoral cortex, and the distance (Lture) between the tip of the Kirschner needle and the puncture point of the femoral cortex. Calculate the difference between Lvirtual and Lture to assess puncture accuracy.",
    "During the puncture, measure the positioning time as follows: the positioning time starts from the time when the Kirschner wire pierces the skin, and stops when the X-ray confirms that the Kirschner wire has successfully reached the target area of the femoral head.\nThree months after surgery, take the hip X-ray (Figure 11) and record the visual analogue scale and Harris hip score.\nSubscription Required.
