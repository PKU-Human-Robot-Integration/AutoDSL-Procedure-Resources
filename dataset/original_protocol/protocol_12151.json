    "1. Master Design and Fabrication\nNOTE: Use soft lithography for device fabrication. Make a two-layer SU-8 master for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molding.\nDesign the device using a design and drafting software (Figure 1A, left). Draw each layer of the master separately. Print the device design on two photomasks at 20,000 dpi, corresponding to the two layers of the master15. Set the device pattern as transparent and the surrounding area as dark; the masks will serve as the template to optically transfer the device pattern onto SU-8 by lithography (as described by others15).\nDispense about 4 mL of SU-8 50 onto the center of a 4 inch silicon wafer. Coat the SU-8 50 evenly on the wafer using a spin coater by spinning at 2,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 30 s. Bake the wafer on a 95 °C hotplate for 10 min. Expose the wafer to ultraviolet (UV) light at 200 mJ/cm2.\nPour about 4 mL of SU-8 2050 onto the center of the wafer and spin at 2,500 RPM for 30 s. Bake on the 95 °C hotplate for 15 min. Cool to room temperature (RT).\nRepeat step 1.3 two more times.\nCover the coated wafer with the first-layer transparency photomask. Expose the wafer to UV light at 270 mJ/cm2 to make the first layer. Bake on the 95 °C hotplate for 15 min.\nMake the second layer of SU-8 2050 by repeating step 1.3 twice.\nAlign the second-layer mask to the features on the first layer using a mask aligner. Then, expose to UV light at 240 mJ/cm2. Bake at 95 °C for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The exposure time is determined by the required total UV dose and the UV light output intensity measured on the day prior to use.",
    "Develop the wafer by submerging it in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) and shaking at 200 RPM for 30 min on an orbital shaker.\nPlace the master into a Petri dish and carefully pour the PDMS mixture (base to crosslinker at a ratio of 10:1 by weight) on the center of the wafer. Cover all the features and avoid air bubbles.\nHeat in an oven at 70 °C for 2 h. Use a sharp blade to cut around the edge of the PDMS biowire template (Figure 1A, right). Peel the PDMS from the master. Trim the device with the blade. Put the PDMS biowire template in a sterilization pouch and steam autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.\nIn a biosafety cabinet (BSC), place the PDMS biowire template into a Petri dish. Use tweezers to hold and mount a piece of sterile surgical silk suture (6-0) in the center of the channel of the PDMS microwell by seating it in the grooves at both ends of the channel (Figure 1B-I).\n2. Creation of the Electrical Stimulation Chamber\nMake a pair of rectangular polycarbonate pieces (length x width x thickness: 2 cm x 0.85 cm x 0.35 cm) and use them as the frame of the electrical stimulation chamber (Figure 2).\nDrill two 3 mm wide holes 2 cm apart along the center line of each polycarbonate frame piece.\nCut two pieces of 1.5 cm long carbon rods. Drill a 1 mm-wide hole through the carbon rod about 3 mm from the end. Thread a platinum wire through the carbon rod hole and tighten the wire by wrapping it around the carbon rod. Attach a clip to the other end of the platinum wire for later connection with the electric stimulator.",
    "Insert the carbon rods into the polycarbonate frame pieces. Place the assembled frame with the carbon rods into a well of a six-well plate.\nPour 2 mL of PDMS into the well. Submerge the bottom of the polycarbonate frames in PDMS while keeping the PDMS surface level close to but not reaching the bottom of the carbon rods. Heat in an oven at 70 °C for 2 h.\nTake the electrical stimulation chamber out of the six-well plate and put it in a sterilization pouch for steam sterilization at 121 °C for 20 min.\n3. Enzymatic Dissociation of hPSC-CMs\nInduce hPSC to differentiate into cardiomyocytes using an established protocol4.\n\tNOTE: Briefly, generate cardiomyocytes via established embryoid body (EB) protocols in stem pro medium through the sequential supplementation with bone morphogenetic protein 4, basic fibroblast growth factor, activin A, vascular endothelial growth factor, and Dickkopf homolog 14. Use EBs from day 20-34 of differentiation to make biowires.\nCollect the EBs from the low attachment plate with a P1,000 pipette tip and transfer to a conical tube. Pellet by centrifugation for 5 min at 125 x g and RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with pre-warmed, 37 °C collagenase type I containing 1% deoxyribonuclease I (DNAse I). Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h for digestion.\nAdd 5 mL of pre-warmed, 37 °C wash medium and centrifuge for 5 min at 125 x g and RT. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet with 2 mL of trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 mL of stop medium containing 3% (v/v) DNase I.\nAttach a 20 G (0.9 mm) needle to a 5 mL syringe and pass the EB suspension through it 3-5 times.",
    "Add 7 mL of wash medium and centrifuge at 280 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) and store on ice. Determine the cell number with a hemocytometer. Take 0.5 x 106 cells and pellet by centrifugation at 280 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant.\nPre-cool all the gel components on ice before mixing them in a sterile tube. Mix the following collagen gel components (final concentration): 2.1 mg/mL rat tail collagen type I, 24.9 mM glucose, 23.8 mM NaHCO3, 14.3 mM NaOH, 10 mM HEPES, and 10% extracellular matrix in 1x M199 medium. Add the collagen and extracellular matrix last. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nResuspend 0.5 x 106 cells with 3.5 µL of collagen gel and mix well.\nUse a P10 pipette tip to add 4 µL of the cell suspension into the 0.5 cm-long channel (Figure 1B-II). Adjust the position of the suture with sterile forceps if necessary.\nCover the bottom of the Petri dish with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), making sure not to touch the gel. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nReplace the PBS with 12 mL of culture medium (e.g., stem pro or medium recommended by the cell manufacturer), enough to cover the cells (Figure 1B-III). Culture in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 week. Change the medium every other day.\n4. Electrical Stimulation for Biowire Cultivation\nIn the BSC, add 2 mL of PBS to each well of a six-well plate that will house an electrical stimulator chamber. Use sterile tweezers to gently place the autoclaved electrical stimulation device into the well. Discard the PBS from the well.",
    "Cover the carbon rods with 5 mL of pre-warmed culture medium. Use sterile tweezers to mount the biowires in the electrical stimulation chamber and orient them perpendicular to the carbon rods (Figure 2).\nPlace the lid on top of the six-well plate, but leave sufficient platinum wires reaching outside the plate to connect with the electrical stimulator. Place the six-well plate in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and connect the platinum wire to the electrical stimulator.\nStimulate the biowires using an electrical stimulator with the following setting: biphasic repeating pulse, 1-ms pulse duration, 3 V/cm, and 1 pulse per second (PPS). Raise the PPS every 24 h to the following values: 1.83, 2.66, 3.49, 4.82, 5.15, and 6. Change the medium every other day.\nObserve the cardiomyocyte contractility in response to electrical stimulation under a microscope at 10X magnification.\n\tNOTE: After one week of stimulation, the biowires becomes mature (see the results section).\nSubscription Required.
