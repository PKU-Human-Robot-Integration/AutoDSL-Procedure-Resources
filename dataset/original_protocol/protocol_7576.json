Mass spectrometry (variable) *The timeline may differ from the estimates we provide here depending on the researcher or availability of the resources. General notes on cell culture and immunoprecipitation Cell confluency is a critical element affecting proper neural induction and differentiation from iPSCs. The splitting ratios outlined in this protocol can be cell line dependent. In addition to the ratios mentioned, Table 1 outlines retrospective statistics on the range of seeding densities from different replicates of the successful differentiations using these splitting ratios. We recommend carrying out a small-scale pilot using 6-well plates in the initial instance using the splitting ratios and seeding counts outlined here as well as variations to this, such as 1:2 and 1:3, after day 10 of neural induction (Figure 1). CRITICAL:  It is critical to keep the cell density above a certain level while the cells are still progenitors, i.e., still forming rosettes, to avoid their mis-direction towards other lineages.Table 1. Example range of cell seeding densities used across different experiments that resulted in successful neural differentiation table:\n﻿0,1,2\n*,Harvested (per cm2),Seeded (per cm2)\nDay 0,-,\"350,000–550,000\"\nDay 10,1.2 Mio–1.7 Mio,\"630,000–730,000\"\nDay 15,\"690,000–1.6 Mio\",300000\nDay 21,\"820,000–1.4 Mio\",420000\nDay 28,\"480,000–850,000\",\"190,000–250,000\"",
    "*Days since day 1 of neural induction (Mio: million) It is advised to evaluate the cultures at different timepoints via immunostaining for marker proteins such as PAX6 (for neural stem cells); MAP2, CTIP2, SATB2, CUX1 (for neurons); and FOXG1 (forebrain).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821015701_7206.jpgFigure 1. Images of cells a few hours after splitting at different stages of neural differentiation. Scale bars: 200 μm.Although a large amount of material is required to interrogate the full proteomic profile of the 10 baits, an advantage of this method is that the samples can be created in batches. That is, as long as all the proteomic samples across all replicates are run together on the mass spectrometer, not all of the 10 baits plus the negative controls need to be immunoprecipitated at the same time. For example, it is possible to carry out four immunoprecipitations of different baits plus a negative control in one batch, and the rest of the six immunoprecipitations plus a negative control in another batch for that cell type. The highly reproducible neural differentiation plus proteomic analysis across the four replicates makes this possible. However, if microtubule-dependent and microtubule-independent proteomic interactions are being interrogated for a particular bait (e.g., CEP120 in neural progenitors), the cells from the same batch of differentiation should be divided into nocodazole and DMSO treatments, and immunoprecipitated using the same antibody(s).The protocol can easily be adapted to other cultured cell types, as well as primary cells isolated from different tissues or from different species, given the sufficient starting amount of isolated total protein for the co-immunoprecipitations can be obtained and relevant optimizations of the steps are done.Unless specified otherwise, 1× PBS at room temperature is used for washing the cells.It is advised to use pre-warmed media (37 °C) when splitting the cells and when changing the media daily.",
    "Part I: Cell culture Induced pluripotent stem cell culture media and plate preparation (TIMING: 0.5–1 day) Prepare the medium:When required, remove the mTeSR supplement (5×) from the freezer and thaw overnight at 2–8 °C prior to use.Aseptically add 100 mL of mTeSR supplement (5×) to 400 mL of cold (2–8 °C) mTeSR basal medium. This mixture is named mTeSR medium hereafter.Coat the plates:Thaw Geltrex on ice and dilute 1:100 in pre-cooled DMEM/F-12 medium (at 4 °C) to avoid gelling the product; mix by turning the Falcon tube upside down a few times. Add 1 mL to each well of a 6-well plate, swirl the plate to distribute the solution evenly, and incubate in a humidified cell culture incubator for at least 2 h or overnight.After incubation, remove the coating solution before seeding the cells (Optional:  Wash the wells once with 1–2 mL of sterile 1× PBS). PAUSE POINT:  If not using straight away, add 2 mL of 1× PBS per coated well, wrap the plate with parafilm, and store at 2–8 °C for up to one week.Induced pluripotent stem cell culture (TIMING: 3–5 days) Note: Before thawing the cells, have the Geltrex-coated plate(s), medium, ROCK inhibitor ready, and warm the water bath to 37 °C. Prepare mTeSR medium supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (1:1,000 dilution of 10 mM stock solution) sufficient for thawing and seeding the iPSCs as described below (hereafter referred to as mTeSR+ROCKi).Pre-warm 3–4 mL of mTeSR+ROCKi to 37 °C in a 15 mL Falcon.Rapidly thaw a vial of viable iPSCs frozen at a density of 2 × 105–1 × 106 (or one well of a 6-well plate) by placing the cryovial in a water bath at 37 °C for 1–2 min (until a tiny ice particle remains).",
    "Using a 1 mL sterile pipette, transfer the cells into the pre-warmed 15 mL Falcon tube containing mTeSR+ROCKi. TIP:  Disinfect the cryovial with 70% ethanol before opening.Centrifuge at 300× g for 4 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 1.5–2 mL of mTeSR+ROCKi. Remove the Geltrex/PBS from the Geltrex-coated plate and add the cell suspension mixture to a single well of the 6-well plate (or up to three wells, with at least 1.5 mL final media in each).Rock the plate side-to-side in both directions to evenly distribute cells in the well and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.The next day, remove the medium, wash the cells once with 1× PBS, add 1.5 mL of fresh mTeSR without ROCK inhibitor per well, and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Replace the medium with 1.5 mL of fresh mTeSR every day until the cells are 80% confluent. Optional:  When the cells are more than ~70% confluent, 2 mL of medium can be used instead.It is good practice to observe iPSC lines under a phase contrast microscope daily to check for iPSC-like morphology, presence of differentiated cells, and confluency (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821015735_1406.jpgFigure 2. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) at different growth phases. A) A few days after splitting. Cells might look larger, with loose cell-to-cell contacts. B) Semi-confluent stage. Center of the colonies has round cells with tight contacts, while the growing edges contain looser cells. C) With high confluency, most of the iPSCs become round and compact with tight cell-to-cell contacts. Scale bars: 200 μm.Induced pluripotent stem cell expansion (TIMING: 4–6 days × n) Notes:  Here, we describe splitting the cells from one well of a 6-well plate to six wells (1:6 splitting ratio). Size of the plates, volumes, and the ratio can be up- or down-scaled.",
    "Have a 6-well plate coated with Geltrex ready on the day of splitting. We describe here the passaging of the iPSCs using a combination of enzymatic and mechanical approaches. First, the wells are treated with Collagenase IV to soften the basement membrane, and then the cell clumps are collected using a cell scraper and further dissociated mechanically. Dilute the Collagenase IV 1/4 in 1× PBS and keep aliquots in Falcons at -20 °C. Once thawed, working solution can be kept at 2–8 °C for a few weeks and should not be re-frozen. For splitting the cells, pre-warm at least 1 mL of Collagenase and 9 mL of mTeSR to 37 °C. Volumes can be slightly increased to account for pipetting loss.Aspirate the media from the well and add 2 mL of sterile 1× PBS. Swirl the plate a few times and remove the PBS.Add 1 mL of Collagenase (1/4 in 1× PBS) to the well, distribute equally by swirling, and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 5 min (no more than 8 min, as the cells should not detach at this stage yet).Aspirate Collagenase and add 1 mL of 1× PBS or mTeSR.Scratch the well first with a 200 μL pipette tip at different directions to break cell colonies. Then, use a cell scraper to detach the cells from the plate completely.Using a 1 mL pipette (or a serological pipette, depending on the number of wells) transfer the cells into a 15 mL Falcon and centrifuge at 300× g for 4 min at room temperature. Alternatively, keep the falcon at room temperature for 5-8 minutes for the cell clumps to precipitate to the bottom of the Falcon tube.While cells are spinning, add 1 mL of mTeSR (pre-warmed to 37 °C) to each of the six Geltrex-coated wells.",
    "Once cells have finished spinning, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of fresh mTeSR, by pipetting the media up and down quickly 5–8 times. CRITICAL:  Make sure to have neither single cells nor very large cell clumps. Clumps of 10–30 cells can be ideal. If the cells are too much dissociated by mistake, add ROCK inhibitor (10 μM final) for one day to help their survival. If the clumps are too large, iPSCs tend to differentiate in the middle of the colonies before the plate becomes confluent. To avoid large clumps, cells can be pipetted up and down additionally a few times before seeding to break them up further.Add 0.5 mL of resuspended cell mixture to each of the six wells. Rock the plate side to side in both directions a few times and incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2. TIP:  Avoid swirling the plate, as it will cause the cells to accumulate in the center of the well and start differentiating after a few days due to high density.The next day, replace the media with 1.5 mL of fresh mTeSR, and repeat this step every day. Optional:  When the cells are more than ~70% confluent, 2 mL of medium can be used instead.Once at 80% confluency, split the cells again.Continue expansion until having enough cells for neural induction.Neural induction (TIMING: 40–42 days) Note: Here, we describe a protocol for generating 60–100 × 10 cm dishes with neurons at day 40 of differentiation (Figure 3). This can account for 11 immunoprecipitations (IPs) for each of DMSO and nocodazole treatments (22 IPs in total, including negative controls) (Figure 4). Number of plates and IPs can be up- or down-scaled.",
    "For each 10 cm dish on day 0, grow 3–5 wells of 80% confluent iPSCs (Table 1). Along the differentiation, adjust the number of plates to proceed in each splitting according to the final number of plates desired. For neurons, calculate some additional plates to account for potential partial detachment of the cells, especially after day 35 of the differentiation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821015905_6072.jpgFigure 3. Schematic representation of expansion and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) towards neurons for co-immunoprecipitation of centrosome proteins with their interactors imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821022317_2216.jpgFigure 4. Statistics (A) on the number of plates with day 40 neurons vs. total protein (milligrams) obtained in different sparse (B) or normal density (C) batches. Scale bars: 200 μm.Dilute Matrigel 1:300 from an 8–12 mg/mL stock in DMEM/F-12 medium and add 4–4.5 mL per each of the two 10 cm dishes. Leave at 37 °C, 5% CO2 from at least 4 h to overnight.CRITICAL:  Do not let the coating dry on any part of the plate, as this alters the attachment of the cells and success of the induction. If part of the plate dries out, this might generate a heterogenous population of cells, which is impossible to sort out later. Therefore, adjust the coating volume carefully.Before seeding the cells, remove the coating solution (Optional:  Wash with 3 mL of 1× PBS).PAUSE POINT:  If the coated plates will not be used immediately, store at 4 °C after adding 6 mL of fresh 1× PBS up to two weeks.Pre-warm Accutase and mTeSR medium to 37 °C.Remove the media from 6-well plates containing iPSCs and wash once with 1× PBS.Add 0.5–0.",
    "7 mL Accutase to 7–10 wells containing iPSCs (leave one well for re-splitting as per section C1) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min (no longer than 8 min) (Optional:  Swirl the plate once in the middle of the incubation). At the end of the incubation, cells should be suspended in solution mostly in single cell form.After 5 min, add 1 mL of mTeSR or 1× PBS to each well containing Accutase and carefully collect and pool all the cells in a Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 300× g for 4 min at room temperature.Remove the supernatant, being careful of the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells with 6 mL of mTeSR at 37 °C supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (mTeSR+ROCKi).Add 3 mL of cells to each of the 10 cm dishes pre-filled with mTeSR+ROCKi, to have a final volume of 10 mL.From our experience, 3–4 confluent wells of a 6-well plate suffice for seeding a 10 cm dish.Alternatively, count cells and seed 350,000–550,000 cells per cm2 of the 10 cm dish (Table 1) and adjust the final volume to 10 mL.CRITICAL:  It is important to have a dense cell layer of iPSCs on day 1 for proper neuroectoderm induction (Figure 5, Day1). With lower densities, the cells might assume neural crest-like or other lineages (Liu et al., 2015; Hindley et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230823/20230823040153_3567.jpgFigure 5. Example images from different stages of successful differentiations. Cells were split on days 10, 15, 21, and 28. Days 11, 16, 22, and 29 represent the days after splitting. Day 15 and 40 are the timepoints used for the proteomic analysis in O’Neill et al. (2022). Scale bars: 200 μm.",
    "After seeding, rock the plates from side to side in both directions a few times to homogenously distribute the cells after placing into the incubator (avoid swirling) and keep at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight.The next day, if cells completely cover the entire plate (Figure 5, Day 1), begin neural induction. If not, replace with fresh mTeSR and incubate for another day. Do not keep the seeded cells more than two days before the induction.The next day, remove the media, wash the cells once with 1× PBS, and replace with 10 mL of neural induction medium (N3+SMADi). This represents day 1 of neural induction.Neural induction medium (N3+SMADi) is changed every day until day 10 of differentiation when a uniform neuroepithelial sheet should have formed.On/before day 10, have the poly-L-ornithine/Laminin-coated plates ready, as follows:Thaw a 10 mg/mL aliquot of poly-L-ornithine (PO). TIP:  Keep the PO aliquot at 4 °C after thawing.Coat four 10 cm dishes with poly-L-ornithine diluted 1:500 in sterile water. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 4 h. To be on the safe side, add at least 4.5 mL of coating solution per 10 cm dish to prevent partial drying out.Following coating, remove the PO solution (optional:  wash the plates once with 1× PBS) and coat the plates with Laminin diluted 1:200 in 1× PBS. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for at least 4 h (or overnight). CRITICAL:  Do not let the Laminin coating dry on any part of the plate, as this influences the density of attached cells, which is critical for the neural differentiation.The same PO+Laminin coating procedure can be applied to sterile glass coverslips in 24-well plates to seed the cells for immunostaining.",
    "PAUSE POINT:  If the PO+Laminin-coated plates will not be used immediately, they can be stored after adding 6 mL of 1× PBS and sealed with parafilm at 2–8 °C for up to four weeks. Nonetheless, we recommend coating freshly before each splitting.At day 10 of neural induction, split the cells 1:3. The exact splitting ratio can vary across cell lines but should be aimed at reaching 100% confluency on day 15 (Table 1, Figure 5).Wash the cells with 1× PBS after removing the media, add 2 mL of Accutase per 10 cm dish, and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.Add 3 mL of neural induction medium (N3+SMADi) or 1× PBS to each plate, mechanically dissociate cells with a rubber (TPE) cell scraper, and then collect in a 50 mL Falcon.Spin at 300× g for 4 min.Remove the supernatant being careful of the cell pellet and re-suspend the cells with 18 mL of N3+SMADi supplemented with ROCK inhibitor (10 μM) (N3+SMADi+ROCKi) (assuming the cells were collected from 2 × 10 cm dishes).Dispense cells according to a 1:3 ratio (in this case, 3 mL of cell suspension per 10 cm dish pre-filled with 5 mL of N3+SMADi+ROCKi) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Optional:  Count cells and seed according to the ranges provided on Table 1.The next day (day 11), replace media with N3 medium without ROCK inhibitor. Replace the media again on day 12.If the growing rate of cells do not forecast reaching to 100% confluency at day 15, supplement the media with 4 ng/ml FGF (1:2,500 dilution of 10 µg/ml stock) on day 11 or day 12, and keep with this medium for only one day. Avoid high doses or extended periods of culture with FGF, as it might caudalize the cells.",
    "From day 12 on, replace the medium with fresh N3 every other day (unless FGF is added; if so, adjust the media changing days accordingly).On day 15, cells should be 100% confluent with the appearance of rosettes (Figure 5).TIP:  If the rosettes are not readily visible, try to observe them while washing the cells with PBS or after changing the media.If the cells were also seeded on the coverslips, fix them with PFA (to stain for cell identity markers, such as PAX6) or methanol (to stain for most centrosome proteins).On/before day 15, have the poly-L-ornithine/Laminin-coated plates ready and split the cells as described for day 10 from section D12 onwards.From this stage on, replace the media every second day (8 mL of N3 per 10 cm dish). Always replace the media the day after splitting the cells, preferably after washing the cells once with 1× PBS.Split the cells also on days 21 and 27/28 (for approximate cell counts, refer to Table 1) and proceed with media changes until day 40 (Figure 3). TIP:  From approximately day 35 on, be extra careful when changing the media, as the cells tend to detach locally or as an entire sheet from the plate. To avoid this, either add the medium very slowly using a 25 mL pipette dropwise or change only half of the media, but daily.Observe the morphology of the cells along the differentiation to see if they assume morphologies typical of each stage (Figures 5 and 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821024342_0245.jpgFigure 6. Example images from failed differentiations. Cells might assume cobblestone or spiny/fibroblast-like morphology, have large and/or darker nuclei, or enlarged cytoplasm. Cultures should be monitored frequently (e.g., after each media change) to watch out for such aberrant morphologies, which might signal potential failure of the differentiation. Scale bars: 200 μm.",
    "(Optional) Nocodazole treatment of the cells (TIMING: 4–5 h) Notes:  Nocodazole is a drug that blocks polymerization of the microtubules and can be used to assess microtubule-independent centrosome interactions of the proteins. To this end, nocodazole and DMSO (solvent, as control) are added to their respective culture plates 4 h before harvesting the cells for protein isolation and immunoprecipitation (Figure 7). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821023617_4038.jpgFigure 7. Day 40 neurons after 4 h of nocodazole treatment. A) Nocodazole-treated cells B) DMSO-treated control cells. Scale bars: 200 μm.Because nocodazole increases cell death and reduces protein yield, plates can be divided into nocodazole and DMSO treatments with approximately 60:40 ratio to account for this loss. For microtubule depolymerization, alternative agents such as vinorelbine, vincristine, colchicine (Bates and Eastman, 2017), or cold exposure (Li and Moore, 2020) can also be considered and tested to see if they result in reduced cell death. Add nocodazole (3.3 mM stock concentration, dissolved in DMSO) to a final concentration of 3.3 μM to the N3 medium (1:1,000). Swirl plate to distribute it evenly.As a control, DMSO is added to its respective plates using the same ratio added to the nocodazole plates (i.e., 1:1,000).Incubate the plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h, confirm the de-polymerization under the microscope, and begin collecting the cells for lysis and protein isolation.Part II. Protein isolation Cell lysis for total protein isolation (TIMING: 2–4 h) Notes:  On the day of immunoprecipitation (IP), freshly make up IP/wash buffer A and wash buffer B and store on ice for the duration of the procedure. Cool centrifuge for spinning 50 mL Falcons to 4 °C. Pre-cool 1× PBS to 4 °C and keep in the ice bucket (in case of nocodazole treatment). Obtain plates from incubator and aspirate the media.",
    "Wash cells with 3 mL of 1× PBS per plate. Aspirate PBS and add 3 mL of fresh 1× PBS.TIP:  If handling a lot of plates, you can split them to batches, keeping the rest in the incubator.For nocodazole-treated plates, wash with ice-cold PBS, keep plates on ice in bucket while scraping, and process only a couple of plates at a time acting quickly to impede repolymerization of microtubules. TIP:  To keep the conditions as similar as possible, DMSO-treated plates can be treated the same way.Using a cell scraper, scrape the cells off the plate, tilting the plate sideways and pushing all the cells into the PBS. Keep the plate tilted and, using a 10 mL pipette, transfer cells in PBS to a 50 mL Falcon placed on ice.Continue to scrape cells and transfer to 50 mL Falcon tube(s), pooling the cells within their respective treatments.Once all plates are scraped (or the 50 mL Falcon is filled), spin at 300× g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cells.Aspirate off the PBS (ensure the pellet is not removed).PAUSE POINT:  If cell lysis will not be done on the same day, cell pellets can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C. If this is the case, add the IP/wash buffer A directly on the frozen pellet without thawing it on the day of lysis.Assess the volume of the pellet in milliliters and add double that volume of IP/wash buffer A.Incubate on ice for 30 min.It is important not to dilute the sample too much, as this will affect the protein concentration and subsequent downstream steps. For example, 5 mg of total lysate in 1 mL will be used for immunoprecipitation; therefore, the concentration should not be lower than this.",
    "During the cell lysis, cool a micro-centrifuge capable of spinning 1.5 mL tubes at 18,000× g to 4 °C.After the 30 min incubation, once the cells are lysed, distribute lysate into 1.5 or 2 mL protein low bind tubes and spin at 18,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cellular debris.During this time, set up the protein standards for the standard curve as described below.After the 10 min centrifugation and the cellular debris is pelleted, carefully remove the clear supernatant from the 1.5 mL tubes and pool into a (Optional:  protein low bind) 15 mL Falcon (CRITICAL:  do not mix different samples), mix well, and proceed with the next step. TIP:  It can be practical to calculate the total volume while pooling the lysates for a more accurate estimation of total protein later.PAUSE POINT:  If the cell lysates will not be used immediately, they can be kept at -80 °C.Assay protein concentration (TIMING: 0.5–1 h) Notes:  Prepare the dilutions and protein standards on ice. Adding the reagents to the microplate and subsequent steps can be done at room temperature. To set up the protein standards, add 20 μL of IP/wash buffer A to six individual tubes (labeled as 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25). Add 20 μL of the 16 mg/mL BSA protein standard (see Recipes) to the first tube (8 mg/mL), performing a 1:2 dilution series with the remaining tubes, down to 0.25 mg/mL.Example: mix [20 μL of buffer A + 20 μL of standard], transfer 20 μL of this mixture to the next tube that already contains 20 μL of buffer A, mix well, transfer 20 μL of this mixture to the next tube, and so on.",
    "In a fresh tube, make a master mix with a 49:1 ratio of Reagent A and Reagent S (A+S) of the Bio-Rad Protein Assay:Calculate two replicate wells per four standards (2 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, and 0.25 mg/mL), one for control, two replicates per sample to be measured, and two extras (Figure 8). Example:A+S mix = [11 + (2 × Nsamples)] × (24.5 μL Reagent A + 0.5 μL Reagent S)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821024503_1781.jpgFigure 8. Example layout of a microplate section with protein standards and diluted samples for determination of protein concentration with DC Protein Assay Add 25 μL of the A+S mix to the wells of the protein reader plate.Add 5 μL of each protein standard to two corresponding wells each, as well as the 5 μL of IP/wash buffer-only control to its respective well (Figure 8).Add 5 μL of the cell lysate per sample to their respective wells containing the A+S mix.If the protein concentration is too high, the measurement will fall above the linear range. In this case, two different dilutions of the samples can be used for measurement, e.g., 1/4 and 1/10, or else, to ensure accurate determination of concentration. Try to make sure at least one of your sample dilutions fall within the range of 2–0.25 mg/mL.Aliquot 200 μL of Reagent B to each well to be measured, going from the lowest-to-highest protein concentration wells, and incubate at room temperature for 10–15 min.Measure the absorbance of the samples at 750 nm within one hour and use the protein standard measurements to produce a standard curve using linear regression (y = mx + n) where y is absorbance and x is protein concentration. Then, calculate the amount of protein within your sample(s) of interest based on its absorbance using this formula.",
    "TIP:  It is not recommended to exceed 2 mg/mL for the standards, as the linear range can be lost for higher values than this. Calculate the R2 value of the fitted line to check its linearity.PAUSE POINT:  If the cell lysates will not be used immediately, they can be kept at -80 °C.Part III: Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitation (TIMING: 4–5 h) Note: At least four replicate immunoprecipitations performed using different biological replicates are recommended for each bait of interest. Calculate how many immunoprecipitations can be performed with the total lysate obtained from cells (Figure 4).Each immunoprecipitation for mass spectrometry requires 4–5 mg of starting total protein, while samples for assessing the immunoprecipitation by Western blot can be as little as 500 μg.Each immunoprecipitation is performed in 1 mL of volume.Dilute the protein lysate to 5 mg/mL in IP/wash buffer A and aliquot 1 mL of lysate into each respective protein low bind tube for immunoprecipitation. Keep the samples on ice.For every set of immunoprecipitations, one of the samples should be reserved for no-antibody control.As an alternative to the no-antibody control, it is encouraged to use isotype-specific control antibody(s) as negative control that matches the class and type of the primary antibodies used in the experiment.For each immunoprecipitation, add 2 μg of the desired antibody to 1 mL of lysate at 5 mg/mL. For the negative control, add no antibody to the tube or add the isotype control. CRITICAL:  From this point on, be very careful about cross-contamination of the samples. Never use the same tips for different samples during washes and avoid splashes across the tubes, as mass spectrometry has a very-high detection sensitivity.Incubate tubes on an end-to-end rotator in a 4 °C cold room for 1 h.",
    "Fifteen minutes before the end of this incubation, prepare the Protein A and Protein G Dynabeads solution:Mix 10 μL of Protein A and 10 μL of Protein G per immunoprecipitation (including the negative control) in a 1.5 mL tube. Example:A+G mix = (1 + NIPs) × (10 μL Protein A + 10 μL Protein G)Place tube on a magnetic strip and remove the liquid without disturbing the beads with the pipette tip.Resuspend the beads with IP/wash buffer A using the same volume aspirated from the tube, place the tube on the magnetic strip, and remove the liquid.Repeat this wash two more times and finally re-suspend the beads with IP/wash Buffer A using the original volume.After 1 h incubation of the lysate with the antibodies, add 20 μL of Protein A+G mix to each IP tube as well as to the negative control. Incubate on the rotator for an additional 2 h at 4 °C.After this incubation period, place all the IP tubes on the magnetic strip. Remove the wash buffer, leaving the beads coupled to the antibodies and protein attached to the wall of the tube. Add 1 mL of IP/wash buffer A.CRITICAL:  Use a clean tip for each sample to remove the supernatant.CRITICAL:  Work very quickly or in batches to avoid drying of the beads if there are too many samples.Incubate the samples on a rotator at 4 °C for 15 min and repeat the above step two more times (each with a 15 min incubation).During this process, pre-heat a heating block to 95 °C.Under a chemical hood, mix 1× Laemmli buffer and 2-mercaptoethanol in a 39:1 ratio (e.g., 975 μL of 1× Laemmli buffer + 25 μL of 2-mercaptoethanol). Approximately 30–40 μL is required per IP.",
    "After the third wash, place the samples on the magnetic strip and remove the wash buffer. Add 1 mL of wash buffer B to each sample before incubating on a rotator at 4 °C for a couple of minutes. Repeat this step once again.After these washes, place the samples on the magnetic strip and remove the wash buffer. TIP:  10/20 μL tip can be used following the 1,000 μL tip to remove the supernatant as much as possible. Place the tubes with the beads immediately on ice and transfer to a fume hood.Add 30–40 μL of fresh Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol to each sample and ensure the beads are well re-suspended. The volume can be decided on a case-by-case basis, but it is important to keep it consistent across different samples and batches.Incubate the tubes for 10 min at 95 °C. After this time, place the tubes on the magnetic strip in the fume hood and transfer the supernatant (Laemmli buffer now also containing the immunoprecipitated protein of interest and its interactors) to a new protein low bind tube without disturbing the beads.Store samples at -80 °C until all immunoprecipitations are completed. CRITICAL:  Run all samples together on the mass spectrometer, as run-to-run variations are common even if the same samples are re-analyzed at a different timepoint.Mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS analysis of the eluates from the co-immunoprecipitations was performed on a QExactive HF mass spectrometer, as described in O’Neill et al. (2022).Proceed to the MaxQuant section once the .RAW files from mass spectrometry are available."
