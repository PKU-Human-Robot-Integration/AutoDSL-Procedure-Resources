    "This is a before-and-after self-controlled trial with patients sourced from the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record NO.KY2022007). Patients were informed about the purpose and process of the study and agreed to the use of images and videos during the experiment.\n1. Pre-treatment evaluation\nInclusion criteria: Include patients who fulfill the following conditions: Between the age of 50 and 75 years; conscious, mentally normal, and informed about the study; not involved in other clinical studies; meet the diagnostic criteria for stable COPD based on the GOLD COPD report, 2023 update( global strategy for prevention, diagnosis, and management of COPD)1, and have a comprehensive analysis of the patients' past medical history, clinical manifestations, pulmonary function, and imaging findings, etc.; meet the diagnostic criteria for sleep disorders as per the Chinese classification of mental disorders (CCMD-3)28 or the diagnostic criteria for the international classification of sleep disorders29.\nExclusion criteria: Exclude participants who meet any of the following criteria: Coexisting with other serious physical or mental illnesses; under acute exacerbation of COPD; have sleep disorders known to be caused by specific causes other than COPD (such as endocrine diseases, drug use, etc.); refusal to accept acupuncture treatment; allergic to medical devices (such as tape, metal needles, etc.); auricle injury; sensory disturbances; patients who have received acupuncture, sleeping pills, or treatment other than basic COPD treatment within the past 2 weeks.\n\tNOTE: Coagulation should be checked in patients with potential coagulation disorders because there is a certain chance that auricular acupuncture in such patients will lead to subcutaneous purple spots and excessive bleeding.",
    "Dropout criteria: Withdraw participants who meet any of the following criteria from the study: Serious adverse reactions; subjects voluntarily withdraw from the study; subjects who have serious complications or disease progression during the study.\n2. Study design\nNOTE: All the practitioners performing the treatment must have an acupuncturist qualification certificate and have performed clinical treatment independently for more than 1 year. The treatment is carried out under the National Standard of the People's Republic of China Standardized manipulations of acupuncture and moxibustion-Part 3:Ear acupuncture(GB/T 21709.3-2021)30. The acupuncturists will not be changed during the experiment unless necessary.\nPerform auricular acupuncture based on conventional COPD treatment according to the 2023 global strategy for prevention, diagnosis, and management of COPD1. Other treatments for sleep disorders are not supported to guarantee the independence of the auricular acupuncture treatment.\nIf an acute exacerbation occurs during the treatment, take prompt emergency measures, and record the acute attack and treatment process in detail. After the condition improves, consult the patients and re-evaluate to decide whether to continue the experiment.\nIf there is no improvement after 1 week of active treatment, withdraw the patient from the experiment as a dropout participant.\n3. Operating steps\nPre-operation preparation\n\t\nProvide sleep hygiene education to patients 1 week before the start of treatment, including maintaining regular sleep and wake times to establish a biological clock, developing a reasonable exercise schedule, and avoiding strenuous exercise before bed, creating a quiet sleeping environment, eating regularly to avoid hunger or satiety at night, avoiding drinking too much liquid at night to avoid going to the toilet at night, no tea, coffee, or energy drinks after 4 pm, and avoid smoking before going to bed.",
    "Verify the patient's information: Name, bed number, and ID. Explain detailed treatment procedures and methods to patients and their families to reduce or eliminate patients' tension or fear.\nCheck the medical devices used in the treatment: Sterile cotton swab, 0.5% iodophor, tweezers, and 0.25 mm x 1.3 mm press needle (see Figure 1). Ensure that all materials are within the validity period.\nSelection and positioning of acupuncture points\n\t\nFor selection of acupuncture points, refer to Experimental Acupuncture and Moxibustion31. Select four acupuncture points, Fei (CO14), Xin(CO15), Shen men(TF4) , and Pi zhi xia(AT4), according to the criteria. The specific information of the selected acupoints is shown in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The location of the acupoints refers to the National Standard of the People's Republic of China: Nomenclature and location of auricular points32 published in 2008 (GB/T13734-2008). See Figure 2 and Figure 3 to accurately identify the correct location of the acupuncture point.\nHold the auricle with one hand and use a cotton swab with the other hand to probe the auricular acupoints one by one with an appropriate strength. Take sensitive points as specific acupuncture points and mark the points with a sterile marker.\nOperation procedure\n\t\nDisinfection of the operator's hands: Wipe fingers with 75% alcohol cotton ball.\nHold an iodophor cotton ball with tweezers to thoroughly disinfect the acupuncture site, hold the edge of the tape of the press needle with tweezers, aim the needle tip at the acupoint, and pierce vertically and slowly.\n\t\t​NOTE: When holding press needles, use tweezers rather than directly by hand to avoid contamination of needles.\nMake sure that the round handle on the top of the needle fits flat against the skin surface and is firmly fixed with tape. Then press gently with fingertips for about 1-2 min.",
    "At the same time, ask the patient if there is a comprehensive feeling of soreness, numbness, bloating, and heaviness. If so, it indicates that a state of De Qi is achieved, which is considered as an essential part of the efficacy of acupuncture, indicating that the operation is successful, and the predicted effect is achieved.\nInstruct the patient to use the correct manipulation, immediately after needle insertion, as described below, to press the acupuncture site: use thumb and index finger to press from the back and front of the auricle, strength from light to heavy.\nCarefully observe the patient's feelings, whether there is a state of De Qi or dizziness, pain, and other discomforts. Report to the doctor if any discomfort occurs and take countermeasures in time (read step 4 for details)\nAsk the patients to rest on their backs for at least 30 min after the needle is inserted to avoid accidents and adverse reactions.\nPerform the treatment for 2 weeks, 3x a week, scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The time of each indwelling needle is 36 h. After this time, ask the patient to return to the clinic for needle removal and post-treatment care as described in step 3.4.\nIn the follow-up treatment, ask the patients to massage the auricular points 3x a day for 1-2 min each time on their own. To avoid over-stimulating the skin of the ear, instruct to massage only one side of the ear each day and then switch to the other side the next day.\nPost-treatment care\n\t\nKeep the puncture sites dry and clean to prevent infection.\nWhen removing the needle, use tweezers to hold the tape and pull it out. Carefully check whether there is any broken needle. If so, report to the doctor in time and take countermeasures.",
    "After removing the needle, disinfect the acupoints again on the puncture site to prevent infection.\n4. Prevention and countermeasures for adverse events\nPrecautions\n\t\nBefore the start of the study, communicate with the patients and their families in detail, explain the purpose of treatment, specific operations, and precautions to obtain the active cooperation of the patients.\nStrictly follow the operating procedures during the trial.\nStop the trial if the patient's condition changes or worsens and take corresponding treatment measures in time. Adjust the treatment plan according to the global strategy for prevention, diagnosis, and management of COPD 1 and re-evaluate after improvement.\nAdverse reaction event report: Record adverse reactions (including bleeding, hematoma, infection, severe pain, etc.) occurring during the treatment process in detail.\nCountermeasures\n\t\nIf the press needle falls off: Check the integrity and notify the acupuncturist to replace the needles.\nIf the needle breaks: Press around with appropriate force to make the broken end protrude out and remove it with tweezers.\nIf there is infection, bleeding, or hematoma at the acupuncture site: Take disinfection, anti-infection, and anti-inflammatory treatment and closely observe the patient's condition.\nNeedle syncope: When needle syncope occurs, remove the press needle immediately and check the integrity of the removed needle. Ask the patient to lie down to increase blood flow to the brain and reduce dizziness. Appropriately loosen the patient's collar and waistband, keep warm, and ensure air circulation, administer intravenous glucose to the patient if necessary. Administer first aid immediately if the patient is in critical condition.",
    "NOTE: Needle syncope (also called fainting during acupuncture), is a kind of acupuncture accident which often occurs in the process of acupuncture. Patients may have conscious symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, palpitations, etc., often accompanied by signs such as pallor face, cold sweat, decreased blood pressure, and weak pulse. In severe cases, there can even be a sudden loss of consciousness33. According to modern medicine, needle syncope is a kind of vasogenic syncope. Its primary mechanism is the stimulation of solid needling through the vagus nerve reflex, causing the dilation of the vascular bed (especially the surrounding muscles). Reduced peripheral vascular resistance and return blood flow result in reduced cardiac output and decreased blood pressure, which together lead to a temporary, widespread reduction in cerebral blood flow and subsequent syncope. Its diagnosis is mainly based on the patients' subjective feelings (dizziness, nausea, etc.) and objective signs (pallor, low blood pressure, etc.).34\nAfter the condition stabilizes, consult the patient and re-evaluate to decide whether to continue the treatment according to the actual situation.\n5. Efficacy evaluation\nNOTE: Researchers can choose appropriate evaluation indicators after comprehensive consideration and analysis according to the condition of patients. When it comes to subjective indicators such as scale filling, questionnaire content and scoring method should be explained by the same researcher, and patients must complete the scoring independently without any suggestive reminder.\nOutcome measures\n\t\nUse the COPD assessment test (CAT) to evaluate patients' quality of life: Patients with a score of 0-10 rated COPD as minor impact; scores between 11-20 indicate moderate impact; scores between 21-30 indicate severely affected; scores between 31-40 indicate very serious impact.",
    "Determine a difference or change in patient CAT >2 as clinically meaningful. Changes of more than 2 points in patients' CAT scores before and after treatment may indicate that the treatment has clinical significance.\nUse the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients. Evaluate the effect of auricular acupuncture by comparing the total points before and after treatment. A higher score indicates poorer sleep quality, while a reduction in PSQI scores indicates an improvement in sleep quality.\n6. Data collection and analysis\nFor analysis, use data from the scales filled out by the patients before and after treatment, which were collected 24 h before the first treatment and 24-36 h after the last treatment.\nFor data analysis, use a commercial data analysis software, and consider a p< 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Use the paired t-test for before-and-after self-controlled comparison.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
