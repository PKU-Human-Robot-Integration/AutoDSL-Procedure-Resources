    "1. Preparation of seeded NGM plates in the field\nBefore travel, weigh 23.005 g of Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) (see Table of Materials) powder and pre-pack in a sealable plastic bag. Make one bag for each liter of media desired.\n\tNOTE: Pre-packaging before travel bypasses the need for a functional balance in the field.\nPrior to travel, prepare 1 mL of 1M MgSO4, 1 mL of 1M CaCl2, and 25 mL of 1M potassium phosphate buffer for each liter of media desired. To make 1 L of potassium phosphate buffer, dissolve 108.3 g of KH2PO4 and 35.6 g of K2HPO4 in water, as described in WormBook20.\nBefore travel, make an overnight culture of OP50 (see Table of Materials) grown in LB at 37 °C, as described in WormBook20. Aliquot the culture into 50 mL conical tubes and wrap the tops with paraffin film to prevent leakage.\nIn the field, dissolve the contents of the NGM packet into 973 mL of double-distilled water (ddH20) or the purest, most sterile water available in a 1 L flask or bottle.\nPlace the media flask or bottle, with a loose cap or aluminum foil cover, in a boiling hot water bath on a hot plate or stove. Stir occasionally until all the powder is dissolved and is clear (this takes ~30 min).\n\tNOTE: If a magnetic hot plate is available, a stir bar is an excellent option to limit the amount of manual stirring.\nRemove the media from the water bath and cool to ~58 °C with occasional shaking or with a stir bar. Once the media is cooled to 58° C, use serological or standard pipettes to add 25 mL of 1M potassium phosphate buffer, 1 mL of 1M MgSO4, and 1 mL of 1M CaCl2, mixing well between each step.",
    "In the most sterile environment available, pipette or pour the media into plates of the desired size and allow to cool and solidify overnight. Pour one 60 mm plate (~10 mL) for each substrate sample. Pour one 35 mm plate (~3.5 mL) for each isofemale line; the number of small plates needed is difficult to predict in advance.\nPipette 50 µL of OP50 culture onto each plate and allow it to dry and grow overnight before use.\n2. Collection of the nematode substrates\nIdentify a bacteria-rich substrate in the field. Some examples include rotting fruit, flowers, fungi, and stems of herbaceous plants. Soil and leaf litter are also suitable, though they rarely contain Caenorhabditis.\nWith a gloved hand, place a sample of this substrate (1-15 cm3) into a sealable plastic bag (see Table of Materials) labeled with a unique sample ID (Figure 1A).\nRecord the sample ID, latitude, longitude, date, description of the substrate, and any other local environmental measurements relevant to the experiment, including ambient and substrate temperature, time of collection, condition of substrate, presence of substrate-associated macroinvertebrates, and so on. A smartphone app is available to streamline this process21.\n3. Preparation of an array of Baermann funnels\nFor each funnel, use scissors to cut a segment of rubber tubing (see Table of Materials) ~3 cm long.\nFit the tubing segment over the end of a plastic funnel (see Table of Materials). This may take some effort as the fit is very tight.\nSlide a tubing clamp over the rubber tubing and clamp it shut.",
    "To make a funnel holder, use a scalpel to cut circular holes of 35 mm diameter in the bottom of a cardboard fly-vial tray (see Table of Materials) that has not been folded together from its flat shipping orientation. A standard tray can accommodate 12 of these holes in a 3 x 4 array.\nInvert the cardboard, fold down the sides once (not twice, as one would to make a fly-vial tray), and tape the sides together to elevate the inverted cardboard tray (Figure 2).\nPlace funnels in the holes, first making sure that the tubing clamps are in the closed position.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63287/63287fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Repurposed cardboard fly vial trays, folded and cut to support 12 Baermann funnels each.

Transfering of samples into the funnels\nPour water (as sterile as available) into each funnel, filling it about 3 cm below the rim. If air bubbles are trapped in the tubing, tap the funnel to release them.\nWith gloved hands, place a lint-free wipe or specifically a Kimwipe (folded in half to make a square) over the funnel, and press down on the center so that it is submerged in the water.\nManually break large solid pieces of natural substrates (fruit, flower, soil, leaf litter, etc.) into smaller fragments to minimize the distance worms must travel to fall out of the substrate.\n\tNOTE: Leaf litter and awkwardly shaped samples can be preprocessed in a food processor or blender.\nGently place a sample of the natural substrate (1-15 cm3) onto the tissue/lint-free wipe in a funnel without puncturing the tissue and without the sample protruding above the rim.\nLabel the funnel, or the cardboard next to the funnel, with the sample ID corresponding to field collection notes.",
    "Fold the corners of the tissue/lint-free wipe over the sample (Figure 1B). Be careful to keep the sample contained within the tissue/lint-free wipe so that no soil or debris can pass to the bottom of the funnel.\n\tNOTE: This step is to prevent the corners from draping over the edge of the funnel, where they would wick the water from the funnel over the sides.\nWith hands, a spatula, or a pipette tip, pick out any active insects, millipedes, or other animals that may travel from funnel to funnel, cross-contaminating samples. Wrap the tissue/lint-free wipe entirely around the sample or lay a second tissue across the top of the sample to prevent cross-contamination.\nAdd more water to funnels so that the entire sample is submerged (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63287/63287fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Assembled Baermann funnels. Each sample is wrapped in tissue/lint-free wipe and submerged under water in the funnel, which is clamped shut. Over a period of ~12 h, the nematodes will migrate through the tissue and to the bottom of the funnel.

Extraction of nematodes from the funnels\nWait for ~12 h or overnight. During this time, active worms will wriggle out of the substrate, through the tissue/lint-free wipe and down to the bottom of the clamped funnel.\n\tNOTE: Waiting much longer than 12 h risks worm mortality due to hypoxia or pathogenic infection, which may also be a risk at shorter durations for samples that are particularly crowded with worms and bacteria.\nWrite the sample ID of a funnel on the bottom of a 60 mm NGM worm plate seeded with a spot of OP50 E. coli bacteria. Remove the lid from the plate.",
    "Remove the funnel containing that sample from the funnel stand. Using one hand to hold the funnel upright above the open worm plate, use the other hand to release pressure on the tubing clamp, allowing one drop of water to fall from the tubing onto the worm plate (Figure 1C). As soon as water drops from the funnel, quickly clamp it shut again to prevent flooding the NGM plate.\n\tNOTE: To select worms attracted to OP50, including Caenorhabditis species, release the drop away from the bacterial lawn. When the water soaks into the plate or evaporates, Caenorhabditis nematodes will crawl into the bacterial lawn.\nClean up: Throw out the contents of the funnels. Wash the funnels with hot water for subsequent reuse.\n6. Establishing the cultures\nObserve the isolated nematodes under the stereomicroscope at a magnification of 5x-50x. The plates should include nematodes, and at much lower frequencies, small oligochaete annelids, tardigrades, rotifers, and small crustaceans (Figure 4).\n\t​NOTE: If the funnel has been set up correctly, no mites, insects, or visible non-living material will have made it through the funnel.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63287/63287fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Contents of the first droplet released from a Baermann funnel onto an NGM plate.

Use a lighter to sterilize the worm pick before and after transferring worms.\nUse paraffin film to wrap plates thoroughly for travel."
