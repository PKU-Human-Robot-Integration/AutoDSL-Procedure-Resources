    "Step-by step method details\nStep-by step method details\nPart I. Detection of DEs by flow cytometry\nThis section details the methods for: (A) Staining PBMCs with our standard cocktail of 4-fluorophore-conjugated antibodies specific for CD19, CD5, IgD, and TCRαβ. (B) Sequential gating strategy to simultaneously detect DE cells, conventional T cells (Tcon) and conventional B cells (Bcon) cells in the same PBMC sample and compare their phenotypes – See below for details.\nIdentifying DEs by flow cytometry\nTiming: 2–3 h\nNote: Use fresh PBMCs for flow cytometry whenever possible. However, when using cryopreserved PBMCs, additional attention should be paid to exclude debri and doublets.\nNote: To properly detect DEs, you will need to stain sample(s) with the cocktail of 4 antibodies (See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). In addition, you will need 5 compensation control tubes (4 tubes for single fluorophore staining, and 1 tube for unstained sample).\nOptional: You may stain your sample(s) with Live/Dead dye, such as PI or Live/Dead Aqua. It is highly recommended to use Live/Dead in your initial experiments until you become familiar with analyzing DEs or when you are expecting high numbers of dead cells in your samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1140_6.csv\naWe suggest you determine optimal concentrations of your antibodies by doing your own titrations.\nCount live cells using the Trypan blue dye exclusion method.\nLabel your FACS tubes with permanent marker.\nAdd 1 to 2 million cells in 100 μL to each FACS tube. If you do not have enough cells, you may use fewer cells for compensation (200,000 cells per control tube).",
    "Alternatives: you may use compensation beads instead of cells. However, we prefer to use cells from the same sample because beads are usually more homogeneous and emit fluorescent intensity that does not necessarily match the fluorescent intensity of the molecule on the surface of cells of your interest.\nStain your sample(s) and controls:\nIf you would like, stain your sample(s) first with the Live/Dead dye of your choice. We generally use PI (1 μg/mL) or Live/Dead Aqua (1 μL of dye as prepared in kit in 1 mL PBS). If you choose to stain your samples with Live/Dead, make sure you make a single-color compensation control for it and follow manufacturer’s instructions.\nStain your sample(s) with the cocktail of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies specific for TCRαβ, IgD, CD5, and CD19. We use 5 μL of each antibody and stain in FACS buffer, at a final volume of 100 μL. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for the fluorophores we use and suggested dilution factors.\nNote: if you are staining multiple samples, you may prepare a cocktail sufficient for all of them.\nStain your single-color compensation controls.\nVortex tubes and incubate on ice for 20–30 min, protected from light.\nWash your sample(s) and controls with 2–3 mL of FACS buffer. Centrifuge at 525 xg (1500 rpm) and discard supernatants.\nResuspend samples in 600 μL of FACS buffer.\nVortex tubes. They are now ready for flow cytometric analysis.\nMove to your FACS instrument and perform compensation setup using your compensation controls.\nRun your samples and acquire 500,000–1,000,000 events per sample when possible.\nExport the FSC files.\nSequential gating strategy to identify DEs and analyze their phenotypes",
    "This section details the sequential gating strategy we employ for identifying and analyzing DEs in acquired samples using the FlowJo software. The protocol is excellent for analyzing samples for the presence and determining the frequency of DEs.\nNote: When desired, stain samples for appropriate markers for additional phenotypic and functional characterization of DEs and compare their properties to those of autologous Bcon and Tcon.\nTiming: 30–60 min\nOpen FlowJo and drag your FCS files into the application\nOpen your sample files.\nGate total lymphocytes using the FSC-Area vs SSC-Area plot.\nGate on single cells and exclude doublets using the FSC-Area vs FSC-Height followed by SSC-Area vs SSC-Height plots. Alternatively, doublets can be excluded by using FSC-Height vs FSC-Width and SSC-Height vs SSC-Width plots.\nIf you stained your samples with Live/Dead, gate on live cells using a histogram of the Live/Dead staining as recommended by the manufacturer.\nDraw a 2-parameter dot plot using CD5 vs CD19. Gate on Bcon (CD5− CD19+), Tcon (CD5+ CD19−) and the CD5+ CD19+ subpopulations (we often use rectangle gates).\nNote: When gating for DEs, avoid CD5high CD19high cells because they are almost always highly enriched for doublets. Thus, it is recommended that when gating on the CD5+ CD19+ population limit gating to CD19+CD5low cells (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAnalyze each subpopulation for the presence of TCRαβ+IgD+ DEs. Use the Bcon population as a reference to place the gates that distinguish between TCRαβ+ and TCRαβ− and IgD+ and IgD− subpopulations.",
    "Note: DEs are mainly found within the CD5+ CD19+ population and are defined as lymphocytes that coexpress TCRαβ and surface immunoglobulin (BCR). According to the surface immunoglobulin expressed, DEs are divided into TCRαβ+ IgD+ or TCR+ IgD− subpopulation. The latter are often class-switched to either IgG or IgA. The phenotype of TCR+IgD− cells should be confirmed by staining for the expression of IgG or IgA. For more details about the gating strategy, please refer to Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and supplementary data in the original manuscript (Ahmed et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: While gating DEs, an important step is to exclude doublets. We do so in 2 ways: 1) as mentioned in step 14, and 2) by ensuring that DEs that are gated are CD5low and TCRlow (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We believe that the CD5high and TCRαβhigh cells are mostly doublets and not DEs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1140-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Consequential gating strategy for acquiring samples and detecting DEs, Bcon, and Tcon by using FACS and FlowJo\n(A) Dot plots show how to sequentially gate live single lymphocytes and exclude doublets and dead cells in your PBMC sample.\n(B) Left dot plot shows how to use a 2-parameter plot of CD19 versus CD5 to divide gated lymphocytes into Bcon (CD5−CD19+); Tcon (CD5+CD19−), and CD5+CD19+ populations. Right dot plots show how to analyze each gated subpopulation for DEs as identified by the coexpression of TCRαβ and BCR. Note: most DEs are located within the CD5+CD19+ compartments, rare among Bcon, and virtually absent among Tcon. Consequently, analysis and sorting of DEs, is limited to DEs localized within the CD5+ CD19+ population. Numbers indicate percentages in each quadrant. This figure is adopted from the manuscript by Ahmed and colleagues (Ahmed et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1140-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Steps used to sort and verify identity of DEs, Bcon, and Tcon\n(A) In this series of dot plots, consecutive gating was used to identify lymphocytes and exclude doublets and dead cells, respectively, among PBMCs stained with the four-antibody cocktail.\n(B) Left dot plot (CD5 vs CD19) shows how gated live lymphocyte singlets are divided into CD5−CD19+ Bcon, CD5+CD19− Tcon, and CD5+CD19+ subpopulations – The identities of CD5−CD19+ cells and CD5+CD19− cells as Bcon and Tcon cells are confirmed by analysis each subpopulation for the lack or expression of the TCRαβ, respectively (not shown). Right dot plot (IgD vs TCRαβ) shows how gated CD5+CD19+ cells are used to identify DE subsets. DEs are divided into a major CD5+CD19+TCRαβ+IgD+ subset and a minor CD5+CD19+TCRαβ+IgD− cells (contains class-switched DEs, see Ahmed et al. Ahmed et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] for details).\n(C) This series of plots shows the steps used to verify identity of sorted DEs by re-running an aliquot of sorted DEs. Bcon, and Tcon cells. Numbers in quadrants indicate percentages.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1140-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Exclusion of CD5hi and TCRαβhi cells from analysis enhances purity of sorted DEs",
    "In this experiment, a PBMC sample from T1D patients was stained using our four-antibody cocktail, acquired and two gating strategies used to identify and sort DEs as shown below. Purity was determined by rerunning sorted DEs. Top panel. The plots show how inclusion of all CD5+ cells (left plot) and TCRαβ+ cells (middle plot) significantly lowers purity of sorted DEs (right plot). The number in the right plot shows percentage of bona fide DEs (19%) among sorted cells. Bottom panel. The plots show how restricting gating to CD5lowCD19+ (left plot) and TCRαβlow cells (middle plot) cells significantly increases purity of sorted DEs (right plot). The number in the right plot shows percentage of bona fide DEs (82%) among sorted cells.\nPart II. Strategy for sorting DE cells\nPreparation of single-cell suspensions and antibody staining\nTiming: 2–3 h\nWe sort DEs using about 50 ×106 fresh PBMCs initially suspended in 500 μL FACS buffer.\nAbout 50 μL (∼ 5 ×106 cells) will be used for preparing the single color compensation and unstained controls.\nThe remaining 45 ×106 cells in about 450 μL will be used for sorting.\nWe use the same staining strategy and the antibody cocktail described in Part I: Identifying DEs by flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1.1]. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for the antibody panel and dilution factors.\nPrepare and label single-color compensation control tubes and unstained control tube by pipetting 10 μL of PBMC suspension (5 ×105 cells) from the “master tube” into each control tube. Then add 90 μL FACS buffer for a total volume of 100 μL in the compensation control tubes.\nStain the sorting sample using 20 μL of each fluorophore-conjugated antibody and stain the compensation control tubes using 5 μL of antibody.\nNote: It is always recommended that you identify and use appropriate antibody concentrations.",
    "Note: Importantly, we use propodeum iodide (PI) – however, you can use your preferred viability dye – for detection and exclusion of dead cells. We perform this step after staining and immediately before running samples and data acquisition (see step 21 in Part II: Sorting of DEs and autologous Tcon and Bcon cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2.2]).\nGently vortex each FACS tube for mixing cells and homogeneous staining.\nIncubate tubes for 20 min on ice or at 4oC, protected from light.\nWash samples at least three times using 2–3 mL of FACS buffer each time.\nFinally, resuspend the sorting sample into a total volume of 3 mL and each of the compensation control samples into a total volume of 500 μL of FACS buffer. Now, the samples are ready for sorting.\nSorting of DEs and autologous Tcon and Bcon cells\nWe use High Speed MoFlo Legacy Cell Sorter - Beckman Coulter – However, you can use a sorter of your choice.\nTiming: 6–8 h\nImmediately before sorting, filter the “sort sample” using a FACS tube with 35 μm cell strainer cap to eliminate residual cell clumps.\nAdd PI to identify and exclude dead cells using stock solution of 1 mg/mL and final dilution of 1–2 μg / mL.\nSetting up the compensation and gating strategy\nAcquire approximately 10,000 events from each compensation tube to perform compensation setup.\nFinalize the compensation using the fully-stained sample and make final adjustments as necessary (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCollection of sorted subpopulations\nSet up your sorter for sorting. We use a 70 μm nozzle, sheath pressure of 60 psi, drop drive frequency of 95–98 kHz. The flow rate for sorting is approximately 1000 events/second.",
    "Sort your sample into three or four subpopulations, depending on whether DEs are sorted as separate (IgD+ and IgD−) subsets or as a one mixed population. The other two subpopulations are Bcon and Tcon cells.\nSort DEs (IgD+ and IgD−) into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes each containing about 700–800 μL of lymphocyte collection medium (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nSorted Bcon and Tcon cells into 5 mL polypropylene tubes each containing 1 mL of lymphocyte collection medium.\nNote: You can sort cells into your own preferred medium that is appropriate with the goal of your experiment.\nPurity Check. Checking the purity of sorted cells is an extremely crucial step in validating identity of sorted DEs and whether they are contaminated by doublets (which usually fall apart during a sample re-run).\nTo check purity of sorted DE cells, re-run an aliquot of sorted DE cells (100–150 μL) on the sorter using the original gating strategy.\nNote: Because of the low number of collected events please do not wash, re-stain or centrifuge samples to avoid cell loss; also note that the flow rate rarely exceeds 1000 event/sec during a re-run.\nNote: If necessary, you can dedicate a full sorting session for checking the validity of your gating strategy and use the information gained to inform future sorting strategies.\nDetermine the percentage of DE cells in sorted sample by using the same gating strategy.\nNote: We generally achieve 70%–90% purity for sorted DE cells and 99% for B and T cell populations.\nSorted cells are ready to be used for specific purposes.\nPart III. Generation of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-immortalized DE lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and single DE clones",
    "This section details our method for immortalizing DEs using EBV to generate DE lymphoblastoid cell lines and clones using an established method (Traggiai et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). All steps should be performed under sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet.\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nThe procedure requires culturing sorted DEs onto fibroblast feeder layers in the presence of infectious EBV as outlined below:\nDay 1: Preparation of fibroblast feeder layers\nThaw 1 vial of irradiated-fibroblasts (ATCC 55-X) using the same method described in the “thawing cryopreserved PBMCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]” section. Each vial usually contains 1 × 106 cells in 1 mL.\nResuspend fibroblasts to a cell density of 2.5 ×105 / mL using CTM.\nGently pipette your sample up and down with a serological pipette to thoroughly mix the cells.\nPlate 200 μL of irradiated-fibroblasts onto wells of a 96-well flat bottom tissue-culture plate (50,000 cells / well).\nIncubate the tissue culture plate overnight (18 h) at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. It is recommended that you subculture at least once on fibroblast-coated wells to ensure robust growth.\nDay 2: Sorting and culturing DEs on fibroblast layers in the presence of EBV-infectious medium\nSort DEs, using the method described in Part II[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], using freshly isolated PBMCs (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPrepare infectious medium by diluting 1 mL EBV solution (B95-8 cells - ATCC VR-1492) to 30% in CTM containing 2.5 μg/mL CpG ODN 2006 (ODN7909)\nSuspend sorted DEs in the EBV-infectious medium\nSeed DEs onto the fibroblast feeder layers using 50 or 100 DE cells / well.\nDay 3–7: Check cultures for DE growth\nCheck cultures on a daily basis under light microscope for cell growth and any sign of contamination.",
    "After about one week, clusters of dividing cells become visible in culture wells under light microscopy. As time progresses, dividing cells will make clumps that are visible macroscopically and culture medium begins to turn yellow.\nMaintain the culture medium by replacing half of the spent medium with fresh infectious medium (CTM containing 2.5 μg/mL CpG ODN, 2006) usually when cell density reaches to 80%–90%.\nTypically, culture medium will need replenishment every 5–7 days.\nEBV-transformed DEs gradually expand and cultures need to be scaled up by transferring contents into wells of 24-well tissue culture plate and then onto wells of 6-well plates.\nOptional: you can subculture on fibroblast feeding layers to enhance viability and growth.\nExpand cultures to 75–100 mL using flasks over the next few weeks. These lines are referred to as DE lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Store generated LCLs at −80°C or liquid nitrogen.\nOptional: you can subculture on fibroblast feeding layers to enhance viability and growth.\nGeneration of single clones from immortalized DE LCLs using limiting dilution: Use LCL to generate single DE clones, using standard limiting dilution methods (Hamad et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Serially dilute and seed 10, 3.3, 1.1, and 0.33 DEs onto fibroblast coated 96-well microplates using 100 μL of CpG 2006 containing CTM as described above. Using clones from 0.33 cell / well ensures a maximum of one cell per well.\nNote: Potential uses of clones include 1) Antibody production, and 2) Cloning, expression and generation of recombinant BCR and TCR from the same DE cell.",
    "Note: Cryopreservation of DE LCLs and clones: When freezing down cells, centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 5–6 minutes at room temperature. Remove supernatants and re-suspend cell pellets in cold freezing media at 0.5–1× 107 cells / mL. Place tubes in liquid nitrogen for long term or −80°C for short term storage."
