    "The protocol herein adheres to the North Carolina State University's ethics guidelines for human research.\n1. Machine Preparing\nNOTE: The following protocol can be broadly applied to any whole body, clinical DXA and BMD scanner.\nPerform calibration once daily prior to scanning any individuals to ensure quality control. After calibration prompts appear upon start-up of the systems' software, scan a lumbar spine phantom of known density to ensure correct reading of the BMD scanner.\nIf the scanner being utilized does not have a quality control feature in the software, compare the lumbar spine results with those recorded on the spine phantom to ensure the correct measurements.\n\tNOTE: The spine phantom, should be placed in the center of the scan table and lumbar spine should be selected for quality control.\nPerform additional tests (e.g., radiographic uniformity) as needed. Perform radiographic uniformity every ten scans maximum to ensure that the entire scanning surface is detected by the scanner.\nIf the scanner being utilized does not have a radiographic uniformity test in the quality control menu, select whole body scan to ensure the scanner can read the entire scanning surface.\n\tNOTE: Always center the exam table following quality control and before performing exams.\n2. Performing Exam\nCreate patient profiles\n\t\nCreate new patient profiles for each new individual scanned to maintain chain of custody and to ensure scans are correctly associated with individual remains. If the individual being scanned is identified, proceed to step 2.1.2. If the individual is unidentified, establish the biological profile prior to scanning to employ the most accurate database references.\nEnter demographic information into the patient profile including estimated stature if unknown. Ensure that you select the most appropriate equation for the remains being investigated.",
    "Select scan type. For steps 2.2, select Anterior-Posterior (AP) Lumbar Spine. For step 2.3, select Left or Right Hip scans.\nAP Lumbar Spine scan\n\tNOTE: Require lumbar vertebrae (L) one to four.\n\t\nSelect Perform Exam | choose patient | Select scan type |AP Lumbar Spine | Next. Select an open container at least as large as the articulated segment of L1-L4.\n\t\tNOTE: The one used in this study is 48.26L X 26.85W X 8.89D in cm (19 in. L X 10.57 in. W X 3.5 in. D).\nFill the bottom of the container with rice as a soft tissue proxy.\n\t\tNOTE: Any kind of rice can work as a soft tissue proxy.\nPlace L1-L4 in anatomical position (spinous processes should be oriented downwards) in the rice with approximately 0.7 cm (0.28 in.) between each vertebral body as shown in Figure 1A. Ensure that the superior and inferior articular facts are articulated, but the vertebral bodies are not in contact with one another.\nCenter the scanning table and place the container with L1 is oriented towards top (head) of scanning table and L4 is placed 1 cm superior to the intersecting crosshairs. The vertical laser line should be bisecting the vertebrate bodies of all four vertebrae (Figure 1B).\nCover the exposed bone with rice.\nSelect Start Scan.\nProceed to analysis (step 3.1), If scanned properly (Figure 2). Repeat the scan if not all vertebrae are captured.\nLeft or Right Hip scans\n\tNOTE: Figure 3 is from a left hip exam, if performing a right hip exam, positioning is mirrored.\n\t\nSelect Perform Exam | choose patient | Select scan type | Left Hip (or Right Hip) | Next. Select an open container at least as large as the articulated os coxa and femur being scanned.",
    "NOTE: The one used in this study is 88.5L X 41.5W X 13.9D in cm (34.85 in. L X 16.35 in. W X 5.47 in. D).\nFill the bottom of the container with rice (any kind of rice will work as a soft tissue proxy).\nPlace the os coxa with the acetabulum and obturator foramen facing laterally with the pubic bone oriented medially. Position the ischial tuberosity beneath the femoral head as it articulates with the acetabulum (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: Positioning of the ischial tuberosity is most important because if it extends laterally below the femoral neck it will inflate BMD estimates.\nPlace the femur with the femoral head in the acetabulum and with the greater trochanter and femoral head in line parallel to the scanning table (i.e., in the same plane). Ensure that the femoral shaft is medially rotated with the distal condyle rotated medially and slightly higher than the medial condyle (Figure 3B).\nCenter the scanning table, then move the position of the scanning arm and table until the laser crosshairs are oriented so that the center is directly above the subtrochanteric area of the femur with the vertical line bisecting the top-half of the femoral shaft (Figure 3A). Do not move the remains once they have been positioned. Move the table ensures that bones remain in proper anatomical position.\nCover the remaining visible portion of the femoral-acetabular joint with rice.\nSelect Start Scan.\nProceed to analysis in step 3.2 if scanned properly (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: Scans should capture the alignment of the joint such that the midline of the proximal femur is in one plane. The midline should lie from the center of the femoral head to just under the greater trochanter.\n3. Analyzing Exams\nAnalyze AP Lumbar Spine scan",
    "Following the scan, an Exit Exam prompt box will appear. Select Analyze Scan.\n\t\tNOTE: Software will separate each vertebra into their own regions to assess individual elements and total BMD when scanned properly as shown in Figure 5.\nSelect Results in the Scan Analysis window. Select vertebral lines If the vertebrae are not properly separated for minor adjustments or directly reposition vertebrae for rescanning.\nObtain both age-matched and population specific BMD reference measures to calculate a z-score when performing juvenile BMD scans.\nCollect results graph for visualization of the individual relative to the reference population.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 6 shows scan results for AP Lumbar Spine of a 31-year-old female.\nAnalyze hip scan.\n\t\nFollowing the scan, an Exit Exam prompt box will appear. Select Analyze Scan.\n\t\tNOTE: Software will automatically capture the femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and trochanteric area as shown in Figure 7, if scanned properly.\nSelect the bone map tool to add or delete areas that are not part of the femoral neck and trochanteric region when not read exactly by the software due to slight malposition. Make midline adjustments directly on scan by selecting the neck tool and repositioning the midline.\nReposition and rescan if these small adjustments do not allow the proper alignment shown in Figure 7.\nSelect Results in the Scan Analysis window. Compare to reference data for femoral neck, trochanteric region, and the intertrochanteric region in the software for adults.\nCompare results with the appropriate age- and population-matched references when assessing juveniles.\nUse the t-score for adults as it is the most appropriate to differentially assess pathological conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 8 shows the ideal scan results for the left hip analysis of a 31-year-old female.\nSubscription Required.
