    "The experiments in this study were approved by the ethics committees of the Taiwan Landseed Hospital (IRB-13-05) and the National Central University. All experiments were conducted in accordance with all relevant and applicable governmental and institutional guidelines and regulations during this study.\n1. Solution and Media Preparation\nPolymer purification\nPurify P-IA with carboxylic acid group with a degree of hydrolysis of >96.5% by washing P-IA with ethanol. Place 20 g of P-IA into 200 mL of ethanol in a 500-mL conical beaker and agitate on a magnetic stirrer for 24-30 h. Exchange the ethanol with fresh ethanol every 8-10 h.\nRemove P-IA from the ethanol by filtration using a Büchner funnel.\nDry P-IA by vacuum drying at room temperature for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to clean the trap in the vacuum drying system (by the removal of ethanol) frequently, especially during the initial few hours, because the trap tends to become clogged after the removal of a large amount of ethanol from P-IA.\nPreparation of the P-IA solution\n\tNOTE: Add the polymer very slowly into the solvent (water). It is recommended to take at least 15 min to add the P-IA into the solvent. If solvent is added into the polymer, the polymer would not be dissolved completely. Be careful not to generate explosive boiling of the P-IA solution. Use protective glasses during preparation of the P-IA solution. The heating process of the P-IA solution is essential to dissolve crystalline P-IA. It is suggested (and preferable) to prepare the P-IA solution in a relatively clean experimental room, if possible.",
    "Dissolve the P-IA in pure water to a 0.050 weight% concentration for the cell cultivation experiment or a 0.50 weight% concentration for the rheometer measurement: for example, dissolve 50 mg of P-IA in 100 mL of pure water for cell culture and 500 mg of P-IA in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water for the rheometer measurements.\nAgitate the P-IA solution for 1 h on the hot plate.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid explosive boiling, do not heat the solution over 95 °C. Explosive boiling of the polymer solution at a high temperature may generate skin burns. Therefore, perform the heating of P-IA very carefully, and monitor the temperature of the P-IA solution during the heating.\nAfter the P-IA solution was cooled at ambient temperature, agitate the P-IA solution at room temperature for 48 h. Leave hot P-IA solution on the hot plate without heating, and then leave it without agitation at room temperature for 20-24 h to ensure that air bubbles are not present in the P-IA solution.\nPreparation of the crosslinking solution\nMake the composition of the crosslinking solution 1.0 weight% glutaraldehyde from 25% aqueous glutaraldehyde solution, 20.0 weight% Na2SO4 using 99% > purity, and 1.0 weight% H2SO4. For example, for one 6 or 12 well cell culture plate, add 100 µL of glutaraldehyde solution, 2 g of sodium sulfate, and 100 µL of sulfuric acid into 10 mL of pure water.\nHuman ES/PS cell culture media\n\tNOTE: Use DMEM/F12 media, essential 6 media, and essential 8 media for the cell culture.\n\t\nReturn frozen 50X Essential 8 supplement slowly to the solution overnight by thawing in a 4 °C refrigerator.",
    "Add one bottle of 50X Essential 8 supplement into one bottle of Essential 8 basal media. Separate the media into small aliquots (50 mL each) in 100 mL centrifugation tubes, then store the media at -20 °C.\n2. P-IA Hydrogel Dish Preparation\nP-IA film preparation\nInject a 1 mL aliquot of the P-IA solution into a 35 mm TCP dish, and dry the dish in a 45 °C oven for 2 days to produce a P-IA film in a clean bench.\nCrosslinking of the P-IA hydrogel dishes\nImmerse the P-IA films into an aqueous crosslinking solution for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h.\n\t\tNOTE: 'P-IA-X' (e.g., P-IA-12 h) refers to a P-IA hydrogel crosslinked for X h (e.g., 12 h).\nAfter crosslinking, rinse the P-IA hydrogels with pure water at ambient temperature, and then keep hydrogels in pure water at ambient temperature in a clean bench.\nSterilize the P-IA hydrogels by immersion in a 75.0 volume/volume% ethanol solution for 1 min, rinse the P-IA hydrogels in pure water six times, and then keep the P-IA hydrogels in pure water until used for cell cultivation.\nPreparation of P-IA hydrogel dishes grafted with oligopeptide or ECM\nActivate the P-IA hydrogels via immersion in 1 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 mg/mL N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 10 mg/mL N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 1 h at 37 °C or 4 h at 4 °C.\nRinse the P-IA hydrogels with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) 3 times and immerse the P-IA hydrogels in a PBS solution containing 1 mL of oligopeptide (100-1,500 µg/mL) or ECM (10-100 µg/mL) for 24 h at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The oligopeptide sequences and ECMs used for stem cell culture are summarized in Table 1.",
    "After grafting the oligopeptide or ECM, wash the P-IA hydrogels with pure water 3 times.\n\t\tNOTE: The P-IA hydrogels grafted with Y µg/mL of oligopeptide or ECM (Z) are hereafter referred to as P-IA-Xh-Z orP-IA-Xh-Z-Y, where X refers to the crosslinking time (h), Y indicates the concentration of the oligopeptide or ECM, and Z indicates a different oligopeptide or ECM.\n3.

Characterization of Human ES/iPS Cell Characterization\nEvaluation of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity\nMeasure the alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of human ES/iPS cells using a standard alkaline phosphatase live staining.\nImmunostaining\nPerform immunostaining of Tra-1-81, SSEA-4, Sox2, and Oct3/4 on hES and hiPS cells to investigate pluripotency following the conventional protocol28,32.",
    "Add a 0.5 mL volume of 4% (volume/volume) paraformaldehyde into each 24 well dish in which the human ES/iPS cells were cultured, and subsequently, incubate the dishes for 15 min at 4 °C to fix the cells.\nAspirate the paraformaldehyde solution from each well.
