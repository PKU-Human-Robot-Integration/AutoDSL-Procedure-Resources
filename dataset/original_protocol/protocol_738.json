    "**Plating Mouse embryonic fibroblasts \\(MEFs):**\n• Irradiated MEFs from commercial sources or home-made MEFs can be used\n• MEF culture medium: DMEM-high glucose with 10% FBS\n• Plate MEFs on 0.1% gelatin \\(autoclaved, made in PBS) coated plates \\(gelatin coating is done for 20 min at 37 <sup>0</sup>C)\n• Plating density for 1 well of a 6-well plate is 0.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> MEFs per well, plating density for one 10 cm plate is 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> MEFs per plate\n**Human ES/iPS culture on irradiated MEFs**\n**ES cell medium:**\nDMEM/F12 \\(# 11330-032, Gibco) containing 20% KO-SR \\(# 10828-010, Gibco), 2 mM L-Glutamine \\(# 35050-038), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids \\(# 11140-035), 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol \\(# 31350-010) \\(all from Life Technologies) and 10 ng/ml basic FGF \\(R&D systems).\n**Culturing and splitting human ES cells on MEFs:**\n• Mark differentiated and dark centered ES colonies, remove these colonies with aspirator, later remove all media\n• Wash once with PBS\n• Add Collagenase type IV \\(# 17104019, Life Technologies) at final concentration of 1 mg/ml prepared in DMEM/F12\n• Incubate the cells with Collagenase at 37 <sup>0</sup>C, 5 min\n• Aspirate collagenase, wash once with ES media\n• Add 1 ml ES media, scrape cells with scraper, triturate gently thrice with a 1 ml pipette and distribute* equally on MEFs.\n*- After splitting, ES cells become confluent usually in 6-7 days\n- ESCs from 1 well of a 6-well plate can make a full 6-well plate \\(1:6 split)\n- 1 well of a 6-well plate can give one 10 cm dish for EB making.\n**Embryoid body formation and Hematopoietic Differentiation:**\nTo obtain at least 8 wells of a 6-well plate during ES-to-blood differentiation, four 10cm plates of ESCs are a good start.\n• Remove media from ESCs \\(10 cm dishes), wash once with PBS",
    "• Add Dispase, 5 ml / plate \\(Dispase # 17105041, Life Technologies), at final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in DMEM/F12\n• Incubate cells at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 30 min \\(tap the plate at every 10 min, 10 min, 5 min, 5 min)\n• Collect cells in a 50 ml tube\n• Add 15 ml DMEM/F12, let cells get washed and sink\n• Wash one more time in the same way \\(this removes Dispase)\n• Add 10 ml Mesototal to the cells\n• Plate the detached ESCs in ultra-low attachment 10 cm dishes \\(Corning), \\(this is Day 0 of the blood differentiation protocol)\n• Until Day 8, these EBs will be in suspension culture in Mesototal medium, for mesoderm commitment. On Day 1 and 2, there will be complete media change \\(100% Mesototal) to get rid of dead cells and debris. On day 4 and 6, there will be 50% Mesototal media change to supply fresh growth factors to the developing EBs.\n• At day 8, EBs are plated on 0.08 μg/mm<sup>2</sup> Matrigel \\(BD Biosciences) in 6-well tissue culture plates and 50% Mesototal media was exchanged of fresh media on day 10 and 12. Further differentiation toward hematopoietic cells was carried out until day 14 in MesoTotal medium. \n**Cyclic AMP induction:**\nApplication of fresh medium and cAMP induction with 10 μM forskolin \\(Stemgent) and 500 μM IBMX \\(3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was carried out at days 10 and 12 of differentiation. Forskolin specifically increases intracellular cAMP levels by activating the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase <sup>16</sup>. IBMX is a phosphodiesterase \\(PDE) inhibitor that specifically prevents PDE-mediated dephosphorylation of cAMP to AMP <sup>17</sup>. Thus, combining forskolin with IBMX elevates intracellular cAMP by increasing cAMP production and preventing its dephosphorylation.\n**EB harvest at D14 for FACS or CFU assay:**",
    "• Collect media with the EBs in 15 ml tube, let the EBs sink and aspirate media\n• Wash EBs twice with 1 ml PBS\n• Add 1 ml Tryple \\(# 12604-013, Life Technologies), incubate 5 min, triturate 3 times\n• Another 5-8 min incubation, triturate 10 times, collect cells\n• Add DMEM+10%FCS, wash and collect rest of the EBs\n• Add the collected cells/EBs slowly in a 5 ml syringe fitted with a 21G needle \\(BRAUN, Sterican, # 4665503; 0.80x50 mm, 21G x 2’’)\n• Pass through the syringe 4 times \\(inclined to tube’s wall)\n• Push cells through cell strainer \\(BD # 340632; 50 µm cup filcons) fitted on top of a new 15 ml tube\n• Flush the cell strainer with 3 ml PBS+2%FCS to collect any remaining cells\n• Spin down, resuspend in 1 ml PBS+2%FCS, count cells\n• Proceed for FACS or CFU assay"
