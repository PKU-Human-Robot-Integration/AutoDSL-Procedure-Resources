    "Sacrifice the mice (C57BL/6 or MDX) by delivering increasing concentrations of CO2 and remove hindlimb muscles. Weigh the muscle mass.Leave them in cold PBS-containing dish.Remove visible tendon, adipose tissue and vessel.Mince the muscles on new dish (not containing PBS) using a curved tip scissor for few minutes until the tissue appears like a mush.Transfer the tissue into a 50 ml plastic tube and add 0.2% collagenase II in DMEM (serum-free). Volume to use is 2-4 ml of collagenase for 1 g of muscle weight: Usually each mouse allows obtaining 1-1.5 g of tissue. Put plastic tubes into a shaking thermostatic bath, at 37 °C for 1 h.Separate undigested from digested material by centrifugation at 500 rpm. All the centrifugations are at room temperature. Supernatant (digested material) was removed, diluted with room temperature PBS (approximately 50 ml of PBS/1 g muscle) and go through a 18 G-10 ml syringe to create a single cell suspension (about 10 passages through the needle). Add to the un-digesting muscle fresh collagenase solution (using the same volume of step 6) and leave in the shaking thermostatic bath, at 37 °C for additional 30 min. Then, repeat step 7. Discard eventually indigested material that may remain after the second centrifugation procedure.Muscle slurries obtained by the two digestions were pulled and filtered through 70 μm cell strainer cap and subsequently through 40 μm cell strainer cap, using 50 ml syringes and 50 ml plastic tubes. Centrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and remove supernatant using a pipette. Eliminate blood red cells by re-suspending cell with 1-2 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer.Dilute erythrocyte lysis buffer by addiction of 50 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS and centrifuge 2,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "After removing the supernatant, using a pipette, add 1 ml PBS containing 10% of FBS and count the cells.Centrifuge tubes 2,000 rpm for 10 min and incubate recovered cells for 30 min with anti-SM/C2.6-Biotin on ice. Use 1 µl of antibodies for 1 x 106 cells in 100 µl of PBS containing 2% of FBS. Add 1 ml wash buffer and centrifuge 2,000 rpm for 5 min.After removing the supernatant, incubate on ice for 30 min with Streptavidin-PE and with the other labeled antibodies [anti-CD31-PECy7 and anti-CD45-PECy7, anti-α7-Integrin-PE (for MDX mice), anti-PDGFRα-APC, anti-LY-6A/E SCA-1-APC/Cy7] and with 7-aminoactinomycin D. As in step 14, use 1 µl of antibodies for 1 x 106 cells in 100 µl of PBS containing 2% of FBS. Add 50 ml of wash buffer and centrifuge 2,000 rpm for 5 min.After removing the supernatant, add 2 ml of sorting buffer/mice.To set up the instrument, sample of about 50-100,000 cells were in parallel individually stained with the each single antibody or with 7-aminoactinomycin (single staining for compensation) in the same conditions of samples to sort. A sample of 50-100,000 cells was also no incubated with any antibody (unstained control). After 30 min, add 1 ml of wash buffer then centrifuge (2,000 rpm for 5 min). Remove supernatant and add 200-300 µl of PBS containing 2% of FBS. For cell sorter setting: Using unstained control, exclude debris and dead cells by forward scatter and side scatter and set basal fluorescence (Figure 1A). Then make 7-AAD gating using sample stained with 7-aminoactinomycin (gate 1, 7AAD negative cells and gate 2) to further eliminate dead ells.Compensate fluorescence using the samples individually stained with each antibodies and then select in sample to sort FAP cells as CD45-/CD31- (gate 3)/smc2.6- or α7integrin- (gate 4)/SCA-1+ and PDGFRα+ (gate 5) cells.",
    "To improve purity, we preferred to employ anti- smc2.6 for WT mice and anti-α7integrin for mdx mice.At the end of sorting, plate FAP cells at 1 x 104 cells/cm2 in multiwell plates previously coated with Matrigel and culture for 6 days in growth medium plus b-FGF in a humidified incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2)."
