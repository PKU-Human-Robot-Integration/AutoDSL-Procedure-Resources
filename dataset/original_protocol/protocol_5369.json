    "Harvest around 1 x 106 adherent cells by trypsinization or collect 1-5 ml of cells that grow in suspension. Cells should be in subconfluent conditions.Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 300 x g at room temperature and aspirate the medium.Resuspend cell pellet in DPBS and wash twice with 10 ml pre-warmed DPBS by centrifugation.Resuspend cell pellet in 200-500 μl of the pulse medium (see Recipes). Incubate cells for the desired duration of the pulse in a 37 °C water bath.Terminate the pulse by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 sec at maximal speed.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of chase medium (37 °C, see Recipes).Take aliquots at several time points (4-8 time points are usually sufficient). Intervals between time points should be determined according to the estimated half-life of the protein of interest. Transfer the aliquots to new 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of ice-cold DPBS and keep on ice.Centrifuge cells for 15 sec at maximal speed at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in appropriate volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (see Recipes) freshly supplemented with 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Usually 1 million cells per 100 μl of lysis buffer gives a suitable concentration of cell lysates.Incubate cell lysates for 20 min at 4 °C (cold room) under slow rotation (2-5 x g).Centrifuge lysate for 15 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials and cell debris.Transfer the clear lysates to a fresh tube and discard the pellet.Note: For adherent cells, this protocol can also be applied while cells are attached to the tissue culture dishes without trypsinization by using several dishes of cells at the same confluency, one for each time point.",
    "However, in that case the addition of pulse and chase media should be done quickly to avoid variation in pulse/chase time among dishes especially when applying short time intervals. Cell lysis in this case is done by adding the lysis buffer directly to cell monolayer while incubating on ice for 10 min then collecting the cell lysates using a scraper. Tubes containing the lysates are kept for another 10 min on ice with occasional inversion. Lysates are then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C to remove insoluble material and clear lysates are transferred to fresh tubes.Quantify protein concentration in total cell lysates from different aliquots/time points using Bradford colorimetric assay and adjust the concentration of lysates using freshly added lysis buffer to approximately 1 mg/ml.Continue with the immunoprecipitation step: Add antibody against the protein of interest at the recommended dilution for immunoprecipitation application together with 50 μl 10% Protein A-Sepharose beads and 0.5 mg of protein (in about 500 μl of lysate). Shake or rotate head over head. Incubate under constant rotation at 4 °C for 1-2 h or overnight at 4 °C (cold room) under slow rotation (2-5 x g).Pellet the immunoprecipitated complexes by centrifugation at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash the bead complexes 3-4 times by centrifugation at 300 x g for 2 min and discarding the supernatant and adding 1 ml ice cold wash buffer (see Recipes).Resuspend beads in 20 µl of 4x SDS sample buffer and boil samples on a 95 °C heat block for 5 min.Load samples onto SDS-PAGE gels.",
    "Note: The acrylamide percentage of acrylamide in the separation gel should be determined according to the size of protein of interest: the higher the molecular weight of the protein the less percentage gel to be used. Run at constant 50 mA for stacking gel and 70 mA for separation gel.Fix gels with 10 ml fixation solution (50% methanol + 10% acetic acid) for 1 h at room temperature with slow rocking.Dry gels in a gel dryer for 1.5 h at -80 °C.Expose films to the radioactive gels overnight at room temperature.Quantify images of films using imaging software such as ImageJ."
