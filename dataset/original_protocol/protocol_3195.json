(The table shows the extension time for darH in pJK6.1.)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2966_9.csv\nPause point: The PCR reaction can be stored overnight at 4°C prior to agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA purification.\nPerform agarose gel electrophoresis for checking the PCR results.\nPrepare a 1% agarose gel.\nPlace the gel tray in a gel caster to seal the edges of the gel tray and put a comb with an appropriate number of wells in the comb guide of the gel tray.\nWeigh in 0.4 g agarose and suspend it in 40 mL 1× TAE buffer. Heat the suspension in a microwave to dissolve the agarose.\nAfter the agarose is completely dissolved add 4 μL SYBR safe.\nPour the gel into the gel tray and let it polymerize for approx. 20 min.\nLoading and running the gel.\nPrepare the electrophoresis chamber by filling in 1× TAE buffer.\nPlace the gel in the electrophoresis chamber\nPrepare a small strip of parafilm.",
    "Take out 3 μL of 6× loading dye and divide it in two drops on the parafilm (one drop per PCR sample).\nUse 3 μL of each PCR reaction and mix it with the loading dye drop on the parafilm (be careful to keep the drops separated) and load the mixture into the wells of the gel starting with the second well.\nAdd 10 μL of DNA Ladder into the first well and run the gel for 30 min at 120 V.\nAnalyze the gel under UV light.\nPCR reactions yielding signals of the correct size (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) can be purified by a PCR purification kit (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2966-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Agarose gel of the PCR reactions for the construction of pJK6.1\nLeft: Agarose gel of the amplification of pZW-ADC9 with JCK7 and JCK8. A signal at the expected size of 5704 bp can be observed. The PCR reaction can be purified with a PCR purification kit and used for Gibson assembly. Right: Agarose gel of the PCR reaction of darH with JCK12 and JCK13. A signal at the expected size of 1555 bp can be detected. However, since there are other unspecific signals it is recommended to purify this signal from the gel before using it for a Gibson assembly.\nOptional: After amplification of the plasmid backbone the sample can be treated with DpnI to get rid of template plasmid DNA to avoid false positives in the Gibson assembly.\nNote: If the PCR shows unspecific signals (i.e., fragments not showing the desired size in the agarose gel analysis), it is more suitable to purify the desired fragment by cutting the correct signal from the gel.",
    "Pause point: Unpurified PCR reactions can be stored at 4°C or −20°C until next day. Purified DNA should be stored at −20°C until further usage.\nPerform a Gibson assembly using the PCR fragments (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nFor 2–3 fragments use 0.02–0.5 pmol of DNA.\nFor calculating the required amount of the fragments use the following equation:   p m o l =  (  w e i g h t  i n  n g  )  ×  1000  (  b a s e  p a i r s × 650  d a l t i o n s  )     or the NEBioCalculator tool.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nAdd the calculated volume of DNA to the Gibson assembly master mix4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and adjust the volume to 20 μL with ddH2O.\nIncubate the mixture for 1 h at 50°C in a thermocycler.\nRemove the salts from the assembled plasmid.\nFill a Petri dish (Ø94 mm) approx. three quarters with ultrapure water.\nPlace a MF-Millipore 0.025 μm MCE Membrane filter (13 mm) on the water surface.\nCarefully pipette the Gibson assembly mixture on the filter and incubate it with closed lid for 1 h.\nAfter incubation carefully transfer the Gibson assembly mixture into an Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: When placing the membrane filter disk on the water do not touch it with your hands. Use a forceps to carefully take it from the packing and wear gloves.\nTransform the assembled plasmid with E. coli Top10.\nThaw the competent cells on ice (when freshly prepared skip this step).\nAdd 5 μL of the salt free Gibson assembly mix from step 3b.\nTransfer the mixture into an electroporation cuvette (0.2 cm gap) and make sure the liquid is at the bottom of the cuvette and free from air bubbles.",
    "Place the cuvette in an electroporator (MicroPulser; Bio-Rad) and apply a voltage of 2.5 kV (bacteria Ec2). (A typical time constant is ∼5 ms.)\nImmediately add 800 μL LB medium and mix gently by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer the culture into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nAfter incubation centrifuge the culture for 4 min at 3000 × g.\nDecant the supernatant until only approx. 200 μL are left.\nResuspend the cell pellet in the remainder of the supernatant and spread it on an LB agarose plate containing kanamycin.\nIncubate the agar plate overnight at 37°C (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nVerify the correct assembly of the plasmid.\nPick colonies and plate them on a fresh LB agar plate containing kanamycin. Simultaneously, use the same colonies to inoculate 4 mL liquid LB medium containing kanamycin in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nMark fields on a Petri dish and number them. Add liquid LB agar containing kanamycin and allow the agar to solidify. Fill three 15 mL flacon tubes with 4 mL LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and number them from one to three.\nUse an autoclaved toothpick to pick up one colony, streak it in field number 1 and transfer the toothpick into the liquid medium of falcon tube number one.\nRepeat this step with two more colonies.\nPlate 10 to 15 more colonies without inoculation in liquid medium in case you want to test more colonies later on.\nIncubate the agar plate at 37°C and the liquid cultures at 180 rpm and 37°C overnight.\nOn the next day isolate the plasmids using a bacterial plasmid isolation kit and wrap the agar plate in parafilm for long-term storage at 4°C.\nPause point: Purified plasmids are stable for months if they are stored at −20°C.",
    "Perform a restriction digest with the three isolated plasmids.\nChoose a restriction enzyme that preferably has a cutting site in your plasmid and in the newly inserted fragment, for example EcoRI for pJK6.1 and SmaI for pJK9.1.\nMeasure the plasmid concentration with a NanoDrop.\nCalculate the volume needed for an amount of 1000 ng of plasmid.\nThe volume of the restriction digest mix should be approx. 2.5× bigger than the plasmid volume. Calculate the ingredients as it can be seen in the table for the restriction digest reaction mix.\nPrepare the restriction digest reaction mix by combining the ingredients in the calculated amounts and incubate for 1 h. The incubation temperature needs to be chosen according to the specific incubation temperature of the selected restriction enzyme.\nPerform an agarose gel electrophoresis as described in step 2 by adding the appropriate amount of 6× loading dye and loading the whole reaction mix to the wells of the gel.\nIn case the correct restriction pattern appears on the gel the plasmid should be sent for sequencing with primers covering the overlapping part of the plasmid to the insert from both sides (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2966-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Agarose gel of the restriction digest of three pJK6.1 plasmids isolated from three different colonies using EcoRI\nExpected is a pattern with signals at 3536 bp, 2257 bp, 1251 bp, and 177 bp. Clones 1 and 3 show the correct pattern (177 bp not shown due to low signal intensity). The Gibson assembly of these two plasmids was most likely successful and they can be sent for a final sequencing check.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2966_10.csv\nCompare the sequence of the theoretical construct in SnapGene3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] with the experimentally obtained sequence to verify the assembled plasmid.",
    "Transform a mutation free and correctly assembled plasmid with competent E. coli Bap1(DarR)/pGro7 cells as described in step 4 (but using kanamycin and chloramphenicol) to create the production strain.\nCreate glycerol stocks of the Top10 and Bap1 strains for long-term storage at −80°C.\nInoculate 4 mL LB medium supplemented with kanamycin with the colony from the stored E. coli Top10 plate that possesses the correct plasmid. Likewise, inoculate 4 mL LB medium containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol with a colony of the E. coli Bap1/pGro7 strain created in step 7. Both cultures are prepared in 15 mL falcon tubes.\nIncubate them overnight at 37°C and 180 rpm.\nThe next day take 600 μL from the culture and add them to a cryotube containing 600 µL sterile 50% glycerol.\nCarefully mix by pipetting up and down and store the tube at −80°C.\nHeterologous expression of the gene cluster\nTiming: 7 days\nIn this section, the whole gene cluster of the natural product containing the gene of unknown function is expressed using the strain E. coli Bap1/pGro7/pJK6.1, whose construction is outlined in the section “strain construction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]”.\nInoculate 4 mL LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin with E. coli Bap1/pGro7/pJK6.1 in a 15 mL falcon tube and incubate it overnight at 37°C and 180 rpm.\nOn the following day inoculate 20 mL LB medium containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol with 1 mL of the overnight culture in a 100 mL flask. Incubate at 37°C and 180 rpm.\nIncubate the cells until an OD600 value of 0.5 is reached, as described in the section preparation of electrocompetent E. coli Top10 and E. coli Bap1(DarR)/pGro7 cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nNote: If the cells are overgrown, restart the experiment using 1 mL of the remaining overnight culture. An OD600 value in the range of 0.48 up to 0.6 is acceptable.",
    "Induce the production by adding IPTG to the culture as well as KBr (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and continue incubation for 3 days at 18°C and 180 rpm.\nAfter 3 days of incubation take a sample and prepare it for LCMS measurement.\nTake a 500 μL sample from the culture and centrifuge it at 15.000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant will be added to the tip column later, as described in step 13f.\nDuring centrifugation prepare a stage tip column as it can be seen in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2966-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The sorbent should fit into the tip, but must not be pushed deeply into it.\nEquilibrate the column with 200 μL methanol by centrifugation at 3000 × g and 4°C for 4 min.\nRemove the flowthrough and add 200 μL eluent 1 (5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, see also materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nCentrifugate for 4 min at 3000 × g and 4°C.\nDiscard the flowthrough and add 200 μL of the sample supernatant.\nCentrifugate for 4 min at 3000 × g and 4°C.\nCritical: Methanol is a flammable, toxic and hazardous substance. Methanol should be handled carefully with personal safety equipment and it should be handled and under the fume hood.",
    "Note: The sample should pass through the column completely. If this is not the case after 4 min the centrifugation time can be increased. If prolonging the centrifugation time is not sufficient, the speed can be increased up to 4000 × g.\nAfter the sample has passed through the column another 200 μL can be added and the centrifugation step is repeated.\nWash the column with 30 μL eluent 1 by centrifugation at 3000 × g and 4°C for 4 min.\nElute the column by adding 30 μL eluent 2 (20% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, see also materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nCentrifugate for 4 min at 3000 × g and 4°C.\nRepeat the elution step.\nTransfer the sample to a LCMS vial, submit the sample to LCMS measurement and analyze the obtained data (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2966-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
