    "All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales (17/109A). Female athymic Balb/c nude mice, aged 8-10 weeks weighing 16-19 g, were used for this protocol. Mice were housed in micro-isolator cages and fed commercially available pelleted food and water ad libitum.\n1. Orthotopic pancreatic cancer implantation\nPrepare the cells for implantation. First, calculate the number of cells required for the procedure (1 x 106 luciferase-tagged AsPC-1 cells and 1 x 106 cancer-associated human pancreatic stellate cells [CAhPSCs] are required for each animal).\n\t\nMaintain these cells in a humidified temperature-controlled CO2 incubator and perform routine mycoplasma testing. Culture medium used for AsPC-1 and CAhPSCs are RPMI 1640 (with 300 mg/L L-glutamine, 20% v/v foetal bovine serum, 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin) and IMDM (with 4 mM L-glutamine, 10% v/v foetal bovine serum, 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin).\nUse standard cell culture techniques to trypsinize the cells into a cell suspension. Neutralize the trypsin using the respective complete culture medium at a volume twice that of the trypsin solution used.\nWash these cells twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspend into a mixture containing 1 x 106 AsPC-1 cells and 1 x 106 CAhPSCs in a 50 μL cell suspension.\nKeep this suspension on ice until use.\nPrepare a class II biosafety cabinet for the procedure. Use a heating mat overlaid by a sterile plastic drape. For magnification during the procedure, use a pair of 2.5x to 3.5x magnification surgical loupes.",
    "Prepare purse-string swabs by cutting a hole, 1 cm in diameter, into a gauze swab. Secure this hole with a purse-string suture. Any fine braided suture can be used for this (e.g., 5/0 polyglycolic acid suture). Braided suture material is recommended as it allows the loose knot to stay in place after tightening. This is illustrated in Figure 1a.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 80 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine by intraperitoneal injection.\nAdminister 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin antibiotic prophylaxis, 2.5 mg/kg flunixin analgesia and 1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously.\nOnce anesthetized, place the mouse on the sterile field in a supine position and apply povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol for skin preparation.\nMake a longitudinal incision in the skin of the left cranial quadrant of the abdomen, and then enter the abdomen by incising the muscular layer between forceps.\nLoad a 29 G insulin syringe with 50 μL of cell suspension–this equates to 1 x 106 CAhPSCs and 1 x 106 luciferase-tagged AsPC-1 cells per injectate. Mount it on the injection device. The design and function of this injection device is explained in detail in Figure 1b and its legend.\nPlace the purse-string swab over the laparotomy incision and then exteriorize the spleen and pancreatic tail through the opening of this swab. Tighten the purse-string to gently encircle the body of the pancreas, exposing the pancreatic tail for injection. It is important to be tight enough that the gauze contacts the pancreas circumferentially while at the same time not constricting it.",
    "Using a pair of forceps, grasp the tail of the pancreas and gently place lateral tension on it. Puncture the ventral peritoneal surface with the needle at a shallow angle and then inject the cell suspension into the pancreas in a slow and controlled fashion (over 10−15 s) with the injection device.\nDuring the injection process, carefully observe for leakage—both around the injection site (from reflux) and on the other side of the pancreatic lobule (in case of through-and-through penetration). If visible leakage occurs, stop the injection and note the volume of leakage by checking the volume of remaining injectate in the syringe. If the leakage is of small volume (<10 μL), and then absorb any leakage with gauze and reposition the needle into a different pancreatic lobule to complete the injection.\nReplace the spleen and pancreas and close the abdominal wall with 5/0 polyglycolic acid suture in a continuous fashion. Close the skin with clips.\nMonitor the mouse in a warmed cage until recovered from the anaesthetic. Once awake and alert, move the mouse back to its cage.\n2. Cancer resection surgery: Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy\nThe timing of resection in relation to implantation can vary depending on the experimental protocol. In general, allow the tumors to grow at least for 3 weeks prior to resection, but optimize this empirically for the particular implanted cancer cell line.\nOn the day prior to the resection surgery, perform bioluminescence imaging on the animals to confirm the presence of a localized primary tumor. Note that this imaging study is simply used to exclude mice with obvious extra-pancreatic disease from resection. Neither size nor radiant flux should be used as thresholds for determining eligibility for resection.\n\t\nWeigh mice and inject with D-luciferin intraperitoneally (150 mg/kg).",
    "Determine the timing of the imaging step in relation to luciferin injection for each experiment by the performance of a luciferin kinetic curve. The period of time where the radiant flux is above 90% of its maximum represents the optimal time for bioluminescence imaging (in this experiment, 18 to 26 minutes post-injection)\nInduce anaesthesia and maintain using isoflurane (4% and 3% with oxygen, respectively) and perform imaging using a bioluminescent imaging device (e.g., IVIS Lumina II). Use automatic exposure and binning settings (this can, however, be optimized for the expected radiant flux).\nPrepare the class II biosafety cabinet for procedure. Use a heating mat overlaid by a sterile plastic drape. For magnification during dissection, use a pair of 2.5x to 3.5x magnification surgical loupes.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 80 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine by intraperitoneal injection.\nAdminister 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin antibiotic prophylaxis, 2.5 mg/kg flunixin analgesia and 1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously.\nPlace the mouse on the sterile field in a supine position and apply povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol for skin preparation.\nMake a longitudinal incision in the skin of the left cranial quadrant of the abdomen, preferably through the previous incision site.\nBluntly dissect the skin off the underlying muscular abdominal wall, and then place an Alm self-retaining retractor to hold the skin wound open.\nIncise the muscular layer between forceps just to one side of the suture line of the previous operation, and then extend the incision to excise the entire previous suture line.\nExteriorize the spleen and distal pancreas and retract it cranially. At the caudal aspect of the pancreas, the colon may be found attached by filmy adhesions. If this is found, bluntly dissect the colon off.",
    "Carefully pass a pair of forceps dorsal to the body of the pancreas and splenic vessels and open this space. This frees up a segment of pancreas for subsequent ligation.\nLigate the body of the pancreas proximal to the tumor with a titanium ligation clip, and then transect the pancreas distal to this with cautery. An alternative way to control the pancreatic stump is to ligate it in continuity with 5/0 polyglycolic acid suture before transection.\nRetract the pancreas caudally and cauterize the gastrosplenic vessels between the cranial pole of the spleen and the stomach.\nRemove the specimen and confirm haemostasis.\nClose the abdominal wall with 5/0 polyglycolic acid suture in a continuous fashion. Close the skin with clips.\n3. Postoperative management\nIn the immediate post anaesthetic period (for both of the above procedures), monitor the mouse in a warmed cage until recovered from the anaesthetic. Once awake and alert, move the mouse back to its cage. In the postoperative period, monitor the animals for pain and signs of distress. Administer 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine by subcutaneous injection and closely observe the animals for 12 hours. \nSubsequently, monitor mice daily for weight, food intake and activity. Examine incision sites and palpate for tumor size. Remove skin clips on the seventh postoperative day.\nEuthanize the mouse if humane endpoints are reached. These humane endpoints include: loss of body weight >20%, features of untreatable distress (including hunched posture, lack of movement or grooming) and tumor size greater than 1 cm3 as estimated by external palpation.\nSubscription Required.
