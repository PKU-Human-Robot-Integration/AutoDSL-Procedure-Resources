Each step is performed behind the shield without accidently getting exposed to the beta rays of 32P ideally in a radioactive certified hood. Discard the pipette tips carefully into a radioactive waste container.\nLabelling DNA using 32P and purification of labelled DNA\nTiming: 1.5–2 h depending upon number of samples to be labelled\nIn this step the ‘TA’ oligos and markers (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) are labelled using ATP(γ-32P) and purified using G-50 columns to get rid of the unincorporated radioactive nucleotides.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1316_17.csv\nAdd the ingredients listed below and incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 45 min and 65°C for 20 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1316_18.csv\nPurify the labelled primers using G-50 columns (GE health care) according to manufacturer’s instruction (illustra MicroSpin G-50 Columns).\nVortex the sephadex G-50 column at low speed to resuspend the column. The tip below should be snipped off and the cap has to be opened to 1/4th turn. Do not open too much to avoid the lid coming off during centrifugation.\nPlace the column into a collection tube and centrifuge at 735×g for one minute.",
    "Note: Centrifugation speed and time must be followed strictly according to manufacturer’s recommendation to elute the right amount of DNA. Especially because low speed will lead to inefficient removal of buffer in the first step leading to dilution of purified DNA sample in the elution step. Sometimes, the column might retain the buffer after a single centrifugation. Here it may be necessary to modify the manufacturer’s protocol by an additional centrifugation step for a minute to efficiently remove buffer suspended in the column. Phenol:Chloroform extraction of DNA could be used to purify labelled DNA as an alternative to G-50 column purification.\nAfter packing resin column, add labelled DNA to the center without poking into the resin. Centrifuge at 735×g for 2 min to elute labelled DNA.\nNote: Check the radioactivity of the eluted DNA using a Geiger Muller counter at this step with maximal setting (100×). A stronger signal should be detected usually in the range of 100× or 10×. Failure of labelling or purification steps might lead to weaker signal of labelled samples.\nSet up a labelling reaction using the marker oligos as listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1316_19.csv\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 45 min and then inactivate the enzyme by incubating at 65°C for 20 min.\nPurify the labelled oligos using G-50 column as mentioned above.\nNote: Some of the base markers with a very small size difference might run closely together on the gel, hindering the exact determination of size. To circumvent this, it is recommended to label those markers separately and load them in a separate well next to the samples. Since G-50 columns cannot efficiently elute oligos less than 20 nucleotides, it is wise to start with comparatively higher amounts of lower size oligonucleotides (at least double the amount of higher size oligonucleotides).",
    "Exposing labelled oligos to varying doses of UV-C\nTiming: 3–4 h depending upon number of samples\nIn this step, the labelled and purified ‘TA’ oligo is exposed to increasing doses of UV-C.\nDilute the labelled product from step 5 with ultrapure water to 400 μL. Clean a coverslip with Kimwipe and using a marker pen, draw lines at the back of the cover slip to demarcate samples while spotting.\nFor each UV exposure, as well as the ‘no exposure’ sample, prepare a petri plate with a cut piece of wet paper towel (cold water). On the back of the clean coverslip draw vertical lines to demarcate 3–4 compartments for samples.\nDNA is spotted (as 4 spots of 10 μL) into the allotted spaces and the coverslip is placed into the petri plate.\nSet the Stratagene UV-C crosslinker in the timer mode. Place the petri plate with the samples inside the UV-C crosslinker. Samples are exposed to UV for different time points namely 2.5 min, 5 min, 7.5 min, 10 min, 12.5 min, 15 min and 30 min.\nNote: The wet paper towel minimizes water evaporation from the sample during exposure and helps to avoid sliding of coverslip to the bottom of petri plate.\nPool the 10 μL spots after UV exposure at each time point using a pipette and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube. Place tubes on ice until all time point samples have been collected.\nAdd 60 μL of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (neutral pH) to the samples and vortex for 30 s. Add 220 μL of water and briefly vortex. Centrifuge the samples at 16,873×g for 6 min.",
    "Carefully pipette 200 μL of the upper aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 3 μL of glycogen, 20 μL of 3M NaOAc pH 5.2 and 800 μL of 100% ice cold ethanol. Mix well and incubate at −20°C for at least 1 h.\nPause point: Incubation step could be extended to 16 h at −20°C.\nPellet the DNA by centrifuging at highest speed 16,873×g for 1 h. The pellet will be visible at the bottom of the tube as a small translucent spot.\nPipette out ethanol and add 70% ethanol into each tube. Leave the pellet untouched and centrifuge again for 20 min.\nCarefully pipette out ethanol without touching the pellet. Do a short spin to get all residual ethanol to the bottom. Carefully pipette out the ethanol left out around the pellet without disturbing the pellet. Let the pellet dry for 5–10 min in the hood.\nNote: It is ideal to cast the gel during the day of UVDE digestion.\nUVDE digestion and sample preparation\nTiming: 3–4 h depending upon number of samples\nIn this step, the DNA samples exposed to UV are digested with UVDE enzyme and prepared for the next electrophoresis step.\nAdd 1 μL of 10× UVDE buffer (pH 6.5), 8 μL of water and resuspend the pellet. Vortex to mix and centrifuge shortly to bring the reaction mixture to the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 1 μL of UVDE enzyme and incubate at 55°C for 1 h.\nUsing a pipette mix the enzyme with the reaction mixture before incubating.\nAfter incubation add 50 μL of TE buffer (pH 8) and add 60 μL of PCI. Add 250 μL of water and vortex well for 30 s.",
    "Centrifuge for 6 min at 16,873×g. Carefully pipette out 200 μL of the upper phase and transfer to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 3 μL of glycogen, 20 μL of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 800 μL of 100% ethanol and invert the tube few times to mix, then store at −20°C for at least 1 h.\nNote: pH neutralization of the sample after UVDE digestion is essential at this step. If not done, this might lead to uneven migration of sample during electrophoresis that is usually carried out under alkaline conditions.\nPause point: The incubation here can be extended to 16 h at −20°C.\nCentrifuge samples at 16,873×g for 1 h to pellet DNA. DNA will appear as a small translucent spot at the bottom of the tube.\nNote: Set up the gel apparatus and start pre-running the gel during pelleting and washing steps. Check section ‘pre-running, sample loading and gel electrophoresis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6]’ for complete details.\nWithout touching the pellet, carefully pipette out ethanol, add 1 mL of 70% ethanol to the tube and centrifuge at 16,873×g for 20 min. Carefully pipette out ethanol. Do a short spin to collect residual ethanol sticking on to the sides of the tube. Using a pipette carefully pipette out residual ethanol without touching the pellet.\nNote: Once DNA is pelleted using 100% ethanol, leave the pellet undisturbed in the subsequent steps during 70% ethanol wash or do not resuspend the pellet during ethanol wash step.\nAir dry the pellet for 5–10 min behind the beta shield in the hood. Add 6 μL of water, 6 μL of 100% formamide and vortex to dissolve the pellet. Briefly centrifuge the tubes to bring down sample to the bottom of the tube.",
    "Heat samples at 95°C for 10 min before loading on to the gel.\nPause point: DNA samples after UVDE digestion and ethanol precipitation can be stored at −20 before heating. It is recommended to heat the samples immediately before loading.\nCritical: Use lid locker or a heated lid equipment so that the heated radioactive sample does not pop out of the tube during this step.\nPrepping and assembly of glass plates\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThis is a preparation step for casting the denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel. A neat and clean assembly of glass plates facilitates smooth casting of the gel. (Sequi-Gen GT Nucleic Acid Electrophoresis Cell Instruction Manual)\nLay the outer long and inner short IPC glass plates flat on the table surface supported by two pipette tip boxes. Using a Kimwipe, wipe the surface of Sequi-Gen GT glass plates with water, then with ethanol. Let it dry.\nAdd 2–3 drops of Rain-X to one side of the outer (long) glass plate and spread it evenly throughout the glass plate using a clean Kimwipe. This will appear as a thin film of coating on the glass plate when it is wet. This coated side will be in contact with the gel.\nNote: Excess RainX should be cleaned from the plate. Otherwise, this leads to floating of gels while running the gel.",
    "Wipe the spacers (0.17 mm) with ethanol and place one on each side of the integral plate chamber (IPC) glass plate. Now place the long outer glass plate over the spacers. Lift the whole set up and place vertically onto a clean surface and insert the GT lever clamps on each side one after the other. The clamps must be tight enough to avoid any leakages. Place the whole set up into the precision caster base and loosen the precision caster cam pegs so that the precision cam pegs fit properly into the holes of the side clamp. Tighten the precision caster cam pegs and lay the whole set up flat on the bench with the upper part a few inches raised. One could use a 15 mL centrifuge tube for the raised support.\nPreparation and casting of denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel\nTiming: 1 h 45 min\nA denaturing 15% polyacrylamide urea gel is casted in this step.\nAdd the specified ingredients in a 200 mL beaker with stir bar to make the urea gel solution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1316_20.csv\nPlace the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and let it stir until urea dissolves completely.\nAfter urea dissolves completely, place the beaker on ice until you are ready to inject the solution into the gel apparatus. This step avoids quick/earlier solidification of gel before injection or during injection into the gel apparatus.\nCritical: Acrylamide is a neurotoxin and can be absorbed through skin. Unsolidified acrylamide should be used with caution during this step to avoid spills. Allot separate space for casting gel. Wear PPE to avoid acrylamide getting into eyes or skin.\nRight before casting the gel, add 750 μL of 10% APS and 20 μL of TEMED to the gel solution and mix slowly and gently, avoiding formation of bubbles.",
    "Suck up the solution gently using the Luer taper attached to a 60 mL syringe. It is critical to avoid bubbles at this step. If there are any bubbles formed, make sure to get rid of them (by gentle tapping and injecting the bubble out of the syringe and Luer taper) before injecting the solution into the gel apparatus.\nSlowly inject the gel solution. Once the glass plates are filled with the gel solution, insert the comb between the glass plates.\nWhile injecting and fixing the comb, be gentle to avoid any air bubbles at the interface between gel and comb. Otherwise, wells might get uneven at the bottom after solidification. Make sure to use combs and spacers of same thickness.\nLet the gel solidify for at least 1 h.\nThe gel can be left to solidify for up to 16 h. The edges can be covered with wet paper towel soaked in 1× TBE and then covered with saran wrap and stored flat at 4°C (up to a few days but not more than a week).\nPre-running, sample loading and electrophoresis\nTiming: 3 h and 15 min\nUVDE digested samples are loaded and electrophoresis at high voltage current is carried out at this step.\nSet up the gel assembly behind a beta shield. Do not take out the gel plates from behind the shield once the radioactive sample is loaded on to the gel.\nThe gel assembly is placed inside the GT base buffer tank and the glass plates are supported with GT bottom safety cover that has screws to be tightened to secure the vertical glass plates to GT base.\nNote: Refer to Sequi-Gen® GT Nucleic Acid Electrophoresis Cell instruction manual for complete details (Sequi-Gen GT Nucleic Acid Electrophoresis Cell Instruction Manual)",
    "Pour 1× TBE buffer into the buffer chamber at the bottom and the inner buffer chamber attached to the lPC shorter glass plate.\nFlush the wells with buffer using a gel loading pipette.\nCover the inner buffer chamber with GT top safety cover so that the electrodes on the GT lever clamps are connected to the electrodes on the GT top safety cover.\nCritical: Use caution while handling high voltage powerpack. Leakage of buffer is possible during the run. Make sure the GT lever clamps are fit snuggly to avoid buffer leakage. Monitor gel electrophoresis few times during the run to check for buffer leakage.\nConnect the system to a high voltage powerpack. Pre-run the gel at 60 watts for 30–40 min or until the thermosensor tape on the glass plates shows the temperature between 40°C–50°C. Turn off the powerpack, take off the lid, and flush the wells gently once again to get rid of urea.\nCritical: Every step after this is carried out safely behind a beta shield. Be cautious and gentle while handling radioactive samples and gels. Avoid cluttering of the bench space where radioactivity is handled.\nAdd 12 μL of the heated samples to the wells. Leave one well empty between marker and samples. 10 μL of diluted marker oligos can be added to the wells. Heating of marker oligos is not necessary.",
    "It is recommended to check the radioactivity of samples and marker oligos using Geiger Muller counter. Total radioactivity of markers should be 3 to 5 times less than the total radioactivity of samples. Dilute the marker oligos using water to adjust for ideal radioactivity signal. This helps reduce the signal intensity of markers taking over the signal intensity of samples while imaging. We do not add loading dye to samples and marker oligos but adding loading dye to empty wells helps track the gel running. Without loading dye it is hard to determine how far the gel has run.\nElectrophoresis is carried out at 60 watts for 2 h and 10 min. At this time point the dye should have separated into upper and lower band. The lower band should reach approximately 10–15 cm from the bottom of the glass plates.\nTurn off the high voltage current and remove the GT top safety cover lid disconnecting the electrodes. Carefully pour the buffer into a wide mouthed radioactive waste beaker.\nUsing a separator, try to gently separate the glass plates such that the gel sticks to the bottom plate. Gently flip the glass plates if the gel is sticking on to the upper plate.\nCover the gel with saran wrap.\nExposure to phosphor screen and imaging\nTiming: at least 2 h and 30 min (might take longer exposure h depending upon the signal intensity of the sample)\nThe urea polyacrylamide gel is exposed to a phosphor screen and the signal is captured using a typhoon scanner. The image is quantified using Imagequant software.\nPlace phosphor screen on top of the gel covered by saran wrap so that the white portion (phosphor side) is facing the gel and leave the phosphor screen undisturbed for 2 h.",
    "Critical: Carefully discard the radioactive gel into appropriate discards. Save the gel until image is scanned.\nTake magnetic phosphor stage near the phosphor screen. Once the phosphor screen sticks to stage adjust phosphor screen to center of the platform within the enclosed raised frame.\nIf the screen is not properly aligned within the enclosed frame, there are chances of the screen getting stuck or slipped during scanning process in typhoon scanner\nPlace the magnetic platform onto Typhoon scanner such that the pegs on the typhoon scanner fit into holes of the magnetic platform.\nAppropriate alignment is essential at this step otherwise the platform will get stuck during the scanning process.\nScan image using typhoon scanner phosphorimaging software. Save the image and analyze using ImageQuant software. Lanes were manually created and spots corresponding to ‘TA’ lesions were quantified and exported to excel. The values obtained were used to make the graph shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1316-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

A UV-C dose between 500 and 600 J/m2 will induce approximately one 6,4-PP per 1 kb yeast DNA.\nGrow yeast cells in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium for 16 h and subculture the yeast cells in 40 mL (20 mL per timepoint) YPD. Incubate the cells at 30°C to an OD600 of about 0.8 (between 0.4–1.0).\nSubculture growth will take around 6 h, depending on the strains being used.\nPellet cells at 3200×g for 5 min, remove media, and resuspend in 40 mL ddH2O.",
    "Exposing cells suspended in colored media such as YPD to UV-C will result in reflection of UV off the media, and thus a lower UV dose than intended.\nAliquot 20 mL of cells for “No UV” samples, centrifuge, remove the medium, and store the cell pellet at −80°C.\nIn a dark room, pour remaining 20 mL of cells into a 5” × 7” plastic developing tray (or other container that will allow for ample spread of cells). Expose cells to 500–600 J/m2 UV-C (based on manufacturer’s calculations) with the container lid off.\nImmediately transfer irradiated cells to a conical tube, pellet cells as described above, and remove supernatant.\nIt is recommended that gDNA be isolated immediately. However, cells may be stored at −80°C until gDNA isolation if necessary.\nFor UV-exposed naked DNA control libraries, grow cells as described above, but do not expose to UV-C light.\nFollowing gDNA isolation (described in next section), resuspend pellet in 100 μL ddH2O.\nSpot DNA onto microscope cover slip in 10 μL aliquots.\nExpect to recover about 80% of starting volume.\nIf sample is spotted onto a microscope slide it will spread out and will not be able to be recovered.\nPlace cover slip onto a dish filled with ice.
