    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n2D induction of hiPSC colonies for EMLOC formation (stage 1)\nTiming: 2 days (for steps 1 to 6)\nThe short induction time at this step yields mesendodermal-like cellular starting material that importantly is also primed for neural differentiation. Protocols for trunk-biased, uniformly committed neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) typically rely on more sustained exposure to FGF and CHIR signaling (e.g., 4–5 d induction period).4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] The induction factors for 2D adherent colonies and for subsequent aggregate formation and polarization were originally identified by the Gouti laboratory to generate neuromuscular trunk organoids using human stem cells.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] These factors were then optimized for elongating multi-lineage organized (EMLO) gastruloids by our laboratory.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] However, the original EMLO gastruloid protocol in that study was not optimized for cardiogenesis.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nNote: hiPSC colonies at ∼50%–60% confluency in single wells of a 6-well plate are ready for 2D induction (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nSupplement working volume (2 mL per well) of N2B27 with 3 μM CHIR 99021, 40 ng/mL FGF2 (referred to herein as Induction Medium) and prewarm to 25°C without a water bath.\nNote: FGF proteins influence caudalization to trunk phenotype in part through initiation of HOX gene expression.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] CHIR 99021 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling via GSK3 inhibition.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Together these factors promote generation of axial progenitors.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nNote: Medium supplementation during stages in EMLOC formation are summarized below:",
    "Critical: Cell-line dependent induction with CHIR 99021 and FGF2 must be optimized both for concentration and time of exposure. In our hands, the ideal CHIR 99021 concentration window for line H3.1.1 is between 3–3.5 μM for 2–3 d of induction. By visual inspection, optimal colony induction is characterized by slight raised-edge character just as cells begin to migrate away from the colony border (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Also important is consistency of cell numbers being induced so that factor concentrations are appropriate.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nRemove the mTeSR Plus medium and rinse cells 2× with DMEM/F-12.\nAdd 2 mL of Induction Medium to the hiPSC wells that will be used to generate EMLOCs.\nReturn plate to incubator.\nAfter 24 h, exchange the medium with 2 mL fresh Induction Medium.\nReturn to incubator for an additional 24 h.\nTransition to shaking culture and EMLOC polarization (stage 2)\nTiming: 2 days (for steps 7 to 14)\nApproximately 48 h after induction as adherent 2D colonies, cultures are primed to generate single cell suspensions to form 3D aggregates by orbital shaking. This transition helps to drive formation of uniformly and appropriately sized aggregates and introduces additional mechanical cues during the early polarization stage. Initial starting aggregates with small cell number (∼50–100 μm diameter aggregates; 50–100 cells each) are critical to establish the necessary axis length for local signaling and polarization.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] This size is achieved uniformly and spontaneously in our hands using line H3.1.1 and the culture conditions described.\nNote: 48 h after the initial induction as 2D colonies in Induction Medium, cells can be used to generate 3D aggregates.\nPrepare a fresh 6-well plate by treatment with 1 mL Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution per well for 10 min.",
    "Remove the Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution from the wells and rinse 2× with 1 mL HBSS (CM-free). On the second rinse, do not remove the HBSS to prevent drying.\nRemove the Induction Medium from the wells containing primed colonies and rinse 2× with 1 mL HBSS (CM-free).\nFor enzymatic dissociation to single cells, dilute Accutase 1:1 with HBSS (CM-free) and add 1 mL per well. Incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min (cell line-dependent incubation time).\nAfter incubation, gently remove dissociation solution and add 1 mL of N2B27 (no supplements) to the empty well.\nDislodge the cells using a side-to-side scraping motion over the entire surface area of the well with a serological pipette oriented orthogonally to the surface.\nTriturate the suspension manually with a P-1000 pipette ∼6× to generate a single cell suspension.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCombine 2–3 Accutase-treated hiPSC wells.\nAdd the entire volume to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min to pellet the single cells.\nAspirate the supernatant from the cell pellet and resuspend in EMLOC Polarization Medium (N2B27 basal medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL FGF2, 2 ng/mL IGF1, 2 ng/mL HGF, 50 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632) at the appropriate cell density.\nRemove remaining HBSS from treated wells and transfer cell suspension to the pretreated low adherence well plate.\nNote: ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 promotes single cell survival and potentiates primed cells towards neural crest.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] IGF1 and HGF, together with FGF2, have been shown to enhance mesodermal progenitor expansion during early differentiation.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]",
    "Critical: The combined suspensions used to generate aggregates for EMLOCs should have ∼2 × 106 cells total in 2 mL medium (1 × 106 cells/mL). Too many cells will interfere with correct ratio of factors. Too few cells will prevent any aggregate formation. Total cell number per well may range from 2 × 106 to 4 × 106 cells depending on cell line in 2 mL total volume.\nNote: See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker at 80 rpm clockwise in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nVisually inspect the orbital shaking cultures at 24 h post-aggregation.\nNote: At this stage, round aggregates of similar size distribution (∼50–100 μm) should be visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). To change the culture medium, pool the aggregates in a 15 mL conical tube and allow them to settle by gravity for ∼10 min.\nNote: Do not let cultures over-settle to avoid aggregate fusion.\nCritical: If there are aggregates present that are much larger than the rest, manually remove the larger aggregates with a P-1000 blue tip.\nAspirate one-half volume of the media and replace with fresh, modified EMLOC Polarization Medium (N2B27 supplemented with 20 ng/mL FGF2, 4 ng/mL IGF1, 4 ng/mL HGF without ROCK inhibitor Y-27632).\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: The concentration of the growth factors is doubled to maintain the same overall concentration in the wells (assuming the original recombinant proteins are still present).\nReturn the culture to the orbital shaker at 80 rpm clockwise in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nNote: The rotational speed is key to achieving the initial size of the starting aggregates and may require cell line-specific optimization.\nEMLOC cardiac induction (stage 3)\nTiming: 5 days (for steps 15 to 19)",
    "EMLOC cardiogenesis is stimulated with defined angiocrine and cardiogenic factors in combination (FGF2, VEGF 165, ascorbic acid) to recapitulate morphological hallmarks such as thin walled, dilated chamber-like structures with spontaneous contractility. These factors were previously shown to stimulate cardiogenesis in mouse gastruloids and are applied here, adapting our original EMLO protocol to induce human cardiogenesis with retained neurogenesis within the multi-lineage gastruloid framework.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\n48 h post-aggregation, initiate cardiac induction by pooling aggregates in a 15 mL conical tube and allow them to settle by gravity for 10 min.\nCompletely aspirate the EMLOC Polarization Medium and rinse with 10 mL HBSS (CM-free).\nLet the aggregates re-settle and aspirate the HBSS (CM-free).\nResuspend in Cardiac Induction Medium (N2B27 supplemented with 5 ng/mL VEGF, 30 ng/mL FGF2, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid).\nNote: VEGF regulates the development of the vascular endothelium and endocardium through the activation of Akt signaling in endothelial cells,15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] and ascorbic acid promotes cardiac differentiation by enhancing the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells via MEK-ERK1/2 signaling.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nReturn cells to the orbital shaker at 80 rpm clockwise in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nNote: See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nReplace Cardiac Induction Medium with fresh medium at 4–5 d post-aggregation.\nNote: It may be useful to replace procardiogenic media only once to allow intra-aggregate cell-cell and paracrine signaling.\nVisually monitor cultures for early polarization and cardiac crescent formation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and formation of contractile chamber-like structures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nNote: Calcium-mediated cardiomyocyte contractility can be verified by live-cell calcium imaging with Fluo-4 AM dye (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nEMLOC multi-lineage differentiation, chamber morphogenesis and innervation (stage 4)\nTiming: 18+ days (for steps 20 to 23)",
    "After 7 d post-aggregation, Cardiac Induction Medium is replaced with non-supplemented N2B27. This is intended to permit neurogenesis and cardiogenesis without further lineage restriction, favoring aggregate-derived signaling factors and self-organization.\nNote: The maximal duration for continued maintenance and development of EMLOC analysis has not yet been determined beyond 25 d from induction.\nAt 7 d post-aggregation, collect aggregates in a 15 mL tube and let settle at 37°C for 10 min.\nRemove and replace medium:\nRemove medium and rinse with HBSS (CM-free).\nLet re-settle and remove the HBSS (CM-free).\nExchange the medium to non-supplemented N2B27 and re-distribute EMLOCs evenly to new cultureware freshly treated with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution.\nPlace on orbital shaker at 75 rpm clockwise in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.\nReplenish N2B27 basal media every 3–5 d as needed to maintain the maturing EMLOCs for the remainder of the protocol."
