    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHepatic blood sampling\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step involves the blood sampling from the portal vein and then from a catheter inserted into the caudal vena cava at the level of the liver. Following sampling, the liver is then excised, and blood samples centrifuged to obtain plasma. Plasma samples can then be utilized to assess the net uptake and release of measured analytes to and from the liver.\nNote: Prior to starting the experimental protocol, a station for dissections and blood sampling should be set up with the necessary surgical and laboratory tools and reagents. In addition, a centrifuge should be set to cool to 4°C for the later spinning of blood samples obtained.\nLoad a 1 mL syringe with pentobarbital saline solution (50 mg/mL).\nScruff and inject the mouse intraperitoneally with pentobarbital solution (100 mg/kg).\nCritical: The correct use of anesthesia is particularly important to keep the heart continuously pumping during the blood sampling. Cervical dislocation for example, will prevent this. We have routinely used pentobarbital for this protocol, however, other anesthetics may be used. Note, however, that metabolic effects of anesthetics vary markedly.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nReturn the mouse to an empty clean cage. Anesthesia should take approximately 3–5 min.\nOnce under anesthesia, place the mouse supine on the dissection station.\nUsing forceps, pinch the paw to check for a reflex response. If there is no reflex response, proceed to next step. If a response is obtained, wait until there is no response.\nNote: Once the animal is anesthetized, you may work under normal light conditions if previously working under red light.\nTo open the mouse, make an incision with scissors at the base of the abdomen. Cut upwards to the ribcage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2311-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Hepatic blood sampling from the portal vein (A–F) and caudal vena cava (G–H)\nUsing a clean cotton swab, locate the caudal vena cava (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUsing curved forceps, underhook the caudal vena cava (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and tie a loose ligature around it above the renal veins (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The caudal vena cava is occluded after the blood sampling from the portal vein to prevent blood flow from the lower extremities when taking the blood sample from the proximal part of caudal vena cava draining the liver.\nLocate the portal vein and place a ligature around the portal vein without tying. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nThe ligature is then pulled to the right side of the mouse to further isolate the portal vein and create tension, making it easier to draw a blood sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nUsing a 1 mL syringe and 27-gauge needle, collect a 150–160 μL blood sample from the portal vein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRemove the needle from the syringe and decant the blood sample into a Microvette® blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nCritical: If there is bleeding upon removing the needle from the portal vein, it is recommended that gentle pressure is applied to the portal vein with sterile gauze in order to stop the bleeding before moving onto the next blood sample.\nNote: Prior to decanting, the needle is removed from the syringe to prevent hemolysis of the blood sample.\nNote: The Microvette® collection tube is narrow at the bottom and particularly suited to the collection of small blood samples.\nNow tie the ligature around the inferior part of the caval vein.\nUsing scissors, cut the ribcage to expose the heart and upper part of the caudal vena cava (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).",
    "Expose the upper caudal vena cava and loosely tie a ligature around it (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nBegin inserting the catheter into the proximal caudal vena cava from the right heart chamber.\nFollowing the perforation of the heart chamber by the needle, remove the needle from the catheter.\nFurther guide the catheter with the forceps down through the vena cava so the tip of the catherter is as close to the liver as possible.\nTie the ligature around the catheter once it is in place (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nBlood is sampled from the catheter by attaching a 1 mL syringe to draw 80–100 μL of blood from the catheter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nRemove the syringe from the catheter and decant the blood sample into a Microvette® blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nDissect the liver, rinse in phosphate buffered saline to remove excess blood and flash freeze the liver in liquid N2.\nNote: The liver may be flash frozen via the use of a freeze clamp. The use of the freeze clamp should be considered based upon what analyses will be performed downstream.\nSpin the obtained blood samples at 2,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRemove the plasma supernatant and decant into a 0.2 mL tube. Store at −80°C for further analysis.\nHindlimb blood sampling\nTiming: 15 min\nCritical: This is an arterio-venous blood sampling method related to that described above for the liver. If both techniques are to be performed, then these should take place in separate cohorts of mice due to the limited amount of blood that can be collected from a mouse.",
    "This step involves the sampling across the hindlimb via the sampling of venous blood from the right common iliac vein and arterial blood from the abdominal aorta. Following sampling, the gastrocnemius muscle is excised, and blood samples are subjected to centrifugation in order to obtain plasma. Plasma samples can then be used to assess the net uptake and release of measured analytes to and from the hindlimb muscles.\nLoad a 1 mL syringe with pentobarbital saline solution (50 mg/mL).\nScruff and inject the mouse intraperitoneally with pentobarbital solution (100 mg/kg).\nReturn the mouse to an empty clean cage. Anesthesia should take approximately 3–5 min.\nOnce under anesthesia, place the mouse supine on the dissection station.\nUsing forceps, pinch the paw to check for a reflex response. If there is no reflex response, proceed to next step. If a response is obtained, wait until there is no response.\nTo open the mouse, make an incision with scissors at the base of the abdomen. Cut upwards up to the ribcage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2311-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Hindlimb blood sampling from the right common iliac vein (A–E) and abdominal aorta (F–G)\nLocate the distal colon by moving the intestines and gonadal adipose tissue to the side.\nTie two ligatures around the colon (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCut the colon in-between the two ligatures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nLocate and expose the right common iliac vein by gently removing connective tissue from the area using forceps and cotton swabs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPut two ligatures around the right common iliac vein and leave the ligatures loose (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: One ligature for pulling back to create tension and one to quickly tie off to avoid blood loss after the blood sample has been taken (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Using clamped forceps, gently pull the proximal ligature to isolate the right common iliac vein and provide tension on the vein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nUsing a 1 mL syringe and 27-gauge needle, collect a 60–80 μL blood sample from the right common iliac vein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRemove the needle from the syringe and decant the blood sample into a Microvette® blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nTighten the ligatures around the right common iliac vein to avoid significant blood loss as soon as possible after blood sampling.\nLocate and isolate the abdominal aorta using forceps and cotton swabs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nLoosely tie a ligature around the abdominal aorta (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and another loose ligature around the aorta as distally as possible to provide tension.\nInsert catheter into the abdominal aorta (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G) and then tighten the ligature to prevent the catheter from falling out.\nSample 160–180 μL of blood via the catheter into a Microvette® blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nNote: The blood from the catheter should run freely into the tube without the need for attaching a syringe.\nDissect the gastrocnemius muscle, rinse in phosphate buffered saline and flash freeze for later analyses.\nNote: A more detailed approach to the proper dissection of the gastrocnemius can be found here.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nSpin the obtained blood samples at 2,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRemove the plasma supernatant and decant into a 0.2 mL tube.
