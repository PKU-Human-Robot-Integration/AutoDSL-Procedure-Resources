    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Production of ultra-soft polyacrylamide gels\nGiven the toxic and hazardous nature of several of the chemicals mentioned in Part 1, we highly recommend that the following steps are performed under a chemical fume hood.\nPreparation of amino-silanized glass-bottom fluorodish(es)\nTiming: 1 h\nThere are two reasons behind specifically choosing these fluorodishes for PAG casting. First, they have an optical quality glass bottom with a thickness of 0.17 mm, making the visualization of the gel on inverted microscopes with high magnification objectives quite easy. Second, they are individually packed and gamma sterilized, which decreases the number of steps and time needed for activating them.\nPlasma clean the sterile fluorodish for 2 min at high settings.\nNote: For our experiments we use residual air plasma. As mentioned above, the fluorodishes are already sterile. This step is an additional precaution to help increase the surface energy of the glass surface to better bond with the reagent added in the next step.\nNote: Given that we are using fluorodishes, which are glass-bottom plastic dishes, for casting the PAGs, we cannot use harsh chemicals for activating them. This is why we chose to use a plasma cleaner in this step. In the case of in-availability of a plasma cleaner, we suggest replacing the fluorodishes with glass coverslips and activating them with a piranha solution (sulfuric acid- hydrogen peroxide). We have successfully done this several times.\nImmediately add 1 mL of 5% APTES diluted in Milli Q water to the activated fluorodish surface. Allow the APTES to react for 5 min. After 5 min, remove the remaining liquid APTES from the fluorodish, flip it upside down on a clean paper towel and allow it to dry for 10 min.",
    "Critical: APTES is highly sensitive to moisture and should be stored by filling the pocket of gas in the bottle with inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, preferentially at 4°C. If it is stored at 4°C, it should be brought to ≈ 25°C before usage. The elevated temperature will enhance the covalent attachment and self-assembly of APTES to the glass during the salinization reaction. The diluted solution should always be prepared fresh. Do not keep any unused solution.\nRinse the fluorodish with running Milli Q water for 30 s to remove the remaining APTES from step 2.\nNote: It is essential to completely remove any trace of unreacted APTES for it will react with the glutaraldehyde used in step 3 and form an orange-brown precipitate. This precipitate fluoresces under UV light and may therefore interfere with fluorescence imaging of either the beads or the cells (if fluorescently labeled) during the experiment.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.5% glutaraldehyde in Milli Q water to the fluorodish and let it sit for 30 min.\nCritical: Using APTES alone to bind the polyacrylamide gel to the glass surface is not reproducible. Thus, following the APTES treatment with glutaraldehyde will help further activate the amino silanized surface and ensure the covalent attachment of the polyacrylamide gel to the glass surface.\nAspirate the remaining glutaraldehyde from the fluorodish and rinse it again with running Milli Q water.\nPause point: After this step the fluorodishes can either be (a) dried and used immediately for polyacrylamide gel casting, (b) stored in water at 4°C for up to a week or (c) dried and stored under desiccation for up to a month. We preferentially used options (a) and (b).\nPreparation of chloro-silanized coverslip(s);\nTiming: 2 h 30 min",
    "Sonicate (ELMA ULTRASONIC S 30 H) the 12 mm glass coverslips for 30 min in 2% Hellmanex (diluted in Milli Q water) twice and then for another 30 min in Milli Q water twice. Rinse the coverslips with running Milli Q water for 1 min in between each sonication. Then, dry them using compressed air.\nUse a plasma cleaner to clean the coverslips for 2 min on the high setting.\nNote: For our experiments we use residual air plasma. This step is needed to help increase the surface energy of the coverslips to better bond with the reagent added in the next step.\nAlternatives: If a plasma cleaner is not available, we suggest activating the coverslips with a piranha solution (sulfuric acid- hydrogen peroxide). We have successfully done this several times.\nImmediately cover the activated coverslip surface with undiluted Sigmacote (as provided by the manufacturer) and allow it to react for 5 min. After 5 min, remove the excess Sigmacote solution by capillarity with an absorbing paper (e.g., Kimwipe) and let the coverslips air-dry for 10 min protected from light and dust.\nCritical: Sigmacote is a chlorinated silane and thus, similar to APTES, has to be stored under an inert gas atmosphere at 4°C and has to be brought back to ≈ 25°C before usage.\nRinse the coverslips with running distilled water\nPause point: After this step, the coverslips can either be dried and used immediately, or stored under desiccation to be used later.\nPreparation of soft polyacrylamide gels\nTiming: 20 min",
    "There are numerous reports of acrylamide/bis-acrylamide formulations that can be used to produce PAGs with a wide range of stiffness. We have adapted ours from the commonly used and cited protocol published (Tse and Engler, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). The Young’s modulus of the PAGs was verified using Atomic Force Microscopy in mapping mode using a JPK Instruments Nanowizard I, equipped with a JPK Instruments Petri Dish heating system set at 37°C. To do so, we used Brucker Instruments MLCT cantilevers that we modified by gluing beads on their tip, by micromanipulation, the size of which is comparable to that of a lymphocyte (diameter ≈ 10 μm, (Sadoun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])). We made 48 × 48 μm2 laterally resolved maps of the modulus on several regions (at least 3) on the gels to ensure the lateral homogeneity of this crucial parameter. By performing these measurements regularly, we ensured that our PAG preparation protocol was stable and reproducible.\nPrepare the polyacrylamide gel premix by mixing acrylamide and bis-acrylamide to their desired concentrations in either Milli Q water or PBS in an eppendorf tube. To obtain ultra-soft polyacrylamide gels (≈ 400 Pa PAG), mix 75 μL Acrylamide (40%) with 30 μL Bis-acrylamide (2%) and 895 μL PBS. To generate gels with different stiffness, refer to Tse and Engler (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11].\nNote: It is important to note that using PBS instead of Milli Q water will slightly increase the elastic modulus of the gel. This can be quantified by AFM measurements.\nNote: It is preferable to mix the precursors, APS and TEMED, directly before polymerizing the gels since that will limit and control their exposure to oxygen, ensuring a better reproducibility of the final gel stiffness.\nAdd 0.7% total volume of 200 nm fluorescent beads (7 μL) to the premix.",
    "Note: The beads used in this protocol are carboxylate-modified with an orange fluorescence (excitation wavelength of 540/560 nm). Before use, the beads have to be cleaned using a Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Device 10 KDa to remove any chemicals present in the bead solution that might interfere with polymerization of the gel. Since the beads used here are of very small size (∼200 nm), dialysis is the safest method to ensure the thorough cleaning of the beads without creating any aggregates.\nAdd 1% total volume of Ammonium persulfate (APS, 10 μL) and 0.1% total volume of Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED, 1 μL) to gel solutions.\nCritical: APS has to be either freshly prepared or previously aliquoted and stored at −20°C otherwise the polymerization of the gel will be disrupted. Similarly, TEMED that has been stored for a long time or that hasn’t been stored properly will have the same effect.\nQuickly vortex the polymerizing solution for 20 s and pipette 5 μL of the polymerizing gel into the center of the fluorodish and sandwich it with the chloro-silanized coverslip, with the treated side facing the gel.\nNote: If the coverslip was treated properly, the polymerizing gel should wet it perfectly without any need for supplementary manipulation.",
    "Note: The volumes mentioned above should theoretically create a 40 μm thick gel, however the real height of the gel was observed to be ≈ 80 μm when measured using a motorized optical microscope stage system. This discrepancy is due to the fact that gels swell after polymerization, and so the height of the gel cannot be directly calculated from the volume of the cast polymerizing solution. Also, the degree of PAG swelling varies with each acrylamide/bis-acrylamide formulation and cannot be easily predicted, thus, it is important to measure or at least estimate the height of the resulting gel before using it for TFM. The gel must be sufficiently thick such that it can freely deform due to cellular forces without the influence of the underlying glass. As a consequence, the increased gel thickness might impose a limit on the type of microscopy and objectives (depending on their working distance) that can later be used for visualization.\nClose the fluorodish lid, flip it upside down to allow the beads to move towards the surface, surround it with wet tissue paper, place it in a closed-light protected chamber (e.g., large petri dish covered with aluminum foil), and then allow it to polymerize for 1 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Surrounding the fluorodish with wet tissue-papers will provide enough humidity to prevent the gel from drying out and cracking during the polymerization process. Shorter polymerization times may result in insufficient polymerization of all available monomers and may cause the mechanical properties of the hydrogels to vary from the values noted here and/or be heterogeneous over the gel surface. Monitoring the state of the unused solution in the eppendorf, for example by poking it with a needle can help estimate the degree of polymerization of the gel.",
    "Refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Gels do not polymerize.\nFill the fluorodish with PBS (or water) for 20 min before carefully peeling off the coverslip using the tip of a needle or tweezers.\nRinse the gel twice by submersion, each time for 5 min in PBS (or water) to remove any unpolymerized acrylamide.\nPause point: At this point, the gels can be stored in PBS (or water) at 4°C for up to a week before usage. Although the gel looks ‘polymerized’ after 1 h, there’s a deeper level of polymerization that takes place within the first 12 h of gel casting. Thus, it is preferable to use the gel only after this time interval has lapsed and the cross-linking has been completed.\nRefer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: Gels crack.\nGel functionalization\nTiming: 2 h\nBefore the cells can be deposited, the desired proteins that will drive the interactions between the cells and the gel need to be first immobilized onto the gel surface. PAGs are known to be nearly inert, and thus they do not readily adsorb proteins. One way to overcome this is to covalently link the proteins of interest to the PAG surface using a heterobifunctional protein cross-linker called sulfo-SANPAH. Sulfo-SANPAH contains an amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester on one side and a UV photoactivatable nitrophenyl azide on the other. Once a sulfo-SANPAH-coated gel is exposed to a UV light source with a wavelength between 320 and 365 nm, the nitrophenyl azide group will form a nitrene group that will bind to the polyacrylamide gel, and the sulfosuccinimidyl group will react with the primary amino groups of proteins to form stable amide bonds.\nRemove PBS or water from pre-silanized fluorodish.",
    "Add 250 μL of 0.5 mg/mL sulfo-SANPAH (prepared in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5) to the surface for the gel and expose it to 365 nm UV radiation for 2 min at 100% power in a UV-KUB 2 oven. Repeat this step twice with a PBS rinsing step in between.\nNote: Sulfo-SANPAH is highly unstable in aqueous solutions and is light sensitive. Thus, it either has to be previously aliquoted and stored at −80°C (where it can be kept for up to 6 months, shielded from light at all times) or stored as powder and prepared immediately before gel functionalization. After sulfo-SANPAH has been exposed to UV, it should change its color from orange red to brown. It is also important to take care when choosing the UV source: we observed that broad-spectrum UV lamps/ovens are likely to bleach the fluorescent beads used here.\nNote: When the hydrogels are later used for TFM, non-specific binding of cellular proteins and media proteins to unlinked sulfo-SANPAH sites are not likely to take place because the reaction happens only when the pH is around 8.5, and the pH of the cell medium is usually between 7 and 7.4.\nRinse the gel 3 times with PBS to ensure that all unbound sulfo-SANPAH has been removed.\nAdd an appropriate amount of the desired protein onto the surface of the activated gel, and incubate this solution for either 2 h at 25°C or for 12 h at 4°C.",
    "Note: For our experiments, we used a final concentration of 30 μg/mL of the antibody OKT3. A primary concern when using PAGs is the variability of ligand density and the homogeneity of ligand coating, especially given their inert and porous nature. Thus, to optimize the coating protocol to the end user’s specific proteins and conditions, a quantification step is necessary. One way to perform this quantification is by using a fluorescently labeled protein to both relate the measured signal to the amount of protein from reference standards and to inspect the relative lateral homogeneity of the coating (González et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Fluorescently labeled proteins can be added in this step instead of their unlabeled counterparts and can then be imaged after incubation using fluorescence microscopy. Nevertheless, it is preferable not to use a fluorescence label for the proteins, especially one with absorption/emission spectra too close to the one of the beads to avoid creating background noise via bleed-through which may compromise the fine detection of bead displacement.\nPart 2: Image acquisition\nTiming: 15–30 min/sample\nOnce the incubation period is over, rinse the gel gently with a 37°C preheated medium 3 times, leaving the gel immersed in medium after the last rinse (≈ 2 mL of medium), and then transfer the fluorodish to an inverted widefield fluorescence microscope. We used a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 40 × NA0.9 air objective, a CoolSnap HQ2 camera (Photometrics), a LED illumination system (Colibri 2, Zeiss) with suitable filter sets (Cazaux et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), and a petri dish heater module (JPK Instruments) that allows setting the temperature at the desired value, with a stability of a fraction of a degree.",
    "Pause point: Leave the gel to equilibrate at the desired temperature (in our case 37°C) for at least 20 min before starting image acquisition. This reduces the potential drifts due to thermal expansion of the substrate or the microscope stage. The mentioned time interval may need to be adapted to every setup used, in particular for thermal equilibration.\nNote: In all TFM experiments, at least two images of the substrate have to be acquired: One image of the bead field while the substrate is subjected to cellular forces (i.e. stressed state) and another image of the bead field in the absence of cellular forces (i.e. relaxed state). In our setup, the fluorodishes are firmly fixed onto the microscope with the petri dish heater module. This enables us to start the image acquisition before the addition of the cells, consequently giving us the relaxed state of the gel at the start of the experiment. This corresponds also to our goal of studying the early stages of immune cell mechanotransduction.\nStart image acquisition using appropriate software. In our case, we used Zen software (Zeiss) that controls the Colibri 2 diodes system and the camera.",
    "Note: Since we are interested in the dynamics of early immune cell spreading, our image acquisition only lasts between 15 and 30 min, and instead of taking only two images (relaxed and stressed), we acquire time-lapse TFM movies, at a typical interval of 1 frame every 5s, by capturing image doublets of the cells in phase-contrast (20 ms exposure time) and orange fluorescent microspheres (excitation ≈ 488 nm, 200 ms exposure time) over the course of the mentioned time frame. Since the layer of microspheres is only a couple of micrometers beneath the gel surface (due to the flipping of the gel during the polymerization step), the cells will still be easily visualized and tracked while the focus is set on the bead layer.\nRemove any excess medium (if there is any, depending on the desired final concentration of the cells), and gently pipette the cells onto the gel.\nNote: For our experiments, we typically add a final concentration of 0.75 million cells/2 mL in complete RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamax, 1% penicillin streptomycin and 2.5% HEPES. Remove 1 mL of medium, add the 0.75 million cells/0.5 mL onto the center of the gel and then add the remaining 1.5 mL of medium around the gel center. Note that the final concentration of cells used needs to be adjusted based on the cell type at hand and the forces they exert; it is crucial that the stress fields exerted by the cells are spatially separate. Also, the cells are always sub-cultured 12 h before the experiment so as to not perturb them the day of the experiment. Keeping culture conditions strict is an important point for ensuring the comparison between different days of experimentation and for subsequent statistical pooling of the data.",
    "Note: A common method to obtain the relaxed reference state of the beads is to carefully detach the cells at the end of the experiment, for example using Triton X-100, SDS, Trypsin, or accutase solutions, wait until substrate deformation is fully reversed, and then capture an image of the beads. In this case, the risk of accidentally moving the sample from its position is greatly augmented, which complicates data analysis, sometimes even rendering it impossible. However, in case of encountering significant drift during step 3, this method could be used instead."
