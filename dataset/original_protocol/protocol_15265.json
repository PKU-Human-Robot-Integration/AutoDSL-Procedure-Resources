    "1. Anesthesia and Monitoring\nAppropriate national and institutional ethics should be in place before performing animal experiments. Following approval from the ethics committee anesthetize male Sprague Dawley rats with a body weight from 120 - 180 g. Deliver 2 - 3 vol% isoflurane to a Plexiglas box via isoflurane vaporizer and place the rat inside.    \nAs soon as the appropriate level of anesthesia is achieved (lack of reaction to toe or tail pinch) the rat is weighted and shaved on the ventral cervical area. \nPlace the rat in dorsal recumbency on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37 °C and apply isoflurane at 2 vol% using a silicone mask. \nThe following preparation steps are best accomplished using a surgical microscope.\nFor the preparation of the trachea, the carotid artery and the jugular vein, perform a 2 cm horizontal skin incision in the area of the suprasternal notch and mobilize the salivary glands laterally. \nYou now face the ventral neck muscles. Carefully separate them in the midline and find the trachea. Expose 1 - 2 cm of the trachea and place a micro forceps under it so as to raise it up. \nNow slit about halfway through the ventral side of the trachea. Be careful not to cut all the way through, if you do, the cut end of the trachea will slip back into the chest and be very difficult to work with. \nInsert an Abbocath tube (14G) used as tracheal tube into the lower part of the trachea, which has previously been connected to an animal ventilator. Tip: Firm fixation on magnet clamps as well as suturing of the trachea around the tube is essential to keep the tracheal tube in place. Generally we use Terylene 5/0 suture, however similar suture material can be used.",
    "Respiration can then be volume controlled (frequency, 35 - 45 breaths/minute; tidal volume, 4.5 - 5 ml; FiO2, 0.35 - 0.50; Isoflurane 1.5 - 2 vol%).14 Atelectasis can be prevented by maintaining a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 to 10 mm of H2O.15 \nFor the carotid canulation, the right sternohyoid muscle is separated by blunt dissection to locate the carotid artery.\nSeparate the vagus nerve carefully from the carotid artery and mount the artery on an angled micro forceps to stop blood flowing from the heart. \nPass two pieces of equal length of suture beneath the carotid artery. In reference to the heart, the more distal suture is tied tightly to occlude blood flowing from the head region whereas the proximal suture is tied loosely around the carotid artery. \nUsing micro scissors a small cut is made into the carotid artery between the two ligatures.\nInsert a polyethylene catheter (0.28 mm inner diameter) filled with normal saline solution that is connected to a pressure transducer. \nRemove the micro forceps and thread the catheter further into the artery. Then tighten the proximal ligature around the artery and catheter. Tip: Application of a second proximal suture prevents bleeding after removing the micro forceps. \nTie the distal ligature around the carotid and the catheter for additional anchorage. \nMonitor anesthesia continuously by monitoring heart rate and arterial pressure. Perform intermittent arterial blood gas analyses using a blood gas analyzer.16 A heart rate lower than 300 bpm or exceeding 360 bpm as well as a mean arterial pressure dropping below 80 mmHg for longer than 5 minutes are criteria for exclusion.17, 18  Maintain blood pH within physiological limits (7.35 - 7.45). In case the experiment has to be terminated due to abnormal monitoring rates, scarify the animal by neck dislocation or exanguation.",
    "For the intravenous application of fluorescent dyes or other drugs of interest, perform the following:\nFocus the area of the left jugular vein with the surgical microscope. \nWith forceps in each hand, tear the thin fascia to reveal the jugular vein. Mount the vein on an angled micro forceps. Blood flow will then stop. \nUsing forceps, two pieces of equal length of suture are passed under the jugular vein concordant to the carotid canulation. Tie the distal suture tightly and the proximal suture loosely around the jugular vein.    \nMake a small cut into the jugular vein and insert a polyethylene catheter (0.28 mm inner diameter) that has been flushed with saline. Mark that incision and canulation can be more demanding and time consuming than that of the carotid. \nThread the catheter toward the heart and tighten the ligature closest to the heart around the vein and the catheter. \nAfter conforming patency, tie distal ligature around the catheter. Tip: Additional fixation of both catheters with tape may prevent dislodgment. \nRinse catheters frequently to prevent intraluminal clotting. \n2.  Preparation of the Cremaster Muscle\nWe use an aluminium stage of 1.5 - 2 cm thickness for cremasteric imaging. The stage rapidly adopts the desired temperature of the heating pad thus alleviating thermal control of the cremasteric tissue. This is crucial for inflammation studies. Alternatively a Plexiglas platform may be used though regulation of cremasteric temperature is more difficult. Place the scrotum in the centre of the stage.    \nThe initial incision is made in the skin and external spermatic fascia above the scrotum in the very distal end followed by cautious dilatation of the subdermal space using fine scissors. Avoid touching the underlying tissue with the instruments.",
    "As soon as the tissue is exposed it is moistened with pre-heated (37 °C) phosphate buffered saline solution with calcium and magnesium. Apply the solution regularly to any exposed tissue.\nConnective tissue between the external spermatic fascia and the cremaster muscle is carefully removed to free the cremaster muscle from surrounding tissue. \nThe exterior surface of the cremaster muscle is then cautiously cleared of connective tissue. Continuous superfusion during dissection hydrates the connective tissue, facilitating visibility and removal. \nSuture the distal end of the cremaster sack to hold down and slightly extend the end of the sack. \nIncise the distal end of the sack on the ventral aspect and elongate the incision proximally using micro scissors. Carefully cauterize bleeding vessels along the incision lines utilizing a thermal cautery. Avoid unnecessary cauterization to limit additional inflammatory stimuli. Tip: Blood flow dynamics near the periphery of the preparation are altered by this tissue damage.19 Therefore, to minimize these affects on data collection, blood vessels near the center of the preparation should be used for imaging. \nThe open cremaster lies flat on the aluminum pedestal though still connected by a thin ligament to the epididymis underneath the testicle. Reflecting the testicle to one side exposes this ligament including a small artery and vein which connect to the epididymis. Use the cautery to seal the vessels and employ the micro scissors to cut the connective ligament between testicle and cremasteric tissue.\nGently push back the isolated testicle into the inguinal canal. Other authors resect the testicle after proximal ligature (orchiectomy) along with the associated inguinal fad pad.20 In a sensitive model as IRI induced leukocyte activation we try to avoid all additional surgical stimuli, therefore we refrain from resecting the testis, which is usually not necessary to get sufficient exposure of the cremaster muscle.",
    "In addition to the first fixation suture four edges of tissue (two on each side) and attach the threads to tapes to cautiously spread the cremasteric tissue radially on the aluminum stage. Leaving a gap between the aluminum stage and the external entrance of the inguinal canal simplifies subsequent cremasteric clipping for ischemia. \nPlace two ends of polyethylene catheter (0.28 mm inner diameter) close to the cremasteric tissue for the superfusion setup. Make sure that the lumen is free of air to avoid air bubbles in the eventual fluid chamber. \nDraw a line of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) around the cremaster muscle using a syringe. The line must extend the size of the cover slip that is used for coverage. \nTo create a fluid chamber, place a square cover slip (32×32 mm) over the cremasteric tissue and firmly attach the edges to the Vaseline line. \nIn case the cremasteric tissue is not superfused with a specific drug, continuous replacement of the surrounding fluid is nonessential. A single application of phosphate buffered saline solution with calcium and magnesium into the created chamber may then be sufficient. Local stimulation with drugs however should be performed continuously via micro-perfusion pump at a rate of 3 ml per hour. \nThe cremasteric tissue is now ready for microscopic imaging. \n3. Intravital Setup\nThe basic intravital setup may vary. For epifluorescence imaging the experiments should be executed in a dark room.\nThe animal is transferred to the stage of an intravital epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 470 nm LED luminous source for epi-illumination. Use a water immersion objective (20×/1.0) to achieve magnification of approximately 800×. Record observations by means of a high resolution digital camera and store records on a personal computer for offline evaluation.",
    "For leukocyte labeling, inject rhodamine 6G intravenously via the jugular catheter at concentrations of 0.4 mg/kg body weight.\nChoose a postcapillary venule for observation. Vessel size should range between 20-60 μm and blood flow should be sufficient. To minimize the influence of pre-activation of the tissue, only vessels in which leukocyte rolling is <20 cells/30 seconds and the number of adherent cells <10 cells/200μm of venular endothelium may be utilized for further analysis.    \nIf possible, up to three postcapillary venules can be used for observation; however they should be located in a corresponding section of the cremasteric tissue to avoid confusing the vessels at different time points. \n4. Ischemia-reperfusion Injury (IIR)\nLet tissue stabilize for 30 minutes.    \nPerform a recording of 30 seconds to establish basal values for leukocyte rolling and adherence. Ideally, generate in total three basal recordings to verify cell numbers and to obtain standard deviations. \nGently place a Biemer vessel clip around the very proximal end of the exposed cremasteric tissue by using the application forceps. Stasis should occur immediately and can be visualized by epifluorescence microscopy in the observed vessel section. \nA variety of time courses can be utilized depending on the level of damage required. We apply 30 minutes of ischemia time as described by other authors.21-23 Remove the vessel clamp afterwards. Allow blood stream to stabilize for another 15 minutes. \nSubsequent recordings of 30 seconds duration can be made throughout the reperfusion period (e.g. 30 seconds every 15 minutes). Save recordings digitally for offline analysis.",
    "For the termination of the experiment, the rat is euthanized by cervical dislocation under sufficient anesthesia by pressing a blunt instrument such as the dull edge of a scissor blade at the base of the skull. With the other hand, the base of the tail is quickly pulled, causing separation of the cervical vertebrae from the skull. \n5. Offline Video Playback Analysis\nFor offline video playback analysis it is helpful to use software that allows selection of distinct pictures and observation of the video sequence in slow motion. Adjust contrast and brightness appropriately. We use software provided by the manufacturer of the microscope that allows length measurements and digital magnification.    \nFor the quantification of leukocyte rolling, define a virtual line that intersects the vessel vertically that is consistent in all records. Count the number of rolling leukocytes that pass the line within 30 seconds manually. \nFor the quantification of adherent leukocytes, define a 200 μm vessel section that is consistent in all records.23 Count the number of clearly visible leukocytes that remain static during 30 seconds - thus defined as adherent.24 \n6. Representative Results\nIRI of the cremaster muscle has no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and blood pH\nUsing the aforementioned setup (Figure 1), we investigated the microcirculation in IRI over a two hours protocol; however a much longer observation time up to 6 hours is possible. As shown in Figure 2, IRI of the cremaster muscle has no significant macrohemodynamic effects on the rat circulation as mean arterial pressure and heart rate remain stable throughout the investigation period. Furthermore we monitored homeostasis by frequent measurements of the arterial blood-pH that ranged within physiological limits and showed no significant inter-group differences. \nIRI induces leukocyte rolling in the cremasteric circulation",
    "Leukocyte endothelial interaction is a key event in the acute inflammation. By means of intravital microscopy we found a time-dependent increase in the number of rolling leukocytes in IRI of the cremaster muscle (Figure 3A) concordant to previous data 21, 25. Rolling mounted over the two hours observation time to a maximum of 137.63 ± 22.55 % of the baseline value after 120 minutes of reperfusion time and then reached statistical significance compared to sham operated animals (137.63 ± 22.55 vs 99.43 ± 14.04 % of baseline value).\nIRI induces leukocyte adhesion in the cremasteric circulation\nFor further evaluation of leukocyte-endothelial interaction we analyzed leukocyte adhesion in a 200 μm vessel section. IRI induced an increase in the number of adherent leukocytes that significantly exceeded values of sham operated animals after 60 minutes (118.33 ± 6.83 vs. 96.27 ± 5.78 % of baseline value) and further ascended by 120 minutes of reperfusion (Figure 3B).\nIn summary the described in vivo model supplies consistent data of acute leukocyte activation in IRI whilst animal survival and circulation stability is warranted.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3973/3973fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Figure 2. IRI of the cremaster muscle has no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and blood pH. Mean arterial pressure (A) and heart rate (B) were monitored every 30 minutes throughout the experiment via pressure transducer after canulation of the right carotid artery. Measurement of the arterial blood-pH (C) was performed after 0, 60, and 120 minutes. Values are mean ±SEM of 6 different rats and ranged on physiological levels without significant inter-group differences.

IRI increases leukocyte-endothelial interaction in the cremasteric circulation. After labeling of leukocytes with rhodamine 6G (0.4 mg/kg body weight) intravital epifluorescence microscopy was used to determine leukocyte-endothelial interaction in reperfusion injury over a 120 minutes protocol after 30 minutes of tissue ischemia. Records were taken at magnification of approximately ×800. A. IRI significantly increases the number of rolling leukocytes in postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle by 120 minutes of reperfusion whereas leukocyte rolling remains stable throughout the experiment in cremasteric tissue that did not undergo ischemia. Values are mean ± SEM of 6 observed rats. # p<0.05 using the unpaired t test. B. The number of adherent leukocytes is significantly increased in a randomly chosen 200μm postcapillary vessel section after 30 minutes of cremasteric ischemia and subsequent 60 minutes of tissue reperfusion. Results get even more pronounced after a two hours reperfusion period. Values are mean ± SEM of 6 observed rats. # p<0.05 using the unpaired t test. C.
