    "Selection of target sequence and primer design Select a sequence of size between 200 and 400 bp from the fall armyworm gene of interest, which should be a multiple of three base pairs, avoiding stop codons (in the antisense direction), and avoiding restriction sites of selected restriction enzymes. Check for off targets in the selected sequence against the fall armyworm and maize genomes using blastn at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]). Select a sequence with no off targets.Design PCR primers to specifically amplify the selected sequence and clone the sequence into the pSCMV-CS3 vector (Figure 1 and Supplementary information) in the antisense direction using the SbfI and PspOMI restriction enzymes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4760/bioprotoc-13-14-4760-g001.jpgFigure 1. Plasmid map of pSCMV-CS3, showing the restriction sites used for cloning gene fragments into sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) Following the same parameters, clone a 240 bp fragment of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (Gfp) gene into the pSCMV-CS3 vector to use as negative control for VIGS experiments.Synthesis of SCMV-VIGS constructs Hatch fall armyworm eggs on fall armyworm diet at 28 °C in an incubator. Use 7-day-old fall armyworm caterpillars for RNA isolation. Freeze caterpillars using liquid nitrogen. Grind the frozen larval tissue in a microfuge tube using a pellet pestle and isolate the total RNA using Wizard® SV Total RNA isolation system following the manufacturer’s instructions (Note 1).Quantify the RNA and use 1 μg for reverse transcription using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kits following the manufacturer’s instructions.Using the cDNA as a template, amplify the fragment of target gene using 400 nM of each target-specific primer with GoTaq® Green Master Mix.Analyze the specific amplification by 1.5% agarose electrophoresis using 1× TAE buffer, checking the correct size of the fragments by running a 100 bp DNA ladder in a parallel lane on the gel.",
