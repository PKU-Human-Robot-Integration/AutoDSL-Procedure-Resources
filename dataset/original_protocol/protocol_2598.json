HEFs or MEFs may take up to a week to reach confluence, and the medium may be changed daily to increase the growth rate of the HEFs or MEFs. Routinely passage the hESCs every 6 or 7 d.\nNote: Differentiation will occur in some hESC colonies. Pasteur pipettes can be used to routinely aspirate the differentiated colonies.\nUse a minimal volume of warm 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to passage hESCs on 6 cm2 dishes coated with a feeder-free system until the confluence reaches 50%–70%.\nInducing hESCs to differentiate into hepatic endoderm.\nReplace the medium with hESCs feeder free culture medium (Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks) for 3–5 d, changing the medium every other day.\nAspirate the medium and add endoderm induction medium 1 (Store at 4°C for up to 1 week) for 2 d.\nChange the medium to endoderm induction medium 2 (Store at 4°C for up to 1 week) for 4–7 d.\nInducing hepatic endoderm into liver progenitor cells.",

Matrigel will solidify at room temperature (∼20°C–25°C).\nNote: Use a prechilled 1 mL insulin syringe.

The tumor size will slowly increase with sorafenib treatment and then may start to grow quickly after some time. The tumor growth inhibition ratio (TGI) is calculated via the following formula: TGI(%) = [1-(RTV of the sorafenib group)/(RTV of the control group)] × 100%. TGI (%) drops by over 5% for 3 consecutive days after drug treatment are regarded as residual tumors, which may harbor potential drug refractory populations (e.g., for the PLC-8024 (2 × 106 cells/mouse)-generated CDX model, it takes approximately 3 weeks to develop residual tumors when treated with 60 mg/kg sorafenib) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2257-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
