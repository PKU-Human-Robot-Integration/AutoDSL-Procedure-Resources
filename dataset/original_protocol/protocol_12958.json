    "All tissues are obtained following approval of the Institutional Review Board committee and when all participants consented to both molecular analyses and follow-up studies. The protocols are approved by the Human Studies Committee at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n1. Methyl-binding DNA Capture (MBDCap)\nSample collection and DNA isolation\nCollect bulk tumor or normal tissue samples from patient paraffin embedded tissue samples.\nUse a commercial DNA mini kit to isolate genomic DNA from the paraffin embedded tissue samples according to manufacturer's protocol.\nUse a methylated DNA enrichment kit with the procedure described here according to manufacturer's protocol.\nInitial bead wash\n\tNote: The beads are used to couple with MBD-Biotin protein, which detects DNA methylation on the genome. Beads are usually suspended in a stock solution. Use these steps to wash off this liquid.\n\t\nResuspend the stock of streptavidin beads (See Materials Table) by gently pipetting up and down to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Do not mix the beads by vortexing.\nFor one µg of input DNA, add10 µL of beads to a tube with 90 µL of 1x Bind/Wash Buffer. Rotate for 1 min. Do not mix by vortexing.\nPlace the tube(s) on a magnetic rack for 1 min.\nRemove the liquid with a pipette and discard the liquid.\nAdd 250 µL of 1x Bind/Wash Buffer to the beads and rotate for 1 min.\nRepeat steps 1.2.3 - 1.2.5 twice.\nCoupling the MBD-Biotin protein to the beads\nFor 1.2 µg of input DNA, add 7 µL (3.5 µg) of MBD-Biotin protein to each tube.\nAdd 93 µL of 1x Bind/Wash Buffer to the protein to make a final volume of 100 µL.\nMix the beads-protein mixture on a rotating mixer at RT for 1 h.\nFragmented DNA (input)",
    "Sonicate DNA by adding 1.2 µg of total genomic DNA in 96 µL of TE buffer and 24 µL of 5x Bind/wash buffer to make a 120 µL solution. Use 30 s power ON and 30 s power OFF during sonication, 20 - 25 times.\nRun 1 µL of sonicated DNA solution using a bioanalyzer system with a commercial high sensitivity DNA kit to check the size of the fragments to be in the range of 150 - 350 bp according to manufacturer's protocol.\nWash the MBD-beads\nPlace the tube containing MBD-beads on a magnetic rack for 1 min.\nRemove and discard the liquid with a pipette without touching the beads.\nResuspend the beads with 250 µL of 1x Bind/Wash Buffer.\nMix the beads on a rotating mixer at RT for 5 min.\nRepeat steps 1.5.1 - 1.5.4 twice.\nFragmented DNA capture reaction (1 µg input DNA)\nTransfer the DNA/Buffer mixture to the tube containing the MBD-beads.\nMix the MBD-beads with the DNA on a rotating mixer for 1 h at RT. Alternatively, mix O/N at 4 oC.\nRemoving non-captured DNA from the Beads\nAfter mixing the DNA and MBD-beads, place the tube on the magnetic rack for 1 min to concentrate all of the beads on the inner wall of the tube.\nRemove the supernatant liquid with a pipette and save it in a clean DNase-free microcentrifuge tube as nonmethylated DNA. Store this sample on ice.\nAdd 200 µL of 1x Bind/Wash Buffer to the beads to wash the beads.\nMix the beads on a rotating mixer for 3 min.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic rack for 1 min.\nRemove the liquid with a pipette and save it in a microcentrifuge tube.",
    "For capture reactions of ≤1 µg of input DNA, repeat steps 1.7.3 - 1.7.6 for 2 more wash fractions in total.\nSingle fraction elution\nMix low-salt buffer with high-salt buffer (1:1) to get elution buffer (1,000 mM NaCl).\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL of elution buffer (1,000 mM NaCl).\nIncubate the beads on a rotating mixer for 3 min.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic rack for 1 min.\nWith the tube in place on the magnetic rack, remove the liquid with a pipette without touching the beads with the pipette tip, and save it in a clean DNase-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Store this sample on ice.\nRepeat steps 1.8.1 - 1.8.4 once, collecting the second sample in the same tube (total volume will be 400 µL). Store the pooled sample on ice.\nEthanol precipitation (DNA cleanup)\nTo each noncaptured, wash, and elution fraction from the previous steps, add 1 µL glycogen (20 µg/µL, included in kit), 1/10 sample volume of 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (e.g., 40 µL per 400 µL of sample) and 2 sample volumes of 100% ethanol (e.g., 800 µL per 400 µL of sample). The total volume is 1,241 µL.\nMix well and incubate at -80 oC for at least 2 h.\nCentrifuge the tube for 15 min at 11,363 x g at 4 oC.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 500 µL of cold 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 11,363 x g at 4 oC.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat steps 1.9.6 - 1.9.7 once and remove any remaining residual supernatant.\nAir-dry the pellet for ~5 min. Do not completely dry the pellet.\nResuspend the DNA pellet in 37.5 µL of DNase-free water or other appropriate volume of buffer.",
    "Place the DNA on ice or store the DNA at -20 oC or below until further use.\nCheck that the total amount of DNA is over 20 ng, (e.g., use fluorometric quantitation system, see Materials Table).\n2. Sequencing\nUse the DNA fragments recovered from MBDCap procedure for sequencing. For each sample to be sequenced, a total amount of 20 - 40 ng DNA is required for library preparation.\nFor DNA-seq library preparation use a fully automated library construction system (See Materials Table) and follow the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Select DNA fragments of size 200 - 400 bp for library preparation. The automation library preparation system allows standardizing the library preparation procedure and minimizing the variation across the samples due to manual preparation.\nUse adaptor primers and dilute to 100x concentration. Of this, use 10 µL for each sample.\nFollowing step 2.2, take out the reaction, and quantify the DNA-seq library using a fluorometric quantitation system (See Materials Table).\n\t\nSet up PCR amplification procedure. The choice of PCR master mix is to improve the PCR efficiency of GC enriched region of genome. In a PCR tube, add 15 µL DNA-seq library, 25 µL PCR master mix (See Materials Table), 2 µL PCR primer mix (See Materials Table), and 8 µL H2O. \nFollow PCR recommendation from manufacturer of the PCR master mix, altering cycling times and temperatures for differing starting materials: 98 oC for 45 s, X cycles of 98 oC for 15 s, 65 oC for 30 s, 72 oC for 30 s, and then 72 oC for 1 min. Hold at 4 oC.\n\t\nPerform enough cycles to end up with 2 - 10 nM of library DNA (8 - 10 cycles).",
    "Clean up PCR reaction with 1:1 ratio of PCR purification beads according to manufacturer's protocol (See Materials Table).\nElute with 20 - 30 µL elution buffer.\nBarcode each sample and pool 4 samples together into one lane of a flow cell. Use the standard 50 bp single read protocol for sequencing (See Materials Table).\n3. Bioinformatics Analysis\nNote: Further process the raw fastq files obtained from the sequencing to perform quality control and mapping the short DNA sequences (reads) to the genome.\nUse Bowtie short read aligner, genome mapping tool on each sample fastq file to map the reads to the reference genome. Many read mapping tools are available to perform this step and can be used based on individual preference.\n\t\nAllow up to 2 mismatches in the whole reads while mapping to the reference genome. Report up to 20 best alignments for each read. For example, use bowtie -v 2 --best -k 20 --chunkmbs 200 <ebwt><fastqFile><alignFile>.\nUse LONUT9 to recover the multiply mapped reads to improve the detection of the enriched regions. For each read, at most one alignment would be recovered when it is close enough to any of the above called peaks. For example, use: perl lonut.pl -g hg19 -w 250 -p 99 <alignFile><outputPath>. LONUT will perform the following steps.\n\t\nSplit alignments into uniquely mapped reads and multiply mapped reads. Call peak on the uniquely mapped reads using peak caller BELT11. The option -w 250 and -p 99 in the example command are for BELT.\nCombine uniquely mapped reads with the recovered reads obtained from LONUT, and the combined reads, in BED format, will be used in further analysis. Calculate the number of combined reads for future normalization.",
    "Bin the reads. Extract reads in region of interest using perl script: perl methyPipeline.pl <sampleInfoFile><refGeneFile> -up <upstream extending length> -dn<downstream extending length>. For each bed file listed in the sampleInfoFile, the perl script performs the below tasks.\n\tNote: See supplementary coding file for the perl script.\n\t\nBin the reads into fixed bin size, e.g., 100 bp, for 24 chromosomes.\nFor each gene specified in refGeneFile, extract the bins around transcription start site (TSS), up to the extending length specified by option -up and -dn. For example, extract the data in the region that is up and downstream 4 kb of TSS. At bin size 100 bp, this extracted data have 81 bins, and the center bin corresponds to the TSS.\nFor the gene on the antisense strand, flip the extracted region from left to right so that upstream bins are always placed on the left with the perl script.\nFurther split the TSS ±4 kb region into three sub regions: Left, upstream 4 kb to upstream 2 kb; Middle, up and downstream 2 kb; Right, downstream 2 kb to 4 kb.\nFor each sample, divide the count of reads in each bin by the total number of combined mapped reads calculated in 3.3.3. The normalization will eliminate the sample specific read differences and allows to compare the reads across different samples.\nRun the bash script (as indicated in the script file) to perform statistical test on the normalized reads obtained from the left region, to detect differential methylation between normal and case group in the regions described as in the flank region.\n\tNote: See the supplementary coding file for the bash script. Based on the regions that are differentially methylated, there are seven combinations:\n\tWhole region: differential methylation throughout the TSS ±4 kb region",
    "MiddleLeft: differential methylation in both middle and left region\n\tMiddleRight: differential methylation in both middle and right region\n\tFlank: differential methylation in both left and right region\n\tLeft: differential methylation in left region only\n\tRight: differential methylation in right region only\n\tMiddle: differential methylation in middle region only\nUse the same bash script to visualize the differential methylation in a tornado plot. Plot the hyper and hypo methylated genes on a separate panel, and sort in the order of the region combination as described in 3.4, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
