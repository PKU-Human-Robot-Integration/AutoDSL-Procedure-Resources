    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay (hyperglycemic clamp)\nTiming: [∼ 2.5 h]\nFasting the experimental mice before hyperglycemic clamp for 10–12 h. This step includes preparation of buffers, mouse fixation and hyperglycemic clamp. The required concentration and volumes of reagents are described in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_914_12.csv\nNote: Dissolve D-glucose in deionized water, while dissolve heparin in saline solution, and sterilize these solutions by filtration.\nMouse fixation\nSterilize three-way Y connector with 75% ethanol solution, connect two of the joints to 0.3048 mm ID silicone tubing.\nStock one of the silicone tube with 10 mm long stainless plug, while flushing the other with D-glucose solution.\nWithdraw D-glucose solution into a 1 mL syringe, then joint the syringe and 0.3048 mm ID silicone tube with a flat needle.\nWeigh the pre-fasted mouse, then narcotize it in the anesthesia chamber.\nTransfer the experimental mouse to operating table and keep narcosis status with isoflurane through mask.\nRemove the plug in the back of mouse neck, and inject heparin up to 50 μL to ensure the tube is unobstructed.\nConnect the flat end protruding from mouse skin to the unoccupied joint of the three-way Y connector.\nTransfer mouse to the fixator and acclimate it for about 30 min.\nHyperglycemic clamp\nAdjust the infusion rate according to mouse weights, the initial rate of glucose solution is 30 mg/kg/min.\nMeasure the blood glucose level with a glucose meter through the tail vein and collect a fasting blood sample.\nTurn on the syringe pump and collect blood samples at 2, 5, and 10 min. Estimate the insulin levels and draw the insulin secretion curve when finished the experiment, then calculate the area under curve (AUC)and record them as first-phase insulin secretion.",
    "Adjust glucose infusion rate (GIR) to clamp blood glucose level at 306 mg/dL (± 18 mg/dL), according to blood glucose levels measured every 10 min. For convenience of operation, the blood glucose levels can be clamped at 17 mmol/L (± 1 mmol/L), since the glucose meter records the value in mM units. Record the blood glucose levels and GIR in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] when the experiment is in progress.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_914_13.csv\nCollect blood samples every 10 min. Estimate the insulin levels and draw the insulin secretion curve when finished the experiment, then calculate the area under curve (AUC) and record them as second-phase insulin secretion.\nThe glucose perfusion time can last up to 120 min, however it can be stopped when the blood glucose level is clamped and the perfusion rate reach a stable level (± 0.5 μL/min) within 30 min.\nStop the pump and dismantle the infusion device, then insert the stainless plug into the end of the silastic tube on the mouse.\nTransfer each mouse to their own cage for another 3 days to recover.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 675 g for 30 min, then collect serum carefully and store samples at –20°C for up to 4 weeks, or at –80°C for up to 2 months if it is not detected in time.\nMeasure insulin levels with an insulin ELISA kit. At least 3 μL serum for each replicate to measure is required, which can be diluted to 5 μL by saline solution.\nNote: The unit of GIR is recorded as μl/min during experiment, but it should be converted to mg·min–1/kg finally.\nCritical: Given the requirements for the measurement of insulin, at least 15 μl whole blood is necessary for serum isolation. The collected blood samples should be stored on ice before centrifuging.",
    "Pause point: Sample detection can be performed 1 day to several weeks after storing the samples at −20°C or –80°C.\nOptional: Red-blood-cell from same strain is necessary for blood transfusion, when the volume of blood sample collection is over 10% of total volume of experimental mouse (relationship between body weight and blood volume is about 2 ml/ 25 g), the procedure for red-blood-cell acquisition is as follows (k - n).\nCentrifuge whole blood sample from donor mouse at 4°C, 450 g, for 20 min, then discard plasma and platelets, measure the volume of red-blood-cell with pipette.\nWash the red-blood-cell with 10 U/mL heparin saline solution and centrifuge again at 4°C, 450 g, for 20 min. The volume of heparin saline solution for wash is according to the volume measured in (k).\nResuspend the cells with heparin saline solution, the volume is the same as in (k), and then store the red-blood-cell on ice before use.\nConnect the red-blood-cell in syringe and mouse with four-way X connector, and the rate of transfusion is 2 μL/min.\nNote: To avoid unwanted contamination, please use aseptic technique when performing these procedures.\nEx vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assay\nTiming: [2 d]\nThis step includes islet isolation and static and dynamic monitoring of islet GSIS function. Before the experiments begin, prepare the reagents below:\nMice were fasted for 10–12 h before islet isolation. The required concentration and volumes of reagents are described in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_914_14.csv\nIntrapancreatic perfusion of collagenase.\nNarcotize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 2% pentobarbital sodium solution according to body weight (40 mg/kg). Transfer the mouse to the operating table when anesthetized.\nDisinfect the abdominal skin with ethanol solution.\nCut off the skin and then muscular layer along the midabdominal line.",
    "Separate the major duodenal papilla from duodenum with fine tweezer and ligate the bile duct (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A- and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/914-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Wipe up the blood.\nAssemble the intravenous needle and a 5 mL syringe, then bend the needle to 45°for insertion.\nInsert the needle into the common bile duct until the pinhole is inserted at least 2 mm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nBegin to perfuse digestion buffer from the common bile duct proximal to the liver to the pancreas following the insertion (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nThe volume of perfusate is adjustable within the scope of 1–2 mL, until the whole pancreas is crystal clear. The perfusion should be finished within 1 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nStrip off the filled pancreas from the bottom, up along the direction of the intestines to the stomach to the spleen, as soon as possible.\nTransfer the pancreas to a sterilized 50 mL centrifuge tube in an ice-bath, and proceed to the next step till all the mice are sacrificed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: The 50 ml centrifuge tube can store 2–3 pancreata for the digestion procedure.",
    "Critical: Cut up the pancreatic tissue into pieces with a sterilized scissor carefully if you failed to fill the pancreas with digestion buffer, however this will reduce the number of isolated islets and cell viability.\nIslet isolation from pancreas\nAdd another 2–3 mL collagenase to the centrifuge tube to make the volume to the 5 mL scale line.\nTransfer the tube to 37°C shaking water bath for 18 min.\nRemove the tube and vortex at 700 g for 10 s. The digestion should be homogenous without large pieces of pancreatic tissue. If this is not the case, digest the tissue for another 2–5 min.\nAdd 10 mL HBSS with 10% CBS, vortex the tube to stop digestion.\nFilter the undigested tissue through 0.600 mm bore diameter sieves (30 mesh), and collect the filtered mixture in a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 385 g for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, then add another 10 mL HBSS and resuspend the sediment.\nCentrifuge at 385 g for 2 min.\nDiscard supernatant, then add 5 mL histopaque and resuspend the sediment.\nTransfer the mixture to a sterilized glass 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdding 5 mL HBSS slowly along the wall of the tube with a syringe.\nCentrifuge at 770 g for 20 min, with a uniform acceleration rate of 9 g and a uniform deceleration rate of 2 g.\nNote: The centrifuge needs to be pre-cooled to 4°C, and the uniform acceleration or deceleration rate was 9 g if not otherwise stated.\nIslet sorting and cell viability verification\nRemove the mid-layer of the supernatant with a pipettor to a 10 cm dish containing 8 mL stop solution. The color of isolated islets is tawny.",
    "Beginners may have difficulty in distinguishing islets from pancreatic tissues, especially if the islets are light in color. Add 8 μL DTZ solution into the dish, and stain islets at 37°C for 1 min. Since β cells in islets contain high amounts of zinc ions, that they can optionally be stained by DTZ solution.\nPick up the islets under the stereoscopic microscope, and transfer them to a10 cm dish containing 10 mL stop solution.\nPick up the islets again and transfer them to a 10 cm dish containing 10 mL culture medium and allow them to recover for 8–12 h.\nFor subsequent GSIS assays, the cell viability of the total islet preparation must be greater than 80%. FDA/PI staining can be used to identify viable cells as the following steps described.\nTransfer 30–50 individual islets randomly to a 3.5 cm dish containing 500 μL PBS, add 1 mL FDA/PI solution and stain the islets for 20 min at 20–25°Cin the dark.\nDiscard the supernatant, and wash the islets with PBS for 5 min.\nRepeat the wash three times, then transfer the stained islets to a 3.5 cm dish containing 1.5 mL PBS.\nObserve and photograph the islets under a fluorescence microscope, the excitation light for PI is 536 nm, but 494 nm for FDA. Cells that stained red by PI are apoptotic cells, while those stained green by FDA are viable.\nThe percentage of stained cells can be calculated using Image J software, area covered by red-stained cell should no more than 5% of total islet area.\nCritical: Culture the islets in tissue culture dishes for suspension cell to keep them in a suspended state.\nDynamic monitoring of islet function.",
    "Prepare perfusion buffers, including low glucose buffer, high glucose buffer and high potassium buffer, and incubate them at 37°C water bath.\nAssemble the perfusion device, including syringe pump, 10 mL injection syringe, 1 mm ID silastic tube, infusion warmer, three-way valve, 1.6 mm Luer taper, 0.45 μm bore diameter syringe filter, and needle for blood taking needle.\nEquilibration of islets in low-glucose buffer\nPick up 120 islets per group and incubate them in low glucose buffer at 37°C for 1 h, then transfer them into syringe filter.\nSwitch the three-way valve to connect the syringe filter and injection syringe with low-glucose buffer.\nAdjust the perfusion rate at 125 μL/min, then turn on the syringe pump to perfuse islets for 20 min with low-glucose buffer.\nIslet perfusion\nContinue to perfuse low glucose buffer for 10 min, and collect the perfusate every 1 min as one sample through the blood taking needle into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nSwitch the three-way valve to connect the syringe filter and injection syringe with high glucose buffer.\nTurn on the syringe pump loaded with high glucose buffer and simultaneously turn off the syringe buffer loaded with low glucose buffer.\nPerfuse with high glucose buffer for 25 min and collect the perfusate every 1 min as one sample.\nSwitch the three-way valve again to connect syringe filter and injection syringe with low glucose perfusion buffer.\nTurn off the syringe pump loaded with high glucose buffer and simultaneously turn on the syringe pump loaded with low glucose buffer to re-equilibrate islets for 20 min (Sun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nReplace the high glucose buffer with high potassium buffer and relevant silastic tube during re-equilibration.\nContinue to perfuse low glucose buffer for 10 min, and collect the perfusate every 1 min as one sample.",
    "Switch the three-way valve to connect the syringe filter and injection syringe with the high potassium buffer.\nContinue to perfuse high potassium buffer for 15 min, and collect the perfusate every 1 min as one sample. Turn off all of the syringe pump.\nThe perfusion samples can be stored at –20°C up to 4 weeks, or at –80°C up to 2 months.\nInsulin content extraction\nFlush out islets from the islet deposit chambers using 5 mL low glucose buffer.\nFlush the syringe three times and collect flushing buffer in a 10 cm dish.\nCount the number of islets and collect them in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, extract the insulin content with 1 mL extraction buffer at 4°C for 12 h.\nCentrifuge the extraction buffer at 4°C, 900 g for 5 min, and collect 500 μL supernatant. The samples can be stored at –20°C for up to 4 weeks, or at –80°C for up to 2 months.\nSample calibration\nCentrifuge the remaining islets at 300 g for 5 min and discard the liquid.\nExtract total DNA or protein and measure the relative concentration. If the number of islets differs between groups due to the manipulations, calibrate them according to islet number.\nThe DNA or protein concentration is used to calibrate the insulin secretion capability of each sample. Dynamic insulin secretion can be calibrated and recorded in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_914_15.csv\nPause point: Sample detection can be performed 1 day to several weeks after storing the samples at −20°C or –80°C.\nStatic monitoring of islet function\nPrepare buffer and incubate them at 37°C water bath.\nThe static assay is carried out in 48 well cell culture plate with 200 μL liquid per well.\nRun at least6 replicates per group, 8–10 islets are acceptable for each replicate.",
    "Equilibrate the islets in low glucose buffer and incubate for 1 h.\nRotate the plate in the same direction to gather the islets into the center of the well, then remove the fluid from the edge of the well and discard it.\nAdd another 200 μL low glucose buffer and incubate for 1 h, then collect 150 μL supernatant as the low glucose-stimulated insulin secretion sample.\nDiscard the remaining buffer, add 200 μL high glucose buffer and incubate for 1 h, then collect 150 μL supernatant as the high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion sample.\nDiscard the remaining buffer and extract the insulin content by adding 200 μL extraction buffer and incubating at 4°C for 12 h.\nThe sample calibration protocol is the same as that used for the dynamic monitoring assay.\nNote: Take care not to pipette any cell debris when acquiring the sample during the static assay\nCritical: The size of islets picked for dynamic or static monitoring assays should in a range of 150–300 μm diameter, too large or small are unsuitable. Determine the size of islets by using a microscope grid.\nPause point: Sample detection can be performed 1 day to several weeks after storing the samples at −20°C or –80°C.\nSample detection\nInsulin levels of perfusate, static samples and content samples are detected with insulin ELISA kits or radioimmunoassay.
