    "1. Tissue Dissection and Fixation\nTissue Dissection\nDissect tissue pieces from a surgically resected tumor specimen or tissue biopsy.\n\t\tNote: The tissue used in this study was routinely fixed in formalin but fresh tissue is also suitable. We selected an area confirmed and reported by an anatomical pathologist to contain somatostatinoma tumor after routine histological staining and anti-somatostatin immunostaining (not shown).\nUse tissue pieces no larger than approximately 1.0 mm3.\nCacodylate Buffer Preparation\nPrepare a stock buffer solution (1 M) by adding 21.4 g of sodium cacodylate (see Materials List) and 3.0 ml of 1% calcium chloride solution to 90 ml of distilled water and then topping up the solution to a final volume of 100 ml. Stir the solution and leave it to stand overnight so that the crystalline reagent fully dissolves.\nPrepare a buffer working solution by adding 20 ml of stock solution to 170 ml of water and then checking the pH with indicator strips. Adjust the pH to 7.4 by the addition of 3 - 4 drops of 3% HCl. Top up the solution to a final volume of 200 ml with final molarity of 0.1 M.\nFixative Preparation and Use\nAdd one 10 ml ampoule of 50% glutaraldehyde solution to 20 ml of sodium cacodylate stock solution (1 M). Top up with distilled water to 190 ml. Check the pH and adjust to 7.4 by adding 1 - 4 drops of 3% hydrochloric acid (HCl) if necessary.\nTop up with distilled water to make a final volume of 200 ml.\nImmerse the tissue in fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for 24 hr at 4 oC in a glass sample tube. Discard unused fixative after 1 week.\n2. Tissue Processing and Embedding\nOsmium Tetroxide Staining",
    "After fixation is complete, immerse the tissue in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 M) for 20 min then repeat for another 20 min.\nPrepare a 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide (OsO4) working solution by adding 8.0 ml of a 5% OsO4 stock solution to 2.0 ml of sodium cacodylate buffer stock solution (1 M) and 10.0 ml of distilled water to make a final volume of 20.0 ml.\nRemove the buffer then immerse the tissue in 2% OsO4 at pH 7.4 for 4 hr at room temperature.\nCAUTION! Use caution when decanting and preparing OsO4 solutions, wear appropriate personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood at all times.\nUranyl Acetate Staining\nAfter tissue osmication is complete, remove the OsO4 solution and immerse tissue in 2% sodium acetate for 10 min. Remove 2% sodium acetate then immerse in 2% uranyl acetate for 1 hr at room temperature.\nDehydration\nDehydrate tissue through graded alcohols. Use 50% ethanol for 10 mins, 70% ethanol for 10 min, 95% ethanol for 10 min and two changes of 100% ethanol for 20 min each at room temperature.\nPerform two changes of 100% acetone for 30 min each.\nResin Impregnation and Curing\nMix low-viscosity epoxy resin in a disposable polyethylene cup. Add 10.0 g of vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (ERL 4221) epoxy monomer, 6 g of diglycidyl ether of polypropylene glycol (DER 732) and 26.0 g of nonenyl succinic anhydride (NSA). Stir thoroughly by hand using wooden sticks for 2 min.\nAdd fifteen drops of 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) epoxy accelerator and stir again for 2 min. Take care to fully mix the ERL, DER and NSA components before adding the DMAE accelerator.",
    "Start resin impregnation of the tissue by replacing 100% acetone with 1:1 resin to acetone for 1 hr, then replace with 6:1 resin to acetone for 3 hr, and finally 100% resin overnight.\nTransfer the tissue into fresh resin in 8 mm micromoulds. Cure at 70 oC overnight. Resin should be hard but not brittle after curing.\n3. Ultramicrotomy\nKnife, Cutting Parameters and Section Thickness\nPlace a semithin diamond knife in the ultramicrotome and cut sections from the tissue at a thickness of 500 nm.\nFloat sections onto the water bath behind the knife edge. Pick up the sections on a glass slide and dry them down for 10 to 20 sec using a hotplate at approximately 110 oC.\nEtch the sections with sodium ethoxide solution for 20 sec and then wash off with 100% ethanol then distilled water. Stain with 2% methylene blue in 1% borax for 20 sec on the hotplate, rinse with running tap water for 5 sec and dry on the hotplate for 5 sec. Then stain with 1.5% basic fuchsin on the hotplate for 5 sec then dry on the hotplate for 20 sec.\nExamine by bright-field light microscopy and confirm that tumor cells and a region of interest (ROI) are present in the section.\nChange the semithin diamond knife to an ultrathin diamond knife and set the correct knife angle and cutting speed as recommended by the knife manufacturer.\nCut ultrathin sections at 90 nm thickness. Observe the gold coloration of the sections when floating on the water bath.\nStretch and flatten the sections by waving chloroform vapor from a 1 cm2 piece of filter paper within a few millimeters of the sections. Take care not to bring the chloroform soaked paper into contact with the water surface.\nUltrathin Section Grid Mounting",
    "Lift up the ultrathin sections from the water surface using a 300-mesh thin-bar nickel TEM grid that has been dipped in  section adhesive solution. Locate the sections on the dull side of the grid. The grids have a dull or matt surface on one side and a polished or shiny surface on the other side. No support film is required. Note: It is necessary to handle these grids with anti-magnetic forceps to avoid grids sticking to the forceps.\nPrepare the section adhesive by placing 20 cm of clear adhesive tape in a 5 ml vial with 2.0 ml of acetone. Cap and shake the vial, let stand for 10 min then remove the tape leaving the adhesive solution.\n4. Immunolabeling\nAntigen Unmasking\nPrepare 1 ml of fresh saturated sodium metaperiodate etching solution in distilled water and use it immediately. Place droplets of the etching solution on a clean labfilm surface.\nPlace completely dry grids with sections down on droplets of sodium metaperiodate solution at room temperature for 30 min. Transfer the grids to distilled water droplets for 60 sec of washing.\nAntibody Incubation and QD Probe Labeling\nPerform all incubations and labeling on droplets of solution placed on a clean Parafilm surface.\nPlace the grid on a droplet of 0.05 M glycine in PBS for 10 min to block residual aldehyde in the section. Remove the aldehyde block by briefly blotting the edge of the grid.\nPlace the grid on a droplet of 1% normal goat serum (NGS) and 1% BSAc (10%) in PBS for 10 min. Prepare the blocking solution by adding 10 μl of NGS and 100 μl of BSAc to 890 μl of PBS to give a final volume of 1,000 μl.\nCondition the sections by placing on a droplet of antibody diluent for 10 min.",
    "Perform the immunolabeling incubation using anti-somatostatin polyclonal antibody diluted 1:10 with antibody diluent giving a concentration of 3.47 g/L. Note: Antibody incubation is done by placing grids on droplets for 1 hr at room temperature in a moist chamber.\nRemove antibody reagent from step 4.2.5 by blotting the edge of the grid then wash sections on diluent for 2 x 5 min.\nIncubate in secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal) diluted 1:10 for 1 hr at room temperature. Remove the secondary antibody solution. Wash in diluent for 2 x 5 min.\nIncubate in streptavidin conjugated QDs (585 nm) diluted 1:10 for 1 hr at room temperature. Cover with aluminum foil to reduce light exposure during the incubation.\nWash grids in fresh distilled water for 2 min. Blot the edges of the grid dry.\n5. Fluorescence Light Microscopy\nLight Source and Filter Cubes\nUse 365 nm light emitting diode (LED) illumination for wide-field fluorescence light microscopy. Insert a filter cube with the following characteristics: (Ex G 365 nm, BS FT 395 and EM LP 420 nm).\n\t\tNote: This filter cube will permit the emission spectra of all QDs sizes to be visualized simultaneously under the same excitation wavelength.\nViewing and Imaging Sections\nPlace the immunostained grid section down on a glass slide in a droplet of water and cover with a glass cover slip (thickness number 1.5). Use light microscopy to evaluate the labeling pattern, the level of any non-specific labeling and to establish that negative controls are clear of labeling.\nIdentify ROI in relation to grid bars. Finder grids may be helpful for establishing co-ordinates of target structures.",
    "Acquire images of positive labeling on the section using a full color digital camera with the camera setting at \"FL auto colour\" and \"White Balance\" set at 3,200K. Use the camera in \"Automatic exposure\" mode with a \"Gamma\" setting between 0.45 and 1.00 to optimize the appearance of the images and \"Analog Gain\" set at 1x. Click the camera icon in the Zen 2 Lite software graphical interface to \"Live\", focus the image then click \"Snap\" to capture the image to the framestore.\nSave images as .tif files to avoid compression and pixelation becoming apparent.\nPrepare a print showing the position of the ROI in relation to the grid bars or other significant tissue landmarks. These prints will be useful for subsequent navigation of the section and re-finding ROIs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\nRemove the grid from the slide, wash in distilled water and gently blot the edges dry.\n\t\tNote: Do not use overly intense illumination to acquire fluorescence images. The photostability of QDs allows imaging times of up to a few seconds but take care not to prolong exposure as quenching of the QD signal can occur after approximately 1 min in water. Extended or permanent photostability is only obtained when QD labeled sections are dehydrated with toluene and embedded under coverslips as per the manufacturers specifications. However, this process will then exclude the possibility of correlative examination of the same section by TEM.\n6. Transmission Electron Microscopy\nTEM Set Up and Viewing\nTransfer the grid to the TEM for examination using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Use low magnification of approximately 1,400X to navigate around the grid and find ROIs that correlate with the light microscopy views. View clusters of QDs at magnifications around 50,000X.",
    "Observe individual QDs at 70,000X magnification or above. Observe the QDs as irregular crystalline structures with moderate electron density.\nImaging\nUse a digital camera for TEM imaging. A monochrome 1,392 x 1,040 pixel sensor is adequate.\nAcquire images by clicking the \"Camera\" icon to \"On\" in the microscope graphical interface of the imaging software, then to \"Off\" to store the image in the framestore. Note: these operations will differ depending on the microscope system being used. Use the camera in automatic exposure mode with a \"Gamma\" setting of 1.00.\nSave images as .tif files.\n7. CLEM Imaging\nLocating a Fluorescence ROI by TEM\nUse a print from the light microscopy image to locate corresponding ROIs by TEM. Tissue architectural features such as blood vessels and luminal structures are useful for navigation around the section using TEM.\nCapture an image of the corresponding ROI by TEM.\nCLEM Image Overlay\nMake sure the TEM image is correctly orientated with the light microscopy image and correct the enlargement of each so that the same structure seen in each modality is the same size.\nOrientate the light microscopy and TEM images and display them side-by-side or as overlays to highlight the ultrastructural features of immunolabeled ROIs.\nCreate an overlay image using Photoshop CS2. First, enlarge the fluorescence image to the same magnification as a low power TEM image. Orientate both images and then paste them side by side on one canvas.\nFlatten the image.\nCreate the fluorescence overlay from this composite image. Click on the \"Rectangular Marquee Tool\", select the fluorescence image and create a duplicate layer from it.\nAdjust the \"Layer Style/Blending options\" to 30 - 40% transparency.\nClick on the \"Move Tool\" and drag the fluorescence overlay layer over the corresponding TEM image. Align the images.",
    "After achieving the alignment, \"Flatten\" the layers to produce the final overlay image.\nUse the \"Rectangular Marquee Tool\" to select the new overlay image and copy it to a new canvas. Save this as a .tiff file.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
