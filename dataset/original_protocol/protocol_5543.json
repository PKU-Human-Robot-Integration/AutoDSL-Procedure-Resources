    "Overview Note: Overview of the procedure (Graphics adapted from Davies et al., 2017).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171129/20171129190935_2986.jpgSteps 3C library preparationFixation (2 h)Note: The fixation procedure described below has been optimized for erythroid cells. Depending on the cell type used, some of centrifugation steps might need to be adjusted to ensure proper pelleting. Pre-cool centrifuge to 4 °C. Chill glycine, PBS, and lysis buffer (see Recipes).Collect cells from tissue and make single-cell suspensions of 10,000 to 106 cells in 1 ml growth media. If sorting cells, sort into 100 μl media and add media afterwards to a total volume of 1 ml.Add 54 μl 37% formaldehyde (2% final concentration), mix well and incubate for 10 min at RT on a rocking or tumbling incubator. Quench by adding 150 μl 1 M cold glycine (1/8 of the final volume. i.e., 1.2 ml).Centrifuge for 15 min/500 x g/4 °C.Carefully remove supernatant, do not disturb pellet. Can leave ~5% behind.Wash pellet by gently resuspending in 1 ml cold PBS. Centrifuge for 15 min/500 x g/4 °C.Carefully remove supernatant, do not disturb pellet. Can leave ~5% behind.Resuspend pellet in 500 μl cold lysis buffer.Incubate for 20 min on ice.Snap freeze with ethanol and dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Snap freezing aids digestion so cells can be thawed again for digestion at this point or stored long-term at -80 °C.SAFE STOPPING POINT: Store at -80 °C.Digestion (1 day)Pre-warm a ThermoMixer to 37 °C.Prepare Digestion Mix (make a master mix for multiple libraries):table:\n﻿0,1\nPCR grade water,152.5 μl\n10x DpnII Buffer,20 μl\n20% SDS,2.5 μl",
    "Defrost aliquots of 10,000 to 106 formaldehyde-fixed cells for each reaction.Centrifuge for 10 min/15,000 x g/4 °C.Carefully remove all the lysis buffer, using a P20 to remove residual buffer without disturbing the pellet.Resuspend in 175 μl of Digestion Mix.Shake horizontally (1,400 rpm) for 1 h at 37 °C using the ThermoMixer.Add 16 μl of 20% Triton X-100 (1.7% final concentration) and shake for 1 h at 37 °C.Add first aliquot of 3 μl of DpnII enzyme and shake at 37 °C for at least two hours.Add a second aliquot of 3 μl of DpnII enzyme at the end of the day and shake overnight.Add a further 3 μl of DpnII enzyme the next morning and shake for at least three more hours.Ligation (1 day)Place the digests on the 65 °C block for 20 min to heat inactivate the restriction enzyme.Cool the digest on ice and cool the ThermoMixer to 16 °C.Make Ligation Mix (make a master mix for multiple libraries):table:\n﻿0,1\nPCR grade water,125 μl\n10x ligation buffer,36 μl",
    "Add 161 μl Ligation Mix to digest.Add 4 μl T4 ligase and shake at 300 rpm/16 °C for ~22 h.De-crosslinking (1 day)Add 2 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubate at 65 °C overnight.DNA extraction (1 day)Add 4 μl of RNase to the ligation reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Add 350 μl phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and vortex thoroughly.Transfer to a 2 ml PLG Light tube and spin for 5 min/15,000 x g/RT.Transfer the upper layer, ~350 μl, to a new tube.Add 35 μl of 3 M NaOAc and 2 μl of GlycoBlue and mix by inversion.Add 960 μl of 100% ethanol and mix by inversion.Freeze at -20 °C overnight.SAFE STOPPING POINT: DNA should be precipitated for at least one night; this can be extended to several days without affecting recovery.Pre-cool centrifuge to 4 °C during incubation.Centrifuge for 45 min/21,000 x g/4 °C and carefully discard liquid.Wash pellet with 1 ml 70% ice-cold ethanol.Spin for 10 min/21,000 x g/4 °C.Remove ethanol and repeat ethanol wash (steps A5j-A5k).Remove ethanol, spin in a microfuge and use a pipette to remove residual ethanol.Dry at room temperature and resuspend pellet. When proceeding with LI-Capture-C, resuspend in 124 μl water. For Tag-Capture-C, the amount of water depends on the input, as several tagmentation reactions are set up in parallel (explained below). Use 20 μl water per multitude of 15,000 cells and round up (e.g., 30,000 cells:40 μl water; 50,000 cells:80 μl water).SAFE STOPPING POINT: Store at -20 °C.Quantification and QC (3 h)Note: The NanoDrop or similar spectrophotometers are unreliable for quantifying 3C libraries due to residual DTT from the ligation buffer. Assess 1 μl of 3C library using the Agilent Genomic ScreenTape system to determine the size distribution of library (Appendix I[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171129/Supplemental%20file%20Appendix%20I%20II%20III.docx]).",
    "For LI-Capture-C–take 3 μl of 3C library and 27 μl water to make a 1/10 dilution; for Tag-Capture-C–take 1 μl of 3C library and 29 μl water to make a 1/30 dilution.Perform qPCR for digestion efficiency, using the dilution. Genomic DNA can be used as the undigested control (Appendix I[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171129/Supplemental%20file%20Appendix%20I%20II%20III.docx]). Digestion efficiency should be > 75%.Addition of Illumina sequencing adaptors by ligation or tagmentation to generate Capture-C libraries LI-Capture-C–Based on the protocol for the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7370)Notes:  In this step, it is important to maintain library complexity by maximizing input DNA and minimizing DNA losses during the reactions and cleanups. When more than 1 μg of DNA is available, perform parallel preparations. These can be pooled during cleanups and at the end.The NEB protocol often recommends removing the DNA from the beads with a few μl more water than is necessary for the next step in the protocol. One can avoid doing this to minimize losses, but this means being very careful with the bead cleanups as contamination by the beads or ethanol can inhibit the following reaction.We use the Covaris S220 Focused Ultrasonicator for sonication. If using a different model sonicator, use high molecular weight gDNA to optimize sonication for a modal distribution around 200 bp in size (Appendix II[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171129/Supplemental%20file%20Appendix%20I%20II%20III.docx]). The Illumina indices that you put on to the library need to be complementary to the Nimblegen HE blocking oligonucleotides required in the capture step (the kits do not match; Appendix II[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20171129/Supplemental%20file%20Appendix%20I%20II%20III.docx]). Buying both primer set 1 and primer set 2 eliminates waste of the more expensive Nimblegen blocking kit.No size selection is necessary as adaptor dimers will not be captured. All Ampure XP bead cleanups are performed with 1.8x volumes of beads.",

Tag-Capture-CNotes: In this step, it is important to maintain library complexity by maximizing input DNA and minimizing DNA losses during the reactions and cleanups. The maximum input for a tagmentation reaction is 50 ng. When input is higher, run several separate reactions in parallel; these can be pooled after the cleanup.We use custom designed index primers, for which the sequences can be found in the Appendix. We order these as TruGrade Primers from IDT.No size selection is necessary as adaptor dimers won’t be captured. All Ampure XP bead cleanups are performed with 1.8x volumes of beads.

If performing LI-Capture-C, you can use the commercially available blocking oligonucleotides from Nimblegen. If you are following the Tag-Capture-C protocol, you can contact IDT and design blocking oligonucleotides using their xGen Custom Blocking Oligos service. We used a universal blocker for both the i5 adapter and i7 adapters, so we only needed 2 blocking oligonucleotides for all possible index combinations. Hybridization preparation (1 day)Note: Ensure capture oligonucleotides for different experiments are kept apart. The oligonucleotides are hugely in excess and tiny amounts of contamination can lead to spurious results. We would recommend that you do not order oligonucleotides that should not be mixed from the manufacturer at the same time. Avoid having buffers and blocking oligonucleotides out at the same time as the capture oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides that are going to be pooled for a single experiment, can be ordered together. Consider ordering large designs in as a pooled set (at equimolar concentrations).Biotinylated capture oligonucleotides Reconstitute individual or pools of oligonucleotides to a stock concentration so that each oligo is stored at 2.9 μM (10 nmol in 3.46 μl of PCR grade water)–or any high concentration.Generate pools of oligonucleotides by mixing in exact 1:1 stoichiometric ratio.Nimblegen blocking oligonucleotides (LI-Capture-C)Resuspend Nimblegen oligonucleotides according to the Nimblegen protocol:Spin down tubes in a minifuge.Add 120 μl PCR grade water to the HE Universal Oligo tube (1 mM); vortex and spin briefly.",
    "Add 10 μl PCR grade water to the HE Index Oligo tube (1 mM); vortex and spin briefly.Add 480 μl PCR grade water to the Post-LM-PCR Oligos; vortex and spin briefly.Custom blocking oligonucleotides (Tag-Capture-C)Resuspend the blocking oligonucleotides according to manufacturer’s instructions.Multiplexing of samplesMix up to 1 μg of each differentially indexed sample at exactly 1:1 ratios by mass to generate a multiplexed library.Hybridization (3 days)Heat vacuum centrifuge to 50 °C.Prepare hybridization reaction for the number of pooled libraries–up to 6 libraries are captured in a single tube. For more libraries, a master mix may be made in one tube and divided into multiple tubes.5 μg COT DNA (5 μl of stock)/library1 nmol TS-HE Universal Oligo (1 μl of 1 mM stock aliquot)/library 1 nmol of TS-HE Index Oligos (1 μl of 1 mM stock for each index) up to 1 μg of each uniquely indexed 3C libraryNote: For fewer than 100,000 cells you may not recover > 1 μg after indexing. Use as much as possible. Vacuum centrifuge at 50 °C with tube lids open (rather than pierced) until sample is completely dry. Avoid drying for a long time after the liquid is gone.For each library in the capture reaction add:7.5 μl 2x hybridization buffer (vial 5)3 μl hybridization component A (vial 6) Carefully reconstitute the DNA by pipetting and vortexing followed by briefly spinning down.Replace buffers and blocking oligonucleotides in freezer prior to proceeding.Preheat the Eppendorf ThermoMixer to 95 °C.Preheat a PCR block to 47 °C, the lid should be heated to 57 °C.Heat 4.5 μl per library of pooled biotinylated oligonucleotide probes to 47 °C in a PCR tube.Note: The capture will be at 47 °C for ~72 h. A high-quality PCR tube is required to avoid sample loss through evaporation.",
    "Denature the 3C library and blocking oligonucleotides by heating to 95 °C for 10 min.After 10 min, quickly spin the denatured library and add the entire volume to the pooled biotinylated oligonucleotides without removing from the thermocycler.Mix and spin briefly before replacing in the 47 °C PCR machine for 64-72 h.Washing and recovery of captured material (1 day)Notes: Heat reagents on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer as it is more reliable than a water bath and allows the samples to be shaken.For capture of multiplexed libraries, scale the beads and wash buffers accordingly to the number of libraries.The Stringent Wash buffer, Wash Buffer I and Bead Wash Buffer are quite voluminous and may need to be made in multiple tubes. Split Wash Buffer I 1:2 as one third is heated. Dilute the wash buffers as per table below which allows a slight excess of each.Place the Stringent Wash Buffer at 47 °C on the ThermoMixer.Place 100 μl Wash Buffer I per captured library with an additional 20 μl at 47 °C on the ThermoMixer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171129/20171129194624_0766.jpgNote: The streptavidin beads will likely stick to the interior of the tube. This is particularly a problem with some makes of low bind tubes. Use tubes with minimal adhesion. We use Safeseal tubes (Sorenson) for this step.Prepare the streptavidin beads (M270):Allow the beads to heat to RT for 30 min prior to use.Aliquot 100 μl per captured library into a single 1.5 ml Eppendorf.Place on the DynaMag and remove liquid once clear.Add 200 μl of 1x Bead Wash Buffer per captured library and vortex to resuspend the beads, spin briefly.Replace on the DynaMag for 5 min and remove liquid once clear.Repeat wash steps (C3b.iii-C3b.v) for a total of two washes.Resuspend the beads in their original volume (i.e.",

Do not allow beads to dry out.Binding of biotinylated oligonucleotides:Transfer the hybridization reactions to the streptavidin beads and mix thoroughly by pipetting 10 times.Spin briefly if necessary to pool all of the sample in the bottom of the tube.Place on the ThermoMixer at 47 °C, 600 rpm for 45 min. Mix the beads with a pipette every 15 min to avoid beads settling at the bottom of the tube.Note: Steps C3d.i-C3d.vii should be done quickly to maintain the temperature at 47 °C.Washing the streptavidin beads and bound DNA:Add 100 μl of heated Wash Buffer I (47 °C) per captured library to the beads and bound DNA.Mix by vortexing.Place on the DynaMag, carefully discard all the supernatant when clear.Add 200 μl Stringent Wash buffer per captured library heated to 47 °C and mix.Incubate for 5 min at 47 °C.Place the tubes on the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.Repeat stringent wash (C3d.iv-C3d.vi) for a total of 2 washes.Add 200 μl Wash Buffer I (1x) at RT per captured library and mix by vortexing for 2 min. Spin briefly to ensure no sample is lost in the lid.Place the tubes on the DynaMag, carefully discard the supernatant when clear.Add 200 μl Wash Buffer II (1x) per captured library and mix by vortexing for 1 min.

    "SAFE STOPPING POINT: Store at -20 °C.Double capture (3 days)Note: Capture efficiency is improved by 100-1,000 fold by performing a second capture step. This increases the proportion of captured reads from 1% to 50%. This means only ~1 million reads are needed per viewpoint per sample and thus reduces sequencing requirements. Therefore, double capture is standard practice in our lab. Pool amplified material of the parallel PCR reactions.Prepare the second capture hybridization reaction using all captured material (up to 2 μg) in a single reaction. Combine:5 μg COT DNA (5 μl of stock)1 nmol TS-HE Universal Oligo (1 μl of 1 mM stock aliquot) 1 nmol of TS-HE Index Oligos (1 μl of 1 mM stock in total; so if you have 4 samples, use 0.25 μl of each index for a total of 1 μl; consider making a dilution if you have many samples)Up to 2 μg of amplified captured materialPerform hybridization, washes, and amplification as described with a 24-h hybridization at 47 °C and treating the material as a single library.SAFE STOPPING POINT: Store at -20 °C.Library quantification and sequencing (1 day)Use qPCR with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit to calculate the concentration of adaptor containing fragments.Make 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 dilutions of the captured material for quantification.Sequence using Illumina paired-end sequencing with either 150 bp or 75 bp reads (300-cycle and 150-cycle kits)."
