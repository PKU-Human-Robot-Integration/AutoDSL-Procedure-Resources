    "The study was approved by the Research and Community Ethics Boards of Unité de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle and University of Montréal and was done in compliance with the code of ethics as stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent following careful screening for MRI compatibility and were financially compensated for their participation.\n1. tDCS Material\nMake sure all necessary materials are available before starting the experiment (see Figure 1 for list).\n\tNote: Different electrode sizes are available for tDCS. For this study, two 5 x 7 cm rubber electrodes will be used. Other sizes can be chosen depending on the area of stimulation and the desired focality of the stimulation 48.\nMake sure to check that the batteries of the DC-stimulator are charged and to periodically charge them since the device cannot be charged or plugged-in during stimulation for safety reasons.\n2. Planning of the Conditions for Stimulation\nTurn on the tDCS device according to the instructions included with the device. Pre-set the tDCS device for two different stimulation modes (active and sham).\nAs some devices do not have a pre-set mode, select the appropriate sham parameters before starting stimulation.\n\t\nPre-define a set of parameters by loading a setting. Press the button 2 or 4 to select from the main menu the \"system\" option (see Figure 2).\nMove the cursor to line 2 on the display by pressing the button 3.\nPress the button 2 or 4 until the \"load setting\" shows on the display. Press the button 3.\nSelect the letter of the setting (A, B, C or D) by pressing the button 2 or 4.\nMove the cursor upwards with the button 1. The display will automatically show the \"parameters\" option.",
    "Set the tDCS device to a current of 1 mA. To do so, press the button 1 to select the line 3 of the \"parameters\" menu of the display. Select the \"current\" option by pressing the button 2 or 4. Press the button 3 to reach the line 4 and modify the intensity to 1,000 μA by pressing the button 2 or 4.\nPress the button 1 to go back to the line 3. Select the \"fade in\" option from the screen menu of the device by pressing the button 2 or 4. Press the button 3 to go to the line 4 and press the buttons 2 and 4 to adjust the duration to 15 s.\n\t\tNote: Fade in durations can be modified.\nPress the button 1 to go back to the line 3. Select the \"fade out\" option from the screen menu of the device by pressing the buttons 2 or 4. Press the button 3 to go to the line 4 and press the buttons 2 and 4 to adjust the duration to 15 s.\n\t\tNote: Fade in durations can be modified.\nPress the button 1 to go back to the line 3. Press the button 2 or 4 until the \"duration\" option shows on the display menu. Press the button 3 to go to the line 4 and press the button 2 and 4 to adjust the duration to the minimum duration available on the device (15 s for the present device; see Figure 3b).\n\t\tNote: This will induce a tingling sensation similar to the active stimulation.\nPress the buttons 1 and 3 simultaneously to save the changes of the setting.",
    "Pre-program the active stimulation parameters. To do so, follow the same instructions as for the setting of the sham stimulation, but program the duration to 1,200 sec (20 min; see Figure 3a).\nPre-program the test stimulation parameters. To do so, follow the same instructions as for the setting of the sham stimulation but program the duration to 45 sec.\n\tNote: The test stimulation will be used for the measurement of the impedance prior to the experimentation.\nPseudo-randomly assign the conditions of stimulation to participants.\nAssign a number to each of the three conditions for a blind experimentation: 1) bilateral: anodal right, cathodal left; 2) bilateral: anodal left, cathodal right; 3) sham: anodal right, cathodal left.\n3. Consenting the Participants\nInform the participant of the procedure and sign consent form.\n\t\nVerify that participants do not have any contraindication to tDCS: a psychiatric or neurological history, the presence of a pacemaker, metal implanted in skull, a history of fainting, a history of seizures, a history of substance abuse, a family history of seizure, a history of febrile fits, a lack of sleep in the preceding night, a history of skin sensitivity, and any alcohol consumption the previous day.\nInform the participant of the most reported side-effects of tDCS: mild tingling; moderate fatigue; light sensation of itching under the electrodes; slight burning sensation.\nInform the participant of the usual MR contraindications and side effects.\n4. Measurements for Electrodes Placement\nUse the 10/20 international system to find the following landmarks on the participant head: nasion and inion (Figure 4a), preauricular points, and the two targeted areas: C3 and C4 (Figure 4b).",
    "Locate the nasion as the distinct depressed area located on the bridge of the nose at the level between both eyes. Locate the inion as the most prominent projection of the occipital bone located at the lower part of the skull. Locate the preauricular point near each ear; it is the indentation above the zygomatic notch. Locate the C3 and C4 based on measurements as described below.\nUse a measuring tape to measure the distance between the nasion and inion along the midline of the head and make a mark at 50% of the distance with a non-permanent hydro marker.\nUse a measuring tape to measure the distance between the two preauricular points and make a mark with a non-permanent hydro marker at 50% of the distance in line with the previous mark. This point corresponds to Cz (vertex).\nFrom the Cz, along the line created between the preauricular points, mark two points, one on each side, with a non-permanent hydro marker that correspond to 20% of the total distance. These marks correspond to the target areas (C3 and C4, Figure 4b).\n\tNote: Other methods such as TMS or neuronavigation can also be used to localize M1.\n5. Placement of Electrodes\nMove as much hair as possible away from the targeted areas that will be stimulated. Apply an EEG-type exfoliating gel with a cotton-swab to clean the targeted areas.\nClean the targeted areas with a 70% isopropyl alcohol and pumice prepping pad to enhance electrode contact.\nGenerously cover the entire electrode with an EEG-type conductive paste. Ensure that the paste is approximately 5 mm thick across the entire surface. Make sure the entire rubber area is covered with paste. Lightly wet the target areas and the conductive paste on the electrodes with a saline solution.",
    "Position the electrodes as shown in Figure 4b and press the electrodes firmly onto the targeted areas. Place a rubber band around the head of the participant to ensure optimal stability of the electrodes. Adjust it in such a way that the participant will experience no pain or discomfort during the scanning session.\nMake sure that the leads do not come in contact with the skin to avoid potential burns.\n6. tDCS Test Outside the Scanner Room\nUse a multimeter to verify the proper functioning of the electrode cable and resistance.\nTurn on the tDCS device and load the test stimulation settings.\n\t\nPress the button 2 or 4 to select from the main menu the \"system\" option. Move the cursor to line 2 on the display by pressing the button 3. Press the button 2 or 4 until the \"load setting\" shows on the display. Press the button 3. Select the letter of the pre-programmed test setting (A, B, C or D) by pressing the button 2 or 4.\nMove the cursor upwards with the button 1. The display will automatically show \"parameters\" option. On the first line, press the button 2. The display will show \"stimulation?\" with the different pre-programmed parameters.\nPress the button 1 to start the stimulation. The display will show the impedance level and automatically stop if it reaches more than 20 kΩ. If the impedance level is over 20 kΩ, unplug the electrode wires from the inner box and exit the scanning room to verify the positioning of the electrodes.\nRedo the test stimulation. When a good level of impedance is reached and when the test stimulation is over, unplug the electrodes from the inner box.\n7. tDCS Setup",
    "As shown in Figure 5, place the tDCS device and the outer box in the scanner control room.\n\tNote: The tDCS device and the outer box are not MR compatible and should not be taken into the magnet environment.\nPlug the outer box wires into the tDCS device and then plug the long box cable into the outer box.\nRun the tDCS box cable from the scanner control room into the MRI room. Make sure to run this cable as straight as possible, avoiding any kinks or loops, along the wall of the MRI room towards the back of the MRI scanner. Put multiple MR compatible sandbags on the cable to ensure its stability, as shown in Figure 5.\nBring the inner box into the MRI room and plug the long box cable into it (Figure 5).\n8. MRI Scan Preparation\nAsk the participant to enter the MRI room, if not already in there from the tDCS test, and to put in earplugs.\nPut a thin cushion under the coil area of the MRI table. Ask the participant to lie down on the table. Put a cushion under the legs of the participant for comfort and a blanket if needed. Give the participant the alarm button for security purposes.\nPut separate headphones over both ears to allow transmission of information from the scanner control room to the participant in the MRI room.\nPosition the participant’s head as high as possible under the area where the head coil will be positioned (top of the head as close as possible to the top of the table where the coil will be placed). Put the electrode wires along the right side of the head of the participant, as recommended by the tDCS device company.",
    "Place the 32-channel receive-only coil around the head of the participant. Run the electrode cables through the right side of the coil. Position the head of the participant as straight as possible using a red positioning laser (built-in feature of the scanner).\nAsk the participant to move arms and legs into a comfortable position, while making sure that hands do not touch. Make sure to remind the participant to stay as still as possible during the entire session. When the participant is ready, move the table past the middle line to reach the electrode wires at the back of the scanner.\nUse medical tape to stabilize the electrode cable on the right side of the back of the coil. Plug the electrode wires located inside the scanner into the tDCS inner box. Put the inner box on the right side of the scanner with a sandbag on it for maximal stability.\nMove the table back into its final position. Keep the tDCS turned on and the electrodes plugged into the outer box for the entire MRI session.\n9. Pre-tDCS 1H-MRS Session\nRun a localizer sequence to acquire images needed to verify the proper positioning of the head and to compare to a second localizer which will be acquired at the end of the session to check for overall movement.\nAcquire anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE images for the positioning of the M1 voxel and detection of possible structural abnormalities (TR = 2,300 msec; TE = 2.91 msec; FA: 9°; FOV = 256 x 256 mm; 256 x 256 matrix; TI : 900 msec; 176 slices; orientation: sagittal; acquisition time: 4 min 12 sec).\nPerform a multi-planner reconstruction of the images in planes that are more appropriate for visualization of the spectroscopy volume-of-interest (VOI).",
    "In the 3D card, browse the MPRAGE raw images (sagittal orientation). From the \"creating parallel ranges\" window select \"axial 2X2\". Adjust the position of the parallel lines and click on save to create the axial orthogonal view.\nFrom the \"creating parallel ranges\" window select \"coronal 2X2\". Adjust the position of the parallel lines and click on \"save\" to create the coronal orthogonal view.\nLocate the left M1 based on Yousry and collaborators’ 49 anatomical landmarks on the three orientation slices. Then, position the VOI (30 x 30 x 30 mm3) on the area without any angulation relative to the scanner axis (figure 6).\nAcquire a line-width scan (21 s).\n\t\nSelect the spectroscopy card to measure water line-width on the real part of the signal from this line-width scan. Load the line-width raw data from the browser. Load the line-width measurement protocol (protocols menu: select the protocol).\nAdjust the phase using the scanner software interactive post-processing tools. Select the phase correction section and adjust the phase for the baseline with the cursor.\nIn order to reduce the line-width, run the FAST(EST)MAP 50 sequence three times. Repeat the line-width scan and the line-width measurement (step 9.5). Note the final water line-width.\nStart 4 blocks of 64 metabolite scans (32 \"EDIT OFF\" and 32 \"EDIT ON\", interleaved) with a MEGA-PRESS sequence 44,45, where VAPOR 51, OVS 51 and individual storage of FIDs are enabled (TR = 3 s, TE = 68 msec, total acquisition time: 12 min)\nAcquire a water reference using MEGA-PRESS sequence without MEGA water suppression, with VAPOR suppression (\"only RF off\") and with a delta measurement at 0 ppm. Acquire a single block of 4 metabolite scans instead of 64 (acquisition time: 42 sec).\n10. tDCS Procedure",
    "Inform the participant that the tDCS stimulation will start and that the scanner will be silent for the entire stimulation.\nSelect one of the two previously programmed parameters according to the condition and start the stimulation. Keep track of the impedance and voltage during the 20 min of stimulation. When the stimulation is over, notify the participant that the post-tDCS MRS session will begin. Do not turn off the tDCS device.\n11. Post-tDCS 1H-MRS Session\nRun the same metabolite scans with MEGA-PRESS sequence as the pre-tDCS scan but double the blocks of acquisition (8 blocks of 64 scans (32 \"EDIT OFF\" and 32 \"EDIT ON\", interleaved)) to acquire the metabolites at two different time points post-tDCS.\nAs with the pre-tDCS session, acquire a water reference scan using the same parameters. Finish the session with a localizer sequence.\nVisually compare the localizer images acquired at the beginning and end of the scanning session as an index of head motion.\nAccess the viewing card and go to the browser menu. Select the first and second localizer raw images. Load the images in the viewing card and compare both images. Export data in the dicom format through the server.\n12. Analysis of the 1H-MRS Data\nImport data using a programming and processing software, and adjust frequency and phase of individually stored FIDs using tCr and tCho signal between 2.85 and 3.40 ppm. To do so, use the software’s lsqnonlin function to fit frequency and phase of each individual Fourier-transformed FIDs (spectra) to the average spectra of the session.\n\tNote: this is a site-specific approach and other methods for importing and analyzing data will not necessarily affect data quality.",
    "To obtain the final spectra, subtract the signals from alternate scans with the selective double-banded pulses that were applied at 4.7 ppm and 7.5 ppm (\"EDIT OFF\") and at 1.9 ppm and 4.7 ppm (\"EDIT ON\") (Figure 7).\nUse the LCModel 52 for the analysis of both difference and \"EDIT OFF\" spectra. Deactivate default simulations and baseline modeling.\nPerform a visual inspection of the spectra to exclude sessions with contamination from subscapular lipid signal (see Figure 9).\nAs part of quality control, exclude spectra with linewidth of tCr-CH3 above 10 Hz. Only include in the analysis metabolites (GABA, Glx, tCr, tNAA) which were quantified with Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) lower than 35%.\n\tNote: CRLB provide estimated error of the metabolite quantification. CRLB > 50% is not reliable and is a recommended cut-off by LCModel manual. Many in the field have used a CRLB lower than 35% as a standard. 53-55 Additionally, the CRLB should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.\nObtain GABA and Glx quantifications from the \"DIFF\" spectra, tCr from the \"EDIT OFF\" spectra, and tNAA from both \"EDIT OFF\" and \"DIFF\". Express concentrations of the different metabolites of interest as ratios over tCr. For GABA and Glx, multiply the ratio by the following group-averaged correction factor to account for the different basis set used for the numerator and denominator (tNAA from \"EDIT OFF\" spectra / tNAA from \"DIFF\" spectra).\n\tNote: Note: GABA and Glx concentrations can also be quantified using water or NAA signal.\nSubscription Required.
