  "procedures": [
    "These experimental protocols have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee certifying that all subjects and procedures are in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Subjects\nPurchase and/or breed male Sprague-Dawley rats (260 - 300 g).\nHouse rats individually in wire mesh cages. Maintain them on a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle with rat chow and water available ad libitum.\nAssign appropriate sample sizes (e.g., n ≈ 6 - 8) randomly into groups.\n2. Testing Apparatus and Intake Procedures\nUse calibrated centrifuge tubes with rubber stoppers and a 45° angle metal sipper tube to provide accurate measurement (± 0.1 ml) of the presented solutions. Secure them to the home cages by a taut metal spring to allow visibility of the calibrations.\nRestrict food rations (~ 15/g/day) of the rats to reduce weight to 85% of their original body weight to increase motivation to consume the solutions. Note: The weight reduction should take between 3 - 5 days.\nProvide pre-training solutions (10 ml) of 0.2% saccharin for four days over a 1 hr session to maximize the probability that rats will sample the subsequent test solutions with short (less than 1 min) latency.\nConfirm flow through the centrifuge tube by spilling a few drops.\nWeigh tubes before and after each session to obtain intake measurement.\nPerform an intake test on the fifth day on subgroups receiving one of six solutions (10 ml, 1 hr): a) water, b) novel flavored (0.05% cherry flavor) 0.2% saccharin, c) 8% fructose, d) 8% glucose, e) 3.5% corn oil suspended in 0.3% xanthan gum, and f) 0.3% xanthan gum.\nEnsure that the nutrient solutions are isocaloric; thus, the 3.5% corn-oil concentration is isocaloric to the 8% sugar solutions.",
    "Ensure that rats sample solutions with short latency (less than 1 min). If this requirement is not met, then discard the subject from the study.\n3. Tissue Preparation\nAnesthetize each animal by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital 90 min after initial exposure to each test solution. Confirm that animals are properly anesthetized by demonstrating that the animal is no longer responsive to such reflexes as withdrawal to foot pinch, blinking following direct corneal pressure or head shaking to deep pinna stimulation.\nPerfuse each animal transcardially as described previously69.\n\t\nAnesthetize rats with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg), remove the ribcage and expose the chest for free access to the heart69.\nPlace the needle in the apex of the left heart valve, and cut the vena cava. Administer phosphate buffer solution (PBS, ~ 180 ml) followed by a phosphate-buffered fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde (~ 180 ml).\nEnsure that the animal actually is being perfused correctly by examining whether liquid is leaving other cavities, such as the nose, mouth, and genital areas. Note: Proper fixation with paraformaldehyde will be accompanied by large muscle movements. If this does not occur, re-adjust the needle until this reaction occurs.\nRemove the brain from the skull quickly by cutting fur and skin away from the skull. Use rongeurs to crack and remove the bone from the brain moving from rear to front. Work initially in the area below and behind the cerebellum, ensuring that the rongeur is between the bone and meningeal pia mater. Once the top and sides of the skull are removed, use a small spatula to lift the brain from the base, and snip cranial nerves with small scissors. Be careful not to damage the brain while attempting to remove the bone.",
    "Fix the brains in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C. Place the brains in a 30% sucrose/70% PBS solution at room temperature until they settle at the bottom of the container.\nBlock the brain\n\t\nRemove the rostral part of the brain cutting transversely caudal to the olfactory bulb.\nRemove the caudal part of the brain cutting transversely at the level of the cerebellum and the pons.\nMount the brain coronally with the caudal part fixed to the stage of a sliding microtome, and cut coronal sections (40 µm) through the mPFC (+2.86 – +2.20 mm rostral to bregma), the NAC core and shell and dorsal striatum (+1.76 – +1.60 mm rostral to bregma), the AMY (-2.12 – -2.92 mm caudal to bregma), and the VTA (-5.20 – -5.60 mm caudal to bregma). Use a rat brain atlas70 for guidance.\nCollect free-floating sections into individual wells of a 24-well plate filled with PBS for eventual immunohistochemical analysis71. Use Parafilm to seal the 24 well plate to make sure the PBS does not evaporate in the container and dry up the brain. Store the brain tissue in 4 °C.\n4. c-fos Procedures (Adapted from 71)\nTreat each section with 5 ml of 5% Normal Goat Serum and 0.2% Triton x-100 in PBS for 1 hr.\nIncubate the treated sections with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-c-fos, 1:5,000) at 4 °C for 36 hr in wells containing 1 ml of PBS.\nRinse sections 3x with PBS (5 ml) for 10 min each.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit; 1:200) at RT for 2 hr in wells containing 1 ml of PBS.\nRinse each section 3x in PBS (5 ml) for 10 min each.",
    "Incubate the rinsed sections for 2 hr in a commercially available avidin-horseradish peroxidase mixture that comes in a kit composed of Avadin DH (100 µl) and Biotinylated Horseradish Peroxidase H (100 µl) in 5 ml of PBS.\nRe-rinse the sections 3x in PBS (5 ml) for 10 min each.\nReact the sections with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) in the presence of 0.0015% H2O2 for 5 - 10 min, depending on the reactivity of the tissue in wells containing 5 ml of the DAB solution.\nDouble-label the VTA sections. Incubate them with a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (rabbit anti-rat TH, 1:2,000) in PBS (5 ml) overnight at 4 °C.\nRinse sections 3x in PBS (5 ml) for 10 min each.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit; 1:200) in PBS (5 ml) at room temperature for 2 hr.\nRinse sections 3x in PBS (5 ml) for 10 min each.\nVisualize the antibodies by using a secondary antibody-peroxidase complex. React with a combination of 0.05% DAB and a 0.3% nickel sulfate solution, for 5 - 10 min, depending on the reaction of the tissue in wells containing 5 ml of the DAB/NiCl solution.\nEnsure that the DAB solution is milky light green in color from its reaction with the 0.3% nickel sulfate. If the solution is too green, then the reaction will be too dark.\nMount all sections onto gelatin-coated slides. Let them dry overnight, and then cover-slip with a few drops of a Toluene-Based Solution (TBS).\nCode slides so that the experimental condition is unknown to the observers.\n5. Determination of c-fos Immunoreactive Counts",
    "Assign pairs of unbiased observers to count Fos-positive neurons in these regions of interest (ROI): prelimbic mPFC, infralimbic mPFC, NAC core, NAC shell, basolateral AMY nuclei, central-cortico-medial AMY, dorsal striatum, and VTA. Delineate whether c-Fos immunoreactivity was present in TH+ and TH- cells in the VTA. Figure 1 provides a screen-captured picture of the NAC from the microscope.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53897/53897fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative Section of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAC) Displaying Regions of Interest Outlined by the Grid by which c-fos Counts are Made. The NAC shell is found medially and ventrally to the NAC core. The NAC core encircles the anterior commissure (Anterior Comm.). The ventral extent of the lateral ventricle (Lateral Vent.) is visible.

Bring the ROI into focus and click the screen to establish a reference point. Then trace the chosen brain region using the grid as a guide. Once the trace is completed, count cells (steps 5.3.1.1 - 5.3.1.3).\n\t\t\nDouble-click the software icon. Go to the menu bar, click on \"Acquisition\" and then \"Live Image\". Bring the ROI into focus and click the screen to establish a reference point.\nGo to the grid toolbar and click \"Display Grid\" and \"Use grid labels\". Outline the ROI with a predetermined trace.",
    "Count all cells in each ROI area, select a \"+\" in the left hand sidebar to keep count of c-fos cells. Click each cell singly to register counts. Consider a cell positive for c-fos when a defined dark red circle is observed (Figure 1).\nRepeat this process for each site.\nRecord counts in a lab notebook and on the computer for future analysis. Go to the menu bar, click on \"File\", \"Save Data File\" to save the tracing and counts.\nEnsure that inter-rater reliability (using correlation of counts) of the two uninformed raters for each section in each ROI always exceeds 0.8.\n6. Statistics\nEvaluate baseline saccharin intakes over the first four days using a repeated-measures 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the saccharin intakes of Days 1, 2, 3 and 469.\nCompare saccharin intake (Day 4) with test intakes (Day 5) of the six groups using a randomized-block 2-way ANOVA69.\nUse Tukey comparisons (p < 0.05) to determine individual significant effects69.\nDetermine inter-rater reliability, and then use a common observer's counts.\nAverage c-fos counts for the three representative slices for each site69.\n\t\nPerform a 1-way ANOVA of c-fos activation induced by intake of the six solutions (3.5% corn oil, 8% glucose, 8% fructose, 0.2% flavored saccharin, xanthan gum control and water) for the perilimbic mPFC69.\nRepeat parallel analyses of the six groups for infralimbic mPFC, NAC core, NAC shell, basolateral AMY, central-cortico-medial AMY, VTA and dorsal striatum. Use Tukey comparisons (p < 0.05) to reveal individual significant effects69.\nCompare corn oil intake with both water intake and intake of its suspension agent, xanthan gum. Compare fructose and glucose intakes with both water intake and intake of the non-nutritive sweetener, saccharin.",
    "Establish whether significant relationships between solution intakes and c-fos activation in each of the sites were observed using Bonferroni r correlations (p < 0.05).\n\t\nSystematically compare c-fos counts in the perilimbic and infralimbic pre-frontal cortex for each animal in the 3.5% corn oil group.\nRepeat systematically parallel analyses of each pair of the six sites (VTA, dorsal striatum, infralimbic mPFC, perilimbic mPFC, NAC core, NAC shell, basolateral AMY, central-cortico-medial AMY) for the 3.5% corn oil.\nRepeat systematically parallel analyses of these six sites for the other five experimental intake conditions (8% glucose, 8% fructose, 0.2% flavored saccharin, xanthan gum control and water).\nTake advantage of the fact that the same animals within a solution condition were evaluated across all sites by determining significant relationships between c-fos activation across solutions and within each solution using Bonferroni r correlations (p < 0.05).\nSubscription Required.
