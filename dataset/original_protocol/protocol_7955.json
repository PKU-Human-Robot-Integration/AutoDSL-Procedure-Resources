    "All experiments were approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal use and care were in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. All the materials required to carry out this procedure are listed in the Table of Materials. Wear powder-free gloves while performing each step. For steps 6 and 7, also refer to the official microscope operating manual.\n1. Preparation of the animals\nEuthanize the experimental mice in accordance with applicable Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol (anesthesia with a combination of Ketamine 60 mg/kg and Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mg/kg followed by cervical dislocation was used here). Immediately proceed to stabilizing the animal on a platform for dissection and heart perfusion.\n\tNOTE: Experimental animals are chosen based on the design of individual study.\nDissect the abdomen and thorax to expose the heart. Perform cardiac perfusion by transfusing the heart via a 27 G needle placed in the left ventricle and create a small (~1 mm) incision in the right atrium to allow egress of blood24.\n\t\nFirst, transfuse 30–50 mL of ice-cold phosphate balanced saline solution (PBS) and then, 30–50 mL of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nTo check for a successful PFA transfusion, check for visible muscle twitches throughout the body and tail. Proceed to the enucleation step.\n2. Eyeball enucleation and fixation\nUse a curved jeweler’s forceps to gently push over the upper or lower eyelid to force the eyeball out of its socket. Use another set of jeweler’s or similar forceps to puncture the conjunctiva from the side and hold the globe from the optic nerve side. Slowly lift the globe from its socket until it is severed from the optic nerve.",
    "Transfer the globe to a tube containing freshly prepared ice-cold 4% PFA. Label the tube accordingly. Allow the globe to remain in 4% PFA in a 4 °C fridge for 12 h (overnight).\n\tNOTE: Use a plastic transfer pipette with a cut tip to transfer the globe. Widen the opening of the cut tip with a second pipette tip to avoid damaging the sample with sharp edges.\n3. Dissection of the sample (Figure 1 and Figure 2)\nUnder a stereomicroscope, locate the cornea-sclera junction (Figure 1A) and, use the sharp cutting tip of a 30 G needle to make a very superficial cut at the sclera approximately 0.5–1 mm behind the cornea-sclera junction (Figure 1B).\nAdvance one of the blades of a sharp tip dissecting scissors through the incision that was just made into the potential space between the sclera/choroid/RPE and the retina (Figure 1C). Advance the scissors and cut circumferentially until the sclera/choroid/RPE can be peeled off from the outer surface of the retina (Figure 1D,E).\n\tNOTE: It is important to perform this step slowly and gently to avoid puncturing the retina. The first few cuts are particularly critical to avoid cutting through retina.\nIf needed, make radial relaxing cuts on the sclera/choroid/RPE to facilitate the process of circumferential cutting and the subsequent peeling of the optic nerve and sclera/choroid/RPE. Remove small patches of RPE (Figure 1F) using a size 1 painting brush soaked in PBS.\nTransfer the whole intact eyeball to a tube containing PBS. Proceed immediately to the next step or preserve in 4 ˚C for immunolabeling.",
    "NOTE: Marks may be placed on the eyeball after enucleation and then, after dissection to preserve the orientation of the eye if needed. The protocol may be paused here, and the samples may be preserved overnight in a 4 °C fridge before proceeding to the next steps.\n4. Vascular staining\nPermeabilize the tissue by immersing it in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 at room temperature for 20 min.\nWash the sample with PBS 3 times on a shaker for 10 min.\nIncubate the sample with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h.\nIncubate with the primary antibody at 4 ˚C overnight. Here, an anti-mouse Collagen IV antibody was used (final concentration was prepared in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20).\nWash 3 times with PBS, for 5 min per wash.\nIncubate the sample with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies. Here, an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 was used for 12 h at 4 ˚C (1:200 dilution in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20).\nWash with PBS 3 times, for 1 h each, and then proceed with tissue clearing steps.\n5. Optical clearing with 2,2′-thiodiethanol (TDE)\nPrepare working TDE concentrations using stock TDE solution with PBS for a final concentration of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% volume to volume (v/v). Prepare at least 2 mL of solution for each eye sample to allow enough excess volume to penetrate the tissue.\nIncubate the samples in a 6 or 12 well plate well at increasing concentration of TDE. Start by immersing the intact whole eyeballs in 10% TDE solution for 2–4 h on a shaker at room temperature. Successively, transfer the sample to a higher TDE concentration for 2–4 h in each TDE concentration (Figure 2C).",
    "NOTE: Retina starts to clear at concentrations of 40%–50%, but maximum clearing occurs after incubation in a 60% solution. Retina becomes less transparent at concentrations of 70% and higher (Figure 2D).\nStop the clearing process overnight, if needed, at any of the successive clearing exchange steps.\n6. Whole eye imaging using a light sheet microscopy\nMount the intact whole eye samples considering the configuration of the light sheet microscope platform being used. Follow the microscope and acquisition software instructions to set up acquisition parameters including light sheet alignment and the illumination and detection of optical paths.\n\tNOTE: The samples used in this experiment were glued from the cornea side to the tip of a hypodermic needle on an insulin syringe (Figure 2E). The sample was then suspended inside the microscope chamber.\nFill the microscope chamber with 60% TDE as clearing solution.\nImmerse the sample within the light sheet microscope chamber in 60% TDE solution (the final clearing concentration).\nImage the cleared eye by means of a variety of commercial or custom-built confocal and light sheet microscopes. In this protocol, a dual-side illumination light sheet microscope is used.\nUse low resolution and low magnification imaging (5x, NA 0.16) to image cellular morphology and cellular process tracing especially when combined with tiling. Use high resolution and magnification imaging (20x, NA 1.0) to image both cellular morphology and large sub-cellular organelles such as nuclei and mitochondrial clusters.\n7. Post-acquisition image processing\nNOTE: Post-acquisition processing depends on the type of file and software compatible with the imaged files.",
    "Apply deblurring or deconvolution to further augment the raw images prior to stitching the imaged tiles. A Weiner filter can be applied to deblur the images. Alternatively, images can be iteratively deconvolved after denoising with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and a theoretical or experimentally measured PSF using modelling tools such as the ImageJ PSF generator plugin25.\nPerform the stitching of pre-processed z-stacks and an affine and non-rigid volume transformations followed by multi-view volume registration and fusion using a variety of commercial or public-domain software packages (ImageJ – BigStitcher plugin)26.\nSubscription Required.
