    "70S ribosome purification Streak Staphylococcus aureus’ RN6390 cells on a blood agar plate and grow at 37 °C for 20 h.Inoculate a single colony in 50 mL of sterile BHI medium in a 250 mL flask and grow for 17 h at 37 °C and 180 rpm.Add 5 mL of overnight culture to four 2 L flasks, each filled with 500 mL of sterile BHI medium, and grow for 3 h at 37 °C and 180 rpm until OD600 = 1.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the pellet in 50 mL of buffer A.Collect the pellet by centrifugation at 4,400 × g for 15 min.Repeat the previous steps (5–6) two times.Weigh cells and keep at -80 °C.Note: The typical yield is 2.8 g of cells from 2 L of culture. Thaw the cells (2.8 g) on ice for 15–20 min and resuspend in 6.25 mL of buffer A supplemented with 0.7 mg lysostaphin, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5, and 6 µl DNase I per 1 gram of cell weight. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Spin down the lysate at 21,500 × g (JA-25.50 rotor) for 90 min at 4 °C.Adjust the PEG20K concentration in the collected supernatant to 2.8% and leave the reaction on ice under agitation for 5 min.Collect the supernatant by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min (JA-25.50 rotor).Increase the PEG20K concentration to 4.2% and leave the reaction on ice under agitation for an additional 10 min.Collect the supernatant by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min (JA-25.50 rotor).Resuspend each pellet in 17.",
    "5 mL buffer A with 1 mM EDTA, lay on a 25 mL sucrose cushion (buffer B), and spin at 235,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C (Type 45 Ti rotor).Rinse the walls of each tube with 5 mL of buffer E to remove excess sucrose and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of buffer E.Lay the obtained sample on twelve 7%–30% sucrose gradients and spin at 83,000 × g for 16.5 h (SW28 rotor).Fractionate sucrose gradients (Figure 1A-I), pool fraction of 70S, and adjust the magnesium acetate to 25 mM and PEG20K to 4.5%. Leave on ice under agitation for 10 min.Pellet down the ribosomes by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 13 min (JA-25.50 rotor) (Khusainov et al., 2016).Wash the tube walls with the dissociation buffer to remove the excess of sucrose and PEG. Resuspend the pellet in 1.5 mL of dissociation buffer.Note: The usual yield is 14 mg of 70S with at least 95% purity. Check the purity of 70S by 15% polyacrylamide gel (Figure 1A-II) and by mass-spectrometry analysis (Figure 1A-III).30S subunit purification Load 14 mg of 70S in the dissociation buffer directly on 0%–30% sucrose gradients equilibrated in the same buffer and spin at 109,000 × g for 14.5 h (SW28 rotor).Fractionate the sucrose gradients (Figure 1B-I) and adjust the magnesium acetate of pooled fractions to 10 mM and spermidine to 2.5 mM.Concentrate the 30S sample to 2–3 mg/mL in the Amicon ultra centrifugal filter.Note: By using two filters in parallel, it takes 1 h to concentrate the sample.Make aliquots, flash freeze them in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.Note: The volume of the aliquots should not be less than 3 μL to prevent evaporation of the sample.",
    "Moreover, the size of the aliquots should be small (3–5 μL), as a large amount of sample is not required for subsequent experiments. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4532/bioprotoc-12-20-4532-g001.jpgFigure 1. The 30S ribosomal subunits purification. The 30S (B) were obtained from 70S (A) by running through sucrose gradients twice (I and IV, 35 mL is the total volume of sucrose gradients). The bold blue line represents the fraction used for further experiments. Both 70S and 30S fractions were run on SDS-PAGE to check the purity of the samples (II and V). 70S ribosome was sent to mass spectrometry analysis to assess the sample purity (III). 16S was obtained from 30S by phenol/chloroform extraction and run on agarose gel in denaturing conditions to represent its integrity (VI).spa mRNA purification The plasmid used in this study was previously described in Benito et al.
