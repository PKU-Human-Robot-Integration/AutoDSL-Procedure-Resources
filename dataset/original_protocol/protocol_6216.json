    "Preparation of Bacillus subtilis competent cellsStreak B. subtilis cells onto LB-agar plate.Incubate the plate at 37 °C overnight (O/N) or room temperature (RT) for 2-3 days.Using a sterile toothpick of wood, inoculate 5 ml of GM1 with a single colony from the O/N plate in a 50-ml flask and incubate the culture O/N without aeration at 30 °C.Dilute the overgrown culture in 15 ml of GM1 to reach an OD560 of 0.05.Divide the culture into two parts: 100-ml flask containing 10 ml of culture to measure the OD560 and 50-ml flask containing 5 ml to freeze the cells. The division of the culture in two flasks is recommended to avoid the contamination of the culture that it will be frozen. The possible contamination might occur due to the multiple OD560 measurements.Incubate the cultures at 37 °C in an incubator for flasks at 250 rpm. Two hours later start measurements (from the 100-ml flask for measurements) at OD560 every 30 min. Plot the data in a semi-log paper to predict the point of inflection between the exponential phase of growth and the stationary phase (OD560 of approximately 1).One hour after having reached the point of inflection in the growth curve, cells have become competent. At this point, there are two options (always use the 5 ml culture from the 50-ml flask that does not stop shaking): transform the cells (see Step B3) or freeze the cells to use them else when. To freeze the cells, add glycerol (20% final concentration) and, as soon as possible, divide the culture into 1 ml aliquots in 2-ml tubes and put them on dry ice. Keep the tubes at -80 °C.Note: This section of the protocol is an adaptation of the previously described methods by Dubnau et al., 1973 and Alonso et al., 1988.",
    "Bacillus subtilis chromosomal transformation (see Figure 1B)Add the frozen cells (1 ml) into 10 ml GM2 medium (see Recipes) in a 100-ml flask.Incubate the culture for 1.5-2 h at 37 °C with shaking speed as aforementioned.Transfer 1 ml of competent cells to 2-ml tubes:One tube without DNA (negative control) (“Tube [-]”).One tube containing 1,000 ng of rpoB482 DNAs (pCB980-1056) (see Table 1 and Figure 1A) (“Tube [+]”). DNA concentration should be measured using a Nanodrop.Table 1. Plasmid-borne rpoB482 variants from different Bacillus species or subspecies cloned into E. coli pUC57 vector. The house-keeping rpoB gene encodes the essential β subunit of RNA polymerase. A single C to T transition at codon 482 (position 1446) in the rpoB gene confers resistance to rifampicin (RifR) (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002). This mutation was introduced in the rpoB region of the indicated Bacillus species or subspecies leading to the rpoB482 mutant variants for selection of the RifR transformants (see Figure 1A). Homologous regions at 5′- and 3′-ends of the different rpoB482 genes were selected to eliminate variants in the PCR amplification efficiencies. The 2,997-bp segment of the different rpoB482 genes was in vitro synthesized and cloned into Escherichia coli 2,710-bp pUC57 vector (Ampicillin resistance). The accuracy of the in vitro synthesized DNAs was confirmed by nucleotide sequence (GeneWiz, London, UK).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190816/20190816004428_8268.jpgIncubate the tubes at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking in a heating block at 250 rpm.Serial dilutions and plating.Note: Depending on the rpoB482 DNAs (see Table 1) and the mutant competent cells used, preliminary experiments should be performed to determine the range of dilutions required for plating.",
    "For plating the total number of cells, create 1:10 serial dilutions of the “Tube (-)” (negative control without DNA, see Step B3a) to a 10-5 dilution in LB, and plate 100 μl of desired dilutions onto LB-agar plates using glass beads.For plating the transformants (see Figure 1C), create 1:10 serial dilutions of the “Tube (+)” (with DNA, see Step B3b) to a 10-2 dilution in LB and plate 100 μl of desired dilutions onto LB-agar plates supplemented with rifampicin (8 μg/ml) using glass beads.Note: When the chromosomal transformation efficiency is impaired, 100 and 101 dilutions could be necessary. In this case, harvest cells by centrifugation for 3 min at 900 x g at room temperature (RT). There should be a visible pellet at the bottom of the microfuge tube. Resuspend cells in 100 μl LB and plate the whole volume onto LB-agar plates supplemented with rifampicin (8 μg/ml) using glass beads. For plating the spontaneous rifampicin resistant (RifR) cells, plate the “Tube (-)” (negative control without DNA, see Step B3a) at the same dilution as the most concentrated dilution of transformants (see Step B5b) onto LB-agar plates supplemented with rifampicin (8 μg/ml) using glass beads.Incubate plates at 37 °C overnight, or leave at RT for 2-3 days.Count colonies on the most appropriate plate (the one that contains around 100-1000 colonies). The colonies on each plate must be multiplied by their dilution factor to obtain colony forming units (CFUs)/ml.Note: In order to reduce the variability between different experiments, count 100-500 CFUs per plate from the proper dilution. PCR amplification of rpoB482 DNA from the RifR transformants (see Figure 1C)Lyse the transformant cellsPick up a single colony with a sterile toothpick and insert it into a 1.",
    "5 ml tube containing 20 μl ddH2O and incubate the tube for 5 min at 95 °C.Note: It is necessary to amplify by PCR and send for sequencing several examples (several single colonies) resulted from the transformation with each DNA. This is because the recombination point can vary (from one to another) so that the end points and the length of integration also varies. Finally, we determine the length of integration as the average of lengths from different examples of each condition. Centrifuge for 5 min at 20,000 x g at RT.Use 2 μl of supernatant per PCR reaction as DNA template.Perform a PCR 20 μl per reaction.Set up the PCR, by adding the following component into a PCR tube on ice:DNase-free ddH2O 11.5 μldNTP mix (2.5 μM each) 2 μlForward primer (10 μM) (see Table 2) 2 μlReverse primer (10 μM) (see Table 2) 1 μlPCR buffer (10x) 2 μlTaq DNA polymerase (250 Units) 2 μlSupernatant lysates (DNA template) 2 μlTable 2. Primers. These primers hybridize with the region upstream and downstream of the 2,997-bp rpoB482 DNAs. These primers are used in this protocol for amplifying and sequencing rpoB482 genes from the RifR transformants.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190816/20190816004804_3364.jpgRun PCR:table:",

    "Load 2 μl of PCR products on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1x TAE stained with EtBr. Run the gel in 1x TAE buffer at 5 to 8 V/Cm for 1 h at RT (bands expected of 2,997 bp).

Bacillus subtilis natural chromosomal transformation and detection of mean integration. A. Distribution of sequence divergence among different Bacillus species. A single C-to-T transition mutation at codon 482 (indicated with an asterisk) in the essential rpoB gene renders the rpoB482 gene, which confers rifampicin-resistant (RifR). The rpoB482 DNA was derived from B. subtilis 168 (Bsu 168), B. subtilis W23 (Bsu W23), B. atrophaeus 1942 (Bat 1942), B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7 (Bam DSM7), B. licheniformis DSM13 (Bli DSM13), B. gobiensis FJAT-4402 (Bgo FJAT4402), B. thuringiensis MC28 (Bth MC28) and B. smithii DSM4512 (Bsm DSM4216). Mismatches between RifR donor and the corresponding rpoB in the rifampicin sensitive recipient strain are indicated by vertical red bars, and insertions/deletions by vertical black bars. Bar thickness represents the number of mismatches in a particular area. B. Chromosomal transformation. RecA-mediated homeologous recombination between the rpoB482 donor DNAs (in red) and the recipient rpoB gene (in black). C. Measurement of the length of the integrated donor DNA into the recipient. PCR amplification of the RifR transformants using DNA primers hybridizing upstream and downstream the rpoB gene (blue arrows). The mean length detection between the first predicted and the first observed mismatch define the end-points region.SequencingSend for sequencing each PCR product mixed with Forward and/or Reverse primer (see Table 2) (following the instructions of the company).",
    "Computational analysisRun two different nucleotide BLASTs:BLAST-1 (see Figure 2A): to visualize the bases that are not aligned (defined here as mismatches) between the RifR donor DNAs (see Table 1) and the corresponding rpoB in the rifampicin sensitive recipient strain, run a nucleotide BLAST using each of the rpoB482 variants sequences (donor DNAs) (see Table 1) as query sequence against the house-keeping rpoB gene sequence (recipient DNA) as subject sequence.Note: The presence or the absence of the mismatches between the donor and the recipient DNA will be used to determine the overall integration length. BLAST-2 (see Figure 2B): to visualize the bases from the RifR transformants with donor DNA origin, run a nucleotide BLAST using the house-keeping rpoB gene sequence (recipient DNA) as query sequence against each of the RifR transformants sequences (see Procedure D) as subject sequences.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190816/20190816005006_2471.jpgFigure 2. Analysis of the integrated sequences and measurement of the integration length. A. Schematic representation of the BLAST-1 using rpoB482 donor DNA (with different Bacillus origins) (red line) as query sequence against the house-keeping rpoB gene sequence (recipient DNA) (black line) as subject sequence. Black dotted lines indicate the “First mismatches predicted”. B. Schematic representation of the BLAST-2 using the house-keeping rpoB gene sequence (recipient DNA) (black line) as query sequence against the PCR product got from the RifR transformants DNA (blue line) as subject. Black dotted lines indicated the “First mismatches observed”. End-points are defined as the average region between the first predicted and first observed mismatches and represent the recombination points. The integration length is calculated as the subtraction between both end-points. Black dots represent DNA bases and blue vertical lines represent the bases that are aligned between both sequences. The mutation that confers resistant to rifampicin is represented with an asterisk."
