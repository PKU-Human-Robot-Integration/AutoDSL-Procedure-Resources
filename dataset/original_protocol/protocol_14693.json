    "All animals are treated in accordance with the Guide of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 2013 Edition, the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Northwestern University.\nNote: The following procedure can be done entirely with one operator; however, it is much more efficiently conducted with two operators with the tasks split accordingly.\n1. Prepare Laser and Pre-laser Station\nPosition the laser and slit lamp where it can be easily accessible. Turn on laser and set to pre-determined parameters (e.g. 75 µm spot size, 100 mW power, 100 msec duration).\n\tCAUTION: Ensure operator wears all animal and laser safety personal protective equipment and pertinent laser safety signs are displayed outside of the procedure room.\n\t\nBefore using any experimental animals, find ideal parameters using a calibration, non-experimental mouse. Laser parameters will depend on the laser used. Ideal parameters are defined by the lowest laser power setting that consistently causes “bubble” formation when properly focused. See video for example of lesion with proper “bubble” formation.\nPrepare the pre-laser station so that anesthesia, animal warmer, tissue wipes, and all eye drops (Tropicamide, Tetracaine, and artificial tears) are easily within reach to operator.\n\t\nEnsure that animal warmer is pre-heated to correct temperature (37 °C) before injecting anesthetic into first mouse in order to avoid anesthesia-induced hypothermia.\nPlace mouse stage on warmer so it can retain heat and remain warm once laser procedure begins.\n2. Mouse Anesthesia and Pre-laser Preparation\nBefore injecting anesthesia, inspect the eye macroscopically to ensure it has no deformities or abnormalities that diminish corneal clarity (e.g. cataract).\nWeigh mouse.\nRecord weight, sex, and animal ID number.",
    "Using weight, calculate appropriate amount of anesthetic to be used based on guidelines given by institution (e.g. 100 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride, 10 mg/kg xylazine OR tribromoethanol 250 mg/kg; for a 20 g mouse inject 0.20 ml xylazine/ketamine cocktail OR 0.25 ml of tribromoethanol). Have a table of pre-calculated dosages per weight in increments of 1 g in order to reduce mathematical errors.\nScruff mouse and inject anesthetic intraperitoneally based on calculations in step 2.4.\nPlace mouse on animal warmer and wait until mouse is completely anesthetized by checking the pedal reflex via toe pinch (approximately 3-5 min).\nRoll up a tissue wipe and protect the mouse’s nasal area to prevent aspiration of liquid roll-off. Roll mouse on its side and place a drop (approximately 30 µl) of tetracaine hydrochloride into each eye for topical anesthesia. Wait 2 min for solution to take effect.\nRepeat step 2.7 with one drop of topical Tropicamide for pupillary dilation. Alternatively, use phenylephrine hydrochloride (2.5%) for dilation.\nWait 2 min for solutions to take effect; keep animal on warmer during this time.\nAfter appropriate time has elapsed, quickly place the mouse on the mouse stage and place the stage on chin rest of slit lamp.\nTurn on slit lamp to the lowest light brightness and check the degree of pupillary dilation. If pupil is not adequately dilated (approximately 2.5-3 mm), return mouse to animal warmer and wait. Alternatively, administer another drop of Tropicamide. Once eye is sufficiently dilated, proceed to laser procedure.\n3. Laser Procedure\nNote: Ensure other persons in the room wear protective goggles when away from laser-protected slit lamp eye-piece\nAdjust the placement of mouse on the mouse-stage, so that it is ideally positioned for visualization of optic nerve (see 3.1.2).",
    "Orient the mouse on its holder so it lies horizontally, perpendicular to slit lamp beam, with the head at one side and tail at the other. Ideal mouse placement will make optic nerve visualization much easier once cover slip is applied.\nSlightly turn the mouse so it is at a ~170° angle with the head closer to laser operator.\nEnsure that mouse is as close as possible to slit lamp, yet still in a position where it is stable and where the operator’s hand will have enough space for fine manipulation.\nAfter the mouse is ideally positioned, place one drop of artificial tear solution on a 25 mm x 25 mm glass coverslip.\n\t\nPlace one drop of artificial tear solution on mouse’s opposite eye – this will ensure eye is hydrated and help delay cataract formation.\nHold corner of coverslip between thumb and pointer fingers; position so that the glass is squeezed between tips of both fingers.\nGently wrap the remaining three fingers around the animal’s body for support and hand stabilization. Position hand so that the glass coverslip can be easily placed on the mouse’s eye.\n\t\nBe sure that the wrist is stabilized on a firm surface in order to reduce hand tremor.\nOnce stable position is obtained, carefully press glass coverslip (with drop of artificial tear still adhered) onto the mouse’s eye.\n\t\nMake sure the coverslip is positioned as perpendicular as possible to the laser beam in order to prevent laser beam scatter or reflection. The coverslip acts as a contact lens to flatten the cornea.\nLook through slit lamp and with free hand toggle focus until retina can be visualized. The retina will have a light-yellow/red color depending on the location visualized, distinct, red vessels will be visible.",
    "Slowly and carefully manipulate mouse head and/or coverslip until visualizing the optic nerve. The optic nerve will be yellow in color with multiple vessels radiating from it.\nOnce operator has confirmed visualization of optic nerve, turn on laser focusing beam.\nOnce laser beam has been turned on, maneuver laser focusing beam to desired position (approximately 1 disc diameter from the optic nerve).\nFocus laser beam on the RPE of the eye fundus. Proper focus is achieved by having the sharpest and clearest laser beam. If aiming beam looks oval or out of focus, toggle slit lamp focus or re-position glass coverslip.\nOnce the aiming beam is focused on RPE, initiate laser administration using the laser’s foot trigger.\n\t\nBe sure to avoid retinal vessels to prevent intraocular hemorrhage.\nWatch for the appearance of a bubble immediately after laser administration. The outline of the laser shot should be clear and not hazy in any way.\n\t\nIf the laser shot does not result in bubble formation, or area of impact looks hazy (cloudy appearance with ill-defined circular border vs. clear, sharply defined border of a successful impact), or if hemorrhage is seen after laser administration, do NOT include these lesions for future analysis.\nRepeat steps 3.10-3.12 for all desired CNV positions (usually at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock positions around optic nerve). If laser inductions are applied at approximately same distance from optic nerve, refocus should not be necessary. However, due to the strong curvature of the mouse eye and small variations that may exist in the retina, refocusing the beam may be necessary between consecutive laser administrations.",
    "Record in a notebook the location and result of each laser shot administration and result (successful, hazy, hemorrhage, etc.) of each administered shot for the eye. Be sure to place the laser in stand-by mode when not in use.\nRepeat 3.1-3.14 for the mouse’s other eye, if needed, using the opposite hand for stabilization and a new coverslip.\nAfter all desired laser shots are administered, turn off laser and slit-lamp.\nDiscard coverslip and place mouse on warmer for recovery from anesthesia. Macroscopically inspect eye for any injury and place a drop of artificial tear solution to keep the eye hydrated and potentially prevent future cataract development. Once mouse recovers from anesthesia, return to cage.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\n,AVERTIN,AVERTIN,AVERTIN,XYL/KET,XYL/KET\nMouse Weight (g),Dose (mg/kg),Solution Concentration (mg/ml),Anesthetic Dose (ml),Dose (mg/kg),Anesthetic Dose (ml)\n15,250,20,0.1875,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.15\n16,250,20,0.2,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.16\n17,250,20,0.2125,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.17\n18,250,20,0.225,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.18\n19,250,20,0.2375,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.19\n20,250,20,0.25,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.2\n21,250,20,0.2625,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.21\n22,250,20,0.275,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.22\n23,250,20,0.2875,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.23\n24,250,20,0.3,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.24\n25,250,20,0.3125,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.25\n26,250,20,0.325,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.26\n27,250,20,0.3375,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.27\n28,250,20,0.35,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.28\n29,250,20,0.3625,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.29\n30,250,20,0.375,100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine,0.3\nTable 1: XyIKet Dosage Chart.Subscription Required.
