    "All animal experiments were conducted in a humane manner. The Institutional Animal Experiment Committee of Jichi Medical University approved the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Institutional Regulation for Animal Experiment and Fundamental Guideline for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the MEXT of Japan. Mice used in this protocol have been described previously21.\n1. Hanging Box Test\nRecord the weight of each mouse. Mark the tail by marking pen for individual discrimination (e.g., a line, double lines, and triple lines).\nNOTE: Growth curves are used for an index of general health22.\nPlace the mice in the experimental room at least 30 min before the behavioral test. Set the hanging box, which consists of a clear box (25 x 25 x 40 cm3) with a rotatable mesh lid on the top (Figure 1). The mesh lid can be rotated along a central bar so that the top is flipped 180 degrees.\nPut a mouse in the center of the mesh lid. Carefully turn the mesh lid up side down.\nMeasure the fall latency (hanging time) of the mouse from the mesh lid.\nNOTE: If the mouse does not fall within 5 min, record the latency as 5 min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage. Clean the hanging box with 70% ethanol after every test.\n2. Footprint Analysis\nNOTE: Following the hanging box test, perform the footprint analysis.\nSet up the Runway (Figure 2A).\n\t\nCut a piece of white paper (29.7 cm x 42 cm x 0.09 mm) longitudinally into three lengths of equal width. Set a piece of the white paper (9.9 cm x 42 cm) on the table.",
    "Put the dark goal box at the distal end of the paper. Put other boxes (approximately the same length as that of the paper) with the walls on both sides of the runway, preventing the escape of mice.\nPut black ink and red ink into separate Petri dishes (35 mm in diameter).\nTraining session.\nNOTE: Perform the training session only at 4 weeks of age.\n\t\nPut a mouse on the proximal end of the paper (Face the head toward the goal box). Let the mouse walk from the proximal end to the goal box. Remove the mouse from the goal box. If the mouse stops on the paper, gently push the mouse to the goal box by finger.\nHold the mouse by grasping the scruff between the thumb and forefinger to limit the movement of forelimbs. Then, grasp the back and the tail between the ball of the thumb and the other fingers to limit the movement of hindlimbs.\nNOTE: Insufficient holding of a mouse results in blots of ink on clothing.\nImmerse the bottoms of forelimbs in red ink and the bottoms of hindlimbs in black ink. Immediately put the mouse on the proximal end of the paper (Face the head toward the goal box). Let the mouse walk from the proximal end to the goal box. If the mouse stops on the paper, gently push the mouse to the goal box by finger.\nRemove the mouse from the goal box. Go to the test session.\nTest Session.\nFollowing the training session, set up the runway for footprints with a new cut piece of white paper.",
    "Hold the mouse by grasping the scruff between the thumb and forefinger to limit the movement of forelimbs. Then, grasp the back and the tail between the ball of the thumb and the other fingers to limit the movement of hindlimbs.\nImmerse the bottoms of forelimbs in red ink and the bottoms of hindlimbs in black ink. Immediately put the mouse on the proximal end of the paper. Let the mouse walk from the proximal end to the goal box.\nNOTE: Because mice prefer the dark, walking becomes steadier as the mouse approaches the dark goal box. If the mouse stops on the paper, gently push the mouse to the goal box by finger. Then, if reliable footprints are not obtained for analysis (see step 2.4. Analysis of footprints for details) because the mouse stopped, retry the test session.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage from the goal box. Clean the goal box with 70% ethanol after each test session. Air-dry the foot-printed paper.\nAnalysis of footprints\nObtain three measurements of each parameter (stride lengths of forelimbs and hindlimbs, front and hind base widths, overlap between forelimb and hindlimb, Figure 2B) with a ruler from foot-printed paper.\nNOTE: Because footprints of proximal and distal ends frequently show large variations because of stopping or running, choose the part with a steady gait pattern of footprints. The middle part of the foot-printed paper will usually be suitable for the analysis.\n\t\t\nFor the stride length, measure the distances between the same parts of the paw (e.g., paw pad or toe).",
    "For the front base width, draw a line between consecutive right (or left) front footprints. Then, measure the length of the vertical line from the pad of the left (or right) front footprint to the line drawn between the right (or left) footprints.\nFor the hind base width, draw a line between consecutive right (or left) hind footprints. Then, measure the length of the vertical line from the pad of the left (or right) hind footprint to the line drawn between the right (or left) footprints.\nFor overlap, measure the distance between pads of left (or right) front and hind footprints.\nAverage the three measurements for each individual. Use the individual average of each parameter for the statistical analysis.\n\t\t\nFor the stride length, use the average of the individual averages of the left and right strides.\nFor asymmetry of stride length, use the absolute value of the difference between individual averages of left limb and right limb stride length.\nFor the statistical analysis of the other parameters (front base width, hind base width, and overlap), use the individual average directly.\n3. Restraint Stress Loading\nPreparation of Restraint Tubes. \nMake 16 holes (approximately 2 mm in diameter) in a 50 ml conical tube (30 mm in diameter x 115 mm in length) along the scale marks (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mL) and the backside of each scale mark by square drill (Figure 3). Make a hole on the tip of the 50 mL conical tube (approximately 5 mm in diameter) for breathing by cutting off the tip. Make a hole (approximately 4 mm in diameter) in the tube cap to pass the tail of mice.\nStress Loading\nPlace the mice in the experimental room.",
    "Hold a mouse by grasping the scruff between the thumb and the forefinger. Enter the mouse into the restraint tube from the head. Pass the tail through the hole in the cap. Close the cap.\nNOTE: Limit the forelimb movement, because mice reject entering the tube by the forelimbs.\nKeep the mouse enclosed for 2 h on a desk at room temperature. Remove the mouse from the restraint tube and return to the home cage.\nNOTE: The restraint tubes can be reused after a wash and dry.\n4. Experimental Schedule (Figure 4):\nPerform the hanging box test and the footprint analysis on the same day at 4 weeks of age (see step 1. Hanging box test and step 2. Footprint analysis for details) as a baseline measurement on all mice prior to the grouping into ‘stress group’ and a ‘non-stress group’.\nNOTE: About 8-10 mice in 2-3 litters may be suitable to use in an experiment. Footprint analysis at 4 weeks of age consists of training and test sessions.\nRandomly divide the mice into a ‘stress group’ and a ‘non-stress group’.\nNOTE: When the mice are used consisting of several litters, divide littermates evenly into both groups. Number in each group consists of about 4-5 mice.\nApply the restraint stress to the ‘stress group’ 6 times over the course of two weeks (see step 3. Restraint stress loading for details).\nNOTE: 6 times of restraint are applied every two weeks, followed by a hanging box test and footprint analysis from 6-12 weeks of age. Do not apply the restraint stress on the test day of the hanging box test and the footprint analysis.\nPerform the hanging box test and the test session of footprint analysis on the same day at 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age.",
