    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFibroblast preparation\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes methods to prepare and culture mouse and human fibroblasts.\nPrepare mouse and human fibroblast cells.\nTo obtain healthy and proliferative mouse fibroblast cells for reprogramming, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) are derived from 13.5-day mouse embryos or 8-weeks adult mice, respectively, according to a standard procedure.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] MEFs and TTFs are maintained in fibroblast medium and cells that have been passaged for less than 3 times are used.\nHuman foreskin fibroblast (HFF) line CRL2097 are used for reprogramming and are passaged onto the gelatin-coated dishes in fibroblast medium (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: For MEF preparation, remove head, spinal cords, and all developing organs from mouse embryos to avoid lineage precursor cell contamination.\nciCPC induction\nTiming: 15–27 days\nThis step describes the stepwise procedure to directly generate ciCPCs from mouse or human fibroblasts.\nCoat a 12-well plate with matrigel (for mouse ciCPC induction) or a 6-well plate with vitronectin (for human ciCPC induction) and place the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for at least 1 h (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCarefully remove the coating reagent and plate 10,000 (MEFs), 20,000 (TTFs), or 40,000 (HFFs) cells per well, respectively, in pre-warmed fibroblast medium.\nPlace the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for at least 8 h.\nCritical: Fibroblasts are likely to aggregate. As evenly distributed cells and appropriate cell confluence are both important for reprogramming, therefore rock the plate gently to evenly distribute fibroblast cells.\nCarefully aspirate the fibroblast medium without touching the bottom of the plate and wash with PBS twice.",
    "Add 2 mL of fresh mouse ciCPC reprogramming medium or 2.5 mL of human ciCPC reprogramming per well, respectively, which includes a combination of 6 compounds (6C) comprising CHIR99021, A83-01, GSK126, Forskolin, CTPB, and AM580 for CPC induction.\nCritical: It is important not to disturb the attached cells which may result in low reprogramming efficiency. Therefore, gently and slowly add medium along the side wall of the well and avoid adding medium directly onto the cultured cells.\nPlace the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator. Replace with fresh reprogramming medium every 2 days.\nAfter 8 (for mouse ciCPC induction) or 20 days (for human ciCPC induction) of incubation, carefully aspirate the reprogramming medium from the plates and wash with PBS twice (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nAdd 2 mL of fresh mouse or human ciCPC induction medium per well, respectively, and return the plates to the incubator.\nChange medium every 2 days.\nAfter 6 days, mouse (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) or human (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) ciCPC colonies are formed and can be picked for further expansion (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2240-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Critical: Compared to mouse ciCPC reprogramming condition, HFFs are executed to chemical-treatment for continuous 20 days due to slower growth rate and reprogramming kinetics of human fibroblasts. 6C-treating time may vary from 15–30 days for different fibroblast lines and optimal treating duration for each line may require experimental validation.\nciCPC clone picking and expansion\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step describes the methods for picking the ciCPC clones and subsequent long-term expansion of them in a chemically defined xeno-free condition.\nPick mouse or human ciCPC colonies into a 1.5 mL-tube.\nCentrifuge the picked colonies at 800 g for 3 min at 25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 0.1 mL collagenase B, and digest for 10 min at 37°C.\nQuench the enzyme by adding 0.1 mL of fresh ciCPC expansion medium and centrifuge the digested cells at 800 g for 3 min at 25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the picked colonies in 0.1 mL of accutase and digest for 5 min at 37°C.\nRepeat procedure 15. Then carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the digested cells in 0.1 mL of fresh ciCPC expansion medium and seed them into a well of a vitronectin-coated 96-well plate.\nCritical: Do not rock the plate as cells in 96-well plate tend to gather in the well center upon shaking.\nCultured ciCPCs are ready for passaging when grow to confluence. For passaging, aspirate the ciCPC expansion medium, and wash the cells twice with PBS. Add 0.1 mL collagenase B per well of 96-well plate and digest for 10 min at 37°C (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nCarefully remove collagenase B without dislodge the cells, and add 0.1 mL accutase per well of 96-well plate for 5 min at 37°C.\nQuench the enzyme by adding 0.1 mL of fresh ciCPC expansion medium into each well.",
    "Collect all undetached cells from the well and transfer them into a 15-mL tube. Then centrifuge the cells at 800 g for 3 min at 25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of fresh expansion medium. Pipette the cells up and down thoroughly.\nAdd the single-cell suspensions into the vitronectin-coated 24-well plate. Gently rock the plate to evenly distribute the ciCPCs and then place the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nFor long-term expansion, cells can be routinely passaged every 3–4 days (for mouse ciCPCs) or 4–6 day (for human ciCPCs), respectively, at a density of 5×105 cells per well of a 12 well plate. The culture medium should be changed every 2 days (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nIn this defined culture condition, mouse or human ciCPCs can long-term propagate for more than 20 or 12 passages, respectively, with stable growth rate and undifferentiated morphology maintained (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2240-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. ciCPCs are long-term expandable in fully chemically defined conditions\n(A) Morphology of P20 mouse ciCPCs.

Scale bars, 100 μm.\nPause point: Mouse and human ciCPCs can be frozen and long-term stored in liquid nitrogen.\nciCPC differentiation\nTiming: 7–14 days\nThis step describes the methods for targeted differentiation of ciCPCs into cardiomyocytes (CMs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs).\nProcedures of mouse ciCPC differentiation in vitro (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).",
    "For CM differentiation, plate accutase-dissociated mouse ciCPCs onto the vitronectin-coated plate in fresh mouse CM differentiation medium for continuous 7 days (at a density of 3×105 cells per cm2). Change medium every 2 days.\nCMs display synchronized contraction usually at days 7.\nFor SMC differentiation, suspend accutase-dissociated mouse ciCPCs with fresh SMC differentiation medium.\nAdd the suspension to the vitronectin-coated plate at a density of 1×104 cells per cm2.\nCulture for 7 days. Change medium every 2 days. Differentiated SMCs can be monitored at day 7.\nFor EC differentiation, plate accutase-dissociated mouse ciCPCs onto the vitronectin-coated plate in EGM-2 medium for continuous 7 days (at a density of 1×104 cells per cm2). Change medium every 2 days.\nDifferentiated ECs can be monitored at day 7.\nPause point: Cells can be fixed and stored in PBS at 4°C for 2–3 weeks.\nCardiac differentiation of hESCs and conditioned medium preparation.\nhESC line H1 is cultured on the vitronectin-coated plate in TeSR™-E8™ medium (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCardiac differentiation of H1 hESCs is initiated by seeding hESCs in monolayer in TeSR™-E8™ medium and allowing them to grow to 80%–90% confluence.\nSwitch to hESC CM differentiation medium and name this day as day 0. The medium should be changed daily until day 7 and every 2–3 days thereafter.\nNeeded supplements in CM differentiation medium are varied in different differentiation days. Add correct supplement at the indicated dosages and times following the recipe listed above.\nOn differentiation day 20, reseed cells onto the gelatin-coated plate in human CM culture medium.\nCollect the conditioned medium of the differentiated CMs from differentiation day 30 to day 60. Medium is harvested every 2 days.\nCritical: Split the conditioned medium into 15-mL tubes. It should be stored at −80°C until use and should be used within 2 weeks after thawing.",
    "Procedures of human ciCPC differentiation in vitro (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nFor CM differentiation, plate accutase-dissociated human ciCPCs onto the vitronectin-coated plate in fresh human ciCPC CM differentiation medium for 14 days (at a density of 3×105 cells per cm2). Culture medium is renewed every 2 days.\nProcedures of the SMC and EC differentiation from human ciCPCs are the same as the mouse ciCPCs except extending the treating time to 14 days.\nCritical: Quality of conditioned medium of hESC-derived CMs is very important for cardiac differentiation of human ciCPCs due to its paracrine factors. Use freshly thawed conditioned medium for CM differentiation of human ciCPCs.\nPause point: Cells can be fixed and stored in PBS at 4°C for 2–3 weeks."
