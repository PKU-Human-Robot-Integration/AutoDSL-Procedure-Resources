Input the name of the gene you are interested in, for example, CDKN2A.Select the gene in Search results.Select FASTA under the Genomic regions, transcripts, and products.Define the region of your sequence, by inputting the nucleotide number on the chromosome your gene is located under Change region shown on the right site of the screen. For example, from 2230356 to 22172015, for the 58 kb CDKN2A region on chromosome 9.Click Update View, and copy the sequence into word file.Obtain 35-bp fragments continuously starting from the first base of the genomic sequence for Library 1, as shown in the graphic abstract.Obtain 35-bp fragments continuously starting from base 18 for Library 2, so that these fragments will cover the break points between each of two 35-bp fragments in Library 1. For a 58 kb CDKN2A/B region, you will have 1668 35-bp fragments for both Libraries 1 and 2.List the 1668 sequences in an Excel file for each library.Construct Libraries 1 and 2, by adding the common flanking sequences to each 35-bp fragment in the Excel file, as shown in Table 1.Table 1.

    "Order Libraries 1 and 2 from commercial vendors.Note: You can order these two libraries together as two sub-libraries, by adding the common sequence AGGACCGGATCAACT on the 5’ end and CATTGCGTGAACCGA at the 3’ end. These common sequences will be served as adaptors for massive parallel oligonucleotide synthesis. Separation of library DNA for libraries 1 and 2 Upon receipt of the library DNA, resuspend the synthetic DNA Library using DNase-free water to a final concentration of 100 ng/mL, and keep it as a stock at -20°C.Dilute the synthetic DNA library with 1 μL stock using DNase-free water, to a final concentration of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 pg/μL.PCR amplify the library DNA, by using primers PE_SP (L1_FP): 5’ACACGCACGATCCGACGGTAGTGT3’ and G3 (L1_RP): 5’CGAGCTTATCGTCGTCATCC3’ for Library 1, and new_SP(L2_FP): 5’GGTGTGATGCTCGGATCCAGGAAC3’ and 926RR (L2_RP): 5’CACGAGACTACTGTCCTACC3’ for Library 2.Note: These primers were generated in our lab for different purposes and were selected among many primers tested in our pilot Reel-seq screen. These primers are all good for PCR, but some are not good for repeated amplicon amplification, and others are not good for next-generation sequencing, or library preparation. Therefore, please make sure you don’t change these primers for Reel-seq screen. Perform the PCR reaction with the T100 Thermal Cycler, as formulated in Table 2, with the PCR program listed in Table 3.Table 2.

Amplification of Libraries 1 (A) and 2 (B). A 5% Acrylamide gel showing a 79-bp band containing library DNA was amplified by PCR with different concentrations of library DNA, as indicated.Place each sliced gel band (~3 × 5 mm in size) into 150 μL of 10% TE buffer in a microtube, and shake at RT overnight.Collect ~120 μL of liquid containing the library DNA. At this point, you should have one tube for each library with purified library DNA.Put the tube with the cap open in the Thermo Scientific Savant DNA 120 SpeedVac Concentrator, which is a vacuum centrifuge.Concentrate the library DNA, by turning on the centrifuge first, and then the vacuum.Normalize the DNA samples to 10 ng/μL, as measured with the Implen C40 NanoPhotometer UV/Vis Spectrophotometer Mobile System.Preparation of library DNA for Reel-seq screen PCR amplify the library DNA for Libraries 1 and 2 obtained from Procedure B.",
    "Prepare the PCR reaction as formulated in Table 2, by using 5 μL of purified library DNA (~10 ng/μL), and run the PCR reaction according to the program listed in Table 3, except that only 15 cycles are required.Amplify each library DNA in triplicate, so that you will have enough DNA for the Reel-seq screen.Run 5 μL of PCR product from each reaction on a 5% Mini-PROTEAN® TBE Gel, as described in Procedure B (steps 6–10), to check the quality of PCR amplification. You should observe one major band around 79-bp, with all the reactions having relatively the same amount of DNA.The amplified library DNA for Libraries 1 and 2 is now ready for the Reel-seq screen.Isolation of nuclear extract (NE) Culture ~1.5 × 108 primary human arterial ECs with ERG-2 medium in 150-mm plates in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2.Wash the cells three times using DPBS.Scrape the cells in 5 mL of DPBS with 1× Roche cOmplete mini protease inhibitor cocktail.Collect the cells by centrifuging at 450 g for 5 min, using the Clinical Benchtop IVD Centrifuge.Isolate the NE using NE-PERTM Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that only half volume of Nuclear Extraction Reagent (NER) is used to extract NE. This will yield NE with a concentration of ~10 μg/μL.Use Roche cOmplete mini protease inhibitor cocktail to prevent protein degradation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Divide the NE in ~20 μL aliquots, and store it at -80°C for at least one year.Note: Cell culture conditions and media will be dependent on the cell line you use to isolate NE.

The amplified library DNAs are now ready for the next round of Reel-seq screen. Also, in general, applying positive controls for Reel-seq screen is a good idea. When we performed this Reel-seq, we did not have any positive controls. This is because no cis-REs had ever been identified in the 58-kb CDKN2A/B region we screened. However, one can always use cis-REs from other regions of the human genome as positive controls, if one can make sure that these cis-REs function in the cells you use for your Reel-seq screen. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4397/bioprotoc-12-08-4397-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "Preparation of a next-generation sequencing library using two PCR reactions Select the Reel-seq PCR products from rounds 1, 4, 7, and 10, to prepare the next-generation sequencing library. As each round has three controls and three samples, a total of 24 sub-libraries will be generated for each library.Using 1 μL of the Reel-seq PCR product for each control and sample, perform the first PCR reaction according to Table 6.

The sequences of all these primers are listed in Table 8.Note: We selected PCR products from rounds 1, 4, 7, and 10 for sequencing, based on the capacity of next-generation sequencing, the number of DNA fragments in the Reel-seq library, a 30–50% mutation rate introduced by PCR in the Reel-seq screen, and the cost of sequencing.

In total, 48 R2 primers with 48 different barcodes are needed for amplifying 48 sub-libraries.Note: L2 and R2 primers contain adaptor sequences p5 and p7 (underlined in Table 8). Adaptors allow the sequencing library to bind and generate clusters on the flow cell for illumina sequencing. The design and the sequence of these primers with barcodes were described in Kozarena and Tuner (2011). Check the quality of the second PCR reaction, by running 5 μL of PCR product on 2% agarose gel with 2 μL of Gel Loading Dye. A relatively even band at 188 bp should be observed across all the reactions (Figure 5C and D).Mix the second PCR products according to Table 11. You will have 186 μL of secondary PCR product mixture for each library.Table 11. Mix PCR product for sequencing library purification table:\n﻿Round,Control (μL),Sample (μL)\n1,1,1\n4,3,5\n7,5,10\n10,7,30",
    "Note: We chose the volumes mentioned in the Table 11 based on our experience. PCR can generate mutations, and more mutations are generated by PCR with library DNA treated with NE. Therefore, we used these numbers to obtain relatively even sequencing reads (free of mutation) for each library. Purify the mixed PCR product, by using a 5% Mini-PROTEAN® TBE Gel for each library, as described in Procedure B (steps 6–14). Each 186 μL of library DNA should be evenly distributed into 9 wells, with one well left for the marker.Cut the band at 188-bp, place each sliced gel into 150 μL of 10% TE buffer, and isolate the sequencing library by shaking at RT overnight.Concentrate the DNA Library to ~50 ng/μL with the SpeedVac Concentrator.Send both sequencing libraries to the core facility for next-generation sequencing. Use the PE_SP primer for Library 1, and the new_SP primer for Library 2.Sequence both Libraries 1 and 2 together, using NextSeq 500 with 75-bp single read high output, at 2.5 pM with 1% PhiX spiked in.Notes:  As a part of sequencing, you should request for data analysis to list the reads for each 35-bp fragment in all 24 sub-libraries, for both Libraries 1 and 2. Next generation sequencing was performed at the Genomics Research Core at University of Pittsburgh (https://www.genetics.pitt.edu/next-generation-sequencing[href=https://www.genetics.pitt.edu/next-generation-sequencing]).The actual platform you use for next generation sequencing depends on the size of your library. A small library can be sequenced by MySeq; therefore, talk to a sequencing expert to determine the actual sequencing platform you want to use."
