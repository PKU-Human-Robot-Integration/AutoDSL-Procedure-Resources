  "procedures": [
    "This study was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals established by the Ethic Committee for Animal Experimentation of the University of Amsterdam in full compliance to the national legislation on animal research following the European directive 2010/63/EU for the use of animals for scientific purposes (ALC312).\n1. Isolation of fetal small intestinal organoids\nSacrifice the E18-E20 fetuses by decapitation with surgical scissors, according to the approved ethical regulations.\nImmediately after euthanasia, carefully cut open the lower abdomen of the fetus with intestinal scissors and remove the whole intestine.\n\tNOTE: Isolation must be performed with intestines between E18 and E20 of gestation in order to achieve the proper suckling-to-weaning transition and maturation in vitro.\nWith two small forceps, stretch the intestine. Using the stomach and the appendix as guides, cut apart the proximal and distal part of the small intestine.\n\tNOTE: If dissection is done carefully, it is possible to isolate the colon as well. Cut it apart using appendix as guide (Figure 1).\nMake the intestine open longitudinally: fix the intestine using a razor blade placed lengthwise and pull the intestine by sliding forceps (one arm of the forceps on each side of the razor blade) along the razor blade. Subsequently, cut the opened intestine in 1 cm pieces.\nPrepare two 50 mL tubes with 10 mL of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Transfer the proximal and distal part of the small intestine (and the colon if applicable) separately to the tubes. Keep the tubes on ice while dissecting the intestines of additional mice. Collect all intestinal parts of one litter together in the same tube.",
    "NOTE: One litter has usually 6-10 fetuses. The intestines of all fetuses must be combined. This amount should be enough to yield 4-8 wells with organoids, in a 48-well plate, per intestinal part.\nProceed with organoid isolation as previously described11. In short, wash intestinal pieces with ice-cold PBS, incubate with 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 30 minutes at 4 °C, dissociate the crypts from the tissue by harshly washing the pieces with ice cold PBS + 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), filter using a 70 µm cell strainer and centrifuge to collect the crypts at 150 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPlate 4 to 8 wells with crypts in extracellular matrix gel, depending on the pellet size, in a warm 48-well plate. Use 20 µL of crypts suspended in extracellular matrix gel per well. Let extracellular matrix gel solidify in a 37 °C incubator for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Considering that only 40% to 50% of isolated crypts form organoids, aim for a density of 250 to 300 organoids per well. First add less extracellular matrix gel than needed. Look under the microscope after platting the first well to analyze whether the density of the isolated crypts is ideal. If necessary, add more extracellular matrix gel.\nIn the meantime prepare ENR medium: 14 mL of Advanced Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Ham’s F-12 (DMEM/F12) 1:1 +++ (supplemented with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) 1x, L-glutamine 0.01 M and 0.2U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin), 4 mL of Noggin-conditioned media, 2 mL of Rspondin-conditioned media, 400 µL of B27 supplement 1x, 200 µL of N2 supplement 1x, 50 µL of 1.25 mM n-Acetylcysteine, 20 µL of 0.05 µg/mL Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF).\n\tNOTE: When culturing colon organoids, supplement with 50% Wnt conditioned media.\nAdd 250 µL of ENR medium per well.\n2. Culturing of fetal organoids",
    "Change medium of the cultures 3 times per week. Maturation of the organoids is achieved after 1 month of culture.\nAt day 3 after each passage, count the number of spheroids and organoids using an optical microscope. Quantify at least 3 wells per condition and all the organoids present in each well.\n\tNOTE: Number of spheroids reduces with time, while the number of organoids increases (Figure 2).\nPassage the organoids once a week by mechanical dissociation as described below.\n\t\nRemove medium and add 1 mL of ice-cold Advanced DMEM/F12 1:1 +++. Collect all extracellular matrix gel with organoids into a 15 mL tube. Use a 200 µL tip on top of a 1000 µL filter tip and pipette up and down 20 times to disrupt the organoids.\nCentrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 µL of extracellular matrix gel per well. Usually, fetal organoids can be expanded in a 1:2 ratio.\nLet extracellular matrix gel solidify for 5-10 min. Add 250 µL of ENR medium per well.\n3. Maturation analysis at RNA and protein level\nAnalyze culture every 3 days after each passage, for a period of 1 month (i.e., time in which complete maturation is achieved) (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Fetal organoid culture is dynamic (Movie 1) and to avoid variation from the normal regeneration of organoids after mechanical disruption, it is necessary to always collect samples at the same day after passage.\nRNA isolation\nCollect 3 wells of organoids using 200 µL of RNA lysis buffer for each well supplemented with 2 µL of β-mercaptoethanol. After adding RNA lysis buffer+β-mercaptoethanol to the well, make sure all extracellular matrix gel with organoids is transferred to a RNase-free 1.5mL tube.",
    "Vortex vigorously and keep at -80 °C for no longer than 1 month. Isolate RNA using commercially available silica spin column kits.\nTo increase RNA quality, after washing steps add 500 µL of 80% EtOH and gently mix by inverting the column. Centrifuge for 2 min at 11,000 x g to dry the column completely.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to wash the inside of the lid of the tube with the 80% EtOH by flicking the tube upside down three to five times to get rid of all traces of guanidine thiocyanate.\nTo increase RNA yield, wait 1-2 min after applying RNase-free water before centrifuge. Re-elute RNA by applying the first flow-through eluate to the column a second time.\n\t\tNOTE: Isolated RNA quality is sufficient for use in genome-wide expression analysis. Check whether RNA integrity number is above 8.\nProtein isolation\nCollect 5 wells of organoids using 250 µL of ice-cold cell recovery solution into one 15 mL tube. Incubate for at least 30 min on ice to dissolve the extracellular matrix gel (this will reduce protein contribution from extracellular matrix gel).\nWash with ice-cold PBS. Add 250 µL of cell lysis buffer and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: After sonication, samples can be used to detect enzyme activity or for Western Blots.\nImmunostaining\nCollect 2 wells of organoids using 250 µL of ice-cold cell recovery solution into a 15 mL tube. Incubate for at least 30 min on ice to dissolve the extracellular matrix gel (this will reduce staining background). Wash with ice-cold PBS.\nFix the organoids using 500 µL of of 4% paraformaldegyde (PFA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Wash with ice-cold PBS. Proceed to whole-organoid immunofluorescence or to paraffin embedding, according to published protocols12.",
    "NOTE: Use a plastic Pasteur pipette to handle the organoids. This will avoid disruption of its structure.\n4. Effect of extrinsic factor (dexamethasone as an example) on organoid maturation process\nOn day one of culture, add 0.01M dexamethasone to the organoids. Incubate the organoids with dexamethasone during the whole month of culture by adding new dexamethasone every time medium is changed.\nGene expression analysis\nIsolate RNA as described above. Synthesize, at the same time, cDNA of all samples to be compared (treated and untreated). Proceed with preferred qRTPCR method.\nUse GeNorm to identify the two most stable reference gene every time a new treatment is used on the fetal organoids. Use the geometric mean of the two chosen reference genes for relative expression calculations.\n\t\tNOTE: Suggestions of reference genes to test for mouse fetal organoids: Cyclophilin, Gapdh, βactin, 36b4, Hprt, Rpl4, Rpl32, Ppib and Tbp.\nTo investigate how a certain extrinsic factor affects postnatal mouse fetal maturation, all the following genes should be evaluated.\n\t\t\nCheck whether fetal markers lactase (Lct), argininosuccinate synthase 1 (Ass1), B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) decrease in expression during the first two weeks of culture and are absent for the remaining culture time (Figure 4C). Analyze whether this pattern is altered.\nCheck whether adult markers sucrase-isomaltase (Sis), arginase 2 (Arg2), trehalase (Treh) and lysozyme (Lyz) increase in expression after two weeks of culture (Figure 4D). Analyze whether this pattern is altered by the external factor.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Dexamethasone is an external factor that can accelerate the maturation of the fetal organoids and can be used as a positive control in all experiments aimed to test other extrinsic factors.\nEnzyme activity analysis\nIsolate protein as described above. Detect intestinal disaccharidases activity according to protocols published by Dahlqvist and Messer13,14.",
    "Prepare 0.625 M maleic-buffer pH 6.0 (keep for 3 months at 4 °C). Using this buffer, prepare 0.05 M lactose (add p-hydroxymercuribenzoate sodium as stabilizer to inhibit lysosomal p-galactosidase activity); 0.05 M maltose; 0.05 M sucrose and 0.05 M trehalose.\n\t\tNOTE: All these solutions can be kept for 5 days at 4 °C. Keep on ice while preparing assay.\nPrepare assay standards by diluting 5.56 M glucose solution with ultrapure water to obtain solutions with the following concentrations: 0.125 M; 0.1 M; 0.075 M; 0.05 M and 0.025 M.\n\t\tNOTE: solution stable for at least 3 months at 4 °C.\nIncubate in a 96-well plate for 60 min at 37 °C:\n\t\t- 30 µL of organoid lysate with 30µL of lactose\n\t\t- 30 µL of organoid lysate with 30µL of sucrose\n\t\t- 30 µL of ten times diluted organoid lysate with 30 µL of maltose\n\t\t- 30 µL of five times diluted organoid lysate with 30 µL of trehalase\n\t\t- 30 µL of undiluted organoid lysate with 30 µL of maleic acid, as sample background\n\t\t- 30 µL of each glucose standard\n\t\t- 30 µL of ultrapure water, as blank\n\t\t- 30 µL of positive control (optimize dilution; lysed fetal intestinal tissue can be used as control for lactase activity while lysed adult intestinal tissue can be used as control for sucrase, maltase and trehalase)\n\t\tNOTE: Dilution of samples should be made with cell lysis buffer. Keep the samples and plate on ice while preparing the assay.\nTo determine the amount of glucose produced by the enzymes present in the organoid lysate after incubation with their respective substrates, add quickly 200 µL of PGO-color solution and measure absorbance at 450 nm every 5 min for 30 min at 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: Make PGO-color solution fresh. Use 10 U/mL glucose-oxidase, 2 U/mL peroxidase and 7.88 mmol/L o-dianisidine in 0.5mol/L Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.0. Solution should be at room temperature when added to the plate.\nCalculate activity according to glucose standard and correct for total amount of protein (determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)). Enzyme activity should be expressed as µM glucose/µg protein·min-1 (Figure 5B).\n\t\tNOTE: Measure arginase activity using a commercially available arginase activity assay kit."
