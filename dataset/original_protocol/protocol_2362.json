    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRNA ribodepletion and sample concentration\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, we remove the ribosomal RNA in the total RNA sample.\nFor cell line and fresh-frozen tissue samples, purify total RNA with Trizol or spin-column based extraction kits. Use tissue homogenizer when necessary.\nTo detect mRNA m6A modification, extract mRNA with Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit. To detect whole-transcriptome wide m6A modification, deplete ribosomal RNA with RiboMinus Eukaryote System v2. Then purify the longer (>200 nt) RNA using RNA Clean & Concentrator-5. The concentration of RNA was measured by Qubit™ RNA HS Assay Kit.\nLibrary preparation\nTiming: 2 days total\nTiming: 5-6 h for step 3\nTiming: 7-8 h for step 4\nTiming: 15-16 h for step 5\nIn this section, we convert m6A into a6m6A, perform the cyclization, reverse transcription, and construct the library.\nRemove poly A and ligate adapters. The library construction strategy was modified from m1A-MAP approach (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nAnneal 30–100 ng poly A+ RNA or ribo- RNA (300 ng to 1 μg total RNA) with oligo-dT, digest the hybrid with RNase H (NEB), followed by DNase I (NEB) to remove oligo-dT and purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator (RCC) Kits (Zymo Research).\nPurify the RNA and fragment the RNA by sonication using Bioruptor® Plus sonication device (Diagenode) or NEBNext® Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module, and the program is 30 s on/off, 30 cycles to ∼ 150 nt. End-repair the RNA with PNK enzyme (NEB) at 37°C for 30 min to expose the 3′ hydroxyl group.\nAdd 0.6% calibration spike-in mix in the reaction. Ligate the RNA fragment with 3′ adapter (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) using T4 RNA ligase2, truncated KQ (NEB) at 25°C for 2 h.",
    "Digest the excessive RNA adaptor by adding 1 μL of 5′ Deadenylase (NEB) into the ligation mix followed by incubation at 30°C for 1 h. Then add 1 μL of RecJf (NEB), incubating at 37°C for another 1 h. Add 1 μL of RT primer (50 μM), anneal at 75°C for 5 min, 37°C for 15 min, and 25°C for 15 min.\nPause point: The ligated RNA could be stored at −80°C for at least one month.\nCritical: Poly A tail acts as competitor of m6A sites for MjDim1 Methyltransferase and Allyl-SAM cofactor. We add poly A elimination step with RNase H.\nLabel m6A sites and perform reverse transcription. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nAdd 15 μL of dynabeads C1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the reaction to purify the 3′ adapter-ligated RNA. Wash the beads, resuspend the beads in 6 μL of H2O, and denature the RNA at 70°C for 30 s and cooled in ice to eliminate secondary structure.\nPerform the m6A enzymatic labeling on beads. Add 2 μL of 10 × MjDim1 reaction buffer (400 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mM NH4Cl, 40 mM MgCl2,), 2 μL of SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 6 μL of Allylic SAM, and 4 μL of MjDim1 enzyme (1.6 mM) in the reaction and incubate at 50°C for 1 h.\nRemove the supernatant, then add 4 μL of H2O, 1 μL of 10 × MjDim1 reaction buffer, 1 μL of RNase inhibitor, 2 μL of allylic SAM, and 2 μL of MjDim1 enzyme in the reaction and incubate at 50°C for 20 min.\nRepeat step c for 6 times to thoroughly label the most m6A sites.",
    "Wash the beads and resuspend the beads in 25 μL of H2O. Add 1 μL of 125 mM I2 in the reaction and mix thoroughly. Keep the reaction in dark at 25°C for 1 h, then add 1 μL of 40 mM Na2S2SO3 to quench I2.\nCritical: I2 should be kept in darkness. The dynabeads C1 would reduce some of the I2, do not reduce the concentration of I2.\nWash the beads and resuspend the beads in 9 μL of H2O. Add 10 × RT buffer (SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix from Thermo Fisher Scientific) 2 μL, 10 mM dNTP 2 μL, 25 mM MgCl2 2 μL, 0.1 M DTT 1.25 μL, RNaseOUT 2 μL, and HIV-RT enzyme (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) 2 μL in the tube to perform reverse transcription (RT) at 37°C for 3 h. (For Input RT 1 h with 1 μL of enzyme is sufficient). Then wash the beads and resuspend the beads with 8 μL of H2O.\nCritical: Do not replace HIV-RT enzyme (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) with other reverse transcriptase, as they might stop at the N1, N6-ethanoadenine and N1, N6-propanoadenine (the derivates of a6m6A after treatment with I2) sites.\nLigate cDNA 3′ adapter, construct library.\nAdd 1 μL of 10 × RNase H buffer, 1 μL of RNase H into the resuspended RT product, put the reaction into thermocycler (Bio-Rad) at 37°C for 30 min. Wash the beads and resuspend the beads in 50 μL of H2O. Boil the beads at 95°C for 10 min to elute the cDNA.\nPurify the cDNA by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) to remove short adapters and elute the RNA with 10 μL H2O.\nPause point: The purified cDNA could be stored at −20°C for at least one month.",
    "Add 2 μL of 10 × T4 RNA ligase buffer, 2 μL of 10 mM ATP, 10 μL of 50% PEG8000, 1 μL of cDNA 3′adapter (50 μM) (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and 1 μL of T4 RNA ligase 1 was added into the eluted cDNA and the ligation was performed at 25°C for 12 h. The reaction was purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) and eluted with 21 μL of H2O.\nPause point: The ligated cDNA could be stored at −20°C for at least one month.\nUse 1 μL of supernatant for qPCR test and the remaining 15 μL for library construction. Use NEBNext® Ultra™ II Q5® Master Mix and NEBNext adaptors for the library amplification. Set up the qPCR reaction and parameters as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1997_6.csv\nNote: Set the PCR program as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1997_7.csv\nCalculate the ΔCt value of amplification and determine the optimal cycle number for library construction (Choose the cycle that is in the middle of the s-shape curve and before the exponential amplification curve reaching the plateau).\nConstruct libraries. Set up the PCR reaction and parameters as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1997_8.csv\nNote: Set the PCR program as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1997_9.csv\nPurify the amplified libraries with 0.8 × Ampure beads.\nEquilibrate the AMPure XP beads to 25°C for 30 min. Add 50 μL nuclease free H2O into the PCR tube to make a final volume of 100 μL. Add 80 μL (0.8 ×) AMPure XP beads to each PCR mixture. Mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times with the pipette set at 90 μL. Incubate at 25°C for 5 min.\nPlace the beads on a magnetic rack for 5 min. Decant the beads.",
    "Add 200 μL freshly prepared 80% EtOH to the beads without mixing them. Incubate at 25°C for at least 30 s. Decant the beads. Repeat the wash for another time.\nCritical: Use freshly prepared 80% EtOH. Do not disturb the beads.\nAspirate the remaining EtOH and air dry for 2–5 min.\nCritical: Do not over-dry the beads. If the beads crack, the recovery rate would be much lower.\nAdd 23 μL of RNase-free H2O. Mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times and incubate at 25°C for 5 min. Place the beads on a magnetic rack for 5 min.\nTransfer 21–22 μL of the eluate (there might be 1–2 μL dead volume) to a new 1.5 mL tube. Use 1 μL of supernatant for concentration measurement.\nMeasure the concentration of the libraries by Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS kit.\nCheck the quality of the purified libraries by 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument.\nPause point: The purified libraries could be stored at −20°C for at least one month.\nSend the libraries for NGS deep sequencing. Sequence the libraries on NovaSeq 6000 System Ten with paired-end 2 × 150 bp read length.\nBioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data\nTiming: 11–14 days total\nTiming: 10–15 h for step 6\nTiming: 1–2 days for step 7\nTiming: 3–4 days for step 8\nTiming: 4–5 days for step 9\nTiming: 10–20 h for step 10\nIn this section, we analyze the data and identify bona fide RNA m6A sites.\nPreparing and quality control of raw sequence data.",
    "Firstly, we suggest the available memory of computer is more than 128 GB, and number of threads is more than 16. Download our perl, R, and Bash Shell scripts used below from GitHub https://github.com/CTLife/m6A-SAC-seq[href=https://github.com/CTLife/m6A-SAC-seq]. Download the Human hg38 reference genome and transcriptome files from the UCSC Genome Browser (https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/[href=https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/]) and the ncbiRefSeq GTF file from https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables[href=https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables]. Use these files to build index for the aligner STAR:\n> STAR --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeFastaFils hg38.genome.fa --genomeDir hg38 --sjdbGTFfile hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf\nThe scripts recognize paired-end FASTQ files by their suffixes automatically. Therefore, the two FASTQ files of each paired-end sequencing sample must be tagged by “R1″ and “R2″ respectively. Put all the raw FASTQ files into a same folder “1-rawFASTQ” and rename them, let their suffixes be “. R1.fastq.gz” or “. R2.fastq.gz”. For more details, please see “perl m6A-SAC-seq_1.pl -help”.\nBefore preprocessing, we should check adapter content, Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] duplication level, Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] and genome contamination Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] to decide whether it is necessary to generate more reads or redo the experiment. Then check the quality of the raw FASTQ files by FASTQC, fastp, and FASTQ_screen, all of them were integrated as a script:\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_1.pl -in 1-rawFASTQ\nCritical: ‘--sjdbGTFfile hg38. ncbiRefSeq.gtf’ should be indicated for better mapping reads with lots of mutation.\nLinear regression for m6A fraction and mutation rate.\nTo correlate observed mutation rates and m6A fractions of the spike-in sequences in each motif, extract the spike-ins from raw FASTQ files:\n> perl spikeins.pl -in 1-rawFASTQ -out Spikeins\n> perl spikeins_RC.pl -in 1-rawFASTQ -out Spikeins_RC\nThen, we can pool the results from same group together or detect mutation rates of spike-ins for each sample. Mutation rates and linear correlations of adenines (A) for each motif can be generated by:\n> Rscript linear_correlations.sh",
    "Linear regression models were used: y=ax + b. Where y is the observed mutation rate and x is the m6A fraction. In the file “spikeins.fit.txt” from results, the first column is one of 256 5-mer motifs, the second column is the value of a, and the third column is the value of b.\nCritical: Pool the spike-ins from same group together to increase the reliability of linear regression.\nPreprocessing and mapping.\nRemove adaptors and bases with low quality by using Trimmomatic. This step with quality statistics was implemented by one script:\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_2.pl -in 1-rawFASTQ -out 2-removedAdapters\nThen adapter-free reads with barcodes will be removed PCR duplicates by using the clumpify.sh in BBMap:\n> clumpify.sh in=end1 in2=end2 out=output_end1 out2=output_end2 -Xmx60g reorder=f dedupes=t subs=0\nCritical: ‘-Xmx60g’ indicates that this step is memory consumption.\nCritical: ‘dedupes=t subs=0’ parameters will keep only one of the duplicates with same barcode and sequence.\nThis step with quality statistics was implemented by one script:\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_3.pl -in 2-removedAdapters -out 3-removedDups\nFor using the variant detection tool VarScan, we need to separate stranded reads into plus-strand and minus-strand reads in further analysis. Therefore, we convert paired-end reads into single-end reads by reformat.sh in BBMap before mapping. If we use other tools to call mutation, this step is not required. One script with quality statistics was implemented (Optional):\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_4.pl -in 3-removedDups -out 4-finalFASTQ\nRemove barcodes and map reads to the reference genome using STAR:\n> STAR --runMode alignReads --clip3pNbases 6 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --outSAMmultNmax 1 --outMultimapperOrder Random --outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.1 --outFilterMismatchNmax 999 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 –outFileNamePrefix ouput --genomeDir STAR_index --readFilesIn input_end1 input_end2\nThis step with quality statistics, and detecting gene expression with Salmon or Kallisto were implemented by one script:\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_5.pl -genome hg38 -mis 0.1 -in 4-finalFASTQ\n-out 5-rawBAM",
    "Critical: ‘--outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.1’ allows more mismatches of the reads with mutation.\nRemove reads with low MAPQ, or on unplaced and unlocalized contigs (Optional):\n> perl m6A-SAC-seq_6.pl -genome hg38 -in 5-rawBAM -out 6-finalBAM\nMutation calling and m6A sites identification.\nSplit each BAM file into two files, plus strand and minus strand (Optional):\n> perl split_strand.pl -in 6-rawBAM -out callVariants\nCall mutations for each BAM file by SAMtools and VarScan:\n> samtools mpileup --fasta-ref hg38.genome. fa --output name.pileup name.bam\n> java -jar VarScan.jar somatic SAC-seq.pileup backfround.pileup outDir\nIdentify m6A sites from the outputs from VarScan. Most m6A sites were found in conserved motif DRACH (D = G/A/U, R = G/A, H = A/U/C), only a few sites located at non-DRACH motifs. So, we classified all the m6A sites into two categories: DRACH and nonDRACH. These several steps can be done by:\n> perl identify.pl -in inputDir -backgound 0.05 -p 0.05 -diff 0.1 -cov 10\nCritical: ‘-backgound 0.05 -p 0.05 -diff 0.1 -cov 10’ indicates the thresholds of maximum background mutation rate, p-value, minimum mutation rate (background was removed), and coverage. These values should be changed based on your sequencing depth and species of samples.\nQuality control of the identified m6A sites.\nSome figures can be used to assess the quality, reliability, and features of the identified m6A sites:\n> perl figures.pl -in inputDir -out outDir\nCritical: The genomic distribution and metagene profile of DRACH sites must be in line with expectations. Otherwise, the m6A sites could not be used to further analysis."
