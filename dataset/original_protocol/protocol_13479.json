    "This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The patients signed informed consent, and the patients consented to film and allowed the investigators to use their surgical data. A total of 40 patients were included in this study.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nSelect patients based on the following inclusion criteria: i) patients who need surgical treatment due to trauma to the odontoid process of the axis, ii) patients operated by the same surgeon, and iii) cervical MRI images that show no degeneration and obvious edema of the cervical spinal cord.\nEnsure the following exclusion criteria while selecting patients: i) patients with spinal ankylosis, tumors, and other diseases, ii) combined atlantoaxial joint transverse ligament injury, and iii) severe bleeding tendency or coagulation disorder.\nHave the patients undergo a routine preoperative examination after admission. Ensure that the patients are accompanied by a doctor to perform imaging examinations, including the anterior and lateral X-ray of the cervical spine, X-ray with mouth open, atlantoaxial CT examination, and the patient's cervical spine MRI.\nMake it routine for patients to undergo cranial traction (traction weight 2-5 kg) before the operation.\n\t\nKeep horizontal maintenance traction (traction weight of 2 kg) for patients with no obvious displacement of odontoid fractures.\nFor those with posterior displacement of the odontoid fractures, perform horizontal traction first, and then increase the traction weight according to the reset situation. After the X-ray shows complete reduction of the fracture end, reduce the traction weight to 2 kg.",
    "Review the patients' bedside X-ray films every 2 days. Have the surgeons adjust the position and traction weight according to the displacement of the odontoid process. After the fracture reaches full reduction, perform surgery to fix the fracture. Ensure that the patients have fasted for 12 h before surgery and that the surgical site is well prepared. Take the 20 cm area around the surgical incision as the skin preparation area. Use a razor to remove hair from the skin preparation area.\n2. Surgical procedures\nPlace the patient in a supine position on the operating table. Sedate the patient by intravenous administration of propofol, rocuronium bromide, sufentanil, and midazolid at dosages of 2 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, 0.4 µg/kg, and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively.\nAfter the patient loses consciousness, perform endotracheal intubation.\n\t\nHave the anesthesiologist prop up the patient's occiput properly and tilt the head back.\nAfter the patient has inhaled pressurized, pure oxygen through a mask for 3-5 min, have the anesthesiologist open the patient's mouth with the right thumb, forefinger, and middle finger. Hold the laryngoscope with the left hand to expose the glottis and then pass the catheter through the mouth in an arc through the glottis and into the pharynx and trachea with the right hand.\nPlace the tooth pad, take out the laryngoscope, inflate the cuff, and then auscultate both lungs. After confirming the position of the catheter, fix the catheter and the tooth pad with adhesive tape, and connect the ventilator for respiratory support.\nTake an X-ray before the start of surgery to ensure that the odontoid is in reduction.",
    "Perform routine disinfection and draping to the surgical incision site (the right side of the upper edge of the C4-5). Use 2% iodine to sterilize the surgical incision 3x and use 75% alcohol for deiodination and alcohol disinfection 3x. Disinfect up to the lower lip, down to the nipple, and both sides to the front edge of the trapezius muscle. During the drape laying process, take care to move the drape only from the inside to the outside.\nUse a scalpel to make a 4-5 cm transverse incision on the right side at the upper edge of C4-5. Cut the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma in sequence, and use high-frequency electrocautery to stop the bleeding. Instruct the assistant to use tissue forceps to separate the upper and lower platysma muscle to facilitate retraction and blunt separation of the vascular sheath and visceral sheath. Use the skin retractor to retract to both sides to expose the prevertebral fascia and longus neck muscle and peel it off with a periosteal peeler to separate the prevertebral fascia.\nSecure the inside of the O-arm workflow with a sterile cloth. Move the O-arm to the surgical site. After turning on the O-arm intraoperative imaging system, perform a 3D scan of the surgical site to determine the C2-3 space.\nAfter the C2-3 segment is confirmed, tilt the O-arm 45° to make room for surgery. Use a rongeur to remove a small amount of the labial bone at the lower edge of the C2 vertebra.",
    "Under O-arm fluoroscopy, place a 1.5 mm diameter guide wire in the middle of the lower border of the C2 vertebral body. Keep the guidewire in the midsagittal position of the odontoid and tilt it back 15-20°. Under the supervision of the O-arm, drill the guide wire to the tip of the odontoid. Use a hollow drill to create a nail channel along the guide wire and a hollow tap to shape a thread channel.\nAfter the guide needle reaches the top of the odontoid, measure the length of the guide wire entering the vertebral body and wait for the surgeon to screw in a 3.5 mm diameter, hollow titanium screw of a suitable length along the guide needle.\nAfter screw placement, perform 3D scanning again with the O-arm to observe the screw implantation in all directions and carefully withdraw the guide needle.\nFully rinse the wound and perform indwelling drainage. Use a No. 10 thread wire to fix the drainage tube. Suture the platysma muscle with the No. 10 thread, the fascia between the platysma and the skin with the No. 4 thread, and the skin intradermally with the No. 0 thread.\n3. Post-surgery\nAdminister antibiotics to the patients for 3 days after the operation. Pull the drainage out 3 days after the operation.\nInstruct the patients to start walking on the ground while wearing a cervical collar and use the cervical collar continuously for 3 months.\nSubscription Required.
