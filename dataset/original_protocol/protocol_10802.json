During this time period, perform 5 consecutive rounds of vacuum degassing and flushing with argon every hour.\nFlush the flask with argon for 10 seconds and disconnect it from the vacuum manifold. Place the flask inside the glove box.\nLeave the flask open in the glove box overnight with vigorous agitation.\n2. Removing Oxygen from the Stopped-flow System\nPrepare 1 L of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Pour 125 mL of this buffer into a 250-mL Büchner flask and perform steps 1.2-1.4.\nWeigh out 5 mg glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (181300 U/g) and 0.9 g glucose using a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and 50 mL Falcon conical tube, respectively. Place both containers into the glove box.\nDissolve glucose oxidase and glucose in 50 mL of anaerobic 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (final concentrations of 18.13 U/mL and 100 mM, respectively). Fill the reservoir syringes with this solution (Figure 1).\nEnsure that the drive valves are in the \"load\" position and fill the drive syringes (Figure 1). Turn the F valve to the \"drive\" position. Empty the stop syringe by clicking on Empty in the Pro-Data control software. Push the buffer from drive syringe F through the flow circuit by manually raising the corresponding drive ram. Repeat this step ten times in total. Perform the same procedure with the other three drive syringes. Wait one hour.",
    "Replace the solution of the reservoir syringes with the same buffer containing glucose oxidase and glucose. Repeat step 2.4.\nRepeat step 2.5 and allow the solution to stand in the flow system overnight.\nAfter overnight incubation, repeat step 2.5.\n3. Preparation of Oxygen Saturated Buffer\nPrepare 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and pour 50 mL into a 50-mL vial with a stir bar. Cap the vial with a Wheaton stopper and a Wheaton aluminum seal.\nPlace the vial on ice. Immerse a long needle connected to a tank containing 100% oxygen into the solution.

Place the vial on ice inside the glove box.\n6. Reductive Half-reaction: Monitoring Flavin Reduction\nPrepare the stopped-flow instrument and the Pro-Data control software for single mixing mode following the manufacturer's protocol.\nTurn on a circulating water bath (15 °C). Remove oxygen from the water by bubbling nitrogen through it for 20 minutes. This prevents the oxygen contamination through the flow circuit.\nMaintain the temperature of the drive syringes and the observation cell at 15 °C by connecting the water bath housing of the stopped-flow to the circulating bath.\nIn the Control Panel window of the Pro-Data control software select Photodiode Array, External trigger (to activate stopped-flow operation), and Logarithmic scale.\nLaunch the Pro-Data viewer software and define the directory where the data files will be stored.\nReplace the solution of reservoir syringes C and F with anaerobic 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).

Push the buffer from both drive syringes through the flow circuit by manually raising the corresponding drive ram five times in total (click Empty before each movement of the ram).\nIn order to ensure that glucose oxidase has been removed completely from the flow circuit, perform step 6.6 four times in total.\nClick on Baseline in the Pro-Data control software.",
    "Mix 100 μL of enzyme stock solution with 1100 μL of anaerobic 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (final concentration after mixing in the stopped flow of 15 μM).\nReplace the solution of reservoir syringe F with the enzyme solution. Turn the F valve to the \"drive\" position. Empty the stop syringe by clicking Empty in the Pro-Data control software.

This yields spectra of the oxidized form of the enzyme.\nReplace the solution of reservoir syringe B with an NADPH solution 1.5-fold more concentrated than the enzyme solution in syringe A. Turn the B valve to the \"drive\" position and empty and refill the stop syringe three times as described in 7.7.",
    "Replace the solution of reservoir syringe C with oxygenated buffer. Turn the C valve to the \"drive\" position and empty and refill the stop syringe three times as described in 7.7. In the Pro-Data control software, set the delay and acquisition time at 15 and 900 s, respectively.\nRepeat step 7.8. This yields spectra during the reoxidation of the fully reduced enzyme.\n8. Data Analysis\nLaunch the Pro-Data converter software. Click on the Options icon and select Save in ProDataCSV.\nOpen the directory where the data files were stored. Drag the files to the APL Pro-Data converter window. The data will be saved automatically as CSV format files in the same directory.\nOpen the CSV format files using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Normalize the baseline of the stopped-flow traces by subtracting the corresponding absorption at 700 nm.\nAnalyze the corrected traces using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) by fitting the plot of the absorbance at the corresponding maximum versus time to the appropriate exponential function. As shown in Figure 2B, the absorbance at 452 nm was plotted as a function of time in order to determine the rate of flavin reduction after mixing the enzyme and NADPH in the stopped-flow instrument. In this case, the best fit of the data was obtained using a double exponential equation and rates of 0.65 and 0.23 s-1 were calculated for the first and second phase of the reduction, respectively. To determine the rate of formation of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate and the reoxidation after reacting the reduced enzyme with oxygen, we analyzed the stopped-flow traces at 380 and 452 nm, respectively (Figure 3B). Using a single exponential equation, we calculated rates of 1.4 and 0.006 s-1 for the first and second step of the oxidative half-reaction, respectively.\n9. Representative Results",
    "The results from the experiments described in the previous sections show how the reductive half-reaction of Af SidA can be monitored by measuring the changes in the absorbance at 452 nm, which correspond to the changes in the redox state of the flavin. The rate of this step can be determined by fitting the data to the appropriate equation (Figure 2; Step 8.4). The reduction rate obtained (0.65 s-1) is similar to the kcat value calculated with steady-state experiments2, suggesting that the reduction is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Taking advantage of the double mixing mode of the stopped-flow, the rate of oxidation and the intermediates in this half-reaction can be determined (Figure 3; Step 8.4). In the reaction catalyzed by Af SidA, the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin is clearly detected (λmax of 380 nm), and the rate of formation and decay can be calculated. The slow rate of the reoxidation obtained (0.006 s-1) indicates that the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin is very stable in absence the ornithine.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3803/3803scheme1.jpg\nScheme 1. Mechanism of Af SidA. The isoallozaxine ring of the FAD cofactor is shown. The oxidized flavin (A) binds to NADPH (B) and reacts to form reduced flavin and NADP+ (C). After reaction with molecular oxygen and binding of ornithine, the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin is formed (D). This is the hydroxylating species. After hydroxylation of ornithine, the hydroxyflavin (E) must be dehydrated to form the oxidized enzyme. NADP+ remains bound throughout the catalytic cycle and is the last product to be released (F).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3803/3803fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The stopped-flow instrument.
