    "This protocol describes a recommended process for collecting pure phloem sap from rice plants (Oryza sativa L.; Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0001]). The Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique (Tjallingii, 1978[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-bib-0031], 1985[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-bib-0032]) is used to monitor the feeding behavior of the aphids. When the aphids show phloem activities—salivation followed by passive phloem sap ingestion—the stylets of the aphids are amputated by RFM stylectomy (Downing & Unwin, 1977[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-bib-0009]). Sap containing pure SEs is collected as it exudes from the stump of aphid stylets. The samples are analyzed by TEM and NTA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e79f1601-73b9-4036-8374-8ec0a6a13eda/cpz1903-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nOverview of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-prot-0001].

    "200-µl microtubes (Bio-Rad)\nRice and barley plants growth\n1. Germinate 10 rice seeds (O. sativa cv. Sendra) in Petri dishes and transplant the plantlets into small pots (8 × 8 cm) with a mixture of soil and vermiculite. Maintain the plants in an insect-free walk-in environmental growth chamber under controlled conditions of temperature [24:20°C day:night (D:N)], relative humidity (80% RH), and photoperiod [16:8 hr light:darkness (L:D)].\n2. Germinate 30 barley seeds in pots (13 cm in diameter) under the same conditions as described above.\n3. Water seeds and plantlets three times a week using a fertilizer (dose of 0.25 g/L) rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (20:20:20).\n4. Grow rice plants up to phenological stage of seed development, when they are used to obtain pure phloem sap by stylectomy.\n5. Grow barley plants to be used to rear and maintain the aphid colonies.\nAphid culture\n6. Establish cultures of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, which are reared on barley plants and maintained in growth chambers with a 70% RH at 23:18°C and 14:10 hr photoperiod (L:D).\nThe aphid's colony must be grown in good conditions. Not too many insects (∼15 aphids on a pot with 30 barley plants) should be used, in order to obtain aphids of a good size. If we use small aphids, the amputation of the stylets becomes more complicated.\n7. Use only one adult apterous aphid (9-10 days old) to collect phloem sap from each rice plant as described below.\nPhloem sap collection from rice plants: Aphid stylectomy by radiofrequency microcautery\n8. Immobilize an adult aphid with a suction device. Attach a gold wire to the dorsum of the aphid using water-based silver glue. Attach the other end of the gold wire to a copper wire and connect to the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) device.",
    "9. Place the aphid on the primary branch of a rice panicle (rice plant in the phenological stage of seed development).\n10. Monitor the feeding behavior of the young aphids using the EPG technique.\nOne Giga-4 DC-EPG device with 1 GΩ (EPG Systems) is used to monitor the probing and feeding activities of aphids on rice plants. To transfer the EPG signals to a laptop computer, we used a USB analog/digital converter card (DI-158U; DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH). EPG signals are acquired using Stylet+ software (EPG Systems) for Windows®.\nIt is important to wait for 10 min of committed phloem ingestion activity before amputating the stylets (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bc057c83-a480-4839-92f2-f819b7e1ccfc/cpz1903-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nElectrical Penetration Graph (EPG) recording for Sitobion avenae feeding behavior on rice plant. Intercellular pathway in mesophyll cells and phloem activities of the aphids into the SEs (upper figure). Amplification of the two distinct phases observed (lower figures): E1, salivation into the SEs; E2, passive phloem sap ingestion.\n11. Proceed to amputation of stylets using the tungsten needle of the Zapper RFM unit mounted on a micromanipulator and moved under observation by a binocular microscope. After confirming that the aphid shows passive phloem sap ingestion (E2 waveform) using the EPG technique, move the tip of the needle until it touches the labium of the aphid (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0003]). Immediately trigger the RFM unit pulse using the foot switch (see Downing & Unwin, 1977[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-bib-0009]).\nIn a successful cut, phloem sap starts to exude and the stylet is used to collect the sap.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4948c7cd-3c67-4e3c-8d19-37ca821d3dee/cpz1903-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nStylet amputation by RFM and phloem sap collection. (A) The needle is in contact with the labium of the aphid before stylets amputation by RFM. (B) Phloem sap droplet is directly collected into a microcapillary tube.",
    "12. Collect sap droplets as they exude from the stump of the amputated aphid stylets. Collect sap samples into the bottom part of the microcapillary tube held in a micromanipulator (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0003]).\nIt is recommended to fill the top of the microcapillary tube with water-saturated silicone oil to prevent evaporation and contamination of the exudates.\n13. Place each sap sample (∼0.6-1.9 μl/plant) in a separate 200-µl microtube; dilute each sample with 8 µl of filtered PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4), with or without proteinase inhibitor (PI).\nSamples are immediately prepared and used for NTA and TEM analyses.\nIf used, silicone oil must be removed by centrifugation prior sample analysis. Depending on the purpose of the research, it is not mandatory to use protease inhibitors during the EV isolation process. This protective reagent should be added to PBS when the objectives of the research include functional or proteomic analyses of the isolated vesicles.",
    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-prot-0001] leads to the collection of pure phloem sap obtained directly from the single sieve element in rice plants. Nevertheless, stylectomy is a complicated method and only a small volume of phloem sap is obtained. The following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-prot-0002] describes the stem incision method (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0004]), which is easier and faster than stylectomy. This method is applied to melon plants, which spontaneously exude abundant phloem sap after cutting of the phloem vessels. PhlEVs are isolated and purified from sap by SEC and analyzed by NTA and TEM.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a8b2c65d-81e2-4a4f-b0f9-49a7df8b7a66/cpz1903-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nOverview of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-prot-0002].

    "The number of plants to be grown, and the volume of sap to be collected, will depend on the objectives and analyses planned.\n2. Water plants three times a week using a fertilizer (dose of 0.25 g/L) rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n3. Grow melon plants for 5 weeks and use them to collect phloem sap using the stem incision method described in the steps below.\nPhloem sap collection\n4. Prepare a rack with labeled 1.5-ml sample tubes. Add to each tube 50 μl of filtered PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4) mixed with PI at the dose suggested by the manufacturer.\nIt is necessary to proceed to sap dilution immediately after sampling. The numbers of tubes (1 tube/plant) and buffer volume (final sap dilution 1/10 v/v, see below) required will depend on the number of plants to be sampled. It is very important to carry out the next steps (5-7) as quickly as possible, preferably with a two-person team.\n5. Cut the stem of the melon plant, between the first and second expanded leaves from the apex, with a sterile razor blade. Blot the cut surface and first droplet with sterile filter paper and, immediately, collect phloem exudates (which can take up to 1-2 min per each plant) using a micropipette with sterile tips. Measure, approximately, exudate volumes (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.903#cpz1903-fig-0005]).\nThe volume of phloem sap that could be collected from each individual plant usually ranges between 10 and 40 μl. The first exudate droplets are discarded to prevent sap contamination from neighboring cells.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8cd39d75-26d5-44c3-bac8-dbd2a2350570/cpz1903-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nPhloem sap collection on a melon plant after stem incision. (A-B) The first drop is discarded using sterile paper. (C) Phloem sap is collected and measured with a micropipette.",
    "6. Deposit each exudate in a 1.5-ml sample tube with the initial 50 μl PBS+PI, and mix well with the micropipette.\n7. Quickly add the required volume of fresh PBS+PI, according to sap volume collected, to make the final sap dilution 1/10 (v/v). Mix the sap sample with a vortex mixer and keep on ice until EV isolation by SEC (step 8). If needed, store sap samples at 4°C for 1-2 days, or at –20°C/–80°C for downstream analyses.\nPrepare the column for size exclusion chromatography (SEC)\n8. Place a syringe, or a SEC polypropylene column, with a porous filter at the bottom, on a stand. Use a beaker, placed just below the column, to collect the PBS used to clean and elute the column.\nCheck that column is upright, perpendicular to the stand base.\n9. Wash the column with 1 ml of filtered 10 mM PBS.\nUse a permanent marker to label the right volume (1 ml) on the column. Confirm that PBS is going through by dripping.\n10. Add 1 ml (packed volume) of Sepharose-CL2B to the column using a plastic Pasteur pipette or a micropipette (with a cut tip). Add Sepharose slowly and allow to settle down in the column, alternating with more PBS.\nCheck to make sure that Sepharose volume is correct (resin is more opaque than PBS). If necessary, remove excess resin with a micropipette.\n11. Wash the Sepharose three times, each time with 1 ml of filtered PBS (×3).\nThe Sepharose columns will be used at step 14.\nPhloem sap EV (PhlEV) isolation by SEC",
    "12. Concentrate the sample using an Amicon 4 ml centrifugal filter. Deposit the diluted sap in the filter and centrifuge at 3000 × g, 4°C, until the concentrated sample reaches the proper volume for SEC purification. The final volume of the concentrated sap sample should be between 50 and 200 μl.\nThis concentration step must be carried out just before proceeding to isolate PhlEVs by SEC.\n13. Label twelve 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes to collect 12 eluted fractions (∼0.1 ml) from the SEC. Place microtubes in a rack.\nTo facilitate the collection of the correct fraction volumes, use a marker to label the 0.1-ml level on the tubes.\n14. Before loading sap samples, wait until complete elution of the buffer used to rinse the resin. Then, remove the beaker and place the microtube rack under the column.\nIt is very important to carry out the next steps (15-16) as quickly as possible. Pay particular attention to droplet collection.\n15. Load the SEC column with the concentrated phloem sap sample (50-200 μl). Immediately, once the sample penetrates the resin, start to collect the first fractions. Prior to adding more PBS, wait until the column stops dripping. Add more filtered PBS to the column for a complete elution of the sample.\nPlace the sample carefully on top of the resin, with circular movements, and avoid altering the surface of the resin.\n16. Collect 12 consecutive fractions of ∼0.1 ml in the microtubes from each sample.\nPhlEVs should elute in fractions 4-7; these fractions can be analyzed separately or mixed to form a single sample. Soluble proteins reproducibly elute in fractions 9-12, as evaluated in preliminary assays by NTA and TEM. In further experiments, those fractions are usually combined.",
    "Be careful with drop size/volume, as this could vary depending on the particular experimental settings (∼0.1 ml equals to 2-4 drops). Keep SEC fractions on ice until characterization analyses. If needed, store SEC samples at 4°C or at –80°C for further analyses."
