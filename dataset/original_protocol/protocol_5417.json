    "Day 1Seed a 3 ml LB culture from a -80 °C glycerol stock or a colony on an LB agar plate, and grow overnight (16-24 h) at 37 °C with shaking (240 RPM).Inoculate in a tissue culture 96 wells (P96) microplate, 5 x 103 HeLa cells in each well in 100 μl per well of complete cell culture medium (DMEM 10% FBS 1% NEAA 50 μg/ml gentamicin, see Recipes). Grow for 24 h in a 37 °C 5% CO2 humidified incubator. See the Data analysis section for the number of strains/conditions that can be tested per P96.Day 2Bacteria cultureInoculate into 9.5 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) DMEM 25 mM HEPES in a tube with 500 μl of the bacterial overnight LB culture. Grow at 37 °C with shaking (240 RPM) to reach OD600 nm = 0.4 to 0.5 (about 2 h). Determine the number of bacteria per ml by measuring the absorbance OD600 nm of 1 ml of the culture. 1 unit of OD600 nm corresponds to 5 x 108 bacteria/ml (typical value for E. coli with a WPA colourwave CO 7500 colorimeter).HeLa cell washingMeanwhile, wash cautiously the HeLa cells 3 times with 100 µl of warm (37 °C) HBSS then add 100 µl per well of DMEM 25 mM HEPES. For row B, add 200 µl instead of 100 µl (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814194451_6890.jpgFigure 1. Example of plate infection scheme. For dose/effect examination, bacteria are inoculated to HeLa cells at various multiplicity of infection (MOI, i.e., the number of bacteria per cell at the onset of the infection). Typically, bacteria are inoculated in row B with 200 µl per well (preferentially in duplicate or triplicate) then serially diluted (2-fold as shown) to achieve an infectious dose-effect. The final interaction medium volume is 100 µl.",
    "Peripheral wells should not be used to avoid edge effects that alter HeLa cell growth and response.HeLa cells infectionInoculate the cells with the bacteria, starting in row B, to achieve the maximum required number of bacteria per cell (multiplicity of infection, MOI). For dose/effect examination, prepare serial two-fold dilutions from row B to G, by transferring between each row 100 µl (see Figure 1). Typically, the highest MOI is 200 in first row B, and the MOI in the last row G is 6.25. Include on the plate a positive (bacteria synthetizing colibactin) and a negative control (bacteria not synthetizing colibactin). The plate is incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. Measure the absorbance at 600 nm with a microplate reader to monitor bacterial growth. Post-infectionWash the cells at least three times with 100 µl of pre-warmed (37 °C) HBSS. Check under an inverted microscope whether most of the bacteria are removed. Perform additional washes if required. Then, 100 µl of complete medium (DMEM GlutaMax, 10% FBS, 1% NEAA) supplemented with 200 µg/ml of gentamicin is added to each well. Incubate the P96 at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.Day 3-4Check the cells under an inverted microscope every day for bacterial overgrowth, replace with fresh medium supplemented with gentamicin if required.Day 5Cell fixationThe plate is rinsed two times with PBS. Under a chemical safety hood proceed to fixation with 100 µl of fixation solution (PBS 4% formaldehyde, see Recipes) for 20 min. Throw out the fixative in a toxic waste container, and rinse 2 times with PBS then once with methylene blue wash buffer (see Recipes).Methylene blue colorationStain with 100 µl/well of methylene blue staining solution (see Recipes) for 1 h.",
    "Rinse several times with methylene blue wash buffer (see Recipes), tapping the plate between each wash on a paper towel to remove all the liquid. Repeat until no more blue stain is visible on the paper towel. Air dry overnight at room temperature or a few hours at 37 °C. Microscopic observationObserve the cells with an inverted microscope. Control cells should be confluent with a normal cellular morphology. In contrast, cells infected with high MOI of E. coli producing colibactin (MOI around 100) should exhibit a cytopathic phenotype characterized by low numbers of cells, megalocytosis (giant cells) and signs of cell death (apoptotic bodies, cell debris) (see Figure 2). At lower MOI of E. coli producing colibactin (around MOI 25), the phenotype is less marked, and islets of normal cells (that were able to repair the moderate DNA damage and resumed proliferation) should be visible. At MOI < 12 the cells are similar to control cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814194651_8700.jpgFigure 2. Megalocytosis phenotype observed three days after a 4 h exposure of HeLa cells to a pks+ E. coli strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 12 to 100 bacteria per cell. The cells were stained with methylene blue and photographed with a 20x objective. Scale bars = 25 µm.Genotoxicity quantificationThe methylene blue is extracted in 100 µl per wells of methylene blue extraction solution, 15 min under agitation. Transfer 75 µl to a new plate and measure the absorbance at 660 nm with a microplate reader. Prepare a graph with OD660 nm in function of the MOI and the strain, with control strains as references. The more the strain is genotoxic, the less coloration will be measured, due to cell growth inhibition, senescence (megalocytosis) and cell death."
