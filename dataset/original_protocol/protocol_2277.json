    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInoculating iPSC-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2\nTiming: 24–120 h\nThis step describes how to inoculate iPSC-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2 and maintain them in culture for up to 120 h afterward. The work will be conducted in an S3 laboratory and requires a pre-made, titered stock of SARS-CoV-2 as well as mock control, as previously described (Hoffmann et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). To assess iPSC-derived kidney organoid quality at the beginning of any inoculation experiment, please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPrepare medium for SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of iPSC-derived kidney organoids.\nPrewarm Essential 6 medium to room temperature (18°C–22°C).\nClean a biohazard safety cabinet as well as any small equipment (pipettes, tweezers) with 80% ethanol according to the local standard.\nMix 2 mL of Essential 6 medium with the SARS-CoV-2 stock (titer typically around 1.75 × 107 PFU/mL but varies from stock to stock) to reach an estimated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 per transwell insert. Prepare the same amount of mock medium for the uninfected controls.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1883-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of iPSC-derived kidney organoids cultured on transwell filters\n(A) iPSC-derived kidney organoids cultured in a 6-well transwell plate in top and side view (air/liquid interface culture).\n(B) Control and SARS-CoV-2 conditions with organoids inoculated with mock medium (control) and with SARS-CoV-2 below and on top of the filter membrane (liquid culture).\n(C) Continued incubation of kidney organoids after 24 h inoculation in an air/liquid culture.",
    "Note: To prepare the inoculum at the desired MOI, the number of cells per organoid needs to be established beforehand. We recommend running a pilot dissociation experiment to count the number of cells per organoid for each experimental condition and assume similar numbers in follow-up experiments. This could be carried out by following steps 5–8 of this protocol. The number of cells per organoid obtained in the end corresponds to the number of viral infectious units (PFU, plaque-forming units) that should be used for inoculation to reach an MOI of 1. Details of the virus stock cultivation and titration are described in detail in Varghese et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nExpose kidney organoids to the SARS-CoV-2 inoculum.\nRemove the old medium from below each transwell filter (6-well format) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nOptional: If you would like to perform a plaque assay to monitor virus replication in the organoids, store the initial organoid medium prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation for baseline control measurements at −80°C.\nAdd new medium per condition: Essential 6 plus SARS-CoV-2 for experiment and Essential 6 containing mock medium for control organoids. Each transwell filter should contain 2 mL of fresh medium: 1.2 mL below the filter, 800 μL on top of the filter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nIncubate the organoids for 24 h at 37°C, 5% (v/v) CO2.\nRemove virus-containing medium from the organoids after 24 h of inoculation with SARS-CoV-2.\nRemove the old medium from below and on top of the transwell filter.\nWash the organoids below and above the filter with 2 mL of PBS (18°C–22°C) both below and on top of the transwell filter. Wash the organoids three times in total.\nRemove the PBS and add 1.2 mL of pre-warmed Essential 6 medium to the bottom of the transwell filter. Do not add medium to the top of the filter.",
    "Incubation of virus-infected kidney organoids.\nIncubate the organoids for 120 h.\nRefresh Essential 6 medium every 48 h while keeping the kidney organoids in culture: remove old medium and add 1.2 mL of fresh Essential 6 medium below the transwell filter, no medium on top. Remember to bring the medium to 18°C–22°C before adding it below the filter.\nNote: Adding medium on top and below the transwell filter during organoid inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 increases the organoid-virus interaction surface and might thereby enhance the infection efficiency.\nDigesting kidney organoid tissue into single cell suspensions\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step yields a single cell suspension of organoid-derived cells as input for the single cell sequencing workflow (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We calculated timing and reagents for two transwell filters containing four organoids each: control and SARS-CoV-2-exposed kidney organoids. This step will be conducted in an S3 environment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1883-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Remove organoids from the incubator and remove the medium (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nGently wash the organoids on top and below the transwell filter with 2 mL PBS (18°C–22°C) each. Repeat this step to a total of 3 washes.\nMechanic and enzymatic digestion of the organoids.\nRemove PBS and add 300 μL of the Digestion Solution (stored at 4°C) containing Accutase and DNase I (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section above) on top of each transwell filter (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nResuspend and mechanically disrupt the organoids in the Digestion Solution using a 200 μL wide-bore tip with an inner tip diameter of approx. 1 mm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAlternatives: Instead of fabric-made wide-bore tips you can also use custom-made ones. For this, prepare a box of 200 μL or 1 mL standard pipette tips and cut off the tips at the desired circumference (approximately 1 mm in inner opening diameter). Autoclave prior to use.\nTransfer the organoid suspension to a new 6-well plate without transwell inserts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nIncubate the cell suspension for 15–18 min at 37°C. During this period, resuspend the organoids by pipetting them up and down 10 times in the same Digestion Solution every 2 min until it becomes a homogeneous single cell suspension (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nStop the enzymatic digestion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nPlace 40 μm cell strainers on top of two 50 mL Falcon tubes and pre-wet the filters with PBS (18°C–22°C).\nAdd 4 mL of the Stopping Solution (DMEM/F12 + 10% (v/v) FCS) onto each of the two single cell suspensions in the 6-well plate to inactivate accutase and DNase.\nTransfer each suspension through a cell strainer. Wash the filter using more Stopping Solution. The volume can go up to 20 mL.",
    "Remove the 40 μm cell strainers and centrifuge the single cell suspensions at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIn the meantime, prepare two new Falcon tubes with 40 μm cell strainers and pre-wet the filters with PBS (18°C–22°C).\nDiscard the supernatants, resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL 10× buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) and filter each through the 40 μm cell strainers. Wash the filters using 20 mL 10× buffer each for maximum cell retrieval.\nRemove the 40 μm cell strainers and centrifuge the single cell suspensions at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatants and resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μL 10× buffer (PBS + 1% BSA).\nCount the cells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3H).\nPrepare a Neubauer counting chamber.\nDilute 10 μL of each single cell suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue (1:1).\nPlace the Neubauer counting chamber under a microscope and count 4 times 16 squares.\nCalculate the total cell number according to this equation: total number of cells = [(number of cells per 16 squares)/4] ∗ 2 ∗ 10,000.\nIdeally, the cell concentration should be around 1,000 cells/μL for 10× genomics single cell workflow. One expects ca. 4 million cells from four organoids with around 5%–10% of trypan blue positive cells.\nNote: If you experience a high number of trypan blue positive/dead cells, please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], for potential solutions.\nKeep the single cell suspensions at 4°C and continue directly with step 3: Processing of cells for single cell RNA sequencing.\nNote: Although described in the context of single cell RNA sequencing workup at an S3 laboratory, the organoid dissociation step of the protocol can be utilized for a manifold of applications including fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) and sorting.",
    "Note: Should your single cell suspension show aggregates and clumps (visible cell aggregates in the Neubauer counting chamber), please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], for potential solutions.\nProcessing cells for single-cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step uses the single cell suspensions retrieved in the previous step of this protocol as input for the first step of the Next GEM v3.1 single cell sequencing workflow (10× genomics). The steps follow the original manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index] Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ v3.1 (Dual Index) User Guide Rev C) and end with an incubation step in a thermal cycler that also serves to inactivate the virus, allowing transfer of the samples from the S3 laboratory for further processing. It is strongly recommended to familiarize oneself with the Next GEM v3.1 protocol before continuing. Here, we provide a brief recapitulation of step 1 of the Next GEM v3.1 workflow for two samples: control and SARS-CoV-2-infected.\nClean a laboratory bench RNA or biochemistry working area with 80% ethanol and an RNase-eliminating agent, e.g., RNase-Zap.\nPrepare reagents and the 10× Master Mix solution.\nBring the Next GEM beads to 18°C–22°C. Vortex for 30 s and spin down briefly directly before use.\nKeep RT Reagent B, Template Switch Oligo, and Reducing Agent B to 18°C–22°C.\nKeep RT Enzyme C at 4°C until use.\nPrepare 10× Master Mix for two samples (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) at 4°C in a PCR tube.\nPrepare Chromium Chip G.\nPlace Chip G into its secondary holder.",
    "Fill unused wells on a Chip G with 50% glycerol according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index] (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ v3.1 (Dual Index) User Guide Rev C, page 28, step 1.2a): 70 μL into each unused well in row 1, 50 μL into each unused well in row 2, and 45 μL in each unused well in row 3.\nThis protocol will load two samples onto the chip, thus 6 reactions remain unused.\nLoad samples onto Chromium Chip G.\nMix cells, nuclease-free water, and 10× Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s table. For a concentration of 1000 cells/μL and a targeted cell number of 10,000, this means mixing the following components per sample: 31.9 μL 10× Master Mix, 16.5 μL cell suspension, and 26.7 μL nuclease-free water. Mix well by pipetting 15 times without introducing air bubbles.\nLoad 70 μL of Cell-Master-Mix into each sample row 1 on the chip.\nAdd 50 μL of 10× beads into each sample row 2 on the chip.\nAdd 40 μL of partitioning oil into each sample row 3 on the chip.\nNote: Carefully check for air bubbles in any of the wells before applying the gasket and placing the chip into the chromium controller. If you spot air bubbles, remove them with the help of a needle. Remaining air bubbles in any of the wells may cause wetting failure and loss of sample.\nAttach the 10× gasket and place the chip and secondary holder into the chromium controller.\nRun the chromium controller Chip G programme. This will take 17 min 42 s.\nAfter completion of the chromium controller run, slowly and carefully transfer the products into new PCR tubes.\nPut the two PCR tubes containing the control and the SARS-CoV-2-exposed sample into a thermocycler and run the following programme:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1883_6.csv",
    "Pause point: The product of this step can be stored at 4°C for up to 72 h or at −20°C for up to 7 days until continuation with the next step.\nPreparation of targeted libraries to computationally retrieve SARS-CoV-2 content in single cells\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step guides you through the generation of a SARS-CoV-2-targeted library in parallel to the usual library construction process within the 10× genomics Next GEM v3.1 single cell RNA sequencing workflow. The starting point of this step is single-cell barcoded cDNA (step 2 of the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ v3.1 (Dual Index) User Guide Rev C). Thus, you will first have to generate cDNA from the samples of the previous step according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index] (= step 2) before continuing with the library. The aim is to generate a SARS-CoV-2-targeted library, in addition to the standard 10× V3.1 library construction workflow (Schraivogel et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Triana et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). This targeted library is generated by two PCS amplifications of SARS-CoV2 specific primers and a final indexing PCR (PCR 1–3) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Both libraries are finally sequenced together, to later on computationally map the targeted and amplified SARS-CoV-2 reads to the individual cells of the single cell RNA sequencing library. Further detailed information on the steps of this part of the protocol is described in the original protocol (Schraivogel et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1883-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
