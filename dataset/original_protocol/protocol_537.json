    "**A.** **Culture** **condition** **and** **protein** **extraction** \n1. Germinate _P. indica_ spores and grow in 100ml of Hill-Kaefer’s broth at 28±2°C for six days.\n  \n2. For interaction, add secondary culture of _A._ _chroococcum_ strains WR5 and M4 \\(OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4), individually into six-day old fungal cultures and again co-culture for additional three days with control fungus. \n  \n3. Wash control and co-cultured mycelium-on day 9 three times with 1X PBS and pellet at 7000rpm for 10min at 4°C.  \n  \nCRITICAL STEP :\nWashing of the mycelial mass can be done with 1x PBS \\(pH 7.4) by gradual shaking with three changes of buffer before pelleting down.\n \n4. For protein extraction, harvest mycelia from each experimental condition and record fresh weight.\n  \n5. Grind mycelia to fine powder in liquid nitrogen using sterile pre-cooled mortar and pestle.\n   \n6. Collect the fine powder into a cold 50ml centrifuge tube and homogenize with pre-chilled 10% TCA \\(w/v) in acetone with 0.07% \\(v/v) 2-mecraptoethanol by vortexing for 10 min. Incubate overnight at - 20°C.  \n  \nCRITICAL STEP:\nPrepare10% TCA in acetone with 0.07% 2-mecraptoethanol and keep in -20 °C before use to prevent degradation of proteins.\n7. Centrifuge the precipitated protein at14000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and collect the pellet.\n   \n8. Wash the pellet twice with chilled 90% acetone containing 10mM \\(w/v) dithiothreitol \\(DTT) and 80% chilled acetone containing 10mM DTT \\(w/v) respectively. Collect the pellet by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. \n  \n9. Air dry the residual acetone for 10 min at 4 °C and re-suspended the protein pellet in protein solubilization buffer 1  with intermittent sonication. \n  \nCRITICAL STEP :\nAvoid over drying the protein pellet, which may hinder its solubilization.",
    "10. Once the solution is clear, add 0.1% SDS and place the solution in a Falcon tube on a slow moving rocker for 20-30min at 4°C to achieve complete solubilization.\n  \n11. Spin at 14,000 rpm for 15min at 4°C. Collect the supernatant having the protein.\n  \n12. Concentrate the collected protein and increase the conductivity by using Perfect Focus kit \\(G-Biosciences) protocol.\n  \n13. Add an appropriate volume of solubilization buffer 2 to completely suspend the protein pellet. Vortex periodically until pellet is dissolved.\n  \n14. Quantify dissolved protein by Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin \\(BSA) as a standard.  \n  \nCRITICAL STEP :\nCrude protein must be concentrated and conductivity of the solution increased. This increases the quality of both isoelectric focusing and gives distinctly resolved protein spots in the gel. \n **B.** **2D-gel** **electrophoresis** \n    \n15. In order to perform 2D-gel electrophoreses, suspend 250 micrograms of total protein from each experimental group in rehydration buffer.\n  \n16. Pipette out the individual protein mixture in a 13cm ceramic strip holder in which an immobilized linear pH gradient \\(IPG) strip, pH 3-10, 13cm \\(GE Health care) is placed facing the gel side downward.\n   \n17. Rehydrate the strips overnight at room temperature and focused by increasing voltage over 8 h from 100 to 10.000 V.\n  \n18. For second dimension, equilibrate the strips in first equilibration buffer \\[6M urea,30% \\(v/v) glycerol, l2% SDS, 50mM Tris-HCL \\(pH 8.8), 1% \\(w/v) Bromophenol blue] containing 1.54% \\(w/v) DTT for 15min. Equilibrate it again by adding second equilibration buffer having 2.5%  \\(w/v) IAA in first equilibration buffer for another 15min.\n   \n19. Place the individual strips on a12 % polyacrylamide gel for SDS PAGE.\n   \n20. Electrophorese at room temperature using the Bio-Rad-power-PAC 200 at 100V.",
    "21. Visualise the protein spots by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 \\(0.25%, w/v) prepared in methanol \\(40%) and acetic acid \\(10% ). Destain it with distaining solution \\(30% methanol, 10% acetic acid).\n   \n **C.** **Analysis** **of** **2D-gel** \n22. Scan the individual gels for protein spots using an Image scanner. \n  \n23. To identify spots of interest, compare pair-wise the gels of pure fungal culture \\(control) and the co-cultured fungus \\(_P. indica_ with WR5 and _P. indica_ with M4).\n   \n24. Using a  2-D gel image analysis software like ‘The Progenesis Same Spots version 4.5.4325.32621, Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd, UK’ perform both a qualitative \\(presence vs absence) and a quantitative analysis.\n  \n25. For identification of differentially expressed proteins, compare the relative spot volumes of the three replicate gels and quantitate each spot and normalize it with respect to the total spot volume of the 2-DE gel.\n   \n26. The difference in spot volume can be used as a measure of change in protein expression and significantly different intensities can be statistically analyzed."
