    "NOTE: Prior to implementation of the presented model, the corresponding animal protection laws must be consulted and permission must be obtained from the local authorities. In this work, all experiments were performed in conformity with the guiding principles for research involving animals and the German legislation on protection of animals. The experiments were approved by the local animal care committee.\n1. Animal Preparation and Surgical Elevation of the Flap\nKeep animals in single cages at room temperature of 22–24 °C and at a relative humidity of 60–65% with a 12-hr day-and-night cycle. Allow mice free access to drinking water and standard laboratory chow. Always maintain sterile conditions during survival surgery.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.1 ml saline solution per 10 g bw containing 90 mg/kg bw ketamine hydrochloride and 25 mg/kg bw dihydroxylidinothiazine hydrochloride. Anesthesia is necessary for animal preparation, surgery and subsequent microscopy. Confirm proper anesthetization by checking the response to a painful stimulus. During the time of anesthesia, apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness.\nAfter induction of sufficient anesthesia, depilate the back with an electric shaver. Hereafter, apply depilation cream to the shaved area to remove the remaining hair.\nDuring residence time of the depilation cream of ~7–10 min, prepare instruments, including skin forceps and micro forceps, scissors and micro scissors, suture material and a marker pen. Disinfect and prepare the titanium chamber by applying the two screws with the nut at the chamber’s base and by fixing self-adhesive foam (Fig. 1 A-C) around the window of the chamber’s counterpart to guarantee tightness of the chamber system.\nRemove all depilation cream from the back by washing it off with tepid water. Then dry and disinfect the skin with an alcohol-containing solution.",
    "Place the mouse in prone position and define the midline of the back. Grasp the skin centrally and lift it up to create a fold (Fig. 2A). By trans-illumination using any kind of light source, decide where to provisorily place the titanium frame (Fig. 2B). Make sure that the distal branches of the lateral thoracic artery (LTA) cranially and the deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) caudally course through the center of the chamber’s window (Fig. 2B-D). Once the positioning of the chamber is done, perforate both layers of the skin at the very bottom of the fold for later fixation of the titanium frame. Now remove the titanium frame, place the mouse in prone position and redefine the midline of the back if necessary.\nOutline the flap perpendicular to the spine starting at the midline with a width-to-length ratio of 15 x 11 mm to result in a laterally based and randomly perfused flap. Then outline an additional skin area of 2 mm extending to the contralateral side (Fig. 2C, D). This area is picked with the forceps and later sutured to the titanium frame without interfering with the visible flap area.\nFollowing final marking, incise the flap. In doing so, transect both the LTA and DCIA and elevate the flap (Fig. 2E). There is no need for coagulation or ligation of the transected vessels.\nPlace the chamber’s screw through the previously made skin perforations (Fig. 2F) and fixate the skinfold both anteriorly and posteriorly within the chamber’s frame of the elevated flap to the backside part of the frame using the holes of the chamber’s frame and a 5-0 interrupted sutures (Fig. 2G).\nSuture the vertical limbs of the flap back to the surrounding skin by means of 5-0 interrupted sutures (Fig. 2H, I).",
    "Excise a hemi-circular area of skin lateral to the small skin strip of 2 mm, i.e., on the other side of the flap to observe the flap’s vasculature. This allows direct view through the observation window of the chamber that has a surface of 90 mm2.\nRemove the gelatin-like loose areolar tissue from the striated muscle using microsurgical instruments and optical magnifying lens or microscope in order to improve the image quality during microscopy. Try not to damage vessels within the muscular tissue layers.\nFinally, seal the chamber by mounting the counterpart of the frame that has previously been endued with self-adhering strips of foam anteriorly, cranially and posteriorly, bedew the flap with topical bisbenzimide and saline (Fig. 2J). Thereafter, apply the observation window with a cover glass using a snap ring. Try not to entrap any air blisters under the glass (Fig. 2K, L). The skin will adhere to the cover glass by adhesion forces.\n2. Intravital Epifluorescence Microscopy\nWait 24 hr after surgical preparation for the first microscopic analysis for ideal optical quality. This analysis represents the baseline of microscopy and is repeated at day 3, 5, 7 and 10 after surgery. Each time, anesthetize the mouse as described in step 1.2. Place the animal in a lateral decubital position on a custom-made Plexiglas carrier. That way, the muscular tissue layers of the flap adhering to the cover glass are facing up-wards.",
    "Inject 0.05 ml of 5% green fluorescence dextran (molecular weight 150,000) and 0.05 ml 1% highly fluorescent Rhodamine family dye in a tail vein or the retro-bulbar venous plexus. The green fluorescent dextran stains the non-cellular components of the blood if applied intravenously (i.v.). The fluorescent Rhodamine stains leukocytes and platelets that can be distinguished from other cellular and non-cellular components. Finally, bisbenzimide stains nuclear components that emit more or less fluorescence according to the state of condensation.\nSubsequently, place the mouse under the microscope. Ensure the microscope includes a LED system — LED beam combinations for 470 & 425 nm, 365 & 490 nm, and 540 & 580 nm as well as the corresponding filter sets (62 HE BFP/GFP/HcRed, range 1: 350–390 nm excitation wavelength, split 395 nm / 402–448 nm; range 2: 460–488 nm, split 495 nm / 500–557 nm; range 3: 567–602 nm, split 610 nm / 615 nm to infinite. 20 Rhodamine, range: 540–552 nm, split 560 nm, emission 575–640 nm).\nRecord the stills and motion-pictures using a charge-coupled device video camera and save them on a computer hard disk for further off-line analysis.\nUse different objectives (2.5X, NA (numerical aperture) = 0.06 for panorama views of the chamber; 5X, NA = 0.16; 10X, NA = 0.32; 20X, NA = 0.50; 50X, NA = 0.55) for recordings of the regions of interest.\nVirtually, divide the flap surface that is visible through the chamber’s window into three areas of equal height, i.e., a proximal, a central, and a distal area most remote from the vascular inflow (Fig. 3F). For image acquisition, proceed the following way at each observation time point:\n\t\nScan the tissue image by image within the chamber’s window from proximal to distal using the 5X objective.",
    "In each area of the flap, select second- or third-order arterioles and their accompanying venules with easily identifiable branching patterns. Using the 5X, 10X, or 20X objective, make printouts of the arteriolovenular bundles in order to easily re-localize the bundles throughout the whole observation period.\nWith the 20X objective and the 50X objective, further record 5–6 capillary fields and “apoptotic” fields per area of the flap respectively. All images recorded with the 10X and 20X objectives use the blue light (fluorescent dextran) and green light (Rhodamine) filter, whereas images recorded with the 5X and 50X objective use blue light (fluorescent dextran) and white light (Bisbenzimide) filter, respectively.\n3. Analysis of Recorded Data\nNOTE: With the use of a computer-assisted image analysis system quantify all recorded parameters off-line as follows29.\nMeasurement of the area of non-perfused, respectively necrotic tissue (mm2).\n\t\nUse the complete scanned chamber window image recorded with the 5X objective (from 2.6.1) and the fluorescent dextran to measure non-perfused respectively necrotic tissue. Use “AreaBo” function to measure the non-perfused dark area: Border the non-perfused area and calculate the area in mm2 by using the software’s Area measurement algorithms.\nMeasurement of microvascular diameter in arterioles, capillaries and venules (µm).\n\t\nLoad video or pictures from the recorded AV-bundles or the capillary fields into the software. For best results use the stills or videos with the highest magnification where definite borders of the vessel are clearly visible.\nUse the “DiamPe” function of the software to make sure the measurements are performed perpendicular to the vessel’s wall. To do so mark two points on the vessel’s wall and with the third click mark the perpendicular diameter of the vessel. The software will perform the measurement in µm.",
    "Repeat the measurements on the same vessels for all recordings at the same place. Measure multiple capillaries to accumulate average diameter.\nAnalysis of red blood cell (RBC) velocity in arterioles, capillaries and venules (mm/sec).\n\t\nFor arteriolar red blood cell (RBC) velocity (mm/s) measurements use the “VeloLSD” function of the software and choose the same vessels in the fluorescent dextran window for which the diameters have been measured.\nAnalyze it with the computer-assisted image analysis system using the line shift method, which is on the basis of the measurement of the shift (mm) of an individual intravascular gray level pattern over time (sec).\nMeasurement of volumetric blood flow in vessels (pl/sec).\n\t\nCalculate volumetric blood flow (pl/sec) in arterioles, venules and capillaries from RBC velocity and vessel cross-sectional area (π * r2) according to the equation of Gross and Aroesty, that is, Q = V * π * r2, assuming a cylindrical vessel shape30.\nMeasurement of functional capillary density of RBC-perfused capillaries (nutritive perfusion: cm/cm2).\n\t\nLoad a recorded fluorescent capillary field with 20X objective magnification into the software. Use the “DensLA” function to measure functional capillary density of RBC-perfused microvessels.\nTrace the perfused capillaries with the cursor and mark the perfused vessels. Do not mark non-perfused capillaries, arterioles or venules. The software will measure functional capillary density of the perfused capillaries in cm/cm2. Repeat the steps for the other recorded capillary fields.\nMeasurement of tortuosity of the microvessels (microvascular remodeling), early signs of angiogenesis such as bud and sprout-formation and newly formed microvessels.",
    "Load recorded videos or frames of fluorescent capillary fields into the software. Identify gyrose vessels and use the “TorqIx” function of the software. Trace the definite vessel flow with the course and end with a right click. The software will draw a straight line for the direct way and will set it in relation with the traced path.\n\t\tNOTE: Watch out for signs of angiogenesis such as buds, sprouts and newly formed capillaries, which usually emanate perpendicularly from the pre-existing capillaries. Measure the density of these newly formed vessels as described in step 3.5.\nIdentification of characteristics for apoptotic cell death, such as nuclear condensation, fragmentation and/or margination (cells/mm2).\n\t\nLoad Bisbenzimide-recorded videos (50X objective) into the software. Use the “DenseNA” function. Mark apoptotic cells according to the mentioned characteristics such as nuclear condensation, fragmentation and margination with a left click.\nAfter marking all characteristic cells throughout the video, click “N/A“ in the software, which will automatically count all marked cells and divide it throughout the area. The result will be apoptotic cells/mm2.\nAnalysis of leukocyte adherence to the vascular endothelium representing inflammation. Intermittent adherence of leukocytes (rolling leukocytes; adherence < 30 sec: number of rollers/mm2 endothelial surface) and firm adherence of leukocytes (sticking leukocytes; adherence > 30 sec: number of stickers/mm2 endothelial surface).\n\t\nAnalyze the inflammatory response by counting the number of Rhodamine labeled leukocytes that adhered to the endothelial lining of post-capillary venules for a time period of ≥30 sec (“stickers”) and the intermittently adhering leukocytes (<30 sec, “rollers”). Venular leukocyte adherence is expressed as cells per mm2 endothelial surface.\nMeasurement of intravascular and interstitial grey levels as a parameter for microvascular leakage (macromolecular extravasation E=E1/E2).",
    "Assess macromolecular leakage as a parameter of microvascular permeability after an i.v. injection of a fluorescent dextran. Densitometrically determine multiple grey levels in the tissue directly adjacent to the capillary vessel wall (E1), as well as in the marginal cell-free plasma of the vessel (E2). Then calculate macromolecular extravasation (E) as the ratio of E1/E2 31.\n4. Postoperative Care\nReturn the animal in a separate cage to avoid the company of other animals until fully recovered. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Monitor animals daily for bleeding, local and systemic signs of infection and the position of the chamber.\nEvaluate the general state of the animal by observing motor activity, body weight, signs of pain, tolerance to the dressing and auto-mutilation.\nKeep the mice one per cage to avoid mutual manipulation of the chamber. At any sign of pain, apply Buprenorphine at a dose of 0.05–0.1 mg/kg bw, subcutaneously in 8 hr intervals.\n5. Euthanasia and Explantation of the Skinfold Chamber\nAt day 10, sacrifice animals using an overdose of an anesthetic drug (150 mg/kg Pentobarbital).\nRemove the chamber and sample the flap tissue for immunohistochemical and molecular protein assays. Sample tissues for conventional histology (formalin) and quantifiable protein assays (liquid nitrogen or dry ice).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
