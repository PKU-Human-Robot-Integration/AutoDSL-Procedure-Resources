    "The protocol and video publication were approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Jena. The patient gave his agreement for his anonymized data to be published for article purposes.\n1. Physiological monitoring\nAfter bringing the patient to the operating table, establish a peripheral venous access line and connect to 500 cc of NaCl. Fix the arms and legs of the patient.\nInitiate the ECG, peripheral oxygen saturation, and pulse measurements. Perform sterilization of the right groin using an iodine based solution (e.g., Betadine solution).\n2. Preparation of the sterile equipments\nPrepare sterile equipment with the materials required by the catheter assistant/nurse. Cover the sterilized femoral access site with a transparent foil plaster.\n3. Venous puncture, catheter introduction, and invasive arterial pressure measurement\nPrepare ultrasonic guidance under sterile conditions.\nProvide subcutaneous anesthesia with 10-20 mL of Lidocaine subcutaneously above the venous puncture of the groin. Then, access the right femoral vein through palpation, fluoroscopic and/or ultrasound guidance. Introduce a standard wire with a J-tip and a 5 F multipurpose catheter into the superior vena cava.\nPerform an arterial puncture of the femoral artery, and introduce a 4F sheath for pressure monitoring. Many interventional cardiologists may find non-invasive blood pressure monitoring reliable in stable patients. Once the arterial blood pressure measurement is established, start the conscious sedation of the patient.\nStart the conscious sedation with midazolam (3-5 mg as a bolus) and propofol (1% bolus of 0.05-0.01 mL/kg body weight, followed by approximately 0.25 mL/kg/h).\nMeasure the pressure in the right atrium. The central venous pressure (CVP) should be in a normal range around 6-12 mmHg. If the mean CVP is below 6 mmHg, give an NaCl infusion until a CVP of 6 mmHg minimum is reached to avoid air embolism during the procedure.",
    "4. Local oropharyngeal anesthesia and introduction of the TEE probe\nBefore the start of conscious sedation, apply a local anesthesia, xylocaine pump spray (10 mg/puff), to the oropharyngeal region 5-10 times.\nApply bite protection.\n\tNOTE: The echo imager should apply a xylocaine gel to the TEE probe. Introduce the probe carefully into the patient's mouth after the application of the sedation agent. Alternatively, a micro probe can also be introduced via the patient's nose.\nFurther, assess possible pre-existing pericardial effusion in a four-chamber view, and set the bicaval view to include the PFO.\n5. Wire passage through the PFO\nAdvance a J-tip standard wire and the multipurpose (MP) catheter into the left atrium (LA) by slightly pushing forward the wire, and place it in the left upper pulmonary vein under fluoroscopy and TEE guidance. Obtain optimal TEE imaging by sweeping from 30° to 110°. Angiographically, the anterior-posterior projection is mostly used. Obtain a 45° left anterior oblique (LAO) view, as this may be helpful.\n6. Heparin application and measurement of the left atrial pressure (LAP)\nOnce the catheter had been introduced into the left atrium, administer a bolus injection of 100 IU heparin/kg body weight to reach an activated clotting time (ACT) of around 250 s. The ACT should be controlled after around 5 min by a point-of-care ACT analyzer, which is used as standard in most catheterization labs.\nMeasure the left atrial pressure (LAP) via the multipurpose catheter. If it is below 5 mmHg, administer IV fluid to reach a mean LAP of 5-10 mmHg.\n\t​NOTE: The risk of breathing-associated air embolism through the catheter is high when the pressure is below 5 mmHg. The measurement of the oxygen saturation with a blood gas test is optional.\n7. Advancing into the LA",
    "Advance a stiff and long guide wire with a soft tip (e.g., Amplatz Super Stiff, length of 260 cm) along the catheter into the LA, targeting the upper pulmonary vein.\n8. TEE-guided balloon sizing of the PFO\nNOTE: Although balloon sizing is discussed critically by some experts, it is recommended to use a sizing balloon to determine the size of the PFO according to the instructions for use.\nExchange the MP catheter for a 24 mm sizing balloon.\nPosition the balloon across the PFO, and inflate it with a 0.9% NaCl/contrast agent solution (1:4). Use two perpendicular TEE projections (e.g., 45° and 135°) for the PFO measurement.\nConfirm the dimensions by angiography images. In both, the measurement of the smallest balloon tail is crucial.\n9. Occluder selection\nUse a sizing chart to select the size and type of the PFO occluder device using the PFO size and total septum length assessed by TEE or TTE according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n10. Introduction of the device delivery system\nPrepare an adequately sized closure device according to the instructions for use, and flush properly to eliminate air bubbles.\nDeflate the sizing balloon, and exchange it for the delivery sheath (e.g., Mullins sheath).\nIntroduce the delivery sheath into the LA via the stiff guide wire (7 Fr to 10 Fr depending on the device size). After the aspiration of blood, ensure a wet-to-wet connection between the sheath and the delivery system to guarantee air bubble-free advancement of the device.\n11. Deployment of the PFO occluder\nIntroduce the device through the sheath via a wet to wet connection.",
    "Once the device is visible within the sheath, observe if thee is no air bubble in front of the device (maybe cine imaging), then pull the device back approximately 2 cm to confirm the attachment of the device to the delivery cable.\nPush the device forward into the LA, and carefully retract the sheath into the mid-left atrium (push and pull movement) under echocardiographic guidance, which allows the left-sided disc to unfold. Here, TEE guidance instead of angiography is sufficient and recommended to reduce the radiation dose.\nWithdraw the left-sided disc toward the interatrial septum until a subtle resistance is felt and the left-sided disc is seen on the septum by TEE.\nUnder discrete tension, pull the sheath further back into the right atrium (RA), which leads to the expansion of the right-sided disc.\nPush the device gently against the interatrial septum until the discs attach.\n12. Evaluation of the correct device position\nAssess the correct position of the device with TEE and angiography. With the latter, the so-called \"pacman sign\" indicates correct device placement.\nInspect the edges of the device thoroughly for any misalignments with respect to the aorta or the roof of the LA, which may lead to localized compression damage. A push-pull \"tug test\" can help to show the stability of the device. Beside the correct position of the device, the absence of gaps (color doppler) and pericardial effusion should be documented. Furthermore surrounded structures like the Eustachian valve, the rete chiari etc. should not be interferred with by the device. \nOnce the position of the device is found to be correct, disconnect the delivery cable, and remove the sheath.\nStop the concious sedation medication and remove the Echo probe. \n13. Sealing of the puncture and pressure bandage",
    "Close the femoral vein with a resorbing suture using a figure-of-eight stitch of the subcutaneous tissue material or a vessel closure device. Use a tight-sitting pressure bandage to prevent local bleeding.\nAfter the removal of the arterial blood pressure monitoring device, perform manual compression of the common femoral artery or use a closure device followed by application of a tight bandage.\n14. Check-up and post-intervention care\nContinue non-invasive monitoring of the blood pressure and heart rate for 24 h.\nProvide heparin (via IV) for 24 h at a target Partial thromboplastin time PTT of two to three times above the upper level of normal.\n\tNOTE: The international guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 3 months, followed by ASA monotherapy for up to 9-21 months13.\nSubscription Required.
