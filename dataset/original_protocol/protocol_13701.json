    "1. Preparation of stock solution and tools\nPrepare 20 mL of a 25% w/v BSA solution by mixing 5 g BSA powder in 14 mL of PBS, pH 7.2 in a 50 mL conical tube until evenly dispersed. Vortex as necessary to disperse the BSA powder.\n\t\nKeep the solution overnight at 4 °C to allow complete dissolution. Adjust the final volume to 20 mL with PBS to make a 25% w/v stock solution.\nPrepare 20 mL of a 31.3% w/v BSA solution by mixing 6.26 g BSA powder in 13 mL of PBS, pH 7.2 in a 50 mL conical tube until evenly dispersed. Keep the solution overnight at 4 °C to allow complete dissolution. Adjust the final volume to 20 mL with PBS to make a 31.3% w/v stock solution.\nPreheat a heat block to 85 °C.\n\tNOTE: The protocol below creates peptide/BSA gels with volumes of 1.26-1.4 mL formed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. To use smaller volumes, for example, when antigen stocks are limiting, prepare the gels in PCR tubes and use a thermocycler set to 85 °C as a heat block.\nTest that the BSA/formaldehyde mixture forms a gel as expected by mixing 700 µL of 25% BSA solution with 700 µL of 37% formaldehyde. Mix well by pipetting up and down 5 times within 5-10 s. Avoid creating air bubbles.\n\tCAUTION: Concentrated formaldehyde is toxic; use with appropriate safety precautions.\nImmediately after mixing the BSA and formaldehyde solutions, place the closed microcentrifuge tube in a heat block at 85 °C for 10 min. Remove the tube from the heat block and allow it to cool. Confirm that the gel has formed as expected.\n2. Preparation and dilution of peptides\nObtain 5-20 mg of lyophilized peptide of the desired sequence.",
    "NOTE: The C-terminal 16 amino acids of the human ERBB2 intracellular domain recognized by 4B5 is TPTAENPEYLGLDVPV-COOH.\n\t\nAdd 4 amino acids to the N-terminus, acetyl-YGSG, and C-terminus, GSGC-amide to facilitate cross-linking of the peptide to BSA and provide spacing between the BSA molecule and the peptide epitope.\n\t\tNOTE: The complete sequence is: acetyl-YGSGTPTAENPEYLGLDVPVGSGC-amide.\nIf desired, use other N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences to extend the core peptide epitope.\n\t\tNOTE: The impact of different sequences varies with different antibody/epitope combinations. The addition of the C-terminal peptide reduces the binding of some antibodies to C-terminal epitopes. In such cases, omit this sequence.\nConfirm that peptides from commercial sources are supplied at >95% purity, the composition of which is confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis.\nCalculate the necessary volumes for the 5x (1.25 E-2 M) peptide stock solutions. Referring to Table 1, columns C-E, enter values for the antigen molecular weight (g/mole), percent antigen purity (0-100), and antigen mass (mg).\n\tNOTE: The volume of solvent (in µL) to resuspend the sample to achieve a stock solution of 1.25 E-2 M is 800 x antigen molecular weight x percent antigen purity/antigen mass.\n\t\nPrepare and clearly label eight 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The tubes will contain 5x peptide stock in a solvent, 1x peptide stock in a solvent, five 10x serial dilutions of 2.5 E-4 M to 2.5 E-8 M peptide/BSA/formaldehyde gel, and a negative control gel containing BSA/formaldehyde lacking added antigen. All gel samples look identical. When preparing multiple sets of peptide dilutions at one time, take care to label and identify all tubes and processing cassettes correctly. Use color-coded microcentrifuge tubes and processing cassettes where possible to minimize misidentification.",
    "Prepare a 5x peptide stock solution at 1.25 E-2 M by resuspending the entire mass of lyophilized peptide (20 mg for the ERBB2 peptides) in 60 µL of the appropriate solvent.\n\tNOTE: In this example, dimethylformamide (DMF) was added directly to the vendor's container.\n\t\nInspect the solution to ensure that the peptide is completely dissolved. If necessary, add additional solvent and/or sonicate the sample until the peptide is completely dissolved, taking care not to exceed the volume calculated in Table 1 for the 5x peptide stock.\n\t\tCAUTION: DMF is toxic; use with appropriate precaution.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the amino acid sequence, and the corresponding hydrophobicity and charge, peptides may be soluble in DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pure water, or dilute solutions of acetic acid, formic acid, or ammonium bicarbonate. Peptide characteristics may be calculated using a variety of online tools17. Some peptide vendors may suggest solvents appropriate for specific sequences.\nAdd solvent as necessary to bring the volume of the 5x peptide stock to the final volume calculated in Table 1. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at room temperature at 5000 x g for 5 s. Peptide stock solutions can be stored at -80 °C.\nReferring to Table 2, Column C, prepare 150 µL of 1x peptide stock solution (2.5 E-3 M) by diluting 30 µL of the 5x peptide stock into 120 µL of solvent (DMF this example). Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at room temperature at 5000 x g for 5 s.\nReferring to Table 2, Column D, prepare 700 µL of 5 E-4 M peptide/BSA solution (Dilution 1) by diluting 140 µL of 1x peptide stock into 560 µL of 31.3% BSA/PBS, pH 7.2. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at room temperature at 5000 x g for 5 s.",
    "NOTE: The final BSA concentration of this solution is 25% (w/v).\nReferring to Table 2, Columns E-H, prepare four successive 10x serial dilutions of the 5 E-4 M peptide/BSA stock by adding 70 µL of peptide/BSA solution to 630 µL of 25% BSA/PBS, pH 7.2. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at room temperature at 5000 x g for 5 s.\n\tNOTE: After this step, there will be five 10-fold serial dilutions of peptide (5 E-4 M to 5 E-8 M) in 25% BSA/PBS, pH 7.2. The first four samples will contain 630 µL. The last sample will contain 700 µL.\nReferring to Table 2, Column I, prepare a negative control BSA sample containing 700 µL of 25% BSA/PBS, pH 7.2 (Figure 1A).\n3. Preparing BSA-peptide gels\nConfirm that the heat block or thermocycler is stable at 85 °C.\nRefer to Table 3, Columns B-E. Working one sample at a time, add to the first 25% BSA/peptide sample (Dilution 1) 630 µL of 37% formaldehyde. Mix well by pipetting up and down 5 times within 5-10 s. Avoid creating air bubbles.\n\tCAUTION: Concentrated formaldehyde is toxic; use with appropriate safety precautions.\n\t\nAfter mixing the peptide/BSA and formaldehyde solutions, place the closed microcentrifuge tube in a heat block at 85 °C for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Mix the BSA-peptide solution and formaldehyde thoroughly, but do not spend more than 10 s pipetting the mixture before placing the sample on heat. Since formaldehyde cross-linking begins immediately, the gel may form differently if the procedure is varied for different samples. The final BSA concentration in these gels is 12.5% (w/v). Final BSA concentrations less than 10% may yield gels that do not solidify; final BSA concentrations greater than 16% may produce gels more brittle and difficult to section after processing.",
    "Repeat steps 3.2 and 3.2.1 for each of the dilutions 2-4.\nRepeat steps 3.2 and 3.2.1 for dilution 5, but add 700 µL of 37% formaldehyde, a volume equal to the 700 µL of BSA-antigen solution.\nRefer to Table 3 column Column G; repeat steps 3.2 and 3.2.1 for the negative control sample, adding 700 µL of 37% formaldehyde, a volume equal to the 700 µL of negative control BSA solution.\nRemove the tubes from the heat block after 10-12 min. The heating time should be as consistent as possible for each sample. Allow the gels to cool on the benchtop for 5-10 min (Figure 1B).\nUsing a clean, flexible disposable laboratory spatula, remove the gel sample in one piece from the microcentrifuge tube, and place it in a sealed container containing at least 15 mL of neutral buffered formalin (NBF), using a separate container of NBF for each sample.\n\t\nAlternatively, cut off the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube with a new single edge razor blade, and push the gel out from the bottom with air or a suitable probe (Figure 1C-G).\n\t\t​NOTE: The solidified formaldehyde/BSA gels can remain in the microcentrifuge tubes at room temperature for up to 24 h. Leaving the gels in the microcentrifuge tube for more than 24 h can cause them to become brittle and more difficult to process and section.\n4. Trimming, processing, and embedding BSA gels",
    "Trim the gel cone into cylindrical discs approximately 5 mm thick using a clean single edge razor (Figure 1H,I). Wrap the discs in a biopsy wrap, placing one larger gel disc into one cassette (to be used in the pilot study in step 5), and the remaining gel discs together into a second cassette (Figure 2A,E) for use in tissue microarray (TMA) construction in step 6. Place the wrapped gel discs in clearly labeled tissue processing cassettes.\n\t\nPlace the cassetted gels in at least 15 mL of 10% NBF per gel sample before processing, using a separate container of NBF for each sample. Gels can remain in 10% NBF for 6-48 h.\nProcess the gels in an automated histology tissue processor, following a large tissue schedule with pressure and vacuum. Each step takes 1 h: 10% NBF, 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol (repeat two times), 100% ethanol (repeat two times), xylenes (repeat three times), paraffin at 60 °C (repeat three times).\n\tNOTE: For investigators choosing to process samples manually, follow the same sequence of reagents and times.\nWhen the sample processing is completed, remove the cassettes from the tissue processor and move them to the paraffin embedding center.\nUnwrap gels from the biopsy wrap and embed the gels in paraffin. For each sample, embed one disk of gel in a small 15 mm x 15 mm mold (Figure 2B-D), and the remaining gel discs together in a second larger mold (Figure 2F-H). The first block with one sample will be used to test the peptide gel in a pilot study. The second block can be used for TMA construction.\n5. Pilot evaluation of the peptide dilution series",
    "For each peptide dilution series, plan to create two glass slides containing a total of 6 separate sections: one section from each of the five dilution series samples, plus one section from the BSA-only negative control sample.\n\t\nOnto the first glass slide, cut one 4 µm thick section from each of the smaller blocks containing one gel disc with the three highest peptide concentrations (2.5 E-4 M to 2.5 E-6 M).\nOnto a second slide, cut one 4 µm thick section from each block with the two lowest peptide concentrations (2.5 E-7 M and 2.5 E-8 M) and one section from the BSA-only control block. Record the order of the samples on the slides.\n\t\tNOTE: Expect the paraffin-embedded gels to cut smoothly, producing uniform sections without fragmentation, tearing, or chattering artifact. If particular paraffin-embedded gel samples are difficult to section, briefly soak the block face in ice-cold distilled water before sectioning. If necessary, experiment with different soaking times or with different solutions (e.g., ammonia water).\nAfter sectioning, dry the slides at room temperature (about 23 °C) for 24 h followed by 60 °C for 30 min.\nStain the two slides prepared for each peptide with the desired antibody according to standard IHC protocols.\n\tNOTE: The primary antibody on-slide concentration used for rabbit monoclonal 4B5 in this demonstration was 1.5 ug/mL.\n\t\nExpect to see a relatively uniform signal within each gel section, with the different gel samples showing a range of signal intensity corresponding to the peptide dilutions.\nIf the results for the pilot study are satisfactory, construct a TMA from the gel donor blocks containing different concentrations of peptide antigen, as described in the next steps of the protocol.\n6. BSA gel TMA construction",
    "Construct a tissue microarray containing duplicate 1 mm diameter cores from donor blocks containing BSA gel alone and BSA gels containing all five dilutions of ERBB2 peptide.\n\tNOTE: If desired, include BSA gels containing the same five dilutions of a non-target peptide as additional negative controls. If desired, include cores of representative ERBB2-expressing cell lines as positive controls.\nCut 4 µm thick sections of the TMA and stain with 1.5 ug/mL of anti-ERBB2/HER2/neu rabbit monoclonal 4B5 (see Table of Materials) according to laboratory-standard protocols.\nAssess the resulting stain intensity qualitatively by inspection or quantitatively by digital image scanning and analysis (Figure 3A,B).\n\tNOTE: As digital image analysis is not the focus of this protocol, these steps are left for the reader to perform according to their preference.\nSubscription Required.
