    "Preparation of whole cell protein lysates   Grow bacterial cells [Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) OMZ175] in 10 ml BHI broth at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.    After 18 h, stationary phase cultures (OD600~0.9) are washed twice (2x) by centrifuging at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, discarding supernatants and resuspending pelleted cells with 1x PBS in original culture volume. After the second wash, cells are concentrated 5x by adding five times less the original culture volume of 1x PBS. The concentrated suspension is then transferred to a 1.7 ml screw cap tube containing approximately 500 μl of glass beads.    Whole cell protein lysates are obtained using a bead-beater at maximum setting (3,450 oscillations per min) and the suspensions are homogenized for three cycles of 30 sec with 2 min of incubation on ice between cycles.   Alternative mechanical methods to obtain whole cell protein lysates such as sonication or French-press, with or without freeze-thawing cycles, are also acceptable.     Protein lysates are separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane.   For gel preparation, the cassette is assembled with glass and silica plates with 0.75-1.0 mm spacers and placed on a caster.   Resolving gel is prepared, poured and let to polymerize for approximately 30 min.   Stacking gel is prepared, poured and a comb with desired number of wells inserted. Allow gel to polymerize (~ 30 min).   Remove cassette from caster and place on running apparatus.   Prepare samples by mixing equal volume of sample and 2x sample buffer and boil for 10 min. Incubate on ice for 1 min, quick spin tube to settle any sediment and load sample on gel.   Run SDS-PAGE at 100 V for 2 h.    Transfer “sandwich” is assembled (Figure 1) in the presence of transfer buffer.",
    "Gel is removed from plates and placed in assembling “sandwich”.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150402/20150402015410_2222.jpg Figure 1. Schematic of transfer “sandwich” assembling for Western blotting. In the presence of transfer buffer, place two (2) pieces of Whatman paper A soaked in transfer buffer followed by the gel with separated proteins B, the PVDF membrane C soaked in methanol then transfer buffer, and two (2) more pieces of soaked Whatman papers. Arrow shows the direction of protein transfer.    An oversized piece of PVDF membrane, to cover the entire gel, is soaked in methanol first followed by transfer buffer and then placed on top of the gel.   The rest of the transfer “sandwich” is completed and proteins are transferred to the membrane for 1 h at 100 V in the presence of transfer buffer and an ice unit block to absorb heat produced during transfer.   Sandwich is disassembled, membrane is removed and any extra piece of membrane that is bigger than the gel is cut out.     Block membrane with 5% BSA solution for 18-20 h at 4 °C with slow rocking. Wash membrane 3x by adding 20 ml of washing solution and slow rocking for 5 min to remove excess BSA. Then, incubate the membrane with the primary solution (biotinylated lectin in 0.5% BSA) at room temperature for 1 h with slow rocking.   Wash membrane 3x followed by the addition of the secondary solution (HRP-streptavidin in 0.5% BSA) and incubate at room temperature for 1 h with slow rocking.   After incubation with secondary solution, wash the membrane 4x to visualize biotinylated lectins bound to glycoproteins using enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit, mix equal volumes of detection solution 1 and detection solution 2 (for a final volume of 0.125 ml per cm2 of membrane) and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Drain excess detection solution and place membrane in an autoradiography cassette for film exposure. Due to the variability of carbohydrate content on glycoproteins, different exposure of the membrane to the film should be performed."
