    "NBT assay (For detection of O2-) (Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Procedure for qualitative estimation of superoxide ions (O2-) using NBT assay in rice  Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161212/20161212181519_5310.jpgFigure 1. Pieces of rice seedlings approximately 1 cm in lengthDip the cut pieces immediately into 6 mM NBT solution (2 ml) prepared in sodium citrate (pH 6.0) in a Petri dish (35 mm) using a tweezer.Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60 KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light.Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.After incubation, dip the samples in absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath (100 °C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in 2 h) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161212/20161212181901_7222.jpgFigure 2. Pieces of rice seedlings approximately 1 cm in length after removal of chlorophyll Cool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.Capture the images using a stereomicroscope by keeping the samples on a slide.Appearance of dark blue colour indicates the presence of O2- (Figure 3).DAB assay (For detection of H2O2)Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).Dip the cut pieces immediately into DAB solution (1 mg/ml) prepared in double distilled water (2 ml) (pH = 3.8) in a Petri dish (35 mm) using tweezers.Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 10 min at 60 KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min under room light.Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip and incubate the samples for 8 h at room temperature under light.",
    "After incubation, dip the samples in the absolute ethanol and then keep them in a water bath (100 °C) till the chlorophyll is removed from the samples completely (usually occurs in 2 h).Cool and dip the samples in 20% glycerol.Capture the images using a stereo microscope by keeping the samples on a slide.Appearance of brown coloured product indicates the presence of H2O2 (Figure 4).H2DCFDA assay (For detection of H2O2)Cut the second leaf of rice seedlings at the base of stem into small pieces (approximately 1 cm).Dip the cut pieces immediately into 10 µM H2DCFDA solution in a Petri dish (35 mm) using tweezers.Vacuum infiltrate the dipped samples for 5 min at 60 KPa pressure and then incubate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark.Note: If vacuum infiltration unit is not available, dip the samples for 2 h at room temperature.After incubation, wash the samples three times properly with autoclaved double distilled water.Dip the samples in 20% glycerol after washing.For confocal analysis, put the sample on a slide and fix a thin cover slip over it using nail enamel or glue.Observe the samples under a confocal microscope using laser beam of wavelength of excitation 488 nm.Green fluorescence indicates the presence of H2O2 and red represents the autofluorescence of chlorophyll.Quantification of aqueous H2O2 contentHomogenize 0.5 g fresh seedlings in activated charcoal (0.1 g) prepared in 5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid using a pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen.Filter the homogenate using a Whatman filter (No.1) and collect the filtrate in 2 ml amber Eppendorf tubes (H2O2 is light sensitive).Centrifuge the filtrate at 5,000 x g for 10 min in the tubes.Note: Either centrifuge the filtrate from one sample in two 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and then pool the supernatant together or use a 5 ml amber Eppendorf tube.",
    "Collect 0.2 ml of the supernatant in a glass tube and add 1 ml FOX reagent to it.Mix the reaction mix properly and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Estimate the content of aqueous H2O2 by recording the absorbance at 560 nm using a disposable plastic cuvette and calculate the concentration using a standard curve.The concentration is calculated using the beer-lambert law, i.e.            A = ε x b x cWhere, A = absorbance, ε is the wavelength-dependent molar absorptivity coefficient, b = path length, c = concentration.For the standard curve preparation, take 0.2 ml of different concentrations of H2O2, add 1 ml of FOX reagent and proceed as similar to the samples (see Recipe 5). Note: The absorbance should be taken at 560 nm wavelength."
