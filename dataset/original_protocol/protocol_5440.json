    "Virus infectionMaintain A549 cells in T225 flasks, following the ATCC’s culturing recommendations, with the following modifications:Use F-12 complete medium to maintain the line (see Recipes); use TrypLE Select cell dissociation reagent; use FBS to inactivate the TrypLE Select. To seed A549 cells onto coverslips, remove the F12 complete cell culture medium from a T225 flask containing a monolayer of about 80% confluent A459 cells. Gently rinse the monolayer with 10 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) 1x DPBS, and remove the DPBS. To dissociate cells, add 5 ml TryLE Select cell dissociation reagent, and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C in a standard humidified CO2 incubator. Inactivate TrypLE Select by adding 10 ml of cold FBS. Detach and dissociate A549 cells by gentle pipetting, and transfer the single-cell suspension to a 50 ml conical tube.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) F-12 complete medium. Dilute 10 µl of the resuspended A549 cells 1:10 in DPBS with 0.04% trypan blue (80 µl DPBS,10 µl trypan blue [0.4%],10 µl aliquot of A549 cells, resuspended in complete F-12 medium) and determine the concentration of the resuspended cells per ml using a hemocytometer as recommended by the manufacturer. Dilute the resuspended A549 cells from the 50 ml conical tube with F-12 complete medium to 3 x 104 cells per ml, and seed cells by adding 1 ml of F-12 complete medium with 3 x 104 cells to each well of a 24-well plate containing a coverslip.Incubate the cells overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.To infect A549 cells, replace the medium with 150 µl F-12 medium without additives, containing sucrose-purified RSV (Collins et al.",
    ", 1995 and Le Nouen et al., 2009; see Notes) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 plaque forming unit (PFU) per cell (see Notes).Incubate A549 cells with virus inoculum for 1 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Remove virus inoculum and wash infected cells 2 x with 1 ml F-12 medium without additives. Incubate infected cells in 1 ml of F-12 medium with 2% FBS and 1% L-glutamine for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.Slide preparationRemove cell culture medium and wash monolayers 3 x with 1 ml DPBS.To fix infected cells, incubate cells with 1 ml of a freshly prepared 1:4 dilution of PFA (4% final concentration) in DPBS for 30 min at room temperature. Remove PFA solution and wash cells 3 x each with 1 ml DPBS.To permeabilize fixed cells, incubate with 1 ml 0.05% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 10 min at room temperature.Remove Triton X-100 solution and wash cells 3 x each with 1 ml DPBS.To block unspecific protein binding, incubate coverslip with 1 ml 3% BSA in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C.Wash cells 1 x with 1 ml DPBS.Incubate cells overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody mix: mouse anti-RSV F mAb (1:500) and rabbit anti-tubulin mAb (1:100) in PBS with 0.1% BSA.Wash cells 3 x each with 1 ml DPBS.Incubate cells with secondary antibody mix: goat anti-mouse AF488 (1:200) and goat anti-rabbit Atto 647N (1:100) in DPBS with 0.1% BSA for 3 h at 4 °C in the dark.Wash cells 3 x each with 1 ml DPBS.For actin cytoskeleton staining, incubate cells with rhodamine phalloidin (1:500) in DPBS for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.Wash cells 2 x each with 1 ml DPBS.Wash cells 2 x each with 1 ml deionized H2O.",
    "To mount the coverslip on a glass slide, first place 10 µl of ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium onto a glass slide. Pick up the coverslip with Dumont #NO forceps and lower the cover slip cell-side down onto the mounting medium, taking care to avoid trapping air bubbles. Dry slide overnight in the dark.Imaging procedureIn Figure 1, all images were collected in a single focal plane with a 30 nm pixel size using a bidirectional scan speed of 600 Hz. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170831/20170831001441_1933.jpgFigure 1. STED imaging of RSV viral particles along filopodia. A549 cells were infected with RSV (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) for 24 h. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with antibodies for RSV F (green); the cellular tubulin network was visualized by staining for beta tubulin (cyan). These cells were further stained with rhodamine phalloidin to detect F-actin (red). All images were collected in a single focal plane as described in the imaging procedure. For confocal image acquisition (left panel), excitation wavelengths for the detection of RSV F (AF488), F-actin (rhodamine phalloidin), and tubulin (Atto 647N) were 488 nm, 561 nm, and 647 nm, respectively. The subsequent STED acquisition (middle panel) was done in the following order: first, the Atto 647N conjugate used for tubulin immunostaining was excited with 647 nm and depleted with 775 nm; then, to visualize F-actin, rhodamine phalloidin was excited with 561 nm and depleted with 660 nm; and finally, the AF488 conjugate used for RSV F specific immunostaining was excited with 488 nm and depleted with 592 nm. Filopodia (indicated by arrows on the bottom left image) appear to shuttle RSV particles towards a neighboring cell (marked with a * in the bottom left image).",
    "An increase in resolution of all channels is apparent with STED imaging, which can be further improved by deconvolution using Huygens software (STED decon, right panel). Scale bar = 3 µm, inset scale bar = 1 µm. Gated HyD detectors were used to collect an emission bandwidth of approximately 40 nm. All fluorophores were excited with a pulsed white light laser tuned to the appropriate wavelength. For confocal channel acquisition, AF488 was excited with 488 nm; rhodamine phalloidin was excited with 561 nm; and Atto 647N was excited with 647 nm. All HyD detector gating was set to 0.3-6 nsec. High intensity signals enabled the usage of low laser power settings, and single color controls were used to confirm the absence of background fluorescence. Of note, the laser power for confocal acquisition was set 3-5 fold lower than for STED acquisition. Photobleaching during confocal acquisition was negligible.Photon depletion occurs when some overlap exists between the STED laser wavelength and the emission spectrum of the fluorophore. Thus, for STED channel acquisition (subsequent to confocal acquisition), AF488 was excited with 488 nm and photon depleted with 592 nm with 1.2-6 nsec HyD gating; rhodamine phalloidin was excited with 561 nm and depleted with 660 nm with 1-6 nsec HyD gating; and Atto 647N was excited with 647 nm and depleted with 775 nm with 0.6-6 nsec HyD gating. Caution needs to be taken to limit exposure of fluorophores to a depletion laser if they can absorb energy at that specific wavelength (i.e., fluorophores that have excitation spectrums encompassing the wavelengths of the depletion lasers, 592 nm, 660 nm, or 775 nm). This is because the depletion laser output at the imaging plane is ~500-1,000 times greater than the excitation source, which will rapidly result in photobleaching.",
    "For example, Atto 647N will be photobleached by the 660 nm depletion laser, Alexa 594 will be photobleached by the 592 nm depletion laser, etc. Therefore, to avoid photobleaching, the collection order of the STED channels is of utmost importance, with longer wavelength fluorophores collected first and the shorter wavelengths collected last. In this experiment, the collection order of the STED channels was Atto 647N, followed by rhodamine phalloidin, and then AF488. Using single color controls, we confirmed that only the intended fluorophore was excited per each channel, and that neither cellular autofluorescence nor non-specific binding of the primary or secondary antibodies were detected. While confocal images were collected with a pinhole set to 1 Airy Unit (AU), this was reduced to 0.7 AU for STED imaging to reduce optical sectioning and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, due to the strong depletion power, excitation powers were increased approximately 3-5 fold compared to confocal to compensate for signal loss. A frame accumulation of 2 was also used to further amplify the signal.Image processingSTED images were deconvolved using Huygens deconvolution software (Huygens Essentials v.17.040.p5, SVI BV, The Netherlands) to reverse the optical distortion created during image acquisition (Figure 2). Within this software package, we used the Deconvolution Wizard with automatic background subtraction and microscopic parameters recognition with a continued maximum likelihood estimate (CMLE) iterative algorithm. Processing parameters included microscopic and deconvolution parameters, which are important for proper point spread function (PSF) calculation necessary for successful deconvolution. Microscopic parameters were verified and corrected if necessary to avoid processing artifacts. The deconvolution parameters were adjusted in this Huygens deconvolution package as described below. This Huygens Essentials package was the only STED deconvolution package available at that time.",
    "However, there now are a number of software packages or free plug-ins available for classical confocal, multiphoton, or wide-field deconvolution applications.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170831/20170831001959_4814.jpgFigure 2. STED and deconvolution improve lateral resolution. To quantify the improvement in image resolution shown in Figure 1, we took the Gaussian profiles (bell curves) of signal intensity for a number of representative narrow structures and measured the width of the curve at the intensity level that is half of the maximum, which provided ‘full-width at half-maximum’ (FWHM) values. Smaller values of FWHM indicate improved resolution. This was done for five structures from each channel (green: virus filaments (RSV F), red: actin filaments, and cyan: tubulin filaments). The same structures were measured in confocal, STED, and STED deconvolved (STED decon) images. For each stain, STED significantly improved resolution compared to confocal microscopy, and resolution was further improved by deconvolution. Error bars represent standard deviation. STED resolution was improved in Huygens Essentials by using settings for background subtraction, for the number of iterations, and for the desired signal-to-noise ratios that were determined empirically after several rounds of iterations. For RSV F, these values were 0.0316 for background subtraction, 54 for the number of iterations, and 18 for the signal-to-noise ratio. For F-actin, these values were 0.0695, 46, and 19, respectively. For tubulin, these values were 0.0835, 49, and 20, respectively. Deconvolved images were thoroughly compared with the original raw image to avoid artifacts such as striping, ringing, or discontinuous staining.Additional deconvolution parameters were set in Huygens Essentials to account for the expected amount by which the fluorescence is suppressed by the STED beam (STED saturation factor) and the expected fraction of fluorescent molecules that is photoresistant to the depletion beam (STED immunity fraction). The STED saturation factor is the absolute intensity of the STED laser divided by the saturation intensity.",
    "For the maximum intensity STED laser, the saturation factor is 30, and it is scaled based on the STED laser intensity. The STED immunity fraction is the fraction of the fluorophores that has not been depleted by the STED laser. It is described as an additional confocal PSF component that is added to the pure STED PSF and is estimated in percentage of the maximum saturation. It has only a minor influence on the quality of deconvolved images, and typical values are around 10%. For RSV F, these values were 30 for the STED saturation factor, and 14 for the STED immunity fraction. For F-actin, these values were 27 and 10, respectively. For tubulin, these values were 5 and 11, respectively."
