    "All animal procedures were performed with the approval of and in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Massachusetts General Hospital.\nCAUTION: This protocol involves the use of a class 3b laser (LG3). LG3 laser safety goggles must always be used when operating this laser. Appropriate training and safety guidelines must be followed to avoid the risk of injury.\n1. Design and Assembly of Laser\nConnect the light-emitting diode (LED) (405 nm, 19.3 mW, 1400 mA, fiber-coupled) to the LED driver via the 4-pin M8 connector cable that comes attached to the LED. Carefully tighten the screw to fasten the connection.\nBefore attaching the optogenetics patch cable to the LED, hold the connector opening of the LED up to the light to ensure there are no visible obstructions. Blow on the hole to eliminate any obstructions if necessary and insert the optogenetics patch cable into the opening.\nConnect the fiber optic cannula to the optogenetics patch cable by inserting the cannula into either end of the connector sleeve. Attach the other end of the connector sleeve to the patch cable.  Apply enough pressure to secure the connection but be careful to not bend or break the optical fiber in the cannula.\n\tNOTE: The fragile fiber optic cannula is covered with the protective cap whenever the laser is not in use.\nSet the LED driver to the continuous wave (CW) mode with the continuous adjustment knob at 0 and the current limit set to 1.2 A.\n2. Photoconversion of Cells in the Colon\nNOTE: Male and female mice were exposed to intracolonic 405 nm light 1 - 2 day(s) after their birth and were sacrificed prior to 1 week of age.",
    "Secure a dark location with an access to an electrical outlet. Plug the LED driver into the outlet.\n\tNOTE: This procedure is performed in the minimal white light as a lengthy exposure of the mice to the ambient light may cause an unwanted photoconversion of cells. Red light is used as an alternative.\n\tCAUTION: The following step involves the use of an animal anesthetic. The administration of the anesthetic takes place in a Class II hood or by using another appropriate scavenging system. The inhalation of the anesthetic may cause dizziness, drowsiness, or even unconsciousness.\nAnesthetize the mouse by exposure to 4 - 5% isoflurane in 100% O2 in an induction box. Verify proper depth of anesthesia by firmly pinching a hind paw (no response). Maintain anesthesia via a nose cone at approximately 2% isoflurane. Prevent handler exposure to isoflurane by use of an appropriate hood or anesthetic scavenging device.\nPosition the anesthetized mouse for the intracolonic exposure by using 1 hand to scruff the back of the mouse gently with the index finger and thumb. Turn the mouse over to expose the abdomen. Loosen the grip if the mouse begins to lose its pink color or if its breathing rate begins to slow. Secure the tail of the mouse between the ring and little fingers.\nWith the other hand, remove the protective cap from the cannula. While maintaining the long axis of the cannula parallel to the mouse's midline, gently insert the fiber optic cannula through the anus into the colon so that all 5 mm of the optical fiber are inside the mouse.\n\tNOTE: This procedure is performed slowly and with care not to perforate the colonic wall. Minute wiggling and twisting of the cannula aids the advancement into the colon.",
    "Don the safety goggles and increase the laser current to the maximum value (all the way clockwise). Confirm the presence of UV light by looking at the translucent abdomen of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: The LG3 laser safety goggles dramatically decrease visibility. Have a colleague (wearing protective equipment) assist in donning the goggles and turning on the laser.\nExpose the colon to the laser light for a total of 2 min. Withdraw the cannula approximately 1 mm every 30 s to maximize the luminal area exposed to the light. At the end of 2 min, turn the laser off.\nSlowly remove the cannula from the mouse. After recovering from anesthesia in an empty warm cage, return the mouse to the home cage. \n3. Isolation of Intestinal Lymphocytes\nPrepare 1 L of the Hank's Balanced Salt Solution/calf serum (HBSS/CS) buffer, 200 mL of epithelial strip buffer, 500 mL of wash media, and 200 mL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free wash media.\n\tNOTE: The reagent volumes are calculated for a sample size of 9.\n\t\nMake the HBSS/CS buffer (HBSS; 5% CS) by adding 50 mL of CS to 950 mL of HBSS. Store it on ice.\nPrepare the epithelial strip buffer [HBSS; 5% CS; 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT); 5 mM EDTA; 15 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.2 - 7.5)] by adding 10 mL of CS, 200 µL of 1 M DTT, 2 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, and 3 mL of 1 M HEPES buffer to 185 mL of HBSS. Place the epithelial strip buffer in a 37 °C water bath.\nMake the wash media (HBSS; 1% CS; 1 mM EDTA) by adding 5 mL of CS and 1 mL of 0.5 M EDTA to 494 mL of HBSS. Store it at room temperature.",
    "Prepare the EDTA-free wash media (HBSS; 1% CS; 15 mM HEPES) by adding 2 mL of CS and 3 mL of 1 M HEPES to 195 mL of HBSS. Store it at room temperature.\nMake a FACS buffer [1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.2); 2% CS] by adding 10 mL of CS to 490 mL of PBS. Store it on ice.\nPrepare the tissue collection dish by placing a 70 µm cell strainer inside a 60 x 10 mm culture dish. Add 10 mL of HBSS/CS buffer (HBSS; 5% CS buffer made in step 3.1.1 and stored on ice) to the dish and place it on the ice.\nEuthanize the mouse via an overdose of inhaled isoflurane using appropriate scavenging of anesthetic (an approximately 3 min exposure to >4% isoflurane in the room air or in 100% O2). After apparent cessation of breathing and reflex movement, verify the absence of deep pain by firmly pinching a hind paw (using forceps is recommended). Ensure the euthanasia via a decapitation using either a pair of surgical scissors or a new straight razor.\n\tNOTE: Cervical dislocation is not recommended for this step due to the size and age of the animal. These methods are consistent with the 2013 AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia and approved by the MGH IACUC.\nHarvest the colon using clean forceps and scissors to open the abdomen. Reflect the intestines to 1 side of the mouse's abdomen to expose the colon. Remove the whole colon by first transecting it just distal (toward the anus) to the cecum. Then, while firmly grasping the colon with forceps, use scissors to cut through the urethra to the rectum. Cut the colon as close to the anus as possible. Harvest the spleen after removing the colon (see steps 4.1 - 4.2 below).",
    "NOTE: While the photoconversion protocol only targets ~25% of the newborn's colon (5 mm of the fiber optic cannula), the entire colon is harvested to aid in the cell isolation.\nClean the colon by using forceps to push the contents out of the colon and onto a dry paper towel. Homogenize the tissue by using razor blades to finely chop the colon into a paste on the cover of a culture dish and then transfer this paste to the cell strainer in the Petri dish.\nAdd a clean 8 mm long magnetic stir bar to the strainer and place the dish on a 9-position magnetic stirrer plate. Set the magnetic stir bar speed to 800 rpm and incubate the cells for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the buffer and repeat the wash using 10 mL of HBSS/CS (the HBSS; 5% CS buffer made in step 3.1.1 and stored on ice). Discard the buffer at the end of the wash.\nDissociate the epithelial cells by adding 10 mL of prewarmed epithelial strip buffer (the HBSS; 5% CS; 1mM DTT; 5mM EDTA; 15mM HEPES [pH 7.2 - 7.5] buffer that was made in step 3.1.2 and stored in a 37 °C water bath) to the cell strainer and stir at 800 rpm for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator. At the end of the incubation, transfer the buffer enriched in the epithelial fraction to a clean 15 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: The epithelium and associated cells (intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal epithelial lymphocytes) are released into the buffer, while the cells in the intact lamina propria remain on the cell strainer during this step11.",
    "Centrifuge the enriched intestinal epithelial fraction (IELs) at 700 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of FACS buffer. Store it on the ice for use in step 3.15.\nWash the lamina propria fraction within the cell strainer 2x with HBSS/CS. To do so, add 10 mL of HBSS/CS solution (HBSS; 5% CS buffer that was made in step 3.1.1 that has been stored on ice) to the cell strainer and stir it at 800 rpm for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator. Discard the buffer after each wash.\nWash the sample 2x in wash media. Add 10 mL of wash media (HBSS; 1% CS; 1 mM EDTA buffer that was made in step 3.1.3 and stored at room temperature) to the cell strainer and stir it at 800 rpm for 15 min in a 37 °C incubator. Discard the buffer after each wash.\n\t\nAfter using the wash media, store it on the ice for the use in step 3.14.\nWash the sample 2x with HBSS/CS. Add 10 mL of HBSS/CS buffer (HBSS; 5% CS buffer made in step 3.1.1 that has been stored on ice) to the cell strainer and stir it at 800 rpm for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator. Discard the buffer after each wash.\nIncubate the tissue in EDTA-free wash buffer. Add 10 mL of EDTA-free wash buffer (HBSS; 1% CS; 15 mM HEPES buffer that was made in step 3.1.4 and stored at room temperature) to the cell strainer and incubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature without stirring. Discard the buffer at the end of this step.",
    "Wash the sample 2x with HBSS/CS and prepare the enzyme solution. Add 10 mL of HBSS/CS (HBSS; 5% CS buffer made in step 3.1.1 that has been stored on ice) buffer to the cell strainer and stir it at 800 rpm for 10 min in a 37 °C incubator. Discard the buffer after each wash.\n\t\nPrepare the enzyme solution (EDTA-free wash buffer; 0.1 mg/mL DNase I; 167 mg/mL collagenase) during the second wash period: add 9 mg of DNase I and 15 mg of lyophilized collagenase to 90 mL of EDTA-free wash buffer. Store the solution at room temperature.\nDigest the lamina propria fraction contained in the cell strainer to obtain lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs). Add 10 mL of the enzyme solution (the EDTA-free wash buffer; 0.1 mg/mL DNase I; 167 mg/mL collagenase buffer made in step 3.12.1 and stored at room temperature) to the cell strainer and stir it at 800 rpm for 45 min in a 37 °C incubator.\n\tNOTE: LPLs are released into the solution after the enzymatic digestion.\n\t\nCollect the enzyme solution containing the cells and filter it through a new cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 20 mL of cold wash media (the HBSS; 1% CS; 1mM EDTA buffer made in step 3.1.3 and stored on ice in step 3.9.1) to the filtered cells to block the collagenase activity in the enzyme solution. Centrifuge the tube at 700 x g for 6 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet containing LPLs in 1 mL of FACS buffer.\nCombine the IEL (from step 3.7.1) and the LPL (from step 3.14) fractions and stain them with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for the flow cytometric analysis (see step 5).\n\tNOTE: IEL and LPL fractions may be stained separately if compartment information is desired.",
    "4. Isolation of Lymphocytes from the Spleen\nPrepare the collection tube by adding 500 µL of FACS buffer into a microcentrifuge tube. Store it on the ice.\nAfter removing the colon (step 3.4), harvest the whole spleen and place it in the collection tube. Store the tissue on ice.\nUsing an electric tissue homogenizer, homogenize the spleen in a microcentrifuge tube for approximately 1 min. Centrifuge the sample at 300 x g [micro centrifuge] for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate off the supernatant.\nPerform the red blood cell lysis by resuspending the sample in 500 µL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to initiate cell death by osmotic lysis. Allow the sample to incubate 1 - 2 min at room temperature and then resuspend it in 725 µL of FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the sample at 300 x g [micro centrifuge] for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate off the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of FACS buffer and filter it through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new microcentrifuge tube. Transfer the whole sample to a new microcentrifuge tube and stain it with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for the flow cytometric analysis (see step 5).\n5. Identification of Dendra-r+ Cells Using Flow Cytometry\nCentrifuge the IEL/LPL and spleen samples at 300 x g [micro centrifuge] for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate off the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets in 100 µL of antibody staining mix. Prepare the antibody staining mix by adding 1 µL of fluorescently-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody to 100 µL of FACS buffer per sample.\n\tNOTE: It is important to titrate the antibodies used for the flow cytometry prior to the experiment to determine the optimal concentration where binding saturation occurs.\nIncubate the samples for 35 min on ice (in a dark location).",
    "Resuspend the samples in 300 µL of FACS buffer and centrifuge them at 300 x g [micro centrifuge] for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the samples in 325 µL of FACS buffer. Analyze the samples on a flow cytometer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
