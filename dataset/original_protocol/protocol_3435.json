We provide peptide and SRM run parameter details in Tables S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx], S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc2.xlsx], and S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc3.xlsx] that can be directly used for this section of the protocol. We also detail the necessary step of determining analytical parameters for these assays using your laboratory setup.\nObtain at least two highly pure SIL peptides corresponding to the proteins you wish to measure from Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx].\nSIL peptides must contain isotopically heavy Lysine or Arginine. This protocol employs peptides containing Lys-[13C6, 15N2] or Arg-[13C6, 15N4].\nSIL peptides must be accurately quantified. Amino acid analysis can be used for peptide quantification.\nSIL peptides should be >97% pure.\nNote: AQUA peptides (Gerber et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) meet these criteria and can by commercially synthesized. Alternatively, SIL peptides can be synthesized and quantified in house.\nCritical: Aliquot SIL peptides to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Stocks should be stored at −80°C.\nNote: Numerous resources are available should you wish to use additional peptides to quantify these TFs or to quantify additional TFs by SRM, including the SRM Atlas (Kusebauch et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), Peptide Atlas SRM Experiment Library (PASSEL) (Farrah et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), CPTAC Assay Portal (Whiteaker et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), Panorama Public (Sharma et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), MRMAssayDB (Bhowmick et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), and Prosit (Gessulat et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). We also provide a list of peptides and SRM run parameters for measuring hemoglobin expression in Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc2.xlsx], along with a list of peptides and their parameters that we could not successfully measure in Table S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc3.xlsx].",
    "Note: A key step in SRM-based quantification of proteins is the initial selection of the peptides that will be used for quantification. While a number of resources are available to facilitate the selection of peptides for SRM analysis, it is often not possible to predict whether a peptide will be suitable for quantification in a particular biological matrix. Gillespie et al. describes an approach for selection of suitable peptides for quantification of TFs in nuclear extracts from erythroid cells.\nInsert transition information for the peptides you wish to measure from Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx] into Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nEdit → Insert → Transition List.\nPaste in relevant information. Do not include column headings.\nProtein Description column is not required.\nCheck for errors and click insert.\nNote: The MacCoss lab provides online tutorials, webinars, and courses detailing Skyline functionality (https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view[href=https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view]).\nExport a SIL-peptide-only scheduled transition list from Skyline.\nRemove light transitions (Refine → Advanced). Select “light” from the dropdown menu.\nSet the retention time window. Navigate to Settings → Peptide Settings. In the Prediction tab, set the Time Window to 5 min.\nFile → Export → Transition List.\nUse the below settings for export.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_322_13.csv\nCritical: The Agilent 6490 mass spectrometer cannot measure more than 200 transitions at a given time. Depending on transition number and retention time, Skyline may export multiple transition lists.\nUpdate the retention time values to match those from Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx].\nUpdate the collision energy values to match those from Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx]. These optimized values were obtained from the SRM Atlas (Kusebauch et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: Collision energy values need to be manually updated each time a transition file is exported.\nUpdate additional parameters in the transition list as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_322_14.csv",
    "Critical: We have experienced issues with mass incompatibilities between Skyline and Mass Hunter when including >1 decimal place. Do not use the “Decrease decimal” function in Excel, as this is only a visual change and does not change the actual number value.\nNote: The Fragmentor voltage (380 V) is defaulted in the mass spectrometer and cannot be overwritten. Therefore, do not bother changing this value.\nNote: When measuring SIL peptides, ensure the “ISTD?” column is TRUE.\nDetermine the linear range of quantification using dilutions of SIL peptides spiked into a constant amount of erythroid nuclear peptide extract. Use the below table to setup reactions.\nThe below table details reaction setup conditions to measure transitions exported from a single list. Scale reactions accordingly if multiple transition lists were exported in step 3.\nVolumes in the table are adjusted by a factor of 3.5 to allow for triplicate injections. The exception to this is the 0 fmol/μL SIL blank, for which a single replicate is sufficient.\nWe recommend including extra samples to verify retention times. This is indicated with an asterisk in the below reaction setup table.\nPrepare Lys-C-Trypsin-digested erythroid nuclear peptide samples, as described in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\nCreate an initial master stock containing 100 fmol/μL of each SIL peptide.\nFollowing Lys-C-Trypsin digestion of erythroid nuclear peptide samples, add SIL peptides.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_322_15.csv\nAcid precipitate the sodium deoxycholate with cold 1% TFA and purify peptides in supernatant by MCX SPE, as described in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\nResuspend each peptide sample in 21 μL SRM loading buffer.\nInject 6 μL per replicate into the mass spectrometer.\nSetup and run the mass spectrometer as outlined in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\nCopy-paste the refined scheduled transition list exported in step 3 into the QQQ Acquisition tab. Click Apply.",
    "At the bottom of the Acquisition window, set the cycle time for the mass spectrometer (i.e., 1,500–2,500 ms) such that the dwell time is between 15–20 ms. Click Apply.\nCritical: You must click Apply or else the settings will not update. Instrument software will not provide a warning for this.\nNote: We do not recommend setting a dwell time below 12 ms. The difference between cycle and dwell time is described in Lange 2008 (Lange et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nImport and analyze resulting data from step 4 in Skyline (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Extracted ion chromatograms of different SIL peptide dilutions spiked into an isotopically light biological sample\nNote that transition rank order is preserved in all peaks, and retention times overlap between corresponding SIL and light peptides. For visibility, a different y axis was used for the last three SIL peptide dilutions.\nImport your mass spectrometry results (File → Import → Results) back into Skyline.\nEnsure the correct peaks are identified.\nTransition intensities must exhibit a dose response.\nTransition intensity rank order should match between dilutions and replicates.\nExport a transition results report (File → Export → Report → Transition Results). The area column contains the background subtracted area-under-the-curve values for each transition peak.\nNote: The Height column contains the background subtracted maximum intensity for each transition peak. If desired, these values can be used instead of the peak area values.\nPlot calibration curves and determine the linear range of quantification using regression.\nUsing spreadsheet or data analysis software (i.e., Microsoft Excel, R), sum the two largest transition peak area values. This calculation should be performed separately for each replicate.",
    "Log transform the resulting data, and plot vs. the log-transformed theoretical SIL peptide concentration (from step 4). The SIL peptide concentrations must be corrected for the purity of each peptide.\nCreate a regression line.\nDetermine the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). This is the lowest concentration of SIL peptide that can be quantified with a coefficient of variation (CV) <20% (Kuzyk et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nDetermine the upper LOQ (ULOQ), which is the highest SIL peptide concentration quantified that maintains a linear dose response.\nThe linear range of quantification is defined as the ULOQ-LLOQ.\nNote: The limit of detection (LOD), which represents the lowest SIL peptide concentration that can be measured above background noise, can be calculated as the LLOQ/3 (Mani et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAbsolute quantification of TF proteins in erythroid time course samples by SRM\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nThis protocol outlines the steps to determine the absolute concentration of endogenous transcription factors in erythroid nuclear extracts by SRM. We calculate these by comparing the transition ion intensities of endogenous, isotopically light, target peptides to the transition ion intensities of their isotopically heavy SIL peptide counterparts of known concentrations. We characterize these methods as peptide-based protein absolute quantifications.\nExport a refined scheduled transition list to measure both SIL peptides and isotopically light peptides from your biological samples, as described in steps 3c and d.\nRetention times were verified and updated in steps 4–5.\nPrior to export, add back light transitions (Refine → Advanced). Click the “Add” box and select “light” from the dropdown menu.\nUpdate the transition list(s) as described in steps 3f and g.\nDigest erythroid nuclear protein extracts from all your time course samples with Lys-C and Trypsin, as described in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]. SIL peptides will be added in step 8.",
    "Use 7.5 μg nuclear protein extract per sample and per technical replicate.\nThe number of samples required depends on the number of transition lists exported in step 6 and the number of replicates you wish to perform.\nNote: It is not necessary to measure all biological replicates at the same time. The addition of SIL peptides will help account for sample preparation and machine variability.\nNote: While technical replicates are ideal, they may not be feasible if sample is limited and/or costly.\nAdd concentration matched SIL peptides to each sample.\nConcentration ranges are provided in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Mmc1.xlsx].\nPeptides from the same protein should be added at the same concentration.\nNote: If sample if not limiting, we recommend adding three different concentrations of SIL peptides to different samples. This will allow you to use a multi-point calibration curve to calculate the abundances of endogenous erythroid peptides and proteins.\nAcid precipitate the sodium deoxycholate with cold 1% TFA and purify peptides in supernatant by MCX SPE, as described in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\nResuspend each sample in 7x μL of SRM loading buffer, where x represents the number of technical replicates.\nInject 6 μL per replicate into the mass spectrometer.\nSetup and run the mass spectrometer as outlined in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin].\nCopy-paste the refined scheduled transition list exported in step 6 into the QQQ Acquisition tab.\nCritical: We highly recommend leaving the retention time window set at 5 min. The composition of your samples can change significantly over the time course.\nImport and analyze resulting data in Skyline, similar to step 5.\nCritical: Transitions that do not follow the below criteria are likely subject to interference and therefore not reliable for quantification. They should not be included in further analyses.\nTransition elution peak profiles should be approximately bell shaped.",
    "The transition intensity rank order for each peptide should be consistent between samples and replicates.\nThe transition retention times for both the heavy and light isotope versions of the same peptide should be identical within a sample.\nRetention times may differ between samples, depending on the similarity of the samples.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] illustrates examples of poor data quality.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/322-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Extracted ion chromatograms showing examples of poor data quality\n(A) Low abundance, noisy transitions with no clear peak or alignment of retention times\n(B) Transition rank order differs between measurements, and the y5+ peak is subject to interference.\nExport transition results reports as described in step 5c."
