    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of patient-derived CRC organoids from primary tumor tissues\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section, we describe the method used to isolate and prepare tumor organoids from freshly resected human CRC tissues (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The following protocol is an adaptation of our previously developed CTOS method, in which cell–cell contacts are maintained throughout organoid preparation, culture, and passage.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids from primary tumor tissue\n(A) Schematic overview of the cancer tissue-originated spheroid method.\n(B) Images of tumor fragments dissected into small pieces.\n(C) Image of the mesh filters (hole size 500, 250, and 40 μm, respectively) and the 50 mL conical tubes.\n(D–F) Representative phase-contrast images of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor organoids growing in suspension. (D) Image of the tumor fragments immediately after preparation. (E) Image of CRC organoids one day after preparation. (F) Image of CRC organoids immediately after disruption. Scale bar = 100 μm.\nNote: Fresh primary CRC tissues obtained from the surgical samples or xenograft tumor were preserved on ice in a 50 mL conical tube (or equivalent) containing 15 mL of fresh DMEM/Ham’s F12 medium or a physiological saline solution (such as HBSS buffer), supplemented with 100 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin (150 μL).\nCollect a fresh surgical CRC sample as described above and immediately proceed to tissue dissociation in a biological safety cabinet.\nTransfer the CRC sample to a 90 mm petri dish and, utilizing tweezers to immobilize the tumor fragment; apply a scalpel to cut the tumor fragment into pieces less than 2 mm in size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: Tumor samples were cut into smaller pieces to prevent excessive tissue damage.",
    "Wash the minced tumor fragments with 20 mL of HBSS buffer, gently mix up and down a couple of times, and transfer to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nAfter waiting approximately 1 min for the tumor fragments to sink to the bottom, discard the supernatant (composed mainly of blood cells, single cells, and debris).\nResuspend the tumor fragments with 10 mL of the tumor dissociation solution.\nNote: To successfully maintain the cell–cell contact, we used Liberase™ DH as a blend of digestion enzymes.\nTransfer the minced tumor fragment suspension to a 100 mL sterile conical flask with a magnet bar.\nTo digest the tumor tissue, incubate the sample for ∼15–30 min in a 37°C water bath with constant stirring (700 rpm); adding 10 μL of DNase I for the last 15 min of incubation.\nCritical: Digestion time depends on the CRC sample. In some cases, it can be up to 60 min. Excessive digestion decreases the yield of the organoid preparations. The decision to stop the digestion step is based on visual inspection by the researchers and their judgement regarding the size of the tumor clusters by checking under a microscope and observing the conical flask containing the tumor fragment suspension. Therefore, researchers should carefully monitor the progression of digestion. In the CTOS method, avoiding complete tissue dissociation into single cells is essential because over-digestion can cause significant cell damage.\nSerially strain the suspension of digested tumor fragments using mesh filters and 50 mL conical tubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPass the digested tumor suspension through a sterile stainless-steel wire mesh (hole size: 500 μm), and transfer the flow-through into the next mesh filter.\nWash the tumor fragments trapped in the mesh with 5 mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat these steps for each filtration step.",
    "Note: The following mesh filters can be applied in the following order. Stainless-steel wire mesh (hole size: 250 μm); 100-μm cell strainer (Falcon® Cell Strainers); 40-μm cell strainer (Falcon® Cell Strainers).\nCritical: When the number of tumor fragments is low, fewer filters should be used; for example, the 500- and 40-μm filters can be used to reduce material loss during the passage procedure.\nIndividually recover the tumor fragments, with a P1000 Pipette, in the fraction of 250–500, 100–250, and 40–100 μm with 1–2 mL of the CTOS organoid medium:\nTransfer the mesh filter containing the tumor fragments to a non-treated 60 mm Petri dish.\nAdd 1–2 mL of the CTOS organoid medium to the filter.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, scratch and collect the tumor fragments, and proceed to step 10.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused at this point if the user makes freeze-stocks of the collected tumor fragments. To freeze-stock the tumor organoids, use the StemCell Keep reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf[href=https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf]).\nNote: If the sample is frozen after step 9 of the protocol, proceed to step 10 after thawing and follow the protocol as described.\nTransfer the collected tumor fragments to a non-treated 6-well plate dish containing 2–3 mL of CTOS organoid medium per well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: If only a few tumor fragments are obtained, a smaller plate such as a 12-well plate is used. Confluency is a crucial factor for organoid growth since it affects the nutrient and oxygen availability in cells. Approximately 50–100 fragments are seeded in 2–3 mL of CTOS organoid medium. However, optimal confluency may vary for each CRC organoid. It is recommended to optimize it based on the growth rate, the size of the organoids, and/or the colour change of the medium.",
    "Incubate the culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C for 24 h. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nNote: After 12 h of culture, the tumor fragments became transparent and spherical with a smooth surface (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nMaintenance of the CRC organoids\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThis section describes the steps required to efficiently maintain, culture, passage, and expand CRC organoids for establishing CRC organoid lines. The following protocol is an adaptation of the methods described by Kondo et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nThe day after organoid preparation, CRC organoids should be washed twice with HBSS buffer to remove cellular debris.\nCollect the CRC organoids and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times, and wait approximately 1–2 min for the CRC organoids to sink to the bottom. Then, discard the supernatant (mainly composed of debris and/or dead cells).\nWash the CRC organoids with 1 mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat steps b and c.\nAdd 1 mL of CTOS organoid medium to the CRC organoids, and transfer them to a non-treated 6-well plate dish containing 2–3 mL of CTOS organoid medium per well.\nIncubate the organoid culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C for 6 days. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: Once established, CRC organoid cultures are monitored daily and passaged once a week to expand and maintain their viability. CRC organoids can be cultured in suspension. Some CRC organoid lines might require the addition of Matrigel GFR and/or growth factors (e.g 100 μg/mL of bFGF and/or 10 μg/mL of Rho-kinase inhibitor) in the CTOS organoid medium to promote their growth and/or survival rate. The organoids may be embedded in Matrigel GFR (5 μL of Matrigel GFR containing 1 × 102 organoids) in the CTOS organoid medium, depending on their viability and growth rate.",
    "For passaging, CRC organoids should be dissociated using the syringe disruption method once a week13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]:\nOne week after the organoid preparation or the previous disruption step, or when the diameter of the spheroids reaches 200–300 μm, collect the CRC organoids and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times. After waiting approximately 1–2 min for the CRC organoids to sink to the bottom, discard the supernatant liquid (composed mainly of debris and/or dead cells).\nNote: If the CRC organoids do not settle at the bottom, one can subject them to centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C.\nWash the CRC organoids with 1 mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat steps b and c.\nAdd 200 μL of the CTOS organoid medium to the CRC organoids.\nDisrupt the CRC organoids into smaller fragments by passing them through a 1 mL syringe with a 27 G needle at a high flow rate (∼0.5 mL/s) ∼5–10 times. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nCritical: The number of syringe strokes required to disrupt the organoids may depend on the CRC organoid line. Excessive disruption leads to decreased organoid viability. To ensure proper disruption, bubble formation should be avoided during this step.\nResuspend the disrupted CRC organoids in a non-treated 6-well plate containing 2–3 mL of CTOS organoid medium per well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: CRC organoids are spontaneously re-formed from these fragments within hours.\nIncubate the culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C for 1 week.",
    "Note: Although this step depends on the seeding density of the CRC organoids, it is safer to replace the medium once every 3–4 days as a standard. If the organoids are in suspension, the plate can be swirled clockwise to allow them to gather at the centre of the plate. Using a P1000 pipette, carefully aspirate the old medium from the edge of the plate and replace it with fresh medium. Alternatively, one can pellet the organoids using centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C. After pelleting the organoids, carefully aspirate the old medium and resuspend them in a freshly prepared medium.\nCritical: The CRC organoids should be subjected to further experiments at least one day after passaging to avoid the influence of organoid disruption and remodelling.\nNote: Organoids prepared from freshly harvested primary CRC tumors should be cultured and expanded for 2–3 weeks before being subjected to SSFG assay. This step avoids contamination with stromal cells.\nWithin 2–3 passages, organoids should be freeze-stocked with StemCell Keep according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf[href=https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf]).\nNote: A CRC organoid ‘line’ is defined by the following criteria: i) growing continuously in culture, ii) generating xenograft tumor (at least two passages in vivo), and iii) being sufficiently freeze-stocked in order to reproduce the experiments.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nSingle-cell-derived spheroid-forming and growth (SSFG) assay\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nIn this section, we describe a phenotypically trackable cell culture system with single-cell resolution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The SSFG assay allows us to precisely track not only the capacity of spheroid formation but also the cell fate of growth of each spheroid-forming cell in CRC organoids with single-cell resolution. For the complete details of this protocol, please refer to Coppo et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

(2023).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCollect one hundred to a thousand CRC organoids and transfer into a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of HBSS buffer.\nNote: The SSFG assay can also be performed using a small number of organoids (e.g ten CRC organoids). Four hundred cells at least are required for the assay and a CRC organoid with a diameter of 100 μm approximately consists of ∼100 cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCentrifuge the CRC organoids at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the organoid pellet with 10 mL of HBSS buffer.\nCentrifuge the CRC organoids at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C, and then discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the organoid pellet. Using a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times, and incubate for ∼5–10 min at 37°C in a water bath.\nCritical: The incubation time with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA required to dissociate organoids into single cells may vary among CRC organoid lines. Excessive treatment impairs cell viability.\nMix the cell suspension by gently pipetting a hundred times to promote organoid dissociation into single cells. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nCritical: The number of pipetting steps required to promote cell dissociation varies among CRC organoid lines. Thus, the number of pipetting steps can be reduced to prevent cell death.",
    "Add 6 mL of the CTOS organoid medium to inactivate trypsin.\nAdd 8 μL of DNase I (10 μg/mL) and incubate for 1 min at 25°C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant liquid and wash the cell pellet with 10 mL of HBSS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C, and then discard the supernatant.\nCritical: It is essential to carefully remove the supernatant to avoid the loss of the cell pellet, which is invisible when working with a low number of CRC organoids.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of HBSS buffer and filter into a 5 mL round bottom tube with a 35-μm cell strainer cap in order to remove cell clusters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nKeep the cell suspension on ice and determine the cell count.\nCritical: To increase the probability of seeding cells at a ratio of one cell per well, it is essential to count the number of cells precisely. In addition, it is crucial to examine the single-cell status under a microscope. If organoid dissociation into single cells is incomplete and there are many small clusters, dissociation using steps 23–26 should be repeated.\nDilute ∼300–400 cells in a 20 mL cold SSFG medium. Keep the cell suspension on ice.\nNote: The amount of medium used depends on the experiment. For example, 20 mL of SSFG medium is required to seed a 384-well plate with 50 μL of medium per well. The amount of medium required may vary depending on the number of 384-well plates to be prepared, the number of cells to be seeded, or both (approximately 300–400 cells per plate).\nDispense the cell suspension into a sterile reagent reservoir and gently mix.",
    "Using an E1-ClipTip electronic pipette (or equivalent), seed the cell suspension into a non-treated 384-well plate with a ratio of one cell per well (50 μL/well) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 3 min at 25°C.\nNote: Centrifugation of the cell plate is used to concentrate the cells at the bottom of the U-bottom wells and eliminate any bubbles to facilitate picture acquisition in step 33.\nIncubate the plate in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C and culture for 2–3 weeks.\nNote: The growth rate of single cells may differ between different CRC organoid lines. The culture timing should be adjusted for each line.\nWithin 2 h of cell seeding (D0), the presence of one cell per well is strictly confirmed by image acquisition using a LEICA DMI4000B microscope equipped with Lumina Vision (or equivalent).\nNote: Lumina Vision equipment allows automatic image acquisition of the entire 384-well plate. Alternatively, the YAMAHA CELL HANDLER™ (https://global.yamaha-motor.com/business/hc/[href=https://global.yamaha-motor.com/business/hc/]) is an automated system that can be used to detect, select, and seed individual cells as well as for image acquisition.\nAfter 7 days of culture (D7), add 30 μL of fresh SSFG medium (without Y-27632) per well (total amount: 12 mL) using an E1-ClipTip electronic pipette (or equivalent) and a sterile reagent reservoir. Add the medium to the top of the 50 μL previously seeded (D0).\nThe growth of single cells into spheroids are monitored by image acquisition on different culture days (D0, D4, D7, and D14), as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nOptional: The spheroids are further cultured after D14 by adding the SSFG medium without Y-27632 (30 μL/well) until D20 when the growth rate of the CRC organoid line is low.",
    "Note: The spheroid-forming capacity (percentage of single cells which can grow and form spheroids) ranged from ∼19–59% in different CRC organoid lines.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nIsolation and culture of slow-growing cells from CRC organoids\nTiming: 1–2 months\nThis section describes the application of the SSFG assay to identify, isolate, and culture slow-growing cells from CRC organoids (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The SSFG assay revealed that the CRC organoids are composed of two types of cells: S-cells, generating small spheroids, and L-cells, generating large spheroids (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). For complete details regarding the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Coppo et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Isolation and culture of slow-growing cells from colorectal cancer organoids\nSchematic overview of the experiments to confirm the slow-growing phenotype of the isolated small spheroid clones.\nNote: To identify small and large spheroids, the results of the SSFG assay were quantified as described in the Quantification and Statistical Analysis section. Because each spheroid was strictly derived from a single cell, it can be called a clone.\nAt the end of the SSFG assay (D14 or D20), pick-up the small spheroids and individually transfer (one clone per well) into a well of a non-coated 96-well plate containing 100 μL of the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR.\nIncubate the spheroids in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C and culture for 2 weeks.\nNote: The slow-growing spheroids might be monitored daily, and the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR changed after one week of culture. The medium is replaced by carefully aspirating the old medium from the top using a P200 pipette, ensuring that the spheroids are not aspirated or lost. Following aspiration, fresh medium is added to each well.",
    "When the slow-growing spheroids reach a size of 3–4 × 105 μm2, individually dissociate them by the syringe disruption method as described in the section maintenance of the CRC organoids[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], step 13.\nCulture the disrupted spheroids (one clone per well) in 500 μL of the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR into a well of a non-coated 24-well plate.\nIncubate the spheroids in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37°C for 1 week.\nNote: The growth rates of slow-growing spheroids may differ among CRC organoid lines. The culture timing should be adjusted for each line. The organoids should be expanded to perform the next assays and to prepare sufficient freeze stocks.\nOnce isolated the slow-growing spheroids, a subsequent round of SSFG assay should be performed to confirm the slow-growing pattern.\nOne hundred organoids from a slow-growing clone are subjected to the SSFG assay, as described in the Single-cell-derived spheroid-forming and growth assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section.\nThe results are quantified as described in the section quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section, confirming the slow-growing phenotype."
