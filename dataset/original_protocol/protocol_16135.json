    "Materials\nE. coli BL21(DE3) or other suitable expression strain transformed with a plasmid encoding an NpuC*-tagged target expression construct as described in plasmid construction section\nLB medium (see recipe)\nAmpicillin stock, 100 mg/ml (see recipe; or appropriate antibiotic for expression plasmid and host)\nTerrific broth (TB) (see recipe)\nIsopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) stock, 1 M (see recipe)\nBinding buffer, pH 8.5 (see recipe)\nSDS-PAGE (Laemmli) sample loading buffer, 2× (see recipe)\n     \n250-ml Baffled flask\n37°C Shaking incubator\n15- and 50-ml Conical centrifuge tubes\nVortexer\nIce bucket\nSonicator\nMicrocentrifuge tubes\nHeat block set to 95°C\n1. Inoculate 2 ml LB medium (plus appropriate antibiotic; in this protocol we have used 100 μg/ml ampicillin) with a single colony of the expression strain. Grow 16 to 24 hr at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm.\n2. Inoculate a 250-ml baffled flask containing 25 ml of pre-warmed TB growth medium (plus appropriate antibiotic; in this protocol we have used 100 μg/ml ampicillin) with 250 μl of the overnight culture. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.6 to 0.8 (typically about 3 hr).\n3. Remove flask and induce expression by adding 1 M IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Grow at 37°C for an additional 3 hr, shaking at 200 rpm.\nInduction of target proteins cloned under T7-lac control are typically highly overexpressed and may aggregate and/or form inclusion bodies. When solubility of the target is problematic, it may be advisable to reduce the incubation temperature to 16°C and grow for 20 hr following IPTG induction.\n4. Transfer the culture to a 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge for 15 min at 6000 × g, 4°C.\n5. Discard the supernatant by decanting. Add 5 ml of pH 8.5 binding buffer to the pelleted cells and resuspend by vortexing.",
    "This step constitutes an optional pause point: harvested cell pellets may be frozen at −80°C and stored for use later. Cells frozen after resuspension in binding buffer should be thawed completely on ice before resuming the protocol at the next step.\nThe size of expression culture appropriate for purification is highly dependent on the expression level and solubility of the target protein being produced. For highly over-expressed, highly soluble targets, it is only necessary to use a fraction of the harvested cells for the described purification. In this case, the resuspended cell pellet can be aliquoted in fractions and frozen for use in additional purifications in the future. For example, for the model purification of streptokinase presented in this protocol, the cell suspension was aliquoted into five 1 ml fractions, of which one was used for the subsequent purification steps.\n6. Place the resuspended cells on ice and lyse via sonication in 30 sec pulses of 5 to 7 W, separated by 60 sec intermissions. Repeat for 8 to 10 cycles. Keep tubes on ice at all times. Avoid foaming.\nDiagnostic: Collect a whole lysate (WL) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the lysate to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\n7. Clarify the lysate by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C. Collect the supernatant in a clean 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and keep on ice.\nDiagnostic: Collect a clarified lysate (CL) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the clarified lysate to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.",
    "Most tagged proteins in the clarified lysate can be purified by using either the gravity column protocol or the column-free protocol. However, the column-free protocol is recommended for low-expressing proteins that require large expression volumes.",
    "Materials\niCapTagTM NpuN* intein resin (Protein Capture Science, cat. no. 05001002)\nRegeneration buffer (see recipe)\nColumn buffer, pH 8.5 (see recipe)\nSDS-PAGE (Laemmli) sample loading buffer, 2× (see recipe)\nWash buffer, pH 8.5 (see recipe)\nElution buffer, pH 6.2 (see recipe)\nEthanol, 20% (v/v)\n15% bis-Acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel\nSDS-PAGE running buffer (see recipe)\n      \n10-ml Gravity-flow chromatography column\n15 and 50-ml Conical centrifuge tubes\nMicrocentrifuge tubes\nHeat block set to 95°C\nMini-PROTEAN® tetra vertical electrophoresis cell (BioRad, cat. no. 1658004)\nPowerPac™ basic power supply (BioRad, cat. no. 1645050)\n1. While the lysate is clarifying, prepare a clean 10-ml gravity-flow chromatography column and plug the bottom (outlet) of the gravity column.\n2. Resuspend the 50% slurry of loose iCapTagTM NpuN* intein resin and pipet 2 ml into the empty column. Allow resin to settle at least 15 min.\n3. Remove bottom plug/cap and allow the 20% ethanol solution to drain through until the liquid level reaches the top of the resin bed.\nIMPORTANT: If the resin is being used for the first time, the resin must be stripped by suspending the resin in 10 column volumes (10 ml) of regeneration buffer (150 mM phosphoric acid) for a minimum of 30 min and then allow the regeneration buffer to drain out from the bottom of the column. Add 3 more column volumes of regeneration buffer to the top of the resin and allow to flow through. This step will remove the NpuC* tag bound to the NpuN* ligand for shipping and long-term storage. Failure to do so may result in no protein binding in subsequent steps. Further, do not allow the resin to dry out.",
    "4. Equilibrate the column by applying 20 column volumes (20 ml) of pH 8.5 column buffer and allow the buffer to run through the resin and drain into a waste container until the liquid level reaches the top of the resin bed.\nApply buffer to the top of the wall of the gravity column to avoid mixing/disturbing the packed resin bed.\n5. Replace the bottom outlet plug/cap until ready to begin the purification protocol.\nThe resin should be used as soon as possible after equilibration to avoid microbial contamination.\n6. Bind the sample by applying the full volume of the clarified lysate from step 7 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.901#cpz1901-prot-0001]. Allow the liquid to drain through the resin until the liquid level just reaches the top of the resin bed. Collect the flowthrough in a 15-ml conical tube.\nIMPORTANT: The flow rate of the protein solution through the column should allow for at least a two minute residence time in the column for adequate binding. As an example, for a 1 ml resin bed, the maximum flow rate should allow at most 1 ml of clarified lysate to flow through the column every two min, or a maximum 0.5 ml/min flow rate in this case. This can be accomplished by using a valve at the bottom of the column or by binding the initial protein load in bulk-binding mode as described below, where subsequent steps are performed in column mode. If these are impractical, it is also possible to recycle the flow-through 2 or 3 times to allow more binding of tagged target.",
    "Diagnostic: Collect a flow through (FT) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the collected flowthrough to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\nDiagnostic: If the lysate is recycled and loaded several times, collect a flow through (FT 2 or FT 3) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the collected 2nd-pass flowthrough to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\n7. Wash the column with 10 column volumes (10 ml) of pH 8.5 wash buffer. Allow the liquid to drain through the resin and out into a clean collection tube, until the liquid level just reaches the top of the resin bed.\nDiagnostic: Collect a wash phase pH 8.5 (W8.5) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the collected wash-phase flowthrough to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\n8. Shift the pH to induce cleaving by applying 10 column volumes (10 ml) of pH 6.2 elution buffer. Allow the liquid to drain through the resin and out into a clean collection tube, until the liquid level just reaches the top of the resin bed.\nDiagnostic: Collect a wash phase pH 6.2 (W6.2) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the collected wash-phase flowthrough to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.",
    "IMPORTANT: In order to maximize yield with minimal cleaving during the binding and pH shift, steps 13 through 15 can be performed in a cold room (at 4°C) and the column subsequently brought to room temperature for cleaving.\n9. Cap the bottom of the column and add 1 column volume (1 ml) of pH 6.2 elution buffer to the top of the resin bed. Cap the top of the column and incubate at room temperature for 5 hr. Be sure to note the current time. You could also pour the slurry into an empty 10-ml gravity-flow chromatography column and collect the FT to reduce potential carry-over of the beads.\nDiagnostic: Take time-point resin samples (RS: t hr). Using a wide-bore or cut pipet tip, resuspend the resin bed in the 1 column volume of elution buffer within the column by pipetting up and down until a homogenous suspension is reached. Transfer 20 μl of the slurry to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C. Recommended time points are 0 hr, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 5 hr.\n10. After 5 hr cleaving, elute the cleaved, purified protein from the column. Prepare a clean microcentrifuge tube marked as elution fraction 1 (E1) and place it below the column outlet. Then carefully remove the top and bottom caps from the column sequentially. Allow the contents to drain into the E1 collection tube. When the liquid level just reaches the top of the resin, cap the bottom of the column.",
    "11. Collect additional elution fractions by uncapping the column and adding 1 column volume of pH 6.2 elution buffer to the top of the column. Allow the contents to drain into a clean microcentrifuge tube marked as elution fraction 2 (E2). When the liquid level just reaches the top of the resin, cap the column. Repeat for up to 4 elution fractions.\nDiagnostic: Collect elution phase samples (E #) for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of each elution fraction to individual, clean microcentrifuge tubes and mix each immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\nDiagnostic: Collect a post-elution resin sample (RSf) by adding 1 column volume of pH 6.2 elution buffer. Using a wide-bore or cut pipet tip, resuspend the resin bed in the 1 column volume of elution buffer within the column by pipetting up and down until a homogenous suspension is reached. Transfer 20 μl of the slurry to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\n12. After the purification is complete, regenerate the resin by resuspending the resin in 10 column volumes of regeneration buffer for 30 min.\n13. Uncap the column and allow the remaining regeneration buffer to drain into a waste container.\n14. Wash the column by applying 20 column volumes (20 ml) of 20% (v/v) ethanol and allow the solution to drain to a waste container until the liquid level reaches the top of the resin bed.\n15. Add 3 column volumes of 20% ethanol solution to the resin and store the resin at 4°C. The stored resin can be reused for purifying other target proteins.\n16. Analyze expression and purification using SDS-PAGE (Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.901#cpz1901-bib-0009]).",
    "The gravity column method is best for well-expressed proteins, where a clear band of expressed protein is visible by SDS-PAGE in a cell lysate sample. In the alternate protocol presented below, rHb1.1 was not bound directly to a gravity column because the total volume of clarified cell lysate produced in step 7 is greater than the volume that can be easily loaded at less than 1 ml per minute of flow rate.",
    "Additional Materials\nAntifoam 204 (MilliporeSigma, cat. no. A8311)\n      \n2.5-L Ultra Yield® flasks (Thomson, cat. no. 931136-B)\n1-L Centrifuge bottles\n1. Inoculate two 10 ml LB medium overnight cultures (100 ug/ml ampicillin) with single colonies of the expression strain. Grow 16 to 24 hr at 37° C with shaking at 220 rpm.\n2. Combine all overnight cultures into a single sterile tube to ensure a uniform overnight culture. Inoculate two 2.5-L Ultra Yield® flasks containing 1 L of prewarmed complete TB growth media (containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.54 ml/L antifoam 204) with 10 ml of the uniform overnight culture. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 275 rpm until the OD600 reaches 2.0 to 4.0 (typically about 4 to 5 hr).\n3. Remove the flasks and shake at room temperature to cool. Induce expression by adding 1 M IPTG to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Grow at 25°C for an additional 18 hr, shaking at 275 rpm.\n4. Transfer the cultures from step 3 to two 1-L centrifuge bottles and centrifuge for 15 min at 8000 × g, 4°C. Discard the supernatant by decanting.\nPellets can be stored at −80°C for later use.\n5. Add 95 ml of pH 8.5 binding buffer per liter of cell culture to the pelleted cells and resuspend. Keep bottles of resuspended cells on ice.\n6. Pool all of the resuspended pellets together prior to sonication and keep them on ice. Using a large sonication probe, sonicate in 30 sec pulses of 5 to 7 W, separated by 30 sec intermissions. Repeat for 15 cycles.\nDiagnostic: Collect a whole lysate (WL) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the lysate to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.",
    "7. Centrifuge for 45 min at 18,000 × g, 4°C. Collect the supernatant in a clean, appropriately sized bottle depending on the volume of clarified lysate and keep on ice.\nDiagnostic: Collect a clarified lysate (CL) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the lysate to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\nOptional: Resuspend the leftover pellet in a volume equivalent to the volume of clarified lysate removed. Transfer 20 μl of the lysate to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 10 min at 95°C.",
    "Additional Materials\nGyratory rocker or tube rotator wheel\n1. Resuspend a 50% slurry of loose iCapTagTM NpuN* intein resin and pipet 4 ml into a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube (2 ml settled resin bed volume). Centrifuge the conical 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant without disturbing the resin bed.\nIMPORTANT: The amount of resin used is dependent on the volume and expression titer of the user's target protein. In this report, 1 ml of resin was used per liter of expression culture.\n2. If the resin is being used for the first time, add 10 resin bed volumes of regeneration buffer to the settled resin bed. Cap the conical centrifuge tube and slowly invert 10 to 20 times to completely resuspend the resin. Place the tube on a gyratory rocker to allow for 30 min of gentle mixing. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant without disturbing the settled resin bed.\nThe regeneration buffer consists of 150 mM phosphoric acid. The resin is stable to acid regeneration over at least 50 cycles (or possibly more) without a significant loss in performance.\nIf the resin has been previously used, step 2 may be skipped here, but should always be regenerated after use.\nA tube rotator wheel on a low setting (<20% max speed) may be used in the place of a gyratory rocker throughout the column-free protocol.\n3. Equilibrate the resin bed by adding 10 resin bed volumes of pH 8.5 column buffer. Cap the conical centrifuge tube and slowly invert 10 to 20 times to completely resuspend the resin. Place the tube on a gyratory rocker to allow for 10 min of gentle mixing.",
    "4. Gently mix and centrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant, taking special care to not disturb the settled resin bed. For clarified lysate volumes greater than the conical tube capacity, the resin may be resuspended in 2 resin bed volumes of pH 8.5 column buffer and the slurry can be aliquoted evenly into additional centrifuge tubes. The total volume of clarified lysate should be split evenly between the total number of conical centrifuge tubes.\nIt is recommended to leave some (<0.5 ml) of the binding buffer on the resin bed to prevent pipetting out resin particles at the top of the settled bed.\n5. Bind the sample by applying the full volume of the clarified lysate from step 7 of Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.901#cpz1901-prot-0003] to the resin. Mix the resin and the clarified lysate by gentle rocking on a gyratory rocker for 30 to 120 min at 4°C. Centrifuge the conical centrifuge tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant (flow through) without disturbing the resin bed. If multiple conical centrifuge tubes were used, leave approximately 1 resin bed volume of FT on the resin.

    "6. Wash the resin with 10 resin bed volumes of pH 8.5 wash buffer. Mix the resin and wash buffer by gently rocking on a gyratory rocker for 10 min. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the wash-phase supernatant (pH 8.5 wash) without disturbing the resin bed.\nDiagnostic: Collect a pH 8.5 wash (W8.5) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the collected wash-phase supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\nOptional: Additional wash steps using pH 8.5 wash buffer can be performed to increase the purity of the final product.\nFor temperature sensitive proteins, steps 10 to 13 can be performed in a cold room to minimize protein degradation and/or premature cleavage of the protein during washing and pH shift. This was done for rHb1.1.\n7. Shift the pH to induce cleaving by applying 10 resin bed volumes of pH 6.2 elution buffer. Mix the resin and the elution buffer by gentle rocking on a gyratory rocker for 10 min at 4°C. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant without disturbing the resin bed and collect in a 15-ml conical tube.\nDiagnostic: Collect a pH 6.2 wash (W6.2) sample for SDS-PAGE analysis.

    "8. Add 1 to 3 resin bed volumes of pH 6.2 elution buffer to the settled resin bed based on expected yield of the target protein. Incubate at room temperature by gentle rocking on a gyratory rocker for at least 5 hr. Be sure to note the start time.\nDiagnostic: Take time-point resin samples (RS: t hr) to allow future optimization of cleaving times for the target protein. Using a wide-bore or cut pipette tip, resuspend the resin bed in the 1 to 3 column volumes of elution buffer by pipetting up and down until a homogenous suspension is reached. Transfer 20 μl of the slurry to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C. Recommended time points are 0 hr, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 5 hr, and overnight.\n9. At the end of step 8, centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant containing the cleaved, purified protein without disturbing the resin bed and collect in a 15-ml conical tube.\nDiagnostic: Collect elution phase samples (E #) for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transfer 20 μl of the elution solution to clean microcentrifuge tubes and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.",
    "Diagnostic: Collect a post-elution resin sample (RSf) by adding 1 column volume of pH 6.2 elution buffer. Using a wide-bore or cut pipet tip, resuspend the resin bed in the 1 column volume of elution buffer within the tube by pipetting up and down until a homogenous suspension is reached. Transfer 20 μl of the slurry to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix immediately with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye. Heat immediately for 5 min at 95°C.\n10. After the purification is complete, add 10 resin bed volumes of regeneration buffer to the settled resin bed. Mix the resin and regeneration buffer by gentle rocking on a gyratory rocker for 30 min. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant containing the spent regeneration buffer without disturbing the resin bed and discard it. Repeat this process once more.\nThe resin can be stored in the regeneration buffer for a short-term period (about 2 weeks) without any significant loss in performance. For long term storage, the following steps are recommended.\n11. Add 10 resin bed volumes of 20% (v/v) ethanol and allow the resin to mix with the solution by gentle rocking on a gyratory rocker for 10 min. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Carefully pipet out the supernatant containing acidified ethanol.\n12. Add 1 resin bed volume of 20% (v/v) ethanol solution to the settled resin bed in the conical centrifuge tube and store at 4°C.\n13.
