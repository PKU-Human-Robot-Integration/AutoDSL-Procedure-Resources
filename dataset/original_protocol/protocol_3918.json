    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerform motor accumulation assay\nTiming: 40 min per sample\nKinesin-NeutrAvidin complexes purified in the previous step are loaded to a freshly formed SLB, and motor accumulation upon addition of microtubules is visualized using TIRF microscopy.\nMake solutions for the accumulation assay. The recipes listed below are enough for 3 assays. Keep the solutions at 20°C–24°C.\nIf performing accumulation assay in ATP:\nMotor buffer (2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM D-glucose): 969 μL BRB80 + 20 μL MgATP (100 mM) + 1 μL DTT (1 M) + 10 μL D-glucose (2 M)\nMotility buffer (1 μM taxol, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM D-glucose): 958 μL BRB80 + 1 μL taxol (1 mM) + 20 μL MgATP (100 mM) + 1 μL DTT (1 M) + 20 μL D-glucose (2 M)\nIf performing accumulation assay in AMPPNP:\nMotor buffer (1 mM DTT, 20 mM D-glucose): 989 μL BRB80 + 1 μL DTT (1 M) + 10 μL D-glucose (2 M)\nMotility buffer (1 μM taxol, 2 mM AMPPNP, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM D-glucose): 938 μL BRB80 + 1 μL taxol (1 mM) + 40 μL MgAMPPNP (50 mM) + 1 μL DTT (1 M) + 20 μL D-glucose (2 M)\nUse a plasma cleaner to treat one of the annealed coverslips on high RF level for 5 min. Meanwhile, allow the SUVs to come to 20°C–24°C.\nNote: The coverslips cleaned in 7× cleaning solution and annealed at high temperature already have hydrophilic and smooth surfaces. However, since dirt can easily accumulate on hydrophilic surfaces, we plasma clean the coverslip right before forming the SLB to ensure the hydrophilicity of the surface.",
    "Note: Allowing the cold solution to first equilibrate to room temperature avoids introducing air bubbles, which form as the solution temperature rises, to the SLB.\nCut a small piece of PDMS (∼1 cm × 1 cm, ∼1 mm thick) and use a 6 mm biopsy punch to cut a well in the center. Remove dust from the PDMS spacer by a piece of tape. Place the spacer on a plasma treated coverslip. A spacer free of dust should adhere to the coverslip by itself, which forms a sample well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nCritical: It is critical to use an inert material, such as PDMS, as the spacer. Double-sided tape is commonly used as a spacer between a coverslip and a glass slide to form a flow cell. However, the extensive rinsing of the chamber with buffers in this assay results in dissolution of the adhesives on the tape into the sample chamber, causing defects in the SLB. For example, high concentration of detergent can cause the formation of membrane tubules.\nAdd 50 μL of SUVs to the well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and incubate for 10 min. Meanwhile, transfer 55 μL active kinesin-NeutrAvidin mixture into a separate tube and allow it to equilibrate to 20°C–24°C.\nWash with 500 μL BRB80 in steps of 50 μL to remove excess SUVs. For each wash, add 50 μL BRB80 to the well, mix the solution by gently pipetting ∼5 times, then remove 50 μL solution from the well. There should always be 50 μL solution left in the well to prevent expose of the SLB to the air.\nWash the SLB with 300 μL motor buffer in steps of 50 μL.\nAdd 50 μL of active kinesin-NeutrAvidin complexes that have come to 20°C–24°C. Gently pipet a few times to mix. Incubate for 10 min.",
    "Wash with 250 μL motility buffer in steps of 50 μL.\nImmediately before imaging, add 50 μL motility buffer to the sample well to make a total volume of 100 μL. Add 1 μL of glucose oxidase and 1 μL of catalase (final concentration 0.02 mg/mL and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively) to the well, use a p100/p200 pipet (set to 50 μL) to gently mix the solution.\nCheck SLB quality by Atto 647N fluorescence and motor signal homogeneity by GFP fluorescence using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nTake snapshots of the GFP signal in 5 different regions. These snapshots will be used for motor density calculation later (see steps 14–17).\nCritical: Since only accumulation rate but not steady-state fluorescence intensity is needed for calculating the kon and koff (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]), it is not necessary to use the same frame rate for accumulation assays (step 12) carried out at different motor densities. However, the same exposure time must be used for capturing the snapshots to be used for motor density calculation.\nMove the sample to a new region. When the sample is in focus, add microtubules made in step 20a under the ‘Before you begin’ section (final concentration 16–32 nM), pipet quickly and gently to mix, then immediately start taking a video in the GFP channel. Once a video is finished, quickly find another region of interest and start taking the next video. We usually take 3 videos per sample. The frame rate and movie duration are chosen according to the binding kinetics. For kinesin-1 motors, we take 100-s videos at 10 fps. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]",
    "Note: The success of this assay relies on capturing as many newly landed microtubules as possible during the course of the video. It is best to first find a good field of view under the microscope, then add the microtubules and immediately start recording. The frequency of microtubule landing events drops very quickly, so only the first few videos contain information for analysis. Additionally, as more microtubules become engaged with motors, motor depletion may become a concern and free motor density can no longer be assumed constant. A microscope equipped with a drift correction system is helpful but not necessary for the success of the experiment. Our microscope is not equipped with a drift correction system, and we tape the coverslip to the stage to keep it stable. The thin PDMS spacer allows us to hold the pipette at an angle when adding and mixing solution in the sample well and seeing it from the side, both of which help to prevent drift caused by sample addition on the stage.\nNote: The final microtubule concentration needs to be adjusted based on the binding kinetics. A proper microtubule concentration should allow sufficient landing events to occur at the beginning of the assay, but prevent microtubule overlapping. This concentration range can be determined by pilot experiments where the density of gliding microtubules at steady state is observed at two extreme motor densities when varying amount of microtubules is added.\nNote: The correct imaging parameters need to be explored in trial experiments. The exposure time should be long enough that motor accumulation signal along microtubules at steady state is significantly higher than the background signal, and it needs to be short enough that ≥ 50 frames are captured before accumulation reaches steady state.",
    "Repeat accumulation assay at different motor densities. See step 14 for instructions on controlling motor density.\nQuantify motor density\nTiming: 40 min per sample\nMotor density can only be directly counted at extremely low densities; however, to achieve sufficient motor accumulation signal, most assays need to be carried out at high motor densities where direct counting is not feasible. Therefore, we first ensure that the mean GFP fluorescence scales linearly with surface motor density, and then directly count motor number at low density regimes and extrapolate to higher motor densities.\nFollow steps 1–10 to prepare samples. Motor densities on the SLBs can be controlled as follows:\nAt high motor densities, a saturating amount of kinesin-NeutrAvidin complexes (as in step 7) is added to the SLB, and motor density is controlled by the fraction of DSPE-PEG(2000) Biotin (0.1%–0.6%) in the SLB.\nAt low motor densities, SLBs containing 0.1% DSPE-PEG(2000) Biotin are incubated with kinesin-free NeutrAvidin spiked with varying amounts of kinesin-NeutrAvidin complexes (total concentration of kinesin-free NeutrAvidin and kinesin-NeutrAvidin is 50 nM), so that only a fraction of DSPE-PEG(2000) Biotin is occupied by kinesin motors. The desired low motor density range for accumulation assay depends on the biochemical properties of the motor. For kinesin-1 motors, we were able to observe motor accumulation when at least 5 nM kinesin-NeutrAvidin was added.\nFor each sample, take snapshots of the GFP signal in 5 different regions and calculate the mean intensity. Plot GFP intensity against the equivalent biotin concentration in the SLB (DSPE-PEG(2000) Biotin (%) × [kinesin-NeutrAvidin]/50 nM). If there is a linear relationship, it is valid to use the extrapolation method. Proceed with motor counting in the next step. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]",
    "Count the density of diffusing kinesin motors when individual molecules can be visualized. Under our conditions, we use 1/150 to 1/50 spiking ratios of kinesin-NeutrAvidin (0.3–1 nM) to free NeutrAvidin on SLBs containing 0.1% DSPE-PEG(2000) Biotin.\nBased on the counting result, extrapolate the numbers to high motor densities."
