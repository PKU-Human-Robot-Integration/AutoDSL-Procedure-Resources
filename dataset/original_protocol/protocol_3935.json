In this case, the inhibitors do not compete with ATP for their interactions with the kinase; hence for covalent inhibitors more pre-formed adduct formation and less available active kinase for subsequent JNK3 phosphorylation. Thus, apparent greater inhibitory potencies would be expected. The protocol below describes an experiment testing three inhibitors using fixed concentrations of 25 nM for MKK7 kinase, 30 μM for cov-JNK3 substrate and 100 μM for ATP with the layout of the assay plate shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The experimental plate layout for the 384-well assay plate used in the described protocol for assessing inhibitory potencies of three inhibitors\nSee also Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Mmc1.extension] for an example input for Echo® dose response pipetting, related to Step 5.\nThaw ADP-GloTM assay reagents. Place 10 mM ultra-pure ATP immediately on ice, while the other reagents can be kept at 22°C–25°C.\nQuick thaw MKK7 kinase and 10× cov-JNK3 substrate and spin both using benchtop centrifuge at high speed at 4°C for 10 min. Transfer clear supernatant into a new tube and keep on ice.\nPrepare 75 μL of 10× MKK7 kinase solution by diluting MKK7 to 250 nM in protein storage buffer. Keep the solution on ice until further use.\nPrepare the following mixtures and keep them on ice until further use.",
    "Mixture 1: one part of 10× MKK7 kinase solution, one part of 10× cov-JNK3 substrate and eight part of the reaction buffer. For example, 500 μL of Mixture 1 contains 50 μL of 10× MKK7 kinase solution, 50 μL of 10× cov-JNK3 substrate and 450 μL of the reaction buffer. This 500-μL Mixture 1 is adequate for approximately 100 reactions and will be used for the reactions containing inhibitors and the “Control DMSO only” wells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nMixture 2: one part of protein storage buffer, one part of 10× cov-JNK3 substrate and eight part of the reaction buffer. For example, 50 μL of Mixture 2 is made from 5 μL of protein storage buffer, 5 μL of 10× cov-JNK3 substrate and 45 μL of the reaction buffer. This 50-μL Mixture 2 is adequate for 10 reactions and is for the “Control No kinase” wells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nMixture 3: one part of 10× MKK7 kinase solution, one part of protein storage buffer and eight part of the reaction buffer. For example, 50 μL of Mixture 3 is made from 5 μL of 10× MKK7 kinase solution, 5 μL of protein storage buffer and 45 μL of reaction buffer. This 50-μL Mixture 3 is adequate for 10 reactions and is for the “Control No substrate” wells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])\nPrepare a serial dilution of inhibitors in a 384-well assay plate using the “Dose response” setting in Echo®550 acoustic liquid handler according to the manufacture’s manual. For this experiment, the dilution series of three inhibitors at 11 concentrations is prepared by the following steps (see also Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Mmc1.extension] for an example input for Echo® dose response pipetting):",
    "Prepare 5 mM inhibitor stock solutions in DMSO and transfer 25 μL of each into three different wells of an Echo® source plate. Fill the 4th well with 30 μL DMSO.\nUse the “Dose response” program in Echo® 550 liquid handler with a DMSO backfill option to aliquot the correct volumes of the inhibitors and DMSO into each reaction wells in the assay plate according to the plate layout in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Note that two intermediate compound dilutions will be created by the ECHO® dose response program (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Mmc1.extension] for an example input for Echo® dose response pipetting). 50 nL of DMSO should be transferred to each control well to ensure homogeneous assay conditions. The total transfer volume of 50 nL of either inhibitor alone, inhibitor plus DMSO or DMSO alone is fixed to ensure constant 1% final DMSO concentration (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Mmc1.extension] for an example input for Echo® dose response pipetting).\nImmediately add 4.9 μL of the mixtures from step 4 into the corresponding wells of the assay plate using a multichannel pipette as following (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for plate layout):\nMixture 2 for the three wells designated as “Control No kinase”.\nMixture 3 for the three wells designated as “Control No substrate”.\nMixture 1 for all wells with pre-added inhibitors and the three “Control DMSO only” wells.\nBriefly mix the kinase reactions by shaking the assay plate with a plate shaker (e.g., MixMate® plate shaker; 500 × g, 15 s), then incubate the reactions at 4°C for 30 min.\nAdd 50 nL of 10 mM ultra-pure ATP in all reactions to give 0.1 mM final concentration using the “Plate reformat” program in Echo®550 acoustic handler (refer to the manufacture’s manual).",
    "Briefly mix by shaking the assay plate using a plate shaker, then incubate the reactions at 4°C for 10 min (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAdd 5 μL of the ADP-GloTM Reagent in all wells using a multichannel pipette. Mix by shaking with a plate shaker, and subsequently incubate at 22°C–25°C for 40 min.\nAdd 10 μL of the Kinase Detection Reagent using a multichannel pipette. Mix by shaking with a plate shaker, and subsequently incubate at 22°C–25°C for another 40 min.\nMeasure luminescence using PheraStar FSX plate reader (or other alternatives that can measure luminescence). For high accuracy, we recommend either adjusting the gain setting of the plate reader based on the intensity of the “Control No kinase” wells to avoid saturation of the detector or using filters that only collect luminescence signal at certain wavelengths (referred to the manufacture’s protocol for detailed instructions).\nDetermine the IC50 values (see Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] and Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example of the results obtained from using the protocol for assessing three MKK7 inhibitors\nShown on the left and middle are the dose-response curves obtained from the experiments with and without kinase-inhibitor pre-incubation, respectively. The average IC50s with standard deviation from triplicates are shown on the right bar chart, depicting the shifts of potencies between two experiments typically expected for covalent inhibitors such as ibrutinib and CPT1-70-1 with the degree of changes varied depending on their ATP-competitive nature (∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicates Student’s t-test P values of <0.01 and <0.001, respectively). These data have also been described in Schröder et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/903-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. An example of dose-response fitting using either raw intensities (left) or normalized intensities (right) for IC50 determination",
    "Slight changes in the IC50 values might be expected due to the setting of minimum and maximum values at 0% and 100%, respectively, for the fitting of the normalized intensities, but both IC50 values should not be highly deviated for high accuracy assays determined by high Z′ factor.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_903_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_903_7.csv\nPlot the measured intensities (Y axis) against the inhibitor concentrations in logarithmic scale (X axis). If necessary, use the intensity values that are normalized against the “DMSO only” and “No kinase” controls (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis])\nUse dose-response fitting, e.g., “log (inhibitor) vs. response-Variable slope (four parameter)” fitting in GraphPad Prism software, to calculate IC50 values for the inhibitors.\nFor validation of the accuracy of the assays, we recommend calculating also the Z′ values (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nCritical: Due to the reactivity nature of covalent inhibitors, the addition of Mixture 1, 2 and 3 in step 6 must be completed as quickly as possible to ensure consistency regarding the kinase-inhibitor incubation time across the assay plate. We suggest that the solution transfer in this step should be first completed for all control wells for high accuracy of background measurement. In addition, it is important to maintain 1% DMSO in all reactions.\nIC50 determination using ADP-Glo assays without a pre-incubation step\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "This part of the protocol describes the other variation of the ADP-Glo assay, in which no kinase-inhibitor pre-incubation step is included and both covalent inhibitors and ATP are added into the reaction at the same time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In this scenario, the inhibitors compete with the physiological ATP substrate for their interactions with the kinase. Thus, this allows probing the ATP-competitive reversible binding of the covalent inhibitors. Lower inhibitory potencies compared to that obtained from the earlier assays with a pre-incubation step would be an expected outcome, especially for covalent inhibitors with weak ATP competitions of which the inhibitory efficacy is driven primarily by covalent mode of action. The protocol below should be performed in parallel with the above assays with a pre-incubation step, preferably on the same day with the same stock solutions and the same experimental designs.\nThaw ADP-GloTM assay reagents, MKK7 and 10× cov-JNK3 substrate as described in step 1 and 2.\nPrepare 75 μL of 10× MKK7 kinase solution by diluting MKK7 to 250 nM in protein storage buffer. Keep the solution on ice until further use (same as step 3).\nPrepare Mixture 1, 2 and 3 as described in step 4 and keep them on ice until further use.\nPrepare a serial dilution of inhibitors in a 384-well assay as described in step 5.\nAdd 50 nL of 10 mM ultra-pure ATP in all reactions to give 0.1 mM final concentration using the “Plate reformat” program in Echo®550 acoustic handler as described in step 8.\nImmediately add 4.9 μL of the mixtures from step 16 into the corresponding wells of the assay plate using a multichannel pipette as following:\nMixture 2 for the three wells designated as “Control No kinase”.\nMixture 3 for the three wells designated as “Control No substrate”.",
    "Mixture 1 for all wells with pre-added inhibitors and the three “Control DMSO only” wells.\nBriefly mix the kinase reactions by shaking the assay plate with a plate shaker, then incubate the reaction at 4°C for 10 min.\nAdd 5 μL of the ADP-GloTM Reagent into all wells using a multichannel pipette. Mix by shaking the assay plate on a plate shaker and subsequently incubate at 22°C–25°C for 40 min.\nAdd 10 μL of the Kinase Detection Reagent using a multi-channel pipette. Mix by shaking on a plate shaker and subsequently incubate at 22°C–25°C for another 40 min.\nMeasure luminescence using PheraStar FSX plate reader as described in step 12.\nDetermine the IC50 values using the same procedure as described in step 13.\nCritical: We highly recommend that both variants of the assays, with and without inhibitor pre-incubation, should be performed in parallel preferably on the same day using the same stock solutions of MKK7, cov-JNK3 substrate and ATP. Similar to the experiment with a pre-incubation step, the addition of Mixture 1, 2 and 3 in step 19 must be completed as quickly as possible to avoid variation regarding kinase-inhibitor-ATP incubation time across the assay plate. We suggest that the solution transfer in this step should be first completed for all control wells for high accuracy of background measurement. In addition, 1% DMSO should be kept constant in all reactions."
