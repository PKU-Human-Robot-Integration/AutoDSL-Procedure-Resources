    "All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants' families included in the study. All images and video clips were de-identified following the acquisition.\n1. Patient preparation\nSet up the ultrasound machine adjacent to the patient's cot and connect a three-lead electrocardiogram (see Table of Materials).\nInput the patient code and relevant details, such as body length and weight, and perform the echocardiogram according to the previously described standards12.\n2. Image acquisition\nSpecifically for BSI, obtain a shallow view of the LV in the apical four-chamber view with a narrow sector width, allowing an acquisition frame rate between 400-600 Hz.\nOpen a color box over the left ventricular cavity, narrow maximally to include only the region from the mitral valve to the endocardial apex, and from the septal endocardial border to the lateral wall endocardial border.\nIncrease the color gain to the point of speckling and reduce slightly. Set the color Doppler velocity scale limit to the appropriate diastolic velocity (20-30 cm/s in preterm infants) to maximally fill the color box with the slower-moving diastolic inflow.\nOn the touchscreen control panel of the equipment (see Table of Materials), tap BSI mode to reveal the intracardiac flow directions and vortices in RAW color format. Adjust the BSI box position and size to include the flow region of interest and record at least two cardiac cycles.\nRepeat the procedure in the apical LV long-axis view or other views where intracardiac hemodynamic assessment is required (Figure 2 and Figure 3).\n3. Image analyses",
    "NOTE: The image analysis techniques for the LV vortex have been briefly described in previous work from our laboratory11. The protocol used for assessing intracardiac vortices is as follows (Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nSave two cardiac cycles from each respective patient to external media in their RAW DICOM format and transfer to a laboratory station with an image processing software (see Table of Materials) installed for detailed offline analyses.\nOnce offline, identify the most prominent or main vortex.\n\tNOTE: The main vortex is visualized as an elongated, oval-shaped, anti-clockwise rotating structure located in the upper left quadrant of the left ventricle near the septum, with the maximum vortex area found in late diastole (during the transmitral A-wave) in preterm infants (Video 1). The main vortex is usually found during the transmitral E-wave for older infants and children.\nRecord the number of independent, complete oval-shaped vortices forming throughout the cardiac cycle for each clip.\nMeasure the position of the main vortex relative to known landmarks within the LV. To determine the Vortex depth, using the \"distance measurement\" tool on the analysis software, measure the vertical distance from the vortex eye to the middle of the mitral valve annulus. For Vortex transverse position, measure the horizontal distance from the vortex eye to the endocardial border of the interventricular septum.\nMeasure the vertical and horizontal edge-to-edge distances of the main vortex relative to the LV length and width to obtain the vortex shape.\n\tNOTE: This also enables estimation of the vortex sphericity index as length divided by width.\nUsing the \"tracing measurement\" tool on the analysis software, click on and trace the outermost vortex ring at the point where the main vortex is most prominent to determine the main vortex area.",
    "To assess Peak Vortex Formation Time (PVFT), record the cardiac frame when the vortex first appears (circular rings delineated) in the cardiac frame where the main vortex is most prominent and calculate the number of frames relative to the total number of frames in one cardiac cycle for the patient.\nTo assess vortex duration, measure the frames from which the vortex first appears when the vortex loses its circular ring formation. Vortex duration is then calculated as the number of frames relative to that patient's total number of frames in one cardiac cycle (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
