    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare the cells for imaging\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes the cell preparation for imaging. Different from regular cell culture, glass-bottom dishes are required to allow subsequent high-resolution imaging on an inverted microscope. In addition, a gelatin/fibronectin coating on the glass supports cell spreading allowing cells to be flatter, which improves the imaging of individual organelles and associated cytoskeleton. The transfection protocol follows that of our previous study.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCell seeding onto 35 mm glass-bottom dish with gelatin/fibronectin coat:\nRemove gelatin/fibronectin solution (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) and rinse the dish with 1.5 mL of PBS 3 times.\nSeed the cells with 2.0 × 105 cells/dish in 2 mL of total medium volume (approximately 20%–30% confluency).\nIncubate/Allow growth of the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16 h.\nDRP1 knock-down by siRNA transfection following manufacturer instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FLipofectamine_RNAiMAX_Reag_protocol.pdf] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2293-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic steps for siRNA preparation for one 35 mm glass-bottom dish\nDilute siRNA by mixing 3 μL of siRNA (10 μM in stock) and 150 μL of OptiMEM for each 35 mm glass-bottom dish.\nDilute Lipofectamine RNAiMAX by mixing 9 μL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and 150 μL of OptiMEM for each 35 mm glass-bottom dish.\nMix 150 μL of each diluted solution prepared by steps 2-a and 2-b and incubate 5 min at 20°C.\nAdd 250 μL of the mixture prepared in step 2-c above to the cells incubated on 35 mm glass-bottom dish, and gently swirl for 2 s to mix solutions.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16 h.\nNote: It is required to scale the total amount of solution to number of samples (dishes). Final amount of siRNA will be 25 pmol per 35 mm dish. Knock-down efficiency should be confirmed by Western blot as described in our previous study.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Transfection of plasmids (GFP-GJA1-20K and LifeAct-mCherry):\nAdd 125 μL of the plasmid solution (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) per dish with incubated cells.\nGently swirl for 2 s.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16 h.\nPreparation for live-cell imaging (mitochondria labeling)\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes mitochondrial labeling prior to imaging fission events. This step follows that of our previous study.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nWarm up the culture media and imaging media (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) at 37°C in water bath.\nDilute Mitotracker (1 mM of stock) to final concentration of 200 nM with warmed culture media (required 2 mL final volume per dish).\nRemove culture media from 35 mm glass-bottom dish and add the new media with Mitotracker.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20 min. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nGently, wash out Mitotracker by rinsing twice with imaging media (2 mL per rinse). Final volume of imaging media should be 2 mL per dish.\nSubject to live-cell imaging.\nNote: To avoid color contamination, Phenol Red Free culture medium is recommended as imaging medium. Aggressive wash cycles can affect cell adhesion.\nTime-lapse live-cell imaging\nTiming: 10 min or more (depending on sample size or experimental preference)\nThis step provides details on visualizing and acquisition of mitochondrial dynamics regulated by GJA1-20k and actin.\nSet up the imaging incubator connected to the stage of the confocal microscope (Microscope Incubator for gas and temperature control from Okolab; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nSet incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nSet the excitation laser power at 50% of 488 nm for GFP (GJA1-20k), 80% of 561 nm for LifeAct-mCherry (actin), and 40% of 647 nm for Mitotracker Deep Red (Mitochondria). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSet the exposure time for 100 ms for all channels.",
    "Focus 100× oil immersion objective on a cell with well distributed mitochondria. Image stacks will be over time at the same z-depth (i.e., once a mitochondria is in focus, maintain the same focal plane).\nObtain time-lapse images every 3 s (each color is taken in series and without delay, so there are three 100 ms images per 3 s imaging acquisition) for a total duration of 3–5 min. Approximately 10–20 areas containing one to three cells each are recommended to be captured per dish to observe distinct dynamics.\nCritical: Channel settings (laser power and exposure time) must be maintained between different samples to make sure the experiment is performed under the same conditions. Also, confirm the focal plane is at the fission point to capture the full fission event in a 2D image and without the need for time consuming z-stack imaging.\nNote: The imaging parameters (laser power, exposure time, and imaging duration) may need to be optimized depending on the experimental design and laser strength. High power, long exposure duration, or rapidly acquiring imaging without an interval of more than a second, will improve imaging resolution yet also induce photobleaching and cellular toxicity."
