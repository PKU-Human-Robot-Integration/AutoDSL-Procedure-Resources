    "1. Preparation of V. natriegens Crude Cell Extracts – Bacterial Culture\nPrepare V. natriegens bacterial growth media LB-V2 as per Table 1. Sterilize the growth media by autoclaving. Allow media to reach to room temperature (RT). Store excess media at RT.\nCAUTION: Wear proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and consult lab specific instructions when operating an autoclave.\nUse a glycerol stock of wild type V. natriegens to inoculate 3 mL of LB-V2 media. Grow overnight at 30 °C while shaking at 225 rpm.\nWash 1 mL of the overnight culture by centrifugation at 10,600 x g on a benchtop centrifuge for 1 min. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the resulting pellet and resuspend in 1 mL of fresh LB-V2 media.\nIn an autoclaved 4 L baffled Erlenmeyer flask with sterile cover, add 1 L of fresh LB-V2 growth media. Inoculate using 1 mL of washed overnight culture (1:1,000 dilution ratio). Grow culture at 30 °C while shaking at 225 rpm.\nNOTE: V. natriegens cultures can be scaled up or down while maintaining the 1:1,000 dilution ratio. For example, add 250 μL of washed overnight culture to 250 mL of fresh LB-V2 growth media in a 2 L baffled Erlenmeyer flask with sterile cover.\nMonitor the culture’s OD600 using a spectrophotometer. When culture reaches OD600 = 1.0 ± 0.2, harvest culture via centrifugation at 3,500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Place pellet on ice.\nNOTE: V. natriegens grows rapidly, so close monitoring of the culture is necessary. Growth to OD600 = 1.0 should take approximately 1.5−2 h at the 1:1,000 dilution ratio.\nAspirate the supernatant and immediately store the resultant bacterial pellet at -80 °C or directly proceed to cell lysis described in section 2.",
    "NOTE: This step is a good stopping point; however, it is recommended that the pellet be processed immediately or within 1−2 days for best results.\n2. Preparation of V. natriegens Crude Cell Extracts – Cell Lysis\nPrepare S30 lysis buffer as per Table 1 in sterile deionized (DI) water and adjust pH to 7.7 using glacial acetic acid.\nCAUTION: Glacial acetic acid should be handled with proper PPE when adjusting the pH.\nCool S30 lysis buffer to approximately 4 °C in a refrigerator or on ice before beginning the cell lysis procedure.\nNOTE: For a quick cool down, lysis buffer can be placed at -20 °C. Do not allow the buffer to freeze.\nPlace cell pellets on ice for 10−20 min or until completely thawed. Resuspend all pellets resulting from the same 1 L culture using 10 mL of cold S30 lysis buffer, then transfer suspension to a 50 mL tube. If pellets are not frozen in the freezer at -80 °C in step 1.6, proceed directly to resuspension.\nNOTE: Increase the volume of S30 lysis buffer used to initially resuspend pellets as needed.\nCentrifuge suspension at 3,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Wash the pellet a second time using 10 mL of cold S30 lysis buffer. Place pellet on ice.\nIn a cold room, add 500 μL of cold S30 lysis buffer to the pellet in the 50 mL tube. Using a wide-bore pipette tip, resuspend the pellet and carefully transfer the entire pellet suspension to a 2 mL tube.\nNOTE: If a wide bore pipette is not available, use a pair of scissors to cut the end of a 1 mL pipette tip to increase the bore for pellet transfer.",
    "Transfer as much pellet as possible without significantly increasing the volume; however, the pellet should be resuspended in enough liquid to be sonicated, as indicated by a homogenous suspension in the 2 mL tube. Do not overfill the 2 mL tube. The suspension should not exceed 1.5 mL; split into multiple tubes if necessary.\nKeep the cell pellet on ice and work in a cold room. Fill a 600 mL beaker with ice and place a 2 mL tube holder on top of the ice. \nNOTE: It is helpful to place the tube holder near the side of the beaker, so the pellet suspension will be visible in the ice to monitor sonication progress (see Figure 1).\nVortex suspended pellet in 2 mL tube briefly to homogenize the cells, flick tubes to remove any cells on the bottom of the cap, and place into tube holder with cap open. Lower sonicator tip into the suspension so that it is just under the liquid surface.\nPrepare the sonication set-up as depicted in Figure 2 using a sonicator and probe with a ⅛-inch tip diameter. Input the following settings into the sonicator control: 20 kHz frequency and 50% amplitude, pulse ON time: 10 s, pulse OFF time: 60 s.\nRun the pulse sonication protocol for three cycles. If the total volume of the pellet suspension is > 500 μL, run the pulse sonication protocol six times.",
    "NOTE: Generally, 3−6 pulses are sufficient to lyse V. natriegens pellets; additional pulses may be required depending on sonicator. During sonication, use the adjustment knob platform to move the probe up and down to lyse any pellet that may have settled to the bottom of the tube. The tube can be removed from the holder and briefly vortexed to re-homogenize the suspension in between pulses. See discussion below for desired consistency of sonicated cells.\nCAUTION: Wear appropriate hearing protection when sonicator is active.\nFollowing sonication, centrifuge crude cell extract at 16,000 x g for 30−45 min at 4 °C or until lysate is free of any cellular debris as depicted in Figure 3.\nIn a cold room, aliquot 50 μL of the resulting supernatants to new 2 mL tubes without disturbing the pellet.\n\tNOTE: Any debris that is transferred accidently into the new 2 mL tubes will drastically reduce extract’s capacity for high yielding protein synthesis.\n\t\nOptionally, set aside 10 μL of cell extract for post-lysis protein quantification in a separate 2 mL tube (see step 2.13 below).\nFlash freeze crude cell extracts by placing tubes into a tube holder with a dipping string attached as depicted in Figure 4. Submerge tubes into a Dewar containing liquid nitrogen and immediately place in a freezer at -80 °C until use.\nCAUTION: Use appropriate PPE for handling liquid nitrogen including lab coat, safety glasses, face shield, cryogen apron, and gloves.\nOptionally, quantify the total protein of the cell lysate using 10 μL set aside from step 2.11.1 by diluting sample 1:100 in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and using any standard total protein quantification assay such as Bradford assay, bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), etc.\n3. Preparation of Cell-free Reaction Components\nGeneral reaction components",
    "Prepare working stocks of Mg-glutamate and K-glutamate in 50 mL tubes with sterile DI water at concentrations of 100 mM and 2000 mM, respectively.\nPrepare a working stock of 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000 by adding 100 mL of sterile DI water to a 250 mL beaker. Place a small magnetic stirrer into the beaker. Weigh out 50 g of PEG-8000 and add to the 100 mL of water in the beaker.\nPlace the beaker on a heated stir plate set to 100 °C and stir at 250 rpm until PEG-8000 is in solution. Allow PEG-8000 liquid mixture to cool before transferring to 50 mL tubes.\nEnergy solution master mix\nPrepare a 5 M solution of KOH by adding 140 g of KOH pellets to 500 mL of sterile DI water.\nCAUTION: Prepare this solution in a chemical hood and wear PPE when handling strong bases. The solution will become hot so the bottle cap must be loose to prevent pressure build-up. Allow the KOH solution to reach RT before using.\nPrepare a 1750 mM HEPES-KOH buffer by adding 20.85 g of HEPES to a 100 mL bottle. Slowly add sterile DI water until the volume reaches 40 mL. Vortex bottle to dissolve the HEPES. Use the 5 M KOH solution to adjust the pH to 8.0 and then bring the solution volume to 50 mL.\nCAUTION: KOH should be handled with proper PPE when adjusting the pH.\nPrepare the remaining 10x energy master mix stock components at the concentrations indicated in Table 2 in sterile DI water and place each stock on ice. Thaw the 100 mM ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP stocks at RT and place on ice.",
    "NOTE: A thermomixer set to 37 °C and 350 rpm can be used to dissolve reagents into solution if necessary. Do not overheat or leave reagents on the thermomixer for an extended period of time.\nIn a 15 mL tube, add each energy solution master mix component in accordance to the order and volume specified in Table 2. Vortex the solution after each component is added. This will make 5 mL of 10x energy solution master mix.\nDivide the 10x energy solution master mix into 200 μL aliquots in 2 mL tubes. Flash freeze each aliquot as performed in step 2.12. Immediately place them into the -80 °C freezer until use.\nAmino acid master mix\nTo prepare fresh 4x amino acid master mix, begin by thawing each amino acid stock at RT and then placing each on ice. Use a vortex and/or thermomixer set at 37 °C and 350 rpm to ensure all amino acid stocks are fully dissolved.\nNOTE: Cysteine may not fully dissolve; it can be added to the amino acid master mix as a suspension. Do not overheat or leave reagents on the thermomixer for an extended period of time.\nIn a 15 mL tube, add the appropriate volume amino acids to sterile DI water so that final concentration of each is 8 mM in the following order: ALA, ARG, ASN, ASP, GLN, GLU, GLY, HIS, IIE, LYS, MET, PHE, PRO, SER, THR, VAL, TRP, TYR, LEU, and CYS. After adding each amino acid, vortex the master mix solution. The volumes listed in Table 2 will make up 2.4 mL of amino acid master mix.",
    "Divide the 4x amino acid master mix into 200 μL aliquots in 2 mL tubes. Flash freeze each aliquot as performed in step 2.12. Immediately place into a freezer at -80 °C until use.\nProduction of reaction-ready plasmid DNA template\nNOTE: Cell-free protein expression in this system has been optimized using the super folder green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector T7-pJL1-sfGFP (Table of Materials). It is recommended to use this plasmid as a control for cell-free reaction efficiency and the pJL1 backbone for the cloning and expression of other protein sequences. Other plasmid DNA templates can be used; however, it is important to note that transcription is controlled by a T7 promoter sequence and the presence of T7 RNA polymerase. A simple protocol for the large-scale production of any plasmid DNA template from transformed E. coli is described below.\n\t\nPurify desired vector using a plasmid purification kit as per manufacturer’s instruction (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Concentrating the plasmid DNA template as much as possible is recommended to meet the tight volume constraints of the cell-free reaction. In general, aim for a 750−1500 ng/μL working stock.\nProduction of reaction-ready mRNA template\nNOTE: This section is optional. Protein expression has been tested using mRNA template generated from the in vitro transcription of the plasmid T7-pJL1-sfGFP by the listed T7 RNA polymerase (Table of Materials).\n\t\nPrepare mRNA template from plasmid DNA encoding the protein of interest using the in vitro transcription reaction components in Table 3. Incubate reactions for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermocycler.\nNOTE: It is recommended to perform 8−10x of these reactions in parallel to generate enough material.",
    "Pool all transcription reactions. Purify using an mRNA purification and concentrator kit as per manufacturer’s instruction (Table of Materials). Elute mRNA template into sterile DI water. Store mRNA template at -80 °C until use.\n4. Performing Cell-free Protein Eexpression Reactions Using V. natriegens Crude Extract\nCell-free protein expression using plasmid or linear DNA template\nRemove 10x energy solution master mix and 4x amino acid master mix aliquots from the -80 °C freezer, thaw at RT, and place on ice. Remove the T7 RNA polymerase and RNase inhibitor stocks from the -20 °C freezer and place on ice. Thaw DNA template at RT and place on ice.\nPrepare a cell-free reaction master mix as per Table 4 by adding each component in the following order to a 2 mL tube on ice: amino acid master mix, energy solution master mix, Mg-glutamate, K-glutamate, DNA template, PEG-8000, T7 RNA polymerase, and RNase inhibitor. Gently flick the tube after each addition to the master mix.\nNOTE: If linear template is to be used for cell-free protein expression, add 5−10x more material as compared to plasmid template to obtain appreciable yields of protein.\nRemove V. natriegens crude cell lysate prepared in step 2.12 from the -80 °C freezers and place on ice for 10−20 min until thawed. Add the appropriate volume crude cell extract to the cell-free reaction master mix as per Table 4 and gently mix by flicking or pipetting up and down.\nEnd-point cell-free protein expression using thermocycler\n\t\t\nPipette 10 μL of the cell-free reaction master mix to the bottom of a 96- or 384-well PCR plate. In between each transfer to the PCR plate, mix the master mix by flicking the tube gently.",
    "NOTE: Cell-free reaction master mix should be well mixed at all times to maximize reaction reproducibility and cell-free protein expression in all samples.\nBriefly centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 10 s to pool any master mix that may have become stuck on the sides of the wells. Seal the wells with a plate adhesive to prevent evaporation and then place the PCR plate into a thermocycler set at 26 °C with a heated lid set at 105 °C.\nNOTE: The even heat distribution and heated lid of a thermocycler greatly improves protein expression yields.\nIncubate the cell-free reactions for a minimum of 3 h. After incubation, expressed proteins can be purified, quantified, and used for downstream processes.\nNOTE: Expressed proteins can be directly quantified in the cell-free reaction using a method of the user’s choice. For example, fluorescent proteins can be quantified using an external standard curve or radioactivity can be measured if using a radiolabeled amino acid in the cell-free reaction. UV-visible spectroscopy or total protein assays are generally not recommended for directly measuring protein production in cell-free reactions without an initial purification.\nAlternatively, monitor cell-free protein expression kinetics using a plate reader.\n\t\t\nPipette 10 μL of the cell-free reaction master mix to the bottom of a black 384-well assay plate with clear glass bottoms. Keep the assay plate on ice or work in a cold room while adding the master mix to ensure that the full kinetic profile is obtained. Seal the wells with a clear plate adhesive to prevent evaporation and then place the assay plate into a plate reader set at 26 °C.\nIncubate the cell-free reactions for 3−6 h while monitoring the appropriate fluorescent excitation/emission wavelengths corresponding to the expressed protein. For example, monitor at Ex/Em = 485 nm/528 nm for sfGFP.",
    "Cell-free protein expression using mRNA template\nThaw mRNA template prepared in step 3.5.2 at RT and place on ice.\nPerform step 4.1.1 through step 4.1.6 as previously specified for linear or plasmid DNA template using Table 4 to prepare an alternative cell-free reaction master mix for mRNA template.\n5. Calibration of V. natriegens Cell-free Reactions with sfGFP\nNOTE: This section is optional. The optimal cell-free reaction ion concentration can vary slightly for each crude extract preparation based on the conditions used for cell lysis. Consider performing the optional cell-free reaction ion calibration protocol described below using sfGFP if reaction yields are significantly lower than expected (concentrations < 1.0 μg/mL).\nPrepare the Mg2+ and K+ ion calibration solutions as specified in Table 5 in sterile DI water from the 100 mM Mg-glutamate and 2,000 mM K-glutamate stocks prepared in step 3.1.1. Place calibration solutions on ice until needed.\nFollowing the calibration map in Table 6, pipette 1 μL of the Mg-glutamate and 2 μL of K-glutamate ion calibration solutions into the appropriate wells in a 384-well PCR plate.\nThe order of operations of this step is as follows: Pipette the Mg-glutamate ion calibration solution into the bottom of each well followed by the K-glutamate ion calibration solution onto the side of well without touching the liquid already present in the wells.\nSeal the wells by placing an adhesive on top of the plate to prevent evaporation while preparing the calibration cell-free reaction master mix. Gently tap the 384-well plate to mix the Mg- and K-glutamate calibration solutions.\nNOTE: A repeater pipette is highly recommended for completing this step reproducibly and quickly.",
    "Prepare the calibration cell-free reaction master mix as specified in Table 5 using T7-pJL1-sfGFP plasmid DNA template in a 2 mL tube. Add each component in the following order to the master mix: amino acid master mix, energy solution master mix, T7-pJL1-sfGFP DNA template, PEG-8000, T7 RNA polymerase, and RNase inhibitor. Gently flick the tube to mix after each component addition.\nNOTE: Do not add Mg2+ or K+ to the calibration cell-free master mix.\nRemove the adhesive from the plate. Carefully pipette 7 μL of the calibration cell-free reaction master mix on to the sides of the wells without touching the mixed ion calibration solution already present in the wells. Reseal the wells with the adhesive and gently tap the 384-well PCR plate to mix the cell-free master mix with the ion calibration solution.\nNOTE: A repeater pipette is highly recommended for completing this step reproducibly and quickly.\nBriefly centrifuge the plate 1,000 x g for 10 s to pool any unmixed liquid that may have become stuck on the sides of the wells. Place the 384-well plate into a thermocycler set at 26 °C with a heated lid set at 105 °C.\nIncubate the cell-free reactions for 3 h. After incubation, transfer the contents of each well to a black 384-well assay plate with glass bottoms with a multi-channel pipette and read the fluorescence of sfGFP at Ex/Em = 485 nm/528 nm using a plate reader to determine the ion concentration combination that yields the highest amount of protein."
