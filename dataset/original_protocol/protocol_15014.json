    "All procedures involving animal subjects were approved and completed in accordance and compliance with The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regulations and guidelines.\n1. Mouse Anesthesia\nSet up a clean procedure table with a heated isothermal pad wrapped in a surgical towel. The heating pad should be maintained between 30 °C and 34 °C to stabilize the animal's core temperature while reducing potential stress to the animal.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber with the following parameters: oxygen flow rate set to 1.5 L/min and isoflurane vaporizer set to 3.5%. Complete sedation should take place within 1-2 min. If an induction chamber is not available, a bell jar may be used with a wire mesh positioned at the bottom to avoid direct animal contact with the isoflurane.\nImmediately remove the mouse from the induction chamber once it is completely anesthetized (achieved when the mouse loses voluntary motor function). Apply a nose-cone to the animal for maintenance of anesthesia. The oxygen flow rate should be reduced to approximately 0.5 L/min and the isoflurane vaporizer should be set within the range of 1.5 to 2.5%.\n\t\nApply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment directly to the corneas to reduce eye dryness8. In addition, during anesthesia, the mouse should maintain an absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex, the mucous membranes should remain a pink color, and breathing should appear steady.\n2. Preparing for Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging Procedure\nRestrain each leg of the mouse on the heated procedure table with a removable adhesive, such as surgical tape.",
    "Using an electric razor, remove the hair on the ventral body surface between the abdomen and half way up the thoracic cavity. Apply hair removal cream to further remove the remaining hair that is not cut by the razor. Wipe off the cream with a damp gauze pad after 2-3 min.\nRemove the excess hair using a water-moistened gauze pad and clean the shaved region with 70% alcohol or equivalent antiseptic. The ultrasound probe will be applied to this area to visualize diaphragm function. A topical analgesic may be provided to animals experiencing minor skin irritation due to hair removal.\n3. Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging Protocol\nTurn on the ultrasound device and adjust the output power (if necessary) on the apparatus by percentage to obtain optimum resolution.\nSet the ultrasound machine to either B (brightness)-mode, M (motion)-mode, or both before imaging, which allows for proper visualization of the mouse diaphragm contraction.\nApply a small amount of ultrasound gel on the mouse's upper abdomen and massage the gel toward the thoracic cavity.\nPlace the ultrasound transducer in this area and angle it upward towards the heart. Adjust the probe until an optimized resolution of the image is achieved. Note: for this protocol, a micro-convex array or linear phased array transducer is an ideal probe to use due to the small footprint and excellent axial resolution9; the frequency needs to be adjusted across the bandwidth and for these experiments a range of 6.5-12 MHz may be utilized.\nPress the freeze button to temporarily save the diaphragm images and view the selected contractions.\nSave the recording as a cine loop, which allows for later measurements of diaphragmatic excursion as well as respiration rate. Note: frames of images can be saved in the computer memory or on an external hard drive for future analysis9.",
    "Precisely measure the depth of diaphragm movement from relaxation to contraction using the electronic calipers that are part of the ultrasound software.\nConvert the cine loop file into a MPEG file and determine the respiration rate by counting the number of diaphragmatic contractions during the recording period. Alternatively, the number of contractions per min (respiration rate) may be counted from the M-mode image.\n4. Post Anesthesia Animal Recovery\nThe mouse should completely recover from anesthesia within 1 hour. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
