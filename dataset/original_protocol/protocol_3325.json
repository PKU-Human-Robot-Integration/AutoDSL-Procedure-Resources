The appropriate tissue block volume is approximately 1 cm × 0.5 cm × 1 cm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Collection and cleaning of pancreatic cancer tissue\n(A) Resected pancreatic cancer specimens and sampling sites.\n(B) The harvested pancreatic cancer tissue is removed and cleaned of any attached fat, blood stains, and burned tissue, The volume of tissue blocks required for tissue digestion is approximately 1 cm × 0.5 cm × 1 cm.\nRinse the surface stains with pre-chilled 1XPBS and remove burnt and fatty tissues.\nImmerse the tissue in a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing approximately 5 mL of tissue preservation solution, place it on ice, and bring it back to the laboratory for further processing.\nMechanical dissociation of pancreatic cancer tissue\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section describes the steps of mechanical dissociation of pancreatic cancer tissue for further digestion.\nThoroughly wash blood stains and remove fatty connective tissue by using pre-cooled 2% FBS-PBS (wash buffer II). Transfer the tissue to a 100 mm × 20 mm tissue-culture-treated culture dish containing approximately 2 mL of digestion solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUse forceps to secure the tumor tissue and cut the tumor tissue with a scalpel, ensuring that the size is smaller than 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of pancreatic cancer tissue\n(A) The pancreatic cancer tissue is minced into particles smaller than 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm.",
    "(B) After digestion and dissociation, pancreatic cancer tissue presents as a translucent mixture with dispersed tissue particles.\nTransfer the tissue-digestion mixture to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and continue adding digestion solution until the volume reaches approximately 15 mL.\nSingle-cell digestion and dissociation of pancreatic cancer tissues\nTiming: 60 min\nThis section introduces the steps of enzymatic digestion of pancreatic cancer tissue samples after mechanical dissociation and obtaining preliminary cell suspensions.\nTransfer the centrifuge tube containing the mixture of the tissue-digesting solution to the shaker.\nTilt or place it flat, and fix it in position.\nSet the speed to 150 rpm, the temperature to 37°C, and the time to 1 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Collection of cell suspension after digestion and dissociation\n(A) Filter the digestion system using a 70 μm filter, meanwhile grind with a 1 mL syringe plunger.\n(B) The final volume of the filtered cell suspension is approximately 20 mL.\n(C) Tissue residue on the filter after grinding and filtration.\nFilter the supernatant using a 40 μm or 70 μm filter.\nDuring this process, grind the tissue debris using a 1 mL syringe plunger.\nRinse the filter with cold 2% FBS-1640 (wash buffer II).\nNote: The volume of the filtered cell suspension is approximately 20 mL.\nStore the filtrate on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCell purification and flow cytometry\nTiming: 60 min–90 min\nThis section describes the purification of immune cells from cell suspensions and further flow cytometry staining steps.\nCentrifuge the filtrate obtained in step 8 at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant after centrifugation.\nGently aspirate the 36% Percoll solution with a Pasteur pipette and carefully resuspend the pellet to a volume of approximately 10 mL.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, with the acceleration set at 8 and deceleration at 1.\nNote: After centrifugation, the sample will present a layered structure, with most of the fat and stromal cells in the upper layer, the middle layer consisting of Percoll, and the lower layer mainly composed of immune cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nCritical: It is necessary to set a lower deceleration speed on the centrifuge to achieve a stable and distinct separation of different components.\nDiscard the supernatant after centrifugation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cell suspension purification\n(A) After resuspending cells using 36% Percoll and centrifuging, the immune cells primarily accumulate in the bottom layer.\n(B) Transfer the cell pellet into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube and proceed with the red blood cell lysis process.\n(C) The pale yellow or white cells aggregate at the bottom of the centrifuge tube after complete red blood cell lysis and centrifugation.\nUse a pipette to gently aspirate 1 mL of the RBC lysis buffer to resuspend the cell suspension.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a new 15 mL centrifuge tube and continue to add RBC lysis buffer to bring the volume to 10 mL.\nLet it sit at room temperature (15°C–25°C) for 10 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nCritical: The purpose of replacing the centrifuge tube is to prevent impurities adhering to the tube walls from reintroducing into the cell suspension, which may lead to a decrease in cell yield.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspend the cells in an appropriate volume (40–200 μL) of wash buffer II. The volume of the resuspension is determined by the desired cell quantity for subsequent experiments (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of wash buffer II.",
    "Take 10 μL of the cells and dilute them 10 times.\nTake 10 μL of the diluted cells and mix them with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue.\nUse a cell counter to determine the viability and concentration of cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cell viability and concentration\n(A) Microscopic examination shows 93.54% cell viability and 9.26 × 105/mL concentration, The concentration of the original cell suspension is 9.26 × 106/mL.\n(B) The range of cell diameter distribution.\nSelect approximately 3 × 106 cells for flow cytometry, transfer them into a 1.5 mL EP tube, and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 50 μL 2.5 μg/mL Fc blocker, Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min.\nPrepare the staining cocktail by diluting the surface protein antibody with wash buffer II at a ratio of 1:100.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of the staining cocktail.\nIncubate the cells on ice for 20 min, avoiding exposure to light.\nAdd 200 μL of wash buffer II to the cell suspension, centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step once.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of fixation/permeabilization solution and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nAdd 200 μL of 1× Perm/wash solution to the cell suspension, centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.\nPrepare the staining cocktail by diluting the Intracellular protein antibody with 1× Perm/wash solution at a ratio of 1:100.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of the staining cocktail.",
    "Incubate the cells on ice for 20 min, avoiding exposure to light.\nWash cells twice with 200 μL 1× Perm/wash solution.\nResuspend cells in 200 mL PBS for analysis on a five-laser flow cytometer. The primary immune group is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3091-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Gating strategy for major immune cell populations in pancreatic cancer\n(A) cell populations include tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) (CD45+CD11b+CD68+), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (CD45+CD11b+CD68-CD66b+), B cells (CD45+CD19+), CD4+T cells (CD45+CD3+CD4+), CD8+cytotoxic T cells (CTL) (CD45+CD3+CD8+ ), γδT cells (CD45+CD3+TCRγδ T+), natural killer cells (NK) (CD45+CD3-CD16+CD56+), dendritic cell (DC) (CD45+HLA-DR+CD11c+) and natural killer T cell (NKT) (CD45+CD3+CD16+CD56+)."
