    "All animal procedures were performed under protocols approved by Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.\n1. Preparation of animals, tools, blood pressure measuring equipment, and hypoxia chamber\nAnimal acclimation.\n\tNOTE: Experimental animals used for this study were male, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice weighing 25-27 g. Several factors should be considered when estimating the number of animals required for the experiment, including surgery-associated mortality, unexpected surgical complications, and sudden unexpected death. Use at least 10 mice per group to reach statistical power and avoid underpowered studies.\n\t\nUpon reception, house the animals in ventilated rodent cages (groups of five animals per cage) provided with appropriate bedding, rodent chow, and water. Let the animals acclimate to the new environment (12 h light-dark cycle at 18-20 °C) for at least 3 days.\nRandomly assign them to the following groups: Normoxia (Group 1), hypoxia (Group 2), and hypoxia + 7C1/let-7 miRNA (Group 3).\nDissection tools and blood pressure measuring equipment preparation.\n\t\nClean all dissection tools with 70% ethanol (Figure 1A).\nPrepare a makeshift injection platform with a homemade anesthesia nose cone (Figure 1B), suture packs (Figure 1C), and equipment for the PAH procedure (Figure 1D-F).\nExperimental setting for pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) induction.\n\t\nSet the N2 tank, the oxygen sensor, and the semisealable hypoxia chamber (Figure 2A).\nEstablish a set point of 10% O2 in the oxygen sensor and let the system reach the steady-state (Figure 2B, C).\nKeep hypoxia (Group 2) and hypoxia + 7C1/let-7 miRNA (Group 3) animals in hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks of hypoxia, place the animals under normoxic conditions for 1 week (Figure 2D). The normoxic group (Group 1) stays in normoxia for 4 weeks.",
    "NOTE: (1) 3 weeks of hypoxia followed by 1 week of normoxia is a well-established method for developing PAH and right ventricle heart failure7. The oxygen sensor detects O2 concentration inside the semisealable hypoxia chamber and corrects it by infusing N2 gas through the gas infusion tube.\nInspect the animals daily for the entire duration of the experiment (3 weeks). Consult a veterinarian if the animals exhibit signs of distress such as dramatic weight loss and difficulty breathing. If euthanasia is necessary for the animals in severe distress, exclude the animal from the study.\n\t\tNOTE: Hypoxia exposure causes mouse body weight loss. A loss of 10% body weight is typically used as a reliable indication of PAH development.\nAvoid extensive opening of the hypoxia chamber. For cage cleaning, replenishing food, changing water bottles, and compound administration, open the chambers for not more than 1 hour per week.\n2. Intravenous bolus injection  via the jugular vein\nMouse preparation and anesthesia.\n\t\nTake out hypoxia (Group 2) and hypoxia + 7C1/let-7 miRNA (Group 3) mouse cages from the hypoxia chamber and gently remove the animal from the cage.\n\t\tNOTE: The dosage regimen for 7C1/let-7 miRNA (1.5 mg/kg IV/dose) is twice per week for 4 weeks of treatment. It is recommended that investigators take both hypoxia and hypoxia + compound treatment cages out of the hypoxia chamber during IV injection to make sure all the animals receive the same magnitude of hypoxia exposure per time interval.\nWeigh the mouse using a precision scale and record its weight (Figure 3A).\nPlace the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber connected to the anesthetic vaporizer and close it (Figure 3B). Expose the mouse to 3% isoflurane until unconscious (Figure 3C-D).",
    "Remove the mouse from the chamber and shave the fur from the jaw cranially to the middle of the sternum caudally. Laterally, shave the fur from the jaw angles, through the sides of the neck, and toward the shoulders (Figure 3E).\nPlace the isoflurane-anesthetized mouse in a supine position (belly side face-up) on an injection platform underneath a dissection microscope. Maintain the anesthesia via a nose cone with 1.5% isoflurane and gently restrain the four legs with adhesive tape to immobilize the body (Figure 3F).\nApply a noxious stimulus (i.e., toe pinch) with straight forceps to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. The anesthetized mouse should not respond to the stimulation prior to and throughout the surgical procedure.\nInjection agent preparation.\n\t\nPrepare a single-dose injection compound at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg under sterile conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: Warm the injection compound to room temperature (RT) since injection of cold substances can cause discomfort and a drop in mouse body temperature (if this does not damage the compound). The optimal dose and duration of compound 7C1/let-7 miRNA used in this study are based on previous publications8,9.\nLoad the sterile single-use syringe with the volume to be injected. Hold the syringe upright and advance the plunger to expel the air from the syringe. Do not reuse the syringe.\nLimit the injection volume to 200 μL in a 25 g mouse to reduce the incidence of hemodilution and abnormal cardiac effects on the animals. If a larger volume is required, divide the injection compound into two injections with an interval of 10 min.\nPrepare mouse for IV injection.\n\t\nGently scrub the surgical area three times with 70% ethanol.\nMake a 0.5 cm longitudinal cut slightly to the right of the midline of the neck using a surgical scissor (Figure 3G).",
    "Use forceps to separate the muscle and the fat tissues to locate the right external jugular vein (Figure 3H).\n\t\tNOTE: Rotate injection sites each time to avoid scar formation.\nUse a high-power objective lens to allow easy visualization of the injection area (Figure 3I).\nIV injection\n\t\nInsert a 28 G sterile needle into the jugular vein with the needle bevel facing up (Figure 3J, K).\n\t\tNOTE: Tail vein injection is an alternative to jugular vein injection. However, this technique is difficult to carry out repeat-dosing due to the variability in vein depth, mice tail skin color, and skin hardness.\nSlowly press the syringe plunger to inject the compound into the vein. Allow the needle to remain within the vein for an additional 10 s to prevent backflow of the injectant (Figure 3L).\n\t\tNOTE: The bluish dye allows for easy visualization of the injection. Do not include the dye when injecting test materials. An inaccurate injection will result in the accumulation of bluish dye around the IV injection site.\nRemove the needle and use a cotton swab to apply pressure to the injection site to prevent bleeding (Figure 3M).\nSuture the skin with 5-0 suture (Figure 3N), disinfect the skin again with 70% ethanol, and place the animal in a clean recovery cage with no bedding but the bottom covered in a paper towel.\n\t\tNOTE: The mouse should be awake from anesthesia and regain consciousness within 5 min once back to the recovery cage. Monitor the mouse for signs of distress.\nReturn the animals to their home cage and put the mouse cage back in the hypoxia chamber.",
    "​NOTE: The entire procedure, from anesthetizing a mouse to finishing jugular vein injection, takes about 10-15 min by a single experimenter. To shorten the normoxia exposure in mice, it is recommended that at least two investigators collaborate to accomplish a jugular vein injection procedure.\n3. Blood pressure measurement\nPrepare instruments for blood pressure measuring.\n\t\nSoak the tip of 1.0 F catheter in 37 °C pre-heated PBS at least 30 min before hemodynamic measurement (Figure 4A).\nMeasure the distance from the catheter insertion site to the desired catheter tip location. For example, the distance between the mouse ascending aorta to the mid of the neck is approximately 1-1.2 cm. The distance between the right ventricle of the heart to the mid of the neck is approximately 2.3-2.8 cm.\nMark two catheter distance markings to provide a visual indication of insertion depth (Figure 4B).\nAttach the catheter to the pressure transducer, connect the pressure transducer to input channel 1 on the data acquisition device, turn on the pressure-volume control unit, and initiate data acquisition blood pressure analysis software. Create a new blood pressure analysis document and set channel 1 for pressure.\nPerform a pressure calibration according to the manufacturer's protocol. Allow the whole setup to stabilize for at least 5 min (Figure 4C).\nIn blood pressure analysis software, select Units Conversion from the Channel 1 dropdown menu (Figure 4D, red arrow).\nSet the default Units Conversion Values (Figure 4E).\n\t\tNOTE: Blood pressure is represented as millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The standardized pressure output from Pressure Control Unit is 1 V per 100 mmHg. 25 mmHg corresponds to 0.25 V output, and 100 mm Hg corresponds to 1 V output.\nPrepare mouse for blood pressure measurement procedure.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane through inhalation.",
    "Apply the veterinary ointment directly onto the ocular surface of the mouse eyes to prevent dryness, as the mouse cannot close its eyes under anesthesia. Shave the fur from the mouse's neck while under anesthesia.\nScrub the shaved regions with a 70% ethanol swab. Place the anesthetized mouse in a supine position on an injection platform underneath a dissection microscope. Place the mouse's nose into the nose cone to maintain anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane) throughout the surgical procedure.\nTest the anesthetized mouse's motor response to the noxious stimulus. The anesthetized mouse should not respond to a noxious stimulus before and during the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Inhalable (isoflurane) and injectable (ketamine/xylazine) anesthetics can decrease blood pressure. In general, isoflurane inhalation anesthesia has a slight effect on lowering the blood pressure than ketamine/xylazine. Therefore, isoflurane is the preferred inhalant anesthetic over ketamine/xylazine. Achieving the appropriate depth of anesthesia is critical for accurate and reproducible hemodynamic measurements. The investigator needs to keep the depth of anesthesia constant for each mouse.\nAscending aorta catheterization\n\t\nMake a midline incision of the skin from the mandible to the sternum (Figure 5A).\nSeparate the salivary glands and expose the trachea (Figure 5B).\nUse forceps to clear the soft tissue along the vessels to expose the right carotid artery and right external jugular vein (Figure 5C).\nPut 0.5 mL of PBS in the cavity to slow the development of vasospasm while manipulating the carotid artery.\nCarefully isolate a 5 mm section of the right carotid artery. Place a piece of white paper underneath the vessel as a background to make the artery more visible (Figure 5D).\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully separate the vagus nerve (white) from the artery and ensure not to cut or damage the nerve or the artery.",
    "Using an 8-0 suture tie a permanent knot (#1) to close off the cranial end of the vessel (Figure 5E).\nTie a first loose knot (#2) to temporarily occlude blood flow from the aorta. Then, tie a second loose knot (#3) between the first two sutures (Figure 5F). The second loose knot (#3) will be used to quickly secure the catheter after placement.\nUsing a 25 G needle, make a small hole, large enough to pass the catheter, in line with the vessel between #3 and #1 ligatures (Figure 5G).\n\t\tNOTE: Carotid arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart and have very high pressure. If the carotid artery is cut, that pressure will cause the blood to spurt out (Figure 5H).\nHold the catheter 1.5 inches from the tip and gently insert the tip of the catheter through the hole of the artery (X-mark). Tighten the middle suture node (#3) around the catheter and vessel that still allows passage of the catheter (Figure 5I-J).\n\t\tNOTE: This step requires practice. The potential complications with this step include bleeding at the catheter insertion site and vasospasm. When bleeding occurs, blood loss from the bleeding artery reduces blood volume, leading to a severe drop in systemic blood pressure. At this moment, the investigator needs to euthanize the animal. For mechanically induced vasospasm, it usually occurs during catheter insertion caused by a persistent contraction of the blood vessels. This makes the blood vessel opening smaller and prevents catheter advancement to the carotid artery. Do not use excessive force against resistance to advance the catheter. When moderate or severe vasospasm resistance is encountered, try again in a little while or use a smaller catheter (e.g., 1.0 F). Experienced microsurgeons can achieve 100% success rates for ascending aorta catheterization.",
    "After the catheter passes the first loose knot (#2) with the sensor tip, fasten the second loose knot (#3) more tightly to secure the catheter and gently release the first loose knot (#2) (Figure 5K, L).\nContinue to insert the catheter toward the ascending aorta according to the mark on the catheter (Figure 4B) until pressure analysis shows an arterial blood pressure profile (Figure 5M). Record systemic blood pressure (SBP) data using the data acquisition system and software.\nLoosen the middle suture node (#3) to allow the catheter to be pulled out (Figure 5N).\nTie the middle suture node (#3) around the vessel before pulling the catheter out of the carotid artery (Figure 5O-P).\nPlace the catheter in PBS.\nRight heart catheterization.\n\t\nCarefully isolate the right external jugular vein from the surrounding connective tissue and ligate all the small branches with 8-0 suture (blue arrowheads) (Figure 6A).\n\t\tNOTE: For right heart catheterization, the heart is commonly accessed via the right jugular vein.\nUsing an 8-0 suture, tie a permanent knot (#1) to close off the cranial end of the vessel (Figure 6B). Then, tie a loose knot (#2) on the caudal end of the vessel (Figure 6C).\nUse a 25 G needle to make a small hole proximal to the permanent knot (#1) (Figure 6D).\n\t\tNOTE: Jugular veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart and have low pressure. If the jugular vein is cut, the blood will not spurt out (Figure 6D, E).\nHold the catheter and insert the catheter into the cut of the vein (X-mark) (Figure 6E) and tighten the caudal knot (#2) around the catheter and the vessel (Figure 6F).\nSlowly and gently push the catheter into the right heart. Monitor the catheter tip depth based on the catheter mark (Figure 4B).",
    "NOTE: Assessment of the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) in closed-chest mice is a challenge because of the complex RV anatomy and structure. This step requires a high level of expertise and lots of practice. In the hands of an experienced microsurgeon, the successful rate for right ventricle catheterization can approach 90%.\nAssess the catheter tip position according to the pressure wave tracing in the software. When the tip of the catheter is in the right ventricle, the monitor will show a typical RVSP tracing (Figure 6G, H).\n\t\tNOTE: When the shape of pulmonary pressure curves looks atypical (e.g., spiky curves), this implies incorrect positioning of the catheter. Adjust the catheter position by gently pulling the catheter a little bit back, and then slowly advancing the catheter to a more central position within the right ventricle. To avoid the generation of artifacts in research data, the investigator should avoid prolonged (not more than 1 min) or repeated attempts (not more than two attempts) at right ventricle catheterization.\nKeep the catheter immobile and collect the data for 5 min.\nAfter the recording is complete, carefully pull the catheter out and tie the caudal knot (#2) around the vessel (Figure 6I). Place the catheter back in PBS solution.\n\t\t​NOTE: After completion of the experiment, clean the catheter with 1% digestive enzyme solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition to assessing hemodynamic status, investigators may harvest the hearts and the lungs for PAH histopathological examination. To ensure the effectiveness of multiple IV bolus dosing, investigators can isolate lung endothelial cells and measure let-7 miRNA levels.\n4. Blood pressure data analysis\nExamine the blood pressure recording.\n\t\nOpen the blood pressure analysis software data file (PAH JOVE.adicht).",
    "In channel 1, select an area representing the pressure signal and place the Waveform Cursor on the Peak (X-mark) to measure pressure amplitude (Figure 7A).\nDetermine the maximum amplitude of the pressure wave. This represents the systolic pressure (Figure 7A, red arrow).\nExtract the region of interest (Figure 7B gray area) from the image by pressing the Shift + Command + 3 (for Mac) or Windows + Shift + S (for Windows PC) and paste it into a graphics file.\nStatistical analysis of blood pressure data.\n\t\nEnter the individual mouse blood pressure data in statistical analysis software.\nPerform an unpaired Student's t-test for statistical analysis of two study groups (normoxia vs. hypoxia; hypoxia vs. hypoxia + 7C1/let-7 miRNA). Consider the differences in mean values as significant as p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
