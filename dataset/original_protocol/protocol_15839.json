    "The UniProt website provides 10 main datasets and four main tools. The key UniProt datasets are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), the UniProt Archive (UniParc), and protein sets for completely sequenced genomes (Proteomes). Supporting datasets include information about proteins that is present in UniProtKB protein entries, such as literature citations, taxonomy, subcellular locations, keywords, cross-referenced databases, and related human diseases. Additional searchable sets include annotation programs used in UniProt and UniProt Help. The four tools that UniProt provides are the “BLAST” sequence search tool, the “Align” multiple sequence alignment tool, the “Peptide Search” tool, and the “ID Mapping” tool, where you can upload lists of identifiers to download corresponding UniProt entries or map them to/from external databases. The following steps describe how to explore and search the different datasets within UniProt.\nNecessary Resources\nAn up-to-date web browser\n1. Go the UniProt home page at http://www.uniprot.org[href=http://www.uniprot.org] using an up-to-date web browser.\n2. Click on the drop-down panel to the left of the search box to see all UniProt datasets and select the one that is of interest.\nThe drop-down panel to the left of the search box is shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0001].\nYou can also select the main datasets as tiles on the home page. Note that the background color of the drop-down panel changes depending on the dataset in order to help identify the selected dataset.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e4d9b9ef-79b6-4838-82ce-f1a179d96dd0/cpz1700-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nUniProt datasets’ drop-down menu.\n3. Enter a query in the search box and click the Search button.\nFor example, select “UniProtKB” (the default option) and enter “human insulin.” For the full UniProt query syntax, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-tbl-0001].\nTable 1.\n                UniProt Query Syntax\ntable:\n﻿Querya[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-tbl1-note-0001_5],Description\nhuman antigen,All entries containing both terms.\nhuman AND antigen,\nhuman && antigen,\n“human antigen”,All entries containing both terms in the exact order.",
    "human -antigen,All entries containing the term “human” but not “antigen.”\nhuman NOT antigen,\nhuman !antigen,\nhuman OR mouse,All entries containing either term.\nhuman || mouse,\nantigen AND (human OR mouse),Using parentheses to override Boolean precedence rules.\nanti*,All entries containing terms starting with “anti.” Asterisks can also be used at the beginning and within terms. Note that starting with an asterisk or a single letter followed by an asterisk can slow down queries considerably.\nauthor:Tiger*,\"Citations that have an author whose name starts with “Tiger.” To search in a specific field of a dataset, you must prefix your search term with the field name and a colon. To discover what fields can be queried explicitly, observe the query hints that are shown after submitting a query or use the query builder (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-prot-0002]).\"\nlength:[100 TO *],All entries with a sequence of at least 100 amino acids.\n(lit_author:Arai) AND (lit_author:Chung),All entries with publications authored by either author.\na To use characters that have a special meaning in the query syntax literally in your query, you must escape them with a backslash, e.g., use “gene:L\\(1\\)2CB” to search for the gene name L(1)2CB. The current list of special characters is as follows: + - && || ! () {} [] ^ ″ ∼ * ?: \\\\\n4. Review the search results page for the dataset.\nThe displayed protein entries can be viewed in a “card” or “table” format, selected with the icons at the top of the results page. The results page for the example query in table format is shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0002]. The “card” format gives the user a quick summary of the data present in the entry.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1fbe97b9-4939-49f9-9ee8-e7ff32faa850/cpz1700-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nUniProtKB search results page.\n5. Click on the filters on the left to narrow down the results.",
    "For example, click on “Human” under the “Popular organisms” filter to narrow down the term “human” as the organism. Then, go to the “Proteins with” filters and select the filter “3D structure,” for example. The resulting screen with the selected filters is shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0003].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fdfe88cb-a5f2-4169-ad77-051b99cd92a6/cpz1700-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nUniProtKB search results with filter applied.\n6. Click on the accession links under the “Entry” column to view individual protein entries.\nFor example, clicking on the link for INS_HUMAN (P01308) will take you to the protein entry for human insulin. The human insulin entry as seen in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0004] has a summary at the beginning that displays its protein name, status (i.e., reviewed or unreviewed), organism, gene name, protein length, evidence level, and annotation score. At the top of the entry, the tabs “Entry,” “Feature viewer,” “Publications,” “External links,” and “History” allow exploration of the different sections of the entry. You can use the buttons beneath the summary section to launch tools, view and download the entry in different formats, add it to your basket, add a publication, or give feedback on the entry. When there is an isoform present, you can align the sequences to view similarities and differences. You can explore information and supporting evidence about function, subcellular location, disease, and variants in human entries; phenotypes and variants in non-human entries; and a range of other data categories by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the navigation panel on the left. Further guidance is available within the Guidelines for Understanding Results section.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/784b975d-4c39-4c3c-b7cc-cc357eaca0b2/cpz1700-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nUniProtKB protein entry INS_HUMAN for human insulin.",
    "You can access advanced search options by clicking on “Advanced” to restrict terms to specific fields or to combine multiple terms using Boolean logic. The advanced search provides a query builder, which helps you expand your query. The advanced search translates search terms that have been entered and filters that have been applied into the query builder and can be accessed from all pages.\nNecessary Resources\nAn up-to-date web browser\n1. Go to the UniProt home page at http://www.uniprot.org[href=http://www.uniprot.org] using an up-to-date web browser.\n2. For help on the advanced search options available, click on the blue “Help” icon in the top right corner or on the green “Help” icon on the right-hand side of each page. Search for “advanced search” to view the advanced search options page, which lists the different options available in the “Advanced Search” menu for UniProtKB.\n3. Click on the drop-down menu to the left of the search box and select the dataset.\nThe default is UniProtKB.\n4. Click on “Advanced” to the right of the search box. Click the drop-down box as seen in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0005] to view and choose various field types or type a concept name (e.g., “structure”) and select the most suitable one from the autocompleted suggestions. Click on the “Add field” icon to add more rows and further build the query. If desired, combine the rows by choosing the Boolean operators “And,” “Or,” and/or “Not.” Then, click the search button.\nThe advanced search allows you to restrict terms to specific fields in advance or to combine multiple search terms using Boolean logic. The advanced search panel is shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0006].\nFor example, using the drop-down, select the field type “Organism” and enter “Homo sapiens.” Then, under the next drop-down, select the field type “Protein name” and enter “insulin.”\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b0042768-7df2-4350-a31f-c34866a0a9b8/cpz1700-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>",

    "The advanced search can be a powerful tool to narrow down to very specific results. Here, we look at an example where we use various advanced search fields to find all entries in UniProtKB with direct protein sequencing evidence that are encoded in the mitochondrial sequence and have manually entered experimental evidence for function.\nNecessary Resources\nAn up-to-date web browser\n1. Go to the UniProt home page at http://www.uniprot.org[href=http://www.uniprot.org] using an up-to-date web browser.\n2. Click on the drop-down to the left of the search box and select “UniProtKB.”\n3. Click on “Advanced” to the right of the search box to access advanced search.\n4. Click on the drop-down menu box within advanced search, select the option “Keywords,” and type “direct protein sequencing” or select it from the autocomplete drop-down menu after beginning to type.\nFor additional exploration, all keywords can be found under the Keywords supporting dataset at http://www.uniprot.org/keywords[href=http://www.uniprot.org/keywords].\n5. Click on the drop-down in the next row and select “Sequence/Encoded in” or select it from the autocomplete drop-down menu after beginning to type. For this example, choose “Mitochondrion” from the drop-down to the right.\n6. If required, click on “Add Field” at the bottom of the rows to add another parameter. Click on the new drop-down box and select “Function/Function [CC].” Then, click on the “Evidence” drop-down on the right and select “Experimental,” found under “Manual Assertions.” Verify that the view looks like Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.700#cpz1700-fig-0008].
