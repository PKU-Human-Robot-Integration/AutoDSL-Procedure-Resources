    "For health and safety purposes, prior to using any ink and cleaning solution, refer to the material safety datasheet (MSDS).\n1. Drop-on-demand Electrohydrodynamic Jet Printing Using Silver Nanoparticle Ink\nFill the filtered silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink in the ink reservoir of the EHD printing system.\n\tNote: Commercially available AgNP ink can be used for the inkjet purpose. The ink should have a viscosity of around 10 cP and a surface tension of 20 ~ 40 mN/m to obtain drop-on-demand jetting.\nMake a nozzle for the DOD EHD printing by using a thermal puller.\n\t\nPlace a glass capillary [inner diameter (ID) of 1 mm] in the thermal puller.\nSet the parameters of the thermal puller; for example, the heating temperature in the range of 580 - 590 °C and a pulling speed of around 18 mm/s.\n\t\tNote: The parameters for the thermal puller should differ according to the target nozzle ID and ambient conditions.\nOperate the thermal puller with the set parameters to apply heat at the center of the capillary and pull at both of its ends to make a nozzle with an ID of 5 µm.\n\t\tNote: Determine the size of the nozzle ID based on the target dot size on the substrate. For reference, the nozzle ID of 5 µm could print 5 µm-sized dots.\nAdjust the glass nozzle length by cutting the glass nozzle via a glass cutter.\nAssemble the nozzle to the nozzle holder and the connector, which are connected to the ink reservoir via polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing.\nApply the air pressure to supply ink to the nozzle tip.",
    "Turn on the air-pressure controller and apply air pressure of 15 ~ 20 kPa to the ink reservoir to supply ink to the nozzle tip. Monitor the ink flow through the transparent glass nozzle and tubing to ensure that no air is trapped inside the tube and the nozzle when supplying the ink. Keep applying air pressure to the ink reservoir until ink appears at the nozzle tip.\n\t\tNote: Do not reduce the pressure before the ink appears at the nozzle tip because that could cause air bubble entrapment at the nozzle tip.\nReduce the pressure to around 12 kPa to maintain the extruded meniscus without any ink dripping from the nozzle tip.\n\t\tNote: The proper air pressure depends on the nozzle size and ink viscosity. Do not increase the air pressure to more than 30 kPa to avoid excessive air compression, which is undesirable for maintaining the meniscus in a stable condition.\nFix the assembled nozzle head in the printing system.\nPlace a glass substrate on the vacuum chuck of the substrate holder and turn on the vacuum pump to hold the substrate.\nMove the Z-axis stage to adjust the stand-off distance (H)—the gap between the nozzle tip and the substrate position—to approximately 100 µm. Use the side-view image acquired by the monitoring camera to estimate the stand-off distance by using the distance from the nozzle tip to its reflection, as shown in Figure 2.",
    "Note: A smaller stand-off distance leads to a higher electrical field, which could facilitate printing with a lower DC and pulse voltages for jetting. However, a lower stand-off distance could lead to larger drops. Therefore, the magnitude of voltages should be reduced accordingly to obtain the desired dot size. In general, the use of a lower voltage is recommended to obtain smaller printed dots with less spraying. However, a careful operation is required if the stand-off distance becomes less than 50 µm, due to the higher chance of nozzle breakage by collision with the substrate. Considering the trade-off relationship between jetting ability and reliability, we recommend the use of a stand-off distance of 100 µm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57846/57846fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Stand-off distance adjustment by using side view camera image. The nozzle image from a side-view camera can be used to estimate the stand-off distance. The stand-off distance (H) from the nozzle tip to the substrate can be easily estimated as half the distance from the nozzle tip to its shadow.

The incremental voltage should be less than 100 V at a time. Overall, do not apply a DC voltage of more than 600 V.\nReduce the DC voltage slightly from the onset DC voltage until no further ink dripping from the nozzle is observed.\n\t\tNote: After the adjustment of the pneumatic pressure and DC voltage, the meniscus should be in an appropriate shape for jetting as shown in Supplementary Figure S1.",
    "Set a negative pulse voltage with the parameters of trise = 0 ~ 100 µs, tdwell = 300 µs, and tfall = 0 µs7 (Figure 3) in the software menu.\nApply the negative pulse voltage at the substrate holder. Then, adjust the magnitude of the pulse voltage, Vpulse, to produce one droplet per single pulse voltage.\n\t\tNote: The magnitude of the negative pulse voltage, Vpulse, should be lower than 600 V.\nAdjust the DC background and pulse voltages to obtain the target droplet size on the substrate while observing the jetted dots on the substrate in the side view camera image.\n\t\tNote: To produce small dots with less spraying on the substrate, the magnitude of the pulse voltage, Vpulse, should be as low as possible.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57846/57846fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Pulse voltage for DOD EHD jetting.

Bitmap image has been widely used in DOD-based inkjet printing. However, in the case of printed electronics applications, CAD-based vector information has advantages over DOD-based inkjet printing, because it is efficient in line-based printing using a single EHD head. At the same time, the vector information can be converted into a bitmap image for bitmap image printing.\n\t\nBitmap image printing\nLoad a bitmap image in the printing tab of the printing software and convert it into a binary image.\nSet the parameters for the binary image printing. For instance, set the drop interval (i.e., the distance between 2 consecutive pixels) at 10 µm.",
    "Note: The bitmap image does not have any physical dimensions. The physical dimensions of the printed image will be related to the drop interval. For example, the printed image becomes larger if a larger drop interval is used. In conventional inkjet printing, dot per inch (DPI) has been commonly used for this purpose. However, it should be noted that a smaller DPI means a larger drop interval. In order to determine the drop interval, the printed dot size should be considered. In general, the drop interval for EHD DOD printing is significantly smaller than that of conventional inkjet printing.\nStart printing using the selected bitmap on the target location in the substrate.\nVector printing based on CAD information\nLoad the CAD information for printing.\n\t\t\tNote: The file format DXF, which is text-based CAD information, can be used for the printing information.\nSet the parameters for vector printing; for example, set the drop interval at 3 µm and the jetting frequency at 10 Hz.\n\t\t\tNote: To print the connected line patterns, the drop interval should be chosen so that adjacently deposited drops slightly overlap. However, too much overlapping may result in a larger line width. An overlapping of about 30% is recommended for any practical line printing. In the case of vector printing, the motion speed (v) the following equation.\n\t\t\tv = d × f\n\t\t\tHere,\nd = the drop interval, and\nf = the jetting frequency.\nPrint the loaded patterns on the substrate using pre-determined printing parameters, such as the drop interval, the printing speed, the voltage, etc.\n\t\t\tNote: After printing, a sintering process might be required to obtain the desired conductivity of the printed patterns, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\n2. Fine Conductive Line Patterning Using Near-field Electrospinning",
    "Make near-field electrospinning (NFES) ink for conductive line printing.\n\t\nMix ethanol and deionized (DI) water with a volume ratio of 3 (ethanol) to 1 (DI water) to prepare solvent 1. For example, mix 9 ml of ethanol and 3 ml of DI water to make 12 ml of solvent 1.\nMix 0.3 g of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mwt = 400,000) and 9.7 g of the prepared solvent 1 to make a polymer solution with 3 wt% of PEO by stirring, using a magnetic stirrer for more than 6 h at room temperature (25 °C).\nMix Ag nano paste ink, which has a viscosity of about 11,000 cP, and the prepared polymer solution, with a weight ratio of 5 (Ag nano paste ink) to 1 (polymer solution) by using a vortex mixer for 10 min to obtain the ink for NFES. For example, 10 g of Ag nano paste ink and 2 g of polymer solution can be mixed to obtain the NFES ink.\n\t\tNote: In this protocol, the ratio of the mixing materials is generally more important than the specific amount of the materials. Commercially available Ag nano paste ink for screen printing purposes, which has Ag solid contents of about 85.5 wt%, can be used for this purpose. Note that the selection of the solvent and the polymer could differ based on the composition of the ink that is used.\nFill the prepared NFES ink in the syringe.\nConnect the syringe with a nozzle via the connecting tube.\n\tNote: A commercially available syringe needle with an ID of 100 µm can be used for the nozzle.\nSupply the ink to the nozzle by pushing the syringe manually.\nInstall the syringe in the syringe motor, which is attached to the printing system.",
    "Place a substrate on the vacuum chuck and turn on the vacuum pump to hold the substrate during the printing.\nControl the Z-position (stage) to adjust the stand-off distance.\n\tNote: The recommended stand-off distance should be around 2 mm, which is a significantly smaller stand-off distance compared to the one used with conventional electrospinning.\nAdjust the flow rate \nOperate the syringe pump to fill the NFES ink in the nozzle assembly and generate an ink flow with an initial flow rate of 50 µL/min, which is higher than the target flow rate.\nSet a target flow rate of 1 µL/min when the ink flows out of the nozzle tip.\n\t\tNote: A smaller flow rate can result in a smaller pattern width. However, it could cause line breakage. The trade-off between the line width and the continuation of the line should be considered when the target flow rate is determined.\nApply voltage\nConnect the DC voltage source to the nozzle connector and connect the ground voltage to the substrate holder.\nIncrease the DC voltage gradually to 1.5 kV.\n\t\tNote: Since the stand-off distance is in the range of a few millimeters, the DC voltage could be increased up to 2 kV, which is higher than that of DOD EHD jet printing. However, a DC voltage higher than 2 kV should be avoided since it might damage the functional material, especially Ag paste ink, added to the polymer solution. In general, a lower DC voltage is recommended when a thinner printed line is required. However, the printed lines could be easily disconnected when a low voltage is used, because the pulling force for continuous ink printing is related to the DC voltage. Considering the trade-offs, we recommend the use of a DC voltage ranging from 1 kV to 2 kV.",
    "Start the idle printing with a printing speed of 300 mm/s for more than 10 min to obtain a steady-state flow. Adjust the printing parameters such as the DC voltage and flow rate during the idle printing to obtain the desired printing results.\n\tNote: Idle printing of more than 10 min is required to obtain a steady-state flow because the viscous ink can be compressed in the lengthy tubing during the ink delivery to the nozzle tip. Without idle printing, the printed line width may change with time. The idle printing speed should, thus, be the same as the actual printing speed so that the jetting parameters can be adjusted during the printing. In this way, the DC voltage is adjusted during the idle printing to obtain the target line width. Note that the flow rate and DC voltage should be balanced, so that the amount of ink pushed by the syringe pump can be equal to the amount of ink pulled down by the electrical field.\nChoose the printing pattern, such as a continuous line and grid patterns.\n\tNote: Since the produced fiber can easily be deflected and can be randomly deposited because of the charge repulsion force generated by the printed lines, the printing speed should be greater than 300 mm/s to align the pattern with the printing directions, and the spacing between the printed lines is recommended to be more than 100 µm in order to print the gird or line patterns.\nPrint the selected pattern on the substrate using pre-determined printing parameters.\n\tNote: A sintering process might be required to obtain the target functionalities of the printed patterns, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\nSubscription Required.
