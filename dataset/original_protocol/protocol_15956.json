    "Mice are infected either orally or intraperitoneally with cysts of the ME49 strain of T. gondii. Although the natural route of infection with T. gondii is not intraperitoneal, this model has the advantage of allowing direct access to the site of primary infection for collection of cells and of samples for measurement of cytokine concentrations (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]). To track infection and study host-parasite interactions in vivo, mice can be infected intraperitoneally with tachyzoites of transgenic parasites that express fluorescent proteins, bioluminescent markers, or a model antigen.\nMaterials\nFemale mice (C57BL/6, CBA/Ca, or Swiss-Webster) chronically infected (>1 month) with the ME49 strain of T. gondii (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0008]).\n70% ethanol\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 (Current Protocols, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0017])\nTachyzoites of transgenic expressing fluorescent proteins (such as ME49/PTG-GFP, ATCC 50941, dual fluorescent stage specific reporter strain available through L.M.

    "1. Obtain tissue cysts of the ME49 strain of T. gondii from brains of chronically infected mice (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0008]) as follows. After sacrificing T. gondii-infected mice by inhalation of CO2 (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0025]), clean their heads with 70% ethanol. Incise the skin to expose the skull.\n2. With a pair of small curved scissors, open the skull to expose the brain. Remove the brain with forceps and place it in a mortar.\n3. Grind the brain using a pestle, then add 1 ml PBS per brain. Homogenize the brain suspension using repeated aspiration and ejection from a 1- or 3-ml syringe fitted with a 22-G needle.\n4. Determine the concentration of tissue cysts in the brain suspension by transferring three 20-µl samples of the suspension onto microscope slides. Place a 22-mm × 22-mm coverslip over each sample and count the number of cysts in the entire sample under 100× magnification. Using the average of these three numbers, calculate the concentration of cysts per ml of brain suspension.\n5. Dilute brain suspension with PBS to adjust to desired final concentration of tissue cysts (50 to 500 per ml).\nInvestigators have used different doses based upon this range of concentrations for similar purposes.\n6a. If the intraperitoneal route of infection is chosen: Administer 0.2 ml of the brain suspension (usually 10 to 20 tissue cysts) to specific-pathogen-free female mice intraperitoneally using a 22-G needle (Donovan & Brown, 2006c[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0026]).\nDifferences in susceptibility between BALB/c and CBA/Ca mice become more apparent as higher numbers of cysts are used. After infection with 20, 40, or 80 cysts intraperitoneally, 12%, 50%, or 75%, respectively, of infected BALB/c mice die within 3 weeks post-infection, whereas mortality is not observed in infected CBA/Ca mice during that period of time (Suzuki et al., 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0095]).",
    "6b. If the oral route of infection is chosen: Use an 18-G, 1.5 in. gavage needle to administer 0.2 ml cyst suspension (usually 10 to 100 cysts) to specific-pathogen-free female mice.\n6c. If transgenic parasites that express fluorescent or bioluminescent markers and/or a model antigen are chosen: Maintain tachyzoites by culturing them in human foreskin fibroblasts as described in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0009]. Release and harvest tachyzoites (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0009]). Remove human cells from tachyzoite suspension (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0009]). Inject specific-pathogen-free mice intraperitoneally (Donovan & Brown, 2006c[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0026]) with tachyzoites resuspended in PBS.\nDoses of 4 × 102 to 1 × 105 parasites have been used by investigators.\n7. Assess progression of infection and/or immune response (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]).",
    "Mice are infected with cysts of the ME49 strain (either orally or intraperitoneally) or infected intraperitoneally with tachyzoites of tissue cyst forming strains of the parasite (such as PTG/ME49, Prugniaud) that express fluorescent or bioluminescent markers or model antigens. See Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0006] for studies with the EGS strain of T. gondii. Animals can be studied for development of toxoplasmic encephalitis and toxoplasma retinochoroiditis at various times post-infection beginning at 2 weeks, but usually at 4 weeks, after infection.\nMaterials\nSpecific-pathogen-free female mice from a susceptible strain (6 to 8 weeks old; see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-tbl-0001] for strain susceptibility; for maintenance see Donovan & Brown, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0027])\nMethoxyflurane (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0025])\nPBS, pH 7.2 (Current Protocols, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0017])\n      \n30-ml syringe equipped with 22-G needle or straight 24-G gavage needle\nForceps\nSmall curved scissors\n      \nAdditional reagents and equipment for induction of T. gondii infection in mice and removing mouse brain (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001]), anesthesia of mice (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0025]), and assessment of T. gondii infection (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007])\n1.

Anesthetize mice with methoxyflurane (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0025]) at various times post-infection (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007] for clinical assessment). Open the thoracic cavity and perfuse the circulatory system by injecting 20 ml PBS through the left ventricle using a 30-ml syringe with a 22-G needle or a straight 24-G gavage needle, to remove blood from the brain.\nEvaluation of levels of cytokine transcripts in the brain and eye may lead to erroneous conclusions if there is contamination with blood.",
    "3. Remove the brain as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001], then assess progression of toxoplasmic encephalitis (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]).\nThe cerebral hemispheres can be separated sagittally if more than one parameter is going to be used to evaluate toxoplasmic encephalitis (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]).\n4. Remove the eyes by gently pressing around the eye socket until the eye globe is displaced. Open the scissors halfway and gently place them under the eye globe without closing the scissors. Rotate the scissors 90⁰ upwards until the eye globe releases from the socket while continuing to hold the mouse still on a flat surface.\n5. Assess progression of infection and/or immune response (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]).",
    "T. gondii reaches the brain and retina hematogenously either as circulating free tachyzoites or within infected leukocytes (Courret et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0016]; Konradt et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0058]; Lambert et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0060]; Lopez Corcino, Portillo & Subauste, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0064]; Portillo et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0075]). Mice are infected intravenously to simulate this route of dissemination. This model provides a useful technique for the study of invasion of the brain and retina. The use of fluorescence or bioluminescent parasites allows for tracing of parasite.\nMaterials\nSpecific-pathogen-free female mice (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001])\nTachyzoites of transgenic expressing fluorescent proteins (such as ME49/PTG-GFP; see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001])\nAnesthetic agent (ketamine/xylazine cocktail, isoflurane anesthesia system)\n      \nAnimal restrainer\nInfrared heat lamp or other heating device\nTopical wintergreen oil\nGauze sponges\n1-ml syringe with a 27- to 30-G needle\n1.

When challenging mice with infected leukocytes, purify CD11b+ cells from mouse blood on day 7 post-infection with ME49 tissue cysts (Courret et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0016]), or collect mouse dendritic cells (DC 2.4 cell line) 24 hr post-infection with Type II strain of T. gondii (PTG) (Lopez Corcino, Portillo & Subauste, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0064]; Portillo et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0075]).

Anesthetize the mouse and place in a restraint device.",
    "4. Gently mix suspensions of tachyzoites or infected cells.\n5. Using the heat lamp, gently warm the tail of the restrained animal by placing the lamp roughly 10 to 12 in. above the mouse for a few seconds.\n6. To further encourage vasodilation of the tail vein, apply a wintergreen oil-soaked gauze onto the tail vein.\n7. Hold the warmed tail flat and locate either of the two lateral tail veins before picking up the pre-filled needle with the dominant hand.\n8. Insert the needle a few millimeters into the skin above the visible tail vein with the bevel facing away from the mouse. Push the needle upwards towards the base of the tail and keep the syringe parallel.\n9. Slowly inject 0.2 ml of parasite or cell suspension into the tail vein (Diehl et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0023]). If there is resistance, slowly remove the needle and attempt again by moving further up the tail.\n10. After injection, leave the needle in the tail vein for a few seconds to allow injected volume to clear the vein before removing the needle slowly. Apply pressure with gauze to reduce bleeding.\n11. Place the anesthetized mouse on a heating pad and monitor recovery for 5 to 10 min.\n12. Return the animal back to the original cage and wait ∼24 to 48 hr before euthanizing the mouse.\n13. Evaluate progression of infection (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]).",
    "SCID mice infected with the ME49 strain of T. gondii die within 2 to 3 weeks post-infection. Sulfadiazine (200 mg per liter of drinking water) can be administered to establish a “chronic” infection. Reactivation of infection and death will occur after discontinuation of sulfadiazine. This has been used as a model that attempts to mimic the pathogenesis of toxoplasmic encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals.

    "Mortality after cessation of sulfadiazine appears to depend on the time that treatment is started post-infection. Mice that received sulfadiazine beginning 3 days post-infection died within 3 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, when sulfadiazine was started 10 days post-infection, mice died within 6 to 9 days after treatment was stopped (Beaman et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0004]; Johnson, 1992a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0051]).\n4.

    "Progression of T. gondii infection and immune response to the parasite can be monitored by the following parameters: signs of illness and time until death; histopathology to assess inflammatory changes and changes in tissue architecture induced by the infection as well as to establish the presence of the parasite in tissues (immunohistochemistry); tissue levels of parasite DNA and mRNA for genes expressed specifically in the tachyzoite stage (parasite load); bioluminescence imaging to examine in real time the progression of infection; cytokine levels in serum and other body fluids; mRNA levels of cytokines and other molecules involved in the immune response against the parasite; flow cytometry to detect changes in the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in different organs, cell activation and T cell expansion; lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production after in vitro stimulation with T. gondii; serum titers of T. gondii antibodies. Depending on the purpose of the experiment, the investigator should choose one or more of these parameters as appropriate, as well as the timing of evaluation after infection (see Anticipated Results).\nClinical Assessment\nExamine animals twice daily.

    "At least 2 weeks post-infection of immunocompetent mice, or at weekly intervals after cessation of sulfadiazine when using the model of reactivation in SCID mice, the number of cysts in the brain can be enumerated to assess infections. The number of cysts present appears to be an important factor in the development of toxoplasmic encephalitis. To determine the number of cysts present, homogenize half of the brain in PBS using a mortar and pestle and count cysts using three 20-µl samples per brain (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001] for details of these procedures). The final number of cysts per brain will represent the average of those calculated with each sample. Tissue cysts can also be counted in brain sections stained with anti-T. gondii antibodies. The number of tissue cysts can be determined by examining 100 randomly selected high power fields. Animals with toxoplasmic encephalitis can exhibit not only tissue cysts but also tachyzoites within parasitophorous vacuoles.\nIn Vivo Assessment of Parasite Growth by Bioluminescence Imaging",
    "Bioluminescence imaging can be utilized as a tool for serial and non-lethal quantification of T. gondii in vivo (Dellacasa-Lindberg et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0019]; Hitziger et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0041]). Type I and Type II parasites that express a construct that encodes firefly luciferase have been developed. Exposure to D-luciferin, the substrate for firefly luciferase, results in light emission that can be detected externally by photon detectors such as charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras. D-luciferin is non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that diffuses widely within the mouse and can even cross the blood brain barrier. At different times after infection with parasites that encode firefly luciferase, mice receive an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 to 3 mg of D-luciferin potassium salt. Mice are anesthetized and photonic emission is quantitated. There is a direct correlation between photon flux levels and parasite load allowing for in vivo parasite quantification during acute T. gondii infection and recrudescence of infection in the central nervous system.\nIn Vivo Assessment of T. gondii Stage Conversion Using Dual Fluorescent Stage Specific Reporter Strains of the Parasite\nInitial studies of the formation of bradyzoite-containing tissue cysts were limited to brains collected from chronically infected mice. In vitro and in vivo studies of stage conversion have been facilitated by the development of dual fluorescent stage-specific reporter strains of T. gondii (Paredes-Santos et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0072]; Unno et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0098]; Zhang et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0106]). These include the Type II PLK strain and the EGS strain of T. gondii that stably express fluorescent proteins under the control of tachyzoite-specific SAG-1 promoter and bradyzoite-specific BAG-1 promoter. These strains have been used to examine stage conversion in infected mice. In addition, they can be used to examine reactivation of chronic infection in chronically infected mice given dexamethasone (10 mg/L) in their drinking water (Unno et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0098]; Zhang et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0106]).",

Collect serum samples pre- and post-infection either through tail bleeds (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0024]), or at the time of euthanasia, and store at −70°C. These serum samples as well as peritoneal lavage fluid can be used to measure levels of cytokines and chemokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 by ELISA or bead array kits (Chapter 6). Alternatively, mRNA levels of IFN-γ, TNF- α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12/23p40, TGF-β, IL-27 (IL-27p28, EBI3), MCP-1 can be measured by real time quantitative PCR using RNA prepared from various tissue samples including spleen, liver, lung, and peritoneal cells during the first two weeks post-infection (James, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0047]). Cytokine and nitric oxide production as well as T cell proliferative responses may also be studied using flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation of splenocytes, lymph node or peritoneal cells with T. gondii antigenic preparations (tachyzoites or parasite lysate antigens) and either concanavalin A, anti- CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs or LPS as controls. Optimal concentrations of antigenic preparations and duration of in vitro stimulation need to be determined by the investigator. Cytokine production can be assessed by ELISA, bead array kits or flow cytometry (to examine intracellular cytokine levels). In vivo T cell replication can be examined by adoptively transferring CFSE- labeled T cells. The use of T. gondii that express model antigen such as OVA, OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice and MHC class I tetramers to detect OVA-specific CD8+ T cells enable the study of in vivo expansion of OVA-reactive T cells using flow cytometry.",

    "The development of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters has enabled the in vivo tracking of cells within living tissues using multiphoton microscopy. Host-T. gondii interactions have been studied using parasites that express OVA peptide secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole plus a fluorescent label together with OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice (Chtanova et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0015]; John et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0049]; Schaeffer et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0083]; Wilson et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0103]). To facilitate tracking of antigen-specific T cells, mice are generated in which only a subset of T cells are OVA-specific and express a fluorescent marker. This can be accomplished by adoptive transfer of TCR transgenic T cells to adult mice or by administration of bone marrow cells from transgenic mice into newborn animals (hematopoietic chimeric mice). These models can be used for in vivo imaging of cellular interactions during primary or recall immune responses in lymphoid organs as well as cellular interactions in the brain of T. gondii infected mice. Lymphoid organs (typically draining lymph nodes) or brains are removed from infected mice euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Lymph nodes or slices of brains can be placed in an imaging chamber and perfused with medium at 37°C bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Organs are then subjected to multiphoton microscopy.",
    "For studies of primary immune responses to T. gondii infection, naive mice have been adoptively transferred with TCR transgenic T cells (OT1GFP) followed by intraperitoneal infection with transgenic parasites (1 × 104 PruOVA tachyzoites) followed by isolation of draining lymph nodes (John et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0049]). For studies of recall immunity, hematopoietic chimeric mice immunized with PruOVA (1 × 106 irradiated parasites intraperitoneally) received a subcutaneous challenge with 5 × 106 parasites followed by collection of draining lymph nodes (Chtanova et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0015]). For studies of cell interactions in the brain, mice that express OT1GFP or OT1CFP T cells via adoptive transfer or generation of hematopoietic chimeras have been infected with PruOVA (4 × 102 to 1 × 104 parasites intraperitoneally) followed by collection of infected brains (Schaeffer et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0083]; Wilson et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0103]). The availability of mice that express fluorescent proteins under promoters specific for various cell types or cytokines also allows the in vivo tracking of other aspects of the immune response against the parasite. For studies of parasite trafficking through the blood brain barrier, two-photon microscopy intravital imaging was used in transgenic mice expressing EGFP-Claudin 5 under a Tie2 endothelial cell promoter infected with tdTomato-expressing Type II T. gondii (Schneider et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0087]). To view immune cell infiltration, anti-CD45 antibodies can be administered intravenously 24 hr before beginning microscopy (Schneider et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0087]). Whole brains from infected mice can be removed and examined ex vivo using two-photon microscopy (Olivera et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0069]).\nAssessment of Antibody Responses",
    "Collect serum either through tail bleeds (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0024]) or at the time of euthanasia and store at −70°C. Development of T. gondii antibodies can be studied in sera collected between days 7 and 14. Specific IgG antibodies can be detected using the agglutination test (Desmonts & Remington, 1980[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0022]). IgG titers can be detected in murine sera by ELISA (Lopez Corcino, Gonzalez Ferrer et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0063]).\nAssessment of In Vivo Parasite Dissemination\nDepending on the experimental goals, at various times post-infection, leukocyte distribution can be assessed by flow cytometry in various lymphoid tissues including spleen, peritoneum, intestinal mucosa, and mesenteric lymph nodes, as well as other lymph nodes and brain. Parasite load in various organs can be examined using B1 gene qPCR (see above in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]). Multiphoton imaging through either thinned or open skill surgery can be performed to view infection of and egress from endothelial cells as well as breaching of the blood brain barrier (Konradt et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0058]). Focal areas of parasite infection can be determined through immunohistochemistry of brain sections by staining endothelial cells using Tomato Lectin or anti-CD31 mAb and staining T. gondii using polyclonal or anti-SAG1 antibodies, or the use of fluorescent parasites (see above in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0007]) (Lopez Corcino, Portillo & Subauste, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0064]; Portillo et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0075]). Flow cytometry can also be used as a method of quantification and detection of fluorescent T. gondii-infected endothelial cells (CD31+ and CD102+) (Konradt et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-bib-0058]).",

    "The number of organisms added will depend on the size of the flask and on how quickly the parasites will be needed for an experiment. For example, addition of 5 × 106 tachyzoites of the RH strain to a 25-cm2 flask (or 15 × 106 to a 75-cm2 flask) will lyse the HFF monolayer within 2 days. Biweekly passage of RH tachyzoites is usually possible by infecting monolayers with one-tenth of the dose mentioned above.\n2. Aspirate and discard culture medium from a flask containing a confluent monolayer of human foreskin fibroblasts.\n3. Add the medium containing the desired number of tachyzoites, prepared in step 2, to the monolayer and incubate at 37°C (for RH and Prugniaud strains) or 33°C (for temperature-sensitive mutant ts-4 strain).\nUnder the lower temperature conditions, tachyzoites of the ts-4 strain will proliferate and lyse fibroblasts.\n4. Examine monolayers daily using an inverted phase-contrast microscope.\nReplicating intracellular organisms will form rosettes within fibroblasts.\n5. When the majority of fibroblasts contain multiple intracellular tachyzoites, release organisms by destroying the monolayer using a cell scraper.\nFrom this point on, appropriate numbers of tachyzoites can be added to another HFF monolayer, or tachyzoites can be used for in vitro or in vivo experiments. In situations in which it is not necessary to obtain parasite preparations with optimal viability (i.e., where organisms will be used for preparation of T. gondii lysate antigens; see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0011]), culture medium containing extracellular tachyzoites can be collected after the monolayer has been destroyed by the parasite.",

    "Our knowledge regarding the processes and mechanisms that regulate tissue cyst formation is still incomplete. Purification of tissue cysts allows for the observation of cysts with variable composition.

Layer the brain homogenate on the top of the 20% Percoll gradient as described above.\nReduce mixing the 20% Percoll layer with the brain homogenate.\n7. Transfer the Percoll gradient into a centrifuge bucket in a cool (4°C) tabletop centrifuge. Centrifuge gradient 15 to 18 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, with full break setting.\n8. Prepare ∼18 1.5-ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes to collect 1 ml gradient fractions.\n9. A distinct RBC layer will be present at the 90/40% Percoll boundary, and the brain homogenate will remain on the top layer. The tissue cysts are concentrated between these two areas.\nDensity calibration beads can also be used to determine relative equilibrium densities.\n10. Remove the brain homogenate from the top of the gradient using a broken serological pipette.\n11. Once the brain homogenate is removed, gently pipette up 1 ml of the tissue cyst-containing gradient layer. Place each 1 ml faction into a designated numbered tube.",
    "12. Count the number of tissue cysts in each fraction (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.871#cpz1871-prot-0001], step 4).\n13. For further experimentation, dilute fraction samples with PBS (5-fold dilution) and centrifuge 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, to pellet tissue cysts."
