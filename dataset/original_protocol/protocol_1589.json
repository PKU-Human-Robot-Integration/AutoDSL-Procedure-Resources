    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nP53-KO haESCs daily culture\nTiming: 1 week\nSeed each well of a 6-well TC-plate with ∼1.0 × 105 feeder cells in MEF medium for 12 h.\nThaw a vial of frozen p53-KO haESCs as quickly as possible, and resuspend them in ESC medium.\nReplace the MEF medium with ESC medium each well, and seed the p53-KO haESCs. Typically, ∼5.0 × 105 haESCs can be plated per well of a 6-well TC plate.\nCulture the cells at 5% CO2 and 37°C, and change the medium every day. Healthy haESC colonies appear as domed and bright and present with clear edges.\nPassage the haESCs every other day or when the cells reach 90% confluency. To passage the cells, incubate them with 0.05% (vol/vol) trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37°C, add two volumes of MEF medium to stop trypsinizing, and mix the cell suspension gently. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min, discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet, and plate them on a fresh feeder-coated well.\nCritical: The cell lines used in your research should be regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination.\nCritical: p53-KO haESCs also need regular sorting for haploid enrichment; thus, the interval period of sorting should not exceed 3 weeks.\nConstruction of a Cdx2 overexpression Tet-on system in p53-KO haESCs\nTiming: 10 days\nCdx2 plays important roles in trophectoderm specification, and its overexpression can induce trophectoderm fate in cell cultures of mouse ESCs (Niwa et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Tet-on system is a widely used system to conditionally regulate the expression of desired genes (Woltjen et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).",
    "Prepare plasmids mixture in R buffer. For example, ∼2 × 106 cells are mixed with 3 μg of Cdx2 overexpression vector, 3 μg of PB-rtTA-Hygr plasmid and 1 μg of PBase plasmid in 100 μL of R buffer.\nWash the cells with PBS, dissociate them using 0.05% (vol/vol) trypsin-EDTA for 3 min at 37°C, and halt the reaction by adding two volumes of MEF medium.\nTransfer the cell suspensions into 15-mL tubes, and count viable cells with a cell counter.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 3 min, and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells with the mixture comprising the plasmids and R buffer.\nPerform transfection with an electroporator with the transfection kit using the following parameters: 1400 V; 10 ms; 3 pulses.\nPlate the electroporated cells back onto dishes precoated with fibronectin, and add ESC medium. Each well of a 6-well TC plate is coated with 1 mL fibronectin (final, 16.7 mg/mL) at 37°C for 12 h.\nAdd hygromycin (final concentration: 150 μg/mL) into the medium 2–3 days after electroporation for selection. Replace the medium every day, and culture with hygromycin for 7 days.\nPassage the surviving cells according to step 5, and seed the cells in feeder-cell-coated dishes with ESC medium, these haESCs should be referred to as Cdx2 overexpression (Cdx2-OE) Tet-on haESCs.\nGenotype for Cdx2-OE Tet-on haESCs as indicted in “Before you begin”, steps 14–17 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Primer pairs for Cdx2-OE Tet-on identification are shown in the “key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]”.\nCritical: Nonelectroporated cells must be prepared and treated with hygromycin as a negative control. Hygromycin must be removed from the cultures in advance once all the control cells are dead.",
    "Critical: You should sort for haploid cells after electroporation and selection for hygromycin because the cells undergo severe cell death and self-diploidization during these procedures. A high proportion of haploid cells in the initial Cdx2-OE Tet-on haESC population is essential for the successful establishment of derivation of haiTSCs.\nInduction of TSCs from Cdx2-OE Tet-on haESCs\nTiming: 7 days\nAdd 1 mL of 0.1% (wt/vol) gelatin per well to a 6-well TC plate, and incubate at 37°C for 12 h.\nSelect newly haploidy enriched Cdx2-OE Tet-on haESCs for induction, dissociate the cells with 0.25% (vol/vol) trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 3 min to ensure the generation of single cells, and halt the reaction with MEF medium.\nCentrifuge the cells in 15-mL tubes at 200 × g for 3 min, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells and plate them in gelatin-coated wells with TSC medium containing 1 μg/mL Dox. Typically, ∼2.0 × 105 cells are seeded per well of a 6-well TC plate.\nCulture the cells at 5% CO2 and 37°C, and change the medium every day. Approximately 3–4 days later, a few typical TSC colonies begin to appear in the cell cultures instead of domed ESC colonies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1154-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(D) Schematic showing the sorting of haploid cells from cultured haiTSCs. R1 is a gate for live cells; R2 is a gate to eliminate debris and doublets or clumps; and the 1n peak represents haploid cells from the cell cultures.\nPassage the confluent cell cultures according to steps 16–18. The suggested splitting ratio is 1:2.\nCritical: An appropriate concentration of Dox is important because a high concentration of Dox is toxic and affects cell viability. A concentration of 1 μg/ml is suggested according to our experiments (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D, Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1154-Mmc1.pdf]).\nSorting for CDCP1-positive cells\nTiming: 2 h\nCDCP1 is a specific marker of mouse TSCs, the antibody of which is extensively used for TSC enrichment (Rugg-Gunn et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nDissociate the cell cultures to a single-cell suspension according to steps 16 to 17, and incubate the cells with anti-CDCP1 primary antibody (10 μg/mL final concentration; diluted in blocking buffer) at 4°C for 30 min. Two hundred microliters of anti-CDCP1 solution are usually suggested for ∼5 × 106 cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min, discard the supernatant, wash each sample with 3 mL of PBS, and centrifuge again.\nDiscard the supernatant, and add 1 mL of diluted Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody. Gently mix, and incubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nWash each sample with 3 mL of PBS according to step 22. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend cells in 0.5 mL of TSC medium.\nFilter cells of each sample through a 40-μm cell strainer into a new 5-mL BD tube to remove cell clumps, and prepare a control sample in parallel.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh TSC medium in a new 5-mL BD tube as a harvesting tube, and run the samples on an EQ cell sorter.",
    "Transfer the sorted cells from the harvesting tubes into 15-mL tubes. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min, and resuspend the cells in TSC medium.\nPlate the cells in gelatin-coated 24-well TC plates with TSC medium. Usually, ∼1 × 105 cells are seeded per well of a 24-well TC plate.\nCritical: To accurately gate CDCP1-positive cells, wild-type (WT) ESCs were used in this procedure as a negative control (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: It is normal to lose cells during the centrifugation process. To ensure that a sufficient number of cells are sorted, the initial cell counts should be increased to ∼1 × 107.\nCritical: If the harvested cell amounts are low, the harvested cells should be directly plated onto gelatin-coated wells of a 24-well TC-plate to avoid losing cells.\nExpanding and sorting for haploid cells\nTiming: 7 days\nExpand the CDCP1-positive cells in TSC medium for 5–7 days to reach cell numbers sufficient for haploid cell sorting, and passage the cells with a splitting ratio of 1:4 to 1:6 when necessary during this period.\nPrepare Hoechst 33342 staining buffer (working solution: 5 μg/mL) diluted in DMEM/F12 medium.\nDissociate the cell cultures to single-cell suspensions according to steps 16 to 17.\nDiscard the supernatant, add the staining buffer, and mix gently. Usually, 3 mL staining buffer is added per one million cells.\nIncubate the mixture in a 37°C water bath for 30 min in the dark with gentle shaking every 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min, and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL of TSC medium.\nPrepare the cell samples according to steps 25 to 26, and set the sorting gate with a diploid control (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) before sorting the haploid cells.",
    "Plate the cells in gelatin-coated 24-well TC plates with TSC medium. Usually, ∼1 × 105 cells are seeded per well of a 24-well TC plate.\nCritical: To set a 1n peak (haploid cells in G0/G1 phase) accurately, a diploid control ESC line should be stained in parallel.\nCritical: Staining buffer should be preheated in a 37°C water bath and protected from light.\nDerivation of haiTSCs\nTiming: 7 days\nExpand the haploid-enriched cells for 5–7 days, and sort CDCP1-positive cells again according to steps 21 to 28. Usually, the percentage of CDCP1-positive cells can reach more than 80% with two sorting steps.\nExpand the sorted cells in TSC medium without Dox; these resulting cells can be defined as haiTSCs.\nExpand, freeze or perform other experiments with the haiTSCs as needed.\nImmunostaining and differentiation of haiTSCs\nTiming: 8 days\nPlace round cover slips into the wells of 24-well TC plates, and coat the wells with 0.1% (wt/vol) gelatin for 12 h.\nSeed the haiTSCs onto the gelatin-coated round cover slips, and culture them with TSC medium or differentiation medium (TSC basic medium without F4H) at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCulture haiTSCs for 2 days for regular cell immunostaining and 6 days for differentiated haiTSC immunostaining (Tanaka et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nWash the samples with PBS 3 times, and fix within 4% PFA for 30 min at 20°C–25°C .\nWash the samples with PBS 3 times, and permeabilize the cells with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate the samples with primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer at the required concentration) at 4°C for 12 h.\nWash the samples with PBS 3 times, and incubate them with secondary antibodies (diluted in PBS) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Wash the samples with PBS 3 times, and incubate them with Hoechst 33342 (1:200 diluted in PBS) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the samples with PBS 3 times, and use a confocal microscope to view and capture images (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1154-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Plate ∼5 × 105 GFP-positive cells per well of a 6-well plate on gelatin with TSC medium, and culture for another 3–4 days.\nConfirm the presence of the gene trapping vector in the genome in haiTSCs by PCR (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1154-Mmc1.pdf]).\nCritical: If the cell viability of electroporated cells is suboptimal or poor, you can prolong the culture days to recover from electroporation."
