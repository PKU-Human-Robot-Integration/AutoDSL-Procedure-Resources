    "Studies performed to optimize the methods for the Early Detection Program were approved by the Michigan State University Institutional Review Board. All figures were reproduced with contrived samples and are representative of the observed human results. No data, information, or results shown in the manuscript are from any participant in the Michigan State University Early Detection Program.\n1. Kit production\nNOTE: During kit assembly, wear masks, gloves, eye protection, and lab coats at all times to prevent kit component contamination.\nPreparation of kit components\n\t\nUsing a permanent marker, draw a line denoting 1 mL on the 25 mL conical tube. Using a permanent marker, draw a line denoting 1 mL on the transfer pipet.\nAdd four ceramic beads to the 5 mL sample tube. Pipet 1 mL of RNA stabilization solution into the sample tube and close the tube. Attach a barbell sticker consisting of a unique identifying code to sample tube with the data matrix barcode on the top and the identifier repeated in alphanumeric code on the side.\n\t\tNOTE: The ceramic beads are RNase/DNase-free and do not need to be further sterilized.\nPlace a 25 mL conical tube, 5 mL sample tube, transfer pipet, and small biohazard bag into the kit box (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t​NOTE: Conical tubes do not need to be DNase/RNase-free. Integrity of the sample is preserved by the RNA stabilization solution.\n2. Kit uses for self-sample collection\nAs per the kit instructions, ask the participants not to eat or drink 30 min prior to providing a sample. Ask the participants to spit into the 25 mL conical tube until 1 mL of saliva is collected (marked line).",
    "Using the pipet, transfer 1 mL of saliva (up to the marked line) into the 5 mL sample tube containing RNA stabilization solution and ceramic beads. Close and shake the sample tube for 15 s.\nAsk the participants to register the alphanumeric code assigned to sample on the designated website. Once done, ask them to place the sample tube in small biohazard bag and deposit into a collection bin.\n3. Sample intake and preparation for RNA isolation\nNOTE: All steps take place in a biosafety cabinet or centrifuge bucket with a biocontainment lid.\nDisinfect and visually inspect samples for quality control while still in the biohazard bag.\nReject the sample if (Figure 1): sample is of non-natural color (i.e., green, blue) or contains food particles or blood; sample is leaking or missing beads; sample has incorrect expected volume (<1.5 mL or >3 mL); sample does not have a barcode or alphanumeric code attached.\n\t\nIf the sample is rejected, scan and record the sample into a rejection file with a note as to why the sample was rejected. If sample is rejected because it has no identifiers, log the sample as No Barcode in the rejection file.\nIf sample is not rejected, cut open the biohazard bag with scissors and remove the sample tube. Vortex the tube for 15 s then place the sample tube into a tube adaptor for a swing-bucket centrifuge.\nOnce tube adapters are full, secure the biocontainment lid over the centrifuge bucket and transfer to the centrifuge. Centrifuge samples at 4,100 x g for 2 min and return samples to the biosafety cabinet.",
    "NOTE: Centrifugation is used to pellet debris and force more viscous material in saliva to the bottom of the tube. This eliminates the need for proteinase K in the process. A full run consists of 768 samples (eight 96-well plates full of sample after RNA isolation).\nWithout disturbing the pelleted material, transfer sample tubes to a 96-slot tube rack pre-labeled with the Run ID which includes the rack number (1-8), date, and the corresponding group the samples will be pooled/assessed with (an identifier to denote the group, i.e., group A is the first run of the day).\nWhen 96-slot tube racks are full or no samples remain, using a handheld barcode scanner, scan tubes into a plate map file (Supplementary File 1 for full pools; Supplementary File 2 for half size pools). In the event a barcode does not work, use the alphanumeric code on the tube to log the sample.\n\tNOTE: A mask is required to prevent the scanning of adjacent barcodes. A mask can be made by cutting a hole in opaque paper, then laminating it. Barcodes scanned into the plate map file will appear in the same orientation as in the 96-slot rack.\nSpray the sample tubes in the rack with 70% ethanol and dab dry with a paper towel.\n\tNOTE: Wiping the tubes instead of dabbing can damage the barcodes.\nLabel a 96-deep-well plate of 2 mL well capacity with the Run ID. Transfer 200 µL of saliva sample from each sample tube to the corresponding well of the 96-deep-well plate. If samples are too viscous to transfer, vortex and centrifuge again. Reject sample if problem remains.",
    "NOTE: Saliva samples can be stringy and leave a snail-trail across the plate during transfer if the technician is not careful. This can lead to initial false positives and more samples that will eventually need to be re-run in the confirmation step (see section 6).\nWhen all samples are transferred, cover the 96-deep-well plate with a silicone mat and store at room temperature. Save and store the 96-slot racks with remaining samples for confirmation of potentially positive samples.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. RNA isolation\nLabel a 96-well RNA isolation cartridge with the Run ID and place it on top of an empty collection plate.\n\tNOTE: Plates containing samples can be removed from the biosafety cabinet at this point.\nRemove the silicone mat from the 96-deep-well plate. Transfer 400 µL of viral loading buffer into each well of the 96-deep-well plate.\nMix each sample by gently pipetting up and down two to four times and transfer the entire sample to the corresponding column in the 96-well RNA isolation cartridge.\n\tNOTE: Mixing large volumes will create bubbles that may lead to contamination of neighboring wells if performed haphazardly. Mixing in a deliberate fashion can lower this risk and protect the integrity of downstream processing.\nCentrifuge the RNA isolation cartridge on top of the collection plate at 4,100 x g for 10 min to load samples onto the cartridge. Transfer the RNA isolation cartridge to a clean collection plate.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer to every well of the RNA isolation cartridge and centrifuge at 4,100 x g for 5 min. Transfer RNA isolation cartridge to a clean collection plate.",
    "Add 500 µL of wash buffer to every well of the RNA isolation cartridge and centrifuge at 4,100 x g for 5 min. Transfer RNA isolation cartridge to a clean collection plate.\nAdd 500 µL of 100% ethanol to every well of the RNA isolation cartridge and centrifuge at 4,100 x g for 5 min. Transfer RNA isolation cartridge to a clean collection plate.\n\tNOTE: If the sample has not completely gone through the column at this point, the sample is too viscous or small pieces of debris in the sample are clogging the column. The sample needs to be removed completely from the cartridge as to not contaminate the downstream pooling process, and the sample number added to the rejection file.\nCentrifuge the RNA isolation cartridge on top of the collection plate at 4,100 x g for 5 min to dry the columns. Transfer the RNA isolation cartridge onto a clean elution plate labeled with the Run ID and the word row, then place both on top of a clean collection plate.\nAdd 25 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to each well of the RNA isolation cartridge. Centrifuge at 4,100 x g for 10 min to elute the RNA. If sample does not completely elute, re-centrifuge the sample for 5 min.\nTransfer the elution plates onto pre-chilled cold plates and cover. Immediately proceed onto sample pooling and RT-qPCR.\n5. Sample pooling and RT-qPCR",
    "NOTE: The process is set up in a two-plate system (as seen in Figure 2). The elution RNA plate number corresponds to the produced column plate number and the row plate letter (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc.). For deconvolution purposes, the column plate row letter will correspond to the row letter from the RNA elution plate, and the row plate column number will correspond to the RNA elution plate column number. For example, a sample in RNA plate #6 in position C4 will be found in the row reaction plate position F4, and in the column reaction plate position C6.\nLabel a new elution plate with the Run ID and the word row, and place on a pre-chilled cold plate. Transfer 10 µL of RNA from each well on the row elution plate to the corresponding row on the column elution plate, thus making a copy of the original elution plate (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Elution plates marked column will be pooled in the column direction and elution plates marked row will be pooled in the row direction.\nFor the column pooled plate, transfer the entire volume from each well across the plate into the column number that corresponds to the Run ID plate number. For the row pooled plate, transfer the entire volume from each well up or down the plate into the row number that corresponds to the Run ID plate number (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.; Figure 2).\nTransfer 13 µL of each pooled sample into the corresponding column or row of a 96-well reaction plate (Figure 2).",
    "For this protocol, use three probes against the nucleocapsid (N), ORF1ab, and spike (S) genes to detect SARS-CoV-2, and a fourth primer probe targeting MS2 phage as an internal control. In the pooled samples, spike an MS2 phage positive control into the master mix. In samples run individually, spike MS2 phage into the sample on the RNA isolation cartridge and use as an extraction control.\n\tNOTE: Master mix, primer probes, fluorescent dyes, and quenchers will vary based on the assay. Appropriate ratios and fluorescent channels should be determined by each lab.\nPrepare the positive control by adding 2 µL of positive control solution and 11 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to the positive control well on the reaction plate (Figure 2).\nPrepare the no template control by adding 13 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to the negative control well on the reaction plate.\nMake master mix according to manufacturer's instructions and spike in MS2 phage positive control. Dispense 7 µL of master mix into each well of the 96-well reaction plates that contain samples or controls. Limit exposure to fluorescent light.\nCover reaction plates with optical film and vortex for 2 min to mix samples well. Centrifuge reaction plates at 650 x g for 5 min.\nTransfer plates into the RT-PCR system and run with cycling parameters appropriate for the master mix. For master mix used here, the following cycles were run: 25 °C for 2 min, 53 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, and 60 °C for 30s.\nOnce the samples are run, perform a deconvolution of the pools to identify potential positive samples manually (Figure 3) and via a R Script Shiny App.",
    "Export results from column and row reaction plates as spreadsheet files. Open the pool deconvolution R script Shiny app (source code available at: https://github.com/kochman1/JoVE-MSU-COVID-EDP).\nDrag and drop the plate map, column, and row files into the app and run the app. Save the list produced from the app.\n\t\t​NOTE: The list produced from the app contains all of the barcodes entered into the plate map and whether they are likely positive or negative based on the pool deconvolution script. These samples that are flagged as potential positives are reprocessed individually.\n6. Validation of positive samples\nLabel two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and an RNA extraction column for each sample that needs to be tested. Use one microcentrifuge tube for mixing sample, MS2 phage, and viral loading buffer, and the second microcentrifuge tube for the RNA elution step.\nAdd 5 µL of MS2 Phage RNA to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Transfer 200 µL of the potentially positive sample to the tube and add 400 µL of viral loading buffer to the tube, mix by pipetting.\nTransfer the entire contents to the pre-labeled RNA extraction column in a clean collection tube. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min. Aspirate flow through from the collection tube.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer to the RNA extraction column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min. Aspirate flow through from the collection tube.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer to the RNA extraction column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min. Aspirate flow through from the collection tube.",
    "Add 500 µL of 100% ethanol to the RNA extraction column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min. Transfer the RNA extraction column to a clean collection tube and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min to dry the column.\nTransfer the RNA extraction column to a pre-labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for elution. Add 25 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to the RNA extraction column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 2 min to collect the RNA and transfer tube to wet ice.\nMake master mix according to manufacturer's instructions. Dispense 7 µL of master mix into each well of a 96-well reaction plate that will contain the sample. Transfer 13 µL of each isolated RNA into the reaction plate.\n\tNOTE: The master mix is the same one used in the pooled sample protocol but does not include the MS2 phage RNA spike.\nPrepare the positive control by adding 2 µL of positive control solution and 11 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to the positive control well on the reaction plate. Prepare the no template control by adding 13 µL of DNase/RNase-free molecular grade water to the negative control well on the reaction plate.\nCover the reaction plates with optical film and vortex for 2 min to mix samples well. Centrifuge reaction plates at 650 x g for 5 min. Transfer plates into the RT-PCR system and run with cycling parameters appropriate for the master mix.\n\t\nFor master mix stated here, use 25 °C for 2 min, 53 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, and 60 °C for 30 s.\nSubscription Required.
