    "The rolled towel assay for maize seedling growth is an efficient and space-saving protocol for growing and phenotyping juvenile maize seedlings. This protocol can also be used to generate young maize tissue samples for molecular and biochemical assays. Here, we describe how to plant maize kernels, minimize fungal contamination, score for germination and synchronize seedling growth, perform imaging of seedlings, manually annotate traits (using ImageJ), and perform statistical analyses on the quantified traits. At the end of the process, the user will obtain high-quality images of juvenile maize seedlings that can be quantified and analyzed for phenotypes of interest. When done properly, there will be limited mold growth, and users will obtain healthy seedlings for observation and tissue collection for downstream applications. The key steps in this protocol are shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5876a3be-5cba-4e2d-8679-51d18977c32f/cpz1562-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nOverview of the initial steps in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-prot-0001]. First, maize kernels are surface-sterilized in bleach and rinsed with water three times before placement on three sheets of labeled, fungicide-treated Anchor seed germination paper. Towels are rolled up lengthwise, placed upright in a 2-L Nalgene beaker filled with 600 ml of 0.5× LS, and put into a growth chamber.\nMaterials\nMaize kernels of the desired genotype\nBleach solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-rec-0002])\nCaptan (Arysta Lifescience, EPA Reg: 66330-234, EPA Est.

For each genotype, create a stack of three germination papers and label the middle paper in the upper right-hand corner. Write your initials, the date, and the genotype. The papers can be labeled with a Sharpie permanent marker or a preprinted ToughTag label.\n2. For each genotype, count the number of required maize kernels and place them into a 50-ml conical tube. Set the tubes to the side.\nTypically, 10 kernels are sterilized per genotype per treatment per assay. Do not add more than 50 kernels to each tube.\n3. Fill each conical tube with 50 ml of freshly prepared 6% (v/v) bleach solution and gently invert the capped tube 2-3 times to evenly distribute the sterilization solution over the kernels. Let the kernels sit in the solution for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "4. While the kernels are being sterilized, make the Captan fungicide solution. The amount of Captan solution depends on the number of rolls being planted. Two (2) liters of Captan solution are sufficient for up to 30 rolls, and each roll will be planted with 10-12 kernels. Twelve rolls can fit into one 4 L beaker. To prepare 2 L of Captan solution, add 5 g of Captan to 2 L of MQ water. Mix the solution until at least some of the fungicide is dissolved. Because the fungicide is wettable, not all of the solid will fully dissolve in the water. Pour this solution into a plastic rectangular storage bin (such as a Sterilite 6QT Storage Box with the lid removed).\n5. At this point, the 10-min kernel sterilization (step 3) should be done. Drain the bleach into a beaker.\nDrain only one tube at a time. This ensures that the genotypes do not get mixed up if a kernel drops out of the tube. If a kernel drops out, place it back in the tube.\n6. Once all of the tubes are drained, wash each tube three times with sterilized deionized water. Invert the tubes a few times between each rinse to ensure that all of the kernels are fully rinsed.\n7. After the kernels are rinsed, planting can begin. To start, pour the Captan solution into the plastic storage box.\n8. Dip each stack of three papers into the Captan solution until the paper is soaked through. Pull a corner of the paper to lift the stack of germination papers to drain excess solution off the roll. While the paper should be wet, it should not be dripping.",
    "9. Place the papers on a cafeteria tray or benchtop such that the width is shorter than the length (see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0001]). Fold back the first paper towards the long edge so that the label in the upper right-hand corner is visible (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0001]).\n10. Place the maize kernels on the paper about 2.5 in. from the top. This does not need to be exact but ensures that the seedlings have optimal room for growth.\n11. Plant 10 kernels on each roll, taking care to evenly space the kernels, and arrange them with the seed scar pointing down.\n12. After the kernels have been placed on the roll, fold the top paper back to cover the kernels and ensure the papers are in line with each other.\n13. Fold the far edge of the paper so that it covers the first kernel in line. Creating this initial fold helps to stabilize the rest of the roll.\n14. To create the roll, hold the far edges of the paper tightly and begin to roll towards the other short edge. Roll tightly but not so tight that the paper is leaking water.\n15. Once the roll is done, place the roll upright in a 2-L Nalgene beaker with 600 ml of 0.5× LS, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0002], and place the beaker in a Percival E-41L2 (or similar) growth chamber containing Philips F25T8/TL741, 25 W, 36″ bulbs set at 16/8 hr light/darkness at 23°C and relative humidity. One 2-L Nalgene beaker can fit up to 12 rolls and a Percival E-41L2 can hold 24 beakers.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a0e9b599-a64b-4c78-b452-6e875fbe9c17/cpz1562-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Diagram of planted rolled towels. The rolled towels are oriented vertically in a 2-L Nalgene beaker such that the kernels are at the top of the paper rolls. The beaker contains 600 ml of 0.5× LS, which does not come into contact with the kernels.\n16. Two days after planting, check the rolls for germination. To do this, unroll each roll and inspect the kernels. Repeat this process daily, at the same time each day, until ≥70% germination per roll has been reached. Remove any ungerminated kernels at this point to avoid non-synchronous growth. Record the first day of germination and keep track of the subsequent growth days as “days after germination,” here abbreviated as DAG.\n17. Grow the seedlings for your desired amount of time, depending on the phenotype(s) of interest. Typically, primary root length can be scored beginning at 3 DAG and up to 10 DAG. Lateral root initiation can be scored in 5 to 6 DAG seedlings, while lateral root density should be calculated from 7 to 10 DAG seedlings. For growth assays longer than 2 DAG, replace the 0.5× LS every other day to ensure that the medium remains fresh. To do this, remove the towels from the beaker, pour off any old medium, and pour in 600 ml of fresh 0.5× LS.\nImaging\n18. Observe and image seedling phenotypes beginning at one DAG and up to 12 DAG. Most maize genotypes will have extensive root systems that reach the length of the towel at this age.\nHere, were provide example imaging and phenotyping data at 7 DAG.",
    "19. To image, place the roll on a neutral background, such as a countertop or cafeteria tray. Unroll the roll to make the seedlings visible and remove the top sheet of paper. The brown seedling germination paper can serve as a neutral background for photography. Alternatively, the seedlings can be removed from the seedling germination paper and placed on a neutral (black or blue) background suitable for photography.\n20. Use a cellphone or DSLR camera to image individuals or groups of seedlings, depending on your needs. Ensure that a ruler is in the frame of the picture for measurements. If a ToughTag was used to label the roll, then a ruler is unnecessary; the ToughTag can serve as a scale marker.\nIndividual photos of each seedling are ideal for manuscript-quality images. Images of 10 to 12 seedlings are ideal for increasing image annotation throughput. Typically, we image batches of 10 to 12 seedlings for annotation and also take individual pictures of 1 to 3 individual representative seedlings.\n21. If imaging individual seedlings, do this on a neutral photography background (black or blue) using a DSLR camera, and repeat for each genotype and treatment.\nFor the example provided here, the DSLR camera was mounted to an overhead tripod above a photography box containing a black photography backdrop (see Figs. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0003]-6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0006] for example images). Adjust and optimize the camera settings according to your system.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d2c178e7-e6ef-4381-a4a6-58d3f02dd7f5/cpz1562-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nBrassinosteroid treatment assays.

After imaging the seedlings, collect root and shoot tissues if needed for downstream applications (such as DNA, RNA, or protein extraction). Alternatively, discard the seedlings according to laboratory and institutional procedures.\nImage Annotation and Data Analysis\n23. Open the image files in ImageJ/Fiji. Set the global scale using the ruler or ToughTag in the image by selecting Analyze > Set Scale. Input the known distance and units, then select “Global”. After the scale has been set for the image, measure the root lengths using the segmented line tool in ImageJ/Fiji. Click on each root (or shoot) and trace the length of the organ using the segmented line tool. Select “Analyze > Measure”. Repeat for every seedling. Export measured values to a spreadsheet.\nThis same process can be repeated for measuring shoot or seminal root lengths.",
    "24. To calculate lateral root number, open the image files and manually count the number of lateral roots observed per seedling and record the values. First, to calculate lateral root density, measure primary root length as described in step 23. then divide the number of lateral roots by the primary root length (cm).\n25. Calculate the statistical significance for a given trait of interest using either a t-test statistic (if comparing two genotypes to one another) or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) if comparing genotype and treatment effects.\n26. Plot and visualize the measured traits in GraphPad or similar.\nSample data can be seen in Figures 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0003]-6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-fig-0006] and are discussed in Understanding Results.",
    "Here, we describe how to use the maize RTA described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-prot-0001] for hormone treatment assays. These experiments can evaluate hormone responses and dependent phenotypes. We outline the steps to perform these assays for brassinosteroids, cytokinin, jasmonic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid (auxin).\nBrassinosteroids are classical plant hormones that play key roles in numerous aspects of maize growth and development (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0022]; Sharma et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0032]; Yamoune et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0037]), including kernel size, drought tolerance, and mesocotyl elongation (Best et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0004]; Castorina et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0007]; Castorina & Consonni (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0006]); Hu et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0015]; Kir et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0017]; Kutschera & Wang, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0019]; Liu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0023]; Sun et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0034]). Cytokinins (CK) are key regulators of maize growth and development (Cho et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0008]; Muszynski et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0026]; Ramireddy et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0028]; Rivas et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0029]). Jasmonates are classical phytohormones associated with plant disease and developmental programs, including root elongation and leaf senescence (Huang, Liu, Liu, & Song, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0016]; Yan, Huang, Borrego, & Kolomiets, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0038]). Auxins are key plant phytohormones essential to the development of juvenile maize seedlings in regards to stress response, vasculature complexity, flower development, stress response, stem cell maintenance, and overall plant growth (Galli et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0011]; Kutschera & Wang, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0019]; LeClere, Schmelz, & Chourey, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0021]; Rivas et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0029]; Wang et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0036]; Zhang et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0040]; von Behrens et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0002]; Gallavotti et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0010]; Yao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0039]; Zhang et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-bib-0041]).\nWith these assays, users can evaluate numerous traits in response to a hormone of interest, including primary root length inhibition, increased seminal root number, and altered lateral root density (defined as the number of lateral roots per cm of primary root length).\nMaterials\nSame Materials as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-prot-0001]\n1 M brassinolide (BL, see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.562#cpz1562-rec-0003])",

At 3 DAG, prepare a fresh set of labeled, Captan-treated paper rolls as described in Basic Protocol step 4. This step is advisable to reduce mold growth and for easy record-keeping between treated and non-treated seedlings. Label fresh germination papers with the experimenter's initials, the initial date of germination, treatment (i.e., mock, BL, BAP, JA, or IAA), and genotype.\nFor each genotype, half the seedlings will be placed in a mock control solution, and the other half will be placed in the hormone solution.\nFor shorthand notation, BL is used as an abbreviation for brassinolide, BAP or CK is used for cytokinin, JA is used for jasmonic acid, and IAA is used for indole-3-acetic acid.\n3.

For the corresponding paired mock treatment, add 6 ml of 95% ethanol into 594 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker.\nJA",
    "For a 5 µM JA treatment, add 60 µl of a 50 mM JA stock to 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker. For the corresponding paired mock treatment, add 60 µl of 95% ethanol into 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker. For a 50 µM JA treatment, add 600 µl of a 50 mM JA stock into 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker. For the corresponding paired mock treatment, add 600 µl of 95% ethanol into 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker. For a 100 µM JA treatment, add 1.2 ml of a 50 mM JA stock into 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker. For the corresponding paired mock treatment, add 1.2 ml of 95% ethanol into 600 ml of 0.5× LS medium in a 2-L Nalgene beaker.\nTable 1.\n                Recommended Hormone Concentrations to Use for Growth Assays Based on Sample Data and Trait(s) to Score for After Hormone Treatment\ntable:\n﻿Hormone,Stock concentration,Solvent control,Root traits to score\nBrassinolide,1 M,95% ethanol,\"Primary root length, seminal root number\"\nBAP,10 mM,NaOH,\"Primary root length, shoot length, lateral root number, lateral root density\"\nIndole-3-acetic-acid,10 mM,95% ethanol,\"Primary root length, shoot length, seminal root length, lateral root density\"\nJasmonic acid,50 mM,95% ethanol,Primary root length\n5. Label each beaker with the corresponding mock or hormone treatment, along with your initials and the date of germination.\n6. Next, replant the seedlings onto the freshly treated germination papers as described in step 18. Place the current roll containing 3 DAG seedlings on a cafeteria tray (or benchtop) and unroll it so the juvenile seedlings are visible. On a second tray, place the labeled fresh Captan-treated germination papers from step 18.",
    "7. Wearing gloves, manually move the seedlings from the old stack of germination papers onto the new stack of papers, roll it up, and place the fresh rolls upright into the corresponding labeled beaker (i.e., mock or hormone). Each 2-L beaker can fit up to 12 rolls.\nOne beaker is required for each mock control and hormone treatment; this can be scaled up if more than 12 genotypes are to be tested simultaneously.\n8. Continue growing the seedlings for an additional 4 to 9 days, replacing both the mock and hormone solutions with freshly prepared medium every other day to account for evaporation and to ensure constant uniform hormone treatment across the duration of the assay.\n9.
