    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nCoat Coverslips\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nAdult cardiomyocytes have poor adhesion, coating coverslips with laminin can enhance adult cardiomyocytes adhesion.\nPlace a diameter 25 mm circular coverslip to a 6 well plate or 35 mm dishes by a fine-tip forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/176-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Coating Coverslip with Laminin\n(A) Put a coverslip into well.\n(B) Add laminin onto coverslip.\n(C) Spread the laminin over the coverslip.\nNote: Compared with 35 mm glass-bottom dishes, coverslip plus plate is much cheaper. Coverslips need to be autoclaved in advance.\nCoat the coverslips with 100 μL 40 μg/mL laminin, carefully spread the laminin to evenly over the coverslip using the pipette tip (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nAlternatives: Add 500 μL laminin to the coverslips, moving plates backward and forward, then right to left to right, repeat 2–3 times, let laminin spread evenly over the coverslip. It saves you time, but the cost is higher than add 100 laminins.\nNote: Plate coating should be done during cardiomyocyte collection (Lundgren et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This step is not necessary for cell types that have strong adhesion.\nGently put the plate with coated coverslip into a 37°C incubator for at least 1 h, but no more than 3 h.\nCulture Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nCardiomyocytes cultivation is for infecting Adeno-mt-cpYFP.\nTransfer freshly isolated cardiomyocytes according to our step-by-step STAR protocol (Tian X et al., 2020. https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/103[href=https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/103]) or other cultured cells to a 15 mL conical tube, centrifuge at 30 × g, 30 s.\nNote: The speed and time of centrifuge vary from different cell types. Cardiomyocytes are far larger than cell lines, 30 s is enough to get the cell sediment.\nDiscard the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend the pellet in 4–8 mL pre-warmed M199 culture medium.",
    "Count cardiomyocytes using a traditional Hemocytometer and dilute into 2.5 × 105/mL with M199 culture medium.\nTake out the coated plate and discard laminin with a pipette.\nCritical: Do not let the coverslip dry. The dry laminin cannot be reactivated for cell attachment.\nAdd 200 μL cardiomyocyte suspension at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells to a contained coverslip center, and the cells will automatically spread on the coverslip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/176-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Adult Cardiomyocytes Culture and Infection\n(A) Add 200 μL cardiomyocytes suspension onto the coated coverslip.\n(B) Add 1 mL M199 culture medium.\nGently put the plate into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, wait for at least 2 h, let cardiomyocytes attached to the coverslip.\nCritical: Appropriate cell number is very important for live-cell imaging. Too many will lead to a hard observation of a single cell after proliferation under the confocal microscope.\nPause Point: The plated cardiomyocytes can wait for up to 4 h to infect the virus.\nInfect Adeno-mt-cpYFP\nTiming: 2 days\nExpress mitoflash biomarker, mt-cpYFP, in the mitochondrial matrix of cardiomyocytes.\nAfter 2–4 h incubation, take out an aliquoted Ad-mt-cpYFP virus from −80°C and thaw it on ice.\nNote: The concentration of Ad-mt-cpYFP must be determined, aliquoted to 5–10 μL, and stored at −80°C to avoid repeated freezing and thawing, which will result in a decreased activity. If there are residual, return it to −80°C quickly.\nNote: It has been reported that Mito-Hyper can detect the same event as mt-cpYFP (Quatresous et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). It may as a viable alternative to cpYFP after extensively verified. We only used mt-cpYFP to detect mitoflash so far.\nGently discard the 200 μL medium and add 1 mL fresh M199 culture medium (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), the unattached cells will be discarded.",
    "Add proper Ad- mt-cpYFP (50 MOI) into the medium, gently move plates backward and forward, then right to left to right, repeat 2–3 times, let the virus spread evenly, incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1–2 h.\nNote: Add the virus in 1 mL medium can enhance the concentration of the virus to improve the infection efficiency of virus. Generally, the MOI of recombinant adenovirus from 20 to 100 is enough to infect cells (Gong et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTake out the plate and add 1 mL fresh M199 culture medium to each well (total 2 mL), incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h, let cpYFP expressing.\nNote: The virus can be left in the medium. It is not necessary to replace the medium the next day. Adult cardiomyocytes can be cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 for up to 5–6 days with the medium change every 2 days (Mitcheson et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Liu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPause Point: Mitoflashes imaging of cardiomyocytes can wait for up to 62 h after infection.\nConfocal Imaging\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nMonitor and take 2-dimension images of mitoflashes in adult cardiomyocytes.\nPre-warm the KHB buffer to room temperature (23°C–26°C).\nThaw TMRM work solution and add 2 μL per well (1:1,000) to stain mitochondrial membrane potential in a 37°C incubator for 20–30 min.\nNote: The TMRM not only serves to identify mitoflashes but also helps to identify the localization of cpYFP.\nSet the imaging parameters of Zen software: Dual excitation images of mt-cpYFP were taken by sequential excitation at 488 nm and 543 nm, and emission was collected at 505–545 nm and >560 nm, respectively. Time-lapse x,y images were acquired at 1,024 × 1,024 resolution for 100 frames and at a sampling rate of 1 s per frame (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/176-Fig4.jpg",

You’d better start Zen software first, completely turn on the 488 nm laser, 543 nm laser need 3–5 min.\nTake off the magnetic top of the Quick-Release Magnetic chamber, apply the high vacuum grease around the inside pedestal evenly of the Magnetic bottom (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/176-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Assemble Coverslip and Magnetic Chamber\n(A) The magnetic bottom with the high vacuum grease.\n(B) Place the coverslip into the magnetic bottom.\n(C) Put the magnetic top back and add 1ml KHB buffer.\nNote: The grease must be evenly spread. Otherwise, the solution will leak during the final imaging, which may damage the objective.\nUsing fine-tip forceps to get the coverslip out, put it on a Kimwipes cleaning paper to dry the bottom (without cells face) of the coverslip.\nPlace the coverslip into the magnetic bottom of the imaging chamber and put the magnetic top back (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C). The coverslip will be automatically adhered to the chamber by the magnetic power.\nCritical: To maintain the integrity of the coverslip, hold the edge of the coverslip with forceps. Do not use the fine-tip forceps to press the coverslip, as these can break the coverslips.\nAdd 1 mL KHB buffer with a pipette into the chamber (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: Put the imaging chamber on a Kimwipe to check for leakage.\nCritical: Steps 18–20 must be performed quickly (20–40 s), and carefully, otherwise, adult cardiomyocytes will eventually shrink and die after leaving the solution too long.\nAdd one drop of oil on top of the 63× objective, place chamber on microscope stage above objective (roughly in the center of the field of view).",
    "Find and focus the cell sample in the eyepieces, and move it to the center field of vision.\nChoose only 488 channel to pre-setup relevant imaging parameters (Gain 450–600; Pinhole 30–200; laser <10%.) by the live scan.\nClick on “Live” on the top left corner, then adjust the focal position by rotating the knob until the mitochondria are focused.\nAdjust laser power, pinhole, gain, digital offset.\nNote: Scan Mode: frame; Speed: 9; Averaging: number, 1; Gain 450–600; Pinhole 30–200; laser <10%. The laser too strong will damage the cell during a long time two dimensions (2D) scanning. You can use a higher laser for 1D imaging.\nChoose a rod cardiomyocyte with a clear mitochondrial pattern (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) that satisfied you by crop, acquire, and save a 2D image with 100 frames.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/176-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
