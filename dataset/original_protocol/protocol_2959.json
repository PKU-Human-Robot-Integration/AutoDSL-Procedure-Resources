    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulture plate preparation for the transfer of seedlings\nTiming: 0.5 h\nTo stress seedlings with various abiotic metals, seedlings need to be transferred from their original growing conditions to the stress conditions. These Petri dishes are prepared on the day of the experiment.\nPrepare small Petri dishes (60 × 15 mm style). Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nLabel the bottom of the Petri dish with the stress condition; also include the plating date.\nWarm-up the agar bottle, as described in step 14 (before you begin). Make sure the agar is liquid enough.\nMix 15 mL of agar and 300 μL of MES buffer in a polypropylene tube.\nIf Al stress of 5 μM is needed, then add 7.5 μL of AlCl3 in the polypropylene tube.\nIf Fe stress of 10 μM is needed, then add 15 μL of FeCl2 in the polypropylene tube.\nHomogenize the polypropylene tube and deposit the mix in the Petri dish.\nNote: Always keep the small Petri dishes in the incubator throughout the whole experiment. Seedlings are systematically transferred to a Petri dish for 2 h, even in the absence of metallic stress. Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nNanomechanical experiments\nTiming: 2 days\nNanoindentation experiments are performed with an AFM using a square-pyramidal tip. Living seedling roots are fixed on glass slides. Steps 2 to 8 describe all the procedures from cantilever attachments to force-distance curve collection. Several steps require the supervision of an AFM expert due to some fragile components of AFM (cantilevers or piezo scanners). Although the procedures are generic, details may vary from one AFM to another.\nAttach cantilever to the AFM scanner (2 min).\nUsing the binocular and dedicated tweezer , gently lift the cantilever and place it straight into the groove of the liquid cell holder. Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].",
    "Attach the liquid cell holder to the piezo scanner.\nNote: In case of the Dimension 3100, lift the piezo significantly upward (away from the sample). Make sure that the scanner is far from the sample stage so that the tip will not hit the root surface and break.\nCalibrate the AFM system (60 min).\nPerform calibration in air.\nAdjust the laser beam on the cantilever while preserving the highest sum.\nPerform a contact-based force-distance curve (ramp size of 3 μm, frequency of 0.5 Hz, 4096 points per curve).\nDetermine the deflection sensitivity by measuring the slope of the curve in contact with the surface.\nRepeat the previous step several times until sensitivity values are constant.\nPerform a thermal tuning to determine the spring constant of the cantilever.\nSave the computed spring constant and repeat the previous step until the spring constant values are uniform.\nPerform calibration in liquid.\nRepeat previous step 3.a but in liquid environment.\nNote: For the Dimension 3100, only the deflection sensitivity can be performed in liquids.\nWait for half an hour after adding the growth solution to thermally stabilize the AFM cantilever.\nSet the sensitivity values obtained in liquid as final values.\nIf the AFM system can perform thermal tuning with frequencies below 1 kHz, then also perform the thermal tune in liquid, otherwise, keep the spring constant obtained during the previous calibration in air.\nFixing a plant root on a glass slide (5 min).\nGlass slide set up (2 min for the set-up and 1.5 min for sealing).\nTake two standard glass slides plus two rectangular cover slips and assemble them as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Assembling the glass slides to mount plant seedlings for nanoindentation analysis with AFM",
    "Cover slips glued to the green Starfrost glass slides are colored in light gray. A small piece of micropore tape (dark gray) is used to fix the cover slips (for clarity on the left side is shown, but both sides should be fixed in the same way).\nTake a micropore tape and place it over the cover slip to bind to the glass slide.\nNote: Make sure that both cover slips are at the same height in the middle of the slide and that 2/3rd of the width is touching the slide and 1/3rd of it stays outside.\nTake a third glass slide and place it in the middle of the other two glass slides such that a little rectangular space is left in between (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Principle of mounting plant seedlings on glass slides\nThe goal of this setup is to deposit a uniform layer of NuSil glue on the middle glass slide. The adhesive layer shown in light gray and labeled with the number 1. A long primary root in orange and two green cotyledons schematizes the seedling. The seedling is finally covered with a growth medium shown in light transparent blue color and labeled with the number 2. Cover slips are in light gray whereas micropore tapes are in dark gray.\nAt one end of the glass slide deposit a drop of silicone adhesive (approx. 100–150 μL).\nCritical: Never store NuSil in any clear plastic container like Eppendorf or Falcon tubes. Always store it in dark glass bottle, due to the presence of ethyl acetate solvent.",
    "After depositing NuSil on the glass slide, spread it with the help of another cover slip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) dragging upwards to the other end. When we spread a drop of NuSil on the glass slide, it has the thickness of the cover slip and is evenly distributed.\nCritical: A constant thickness of glue is important for reducing the height fluctuation of deposited plant. Do not add more than two drops of NuSil. More amount will lead to longer polymerization time.\nAfter spreading NuSil, wait for 20–25 s, so that the adhesive starts polymerizing, yet it is still wet for the sealing purpose.\nNote: The goal is to place the root onto the adhesive when it is semi-solid so that it stays on the surface and does not dip into the adhesive. It might be tempting to place the plant sooner. Sometimes the plant can dip inside the NuSil and can affect its living state, in particular due the presence of un-evaporated ethyl acetate.\nTake one seedling from the Petri dish and, using a dedicated tweezer (NuSil is a glue and it is difficult to fully remove from the tweezer. Thus, a dedicated tweezer should be used to NuSil threads sealing); gently lift it from the shoot area preferably under the cotyledon without pinching the seedling.\nCritical: if not lifted properly, this might lead to breakage of the plant into two pieces. In case of longer roots, it might be stuck inside the agar gel and extra caution is required to extract the seedling from the agar. Always lift from the cotyledon part because that area has the center of mass. This way the root can balance itself during the transfer from the Petri dish to the glass slide.\nDepositing a seedling on the glass slide.",
    "Place the plant on the slide such that the root tip is placed first, followed by the shoot part.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nLay down the root straight to enable the indentation in the transition zone. In case the root is bent around the transition zone it is difficult to perform indentation around that area. Troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13].\nFastening the seedling root by sealing it with the semi-solid adhesive present on the glass slide, starting from the top, then the middle and the very end (root tip) to prevent any movement of the root (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Picture showing how the root should be laid down for AFM measurements\nThe sealing with NuSil should be very thin so that cantilever support is not touching the sealing bands. After sealing carefully, place the middle glass slide of Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] under the piezo scanner. At this point, we need to rotate the glass slide manually so that the root tip is positioned under the cantilever as seen through the camera.\nCritical: Seal only 50–100 μm of the root tip area. It preserves the transition zone from any presence of glue.\nImmediately cover entirely the plant root (at least 100 μL) with growth solution (square #2, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) to prevent drying during measurement. Make sure to cover the root tip first as it is the most sensitive part of the plant. The system is ready for measurements (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Do not use water to cover the root, as it will generate an osmotic imbalance that causes excess water to enter into the cell, which in turn either break or escape from the fastening NuSil bands.\nNano-Indentation on the living root tissues (max 25 min).",
    "Critical: Although the seedling is alive, the horizontal position is not its favorite. Consequently, the experiment should be performed as quickly as possible. A time longer than 30 min gave us unpredictable results as global stress may occur within the root.\nBefore positioning the plant root under the AFM cantilever, retract the piezo to a safe distance between the cantilever and the plant root.\nLift the scanner head carefully and insert the glass slide with the plant. Buffer is already on the top of the root, thus carefully lower the scanner head so that the cantilever will not bend upon contact with water (adding a drop of buffer on the cantilever is usually necessary to have a smooth insertion in liquid).\nOrient the glass slide, so that the root orientation is close to vertical and its tip is on the top of the camera (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nThe target working area is located approximately 500 μm away from the root tip. This distance can be estimated knowing the length of the PNP cantilever (about 200 μm). Use the stage positioning controls to move the cantilever on the right zone.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Scanning electron microscopy image of a PNP-TR cantilever used in the AFM experiment\nA secondary electron image is on the left and a backscattered electron image is on the right. Tip height and opening angle are highlighted in yellow and were measured using ImageJ: 3.05 μm in height (left) and an opening angle of 69.27°. The manufacturer’s data indicates a tip height of 3.5 μm and a half-opening angle of 35°. Image is magnified 6560× under a tension of 5 kV and a working distance of 7.8 mm.",
    "Critical: Difficulty in using PNP cantilever: because the seedling root is pseudo-cylindrical and the PNP tip height rather small (<3.5 μm), it is not advised to probe the root beyond the longitudinal median line of the root. Note that there is a small setback of the tip of PNP cantilever (4 μm), see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nFocus the camera so that the root surface is clearly visible.\nWait for a few minutes for the laser to stabilize.\nCenter laser spot at (0,0) position. Keep deflection set point to 2.5 V.\nMake a new folder for each node and mention its co-ordinate in the filename.\nLower the piezo down manually until the root is clearly visible, then start engaging.\nWhen the surface is detected, then run continuous force-distance (FD) curves to adjust the ramp parameters. With the Dimension 3100, we have to modify the z-ramp start so that our 3 μm-long ramp could be performed correctly. With our open-loop scanner, we did not use a trigger force threshold, and consequently, the ramp must be manually adjusted prior a full record.\nWith appropriate FD curves, start collecting and recording curves.\nBecause of the limited time (before plant roots display additional stress), we can only probe a limited number of areas. Our best protocol contains 16 physically different areas (called nodes) and each node is composed of a matrix of 2 × 2 FD curves, using the autoramp tool with 50 nm of distance between each point (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Pictorial version of the matrix strategy used to collect force-distance curves",
    "The measurement starts at position 0 and proceed according to blue arrows. Offsets of the piezo scanner at each node of the matrix are indicated below (values in μm). At each node, a submatrix of 2 × 2 FD curves are recorded. Do not forget to update filenames at each node in order to keep track of the matrix (it helps during the data analysis).\nWithdraw the cantilever every time after the recording of the curves and engage again after changing the piezo offset co-ordinates. Troubleshooting problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17].\nAlternatives: Modern AFM instruments use force-volume mode that allows the collection of a matrix of nodes with a single FD curve per node. The analysis of data will thus be slightly different as in our protocol (see the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section below).\nAfter completion of all 16 nodes, for the record, take a screen shot of the plant root under the cantilever.\nMove the piezo upward to a safe distance and discard the glass slide.\nRepeat from step 4 for additional seedlings.\nAt the end of the day, remove the cantilever holder by lifting the piezo scanner gently.\nOn a bench, clean the tip by pouring 100 μL of propanol over. Repeat twice.\nRemove extra propanol with the help of filter paper placed on the edge of the holder.\nAdd 100 μL ethanol for further cleaning.\nWe can keep the probe inside the holder for future experiments. Always recalibrate before experiment.\nPrepare plant roots for checking their growth status (10 min).\nWith the remaining roots, not taken for the indentation experiment, transferred them to the Petri dishes containing stressed medium or control medium, try to align them properly and mark the position of the root tip with a pen. Troubleshooting problem 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.19].",
    "Use the binoculars to mark the root end for next-day visual assessment.\nObserve phenotype (root extension) after 24 h and take a photograph.\nRoot length measurement (2 days after the initial experiment).\nMeasure the root length 48 h after the transfer to have a clear distinction in the root extension phenotype.\nAlternatives: Classically, we measure the root length contiguously to AFM measurements. It is also possible to dedicate a specific experiment (excluding AFM) purely for root length measurements.\nTake pictures of the whole roots under stressed and non-stressed conditions. Do not forget to add a ruler in the field of view to calibrate the length measurement with ImageJ.\nExport these pictures to imageJ where they can be opened with the NeuronJ plugin. The NeuronJ plugin allows you to trace the root paths with the computer mouse. The default standard length unit is in pixels.\nNote: NeuronJ requires an 8-bit gray scale image in a GIF format, so use ImageJ to transform your picture prior to opening it with NeuronJ.\nIf NeuronJ is not installed yet, please follow the steps e-f first, otherwise jump to step g.\nInstall NeuronJ from https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/[href=https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/]. Download both jar files: NeuronJ_.jar[href=https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/NeuronJ_.jar] (version 1.4.3) and imagescience.jar[href=https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar] (version 3.0.0).\nMove the two .jar files into the plugins directory of ImageJ software installed on your computer (see the installation manual of ImageJ for your specific computer system).\nOpen a gif image of your plant root.\nAdd a tracing by selecting the leftmost menu of NeuronJ in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. First, click at one end of a root and wait a few seconds until the plugin sets up (do not click again).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Partial menu of the NeuronJ plugin",
    "Click on the icon to add (1st left) or to remove (2nd left) a tracing. To remove a tracing, it must be finalized, i.e., ended by a double click. To measure tracing data click on the last-right icon.\nAfter 2–3 s, move the mouse following the root shape and the plugin should automatically track the root feature.\nNote: Sometimes the plugin loses track of the root, then just click on the last pixel of the root where the tracking was lost. It concatenates a new tracking segment from that click and proceeds like before. You can click as many times as needed to follow perfectly the root.\nWhen you reach the end of the root, then double-click to exit the tracking.\nClick on the measure-tracing icon to display the results (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nNote: You can perform the entire tracing of all roots first and, only at the end, select the measurement. Then, you can export all the data using the plugin menu. It provides the global average length of all roots and displays their individual values. It is then possible to save this data as text files.\nSave the results of NeuronJ in text file or spread sheet format. Also, save the labeled path in PNG format, for the record.\nReopen ImageJ with the original image that contains the ruler and calibrate (set scale) the pixel length of your image.

    "The reproducibility of the experimental protocol is of prime interest. In particular, measurements of stress and non-stress plant roots must be performed in the same manner because there is a link between the elastic constant and the experimental indentation depth. Therefore, we tried to keep everything as constant as possible to perform our nanoindentation experiments. In our protocol, we used the contact-based mechanical model of Sneddon7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and a novel extension known as the trimechanic theory8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] to determine the elastic property of the external cell wall. This model allows us to extract the effective Young’s modulus by fitting the force-indentation curve, after correcting the FD curve.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] The relationship between the force (F) and the indentation (Z) is described by:\nF\n=\nÊ\ntan\nα\n2\nZ\n2\nwhere Ê is the effective Young’s modulus (   E ˆ  =  E /  (  1 −  η 2   )    ) and E the Young’s modulus with η the Poisson’s ratio, and α the half-opening angle of the squared pyramidal tip (35° for PNP tips). Sample FD curves of stressed and non-stressed plant roots are shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]. The trimechanic theory is used to fit the indentation curves in multiple depth zones and to extract the effective Young’s modulus as well as the corresponding stiffness.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Sample of force-distance curves and their fitting using AtomicJ software\nApproach curves are in gray with a plain line for the stress condition (10 μM FeCl2 + 10 μM AlCl3) and with a dashed line for the control condition (no metals). The fitting was capped to 5 nN and is highlighted by a red line. From the stress-condition fit (plain line), the Young’s modulus value is 506 kPa whereas it is 60 kPa for the control condition (dashed lines).",
    "Alternatives: AtomicJ, an open source package,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] was also used in our study, and several methods can also be used to obtain the Young’s modulus values e.g., manufacturer software (Bruker, JPK, …).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] A graphical interface for calculating the Young’s modulus is available with the Force V1.1.0 program.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Details of the computation steps of FD curve analysis are described by Domke & Radmacher.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] It is possible to linearize the force-indentation curve and then fitting with a simple linear regression9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; this process can be obtained with basic programing skills in Matlab (or equivalent) or simply with Excel spreadsheets. A recent review on determining elastic properties of biological object has been recently released.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] One of the main differences between all these alternative fitting methods is the strategy to obtain the contact point, which influence greatly the numerical values of E. Nevertheless, when comparing measurements between control and a stress condition, it is reasonable to choose any model, on the condition of always using it the same way for all FD curves.\nFiltering and collecting fitting data from FD curves are described in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section. In the end, our protocol provides a single average value (Elasticity, Stiffness, Depth, …) per plant as provided by the trimechanic theory.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] The protocol is applied with the same experimental conditions on three or four plants per day, usually four times, providing a total of about 10–15 plants per condition. Once all the experimental conditions are tested, a boxplot is produced and statistical tests can be applied. A sample of a box-and-whiskers plot drawn with Prism v5 is shown in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2702-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Box-and-whiskers plot of elastic properties of WT seedling roots in absence or presence of aluminum stress",
    "Elasticity is represented by the effective Young’s modulus (Ê) in kPa units. Fe0Al0 indicates the nutrient solution without Fe and without Al. Fe0Al5 indicates the nutrient solution without Fe and with 5 μM of Al. Each box edge represents the first and third quartiles around the median. The whiskers represent the min and max values for each group. The label inserted within a box indicates the total number of measured plants. Exact p-values are obtained according to the Mann-Whitney non-parametric t-test. Results indicate that there are no significant differences in the elasticity of seedling roots grown in absence or in presence of 5 or 10 μM Al."
