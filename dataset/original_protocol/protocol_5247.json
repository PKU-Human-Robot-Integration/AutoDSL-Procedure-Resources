    "SetupConnect the micropipette holder to the positive and the reference electrode to the negative output of the microiontophoresis current generator. The microelectrode holder is mounted to the micromanipulator (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530225636_5270.jpgFigure 1. Experimental setup. We use a Zeiss IM35 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with heating stage (set to 37 °C), HBO fluorescence lamp (100 W) and appropriate filter set to detect Rhodamine B fluorescence. The microscope is placed on an anti-vibration table. The microelectrode holder is mounted to the micromanipulator and connected to the positive output of the microiontophoresis current generator. The reference electrode is connected to the negative output of the current generator (reference electrode and current generator are not shown on this photograph). 1: heating stage, 2: rod with connection for micropipette holder, 3: positive wire (iontophoresis current generator -> micropipette) 4: micromanipulator (moving in x-, y- and z-axis), 5: controller (micromanipulator), 6: temperature controller (heating stage), 7: power supply (fluorescence lamp), 8: power supply (micromanipulator), 9: power supply (microscope lamp), 10: anti-vibration microscope desk.Neurobiotin tracer microinjectionCulture the cells on 6 cm cell culture dishes until they reach the desired confluency e.g., for HeLa cells we use 70-80% confluency.Note: Neurobiotin microinjection can be performed with any adherent cell line or primary cell culture to determine the extent of gap junctional intercellular communication.One hour prior to injection: Remove cell culture medium and wash the cells with PBS in order to remove cell debris. Aspirate the PBS and add 2 ml of fresh cell culture medium. Put the cells back into the incubator.Use the micropipette puller to manufacture injection capillaries with a tip size of 1-2 µm from GB 100-F8P borosilicate glass capillaries. Load the capillaries with Neurobiotin/Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran solution by bringing the backside of the micropipette in contact with the solution.",
    "The capillarity of the pipette will draw the fluid to the tip (Figure 2A).Fill the capillary with LiCl solution with a syringe by inserting a spinal needle into the backside of the capillary while withdrawing the needle as the micropipette fills. Avoid any air bubbles (Figure 2B). Little air bubbles can be removed by holding the micropipette tip down and gently flicking the pipette with the finger.Fill the micropipette holder with LiCl solution using syringe and needle. Avoid any air bubbles (Figure 2C).Carefully place the pipette into the micropipette holder. Avoid any air bubbles (Figure 2D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170530/20170530225843_9522.jpgFigure 2. Loading the micropipette. A. Place the micropipette tip up into a 500 µl reaction tube containing 20 µl Neurobiotin/Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran solution. The capillarity of the pipette will draw the fluid to the tip. B. Fill the capillary with LiCl solution with a syringe by inserting a spinal needle into the backside of the capillary; C. Fill the micropipette holder with LiCl solution; D. Place the pipette into the micropipette holder. Avoid any air bubbles during all steps. Parts of this schematic were adapted from Servier Medical Art.Put the 6 cm culture dish containing the cells under the microscope (heated stage set to 37 °C) and place the reference electrode into the culture medium. Set up a negative retaining current to prevent tracer leakage from the micropipette.Note: Before starting microinjection, use a marker to draw a line at the bottom of the culture dish and place injections along this line. This facilitates going back to the injected cell under the microscope after staining.While looking at the cells through the microscope at 10x magnification, use the micromanipulator to carefully position the tip of the micropipette next to the cell you want to inject. Penetrate the cell with the pipette.",
    "Be careful not to break the pipette tip at the bottom of the culture dish. This procedure needs some practice.Switch from brightfield to fluorescence microscopy. The pipette tip should get visible due to red Rhodamin B fluorescence (E: 590 nm). Note: We recommend to work in a darkened room and keep main lights switched off during the experiment. This facilitates switching between brightfield and fluorescence microscopy.Inject the tracer solution by applying a positive current of 20 nA for 10-15 sec. The injected cell should fill with the red fluorescent dye. The dye should not spread into neighboring cells as Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran is too big to pass gap junction channels (Figure 3A, Inset).Carefully retract the pipette tip from the cell.Repeat the procedure to inject 10-15 cells per 6 cm dish within max. 15 min.Neurobiotin tracer visualisationWash the injected cells twice with PBS directly after the last injection.Fix the cells with glutaraldehyde solution for 5 min at room temperature.Wash three times with PBS.Permeabilize cells overnight at 4 °C using Triton X-100 solution.Wash cells three times with PBS.Incubate cells for 90 min at room temperature with Avidin D coupled horseradish peroxidase solution.Wash three times with PBS.Use the HistoGreen HRP-substrate Kit to indirectly visualize Neurobiotin. The use of HistoGreen-substrate will label cells which received the Neurobiotin tracer in blue (green) color (Figures 3A-3C). Notes:  Alternatively to the HistoGreen HRP-substrate kit, 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining can be used for visualization.Monitor the staining reaction by looking at the cells under the microscope to avoid overstaining. If the staining reaction should get too intense even after short incubation times, dilute the Avidin D coupled horse radish peroxidase solution (Recipe 6) or reduce the amount of injected Neurobiotin by shortening the injection time (step B11).",
    "The number of coupled cells can be determined by manual counting of labeled cells."
