    "1. Construction of Membrane with Well Walls for Retention of Cell Culture Media (see Figure 1D for the final product)\nUsing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets coated with Collagen I, cut the outline of the flexible membrane with a scalpel or a die.\nPlace each membrane in a 60 mm Petri dish for storage.\nCreation of walls:\n\t\nMix PDMS at a 10:1 weight ratio of elastomer A to elastomer B (curing agent).\nPour 5 ml of fully mixed PDMS into 50 ml tubes.\nPlace 50 ml tubes with uncured PDMS horizontally in a hybridization oven.\nUse the rotor function to coat the inner walls of the tubes at 8 rpm during the curing time. At RT, the PDMS will be fully cured in 2 days.\nRemove the PDMS from the tube in a sterile cell culture hood.\nUsing a new razor blade, partition the cylinder of PDMS into sections 4 mm in height.\nPlace the sections, which will serve as the membrane walls, into a Petri dish container without allowing the walls to become creased.\nSelect and center one wall of PDMS on one membrane while maintaining the two in the Petri dish.\nGently place uncured PDMS (10:1 ratio) on the outside perimeter of the wall to be used as glue. Prevent formation of gaps between the wall and the membrane since it is there to retain liquid.\nPlace each Petri dish containing the completed membrane and covered in an oven at 70 °C for 24 hr to cure.\n2. Correlation of Motor Rotations with Clamp Displacement or Radial Growth for Calibration (Figure 2)\nStart the software controlling the motor.\nDisplace the clamps of the device using the manual setting in the motor software.",
    "Measure the distance and record the motor count position between opposing clamps at both minimum and maximum displacement of the clamps.\nCalculate the percent change in the distance between the clamps as a function of the motor count (~0-75k counts). This will indicate the maximum potential strain achieved on the membrane.\n3. Application of Stretch on Mouse Lung Epithelial Cell Line (MLE12)\nSeed MLE12 cells at 2.5 million cells on the flexible membrane (Step 1) per well to be confluent within two days. The seeding density may vary for different cell types.\nMake sure the mechanical actuator is in a fully relaxed position.\n\t\nRemove cell culture media.\nUsing 1.5 mm biopsy punches, punch two holes in each of the six clamp (see Figure 1D) tabs of the membrane. The radial placement of the holes determines the amount of pre-tension the membrane experiences initially. Punch the holes at a radius of 20.5 mm on the membrane tabs if no pre-tension is desired.\nPosition the membrane on the stretcher with the punched holes lining up with the pins within the clamps. Place top clamps in place. Tighten the screws one at a time alternating sides.\nAdd 1 ml cell culture media.\nPlace the device on the microscope stage centering the middle of the membrane with the light path.\nUse tape or magnets (if possible) to fix the device to the stage. Once fixed, control the in-plane (parallel to the membrane) and vertical (z-direction) of the mechanical device with the stage controller of the microscope.\nApply stretch with the software provided by the manufacturer by manually controlling the position and speed of motor rotation20.\n4. Measurement of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)",
    "Once cells are confluent, add 1-2 ml of RT DMEM with mitochondrial superoxide indicator (5 µM final concentration) directly on the cells.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nWash cells gently three times with buffer warmed in a water bath to 37 °C.\nImmediately place the flexible membrane on the stretcher (Step 2.2) already in place under an upright confocal microscope.\nAdd 1 ml of DMEM with phenol-red free medium and 25 mM of HEPES.\nSet excitation/emission filters to 510/580 nm.\nImage multiple fields every 15 min to create the desired time course of mitochondrial superoxide production.\nFrom captured images, record fluorescence intensity histograms at each time interval using software capable of quantifying fluorescence intensity.\n5. Application of Stretch and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\nNOTE: These steps are provided for a specific AFM and optical microscope combination (Figure 4 and Materials List).\nPrepare the AFM for the experiment.\n\t\nIncrease the height of the AFM head to its maximum position in the z-direction.\nPut extenders on the legs of the AFM to lift the plane at which AFM cantilever contacts the sample. The specimen and the AFM head needs to be lifted to accommodate the height of the mechanical device.\nPrepare the optical microscope (if available).\n\t\nRemove the AFM scanner plate. Remove the desired objective.\nAdd a spacer to the objective. The height of the spacer would depend on the objective and the specific AFM set-up, but it is necessary if optical imaging is desired since observation plane will be shift in the z-direction by an amount equal to the stretcher and adapter height (Figure 5A). Note that the AFM usually provides low magnification imaging from an optical path above the device.\nMount the desired objective back in its location. Place the scanner back on to the AFM.",
    "Start the AFM software. Start all necessary light sources including the light source for fluorescence measurements.\nMount a chip with a cantilever beam that is appropriate for the desired measurements. 200 pN/nm or less stiffness is preferred when measuring the elastic modulus of live cells.\nAlign the laser and calibrate the cantilever stiffness according to manufacturer’s suggestions on a glass coverslip mounted on the device.\nPrepare a membrane as in Step 1, but with the following modifications.\n\t\nImmediately before mounting the membrane on to the stretching device, cut the walls to about 1 mm in height. This prevents the interference experienced between the membrane walls and the load cell.\nMount the membrane on the mechanical device as described 3.2.1-3.2.3.\nRemove cell culture media to prevent damage to the AFM scanner in case of a spill.\nCouple the device with an adapter (Figure 5A). Place the mechanical device with the adapter on the scanner.\nStretch the membrane to the desired tensile strain level.\nNano-indentation of stretched cells.\n\t\nAdd a limited (<0.5 ml) volume of media on the cells to avoid AFM scanner or microscope damage due to a spill.\nEngage the cantilever beam with the membrane.\nFollow the protocol of the particular AFM device to scan areas of interest. \nSubscription Required.
