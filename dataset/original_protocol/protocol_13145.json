    "1. Physical and chemical properties of Art v 1 protein\nInput AF493943.1 in the GeneBank (Table of Materials) to obtain the amino acid sequence of Art v 1 protein (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S1).\n\tNOTE: The Art v 1 protein contains 132 amino acids, which are coded by 624 bp of gene sequences. Its amino acid sequence (AAO24900.1) is MAKCSYVFCAVLLIFIVAIGEMEAAGSKLCEKTSKTYSG\n\tKCDNKKCDKKCIEWEKAQHGACHKREAGKESCFCYF\n\tDCSKSPPGATPAPPGAAPPPAAGGSPSPPADGGSPP\n\tPPADGGSPPVDGGSPPPPSTH.\nLaunch the Expasy ProtParam Tool (Table of Materials), inputting the Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence mentioned in step 1.1. Click on the Compute parameters button to display amino acid composition, atomic number, molecular formula, relative molecular weight, positive and negative charge, isoelectric point, and instability index (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S2).\n\tNOTE: The instability index is <40 indicating the protein is stable; a value > 40 means the protein is unstable9.\n2. Prediction of transmembrane region and signal peptide of Art v 1 protein\nInput the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence in the online software TMHMM Server v.2.0 (Table of Materials). Choose Extensive, with graphics as Output format, click on Submit to display membrane structure, and obtain the physical and chemical characteristics of transmembrane protein (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S3).\nInput the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence in the SignaIP5.0 Server online tool (Table of Materials). Choose Eukarya as the Organism group and Long output as the Output format, then, click on Submit and fill in the e-mail address to receive the result of the predicted protein signal peptide (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S4).\n3. Secondary structure prediction of Art v 1 protein",
    "To analyze the hydrophilicity, surface accessibility, flexibility, and antigen index of the Art v 1 protein, input AF493943.1 in GeneBank (Table of Materials), and click on protein id AAO24900.1 | FASTA. Copy the FASTA sequence to the new text file, and modify the file type as FASTA (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure 5). Then, launch the software DNAstar protean module and open the FASTA file to display the secondary structure of Art v 1 protein (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S6).\n4. Tertiary structure prediction and conformation evaluation of Art v 1 protein\nTo predict the tertiary structure model of Art v 1 protein, input the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence in the Swiss-Model online software (Table of Materials), click on Search For Templates, select the highest similar protein 2kpy.1.A as template, click on Build Models | Model 01, and download the PDB format file (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S7).\nTo evaluate the homologous modeling conformation displayed in step 4.1, open the UCLA-DOE LAB SAVES v6.0 online software (Table of Materials), and click on Select file to upload the PDB format file in step 4.1 | Run programs | Procheck | Result | Ramachandran plot (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S8).\n5. Prediction of B cell epitopes of Art v 1 protein\nTo predict the B cell epitope of Art v 1 protein, open the website of IEDB Analysis Resource online tool (Table of Materials), click on Antigen Sequence Properties, input the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence, and choose the method Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0, and finally click on Submit (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S9).",
    "Open the website of the ABCpred online tool (Table of Materials), input the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence, 0.51 as the threshold, and 16 as the window length to use for prediction, select ON for the overlapping filter, and click on Submit sequence (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S10).\n6. Prediction of Th cell epitopes of Art v 1 protein\nTo predict the Th cell epitope of Art v 1 protein, open the website of the IEDB Analysis Resource online tool (Table of Materials), click on MHC II Binding, and input the above mentioned Art v 1 protein amino acid sequence. Choose NetMHCllpan 4.1 EL (recommended epitope predictor-2023.09) as the predict method, Human as the species/locus, DRB1*01:01 as HLA-DR, allele, 15 as the length, sort the peptides by Percentile Rank, and click on Submit (Supplemental File 1-Supplemental Figure S11).\nSubscription Required.
