    "This protocol will allow the researcher to map and identify the region responsible for a maize mutant phenotype using BSA and high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA. For this, a segregating mutant population must first be developed (Strategic Planning). Then, mutant tissue is pooled, and is then DNA-extracted and sequenced using a short-read sequencer. Collecting young leaf tissue that is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen is the best way to obtain the mutant tissue. We then describe how to use publicly available bioinformatic tools to align the short-read sequences to a reference genome to obtain files containing SNP positions in the mutant sequences. These files are then filtered to identify the map position of the causative mutation using a 100-SNP sliding window. If EMS mutagenesis was used to create the mutant phenotype, further downstream analysis of SNPs for G:C to A:T transitions will help identify a set of candidate genes within the map window. As an example for the protocol, we show the mapping and identification of the causative mutation responsible for the ba1-GN135 mutant allele that has a barren stalk phenotype (i.e., no ear branches on the stalk) and a weak reduction in tassel branching. This mutant was identified in A619 and backcrossed to B73 for four generations.\nMaterials\nMaize inbred line that was used to create reference genome (obtained from https://www.ars-grin.gov[href=https://www.ars-grin.gov])\nFrozen pooled maize mutant tissue from F2 or F3 population (see Strategic Planning)\nLiquid nitrogen\nUrea extraction buffer (see recipe)\n25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, 77617)\nIsopropanol\nAmmonium acetate (see recipe)\n70% (v/v) ethanol in water\nTE buffer, pH 8.0 (see recipe)\nQubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32850)\nTru-Seq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina, 20015962)\nLeaf punch\n50-ml conical tubes\nMortar and pestle\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nVortex\nBenchtop centrifuge\nNanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13-400-519)",

Other approaches using commercial kits or home-made solutions may also be used.\n1. Collect a single leaf punch from each F2 mutant into a 50-ml conical tube and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nAlternative methods of tissue collection can also be used, such as physically tearing leaf sections or cutting leaf sections with a scissor. If the mutant phenotype is in a tissue that makes collecting leaf tissue difficult, an alternative tissue sample can be used. Make sure the amount of tissue is relatively equal from each individual mutant sample before pooling. Collecting younger plant tissue will allow for better DNA extractions due to lower amounts of phenolics, starch, or other secondary metabolites that can contaminate the sample.\n2. Homogenize all mutant leaf tissue into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen.\nDo not let the plant sample thaw and make sure plant samples are well mixed.\n3. Add ∼100 mg of homogenized plant tissue to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube along with 0.6 ml of urea extraction buffer. Vortex well for 30 s.\nThe sample can be weighed on a fine balance, or alternatively100 µl of homogenized plant tissue can be used.\nThe tissue should be allowed to thaw only in the presence of the urea extraction buffer.\nExcess liquid nitrogen in the sample can cause the buffer to freeze or the tube to explode, leading to loss of your sample. Be sure that the sample has completely stopped bubbling before adding urea extraction buffer.",
    "4. Add 0.5 ml of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to the tube and vortex for 15 min.\n5. Centrifuge the sample to a benchtop centrifuge for 30 min at 18,000 × g, room temperature.\n6. Carefully transfer the supernatant (upper layer) to a new 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Be sure not to include any of the lower phase, as this can lower DNA quality.\n7. Slowly add 0.6 ml of isopropanol and 60 µl of ammonium acetate. Mix gently by slowing inverting the tube back and forth.\nThis will precipitate the DNA out of solution. and white strands of DNA will be visible in the liquid.\n8. Spool DNA with clean pipette tip and add to new 2-ml centrifuge tube with 1 ml of 70% (v/v) ethanol.\nIf DNA is not visible in solution, then the sample can be centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g, room temperature, to pellet DNA. Supernatant can be poured off and 1 ml of 70% v/v ethanol can be added to the pellet.\n9. Centrifuge tube for 10 min at 18,000 × g, room temperature, to pellet DNA.\n10. Let pellet air dry to remove remaining ethanol, but do not completely dry pellet.\nPellet will dry within a few minutes. Continually check tube every 30 s for the edges of the pellet to become translucent.\n11. Resuspend in 50 µl of TE buffer.\n12. Check quality (i.e., A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratio) of DNA on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and quantity of DNA on Qubit fluorometer using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit with manufacturer's recommended protocol.",
    "Checking the quality of the DNA is important to identify potential contaminants. The Nanodrop will give the quantity of DNA (ng/µl), the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm divided by the absorbance at 280 nm (A260/A280), and the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm divided by the absorbance at 230 nm (A260/A230). The A260/A280 value should be around 1.8 to 2.0 for good-quality DNA. A reduction in this ratio likely indicates protein contamination. The A260/A230 value should be around 2.3 to 2.5 for good-quality DNA. A reduction in this ratio can be the result of a contaminant such as phenol or salt. If your DNA does not have these expected ratios, then the DNA-extraction steps should be repeated. The Nanodrop is not accurate in quantifying DNA, as it routinely overestimates the amount (Simbolo et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.591#cpz1591-bib-0044]); thus the Qubit is used for quantification of the DNA.\nAn aliquot of 4 µl can also be run on a 1% agarose gel to check quality. Smearing on the gel indicates degraded DNA.\nAt least 2 µg of genomic DNA is adequate to move on to next step. If not enough genomic DNA is acquired, repeat the extraction steps.\n13. Create sequencing library using Tru-Seq DNA PCR-free kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Then, sequence library on short-read sequencer as 150-bp paired-end reads.\nA minimum total of 40 gigabases should be sequenced, resulting in a target sequencing depth of 15× genome coverage.\nShorter or longer reads can be made depending on the sequencing machine used. Be sure to check manufacturer's protocol for different-size sequence reads.\nSingle-end reads can also be created, but this will negatively affect downstream sequence alignment, especially in repetitive sequences. Many companies or sequencing cores can do library preparation and sequencing.\nAlign and investigate sequenced reads",

Create a bwa alignment index of the most current reference genome of your selected inbred line using bwa with the following command:\n         \nbwa index -a bwtsw\n<reference_genome.fa>\nThis will create files in the same directory with the same name as the reference file with .amb, .ann, .bwt, .pac, and .sa extensions.\n16. Create a samtools index of the most current reference genome of your selected inbred line using samtools with the following command:\n         \nsamtools faidx\n<reference_genome.fa>\nThis will create a file in the same directory with the same name as the reference file but with a .fai extension.\n17. Trim adapters off reads and filter for paired reads only using the Trimmomatic software package:\n         \njava -jar trimmomatic-0.39.jar PE -<phred_quality_score> <forward_read.fastq> <reverse_read.fastq> <forward_read_pairtrim.fastq> <forward_read_unpairtrim.fastq> <reverse_read_pairtrim.fastq> <reverse_read_unpairtrim.fastq> ILLUMINACLIP:<adapter_sequences.fa>:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36",
    "Select the correct quality score: phred+33 or phred+64. This depends on the Illumina pipeline used. All Illumina pipelines 1.8 and later are phred+33, whereas earlier Illumina pipelines use a variation of phred+64. Select the correct adapter sequences from library preparation. Trimmomatic has a number of adapter sequences available. If the Tru-Seq DNA PCR-free kit was used with paired-end sequencing, then use the TruSeq3-PE.fa.\n18. Align sequenced reads to the most current reference genome. Multiple threads can be used to increase alignment time. Using the following commands to output a SAM file:\n         \nbwa aln -t <number of threads> -n 0.04 <reference_genome.fa> <forward_read_pairtrim.fastq> > <output forward_read.sai>\nbwa aln -t <number of threads> -n 0.04 <reference_genome.fa> <reverse_read_pairtrim.fastq> > <output reverse_read.sai>\nbwa sampe -P <reference_genome.fa> <forward_read.sai> <reverse_read.sai> <forward_read.fastq> <reverse_read.fastq> > <output aligned_reads.sam>\nAlignment of the sequenced reads by BWA will output a Sequence Alignment/Map format (SAM) file. This is a tab-delimited file that has a header section and an alignment section.\n19. Convert SAM file to BAM file:\n         \nsamtools view -bS <aligned_reads.sam> > <aligned_reads.bam>\nThe SAM file is then converted into a BAM file, a binary version of the SAM file. Both files should be large in size depending on sequencing depth, with the SAM file being larger than the BAM file.\n20. Sort the BAM file:\n         \nsamtools sort -T <align_reads.sorted> -o <aligned_reads.sorted.bam> <aligned_reads.bam>\nThe -T command will create temporary files that will then be merged into a single BAM file to minimize computing memory requirements.\n21. Calculate genome coverage for aligned reads using the following command:\n         \nsamtools view -u -q 20 <aligned_reads.sorted.bam> | genomeCoverageBed -ibam stdin -g <reference_genome.fa.fai > <coverage.genome.q20.cov>\nfor gcov in <coverage.genome.q20.cov>\ndo\necho $gcov\ngrep \"^genome\" $gcov > z.txt\nawk 'BEGIN{total=0} {total += ($2*$3)} END{total=total/$4;print \"\\nAverage\nCoverage: \"total}' < z.txt >> $gcov\ndone\nrm -f z.txt",
    "The calculated genome coverage will be on the last line of the coverage.genome.q20.cov file written as: Average Coverage: ##.####. The genome coverage can be used to make predictions about false positives at the end of the analysis, as the total read counts at a given location should be relatively close to the genome coverage value.\n22. Create BED file from the GFF3 file that contains all CDS locations in the genome using the perl file reference_genome_CDS.pl.\nCreation of the BED file will output a tab-delimited file that has the chromosome number in column 1, start position of CDS in column 2, and end position of CDS in column 3.\nThe file directories will need to be changed to the proper directory in the perl file.\nThis BED file will have to be created for newer versions of the reference genome.\n23. Create pileup file for all CDS positions using the samtools function mpileup with a read quality score greater than 20 and position score greater than 20. This will create an output .bcf file:\n         \nsamtools mpileup -l $BED -Q20 -q20 -t AD -t ADF -t ADR -t DP -t SP -uf <reference_genome.fa> <aligned_reads.sorted.bam> | bcftools view > <CDS_pileup.bcf>\nThe read quality score filters are used to eliminate sequencing and alignment errors.\n24. Convert .bcf file to .vcf file using bcftools:\n         \nbcftools view <CDS_pileup.bcf> > <CDS_pileup.vcf>\n25. Filter .vcf variant file so that only the positions of SNPs are included using bcftools:\n         \nbcftools view -c -V indels -v <CDS_pileup.vcf> > <CDS_pileup_variant_noindels.vcf>\n26. Create separate .tsv files for each chromosome using the perl file allelefrequency.pl.",
    "This will output a file for each of the ten maize chromosomes, with chromosome number in column 1, physical position of the SNP in column 2, and the allele frequency (variant number of reads divided by the total number of reads) in column 3.\n27. To calculate the allele frequency in a 100-SNP sliding window, open each chromosome .tsv file in Microsoft Excel. Average the values in cells C1:C100 and then C2:C101, etc., in column 4 to calculate the average allele frequency of 100 SNPs using the “AVERAGE” command in Microsoft Excel. The sliding window is created by moving one SNP at a time across the chromosome.\n28. Plot column 2 (SNP positions) on the x-axis and column 4 (100-SNP sliding window) on the y-axis to map the location of the causative mutation.\nRepresentative plots for each chromosome of the maize mutant ba1-GN135 are shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.591#cpz1591-fig-0002]. The highest peak (nearest to one) is the map location of the causative mutation (indicated by red line in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.591#cpz1591-fig-0002]). The highest peak indicates the genomic region that is not from B73. The mutant was identified in a different genetic background; therefore this region contains the causative mutation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6862a585-1787-4b2f-9c80-a656d8cb7574/cpz1591-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Allele frequency plots of SNPs in 100-SNP sliding window for each of the 10 maize chromosomes of barren stalk1-GN135 (ba1-GN135). We have used the protocol described above to map the mutation responsible for a barren stalk phenotype in the B73 strain backcrossed to A619 four times, then selfed. This sequenced sample included 40 individual ba1-GN135 mutants. The allele frequency is plotted at each SNP location in 100-SNP sliding window between B73 reference genome (value of “0” on y-axis) and the sequenced mutant reads (value of “1” on y-axis). The candidate ba1 locus is in the middle of the map window on chromosome 3 (highest peak on any of the 10 chromosomes) designated by a red line.\n29. To identify candidate mutations within the identified map window, re-run the samtools function mpileup without the CDS .bed file with the following command:\n         \nsamtools mpileup -Q20 -q20 -t AD -t ADF -t ADR -t DP -t SP -uf <reference_genome.fa> <aligned_reads.sorted.bam> | bcftools view > <ALL_pileup.bcf>\nThis step will identify all variants in the sequenced sample compared to the reference genome. The putative causative mutation for the mutant phenotype will be in this file.\n30. Convert .bcf file to .vcf file using bcftools:\n         \nbcftools view <ALL_pileup.bcf> > <ALL_pileup.vcf>\n31. Filter .vcf variant file so that only the position of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) are included using bcftools:\n         \nbcftools view -c -v <ALL_pileup.vcf> > <ALL_pileup_variants.vcf>\n32. Filter the .vcf variant file for SNP/indel strand bias (having reads on both strands) using the snpEff tool SnpSift.jar:\n         \ncat <ALL_pileup_variants.vcf> | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(DP4[2]>0)& (DP4[3]>0)\" > <ALL_pileup_variants_strandbias.vcf>\nThis is an important step to filter out false positives, as a subset of sequencing errors will occur on only one strand.",
    "33. Filter the .vcf variant strand bias file for only homozygous non-reference mutations using the snpEff tool SnpSift.jar:\n         \ncat <ALL_pileup_variants_strandbias.vcf> | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(DP4[0]=0)& (DP4[1]=0)\" > <ALL_pileup_variants_strandbias_homozygous.vcf>\n34. Annotate the final .vcf file for predicted functional effects on gene coding sequence using the snpEff.jar program as part of the SnpEff software:\n         \njava -jar snpEff.jar eff -ud 0 -c snpEff.config <Zea_mays> <ALL_pileup_variants_strandbias_homozygous.vcf> > <ALL_pileup_variants_strandbias_homozygous_snpEff.vcf>\nBe sure to check that the current version of the maize genome database is loaded in snpEff.\nLook for HIGH effect mutations within the previously identified map window by filtering column 8 in Excel to only contain “HIGH” text.\nIf the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) was used to create the mutant, then the list can be further filtered within Microsoft Excel to only have G to A or C to T transitions.\n35. Investigate each candidate variant for effect on coding sequence. Interpret the candidate variants in terms of the biological question, e.g., that the candidate gene should function in a pathway responsible for the mutant phenotype.\nDevelopment of a second allele of the mutant will ease this process, as it can be used to verify the causative locus. Reverse genetic approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9, UniformMu mutant population, or BonnMu mutant population can be utilized to identify additional alleles.\nIf no candidate mutations are identified in the map window, then the previous filter (step 33) can be relaxed to allow reference reads (i.e., (DP4[0]<2)&(DP4[1]<2):\n         \ncat <ALL_pileup_variant_noindels_strandbias.vcf> | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(DP4[0]<2)& (DP4[1]<2)\" > <ALL_pileup_variant_noindels_strandbias.vcf>\nThis is most likely caused by contamination from including a wild-type plant in the mutant pool, operator error by mixing up samples, or sequencing errors by the sequencing machine."
