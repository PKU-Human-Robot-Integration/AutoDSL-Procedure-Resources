    "The animal part of this study was conducted at the Metabolic Research Unit of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, with all animal experimental procedures approved (Protocol # AUP00000131) by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals cared for according to the Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines (1993).\n1. Embryo Production, Isolation of Total RNA and DNase Treatment\nFor animal experimental protocols and embryo collection refer in our previous publications17, 18.\nPool and snap freeze similar stage embryos from each cow in liquid nitrogen and then keep at -80 °C until RNA extraction.\nExtract total RNA via a column-based RNA extraction kit which enables to extract RNA from pico-scale samples (kit information is available in Material List).\n\tNOTE: Recommended kit contains: Conditioning Buffer, Extraction Buffer, 70% Ethanol, Wash Buffer 1, Wash Buffer 2, Elution Buffer, RNA purification columns with collection tubes and microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 10 µL Extraction Buffer to tube containing embryos and incubate for 30 min at 42 °C. Centrifuge tube at 800 x g for 2 min to collect cell extract into the microcentrifuge tube.\nPipette 250 µL Conditioning Buffer onto the purification column filter membrane. Incubate the RNA purification column with Conditioning Buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the purification column in the collection tube at 16,000 x g for 1 min.\nPipette 10 µL of 70% Ethanol into the mixture of RNA Extraction Buffer and embryos. Mix well by pipetting up and down. Pipette mixture into the preconditioned purification column.\nTo bind RNA, centrifuge the purification column for 2 min at 100 x g and immediately follow by a centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 30 s to remove flow through.",
    "Pipette 100 µL of Wash Buffer 1 into the purification column and centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 x g.\n\tNOTE: DNase treatment is recommended if performing reverse transcription or amplification after RNA isolation.\nDigest genomic DNA right after step 1.8.\n\tNOTE: Recommended DNase kit is available in Material List. Recommended kit contains: DNase I stock solution and Buffer.\nPrepare DNase incubation mixture by mixing 5 µL DNase I stock solution with 35 µL Buffer. Mix by gently inverting.\nPipette the 40 µL DNase incubation mixture directly into the purification column membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nPipette 40 µL Wash Buffer 1 into the purification column membrane and then centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 s.\nPipette 100 µL Wash Buffer 2 into the purification column and centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 x g.\nPipette another 100 µL Wash Buffer 2 into the purification column and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16,000 x g.\nTransfer the purification column to a new 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Pipette 11 µL of Elution Buffer directly onto the membrane of the purification column. To ensure maximum absorption of Elution Buffer into the membrane, gently touch the tip of the pipette to the surface of the membrane while dispensing the elution buffer.\nIncubate the column for 1 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the column for 1 min at 1,000 x g to distribute Elution Buffer in the column, and then spin for 1 min at 16,000 x g to elute RNA.\nUse bioanalyzer instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions to evaluate the RNA quality and quantity19.\nStore the RNA sample at -80 °C until use.\n2. RNA Amplification and Labeling for Microarray Analysis",
    "NOTE: For the first time user working with RNA amplification and labeling procedures, use five ng of spike-in RNA along with the actual aRNA samples to monitor the quality control measurement of the RNA amplification and hybridization. The spike-in RNA mix contains ten in vitro synthesized, polyadenylated transcripts in predetermined ratios. When the procedure performed properly, the labeled transcripts specifically hybridize only to complementary control probes in arrays and the data can be scanned to track quality control assurance with minimal self- or cross-hybridization. More details description regarding the spiked-in control intensities and normalization procedure after scanning the array and data analysis is refer to previous publications20, 21. The following procedure is given to the routine microarray users.\nPrepare 100 pg high quality RNA sample (RNA Integrity number (RIN) value at least > 7.0) in a total volume of 10 - 11 µL.\nAmplify the RNA samples with an amplification kit being able to work with pico-scale samples (as little as 100 pg).\n\tNOTE: Recommended amplification kit information is available in Material List and follows the manufacturer's instructions without any modification.\nUse a fluorescence-based quantitation to evaluate the profile of the size range of the amplified aRNA.\nUse the spectrophotometer instrument (based on the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm) to measure the concentration of the amplified aRNA.\nStore the amplified aRNA at -80 °C until ready for labeling.\nUse 2 µg of amplified RNA for fluorescent labeling according to ULS aRNA labeling kit user guide.\n\tNOTE: Since Cyanine 547 and Cyanine 647 dye are sensitive to photo-degradation and Cyanine 647 dye is easily degraded by ozone, the labeling procedure takes place in a minimal amount of light and under an ozone-free environment.\nTurn on the ozone box (Figure 1A) until the level of ozone is 0.001 ppm.",
    "Do the reaction setup inside the ozone box (Figure 1B) by adding 2 µL of Cyanine 547 or Cyanine 647, 2 µL of labeling buffer, and then adjust to a final volume of 20 µL with RNase-free water under the safelight. Add darkroom filter to the light source.\nMix gently and incubate the tubes in a thermocycler at 85 °C for 15 min. Place samples on ice for at least 1 min. Spin down to collect content of tubes before proceeding with RNA extraction kit, except steps related to DNase treatment (from 1.9 to 1.11), to clean up the Cy-dye-labeled amplified RNA.\nUse the spectrophotometer instrument to measure and determine the concentration of labeled amplified RNA and keep the labeled aRNA at -80 °C maximum for 3 days before use.\n3. Microarray Hybridization and Washing\nNOTE: The following important steps are adapted according to Two-color Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol (version 6.5, May 2010).\nAdd equal amount of 825 ng from each Cyanine 547- and Cyanine 647-labeled aRNA and mix with 25x fragmentation and 10x blocking buffers.\nHeat the mixture at 60 °C for 15 min and cool on ice for 1 min.\nAdd equal amount of 2x hybridization buffer and mix well.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 rpm, then the mixture is ready for hybridization.\nLoad 100 µL from the mixture onto the array slide and seal the slide inside the hybridization chamber.\nLoad the assembled chamber into the hybridization oven for 17 h at 65 °C rotating at 10 rpm in oven.\nWash the arrays according to protocol with ozone protection treatment by dipping into stabilization and drying solution for 30 s.\nRemove the arrays from the solution and make sure the array surface is dry with no dust particles\n4. Scanning Microarray Slide",
    "Keep the arrays in dark place and turn on scanner until it is ready to use (15 min wait time).\nLoad the array barcode on left, into the scanner and start scanning. Do the spot analysis according to the software user guide and save the data as (gpr) file format.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nDownload the FlexArray software http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/FlexArray/license.php Click on “import raw data” and load the gpr files into FlexArray.\nPerform the normalization and statistical analysis if necessary by following the instruction. Note: Calculate the threshold for positive spot selection in this study as it was described previously22.\nSelect the drop down manual from the plot viewer of the FlexArray to view all the hybridized spots and background signals. Note: A similar picture of spiked in controls after hybridization to the microarray can be seen in previous study8.\nSelect a Loess normalization within array following by a quantile between arrays normalization process from the FlexArray drop down manual accordingly.\nExport all the normalized data from FlexArray into an Excel file for further usage.\n6. Bioinformatics Analysis\nThe original annotation of the probe sequences from Bovine Embryo-specific Transcripts (BESTv1) microarray has been described previously8. In present study, 20,403 unique Gene Symbols (GS) were obtained (Supplement File1[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53754/Supplement_file_1.xlsx]) through the EmbryoGENE Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) ELMA (http://elma.embryo-gene.ca). A list of 6,765 unique genes (Supplement File2[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53754/Supplement_file_2.xlsx]) was selected and corresponded to the all positive signals after microarray normalization process (Step 5.5) from bovine Day 7 embryos gene expression profile. Positive signal threshold was calculated based on pervious publication16 from the signal intensity of an A value.\nTo perform functional analysis with PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System23, 24, open the following link (http://www.pantherdb.org/about.jsp).",
    "Upload a list of 6,765 embryo-specific GS to identify specific biological process during embryonic development using statistical overrepresentation test and use default setting of Bos taurus (all genes in database) as reference list25.\n\tNOTE: This allows the identification of developmental-related processes from the GO terms that are statistically over- or under-expressed using a binomial test.\nSet P-value threshold at < 0.05 as software default. Data can be downloaded and exported into Excel file for further selection16.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
