Mitotic cells thus prepared have incorporated EdU at MiDAS sites and are collected by mitotic shake-off.\nNote: The incorporation of EdU in mitotic cells can be confirmed by preparing cells for detection of mitotic EdU foci by fluorescent microscopy.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nSeed 1.25 × 106 H1299 cells per T175 flask (15 flasks per condition).\nNote: The number of flasks to use depends on the number of mitotic cells recovered in previous optimization sections. We recommend aiming for at least 106 mitotic cells per experiment.\nPlace cells in the incubator for 48 h.\nTreat cells with 1.5 mM thymidine.\nPlace cells in the incubator for 16 h.\nWash cells with three times with 10 mL PBS.\nAdd 12 mL pre-warmed culture medium per flask supplemented with 6 μM RO-3306 and 0.2 μM aphidicolin.\nPlace cells in the incubator for 10.5 h.\nCritical: The duration and dose of aphidicolin treatment should delay S phase progression without preventing mitotic entry. The duration and dose of RO-3306 treatment should ensure that the cells are reversibly arrested in G2.\nNote: Here, low-dose aphidicolin treatment is used to slow down replication fork progression. Cells carrying certain genetic alterations (e.g., BRCA2 gene inactivation) also exhibit slow replication fork progression. The protocols above should be optimised accordingly for cells of each genotype.\nTreat cells with 2 mM hydroxyurea.\nPlace cells in the incubator for 1.5 h.\nWash cells three times with 5–10 mL pre-warmed culture medium supplemented 2 mM hydroxyurea.",
    "Critical: The total duration of the washes should not exceed 5 min.\nAdd 12 mL pre-warmed culture medium per flask supplemented with 2 mM hydroxyurea, 100 ng/mL nocodazole and 10 μM EdU.\nPlace cells in the incubator for 1.5 h.\nPerform a mitotic shake-off (e.g., gently tap the flask against a hard surface or with the hand) to detach the loosely attached mitotic cells, without lifting interphase cells. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nNote: Adapt the strength of the mitotic shake-off to each cell line. For example, H1299 cells reaching mitosis tend to stick to the flask, therefore a stronger shake-off is required. If many mitotic cells still remain attached, then the number of flasks should be increased.\nCollect the medium containing floating mitotic cells in 50-mL tubes.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash cells with PBS and transfer to one 15-mL tube per condition.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend cell pellets in 1 mL PBS. Make sure to obtain a single-cell solution by pipetting up and down several times.\nVortex cell solution at low speed and add ice-cold methanol, dropwise, to a final concentration of 90% (v/v).\nPlace fixed cells on ice for at least 1 h.\nPause point: The cells can be stored at −20°C up to several months.\nCell permeabilization and the ‘click’ reaction\nTiming: 3 h\nDuring this step, a cleavable biotin-azide is crosslinked to the EdU-labeled DNA using ‘click’ chemistry.\nNote: The protocol below is adapted from Macheret and Halazonetis.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nWash cell pellets with 3 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cell pellets in 1 mL permeabilization buffer per 3 × 106 cells.",
    "Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nWash cells with 3 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure that pipet tips are not contaminated with 2-β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol (DTT), as this would cleave the biotin-azide and thus prevent binding of the EdU-labelled DNA to the streptavidin beads.\nPrepare the biotin-azide ‘click’ reaction cocktail according to the table above (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Prepare 250 μL per 3 × 106 cells.\nResuspend cell pellets in 250 μL of biotin-azide click reaction cocktail per 3 × 106 cells.\nIncubate cell suspensions for 30 min at room temperature and in the dark.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nWash cells in 3 mL PBS.\nIsolation of EdU-labeled DNA\nTiming: 3–5 days\nDuring this step, DNA is purified and fragmented using sonication. Next, the EdU-labeled DNA is isolated using streptavidin beads that bind to the EdU biotinylated in the previous protocol. Finally, EdU-labeled DNA is prepared for next-generation sequencing.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in 400 μL lysis buffer.\nTransfer cells to a 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate samples in a water bath at 50°C for at least 3 h.\nPause point: The samples can be incubated overnight at 50°C.\nAdd 1 volume (400 μL) of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Mix by flicking and transfer to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nSpin in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min, at room temperature.\nRecover the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nAdd 1 volume (400 μL) of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Mix by inverting.",
    "Spin in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min at room temperature.\nRecover the aqueous phase (taking care not to touch the interphase) and transfer to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nAdd NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 M (16 μL of 5 M NaCl). Mix well.\nAdd 1 μL of glycogen as carrier.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding 2 volumes (832 μL) of ice-cold ethanol.\nIncubate for 2 h at −20°C.\nPause point: The samples can be kept at −20°C for several months.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard the supernatants. Be careful not to disrupt the pellets.\nWash with 70% ice-cold ethanol.\nSpin in a micro-centrifuge at maximum speed for 15 min at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard the supernatants. Be careful not to disrupt the pellets.\nLet the pellet dry for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 55 μL TE buffer.\nLet the DNA resuspend at room temperature for several hours.\nPause point: The samples can be left at room temperature overnight or stored at −20°C for up to several months.\nMeasure the DNA concentration using a Qubit fluorometer with dsDNA BR assay kit.\nTransfer 5–15 μg of DNA to a new 1.5-mL tube. Adjust the volume to 105 μL with water.\nNote: If the starting material is lower, proceed with as much DNA as possible.\nOptional: Retrieve 5 ng DNA to be used as a chromatin input sample to generate baseline for the sequencing profiles.\nUse a bioruptor to sonicate the DNA into fragments of 100–500 bp.",
    "Critical: The bioruptor settings should be optimized to obtain DNA fragments of 250 bp in length (range 100–500 bp). The size of the DNA fragments can be checked on an agarose gel. For instance, chromatin was sheared for 6 sonication cycle (15 s ON /90 s OFF) using a bioruptor PICO from Diagenode. Note that efficiency of the sonication depends on the type of tube used.\nRun 2 μL of sonicated DNA on a 1% agarose gel and assess the length of DNA fragment using gel imaging system.\nResuspend the Dynabeads MyOne Streptadvin C1 beads in the vial by vortexing.\nTransfer 50 μL of bead suspension in one 1.5-mL tube per sample.\nPlace the tube on the magnet for 1–2 min. Carefully aspirate and discard the preservative solution while the tube is on the magnet. It is essential not to let the beads dry.\nRemove the tube from the magnet and wash the beads with 50 μL of 1×BW buffer.\nResuspend the beads by vortexing at low speed and perform a short spin (1,000 × g, 20°C, 5 s).\nPlace the tube on the magnet for 1–2 min. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatants while the tube is on the magnet.\nRepeat the washing steps two more times.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL 2×BW buffer.\nTransfer 100 μL of beads to a new 1.5-mL tube. Add 100 μL of sonicated DNA.\nIncubate the samples for 15 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel to allow the binding of the EdU-labeled DNA.\nPlace the tube on the magnet for 1–2 min. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatants while the tube is on the magnet.\nRemove the tube from the magnet and wash the beads with 200 μL of 1×BW buffer.",
