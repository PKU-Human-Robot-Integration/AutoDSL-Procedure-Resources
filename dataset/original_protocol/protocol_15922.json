    "This protocol can be applied to any cell type actively proliferating. We have successfully used this protocol to profile RT of different cell lines, such as human fibroblast (IMR90), human lymphocytes (Jurkat), human hepatic cells (HepG2), osteosarcoma cells (U2OS), human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). With this protocol intact, live cells can be prepared to facilitate analyses of the RT program by Repli-seq (Rivera-Mulia et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-bib-0029]).\nMaterials\n5–10 × 106 cells of interest (see step 1 for details on starting cell numbers)\nMedium for the cell type of interest\nBrdU​ (Sigma, cat. no.

R1100), optional\nPlates/flasks to grow the cells of interest, e.g., 100-mm × 20-mm style dish (Corning cat. no. 430167)\n37°C incubator\n15-ml round-bottom tubes (Falcon, cat. no. 2059)\nAutomated cell counter (e.g., CountessII-FL, or equivalent)\n5-ml, 12-mm × 75-mm round polypropylene bottom culture tube (VWR, cat. no. 60818-500)\nBenchtop centrifuge\n36-μm nylon mesh (Fisher Scientific, cat no.

AMF5000, or equivalent)\nCAUTION: All procedures involving BrdU should be protected from light since BrdU is sensitive to light.\n1. Start with healthy growing cells at ≤65% confluency.",
    "High confluency levels can significantly impact the cell cycle (Boquest et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-bib-0001]). Also, nutrient depletion in the medium, competition for the surface area on the culture plate or flask, and cell death can occur with high confluency (Topman et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-bib-0037]). Hence, it is preferable to harvest cells when the confluence is ≤65%. Starting with 5 to 10 million cells allows for obtaining sufficient replicates from samples with at least 5% of S-phase cells (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/16e3bc25-7286-4dc9-94e6-a7408ff418c9/cpz1945-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nLive cell staining for Repli-seq sample preparation.

(E) Dye concentration optimization for DNA staining in H9 embryonic stem cells. (F) Incubation time optimization in Jurkat cells.\n2. Add BrdU into the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 100 μM (46 µl of 10 mg/ml BrdU for 15 ml). Incubate cells for 2 hr at 37˚C to allow BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA.\nIf it is the first time labeling a specific cell line, perform a BrdU immunostaining to validate nucleotide analogue incorporation.\n3. Rinse the cells in culture gently with PBS twice using an add, swirl and aspirate procedure.",
    "All procedures should be protected from light since BrdU is sensitive to light.\n4. Dissociate the cells from the culture plates using its specific/validated dissociation agents for the specific cell type of interest (trypsin-EDTA, accutase, or TrypLE, etc.).\n5. Inactivate the dissociation agent by adding 3 ml of medium supplemented with FBS per every ml of trypsin. Pipette gently but thoroughly to obtain a single-cell suspension. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml round bottom tube.\n6. Assess cell viability using trypan blue staining. A viability of >90% is desirable. Count the cells and prepare aliquot 1 × 106 cells per replicate in 5-ml round-bottom culture tubes (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0002]).\nAchieving single-cell suspension is critical for proper staining. Cell clumps are problematic as the staining agents cannot penetrate aggregates.\n7. Centrifuge 5 min at ∼200 × g, room temperature, and carefully discard the supernatant by pipetting (do not aspirate to avoid sample loss).\n8. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of medium and filter using 36-μm nylon mesh filters to remove aggregates to ensure good staining.\n9. Per 1 × 106 cells, add 1 µl of the cell-permeable DNA dye DyeCycle Vybrant Violet Stain (other colors are also available, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-tbl-0001] and Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0002]).\nThe recommended concentration is 1 μl per 1 × 106 but this needs to be optimized as distinct cell lines incorporate the staining agent differently (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-tbl-0002] for specific conditions for distinct human and mouse cell lines).

Incubate the cells at 37°C for 30 to 90 min, protected from light, and invert the tube gently every 10 min. Keep cells at 37˚C until ready for sorting.\nStaining temperature and incubation time must be optimized per cell type (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-tbl-0002]). Maintaining the temperature is critical (37°C), so assemble a humid chamber to transport samples while keeping them warm until sorting. Figure 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0002] shows example images of cell cycle profiles obtained with distinct incubation times with the DyeCycle Vybrant Violet dye.\n11. Prepare at least six collection tubes per sample (6 × 1.5-ml tubes, for three replicates of early S phase and three replicates of late S phase fractions). Add 400 μl of Zymo lysis buffer or DNA/RNA Shield per collection tube.\nSorting into Zymo lysis buffer should be followed by immediate DNA purification using Quick DNA Microprep Kit from Zymo. Alternatively, cells can be sorted into DNA/RNA shield and kept at room temperature up to a month or store frozen indefinitely.\n12. After staining with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet proceed immediately to FACS cell sorting. Sort cells directly into collection tubes containing 400 μl of Zymo lysis buffer or DNA/RNA Shield from step 11.\nDo not wash or fix the cells, this could wash away the staining and give you the wrong results.\n13. For DyeCycle Vybrant Violet sort samples use the ∼405 nm excitation and ∼440 nm emission wavelength settings. For other colors, use corresponding excitation and detection settings. See other dye examples in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-tbl-0001].\n14. Perform sorting calibration before each experiment to ensure accurate cell cycle analysis.",
    "Using the Sony SH800 cell sorter, we perform chip alignment and calibration using the manufacturer's fluorescent beads.\n15. Adjust cell sorter parameters to use low FSC thresholds to detect all particles in the sample (on the SONY SH800 we use 1.0% FSC). Minimize gain settings to enable accurate measurement of DNA staining (FSC of 2, and BSC in 25% to 30% and FL1 Brilliant Violet 40%).\n16. Cell sorter gating strategy: \n         \nUsing the log scale, select most events by plotting the BSC area on the y-axis and the FSC area on the x-axis.\nGate singlets with Vybrant Violet area on the y-axis and Vybrant Violet height on the x-axis.\nGating for cell collection is based on the cell cycle stages based on DNA content, i.e., by plotting events on the y-axis and the Vybrant Violet area on the x-axis (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0002]).\nFor a typical sample with normal cell cycle, discrimination of cells in particular phases of the cell cycle based on differences in their DNA content is made by selecting the higher peak as G1, later a plateau S phase, and finally a second peak, not as big as the first one, G2 phase (cells under treatments that affect the cell cycle would have distinct profiles and untreated controls would be needed).\nSet a low flow rate (<500 events/s) for optimal resolution.\n17. Sort between 20,000 to 40,000 cells from each S-phase fraction directly into collection tubes from step 11 containing Zymo lysis buffer or DNA/RNA Shield and mix well by vortexing.\n18. Purify DNA following the Zymo Quick DNA Microprep kit instructions.\nOther gDNA isolation kits/manual methods can be used, but we found higher yields using the Quick DNA Microprep Kit from Zymo.",
    "19. Purified DNA samples can be stored in the dark indefinitely at −20°C or can be processed by library preparation immediately as described in Rivera-Mulia et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-bib-0029]). Briefly, continue Repli-seq processing by performing DNA fragmentation, DNA clean-up, end-repair, adapter ligation, and indexing as described in Rivera-Mulia et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-bib-0029]) (see Understanding Results).",
    "A starting cell number of 2 to 2.5 million cells per replicate is necessary for nuclei isolation, staining and sorting. We recommend using a starting cell number of 5 to 10 million cells. This should be enough to obtain sufficient replicates from samples with at least 5% of S-phase cells.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol)\nNuclei isolation lysis buffer (see recipe)\nNuclei wash and resuspension buffer (see recipe)\n1. Follow steps 1 to 5 from Basic Protocol 1 (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/56f66440-0ac4-4003-b62a-5e4c6d867104/cpz1945-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nIntact nuclei cell cycle analysis for Repli-seq.

Phase contrast, Vybrant Violet staining and merged images are shown. (C) Lysis efficiency estimation. Cell viability assay based on trypan blue staining on an automated cell counter is used to assess intact nuclei isolation (>90% of trypan blue positive nuclei are required). (D) Cell cycle profiles comparison between live cells (top) and intact nuclei (bottom) stained with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet. Gates used to filter cells/nuclei and singlets are shown with percentage of selected populations. Early and late S-phase fractions gating for Repli-seq is shown in blue and red, respectively.\n2. Assess cell viability with trypan blue staining (>90% is desirable), count the cells, and aliquot 2 million cells per replicate in 1.5-ml tubes.\nSingle-cell suspension and aggregate removal are critical for proper staining. Cell clumps are problematic as the staining agents cannot penetrate aggregates.\n3. Prepare fresh nuclei isolation lysis buffer. Store the lysis buffer on ice until use.\n4. Prepare 50 ml of the nuclei wash and resuspension buffer. Once prepared, this can be stored at –20˚C and used for up to 6 months. Always store on ice when used.",
    "5. Centrifuge the cells 5 min at ∼200 × g, room temperature.\n6. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\n7. Resuspend the cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer and pipette up and down 5 times or until the cells have fully resuspended in the lysis buffer, avoiding the formation of air bubbles.\n8. Transfer the cells to ice and allow lysis for 1 to 5 min (this time needs to be optimized based on the type of cells being used).\n9. Add 800 μl of nuclei wash and resuspension buffer and pipette up and down 5 times to quench lysis.\nValidate proper nuclei isolation using a cell counter or tissue culture microscope.\n10. Centrifuge the nuclei 10 min at 500 × g, 4°C.\n11. Carefully remove the supernatant.\n12. Add 1 ml of nuclei wash and resuspension buffer.\n13. Centrifuge the nuclei 10 min at 500 × g, 4°C.\n14. Carefully remove the supernatant.\n15. Repeat steps 12 to 14 twice.\n16. Resuspend the nuclei in 1 ml of nuclei wash buffer and resuspension buffer and pipette gently 10 times or until the nuclei are fully resuspended.\n17. Count the final number of nuclei using standard trypan blue dye staining.\nIntact nuclei will be stained with the trypan blue dye due to absence of the cell membrane and show up as ‘dead’. Live cells with an intact cytoplasm will not be stained. 85% to 90% stained nuclei demonstrate successful nuclei isolation (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]).\n18. Stain the nuclei with DNA Vybrant DyeCycle Violet. Add 1.5 μl of Vybrant DyeCycle Violet per 1 × 106 nuclei per ml for each replicate and then incubate in the dark at 37˚C for 15 min before sorting.",
    "Verify nuclei staining using a cell counter of the fluorescence microscope (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]). The recommended concentration is 1 μl per 1 × 106 but this needs to be optimized as distinct cell lines incorporate the staining agent differently. In addition, other permeant or non-permeant dyes are also compatible with the intact nuclei produced in this protocol (DAPI, Hoechst 33342, DRAQ5, etc.); however, concentration and incubation times need to be optimized per cell line.\n19. After staining, pipette 5 times, and filter the stained nuclei into FACS tubes using a 36-μm nylon mesh filter into 1.5-ml FACs tubes to get rid of any clumps or debris.\n20. Observe the nuclei under the microscope using a bright field and DAPI filter to ensure they are intact and well stained (see Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]).\n21. Prepare at least six collection tubes per experiment (6 × 1.5 ml tubes, three replicates for early S phase and three for late S phase fractions). Add 400 μl of Zymo lysis buffer or DNA/RNA Shield per collection tube.\nSorting into Zymo lysis buffer should be followed by immediate DNA purification using Quick DNA Microprep Kit from Zymo. Alternatively, cells can be sorted into DNA/RNA shield and kept at room temperature up to a month or store frozen indefinitely.\n22. Sort samples on the cell sorter using the ∼405 nm excitation and ∼440 nm emission wavelength settings on the cell sorter.\n23. Adjust cell sorter parameters:\n         \nUse low FSC thresholds to detect all particles in the sample (on the SONY SH800 we use 1.0% FSC).\nMinimize gain settings to enable accurate measurement of DNA staining (FSC of 2, and BSC in 25% to 30%).\nCell sorter gating strategy: \n               \nUsing the linear scale, select most events putting the BSC area on the y-axis and the FSC area on the x-axis.",
    "Gate singlets with Vybrant Violet area on the y-axis and Vybrant Violet Height on the x-axis.\nExclude doublets by creating a combination of same-channel bivariate plots utilizing area versus height.\nThen, the gate is based on the cell cycle by plotting events on the y-axis and the Vybrant Violet area on the x-axis (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]).\nDo not wash or fix the nuclei, this could wash away the staining or lead to loss of the nuclei.\nThe parameters for sorting live cells and nuclei are similar. Since nuclei are smaller than live cells, the forward and side scatter parameters will be lower. The right population for sorting needs to be gated accordingly (see Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.945#cpz1945-fig-0003]). Set a low flow rate (<500 events/s) for optimal resolution.\n24. Sort 20,000 to 40,000 intact nuclei from each S-phase fraction directly into collection tubes (step 21) containing Zymo lyis buffer or DNA/RNA Shield and mix well by vortexing.\n25. Purify DNA following the Zymo Quick DNA Microprep kit instructions.\nOther gDNA isolation kits/manual methods can be used but we found better yields using the Quick DNA Microprep Kit from Zymo.\n26. The samples can be stored in the dark indefinitely at −20°C or proceed with library preparation for Repli-seq using purified DNA as described in Rivera-Mulia et al.
