    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes two different methodologies using the BLI system. The first is affinity measurement and the second is epitope binning. Antibodies used for these assays can be obtained from diverse sources and can be used in different formats. Therefore, the protocol described here, begins after the identification and selection of antibodies, which specifically bind a certain antigen, and after the molecular cloning of these antibodies to a full-length IgG format.\nFinal well volume throughout all experiments should be 180–220 μL.\nBiotinylation of antibodies\nTiming: 2 h\nIn order to accurately measure the antibody affinity towards its ligand, the optimal setup is to immobilize the antibody to the sensor and incubate it with free ligand (Kumaraswamy and Tobias, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Thus, it is necessary to validate that the dissociation rate of the ligand from the antibody is faster than the dissociation rate of the antibody from the sensor. Generally, immobilization of biotinylated antibody to a streptavidin coated-sensor would assure minimal dissociation drift and therefore is highly recommended for this setup.\nAntibody biotinylation\nVerify that antibodies are in PBS solution (or any other suitable buffer without primary amines).\nAdd Biotin to purified antibodies using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS Biotin kit (ThermoScientific), according to manufacturer instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/21217#/21217[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/21217#/21217]). Usually, molar ratio of 20:1 (biotin: antibody) is used.\nDiscard excess of free biotin. Use Amicon Ultra 50,000 NMWL (or smaller) centrifugal filters with the appropriate volume. Dialysis buffer excess of 500-fold or higher, should be obtained. Alternatively, dialysis cassettes such as Slide-A-Lizer with similar NMWL specifications can be used. Determine biotinylated antibody concentration (either by Nanodrop, BCA assay etc.) and verify that the labeled antibodies have retained their binding activity. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]",
    "Alternatives: Other kits or methods for biotinylation of antibodies can be used. In these cases, several antibody: biotin ratios should be examined for optimal labeling.\nInitial characterization of antibody-antigen binding\nTiming: 60 min\nIt is recommended to perform an initial assay using only one antigen concentration, in order to assess the integrity of the biotinylated antibody and the strength of the antibody-antigen interaction. In this assay, non-specific binding of the antigen to the sensor should also be examined, using an unloaded sensor, with no antibody.\nAntibody immobilization\nRehydrate two streptavidin biosensors in a biosensor rack with a 96-well black plate containing 200 μL/well binding buffer, for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute biotinylated antibody (to a final concentration of 5–10 μg/mL) in 200 μL binding buffer and use in the loading step. Add 200 μL binding buffer to a second well to test non-specific binding. Dilute antigen (50–100 nM) in 200 μL binding buffer and use in the association step.\nProgram the Data Acquisition software with the following steps:\nLoading: 300 s\nBaseline: 60 s\nAssociation: 180 s\nDissociation: 60 s\nExecute the binding assay (all steps are performed at 30°C with shaking at 1500 rpm). According to the program described in step C, the antibody is loaded on the sensor (step i), then washed (step ii) and allowed to bind the antigen (step iii). The sensor is then dipped in binding buffer (step iv) to allow dissociation.\nVerify that the antibody was properly immobilized to the sensor and that it binds the antigen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Otherwise, please refer to the troubleshooting section (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Initial characterization of antibody-antigen interaction",
    "Biotinylated antibodies (mAb1-3) are loaded on separate streptavidin (SA) sensors (I; loading), washed (II; baseline) and allowed to bind the antigen (III; association). The sensors (loaded with the antibody-antigen complex) are then dipped in the binding buffer (IV) to measure dissociation. Different mAbs may exhibit different levels of loading, which may affect subsequent Rmax.\nNote: The loading step is mainly affected by antibody concentration and biotinylation effectivity. Optimally, a wavelength shift of ∼0.7–1.5 nm should be reached within 2–3 minutes. If such shift was not observed, antibody concentration can be adjusted accordingly.\nNote: In this step, the optimal antigen concentration range for affinity measurements should be defined. The concentration used here is the one intended to be the highest concentration examined in the affinity measurements. A concentration of 50–100 nM is a good starting point and will cover most medium to low affinity antibodies. A good binding for this concentration should give ∼0.5 nm wavelength shift (in the Association step). However, if the concentration used did not give the desired wavelength shift, this step should be repeated using different concentrations (higher or lower, depending on the observed shift) until the optimal range is achieved. If the desired wavelength shift (0.5 nm) was achieved in less than 180 sec, the program can be manually switched to the next step.\nAffinity measurements\nTiming: 60 min\nIn this assay, loaded sensors are incubated in parallel with several concentrations of the antigen (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Kon and Koff are measured and the subsequent KD is calculated, as a measure of antibody affinity towards the antigen. This assay should be carried out after validating the biotinylated antibodies’ activity and confirming that non-specific binding of antigen to the sensor is not detected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of affinity measurement using BLI",
    "During the antibody loading step, biotinylated mAb is simultaneously immobilized to several SA sensors. Following a wash step, each sensor is dipped in the antigen solution (containing different antigen concentrations) and the association rate between the antigen and the antibody is measured. The complex is then dipped in buffer and the dissociation rate is measured.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Recommended plate layout for affinity measurements\nAssociation is measured with four antigen concentrations (column 4). An additional sample with no antigen is added as control (well 4E). Buffer containing wells are used for initial baseline and neutralization (column 1) and for second baseline and dissociation (column 3).\nRehydrate five streptavidin biosensors in a biosensor rack with a 96-well black plate containing 200 μL/well binding buffer, for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute biotinylated antibody in binding buffer to a final volume of 1000 μL.\nNote: The recommended antibody concentration is 5–10 μg/ml, however, concentration should be adjusted according to the results of step 2, to obtain the desired wavelength shift of 0.7–1.5 nm, which ensures an effective presentation of the antibody for subsequent binding by the antigen, without introducing avidity effect. Since the loading level will influence binding (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) it is important to ensure identical loading for all five sensors used for each affinity measurement.\nDilute antigen in binding buffer (200 μL for each concentration). The antigen should be prepared in four titrated concentrations, preferably in two-fold serial dilutions (for example, in Noy-Porat et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] (Noy-Porat et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) concentrations of 12.5 nM–100 nM were used). An additional well containing only binding buffer should be used as control.",
    "Plate preparation and assay execution. Assays are performed in black 96-well plates. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for a recommended plate layout. Add the biotinylated antibody and antigen samples to the appropriate wells. Add binding buffer and Glycine solution to the appropriate wells (200 μL per well). Glycine is used for the regeneration step. Binding buffer is also used for baseline stabilization, analyte dissociation and neutralization (after sensor regeneration).\nProgram the Data Acquisition software with the following steps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], phase I-VII):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A representative assay run for affinity measurement\nFive sensograms are presented, representing four antigen concentrations and a control (blank) sample with no antigen. Loading levels should be identical for all sensors, to ensure accurate subsequent measurements. The loading step was manually stopped once a wavelength shift of 1.5 nm was reached. Differences in association levels are expected to be dependent on antigen concentration. Control sensogram should show no wavelength shift and should be subtracted from all other sensograms.\nBaseline: 60 s\nLoading: 120 s\nBaseline: 60 s\nAssociation: 300 s\nDissociation: 600 s\nRegeneration: 15 s\nNeutralization: 30 s\nNote: Assay step times can be adjusted according to the strength of the interactions observed or the quality of the biotinylation. Based on this pre-assessment, the final antigen concentrations used in the assay will be determined.\nCritical: Plates layout can be changed. However, each step solution must be located in the same column. Make sure that the plate layout is identical to the one programmed in the Data Acquisition file.",
    "Note: It is highly recommended to limit the antibody loading step to a wavelength shift of 0.7–1.5 nm, to avoid avidity effect that may influence the resulting KD. Therefore, the timing of the loading step (step 7b) is set to 120 sec and once the desired wavelength shift is reached, the program can be manually switched to the next step. However, if the antigen induces a subsequent low wavelength shift, the loading step can be prolonged (up to a wavelength shift of 4 nm). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nNote: In the first baseline step, a stabilization of the sensogram should be observed. Timing may be prolonged accordingly.\nNote: Regeneration and neutralization steps are not mandatory and are only needed if sensors are intended for re-use.\nExecute the assay (all steps are performed at 30°C with shaking at 1500 rpm). See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a representative assay run.\nAnalyze data with Data Analysis software (see detailed explanation in the “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section).\nNote: Antibody-loaded sensors can be re-used in subsequent assays provided that full regeneration was accomplished (sensograms return to step 7c baseline levels). Immediately after sensor ejection to the sensor-tray, quickly collect them and immerse in binding buffer. For longer periods, sensors should be kept refrigerated while assuring that they are kept immersed in binding buffer. Some antibodies are highly sensitive to the regeneration step and thus the sensors cannot be reused. Such antibodies will not be able to bind the antigen following regeneration.\nEpitope binning\nTiming: 120 min",
    "This assay allows the classification of mAbs according to different epitope clusters upon a given antigen. This method does not allow for precise epitope mapping, since two antibodies may not be able to simultaneously bind the antigen (competing antibodies) as a result of steric interference or due to targeting adjacent epitopes. However, antibodies that do bind together (non-competing), can certainly be classified as belonging to different groups. Thus, the assay allows classification of antibody binding sites on the antigen, based on the proximity of their respective epitopes.\nIn this assay, antibody-loaded sensors are incubated with a single concentration of antigen, washed and incubated with the unlabeled antibody counterpart (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). In each set of experiments, the background signal is obtained from a parallel sensor incubated with the same antibody as the capture antibody (unlabeled), and background signal is subtracted from all the sensograms. Such background signal may arise from non-specific binding of unlabeled mAbs to the sensor. Non-specific binding of the antigen to the sensors should also be ruled out before executing the assay, as explained in step 2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic representation of epitope binning using BLI\nBiotinylated mAb1 is immobilized to a SA sensor and allows to bind the antigen. The sensor (after a wash step) is then incubated with a second, unlabeled mAb, and its ability to bind the mAb1-antigen complex is measured. If mAb2 competes with mAb1, it will not be able to bind and no additional wavelength shift will be observed. In some cases, if mAb2 has a substantially higher affinity towards the antigen than mAb1, a decrease in wavelength might be detected. A sample with the same mAb (mAb1) as both labeled and unlabeled antibodies, is used as negative (self-competing) control. The negative control sensogram should be subtracted from all other sensograms.",
    "Rehydrate eight streptavidin biosensors in a biosensor rack with a 96-well black plate containing 200 μL/well binding buffer, for at least 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute biotinylated antibody (b-mAb1) in binding buffer to a final volume of 200 μL. Recommended concentration: 10 μg/mL.\nDilute each tested unlabeled antibody (mAb1 to mAb8) in binding buffer to a final volume of 200 μL. Recommended concentration: 10 μg/mL\nDilute antigen in binding buffer to a final volume of 1600 μL. The concentration of the antigen should be pre-optimized based on the affinity of the mAbs to the desired antigen, in order to obtain a maximal saturation of the immobilized antibody. In most cases, antigen is used at a concentration of 10–20 μg/mL.\nCritical: A monovalent antigen should be used, allowing the binding of one antibody molecule to one antigen molecule. If the desired antigen includes more than one antibody binding site (for example if the antigen is a dimer), saturation of all binding sites must be accomplished, during the activation step (Mechaly et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPlate preparation and assay execution. Assays are performed in black 96-well plates. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for recommended plate layout. Add the antibodies and antigen samples to the appropriate wells. Add binding buffer and Glycine solution to the appropriate wells. Binding buffer is also used for baseline stabilization, analyte dissociation and neutralization.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Recommended plate layout for epitope binning\nOne mAb is used as capture antibody (in our assay this antibody is biotinylated: b-mAb1; column 2). A total of seven different antibodies can be measured at each run (represented by different colors in column 5) whereas an identical mAb (unlabeled mAb1) serves as control (well 5A). The antigen is used in a single concentration.\nProgram the Data Acquisition software with the following steps:\nBaseline: 120 s",
    "Loading: 300 s\nBaseline: 30 s\nActivation: 300 s\nBaseline: 30 s\nAssociation: 300 s\nDissociation: 60 s\nRegeneration: 15 s\nNeutralization: 30 s\nExecute the assay (all steps are performed at 30°C with shaking at 1500 rpm). See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] (phase I – IX) for a representative assay run.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1008-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Representative assay run for epitope binning\nMab1 is used as capture antibody, loaded on the sensor, and also as second antibody in the control sample (black curve). Following antigen binding to mAb1, antibodies 1–8 are added. Only mAbs 4–6 bind the antigen in the presence of mAb1, as reflected by the wavelength shift. All other mAbs do not bind, giving a flat curve, similar to the control.\nAnalyze the data. For each run, a sample with the same antibody (e.g., mAb1) implemented as both the capture and second antibody should be used as control, to determine background drift. This sample should be subtracted from all other samples (see representative Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] in the “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section).\nNote: To achieve high signals, it is advisable to ensure maximal loading of the sensor with the immobilized antibody (3–4nm wavelength shift). This can be obtained by extending the loading step or by increasing the concentration of the biotinylated antibody.\nNote: In the activation step, the antigen is allowed to bind to mAb1. Baseline time (step 15e, phase V in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) is short to avoid dissociation of the antigen from mAb1. The second, unlabeled mAb is then allowed to bind during the association step. The ability of mAb2 to bind in the presence of mAb1 will be reflected by an additional wavelength shift. Each mAb must be tested as both first (capture) and second antibody in order to achieve reliable classification.",
    "Note: When testing two mAbs which differ substantially in their affinities towards the antigen, some wavelength shift may be observed due to the removal of the low affinity mAb by the high affinity one. Reciprocal testing of the two mAbs will thus enable a more accurate decision regarding their classification. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nNote: In cases where a decrease in wavelength is observed after the activation step (due to dissociation of the antigen), step 15e (baseline) may be omitted, to enhance subsequent association signal.\nNote: If needed, diluted antigen can be reused in subsequent assays. Due to evaporation, sample volume should be re-adjusted to 200 μl with water.\nNote: This method can be applied to assess mutual binding of more than two antibodies, enabling the evaluation of steric interference within antibody cocktails. Such interference may occur even if each individual antibody was assigned to a different epitope within the antigen.\nOptional: This assay can also be employed in a different format: the antigen can first be immobilized on the sensor and the two mAbs are then loaded in tandem (antigen → mAb1→ mAb2). However, this setup requires that binding by mAb1 will reach saturation before applying mAb2. The setup described above, where the first mAb serves as a capture antibody, ensures that, for each antigen molecule, the binding site of mAb1 is already occupied, therefore allowing binding of mAb2 only if it does not compete with mAb1."
