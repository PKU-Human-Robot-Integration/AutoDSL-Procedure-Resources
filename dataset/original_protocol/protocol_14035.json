    "Animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Principles of Laboratory Animals, prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, and published by the National Institutes of Health. All animal protocols were approved by the responsible local authority (the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee).\n1. Animal care\nObtain mice at the age of 14 weeks weighing approximately 27 g (e.g., from the Institute of Laboratory Animals).\n\tNOTE: BALB/c mice are used for this article.\nKeep mice under conventional conditions in ventilated cabinets, feeding them standard mice chow and autoclaved water ad libitum.\n2. Mouse preparation\nUse an induction chamber to anaesthetize mouse with isoflurane (3.5%).\nRemove the hair over the chest and neck using a hair trimmer.\nPlace mouse in supine position on a heated pad and maintain anesthesia with a facemask covering mouth and nose of the mouse.\nCheck for sufficient depth of anesthesia by pinching the hind feet and tail to verify an absence of reflexes.\nInject subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) for analgesia.\nSpread the hind and fore limbs and fix their position using tape.\nWith povidone iodine, disinfect the shaved area, followed by scrubbing with 80% ethanol. Repeat this step twice.\nUse a small scissor to make a midline skin incision from the lower third of the sternum to the chin.\nUse curved forceps and carefully separate the muscles around the neck to expose the trachea.\nUse a micro-scissor to perform a tracheotomy between the second and third cartilage rings.\nSet the ventilator to a ventilation frequency of 110/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 mL.\nRemove the facemask and insert a plastic cannula (20 G), connected to the ventilator, into the trachea. Ventilate the animal.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the ventilation cannula is not inserted too deep by confirming bilateral lung ventilation.\nUse cautery to detach the right pectoralis muscle from its sternal origin between the third and seventh ribs.\nUse side angled spring scissors to cut the fourth to sixth ribs as close as possible to the sternum.\nCauterize the mammary artery, if bleeding is visible.\nDecrease isoflurane to 2.5%.\nDissect underlying connective tissue to obtain a clear view into the chest cavity.\nUse blunt forceps to open the pericardium and expose the heart.\nUse a mini Goldstein retractor to spread the ribs and keep the chest cavity open.\nLift the heart from the thoracic cavity with a blunt rod.\nDecrease the tension of the retractor to reduce chest opening and to keep the heart from falling back.\nPrecool the cryoprobe (3 mm diameter) for 10 s.\nApply the cryoprobe on the anterior left ventricle wall and freeze for 10 s to generate a left ventricular cryo-injury infarct.\n\tNOTE: The cryoprobe can be applied to different heart walls depending upon the scientific question and need. \nIrrigate the cryoprobe with room temperature saline to detach the probe from the left ventricular wall.\nUse the retractor to enlarge the chest opening.\nGently return the heart to the thoracic cavity with a blunt rod.\nRemove the retractor and connect the sternotomy with a single knot using 6-0 suture.\nClose the chest cavity using 6-0 running suture. Use a 10 mL syringe to evacuate any remaining air from the chest before tying the knot.\nAdapt the skin at the caudal edge and suture it to the point of the tracheal opening with running suture (5-0).\nSet isoflurane to 1.5% and wait until the animal gains spontaneous breathing.",
    "Remove the tracheal catheter and reapply the facemask onto the animal mouth and nose to maintain anesthesia.\nClose the tracheal incision with one 8-0 suture.\nReposition the ventral neck muscles back to their position to cover the trachea.\nComplete the skin suture.\nAdd metamizole to the drinking water (50 mg metamizole per 100 mL) for pain analgesia for 3 days and monitor the animal daily.\n\tNOTE: The observation period for this model is 8 weeks. Be sure to follow your institution's guidelines regarding analgesia regimen. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
