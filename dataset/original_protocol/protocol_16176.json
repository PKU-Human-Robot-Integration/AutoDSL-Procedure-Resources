These enzymes should not cut your GOI. Use a DNA documentation program such as SnapGene Viewer to plan the cloning. To maintain the reading frame, bases might have to be added between the restriction site and the GOI. It is possible to use any base, but take care that no stop codon is generated.\nWe recommend adenosine or thymidine to have a lower melting temperature.\n2. Check which restriction enzymes cut your vector only once and not your GOI. If you have chosen two enzymes, check the efficiency of both enzymes in the restriction buffer, and if possible, use the same buffer for both enzymes.\nYou can use the following website for help: https://nebcloner.neb.com/#!/redigest[href=https://nebcloner.neb.com/#!/redigest].\n3. Design oligomers for cloning, which include the restriction site, additional bases, and around 20 to 30 bases of your GOI. Use the table from New England Biolabs, and add bases according to the restriction enzyme (https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/chart-image/cleavage_olignucleotides_old.pdf?la=en[href=https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/chart-image/cleavage_olignucleotides_old.pdf?la=en]).\nPCR amplify gene of interest\n4. As a template for the GOI, use either a plasmid or cDNA.",
    "In our case, we used the pLenti6/V5-p53-R249S plasmid (Addgene #22935).\n5. In PCR reaction tubes, set up a PCR as follows (50 µl total PCR volume):\n         \n32.5 µl water\n10 µl of 5× Phusion buffer\n1 µl of 10 mM dNTP mix\n2.5 µl of 10 µM TP53 forward oligomer\n2.5 µl of 10 µM TP53 reverse oligomer\n2 µl DNA\n0.5 µl Phusion polymerase.\nIn the case of cDNA, plasmid DNA, and genomic DNA, dilute to 50 to 100 ng.\nUse a high-fidelity polymerase with proofreading function to get a high accuracy of your GOI. This is especially important if you have a gene with a point mutation.\n6. Run PCR using a thermal cycler and the following conditions:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n1 cycle,30 s,98°C,(initial denaturation)\n29 cycles,10 s,98°C,(denaturation)\n,30 s,variable,(annealing)\n,30 s per kb,72°C,(extension)\n1 cycle,10 min,72°C,(final extension)\nFinal step,indefinitely,4°C,(hold).\nUse 60°C for the annealing temperature for the first time. If 60°C does not work, try a temperature gradient to detect the optimal annealing temperature.\n7. Prepare a 1% (w/v) agarose gel with 1× TAE and SYBR® Safe (1:10,000 dilution) to assess PCR amplification. Run 5 µl sample mixed with 6× DNA gel loading dye. Use a 1-kb DNA ladder to identify the size of your GOI. Run gel at 130 V for 15 min.\n8. Purify PCR products with a positive result using the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n9. Elute sample in 25 µl water. To achieve a higher concentration, prewarm water to 50°C. Measure concentration with a spectrophotometer.\nThe concentration of the sample should vary between 10 and 50 ng/µl.\n10. Freeze sample at −20°C, or proceed with digestion.\nDigest PCR product and vector\n11. Prepare each digestion in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube as follows (30 µl total volume):",
    "24 µl purified PCR product\n3 µl of 10× CutSmart® Buffer\n1 µl restriction enzyme NdeI\n1 µl restriction enzyme PacI\n1 µl water.\n12. Prepare digestion of modulation vector as follows (20 µl total volume):\n         \n2 µg undigested pSin-EF2 modulation vector\n2 µl of 10× CutSmart® Buffer\n1 µl restriction enzyme NdeI\n1 µl restriction enzyme PacI\nBring to 20 µl with water.\n13. Incubate both digestions overnight at 37°C. Do not incubate longer than 15 to 16 hr.\n14. Prepare a 1% (w/v) agarose gel with 1× TAE and SYBR® Safe (1:10,000 dilution). Use a comb with a 30-µl volume capacity in order to load the entire digest.\n15. Mix whole digestion with 6× loading dye, and load on gel. As a control, load 200 ng undigested vector. Use a 1-kb DNA ladder as a reference for the sample size. Leave one empty well between samples and DNA ladder to prevent contamination.\n16. Perform electrophoresis at 130 V for 15 min.\n17. Use a UV transilluminator to visualize bands of digestion. Wear protective equipment to protect from UV light.\n18. Cut out respective band with a scalpel, and place gel containing GOI in a prelabeled microcentrifuge tube.\n19. Purify sample using the E.Z.N.A.® Gel Extraction Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n20. Measure concentration.\n21. Freeze sample at −20°C, or proceed with ligation.\nLigate GOI and modulation vector\n22. Calculate amount of insert required for the ligation reaction using the free calculator available at http://www.insilico.uni-duesseldorf.de/Lig_Input.html[href=http://www.insilico.uni-duesseldorf.de/Lig_Input.html]. Use the following details for calculation:\n         \nVector size: 8324 bp\nVector amount: 50 ng\nInsert size: 1182 bp\nMolar ratio: 1:3.\nIf the insert size is more than 4 kbp use a molar ratio of 1:3 and 1:5 in the software.\n23. Prepare ligation as follows (10 µl total volume):\n         \n50 ng digested vector",
    "21.3 ng digested insert\n1 µl of 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer\n1 µl T4 DNA ligase\nBring to 10 µl with water.\n24. Prepare ligation control as follows (10 µl total volume):\n         \n50 ng digested vector\n1 µl of 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer\n1 µl T4 DNA ligase\nBring to 10 µl with water.\n25. Incubate ligation mixture overnight at 16°C. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\n26. The next day, proceed with transformation.\nTransform\n27. Let TOP10 chemically competent cells thaw on ice for 10 min. Use one vial of competent cells per ligation reaction.\n28. Add 10 µl ligation mixture to chemically competent cells in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix gently by tapping tube.\n29. Incubate on ice for 10 min.\n30. Place reaction tube in a 42°C heating block for 1 min (heat shock).\n31. Stop reaction by placing cells on ice for 2 min (cold shock).\n32. Add 300 µl LB medium without antibiotics.\n33. Shake at 37°C for 40 min at 800 rpm.\n34. Spread 150 µl cells on 10-cm LB agar plates containing ampicillin.\n35. Incubate plate overnight at 37°C. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\nThe ligation control should technically have no clones. The ligation control is done to determine the experimental background. If colonies grow on the control plate, it might be undigested or contain religated vector. There should be no or a significantly lower number of colonies on the ligation control plate compared with the ligation plate of your GOI.\n36. Wrap plate with Parafilm® M, and store at 4°C until further use.\nAnalyze plasmid\n37. Pick 3 to 5 clones from each plate, and individually add to 15-ml conical tubes containing 5 ml LB medium with ampicillin.",
    "For each tube pick a separate colony (e.g., with a sterile pipet tip).\n38. Incubate culture overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\n39. Prepare a glycerol stock of the cultures in a cryovial by adding 500 µl culture to 500 µl glycerol. Store at −80°C for further use.\n40. Perform a mini-prep with the remaining culture using the E.Z.N.A.® Plasmid Mini Kit I following manufacturer's instructions.\n41. Perform a digest of plasmid to control integration of the insert. As a control, digest 200 to 300 ng plasmid as described above. Stop digestion after 2 hr.\n42. Check digestion on agarose gel to see whether two bands of the correct size are visible. Discard any plasmids that do not contain inserts or have fragments of the wrong size.\n43. Prepare sample for sequencing according to requirements.\nCheck how many micrograms of vector DNA are required by the chosen sequencing company and if the primer should be added or sent separately. Inform yourself how long the sequenced area is or if different lengths can be booked. For sequencing, you can use the forward or reverse primer from the PCR amplification. If you have a point mutation in your GOI, make sure the sequenced area covers the mutation. If the forward or reverse primer does not cover the point mutation, you can design your own sequencing primer. Choose a site around 20 to 30 bp before or after your point mutation because sequencing is poor at the beginning. The primer should have a length of ∼20 bp.\n44. Compare sequencing results with your own vector, which contains the GOI. If it matches, proceed with the next step.\n45. Prepare a midi- or maxi-prep from the positive plasmid to obtain enough material for virus production.",
