  "procedures": [
    "All herein-described procedural steps were performed in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of the University Heart and Vascular Center Hamburg guidelines and after written informed consent was obtained.\n1. Fully endoscopic MIS MV repair\nEnsure the patient is under general anesthesia, in a supine position, scrubbed with iodine disinfectant, and draped with a sterile drape.\nGain thoracic access along the peri-mammillary margin through the fourth intercostal space.\nAchieve distension of the intercostal space using a soft-tissue retractor.\n2. Percutaneous cannulation of groin vessels\nPosition two cannulas in the femoral artery and vein under transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guidance to establish CPB for MIS.\nPerform puncture of the femoral artery using a standard puncture needle and insert a 0.035 mm guidewire under TEE guidance.\nDetermine the depth of the initial puncture using a puncture-locating dilator, which is inserted over the wire. This detects puncture depth by outlet backflow/the stop of backflow.\nDefine the depth at skin level, which is defined by the visible stop of backflow of the measuring tool.\n\tNOTE: For the later release of the vessel closure device, deployment depth is defined as the puncture depth at skin level plus 1 cm.\nPlace the arterial cannula (sizes vary according to body surface area) over the wire and connect it to CBP.\nPuncture the femoral vein medial to the artery in the same manner (step 2.2) and after insertion of the venous cannula connects to the CBP.\n3. MV repair\nInsert the 3D-HD camera over the thoracic incision.\nOpen the pericardium above the right site phrenic nerve using diathermy.\nPlace a transthoracic Chitwood aortic clamp through a small incision for cross-clamping of the aorta under the induced ventricular fibrillation.",
    "Arrest the heart with antegrade Del-Nido cardioplegia and moderate hypothermia of 32 °C, which is established and maintained by the heart and lung machine. The effectiveness of cardioplegia is documented by an electrocardiogram.\nOpen the left atrium with scissors and lift the left atrial roof with a dynamic retractor.\nExpose the MV and inspect the pathology, by prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet in this case.\nDetermine the size for the correct annuloplasty ring and neochordae via an annuloplasty measuring tool and a caliper for the length of native chordae.\nResuspend the posterior mitral leaflet (PML). Implant the annuloplasty ring by implanting the neochordae at the respective papillary muscle and placing circumferential annulus sutures.\nSecure the neochordae to the papillary muscle, pass twice through the free margin of the posterior leaflet, and knot down.\nPlace circumferential sutures around the annulus and then put the sutures through the annuloplasty ring, which is taken down onto the annulus via the sutures.\nClose the left atrium with a polypropylene, non-absorbable 4-0 suture; remove the aortic cross-clamp.\nClose the thoracic access and perform CBP weaning.\n4. Decannulation and vascular closure\nRemove the venous cannula using a Z-suture technique at the cannula entrance site and tie down the suture after pulling out of the cannula.\nFor closure of the femoral artery, use the collagen plug-based closure device.\nClamp the arterial cannula, puncture the cannula, and insert a wire under TEE guidance.\nRetract the cannula over the wire by holding the wire in place to ensure a safe wire position in the descending aorta.\nInsert the closure system sheath fully over the wire and remove the dilator.\nInsert the closure device over the integrated insertion tool and slowly remove the whole system at a steady 45° angle under constant retraction force to the measured depth.",
    "Observe markings on the sheath, adjust the deployment depth, and rotate the lever for toggle release.\nRetract the system further from the femoral artery until tension appears and the indicator field appears yellow/green.\nAdvance the lock advancement tool until a click is heard; the puncture is now sealed via an extravascular collagen plug.\nWhen hemostasis is obtained, remove the guide wire, cut the lead suture, and close the skin with a single suture.\nApply a pressure bandage for 6 h.\n\tNOTE: This is the end of the surgery.\nSubscription Required.
