Littermates are ideal.\nNote: The following steps are for mice harboring a tamoxifen inducible CreERT2 allele and LoxP flanked genetic elements to initiate recombination in vivo prior to harvesting the cells for in vitro culture.\n5mg Tamoxifen intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, 3 days prior to SVZ dissection\nUse a 1mL tuberculin syringe with a 27G needle\nFill the syringe with tamoxifen and wipe the tip of the syringe before inserting the needle on the syringe.\nPerform i.p. injection with 250 μL (5 mg) of 20 mg/mL Tamoxifen per mouse, 3 days before the NSC harvest.\nNote: The typical dose of Tamoxifen is 100 mg/kg live weight. However, we examined the recombination efficiency with i.p. injections of 1 mg–6 mg tamoxifen and found that 5 mg Tamoxifen ensures recombination of the floxed allele in adult mice of C57bl/6 and swiss webster background strains with weights ranging from 20 g to 60 g, without any toxic effects on neural stem cells. We have also used this dosage in multiple CreER and floxed mouse lines (Radecki et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Samanta et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nClean the gross dissection tools with 70% ethanol and allow to air dry.

The beaker should be placed on ice to cool down the instruments.\nRinse the tools in ice cold RPMI media in a 250 mL beaker with Kimwipes lining the bottom, before touching the brain tissue with them. RPMI is used as a more cost-effective alternative to DMEM/F12 (no difference was found using either solution). Anti-Anti is not necessary in the wash solution, as the ethanol and wash solutions are changed between harvest groups.",
    "Note: 6 animals is the maximum we have found that can be harvested into 3 plates at the same time without affecting downstream results. If NSCs are to be harvested from more than 6 mice in 1 day, it is recommended to change the ethanol and wash solution for all tools and the acrylic brain matrice after each harvest (2 mice). This ensures the tools remain clean and effective between harvests.\nLeave the tools in ice cold RPMI media when not in use.\nPrepare and chill Dissection Media to 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\n200 mL for washing tools and an additional 25 mL for the SVZ pooled from 2 mouse brains.\nPlace 22 mL of dissection media into a 100 mm cell culture plate, and 3 mL into 35 mm cell culture plate for each pair of mice.\nPrepare NSC proliferation media on the day of dissection\nPrepare enough NSC Proliferation media with growth factors for anticipated number of plates.\nNote: Each plate contains the SVZs from 2 mice in 20 mL of NSC proliferation media\nBrain dissection and sectioning.\nPerform cervical dislocation or place the mouse in a CO2 chamber for euthanasia.\nSpray 70% ethanol on the dorsal surface of the body beginning just caudal to the ears and moving rostrally to the nose.\nSeparate the head from the body with a cut at the level of the atlanto-occipital joint using a large curved scissor (7 cm blade) placed immediately caudal to the ears.\nNote: Slight deviations rostrally or caudally will not affect the final generation of neurospheres.\nCut the skin from the dorsal surface of the head with a scissor.",
    "Make a midline incision through the bone on the dorsal side of skull from the cut surface at the base of the skull to the orbits, using a small scissor (2 cm blade).\nNote: Use pointed tip forceps to lift the skull flap on either side of the incision to expose the brain\nRemove the brain from the skull using a flat tip forcep and place it in the coronal acrylic brain matrice with the dorsal surface of the brain facing up (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPlace blades, 1 mm apart, in the matrice, starting from the brain-olfactory bulb interface to the rostral end of the dorsal hippocampus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: Blades should be kept in ice-cold RPMI and the matrice should be kept on ice before use. It is critical that the blades and matrice are cold and moist, as warm or dry tools will cause the brain slices to affix to them resulting in tearing/damage to the slices. Slices are only obtained from the forebrain (approximately 8–9 mm, i.e. 8–9 slices), and the remaining brain is discarded.\nStarting from the rostral end, lift each blade and transfer the brain slice to the chilled dissection media in a 100 mm dish kept on ice.\nNote: Transfer each brain slice from the blade to the media using the pre-cooled flat tip forcep. Collect all brain slices up to the dorsal hippocampus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). DO NOT collect the sub-granular zone (SGZ) of the dorsal hippocampus.\nSVZ micro-dissection and dissociation.\nPlace the 100 mm dish with 1 mm brain slices under a dissecting microscope\nIdentify the brain slices where the lateral ventricles on both sides are separated from each other.",
    "Note: In the caudal slices, the lateral ventricles connect in the midline. There are typically 3–4 slices that contain easily identifiable lateral ventricles in each hemisphere, not joined in the midline.\nDissect the SVZ from the brain slices with fine tip forceps and angled spring scissors with a 3–4 mm cutting edge (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B)\nIncise a 1–2 mm wide layer of tissue bordering the lateral ventricles including the ventral apex, the medial wall, and the lateral wall of the ventricle in each slice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, pre-dissection, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D post-dissection)\nNote: The striatum lies lateral to the lateral wall of the ventricle and can be identified by the speckled appearance of the striosomes under the microscope. The tissue between the striatum and the lateral ventricle is dissected for the SVZ (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nPlace the dissected SVZ in the chilled dissection media in a 35 mm dish kept on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1413-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Instead of holding the tissue with the forceps, pin the tissue with the tip of the scalpel blade, and use the forceps to pull the tissue towards the sharp edge of the scalpel blade for mincing.\nNote: It is not critical to generate the smallest piece possible, rather the goal is to cut the SVZ tissue to allow downstream digestion to occur more efficiently.\nCollect the minced SVZ tissue in 50 mL conical tubes using a regular p1000 pipette tip and wash the bottom of each 35 mm plate with the last 1mL of dissection media to dislodge as many pieces of the SVZ as possible.\nSpin the tissue at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the tissue in 1mL of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37°C.\nIncubate the tissue in a 37°C water bath for 5min.\nAdd an equal volume (1 mL) of 1 mg/mL Trypsin Inhibitor solution.\nUse a 3 mL syringe with 25G needle to dissociate the tissue into cells, taking care not to introduce air bubbles while triturating.\nSpin the cells at 500 g for 5min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL NSC Proliferation Media. Transfer the cells to a deep 100 mm plate with NSC Proliferation Media (total 20 mL) and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: 20 mL media is essential to provide enough space for neurospheres to grow in suspension without touching the bottom of the plate. Deeper plates are recommended to avoid over-filling and prevent spills during handling. Alternatively, T25 or T175 cell culture flasks can be used with twice the recommended volume of media.\nPrimary neurosphere growth and supplementation\nTiming: 7 days total\nThis step is for initial growth and expansion of primary, fate-mapped SVZ neural stem cells.",
    "Allow the dissociated cells to expand for 48 h without disruption.\nAfter 48 h, add fresh 40 μL of 10 μg/mL EGF (20 ng/mL final), 20 μL of 10 μg/mL bFGF (10 ng/mL final), and 20 μL of 0.2% Heparin (0.0002% final) directly to each dish and swirl gently.\nAfter 3–4 days, clusters of cells or neurospheres are visible.\nNote: Allow primary neurospheres to grow for 7 days, or until they reach an average diameter of 150 μm. The media is not changed in the first 7 days to allow the neurospheres to grow without any disturbance.\nNote: There will be some cell debris in the culture, but neurospheres are identifiable as bright spheres with well-defined edges. In case of neurospheres derived from fate-mapped NSCs, they should be uniformly positive for the fluorescence marker as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.

Growth of neurospheres\n(A) RFP expressing fate-mapped neurospheres imaged 5 days after dissociation of tertiary neurospheres.\n(B) Graph of the diameters of secondary neurospheres during the first 5 days after dissociation shows that neurosphere growth rates are consistent across experiments. The size of neurospheres were 24.3 ± 2 μm on day 1, 46.7 ± 0.9 μm on day 2, 75.3 ± 4.1 μm on day 3, 116.6 ± 0.7 μm on day 4, and 153.7 ± 0.9 μm on day 5. N = 3 independent cultures, data ± SEM.\n(C) Images of secondary neurospheres comparing their size at each day after dissociation. On day 5, neurospheres begin to show a dark center which expands as they grow larger with a necrotic center. The bottom right is an example of neurospheres attached to the bottom of the plate, and beginning to differentiate.\nNeurosphere passaging\nTiming: 1 h prep, 30 min active passaging",
    "This step is for dissociating neurospheres with an average diameter ∼140–160 μm into single cells.\nWarm the NSC Proliferation media to room temperature.\nTake an aliquot of NSC Proliferation media and add growth factor supplements\nWarm 0.25% Trypsin and 1 mg/mL Trypsin Inhibitor in a 37°C dry/water bath.\nRemove the plates with neurospheres from the incubator and collect 10 mL of media with neurospheres in a 50 mL conical tube, with a sterile 10 mL serological pipet.\nDislodge the attached neurospheres by gently pipetting the remaining 10 mL of media in the plate, repeatedly ∼2–3 times.\nAdd the remaining 10 mL of media containing the dislodged neurospheres to the previous 10 mL media in the 50 mL conical tube.\nSpin the neurospheres at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C to form a pellet.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL Trypsin to the pellet followed by needle trituration.\nIncubate the dissociated neurospheres in a 37°C dry/water bath for up to 5 min.\nAdd an equal volume (1 mL) of 1 mg/mL Trypsin inhibitor and swirl gently to mix.\nDissociate the neurospheres into a single cell suspension by needle trituration in a 50 mL conical tube with a 3 mL syringe and 25G needle.\nNote: Minimizing air bubbles at all steps will help ensure NSC survival. The presence of some bubbles will not cause a significant reduction in NSC survival. However, an excess of bubbles or froth (equal to 1/3 or more of the total volume of the cell mixture) will negatively impact downstream results.\nSpin the cells at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL NSC Proliferation media.\nDepending on the stage of passage, the neurospheres can be split using the following ratios (# starting plates:# final plates)",
    "Primary to secondary neurospheres = 1:1\nSecondary to tertiary neurospheres = 1:3\nTertiary to quaternary neurospheres = 1:3\nNote: Although neurospheres can be expanded for additional passages, we do not passage past the tertiary neurosphere stage. This minimizes the selection pressure on neural stem cells, preserves their in vivo characteristics and at the same time provides us enough cells for in vitro experiments.\nDissociated neurospheres can also be counted and plated at specific densities. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B shows the growth rate for tertiary neurospheres after plating 1 × 106 cells from secondary neurosphere cultures. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nPlate cells in 20 mL of NSC Proliferation media in a deep 100 mm plate.\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C shows images of neurospheres growing during the proliferative phase after the first passage, as well as an example of attached neurospheres with differentiating cells. It is important to passage neurospheres when they reach 150 μm diameter as larger neurospheres can become necrotic if allowed to expand excessively. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nOptional: Neurospheres can be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen, in the proliferative stage. It is recommended to freeze secondary neurospheres that are highly proliferative. Three days after splitting primary neurospheres, collect secondary neurospheres from one 100 mm plate by centrifuging them at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C. Resuspend the cells in 2 mL Freezing Media (NSC Proliferation media+10% DMSO), and freeze 1ml aliquots following standard cell freezing protocols. Upon thawing, discard the supernatant containing the freezing media after centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and then plate the cells in NSC proliferation media. The cells can be passaged after 72 h following the above protocol. This method has been successful for all mice including genetically modified mice.\nNeural stem cell plating, differentiation, and treatment",
    "Timing: 2 h prep over 3 days, 30 min differentiation, up to 14 days total for differentiation\nIn these steps, proliferating neurospheres are dissociated into single cells, plated onto coated dishes, and differentiated for up to 14 days with or without pharmacologic or genetic manipulations.\nFor differentiation, the NSCs are plated on 12 mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Coating the coverslips with growth factor reduced Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel) takes at least 21 h as described below:\nEtch the glass coverslips for 6 h by immersing them in 1 M hydrochloric acid at 37°C.\nRinse the coverslips twice in 70% ethanol at room temperature.\nIncubate the coverslips in 70% ethanol for 6–12 h in a 120–200 rpm shaker at room temperature.\nTo dry the coverslips, place the individual coverslips at a 45° angle, by resting the edge of the coverslip against the wall of the well in a 24-well plate, for at least 12 h or overnight.\nNote: Coverslips can be prepared ahead of time, as long as the plates containing the coverslips are maintained in a sterile environment prior to use.\nCoat the wells of the 24-well plates directly with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (GFR-Matrigel) for total RNA extraction or coat the etched coverslips for immunofluorescent analysis, a day before NSC dissociation.\n1mg of GFR-Matrigel is sufficient to coat one 24-well plate.\nNote: This is equivalent to 42 μg of GFR-Matrigel per well or 0.52 mg/cm2 in a 24-well plate. (Total surface area/well of a 24-well plate=1.9cm2). 1mg of GFR-Matrigel is also sufficient for one 6-well, one 12-well, one 48-well, or one 96-well plate.\nThaw the GFR-Matrigel on ice, then mix with 12 mL of cold media (RPMI, DMEM, or any buffered media).",
    "Add 500 μL of GFR-Matrigel/media mixture to each coverslip/well and then shake the plate to ensure that the media covers the entire coverslip/well.\nNote: Use a pre-chilled micropipette tip to dilute the matrigel and to add the diluted solution to each well.\nPlace the plates in the biosafety cabinet for 3–12 h at room temperature to allow the GFR-Matrigel to polymerize.\nFollowing polymerization, the plates containing GFR-Matrigel can be stored for up to 2 weeks at 37°C. However, using these plates within 48 h of preparation is recommended.\nImmediately before plating the cells, aspirate the GFR-Matrigel from the well, and do not allow the GFR-Matrigel to dry completely. It is not necessary to rinse the wells after aspirating, however rinsing will not compromise plating or growth of cells.\nDissociate the proliferating neurospheres as in steps 17–22.\nIncubate the neurospheres in 0.25% Trypsin at 37°C for up to 5min.\nAdd an equal volume of trypsin inhibitor to inactivate the trypsin.\nDissociate the neurospheres into a single cell suspension by needle trituration in a 50 mL conical tube with a 3 mL syringe and 25G needle.\nNote: Gently pass the cells through the 25G needle, taking care not to introduce air bubbles while triturating. However, a few bubbles will not reduce survival of NSCs significantly. An excess of bubbles or froth (equal to 1/3 or more of the total volume of the cell mixture) will negatively impact downstream results.\nSpin the dissociated cells at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nGently resuspend NSCs in 1 mL NSC Proliferation media by pipetting the pellet ∼3 times.\nCount cells and determine cell density.\nTypically, one 100 mm plate of tertiary neurospheres will generate 4–6 × 106 total cells.",
    "1.5 × 106 cells are necessary for plating in a 24-well plate (0.63 × 105 cells/well) to ensure adequate cell numbers per well.\nDilute cells as needed to obtain 12 mL cell suspension with 1.5 × 106 cells in NSC Proliferation media.\nOptional: DNA plasmids can be introduced into NSCs while they are in a single cell suspension before plating on Matrigel coated surfaces. This step is performed after cell counting as the cell number is critical for successful nucleoporation. This procedure utilizes the Amaxa Nucleofector 2b machine (Lonza cat# AAB-1001), the Amaxa Mouse NSC Nucleofector kit, and plasmids of interest e.g. pCS2-MT_Gli2_FL for over-expression of full length Gli2 protein. Following the manufacturer’s instructions in the Nucleofector kit, use 3 × 106 cells for a 24-well plate (1.25 × 105 cells/well) and 10 μg of plasmid DNA for each reaction, as mentioned below in steps 29–32. The higher number of cells is necessary to overcome cell death observed in ∼40%–50% nucleofected cells.\nFollowing the manufacturer’s instructions, add 0.5 mL nucleofector supplement to 2.25 mL of the Cell Line Nucleofector Solution V, provided in the Amaxa Mouse NSC Nucleofector kit, to make the Mouse Neural Stem Cell Nucleofector Solution. This combined solution is stable for three months at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure media are at room temperature including: (1) Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC) Nucleofector Solution; (2) NSC Proliferation Media\nNote: Plasmids of interest can be just thawed and do not need to reach room temperature\nDetermine the cell number to obtain 3 × 106 total cells for a 24-well plate (1.25 × 105 cells/well), assuming all the wells will be nucleofected with the same plasmid.",
    "Note: The following calculations are for one reaction used for nucleofection of all cells in one 24-well plate. This protocol cannot be scaled up for nucleofection of more than one 24-well plate. Although four nucleofection reactions can be performed in parallel, more reactions can delay the procedure, increasing cell death in subsequent steps.\nPrepare the appropriate number of cells for nucleofection and spin to pellet, and during the cell pelleting, prepare the Mouse NSC Nucleofector Solution with the necessary plasmid mixtures.\nPlace 3 × 106 cells in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 150×g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIn a separate 1.5 mL microfuge tube, add 100 μL of the Mouse NSC Nucleofector Solution for each 24-well plate of cells, and/or plasmid. For the nucleofection of 3 × 106 cells, add 10 μg of plasmid to the Mouse NSC Nucleofector Solution and mix by pipetting.\nNote: The reaction can be scaled down to 1.5 × 106 cells by adding 5 μg plasmid to 100 μL of Mouse NSC Nucleofector Solution, and for 0.75 × 106 cells by adding 2.5 μg plasmid to 100 μL Mouse NSC Nucleofector solution.\nNote: Mouse NSC Nucleofector Solution volume is kept constant; however the amount of plasmid can be scaled linearly with the number of cells.\nTurn on the machine and set the Amaxa Nucleofector Program to A-33 or A-033, depending on the version of the machine.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in the Plasmid + Mouse NSC Nucleofector solution and proceed to the nucleofection step as quickly and accurately as possible.\nAspirate the supernatant from pelleted cells.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet with 100 μL of the Plasmid + Mouse NSC Nucleofector solution mixture using a p200 pipette with a filter tip by gently pipetting 3–5 times or until the cells are resuspended in a homogenous opaque solution.\nUse the plastic pipette provided in the Nucleofector Kit, transfer the cell mixture from the microfuge tube to the bottom of a cuvette.\nNote: Avoid bubbles and ensure that the cell mixture completely covers the bottom of the cuvette.\nPlace the cuvette in the Amaxa Nucleofector machine and run program A-33 or A-033.\nImmediately add 500 μL of NSC Proliferation Solution at room temperature to the cell mixture. Then use the plastic pipette from step 32c to transfer the cells from the cuvette back to the microfuge tube that was used to pellet the cells in step 31c\nNote: To increase cell survival, minimize the amount of time the cells are suspended in the Nucleofector Solution. Some amount of cell death is unavoidable; hence we begin with a higher number of cells. Working quickly with no more than 4 reactions at a time results in at least 60% cell survival. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nFor 3 × 106 cells, add 600 μL solution containing the nucleofected cells to 11.4 mL of NSC Proliferation Media, mix by gently pipetting and plate 500 uL of the cell suspension in each well of a 24-well plate.\nNote: For 1.5 × 106 cells, resuspend the 600 uL of nucleofected cells in 5.4 mL of NSC Proliferation Media and plate 500 uL per well for total 12 wells. This resuspension can be scaled down depending on the number of cells used.\nAllow cells to adhere overnight (8–16 h) before changing the media to NSC Differentiation media.",
    "For pharmacological treatment of cells e.g., a small molecule Gli2 inhibitor, GANT58:\nTreat the cells with the drug, 3–4 h after plating or when >90% of cells have attached to the matrigel coated wells containing 0.5mL NSC differentiation media in each 24-well plate.\nUse 50 μL NSC Differentiation media per well to dilute GANT58 for more accurate pipetting\nFor one 24-well plate: Dilute 12 μL of 50 mM GANT58 (500 μM or 1000×) or 12 μL of DMSO (vehicle) in 1.2 mL NSC Differentiation Media.\nAdd 50 μL GANT58 or vehicle to 450 μL of NSC Differentiation media in each well of a 24 well plate (final concentration 50 μM GANT58 or 0.1% DMSO), gently swirl the plate to mix and return to the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange the media completely with fresh NSC Differentiation media every 48 h for up to 14 days.\nWarm the NSC differentiation media to room temperature.\nTake an aliquot of 450 μL per well, and add 50 μL GANT58 or vehicle.\nNote: NSC differentiation can be stopped at any time before 14 days, however for generation of mature MBP expressing oligodendrocytes, 14 days are recommended.

Cells can also be fixed with 4% PFA or 10% Formalin for 10 min before fixing with cold methanol. Cold methanol fixation works best for immunofluorescent labeling of MBP (myelin basic protein).\nRemove each coverslip from its well using coverslip forceps and place it cell side up on a sheet of parafilm inside a humidified chamber consisting of a tray with moist paper towel.\nAdd enough 1× PBS to cover the coverslip (typically 100 μL or less) taking care not to drop the liquid in the center of the coverslip to prevent dislodging the cells. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nNote: For visualization of EdU, we use the Click-IT EdU Alexa 647 kit and follow the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp10338.pdf]. Calculate the total volume of EdU reaction solution needed based on the volume of liquid that covers each coverslip i.e. 100 μL per coverslip.\nImmunofluorescent labeling\nWash coverslips with 1× PBS, 3 times for 5 min per wash.\nNote: Immunofluorescent labeling can be combined with EdU labeling.\nBlock non-specific staining\nPrepare fresh blocking solution consisting of 10% serum in the immunofluorescent labeling buffer solution consisting of 1% BSA and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. The serum is from the same species used to raise the secondary antibody.\n50 uL per 12 mm coverslip is sufficient to cover the cells.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nAspirate the blocking solution.\nDilute primary antibodies in the immunofluorescent labeling buffer solution.",
    "Incubate the cells with primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature.\nNote: If needed, the cells can be incubated in primary antibody overnight (8–14 h) at 4°C.\nAspirate the primary antibody and wash 3 times with 1× PBS for 5 min per wash.\nDilute secondary antibodies in the immunofluorescent labeling buffer solution.\nAll Invitrogen Alexafluor conjugated secondary antibodies, are used at a 1:1000 final dilution.\nAdd Hoechst (10 mg/mL stock) at a final dilution of 1:5000 (2 ug/mL final concentration) in the secondary antibody solution.\nAspirate the PBS and add 50–100 uL secondary antibody + Hoechst solution. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS for 5 min per wash.\nUsing a P1000 pipette put 4 drops of Fluoromount-G onto a standard microscope slide.\nAspirate the PBS from the coverslips.\nSlowly invert each coverslip on a drop of Fluoromount-G, total 4 coverslips per slide.\nRepeat this step as necessary for all coverslips.\nAllow the Fluoromount-G to solidify overnight (12 h minimum, up to 24 h will not effect results) at room temperature before imaging."
