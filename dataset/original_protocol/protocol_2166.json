    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nMolecular Cloning of ZGRF1 into pDEST20 Expression Vector\nTiming: 6 days\nTo express human ZGRF1 in insect cells, we first introduced the ZGRF1 cDNA into the pENTR™/TEV/D-TOPO™ vector, while introducing a C-terminal (His)6 tag to ZGRF1. The entry clone was subsequently introduced into the pDEST20 expression vector. As such, ZGRF1 harbors an N-terminal cleavable GST tag as well as a C-terminal (His)6 tag. The two tags enable the use of affinity matrices to greatly facilitate the protein purification process.\nNote: GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in pDEST20 vector can be obtained from the authors upon request.\nGenerating a Baculovirus and Expressing GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in Insect Cells\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nSf9 and Hi5 insect cells are commonly used for protein expression. The major advantages of insect cell expression (compared to bacterial expression) are increased solubility, improved protein folding, and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. This protein expression platform is particularly useful to express large proteins such as ZGRF1 and protein complexes. Once the ZGRF1-(His)6-pDEST20 expression vector is generated, the first step is to produce a recombinant baculovirus, which is then amplified in Sf9 cells to produce a high-titer viral stock for protein expression. We have found that Hi5 cells give higher yields of ZGRF1 protein than Sf9 or Tni cells (Expression Systems).\nGenerate the recombinant bacmid DNA.\nUse 10–25 ng of the ZGRF1-(His)6-pDEST20 expression vector to transform DH10Bac competent E. coli cells using the standard procedure.\nAfter transformation, add 1 mL SOC medium to the E. coli cells, shake the cells at 37°C at 200 rpm for 4 h.\nMake a 5-fold and 25-fold dilution of the cells with SOC medium, plate 100 μL of each dilution on an LB agar plate containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamicin, 10 μg/mL tetracycline, 100 μg/mL Bluo-gal, and 40 μg/mL IPTG.",
    "Incubate plates for 48 h at 37°C. Transfer a white bacterial colony into 3 mL LB culture containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamicin, and 10 μg/mL tetracycline.\nCritical: The incubation time in step 1d is critical. The LB plates need to be incubated at least 48 h at 37°C. Shorter incubation time may result in difficulties to distinguish between white and blue colonies.\nIncubate the culture in a 37°C shaking incubator for 12–16 h.\nExtract the bacmid DNA using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: (i) the 3 mL E. coli culture is resuspended, lysed, and neutralized with 0.3 mL buffers P1, P2, and 0.3 mL of 3 M potassium acetate, pH 5.5, respectively. (ii) Precipitate the bacmid DNA from the supernatant from the last step with 0.8 mL of isopropanol, centrifuge for 15 min at 14,000 × g to pellet bacmid DNA. (iii) Wash the pellet with 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol, remove the ethanol, and air dry the pellet for 10 min at 22°C–25°C.\nDissolve the bacmid DNA in 40 μL of 1× TE Buffer, pH 8.0, for 12–16 h at 4°C. Mix gently by tapping the tube. The average concentration of bacmid DNA is about 2–3 μg/μL.\nNote: The recombinant bacmid DNA could be amplified by PCR for sequencing using Sequencing Primers.\nUse the recombinant bacmid DNA to transfect Sf9 cells to produce a low-titer virus.\nTransfect Sf9 cells in a 6-well plate with the bacmid DNA using Invitrogen Cellfectin II Reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. Importantly, set up a negative control well without bacmid DNA.",
    "After transfection, incubate the cells in a 27°C humidified incubator for 8–9 days until signs of viral infection are visible. On day 4–5 after transfection, add 0.5–1 mL fresh medium to support the growth of the cells and to prevent the wells from drying out. On day 8–9, the control Sf9 cells should become saturated in the well, while the transfected Sf9 cells should be larger in size and with lower confluence (∼50% confluence).\nCollect the primary virus (P1 viral stock) by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min to remove cells and debris. The P1 viral stock can be stored at 4°C for 2–3 months.\nAmplify the viral stocks to generate a high-titer virus.\nGrow Sf9 cells to the density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Transfer 30 mL of cells into a 175 cm2 cell culture flask. Swirl the flask gently and place it in a 27°C humidified incubator for 30 min to allow attachment of cells.\nAdd 1 mL of P1 viral stock into the Sf9 cell culture flask and swirl the flask gently.\nIncubate the cells for 6–7 days in a 27°C humidified incubator or until about 40%–50% cells appear lysed.\nCollect the 30 mL of the Sf9 cell culture medium and transfer to sterile 50 mL snap-cap tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 500 × g for 5 min to remove cells and debris. This is the P2 viral stock and could be stored at 4°C for 2–3 months.\nRepeat the process to generate the P3 viral stock.\nCritical: The P3 viral stock should be made fresh and used for protein expression within 2–3 weeks.\nExpress the recombinant GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in Hi5 cells.",
    "An expression test experiment could be performed before large-scale expression by infecting 5 × 50 mL Hi5 cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) with 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 mL fresh P3 viral stock. Incubate the cells at 27°C at 170 rpm for 40–44 h. Harvest cells and perform an anti-GST western blot to determine an appropriate dilution of P3 viral stock for best expression.\nFor large-scale expression, innoculate 150 mL Hi5 cells into two 1,000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and incubate at 27°C at 170 rpm. Maintain the cells for 1 day and expand to 300 mL (0.6 × 106 cells/mL) for each flask.\nIt is important to perform viral infection when Hi5 cells are in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth at a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Infect the cells with 10–15 mL (or determined by the expression test) fresh P3 viral stock.\nIncubate at 27°C at 170 rpm for 40–44 h.\nCritical: The infection time here in step 4a and 4d is critical. Longer infection times may lead to aggregation of ZGRF1 and thus reduce the final yield of purified protein.\nAfter 40–44 h post infection, retrieve 10 μL of cell culture and examine it microscopically. The infected Hi5 cells should show an increase in cell diameter.\nHarvest cells at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the pellet at −80°C. Usually, 600 mL of the Hi5 cells will yield 7–8 g of cell pellet.\nPurification of GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Here, we describe the large-scale purification of the recombinant human ZGRF1 in Hi5 insect cells. The procedure exploits the GST tag at the N terminus and the (His)6 tag at the C terminus of ZGRF1. The typical yield of the recombinant GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 from 600 mL Hi5 cell culture is 50–100 μg. The GST tag could be removed by TEV protease if desired. All the purification steps are conducted at 0°C–4°C.\nPreparation of cell lysate.\nPrepare 100 mL Protein Lysis Buffer and keep on ice.\nThaw the frozen cells (∼8 g) and resuspend cells in the chilled Protein Lysis Buffer.\nTransfer the suspension into a beaker placed on ice.\nStir the mixture at 4°C for 15 min using a magnetic stirrer gently.\nSonicate the mixture at 50 amplitude with a 1/2 inch diameter probe, for 30 s three separate times on ice.\nCritical: It is critical to maintain the cell mixture at low temperature near 4°C. Keep the mixture on ice for at least 1 min after each 30 s sonication.\nClarify the crude lysate at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Keep a small aliquot of the clarified lysate for further analysis.\nAffinity purification based on the GST tag.\nPack 2 mL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin into a gravity column.\nWash the resin with 20 mL of ddH2O.\nWash the resin with 20 mL of Binding Buffer.\nSplit the equilibrated resin into two 50 mL snap-cap tubes.\nMix the clarified cell lysate (∼100 mL) with the affinity resin at 4°C for 1.5 h on a rotary platform at 40 rpm.\nCollect the resin in a chromatography column, drain by gravity for about 20 min.\nWash the resin with 50 mL Binding Buffer, three times. Combine the wash and keep a small aliquot of wash for further analysis.",
    "Optional: Wash the resin with 50 mL Binding Buffer plus 1 mM ATP, followed by 50 mL Binding buffer plus 5 mM MgCl2 will allow the removal of additional protein contaminants, such as ATP-dependent chaperones.\nElute GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 with 3 mL Glutathione Elution Buffer at 4°C for 10 min by repeatedly passing the eluate through the packed resin.\nRepeat the elution step three additional times with fresh Glutathione Elution Buffer. Keep a small aliquot of each eluate for further analysis.\nAfter elution, take a small amount of the resin for further analysis.\nAffinity purification based on the (His)6-tag.\nPack 0.5 mL of Ni-NTA Agarose resin into a narrow chromatography column.\nCritical: It is critical to use a small volume of Ni-NTA Agarose resin (∼0.5 mL), as larger resin volume will result in lower concentration of ZGRF1 protein.\nWash the resin with 5 mL of ddH2O.\nWash the resin with 5 mL of Binding Buffer.\nTransfer the resin to a new 15 mL snap-cap tube.\nMix resin with the eluate (∼12 mL) from the previous affinity purification step at 4°C for 2.5 h on a rotary platform.\nTransfer the resin suspension back to the chromatography column and drain by gravity.\nWash the resin with 50 mL Binding Buffer, three times. Combine the wash and keep a small aliquot of wash for further analysis.\nWash the resin with 25 mL Imidazole Wash Buffer. Keep a small aliquot for further analysis.\nElute the GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 protein with 0.6 mL Imidazole Elution Buffer at 4oC for 10 min by repeatedly passing the eluate through the packed resin.\nRepeat the elution with 0.6 mL fresh Imidazole Elution Buffer. Keep a small aliquot of each eluate for further analysis.\nAfter elution, take a small amount of the resin for further analysis.",

Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nAdd 44.5 mL Dialysis Buffer to a 50 mL conical tube and set aside.\nAdd 4 mL of Dialysis Buffer into the Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Device. Decant the buffer by shaking the device.\nApply the combined protein sample (∼1.2 mL) into the dialysis device.\nPlace the device slowly into the 50 mL conical tube containing the Dialysis Buffer. Make sure the membrane is in contact with buffer.\nCap the conical tube securely and mix gently on an orbital shaker at 4°C.\nContinue dialysis for 2 h at 4°C.\nChange the Dialysis Buffer in the 50 mL conical tube.\nContinue dialysis for 12–14 h at 4°C.\nCollect the dialyzed protein sample. Apply the sample to a Corning Spin-X Ultrafiltration Concentrator (500 μL, 50 kDa cutoff) to further concentrate to ∼500 μL.\nCritical: It is critical not to change buffer using Ultrafiltration Concentrator repeatedly, as this will cause aggregation of ZGRF1 protein on the membrane. Only concentrate it once to about 500 μL.",
    "Split the purified ZGRF1 protein into 5 μL aliquots, freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C. ZGRF1 remains stable at −80°C for several years.\nAnalyze the purified ZGRF1 by SDS-PAGE (4%–20%) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/175-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Final Purified and Concentrated ZGRF1\nZGRF1 final sample (4 μL) was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.\nRegulation of Human RAD51-Mediated D-Loop Formation Assay\nTiming: 4 days\nZGRF1 knockdown or knockout impairs HR efficiency, indicating its role therein (Adamson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Brannvoll et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). A D-loop formed between ssDNA and a donor duplex DNA is a key intermediate in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks or damaged DNA replication forks by HR. D-loop formation is catalyzed by RAD51 and multiple accessory proteins, such as BRCA1-BARD1 (Zhao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and RAD54 (Zhao et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Here, we describe an optimized protocol to investigate the regulatory function of ZGRF1 in the RAD51-mediated D-loop reaction. To accommodate the low concentration of purified ZGRF1, we used a concentration of RAD51, RAD54 and DNA 3–4 fold lower than what would normally be used.\nPreparation of pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA.\nPrepare the pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA using QIAGEN Plasmid Mini or Midi kit.\nExamine the topological state of the plasmid DNA by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis.\nCritical: The D-loop formation efficiency is sensitive to the topological state of the duplex DNA. The supercoiled form of plasmid DNA should be the major form, ideally ≥90% of total DNA.\n5′-end Radiolabeling of the 90-mer oligonucleotide.\nPurify the 90-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTC TGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTT-3′, ordered from IDT, complementary to positions 1,932–2,022 of pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA) from a 10% polyacrylamide gel.\nMeasure the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically. Store the purified oligonucleotide at −80°C until use.\nAdd the following reagents in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and mix.",
    "table:files/protocols_protocol_175_2.csv\nIncubate the labeling reaction at 37°C for 1 h.\nInactivate T4 polynucleotide kinase by incubating at 65°C for 20 min.\nRemove unincorporated [γ-32P]-ATP using Micro Bio-Spin P-6 Gel Columns (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nMeasure the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically. Store the labeled oligonucleotide at −20°C (shielded) until use.\nD-loop formation assay.\nNote: Before conducting D-loop formation assays, it is important to ensure that the purified ZGRF1 protein does not contain endo- or exonuclease contamination. Briefly, incubate 0–0.5 μg ZGRF1 with 10 nM 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide or dsDNA (of any sequence) at 30°C for 1 h in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT. The reactions are then deproteinized by treatment with SDS (0.1%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/mL) for 10 min at 30°C and then resolved in a 15% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. Any change in band intensity and migration pattern of the ssDNA or dsDNA, or appearance of short DNA smear (∼1–5 nucleotides) compared to the negative control indicate potential nuclease contamination.\nPrepare a master mix of D-loop reaction buffer in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_175_3.csv\nNote: The master mix in the above table is for ten reactions. After adding RAD51, RAD54, ZGRF1 and pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA, the final volume of each reaction is 12.5 μL.\nAssemble reaction mixtures in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\nFor each reaction, add 9.4 μL master mix to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 0.6 μL human RAD51 protein (4.5 μM) to a final concentration of 216 nM.\nIncubate the reactions for 10 min at 37°C to allow RAD51 to engage the ssDNA.\nAdd 0.5 μL human RAD54 protein (2.25 μM) to a final concentration of 90 nM.",
    "Incubate at 25°C for 2 min.\nAdd 1.0 μL human ZGRF1 protein (500 nM) to a final concentration of 40 nM. Use 1.0 μL Dialysis Buffer as negative control.\nImmediately add 1.0 μL pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA (600 μM base pairs) to a final concentration of 48 μM base pairs and mix.\nIncubate at 30°C for 5, 10, and 20 min.\nAdd 12.5 μL of 1% SDS and 2 μL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL) to stop the reaction.\nIncubate at 37°C for 5 min to deproteinize the reaction.\nCritical: It is critical that the human RAD51 and RAD54 are active; do not freeze and thaw the proteins repeatedly.\nAnalysis of the D-loop product.\nFor each reaction, withdraw 8 μL of the above deproteinized reaction mixture, and add 2 μL of agarose gel loading buffer.\nResolve the mixture in a 0.9% agarose gel in TBE buffer at 130 mA for 90 min at 25°C.\nDry the gel onto Whatman 3MM chromatography paper in a gel dryer for 1 h at 80°C.\nSubject the dried gel to phosphorimaging analysis.

NP, no protein. ∗, 5′-32P radio-label.\nNote: In this protocol, human RPA was not included in our reaction. However, addition of 400 nM RPA after RAD51-ssDNA filament formation (step 11e) does not change the ability of ZGRF1 to stimulate D-loop formation by RAD51-RAD54.\nD-Loop Dissociation Assay\nTiming: 3 days",
    "To test whether ZGRF1 plays a role subsequent to D-loop formation, we have tested ZGRF1 on purified D-loops made by Rad51. We make D-loops and then remove all the proteins by phenol-chloroform extraction and further purify them in a desalting column.\nD-loop generation.\nThe yeast Rad51-mediated D-loop reaction (250 μL) was performed with a 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide as described (Xue et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). First, prepare a master mix of D-loop reaction buffer in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_175_4.csv\nAdd 20 μL yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Rad51 protein (10 μM) to a final concentration of 0.8 μM.
