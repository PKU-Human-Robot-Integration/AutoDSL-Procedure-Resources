    "NOTE: Design, conduct, and reporting of animal experiments must take account of current guidelines15. Such work must be approved in advance by the local animal welfare authority (in our case, the Animal Ethics Committee of Macquarie University).\n1. Prepare the Zebrafish for Mounting and UV Cell Ablation\nGenerate zebrafish (Danio rerio) expressing fluorescent proteins.\n\t\nTo express fluorescent proteins of interest in zebrafish, perform plasmid injections into the one-cell stage of the zebrafish egg (as described elsewhere16) or use fluorescent transgenic lines. To label multiple cell types, create compound transgenic zebrafish lines by crossing established transgenic lines pertinent to the question of interest. Place one male and one female zebrafish on each side of a false-bottom pair mating tank in the evening and remove the divider with the onset of light the next morning (as detailed elsewhere17). Keep the zebrafish at 28 °C and handle them according to the established protocols17,18.\nCollect the embryos after successful spawning by straining the tank water containing the embryos through a plastic tea strainer. Rinse the eggs with system water and transfer them into egg water in a Petri dish.\nExamine them under a light microscope to determine fertilization. Store fertilized eggs in a Petri dish and place them in an incubator at 28 °C18.\nOptional: Perform a microinjection to label specific cell populations.\n\tNOTE: This is an alternative method that allows for the expression and visualization of proteins, without the need to raise stable transgenic lines. This method is also advantageous when the protein of interest is toxic and prohibits the generation of a stable transgenic lines.\n\t\nInject the plasmid constructs into the one-cell stage of zebrafish embryos, as described elsewhere19,20,21.",
    "NOTE: This method results in the mosaic expression of the protein of interest. The protein of interest is driven from a promoter of choice (e.g., islet122, -3mnx123,24, met25, or mpeg126) flanked by Tol2 inverted repeats20.\nAge the fish to the desired size.\n\t\nRaise the fish to 3 - 5 days post fertilization (dpf) and place them under a fluorescent compound microscope. Screen the animals for appropriate fluorophore expression and select the brightly labeled fish. Separate the appropriate larvae into another dish with egg water for embedding later on (store in a 28 °C incubator).\n\t\tOptional: Embryos can be placed into a 0.2 mM 1-phenyl-2-thioures (PTU) Ringers solution at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) to inhibit the formation of pigmentation. Care must be taken with PTU, as it is toxic and can have adverse physiological, genetic, or morphological effects.\nFor studies at an early developmental stage (< 2 dpf), dechorionate the embryos manually using sharp forceps. Dechorionate large numbers of embryos enzymatically by adding pronase (2 mg/mL) to the egg water and incubating them for 10 min at 28 °C.\nPass the embryos periodically through a plastic Pasteur pipette to ease dechorionation. Terminate the process when the majority of embryos have emerged from their chorions by washing them several times with egg water.\nPrepare solutions for zebrafish embedding in agarose.\n\t\nPrepare an anesthesia solution by adding 4 g/L MS222 (tricaine stock solution, pH 7.0) dropwise to a Petri dish containing egg water. A dose of 50 mg/L is a recommended starting point (Figure 1A).\nPrepare a stock of low-melting agarose (0.8 - 1.5%) in egg water and aliquot it into 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Place an aliquot into a pre-heated heat block (38 - 40 °C) and let it equilibrate to the set temperature (~ 30 min; Figure 1B).",
    "Optional: For longer-term imaging (> 4 h), prepare a little agarose circle within the 35-mm glass-bottom Petri dish and allow it to set (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: This extra step was effective in avoiding any movement of the whole agarose drop with the zebrafish over longer time frames.\n\t\t\nTo do so, place ~ 300 µL of agarose along the inner circle of the glass-bottom dish to prepare a doughnut-shaped circle with a little opening in the middle in which to place the fish (step 1.5.3; Supplementary Figure 1).\nMount the zebrafish in agarose for microscopy.\n\t\nSelect 1 - 3 of the pre-screened fish for ablation and anesthetize the larvae by transferring them (using a transfer pipette) into a dish with the anesthesia solution (step 1.4.1; Figure 1C; approximately 5 min).\n\t\tNOTE: The fish are anesthetized when they show a shallow opercular movement and a decreased heart rate and no longer display a touch-evoked escape response (TEER; failure to swim away after gently touching their tail with a brush). Ensure appropriate anesthesia for the ethical treatment of the fish and to prevent twitching upon transfer into agarose or exposure to fluorescent light.\nAfter the anesthesia is confirmed, suck up a larva using an adjustable pipette (with a cut-off 200-µL tip set to ~ 30 µL) and let it sink to the bottom of the tip. Transfer the larva into preheated agarose (step 1.4.2) by releasing a drop of the liquid with the larva into the agarose (try to minimize the amount of egg water going into the agarose; Figure 1D).\nSuck up the fish surrounded by agarose. Dispense it quickly into the previously prepared glass-bottom 35-mm dish.",
    "Use a dissection microscope and a standard paint brush (long liner, size 1) to position the animal within the agarose on the side (head to the left) so that body and tail are flat (Figure 1E). If working with multiple fish, align all the fish in the dish so that they are easily located using the confocal microscope later on.\n\t\tNOTE: Quickly perform this procedure of positioning and aligning (it may require some practice, as the agarose starts to set immediately after exposure to colder temperatures).\nLeave the agarose-embedded fish for 10 - 15 min until the agarose is set firmly. Carefully top up the 35-mm Petri dish with ~ 2 mL of egg water containing tricaine (Figure 1F).\n2. Set up the Confocal Microscope and Imaging Parameters\nPlace the Petri dish with the embedded larva on the confocal microscope stage and focus on the dorsal side of the animal spinal cord (using bright field). Examine the animal under the appropriate magnification (40X) and fluorescent setting and visualize the structure of interest (e.g., fluorescence intensity of the labeled neurons or microglial movement) to confirm that all imaging parameters are as needed for subsequent ablation (Figure 2). We routinely use the 40X objective to perform our time lapse studies.\nOptional: To perform a time-lapse study for several hours, it is advisable to record a single or a few time-points prior to ablation to establish the unperturbed physiological response of the cell and its environment (e.g., microglial movement to establish baseline speed and motility).\nDetermine the thickness of the structure of interest for the UV laser ablation.",
    "Using the z-drive, verify the top and bottom of the structure of interest (e.g., the cell soma) by manually focusing up and down. Note down the z-plane that will be ablated (e.g., the center of the cell).\n\t\tNOTE: From experience, this method was most effective by targeting spinal cord neurons that were brightly labeled (a high signal-to-noise ratio that allows easy time-lapse visualization after ablation; e.g., Figure 4) and by ablating the middle of the cell soma. Cell nucleus fluorescence can be of advantage to assure correct targeting and high ablation efficiency.\n3. Perform Targeted Laser Ablation of Individual Cells in the Zebrafish Spinal Cord\nNOTE: For this ablation and visualization approach, a confocal microscope (Leica SP5) was used. The ablation procedure using a 405-nm diode for cell-specific destruction is detailed according to the software (Leica Application Suite, v2.7.3.9723). However, any conventional confocal microscope that is equipped with a 405-nm laser and a FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) or bleach module will allow the performance of the same cell manipulations, but potentially with slightly different settings, parameters, and names.\nStart the FRAP wizard by clicking on the dropdown menu at the top of the software menu (Figure 3A, 1 and 2). Observe a new window with different steps that allows the set up of the specific parameters for the laser ablation (Figure 3B, 3).\nDetermine the image parameters for the ablation approach by selecting the format, scan speed (Figure 3B, 4), and averaging (Figure 3B, 5). An image format of 1,024 x 1,024 at a scan speed of 400 Hz and a line average of 4 was most applicable.\n\tNOTE: There is generally no need to change the spectral detection (such as the excitation or emission parameters), as they have been determined in the previous acquisition.",
    "If the z-plane for ablation hasn't already been selected (as described in step 2.4.), press the \"Live\" button and focus through the specimen until the fluorescent structure or the desired z-plane that is going to be ablated is in focus.\nOnce the general image parameters are set, access the \"Bleach\" step (Figure 3C, 6) to control the specific ablation components.\n\tNOTE: A combination of the laser intensity (Figure 3C, 8), the scan speed, and the averaging that has been set in step 3.2 (Figure 3B, 4 and 5), as well as the number of repetitions that will be set in step 3.5 (Figure 3E, 12), will determine the overall dwell time of the UV laser at the ROI, and therefore, the bleaching efficiency.\n\t\nEngage the 405-nm laser by activating it for the bleaching procedure (Figure 3C, 8).\n\t\tNOTE: Most success with the aforementioned settings was achieved with 405-nm laser intensities between 60 - 80% in our experimental setup. Be aware that this laser power output is instrument-specific and will differ for every confocal setup.\nUse the \"zoom in\" option (Figure 3C, 7) to maximize the bleaching intensity at the selected ROI by reducing the scan field, therefore maximizing dwell time. Alternatively, use the \"Bleach point\" option of the software of choice for this process.\nSelect one or multiple ROIs (Figure 3D, 10) for the ablation by using any of the drawing tools in the image acquisition window (Figure 3D, 9). Target the axon hillock, for example, with the circular drawing tool of approximately 4 - 8 µm.\n\tNOTE: The ablation area is adjustable from a single pixel to a larger area, depending on the application.",
    "After establishing the ROI, select the \"Time Course\" button (Figure 3E, 11) and confirm the number of cycles the ROIs will be scanned/ablated (Figure 3E, 12). Choose the \"Pre-Bleach\" and \"Post-Bleach\" frames as desired to permit an overview of the whole image just before and immediately after the bleaching process.\nAfter establishing all the necessary ablation parameters, press \"Run Experiment\" (Figure 3E, 13) and monitor the efficiency of the ablation.\n\tNOTE: In our FRAP setup, a single image will be taken before and after the FRAP cycle with the appropriate laser excitation (e.g., 488-nm excitation for EGFP-expressing cells). These pre- and post-ablation pictures allow a quick judgment of how satisfactorily the ROI was bleached and how effective the chosen ablation parameters were.\nRepeat the process by adjusting the laser intensity (Figure 3C, 8), scan speed and averaging (Figure 3B, 4 and 5), and repetitions (Figure 3E, 12) in case the selected ROI still shows high fluorescence intensity after completion of the FRAP cycle.\n4. Perform the Follow-up Procedure, Including Fish \"Rescue\" or Disposal\nIf the experiment is terminal, euthanize the animal with an overdose of tricaine. Remove the egg water and replace it with anesthesia stock solution for 10 min. To ensure euthanasia, check under the microscope for the cessation of the heartbeat.\nOptional: If the experiment is not terminal, remove the fish carefully from the agarose with fine forceps and a brush. Place the fish in fresh egg water and allow it to recover under observation for 15 min. If normal swimming behavior returns, return the fish to the incubator.\nDispose transgenic animals according to the institution's approved GMO waste stream."
