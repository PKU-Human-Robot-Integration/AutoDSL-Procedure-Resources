    "The present study was performed with approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University. TPO-cre/ERT2; BrafCA/wt; Trp53Δex2-10/Δex2-10 transgenic mice10 were used in this study (see Table of Materials). The protocol steps can be modified for different animal species if necessary. Twelve mice, including six females and six males, with a mean age of 93 days, were used here.\n1. Experimental preparation\nTurn on the ultrasonography system (see Table of Materials) and create a new folder for capturing the images and collecting the data. Select the 40 MHz line probe and click on superficial tissue pattern to activate the superficial tissue transducer. Use the \"B-mode\" for thyroid imaging (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: B-mode is the basic ultrasound imaging mode. The appearance of ultrasound images relies on the physical interactions of sound with the tissues in the body. B-mode images are produced as gray images11,12.\nKeep the mice in specific cages with free access to food and water. Place the cage on a supplemental heating device (see Table of Materials) to ensure thermoregulation.\nEnsure sufficient isoflurane in the vaporizer and O2 in the tank. If the supplies are inadequate, exchange the tanks for new ones.\nClean the animal imaging platform with sterile saline and switch on the heating button. Verify that the temperature is 38-40 °C before placing the animal on the platform (Figure 1C).\n2. Animal preparation for imaging\nSwitch on the isoflurane vaporizer. Transfer the mouse from the cage to the anesthetic box.\nAnesthetize the animal using a mixture of 1%-2% of isoflurane from the vaporizer and oxygen flowing at 0.8 L/min.\nApply depilatory cream from the chest to the neck, wait 30 secs, and then wipe away the cream and fur completely. Thoroughly rinse the area and surrounding fur with warm sterile saline.",
    "Place the anesthetized animal on the heated platform. Cover the snout with a nose cone connected to the anesthesia outlet (Figure 2A, B).\n\tNOTE: The mouse must be completely sedated within 1-2 min. If the animal is still active, perform prolonged isoflurane induction until the animal no longer shows a pedal withdrawal reflex. Ensure that the animal is breathing stably.\nDuring imaging, monitor the heart rate of the mouse through the heated platform.\n\tNOTE: The ultrasonography imaging system is equipped with a heart rate monitor.\nUse adhesive tape to fix the mouse's limbs to the heated platform, with the animal in a supine position. Ensure that the nose cone is stably positioned with a constant anesthetic gas flow (1.5 L/min).\nProtect the eyes by applying ophthalmic ointment.\n3. Tumor imaging\nAdjust the imaging system to optimize the resolution. Set up the following parameters: two-dimensional gain, 25-30 dB; image depth, 10 mm; number of focal zones, 3; and center, 3-6 mm.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, a 40 MHz probe was used. The B-mode was specified for data acquisition.\nLiberally apply ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) to the area of bare skin.\nHold the probe and place it into contact with the ultrasound gel on the chest, and then scan from the chest toward the neck to locate the thyroid (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Apply pressure gently while scanning; excessive pressure on the animal's neck may cause gasping or apnea. This protocol was developed based on handheld scanning, but mechanized scanning can also be performed using a machine to guide the probe, such as an animal imaging platform that moves along the x- and y-axes.\nScan up and down to identify the tumor's boundaries and assess its size and shape.",
    "NOTE: A healthy thyroid usually appears as a hypoechogenic, homogeneous structure in front of the trachea. Anaplastic tumors cause the thyroid to appear much larger, which can easily be identified by neck scanning (Figure 3).\nIdentify the ATC tumors from the trachea and strap muscles depending on the anatomical location and ultrasound echo.\n\tNOTE: The strap muscles are located in front of the thyroid and trachea, as well as behind the thyroid. The ultrasound echo of the strap muscles appears higher than that of the ATC, while attenuation exists behind the trachea13.\n\t\nBased on the impression of the total tumor, confirm the image section with the largest left-to-right tumor diameter. Press the freeze button, and measure the anteroposterior and left-to-right tumor diameters using the ultrasound caliper.\n\t\tNOTE: The anteroposterior diameter must be measured perpendicularly to the left-to-right tumor diameter (Figure 4). The tumor size of the ATC was calculated by multiplying the anteroposterior diameter by the left-to-right tumor diameter14. As the size of the tumors on the left and right sides was inconsistent, each side of the tumors was calculated separately. The total size of the tumors was obtained by adding the bilateral tumors. The sizes were recorded to observe the growth curve of the ATC.\nSave the recording as a cine loop, which facilitates the review of the selected images.\n4. Animal recovery\nAfter scanning, wipe the ultrasound gel and remove the restraining tape from the animal's limbs.\nPlace the mouse on the supplemental heating device (step 1.2). Lay the animal on its side (Figure 2D).\nAfter the mouse recovers (~5 min), transfer it back to the cage.\nClean the ultrasonography system, probe, and platform using a soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol or glutaraldehyde wipes.\nTurn off the imaging system.\nSubscription Required.
