Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nCentrifuge (10 min, 10,000 × g, 20°C) to pellet the bacterial cells.\nPause point: The bacterial cells can be resuspended in ethanol solution I and stored at −30°C for up to 24 h. Centrifuge (10 min, 10,000 × g, 20°C) to pellet the bacterial cells and wash twice with 1 mL of PBS prior to step 171.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS to the bacterial cell pellets and resuspend by pipetting.\nAcquire images using a fluorescence microscope.\nNote: Frame size: 960 × 720.\nNote: Fluorescence filter: 560/40 nm excitation, 630/75 nm emission (BZ-X filter TexasRed).\nNote: Objective lens: PlanApo_λ 100 × H 1.45/0.13 mm, silicone oil-immersion.
