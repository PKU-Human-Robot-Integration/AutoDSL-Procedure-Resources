    "NOTE: This protocol was optimized for 70%–80% confluent MDA-MB-231 cells. For other cell lines, the number of cells and multiplicity of infection (MOI) should be reoptimized.\n1. Preparation of cells (day 1)\nMaintain MDA-MB-231 cell line in 75 cm2 flasks with 10 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.\n\tNOTE: DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 37 °C, and a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere are used for all attachment and treatment incubations throughout the entire protocol.\nPrepare the MDA-MB-231 cells for experiment.\n\t\nAspirate the medium within the flask, detach the cells with 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 2 min, and inactivate the trypsin activity with 6 mL of complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS). Centrifuge the cells at 150 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and suspend the cells in 5 mL of complete medium.\nMix an equal volume cell suspension and 0.4% trypan blue. Take 10 µL of this mixture and count the cells with the automated cell counter.\n\t\tNOTE: A Coulter counter or a hemocytometer can also be used for cell counting.\nSeed the cells into a 6 well plate for flow cytometry analyses and seed 150,000 cells in 1 mL of medium per well. Wait 16 h for cell attachment.\nSeed the cells into a 4 well chamber slide for fluorescent imaging and seed 25,000 cells in 0.5 mL of medium per well. Wait 16 h for cell attachment.",
    "NOTE: Seed control wells in addition to treatment wells. Use one of the control wells to determine cell number (optional: if the attachment period for the cells is shorter than the doubling time, cell number can be assumed to be the same as the seeding density) and the other for a noninfected control (0 MOI).\n2. Adenoviral roGFP transduction (day 2 and 3)\nCAUTION: Adenoviruses can cause diseases. While transducing the cells, use filtered tips and decontaminate tips, Pasteur pipettes, and microcentrifuge tubes with 10% bleach.\nNOTE: This protocol was demonstrated with cytosol-specific roGFP, but other cellular compartments (e.g., mitochondria or mitochondrial intermembrane space) can be targeted with this same protocol.\nGenerate a dose-response curve for the MOI to obtain the highest transduction efficiency by calculating the volume of adenovirus (mL) required for each MOI value for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Table 1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61229/61229equ01.jpg\n\tNOTE: Functional titer of each batch of adenoviral stock, which is expressed as plaque forming unit (PFU) per mL, is provided by the company. The optimum MOI for transduction differs between cell types. For most mammalian cells, the optimum MOI range is between 10 and 300. According to the cellular response, MOI values should be recalculated (e.g., MOI range should be reduced if cells have cytotoxic response, or range should be increased if cells have low transduction efficiency).\nMake 1:100 dilution of 6 x 1010 PFU/mL adenoviral roGFP solution with cell culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) for reliable pipetting.\nPipette and add 0.0125 mL (12.5 µL), 0.025 mL (25 µL), 0.05 mL (50 µL) of adenoviral roGFP dilution into each well of the 6 well plate in order to transduce the 150,000 cells with 50, 100, and 200 MOI respectively for flow cytometry analysis (Table 1).",
    "Pipette and add 0.0042 mL (4.2 µL) of adenoviral roGFP dilution in the 4-chamber slide wells to transduce 25,000 cells with 100 MOI for fluorescence imaging (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: A minimal amount of medium should be used in the wells to ensure the highest interaction between the adenoviral roGFP construct and cells. The serum content of the culture medium may need to be decreased for different cell lines because high levels of serum can negatively affect transduction efficiency in some cell types.\nIncubate cells for 16–24 h under the cell maintenance conditions. The next day (day 3), change the medium to cell culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) to allow cell recovery for an additional 24 h. Visualize cells under a microscope to assess their morphology; cells can express roGFP even if they have morphological changes.\n\tNOTE: On day 3, cells should start to express roGFP; therefore, transduction efficiency can be monitored using fluorescence microscopy (filters with ex. 488/em. 525). To obtain consistent assay results, be aware of and document the morphological changes under the phase contrast microscope and observe morphology while evaluating transduction efficiency.\nConstruct a dose response curve using the 50, 100 and 200 MOI samples prepared in step 2.3 and their transduction efficiency results obtained from flow cytometry analysis (steps 3.1 and 4.1). Assess optimal transduction efficiency with documentation of morphological changes (step 2.5) and the dose-response curve of MOI.\n\tNOTE: Although more than 98% of the cell population at 100 MOI and 200 MOI express roGFP (see representative results), 200 MOI group showed substantial changes in cell morphology of MDA-MB-231 cells. Consequently, the most efficacious MOI for MDA-MB-231 cells was determined to be 100 MOI.",
    "After optimal MOI (here, 100 MOI) was chosen for MDA-MB-231 cell line, conduct experiment with test materials (10 µM H2O2 and its vehicle 0.1% deionized water).\n\t\nPrepare and seed the cells according to section 1. Using the adenoviral transduction volume for 100 MOI calculated in step 2.1, repeat steps 2.2−2.4 for 100 MOI adenoviral transduction of cells. Then incubate the plate and chamber slides according to step 2.5.\n3. Acquisition of CyS/CySS balance\nFlow cytometry (day 4)\n\t\nOn day 4, incubate cells from step 2.7.1 with 10 µM H2O2 for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: 10 µM H2O2 was used as the test substance and 0.1% deionized water was used as vehicle treatment in this protocol. Other oxidizing agents can be used as positive controls here.\nAspirate media from the 6 well plate, replace with 750 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and wait for 2 min for cells to detach. Inactivate trypsin with 2 mL of complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) and collect the volume into 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 150 x g for 5 min at 4ºC. Discard supernatant and suspend the cells in 500 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nRepeat step 3.1.3\nFilter the cell suspensions into flow cytometry-compatible tubes using 40 µm mesh. Keep the tubes on ice and away from the light and follow step 4.1 for data analysis.\nMicroscopic imaging (day 4)\n\t\nOn day 4, treat cells with 10 µM H2O2, acquire images immediately (time point 0) and 1 h after treatment and follow step 4.2 for data analysis.\n4. Data analysis\nFlow cytometry quantification",
    "Set flow cytometry method for 3 different analyses via sample aquisition software (see Table of Materials): forward scatter (FCS) on x-axis and side scatter (SSC) on y-axis to assess cell size and complexity of cells (SSC can be used for rough identification of dead and live cells); ex. 488 nm/em. 525 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]) bandpass filter on x-axis and SSC on y-axis to assess CyS-roGFP; ex. 405 nm/em. 525 nm (Brilliant Violet 510 [BV510]) bandpass filter on x-axis and SSC on y-axis to assess CySS-roGFP.\nAcquire 0 MOI control and visualize cells with sample acquisition software. Repeat this step for remaining samples (50, 100, 200 MOI groups and later on 10 µM H2O2 treated cells and vehicle treated cells). Save the files for data analysis.\nOpen data analysis software (see Table of Materials) and open 0 MOI sample file. Assess cell population of interest (Gate 1). Set up the following gatings to minimize background fluorescence for ex. 488 nm/em. 525 nm (Gate 2) and ex. 405 nm/em. 525 nm (Gate 3) bandpass filters with the noninfected (0 MOI) control cells.\nOpen 50, 100, and 200 MOI sample files within data analysis software to assess the dose-response curve. Analyze mean fluorescence intensities with Gates 2 and 3 for each sample. Repeat this step for test samples (10 µM H2O2 treated cells and vehicle treated cells).\nCalculate the mean fluorescent intensity ratio between oxidized versus reduced forms of roGFP with the following equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61229/61229equ02.jpg\nImage assessment\n\t\nUse a microscope that contains fluorescence filters for CyS-roGFP and CySS-roGFP (ex. 488 nm/em. 525 nm and ex. 405 nm/em. 525 nm filters, respectively).\nIn each well of the chamber slide, pick 4 random areas to acquire images, using the 4x objective to visualize larger areas.",
    "NOTE: 20x objective can also be used for image displays.\nOpen the image with ImageJ software11. Apply Analyze | Measure commands for each image and use the equation in step 4.1.5 to quantify the data.\n\t\tNOTE: Quantification of the images is ratiometric; therefore, the protocol does not include subtraction of background. However, to be able to compare images, brightness, contrast, and saturation must be the same for each image. Statistical significance was assessed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
