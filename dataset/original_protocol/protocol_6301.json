    "Liver perfusion and isolation (Figure 1 and Video 1)Pool the livers from 4 mice for setting up HSC isolation and culture. Euthanize 1-2 mice at a time according to a method approved in your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Protocol. After confirming death, cut the mouse skin along the midline from the abdomen to the thoracic cavity. Cut the diaphragm, effectively exposing the visceral organs (Figures 1A and 1B).Gently move the liver lobes where the diaphragm was cut and then move the intestine to your right side to expose the inferior vena cava (Figure 1C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029030157_0377.jpgFigure 1. Stepwise depiction of mouse liver perfusion. A. Position the mouse for dissection. B. Expose the visceral organs and cut the diaphragm. C. Gently move the intestine to the right side. D. Inject 1x HBSS via the Hepatic portal vein. E. Cut the Inferior vena cava (IVC). F. Wash with 1x HBSS. G. Remove the gall bladder. H. Dissect out the liver.Fill a 10 ml syringe with ice cold HBSS and use a 27G needle to inject this HBSS into the hepatic portal vein to perfuse the liver (Figure 1D). Immediately cut off the inferior vena cava (IVC) to release the pressure, once you begin washing with HBSS via the portal vein (Figures 1E and 1F).Use at least 10 ml HBSS to wash each liver. Note: Euthanizing 1-2 mice at a time helps preserve tissue integrity and leads to efficient flushing of the livers resulting in a cleaner HSC preparation. Gently cut off the gall bladder amidst the liver lobes taking care to avoid puncturing it (Figure 1G).Collect the lobes of the liver in a 30 ml universal container with 10 ml ice cold HBSS (Figure 1H).Proceed to enzymatic digestion.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Mouse liver perfusion.",
    "This video was made at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland according OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Protocol guidelines and approved by the Department of Comparative Medicine.Enzymatic digestionUnder a sterile culture hood, drain the HBSS from the universal containing the livers. Mince the livers in the same 30 ml universal container using sterile scissors and forceps (sprayed with 70% ethanol) and add 10 ml of Collagenase B and 10 ml of Pronase to the minced livers. Note: Pre-warm the Collagenase B and Pronase for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath.  Add 2 ml DNase 1 solution to prevent clumping of cells. Mix the contents well by inverting the tube 3-4 times and place the universal in an incubator-shaker at 37 °C for 20 min.Pour the digest through a 70 μm cell strainer for collection into a 50 ml tube. Use the flat side of a 10 ml syringe plunger to gently press and force the liver digest from the cell strainer into the 50 ml tube and top up with cold HBSS to stop the enzymatic reaction.Centrifuge at 600 x g (around 1,800 rpm for a benchtop centrifuge), at room temperature for 7 min. Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4 °C for the density gradient step.Assembling the density gradient (Figure 2)For the bottom-most layer of the gradient, add 3.2 ml Optiprep to 4.8 ml HBSS. Split the 8 ml into two 15 ml tubes.For the intermediate phase, homogenize the cell pellet from Step B6 by gently tapping the 50 ml tube at the base and add HBSS to make the total volume 8.9 ml. Add 5.9 ml of Optiprep to the 8.9 ml cell pellet resuspended in HBSS. Mix using a 10 ml pipette.",
    "Using a 5 ml pipette, gently add an equal volume dropwise on top of the 4 ml bottom phase to each 15 ml tube using the slowest setting on the pipette-aid. The volume in each 15 ml tube should be around 10.5-11 ml combining both phases. Finally, for the top phase, gently add 0.5 ml HBSS over the intermediate phase. Centrifuge the two 15 ml tubes at 1,400 x g (around 2,500 rpm) for 20 min at 4 °C without break and at a slow acceleration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029030140_5013.jpgFigure 2. Density gradient pre and post centrifugation. A depiction of the layers before centrifugation (left) and after centrifugation (right). The isolated pericytes localize at the phase between the top layered HBSS and the middle layer containing the cell pellet homogenized with HBSS and Optiprep.Washing and platingThe HSCs are in the second layer from the top, beneath the HBSS and appearing as a thick white band. Gently remove this layer comprising about 0.5 to 1 ml, using a 1 ml micropipette, from each 15 ml tube and put in a new 50 ml tube. Tap and mix cells and add 2 ml DNase. Top up with HBSS up to 50 ml and spin down at 600 x g for 7 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and mix the pellet. Add 3 ml of RBC lysis buffer and incubate at 37 °C for 4-5 min.Add 2 ml DNase solution to prevent clumping of cells. Wash with HBSS and spin down at 600 x g for 7 min.Aspirate the HBSS, mix the pellet and resuspend in about 10 ml prewarmed complete DMEM (see Recipes).Plate 10 ml of the cell suspension in a 100 mm plate or in a T75 flask as preferred. The preparation looks messy immediately after isolation.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 environment.After 24 h, gently rotate the plate in the palm of your hand to displace the thick sticky layer. To obtain a clear preparation, aspirate the media and wash 3-4 times with 3 ml warm PBS. Resuspend in complete DMEM or proceed to trypsinization to set up a new experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029030129_0856.jpgFigure 3. Representative image of HSCs 24 h post isolation. Isolated HSCs cultured in 100 mm plates were washed with warm PBS and imaged on the Zeiss primovert at 10x magnification. The blue arrows indicate the adhered HSCs. Scale bar = 200 µm.About 2-2.5 x 105 HSCs can be obtained by this method.TrysinizationTrypsinization of HSCs during the early stages after first wash is a delicate process. After 3 washes with pre-warmed PBS, add 3 ml trypsin and incubate at 37 °C for 4 min with pipetting up and down about 5 times during the incubation. Stop the reaction with ice cold HBSS and spin down at 600 x g for 7 min to count cells and re-plate them. For trypsinization at later stages, incubate for 5-6 min and proceed in a similar way.ValidationLet the HSCs isolated using the optiprep method to adhere overnight. After 24 h, wash, trypsinize and analyze the cells using flow cytometry (Figure 4). Since Pdgfrb is a prominent marker of HSCs (Henderson et al., 2013), we used Pdgfrb-BAC-eGFP reporter mice to validate Pdgfrb-eGFP expressing cells alongside cells isolated from WT C57BL/6 mice used as a negative control. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029030116_3492.jpgFigure 4.

    "As an additional validation of HSC differentiation, we cultured the isolated cells in complete DMEM for 5 days and harvested the samples intermittently for the analysis of Acta2 gene expression (Figure 5). Alpha smooth muscle actin (Acta2) is a reliable marker of HSC differentiation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029030106_2764.jpgFigure 5.
