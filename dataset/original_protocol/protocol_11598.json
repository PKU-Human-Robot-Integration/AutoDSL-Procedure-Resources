    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Tel-Aviv University Helsinki human research ethics committee.\n1. Word Selection and Matching \nCreate lists of words for each word category of interest. For example, make lists of generally emotional words (e.g., HATE, POX), concern relevance words (e.g., RAPE, VICTIM), and neutral words that are preferably orthographic neighbors21 of the emotional/concern relevant words (e.g., GATE, BOX). Create lists with as many words as possible as not all of these words will be used; a smaller subset of matched words will later be selected. \n\t\nWhen deemed necessary, verify the valence/emotionality/arousal of the words by a questionnaire rating the words on a rating scale (e.g., from 1 to 7). Attempt to select words that are at the extreme end of the scale. If comparing emotional words with positive words, attempt to include words that are matched on (absolute) emotionality and arousal scores.\nWrite for each word on the lists, its length in characters as well as its estimated frequency in the appropriate language (for English words, use log hyperspace analogue to language (HAL) frequency22) in order to match the word lists on lexical factors.\n\tNOTE: This is important as these variables can also affect color naming latency (e.g., 21, 23). Arguably, the most important lexical attributes to control are word frequency, length, and if possible orthographic neighborhood (which naturally intersect with length).\n\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\n,Emotional,,,Neutral,\nWord,Length,Frequency,Word,Length,Frequency\nhate,4,10.7,gate,4,9.7\ndead,4,11.2,dear,4,10.29\npoor,4,10.9,pool,4,9.7\nsnake,5,8.6,shake,5,8.6\ngloom,5,8.1,bloom,5,8.2\nbomb,4,9.64,comb,4,7.39\npox,3,7.1,box,3,12.1\n,,,,,\nAverage,4.1,9.4,Average,4.1,9.4\nTable1: Example of a List of Words Matched on Length, Orthographic Neighborhood, and Average Frequency.\nSelect words by adding pairs each time that match in length and frequency, and that are orthographic neighbors of one another (for example replace one of the emotional word letters with another to form a neutral orthographic neighbor, (see Table 1).",
    "If a complete match is not possible, balance the bias of frequency in the subsequent pairs of words by adding a pair of words with a small gap in frequency in the opposite direction of the gap formed by the previous pair of words. Ensure that the final lists of matched words contain 20 - 50 words in each word category in order to have a minimum of 20 trials in a block to collect sufficient data and avoid repetition of words and hence habituation3.\n\t\tNOTE: If many words are difficult to obtain, it is possible to introduce some repetition of words. However try to keep repetitions to a minimum as it may dilute the ESE due to habituation3.\nCheck that the final list is matched as much as possible on all lexical variables (e.g., word frequency, word length). Perform a statistical validation (student's t-test) to confirm that the final lists do not differ significantly from each other on frequency.\n2. Preparation of Experimental Design\nSelect the design: Blocked (the stimuli are presented in separate blocks of trials defined by word valence) or mixed (the stimuli are presented in one block in which emotion and neutral words are intermixed in the same list).\n\t\nChoose a blocked design if seeking to test global effects at the level of the word category.\n\t\tNOTE: Effect sizes are usually higher in a blocked design than in a mixed presentation4, 5. Therefore, blocked design is often the favored method of presentation.\nChoose a mixed design if seeking to decompose the ESE at the individual word level and for \"fast\" and \"slow\" effects, as a negative item can affect not only its own naming (the ESE) but also that of the immediately following item. Consequently, the former is dubbed 'fast effect,' the latter 'slow effect'24, 25.",
    "In a blocked experimental design, select a fixed or counterbalanced/randomized order of blocks.\n\t\nFor a counterbalanced order present the two possible order of blocks to different groups of participants:\n\t\tGroup A: Neutral Block - Emotional Block\n\t\tGroup B: Emotional Block - Neutral Block\n\t\tNOTE: In this balanced design, an ESE is expected to emerge only in the group performing in the first order due to sustained effects in the group performing in the second order (see Figure 4)3. We therefore suggest using a fixed presentation of blocks.\nFor a fixed order of blocks present first the neutral block then the emotional block, and if desired present an additional new neutral block flowing the emotional block in order to examine sustained effects: Neutral Block 1 - Emotional Block - Neutral Block 2.\n\t\tNOTE: In this setup, two effects can be observed. The first is the canonical ESE, calculated as the difference in performance between the emotional block and the first neutral block. A second is a sustained effect, obtained by subtracting the mean latency of the second neutral block from that of the first neutral block. A positive difference indicates the presence of sustained effects brought about by the emotional block.\n\t\t\nIn order to rule out confounding through training or fatigue, advisably perform an auxiliary experiment with several blocks of neutral items only.\n\t\t\tNOTE: With three blocks of 40 neutral words, no residual fatigue is expected (see Figure 3)3. If there are more than 40 words per block, or more experimental blocks, it may be necessary to control for effects of fatigue by counterbalancing block order (but check for order-of-blocks effects in the statistical analysis).\n3. Experimental Programing and Randomization\nChoose a computer software or programing language to serve as a vehicle to present the stimuli and measure the participant's responses.",
    "Optionally, use the commercially available DirectRT software which is relatively easy to deploy and reliable. See Supplemental Code File for a DirectRT executable excel file as an example for a typical programed ESE experiment. Some additional software packages are SuperLab and E-prime, which are also suitable alternatives for governing the experiment.\nSelect the method of responding: manual or oral. Both types of responding are appropriate.\n\t\nFor keyboard activated responding, use a longer training session in order for the participant to learn the mapping of keys onto the ink colors (of about 20 - 40 trials).\nFor vocal responding use a shorter training session (of 4 - 8 trials). Set the reaction time to be measured from the outset of the stimulus to the first phoneme said.\n\t\tNOTE: Vocal responses pose difficulties at the stage of deciphering the responses (one must listen to the recordings and classify errors). However, a new algorithm that mechanically classifies the vocal recordings can render actual human classification gratuitous26. An advantage of oral responses is that the resulting auditory files can be further analyzed (via other dedicated programs) for vocal parameters associated with emotion3.\nChoose the ink-colors to be assigned to the words (e.g., the colors blue, green, red, and purple). Use easily discriminable colors against a well contrasted background (e.g., white or grey). If key-press responding is used, use no more than 4 colors, so that the mapping of colors to the keys is easily mastered.\n\tNOTE: If vocal responding is used, it is possible to use many more colors. Recall though that with a computer algorithm to classify the data, voice-identification errors increase with the number of colors (= responses).\nUse an easily legible font, and size for the words.",
    "Since the preferred approach is to use no repetition of words, assign to each word a single color randomly by the computer program for every participant.\nPresent each word singly around the middle of the computer screen. Optionally, introduce a small amount of spatial uncertainty, so that each word is presented in a random different position approximately 50 pixels around the center (e.g., see Supplemental Code File). This is done in order to discourage participants focusing on a small section of the word (thus circumventing reading).\nPrepare a short training block to familiarize the participant with the task and the stimuli. For vocal responding, a few trials using the word 'example' in each of the experimental colors may suffice (with computerized identification of data, a whole session is needed to train the voice-identification algorithm); for key-press responding, as many as 20 - 40 trials may be necessary to master the mapping of the colors.\nFollowing training, present the experimental blocks (e.g., three blocks of neutral-emotional and neutral words). Introduce short breaks between successive blocks of trials (of say, 30-60 seconds each). Do not allow the next block to begin before the designated interval for the break has elapsed as participants tend to rush through the experiment in order to finish it quickly.\nPrepare the task instructions. At the start of each block, present the following instruction 'Respond to the ink color of the word as quickly and accurately as possible.' Avoid mentioning word reading, or that the word should be ignored as this request may artificially augment reading the words (see ironic process theory, e.g., 27).\nSpecify the inter-trial or inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between experimental trials of a stimulus and the successive stimulus. Typically use an ISI of 500 msec (in blocked presentation).",
    "NOTE: Short ISI may promote shorter responses than longer ISI and carry over-effects with emotion items have been reported for ISI up to 1,000 msec24.\nOptional: Add an anxiety questionnaire at the end of the experiment or in a separate session. This provides for a baseline measure of the participant's anxiety, such as the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI)28.\n4. Subject Selection and Preparation\nOnce programing is completed, recruit participants preferably from the same age-group and background. Participants can enroll for course credit, for pay, or on a voluntary basis.\nMake sure participants are native speakers of the language used in the study, and do not have any attention deficits or color blindness.\nGuide the participant to a quiet room in front of a computer. Explain the task instructions and ask the participant to read additional instructions written on the computer screen.\n5. Data and Statistical Analysis\nAs a rule, perform reaction time analyses with respect to correct responses only. Also, exclude extreme responses.\n\t\nTypically, exclude responses faster or smaller than 2.5 SD around the mean. Nevertheless, be careful not to discard more than 5% of the data. Error rates are typically small, but it is still advisable to compare them across conditions and rule out a speed-accuracy tradeoff.\nWith a fixed presentation order, perform planned comparisons (or a student's t-test, if only two blocks are administered) with a designated statistical software such as SPSS or STATISTICA (here instructions are given for STATISTICA). For testing of the ESE, compare the emotion block with the first neutral block. For sustained effects compare the second neutral block (which followed the emotional block) with the first neutral block.\n\t\nPerform planned comparisons by choosing -Statistics->Advanced Linear/Non-Linear Models->General Linear Models->More results -> Planed comps.",
    "When the order of blocks is counterbalanced across participants, perform an ANOVA with Block Valence as a within-subject factor and Order of Blocks as a between-subject factor.\n\t\nPerform ANOVA by choosing -Statistics->Advanced Linear/Non-Linear Models->General Linear Models.\nSubscription Required.
