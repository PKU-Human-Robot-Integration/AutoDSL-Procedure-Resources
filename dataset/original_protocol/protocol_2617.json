    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nObtain immune cells from mouse pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes\nTiming: 6 h\nThese steps include how to separate immune cells from whole pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes and stimulate them with PMA and Ionomycin.\nTo isolate immune cell from whole pancreas\nEuthanize mouse and open abdominal cavity.\nIdentify the pancreas (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, outline) and harvest it by careful dissection into a 60 mm culture dish containing 3 mL HBSS buffer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2274-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Identification of pancreas and location of the pancreatic lymph node in the abdominal cavity of a 10-week-old female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse\n(A) Image showing general location and appearance of pancreas (dotted black outline).\n(B) Image showing general location and appearance of pancreatic lymph node (dotted black circle).\n(C) Higher magnification image showing location and appearance of the pancreatic lymph node (dotted black circle). LI: large intestine, S: spleen, K: kidney.\nScale bar = 2 mm.\nNote: Fat and spleen tissue must be removed. These tissues also contain lymphocytes and will impact the results.\nTransfer pancreas into a 15 mL tube and add 3 mL collagenase P digestion media. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min on an orbital shaker at 240 rpm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2274-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Appearance of single cells from the digested pancreas of a 10-week-old female NOD mouse\n(A and B) Two fields of view showing examples of single cells following collagenase P digestion of the pancreas.\n(C) Example of underdigested cells.\n(D) Example of over digested cells.\nScale bar = 200 μm.\nCritical: Tissue should not be over-digested to ensure high cell viability (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Prepare a single cell suspension (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) by drawing up digested tissue into a 5 or 10 mL syringe and gently passing through an 18G needle into a new 15 mL tube.\nTop off with 5 mL HBSS containing 10% FBS to inactivate collagenase P.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 450 × g for 5 min at room temperature (15°C–25°C) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 3 mL PBS + 2% FBS, and filter suspended cells through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nPipette 3 mL Histopaque 1077 into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nTo isolate lymphocytes from other cells of the pancreas, slowly and gently layer the suspended cells from the cell strainer of step 7 on top of Histopaque 1077.\nCritical: Do not allow Histopaque 1077 and pancreatic cell layers to mix, as this will adversely affect the yield and purity of isolated lymphocytes.\nCentrifuge tube at 900 × g for 20 min at room temperature in a swinging bucket rotor with the centrifuge brake turned off.\nCarefully collect the middle buffy layer (containing lymphocytes) and transfer to a new 15 mL tube with 3 mL RPMI containing 10% FBS.\nWash the cells by adding 5 mL RPMI containing 10% FBS and pellet cells by centrifugation at 450 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 12.\nResuspend the cells in 500 μL of Immune cell culture media.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer.\nTransfer 10 μL cell suspension into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCombine with 90 μL trypan blue, mixing well with a pipette.\nLoad 10 μL of this mixture into a hemocytometer.\nCount the cells and calculate the total number of cells per sample.\nTo isolate immune cells from pancreatic lymph node",
    "Remove the pancreatic lymph nodes (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C) and place in a 35 mm culture dish containing 2 mL cold RPMI media (no FBS).\nPress the pancreatic lymph nodes through a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube using the plunger from a syringe.\nRinse the cell strainer with 5 mL RPMI media (no FBS) and centrifuge the cell suspension at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer, and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nAdd 10 mL PBS containing 2% FBS and centrifuge at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 mL Immune cell culture media.\nPerform cell count using a hemocytometer and assess viability with trypan blue.\nStimulate lymphocytes with PMA and ionomycin\nTransfer an appropriate number of cells (1 × 106–3 × 106) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate.\nAdd 100 μL PMA, Ionomycin, and Golgi Stop media.\nIncubate the plate for 4 h at 37°C under 5% CO2.\nNote: Stimulation can be skipped if not staining for cytokines (steps 23–25).\nCell staining\nTiming: 20 h\nThese steps include the procedure for staining immune cells from whole pancreas and pancreatic lymph node with metal-labeled antibodies. The protocol has been adapted from the Fluidigm MaxPar Nuclear Antigen Staining Protocol with Fresh Fix.\nScrape the immune cells and transfer to a FACS tube.\nAdd 2 mL PBS into each tube and centrifuge at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 300 μL of the 5 μM Cisplatin Solution to each tube to discriminate viable cells from dead cells.",
    "Pipette to mix and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCritical: Cell staining with cisplatin for longer than 5 min causes significant cell death.\nAdd 2 mL Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer to each tube to minimize nonspecific antibody binding.\nNote: Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer contains blocking protein.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and flick the tube to disrupt the pellet.\nRepeat steps 30–31.\nDiscard the supernatant leaving behind 50 μL Maxpar Cell Staining buffer.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd 50 μL of diluted Surface marker antibody cocktail to each tube.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 2 mL Maxpar Cell Staining buffer and centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nFix the cells by adding 1 mL Maxpar Fix I buffer. Gently vortex and incubate for 10–30 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells by adding 2 mL Maxpar Perm-S buffer and centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and repeat step 41.\nNote: After fixation, cells are centrifuged at higher speeds to increase cell recovery and reduce cell loss.\nAlternatives: Instead of using Maxpar Fix Buffer, 1.6% PFA in PBS can be used to fix the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant leaving a residual volume of 50 μL. Gently vortex to resuspend cells.\nAdd 50 μL of cytoplasmic/secreted antibody cocktail to each tube for a final volume of 100 μL.\nGently vortex and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash cells by adding 2 mL Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer and centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat step 46.\nAdd 300 μL Maxpar Fix/Perm with DNA intercalator.\nVortex to mix and incubate at 4°C overnight (16–20 h).\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nAdd 2 mL Maxpar Cell Staining buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nRepeat steps 52 and 53 two more times.\nWash the cells with 2 mL Maxpar Water and centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL Maxpar Water.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nDilute 5 × 105 cells into 1 mL Maxpar Water and centrifuge the cells at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant and keep cell pellet on ice until running on a mass cytometer.\nSample acquisition\nTiming: 25 min\nThis step may differ based on the type of mass cytometer. Prior to sample acquisition, the instrument must be properly warmed up and tuned. Users should contact their service provider for detailed protocols for their specific instrument. Details below are based on using a Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm) that had been tuned and passed quality control.\nResuspend 5 × 105 (1 × 106 maximum) cells in 1 mL Maxpar Water containing 0.1× EQ4 beads within 10 min of running the sample.\nFilter cells through a 35 μm cell strainer cap into a 5 mL polypropylene tube.",
