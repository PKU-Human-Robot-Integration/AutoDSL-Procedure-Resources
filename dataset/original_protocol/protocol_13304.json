    "All participants (n = 8) provided written informed consent, and all experiments were approved by the University Human Ethics Committee; data were derived from Van Schaik et al.27.\n1. Equipment and software installation\nMeasure the fat mass via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as per Van Schaik et al.27.\nEstimate the substrate utilization and energy expenditure from expired gas; measure this using a respiratory gas analyzer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.\nCollect blood samples via finger (capillary) puncture, and determine the blood glucose levels using a glucometer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.\nUse a non-contact infrared thermometer to determine core body temperature measurements as per the manufacturer's guidelines (the error of this device is ±0.2 °C).\n2. Procedures prior to the participant visits\nScreen all the participants for their health status.\nSet the following exclusion criteria: a body mass index of >30 kg/m2 (due to BAT activity being inversely correlated with adiposity34,35, participants using prescribed medications, and diabetes mellitus.\nBefore or after the testing session, ensure that participants undergo a DXA scan to measure their fat mass, as BAT activity is inversely correlated with adiposity34,35.\nFor 24 h prior to arriving for the study, ensure that the participants abstain from any strenuous exercise or activity and are water-fasted for 10 h before arriving in the lab.\n3. Procedures on the study day\nEnsure that the room temperature at which the data are collected is set to a constant temperature to minimize external confounds due to differences in room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This can result in incorrect thermal or metabolic measurements. For the purposes of this experiment, a temperature-controlled room maintained at 22 °C under thermal neutral conditions was used.\nAsk the participants to arrive at the lab at 08:00 a.m. to account for daily hormone rhythms.\nMeasure the participants' height and weight.",
    "Ask the participants to lie on a plinth for a minimum of 30 min before the baseline measurements are taken.\nOver a 120 min period, measure the participants' IRT, indirect calorimetry, blood glucose, and core temperature every 15 min following the expired O2and CO2sampling (Figure 1).\nFollowing the baseline measurements, ensure that the participants are carbohydrate-loaded through the consumption of three carbohydrate gels (90 g glucose each) between the time points of 0 min and 15 min.\nEnsure that the participants ingest the treatment 45 min following the carbohydrate load. To follow this protocol, use 100 mg of caffeine capsules as the intervention27.\n\tNOTE: A washout period of 7 days between intervention and placebo is required, meaning a period of 7 days is required between caffeine and placebo treatment.\n4. Indirect calorimetry\nEstimate the energy expenditure and substrate utilization values from the expired gas, as measured using a respiratory gas analyzer. Complete the calibration of the respiratory gas analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.\nFit the cold-sterilized silicone mask to the participant to allow delivery of room air and the acquisition of metabolic data. Ensure that the mask is equipped with a presterilized non-rebreathing valve (two-way non-rebreathing valve) and fix it on the participant's face with a mesh attachment and check for leaks.\nEnsure that the inspiratory and expiratory tubes are connected.\nExport the digital data file in a spreadsheet format.\nSample the expired O2 and CO2with 5 s averaging. This measures the energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (Figure 1). Remove the face mask to complete the additional measures.\nCalculate the substrate oxidation rates (carbohydrate and lipid oxidation) and total energy expenditure using the non-protein Weir equations 1-331,36:\n\tFat oxidation rate (g/min−1) = (1.695 VO2)-(1.701 VCO2)   (1)\n\tCarbohydrate oxidation rate (g/min−1) = (4.585 VCO2) -(3.226 VO2)   (2)",
    "Energy Expenditure (kcal/min) = (3.94 × VO2)+ (1.1 × VCO2)   (3)\n5. Plasma blood glucose measurements\nConduct blood glucose readings via finger prick and a glucometer following each round of expired gas measurements (Figure 2).\n6. Core temperature\nRecord the core temperature (Tcore) following each round of expired gas measurements. Ideally, measure the core temperature either rectally or intra-aurally (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Owing to COVID-19 safe practices, minimize person-to-person contact.\nEnsure that the participants are supine and their head is in a neutral position. Consistently direct the non-contact thermometer toward the center of the participant's forehead.\n7. Infrared thermography\nConduct the IRT following each round of expired gas measurements (Figure 2).\nAsk the participants to sit up in an upright posture looking straight ahead, with the chest area to neck region exposed (Figure 3).\nUse a thermal imaging camera to acquire infrared images of the anterior neck and upper chest region.\n\t\nPosition the camera on a tripod at the level of the neck 1 m from the subject's face (Figure 4D). Use the following settings: detector type = uncooled microbolometer; detector pitch = 17 µm; camera spectral range = 7.5-14.0 µm; thermal sensitivity = 20 mK at 30 °C; lenses = 36 mm; resolution = 1,024 pixels x 768 pixels.\nTurn the camera on.\nAdjust the focus of the camera by rotating the focus ring.\n\t\tNOTE: It is very important to adjust the focus correctly. Incorrect focus adjustment affects the temperature measurement.\nPoint the laser pointer to the midline of the neck of the participant.\nTake the image.\n\t\tNOTE: The image will save automatically if a memory card is used.\n8. Image analysis",
    "Choose three regions of the anterior thorax and neck for the analysis of the surface temperature: bilaterally the skin overlying BAT in the supraclavicular fossa (SCF) and the lateral region of the neck, with the sternal area considered as a control reference point (Tref), as this area does not contain BAT (Figure 4A-C).\nPlace triangular regions of interest (ROIs) in the left and right SCF areas and a circular ROI over the sternal region.\nWhen the required regions have been cross-located, confirm that the software displays the average and standard deviation of the temperature for each selected region.\n9. Data analysis\nUse a double-blind approach for the analysis of the interventions using the techniques described. Have a researcher not involved in the data collection or analysis code the interventions generically.\nPerform the statistical analysis.\n\t\nCalculate averages for the IRT, core temperature, and blood glucose data from the measured single time point.\nCalculate averages for the RER, fat oxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and energy expenditure in 10 min epochs.\nFor energy expenditure, sum the rate of energy expenditure for each group, and separate it into pre- and post intervention.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to Van Shaik et al. for statistical tests to analyze the data27."
