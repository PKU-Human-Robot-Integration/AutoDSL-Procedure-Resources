    "In this protocol, we describe a typical procedure for growing C. elegans to obtain 4 to 5 ml of freeze-ground animals, which is the required starting material for our ChIP protocol (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0002]). We outline the steps to synchronize, harvest, and resuspend the worms in the appropriate buffer for subsequent use. Our overall workflow has been optimized to obtain ChIP-seq data for transcription factors or for RNA Pol II. Given that these proteins only bind to specific parts of the genome, a substantial amount of starting material is needed. In some cases, for instance, when immunoprecipitating highly expressed and broadly distributed chromatin-associated proteins like histones in certain modification states, a lesser amount of starting material might be sufficient, but we encourage users to start at the described scale when trying the protocol for the first time.\nMaterials\nStationary-phase OP50-1 Escherichia coli culture, 2-, 10-, or 50-fold concentrated and resuspended in M9 buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0008])\nWorm strain(s) of interest [created in own lab, obtained from other labs, or ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC)]\nSterile M9 buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0008]), room temperature and 4°C\nHypochlorite solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0007]; make fresh)\nM9 buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0008]) supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4 (from 1 M MgSO4 stock solution)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0011]), 4°C\nPBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0010]), 4°C\nLiquid nitrogen\nTemperature-controlled incubators, one at temperature used to grow C. elegans strain of interest (usually 20°C), one at 15°C, and one at 37°C\nWorm pick\nSterilized metal spatula\nStandard benchtop centrifuge for 15- and 50-ml centrifuge tubes (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific Megafuge 8)\n15- and 50-ml centrifuge tubes\nVortex mixer\nStereomicroscope (e.g., Olympus SZX7)\nTube rotator (e.g., Thermo Scientific Tube Revolver)\nRefrigerated benchtop centrifuge for 15- and 50-ml centrifuge tubes (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific Megafuge 40R), 4°C\n500-ml Dewar beaker",
    "Additional reagents and equipment for preparing NGM plates (6-, 10-, and 15-cm diameter; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0009])\nNOTE: All buffers used from step 25 onward for harvesting and washing the animals should be ice-cold to slow down physiological changes.\nGrowth of worms to scale and egg preparation\n1. Prepare several NGM plates (6-, 10-, and 15-cm diameter). Seed these plates with stationary-phase OP50-1 E. coli culture.\nThe exact number of required plates depends on the number of conditions and replicates that you would like to include in your ChIP experiment. However, you need at least two 6-cm plates, eleven 10-cm plates, and ten 15-cm plates.\nUse 0.15 ml of 2-fold-concentrated culture in M9 buffer for each 6-cm plate, 0.35 ml of 10-fold-concentrated culture in M9 for each 10-cm plate, and 2 ml of 50-fold-concentrated culture in M9 for each 15-cm plate.\n2. Thaw desired worm strain(s) of interest and transfer worms to one of the bacteria-seeded 6-cm NGM plates. Place plate inside a temperature-controlled incubator.\nThe desired growth temperature depends on the C. elegans strain that you are using and the conditions that you are testing. Most strains, including wild-type animals, should be grown at 20°C. This is the optimal growth temperature for C. elegans. However, some strains, e.g., those containing temperature-sensitive mutant alleles, may require a different growth temperature so that the animals grow optimally or show desired phenotypes. In such cases, growth temperatures typically range from 15° to 25°C.\n3. The next day, transfer any live worms to a fresh bacteria-seeded 6-cm NGM plate by using a worm pick. Place plate inside a temperature-controlled incubator and let it grow at desired temperature until the plate is crowded and the food runs low.",
    "This will take a few days. Although you should grow the plate until the food runs low, make sure to avoid starvation.\n4. Cut agar of the crowded plate into four pieces with a sterilized metal spatula and transfer all four of them with their worms onto a single bacteria-seeded 10-cm NGM plate. Grow until this NGM plate is crowded with unsynchronized animals and the food runs low.\nThis will take a few days.\n5. Cut agar of the crowded plate into 10 pieces, each carrying a similar number of worms, with a sterilized metal spatula. Transfer each agar piece to a separate bacteria-seeded 10-cm NGM plate and grow them at desired temperature until the plates are crowded and the food is running low.\nAlthough you should grow the plate until the food runs low, make sure to avoid starvation.\n6. Wash worms off the plates using a pipet containing 15 ml sterile M9 buffer. Collect all worm suspension into a single 50-ml centrifuge tube.\nThe exact volume of M9 used is not critical; it should just be sufficient to retrieve all worms and eggs.\n7. Distribute worm suspension across 10 bacteria-seeded 15-cm NGM plates and grow them until mostly gravid adults are present.\nThis should take 3 to 5 days depending on the worm strain and growth temperature used. Worms should be checked under the microscope daily.\n8. Wash animals off the plates using a pipet and 25 ml sterile M9 buffer per plate. Collect worm suspensions in multiple 15-ml centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge 1 min at 1500 × g at room temperature to pellet animals.\nWe suggest combining (or splitting) the tube contents so that the pellet size in each tube becomes ∼500 µl.",
    "9. For each tube, remove supernatant and resuspend animals in 10 ml sterile M9 buffer. Then, centrifuge 1 min at 1500 × g at room temperature.\n10. Repeat step 9 until all OP50-1 bacteria have been removed and supernatant is clear.\n11. For each tube, remove supernatant and resuspend worms in 7.5 ml sterile M9 buffer.\n12. For each tube, add 2.5 ml fresh hypochlorite solution and mix by vortexing.\n13. Every 30 s, briefly examine tubes under a stereomicroscope to determine whether the worm corpses have disappeared and released eggs can be seen. Continue vortexing until ≤5% of the worm corpses remain.\nThis step typically takes 5 to 6 min depending on the worm strain and the initial number of worms in the tube.\n14. Centrifuge tubes for 1 min at 1500 × g at room temperature to pellet the released eggs.\n15. Carefully discard supernatant and resuspend eggs in 10 ml sterile M9 buffer.\n16. Repeat steps 14 and 15 at least three more times. If the sample is split across several tubes, combine it into a single tube.\nMake sure to go through the first two washes quickly to remove any remaining traces of bleach as soon as possible. Remaining traces of bleach may otherwise kill the embryos over time.\n17. Centrifuge 1 min at 1500 × g at room temperature and discard supernatant.\n18. Resuspend eggs in 10 ml M9 buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4.\n19. Rotate tube containing the eggs at 10 to 12 rpm on a tube rotator for 1 day at room temperature or for 2 days at 15°C in an incubator.\nThis will lead to the animals’ hedging and their arrest as L1 larvae.\nWhile step 19 is still ongoing, proceed to step 20.\nSynchronized growth and harvest",
    "20. Prepare thirty 15-cm NGM plates and seed them with stationary-phase OP50-1 E. coli culture.\nUse 2 ml of 50-fold-concentrated culture in M9 buffer.\n21. Incubate these plates overnight at 37°C.\n22. The next day, prepare 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of the worm suspension from step 19 in sterile M9 buffer. Pipet 10 µl of the dilution onto a 6-cm NGM plate. Count worms under the stereomicroscope. Repeat this step two more times and calculate average worm number per milliliter.\nAt this point, all the worms in the suspension should be live L1 larvae.\n23. Seed each of the 30 bacteria-seeded NGM plates with 20,000 to 25,000 of these worms.\n24. Grow animals at the desired temperature until the desired stage.\nWhen growing animals at such a large scale, make sure that they do not starve by checking the plates daily.\n25. Wash animals off the plates using ice-cold sterile M9 buffer and collect them in 50-ml centrifuge tubes on ice.\nThe exact volume of M9 used is not critical; it should just be sufficient to retrieve all animals.\n26. Centrifuge tubes for 2 min at 650 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n27. Resuspend animals in 40 ml ice-cold sterile M9 buffer. If the sample is split across several tubes, combine it into a single tube, so that the pellet volume is between 5 and 10 ml.\n28. Centrifuge 2 min at 650 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n29. Repeat steps 27 and 28 two more times.\n30. Resuspend pellet in 40 ml ice-cold PBS.\n31. Centrifuge 2 min at 650 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n32. Add 0.5 pellet-volumes of ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors.\nFor instance, if you have a 5-ml pellet, add 2.5 ml PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors.",
    "33. Resuspend using a 10-ml pipet and then dispense sample, drop by drop, into a 500-ml Dewar beaker filled with liquid nitrogen.\nThis freezing method will generate small beads.\n34. Chill a 50-ml centrifuge tube using liquid nitrogen and transfer worm beads into it.\n35. Store beads at –80°C.\nFrozen worm beads can be stored for a few months at –80°C.",
    "Here, we describe how to cross-link chromatin in C. elegans, which locks not only its protein-DNA interactions but also its protein-protein interactions in place. We then describe how to lyse the worms and isolate the cross-linked chromatin and how to best shear the chromatin into fragments of appropriate size for immunoprecipitation. These steps have been specifically developed or optimized for use in C. elegans and may differ significantly from what you find in protocols used for other organisms or for cultured cells. Most notably, the C. elegans cuticle is difficult to penetrate with chemicals like formaldehyde (Burns et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-bib-0006]), which makes it impossible to achieve efficient and uniform cross-linking of chromatin across tissues. We circumvent this problem, first by flash-freezing the worms in liquid nitrogen (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0001], step 33), then by gently breaking them into several fragments by grinding in liquid nitrogen, and finally by thawing these animals in the presence of formaldehyde. This approach leads to much better penetration by the cross-linker and, hence, improved ChIP results. Upon cross-linking, the samples are further homogenized by bead-beating, and then we use sonication to fully lyse the animals and shear the chromatin into fragments of appropriate size. Lastly, we describe the immunoprecipitation of these fragments via protein pull-down using an antibody against the protein of interest bound to Protein A or G Dynabeads.\nMaterials\nProtein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 10002D) or Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 10004D)\nB-ChIP-BL (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0002]; make fresh)\nPurified antibody or antiserum (antibody of choice for immunoprecipitation; e.g., BioLegend, 920102)\nLiquid nitrogen\nFrozen worm beads (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0001])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0011])\n16% (w/v) formaldehyde, methanol-free (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28908)\n100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482)\n2.5 M glycine\nPBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0010]), 4°C\nB-ChIP-L0 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-rec-0003]), 4°C",

Vortex the stock of protein A Dynabeads or protein G Dynabeads for 20 s and then immediately transfer 100 µl bead suspension into a 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube.",
    "The choice of protein A or protein G Dynabeads depends on the antibody you want to use for the immunoprecipitation. Depending on the animal it was raised in and its IgG type, the antibody may have different affinities for protein A or protein G; consult the literature choose accordingly. For example, for the Living Colors Full-Length GFP Polyclonal Antibody (Takara, 632592), we use protein A Dynabeads.\n2. Add 1.5 ml fresh B-ChIP-BL and mix by pipetting up and down with a 1-ml pipet.\n3. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack for Dynabeads and waiting for 1 min.\n4. With the tube in the rack, remove supernatant. Then, remove tube from the rack.\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 two more times.\n6. Resuspend beads in 250 µl fresh B-ChIP-BL and add 10 µg purified antibody or 4 µl antiserum.\nFor example, for the immunoprecipitation of a GFP-tagged chromatin-associated protein, we use 7 µl anti-GFP antibody (Takara, 632592) in combination with protein A Dynabeads.\n7. Incubate on a tube rotator at 10 rpm for 6 to 16 hr at 4°C.\n8. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min.\n9. Remove supernatant.\n10. Remove tube from the rack, add 1.5 ml B-ChIP-BL, and mix by pipetting up and down with a 1-ml pipet.\n11. Settle beads by placing the tube back in the magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min.\n12. Remove supernatant.\n13. Repeat steps 10 to 12 two more times.\n14. Resuspend beads in 100 µl fresh B-ChIP-BL and store them at 4°C.\nThese beads can only be stored for a few days.\nFreeze-grinding and cross-linking",
    "15. Pre-chill a Biopulverizer and hammer, a mortar and pestle, a metal spatula, and a few 15-ml centrifuge tubes by submerging them in liquid nitrogen.\n16. Transfer ≤5 ml frozen worm beads from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0001] into the pre-cooled Biopulverizer and break them by three rounds of five blows with the included hammer. After each round of five blows, use the pre-cooled spatula to collect the powder into the middle of the Biopulverizer again.\n17. Re-cool same spatula in liquid nitrogen and use it to transfer the powder to the pre-cooled mortar. Using the pestle, grind for ∼5 min.\n18. Transfer a small amount of powder to a glass slide, let it thaw, and check under a stereomicroscope that all worms have broken into at least 4 to 5 pieces.\nThere should not be any intact worms.\n19. Using the re-cooled spatula, transfer powder to the pre-cooled 15-ml centrifuge tubes from step 15.\nTry to aliquot the powder so that there is 4 to 5 ml powder (i.e., the required amount for one ChIP experiment) per tube.\n20. Store these tubes at –80°C.\nThis is a safe stopping point. Samples can be kept for several weeks at –80°C.\n21. Prepare 40 ml PBS in a 50-ml centrifuge tube and heat tube to 42°C in a water bath for ≥30 min.\n22. Just before use, add 16% formaldehyde and 100 mM PMSF solution to final concentrations of 1.1% and 1 mM, respectively.\nWe recommend using single-use formaldehyde ampules (e.g., Pierce, 28908), which lead to improved cross-linking reproducibility.\n23. Get tubes from step 20 out of the freezer and transfer the 4 to 5 ml frozen ground worm powder into the PBS/formaldehyde/PMSF-containing 50-ml tube.",
    "24. Use 2 to 4 ml suspension from step 23 to wash remaining powder out of the 15-ml tube then transfer into the 50-ml tube.\n25. Incubate on a tube rotator for 7 min at room temperature.\nThese cross-linking conditions are just meant as a guideline. They have worked well for most of our applications. However, some bait proteins may require that you adjust these conditions, e.g., proteins of high abundance and that tightly interact with DNA may work best with shorter cross-linking times or lower formaldehyde concentrations. Conversely, proteins that are expressed at low levels or that weakly associate with DNA may require longer cross-linking times or higher formaldehyde concentrations.\n26. Stop cross-linking by adding 2.3 ml of 2.5 M glycine to achieve a final glycine concentration of 125 mM.\n27. Incubate on a tube rotator for 5 min at room temperature.\nAfter this step until step 69, work in a cold room or on ice.\n28. Centrifuge 3 min at 4000 × g, 4°C, remove supernatant, and resuspend pellet in 10 ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors.\n29. Transfer suspension to a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n30. Centrifuge 3 min at 4000 × g, 4°C, and then discard supernatant.\n31. Resuspend pellet in 10 ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors.\n32. Repeat steps 30 and 31.\n33. Centrifuge 3 min at 4000 × g, 4°C, and then discard supernatant.\n34. Resuspend pellet in ice-cold B-ChIP-L0 (use 650 µl B-ChIP-L0 per 100 µl pellet volume).",
    "The sample can now be flash-frozen and stored for several weeks at –80°C. However, freezing the formaldehyde-treated sample before sonication will decrease the efficiency of shearing. If you want to keep the sample and use it later, it is better to freeze it after sonication (after step 45). Thus, we advise to continue with the protocol.\nWorm lysis\n35. Take 1.7 ml suspension from step 34 and transfer it to a 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube.\n36. Add 200 µl acid-washed glass beads.\n37. Vortex for 30 s (preferably in a cold room) and then place on ice for 60 s.\n38. Repeat step 37 two more times.\n39. Transfer 1.4 ml sample to a 15-ml polymethylpentene centrifuge tube.\nThe 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube with the remaining suspension can now be discarded.\nShearing of the chromatin\n40. Position sonicator probe in the tube and place it inside a Bioruptor Plus sonicator with an actively cooled water bath set to 4°C.\nMake sure that the lid is firmly closed and that the probe does not touch the tube wall. There should be a gap of at least 1 to 2 mm on all sides and at the bottom of the tube.\nThis and the following steps describe the sonication of the sample using a Diagenode Bioruptor Plus. Other sonicators can be used, but these steps would have to be adjusted depending on the instrument. For any water bath–based sonicator like the Bioruptor, it is important to use polymethylpentene tubes to achieve optimal shearing efficiency. Do not use standard polypropylene tubes.\n41. Set sonicator to full power and set its sonication cycle to 30 s ON, 90 s OFF.\n42. Run sonicator for eight cycles.",
    "Make sure that no foaming occurs. If it does, you may have too little sample in your tube or the sonicator probe may be mispositioned.\n43. Take tube out of the water bath and vortex it gently to homogenize sample.\n44. Repeat steps 42 and 43 two more times, leading to 12 min total sonication time.\n45. Transfer sample to a 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube, add 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, and rotate on a tube rotator for 10 min at 4°C.\nChromatin should be sheared to approximately 150 to 300 bp. The required sonication time and power level described here may differ for your sonicator. We therefore recommend determining optimal settings for your sample and instrument empirically, e.g., by testing different sonication conditions. To check for proper fragment size right after sonication, you can analyze 50 µl of your sample as described for D-IN samples in steps 74 to 80.\nLonger cross-linking times or higher formaldehyde concentrations require longer sonication times to yield similar fragment lengths.\nOPTIONAL: Sonicated samples can now be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for several weeks at –80°C.\n46. Centrifuge sample for 5 min at 20,000 × g, 4°C, and transfer supernatant to a 1.5-ml Safe-Lock tube.\nWe recommend also storing the pellet (at –20°C), as it may later be useful for troubleshooting.\n47. Centrifuge sample for 15 min at 20,000 × g, 4°C, and transfer supernatant to a fresh 1.5-ml Safe-Lock tube.\nImmunoprecipitation\n48. Store 50 µl of the cleared sample at –20°C.\nThis will be the protein input sample, or P-IN, used to monitor the efficiency of the protein pull-down.\n49. Store another 50 µl of the cleared sample in a cold room on ice.\nThis will be the DNA input sample, or D-IN.",
    "50. Add remaining cleared sample to the tube with Dynabeads from step 14, resuspend by pipetting, and then incubate on a tube rotator overnight at 4°C.\n51. Write down total volume of the sample used in step 50.\nThis information can later be used to calculate immunoprecipitation efficiency.\n52. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min. Store 50 µl of the supernatant at –20°C and discard remaining supernatant.\nThe reserved supernatant will be the protein flow-through sample, or P-FT, used to monitor the efficiency of the protein pull-down.\n53. Remove tube from the magnetic rack and add 1.5 ml ice-cold B-ChIP-Lys to the beads. Resuspend by pipetting.\n54. Rotate tube for 5 min at 4°C.\n55. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min. Discard supernatant.\n56. Repeat steps 53 to 55 one more time.\n57. Remove tube from the magnetic rack and add 1.5 ml ice-cold B-ChIP-Lys containing 200 mM NaCl. Resuspend by pipetting and then transfer sample to a new 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube.\n58. Rotate tube for 5 min at 4°C.\n59. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min. Discard supernatant.\n60. Remove tube from the magnetic rack and add 1.5 ml ice-cold B-ChIP-W. Resuspend by pipetting and then transfer sample to a new 2.0-ml Safe-Lock tube.\n61. Rotate tube for 5 min at 4°C.\n62. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min. Discard supernatant.\n63. Repeat steps 60 to 62 without changing Safe-Lock tube.\n64. Add 1.2 ml ice-cold TE (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl, resuspend by pipetting, and then transfer sample to a new 1.5-ml Safe-Lock tube.",
    "65. Rotate tube for 5 min at 4°C.\n66. Settle beads by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min. Discard supernatant.\n67. Repeat steps 64 to 66 without changing Safe-Lock tube.\n68. Add 280 µl B-ChIP-EL and resuspend by pipetting.\n69. Incubate for 15 min at 65°C and 800 rpm in a Thermomixer.\n70. Denature required amount of 10 mg/ml RNase A by incubating it in a heat block for 10 min at 100°C and afterward letting it cool again to room temperature.\nYou will need 10 µl RNase A for each D-IN (step 49) or D-EL (step 73) sample.\nThis step eliminates potential contaminating enzymatic activities in the RNase preparation, i.e., potential DNase activity.\n71. Settle beads from step 69 by placing the tube in a magnetic rack and waiting for 1 min.\n72. Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5-ml Safe-Lock tube.\n73. Spin tube for 20 s at 20,000 × g to remove any contaminating Dynabeads and transfer 250 µl supernatant to a new 1.5-ml Safe-Lock tube. Set aside 10 µl and store it at –20°C.\nThe supernatant is the final DNA eluate (D-EL), and the sample stored at –20°C is the protein eluate sample, or P-EL, used to monitor the efficiency of the protein pull-down.\nDNA purification\n74. Add 200 µl B-ChIP-EL to the stored D-IN samples from step 49.\n75. Add 10 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A from step 70 to each D-IN and D-EL tube and incubate for 1 hr at 37°C and 800 rpm in a Thermomixer.\n76. Add 10 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K to each of those tubes and incubate for 2 hr at 55°C and 800 rpm in a Thermomixer.",
    "77. Shake tubes overnight (ideally for 16 to 18 hr) at 65°C and 800 rpm in a Thermomixer to reverse any cross-links.\n78. Clean and concentrate each D-IN and D-EL sample by using a ChIP DNA cleanup kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use 50 µl elution buffer for final elution of the samples.\n79. Dilute 10 µl of each D-IN sample with TE (pH 8.0) to 500 µl. Then, take 10 µl of each of these dilutions and dilute them further with TE to 100 µl to reach a final dilution of 1:500.\nThis step dilutes the D-IN samples so that their DNA concentration becomes similar to that of the D-EL samples and thereby appropriate for library construction in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0003]. Samples can now be stored for several weeks at –20°C.\nChecking the extent of shearing (optional)\n80. Run 25 µl undiluted D-IN sample on a 1.5% agarose gel (see Current Protocols article; Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-bib-0037]). Use a gel without dye and only stain after the run.\nAppropriate chromatin shearing should result in the generation of DNA fragments in the size range of 150 to 300 bp. In the case of excessive chromatin shearing, reduce the sonication power or time. In the case of insufficient chromatin shearing, please consult the Sonication paragraph in the Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting section.\nChecking the efficiency of the protein pull-down (optional)\n81. Add 1 M Tris·HCl (pH 8.8) to a final concentration of 200 mM, 10% SDS to a final concentration of 1%, and 1 M DTT to a final concentration of 50 mM to all P-IN, P-FT, and P-EL samples.\n82. Incubate at 95°C in a heat block for 25 min.",
    "83. Run all samples on an SDS-PAGE gel (e.g., a 4% to 20% gradient gel) (see Current Protocols article; Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-bib-0011]) and detect the protein of interest by western blotting (for details about western blotting, see Current Protocols article; Gallagher, Winston, Fuller, & Hurrell, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-bib-0012]).\nEfficient protein pull-down has been achieved if most of the protein (ideally >90%) from the P-IN sample has ended up in the P-EL and not the P-FT sample.",
    "Here, we describe how to create a library from the input (D-IN) and eluted (D-EL) DNA samples from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0002] that can be sequenced on any Illumina platform sequencer, e.g., a HiSeq 2500 or HiSeq 3000. This part is challenging, as one obtains very little DNA in the eluted samples, commonly in the range of only 10 to 100 pg. The herein described protocol, derived from previous work by the laboratory of Robert Kingston (Bowman et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-bib-0004]), has been chosen accordingly.\nFor most C. elegans ChIP-seq libraries, it is sufficient to sequence them at a depth of 10 to 20 million reads. Given that modern Illumina sequencers easily generate more than 200 million reads per sample, C. elegans ChIP-seq libraries should be multiplexed. For this purpose, this protocol introduces barcodes into each library that allow for their pooled sequencing and subsequent demultiplexing.\nThe protocol entails four major steps, which are end repair, A-tailing, ligation of the adapters, and library amplification. DNA shearing by sonication results in non-homogenous DNA fragments. The DNA end-repair step ensures that each fragment is blunt ended and contains 5’-phosphate and 3’-hydroxyl groups. During A-tailing, an A-overhang is created at the 3’ ends of each DNA strand to convert the fragments’ blunt ends into sticky ends that facilitate ligation. Resulting fragments are then ligated to adapters with complementary T-overhangs, which allow for the PCR-based amplification of the fragments using defined primers. Finally, that PCR-based amplification is conducted to introduce barcodes for demultiplexing and increase the amount of the library material to a level that is sufficient for sequencing.\nMaterials\nAMPure XP magnetic bead suspension (Beckman Coulter, A63881)\nD-EL or diluted D-IN samples from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.187#cpz1187-prot-0002]\nNuclease-free water (e.g., Thermo Fisher, AM9930)\n10 mM dNTPs (e.g., New England Biolabs, N0447L)",

Take 1 μl of each DNA library and run it on a Bioanalyzer using a high-sensitivity DNA kit for the Bioanalyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDuring the run, DNA fragments between 50 and 7000 bp are separated by electrophoresis, and their sizes and quantities are determined. Samples containing as little as 5 pg/μl DNA can be successfully analyzed by this method.",
    "Optimal libraries should predominantly be composed of DNA fragments in the range of 200 to 500 bp and be devoid of adapter dimers (running as a sharp peak below 200 bp) or excessively large DNA (>1.5 kb). Examples of Bioanalyzer results from good libraries are shown in the Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting section below. If necessary, libraries can be purified using AMPure XP beads to remove fragments outside the 200- to 500-bp range. Alternatively, the library can be size-selected using agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction of the desired size range. See the Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting section for more details.\n43. Determine concentration of the libraries from the Bioanalyzer software following the manufacturer's instructions.\nTo determine the library concentration for the purpose of sequencing, only consider DNA fragments between 200 and 500 bp.\nFor single-ended 50-bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 3000, we adjust our libraries to a concentration of 3.5 nM for fragments in the 200- to 500-bp range. However, the desired concentration will depend on the equipment and preferences of your sequencing facility."
