    "The entire procedure is carried out under the sterile biological hood and all solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile.\n1. Preparation of Essential Solutions\nPrepare solutions according to Table 1. \nKeep balanced salt solution (BSS) at room temperature and all other solutions at 4 °C until the time of use.\nWarm cold media to 37 °C in the water bath for a few minutes before using.\n2. Preparation and Storage of PBMCs\nCollect 10 ml of whole blood in EDTA-treated collection tubes to prepare two aliquots of PBMCs using 5 ml for each aliquot.\nTransfer 5 ml of whole blood from the EDTA-treated collection tube to a 50 ml tube.\nAdd an equal volume of BSS and mix sample by gentle pipetting up and down.\nPlace 3 ml of Ficoll in two 15 ml Falcon tubes.\nCarefully layer 4.5 ml of diluted blood mixture over the Ficoll in each tube.\nLet the tubes rest for up to 5 min to favor a clear separation of the blood and Ficoll.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 400 x g for 30 min at room temperature with no brake.\nCarefully remove the tubes from the centrifuge so as to not disturb the layering. The PBMCs are visible at the BSS/Ficoll interface.\nHarvest the cloudy layer of PBMCs at the interface of both tubes with a pipette and transfer to a new 50 ml tube.\nAdd 20 ml of complete media.\nCentrifuge the tube at 288 x g for 7 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μl of supplementary media.\nAdd an equal volume of freezing media.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a cryovial.\nPlace the cryovial into a cryofreezing container with isopropanol.\nStore the freezing container at -80 °C overnight.",
    "Transfer the frozen PBMCs aliquot to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n3. Functional Assay\n1. Day 1\nPlace aliquot from liquid nitrogen in water bath at 37 °C for a minute or until defrosted.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml tube with a sterile pipette.\nAdd 15 ml of complete media and spin the cells down at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration.\nGently suspend cell pellet in 1 ml of PHA media.\nComplete the volume to 20 ml with the same media.\nCap the tube loosely to allow air to enter.\nLeave the tube overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator to allow quiescent lymphocytes to transform into rapidly-proliferating lymphoblasts.\n2. Day 2\nTake the tube out of the incubator, screw the caps completely and spin the cells down at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration.\nGently suspend cell pellet in 1 ml of complete media.\nComplete the volume to 20 ml with the same media.\nCap the tube loosely to allow air to enter.\nLeave the tube overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator to expand cell numbers.\n3. Day 3\nGet the tube out of the incubator, screw the caps completely and spin the cells down at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration.\nWash cells twice with 10 ml of RPMI-1640 by centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 600 μl of RPMI-1640.\nMeasure the cell concentration and viability, using an automated cell counter and viability analyzer.\nAdd appropriate volume of RPMI-1640 to adjust to a cell concentration of 1.5 x 105 cells/20 μl.",
    "Treat cells with recombinant OPN (rOPN) or vehicle (PBS) in 1.5 ml of Eppendorf tubes.\n\t\nTransfer 100 μl of cell suspension to two sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd rOPN in one tube to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml.\nAdd an equal volume of PBS in the second tube.\nGently mix each condition by pipetting up and down twice using a sterile pipette set at 100 μl.\nPrepare the small sample 96-well microplate.\n\t\nAdd 5 μl of RPMI-1640 to each well.\nCentrifuge the plate at 200 x g for 3 min to remove any air bubbles.\nSeed the untreated cells as well as cells treated with rOPN or PBS.\n\t\nBefore transferring cells from tube to microplate, gently pipette up and down once to ensure a uniform suspension of cells.\nAdd 40 μl of cell suspension per well in quadruplicate for untreated cells, in duplicate for rOPN or PBS treated cells. Refer to Figure 1 for the design. This design allows 12 patients to be tested on the same microplate.\nLeave the cell plate under the sterile hood for 5 min to allow cells to rest and settle evenly to the bottom of the well before placing in the incubator.\nIncubate the plate for 18 hr at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator to optimize the effect of OPN.\n4. Day 4\nRun the plate with compounds.\n\t\nTake the plate out of the incubator and leave it at RT for around 30 min.\nPrepare 1 ml of 100 μM of somatostatin and isoproterenol in RPMI-1640 by adding 10 μl of stock solution (10 mM) in 990 μl of RPMI-1640.\nFill the compound plate by dispensing 20 μl in appropriate wells as indicated in Figure 2.",
    "Cover the compound plate with a precut pierceable seal to avoid change in compound concentration due to evaporation before or during incubation in the CDS-based system.\nLoad cell plate, pipette tips, and compound plate into the CDS-based system.\nName the plate in the CDS-based instrument software.\nSelect the appropriate protocol. The protocol edited for the classification with PBMCs is called 'Agonist Non-adherent cells Small Sample Plate RT 15 min'. Go to the protocol box and select this protocol in the list of protocols\nInitiate the protocol by clicking on 'Start'.\nThe integrated fluidics system simultaneously adds the compounds to all wells by injecting 5 μl per well to achieve a final concentration of 10 μM in a total volume of 50 μl.\nThe CDS-based system automatically collects the data for 15 min after compound addition.\nData analysis\n\t\nSelect low and high ranges of frequencies to use when calculating extracted values for the nonadherent cells.\nSelect drift correction to correct the linear change in baseline impedance measurements over time.\nSelect data filtering to reduce variations in the kinetic response measurement due to electronic noise and compound addition.\nSelect the Max-Min method for the full analysis time.\nExport data to Excel under the plate format option.\nCalculate delta G (ΔG) by subtracting the average of response magnitude to Gi stimulation (RmGi) from the average of response magnitude to Gs stimulation (RmGs) using the following formula:\n\t\tΔG = RmGi - RmGs\nCalculate the percentage of the fold effect (Fe) of OPN on Gi-mediated response by dividing the average of response magnitude to Gi stimulation in the presence of OPN (RmGiOPN) with the average of response magnitude to Gi stimulation in the presence of PBS (RmGiPBS) using the following formula:\n\t\tFe = 100 x (RmGiOPN/RmGiPBS)\nRefer to Table 2 to classify patients."
