    "1. Cellular preparations\nNOTE: Human iPSCs used in this protocol were derived from healthy donors and differentiated in monolayers using fully defined small molecule modulation of WNT signaling and lactate purification techniques as previously described12,13,14. iPSC-CMs were maintained every 2-3 days with a culture medium outlined below.\nPrepare a culture medium of basal medium (RPMI 1640) and 2% supplement (B27). Store at 4 °C. Use at room temperature (RT).\nPrepare a plating medium of basal medium (RPMI 1640), 2% supplement (B27) and 1:2000 ROCK inhibitor. Store at 4 °C. Use at RT.\nCoat sterilized 10 mm round glass #0 coverslips with 150 µL of 1:60 factor free basement membrane matrix and incubate at 4 °C for 4 h.\n\tNOTE: Optimization of coverslip volume is necessary to ensure the entire glass is covered while maintaining adequate surface tension to prevent spillage. 150 µL is recommended for 10 mm round coverslips. Batch size, coverslip type, coverslip volume and culture plate type can be suited to the experimenters needs.\nBegin iPSC-CM dissociation with an EDTA-based cell dissociation reagent. Ensure that the monolayer is completely detached by gently flushing with a 1,000 µL pipette.\nTransfer the cellular suspension into a 15 mL tube and add double volume plating medium. Centrifuge for 10 min at 100 x g.\nResuspend the pellet with a desired volume (resuspension volume) of plating medium. Count cells manually or electronically.\nSelect optimal density per coverslip (15,000) which will allow for the isolated cellular analysis later.\nCalculate the volume of ‘active’ cellular suspension (A) needed to plate all coverslips at this desired density. Apply the following formula and withdraw into a separate tube:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61890/61890equ01v2.jpg",
    "Calculate the volume of extra plating medium (B) needed to accommodate each coverslip at a desired volume. Apply the following formula and add the resulting volume to the tube of active suspension:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61890/61890equ02v2.jpg\nRemove the matrix from coverslips and apply the ‘coverslip volume’ of cell suspension (A+B) to each coverslip. Regularly resuspend in the tube to ensure even cellular distribution.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Gently fill the well with plating medium.\nAfter 24 h, exchange media with normal culture medium and maintain every 2-3 days.\n2. Experimental setup\nEquip an inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 40x magnification, high numerical aperture lens (N.A: > 0.75) to conduct experiments.\nCouple a fast switching warm white LED to the transmitted illumination port of the microscope. Insert a simple red 660 nm filter into the transmitted light path.\n\tNOTE: This light can be activated throughout photometry experiments to observe the sample without contaminating the green fluorescent signal.\nMount a fast switching 470 nm LED head for photometry recording. Insert a 470/40 excitation filter at the epifluorescent port of the microscope to clean-up the light generated by the LED.\n\tNOTE: For optimum signal quantification an illumination system with high speed feedback control of optical output is recommended.\nInsert a microscope cube containing a 495 nm long pass beam splitter in the mirror unit carousel within the microscope.\nFit a detection arm containing an adjustable field diaphragm to the microscope C-mount port to allow region of interest selection.\nSeparately couple a photomultiplier detector (PMT) and a USB camera to the microscope. This will form the basis of the emission detection system.\nInsert a filter cube containing a 565 nm long pass beam splitter and a 535/50 emission filter into the PMT port. This splits emission light between the two detectors.",
    "NOTE: A camera attached to the transmitted port of the emission detection system can detect transmitted light under brightfield throughout all experiments.\nCouple the PMT to a power supply and a PMT amplifier. Connect the PMT amplifier output to an analogue input pin of a data acquisition system.\nFilter analogue data from the PMT at 1 kHz or higher.\nDigitize data at a frequency that is at least double that of the highest frequency present in analogue signal (2 kHz or higher) to fulfill Nyquist criteria and prevent aliasing.\n3. Cellular loading with VF2.1Cl\nNOTE: All steps involving this dye must be carried out in low light conditions.\nPrepare a Tyrode’s bath solution of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Glucose, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, pH = 7.35 and warm to 37 °C.\nPrepare an aliquot of loading solution in a microcentrifuge tube by mixing 5 µL of 1,000x VF2.1Cl and 50 µL of 20% solubilizing poloxamer solution.\nApply 5 µL of the loading solution to 5 mL of warmed Tyrode’s solution (total 0.1x dye concentration) in a 20 mm Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: Final dye concentration is 0.1x. This is 1/10th that suggested by the manufacturer. This conserves resources, ensures negligible cytotoxicity, and importantly, still retains clear optical signals from loaded cells with high signal to noise ratios.\nAdd a single iPSC-CM cover slip to the dish and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.\nAssemble a heated live cell imaging chamber. Mount onto the microscope stage and fill with 500 µL of fresh Tyrode’s solution.\nWash the coverslip with fresh Tyrode’s solution at 37 °C.\nCarefully apply the iPSC-CM coverslip to the pre-warmed bath chamber using fine point forceps.",
    "NOTE: Ensure the chamber and its contents are always heated at physiological temperatures. If desired, commence with continuous perfusion of warmed Tyrode’s solution.\n4. Electrical field stimulation\nNOTE: External triggering of iPSC-CM is optional but useful for standardization of cellular dynamics and experimental parameters. It increases the ease of analysis and allows for the investigation of frequency-dependent effects.\nAttach a stimulation insert with two platinum electrodes spaced 5 mm apart into the recording chamber.\nConnect an external stimulator to the stimulation insert. Set to 5 ms bipolar field pulses at 0.5 Hz.\nDetermine optimal stimulation voltage by increasing the stimulus from 1 V upwards. Threshold stimulus is defined as the lowest voltage at which cells begin to contract. Apply voltages roughly 25% above this threshold. Normal range is between 1 V and 30 V.\nFix stimulation frequency with the external stimulator or trigger it with acquisition software.\n5. Optical action potential acquisition\nNOTE: This protocol uses a commercial software for acquisition and analysis.\nVisualize the myocytes in brightfield view using the transmitted light path and the USB camera.\nSelect an isolated cell and tightly crop its optical path with the field diaphragm ensuring only light from the cell of interest is monitored.\nActivate the PMT amplifier and set the PMT supply to 750 V.\nRun the stimulation protocol (see step 4) along with the acquisition software and simultaneously activate the 470 nm excitation light. The latter can be done via a remote panel or automated at a fixed intensity (TTL signal).\nAdjust gain and offset of the PMT amplifier to make sure the signal does not saturate and is optimized for the detection range of the recording system.\nRecord 10 sweeps ensuring stable action potentials are detected.",
    "Continue recording and immediately move the microscope stage to briefly acquire background signal from a region devoid of cells. Turn off the excitation light.\n\tNOTE: This background value (Foffset ) will be used to account for any background fluorescence.\nIf desired, locally perfuse reference drugs such as 1 µM nifedipine to identify cellular responses to pharmacological manipulation.\nIn a sequential fashion, repeat steps 5.2–5.7, each time selecting a new cell. Swap out coverslips if desired to ensure high experimental turnover in a single sitting.\n\tNOTE: Loading and image acquisition protocols are described in Figure 2.\n6. Data analysis\nOpen a saved recording with the analysis software and average 10 sweeps containing stimulated action potentials from a single cell.\nTake a mean of the baseline signal representing Foffset and subtract this from the averaged trace.\nCalculate ∆F/F0 with the following formula (where F is measured fluorescence and F0 is diastolic fluorescence):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61890/61890equ03v2.jpg\nIdentify the trace baseline (diastolic) and area of interest (AP) and measure the desired cardiac action potential parameters. This includes but is not limited to the decay time for 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization.\nExport the data from this single cell to a spreadsheet software.\nRepeat steps 6.1 – 6.5 for all recordings. Assess results with appropriate unpaired tests or analysis of variance.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61890/61890fig2v2.jpg\nFigure 2: Loading and image acquisition protocols. (A) Flow chart of complete VF2.1Cl loading protocol for iPSC-CMs and native cardiomyocytes.
