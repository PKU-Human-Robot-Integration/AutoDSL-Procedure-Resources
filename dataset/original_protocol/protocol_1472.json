    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissociation of a mouse kidney\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step demonstrates how to prepare a cell suspension from a mouse kidney for the isolation and cultivation of renal interstitial fibroblasts. Reagent volumes are determined by multiplication of the number of mouse kidneys being prepared. Renal interstitial fibroblasts tightly weave around capillaries in the kidney (Souma et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) and are likely vulnerable to physical stress. Therefore, to maintain the intrinsic features of isolated fibroblasts, mouse kidneys should be finely dissociated as gently as possible.\nHarvest a mouse kidney and remove the fibrous capsule and the renal medulla using forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1016-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of kidney pieces\n(A) Mouse kidneys before (left) and after (right) renal medulla removal.\n(B) Kidneys are minced with scissors (left) until they become a smooth paste (right).\n(C) Minced kidneys are washed with PBS in a C-tube three times. The left and right panels show the first and third washes, respectively. Clear supernatant (PBS) is removed after 1 min of standing.\n(D) Kidney pieces are collected on a 70-μm strainer. The remnants on the 70-μm strainer are collected by washing the strainer, which is face down, with DMEM containing FBS.\nMince a kidney with scissors on a Petri dish at room temperature (20°C–25°C; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd 5 mL of ice-cold PBS and transfer the minced kidney into a C-tube.\nRemove the supernatant (PBS) after 1 min of standing on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nGently mix the minced kidney with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS by pipetting.\nRepeat steps 4 and 5 three times.\nRemove the supernatant (PBS) after 1 min of standing on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nResuspend the minced kidney with 5 mL of the prewarmed Collagenase II solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).",
    "Critical: For a better yield, the kidneys should be minced well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and incubated with freshly prepared Collagenase II solution.\nIncubate the cell suspension for 1 h at 37°C in a prewarmed shaking incubator (130 rpm).\nStir the cell suspension in a C-tube with a gentleMACS Dissociator (Program B: 553 rpm for 30 s) two times.\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of DMEM containing FBS (10%, v/v).\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70-μm cell strainer in a 50-mL tube.\nFlow-through: for step 14 (isolation of primary renal interstitial fibroblasts)\nRemnants: for step 20 (cultivation of kidney pieces)\nIsolation of primary renal interstitial fibroblasts\nTiming: >2 h\n(From step 13a) Filter the cell suspension through a Preseparation filter (a 30-μm cell strainer) in a 15-mL tube.\nMeasure the cell concentration of the flow-through fraction to determine the volume of single-cell suspensions at step 17.\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in DMEM containing FBS (10%, v/v) at a concentration of approximately 1×106 cells/mL and store on ice.\nTo stain the cells with antibodies that are conjugated with fluorescent dye appropriate for flow cytometry, incubate the cell suspension with antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 40 min on ice, followed by washing the antibodies 3 times with DMEM containing FBS (10%, v/v).\nNote: To specifically stain renal interstitial fibroblasts of mouse kidneys, antibodies against CD73 (BioLegend Cat# 127207) and PDGFRβ (Abcam Cat# ab91066) are often used (Pan et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Higashi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Conway et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Geng et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).",
    "Alternatives: Using genetically modified mice that express fluorescent proteins exclusively in interstitial fibroblasts in kidneys, antibody staining can be omitted. Indeed, this protocol was optimized by using a genetically modified mouse line expressing tdTomato fluorescence in REP cells, which is referred to as the “REP cell-reporter mouse line” in this protocol (Yamazaki et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nSort fibroblasts with a cell sorter (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The settings of a FACSJazz cell sorter are as below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1016-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Isolation of REP cells from REP cell-reporter mice before or after cultivation in semisolid medium\n(A) The expression of tdTomato red fluorescent protein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in kidney cell suspensions of anemic REP cell-reporter mice before (left, step 19) and after (right, step 37) primary culture for 6 days is analyzed by flow cytometry. In the reporter mice, tdTomato is expressed by Cre-mediated recombination of the Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxp-tdTomato modified gene in cells that have ever expressed the EpoCre transgene (Yamazaki et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). The anemic condition of the reporter mouse enhances the expression of GFP from the endogenous Epo allele (left), in which GFP cDNA is integrated, because Epo gene expression is induced by anemic hypoxia (Obara et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). During the primary culture, GFP expression disappears (right). The percentage of tdTomato+ cells (red boxes) increases from 0.1% to 0.6% after primary culture.\n(B) tdTomato fluorescence is detectable in cell pellets (arrows) of sorted tdTomato+ fibroblasts (right) but not in those of tdTomato– cells (left).\n(C) tdTomato expression in a kidney piece from the REP cell-reporter mouse.\n(D) tdTomato expression in cells primarily cultured for 6 days in semisolid medium.\nNozzle size: 100 μm\nSort mode: 1.5 Drop Pure\nEvent Rate: 1000–2000 cells/s",
    "Note: Using this protocol, it usually takes approximately 3 h to collect 3000 REP cells from the kidneys of a REP-cell reporter mouse, in which approximately 0.1% of total cells are tdTomato-positive REP cells (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The viability of sorted cells is not decreased until at least 3 h on ice.\nCultivation of kidney pieces\nTiming: 7–14 days\n(From step 13b) Flip the 70-μm cell strainer over onto a dish to collect the remnant cells on the strainer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nFlush the cell strainer with 6 mL of DMEM containing FBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the kidney pieces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) in 6 mL of the semisolid culture medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nSeed the kidney pieces on dishes or plates.\nIncubate the cells for 7–14 days at 37°C in a CO2 (5%) incubator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). The medium does not need to be changed.\nHarvest the cells by pipetting 10 times the PBS volume and place the cells in a 50-mL tube.\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of Accutase and incubate the mixture at 37°C for 10 min.\nAdd 3 mL of DMEM containing FBS.\nFilter the cell suspension through a Preseparation filter (a 30-μm cell strainer) in a 15-mL tube.\nDetermine the cell concentration in the flow-through fraction.\nCentrifuge (300×g) the mixture for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in DMEM containing FBS at a concentration of approximately 1×106 cells/mL and store on ice.",
