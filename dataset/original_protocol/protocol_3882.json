    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProtein spin labeling\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis major step is to create the needed cysteine mutants and spin label each. The purification protocol is suitable for isolating charged proteins. Note that one cysteine mutation has to be placed in the protein at a time (to avoid spectral overlap). Therefore, usually multiple single cysteine mutants are needed. The following procedures are to label one cysteine mutant. Usually for 8–10 mutants, 1 week is sufficient to complete all procedures. For each additional 8–10 mutants, another week is needed.\nCritical: For other proteins, an appropriate purification protocol should replace this major step.\nCreate plasmids with the needed mutants.\nThe ordered primers (see above Section “prepare primers for cysteine mutation and spin labeling[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”, step 5) will be dissolved in sterilized water following the standard procedure of polymer chain reaction (PCR) available at New England Biolabs: https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273]\nThen, the cysteine-free, pseudo-wildtype plasmid of the protein will be applied to include the mutants in the plasmid following the PCR procedure above.\nCritical: Native free cysteines of the target protein have to be mutated to a serine or alanine (native cysteines forming disulfide bonds do not participate in spin labeling and do not need to be mutated). This is usually not a major hurdle given the low natural abundance of free cysteine in most proteins. For cysteine-rich proteins, unnatural amino acids can be employed (see below).\nTransform the plasmid into cells via mini-prep using the standard procedure and the commercial kit: https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiaprep-spin-miniprep-kit/#orderinginformation[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiaprep-spin-miniprep-kit/#orderinginformation]\nConfirm the sequence is needed via commercial DNA sequencing service. We use Molecular Cloning Laboratories (MCLab https://www.mclab.com/[href=https://www.mclab.com/]) for sequencing.\nThe resultant DNA can be stored at −20°C for further use.\nTransformation of mutants.",
    "The standard transformation protocol that transform the DNA into solid LB medium (plates) available at New England Biolabs is usually applied with minor modifications: https://www.neb.com/protocols/2012/05/21/transformation-protocol[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2012/05/21/transformation-protocol]\nProtein expression.\nFor each mutant, inoculate one colony from the plate and grow in 25 mL LB (1 × AMP) medium at 37°C for 12–16 h (205–225 rpm shaking rate).\nAdd the 25 mL overnight culture into 1 L LB (1 × AMP) medium and incubate at 37°C under shaking for 4 h.\nInduce each liter of cells with 1 mL (1 M) IPTG at 37°C for 1.5 h under shaking.\nImmediately harvest the cells via centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15–45 min.\nResuspend the pellets with 25–50 mL of lysate buffer via gentle shaking.\nPause point: Cell pellets can be stored at −20°C for at least several months.\nSonicate the pellet suspension on ice under a 50% duty cycle for 5 min. Place on ice for 5 min.\nOptional: If larger pellets are present after sonication, another round of sonication can be applied.\nSeparate the supernatant from the cell debris via centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 h.\nTake the supernatant and filter with 0.22 μm to remove large particles/pellets.\nProtein purification and spin labeling.\nEquilibrate the FPLC motors with lysate buffer.\nLoad the supernatant into a GE ion-exchange (SP HP) column (see equipment above). Rinse the column with the lysate buffer until the UV absorbance is near zero. Collect flow-through.\nElute the column with varied salt content: 0%–10% (high salt buffer content) for 2 min, 10%–30% for 10 min, 30%–100% for 0.5 min, and wash with 100% for 50 mL. The lysozyme protein should collect at 15%–25%.\nCritical: DTT is needed in the above steps (before running the desalting column) to avoid protein dimerization caused by disulfide formation between cysteines.",
    "Switch to the desalting column and equilibrate the column with the spin labeling buffer (100 mL; no DTT).\nLoad the cysteine mutants prepared above into the desalting column. Collect the protein as the first peak appears (12 mL).\nImmediately add in HO-225 (10-fold excess) to react with the cysteine mutant.\nCover the container with foil and leave under 4°C for overnight.\nRemove unreacted HO-225 via filtration-centrifugation using Amicon concentrators with a 10 kDa cutoff.\nBring the protein concentration to ∼0.2–0.5 mM using the Amicon concentrators for storage at 4°C.\nProtein characterization\nConfirm the molecular weight and the yield of the spin labeled protein by gel-electrophoresis using the standard procedures and protein ladder at https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/BID/brochures/precast-protein-gels-brochure.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/BID/brochures/precast-protein-gels-brochure.pdf] and https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-gel-electrophoresis.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-gel-electrophoresis.html]. T4 lysozyme should appear at ∼18.7 kDa.\nNote: Because protein gel experiment procedure and commercial kits are well-established, only links are provided here for the conciseness of this protocol.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nConfirm the secondary structure of the spin labeled protein by Circular Dichroism. All mutants should show the expected CD spectrum as in the published work.(Pan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29], Yang et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38])\nConfirm the activity of the spin labeled protein using the standard lysozyme activity kit available at Sigma-Aldrich (LY0100).\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOptional: Right after step 3b, an aliquot of 0.5 mL cells can be mixed with 0.5 mL of sterilized glycerol uniformly and stored at −20 or −80°C for future expression. For long-term storage, the labeled proteins can be stored at −20°C.\nNote: Protocols above uses T4 lysozyme as an example to highlight the needed steps. Protein purification clearly depends on the specific enzyme. Thus, this major step has to be dependent on the target enzyme. In addition to the kits listed above, other commercial kits for PCR, mini-prep, and protein activity assays can also be used.\nEnzyme loading/encapsulation into porous materials",
    "Timing: 2–3 days\nLoading a spin labeled enzyme into mesoporous materials, especially MOFs/COFs, is no different from loading regular enzymes. The only caution would be to avoid reducing conditions, which cleaves the disulfide bonds between the label and the protein cysteine. Because enzymes can be loaded into pre-formed MOFs/COFs and via co-precipitation, we separately discuss these two loading events.\nProtein loading\nTo load into a pre-formed MOF/COF, the MOF/COF should be resuspended with a proper buffer (usually HEPES at pH 7.0–7.4) that does not disturb the MOF/COF scaffold. Then, the labeled protein is mixed with the materials in the HEPES buffer and shaken gently for overnight at room temperature. Usually for each 1 mg of MOF/COF, 1–2 mg of protein is needed to ensure protein is in excess to facilitate the loading. If needed, an additional day can be given.\nCritical: Depending on the enzyme, lower temperature may be needed for protein stability. If the HEPES buffer disturb a particular MOF/COF, other buffers such as acetate or MES buffer can be used.\nTo encapsulate an enzyme in a MOF via co-precipitation, the needed metal ion (ca. Zn2+ or Ca2+ as in our recent studies) and ligand on the order of a few mM together with the enzyme (∼mg/mL) are mixed in the appropriate medium (water or MeOH). The co-precipitation can go overnight with an option of gentle shaking.\nRemove unwanted species.",
    "Remove free protein, metal, and ligand via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Resuspend the enzyme@MOF/COF pellets with water, and centrifuge again. If needed, 3–5 cycles are needed (as long as there is no residual protein and ligand in the supernatant of the wash, which can be determined via UV-vis absorption spectroscopy). The resultant enzyme@MOF materials are in the pellets and can be stored at 4°C in water or MeOH.\nConfirm the integrity of the materials and the function of the enzyme.\nStandard MOF/COF characterization (Sun et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]; Wang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]; Majewski et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Drout et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Li et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Li et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Gkaniatsou et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Lian et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; An et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermalgravimetric analysis TGA, and N2 absorption experiments should be carried out to confirm the loading of the enzyme as well as the structure of the MOF/COF scaffolds. Usually near-identical SEM and PXRD are expected before and after enzyme loading.\nNote: Because MOF/COF characterization is well-known and standardized, no detail is provided here.\nConfirm enzyme activity. Lysozyme is a unique case because it can catalyze both large and small size substrates. For the large size substrates, bacterial cell walls, which can be hydrolyzed by lysozyme encapsulated on the surface of MOFs via co-precipitation, the commercial kit described above (Sigma-Aldrich) can be used.\nFor smaller substrates that contain a 1,4-glycosidic bond, such as the 11-chitosan, which can diffuse into the MOF/COF channels, the following steps can be used to determine lysozyme activity following the literature:(Sun et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34])",
    "The lysozyme loaded MOFs/COFs are mixed with chitosan solution (0.6 mg mL−1 in 0.1 M acetate solution, 4 mL, (CAS 577-76-4), buffer (0.1 M acetate solution, 1 mL), and a magnetic stirrer in a 10 mL Schlenk flask.\nThe container of the mixture is then sealed and heated in a preheated water bath (50°C) under constant magnetic stirring for 2 h.\nThe pellets are removed via filtration through a 0.45-μm membrane filter.\n1.5 mL of the flow-through was added into 2.0 mL of coloring reagent dropwise (0.05% potassium ferricyanide solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 g potassium ferricyanide in 1.0 L of 0.5 M sodium carbonate), followed by being heated at 100°C for 15 min.\nUpon cooling to room temperature, the optical intensity at 420 nm (OD420) was determined using a UV spectrometer. The decrease in OD420 is proportional to the amount of reducing groups generated when chitosan was hydrolyzed by lysozyme.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOptional: If a reducing condition is needed for enzyme function, the IAP-spin label based on the formation of a S-C bond (instead of S-S bond) can be used (Sahu and Lorigan, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]).\nPause point: Enzyme@MOF/COF materials can be stored at 4°C for 2–4 weeks.\nAcquire EPR spectra\nTiming: 5–30 min per spectrum\nUpon confirming the enzymes are functional on MOFs/COFs, continuous wave (CW) EPR spectrum for each mutant on each MOF/COF should be acquired, analysis of which (see latter steps) will result in enzyme orientation and dynamics information. The procedures below are based on our spectrometer, a Varian E-109 with a cavity resonator. Similar steps with minor alterations can be followed when using other commercially available CW EPR spectrometers. Depending on loading capacity of the specific materials, each CW EPR spectrum can take 5–30 min.\nLoad samples to EPR capillaries.",
    "For room temperature CW EPR measurement, usually minimal water volume is suggested to avoid the absorption of microwave power by the water molecular dipoles. A borosilicate tube with 0.6 I.D. × 0.8 O.D. is often sufficient with 1–2 cm sample height loaded.\nCritical: For most enzyme@MOF/COF materials, a relatively larger total volume, ca. 20–40 μL, is needed so that the effective volume of the pellets is sufficient for EPR measurement. A pipette is needed to load such a large volume.\nCritical: Due to the heterogeneous phase of the sample, we found it the best practice if both ends of the EPR tube is open, so that the sample can be loaded into one end by making the capillary part of the pipette tip. Both ends can then be sealed with a wax (ca. Critoseal from Fisher/McKesson; see above).\nTurn on the CW EPR spectrometer.\nNote: It is always a good practice to give sufficient time (5–10 min in our case) for the electronics and cooling water to settle down/equilibrate.\nUnder the “Tune” mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and a low power (ca. 30 dB), insert the sample tube to the cavity. An indication of sample at the effective magnetic field region of the cavity is a “shift” in the tuning dip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B vs 2C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Critical: No change in the tuning dip position usually indicates the wrong sample position. This can be corrected by optimizing the sample height and capillary position. It may also be caused by a high water volume, which can be corrected by using a thinner capillary or increasing the porous materials content.\nSwitch the Reference Arm to ABS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D), the tuning dip should be asymmetric (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Adjust the sample position by adjusting the Iris to make the tuning dip symmetric (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). Turn off Reference Arm.\nSwitch to the “Operate” mode (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Adjust the main frequency to ensure the AFC OUT is centered (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Tune the Reference Arm to ABS. The Detection Current is usually asymmetric (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Adjust the Iris to center the DET CUR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Optimize sample position and power\n(A) Switch to “OPER” (operate) mode.\n(B) Adjust FREQUENCY (the knob right next to the “OPER”) to center “AFC OUT”.\n(C) The “DET CUR” (detection current) is usually not centered once the Reference Arm is switched on.\n(D) Adjust sample position by the Iris to center the “DET CUR”.\nCritical: Failing to center both AFC and DET CUR usually indicates a high water volume, which should be corrected by reducing the sample volume (but not changing the sample position).\nApply microwave power to the sample/cavity.\nSlowly increase the power to 12 dB (in a min or two) while adjusting the frequency to maintain the AFC OUT centered and the Iris to maintain the DET CUR centered.\nCritical: The operation should be processed slowly.\nSet up the EPR parameters.\nSet up the initial center magnetic field. For 9.6 GHz, usually ∼3390 G is a good starting point (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Key EPR parameters setup",
    "(A) Set up the scan range by setting the center field (upper panel) and the scan range (lower panel).\n(B) The “GAIN” (video gain; upper) and “MODULATION” (modulation amplitude; lower) need to be pre-set (and can be further optimized).\nNote: The center field will be optimized in latter steps.\nSet the scan range to 100 G (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), which is often sufficient for HO-225 spin label and protein dynamics measurement at room temperature.\nNote: A wider scan range may be needed if dipolar broadening or exchange broadening occurs (typically 160 G or 200 G will be needed in these cases).\nThe modulation frequency is 100 KHz. Video Gain starts at 160 and can be optimized based on the strength of the signal. Modulation depth of 1 G is usually good for nitroxide spin labels on protein studies at room temperature, which can be adjusted latter if needed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nRun a test scan and optimize the EPR parameters.\nAdjust the center field and Video Gain based on the test run (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example CW EPR spectrum\nThe user interface is generously provided by Dr. Altenbach and Prof. Hubbell at UCLA.\nDecrease the modulation depth to 0.5 G to ensure that the linewidth of each peak is not narrowed. Otherwise, keep reducing the modulation depth until the linewidth stops narrowing.\nCritical: Reducing the modulation depth would reduce the signal intensity. Therefore, the maximal modulation depth that does not broaden the spectrum should be used.\nAcquire a CW EPR spectrum for each mutant via signal averaging until a satisfied signal-to-noise ratio (usually >30) is reached (usually 5–30 min are needed depending on sample concentration).\nTroubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Optional: 12 dB power is ∼200 mW, which is reasonable for R1 spin label and protein studies. However, lower power can be tested to ensure no spectral broadening.\nPause point: All spectra should be properly stored electronically with all parameters accurately documented for further use.\nEPR spectral simulation\nTiming: 30–60 min per spectrum\nThis major step is to extract dynamic information of the protein labeled site from the acquired CW EPR spectra (key scheme see Pan et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). The motion of a spin label attached to an α helix (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) has been extensively studied with sufficient knowledge obtained, which sets up the basis of the spectral simulation. For example, the motion of the R1 spin label can be considered as “anisotropic” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B); the typical ranges of the rate (τ) and order (S) and how these parameters alter upon protein rotational tumbling changes are also documented in the literature (Altenbach et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Columbus et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Gaponenko et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Figure adapted with permission (Altenbach et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nCritical: For an unknown protein labeled at a non-helical region (ca. a loop region), X-band CW EPR together with multi-frequency EPR and varied viscosity conditions are suggested to accurately determine the rate and order parameters of the spin label, minimizing the potential errors (Pan et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nPre-data processing to prepare for spectral simulation.",
    "Baseline correction. Usually for our spectra, a 2nd–3rd order polynomial baseline is sufficient. A baseline correction program by Dr. Christian Altenbach and Prof. Wayne Hubbell at UCLA written in LabView is employed in our baseline correction.\nOptional: Any program that can correct spectral baseline can be applicable.\nCritical: A correct baseline is critical for the simulation as bumpy baseline can affect the fitting parameters.\nNormalize the spectra. Because a typical CW EPR spectrum is in the first-derivative format, normalizing the double-integration of the baseline-corrected spectra to 1 (or 100%) is the general operation, in order to facilitate the spectral simulation (which assumes the total spin density is 1 and provides the relative population of each component).\nOptional: For most spectral simulation software, a normalized spectrum is ideal for obtaining the correct relative population in a multi-component spectrum as well as the precise dynamics parameters.\nCenter each spectrum. The center field of a spectrum is reset so that the integrated areas on both sides of the center field are equal.\nLoad a pre-processed spectrum into the “Multi-component” program (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) available at https://sites.google.com/site/altenbach/labview-programs/epr-programs?authuser=0[href=https://sites.google.com/site/altenbach/labview-programs/epr-programs?authuser=0].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. The user interface of Multi-component when loading an experimental data set\nA window dialog will pop-up so that the experimental data can be selected from a file location (click the “Load Data” as highlighted by the red circle).\nOptional: EasySpin (Stoll) and the MOMD program (Freed; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) can also be used for simulation since these programs share the same principle (Stoll and Schweiger, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]; Zhang et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]; Pan et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).",
    "Set up the initial fitting parameters. Usually, we encounter a relative mobile and an immobile spectral component for enzymes encapsulated in mesoporous materials. Therefore, at least two components are needed to fit the experimental data. In rare cases, 3–4 components are also possible.\nActivate two components (out of the four components available in the program; Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) by switching the “Component” under A and B to “Enabled” (while keeping components C and D “Disabled”). Usually we define component A as the spectrum contributed by enzyme in contact with (or immobilized on) the MOF/COF, while component B as the non-contact (or mobile) one.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Activating two components while keeping the rest “disabled”\nAll parameters allowed to vary are highlighted by the red rectangle on the right.\nOptional: In rare cases such as more than two “mobile” motions of the protein labeled site, three components can be used.\nCritical: Each tensor under columns A and B are defined by “set 0” to “set 3”. “set 0” indicates the first set of a tensor in the “Tensors” Tab. “set 1” indicates the second set. “set 1” does not necessarily stand for component B. For example, for the W tensor (linewidth tensor), both components A and B share “set 0”, the same W tensor.",
    "Switch to the “Tensors” tab. Input the initial “guesses” of the g- and hyperfine-tensors: gxx=2.0078, gyy=2.0058, gzz=2.0023 for both “im” and “m” components; Axx= 5.7 G, Ayy=6.0 G, for both “im” and “m” components (“im”=”immobilized” and “m”=”mobilized”); Azz=34.5 and 37.5 G, typical for hydrophobic and hydrophilic local environment, for the “im” and “m” components, respectively (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). These initial values are obtained from extensive simulations of many spectra and are usually good “guesses” to initiate the simulation. These variables will be optimized during the simulation. Allow Azz to be varied during the simulation by activating the green light after each Azz.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Setting up the g and A tensors\nAn activated green light after a variable means this variable is allowed to be varied during the fitting (see red arrow labeled by “Vary”). Inactivated green light (see red arrow labeled by “Fix”) means the variable cannot be varied during the fitting.\nIn the rate “R Tensor” (due to anisotropy, see above), the R values instead of the actual effective correlation time, τi, of R1 diffusion are the input, wherein 1/6R = τi. The R tensor is defined in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B where the average constant (third column of the R Tensor with “1,2,3” labeled), R1 is (Rx + Ry + Rz)/3, R2 is Rz – (Rx – Ry)/2, and R3 is Rx – Ry. For our case, where an axial symmetry is assumed, R1 and R2 are non-zero. The average rate constants, R1, of 6.00 and 8.00 are often input for the “im” and “m” components, respectively, with −0.5 to account for the anisotropic motion of both components, R2 (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Allow R0 and R1 to vary during the simulation by activating the green light after each tensor component.",
    "Next, key ordering parameters need to be put in (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). A restoring (ordering) potential (U) is used to calculate the spatial constraints of the spin label within the “cone”. The potential U(θ) = −1/2kBTc02 (3cos2θ - 1) + H.O.T., where c02 is a scaling coefficient and H.O.T. represents higher order terms. The spatial ordering of the diffusion tensor, S, can be computed following Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B. In our simulations, only the dominant term and the first H.O.T. term were involved, leading to the order parameters, S20 and S22, in our simulation, which can be computed from the C20 and C22 coefficients (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). For the “im” component, due to the strong contact of the label with some species (ca. surface of mesopores), typical initial C20 and C22 are ∼40 and ∼−40, respectively. For the “m” component, we find that 5 and −5 respectively are usually good initial guesses. Allow these C parameters to vary during the simulation by activating the green light after each.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Setting up the parameters of spatial ordering and key Euler angels\nThe tilt of the diffusion tensor with respect to the molecular axis of the nitroxide is specified by the Euler angles (αD, βD, γD). For axially symmetric motion, only βD and γD need be specified. For z-axis anisotropic motion, the diffusion tilt was at βD = 36°, γD = 0°. βD is allowed to be altered during the simulation. If βD = 36° does not provide a reasonable fit, switch βD to 90° and initiate the fitting again.\nFit.\nFitting emphasis. Usually the low-field region of the spectrum is the most informative area; thus, the central peak is weighted by 50% (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

Typical interface of fitting\nTroubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nData interpretation: determine enzyme orientation\nTiming: varies\nThis major step is to summarize the general concept of how to determine enzyme relative orientation in a porous material based on EPR simulation. The principle is applicable to enzymes adsorbed on other surfaces.\nDetermine the regions of an enzyme that contact a porous material.\nIn most mesopores, enzymes tend to display a relatively random orientation with some preference (instead of a uniform orientation). The relative population of the contact or immobile spectral component with respect to the mobile one represents the chance for the labeled site to contact a solid surface.\nScanning multiple enzyme surface sites can, therefore, lead to the regions of the enzyme that are favored to contact the solids.\nData interpretation: Determine enzyme dynamics\nTiming: varies",
    "This major step is to extract additional dynamic information, in addition to the relative population, in order to provide deeper insights into enzyme behavior on MOFs/COFs.\nOrdering and rate parameters of the contact component.\nThe ordering parameters, C20 and C22, of the immobile component indicate the relative spatial restriction of the spin label sidechain at the contact site. The smaller the ordering parameters, the less restricted the contact. This is an indication of the relative packing density of the MOF.\nThe rate parameter reflects the dynamics of the label at the contact site. The more dynamic the enzyme, and therefore, the more active likely for the enzyme.\nPossible spin exchange interactions.\nSpin exchange interaction can occur due to the conjugated structure of the building blocks of the MOFs and COFs. A line broadening with reduced spectral intensity at the low field peak and enhanced/symmetric center peak is a clear indication of spin exchange interaction between the labeled enzyme and the MOF/COF materials.\nIn the presence of spin exchange, the regular Multi-component spectral simulation cannot provide reasonable fits. Instead, a few spectral features can be used to quantify the exchange interaction.\nExample data with strong spin exchange are shown in Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A middle and right panel.(Sun et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]) The relative peak intensity of the low-field peak versus the central line (I0/(Icp+Icn)) as well as the positive and negative peaks of the central peak (Icp/Icn; Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B) can quantitatively assess the relative strength of the spin exchange interaction. The smaller the I0/(Icp+Icn), the stronger the exchange; the closer the Icp/Icn to 1, the more symmetric the central peak, and the stronger the spin exchange.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/824-Fig15.jpg\nFigure 15.
