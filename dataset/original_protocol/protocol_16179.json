    "In this protocol, we describe an easy and cost-effective approach to generate cerebral organoids using a guided protocol modified from Yoon et al. (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0034]). Cerebral organoids are obtained through sequential use of small molecules (SMAD inhibitors) and growth factors to obtain cell types normally present in the dorsal forebrain. This guided approach reduces variability in cell composition between organoids, which can be observed with unguided protocols, and increases consistency in subsequent assays using the organoids. This protocol starts from human iPSCs in culture and generates embryoid bodies that are progressively differentiated into cerebral organoids. With longer times in culture, neurons in cerebral organoids progressively acquire a more mature neuronal phenotype with robust electrophysiological properties. Notably, glial cells (astrocytes) also progressively appear in cerebral organoids. This protocol is fully scalable to obtain the desired number of cerebral organoids for neurotoxicity assays.\nMaterials\nHuman iPSCs (e.g., ATCC, cat. no.

When iPSCs are ready to passage, remove culture medium, and wash once with 2 ml DPBS per well for a 6-well plate or 10 ml DPBS for a 10-cm dish.\n2. Add 0.5 ml Accutase to each well, and incubate 5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nPrepare 10-ml aliquots of Accutase, and store at −20°C. Thaw overnight at −4°C before use.\n3. Transfer dissociated cells into a sterile 15-ml centrifuge tube, and add three times the amount of prewarmed E8 medium.\nFor example, if one well is dissociated with 0.5 ml Accutase, add 1.5 ml prewarmed E8 medium for a total of 2 ml.\nPrepare sufficient aliquots of E8 medium for 2 weeks’ worth of culture, and store aliquots at −20°C. Thaw aliquots the night before use at 4°C.\n4. Centrifuge 4 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n5. Remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet, and resuspend pellet in 1 ml prewarmed E8 medium.

Distribute 100 µl cell suspension in each well of a 96-well ultralow-attachment, U-bottom plate using a multichannel pipette.\nThis will result in initial embryoid bodies of 10,000 cells. The number of wells can be scaled up or down depending on the number of organoids to obtain.\n8. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2, and leave undisturbed for 24 hr.\nNeural induction (days 0 to 24)\n9.

Thaw aliquots the night before use at 4°C.\n11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 every day until day 6.\n12. On day 6, transfer four to eight organoids to each well of a 6-well, ultralow-attachment plate. To transfer organoids without destroying them, cut the tip of a 1000-µl pipette tip, and use it to transfer organoids individually.\n13. Remove culture medium that was transferred with the organoids, and replace with prewarmed neural medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF and 20 ng/ml EGF.\n14. Place plate on an orbital shaker at 65 rpm inside a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n15. Replace medium daily from days 7 to 15 and then every other day from days 16 to 24.\nNeural differentiation (from day 25)\n16. Starting on day 25, replace medium every other day with neural medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml neurotrophin-3.\n17. On day 43, replace medium with neural medium without growth factor supplements. Change medium every 3 to 4 days (twice a week) until the desired time point.\nIf the medium in some wells becomes too acidic (yellow coloration due to phenol red in the medium), decrease the number of organoids per well or change the medium more frequently. Organoids may fuse during culture. Fusion does not impair organoid development but reduces the total number of organoids obtained. To avoid this, decrease the number of organoids per well, and make sure to gently swirl the plate to distribute organoids within the well before placing the plate back in the incubator.\nFigure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-fig-0002] shows an example of successful cerebral organoid formation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/424afc28-9910-453c-9e2c-51f1006ff40a/cpz1744-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>",

    "Human PSCs are the starting material for human cerebral organoids. PSCs can be derived from established embryonic stem cell lines (e.g., H9 cell line) or obtained via reprogramming of somatic cells (e.g., fibroblasts), using different methods that are outside of the scope of this article, to generate iPSCs. The use of iPSCs to prepare human cerebral organoids is particularly interesting to investigate the effect of a compound on cells with a specific genetic mutation. The quality of PSCs and their pluripotency potential (ability to generate every cell type in an organism) is critical to successfully obtaining cerebral organoids. Indeed, if the stem cells used have already started to differentiate into any specific lineage, then some intermediate neural precursors may not be observed, or cerebral organoids may not form. Of note, PSCs can lose their pluripotency during culture through a variety of factors such as cellular stress or mycoplasma infection, among other ways. This protocol describes the culture of human iPSCs using a feeder-free system (no layer of feeder cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts) and the maintenance of their pluripotency.\nMaterials\nGeltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Place aliquot on ice, and dilute 60 µl in 3 ml cold DMEM (1:100 [v/v] final). Transfer 1 ml solution into each well of a 6-well plate, or transfer 4 ml into a 10-cm dish. Incubate plates/dishes at 37°C for 1 hr. Use immediately, or store at 4°C for up to 1 week.\n2. Thaw a vial of iPSCs in a 37°C bead bath until a small piece of ice remains in the vial.\n3. Transfer vial contents to a 15-ml conical tube. Add 9 ml warmed E8 medium, and centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n4.

    "10. Add 1 ml of 0.5 mM EDTA, and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nColonies should start to round up and have small cell-free areas inside them where cells have already detached.\n11.

Pipette up and down briefly to detach cells, avoiding the creation of bubbles.\nIf cells have substantially detached before removing EDTA, incubate at room temperature. If cells do not detach with gentle pipetting or if a lot of cells are still attached, increase incubation time to ≥7 min. The goal is to obtain clusters of cells, not a single-cell suspension.\n12.

    "Some neurotoxic compounds can cause brain malformations by altering the formation of new neurons during brain development, a process known as neurogenesis. New neurons are formed from neural stem cells that have the ability to differentiate into neurons and proliferate for self-renewal (Kriegstein & Alvarez-Buylla, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0014]). Maintenance of an appropriate number in this pool of neural stem cells is critical to normal brain development because dysregulation of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation results in abnormal brain function and is the cause of several neurological disorders (Duy et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0005]; Krahe et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0013]; Lancaster et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0016]; Lipton & Sahin, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0018]; Wang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0031]). Therefore, evaluating the effect of compounds on neurogenesis is an important step in evaluating their neurotoxicity. Neurogenesis can be assessed in organoids by “tagging” proliferating cells using a thymidine analogue such as EdU and determining their differentiation at a later time point using coimmunostaining with cell-type specific markers. This protocol describes the different steps from incubating organoids with EdU (“pulse”) and evaluating neurogenesis after a desired period of time (“chase”). The duration of the pulse and chase can be manipulated to address different research questions related to the rate of proliferation and duration of cell cycle (short chase period) or the fate of the tagged cells (longer chase period).\nMaterials\nClick-iT EdU cell proliferation kit (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Dilute 10 mM EdU into prewarmed neural medium to obtain a 40 µM EdU solution.\nPrepare a volume equal to half the culture medium of the organoids.\n3. At the selected time point, remove half the medium from organoids in each well, and add an equal amount of 40 μM EdU to obtain a 20 µM EdU solution.\nReplacing half the medium helps prevent the temporary decrease in cell proliferation and therefore EdU incorporation seen with complete medium change.\n4. Incubate organoids for 2 hr at 37°C.\n5. Remove medium containing EdU, and wash organoids twice with prewarmed DPBS.\n6. Add neural medium without EdU, and continue incubating organoids as usual.\nThe length of this chase period depends on the research questions. When investigating proliferation, organoids can be processed for imaging immediately after the 2-hr EdU pulse. If investigating changes in differentiation, then the chase should be continued until EdU-tagged proliferating cells have differentiated, which can take several weeks. However, the longer the chase, the fainter the EdU signal will be because EdU will be diluted with each DNA replication.\nCryopreservation of organoids\n7. At the selected time point after EdU pulse, wash organoids with DPBS.\n8. Using a cut 1000-µl pipette tip, transfer each organoid to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde.\n9. Incubate at 4°C overnight.\n10. Remove paraformaldehyde and perform three 15-min washes with cold DPBS.",
    "11. Remove DPBS and add 1 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose to each microcentrifuge tube.\nThis step is performed to dehydrate the organoids before freezing.\nPrepare 30% (w/v) sucrose by mixing 30 g sucrose in 100 ml deionized water. Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. If longer storage is desired, the solution can be filter sterilized using a 0.45-µm syringe membrane filter.\n12. Incubate at 4°C until organoids have sunk to the bottom of the tube (usually overnight).\n13. Fill disposable square molds with embedding solution.\n14. Using a 1000-µl pipette with a cut tip, transfer organoids to the mold, making sure to transfer as little 30% (w/v) sucrose as possible.\n15. Prepare ethanol/dry ice slurry by adding 100% ethanol to dry ice pellets, and snap freeze organoids by placing the molds in the ethanol/dry ice slurry.\n16. Keep at −80°C until sectioning.\nImmunofluorescence staining\n17. Cut sections using a cryostat set at −20°C, and place sections on a microscope slide.\nSections can be up to 20 µm thick if using a confocal microscope; 10-µm sections can be used if using an epifluorescence microscope. Sections can be stored indefinitely at −80°C.\n18. Delineate an area around each section with a hydrophobic pen.\n19. Wash each section once with DPBS to remove the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound contained in the embedding solution.\n20. Permeabilize sections by incubating with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS for 20 min at room temperature.\n21. Remove Triton X-100, and wash sections twice with 3% (w/v) BSA in DPBS.\n22. Prepare Click-iT EdU reaction cocktail according to manufacturer's instruction. Remove 3% (w/v) BSA, and cover section with the reaction cocktail.\nAll reagents need to be at room temperature, and the order of reagent addition is important for a successful reaction.",

    "Neurotoxicity of compounds may affect neuronal excitability, which is critical for normal brain function. After stimulation of neurons by an excitatory neurotransmitter, depolarization of the stimulated neurons follows, which in turn triggers calcium influx into the depolarized neurons. This calcium signaling reflects neuronal activity both in vitro and in vivo. To measure calcium signaling in real time, neurons can be incubated with fluorescent calcium indicators that undergo an increase in fluorescence when binding calcium. By measuring this calcium-associated fluorescence in real time with a fluorescence microscope, calcium imaging allows researchers to follow neuronal activity at a single-cell resolution and assess the effect of certain compounds on neuronal activity. This protocol describes the use of a fluorescent calcium indicator, Fluo-4 AM, with cerebral organoids to measure changes in neuronal activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker. The data acquired by following this protocol will enable the investigator to characterize changes in calcium signaling such as changes in transient amplitude, frequency, and synchronization.\nMaterials\nDMSO (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "The frequency depends on the process under study. Ideally, a sampling frequency twice the frequency of the calcium waves under study is needed to allow sufficient temporal resolution to capture the kinetics of the calcium waves. A slower frequency allows for better image resolution but worse time resolution. Calcium waves triggered by neuronal excitation and detected by Fluo-4 AM are several seconds long, and therefore a frequency of 2 Hz is acceptable. The length of the time series is determined by individual experimental needs and the available memory of the computer running the microscope software. Recordings of 3 to 5 min are usually performed. An example of a calcium imaging recording is given in Video S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-fig-0007] (in Supporting Information).\n8.

Add ROI to the measurements by using the ROI manager tool (Analyze → Tools → ROI Manager).\n14. Save ROI and export ROI on the time series.\n15. Measure mean intensity for each ROI on each image (More → Multi-measure).\nThis will give you a matrix with each column representing each neuron (as well as one column for the background) and each row representing a time point.\n16.

ΔF can be plotted over time, and individual neuron peak frequency, amplitude, and duration can be determined before and after stimulation by 4-AP depending on the research question.\nPrograms allowing automated analysis of calcium imaging are also available (Giovannucci et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0009]; Pnevmatikakis, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0024]; Romano et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0027]).\nFor information about sample data, see Understanding Results.",
    "To assess the neurotoxicity of a compound, it is often necessary to study its effect on neuronal activity. As seen in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-prot-0004], neuronal activity can be measured at the single-cell level with calcium imaging. Despite its high spatial resolution, calcium imaging typically only records the activity of a limited number of cells and with a low time resolution (around 2 Hz). Conversely, acquiring electrophysiological recordings of neuronal local field potentials with MEAs offers high time resolution (up to 12.5 kHz) and the ability to record different regions of the organoids. This allows for the measurement of a compound's effects on neuronal network connectivity within the organoid by assessing synchronization of activity recorded by different electrodes. MEA recording therefore offers a complementary approach to calcium imaging. As organoids can be grown directly onto the MEA or placed on the MEA before recording, longitudinal recordings throughout organoid maturation can be performed. This protocol describes the recording of cerebral organoids with MEAs using the Axion Maestro Edge MEA system. Data obtained through this protocol are typically analyzed by software such as MATLAB or the integrated AxIS software.\nMaterials\nPoly-L-ornithine (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Add 0.5 ml poly-L-ornithine to each well of a recording plate to cover the electrode array. Incubate at 37°C for 4 hr or at 4°C overnight.",
    "2. Dilute 1 mg/ml laminin in cold DPBS to obtain a 20 µg/ml solution (1:50 dilution). Aspirate poly-L-ornithine, and add 0.5 ml diluted laminin to cover the electrode arrays. Incubate at 37°C for 4 hr or at 4°C overnight.\nAlways dilute laminin in ice-cold DPBS to prevent gelling of the solution. Unused laminin can be aliquoted undiluted and kept at −20°C. To use, thaw laminin slowly on ice to prevent gelling.\n3. Remove laminin. Using a 1000-µl pipette with a cut tip, place organoid on the MEA.\nDo not let the laminin solution dry before adding the organoid. Laminin should be removed just before organoid transfer in each well. Add the organoid in a single drop of culture medium centered on the electrode array. This will ensure that the organoid will adhere to the electrode array. If coated plates are not used right away, they should be sealed with Parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to 1 week.\n4. Add sterile distilled water to the plate in between wells. Incubate plates with organoids at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight.\nAdding water will decrease evaporation of the culture medium.\n5. The next day, carefully add 1 ml prewarmed neural medium.\nOrganoids can easily detach from the array. Add the medium very carefully using a pipette.\n6. Replace medium as usual, handling plates with care so as not to detach organoids.",
    "Younger organoids (<4 weeks old) will adhere better than older organoids (>8 weeks old). Organoids can therefore be seeded well in advance of recording and cultured in an adherent fashion in the MEA plates. If organoids detach, recording is still possible. To ensure maximal contact between the organoid and the MEA, medium can be removed leaving only around 200 µl to prevent drying of the organoid during the recording session. Otherwise, an electrophysiology slice anchor (harp) can also be put on top of the organoids during the recording session, although some damage to the organoid would be expected.\n7. At the selected time points, place MEA plate inside the Maestro Edge recording chamber.\n8. Open AxIS software, and record in spontaneous neural configuration.\nThe length of recording sessions varies between experiments, but a good starting point is 5 to 10 min.\n9. Once the baseline recording is acquired, add 4-AP to a final concentration of 100 µM, and incubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.\n10. Repeat recording with the same parameters.\nRecorded files can be analyzed using the Axion Biosystems Neural Metrics Tool or other signal-processing software such as MATLAB or Python. Dedicated open-source toolboxes have also been developed by other laboratories (Egert et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0006]; Pastore et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-bib-0023]).",
    "Immunostaining is a common technique employed with cerebral tissue that can be applied to cerebral organoids. It allows for visualization of the location of an antigen (usually a peptide) by using specific antibodies binding to the antigen. In the case of fluorescence immunostaining, as described in this protocol, the antibodies are either bound to a fluorophore, or secondary fluorophore-bound antibodies are used to reveal the presence of the primary antibodies. By using antibodies binding to a peptide specific for a cell type (e.g., microtubule-associated protein 2 [MAP2] for neurons, SRY-box transcription factor 2 [SOX2] for neuroepithelial cells) or a phenotype (e.g., cleaved-caspase 3 for apoptotic cells), the proportion of different cell populations can be quantified and compared between treated and control organoids. Fluorescence immunostaining can also be used to characterize the spatial localization of a specific peptide within a cell. In this protocol, we describe the steps to perform fluorescence immunostaining with cerebral organoids. This protocol can be used with Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.744#cpz1744-prot-0003], which describes EdU staining in cerebral organoids.

    "This step facilitates the removal of antigen masking, which is caused by paraformaldehyde crosslinking with proteins.
