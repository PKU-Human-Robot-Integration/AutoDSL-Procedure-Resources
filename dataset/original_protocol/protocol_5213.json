    "Sample preparation and cross-linkingAt 18 h before stimulation, seed macrophages in 6-well plates containing 2 ml growth media in each well, 1 well per condition (in simplicate), at a density of 1.5 x 106 cells per well. Wash cells twice with PBS and prime cells with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2 h in 1 ml Opti-MEM.Wash cells twice with PBS, and activate inflammasome by stimulating cells with 5 μM nigericin for 30 min or 25 μM nelfinavir for 6 h or transfect for 4 h with 2 μg/ml poly(dA:dT) using Lipofectamine 2000 (use DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 in the ratio of 1 μg/2 μl) in 1 ml Opti-MEM.Optional: harvest supernatants to assess the release of mature IL-1β and caspase-1 cleavage by Western blot.Note: Proteins from the supernatants can be precipitated using methanol/chloroform. If required supernatants can be stored frozen and proteins precipitated later. Precipitated proteins resuspended in 2x protein loading buffer can also be stored frozen for further Western blotting.Detach cells by scraping in 1 ml ice cold PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend cell pellets in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer A and lyse by shearing 30 times through a 21-gauge needle in microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge lysates in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for 8 min at 1,800 x g, 4 °C to remove bulk nuclei. Keep 30 μl of lysates for Western blots of ASC as input controls.Dilute the remaining supernatants in a 1:1 ratio with buffer A and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. The dilution is required to optimize harvest.After centrifugation, collect and dilute supernatants with 1 volume of CHAPS buffer and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 8 min to pellet ASC oligomers.",
    "Discard supernatants and resuspend pellets in 50 μl of CHAPS buffer containing 4 mM of disuccinimidyl suberate (dissolved in DMSO). Incubate for 30 min at room temperature to cross-link proteins.Centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 8 min at 4 °C, discard supernatants and resuspend pellets in 30 μl of 2x protein loading buffer. Heat the samples for 2 min at 90 °C.Note: It is possible to stop at this point and freeze protein lysates at -20 °C before continuing the protocol with Western blotting steps.Western blot analysisAssemble a 15% SDS-PAGE.Note: A 15% gel with a distance of migration of 7 to 8 cm is sufficient to give a good resolution of the ASC monomers and oligomers.Load 30 μl of resuspended ASC containing pellets on the 15% SDS-PAGE. (This sample should contain the cross-linked oligomerized ASC)Add 30 μl of protein loading buffer to 30 μl of input isolated during step A6, heat the samples for 2 min at 90 °C and load 30 μl on 15% SDS-PAGE. (This sample should contain the input ASC amounts)Separate at constant 160 V until protein loading buffer reaches the end of the gel. Transfer at 80 V for 2 h using a wet transfer system.Rinse membrane with distilled water. Block membrane in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with agitation.Incubate membrane overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation with anti-ASC antibody diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer.Wash membrane 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T (each wash). Incubate for 1 h with a 1:5,000 dilution of secondary antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature with agitation.Wash membrane 3 times for 10 min with PBS-T (each wash). Remove excess of PBS-T.Incubate with ECL and proceed to detection of chemiluminescence."
