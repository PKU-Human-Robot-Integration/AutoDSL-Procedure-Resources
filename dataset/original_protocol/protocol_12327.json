    "1. Prepare Activated Human T Cells\nCollect 10 ml heparinized whole blood from a donor by venipuncture.\n\t\nObtain informed consent of donors in advance of venipuncture. Venipuncture must be done by qualified and trained personnel.\nHandle obtained blood samples with sterile equipment and following appropriate biosafety guidelines.\nDilute 10 ml heparinized whole blood with 10 ml D-PBS(–).\nPut 15 ml Ficoll solution (Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM) into a new 50-ml conical tube.\nLayer the 20-ml blood solution prepared in Step 1.2 onto the Ficoll solution in Step 1.3. Using an electric pipette, let blood solution prepared in Step 1.2 run slowly along the inside wall of tube. Be careful not to mix the blood solution and Ficoll solution.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 30 min at RT. Set the centrifugal deceleration speed to “slow”.\n\tNote: After centrifugation, a white thin layer emerges between an upper milky plasma layer and a lower clear Ficoll layer. This white thin layer contains mononuclear cells.\nTransfer the mononuclear cell layer to a new 50-ml conical tube with a 1-ml pipette. Be careful not to include Ficoll solution.\nAdd D-PBS(–) to the mononuclear cells to a total volume of 10 ml, and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant. Add 10 ml of D-PBS(–) to the mononuclear cells, and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 1 ml of KBM502 medium to the collected mononuclear cells, and count the cells using a hemocytometer. Over 5 × 106 mononuclear cells can be obtained from 10 ml heparinized whole blood with appropriate separation using Ficoll.",
    "Prepare an anti-human CD3 antibody solution at a concentration of 10 µg/ml in D-PBS(–). Add the anti-human CD3 antibody solution to a 6-well plate, soak the surface of each well, and incubate the dish at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for at least 30 min.\nRemove the anti-human CD3 antibody solution from each well and wash once with D-PBS(–) just prior to seeding the cells.\nSeed mononuclear cells that were prepared in Step 1.9 at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 on the anti-human CD3 antibody-coated 6-well plates in KBM502 medium. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator for 3–7 days without medium change until the T cells reach confluency. T cells in this period are both suspended and adhering cells.\n2. Infect Human T Cells with SeV Vectors\nAfter 3–7 days culture, collect the activated T cells with existing medium by pipetting. Transfer them to a 15-ml conical tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 ml fresh KBM502 medium. Count the cells and plate 1.5 × 106 cells (in 2 ml fresh KBM502 medium) into each well of an anti-CD3 antibody-coated 6-well plate.\nThaw the SeV solutions of OCT3/4-SeV/TSΔF, SOX2-SeV/TSΔF, KLF4-SeV/TSΔF, and c-MYC (HNL)-SeV/TS15ΔF on ice.\nAdd the SeV solutions containing OCT3/4-SeV/TSΔF, SOX2-SeV/TSΔF, KLF4-SeV/TSΔF, and c-MYC (HNL)-SeV/TS15ΔF individually to the wells, each at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator for a further 24 hr.\n3. Remove SeV Vectors from Human T Cells",
    "24 hr after infection, collect the infected cells with a pipette. If there are adhering cells, they can easily be detached pipetting them repeatedly up and down. Transfer them to a 15-ml conical tube, and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant containing the SeV vectors, and add 2 ml fresh KBM502 medium. Replate cells in each of the wells. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator for an additional 24 hr.\n4. Reseed Cells on a Matrigel Layer\nPrepare basement membrane matrix solution by thawing matrix gel (please see the Materials List for the specific brand used in this study) at 4 °C and dissolving 0.2 ml in 10 ml of DMEM/F12 medium.\n\tNote: Matrix gel (please see the Materials List for the specific brand used in this study) needs to thaw O/N at 4 °C to be completely thawed. Keep it on ice until just before use.\nPlate 5 ml basement membrane matrix solution per dish into 100-mm dishes and leave at RT for at least 30 min before seeding cells. At least two 100-mm dishes are needed for one experiment.\nCollect SeV-infected cells by pipetting, transfer them to a 15-ml conical tube, and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 ml fresh KBM502 medium. Count the number of cells using a hemocytometer, remove the basement membrane matrix solution from 100-mm dishes prepared in Step 4.2 and plate 1 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells (in 10 ml fresh mTeSR medium) on a 100-mm basement membrane matrix-coated dishes. Finally, use the plate in which colonies are easily picked.\nIncubate the dish at 37 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator O/N.\nChange the medium to 10 ml flesh mTeSR medium every other day.",
    "Note: Approximately 20–30 days after infection, colonies that closely resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) will appear.\n5. Expand T Cell-derived iPSCs\nPrepare basement membrane matrix solution by thawing matrix gel (please see the Materials List for the specific brand used in this study) at 4 °C and dissolving 0.2 ml in 10 ml of DMEM/F12 medium.\nPlate 1 ml of the basement membrane matrix solution per well in a 6-well plate and leave at RT for at least 30 min before picking colonies.\nFill a 96-well plate with 20 µl of mTeSR medium per well.\nSelect colonies that resemble ESCs under the stereomicroscope using a 20 µl pipette.\n\tNote: The colonies of ESCs and iPSCs are round and flat as shown in Figure 1B.\nTransfer selected colonies into the 96-well plate filled with mTeSR medium in Step 5.3.\nAdd 200 µl of mTeSR medium to each well and carefully pipette up and down to break the colony into small clumps under the stereomicroscope using a 200 µl pipette. Remove the basement membrane matrix solution from the well prepared in 5.2 and put each colony into one well of the basement membrane matrix-coated 6-well plate with 2 ml of mTeSR medium per well.\nChange the medium to 2 ml flesh mTeSR medium every other day.\n6. Maintain T Cell-derived iPSCs\nThe T cell-derived iPSCs can be maintained and stored using the same techniques as for human iPSCs and human ESCs. Once iPSC colonies grow up, expand them into larger dishes by repeating the same procedure.\nChange the mTeSR medium every 1–2 days.\nWhen the colonies become confluent every 5–7 days, passage the cells using dissociation solution for human iPSCs and human ESCs according to the manufacturer’s instructions."
