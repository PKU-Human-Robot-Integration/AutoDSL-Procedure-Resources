    "NOTE: A schematic overview is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Sample collection\nObtain oyster specimens. Keep oysters on ice during the postharvest period, the transport and prior to laboratory use and process within 4-7 days after purchase.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, oysters were purchased from Zhong Cai Wholesale Market in Nanjing (originating from Ningde, Fujian, China and Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China), Haijie Aquatic Product Company in Qingdao (originating from Qingdao, Shandong, China), Jucheng Aquatic Product Company in Yantai (originating from Yantai, Shandong, China) and Jinxiu Aquatic Product Company in Qingdao (originating from Qingdao, Shandong, China)).\n2. RNA isolation by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol extraction\nPreparation of oyster tissue sample\n\t\nCut out approximately 100 mg of homogeneous soft tissue from the approximate geometric center of each oyster specimen with a sterilized scalpel, and transfer the samples into liquid nitrogen.\nEuthanize the remaining part of the oysters by freezing at -80 °C for 1 h and discard as biological waste.\nGrind the flash-frozen oyster tissue into a fine powder in a mortar (200 mL) filled with 50 mL of liquid nitrogen.\nWeigh out 75 mg of each specimen’s frozen tissue into a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and mix with 1 mL of the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol extraction reagent. Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, add 200 µL of chloroform and mix thoroughly by using a vortex mixer for 10-15 s until the mixture turns milky-white.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min, and transfer the upper aqueous layer carefully with a 200 µL pipette without disturbing the interphase into a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.",
