    "1. Gel preparation\nSilanization of the gel support\n\t\nActivate the coverslip or glass-bottom Petri dish (which will be used as gel support) with a UV lamp for 2 min (wait 30 s before exposure to the UV lamp to avoid exposure to residual ozone).\nSilanize the coverslip/glass-bottom dish using 200 µL aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for 5 min. This will prepare the support for the covalent binding of the gel.\nThoroughly wash the coverslip/glass-bottom dish with ultra-pure water.\nDry the coverslip/glass-bottom dish using vacuum aspiration.\nPreparation of the 18mm coverslip used to flatten the gel\n\t\nTo prepare the coverslips, first put them into a ceramic coverslip holder. Then put the coverslip holder into a small beaker (50 mL) and pour siliconizing reagent (stored at 4 °C, reusable) over the coverslips, being sure to completely cover them.\nCover the beaker with aluminum foil and incubate for 3 min at room temperature. While waiting, fill a large beaker (500 mL) with ultra-pure water. After 3 min of incubation in siliconizing reagent, transfer the coverslip holder with coverslips to the beaker of water.\nThoroughly rinse the coverslips with ultra-pure water, dry them well and keep on paper wipes. For best results, proceed immediately to the next section. \nGel polymerization\n\t\nFor gels of 0.5 kPa, mix 75 µL of 40% acrylamide with 30 µL of 2% bisacrylamide (crosslinker) and 895 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This premix can be stored for up to one month at 4 °C.\nTo 167 µL of 0.5 kPa gel premix, add 1% (1.67 µL) of beads, vortex and sonicate for 5 min in a bath sonicator (standard bench ultrasonic cleaner with power of 50–100 W and frequency 40 kHz). Keep the mix protected from light using aluminum foil.\n\t\tNOTE: The premix does not polymerize until the initiator (TEMED) is added.",
    "To catalyze polymerization, add 1% (1.67 µL) of 10% w/v ammonium persulfate (APS).\nTo initiate polymerization, add 0.1% (0.2 µL) N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). Mix with a pipette. Once APS and TEMED have been added, the gel rapidly polymerizes so proceed quickly to gel casting.\nGel casting\n\t\nPipet 9 µL of gel mix onto each coverslip/glass-bottom dish (drop in the center, Figure 1A)\nPlace the silanized/hydrophobic coverslip and flatten the gel (Figure 1B). Using forceps, press the coverslip to ensure the gel spreads across the entire area of the coverslip (Figure 1C) until it starts leaking out.\nInvert the coverslip/glass-bottom dish into a large Petri dish and tap it on the bench to force beads going towards the gel surface (Figure 1D).\nCover with aluminum foil and leave for 1 h to polymerize at room temperature in a humid chamber (i.e., put a wet tissue above the dish to prevent evaporation).\nAfter 1 h, add PBS to the sample to facilitate coverslip release. Carefully, remove the coverslip using a needle (the coating with different silanes should allow easy peeling off of the coverslip from the gel, Figure 1E).\nLeave the gel in PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Gels can now be stored in PBS at 4 °C for 5–7 days, but it is recommended to use them within 48 h.\n2. Gel functionalization\nPrepare sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (Sulfo SANPAH) solution at 0.5 mg/mL in 10 mM HEPES buffer. This can be stored at 4 °C covered with aluminum foil for up to one week.\nAspirate the PBS from gels.\nAdd 150 µL of Sulfo SANPAH to the gel at room temperature (Figure 1F).\nExpose the gel to UV treatment for 2 min to photoactivate the sites of Sulfo SANPAH and make it stick to the gel surface.\nWash with PBS three times (Figure 1G).",
    "Repeat steps 2.2–2.5.\nAdd 250 µL of HEL (100 µg/mL) to each gel and incubate overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C overnight while keeping covered with aluminum foil (Figure 1H).\nRemove HEL antigen and wash with PBS three times.\n\tNOTE: HEL acts both as an antigen and as an adhesion molecule. It can be replaced by other molecules that bind to the receptor (e.g., an anti-mouse IgM, Bovine Serum Albumin, Ovalbumin) or mixed with integrin ligands (e.g., ICAM1 binding to LFA1). If needed, antigen extraction can be observed with a fluorescent version of the HEL (obtained by staining the molecule with a protein labeling kit, see step 4). Note that a given concentration in bulk might not yield the same surface concentration on the gel as on the glass: this needs to be quantified with secondary staining if direct comparison is required.\n3. Cell loading and imaging\nBefore imaging, remove PBS from the gels and add 500 µL of B cell media (RPMI 1640, 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 2% Sodium Pyruvate, 50uM Mercaptoethanol and 1X Non Essential Amino Acids) and let them to equilibrate to RT.\nCell preparation\n\t\nPurify primary B cells from spleen according to a negative selection protocol (see Table of Materials). Typical final B cell yield is around 1 x 107 cells. Concentrate this to 3 x 106 cells/mL in B cell medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 0.1% mercaptoethanol and 2% sodium pyruvate).\nStore cells as needed for up to 6 h at 4 °C.\nKeep the cells at 37 °C for 30 min before image acquisition.\nImaging\n\t\nUse a confocal microscope with thermal and (possibly) CO2 control.",
    "NOTE: Regardless of whether a confocal or spinning-disk microscope is used, it is important to use an objective/pinhole that allows a pixel size <200 nm to comfortably track the beads in the analysis phase (e.g., 60x, NA 1.3). Epifluorescence microscopy can also be used, however it provides lower signal to noise ratio and may make individual bead tracking harder.\nTwo main layers of beads will appear on the bottom and the top of the gel. Focus on the gel plane.\n\t\tNOTE: A nice gel will appear as a starry sky, with beads approximately uniformly distributed on the same plane.\nProgram the acquisition for 30 min with a frame rate of 5 s (this is adaptable to the needs of the experiment, e.g., acquire other colors, acquire z stack, etc.)\nAspirate the media from the gel, leaving about 200 µL of media on the gel. Position the gel on the microscope and find the surface layer of beads and a nice even area on the gel.\nAdd 80 µL of cells (avoid touching the gel to maintain focus).\nEnsure that the focus is still correct and that cells can be seen descending in the area (under transmitted light). Launch the acquisition before the cells reach the gel.\nIn case of accidental contact with gel, vibrations, or focus drift, adjust the focus.\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial to collect an image of the relaxed gel and this can be any image taken before the arrival of the cells on the gel.\n4. Fluorescent HEL extraction experiment\nPrepare fluorescent HEL by binding a fluorescent dye (of a color different from the beads one such as Alexa 555), see the Table of Materials.\nIn step 2.7, replace conventional HEL with the fluorescent HEL.",
    "Acquire images with low illumination settings or low frame rate (e.g., 2 frames per minute) to avoid photo-bleaching.\nTo quantify HEL extraction, compute the intensity integrated over the cell area for each frame I(t) corrected and normalized by the intensity I(0) of frame 0 according to the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60947/60947eq1.jpg\n\tNOTE: The antigen conjugated with a fluorophore is not visible (probably due to quenching of the fluorophore at the gel surface), but its presence on the gel can be verified with an anti-HEL and a fluorescent secondary antibody. It can be verified that the fluorophore is indeed fluorescent when detached by stripping it from the gel with a coverslip coated with anti-HEL and revealing it with a secondary fluorescent antibody (on the coverslip)6. The signal of the extracted antigen is very dim and is sometimes masked by leaking of the beads. If one is interested only in antigen extraction, it is recommended to prepare the gel without beads (skip steps 1.3.2 and 1.4.3).\n5. Fluorescence imaging\nObtain fluorescent B cells by purifying B cell from the spleens of genetically modified mice as done for the wild type (e.g., from Lifeact-GFP or Myosin II GFP mice).\nFor imaging fluorescent cells, use (if possible) a spinning disk microscope with a water immersion long-distance 40x–100x objective.\nKeep exposure duration and frame rate low to avoid bleaching.\n\tNOTE: The point spread function in Z is highly degraded by the presence of the gel, hence we suggest using a water immersion objective. Live upright microscopy with water-dipping objectives suffers from strong spherical aberrations induced by the presence of the (spherical) cell (and cell nucleus) in the emission path.\n6. Analysis",
    "NOTE: Data analysis is in general performed by first correcting the whole stack for drift, finding the beads in each frame, tracking their movements with respect to a reference frame (taken in absence of cells), interpolating the displacement field and inverting the problem to obtain the stress using Fourier transform29. To this end, we suggest using a combination of ImageJ Macro and MATLAB programs downloadable from an online repository30.\nOpen the movie in ImageJ as stack of images\nRun the macro “Crop_and_save.ijm”\n\t\nSelect the regions of interest (ROI) with the “Rectangle” tool and add them to the ROI list using the ‘t’ key.\nWhen cropping the cell, be sure to include a region of at least 5–10 pixels of immobile beads. Exclude cells that are too close to the boundaries or to other cells from the analysis. When finished click on ‘OK’.\nThe macro proposes a mask of the cell: if this is satisfactory click on “OK”. If not satisfactory, click on “Not ok” and then manually select a closed region with any selection tool (e.g. “Freehand” or “Oval”) and click on “Continue”.\nOpen MATLAB and run “TFM_v1.m”.\n\t\nInput the required parameters: in particular check the image properties (pixel size, time interval of acquisition) and the gel properties (Young modulus E, Poisson ratio).\nThe reference image is set to be the first by default. Set it to another frame if needed or set it to “0” to load an external file.",
    "Locate the outputs of the software in the same directory as the original file (for a description see the User_notice.pdf file). This includes a preliminary track of the beads (“FILENAME.fig”), a plot of the contractile energy over time (“FILENAME_energy.fig”), a table of several quantities integrated over the cell (energy, area, moments, etc) “FILENAME_finaltable.mat”, a structure containing the displacement and force field, movies of the bead, displacement field, stress and energy (that can be opened with any avi reader).\n\t\tNOTE: In the input parameters, the “Window size” is the window over which the displacement is interpolated, hence the final resolution of the stress and displacement field. This is set to a few (by default four) pixels. It is not advisable to reduce this as it would artificially increase the resolution by interpolating regions where there are no beads."
