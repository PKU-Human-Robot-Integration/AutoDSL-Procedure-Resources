    "NOTE: Experiments involving human subjects did not involve the collection of identifiable private information related to the individual's health status and are only used here for technological demonstration. Data were averaged over three different subjects. The electrophysiological recordings were extracted from previously published data6,21.\n1. Inkjet-printed PEDOT:PSS electrode fabrication\nNOTE: The following protocol has been used to fabricate electrodes for electrophysiology on commercial, flexible substrates-tattoo paper6 and textile21. The same approach has been largely adopted to make electrodes on flexible substrates such as thin plastic foils22. In all cases, an inkjet printer was used for the patterning of PEDOT:PSS (see the Table of Materials).\nElectrode substrate preprocessing\n\t\nCut a piece of the substrate of interest.\n\t\t\nWhen using a tattoo substrate, wash it with water before printing to remove the topmost, water-soluble layer from the paper23.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The tattoo paper kit is also provided with a glue sheet used in this work, both to enhance the tattoo adhesion and as a passivation layer. Tattoo paper has a layered structure (Supplemental Figure S1), including a supporting paper sheet, a water-soluble polyvinylalcohol (PVA) layer, a releasable polyurethane film, and a topmost PVA layer. The glue sheet has a layered structure composed of silicone paper as the support, water-based acrylic glue, and a top release liner.\nTo fabricate wearable sensors, start cutting the substrate of interest. Place the substrate on the printer plate, taping its border to keep it flat.\nPrinting of PEDOT:PSS ink\n\t\nPrepare the design to print, such as a circle (12 mm diameter) with a rectangular pad at the bottom (3 mm x 7 mm), the latter to be used for the interconnection.\nFill the printer cartridges (10 pl) with the PEDOT:PSS commercial ink after filtering it. This is an aqueous dispersion of the conductive polymer.",
    "Print the design on the substrate.\n\t\t\nWhen using tattoo paper and textile, which have moderate-high surface energy and absorbing properties, respectively, print with a drop spacing of ~20 µm.\nPrint multiple PEDOT:PSS layers, either consecutively or by applying a drying process (110 °C for 15 min) between the layers to create a homogeneous and continuous conductive pattern.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This is especially required in the case of textile electrodes, where the 3D-like structure of textiles requires more ink content to create a continuous conductive path within the fabric.\nDry the electrode at 110 °C for 15 min in the oven to complete solvent evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: Electrodes obtained on textile, PET, and tattoo paper (Figure 1A-C) by printing multiple devices in one run (Figure 1D) can now be stored in a closed, clean, and dry environment before continuing with the next steps.\nExternal connector fabrication\n\t\nTattoo electrodes\n\t\t\nCut a rectangular piece of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate (8 mm x 12 mm, 1.3 mm thickness).\nPrint a rectangular design (3 mm x 12 mm) with three PEDOT:PSS layers on top of the substrate.\nDry the printed sample in the oven at 110 °C for 15 min.\nLaminate the PEN interconnection onto the tattoo electrode, with the PEDOT:PSS rectangular parts facing each other.\nCut a hole (diameter 11.3 mm) in the tattoo paper glue sheet. Align this hole of the glue sheet with the circular sensing part of the tattoo PEDOT:PSS electrode. Add a piece of polyimide tape (see the Table of Materials) onto the free end of the PEN interconnection.\nTextile and plastic foil electrodes\n\t\t\nAttach a piece of conductive tape (e.g., copper tape) around the rectangular printed connection to obtain a robust and stable interconnection.",
    "Plug a pogo pin connector into the copper tape and connect the pogo pin to the recording system.\nTattoo electrode transfer\n\t\nRemove the glue liner. Place the tattoo onto the desired portion of the skin.\nWet the back support paper, keeping the tattoo in position. Once the back support paper is soaked, slide it to remove it, leaving only the electrode made of the transferable ultrathin film on the skin.\nPlug the flat PEN contact into the external acquisition unit. See section 1.3.\nTextile electrode positioning\n\t\nPlace the electrode on the skin. With the help of a fabric sports bracelet or medical tape, keep the electrode in stable contact with the skin to ensure high-quality signal recordings during movement.\nPerform the desired surface electrophysiological recording. Wash the tattoo electrodes away after the recordings by rubbing them with a wet sponge.\n2. Electrode characterization using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy\nOn-body measurement\n\t\nEnsure that the volunteer is comfortably seated with an arm placed on a table at rest.\n\t\tNOTE: No skin cleaning or scrubbing is needed.\nElectrode placement\n\t\nPlace one electrode on the skin and connect it to the working electrode-sensing electrode (WE-S) of the EIS.\nPlace another electrode 3 cm apart from the first one and connect it to the counter electrode (CE) of the EIS.\nPlace the third electrode on the elbow and connect it to the reference electrode (RE) of the EIS. See Figure 2A for the setup of the three electrodes .\n\t\tNOTE: The electrodes connected to the CE and RE of the EIS can be both Ag/AgCl electrodes or made of PEDOT:PSS, as is the case for the WE in this study.",
    "Start the recording on the EIS potentiostat. Apply a current between the counter and the working electrodes. Measure the potential variation across the reference and sensing couple.\n\t​NOTE: The tattoo and textile electrode connection with the acquisition system can be made with a clip to form a stable electrical connection with the potentiostat cables. The output impedance computed at each frequency consists of two contributions: skin impedance and skin-electrode contact impedance.\n3. Surface electrophysiological recordings\nNOTE: The following section describes the electrode placement for each biosignal of interest. Once the electrodes are correctly placed and well attached to the skin, they can be connected to the portable acquisition system to start the recordings. The video content of this article shows an example of electrophysiological monitoring using commercially available Ag/AgCl electrodes and a portable electronic unit.\nFor ECG, adopt a wearable configuration with two or three (one used as ground) electrodes. Place the electrodes in multiple body areas (e.g., chest, wrists, ribs) with a minimum interelectrode distance of 6 cm to get an appreciable signal.\n\tNOTE: A classical location entails the placement of two electrodes on the left and right clavicles; in this case, the ground electrode can be placed on the left iliac crest.\nFor muscle electrical activity recording (EMG), place the electrodes along the muscle of interest (e.g., on the biceps or the calf). Place the ground electrode on a static location such as an adjacent bone.\nFor brain electrical activity recording (EEG), place the electrodes in multiple locations on the head.\n\tNOTE: Comfortable locations are the forehead and around the outer ears. A reference electrode may be required, typically behind the ear on the mastoid bone.",
    "For electrodermal activity measurements (EDA), place two electrodes on the palm of the left hand. Perform the recording when the subject is at rest or doing physical exercise.\n\tNOTE: Skin impedance can be measured over the whole body surface (e.g., the ribs, on the back, on the foot sole); a sufficient interelectrode distance of 6 cm ensures good monitoring.\nSubscription Required.
