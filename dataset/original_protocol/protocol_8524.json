    "1. Solution Preparation\nNOTE: See Table of Materials for reagent sources.\nPrepare a 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution by adding 5 g of BSA to 100 mL of double-distilled water. Mix them completely by vortexing them. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPrepare an anti-oligomer antibody A11 solution (1:1,000) by adding 10 µL of antibody stock solution to 10 mL of the 5% BSA solution. Mix them completely by vortexing them. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPrepare an anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 solution (1:1,000) by adding 10 µL of antibody stock solution to 10 mL of 5% BSA solution. Mix them completely by vortexing. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPrepare an anti-fibrillar oligomer antibody OC solution (1:1,000) by adding 10 µL of antibody stock solution to 10 mL of 5% BSA solution. Mix them completely by vortexing. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPrepare a Tris-buffered saline (TBS) stock solution by adding 24 g of Tris base and 88 g of NaCl to 1,000 mL of double-distilled water. Adjust the pH to 7.4. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 3 months.\nPrepare a Tris-buffered saline and Tween-20 (TBST) solution by adding 1 mL of Tween-20 to 100 mL of TBS stock solution and 900 mL double-distilled water.\nPrepare a secondary antibody solution by adding 10 µL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) to 10 mL of TBST solution. Mix them completely by vortexing them. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nDissolve 3.68 g of curcumin in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a 10-mM curcumin stock solution.",
    "Dissolve 5 mg of synthetic Aβ1-42 in 2 mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) to form a 2.5-mg/mL Aβ monomer solution. Place it at room temperature (25 °C) for 20 min. Make 100 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\n\tNOTE: This procedure should be run as fast as possible. The pipette tips should be cut off to ensure accurate pipetting.\nPrepare electrochemiluminescence (ECL) fluid by mixing ECL fluid A and B with a volume ratio of 1:1. This solution should be prepared just before use.\n2. Sample Preparation\nNOTE: Perform the sample preparation 2 days before the dot blotting analysis.\nAdd 900 µL of double-distilled water to a tube of Aβ1-42 monomer solution; the concentration of Aβ1-42 will be 0.25 mg/mL. Place the mixture at room temperature for 20 min.\nEvaporate the solution with high-purity nitrogen gas until its volume is about 850 µL. The concentration of the Aβ1-42 solution will be about 0.29 mg/mL.\n\tNOTE: The solution should be shaken from time to time to ensure the HFIP is fully evaporated. Normally, after 30 min of evaporation, the volume of the residual solution is about 850 µL.\nDilute the curcumin stock solution to a curcumin working solution (0.2 and 2 µM) with double-distilled water. Mix the Aβ1-42solution and curcumin working solution with a volume ratio of 1:1. The final concentrations of curcumin will be 0.1 and 1 µM.\n\tNOTE: Potential oligomer inhibitors can be mixed with the Aβ1-42 solution in any ratio if needed.\nShake the solution continuously in a magnetic agitator (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nFix a plastic divider box to the magnetic agitator. Place 2 magnetic stir bars at 2 corners of the box and place the sample tubes in the center of the box.",
    "Shake the box at room temperature (25 °C) for 48 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The speed of the magnetic agitator is around 60 rpm.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 15 min at 4 °C and 18,000 x g. Collect the supernatant.\n3. Dot Blotting Analysis\nNOTE: All incubations are performed on a horizontal shaker.\nCut nitrocellulose membrane into 1-cm wide strips.\n\tNOTE: The width of the nitrocellulose membrane can be adjusted according to experimental needs.\nPlace 2-µL samples evenly on 2 strips (strip 1 and 2) with each point interval at 0.5 cm.\nPlace the strips at room temperature for 5 min until the droplet on the band is dry.\nIncubate the strips with a 5% BSA solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nRinse the strips with a TBST solution for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the TBST solution. For 1 h at room temperature, incubate strip 1 with an anti-oligomer antibody A11 solution and strip 2 with an anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 solution.\nRinse the strips with a TBST solution three times, each time for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the TBST solution. Incubate the strips with a secondary antibody solution for 40 min at room temperature.\nRinse the strips with a TBST solution three times, each time for 5 min at room temperature.\nEvenly apply the mixed ECL fluid to the surface of the strips. Expose the strips in an automatic chemiluminescence imaging system (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Normally, 300 µL of ECL fluid is enough for one membrane. The membrane must be kept moist during the exposure. The exposure time is automatically calculated by the imaging system.\nDo a grayscale analysis using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) or another image-processing software to obtain semi-quantitative results.\nSubscription Required.
