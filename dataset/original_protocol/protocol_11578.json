    "All aspects of the experiment were approved by the Ethical Committee of Tokyo Institute of Technology.\n1. Experimental Setup\nMaterial and Setup for Measuring Proprioceptive Drift.\n\t\nObtain a stand that can hold a 100 x 100 cm plate vertically (Figure 1).\nObtain a chair on which the participant can sit comfortably during the experiment.\nObtain a 100 x 100 cm acrylic mirror and matte blackboard.\nObtain the position tracker (for example, SLC-C02, Cyverse) to track the participant's right hand position. Spatial resolution should be about 1.5 mm to allow sufficient number of samplings to be used for the machine learning.\nObtain an infrared LED and retroreflective markers that will be used to indicate the position of the stand and the participant's right hand, respectively (see steps 1.1.11 and 3.2.6).\nObtain the foot pedal for the participant's response.\nCreate the custom-made program, which can record and simultaneously display the participant's response and right hand position and play a beep as feedback of the participant's response when the foot pedal is pressed. In these experiments, the participant's right hand position was collected using the motor capture device and its custom-made program according to manufacturer instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: According to a previous paper16, the program was developed with a software development toolkit. The custom-made program developed by the software development toolkit can be adapted for other brands of motion capture devices.\nUse a metronome to provide timing signals for the training of the hand movement, that is, tapping the surface of the mirror or blackboard. See step 3.1.1 for precise training instructions.\nUse noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the possibility that the participant can hear sound cues for the hand position.\nFor the visual feedback condition, attach the mirror to the stand. For the condition without visual feedback, attach the blackboard to the stand.",
    "Place the infrared LED at the top-left of the mirror or blackboard.\nMaterial and Setup for Measuring Sense of Ownership and Agency.\n\t\nRepeat the procedure from step 1.1.1 to step 1.1.11.\nCreate or obtain the questionnaire assessing sense of ownership and agency (e.g.,10,13,16). Table 1 shows examples from this questionnaire used in the previous study15.\nUse a monitor or tablet PC to display the questionnaire to the participant.\n2. Participants\nRecruit about 10 right-handed participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\n\tNote: The number of participants can be adjusted according to the experimental goals and the number of repeated trials per participant.\nObtain written informed consent for participation prior to the start of the experiment.\n3. Experiment Procedure\nTraining Phase for the Hand Movement.\n\t\nTrain the participants to synchronously tap with both hands on the mirror or blackboard at a certain tempo using the metronome. Instruct the participants to perform the tapping movement by keeping the heel of the hand in contact with the mirror or board. At the beginning of training, start the metronome at a tempo of 60 beats per min and then instruct the participant to move both hands synchronously according to the sound of the metronome.\nEnsure that the timing of the participant's hand movement is close to one cycle per sec (approximately 1 Hz) by comparing it to the sound of the metronome several minutes after the beginning of tapping.\nEstimation of Proprioceptive Drift in the Participant's Midsagittal Plane.\n\t\nUse a counter-balanced order of conditions across participants.\nMount the mirror or blackboard on the stand based on the conditions: with visual feedback, mount the mirror; without visual feedback, mount the blackboard.\nEnsure that participant is sitting very close to the mirror or blackboard, which is positioned along the midsagittal plane of the participant (Figure 1).",
    "Make sure that participant can see the mirror image of the left hand but cannot see the real right hand.\nInstruct participant to pay attention to the image of the left hand in the mirror during the experiment.\nPut the retroreflective markers on the participant's right index fingertip and wrist.\n\t\t\nSince the markers are only put on the participant's right hand, make sure that the haptic sensation of the participant's right hand due to the attached markers is not altered substantially compared to the left hand by querying the participant orally.\nPut the noise-cancelling headphones over the participant's ears.\nInstruct the participant to move the left hand approximately 30 cm vertically and 30 cm horizontally from the lower right corner of the mirror and to maintain this left hand position during the experiment. This position is set as the origin of the surface of the 2D plane.\nInstruct the participant to place the right hand at will on the other side of the mirror or blackboard and to maintain its position until the end of the trial.\nInstruct the participant about the task as follows:\n\t\t\nAt the beginning of each trial, instruct the participant to push the middle button of the foot pedal. At this time, the system will sound a beep through the headphone as feedback of the pedal press.\nAfter hearing the beep, instruct the participant to start tapping with both hands synchronously at 1 Hz on the board, which is the mirror in the condition with visual feedback or the blackboard in the condition without visual feedback.",
    "After more than six hand movements, instruct the participant to stop the movement at the preferred time and answer the question about the right hand position by pressing the right or left button on the foot pedal. The right button is a yes and the left is a no. The question is, \"Do you feel that the right and left hand are in the same position?\" At this moment, the participant will hear a beep as feedback for the pedal press again.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the participants ask about the meaning of the \"the same position,\" tell them that \"same position\" means that the subjective height and depth of the right hand are equivalent to that of the left hand.\nInstruct the participant to move their right hand to another position of their choice. Then, start the trial again. This cycle will continue for up to 200 trials per condition.\nEnsure that the participant can understand the task and ask the participant to restart the task.\nDuring the task, check that the timing of the participant's tapping stays at approximately 1 Hz by viewing the movement compared to the metronome.\n\t\tNote: The sound of the metronome can be heard only by the experimenter.\nAfter finishing about 100 trials, let the participant take a break.\nPerform the experiment for the other conditions (with or without visual feedback) on separate days.\nEstimation of Sense of Ownership and Agency in the Mirror Condition.\n\t\nDefine the right hand's positions for collecting the participant's responses on the questionnaire about sense of ownership and agency. For example, in a previous publication16, there were 13 prefixed right hand positions. These points were arranged every 7 cm up to Â± 21 cm from the origin.",
    "Carry out the same procedure for the above estimation as listed from step 3.2.2 to step 3.2.7.\nInstruct the participant to place the right hand following the experimenter's guide and maintain its position until finishing one trial.\nInstruct the participant about the task as follows:\n\t\t\nAt the beginning of the trial, push the middle button of the foot pedal. At this time, the participant will hear the beep as feedback of the pedal press.\nThen, start to tap the right and left hands synchronously at 1 Hz.\nAfter more than six times of tapping, stop tapping when the experimenter indicates. Then, answer the questions about sense of ownership and agency displayed on the monitor using a 7-point Likert scale with ratings ranging from -3 (\"totally disagree\") to +3 (\"totally agree\") with 0 indicating neither agreement nor disagreement (\"uncertain\").\nMove the right hand to the position that the experimenter indicates. Then, start the trial again. This cycle will continue up to the number of right-hand positions that the experimenter defines.\nEnsure that the participant can understand the task and ask the participant to start the task.\n4. Data Analysis\nThe Analysis of Proprioceptive Drift in the Participant's Midsagittal Plane.\n\t\nObtain the statistical tool that contains the machine learning application, especially support vector machine (e.g., R, MATLAB). Use support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier to extract the borders of the participant's responses. A previous publication provides an explanation for the algorithms of the classifier (see Chapter 7)20. In this article, we explain the method using R (version 3.1.2).\nInstall the package named \"kernlab\"21, which contains the analysis using SVM in the R application.",
    "Mark the area that shows proprioceptive drift of the hand as follows (Figure 2 describes the schematic representation of the data analysis flow). See Supplemental software code and data sample for further explanation of this data analysis.\n\t\t\nCalculate the relative right hand positions from the origin. Discard data with errors (e.g., missing position data or participant's responses) from the analysis.\nMake a probabilistic model of the participant's \"yes\" responses in 2D space using the SVM. Use the data from the responses as a symbolic description of the model. Use the data of the right hand position as the parameters of the model. Use the commonly used radial basis function kernel as the kernel for the SVM. In order to avoid the arbitrary analysis, calculate sigma (i.e., parameter used for changing the weight of each data point) by automatic sigma estimation.\nEnsure that the model is correctly fitted by checking that the training errors of the model are under 0.2. Using the probabilistic model, define the area in which the p-value of the participant's \"yes\" responses was estimated to be over 0.5.\nAverage each participant's data to make an area that shows proprioceptive drift.\n\t\tNOTE: As it is difficult to average the border of the \"yes\" and \"no\" response area estimated by the p-values of the responses in 2D space, two types of average are recommended. One method is to average the p-values for the participant's responses in 2D space, which is the method used prior to estimating the border. The other method is to average the area size, which is used after estimating the border.\nAnalysis of the Questionnaire Data and Area Size.\n\t\nObtain the statistical tool to assess the significance of the position and the categories of the questionnaire (e.g., SPSS or R).",
    "Assess normal distribution of all data using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and apply the appropriate non-parametric test when one or more of the corresponding data sets failed to meet the criteria for normal distribution (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Friedman test).\n\t\tNote: If a non-parametric method that suits the experiment is lacking, use a parametric method and explain the reasoning. In a previous study16, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analyzed the questionnaire data, as there was no non-parametric substitute for this analysis.\nSubscription Required.
