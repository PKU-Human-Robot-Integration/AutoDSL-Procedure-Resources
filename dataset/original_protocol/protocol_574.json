    "1. Transfer 200 µl of biofluid into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n  2. Add 1000 µl \\(5x volumes) of QIAzol Lysis Reagent.\n  3. Vortex 5 sec.\n  4. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. \\(2,3)\n  5. Add 200 µl chloroform.\n  6. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds.\n  7. Incubate for 3 minutes at room temperature.\n  8. Centrifuge sample for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C.\n  9. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube \\(4). Avoid the white interphase. \n  10. Carefully measure the aqueous phase and add 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol.\n  11. Mix gently and thoroughly. Do not centrifuge and do not delay moving on to the next step.\n  12. Assemble a MinElute spin column in a new collection tube.\n  13. Load up to 700 µl of the mixture from step 5, including any precipitate that may have formed, onto the column. \n  14. Spin for 15 seconds at 8,000 x g \\(5) at room temperature \\(6). \n  15. Discard flow-through.\n  16. Repeat steps 13-15 until the entire sample has been loaded.\n  17. Add 700 μl Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  18. Centrifuge for 15 seconds at 8000 x g at room temperature to wash the column. \n  19. Discard the flow-through.\n  20. Pipet 500 μl Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  21. Centrifuge for 15 seconds at 8000 x g to wash the column. \n  22. Discard the flow-through.\n  23. Pipet 500 μl 80% ethanol \\(7) onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  24. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥ 8000 x g \\(≥10,000 rpm) at room temperature to wash the column. \n  25. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through. \\(8)\n  26. Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 ml collection tube \\(supplied).",
    "27. Open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane. \\(9) \n  28. Discard the collection tube with the flow-through. \\(8) \n  29. Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column to a new 1.5 ml collection tube \\(supplied). Add 14 μl RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane. \\(10) \n  30.  Centrifuge for 1 minute at full speed to elute the RNA."
