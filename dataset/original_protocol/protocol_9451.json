    "1. Safety\nCAUTION: This protocol uses [γ-32P]-ATP to assess the activity of AMPK. Phosphorus-32 is a radioactive isotope, largely emitting beta radiation. Since the size of a beta particle is extremely small, it can easily penetrate clothing and skin. Both external and internal exposure to beta radiation may be harmful to human health, including by causing skin burns and tissue damage.\nCarry out all the steps that require the use of [γ-32P]-ATP using proper protection, such as acrylic shielding.\nEnsure that all personnel are equipped with electronic personal dosimeters (EPD) to monitor the extent of exposure to harmful radiation during all procedures.\nHandle open-source radiation only after appropriate training and regulatory approval.\n\tNOTE: Here, all experiments were conducted after the completion of training on open-source radiation use at the Seoul National University and the approval of the Korean government (nssc.go.kr/nssc/en).\nDispose of radioactive waste per local regulations.\n\tNOTE: Here, directives from the Institute of Environmental Protection & Safety of the Seoul National University were followed. The followings are a list of regulators in the United States and European countries: The United States of America, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (http://www.nrc.gov/); United Kingdom, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) (http://www.hse.gov.uk); France, Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (https://www.asn.fr/); and Germany, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMU) (http://www.bmu.de).\n2. In Vitro Competitive Kinase Assay\nConstruction of Competitive Peptides\nDetermine the consensus motif phosphorylated by AMPK.\n\t\tNOTE: AMPK recognizes the consensus motif, Φ-[X,β]-X-X-Ser/Thr-X-X-X-Φ. In the consensus sequence, Φ represents hydrophobic amino acids (i.e., valine [V], leucine [L], methionine [M], and isoleucine [I]) and β represents basic amino acids (i.e., lysine [K], arginine [R], and histidine [H])1.",
    "Select serine or threonine residues from target sequences according to the above consensus motif. Use three putative sites of human Nrf2 (#1, 148-157 comprising Ser153; #2, 330-339 comprising Ser335; and #3, 553-562 comprising Ser558)8.\nCommercially synthesize 10-residue peptides that mimic the putative sites. Obtain the synthesized product as a lyophilized powder with a purity greater than 98% for each peptide.\nDissolve the peptides using a kinase buffer to achieve a concentration of 71.667 g/L. If a peptide is not soluble in a kinase buffer, dissolve it in 20% DMSO. If it remains insoluble, a peptide mimicking the putative site may be extended to increase solubility.\nIn Vitro Competitive AMPK Kinase Assay\nPrepare 5× kinase buffer as follows: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 25 mM MgCl2; 5 mM EGTA; 5 mM DTT; 125 mM β-glycerophosphate (serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor); 5 mM Na3VO4 (tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor); 0.5% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III, 1 mM cold ATP; and 500 µM AMP.\n\t\tNOTE: AMP is an essential component of the kinase buffer to test AMPK activity. The buffer can be used to measure the activity of both serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases.\nThaw the following recombinant protein and synthetic peptides on ice: AMPK; Nrf2; and oligopeptides #1, #2, and #3.\nPrepare a reaction buffer on ice: 0.15 µg of AMPK, 0.4 µg of Nrf2 (~4 pmol), 0.43 mg of oligopeptide (~300 nmol), and 6 µL of 5× kinase buffer. Adjust the final volume to 30 µL with sterile distilled water (DW).\n\t\tNOTE: The addition of [γ-32P]-ATP after preparing the reaction buffer may reduce the radioactive signal due to kinase autophosphorylation.\nRunning the Reactants\n\tNOTE: All the processes below must be carried out under protection with an acrylic shield, rack, or block, as well as appropriate personal protective equipment.",
    "Set heating blocks to 30 °C before starting the experiment.\nAdd 1 µL of [γ-32P]-ATP (1 µCi) to the reaction tubes on ice. Mix the reaction buffer by pipetting up and down several times.\n\t\tNOTE: The radioactivity of 32P has a short half-life of approximately 14 days9. Adjust the volume by considering the half-life (e.g., after one month from the production of [γ-32P]-ATP, add 4 µL of [γ-32P]-ATP to make 1 µCi).\nIncubate the sample in the heating block at 30 °C for 15-30 min. During this step, prepare 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels. Adjust the percentage of the gel according to the size of the target protein.\nStop the kinase reaction by adding 3 µL of 10× SDS sample buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol, 20% (w/v) SDS, 15.42% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 90% (v/v) 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue). Mix the reaction buffer by pipetting up and down several times.\nRun the samples in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel at 70 V for 20 min and continuously at 140 V for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The bromophenol blue line at the end of the gel contains extremely high radioactive signals. It is recommended to remove the gel below the blue line before proceeding to the next step to reduce background signals.\nAfter SDS-PAGE, gently remove the gel from the caster. Place the gel in a glass tube for the next step.\nFix the gel with fixation buffer for 20 min (50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid).\nGently move the gel onto filter paper and cover it with a transparent wrapper. Note that the gel may be easily torn at this step. Dry the gel with a vacuum gel dryer at 80 °C for 1 h.\nVisualization",
    "Expose the gel to either a phosphor screen or an X-ray film overnight (usually for approximately 16 h).\n\t\tNOTE: A phosphor screen can be reused after exposure to the extra-bright light. When an X-ray film is used, expose the gel over two days. X-ray films have lower sensitivities than phosphor screens.\nScan the phosphor screen with a phosphor imager. Export the image as a high-resolution TIFF or bitmap file.\nAfter visualization, move the gel to a glass or plastic container for Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining.\nWash the gel with DW. Discard the DW and stain the gel with the staining reagent for 1 h.\nDiscard the reagent and destain the gel with DW for 1 h or overnight. Place the gel between transparent plastic films (or the equivalent) to scan with an office scanner.\n3. In Vitro Kinase Assay Using a Site-specific Mutant\nSite-Directed Mutagenesis of pGEX-Nrf2\nMutagenic Primer Design\n\t\tNOTE: Designing proper mutagenic primers is critical for the successful outcome of mutagenesis. The following are some considerations for designing mutagenic primers. Create a primer consisting of 25 to 45 bases, with the desired mutation in the middle of the primer. The primer should have 40-60% GC content and terminate with one or more G or C bases. Ensure that the Tm of the primer is equal to 78 °C or greater according to the formula [Tm= 81.5 + 0.41(% GC) - (675/length of bases) - % mismatch].\n\t\tNOTE: Purify the primer because its purity is important for mutation efficiency. There are several websites for designing mutagenic primers.\n\t\t\nOpen the primer design program for \"designing primers for site-directed mutagenesis\" (http://www.genomics.agilent.com/primerDesignProgram.jsp).\nPaste human Nrf2 DNA sequence (Access No. NM_006164.4) and select the \"upload translated\" button.",
    "Select the serine 558 residue from the translated amino acid sequence to be changed to alanine. Using the mutagenic primer, substitute the codon for serine from agc to gcc, for alanine.\nConsider primer length, Tm, and the GC content.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The mutagenic primer is finally designed as 5'-ctactgaaaaaacaactc gccaccttatatctcgaag-3'.\nReaction for Mutant Strand Synthesis using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\n\t\t\nPrepare the PCR reaction mixture on ice: 10× reaction buffer, 50 ng of pGEX-GST-Nrf2, 125 ng of forward primer, 125 ng of reverse primer, 1 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 2.5 U Pfu DNA polymerase, and sterile DW to 50 µL.\nRun the PCR for pGEX-GST-Nrf2-mutant strand synthesis with the following cycling program: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 30 s; 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 68 °C for 90 s; and 1 cycle at 68 °C for 5 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Depending on the plasmid length, the cycling parameters may be changed.\nPlace it on ice for 2 min to cool the reactants for the next step. Alternatively, store them at 4 °C overnight.\nDpn I Digestion and the Selection of a Mutant Plasmid\n\t\t\nAdd 1 µL of Dpn I restriction enzyme (10 U/µL) to each of the reactants after cooling. Mix thoroughly and gently by pipetting and centrifuge for 1 min.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 2 h to digest parental pGEX-GST-Nrf2 double-stranded DNA.\nGently thaw DH5 α supercompetent cells on ice.\nAdd 50 µL of the reactant to 150 µL of pre-chilled DH5 α supercompetent cells and incubate on ice for at least 30 min.\nTransfer the tubes to a heating block preheated to 42 °C and leave them for 90 s. Place them on ice for 2 min.",
    "Add pre-warmed lysogeny broth (LB) to the transformed DH5 α cells and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking at 180 rpm.\nSpread the transformed cells on LB-ampicillin agar plates and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Ampicillin is used for selection since the plasmid GEX-GST-Nrf2 has the ampicillin resistance marker. Use appropriate antibiotics, depending on the resistance marker of the mutagenized plasmid.\nPick a single colony from the plate, transfer it to 5 mL of LB-ampicillin, and incubate overnight it at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm. For verification of the mutagenic sequence, evaluate at least three colonies.\nExtract DNA using a DNA miniprep kit for DNA sequence analysis; follow the manufacturer's protocol.\nVerify the mutagenic DNA sequences using an automatic DNA sequence analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol. Use at least 200 ng of the DNA construct for the verification of mutant sequences.\nPurification of Recombinant GST-Nrf2 Protein\nExpression of Mutagenic GST-Nrf2 Fusion Protein in Escherichia coli\nTransform the mutagenic pGEX-GST-Nrf2 plasmid into BL21 cells.
