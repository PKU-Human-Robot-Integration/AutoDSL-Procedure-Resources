    "All in vivo studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's guidelines on animal care and use and were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital's Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol 18-06-3715). All animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Figure 1 shows the timeline including anesthesia, surgical preparation, and timepoints for primary outcome measurements of this study.\n1. Induction, anesthesia and intubation\nTo prevent unnecessary stress and discomfort, sedate the swine by intramuscular injection of a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam 4-6 mg/kg and xylazine 1.1-2.2 mg/kg as well as isoflurane 3% using a face mask.\nCannulate the ear vein to obtain venous access with a 20 G IV cannula after disinfecting the area with 95% ethanol. Start a maintenance infusion (0.9% NaCl at 5 mL/kg/h).\nIntubate the pig with an endotracheal tube (size 7 for pigs weighing 40-50 kg) once anesthetic adequacy is confirmed. Perform balloon-ventilation with a frequency of 12 breaths/min and transport the pig to the operating theater.\nPlace the animal on the operating table in the supine position. Immediately start mechanical positive pressure ventilation with FiO2 0.50, 10 mL/kg tidal volume, and a frequency of 12 breaths/min under continuous capnography.\nPlace a pulse oximeter on the ear or the bottom lip for continuous monitoring.\nMaintain normothermia (37 °C) using an air-heated pad.\nTo maintain general anesthesia, keep isoflurane administration at 0.5-4% through the endotracheal tube. Throughout the procedure, continuously monitor ECG, arterial blood pressure, temperature, and capnography to measure the depth of anesthesia.\nInsert a Foley catheter to check the fluid status of the animal and monitor the urine output by collecting urine in a drainage bag.",
    "​NOTE: Female swine are preferred over males due to the anatomical features of their urethra which allows easier catheterization.\n2. Surgical preparation and vascular access\nDrape the animal in a sterile fashion.\nDisinfect the right lateral area of the neck by applying betadine and then 95% ethanol for 3 times.\nPerform a cut-down for the catheterization of the right carotid artery and the right jugular vein. Retract the sternocleidomastoid muscle laterally and dissect it down to the right carotid artery and the right jugular vein.\nInsert a 5F angiography sheath in both the artery and the vein. Secure it with a silk 2-0 suture.\nInsert a 5F angiography sheath using the Seldinger technique into the left femoral artery.\n\t\nTo perform the Seldinger technique puncture the femoral artery using a hollow needle. Insert a soft tip guidewire through the lumen and advance it into the femoral artery.\nHold the guidewire secure with the hand while removing the needle. Pass the angiography sheath over the guidewire into the femoral artery and withdraw the guidewire. Use ultrasound guidance, if necessary.\n3. Induction of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury\nAdminister 200 IU/kg sodium heparin intravenously to achieve systemic anticoagulation (target activated clotting time (ACT) > 300 s).\nPerform an angiography by injecting an iodinated contrast agent under fluoroscopy to identify the renal arteries.\nNOTE: To reduce the risk for contrast-induced nephrotoxicity, dilute the iodinated contrast agent in a 1:1 solution with normal saline. Tabulate the dosage for all animals to ensure equivalent dosing.\nIdentify the renal arteries, manually advance the guidewire in the guiding catheter.\nPosition the 5F JL4 guiding catheter in the left renal artery through the right carotid artery (Figure 1A).\nPosition the second 5F JL4 guiding catheter in the right renal artery through the left femoral artery (Figure 1A).",
    "Use the guidewires to direct a 5F percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) dilatation catheter in each renal artery.\nNOTE: It is preferable to position the balloon at the proximal renal artery so that no branches or collaterals of the renal artery are left patent after balloon inflation.\nPosition each balloon catheter in place and connect a pressure line to each catheter.\nCheck the presence of arterial pulse waveforms in the pressure monitor to ensure the correct positioning of the catheter.\nInflate each balloon and aim for a pressure of approximately 2.5 atm inside the balloon (Figure 1B).\nTo confirm the cessation of blood flow to the kidneys observe the flattening of the pulse waveform at the tip of the balloon catheter.\nInject iodinated contrast medium (1:1 dilution) and check for any opacification of the renal vessels.\n\tNOTE: It is also possible to fill the balloon with an iodinated contrast agent for visualization of the inflated balloon. However, this method is not as sensitive as pulse waveform flattening to confirm occlusion of the renal arteries.\nAfter 60 min of occlusion, carefully deflate and remove the balloon catheters from the renal arteries.\nPerform an angiography (using 1:1 diluted contrast medium) to confirm renal artery patency and the establishment of renal reperfusion (Figure 1C).\nRemove the 5F angiography sheath from the left femoral artery.\nApply firm pressure at the site of catheterization for 30 min.\nReverse the effect of heparin by the administration of protamine (3 mg/kg) until ACT normalizes.\nTo sample urine during the post-operative period, secure a tube to the Foley catheter with a silk 2-0 suture using an interrupted stitch on the skin.",
    "Leave the angiography sheaths in the right carotid artery and the right jugular vein in place and secure them with a silk 2-0 suture using an interrupted stitch to allow for blood sampling throughout the study.\nClose the neck incision with a silk 2-0 suture using a continuous stitch in 2 layers.\nAdminister bupivacaine (3 mg/kg) at the incision site to minimize pain.\nContinue to hydrate the animal with 0.9% NaCl at 5 mL/kg/h for a total of 2 h following the end of ischemia.\nPlace a fentanyl patch (25-50 µg/h) on the back of the animal to minimize post-operative pain.\nAdminister an intramuscular injection of buprenorphine (0.005-0.1 mg/kg) to minimize post-operative pain.\nMonitor the animal and maintain it on mechanical ventilation until awaking.\n4. Animal recovery\nFollowing awaking, accommodate the animal in a temperature-controlled room.\nContinue to turn the animal from one lateral side to the other until it regains full consciousness and ability to ambulate.\nProvide water and food ad libitum.\n5. Functional assessment\nCollect the blood and the urine samples according to the desired protocol.\nNOTE: In this study, the following time points were designated: baseline (1 h following initiation of the hydration protocol and before occlusion of the renal arteries), end of ischemia, and reperfusion (2 h, 6 h, 24 h).\nCollect the arterial and the venous blood samples. Store them in lithium heparin or EDTA coated vacutainers for subsequent analysis.\nNOTE: Draw blood directly from the catheters in the carotid artery and jugular vein.\nCollect the urine samples from the Foley catheter and store them in 15 mL tubes for analysis.\nNOTE: Collect the urine from the drainage bag connected to the Foley catheter.\nTo determine urine output, empty the drainage bag and collect urine for 1 h.",
    "NOTE: For the 6 h timepoint at which a drainage bag is not connected to the Foley catheter, close the tube connected to the Foley catheter for 30 min and then collect the urine with a 60 mL syringe to determine urine output.\n6. Euthanasia\nFollowing the end of the reperfusion period, perform anesthesia and monitor as described above.\nContinue hydration with 0.9% NaCl at 5 mL/kg/h.\nUse the arterial and the venous catheters for blood sampling and the Foley catheter to determine urine output. Collect the final blood and urine samples and calculate the urine output.\nPerform a 15-cm midline laparotomy incision using a size 10 blade from the xiphoid down to the mid pelvis.\nUse a straight lateral retractor to retract the abdominal skin.\nDissect the lateral peritoneal attachments of the abdominal wall to expose the right and left retroperitoneum.\nIdentify and bluntly dissect both renal arteries and veins.\nLigate both renal arteries and veins with a 2-0 silk suture and perform bilateral nephrectomies to collect whole tissue specimens for histological and metabolic analysis.\nEuthanize the animal with the preferred method of euthanasia (e.g., exsanguination, pentobarbital)\nSubscription Required.
