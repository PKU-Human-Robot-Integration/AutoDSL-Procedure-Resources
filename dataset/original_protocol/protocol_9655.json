    "1. Microfluidic device fabrication\nSoft lithography\n\tNOTE: This protocol describes device fabrication of a flow-focusing microfluidic device design from de Wilson et al.9. However, this protocol can be used with any device design on an SU-8 wafer. The wafer can be taped to a Petri dish, and then needs to be silanized to prevent adherence of the PDMS to the wafer features15.\n\t\nMix the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer base with the curing agent (see Table of Materials) at a 10:1 ratio. Prepare approximately 100 g to cover the wafer with ~5 mm PDMS. Pour the PDMS mixture onto the wafer and degas in a desiccator for approximately 30 min. Once all the bubbles are gone, place in an oven at 60 °C for at least 2 h to cure the PDMS.\nUse a knife to gently trace around the parameter of the device without cracking the wafer; then, carefully peel the PDMS off the wafer. Use a 1 mm biopsy punch (see Table of Materials) to create the inlet and outlet channels.\n\t\tNOTE: Be gentle when punching the microfluidic device. Tears or rips around the inlet or outlet channels can cause leaks during microgel production.\nUse tape to remove dust from the device on the feature side. Place the devices and clean glass slides on a hot plate at 135 °C for at least 15 min to remove moisture.\nIn a fume hood, use a corona plasma gun (see Table of Materials) on high on both the glass slides and devices (feature side exposed) for approximately 30 s, and then quickly bond them together. Gently apply pressure to ensure a good seal between the device and the glass slide. Place the devices in a 60 °C oven overnight to secure the bond.",
    "2. Microfluidic production of hyaluronic acid (HA) microgels with norbornene (NB) functional handles\nHA-NB synthesis\n\tNOTE: HA-norbornene (HA-NB) synthesis was adapted from Darling et al.3 using 79 kDa sodium HA with molar equivalents of 1:1.5:2.5 of HA-repeat units to 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride (DMTMM) to 5-norbornene-2-methylamine (NMA).\n\t\nWeigh the reactants. Dissolve the HA at 20 mg/mL in 200 mM MES buffer (pH ~6) by stirring in a beaker or flask on a stir plate. Once dissolved, add the DMTMM to the HA solution and allow to react for approximately 20 min at room temperature. For example, 1 g HA + 1.09 g DMTMM + 845 µL NMA can be used.\nAdd NMA dropwise to the HA/DMTMM solution. Add parafilm to the opening of the reaction vessel to minimize evaporation and cover the reaction vessel with foil. Continue stirring while allowing the reaction to proceed for approximately 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, chill 200 proof ethanol (approximately 10x the reaction volume). On a stir plate, transfer the reaction dropwise to the chilled ethanol to precipitate the HA-NB and continue stirring at 200-300 rpm for 20 min.\nTransfer the solution to 50 mL conical tubes, and then centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 10 min. Pour off the excess ethanol to dispose as waste. At this point, the HA-NB product should be white pellets in the conical tubes. Pull vacuum on the HA-NB in a dessicator to dry overnight.\nPurify the HA-NB using 12-14 kDa molecular weight cut-off cellulose dialysis tubing (see Table of Materials). Dissolve HA-NB in 2 M NaCl solution and transfer to the dialysis tubing. Tie the tubing and secure with clamps, if needed. Transfer the filled dialysis tubing to a bucket with 5 L of ultrapure water and dialyze the HA-NB against water overnight.",
    "The next day, remove the water and replace with 1 M NaCl solution for 30 min. Remove the NaCl solution, and then dialyze against ultrapure water for 3 days, replacing the water daily.\nFilter the dialyzed product using 0.2 µm vacuum-driven filter, and then transfer the filtered product to 50 mL conical tubes.\nAdd liquid nitrogen to a cryogenic container and flash-freeze the HA-NB tubes for 10 min. Then, remove the conical tubes with forceps and quickly remove the cap and cover with a lab-grade tissue (see Table of Materials). Secure the tissue with a rubber band and transfer to a lyophilization container or chamber (see Table of Materials) and lyophilize. Store the lyophilized product at -20 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: Liquid nitrogen is a hazardous substance. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment when working with liquid nitrogen.\nQuantify norbornene modification by dissolving the HA-NB at 10 mg/mL in D2O and analyzing via proton NMR (Figure 1A)16.\n\t\t\nTo determine the amount of functionalization, first calibrate the D2O solvent peak to 4.8 PPM. Integrate the peak for the HA methyl protons (δ2.05) and calibrate the integration to 3.0. Next, integrate the peaks for the pendant norbornene groups at δ6.33 and δ6.02 (vinyl protons, endo). Normalize the integration of these peaks to the corresponding number of protons to determine the average degree of modification3.\nPreparation of HA-NB microgel precursor\n\t\nPrepare 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and sterile filter the buffer using a 0.2 µm vacuum-driven filter. Using the HEPES buffer, prepare respective 50 mM stocks of lithium phenyl(2,4,6,-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphinate (LAP) photo-initiator and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reducing agent. Keep the LAP solution away from light.",
    "Prepare the other microgel precursor components by preparing respective 50 mM stocks of di-thiol linker and RGD peptide in sterile distilled water. Weigh out HA-NB and dissolve in HEPES buffer to prepare a 10 mg/mL stock.\n\t\tNOTE: Different di-thiol linkers could be used for the internal crosslinking of the microgels based on user preference. Both a degradable (i.e., MMP-cleavable) and non-degradable (dithiothreitol or DTT) linker have been listed in the Table of Materials. The RGD peptide is included in the microgel formulation to promote cell adhesion in MAP scaffolds, but this component could be removed and replaced with equal volume of HEPES buffer.\nCombine the precursor components with final concentrations of 9.9 mM LAP, 0.9375 mM TCEP (4 thiol/TCEP), 2.8 mM di-thiol linker, 1 mM RGD peptide, and 3.5 wt% (w/v) HA-NB by adding extra HEPES buffer to reach the desired final volume. Mix the precursor well using a positive displacement pipette.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, slowly pull up the entire mixture. Put the tip onto the end of a 1 mL syringe and eject the tip from the pipette. Pull the syringe plunger to load the mixture into the syringe, and then add a 0.2 µm filter on the end of syringe and filter into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge the filtered precursor solution to remove the bubbles produced during filtering.\nAgain, using a P1000 pipette, slowly pull up the filtered precursor being careful not to create bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the tip for them to dislodge and float to the top.",
    "Place the tip onto the end of a 1 mL syringe and eject the tip from the pipette. Keep the syringe vertical and pull the syringe plunger slowly until the entire precursor solution is in the syringe. Add a blunt tip needle to the syringe and push the precursor through the tip of the needle. Wrap the syringe in foil to keep out of light.\nPreparation of microgel pinching solution\n\t\nPrepare 5% v/v Span-80 in heavy white mineral oil and mix well. Desiccate to remove bubbles. Keep the surfactant/oil mixture at room temperature wrapped in foil. Mix well and desiccate prior to each use.\nUse a 5 mL syringe to draw up the oil/surfactant mixture (minimize bubbles) until the distance between the plunger and the fingerhold is approximately equal to the distance of the precursor syringe. Add a blunt needle to the syringe and push the oil through the tip of the needle.\nMicrofluidic device setup\n\t\nAdd a blunt needle to a 1 mL syringe and fill with synthetic hydrophobic treatment solution (see Table of Materials). Gently flow the solution through the microfluidic device until it pools at each inlet/outlet. Let the solution dry in the device on the benchtop for approximately 30 min, and then pull vacuum on the outlet to remove excess solution. Secure the device with clamps on a tabletop microscope.\nWrap a 15 mL conical tube with foil and place in a tube rack to serve as the microgel collection container. Use a ring stand with a clamp to place the UV light probe into the opening of the collection tube. Use a UV detector (see Table of Materials) to measure the UV intensity, moving the probe until 20 mW/cm2 is achieved. Turn off the UV light until later.",
    "Cut tubing at a length that will reach from the microfluidic device to the collection container. On one end of the tubing, cut a 45° angle. Gently insert the angled end of the tubing into the outlet channel.\n\t\tNOTE: Be gentle when inserting the tubing into the microfluidic device. Tears or rips around the inlet or outlet channels can cause leaks during microgel production.\nSecure both the precursor and oil phase syringes on a dual-syringe pump (see Table of Materials). Cut two more pieces of tubing at a length that will reach from syringe tips to the microfluidic device. On one end of each tube, cut a 45° angle. Carefully secure the tubing (blunt end) on both syringe tips.\nChange the settings on the pump for the 1 mL syringe and include the approximate precursor volume. Slowly push the pump forward until enough pressure is applied to the syringe plungers to push both the oil and the precursor to the ends of the tubing, removing any air from the system. Let the pressure equalize 5-10 min prior to moving on to step 2.4.6.\nGently insert the angled end of the tubing into the inlet channels of the microfluidic device with the microgel precursor solution in the front inlet and the pinching oil in the back inlet. Move the pump forward in small increments until flow begins in the device and spherical microgels begin to form at the flow-focusing region. Start the pump with a 0.4 µL/min flowrate and let the device run until it stabilizes. If needed, adjust the flow rate ±0.1 µL/min in small increments to stabilize microgel production.",
    "Once microgel production stabilizes as shown in Figure 1B, replace the collection tube with a new tube, and turn on the UV light. Check the run periodically to ensure microgel production is stable over the duration of the run.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64554/64554fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Microfluidic production of hyaluronic acid (HA) microgels with norbornene (NB) functional handles. (A) Approximately 31% of HA repeat units were successfully modified with NB, as determined by proton NMR analysis performed in deuterium oxide. 1H NMR shifts of pendant norbornenes at δ6.33 and δ6.02 (vinyl protons, endo), and δ6.26 and δ6.23 ppm (vinyl protons, exo) were compared to the HA methyl group δ2.05 ppm to determine functionalization.

Purifying and drying microgels\nPurification of microgels\n\t\nPrepare the microgel washing buffer (300 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM CaCl2) as well as 2% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 surfactant solution in washing buffer. Sterilize the solutions using a 0.2 µm vacuum-driven filter.",
    "Centrifuge the microgel collection tube (5,000 x g) for 5 min. In a sterile hood, carefully aspirate the supernatant oil phase. Combine the µgels 1:1 with 2% Pluronic F-127 surfactant solution and vortex to mix well. Centrifuge (5,000 x g) for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant washing solution.\nAdd washing buffer at 4x microgel volume and vortex to mix well. Centrifuge (5,000 x g) the mixture for 5 min and aspirate the washing solution. Complete 4-8 washes with the washing buffer until the surfactant is removed from the system (i.e., no bubbles remain).\nFluorescent labeling of HA-NB microgels\n\tNOTE:The in-house synthesis of a fluorescently labeled tetrazine relies on two base-catalyzed thiol-Michael addition reactions in series that have been well described and previously reported3. For this work, Alexa Fluor-488 was conjugated with tetrazine for the labeling of norbornene-modified µgels. The lyophilized product (Alexa Flour 488-Tet) was dissolved in dimethylformamide at 1 mg/mL and stored at -20 °C.\n\t\nTo fluorescently label the µgels, first prepare a working solution of Alexa Fluor 488-Tet by diluting the 1 mg/mL stock 1:14 in sterile 1x PBS. In a sterile hood, combine the µgels with the working solution (2:1 by volume).\nUse a displacement pipette and mix well. Incubate the mixture for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge (5,000 x g) and aspirate the staining solution. Wash the µgels twice with 1x PBS (1:1 by volume) to remove unreacted Alexa Fluor 488-Tet.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the fluorescently labeled µgels can be imaged on a confocal microscope to quantify the microgel size (Figure 1C-E)9. Methods for measuring microgel size have been thoroughly described by Roosa et al.17.\nDrying HA-NB microgels",
    "Transfer purified µgels (Figure 2A) to a cryo-safe screw-cap tube using a positive displacement pipette. Add 70% ethanol to the purified µgels 50% (v/v) and mix well with a displacement pipette. Centrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g.\n\t\tCAUTION: Ethanol is a highly flammable substance.\n\t\tNOTE: The cryo-safe screw-cap tube can be weighed prior to adding µgels, and then weighed again after lyophilization to determine the mass of µgels. This is recommended to minimize error when using quantities less than 1 mg. Ensure that the scale is internally adjusted or calibrated prior to use.\nAspirate the supernatant liquid and replace with 70% ethanol (50% v/v) (Figure 2B). Mix well with a displacement pipette. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Microgels can be stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C prior to lyophilization for long-term storage, if needed. Lyophilized microgels are shown in Figure 2C. Other lyophilization media can be used in this step if cryogel formation is desired (Figure 2D).\nBriefly centrifuge to ensure the µgels are at the bottom of the screw-cap tube. Add liquid nitrogen to a cryogenic container, and then add the tube of µgels to flash-freeze.\nAfter 5-10 min, remove the tube of µgels with forceps. Quickly remove the cap and cover with a lab-grade tissue. Secure the tissue with a rubber band and transfer to a lyophilization container or chamber.\nLoad the sample on the lyophilizer following the manufacturer's instructions. Lyophilize at 0.066 Torr and -63 °C. Store the lyophilized µgels (lyo-µgels) tightly sealed at room temperature.\n\t\t​NOTE: Lyophilization is complete when all liquid is removed from the tube and a dried product remains. Organic solvents can decrease the longevity of the rubber fixtures on common lyophilization systems.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64554/64554fig02.jpg",

MAP scaffold fabrication\nTetrazine linker synthesis\n\tNOTE: Tetrazine linkers can be used to interlink µgels bearing free norbornene groups (Figure 3A). HA-tetrazine (HA-Tet) synthesis procedure was adapted from Zhang et al.18 using 79 kDa sodium HA with molar equivalents of 1:1:0.25 of HA-repeat units to DMTMM to tetrazine-amine (Figure 3B)12.\n\t\nWeigh the reactants. Dissolve the HA at 20 mg/mL in 200 mM MES buffer (pH ~6) by stirring in a beaker or flask on a stir plate. Once dissolved, add the DMTMM to the HA solution and allow to react for approximately 20 min at room temperature. For example, 100 mg HA + 72.8 mg DMTMM + 14.14 mg tetrazine-amine can be used.\nDissolve the tetrazine-amine at 15 mg/mL in 200 mM MES buffer and add dropwise to the HA/DMTMM solution. Refer to Figure 3C for the HA-Tet reaction setup.",
    "Add parafilm to the opening of the reaction vessel to minimize evaporation and cover the reaction vessel with foil. Continue stirring while allowing the reaction to proceed for approximately 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, chill 200 proof ethanol (approximately 10x the reaction volume). On a stir plate, transfer the reaction dropwise to the chilled ethanol to precipitate the HA-Tet (Figure 3D) and continue stirring for 20 min.\nTransfer the solution to 50 mL conical tubes, and then centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 10 min. Pour off the excess ethanol to dispose as waste. Pull vacuum on the HA-Tet in a dessicator to dry overnight. An example of the dried product at this step in the protocol can be found in Figure 3E.\nPurify the HA-Tet using dialysis. Dissolve HA-Tet in 2 M NaCl solution and transfer to cellulose dialysis tubing with a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cut-off. Transfer the filled dialysis tubing to a bucket with 5 L of ultrapure water, and dialyze the HA-Tet against water overnight.\nThe next day, remove the water and replace with 1 M NaCl solution for 30 min. Remove the NaCl solution, and then dialyze against ultrapure water for 3 days, replacing the water daily.\nFilter the dialyzed product using 0.2 µm vacuum-driven filter, and then transfer the filtered HA-Tet product to 50 mL conical tubes.\nFlash-freeze the conical tubes in liquid nitrogen for 10 min, and then remove the conical tubes with forceps. Quickly remove the cap and cover with a lab-grade tissue. Secure the tissue with a rubber band and transfer to a lyophilization container or chamber and lyophilize. Store the lyophilized product (Figure 3F) at -20 °C.\nQuantify tetrazine modification by dissolving the HA-Tet at 10 mg/mL in D2O and analyzing via proton NMR (Figure 3G)16.",
    "To determine the amount of functionalization, first calibrate the D2O solvent peak to 4.8 PPM. Integrate the peak for the HA methyl protons (δ2.05) and calibrate the integration to 3.0. Next, integrate the peaks for the pendant tetrazine groups at δ8.5 (2H) and δ7.7 (2H) (aromatic protons). Normalize the integration of these peaks to the corresponding number of protons to determine the average degree of modification12.\nInterlinking lyo-µgels to form MAP scaffolds for characterization\n\t\nPrepare the MAP scaffold components (i.e., µgels, HA-Tet, rehydration volume). Weigh the lyo-µgels (Figure 4A) and reconstitute in 84% of the final MAP volume of 1x PBS. Allow the microgels to swell for approximately 20 min (Figure 4B,C). The wt% MAP used for rehydration can be chosen based on the user's preference for final particle fraction (refer to Figure 4D, E).\nDissolve the HA-Tet in 1x PBS at the chosen concentration (see NOTE below).\n\t\tNOTE: Changing both the packing fraction (via wt% MAP) as well as the concentration of HA-Tet will alter bulk scaffold mechanical properties. For example, a 3.4 wt% MAP scaffold crosslinked with 0.02 mg/mL HA-Tet (annealing ratio of 2.6 mol Tet:mol HA-NB) generates MAP scaffolds with approximately 700 Pa shear storage modulus12.\nUse a displacement pipette to combine the HA-Tet and lyo-µgels and mix well. At this point, the mixture can be transferred via displacement pipette onto glass slides, well plates, or a container of the user's choosing. Allow µgels to anneal at 37 °C for 25 min, and then use a spatula to transfer the MAP scaffolds to well plates filled with 1x PBS. Keep MAP scaffolds in 1x PBS until ready for characterization.\nCalculating MAP scaffold particle fraction",
    "For improved image quality, transfer MAP scaffold to a glass coverslip using a spatula. Image MAP scaffolds on a confocal microscope using the laser for FITC excitation and emission. Image MAP scaffolds on a 20x objective and obtain a Z-stack traversing 250-300 µm in the Z-direction with a step size of 2.5 µm. Make note of the µm/pixel calibration of the image.\nImport the Z-stack image into the analysis software (see Table of Materials). Select the Add New Surfaces button. Check the box to Segment Only a Region of Interest, and then select the blue arrow button Next: Region of Interest.\nDefine a region of interest, keeping track of the X-, Y-, and Z-dimensions of the volume being analyzed. Select the blue arrow button Next: Source Channel.\n\t\tNOTE: X- and Y-dimensions are in units of pixels while the Z-dimension is the number of steps. A recommended Z-height for the region of interest should include a minimum of two µgels.\nUse the Source Channel drop-down list to select the FITC channel. Check the box next to Smooth and input a surface detail of 2.50 µm. Under Thresholding, select Absolute Intensity, and then select the blue arrow button Next: Threshold.\nUse the suggested thresholding value for the FITC channel. Rotate the 3D projection to assess the rendering quality and adjust as needed. Select Next: Classify Surfaces.\n\t\tNOTE: The Back button can be used to edit previous steps in the process, such as Z-dimension, as needed.\nCheck whether Number of Voxels is 10.0, and then select the green double arrow button Finish: Execute all creation steps and terminate the wizard.\n\t\tNOTE: Volume rendering parameters can be stored for batch analysis so that the same settings are applied to analyze all the scaffolds.",
    "To export the data, select the Statistics tab, and then the Detailed tab. Use the second drop-down box to select the variable Volume. Select the floppy disk button Export Statistics on Tab Display to File and save as a spreadsheet file (.xls) when prompted.\nOpen the file and use the SUM function on Column A Volume to determine the total volume (µm3) of the µgels in the region of interest.\nConvert the dimensions of the region of interest that was analyzed from pixels to µm. Use the µm/pixel calibration of the image from step 4.3.1 to convert the X- and Y-dimensions. Multiply the Z-dimension (number of steps) by the step size for the image to convert the Z-dimension to µm. Calculate the volume of the region of interest (µm3) by multiplying the X-, Y-, and Z-dimensions.\nTo determine the particle fraction of the scaffold, divide the total volume of the µgels in the region of interest (found in step 4.3.8) by the volume of the region of interest (found in step 4.3.9).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64554/64554fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Synthesis of tetrazine linker for the fabrication of microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds.

The diameter of the inner wells and outer wells are 4 mm and 6 mm, respectively.\nMix polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer base with the curing agent at a 10:1 ratio by mass. Pour the PDMS mixture into a large plastic Petri dish and degas in a desiccator for approximately 30 min or until all the bubbles have disappeared.",
    "Once all the bubbles have disappeared, carefully place the 3D printed mold into the PDMS to minimize the formation of new bubbles. Place in the oven at 60 °C for at least 2 h to cure the PDMS.\nUse a knife or razor blade to gently trace around the parameter of the culture device, and then carefully remove the mold. Use a 4 mm biopsy punch to remove any PDMS from the bottom of the wells. Cut the devices to fit on a glass coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell culture devices can also be bonded to glass slides, but glass coverslips improve sample imaging.\nUse tape to remove dust from the bottom side of the culture devices. Place the clean glass coverslips and culture devices (bottom side up) on a hot plate at 135 °C for at least 15 min to remove moisture.\nIn a fume hood, use a corona plasma gun on high on both the glass coverslip and the bottom side of the device for 30 s, and then quickly bond the treated surfaces together. Gently apply pressure to ensure a good seal between the culture device and glass coverslip.\nRepeat step 5.1.6 for all devices, and then place in a 60 °C oven overnight to secure the bond. Autoclave the devices to sterilize before use in vitro.\nCell culture in MAP scaffolds\n\t\nPrepare the MAP scaffold components (i.e., µgels, HA-Tet, media volume) based on the desired particle fraction (refer to Figure 4D-E). Weigh the lyo-µgels in a sterile hood and reconstitute in 84% of the final MAP volume of cell media based on the chosen wt% MAP. Allow the µgels to swell for approximately 20 min.",
    "NOTE: These methods require the user to weigh the lyo-microgel product for rehydration. For small masses (1 mg or less), it is suggested to first weigh the cryotube before adding and lyophilizing µgels, and then reweigh the tube after lyophilization to determine the mass of the product to minimize error.\nDissolve the HA-Tet in cell media in 16% of the final MAP volume.\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps for preparing cells for seeding in MAP scaffolds can be altered depending on the cell type being used. In this protocol, D1 mouse mesenchymal cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (pen-strep) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (see Table of Materials). Standard adherent cell culture protocols should be followed for these cells, with the cultures maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in tissue culture-treated culture vessels.\nOnce D1 mouse mesenchymal cells have reached 70%-80% confluency, aspirate the media and wash the cells with 1x PBS. Lift the cells by adding enough volume of 1% trypsin-EDTA to cover to surface of the tissue culture vessel. Incubate at 37 °C for 1-3 min, and then quench the trypsinization by adding DMEM media supplemented with 1% pen-strep and 10% FBS at 2x the volume of trypsin-EDTA.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 100 x g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells. Aspirate the supernatant media and resuspend the cells in 1 mL DMEM media supplemented with 1% pen-strep and 10% FBS.\nEnsure the cell suspension is well mixed, and then transfer 20 µL to a new microcentrifuge tube. Add 20 µL trypan blue solution and mix well. Use 20 µL of this mixture to count the cells using either a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter with cell counting chamber slides.",
    "Transfer the number of cells needed for seeding 10,000 cells/µL MAP to a new microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells. Carefully aspirate the supernatant media from the cell pellet without aspirating the cells.\nAdd the µgels and crosslinker to the cell pellet with a displacement pipette. Mix well with a displacement pipette, and then seed 10 µL of the mixture per well. When plating, pipette in a circular motion to evenly distribute the mixture in the well.\nAllow the µgels to anneal at 37 °C in the cell incubator for 25 min before adding cell media to fill the wells (~50 µL of media per well). Maintain the 3D cultures at 37 °C and change media as needed. To avoid aspirating the scaffold when changing media, stabilize the pipette tip along the ridge of the upper well.\n\t\tNOTE: When adding or removing liquid from the culture wells, rest the end of the pipette tip on the ledge above the MAP scaffold to minimize the chance of disrupting or aspirating the scaffold from the well.\nAt the desired time points, fix samples by removing the media and adding 50 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde per well for 30 min at room temperature. Wash the samples 3x with 50 µL of 1x PBS or preferred buffer. At this point in the protocol, standard methods for immunofluorescence or fluorescence staining can be followed, using 50 µL per well as the working volume.\n\t\tNOTE: These methods for fixation and cell staining specifically describe the use of fluorescent stains; however, immunostaining with primary and/or secondary antibody conjugations can be performed in these scaffolds as well following the manufacturer's instructions using 50 µL as the working volume per well.",
    "Image cells in MAP scaffolds on a confocal microscope using a 20x objective and obtain a Z-stack traversing 200-250 µm in the Z-direction with a step size of 2.5 µm. An example of fluorescence staining with DAPI (nuclear stain diluted 1:1000 in 0.15% Triton-X in 1x PBS) and phalloidin-647 (F-actin stain diluted 1:40 in 0.15% Triton-X in 1x PBS) is shown in Figure 5E, F with fixed D1 cells cultured in MAP scaffolds for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Plasma treatment of glass surfaces results in increased hydrophilicity, which has been shown to enhance cell adhesion. Cells will likely be observed spreading along the bottom of the cell culture wells but should not be included in cell counts or cell volume quantification for assessing cell response in MAP scaffolds.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64554/64554fig05.jpg",
    "Figure 5: Cell culture in MAP scaffolds. (A) The mold for creating cell culture wells can be 3D printed and cast with PDMS. The entire mold is 95 mm in diameter, the large wells are 6 mm in diameter, and the small inner wells are 4 mm in diameter. (B) Once cast with PDMS, the cell culture devices are plasma bonded to coverslips for improved microscopy capabilities. (C) The cross section of a cell culture well depicts the reservoir for cell media (~50 µL) and a smaller reservoir for seeding MAP scaffold with cells (~10 µL). (D) The process of seeding cells in MAP scaffolds first relies on the rehydration of lyo-µgels at the user's desired wt%, followed by mixing with cells and the crosslinker for interlinking the µgels. (E) Cells can be encapsulated in MAP scaffolds (green) with varied wt% MAP. Representative images are from day 5 of D1 cell culture in MAP scaffolds (scale bar = 100 µm). (F) Single Z-slices show differences in cell growth in scaffolds comprising different wt% MAP (scale bar = 50 µm). Reprinted from Anderson et al.12 with permission from Elsevier.
