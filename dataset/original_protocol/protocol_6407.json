    "Note: All procedures are performed on ice and all centrifugations are performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Preparation of cytosol from Rat LiverDissect out livers from a couple of large Sprague-Dawley rats. Each liver typically weighs around 15 g. Usually the final yield per liver is around 15 ml of cytosolic fraction with a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml.Note: An application to use large Sprague-Dawley rats needs to be submitted and approved by the University of Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA). Upon dissection, place each liver in chilled 50 ml Corning tube, rinse three times with cold PBS (around 25 ml per wash).Weigh livers, then cut up into a mush with razor blade and dissection scissors on an ice-cold Petri dish. Add 2 ml cold Buffer E per 1 g liver (Recipe A1).Homogenize in large Dounce with drill press in batches (around 1 liver per batch) in cold room. 5 strokes with medium-fitting pestle, then 5 strokes with tight-fitting pestle. To be careful, wear goggles. After homogenization, rat livers will be homogenized to tiny pieces and large fragments of rat livers will not be clearly detected.Centrifuge the whole homogenate in 50 ml tubes at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in Eppendorf®  5418R  refrigerated centrifuge using FA-45-18-11 rotor. Collect supernatant and discard pellet.Centrifuge the supernatant at 18,459 x g for 20 min at 4 °C in Beckman Coulter high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Avanti® J-E) using JA-25.50 rotor. Collect supernatant and discard pellet.Centrifuge the supernatant at 125,171 x g for 1 h at 4 °C in Hitachi ultracentrifuge (Hitachi ultracentrifuge) using T-865 rotor.Take the deep red fraction (avoid pellet and the floating fat layer) and repeat high speed spin 2 or 3 times.",
    "Determine protein concentration by the Bradford assay and aliquot in 100 μl and 1 ml amounts.Note: a concentration range of 18-30 mg/ml is considered as a successful extraction. Snap freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.Note: The centrifugation steps to prepare rat liver cytosol are shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200229/20200229045157_7196.pngFigure 1. The centrifugation steps to prepare rat liver cytosolPreparation of donor membranes (DM) from cultured HEK 293T cells (prepare on the day of the reaction, Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200229/20200229045221_8864.pngFigure 2. Schematic overview of the assay to reconstitute vesicular release from the TGN. The preparations of semi-intact cells as donor membranes (DM) for the budding reaction and the procedures of the vesicle formation assay and isolation of vesicles produced from semi-intact cells were described in Procedures B and C respectively. Efficiency of the packaging of cargos into vesicles were measured by immunoblotting as described in Procedure D (this Figure is revised from Ma et al., 2018). The DM are also needed for immunoblotting.Culture two 10 cm plates of HEK 293T cells in GIBCO Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 milliunits/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C in a cell culture CO2 incubator providing 5% CO2 and around 95% relative humidity. The cells will be grown to 80-100% confluent on the day of the experiment.Note: Transfect plasmids encoding cargo proteins 24 h before the day of experiment if necessary. Aspirate media from two 10 cm plates of HEK 293T cells.Wash the cells with 5 ml PBS each plate for 2 times.Add 10 ml Opti-MEM containing 10% FBS into each plate, seal the plate with parafilm and flow it at 20 °C water bath for 2 h.Wash the cells with 5 ml PBS for 2 times for each plate.",
    "Add 1 ml 0.25% trypsin to each plate and incubate at RT for 2 min.Collect cells from each plate with 6 ml PBS buffer into one15 ml Falcon tube.Add 25 μl 10 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor to each tube and mix well.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 4 ml 1× KHM buffer (Recipe A1) in each tube.Add 4 μl digitonin (stock 40 mg/ml in DMSO) to the cells so that final concentration is 40 μg/ml. Mix well and incubate on ice for 5 min.Add 8 ml 1× KHM buffer to the cells in each tube, invert the tube and immediately pellet the cells at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml 1× KHM buffer in each tube and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Note: To check if permeabilization is working or not, add 3 μl of cells to 3 μl trypan blue, carefully lay a cover slip over the sample, then check percentage of permeabilized cells under a light microscope with a 16× objective. 100% of cells should be permeabilized at this stage. The nucleus is blue and the intact ER is brown. If the permealization is not working well, a freshly made solution of digitonin is recommended to perform the experiments. Incubate the cells on ice for 5 min, pellet the cells at 10,000 x g for 5 s at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 130 μl 1× KHM buffer in each tube and combine the suspensions of semi-intact cells into one 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Reconstitution of the release of vesicles from the TGNIn low retention tubes, assemble vesicle budding reactions by adding ingredients in Table 1.",
    "Each 100 μl reaction contains ATP regeneration system (1 mM ATP, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase in KHM buffer), 0.2 mM GTP, 1 μg Sar1A H79G protein (a GTPase defective mutant version of Sar1A) and rat liver cytosol (4 mg/ml).Note: Sar1A H79G protein is a C-terminal His-tagged protein purified from E. coli. Add KHM buffer, nucleotides and Sar1A H79G protein first. Mix well by pipetting and briefly centrifuge to collect liquid at the bottom of each tube. Then add semi-intact cells and mix by pipetting up and down gently until homogenous. Add rat liver cytosol last and mix by gentle pipetting.Table 1. The ingredients added in the TGN vesicle formation assayimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200229/20200229045246_8312.pngNote: Each column represents a single experimental group. Each row represents a component of the reaction and the volume added to the reaction in μl. The total volume of the reaction is 500 μl. The experimental group without nucleotide is used to monitor the level of cytosolic proteins that are diffused to the vesicle fraction after centrifugation and to monitor the level of cargo proteins that are in the vesicle fraction independent of GTP and ATP. The experimental group performed in the presence of GMPNP, a non-hydrolysable analog of GTP, is to monitor the level of cytosolic and cargo proteins that are present in the vesicle fraction independent of GTP hydrolysis. Sar1A (H79G) is defective in GTP hydrolysis and inhibits packaging of cargo proteins into COPII vesicles. This protein is added to the budding reaction to inhibit COPII-mediated vesicle formation from the ER.Incubate reactions at 32 °C for 1 h.Transfer reactions to ice to stop reaction after incubation.Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C in Eppendorf®  5418R  refrigerated centrifuge using FA-45-18-11 rotor to remove cell debris and large membranes.",
    "Mix supernatant with cold 60% (w/v) OptiPrepTM and 10× KHM buffer (Recipe A3) to reach final concentration at 35% (w/v) OptiPrepTM in 1× KHM buffer.Note: The OptiPrepTM gradient is a 60% (w/v) solution of iodixanol in water (sterile). Transfer mixed sample to the bottom of polypropylene copolymer ultracentrifuge tube (2.2 ml capacity volume, Hitachi Koki S300536A) as the bottom layer.Overlay with 30% (w/v) OptiPrepTM in 1× KHM buffer [prepared by mixing equal volume of 60% OptiPrepTM and 2× KHM buffer (Recipe A2)] by slowly pipetting against the wall using a gel-loading tip to the ultracentrifuge tube as the medium layer until the tube is almost filled with the whole sample (bottom layer + medium layer).Note: An interphase should be observed between 30% OptiPrepTM and the supernatant OptiPrepTM mixture at this stage. Overlay with 50 μl 1× KHM buffer at the top layer by pipetting slowly using a gel-loading tip.Note: An interphase should be observed between 1× KHM and 30% OptiPrepTM in 1× KHM. Centrifuge the ultracentrifuge tubes containing the sample at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 90 min at the Acceleration Setting (Accel) 3 and Decel 4 in Hitachi Koki himac CS150NX micro ultracentrifuge (Hitachi) using S55S-2080 rotor. After centrifugation, the released vesicles will be concentrated at the interface between 1x KHM and 30% OptiPrepTM in 1× KHM.Collect vesicles by taking 200 μl supernatant from the top after centrifugation. Transfer the supernatant to thick wall polycarbonate tubes (Beckman Coulter, 0.5 ml capacity volume,  343776  ). Add 300 μl 1x KHM buffer to dilute samples by gently pipetting.Centrifuge at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min in Hitachi Koki himac CS150NX micro ultracentrifuge (Hitachi) using S120AT3-2061 rotor to spin down vesicles.",
    "ImmunoblotPerform standard immunoblotting procedure by the following steps:Add 20 μl 1× SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer at the bottom of the tube, vortex 8 min to dissolve the vesicles in loading buffer using the cell disruptor (Disruptor Genie®).Add DM to 20 μl lysis buffer (Recipe A11) and incubate on ice for 30 min.Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant.Add 5× SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer (Recipe A4) into the supernatant to reach a final concentration of 1× SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer.Incubate both DM sample and high spin pellet (HSP) samples at 55 °C for 30 min.Load the DM sample and HSP samples onto a 15 wedged well 10-15% gel according to the cargo protein size.Run SDS-PAGE at constant 20 mA until dye runs out of the gel (about 70 min) at RT.Transfer protein onto a PVDF membrane at constant 0.3 A for 1-2 h at 4 °C.Block the PVDF membrane with 5% blotting-Grade Blocker in PBST (Recipe A7) for 30 min at RT.Incubate the PVDF membrane with primary antibodies at RT for 1.5-2 h or at 4 °C overnight.Wash with PBST 3 × 5 min.Incubate with secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP at RT for 1 h.Wash with PBST 3 × 5 min.Incubate with the HRP substrate ECL plus and image on a ChemiDocTM Imaging System with ImageLab software v4.0."
