    "The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical University of Vienna and has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards found in the Declaration of Helsinki. An informed consent was signed by all patients and controls before the study.\n1. Installation of the patient in the chair\nPerform the measurement binocularly. Install the patient in a stable chair with a backrest and a head fixation unit. The latter maintains the patient's head in a stable and defined position and consists of an elastic headband and a u-shaped headrest, which can be fixed to each other using an adhesive strap. Place the chair in a closable cabin allowing assessment of the SVV in the dark.\nPosition the headrest in the desired inclination angle (0°, ± 15° or ± 30°) by aligning it along the scale of a goniometer, which is attached to the chair's backrest. At the beginning of the experiment adjust the headrest at 0° inclination at suboccipital height.\nPlace the elastic headband on the patient's head and fix it with the screw on the back. Ensure that the headband in not positioned too low on the patient's forehead, so that it does not impair eye motility.\nConnect the adhesive straps – on the headband and on the headrest – with each other. This ensures an optimal fixation of the head to the headrest on the chair.\n2. Installation of the SVV unit\nMount the SVV unit by means of the fixation device on the chair in front of the patient (Figure 1a). The SVV unit consists of a LED light bar attached to a stick, allowing positioning in front of the patient. The position of the light bar can be adjusted in the roll plane through a connected potentiometer.",
    "Make sure that the SVV unit is firmly fixed and that the light bar is positioned exactly opposite to the patient's head and at the same level as the patient's eyes.\nConnect the SVV unit to the electrical connection underneath the chair.\nPlace the potentiometer in the patient's left hand and instruct them on how to perform the SVV setting. While standing in front of the patient, adjust the position of the light bar again, if necessary, to ensure its position along the coronary plane.\nRead the SVV deviation from the true vertical on the goniometer on the back of the SVV unit. The goniometer contains an angle display of ±20° at 2° intervals and is equipped with an infrared camera placed 3 cm in front of the display, allowing continuous data acquisition in complete darkness (Figure 1b, 1c).\nBefore continuing with the next step, check the visibility on the screen. The infrared-image of the angle display is transmitted to a screen outside of the cabin, ensuring that the patient's SVV estimates can be collected continuously without having to open the cabin door between tests, therefore preventing visual re-orientation.\n3. Calibration under visual control\nTilt the light bar 30° to the right or left relative to the absolute vertical (which serves as start position before each SVV task) and ask the patient to adjust it to the vertical position under visual control. This serves to self-calibrate the patient and to check the visuomotor ability of the patient.\nIf the patient confirms the displayed SVV position, compare it with the actual vertical.\nIf the patient's setting deviates significantly from the actual vertical, check the orthograde position of the SVV unit again. A deviation of ±1° is tolerable to confirm intact visuomotor function.\n4. SVV setting in neutral head position",
    "Open the examination protocol for simultaneous entry of the SVV estimates. The protocol allows the documentation of the measurements during the experiment and randomly determines whether the SVV task is performed from the +30° or -30° starting position.\nClose the cabin door so that the patient is in complete darkness throughout the experiment. Check by intercom if the patient can understand the instructions well. Ask the patient now to tilt the light bar in the starting position: 30° to the right or to the left (randomization according to the protocol, Figure 1d).\nAfter a waiting period of 15 s, instruct the patient to adjust the lightbar from the starting position until it reaches the subjective vertical. The patient is not under time pressure and can still correct the set position at any time. The patient confirms the setting verbally via the intercom system.\nEnter the tilt angle shown on the display in degrees in the protocol. Per definition, mark clockwise angle deviations with a plus, while mark counterclockwise deviations with a minus. In total, let the patient adjust the SVV in 6 passes, whereby the starting position of ±30° is randomized.\nAfter completion of the trial in neutral head position, perform the test with head tilting in the roll plane. The tilt direction sequence (-30°, -15°, +15° and +30°) is also randomized for each patient.\n5. SVV setting with head tilt\nUndo the initial head fixation by disconnecting the adhesive straps.\nLoosen the headrest and adapt the tilt position according to the protocol: 15° or 30° to the right or to the left. Make sure that the headrest is exactly aligned along the respective angle at the goniometer, which is attached to the chair's backrest. Fix the headrest in this position firmly.",
    "Fix the patient's head with the elastic headband to the headrest. Ensure that this head tilt is tolerable for the patient and adapt the height of the headrest if needed. Instruct the patient to maintain this head position during the trial.\nClose the cabin door and perform the trial as in the neutral head position.\nUpon completion of the trial, undo the head restraint and adjust the headrest according to the randomized head-tilt position given by the protocol.\nClose the cabin door again and perform the same procedures until all SVV settings in all head tilts have been recorded.\nSubscription Required.
