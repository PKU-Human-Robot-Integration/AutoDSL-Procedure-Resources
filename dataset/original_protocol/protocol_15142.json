    "1. Case Presentation\nThe patient is set up for a visit at the gynecological clinic, often due to the occurrence of bleeding disorders. A physical examination is performed.\n\t\nIf deemed appropriate, the patient is scheduled for a hysterectomy. The paperwork is prepared, and the patient is given the premedication for the day of surgery.\nPatients 60 years and older must first submit blood samples and monitored by electrocardiography (or ECG) prior to the procedure.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient is not allowed to consume anything by mouth for six hours prior to admittance.\n\t\nAn exception is made for sweet clear drinks without pulp, which are allowed until two hours prior to admittance.\nThe patient takes the premedication (t.Paracetemol 1 g + t.Etodolac 300 mg + t.Dexamethason 8 mg) with the last drink.\nThe patient is admitted app. one hour prior to the scheduled time of surgery.\n\t\nThe ward nurse first prepares the patient for surgery.\nThe anesthesiologist examines the patient and prepares the papers for anesthesia.\nWhen the operation room is prepared and the team is ready, the gynecologist transports the patient to the operating room.\n\t\nThe patient lies down on the operating table and is covered with a surgical blanket.\nAn i.v. line is placed in the left hand and 1,000 ml of saline is started. Monitoring equipment is attached.\nAnesthesia is induced with propofol and remifentanil until Loss Of Consciousness (LOC) occurs, and maintained using TOF.\nFor facilitating intubation, a small dose of rocuronium (15 mg) is administered.\nDirect laryngoscopy is performed. If it is difficult to visualize the vocal cord, the McGrath videolaryngoscop is used. Intubation is subsequently performed.\nInsufflation of the abdomen is started at 12 mm Hg CO2.\n\t\nThe ports are placed.\nThe procedure is started.",
    "The surgeons are told when Train Of Four (TOF) ratio is > 90%, corresponding to the neuromuscular blockade is weaned off.\nAt the neck of the grasper the distance from the promontory to the surface of the skin at the umbilicus is marked.\nThe grasper is placed on the surgical table. With measuring tape, the distance between the end of the grasper and the neck of the grasper (at surgeon's finger) is marked, and then calculated distance is measured in centimeters.\nThe insufflations pressure of CO2 is lowered to 8 mm Hg.\n\t\nAt the neck of the grasper the distance from the promontory to the surface of the skin at the umbilicus is marked.\nThe grasper is placed at the table. With measuring tape the marked distance is interpreted to centimeters.\nCO2 insufflation pressure is adjusted to 12 mm Hg.\n\t\nDeep neuromuscular blockade is applied to a Post Tetanic Count (PTC) < 2.\nAt the neck of the grasper the distance from the promontory to the surface of the skin at the umbilicus is marked.\nThe grasper is placed at the table. With measuring tape the marked distance is measured to centimeters.\nCO2 insufflation pressure is lowered to 8 mm Hg.\n\t\nAt the neck of the grasper the distance from the promontory to the surface of the skin at the umbilicus is marked.\nAt the neck of the grasper the distance from the promontory to the surface of the skin at the umbilicus is marked.\nThe procedure is finished.\n\t\nInfusions of propofol and remifentanil are terminated.\nThe patient is woken up and moved to his or her bed.\nThe patient is transferred to the Recovery Room.\nSubscription Required.
