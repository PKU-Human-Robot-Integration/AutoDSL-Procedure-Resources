    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse perfusion, brain harvest and cryopreservation\nTiming: 3 days\nThis part of the protocol will guide you through harvesting mouse brains through transcardial perfusion to prepare for a variety of downstream assays such as cryosection and imaging analysis or fresh microglia isolation.\nDay 1\nMouse anesthesia.\nUsing a 1 cc syringe, anesthetize the mouse with IP injection of 100 mg/kg Ketamine and 1 mg/kg Xylazine in accordance with IACUC guidelines.\nNote: check for motor reflex by pinching the hind paws before proceeding onto dissection.\nOptional: meanwhile, heat up the PBS and PFA solutions by microwave to 37°C for an optimal fixation result; use ice-cold D-PBS only if proceeding to fresh brain/cortex collection for downstream cell isolation or molecular assays.\nTranscardial perfusion.\nOnce the mouse shows no sign of pain and motor reflex, pin the four limbs onto a Styrofoam board with four 25 G needles.\nSanitize and prepare the chest and abdomen area with 70% ethanol.\nUsing the rat tooth forceps to pinch the abdominal skin and make a small incision upward through the skin and peritoneum, and then cut parallel through the diaphragm, then parallel to the body through the ribs to just above the heart.\nNote: Please be careful not to nick the liver and lung (avoid by gently push down the liver with the side of the scissors while cutting) because the efficiency of the perfusion will be compromised. Be sure to also cut away the connective tissue around the heart as well for a full and unobstructed display of the heart.\nClamp the sternum/rib with a pair of hemostats to open the rib cage.",
    "Gently nick the right atrium, then inject the needle tip laterally into the left ventricle in the lower left quadrant of the heart at an upward 20-degree angle toward the midline.\nNote: a nick in the right atrium should result in blood oozing out; the injection needle is covered by a short piece of Tegon tubing ‘sleeve’ so that only the tip and the beveled edge of the needle is exposed in order to prevent over-puncturing the heart.\nPerfuse for 30 s- 1 min with PBS/Heparin at speed of 0.3 mL/s at 37°C if followed by PFA fixation. Alternatively, if collecting fresh brains, perfuse with a total of 2 min by ice-cold D-PBS.\nNote: the first sign of a good perfusion at this point is that the liver should switch from dark red to pale mustard color8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: real time transcardial perfusion, related to step 2f).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Demonstration of transcardial perfusion with PBS and PFA solution, related to step 2f\nNote the angle of the needle and the liver changing color over time.\nIf collecting fresh brains, jump to step 35 for “Isolation of soluble Aβ from transgenic AD mouse cortex and hippocampus and its measurement by sandwich ELISA”, otherwise switch over to perfusing with 4% PFA/PBS for 5 min at 37°C or room temperature, add 30 s- 1 min each step for aged/larger mice.\nNote: a good fixation should result in stiff body and organs, and the brain should be devoid of red patches and visible vasculature pattern.\nBrain dissection and preparation.\nDecapitate the fixed mouse, then make an incision down the midline to tease apart the skin of the head.",
    "Then from the temple-posterior side inward and forward, gently nick and peel away the skull bone using bone scissors starting from the cerebellum and brainstem.\nNote: be careful to cut away from the brain to not damage the brain parenchyma and delicate parts such as the olfactory bulb and cerebellum. For a detailed step-by-step protocol for the dissection of mouse brain, please refer to Meyerhoff et al.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nPlace the dissected whole brain into the acrylic mouse brain matrix, align with symmetry and slice down the midline with a clean razor blade to separate the two hemispheres.\nFor fresh brain collection, place two hemispheres on a petridish on ice lined with a filter paper pre-wetted with PBS or continue to protocol “Isolation of soluble Aβ from transgenic AD mouse cortex and hippocampus and its measurement by sandwich ELISA” (step 35) below for using fresh frozen tissue for downstream assays.\nFor fixed brain collection, immerse the dissected brain hemispheres into a glass vial filled with at least 10 mL of 4% PFA in PBS for fixation overnight at 4°C.\nDay 2\nSwitch to 30% sucrose/PBS (at least 10 mL per brain) to infiltrate overnight at 4°C.\nNote: A full infiltration of 30% sucrose as cryoprotectant for CNS tissues would result in the brains sinking into the bottom of the vials, so do not proceed if the brains have not sunken. Using 30% sucrose/PBS is crucial for preventing the formation of ice crystals and other freezing artifacts when processing CNS tissues.\nPause point: the brain hemispheres can be stored in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4°C for up to a week if not immediately prepared for frozen tissue block for cryosection; after that, 0.1%–0.2% of PFA will need to be added so as not to reverse the paraformaldehyde crosslink.\nDay 3",
    "Fill the foil mold to 90% fullness with TFM (Tissue Freezing Medium).\nNote: TFM, which cuts more smoothly than OCT at colder temperature (e.g., at −25°C), is used to freeze PFA-fixed tissues in general; OCT is used for freezing fresh frozen tissues (and cut best at −20°C to −15°C).\nWe customize our tissue freezing molds using foil of tissue-fitted sizes to ensure fast conduction to the center of the tissue block (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2196-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Homemade brain tissue freezing foil molds that are optimized for rapid freezing for downstream sagittal cryosections (image courtesy of Patrick Burrola)\nAvoid bubbles. Use tweezer tips or pipette tips to fish out bubbles if any.\nFill a glass petri dish with 20–30 mL of isopentane and set on dry ice to cool down.\nNote: Keep this system under a chemical hood or suction system to remove any fume from the isopentane.\nDrop a chuck of dry ice into isopentane to speed up the cooling. When the liquid reaches the proper temperature, it will stop boiling and is ready for freezing tissue blocks.\nUse curved tweezers, gently pick up the brain hemispheres from sucrose and thoroughly blot dry their surfaces using Kimwipe tissues.\nNote: This step is crucial because residual sucrose on the surface will result in edges of the tissue section curling and detaching from the mounting media when cutting.\nDrench the brain with TFM on a paper towel, then pick it up gently using curved scissors and guide the hemisphere all the way to the bottom of the foil molds with the flat midline side facing down until adherence.\nNote: Gently push the hemisphere down including more delicate parts such as the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum to ensure flat sagittal cryosections.",
    "Remove the frozen block from the isopentane once the center of the block solidifies. Store the frozen blocks in –70°C for long term storage.\nCryosection of mouse brain\nTiming: ∼30 min/brain\nTFM tissue blocks with frozen brain hemisphere are cryosectioned at −25°C.\nLabel microscopy slides with permanent markers or pencil.\nTo obtain sufficient technical replicates and consistent and representative cryosections for quantification purposes, we mount a serial set of 15 μm sagittal sections (5 sections/slide and 5 or 10 slides per hemisphere, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2196-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Serially mounted sagittal brain cryosections on glass microscopy slides\nScale bar, 20 mm.\nNote: we used hippocampus and lateral ventricles as our anatomical landmarks and a mouse brain atlas as a reference map (ISPN: 9780123742445).\nStarting trimming from the midline, then start collecting from when the hippocampus begin to be fully shown (with DG, CA3 and CA1 shown on the same plane), from approximately 0.25 mm–0.85 mm from the midline, each spaced 0.15 mm apart.\nUse a thin art brush to guide the TFM bottom edge of a section downward to obtain a flat and smooth surface, be careful to grab with the brush on the mounting media but not on the tissue section to prevent damaging the tissue.\nAdd one drop of water on the desired location on the slide, then use a pre-chilled fine tip tweezer to grab the medium part of the section, and in the cryostat, gently place the section flat on top of the water drop.\nThen quickly use a small transfer pipette to suck around and away the residual water underneath the section until it adheres flat onto the slide.",
    "Note: This technique is crucial and reliable in our hand for obtaining wrinkle-free and intact brain cryosections, which is most ideal for downstream immunolabeling and semi-automated quantification for plaque abundance.\nSlides are air-dried at room temperature overnight and then are either used immediately for immunofluorescence experiments (see protocol “immunofluorescence” below) or stored at −80°C in a slotted slidebox with desiccant.\nUnfinished frozen TFM tissue blocks can be re-sealed by applying a thin layer of TFM at the cut surface stored at −80°C in airtight containers for reuse anytime.\nNote: Avoid storing cryo tissue blocks at −20°C as temperature changes (freeze-and-thaw cycles, etc) can cause ice crystal damage to the tissue blocks.\nPause point: TFM tissue blocks can be kept in −80°C and glass slides mounted with cryosections can be saved for long-term use/reuse with proper storage conditions.\nFor common issues with cryosections and preparations for downstream immunofluorescence experiments, please refer to troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nImmunofluorescence\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis protocol describes the key standard steps of conducting immunofluorescence experiments on transgenic AD brain cryosections for analysis and quantification of Aβ plaque abundance, axonal dystrophy, synaptic colocalization, and microglial activity. This protocol is partly adapted from recent publications10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Note that steps such as antigen retrieval and autofluorescence quenching are optional and will need to be evaluated for the specific antigen/antibody and imaging setup case by case.\nDay 1\nThaw slides (stored at −80°C before use) in room temp for 10 min.\nMake sure the cryosections are completely dry on the slides and do not have extra mounting medium underneath, so they adhere well to the slides. This is especially important if performing ThioS staining.\nOptional: ThioS staining can be done first in combination followed by standard immunofluorescence protocol.",
    "Prepare solutions (the volume below is intended for glassing histology staining tubs that hold 20 slides back-to-back, increase or decrease volume accordingly based on the size of the choice of staining container.\n70% Ethanol 400 mL.\n80% Ethanol 600 mL.\nFreshly make 0.1% ThioS in 200 mL 80% ethanol solution.\nNote: ThioS solution must be made fresh and be filtered through 0.22 μm filter right before each use.\nWash slides with 70% Ethanol for 1 min.\nWash slides with 80% Ethanol for 1 min.\nIncubate slides in filtered thioflavin S solution for 15 min in dark.\nNote: protect thioflavin S from light and protect stained slides from light.\nWash slides with 80% Ethanol for 1 min in dark.\nWash slides with 70% Ethanol for 1 min in dark.\nWash with distilled water twice before mounting directly or continue to immunofluorescence.\nNote: ThioS can be used for visualizing β-pleated sheets in pathology AD brain sections, including the dense core in neuritic amyloid plaques as well as Tau pathology and therefore can be useful to be simultaneously with antibodies that recognize various forms of amyloid-β (e.g., 6E10, 3D6, 4G8) or phosphorylated Tau such as AT8. To achieve high consistency in batch analysis, ThioS staining (and IF experiments in general) should be done in cohort batches when possible to ensure comparable background and staining intensity whenever possible and as little experimental variability as possible. Highly variable immunosignals can be normalized to background or to the expression level in wild type/control samples for relative fold change quantification.\nWash slides with 1×PBS for 5 min.\nOptional: In the meantime, prepare citrate-based antigen retrieval (AR) buffer and fill 50 mL of AR per coplin glass jar that holds 10 slides back-to-back; if more slides, increase antigen retrieval solution correspondingly.\nAR recipe:",
    "A solution: 1.83 g citric acid (C6H8O7) in 100 mL H2O.\nB solution: 15.66 g trisodium citrate (C6H5O7Na3.2H2O) in 500 mL H2O.\nWorking citrate buffer solution =1,000 mL = 18 mL solution A + 82 mL solution B +900 mL H2O.\nPreheat to ∼60°C–70°C: Microwave for 30 s on power 1 (10% of total power) and again for 15 s on power 10.\nTransfer the slides from the PBS buffer and immerse into the pre-warmed AR buffer.\nMicrowave the AR jar for 2 min on power 10 and the solution reaches a temperature of 80°C–90°C.\nOnce the slides are cool, rinse and wash the slides once with PBST for 5 min.\nRecipe for PBS-T (Wash buffer): 1 mL of Tween-20 in 1,000 mL PBS.\nNote: due to the high viscosity of Tween-20, use a 1cc syringe or go by weight for an accurate addition of Tween-20.\nIn the meantime, prepare a humidified chamber (“immunobox”) by wetting tissue paper with sufficient H2O to prevent evaporation during incubation.\nThen quickly use kimwipe to suck off the residue liquid on the edges.\nUse a hydro-barrier PAP pen to draw edges on the glass slides. Wait one minute before adding blocking buffer (BB).\nBB recipe: 2% BSA, 5% natural donkey serum, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.3% Triton X-100.\nBB can be frozen into small aliquots and store in −20°C for up to 6 months. If stored in fridge, use within 1 week.\nAdd ∼100 μL BB to each sagittal brain section. Incubate slides in immunobox at room temperature for 1 h.\nMake primary antibody mixture in BB. Again, estimate ∼100 μL antibody solution for each brain section. Make sure antibody solution should sufficiently cover the sections to avoid drying overnight. Mix well before adding on brain sections.",
    "Follow respective manufacturer’s instruction to prepare and store the stock antibodies. Example primary antibodies for characterizing various aspects of AD-related pathological changes are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] as a guideline.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2196_11.csv\nIncubate in primary antibody mixture in the humidified chamber O/N in the dark at 4°C.\nNote: Spin down the antibodies at max speed on a tabletop centrifuge for 30 s to remove any precipitated antibodies. Make sure the slides are placed level in the chamber and are not obstructed by anything atop.\nOptional: Additional 100 mM L-lysine in BB to assist with synaptic labeling.\nDay 2\nRinse and wash with wash buffer for 3 × 10 min.\nIn the meantime, make secondary antibody mixture (depending on the optic setup on the confocal microscope, I usually use a combination of Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 sometimes Alexa Fluor 647 on far red channel, with a 1:500 dilution in BB).\nNote: Spin down the antibodies at max speed on a tabletop centrifuge and only withdraw from the top to avoid fluorescent antibody precipitates.\nOptional: for aged or AD CNS tissues with lipofuscin, a step of autofluorescence quenching is necessary. Autofluorescence has broad spectrum and therefore can be observed and obscure immunofluorescent signals during imaging in all channels. To quench autofluorescence, add sufficient TrueBlack (20×) or Sudan Black D (0.1%) dissolved in 70% EtOH to cover sections, and incubate for 1 min before rinsing in PBS for 5 min before secondary antibody incubation.\nNote: after autofluorescence quenching step, no detergent should be used in the following steps (i.e., substitute wash buffer with PBS, and non-detergent-containing blocking buffer).\nThen incubate section in secondaries at RT in dark.\nMake Hoechst33258 solution for nuclei staining:\nStock Hoechst solution: 1% Bis Benzamide solution.\nFor working dilution, use 1:1000 in PBS.",
    "Alternatively, use DAPI-containing mounting media at the end.\nSuck off the secondaries with a vacuum suction system and incubate in Hoechst solution for 5 min at RT in the dark.\nRinse and wash 3 × 10 min with wash buffer.\nRinse and wash with PBS once. Then wash once with dH2O.\nUse mounting medium Fluoromount-G approx. ∼20 μL/1 drop per section or ∼50 μL for covering the whole slide. Gently lay down the coverslip of the fitted length (#1 ½ that is optimized in optical index for subsequent confocal imaging).\nNote: release the cover slip very slowly with fine point tweezers from one side to the other and carefully to avoid bubbles. If small bubbles inevitably formed, use a pipet tip to gently tap near the bubble on the cover glass to drive out any bubbles.\nOptional: a good practice for efficient mounting and bubble formation is to do reverse mounting by applying mounting medium to coverslip instead of onto the sections (∼60 μL per 50 mm long coverslip).\nAlternatives: instead of doing a separate Hoechst staining, mount coverslips into Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Cat. No: H-1200) or ProLong Gold antifade mountant with DAPI onto glass slides.\nThe mounting media will solidify at RT at a dry and dark place overnight before imaging. Store slides at 4°C.\nFor common issues with immunofluorescence experiments, please see troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nIsolation of soluble Aβ from transgenic AD mouse cortex and hippocampus and its measurement by sandwich ELISA.",
