    "1. Cell Extension Characteristics\nMaintain SW-13, SW-Neo, and SW-DKK3 cells in a standard humidified incubator at 37.0 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10,000 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (designated as 'growth medium').\n\t\nCount cells using a hemocytometer, and plate 5,000 cells per well for SW-13, SW-Neo, and SW-DKK3 lines into separate 6-well plates and grow overnight in growth medium on sterile glass coverslips.\nAfter overnight growth, for each well, aspirate the growth medium, wash cells with 1 mL of warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fix the cells with 1 mL of 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min.\nAspirate formaldehyde and stain cells in each well with 1 mL of 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min. Wash excess dye away using three washes of 1 mL deionized water.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the level of dye uptake, several additional washes may be needed to remove background staining to promote cell visualization.\n\t\nUsing fine tipped forceps, retrieve coverslips and place them face down on a labeled glass slide with a drop of clear mounting reagent.\nUnder a light microscope, randomly choose 20 views of non-overlapping cells from each coverslip for the cell extension assay.\n\t\nTake photomicrographs at 400x magnification of each field of view. Directly count the number of each type of extension for each of the 20 representative cells.",
    "NOTE: As such, 20 isolated cells should be examined for each tested condition to ensure reliable results. Filopodia were defined by cellular extensions with a base of 5 microns or less and a single apex. Lobopodia were defined by cellular extensions with a base of 5 to 20 microns of length containing extensions with multiple apices. Lamellipodia were defined by cell extensions that are greater than 20 microns in length and with or without apices. Depending on the tested cell type, the sizes of cell extensions may differ and may require refinement of identifying parameters.\nDetermine the average number of each cell extension in each cell type (i.e., SW-13, SW-Neo, SW-DDK) across the 6 wells examined.\nUsing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test, compare differences in the average percentage of cell-membrane extensions among the different test cell types.\n2. Adhesion Assay\nMaintain SW-13, SW-Neo, and SW-DKK3 cells in a standard humidified incubator at 37.0 °C and 5% CO2 in growth medium.\n\t\nUsing a hemocytometer, count and plate 100,000 cells of SW-13, SW-Neo, and SW-DKK3 per well into separate 6-well plates and grow overnight in growth medium.\nSeed 6-well plates for each cell type tested, using one plate for each of the 6 designated time points tested below.\n\t\tNOTE: The time points may vary for different cell types.\nAfter overnight incubation, wash cells with warm PBS once then add 0.5 mL of 1x non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution to each well.\n\t\nSwirl the plate to spread the cell dissociation solution. Aspirate the designated plate at defined time points (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min) and then wash with 1 mL warm PBS solution three times.\nBetween washes, gently tap the plates to detach loosely attached cells.",
    "Aspirate any remaining PBS and fix the cells remaining attached to the plate with 1 mL of 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min.\nStain cells with 1 mL of 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min then wash excess dye away with 1 mL of deionized water. Titrate wash to promote cell visualization.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the level of dye uptake, several additional washes may be needed to promote cell visualization.\nUsing a light microscope at 100x magnification, count the remaining attached cells in each well for each plate.\n\tNOTE: Use of transparent rulers or marking fine pen guides on the bottom side of the plate will help to avoid repeated counting of the same cells.\nDetermine the average number of attached cells per well for each plate.\nCompare the rate of cell detachment between SW-13, SW-Neo, and SW-DDK3 cells over the given time period using a two-way ANOVA statistical test.\nSubscription Required.
