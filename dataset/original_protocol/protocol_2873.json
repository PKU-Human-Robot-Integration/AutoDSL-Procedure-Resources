For the large animal model (e.g., pig) we did not perfuse the animal. For small animals, you can perform transcardiac perfusion with 25 mL 1× PBS/50 μg/mL heparin, followed by 25 mL 1× PBS/1% PFA/10% sucrose/50 μg/mL heparin.\nDissect the inner ear (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2582-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissecting and trimming the porcine inner ear\n(A) Expose the inner ear by cutting a rectangular window on top of the skull using a bone stryker, remove the brain and brain stem, and locate the inner ears on the lateral sides of the skull.\n(B and C) (B) Locate the superior margin of the petrous part, white arrow in the figure, and cut in parallel to detach the inner ear from the skull as shown in (C).\n(D) The tympanic membrane is located in the middle ear side, flip the sample to reveal it.\n(E) Trim the spongious mastoid bone using bone-cutting forceps and expose the apex of the cochlea.\n(F) Remove the stapes.\n(G) Remove the round window membrane.\n(H) The dissected and trimmed inner ear top view (up) and side view (down). Related to steps 1 and 2.\nSeparate the head from the body.\nRemove the skin from the mid skull all the way to the back of the neck using a razor blade or scalpel.\nCut a rectangular window through the bone on top of the skull using a bone stryker.\nRemove the brain and brain stem.\nLocate the inner ears on the lateral sides of the skull.\nCut right above the inner ear, where the superior margin of the petrous part is located.",
    "Note: The petrous part is the border and the most medial part of the temporal bone, with a pyramid shape, and is wedged in the base of the skull.\nCut the base of the skull in half using the bone stryker. Detach the rest of the inner ear periphery from the skull.\nPush the base of the skull back and separate the lateral parts including the inner ears from the rest of the skull.\nTrim the inner ear (see Methods video S1-parts 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTrim the excess bone around the inner ear using a bone stryker, the goal is to remove temporal bone while keeping the cochlea intact. Locate the tympanic membrane or middle ear and carefully trim the specimen without damaging the inner ear using bone-cutting forceps.\nTrim the excess bones and make cuts in the spongious mastoid bone using bone-cutting forceps until the apex of the cochlea is found. Remove the loose bone pieces, tissues, and ligaments using a scissor. When you get closer to the inner ear, use the bone nipper to trim. Any temporal bone that was not trimmed could be cleaned later after decalcification.\nRemove the stapes and the round window membrane using a sharp (style 5) tweezer.\nTransfer the inner ear into the fixative solution I in a 50 mL tube for 1–2 h at 25°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

    "Methods video S1. Part 3. Trimming the porcine inner ear to prepare it for tissue clearing, related to step 2\n    \nTissue clearing\nTiming: 27–33 days (for step 3)\nIn this step, label the tissue using immunofluorescence, and render the entire inner ear transparent.\nWe optimized BoneClear2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] tissue-clearing protocol to render the porcine inner ear transparent. However, we believe that this method can also be used with other animal models such as adult mice, guinea pigs, gerbils, rabbits, and non-human primates. To demonstrate the applicability of the method across species, other than pigs, we have cleared a cochlea from an adult African green monkey (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2582-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Expected results\nImages before (left) and after (right) the tissue-clearing protocol. The pig and non-human primate (NHP; African green monkey) inner ears are shown, related to step 3.\nNote: The mice and gerbils have been cleared before with other tissue-clearing protocols.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] This protocol is optimized for clearing thicker and denser bones and therefore can be utilized for adult and larger animals and potentially humans.\nFurther fix the inner ear in the fixative solution II 12–20 h at 4°C.\nWash the sample 3 times in 1× PBS in a 50 mL tube for 1 h each.\nDecalcify the bone via the decalcification buffer inside a 50 mL tube for 2–10 days based on the age of the animal at 37°C on a shaker with a fresh buffer exchange every 24 h.\nIf there is any remaining bone, separate the inner ear from the temporal bone using a bone cutter.\nDehydrate the sample using methanol gradients at 25 oC on a shaker. Please change the solution under the chemical hood using the same 50 mL tube:\nIncubate in 20% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 40% methanol for 2 h.",
    "Incubate in 60% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 80% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 100% methanol for 2 h, repeat this step, (v), twice.\nDecolorize the sample using the decolorization buffer at 4°C 12–20 h on a shaker.\nRehydrate the sample using methanol gradients at RT on a shaker:\nIncubate in 100% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 80% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 60% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 40% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 20% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in PBS for 2 h.\nImmunolabel the samples.\nPlace the sample in an a 50 ml tube, fill it with the permeabilization solution, and place it on a shaker with gentle shaking for 12–20 h (37°C).\nUsing the same tube, discard the permeabilization solution, and replace it with the blocking buffer. Place the sample on a shaker for 12–20 h (37°C).\nPlace the sample in an appropriate size tube and immunolabel the sample with primary antibodies that are added to the antibody buffer (Vantibody:Vbuffer = 1:200). The sample is placed at 37°C on a shaker for 5–7 days. For smaller samples and younger animals, use 5 days.\nNote: Pick the tube size based on the sample size and minimize the solution volume to save immunolabeling reagents. For adult pigs and NHPs, a 5 ml tube should be sufficient. The antibody solution should cover the whole sample. For example, for an adult porcine inner ear, a 1.5–2 mL solution is sufficient to cover the sample. Cover the cap with parafilm to avoid leakage or evaporation. We used the same timing for all antibodies tested in this experiment (Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section), however, the optimization of the incubation time with the primary antibody might be required.",
    "Wash the sample with the washing buffer at 37°C on a shaker for 24 h with a fresh buffer change every 6 h. If exchanging the washing buffer every 6 h is not feasible, repeat four times with a minimum of 6 h each.\nImmunolabel the sample with secondary antibodies in the antibody buffer (Vantibody:Vbuffer = 1:250) at 37°C on the shaker for 4–5 days.\nNote: We have identified that Cy3 and AF647 work well with this technique. Pick your primary and secondary antibodies accordingly. Please note, there will be an extensive auto-fluorescence signal in the 488 nm channel. Cover the cap with parafilm to avoid the leakage.\nCover the tubes with aluminum foil from this step onward.\nWash the sample with the washing buffer at 37°C on a shaker for 48 h with fresh buffer change every 6 h. If exchanging the washing buffer every 6 h is not feasible, repeat eight times with a minimum of 6 h each.\nDehydrate the sample using methanol gradients using a 50 mL tube at 25 oC on a shaker:\nIncubate in 20% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 40% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 60% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 80% methanol for 2 h.\nIncubate in 100% methanol for 2 h two times (2×).\nDelipidate at 25 oC on a shaker.\nIncubate in the delipidating solution I for 2 h 2×.\nIncubate in the delipidating solution II for 0.5 h four times (4×).\nRI-match the sample at 25 oC on a shaker.\nIncubate in RI matching solution in a 50 mL tube at 25oC for 24 h three times (3×).",
    "Note: Make sure the DBE, RI matching solution, is filled all the way and minimize the air gap on top. DBE oxidizes in the air to form peroxides with different properties which affect the clarity of the tissue. Handle the sample very gently as any slight squeezing can introduce bubbles inside the sample.",
    "Optional: To speed up the immunolabeling process (up to three times) a perfusion pump can be used. First, a perfusion chamber that circulates the antibody solution in an Eppendorf tube is built. Two holes are drilled on top of a 5 ml Eppendorf tube that will be used during the staining process. The hole diameter should be matching the microfluidics tube diameter so there is a slight resistance to moving the microfluidics tubes through the holes. Then, insert the inlet and outlet microfluidic tubes through the holes until they are well below the fluid level in the 5 ml tube. Add the antibody buffer that includes the antibodies to the 5 ml Eppendorf tube, and run the pump to fill the microfluidic tubes with the antibody buffer. Make sure there is no bubble formed inside the tubes. Place the sample within, making sure that the solution covers the sample. Position the inner ear so the round window can be accessed. Connect an intrathecal catheter (cut it short if needed) to the tubing inlet, adjust its length inside the tube, and run the pump to fill the catheter with the antibody buffer. Gently insert the catheter into the round window. Then slowly close the tube cap. Please note, do not push the catheter too deep into the round window as it may damage the cochlear fine structure in the base. The perfused solution will exit from the oval window (make sure the stapes and the oval window membrane were removed) into the 5 ml reservoir at 37°C inside the incubator. Make sure that the outlet tube is inside the solution as well, and shaking is not required. Cover the cap including holes and tubes with parafilm and flow the solution using the perfusion pump (flow rate of 1.9 μL/min).",
    "Using this chamber, we were able to decrease the length of the immunolabeling time from 7 to 2 days.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Please note that if perfused too fast, the flow could damage the delicate organs inside the inner ear.",
    "Pause point: If needed, recommended short and long pause points will be after the completion of b-i or e-vi steps. The sample can be stored in PBS (RT) for a short term (one-two week) or in PBS/0.1% sodium azide for long-term storage at 4°C. Store the samples in a dark space. We tested additional short pause points (one week), after f-iv and f-vii steps and we did not observe any noticeable effects.\nImaging\nTiming: ∼10 h (for step 4)\nTiming: ∼3 days (for step 5)\nIn this step, the whole tissue will be imaged.\nLight-sheet microscopy. Although our setup is home-built,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] general guidelines for other setups still apply.\nMount the sample inside the imaging chamber.\nNote: Use a needle that is positioned away from the region of interest and consider the trajectory of the illumination beam. The needle should not block the illumination beam. The sample should be mounted in an orientation that the illumination beam will travel a minimal distance in the decalcified bone, which still scatters and absorbs light. Mount the sample in the orientation that lays the desired region of interest in the XY plane. Please consider that the objective lens axial resolution is always lower than the spatial resolution, i.e., XY resolution is higher than Z. If using a needle (30 ga) to mount the sample, make sure the needle is sharp. Insert the needle when the sample is mounted in DBE to prevent bubble formation. Bubbles are detrimental to the image quality and create blurriness. Typically, top-view or side-view mounting positions are used. For example, for the cochlea, in the top view, the top of the apex is facing the detection axis (almost parallel) while in the side-view, the lateral side of the cochlea is facing the detection axis (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Alternatives: Other techniques to mount the sample are possible, such as embedding the sample in 0.8% agarose block. The agarose embedding should be done after the step g and before the step h of tissue clearing. If you choose to do so, make sure that the whole tissue is embedded in agarose. The positioning in agarose needs to be adjusted based on the desired orientation. In general, for our purposes, the mounting via a needle was the most convenient mounting technique.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2582-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Typical mounting orientations being used for the cochlear imaging using the light-sheet microscopy\nIn this schematic, the immersion chamber is viewed from above. The “side-view” and “top-view” mounting orientations are shown, related to step 4.\nFill the chamber with DBE imaging solution; the imaging solution should completely cover the detection objective lens and sample.\nNote: A silicone membrane should be used to prevent the potential damage to the detection objective when immersed in 100% DBE, imaging solution.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Create a small hole in the membrane (for example via a biospy punch) and stretch the membrane over the objective tightly where the hole is in front of the lens. Also, make sure to remove the imaging solution from the chamber as soon as the imaging is completed.\nLeave the sample in the immersion chamber for 30 min before imaging.\nObserve if the sample orientation is optimal in the microscope field of view and make adjustment if needed. This step can be tedious. Please see note for (4a) for more details.\nIf using an adaptive light sheet microscope, start the calibration process.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: A porcine cochlea typically occupies a volume of 6 × 6 × 6 mm3, and in our light-sheet microscope, this corresponds to 5 × 5 tiles.\nStart imaging.",
    "Note: We imaged the sample with a pixel size of 0.65 × 0.65 μm2. The sampling along the axial direction (z) can be 5, 10, or even 15 μm depending on the biological application. We used 560, and 640 nm lasers to excite the different fluorescence channels in our samples and 488 nm for autofluorescence, which provides structural information.\nOptional: For custom-built light-sheet microscopes, use Galvo X and Y mirrors to move the detection objective relative to the light-sheet position while imaging.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Slight variations in the index of refraction of the tissue versus the imaging media change the focal distance of the detection objective and prevent it from overlapping with the illumination beam, which leads to blurred images. The ability to move the detection objective relative to the light-sheet position while imaging (adaptive) can fix that problem and improve the image quality and contrast.\nConfocal microscopy. The inner ear can be imaged using a confocal microscope if a light-sheet microscope is not available.\nNote: The imaging time will be ten times longer in comparison with light-sheet microscopy when acquiring the images at similar imaging configurations. Therefore, it is recommended to focus on smaller volumes of interest.\nConstruct an imaging chamber using iSpacer. Stick the iSpacer on a glass slide and use the silicon glue to seal the glass slide and the iSpacer. Let it dry for 30 min.\nNote: Select the proper iSpacer thickness based on the sample height or thickness. Selecting an iSpacer that is too thick limits your imaging depth, as the cochlea tends to sink to the bottom of the chamber, and the objective lens working distance is limited. Hence, select an iSpacer that is just slightly thicker than the sample.\nMount the sample inside the iSpacer and fill the iSpacer with DBE.",
    "Note: The area of interest within the tissue should directly face the objective lens. If need be, the sample can be glued to the glass using the super glue to adjust the top/side-view, before adding the imaging solution. Please make sure the glue is dried out (30 s) before adding the imaging solution. The imaging solution should completely fill the iSpacer with a slight convex surface formation.\nRemove the sticker from the top of the iSpacer and place a thin cover glass gently on top.\nNote: Place the cover glass gradually from one side to minimize bubble formation.\nClean the residue of DBE, use the nail enamel to seal the cover glass/iSpacer interface, and let it dry for 5–10 min.\nMount the slide on the confocal stage and start imaging.\nNote: Change the confocal stage if needed to accommodate larger samples.\nIf the desired volume is located at the bottom of the chamber, the sample should be flipped or remounted.\nNote: Use fresh DBE and a new iSpacer to remount the tissue. The lengthy imaging will cause bleaching and bubble formation in the tissue. It is advised to minimize the imaging volume to the area of interest initially."
