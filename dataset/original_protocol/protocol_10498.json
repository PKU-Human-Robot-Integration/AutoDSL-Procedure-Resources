    "Primary ASM cells from non-asthmatic individuals were isolated from bronchial biopsies at the Glenfield Hospital (Leicester, UK) as described previously. The research was approved by the Leicestershire Ethics Committee and patients gave their written, informed consent.\n1. Electrospinning PET Scaffolds (Figure 2)\nPrepare a solution (10 ml) of drink bottle grade PET in a 1:1 dichloromethane (DCMro) – trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution. PET concentrations of 8%, 30% and 10% weight/volume (wt/vol) are required for nanofiber, microfiber and aligned scaffolds respectively and then stir the solution O/N at RT for the PET to dissolve.\nTransfer the PET solution into a syringe and attach a 23-G (for nanofiber) or an 18-G (for microfiber and aligned) needle to the syringe and place the syringe into a motorised syringe pump. Make sure the point of the needle is rotated to the bottom.\nPosition the mandrel 15 cm away from the tip of the needle, ensuring the needle is pointed at the centre of the drum.\nAttach the electricity supply to the needle tip with crocodile clips and ground the mandrel (via banana socket) to earth. Switch on the power supply to the mandrel and set speed to 60 rpm (equivalent to approximately 13.2 m·min-1) for nanofiber and microfiber scaffolds. Set speed to 2,000 rpm (equivalent to approximately 440 m·min-1) for aligned scaffolds.\nSet the syringe pump to a flow rate of 0.5 ml·hr-1 for nanofiber random and aligned scaffolds or 2.0 ml·hr-1 for microfiber scaffolds. Allow the pump to run until solution is extruded from the needle tip in order to remove any air in the needle. Then stop the pump.\nOn the syringe pump, set the total volume of solution to be expelled to 2 ml and start the pump.\nSet voltage supply to 14 kV, and switch on the power supply.",
    "Electrospin until 2 ml of solution has been electrospun (4 hr for nanofiber and aligned scaffolds, 1 hr for microfiber scaffolds).\nCut the scaffold with a blade along the width of the mandrel. This produces a 2D sheet of scaffold the size of the mandrel surface area (in this case, a rectangular sheet 22 cm x 11 cm) which can be carefully peeled off the mandrel). Store the scaffold in aluminium foil to reduce electrostatic charge).\n\tNote: Biphasic scaffolds are produced by sequential electrospinning a nanofiber scaffold directly onto a microfiber scaffold.\n2. Sterilization of Scaffolds before Use in Cell Culture\nFrom the scaffold sheet, punch out discs of biphasic or aligned scaffolds using a 0.8 mm diameter biopsy pen and stick to gasket using non-toxic aquarium glue.\nSterilize scaffolds using ultra violet irradiation for 30 min on each side of the scaffolds before soaking in a 20% vol/vol antibiotic/ antimycotic solution (2x105 units ml-1 penicillin G, 2,000 mg ml-1 streptomycin sulphate and 500 µg ml-1 amphotericin B) O/N at 4 °C.\nWash scaffolds with PBS 3 times, and then store scaffolds in TCP well plates in PBS at 4 °C until use.\n3. Cell Culture Media Constituents\nCulture CALU3 epithelial cells in DMEM-F12 media supplemented with 10% vol/vol foetal calf serum (FCS), 2 nM L-glutamine solution, 1% vol/vol antibiotic/ antimycotic solution (10,000 units ml-1 penicillin G, 100 mg ml-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 µg ml-1 amphotericin B).\nCulture MRC5 fibroblast and ASM cells in DMEM media supplemented with 10% vol/vol foetal calf serum (FCS), 2 nM L-glutamine solution, 1% vol/vol antibiotic/ antimycotic solution (10,000 units ml-1 penicillin G, 100 mg ml-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 µg ml-1 amphotericin B).\nCulture epithelial-fibroblast-ASM cell co-cultures in a 70:30 DMEM-F12:DMEM media mixture.\n4. Seeding of Fibroblast and Epithelial Cells onto Biphasic Scaffold",
    "In a tissue culture plate, soak the scaffolds in DMEM-supplemented media and incubate at 37 °C for 1 hr before cell seeding.\nRemove the DMEM-supplemented media, place the microfiber phase of scaffold apically and seed 1.5 x104 MRC5 fibroblast cells in 30 µl of DMEM-supplemented media. Agitate plate on an orbital shaker for 2 hr, before leaving in an incubator at 37 °C 5% CO2 in air O/N.\nTurn the scaffold over so the nanofiber phase of scaffold faces apically, seed 3.0 x104 CALU3 epithelial cells in 30 µl of DMEM–F12-supplemented media onto the nanofiber phase of the scaffold and incubate for 2 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air before submerging the scaffold in 70:30 DMEM-F12:DMEM-supplemented media O/N prior to transferring to the bioreactor.\n5. Seeding of ASM Cells onto the Aligned Scaffold\nIn a tissue culture plate, soak the scaffolds in DMEM-supplemented media and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C before seeding 2.5 x104 cells in 30 µl of DMEM-supplemented media and incubating for 2 hr (37 °C, 5% CO2 in air). Submerge scaffold in DMEM-supplemented media return to incubator and leave O/N before setting up a tri-culture in the bioreactor.\n6. Setting-up the Tri-culture using the Bioreactor System (Figure 7)\nPlace the biphasic scaffold gasket into the groove within one chamber with the epithelial phase facing up into the chamber.\nPlace the aligned scaffold underneath the biphasic scaffold (so it is adjacent to the microfiber phase of the biphasic scaffold) and lock the two chambers of the bioreactor together.",
    "Assemble two perfusion flow circuits connected to two medium reservoirs (DMEM-F12-supplemented media in apical reservoir, DMEM-F12/DMEM-supplemented media in basal reservoir) and pump media around the two circuits at approximately 0.1 ml/min using a peristaltic pump (40 ml media is recycled through each circuit). House all parts of the system within an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air.\nAfter one week, remove the media from the apical chamber, and culture the epithelial cells at the ALI for a further week before analysis."
