    "1. Determine the Percentage of Solids in the Collagen Batch\nExtract the collagen following a previously published procedure13. Thaw a minimum of 20 ml of collagen. Determine the initial percentage of collagen solids in the batch in order to manipulate the collagen concentration in the formed hydrogels.\n\t\nCut three pieces of aluminum foil (about 6 x 6 cm) and shape each one as a pan by using the bottom of a 25 ml beaker. Record the weight of each pan.\nAdd a small amount of collagen to each pan and record the total weight of the aluminum pan and collagen. Add 0.5 - 0.8 g of collagen on each aluminum pan.\n\t\tNote: After this step, there are three aluminum foil pans and each one should have a small amount of collagen. Make sure to record the weight of each (total 3) empty aluminum pan and the weight of the pan after the addition of collagen. \nCalculate the weight of the collagen in each pan using the following formula:\n\t\tCollagen weight = Pan and collagen weight - Pan weight\nPlace the three aluminum pans that hold the collagen in the oven at 100 °C for 24 hr.\nAfter 24 hr, record the weight of each aluminum pan and the dehydrated collagen.\nCalculate the weight of the dehydrated collagen using the following equation:\n\t\tDehydrated collagen weight = Pan and dehydrated collagen weight - Pan weight\nCalculate the percentage of solid for the three samples to determine the collagen solid concentration using the formula below:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53578/53578eq2.jpg\nCalculate the average collagen solid content of the batch using the percentage of collagen solids for each of the three samples.\n\t\tNote: The collagen that will be used is what is left of the hydrated collagen. None of the dehydrated collagen will be used.",
    "After determining the percentage of collagen solid (initial collagen concentration) of the batch, continue using the remaining hydrated collagen. Use a calibrated pH meter to adjust the pH of the collagen batch to 3.\n\t\t\nAdd small amounts (2-5 µl at a time) of 12 N Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Keep on ice at all times. Do not add the hydrochloric acid directly to the collagen — add the acid to the side of the tube. After adding the acid, use the spatula to push the acid to the collagen and quickly stir the mixture.\nOnce it reaches a pH of 3, let the collagen sit O/N at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation of the BSA Rubber\nPrepare the Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution following the procedure listed below.\n\t\nPrepare 2x Phosphate Buffered Saline solution (PBS). Add two PBS tablets to 100 ml of water to make 0.02 M PBS solution.\nCombine BSA with 2x PBS to create a 30% BSA solution using the procedure listed below.\n\t\t\nFor example, to make a 30% BSA with 30 ml of 2x PBS, use 12.9 g of BSA. Add 1/3 of the 2x PBS (e.g., 10 ml) to a flask with a stir bar. Add 1/2 of the BSA (e.g., 6.45 g BSA) to the flask and using a spatula, wet the dry solute.\nRepeat this process of adding PBS and then BSA until all the solute and solvent is in the flask. Use the spatula to wet all the solute. It will look like a mixture of some liquid and clumps. Let it sit for approximately 30 min.",
    "Then, turn the stirrer on a low cycle and make sure that there are no clumps around the stir bar. It should take 90 min to get everything in solution or it can be left stirring O/N at 4 °C. After the solute is all dissolved, place the solution in a 20 ml syringe and capped with a 0.20 µm syringe filter. Press the plunger to expel liquid through filter and collect the sterilized solution in a new tube. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 3% glutaraldehyde solution by diluting 25% glutaraldehyde solution with sterile filtered 2x PBS. For example, for 10 ml of 3% Glutaraldehyde solution, use 2 ml of 25% glutaraldehyde and 8 ml of 2x PBS. Store at 4 °C.\n3. Molds Treatment\nNote: The prototype described in this paper uses a custom made stainless steel Y mold piece. The mold contains an inflow and two outflow channels of 4 and 3 mm, respectively. First, clean molds, spray them with unsaturated lard, and sterilize them. Prepare the molds following the procedure described below.\nClean stainless steel molds using sonicator at a frequency of 35 kHz. Place the molds in the sonicator and submerge them with water and ice. Keep the molds cold at all times while the sonicator is running. Run the sonicator for 2 periods of 90 min.\n\t\nAfter each period, use a needle to make sure that there is no material in the Luer lock stainless steel or brass connector. Use soap and water to clean the entire surface of the two sides of the molds. Verify that there is no obstruction in the channels.\nPlace the molds, screws, and Luer lock connector in an autoclave bag and autoclave it.",
    "Fill the bottle that attaches to an air sprayer half way with commercially available lard (mixed fatty acid release agent). Replace the cap with a regular cap bottle. Place it in an autoclave bag and autoclave it.\n\tNote: Lard is used to facilitate the release of the material that will be reaction injected later on (BSA rubber). Do not place the sprayer bottle lid in the autoclave- it can damage the internal seal.\nWarm up the lard for 45 sec or until its clear and liquid in a microwave. Screw the air sprayer lid to the lard bottle. Connect the lid with the sprayer. Attach the sprayer to the air source at the lab bench. Open the air valve, and open the nozzle of the sprayer until it starts wetting the surface of a paper towel.\nSpray lard perpendicular to the mold surface until the surface is fully covered. After each piece has been sprayed, place them in a Petri dish and seal it. Place the molds at 4 °C for 2 hr.\nProceed to sterilize the molds by exposing the surface to UV light for 30 min. Place them back at 4 °C until they are ready to be reaction injected.\n4. Reaction Injection of the BSA Rubber\nNote: All the materials and solution should be keep cold until ready to use to prevent premature setting of the BSA rubber in the next steps.\nPrepare the dispenser for delivering the BSA rubber to the molds following these steps.\n\t\nSterilize all of the mixing components (two O rings, syringe cap, double syringe, mix tip, and 4:1 dispenser) by exposing them to UV light for 30 min in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hood.",
    "Note: A PCR hood was used because this procedure involves fixatives. These chemicals cannot be used in the cell/tissue culture hood due to the risk of exposure and toxicity to the cells. Any other hood that contains a UV light will be suitable. \nPlace the tip cap on the solution holder.\nPerform the mixing and injection at a 4:1 ratio of BSA:Glutaraldehyde. Add the 30% BSA to the double syringe chamber that will deliver the highest amount of solution (It will take approximately 4 ml to fill). Make sure to leave enough space to place the O ring in order to prevent overflowing and contamination of the adjacent chamber.\nAdd 3% glutaraldehyde solution to the other chamber (it will take about 1 ml to fill). Make sure to leave enough space to place the O ring to prevent overflowing and contamination of the adjacent chamber.\nPlace the double syringe on the dispenser. Tilt the assembly vertically so that the syringe cap is on top. Replace the cap with the mixing tip.\nScrew the two stainless steel mold pieces together.\nPlace the assembly inside of an autoclave bag.\nTo remove any air in the dispenser, hold it in the upright position and quickly squeeze the handle one time to release a small amount of the BSA mixed with the glutaraldehyde. Then quickly attach the stainless steel Y mold's Luer lock connector to the syringe tip.\nHold the stainless steel Y mold with the left hand and the BSA-Glutaraldehyde mixture dispenser on the right. Alternate covering each of left and right exhaust of the outflow channels by pressing the exhaust to the sides of the autoclave bag to make sure the inside voids are filled with solution. Then, place the molds horizontally and inject again.",
    "Detach the molds from dispenser and place in a 25 mm Petri dish.\nPlace Parafilm around the Petri dish to prevent dehydration of the rubber.\nPlace the mold in the 4 °C fridge O/N.\n5. Adjusting the Collagen Concentration\nNote: The collagen should be kept on ice at all times during the process.\nModify the collagen concentration using the percentage of collagen solids.\n\t\nMake 10 ml of 1.75% collagen by adjusting the initial collagen concentration with cold water.\nUsing a calibrated pH meter, adjust the pH to 3 using 12 N Hydrochloric Acid. Do not add the hydrochloric acid directly to the collagen- add the acid to the side of the tube. After adding the acid, use the spatula to push the acid into the collagen and quickly stir the mixture.\nWeigh 4 g of collagen in a separate conical tube.\nCentrifuge the collagen to remove air at 4 °C and 9,343 x g for 20-30 min.\nUV sterilize the cell culture hood for 30 min, and add 14 µl of laminin to the 4 ml collagen. This will result in a final laminin concentration of 10 µg/µl. Note: Laminin provides structural integrity, adhesion, and promotes various cellular responses.\nTurn the PCR UV light on for 20-30 min prior to using the hood for sterilization.\nPlace the Luer lock cap, to attach to a 20 ml syringe, in ethanol for a 2 hr. Then, allow it to dry and place it in UV light.\nGamma irradiate the collagen for 8.6 min to reach 1,200 cGy.\n\t\tNote: The time will depend on the decay of the Cesium source. Adjust the time to reach the same dosage.\n6.Casting Collagen on BSA Rubber",
    "To polymerize the collagen, use an 8:1:1 ratio (collagen:HEPES:MEM). The following procedure is based on an initial 4 g of acidified collagen (from Step 5.1.8).\n\t\nMake a 0.2 N HEPES solution in water, and adjust the pH to 9 by adding small amounts (1-5 µl) of 1-5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Using a calibrated pH meter, monitor the pH of the solution after each addition. Store at 4 °C or keep on ice.\nTurn on the UV light of the tissue culture hood for 20-30 min to sterilize the hood.\nAutoclave forceps, spatula, and scalpel for sterilization.\nMix 1.5 ml of 0.2 N HEPES (pH 9) and 1.5 ml of 10x MEM using the tissue culture hood. Make sure to keep it on ice and vortex it for 5 sec prior to use. Store at 4 °C or keep on ice.\nTo sterilize the PCR hood, turn on the UV light for 30 min.\nPlace a 12 well plate and a 20 ml syringe in -20 °C for 10 min, or until ready to continue. Note: Keep all materials cold until ready to use. The increase in temperature induces premature collagen fibrillogenesis.\nSpray all tubes and well plates that are going to be in the hood with 70% ethanol and let them dry for sterilization. Place a 20 ml syringe on ice to cool for later use.\nIn the PCR hood, open the stainless steel molds to release the BSA rubber and using a scalpel, cut the exhaust channels of the BSA rubber mold.\nUnder the PCR hood, open the sterile collagen tubes and add 1 ml of the HEPES-MEM solution (make sure that before extracting the HEPES-MEM solution, that it is well mixed and there are no solid deposits).",
    "Using the sterile spatula, thoroughly mix the collagen and buffer solution.\nClose and vortex it quickly to ensure a well-mixed hydrogel.\nTransfer to a cold 20 ml syringe.\nWith one hand, hold the BSA Rubber inside of the well and, using the other, dispense half of the collagen hydrogel solution onto the bottom of the well.\nUsing the sterile tweezers, ensure that the rubber inflow and outflow ends are touching the sides of the well.\nPour collagen solution on top of the rubber until is completely covered.\nEnsure that the BSA rubber is suspended within the collagen and that there are no bubbles, especially near the ends of the rubber.\nPlace the cover and wrap Parafilm around the circumference of the well.\nPut in the incubator for 1 hr at 37 °C. Keep the PCR UV light on.\nAfter the polymerization of the collagen, UV crosslink the hydrogel via the following procedure.\n\tNote: The crosslinking of the collagen will be done using a UV crosslinker apparatus in which the amount of energy can be controlled.\n\t\nTurn on the UV crosslinker and use the energy setting to irradiate the empty chamber with 630,000 µJ/cm2.\nRemove the gels from the incubator.\nSpray hands with ethanol, and, inside the chamber, remove the lid as quickly as possible.\nClose the chamber and UV crosslink the hydrogels by selecting the energy setting and irradiating 630,000 µJ/cm2.\nAfter the crosslinking cycle, turn off the UV light on the PCR hood\nSpray hands with ethanol and open the chamber, quickly placing the lid back onto the well plate. Move the well plate to the PCR hood.\nUsing the sterile spatula, gently loosen and remove the gel from the well. Flip the gels under the hood to crosslink the bottom of the hydrogel. Repeat step 6.2.3 and 6.2.4.",
    "7. Enzyme Digestion of the BSA Rubber\nIn order to have a hollow collagen scaffold, remove BSA Rubber in a way that does not affect the dimensions embedded in the hydrogel. The procedure is described below.\n\t\nTurn on the UV light for 20-30 min to sterilize the tissue culture hood.\nMake 0.25% trypsin solution pH 7.8. For example, for 15 ml of water, add 0.0376 g of trypsin in a 50 ml conical tube. Adjust the pH to 7.8 by adding small amounts (2-5 µl) of 1 M NaCl. Place the solution in a 20 ml syringe and capped with a 0.20 µm syringe filter. Press the plunger to expel liquid through filter and collect the sterile solution in a new tube.\nTurn on the water bath and set the temperature to 30 °C.\nAfter 30 min, turn off the UV light. Spray ethanol on all the tubes and materials that will be used in the hood.\nTransfer the collagen hydrogel under the hood and place in separate conical tube.\nAdd around 3-5 ml (just enough to cover the gels) of 0.25% trypsin solution with a pH of 7.8 to each tube.\nSeal the tubes with Parafilm and vortex lightly for approximately 1 min.\nPlace in the 30 °C water bath for 15-24 hr. While in the water bath, lightly vortex the gels frequently until the BSA rubber has been digested or removed from the hydrogel.\n\t\tNote: In order to determine if the BSA rubber has been removed, either the rubber is floating in the trypsin solution or there are broken-down pieces. There must be no visual dark areas within the hydrogel.\nTo ensure that all the BSA rubber and trypsin has been removed from the hydrogels, rinse it as described below.",
    "Turn on the PCR hood UV light for 20-30 min.\nPrepare Mosconas solution. Combine potassium chloride (KCl, 28.6 mM), (NaHCO3, 11.9 mM), glucose (9.4 mM) and (NaH2PO4, 0.08 mM) in water. Adjust pH to 7.4 with 1 M NaOH or 12 M HCl solution. Place the solution in a 20 ml syringe and use a syringe filter of 0.20 µm to sterilize the solution.\nSpray everything with ethanol prior placing them on the hood and allow the ethanol to dry.\nOpen the tube and transfer 5-10 ml of sterile Mosconas solution to a new 50 ml conical tube.\nTransfer the collagen hydrogel to the conical tube that contains the enzyme solution. Make sure that the hydrogel is completely covered with the solution. Leave the tube in the shaker in the fridge at 4 °C for 30 min.\nAspirate the Mosconas solution and repeat step 7.2.5 twice.\nStore at 4 °C.\nSubscription Required.
