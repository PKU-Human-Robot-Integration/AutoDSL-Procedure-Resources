For the following digestions, the volume is reduced to 10 mL.\n1–3 days old neonatal rats are rinsed quickly in 75% ethanol solution for surface sterilization. The ethanol was spread using a wash bottle before decapitation focusing on the pup’s chest. Pups are decapitated using sterile scissors (straight), and the chest is opened along the sternum to allow access to the chest cavity and the heart.\nHearts are extracted from the body with curved scissors and transferred immediately into the 100 mm dish containing ∼20 mL of 1× ADS buffer.\nRemove lung tissue, large vessels and atria. Rinse the heart in the 1× ADS solution to remove blood.\nTransfer the heart to the second 100 mm dish containing 1× ADS to remove any additional blood.\nUsing a scissor, cut the hearts in 4–5 pieces directly into the 100 mL Schott containing 10 mL of filtered Collagenase Buffer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1171-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Enzymatic digestion of cardiac tissue and Percoll gradient separation\n(A and B) The heart ventricles were minced in 4–6 pieces and transfer to a bottle containing 10 mL of Collagenase Buffer.",
    "(C) For optimal digestion, the enzymatic solution with the cardiac tissue was placed under agitation at 37°C, 180 rpm.\n(D) After ∼60 min, the cardiac tissue is almost complete digested.\n(E–G) Cardiomyocyte enrichment step by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation.\n(H) After 16 h in culture, check the cells under microscopy for shape, adhesion and spontaneous contractions (see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) (40× magnification).\nRepeat the procedure (steps 4–8) with the remaining pups\nAfter the last heart has been collected and cut into small pieces, cap the Schott and incubate the heart tissue with the collagenase solution under continuous agitation,180 rpm, at 37°C for 10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nEnzymatic tissue digestion\nTiming: 2 h\nCritical: The digestion temperature (37°C) is a crucial point for the complete digestion of the hearts.\nAfter 10 min, use a sterile 10 mL serological pipette to pipette up and down 10 times to homogenize the sample and improve the tissue dissociation.\nAllow the tissues to settle by gravity for 1 min, collect the supernatant (approximately 11 mL) and transfer to 50 mL conical tubes.\nAdd 10 mL 0.22 μm filtered Collagenase Buffer solution to the remaining cardiac tissue and incubate under 180 rpm agitation at 37°C for 10 min.\nNote: The shaker utilized here display an orbital motion rage of 1.9 cm (0.75 in).\nStop enzymatic degradation by removing the Schott from the 37°C shaker and by adding 1 mL of fetal bovine serum to the 50 mL conical tube containing the 11 mL of the supernatant (step 12).\nCentrifuge at 2,000×g for 5 min at 25°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and add 2 mL of the fetal bovine serum to the cell pellet and homogenize pipetting up and down using a serological pipette.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to a sterilized 100 mm glass petri dish (non-treated) to allow the fibroblasts to adhere. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for at least 1 h, the time it takes to finish all digestions.\nRepeat the digestion, centrifugation and the pre-plating process (steps 11–17) 4–5 times with the remaining tissue fragments.\nAfter finishing the last digestion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and pre-plating cycle, transfer the supernatant of all five Petri dishes into a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Pre plating is a process that consists in seeding the cells on an uncoated glass petri dish to allow fibroblasts and endothelial cells to adhere, improving the purity of the culture. In addition to increasing the purity of the cardiomyocyte isolation, this procedure enables isolated and cultivate high yields of cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells from neonatal rats.\nNote: The number of Petri dishes used in this step is variable accordantly to the number of digestion cycles performed in step 18.\nGently wash the Petri dishes with 6 mL fetal bovine serum and transfer the supernatant to one conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 2,000×g for 10 min at 25°C.\nResuspend the cells in 3 mL of 1× ADS buffer.\nNote: The Petri dishes have a high yield of viable primary fibroblasts attached and can be maintained in Culture Medium for further experiments. Cardiac fibroblasts in culture proliferate to form a confluent monolayer. Please refer to Golden et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nPercoll gradient separation\nTiming: 1 h 40 min\nIn this step, a high yield of viable cardiomyocytes will be separated from non-cardiomyocytes using two-step discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation.\nPrepare the two-layers Percoll gradient in a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. For 30–40 hearts, prepare four 15 mL centrifuge tubes.",
    "To each of the four 15 mL centrifuge tubes, the two-layers Percoll density gradient is created by carefully loading 4 mL of the low-density Percoll solution on top of the 4 mL of the high-density Percoll solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). Tilt the tube during this procedure to avoid mixing the Percoll layers.\nSlowly load up to 1 mL of cell suspension (obtained in step 22) on the top layer of the Percoll gradient prepared above. During cell loading, the tube should be tilted (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,800×g for 45 min at 25°C.\nCritical: This step requires that acceleration and deceleration be switched off completely to prevent the layers' remix. Therefore, the centrifuge accelerates and stop slowly, avoiding disturbing the Percoll gradient.\nAfter centrifugation, the NRVMs are located at the interface of the low and high-density gradients (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nUsing a sterile 5 mL pipette, start carefully discarding the layers corresponding to the high-density Percoll layer or non-cardiomyocytes.\nRepeat this step with the remaining centrifuged tubes.\nUsing a new sterile 5 mL pipette, collect the band corresponding to the NRVMs and transfer it to a further 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nRepeat this procedure with the remaining centrifuged tubes and combine them into the same 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 30 mL of 1× ADS buffer.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tube at 1,800×g for 10 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant in a waste container.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting 30 mL of 1× ADS buffer and repeat the previous wash step (step 34).\nResuspend the pellet with 5 mL of warm Plating Culture Medium by gently pipetting to ensure a homogeneous solution of single cells.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods video S1. Loading the cell suspension on the top layer of the Percoll gradient, related to step 26\nCheck that the tube should be titled during cell loading.\nCounting and plating the cells\nTiming: 40 min\nThe NRVMs yield and viability are determined by a Neubauer chamber and trypan blue staining. Trypan blue staining is used to indicate the ratio of live to dead cells as the stain turns dead cells that have compromised membranes blue, while live cells will remain colorless.\nTake 10 μL of resuspended cells (step 36) into a new 1.5 mL tube and add 10 μL of 0.4% trypan blue dye solution. Mix gently.\nLoad 10 μL of the mixture above into the well of the Neubauer counting chamber.\nUsing the microscope to focus on the grid of the Neubauer counting chamber determine the total number of viable cells, following the standard procedure for counting cells and the calculation for determining total cell number.\nAdd 3 mL of fresh Plating Culture Medium per 35 mm dish or per well in 6-wells plate.\nPlate the cells on the double coated surface. For immunostaining, we recommend 500,000 cells/ 35 mm dish or per well in a 6-wells plate containing coverslip on the bottom to achieve 70–80% of confluence.\nNote: If desired, before plating, add Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog (100 μM final concentration), to avoid the proliferation of non-myocytes.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nForty-eight hours after plating, gently change the medium with 3 mL of Maintaining culture medium. Using the microscope confirm that NRVMs are attached and exhibit spontaneous beating (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Any non-attached cells should be removed during the medium exchange procedure. At this point, any treatment, transfection or virus transduction may be performed according to the experimental design.",

Scale bar, 10 μm.\nWash three times for 5 min with 1× ice-cold PBS.\nNext, permeabilize and block any unspecific binding of the antibodies by incubating the cell with 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X100, 50 mM glycine in PBS for 30 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nWash three times for 5 min with 1× PBS.\nIncubate the cells with primary antibodies (1:200 dilution) in 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nWash three times for 5 min with 1× PBS.\nIncubate the cells with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. All subsequent steps should be carried out in the dark as fluorescent probes are light sensitive (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nWash three times for 5 min with 1× PBS.",
    "If applied, perform the cytosolic staining with phalloidin (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: Please use fluorophores with different emission spectra in multi-color immunofluorescence experiments to avoid spectral overlap.\nWash for 5 min with 1× PBS.\nIncubate with the nuclear stain DAPI (1:500) at room temperature for 5 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nWash for 5 min with 1× PBS.\nPlace the coverslip onto a drop of mounting media (Vectashield) with the cells facing the slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSeal the coverslip with nail polish by gently outlining the perimeter of the slide.\nSamples can then be examined using a fluorescence microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G–2I) or stored in the dark at −20°C."
