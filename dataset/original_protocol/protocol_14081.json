    "The experiments in this protocol were approved by the State and Institutional Animal Care Committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, Germany; Chairperson: Dr. Silvia Eisch-Wolf; reference number: 23 177-07/G 14-1-084; 02.02.2015). The experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. The study was planned and conducted between November 2015 and March 2016. After extended literature research, the pig model was chosen as a well-established model for hemorrhagic shock. Seven anesthetized male pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) with a mean weight of 28 ± 2 kg and an age of 2-3 months were included in the protocol. The animals were cared for by a local breeder that was recommended by the State and Institutional Animal Care Committee. The animals were kept in their known environment as long as possible to minimize stress. Food, but not water was denied 6 h before the experiment was scheduled, to reduce the risk of aspiration. The representative time course is displayed in Figure 1.\n1. Anesthesia, Intubation, and Mechanical Ventilation\nSedate pigs with a combined injection of ketamine (4 mg·kg-1) and azaperone (8 mg·kg-1) in the neck or the gluteal muscle with a needle for intramuscular injection (1.2 mm). Ensure that the animals remain stable until the sedation sets in.\nCAUTION: Gloves are absolutely necessary when handling animals.\nTransport the sedated animals to the laboratory.\nNOTE: The animals fall deeply asleep and do not awake during normal handling, like when they are lifted into the transport cage. In this setting, the transport time was about 20 min with a special van for animal transport.\nMonitor the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with a sensor clipped to the pig's tail or ear directly after arrival.",
    "Disinfect the skin with colorless disinfection tincture and wait for 3 min before inserting a peripheral vein catheter (1.2 mm) into an ear vein. Then, induce anesthesia by an intravenous injection of fentanyl (4 µg·kg-1) and propofol (3 mg·kg-1).\nWhen all reflexes are absent and spontaneous breathing expires, place the pigs in supine position on a stretcher and fix them with bandages.\nNOTE: Adequate levels of anesthesia have to be confirmed by an experienced researcher by the absence of an eyelid reflex and other reactions to external stimuli.\nImmediately start noninvasive ventilation with a dog ventilation mask (size 2). Use the following ventilation parameters: inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) = 1.0; respiratory rate = 14-16 min-1; peak inspiratory pressure <20 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) = 5 cm H2O.\nMaintain anesthesia via a continuous infusion of fentanyl (0.1-0.2 µg·kg-1·h-1) and propofol (8-12 mg·kg-1·h-1) and start an infusion of balanced electrolyte solution (5 mL·kg-1·h-1).\nFacilitate endotracheal intubation by the application of a muscle relaxant (atracurium 0.5 mg·kg-1).\nSecure the airway via intubation with a common endotracheal tube (ID 6-7) and an introducer. Use a common laryngoscope with a Macintosh blade (size 4). Two persons facilitate the procedure.\nPerson 1: Fix the tongue outside with a piece of tissue and open the snout with the other hand.\nPerson 2: Perform a laryngoscopy.\nPerson 2: When the epiglottis comes into view, move the laryngoscope ventrally. Lift up the epiglottis and make sure the vocal cords are visible.\nNOTE: If the epiglottis does not move dorsally, it sticks to the soft palatine and can be mobilized by the tip of the tube. Alternatively, a blade with another size (3 or 5) or type (Miller blade) can be used.\nMove the tube carefully through the vocal cords.",
    "NOTE: The narrowest point of the trachea is not on the level of the vocal cords but subglottic. If tube insertion is not possible, try to rotate the tube or use a smaller tube.\nPull the introducer out of the tube, use a 10 mL syringe to block the cuff with 10 mL of air, and control the cuff pressure with a cuff manager (30 cm H2O).\nStart mechanical ventilation after the tube is connected to a ventilator (PEEP = 5 cm H2O; tidal volume = 8 mL·kg-1; FiO2 = 0.4; inspiration-to-expiration ratio = 1:2; respiratory rate = variable to achieve an end-tidal CO2 of <6 kPa).\nNOTE: Avoid fluctuation of the CO2 to minimize any respiratory effects on the cerebral perfusion.\nMake sure that tube position is correct by regular and periodic exhalation of CO2 via capnography, and check the double-sided ventilation through auscultation.\nNOTE: If the tube is placed incorrectly, air inflation into the stomach rapidly forms a visible bulge in the abdominal wall, even before the capnography is installed. In this case, replacement of the tube and the insertion of a gastric tube are absolutely necessary.\nWith two persons, place a gastric tube into the stomach to avoid reflux and vomiting.\nPerson 1: Fix the tongue outside with a piece of tissue and open the snout with the other hand.\nPerson 2: Perform a laryngoscopy of the porcine larynx.\nPerson 2: Visualize the esophagus.\nPerson 2: Push the gastric tube inside the esophagus with a pair of Magill forceps until gastric fluid is drained.",
    "NOTE: Sometimes, visualization is not easy. In this case, move the laryngoscope dorsally to the tube and push it ventrally to open the esophagus. During the procedure, the animal body is covered with blankets to avoid hypothermia. If the animal's body temperature decreases, use a heating system to stabilize the temperature on a physiological level (see the Table of Materials). The body temperature is displayed on the screen of the PiCCO.\n2. Instrumentation\nUse bandages to pull back the hind legs to smoothen the folds in the femoral area for vessel catheterization.\nPrepare the following materials: one 5 mL syringe, one 10 mL syringe, one 50 mL syringe, one Seldinger needle, introducer sheaths (2 mm, 2.7 mm, 2.7 mm), guidewires for the sheaths, a central venous catheter with three ports (2.3 mm, 30 cm) with guidewire, and a PiCCO catheter (1.67 mm, 20 cm).\nDisinfect the inguinal area with colored disinfection, wait for 2 min, and wipe the disinfection off with a sterile tissue. Repeat this procedure 3x. After the third time, do not remove the disinfection.\nFill all catheters with saline solutions.\nApply ultrasound gel to the ultrasound probe. Cover the inguinal area with a sterile fenestrated drape and scan the right femoral vessels with ultrasound. Use the Doppler technique to distinguish between the artery and the vein18.\nBright red pulsating blood confirms the aspired needle position. Disconnect the syringe and insert the guidewire into the right femoral artery.\nVisualize the longitudinal axis of the right femoral vein and insert the Seldinger needle under permanent aspiration with the 5 mL syringe.\nAspirate dark red nonpulsating venous blood.\nVisualize the right femoral artery axially and switch to a longitudinal view of the artery by rotating the probe 90°.",
    "Puncture the right femoral artery under ultrasound visualization with the Seldinger needle under permanent aspiration with the 5 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: The ultrasound-guided Seldinger technique is associated with significantly lower blood loss, tissue trauma, and time consumption than other methods of vascular access19,20.\n\t\nIf the correct position of the needle in the different vessels cannot be established for certain, take the blood probes and analyze the blood gas content with a blood gas analyzer (see the Table of Materials). A high oxygen level is a good sign of arterial blood, and a low oxygen level is a sign of venous blood.\nInsert the guidewire for the central venous catheter into the right femoral vein after disconnecting the syringe and retracting the Seldinger needle.\nVisualize both right vessels with ultrasound to control the correct wire position.\nPush the arterial introducer sheath (2 mm) over the guidewire into the right artery and secure the position with blood aspiration.\nUse the Seldinger technique to position the central venous line into the right femoral vein. Aspirate all ports and flush them with saline solution.\nPerform the same procedure on the left inguinal side to insert the other introducer sheaths in the Seldinger technique into the left femoral artery (2.7 mm) and femoral vein (2.7 mm).\nConnect the right arterial introducer sheath and the central venous catheter with two transducer systems for the measurement of invasive hemodynamics, and position both transducers on the heart level to get appropriate values.\nSwitch the three-way-stopcocks of both transducers open to the atmosphere to calibrate the systems to 0 as is prescribed in the operation instructions.\nNOTE: It is absolutely necessary to avoid any air bubbles and bloodstains in the systems to generate plausible values.",
    "Switch all infusions for maintaining anesthesia from the peripheral vein to the central venous line.\nTake baseline values (hemodynamics, spirometry, NIRS (see section 4) and PiCCO (see section 3) after 15 min of recovery.\nInitiate hemorrhagic shock (see section 5).\n3. PiCCO Measurement\nNOTE: For the PiCCO equipment, see the Table of Materials.\nInsert the PiCCO catheter into the right arterial introducer sheath.\nNOTE: In clinical medicine, PiCCO catheters are directly placed by the Seldinger technique. However, placement via an introducer sheath is feasible as well.\nConnect the catheter with the arterial wire of the PiCCO system and the arterial transducer directly with the PiCCO port. Then, recalibrate as described in step 2.17.\nConnect the venous measuring unit of the PiCCO system with the left venous introducer sheath.\nNOTE: It is necessary to connect the venous and arterial probes at some distance from each other. Otherwise, the measurement will be disturbed, because the application of cold saline solution into the venous system will influence the arterial measurement. For more details on PiCCO, see Mayer and Suttner21.\nTurn on the PiCCO system and confirm that a new patient is measured.\nEnter the animal's size and weight and switch the category to adults.\nEnter the protocol name and ID and enter Exit.\nSet the injection volume to 10 mL.\nNOTE: The volume of the chosen injection solution can be varied. A higher volume makes the measured values more valid. Chose a small volume to avoid any hemodilution effects through repetitive application.\nEnter the central venous pressure.\nOpen the three-way stopcock to the atmosphere, click on Zero for system calibration, and click on Exit.",
    "Calibrate the continuous cardiac output measurement as described next and click on TD (Thermodilution). Prepare physiological saline solution with a temperature of 4 °C in a 10 mL syringe and click on Start.\nInject 10 mL of the cold saline solution quickly and steadily into the venous measuring unit and wait until the measurement is completed and the system requests a repetition.\nRepeat this procedure until three measurements are completed.\nLet the system calculate the mean of all parameters and click on Exit.\nAfter complete calibration, immediately start the measurement. To monitor shock induction, focus on the PiCCO-derived parameter cardiac index.\n4. Cerebral Regional Oxygenation Saturation\nNOTE: For the equipment to monitor cerebral regional oxygenation, see the Table of Materials.\nShave the forehead of the pig with a disposable razor and water and stick two self-adherent sensors (see the Table of Materials) for NIRS to the forehead of the pig.\nConnect the preamplifier to the monitor and connect the sensor cable connectors color-coded to the preamplifier.\nClose the preamp locking mechanism and attach the sensors to the sensor cables.\nNOTE: In order to record real-time data, a USB flash drive has to be connected to the NIRS monitor.\nSwitch on the monitor, click on New Patient, enter the study name, and click on Done.\nCheck the incoming signal. When the signal is stable, click on Baseline Menu and click on Set Baselines. If the baseline has already been entered, confirm the new baseline by clicking Yes and click on Event Mark.\nChose the event with the arrow buttons on the keyboard and with Next Event; select the event 3 Induction and press Select Event.\nNOTE: If further information is necessary, consult the operation manual of the NIRS system22.\n5. Hemorrhagic Shock Induction",
    "Connect left introducer sheath with a tree-way stopcock. Connect one port of the three-way stopcock with a 50 mL syringe and one with an empty infusion bottle.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the withdrawn blood may be collected in citrated bags for later autotransfusion. This is a major advantage of controlled blood withdrawal.\nMeasure and document the exact hemodynamic parameters and calculate 40% of the cardiac index and mean arterial pressure as hemodynamic targets. Set the event 93 Blood Loss in the NIRS system as described in step 4.6.\nNOTE: Hemorrhagic shock is achieved if the cardiac index and mean arterial pressure drops below 40% of the baseline value. A considerable cerebral regional oxygenation saturation (crSO2) decline of 20% is preferable to depict microcirculatory impairment. The average blood loss to achieve this lies within a range of 25-35 mL·kg-1.\nAspirate 50 mL of blood into the syringe and switch the three-way stopcock. Push the blood into the empty bottle.\nNote the removed blood volume.\nMonitor the arterial blood pressure, the cardiac index, and the crSO2 closely. Repeat the blood withdrawal until the target blood pressure and cardiac index are achieved (after 20-30 min).\nSet the event 97 Hypotension in the NIRS device as described in step 4.6.\nNOTE: Do not withdraw the blood too quickly, because this bears the risk of immediate cardio-circulatory failure. After finishing the shock induction procedure, the animals can be used for various therapeutic interventions.\n6. End of the Experiment and Euthanasia\nInject 0.5 mg of fentanyl into the central venous line and wait for 5 min.\nInject 200 mg of propofol into the central venous line and euthanize the animal with 40 mmol potassium chloride.\nSubscription Required.
