    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the target cells for redirected cytotoxicity assay\nThis part of the protocol describes the preparation of the target cells for the redirected killing assay using activated human CD8 T cells (Effector T cells). To facilitate CD8 T cell degranulation and delivery of the lysosome granule content at the immunological synapse, proteins from the cell surface of the target cells are biotinylated followed by binding of streptavidin.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] This process creates binding sites and crosslink of the biotin labeled anti-CD3 mAb on the surface of the target cells. Once targets and effectors are cultured together, the crosslinked anti-CD3 mAb will trigger TCR-dependent degranulation of the effector CD8 T cells leading to the release of the granule content at the immunological synapse. The delivery and activity of the GZB inside the target cells is detected by a quenched substrate that contains the GZB cleavage site and after processing emits a fluorescence signal. The degranulation of the effector CD8 T cells is assessed by exposure of the granule membrane protein CD107a.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] Both events in the target and effector cells are measured by flow cytometry.\nIn this protocol, we use a FAS deficient cell line L1210 (L1210-FAS-) that allows the evaluation of the granzyme B mediated apoptosis. Because this target is FAS deficient other substrate that detects GZB and caspase 8 activation can be used. The L1210-FAS- cell line is first labeled with CellTrace™ Far Red (CTFR). This allows the discrimination between the target cells CTFR+ and the effector cells (CTFR-) facilitating the analysis of GZB activity in the target cells. The degranulation event in the effector T cells, is identified by surface staining of CD8 and CD107a mAbs (See gating strategy, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "The redirected killing assay determines the cytotoxic potential of effector CD8 T cells independently of antigen recognition.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This assay can be used to determine effector CD8 T cell differentiation and cytotoxic function; and for the rapid screening of therapeutic agents designed to improve or inhibit cytotoxic function of effector CD8 T cells. In addition, the flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay can be used to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic capacity of antigen-specific T cells such as LCMV-GP33 specific CD8 T cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCellTrace™ Far Red (CTFR) labeling of L1210-FAS- target cells\nTiming: 20 min\nThis section of the protocol describes the labeling of the cell line L1210 (target) with a cell permeable dye CellTrace™ Far Red (CTFR). The labeling of the target cells allows the cell discrimination from the effector CD8 T cells and the evaluation of granzyme B delivery inside the CTFR+L1210 targets.\nPrepare CellTrace™ Far Red (CTFR) solution:\nDilute the 10 μM CellTrace™ Far Red to a final concentration of 0.1 μM with PBS (without Ca++/Mg++). Prepare a working concentration of 0.1 μM of CellTrace™ Far Red by diluting 2.5 μL of the 10 μM stock solution with 247.5 μL of PBS (without Ca++/Mg++).\nNote: For ex-vivo cytotoxicity of NK cells, labeling of K562 cell line is performed with CellTrace™ Far Red at 0.15 μM final concentration.",
    "Critical: The working concentration of CTFR should be optimized for each target cell line. Label target cells with different concentrations of CTFR as described in steps 6 and 7. The best concentration to label the cells is assessed by flow cytometry. The optimal concentration will be the one that provides the best separation (at least 1 Log difference) between the unstained cells and CTFR+ cells. For example, unstained cells will have an autofluorescence (fluorescence scale between 101 to 102) and the signal of CTFR+ cells the fluorescence intensity between 104 to 105 (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nMix the L1210-FAS- cell line (this cell line grows in suspension) up and down with a 10 mL pipette and take an aliquot to measure cell count and viability as described in section isolation of human CD8 T cells from peripheral blood[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2], step 12.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2281-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Optimized CTFR staining of L1210 cells\nExample of optimal labeling of L1210 cells (target cells) analyzed by flow cytometry. This concentration was chosen by comparison between unstained cells and the signal separation of CTFR+ cells (fluorescence intensity between 104 to 105). This facilitate the flow cytometry gating analysis of effectors and targets.\nHarvest a volume corresponding to 5–7 × 106 targets (L1210-FAS-) from the flask into 15 mL tubes and pellet the cell suspension by centrifugation at 526 g for 6 min at 20°C.\nNote: Labeling with CTFR cells and the washing steps may lead to losing between 1 to 5% of cells. To achieve less target cell loss the viability should be above 90% before experiment. In the following step 6, an example 5 × 106 cells after CTFR labeling is used.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the pellet and wash by addition of 10 mL of PBS (without Ca++/Mg++).",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 526 g for 6 min at 20°C. Repeat the washing step twice.\nAspirate and discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet by finger flick the tube.\nNote: This step is critical to eliminate the protein from the supplemented RPMI media to allow better labeling of the cells.\nAdd 250 μL of CTFR 0.1 μM working solution (step 1a) to the L1210-FAS- cells to a concentration of 20 × 106 cells/mL.\nResuspend the cells with a 1 mL tip by pipetting up and down.\nCover the tubes with aluminum foil and incubate the L1210-FAS- cells in a water bath at 37°C for 8 min. Mix the cells every 2–3 min.\nQuench the reaction adding cold filtered Fetal Bovine Serum (1:1 volume) to the cell suspension of L1210-FAS- cells, vortex and place the tube on ice for 5 min.\nWash the cells by addition of 10 mL of PBS (without Ca++/Mg++) and centrifuge the cells at 526 g for 6 min at 4°C. Repeat the washing step twice.\nFor redirect cytotoxicity assay, proceed to biotinylation of target cells step 13. See section biotinylation of target cells for redirect cytotoxicity assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3].\nNote: For ex-vivo cytotoxicity using K562 as targets, CTFR labeled K562 are adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/mL in X-VivoTM 15 media. CTFR labeled K562 cultured alone in the presence of GZB substrate is used as negative control of GZB activity. In addition, CTFR+ L1210-FAS- mixed with the PBMC can be used as negative control of GZB delivery by NK cells (no recognition). Proceed to step 25, redirected cytotoxicity assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] section.\nBiotinylation of target cells for redirect cytotoxicity assay\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "This section describes the biotinylation of surface proteins and coating with streptavidin to create binding sites and crosslink of the biotin labeled CD3 mAb (clone UCHT1) as we previously described.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] The L1210-FAS- cell line allows to measure the granule exocytosis pathway or GZB mediated apoptosis.\nPreparation of working solutions of Biotin -X-NHS and streptavidin in HEPES saline buffer:\nPrepare 100 mL of 1× the HEPES saline buffer 10× (0.1 M HEPES, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5) with diH2O.\nPrepare 50 mL 1× HEPES saline buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nBefore weighting the Biotin -X-NHS warm the vial for 5 min at room temperature.\nTo prepare 2 mM concentration, weight 1.11 mg of Biotin -X-NHS and add 1 mL of 1× HEPES saline buffer.\nWhen the Biotin -X-NHS is dissolved, dilute 1:10 the 2 mM solution with 1× HEPES saline buffer to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 mM.\nThaw Streptavidin (2 mg/mL stock) and dilute to a working concentration of 20 μg/mL in HEPES + 1% BSA saline buffer.\nNote: The 10× HEPES saline solution can be prepared and stored at 4°C up to 2 months.\nCritical: The Biotin -X-NHS 2 mM working solution should be prepared fresh for each experiment.\nResuspend the cell pellet of CTFR+ L1210-FAS- cells with 2 mL of HEPES saline buffer and count and check viability as described in described in section isolation of human CD8 T cells from peripheral blood[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2], step 12.\nPlace the CTFR+ L1210-FAS- cells (5 × 106 cells) into a 15 mL tube and wash by adding 8 mL of HEPES saline buffer to the cells and centrifugate at 526 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nRepeat this washing step once more.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of 0.2 mM Biotin -X-NHS to reach a cell concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL.\nVortex and place the tube on ice for 30 min.\nWash the cells once with HEPES saline buffer containing 1% BSA by centrifugation at 526 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cell pellet with 0.5 mL of 20 μg/mL streptavidin (SA) to a cell concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL and transfer to a new tube.\nIncubate the tube at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 30 min.\nWash the cells with HEPES saline buffer containing 1% BSA by centrifugation at 526 × g for 6 min at 20°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of X-VIVOTM 15 media.\nCount the cells and adjust to 5 × 106 cells/mL in X-VIVOTM 15 media.\nNote: The biotinylation and washing steps may lead to a cell loss of less than 2% of cells. Separate a small number of cells (1 × 105) to use as the compensation control of CTFR labeled cells.\nRedirected cytotoxicity assay\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section describes the preparation and plating of effector CD8 T cells and the biotinylated (B)-Streptavidin (SA)-CTFR+L1210-FAS- target cells (B-SA-CTFR+L1210FAS-) for redirect killing assay. Before the plating the cells both effectors and targets are labeled with a Live/Dead staining using NFL1 (OncoImmunin, Inc). NFL1+ (dead cells) will be excluded from the flow cytometry analysis.\nLive/dead staining using NFL1 (OncoImmunin, Inc) is performed following manufacturer instructions (https://www.phiphilux.com/assays/Cytotoxicity_Assays/NFL1.pdf[href=https://www.phiphilux.com/assays/Cytotoxicity_Assays/NFL1.pdf]).\nResuspend CD8 effector T cells and B-SA-CTFR+L1210FAS- target cells at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL in X-VIVOTM 15 media in a 15 mL tube.\nDilute 1 μL of NFL1 in 9 μL of X-VIVOTM 15 media (1:10 working solution).",
    "Add 3.3 μL of NFL1 working solution into 1 mL of the cell suspension to achieve 1:3000 final dilution.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nWash twice with X-VIVOTM 15 media by centrifugation at 526 × g for 6 min at 20°C.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend in X-VIVOTM 15 media and count the viable CD8 effector T cells and B-SA-CTFR+L1210FAS- target cells as described in section isolation of human CD8 T cells from peripheral blood[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2], step 12.\nPreparation of effectors (E) and target (T) cell suspensions for an E:T ratio of 27:1.\nAdjust the B-SA-CTFR+L1210FAS- Target to a cell concentration of 1.6 × 106 cells/mL (4 × 104 cells/well final).\nAdjust the effector CD8 T cells to a cell concentration of 43.2 × 106 cells/mL (1.08 × 106 cells/well final).\n25 μL of target cells and effector cells are plated in each well.\nNote: The effector to target ratio (E:T ratio) should be optimized for each type of effectors from human, murine CD8 T cells and NK cells. This protocol presents an example using human effector CD8 T cells polyclonally expanded in vitro. The E:T ratio was optimized to 27:1.\nNote: According to specific E:T ratio, the maximum number of total cells (targets and effectors) per condition should not exceed 1.5 × 106, V-bottom 96 well plate (section redirected cytotoxicity assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] step 29). For higher numbers of cells, it is recommended to perform the incubation in a 15 mL conical tubes (with the same volumes). This provides more surface and avoid unspecific cell death.\nCritical: Targets cells should be plated at 5 × 104 and no less than 2.5 × 104 cells per 96 well plate. This range is optimal to collect sufficient events for the flow cytometry analysis.",
    "Note: Ex vivo cytotoxicity assay of NK cells: Freshly isolated or thaw and rested overnight (14–16 h) PBMCs can be used for ex-vivo NK cell cytotoxicity using K562 cell line at a 60:1 and 10:1 (E:T) ratio. CTFR labeled K562 cultured alone in the presence of GZB substrate is used as negative control of GZB activity in the targets. In addition, CTFR+ L1210-FAS- mixed with the PBMC can be used as negative control of GZB delivery by NK cells.\nPlating of the effector and targets into V-bottom 96 well plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2281-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: Add the mAbs cocktail slowly and centrifuge the plate at 189 × g for 30 s at 20°C to allow mixing the mAbs and cells. Alternatively, cut the top of a 200 μL yellow tip and mix up and down very slowly to avoid disrupting the conjugates.\nIncubate in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for an additional 15 min.\nNote: For ex-vivo cytotoxicity with NK cells a cocktail of CD3, CD19, CD16 and CD56 is used to measure degranulation of the NK cell subsets.\nFlow cytometry staining, acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the staining of the cell surface of the effector CD8 T cells after the incubation time with the target cells to monitor the degranulation.

The graph is represented by box and whisker showing the median value with first and third quartiles in the box, with whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values.\nCritical: Set up the flow cytometer in advance before acquisition of the cells (For setup please see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Keep FACS tubes of the samples on ice all the time and protected from the light until acquisition. Cells should be flow immediately and no more than 1 h to avoid losing signal of the granzyme B activity in the target cells.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2281_13.csv\nNote: CD8 T cells and L1210 has similar autofluorescence. A mixed of both cells can be used as unstained control and perform the automatic compensation calculation by the instrument. For targets and effector with higher autofluorescence between them test compensation matrix individually to evaluate whether this introduce a difference compensation matrix that may impact the analysis.\nThe gating strategy and analysis as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nTotal live cells: cells were gated based on side scatter area (SSC-A) and forward scatter area (FSC-A). A wider gate on the FSC-A was used to include potential cells that are undergoing early steps of apoptosis and will show lower FSC-A as a result of membrane damage.\nThe FSC-A vs SSC-A gate is followed by exclusion of death cells (NFL1+ cells) both Targets and Effectors.\nThe LIVE gate (NFL1- cells) is followed by FSC-A vs FSC-H to exclude doublets.",
    "Note: The redirected killing assay promotes a strong conjugate formation mediated by the CD3 mAb. In assays in which antigen specific T cells are tested, the frequency of conjugates formed by CTFR+ (Targets)-CD8+ (T cells) could be informative and can be analyzed. In this case it is recommended to test different concentration of antigenic peptide to evaluate conjugate formation.\nThe redirected killing assay was used to evaluate the role of PAR-1 signaling in human CD8 T cell mediated granzyme B delivery, and virus (LCMV-Gp33)-specific CD8 T cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTarget cells: CTFR+ cells (B-SA-CTFR+L1210FAS- targets+) were identified based on CTFR+ to distinguish them from the effector cells CTFR-CD8+ T cells.\nThe delivery and activity of the GZB inside the target cells (CTFR+ gate) is evaluated by CTFR+substrate+(GrantoxiLux) cells.\nEffector T cells: The degranulation of CD8+ T cells is measured by surface expression of CD107a in CD8+ T cells."
