    "Dissection of Drosophila melanogaster larvae in HL3 solutionSelect third-instar larvae (L3) and place it in a Sylgard dish.Pin the L3 on the anterior (head/mouth apparatus) and the posterior part, and the dorsal side-up. Immerse the pinched larvae in 4-5 ml HL3 solution (Recipe 1) to the Sylgard dish.Section the dorsal side longitudinally and remove the internal organs (intestines, fat bodies and trachea).Stretch and pin the rest of the L3.Several muscles could be used. In this study experiments were performed at Ib boutons in muscles 6 and 7. (Figure 1A)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830032317_2059.jpgFigure 1. Third-instar larvae dissection. A. High magnification image of muscle fibers 7, 6, 13, 12 and V-shaped; B. Image of the ventral muscles in L3 where a nerve (black arrowhead) is sucked into the suction electrode connected to a stimulator; C and D. Adjusting the illumination times of the pre-fixed sample loaded with FM1-43 (WT larvae loaded for 30 sec). C. The DIC image shows that the illumination time of 9 min produces a successful photoconversion. Synaptic boutons can be identified as dark spots barely visible in the surface of the muscle (white arrows). D. The illumination time of 15 min is excessive, as evident from strong DAB precipitation, observed as large dark spots over the length of the NMJ (white arrows). Scale bar = 10 µm.Activity dependent labeling of Synaptic Vesicles with FM1-43 dyeNote: Perform the following steps in low light conditions to protect the fluorophore component of FM1-43 dye. Cover the FM1-43 dye with foil or work in the dark at room temperature. Replace HL3 solution with HL3 containing 10 µM FM1-43.For loading in the absence of stimulation (spontaneous recycling pool) leave the preparation for the time of loading (10, 30, 120, and 600 sec were used in our studies).",
    "For active loading, using the head stage controllers pull the nerve into a suction electrode connected to a stimulator. Suck the end of the nerve. Use the stimulation protocol for low-frequency stimulation, 5 min, 5 Hz. Quickly remove the FM1-43 dye once the stimulation is complete (Figure 1B). The technique as adopted from Verstreken et al., 2008. Upon dye loading, rapidly wash the preparations three times for 30 sec in Ca2+-free HL3 saline containing 75 µM Advasep-7.FixationPrefix the preparation (Recipe 2) for 15 min at room temperature.Wash three times for 5 min in HEPES buffer saline (Recipe 3).Leave the preparation covered in 100 mM NH4Cl for 10 min to quench autofluorescence of the fixative.Wash out the NH4Cl solution with HEPES buffer 2 times for 5 min.FM1-43 photoconversionPreincubate the preparation for 10 min in HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mg/ml DAB.Place the sample under an epifluorescent microscope. Identify the area of interest under 60x water immersion objective, at room temperature.Illuminate the sample for 8-10 min using a mercury lamp with a 480 ± 10 bandpass excision filter using the maximum light intensity. The dye will bleach with time. Observe the process of photoconversion by switching periodically to the bright field. As photoconversion takes place, dark brown DAB precipitate localizes at the illuminated area. The illumination time needs to be adjusted, as illustrated in Figures 1C and 1D.Post-fixationWash the sample in HEPES three times 5 min.Immerse the preparation in the fixative solution (Recipe 4) and fix the sample in BioWave for 2 min at 100 W. Place the temperature insert close to the preparation to monitor temperature fluctuations. Do not allow the temperature to exceed 25-26 °C.Unpin the preparation carefully from the Sylgard dish. Transfer the preparation into a sample bottle with a snap cap.",
    "Wash the sample in 90 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 twice for 5 min.EM sample processing Note: The following steps (unless specified) are performed at room temperature. Osmium tetroxide post-fixation and uranyl acetate stainingIncubate the preparation in 1% OsO4 solution for 1 h at room temperature. The unused solution can be stored refrigerated for up to 1 month. Perform all steps under a fume hood, using gloves and long sleeve lab coat. Use 500 µl of this solution to immerse the sample. (Note 4)Wash with 90 mM cacodylate buffer for 5 min.Wash with deionized water for 5 min.Incubate the preparation in 2% uranyl acetate for 30-60 min. The unused solution can be stored refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.Wash with deionized water for 5 min twice.DehydrationPrepare separate solutions containing 50, 70, 90, and 100% of acetone.Add 1 ml of 50% acetone to the sample for 10 min.Add 1 ml of 70% acetone to the sample for 10 min.Add 1 ml of 90% acetone to the sample for 10 min.Add 1 ml of 100% acetone to the sample twice for 10 min.EmbeddingMix 2 volumes of embedding resin (Note 3) with one volume of 100% acetone. Add it to the preparation under continuous rotation for 1 h or overnight.Keep the sample in embedding resin for at least 18 h (overnight).Under a stereomicroscope, place the preparation over ACLAR film, and then identify and trim the area of interest.Place the preparation over a new ACLAR film with the muscles facing down and the cuticle facing up. Position an embedding capsule filled with polymerized resin upside-down on the top of the specimen. Polymerize at 60 °C for 24-36 h.Remove the ACLAR film. This will leave sample attached to the embedding capsule.",
    "Thin sectioning and EM imagingRemove the block from the embedding capsule and mount the block into a specimen holder of an ultramicrotome.Under a stereomicroscope, mark the area of interest with a razor blade. The marked area should be a trapezoid that would fit onto the slot grid.Trim the block over the outlined area.Insert specimen holder with the block in the ultramicrotome and align the long edge of the trapezoid to the trimming knife edge. Trim 15-20 µm and shift the knife to trim the second long edge of the trapezoid. Trim another 15-20 µm. Repeat the same for the short sides of the trapezoid (Figure 2 and Videos 1-5). Align the block face exactly parallel to the edge of the diamond sectioning knife.Cut thin sections (50-60 nm).Collect individual sections (or collect sections in series) and place them on the 2 x 1 mm slot grids.Allow the sections to dry before taking images.Image the sections using conventional TEM.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830181146_2851.jpgFigure 2. Sample block fine trimming. In the fixed and flat embedded Drosophila larvae the region of interest, muscles 6 and 7 are outlined with razor blade. Upon rough block trimming with razor blade and elimination of resin the face of the block is shaped with trimming knife. A. Fine trimming. The edge of the knife is aligned to the trapezoid top. B. Vertically positioned trapezoid with the left edge of the trimming knife aligned to the top of the trapezoid. C. Fine trimmed trapezoid with parallel top and bottom, and slightly tilted sides. Note: The paralleled top and bottom are important for forming a ribbon during serial sectioning.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
