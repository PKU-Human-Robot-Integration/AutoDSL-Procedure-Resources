    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSaCas9 expression\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter transformation of pET28-SaCas9 into One Shot BL21 Star (DE3) bacteria, the expression of recombinant SaCas9 can be induced by adding isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).\nInoculate a single colony of the transformed One Shot BL21 Star (DE3) bacteria in 5 mL LB-medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL Kanamycin sulfate and incubate in a shaker at 37°C for 12–16 h.\nTransfer the pre-culture into 1 L LB-medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL Kanamycin sulfate and shake the canonical flask vigorously at 37°C.\nMeasure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) every 30 min. When the OD600 reaches a value of 0.5–0.6 (4–6 h), add IPTG (final concentration 200 μM) and incubate for 12–16 h at 18°C with vigorous shaking.\nCentrifuge the bacteria for 20 min at 2,500 × g and 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nPause point: Store the bacteria pellet at −80°C for up to two weeks.\nLysis of bacteria\nTiming: 2 h\nThe bacteria can be efficiently lysed by a combination of lysozyme and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. DNase should be added to prevent slime formation by the bacterial DNA (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1539-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Slime formation using lysis buffer without DNase\nThaw the frozen bacteria pellet on ice and re-suspend in 50 mL lysis buffer until no cell clumps are visible.\nIncubate the lysis solution on ice for about 30 min.\nFreeze the lysis solution using liquid nitrogen and thaw it at 30°C in an ultrasonic bath (8 min). Repeat this step five times in total.\nCentrifuge the lysis solution for 20 min at 4°C and 2,500 × g.\nTransfer the supernatant carefully to a fresh tube and repeat the centrifugation for another 20 min at 4°C and 2,500 × g.",
    "Collect samples of the pellet and the supernatant (30 μL) for analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nFilter the supernatant of the second centrifugation step using a syringe filter (0.45 μm) and continue directly with IMAC.\nImmobilized metal affinity chromatography\nTiming: 2 h\nThe cDNA of SaCas9 is fused in the plasmid pET28-SaCas9 with a hexa-histidine tag (His6-Tag) at the C-terminus. Therefore, recombinant SaCas9 can be purified from the lysate by IMAC. Using a stepwise increase of imidazole will elute the bound SaCas9.\nPerform an IMAC using the ÄKTApurifier system (Cytiva) or an equivalent system in combination with a 1 mL HisTrap FF Crude column (Cytiva). Use 1 mL/min flow-rate for all steps of the IMAC. Degas all buffers before use.\nWash the column with double distilled water (5 column volumes, CVs). Equilibrate the column with five CVs washing buffer containing 25 mM imidazole.\nUse a superloop for sample loading (∼40 mL) onto the column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Collect a sample of the flow-through (30 μL) for analysis by SDS-PAGE.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1539-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Chromatography system\n(A–C) Image of the Äkta system in combination with the superloop and the HisTrap FF Crude column (A) or the 5 mL loop in combination with the HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 Prep Grade column (B). Image of the centrifuge filter (C).\nWash the column with 20 CVs washing buffer and collect four fractions (5 mL).\nElute the SaCas9 with 12 CVs 60% elution buffer and 40% washing buffer (final concentration of imidazole 190 mM). Collect 1 mL fractions during elution. The percentage of the elution buffer was established based on a continuous gradient. However, to keep the volume as low as possible for direct application in SEC, we recommend a stepwise elution.",
    "Clean the column with 10 CVs elution buffer (100%) and wash with five CVs double distilled water. Apply five CVs 20% v/v ethanol for storage of the column.\nAnalyze the fractions of the IMAC using SDS-PAGE (8%) in combination with Coomassie-R250 staining (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1539-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Purification of recombinant SaCas9-His6 by IMAC\n(A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-R250 staining of the fractions of the IMAC. The elution fractions (63.5–65.5 mL) (red) were pooled and used for SEC. Recombinant SaCas9 is marked with an arrow.\n(B) Chromatogram showing the elution of recombinant SaCas9 from the HisTrap FF Crude column. The further used fractions are indicated with an arrow.\nPool the fractions containing recombinant SaCas9 (∼128 kDa).\nPause point: Store the recombinant SaCas9 at 4°C for 12–16 h and continue on the next day with the SEC.\nSize exclusion chromatography\nTiming: 1 day\nSEC can be used to remove further protein contaminations. The described buffer system is used without any dialysis or buffer exchange between IMAC and SEC.\nThe ÄKTApurifier system in combination with a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 Prep Grade column (Cytiva) can be used for SEC. Degas all buffers before use. Wash the column with four CVs double distilled water and equilibrate the column with two CVs sample buffer at flow-rate of 1 mL/min for 12–16 h.\nUse a 5 mL sample loop for loading of the pooled IMAC fractions (∼3 mL, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Keep the volume as small as possible. Wash the loop with 25 mL sample buffer.\nPurify recombinant SaCas9 with one CV sample buffer at 0.3 mL/min flow-rate for optimal resolution. Collect 1 mL fractions during the elution.",
    "Analyze the fractions of the SEC using SDS-PAGE (8%) in combination with Coomassie-R250 staining and pool the fractions containing recombinant SaCas9 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Do not include fractions containing significant protein contaminations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1539-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The further used fractions (64–68 mL) are indicated with an arrow.\nClean the column with one CV sample buffer and wash it with four CVs double distilled water. Apply four CVs 20% v/v ethanol for storage of the column at 1 mL/min flow-rate.\nProtein concentration and buffer exchange\nTiming: 2 h\nThe purified recombinant SaCas9 can be concentrated using centrifuge filters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and stored at −20°C.\nOptional: Concentrate the eluted recombinant SaCas9 using Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifuge filter units (30 kDa molecular cutoff).\nDetermine the protein concentration(s) using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or an alternative protein assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011636_Pierce_660nm_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011636_Pierce_660nm_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf]) in combination with the M1000 Infinite plate reader (Tecan).\nAdd 50% v/v glycerin and mix gently.\nCritical: Since the high viscosity, calculate and weight the exact amount of glycerin instead of pipetting (ρ=1.26 g/mL). Addition of glycerin is highly recommended to prevent protein precipitation during freezing.\nRun a SDS-PAGE (8%) in combination with Coomassie-R250 staining with defined amounts of recombinant SaCas9 (50–2,500 ng) and determine the purity using e.g., ImageJ (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1539-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of recombinant SaCas9-His6\n(A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-R250 staining of purified SaCas9 at specific quantities. Of note, the purity of the recombinant SaCas9 should be at least 90%.

    "(B) Western blot analysis of recombinant SaCas9 (arrow) using primary monoclonal mouse anti SaCas9 antibodies.\nPause point: Store the purified recombinant SaCas9 at −20°C in appropriate aliquots until use.\nWestern blot analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nThe expression of the purified recombinant SaCas9 should be verified before performing any down-stream applications. The provided protocol can be used to detect SaCas9 by Western blot analysis. Instead, mass spectrometry can be used.\nRun a SDS-PAGE (8%) of recombinant SaCas9 (50–500 ng per lane).\nTransfer the proteins on a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Pack (Biorad) membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo System (Biorad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000071567.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000071567.pdf]).\nIncubate the membrane in 5% w/v skimmed milk powder in TBST for 1 h at 20°C.\nIncubate the membrane for 12–16 h at 4°C with monoclonal mouse anti SaCas9 antibodies (0.5 μg/mL, in TBST supplemented with 5% w/v skimmed milk powder).\nWash the membrane at least five times with TBST.\nIncubate the membrane for 1 h at 20°C with polyclonal goat anti mouse immunoglobulin antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 1:5,000 in TBST supplemented with 5% w/v skimmed milk powder).\nWash the membrane at least five times with TBST.\nIncubate the membrane in WesternBright Quantum HRP substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://products.advansta.com/WesternBright-Quantum-user-manual[href=https://products.advansta.com/WesternBright-Quantum-user-manual]) and detect the chemiluminescence signal with an appropriate detection system (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nSaCas9 activity assay\nTiming: 1 day\nThe functional activity of the purified SaCas9 should be verified by an in vitro cleavage assay before using it in down-stream applications. Here, we provide an activity assay targeting exon-3 of the human LMNA gene (NM_005572.3). However, also specific other cleavage assays can be used to demonstrate the activity of the purified recombinant SaCas9.",
