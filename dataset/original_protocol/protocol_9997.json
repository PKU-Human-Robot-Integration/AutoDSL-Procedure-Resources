    "1. Preparation of hydrogels and cross-linking solutions\nBriefly, by vigorously mixing, dissolve ALG and CMC powders in ultra-pure water to obtain a total 3 wt% ALG and 3 wt% CMC solution.\n\tNOTE: In this work, 5 mL syringes are used for printing; thus, the final amount of material is adjusted to that volume. However, for other extrusion cartridges and printed sample sizes, the amount of prepared material should be scaled accordingly.\nAdd 1.5 wt% cellulose nanofibers to the ALG-CMC mixture for additional mechanical reinforcement to reach the desired viscosity, suitable for printing.\nAgitate the hydrogel suspension until homogeneous using an overhead mixer.\n\tNOTE: No fibers or bubbles should be present in the hydrogel.\nPrepare 10 mL of 100 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution in ultra-pure water, which is used as the primary cross-linking solution for printing.\nPrepare 10 mL of 5 wt.% CaCl2 solution in ultra-pure water, which is used as a secondary cross-linking solution in post processing of scaffolds.\n\tNOTE: Generally, all hydrogel formulations, which are suitable for immediate chemical cross-linking, allow for one-step fabrication of hollow tubes and can be used with this type of core/shell set-up. The printing and cross-linking mechanisms need to be optimized accordingly. Viscosity of the hydrogel will vary depending on the desired composition; however, it can be adjusted with polymer concentrations and the addition of thickening agents (e.g., nanofibers). The ideal viscosity for 3D printing of stable structures is high enough for the extruded filament to retain its shape and for the scaffold to hold its own weight before cross-linking.\n2. Core/shell printing of perfusable scaffolds\nPrior to printing, sterilize the bioprinter by spraying 70% ethanol thoroughly and expose it to UV light for 1 h.",
    "Turn on the bioprinter and run the controlling software, which comes in a bundle with the 3D printer.\nPerform the homing procedure by pressing the Home icon.\nUsing the toolbar command File | Import G-Code, import the generated scaffold g-code.\nTransfer the hydrogel to a sterile 5 mL syringe and place it in one of the extruder mounts of the 3D printer. Via the luer-lock and a short tube, connect it to side luer input of the core/shell nozzle.\nTransfer the cross-linking solution (100 mM CaCl2) to another sterile 5 mL syringe with an attached G27 blunt-end needle and insert it into the top needle holder of the core/shell nozzle. The inner needle should slightly protrude (~1 mm) from the outer core/shell nozzle. Adjust the alignment manually. Insert the second syringe in the extrusion mount.\nTo correctly insert the syringes into the mounts (set-up shown in Figure 2), manually control both extrusion mounts by clicking the A and B and Up and Down arrows.\nBefore the printing starts, separately extrude the hydrogel and the cross-linking solution to clear all excess air bubbles in the core/shell nozzle and ensure a continuous hydrogel flow.\nUsing the Z and Up and Down arrows, manually adjust the distance between the nozzle and printing substrate. It is recommended to use a flat, glass-printing substrate, which has good adhesion. The extrusion nozzle should not be in contact with the substrate to allow for uninterrupted flow of the hydrogel. The optimal distance between the nozzle and substrate (layer height) is typically the same as the width of the outer nozzle diameter, but it is adjusted to the material used and individual printing parameters. Adjust the starting printing height according to individual needs.\nPress the Play button to start the printing process.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to include the printing of a skirt (Figure 3) surrounding the scaffold to ensure the laying of a homogenous hollow filament before printing of the actual scaffold starts. To achieve optimal hydrogel flow with the intention to print optimal scaffolds, vary formulation composition, cross-linking solution composition, and printing parameters (i.e., printing speed, extrusion pressure, printing temperature, distance between the substrate and extrusion nozzle, etc.).\nAfter printing, carefully remove the substrate with the printed scaffold and pour the secondary cross-linking solution (5 wt.% CaCl2) over the entire scaffold to ensure the cross-linkage over the entire scaffold. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the entire scaffold is submerged in the cross-linking solution. This step is crucial for achieving desired strength properties of the scaffold but will vary depending on the material and cross-linking method used.\nUsing a scalpel manually cut the excess skirt material.\nSterilize the scaffolds under an UV light for 30 min. Carefully flip the scaffold and repeat the sterilization process.\nCarefully detach the scaffold from the substrate by gently pulling it sideways. If the scaffold adheres strongly to the substrate, separate it by inserting a sharp edge between them.\nTransfer the scaffold into a colorless cell culture media (DMEM supplemented with 5 wt.% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1 mg/mL streptomycin), and incubate them at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5 wt.% CO2 for at least 24 h.\n3. Preparation of endothelial cells and live/dead assay solution\nFor cell culturing, prepare the advanced DMEM cell culture medium with added phenol red and supplement it with 5 wt.% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Add 100 U/mL penicillin and 1 mg/mL streptomycin.",
    "Initiate the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line and passage them in accordance with HUVEC culturing protocols as described47.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to culture the cells in cell culture media with added phenol red for simple visualization during injection of the cells into white translucent scaffolds as described below.\nFor cell counting, pipette 100 μL of cells suspended in cell culture media and stain them with 900 μL of 0.1 wt.% trypan blue solution.\nUse an automated cell counter or manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the estimated number of cells in suspension.\nFor the live/dead assay, prepare a solution of 4 mM Calcein-AM and 2 mM propidium iodide in sterile PBS.\n\tNOTE: The live/dead solution should be prepared directly before conducting the assay.\n4. Transferring cells into scaffolds\nRemove the scaffolds from cell culture media and transfer them into a sufficiently large glass Petri dish.\nImmediately before injecting the cells into the scaffolds, dissociate the HUVECs from the flasks using treatment by 0.25 wt.% trypsin.\n\t\nBriefly, dispose cell culture media and incubate the cells with 0.25 wt.% trypsin (~2 mL) for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAfter incubation add ~3 mL of cell culture media to the trypsinized cells and transfer all detached cells to a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min and dispose of the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in fresh cell culture media.\nCount the cells as described previously. Adjust the total cell concentration according to individual needs. In this work, a starting concentration of 340,000 cells/mL is used.\nResuspend the cells in a sterile syringe with an attached blunt G27 needle.",
    "Find an entry point and start carefully injecting cells into the scaffolds. The cell suspension flow through a translucent scaffold should be visible. Make sure that the entire scaffold fills up with cell suspension.\nSubmerge the scaffolds in cell culture media and incubate them at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5 wt.% CO2 for up to 10 days.\nReplenish the cell culture media according to experimental needs.\n5. Live/dead assay and cell imaging\nAfter incubation, rinse the scaffolds with PBS.\nWith a blunt-end needle, carefully inject the previously prepared live/dead solution (4 mM calcein-AM and 2 mM propidium iodide in PBS) into the scaffolds and incubate them in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Make sure that the solution flows through the length of the entire scaffold.\nRinse the scaffolds with PBS.\nCarefully transfer the scaffolds to a glass slide.\nObserve the dyed cells directly in the scaffolds under a fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: Viable cells produce green fluorescence and dead cells emit red fluorescence light."
