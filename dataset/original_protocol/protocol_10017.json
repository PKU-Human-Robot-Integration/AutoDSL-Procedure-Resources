    "This protocol follows the guidelines of University of Geneva's human research ethics committee.\n1. Maintenance and culture of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)\nPerform maintenance and expansion of hSECs on feeder-free conditions by pre-coating dishes with a specific extracellular matrix.\n\t\nThaw 300 µL of extracellular matrix at 4 °C (typical range concentration 18-22 mg/mL, keep on ice) and gently mix with 15 mL of cold DMEM medium to avoid a premature gelation of the extracellular matrix. Add 7.5 mL of the extracellular matric to both T150 flasks.\nIncubate the dishes coated with extracellular matrix at 37 °C for at least 1 h (maximum overnight).\nRemove the medium and seed hESCs to a density of 6.5 x 104 cell/cm2.\nMaintain H1 (hESC cell line) in hESC medium and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nPass the cells with enzymatic procedure: add 7.5 mL of enzymatic solution to a T75 cm2 flask over a period of 1-2 min at 37 °C. Once cells are completely detached, add 7.5 mL of DMEM-F12 then centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g. To allow for better survival, re-plate cells at the desired density onto extracellular matrix-coated dishes, in the same medium containing Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (10 µM) for 24 h.\n2. hESC-derived neural organoids for GBM studies\n24 h before starting the 3D culture, replace the hESC medium with a serum-free medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (both components are necessary to support cell survival and spontaneous neurosphere formation during the aggregation phase in a microwell plate). The cells should be at 60% confluency. The next day (day 0), detach hESC colonies as single cells: remove the medium, then rinse with PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, add 5 mL of enzymatic dissolution solution, and incubate at 37 °C for 1-2 min.",
    "Collect the cells in serum-free medium with 10 µM of ROCK inhibitor and centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and count the cells in 10 mL of serum-free medium supplemented with 10 µM of ROCK inhibitor.\nIn parallel, rinse the microwell plate with 2 mL of serum-free medium per well and centrifuge the plate at 1200 x g for 5 min to remove all bubbles, which can prevent neurosphere formation.\nPrepare 28.2 x 106 of cells in 12.5 mL of serum-free medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor. Dispense 1000 cells/microwell. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min and place the plate in the incubator at 37 °C overnight (maximum 36 h). For example: to obtain 30 human neural organoids, use one T150 flask at 70%-80% of confluence (about 30 million cells).\nThe next day (day 1), collect the spheres (with a P1000) and place them in a 6 well plate. In each well, add 2 mL of B27 medium and DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX and Neurobasal medium (mix at 1:1), supplemented with 1% B27 supplements and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA). To promote fast neural induction, supplement the medium with dual-SMAD inhibition cocktail, composed of 10 µM TGFβ/Activin/Nodal inhibitor and 0.5 µM bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor. From this step forward, the spheres are cultured in rotation (60 rpm, orbital shaker). The rotation is critical to prevent the spheres from sticking together or to the plate.\nChange the medium every 2-3 days: bend the plate and let the spheres fall down for 5 min, remove half of the medium (2 mL), and add 2 mL of fresh B27 medium supplemented with growth factors and inhibitors. Do not centrifuge the spheres.\nPerform neural induction according to the following time course:",
    "From days 1-4, culture the spheres in B27 medium supplemented with dual-SMAD. The dual-SMAD inhibition cocktail (10 µM TGFβ/Activin/Nodal inhibitor and 0.5 µM BMP inhibitor) promote the neural induction.\nFrom days 4-11, promote proliferation of hESC-derived neural rosettes (into the spheres), by adding 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast factor (bFGF) to the B27 medium supplemented with dual-SMAD cocktail.\n\t\tNOTE: On day 11, most of the cells should be positive for Nestin.\nFrom days 11-13, culture the spheres in B27 medium supplemented with 0.5 µM BMP inhibitor.\nFrom days 13-21, culture the spheres in B27 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), 10 ng/mL brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 1 µM of γ-secretase inhibitor. GDNF and BDNF promote neuronal and glial differentiation. The γ-secretase inhibitor allows for greater neural maturation.\nOn day 21, plate the spheres (about 1,000 spheres) on a hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane (6 mm diameter, 0.4 µm) deposited on a culture plate insert designed for 6 well plate. Stop any rotation from this step. The presence of rosettes, observed with a bright-field microscope, indicate the initiation of neural differentiation. The neural rosettes can be observed 2-3 days after plating spheres on the PTFE membrane.\nAdd 1 mL of B27 medium supplemented with growth factors and inhibitors (as followed) to each well underneath the membrane insert, every 2-3 days (usually on Monday, Wednesday and Friday), for a following 3 weeks of differentiation.\nFrom days 21-25, cultivate human neural organoids in the same neural maturation medium (Cf. step 2.7.4).\nFrom days 25-28, only complement B27 medium with 1 µM γ-secretase inhibitor.\nFrom days 28-39, stop adding the γ-secretase inhibitor and continue human neural organoid culture in B27 medium only.",
    "NOTE: After 3 weeks, neural organoids are ready to use for GIC implantation. Along the neural maturation, a decrease of neural immature marker Nestin and increase of mature neural markers β3-tubulin and GFAP were observed.\n3. Isolation and cultivation of glioblastoma-initiating cells (GICs)\nIsolate GICs by fragmenting a high grade human GBM biopsy. Transfer the piece of tumor in a beaker containing 0.25% trypsin in 0.1 mM EDTA (4:1) and slowly stir at 37 °C for 30-60 min (depending on tumor size).\nPlate the dissociated cells in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks plated at 2,500-5,000 cells per cm2 in GIC medium: DMEM/F-12 medium (1:1) containing 1% N2, 1% B27, and 1% G5 supplements (to favor GIC survival), supplemented with bFGF and EGF (both at 10 ng/Ml, to promote stemness) and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin.\nOnce the GIC is well-established and growing, remove the N2 and G5 supplements from the GIC medium.\nOne day before adding the cells onto the organoid, dissociate the GICs and count them.\nRinse the microwell plate with 2 mL of GIC medium and centrifuge the plate at the maximum speed to remove bubbles (1000 x g). Place the GICs at 1,000 cells to obtain one gliomasphere per microwell. Incubate overnight at 37 °C (Figure 1C). This step is key and allows for well-calibrated GICs (an example of necrotic and over-sized GICs is shown in Figure 2A,C).\nTo initiate GBM invasion, add one gliomasphere on top of the neural tissue with a large bore pipet tip (Figure 1F). Carefully place the 6 well plate back in the incubator.\n4. hESC-derived dopaminergic organoids for PD studies",
    "Day 0: Amplify hESCs in 2D culture up to 60% confluency (day 0), then replace stem cell media used to maintain pluripotency features of hESCs with a serum-free medium. Start neural induction by supplementing culture medium with 0.5 µM BMP inhibitor and 10 µM TGFβ/Activin/Nodal inhibitor (dual-SMAD inhibition cocktail), then add 10 µM ROCK inhibitor for 24 h to increase the survival rate of cells during passage.\nDay 1: Prepare the microwell plate with 2.5 mL per well of serum-free medium supplemented with 0.5 µM BMP inhibitor, 10 µM TGFβ/Activin/Nodal inhibitor, and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor. To specify cells towards the ventral pattern of the neural tube, add 100 ng/mL Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), 100 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), and 2 µM smoothened agonist. Centrifuge the plate (only with medium and without cells) at 1200 x g for 5 min to remove air bubbles from the microwells.\n\t\nAfter 1 day of neural induction in 2D, remove the medium and quickly wash with PBS without Ca2+/MgCl2+. Dissociate the colonies in single cells suspension by adding 7.5 mL of recombinant enzymatic solution in a T75 cm2 flask. Incubate for 2 min at 37 °C then complete with 7.5 mL of DMEM-F12.\nCollect the cell suspension and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and count the cells in the same medium used to prepare the microwell plate.\nAdjust the medium volume to obtain a cell suspension allowing to form neurospheres containing 1000 cells per microwell (for example, the microwell plate used here contains 4,700 microwells per well). So, prepare 4.7 million cells in 2.5 mL of medium and add it to the previous 2.5 mL of medium already placed in the plate.",
    "In order to correctly distribute the cells in each microwell, gently shake the plate, and centrifuge the microwell plate 300 x g for 5 min. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 24 h to generate spheres.\nDay 2: Gently flush the microwells with the medium and collect then transfer the spheres in tissue-treated six-well plate. Replace medium with Neurobasal medium supplemented with 1% B27, 1x NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% of penicillin/ streptomycin. Additionally, add regionalization factors SHH, FGF8, smoothened agonist, and dual-SMAD inhibition small molecules.\n\t\nPlace spheres in rotation at 37 °C (60 rpm, orbital shaker) and change half-medium freshly supplemented every 2-3 days.\nDay 3: To enhance neural induction and convert to neural progenitors with a midbrain identity, supplement the medium with 3 µM GSK-3β inhibitor, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Maintain GSK-3β inhibitor in the medium up to day 13. Split into two new tissue-treated 6 well plates to reduce both sphere density per well and avoid sphere aggregation.\n\tNOTE: At Day 8, most of the cells should be positive for Nestin.\nDay 8: Start the neural maturation: replace regionalization factors SHH, FGF8, smoothened agonist, and dual-SMAD inhibition cocktail with 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP (to favor maturation), 20 nM inhibitor of histone deacetylase (for cell cycle exit), 1 µM γ-secretase inhibitor and growth factors, 10 ng/mL GDNF, 10 ng/mL BDNF, 1 ng/mL transforming growth factor β3 (TGFβ3), and 5 ng/mL FGF20 (both favor DA progenitor survival). Change the medium every 2-3 days.\nDay 21: Generate the neural organoid: seed around 100 neurospheres under air-liquid interface conditions on PTFE membrane (6 mm diameter). Transfer the membrane to a culture plate insert (0.4 mm) and add 1.2 mL of neural maturation medium used for neurosphere differentiation as previously described.",
    "Stop any rotation from this step. Change the medium every 2-3 days until the required differentiation time point is achieved.\n\t\tNOTE: Regarding neural maturation, a decrease of the neural immature marker Nestin and increase of mature neural markers β3-tubulin and GFAP were observed. High TH and NURR1 expressions were observed (Figure 3C) and confirm neural organoid maturity11.\n5. Quantification of TH and Nurr1 gene expression for validation of dopaminergic differentiation\nRNA extraction: On the indicated day of differentiation, lyse 40 neurospheres with 350 µL of RLT buffer (provided in RNA extraction kit) supplemented with 3.5 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol. Extract the RNA from the lysed neurospheres using an RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nQuantify total RNA concentrations.\nPerform reverse transcription of 300 ng of the total RNA extraction using reverse transcription kit for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and follow the manufacturer's instructions .\nPerform qPCR analysis on real-time PCR detection systems, based on asymmetrical cyanine dye detection. Normalize the data with housekeeping genes: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1). Sequences of primers are described in Table 1.\n6. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection\nUse high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection to detect the presence of dopamine. Dopamine was extracted by lysing neural organoids in 100 mL of 0.1 N perchloric acid (HClO4) for 15 min at 4 °C with a vigorous vortexing every 5 min. After centrifugation, collect and store the supernatant at -20 °C for dopamine dosage.\nUse a C-18 column (5 µm, 4.6 mm x 150 mm) to separate the analytes by reversed-phase HPLC in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute. Detection of dopamine should be carried out using a coulometric detector with the conditioning cell set at a potential of +200 mV.",
    "7. Raw data recording with microelectode array (MEA) platform\nUse a dissection microscope to transfer neurospheres to the center of a porous MEA device.\nUse an amplifier and data acquisition system for electrophysiological recordings. Measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the standard deviation of the voltage during a 5 min recording, using the signal as the average peak-to-peak voltage of the spikes recorded in the same 5 min periods."
