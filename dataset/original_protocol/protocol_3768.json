Sterile tumor tissue procurement and tumor core punches\n(A) Upon completion of liver resection, specimen is placed on a sterile field. With guidance of pathologist a 1 cm thick wedge of tissue is removed from specimen to access tumor tissue. Scale bar is equal to 5 cm.\n(B) A 6 mm biopsy punch is used to core tumor tissue for slice protocol.\n(C) Samples are taken from tumor periphery to avoid areas of central necrosis.\nCritical: Tissue collection is done in the presence of a pathology representative to ensure that a complete and proper evaluation of the specimen, including tumor margins and orientation will be maintained. Tissue should not be removed if it will compromise the pathological evaluation.\nUsing a 6-mm biopsy punch, cores of tumor tissue are obtained from the wedge (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Samples are placed directly in 3 mL of ice-cold Belzer UW Cold Storage Solution in 5 mL Eppendorf tubes (sterile), placed on ice, and transported to research lab.",
    "Note: To maximize tissue viability, cores are taken from the periphery of the tumor to avoid areas of central necrosis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). There is significant heterogeneity among cores taken from different regions of a tumor (Kenerson et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), and one needs to consider this issue when designing the experiment.\nCritical: The time between the completion of surgical resection and tissue procurement (i.e., warm ischemic time) should be kept to a minimum – ideally under 10 min. If time between collection and tissue procurement exceeds 45 min viability of slices should be tested prior to proceeding with an experiment. Once tissue is procured it is transported on ice immediately to the research lab for the generation of precision cut slices.\nPrecision cut slices\nTiming: 2–4 h\nNote: The following procedure is described for a vibrating blade microtome instrument such as the Leica VT 1200S vibratome.\nRemove tissue cores from UW solution with sterile forceps and place in a sterile petri dish.\nDab excess liquid on sterile gauze (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/690-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tissue cores embedded in agarose\n(A) Cores are removed from transport solution and excess liquid removed.\n(B and C) (B) Cores are embedded in agarose individually in wells of a 24-well plate or (C) grouped in a well of a 6-well plate.\n(D) Agarose and tissue are adhered to specimen disc.\n(E) Specimen disc is placed in buffer tray with cutting solution on ice for slicing.\nEmbed cores in 2% agarose for slicing.\nIndividual cores can be positioned in the center of one well of a sterile 24-well plate.\nPipette warm (37°C), 2% agarose solution over top of core(s) in each well until tissue is entirely covered, cover plate, and place on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAgarose should solidify in 5 min.",
    "Note: Multiple cores (up to 5) can also be embedded in agarose using one well of a 6-well plate instead of in individual wells of a 24-well dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: Embedding cores in agarose is important for tissue cores with a softer consistency.\nNote: Tissue cores can also be directly glued to the specimen disc with an adhesive for slicing and longer cores can be cut in half with sterile scalpel if desired for greater stability.\nOnce the agarose has solidified, use a sterile scalpel or spatula to cut along the edge of the agarose in the well. With a scooping motion pop the embedded tissue out of the well and onto a sterile petri dish.\nUsing a drop of superglue, glue the face of the embedded core that was on the bottom of the well directly to the specimen disc. The top of the agarose will have a concave shape.\nUp to 4 cores in individual agarose from 24-well or 6 cores not in agarose can be glued to the specimen disc at one time for efficient slicing. If cores were embedded in a 6-well plate, one well (containing up to 5 cores) can be adhered to specimen disc (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nCritical: Ensure that both the tissue and agarose are in contact with the adhesive.\nPlace the buffer tray (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) in ice holder and cover. Add ice around the buffer tray.\nThe specimen disc is then placed in the buffer tray and the buffer tray filled with ice-cold cutting buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: The vibratome should be located in a BSL-2-approved biosafety cabinet for slicing human tissue. Appropriate PPE should be worn while working in a BSL-2 area and when working with human tissue.",
    "Slide the ice tray onto the vibratome stand and lock the tray in place by moving the lever to the right.\nSecure blade into blade holder with an Allen wrench.\nUsing the Allen wrench rotate the blade into cutting position 1, 2, or 3.\nRaise the stage up using the control pad until the blade touches the liquid in the buffer tray.\nSet cutting window using the control pad.\nOnce the window is set, using the run feature step down 250 μm at a time at 1.5 mm/s until blade reaches the tallest tissue core.\nAdjust settings on the vibratome depending on the consistency and integrity of the tissue and the number of cores that are being sliced at one time, (amplitude 2–3, speed 0.5–1.5 mm/s). Troubleshooting\nOnce uniform 250 μm slices are obtained, gently scoop them out of the bath using sterile spatula or forceps.\nPlace each slice in one well of the 48-well dish containing prewarmed modified WME or media of choice.\nEach core and slice are assigned numerical values so that sequence and orientation of slices can be tracked and documented (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/690-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Plating tissue slices\n(A) Tumor slices are placed in wash buffer in a 48-well dish in order of core and slice number.\n(B) Slices are then transferred onto individual Millicell culture inserts placed in a 24-well plate with 450 μL of media.\n(C) One tumor slice plated on a 12 mm insert in a 24-well dish.\n(D) 4 tumor slices plated on a 30 mm insert in a 6-well dish.",
    "Note: Depending on core length and tissue consistency the number of slices obtained from a core can vary. On average from a 1 cm long core, 24 – 32 slices can be generated. When tissue consistency is too firm or too soft the blade may run over the tissue.\nNote: Depending on specific experimental needs, slice thickness can be adjusted accordingly. In our experience, 250 μm slices are a good compromise between ease of tissue slicing/handling and diffusion/penetration of nutrients and drugs.\nOnce a 48-well plate is filled with slices, place in incubator on a rocker (37°C , ∼ 20 rocks/min) for 1 – 4 h for washing until all slicing is complete.\nNote: Before plating slices in cell culture inserts it is recommended to assess tissue viability on a small sample of slices to ensure tissue is viable before experiments commence.\nPlating slices for culture\nTiming: 1 h\nPlace one Millicell cell culture insert into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate using sterile forceps for each slice that will be plated.\nPipette 450 μL of growth media, modified William’s media E supplemented with hEGF (20 ng/mL), into each well, ensuring that at least 100 μL of media is placed in the insert.\nCritical: Tissue slices must be plated on cell culture inserts to maintain viability.\nNote: Media will eventually equilibrate on its own, but in order to plate slices without damaging softer tissue, at least 100 μL of media is needed in each insert.",
    "Using a 1000 μL pipette tip or sterile forceps gently transfer one slice into each insert. Use the liquid in the insert to help remove slice from tip. Once transferred, use the pipette tip to gently move the floating slice so that it is completely flat (some slices will fold during transfer). Remove media in the insert to the outside of insert to ensure the slice is flat on the cell insert membrane, otherwise the slice may fold or bend if media is allowed to equilibrate out of the insert (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C). Some media will eventually equilibrate back into the insert.\nNote: If desired, 3 to 4 slices can be placed on a 30 mm Millicell cell culture insert that fits in a 6-well tissue culture dish with 1.25 mL of media (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nOnce slices are plated, place plate on a rocker (20 rocks/min) at 37°C, 5% CO2. Rocking allows the tissue interface to be exposed to media and air intermittently. (Leeman, et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])\nNote: Rocking is optional.\nAssessment of tissue viability (MTS assay) or pre-treatment MTS\nTiming: 2–4 h\nAssessment of initial tumor viability can be performed on the day of slicing or the after one day in culture depending on timing and treatment scheme. This can be done by performing a cell viability/proliferation assay on at least 3 slices from different areas of the tumor. The more slices that are cultured from different cores or areas of tumor, the more slices should be assessed and the slices should be dispersed throughout the sampling of the tumor. This will ensure that the tissue that you are working with is viable.",
    "We have chosen to asses viability by using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) from Promega which does not require solubilization. We have used MTS to assess viability of slices before and after drug treatment to calculate a percent change in viability for each slice. This method provides the ultimate level of control since you are able to quantify the change in viability for each individual slice. We have had success using this method on tumor slices that are highly robust, such as treatment naïve colorectal liver metastases. However, the MTS reagent/process can have deleterious effects in some tissue slices, which can negatively affect tissue growth in culture. Since one is unable to predict how the tissue will behave in vitro, we have largely relied on a single MTS readout after drug treatment.\nThaw 5 mL aliquots of CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (MTS reagent) in 37°C water bath.\nPlace 400 μL of media into each well of a 48-well dish\nTransfer slices from the Millicell insert to individual wells. Keeping track of slice identification number. Keep 3 wells without slices for blanks.\nAdd 80 μL of MTS reagent to each well of the plate.\nNote: MTS reagent is light sensitive, turn off lights in Biosafety Cabinet when using.\nIncubate tissue with MTS reagent for approximately 3 h.\nMedia and slice will change to a purple color (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Slices can be incubated with MTS reagent from 1 – 4 ho depending on color change that occurs. In our experience we incubate most tissue for 3 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/690-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. MTS assay on tissue slices",
    "(A) Tissue slices are transferred to individual wells of a 48-well dish containing 400 μL of media. 80 μL of MTS reagent is added. Plate is incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3 h.\n(B) 200 μL of media is transferred to 96-well assay plate and absorbance read at 490 nm.\nOnce incubation is finished, transfer 200 μL of each blank well and each slice well to a 96-well assay plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nRead absorbance at 490 nm, blanks are averaged and subtracted from the values of the wells containing slices. Troubleshooting\nAt this point slices can be fixed in 10% formalin for histology, frozen for protein analysis, or transferred back on initial Millicell insert for drug testing and further culturing.\nCritical: It is important to keep track of every slice when moving from insert to 48-well dish for MTS so that the pre and post MTS can be used to calculate change in viability for each slice.\nExample of treatment of slices: Chemotherapy/immunotherapy\nTiming: 2–6 days\nThe tumor slice culture method can be used to study tumor response to chemotherapies, immunotherapies, or combined chemo-immunotherapies. In previously published work (Jabbari et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) the response of human colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) treated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy combinations was evaluated utilizing tissue slice cultures. Here we show an example of a case of CRLM treated with two different chemotherapy combinations with endpoints for tumor response including viability (based on percent change in MTS absorbance), histology including immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.",
    "Critical: In our experience, slices that are generated from tumors that have undergone treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation may not grow well in the in vitro system. Untreated tumors are ideal for drug treatment experiments since they are treatment naïve. Tumors that are progressing on treatment are also likely to grow well in vitro.\nTumor slices are prepared as described above and incubated for 12 to 18 h.\nIn this example (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), a pre-treatment MTS is performed on half of the slices before plating in order to determine change in viability with treatment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/690-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Tumor treatment scheme with multiple readouts\nTumor slices from a CRLM were treated with vehicle control (0.2% DMSO), FX (1 μg/mL 5FU + 1 μg/mL Oxaliplatin), FI (1 μg/mL 5FU + 2 μg/mL Irinotecan, or STS (10 μm Staurosporine, to serve as a positive control) two times over 4 days.\n(A) One set of treated slices were used to calculate percent change in viability using pre-treatment and post-treatment MTS values and subsequently fixed for histology. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation. Fixed slices were processed for immunohistochemistry staining with Ki67 (Dako, 1:200). Scale bar is equal to 250 μm.\n(B) Another set of treated slices were used to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. Figure reprinted with permission from Jabbari et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]. Note how slices are dispersed over the treatment and endpoint assay.\nThe following day working solutions of chemotherapies or immunotherapies are prepared fresh by diluting stock solutions of each drug in media.\nIn this example n of 3 slices were treated with the following\nControl - 0.2% DMSO (vehicle)\nFX - 1 μg/mL 5-fluorouracil + 1 μg/mL oxaliplatin\nFI - 1 μg/mL 5-fluorouracil + 2 μg/mL irinotecan\n10 μM Staurosporine - positive control",
    "Critical: Since consecutive slices are more biologically identical and have been shown to have comparable MTS readouts, they are purposely dispersed across treatment groups when comparing different treatments. See Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B for example of slice dispersion.\nNote: If slices are treated with immunotherapies or combined chemo-immunotherapies (Jabbari et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) use appropriate IgG antibody for negative control.\nSlices are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 with chemotherapy or immunotherapy for desired treatment period. Adding fresh drug every 1 to 2 days depending on treatment duration.\nIn Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], tissue slices were treated with 3 consecutive days adding fresh media with drug daily.\nNote: Depending on chosen experimental chemotherapies and immunotherapies, length and dosing of treatments will vary. For FDA-approved drugs, we use drug concentrations that are achievable in serum based on available clinical data. In general, we treat slices for 3 to 5 days depending on desired endpoints. We add media with fresh drugs every one to two days.\nAt the end of the treatment downstream assays are performed.\nIn Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, one set of slices were subject to a post-treatment MTS followed by fixation in 10% formalin for histological analysis.\nPercent change in viability was calculated for each slice using the following equation. Percent change in viability = ((post-treatment MTS – pre-treatment MTS)/pre-treatment MTS Absorbance))∗100. The percent change in viability is averaged for each treatment group (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). P-value was calculated using Students t-test. Troubleshooting\nAdditional treated slices are placed in RNAlater for RNAseq analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nCritical: It is necessary to keep track of the identification number of each slice and its corresponding treatment group. This will be imperative when calculating percent change in viability from an MTS absorbance obtained on each slice before and after treatment.",
    "Note: Slices that have been exposed to MTS reagent can also be fixed for histological analysis or frozen for protein analysis, such as Western Blot. This is beneficial since you can achieve multiple readouts on the same tissue slice and streamline experiments.\nCritical: If slices will be used for RNA analysis or live imaging they should not be exposed to MTS reagent and need to have parallel treatment replicates for these endpoints.\nExample of treatment of slices: Adoptive cellular therapy\nTiming: 3–6 days\nThe tumor slice culture system can be used to evaluate adoptive cellular therapy. In previously published work (Brempelis et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) the therapeutic efficacy of genetically engineered macrophages (GEMs) were evaluated in tumor slice culture. The GEMs infiltrate and persist in tumor slice for at least 1 week in culture (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Downstream assays of tumor cell death, cytokine production and modification of tumor immune microenvironment were conducted. Our lab has also treated slices with CAR-T cells in order to evaluate the effect of modulation of the tumor microenvironment on CAR-T anti-tumor immunity.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/690-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. GEMS infiltrate, persist, and function in tumor slice culture\n(A) Confocal fluorescent microscopic images of colorectal cancer liver metastasis slice four (left panel) and seven days (right panel) after addition of GEMs. Scale bar is equal to 100 μm.\n(B) IL-12 production quantified by ELISA in 3 slice culture experiments, 2 colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) and 1 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Columns represent mean of 3 biologic replicates ± standard deviation.\nGEMs are prepared. See previously published work for details (Brempelis et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Moyes et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Alternatively, CAR-T cells can be utilized and thawed from frozen aliquots at the time of the experiment.\nTumors slices are prepared as described above.\nSlices are incubated 12 – 18 h.",
    "The day after slicing, cells are prepared as follows:\nGEMs or CAR-T cells are stained with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) per manufacturer’s protocols.\nGEMs or CAR-T cells are resuspended in cell culture media to a predetermined cell number and concentration desired for the experiment (we have used CAR-T cells at a count of 105–106 per slice).\nPreviously untreated slice culture media was removed and replaced with 400 μL of slice culture media with any additional treatment at appropriate concentration or controls (for example, cytokine blockade).\nCellular therapy was added to each slice to achieve a final volume of 450 μL.\nSlices with GEMs or CAR-T cells are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for the desired treatment period.\nDownstream assays performed\nFour and seven days after GEM addition, slices were fixed in formalin for histology and immunohistochemistry, stored in RNAlater for transcriptomic analyses, and/or Live Cell Imaging performed as well as quantification of IL-12 production via ELISA (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nLive cell imaging\nTiming: 5–8 h\nWe have used fluorescent staining and confocal microscopic imaging of live slices to evaluate for evidence of anti-tumor immunity as a result of manipulation of the tumor microenvironment (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). In the above protocol, we stain the adaptive cellular therapy (for example, CAR-T cells) with CFSE for imaging. We also use fluorescently labeled antibodies to stain and identify tumor cells, for example those which express the EpCAM antigen. In addition, we labeled apoptotic cells with SR-FLICA reagent, which stains activated cleaved-caspase-3.\nTumor slices are transferred from the original media which is set aside to a 48-well plate with 500 μL of fresh media with 10 μg/mL Alexa 647 EpCAM antibody and SR-FLICA reagent per the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "The slices are incubated with the primarily conjugated fluorescent antibodies for 3 h at 37°C\nThe slices are stained for nuclei using 10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) for 10 min.\nThe slices are washed of the fluorescent staining antibodies by sequentially transferring twice to separate wells containing PBS, and returned with their original media containing the treatment to an 8-well chamber slides with a coverslip bottom (Ibidi) for imaging.\nThe slices are maintained at 37°C using a covered stage (PeCon, Erbach, Germany) while flushing warmed, humidified CO2 through the enclosure in order to maintain culture conditions during the duration of the imaging.\nThe slices are imaged using a confocal microscope (for example, Leica SP8X, Leica Microsystems) at 20× magnification. Each treated slice was imaged for 1 h at multiple positions throughout the slice with a z-stack of 20 mm (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for live-imaging video of tissue slice culture).\nImage processing and data analysis were performed on Leica LAS X software (Leica Microsystems) and Imaris software (Bitplane).\nApoptotic tumor cells that are EpCAM+ SR-FLICA+ and CFSE+ CAR-T cells can be counted to quantify cell populations. Imaris also has the capability to determine proximity analysis amongst other analyses.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.
