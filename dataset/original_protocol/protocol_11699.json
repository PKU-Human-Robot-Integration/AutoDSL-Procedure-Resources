  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures have been approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. NOTE: The following protocol describes a single approach to CPP and locomotor sensitization, many details of which differ from other successful protocols (e.g., light- vs. dark-phase testing, consecutive vs. intermittent dosing, etc.). Novices may wish to begin with these protocols, or simply use them as guides, adapting alterations from the literature based on the experimental question(s) at hand. Automated measurement methods are described; however, it is possible to use non-automated means for each assay (i.e., video recording, hand-scoring).\n1. Conditioned Place Preference\nEquipment and Room Set-Up:\nHandle experimental mice for 1-3 min each day, for at least 3-5 days prior to testing.\n\t\tNOTE: Never-handled mice may find removal from the chamber stressful, which can interfere with or alter conditioning.\nObtain four or more three-chambered CPP apparatuses, preferably equipped with photobeams for automated data collection18. Ensure that each chamber has two larger, visually- and tactilely-distinct chambers connecting to a smaller, neutral chamber via doors that can be raised/lowered to control access. Lids on each chamber should open for insertion/removal of mice and be mounted with small, individually controllable (dimmable) lights (one per chamber).\n\t\tNOTE: CPP chamber designs vary and can be purchased commercially or constructed by researchers. For the \"balanced\" design, a recommended scheme is one larger chamber with white walls and wire grid flooring and the other with black walls and bar flooring. The middle chamber should have gray walls and solid gray Plexiglass flooring. For explanation purposes, these chambers will be referred to as \"white,\" \"black\" and \"middle.\" Lids should be clear Plexiglass. Alternate compartment configurations (one- or two-chamber) are also possible and discussed elsewhere (see Discussion).",
    "Setup the room as it will be during testing: turn off or set overhead lights to the dimmest setting and close the door. Use a light meter inside each chamber and set the lid lights so that middle chambers are slightly brighter (15-20 lux) than black and white chambers (6-10 lux) in order to discourage mice from spending time there.\n\t\tNOTE: If the average time spent in the middle is as much or more than in the black or white chambers, further increase the lighting contrast described in Step 1.1.3. Alternatively, use less appealing flooring for the middle. (e.g., ~220 0.5 cm diameter holes, evenly spaced in 6 x 3.5 x ¼\" Plexiglass), but avoid making this chamber aversive. Pilot any alterations to ensure that decreases in middle time are not due to decreases in total explorations (crossings).\nProgram automated data collection (\"procedure,\" Figure 1A) or manually collect data according to the following parameters. Set trials to start upon the first beam break in either conditioning chamber. Set \"test\" sessions to be 20 min in length and to track time spent and beam breaks in each chamber. Set \"conditioning\" sessions to be 30 min long and (optionally) to measure beam breaks in each chamber. Set all chamber lights to illuminate during trial.\nPrepare full volume of cocaine solution required for the experiment at hand. Dissolve cocaine HCl in 0.9% NaCl (saline), basing the final concentration on an injection volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight (e.g., for a dose of 5 mg/kg, solution concentration is 0.5 mg/ml). Vortex mixture for 30-45 sec, sterile filter (0.2 μm syringe filters) and store at RT.\nTesting:",
    "NOTE: The general timeline for CPP is PRE-TEST, CONDITIONING, and then POST-TEST. The pre-test may be separated from conditioning by 1-3 days; however, conditioning and the post-test day should take place on consecutive days (Figure 2A). This timing should be kept the same for all cohorts in the same experiment.\n\t\nTest during the animals' light phase using the same apparatus for each animal across days.\nEach trial day (i.e., tests and conditioning days), move mice to the behavioral anteroom and allow them to sit undisturbed in their home cages for 1-1.5 hrs before the trial. Choose a location where mice can be moved swiftly from their cage to the apparatus, with minimal disruption, when the trial begins. Turn on all equipment so that any noises associated with the test (e.g., equipment fans) are present.\nThoroughly clean each apparatus (inner walls, flooring and trays) with mild, alcohol-, glycol-ether- or ammonia-based disinfecting wipes prior to and after each mouse (use the same type of cleaner throughout the experiment). Do not neglect flooring undersides.\nCheck that room lights are set appropriately (off or dimmed) at the beginning of each day.\nProceed with the following according to whether it is a \"test\" or \"conditioning\" day:\n\t\t\nOn Trial Days 1 and 6 (i.e., the pre- and post-tests), place the inter-chamber doors in the open position (Figure 2B).\nLoad the \"test\" computer program and enter animal IDs (Figure 1A), then issue start command (Figure 1B), if applicable.\nGently lower each mouse into the middle chamber of its assigned apparatus, facing the back wall, and softly close the lid. Once all chambers are loaded, leave the testing room and minimize noise.\nLeave mice inside each apparatus until trials for all mice have closed/ended (Figure 1C). Export trial data.",
    "Just prior to or following the pre-test, weigh the animals. Use these weights for dose calculations during conditioning.\nIn order to prepare for conditioning trials, calculate each mouse's pre-test \"preference\" for the black and white chambers by subtracting time spent in each of these from the other (i.e., \"black minus white\" & \"white minus black\"; see Figure 3, Columns 9 & 10).\nSince mice with strong initial preferences make balancing difficult, establish an acceptable limit for preference scores (e.g., <33% of total trial time) and exclude mice that exceed it from calculations. Use a liberal limit (<66% of total trial time) to maximize inclusion when attrition is likely after testing is complete (e.g., due to off-target surgical manipulations).\n\t\tNOTE: Mice exceeding the limit can still be tested, with an attempt to keep their pre-test preferences balanced. Later, these mice can be excluded from analysis, if necessary, to balance pre-test scores. If extreme pre-test biases (i.e., >800 sec) disproportionately affect one group, consider altering the conditioning environments and/or using other assays.\nChoose the black or white chamber as the drug-pairing chamber for each mouse, meanwhile summing the corresponding pre-test preference scores within each group with the following priorities in mind:\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to balance scores between groups within each cohort as well as across any previous cohorts.\n\t\t\nMake the sums for all groups as equivalent as possible.\nMake the sums as close to zero as possible (i.e., choose the preferred side for some mice and the non-preferred side for others). If a near-zero sum is impossible for any given group, re-adjust all others to closely match the best obtainable score for the limiting group, favoring slightly negative group sums over positive.",
    "As much as feasible, keep assignments of black versus white and preferred versus non-preferred chambers for drug pairings even within each group.\nAs it is not always possible to meet the above goals, correct any deviations by making opposing balancing considerations in later cohorts; however, try to avoid producing cohorts with wildly different average pre-test preferences.\nOn Conditioning Days 2-5, place inter-chamber doors in the closed position (Figure 2C).\nPrepare individual syringes with cocaine (Days 2 & 4) or saline (Days 3 & 5) solution, as described in Step 1.1.5 and based on body weights measured at pre-test.\n\t\tNOTE: Dose should be chosen with regard to experimental expectations, considerations mentioned in the Introduction, and potential floor and ceiling effects. It is often best to conduct independent experiments using at least two different doses.\nLoad \"conditioning\" computer program and enter animal IDs (Figure 1A), then issue start command (Figure 1B), if applicable.\nScruff and inject each mouse (i.p.), immediately lowering them into the appropriate black or white chamber of their assigned apparatus facing the back wall, then softly close the lid. Once all chambers are loaded, leave the testing room and minimize noise.\nRemove mice from their chamber as close to exactly 30 min as feasible (i.e., the first mice are removed from their chambers while other mice are still conditioning). Remove animals as quietly as possible, without introducing noise.\nStatistical Analysis:\nChoose a method of analysis. Either subtract time spent on the saline-paired side during the post-test from time spent on the cocaine-paired side during the post-test (cocaine - saline, sec) or use the time spent in the post-test drug-paired chamber minus the pre-test time spent on the drug-paired chamber.",
    "NOTE: if using the first method, also plot line graphs of average time spent in the middle, saline- and drug-paired chambers during the pre- and post-tests for each group. Compared to the pre-test, the post-test should show increased time in the drug-paired side and decreased time spent in the saline-paired side (see Figure 6, bottom, and Discussion for explanation).\nDepending upon the nature and number of groups being compared, use a t-test, One- or Two-Way ANOVA, as appropriate, possibly with post-hoc analysis, to analyze either of the above-presented subtraction scores.\n\t\tNOTE: Cocaine preference scores tend to be variable, and furthermore, can be negative (i.e., indicate aversion to the drug-paired side). Mice that show aversion should not be removed (unless they are statistical outliers), since this result is normal and likely important to determining differences between groups. Expect to need sample sizes of 12 to 30 animals per group, depending on the effect size of the treatment.\n2. Locomotor Sensitization\nEquipment and Room Set-Up\nObtain a 4 x 8 (X x Y) photobeam array (outside dimensions 11.5\" x 20\"). Construct an open-topped chamber made of black Plexiglas (inner dimensions 22 1/6\" x 13 ¾\" x 9 3/8\") to house the array (Figure 4A).\nPrepare the testing room so that a red light (ceiling- or wall-mounted) can be used during testing.\nPrepare separate program sessions for daily habituation and injection trials.\n\t\t\nSet habituation trials to be between 30-60 min and injection trials to be between 60-120 min (Figure 5B). The recommended length for each is 60 min. Keep trial length consistent across multiple cohorts within the same experiment.",
    "Set trials to start recording upon the first beam break that occurs after the start signal has been initiated (Figure 5B). For the injection trial, set the start signal so that boxes can be started individually (not in unison), if possible.\nSet beam breaks to be recorded in user-defined \"bins,\" preferably 5 min each (Figure 5B).\nPrepare full volume of cocaine solution required for the experiment at hand. Dissolve cocaine HCl in 0.9% NaCl (saline), basing the final concentration on an injection volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight (e.g., for a dose of 5 mg/kg, solution concentration is 0.5 mg/ml). Vortex mixture for 30-45 sec, sterile filter (0.2 μm syringe filters) and store at RT.\nTesting\n\tNOTE: The initial phase of testing runs for 10-11 consecutive days. Mice receive two daily trials: habituation (injection-free) and injection. Administer saline for the first three to four days (see Discussion for importance of saline habituation), and cocaine for the next seven using the same dose (e.g., 15 mg/kg/day).\n\t\nEach day, acclimate mice in their home cages to the behavioral anteroom for 30 min to 1 hr.\nPrepare clean standard mouse-sized clear acrylic housing cages with an extremely thin layer of fresh bedding (e.g., pine chips), so as to not obscure photobeams, if applicable (Figure 4C & D).\nPlace cages against the Y-axis of the photobeam array near one end, so that five beams are spaced evenly along its length. X-axis beams are not used in this test (Figure 4C & D).\nTake mice from their home cage, in random order, scruff and weigh them. Remove each mouse from the weigh boat by the base of their tail (with support) and place directly into their assigned locomotor cage. Cover each cage with a standard filter-top lid.",
    "Prepare individual syringes with saline or cocaine solution, as described in Step 2.1.7, based on the current day's body weights. Begin with a dose of 15 or 20 mg/kg, and consider a second experiment using a higher or lower dose (see Discussion for relevant factors).\nOnce habituation trials have ended for all cages, load the injection program.\nOne at a time, remove mice from their test cage, scruff and give their injection (i.p.). Before returning the mouse to its test cage, quickly initiate the start signal for that cage (Figure 5C, bottom).\nAfter all injection trials have ended, return mice to their home cages and their housing room.\nIf desired, allow mice to undergo a series of withdrawal periods and drug challenges, such as the following: same dose as original, half-dose, double-dose, then saline, allowing seven days before the same-dose challenge and three to seven days before each additional challenge. Whatever the choice of challenges, maintain similar withdrawal periods across cohorts within an experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: If the original dose is high (e.g., 30 mg/kg or above), the double-dose should be skipped or replaced with a lower dose. The saline challenge reveals any conditioned locomotor activation by the cocaine-paired environment alone, and in the process, the amount of sensitized locomotion that is cocaine-dependent (see Discussion).\nStatistical Analysis\nChoose the portion(s) of each trial that will be used for analysis. Most cocaine-induced locomotion in rodents occurs within the first ~15-30 min after drug injection. Depending on involved variables, consider analyzing cumulative locomotion for multiple time windows (e.g., the first 15, 30, 60 and/or 120 min) or focus on independent segments of the trial.",
    "Using the time frame chosen, sum the beam breaks for each animal by day for habituation and injection trials separately and then average the sums for each group. Plot means and standard errors of the mean (S.E.M.) in a line graph over all days. As treatments may alter how mice respond to the drug early and/or late in each daily trial, also plot average group beam breaks by 5-min bin over the course of each daily trial.\n\t\tNOTE: Plotting daily activity averages for habituation and injection trials (e.g., first 15 min) makes it artificially appear that locomotion is dampened by saline injection, but remember that activity has (most likely) declined to this level by the end of habituation each day.\nAnalyze consecutive saline and drug treatment days separately using repeated measures (RM) ANOVAs having the within-subjects factor of day/time and including any between-subjects factors in the design, as appropriate. Use a t-test or One-Way ANOVA to investigate group differences on Day 1 of cocaine (acute exposure), and a Multivariate ANOVA for the challenges. When appropriate, follow significance with post-hoc tests or Univariate ANOVAs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
