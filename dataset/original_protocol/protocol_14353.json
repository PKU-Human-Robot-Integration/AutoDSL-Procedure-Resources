    "Protocol and video shooting were approved by the institutional review board of the Medical University of Graz (Votum 27-126ex14/15). Written consent for this video publication was obtained from the child and her parent.\n1. Instruments and Materials\nCut calibrated (ISO 015/02) and sterile paper points, usually used in endodontic therapy, at the first ring mark in order to standardize their length (Figure 1).\nApply UV light irradiation at 260 nm for 30 min in order to avoid DNA and RNA contamination of the paper points (Figure 2).\nAutoclave the tubes for storage at 120 °C and 1.2 bar for 20 min and UV-irradiate them as well or employ ready-to-use gamma irradiated tubes.\n2. Preparation of Subjects\nNote: Written informed consent was obtained from the child and her parent prior to enrollment.\nApply cocoa butter to the lips.\nMount the cheek and tongue retractor for full access to both dental arches.\nStain the dental plaque with plaque disclosure.\nRemove the dry field apparatus.\nRinse the mouth with water until the water is colorless.\nBrush teeth thoroughly with an electric tooth brush at 45 ° angulation. Apply water only but no toothpaste, as this would alter the oral biofilm.\nMount the dry field apparatus again, including the tongue guard to keep the mouth open and dry.\nClean and dry the index teeth with sterile cotton swabs to avoid absorption of supragingival fluid during paper point sampling.\n3. Biofilm Sampling\nPaper point sampling of the subgingival sulcus\nGrasp the paper points with sterile dental tweezers.\nInsert paper points tangentially up to a defined length of 4 mm. Take special care not to traumatize the junctional epithelium (Figure 3).\nRemove paper points after 20 s.",
    "Collect paper points directly into prepared tubes: place the paper point tip directly in a sterile and DNA-free vial, and cut it at the third mark to a standardized length of 4 mm (Figure 4).\nIf indicated by the study protocols, insert two paper points parallel and simultaneously at the same site (Figure 5A).\nAlternatively, collect paper points from several sites if the study protocol requires \"pooled samples\" (Figure 5B).\nRemove the dry field apparatus for mucosal and saliva sampling.\nMucosal paper point sampling\nApply paper points to the vestibular fold of the upper cheek (Figure 6).\nClose the cheek and massage it briefly.\nOpen the cheek and remove the paper points after 20 s.\nCut paper points at the third mark and place them in a sterile tube as indicated for subgingival sampling.\nSaliva sampling\nLet the child spit unstimulated saliva into a sterilized collection vessel (Figure 7).\n4. Transfer and Storage\nCollect paper points as single, pooled, or parallel samples depending on the study design (Figure 8).\nApply a color-coded storage system to facilitate further sample management (Figure 9).\nFinally, store the samples at −80 °C pending microbiome analysis."
