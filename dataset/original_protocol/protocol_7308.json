    "See Figure 2 for a schema depicting the different steps of the protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4515/bioprotoc-12-18-4515-g002.jpgFigure 2. Behavioral protocol to investigate hedonic responses using the TR test. House rats individually in standard (e.g., 42 × 26 × 20 cm) polycarbonate cages in a colony room under controlled standard conditions (12 h light/dark cycles starting at 8 am; ambient temperature of 21 °C). Always make food available in the home cages. Note that individual housing is to prevent rats from pulling out cannula from cage mates.Cannulation surgerySurgically implant rats with an intraoral cannula using the method described by Parker (1995) and as previously used in our laboratory (Gasalla et al., 2016, 2017). The cannulation procedure (see Figure 3) is described in detail in Note 4 below.Monitoring and habituationAfter recovery from the surgery, place rats on a water-restriction schedule, comprising 1 h daily access to water (given approximately 2 h after any experimental fluid exposure) and free access to food in the home cage. Home cage food and water intake can be monitored, but this is not essential. Then, habituate rats to the infusion procedure by delivering a 1 mL water infusion (rate of infusion 1 mL/min) in the TR apparatus.Intraoral conditioningThe next four days constitute the conditioning phase. On these sessions, place rats in the TR apparatus (with their cannula attached to the infusion pump for fluid delivery). Intraorally infuse them with the saccharin solution for 2 min (1 mL/min) and deliver an injection of LiCl (group Lithium), hypertonic NaCl (group Hypertonic), or isotonic saline (group Isotonic), immediately after the intraoral infusion. Give the rats water-recovery days in the home cage after the second and fourth conditioning sessions. Video-record the orofacial responses displayed by the rats during the infusion of the saccharin solution.",
    "Orofacial reactivity testPerform a TR test the day after the last conditioning session. Deliver an intraoral administration of the saccharin solution for 2 min (1 mL/min) while video-recording the rats’ orofacial responses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4515/bioprotoc-12-18-4515-g003.jpgFigure 3. Cannulation procedure. The figure shows two steps of the cannulation procedure. (A) Insert a guide needle inside the mouth. (B) Insert the intraoral cannula through the needle. See Note 4 for a more detailed description of the cannulation procedure.Scored orofacial reactions:Appetitive responses: tongue protrusions (extension of the tongue out of the mouth), mouth movements (movement of the lower mandible without opening the mouth), and paw licks (midline extension of the tongue directed to the forepaws). Use the total number of seconds that the rats display the responses as the appetitive response score. For representative appetitive TR responses, see Figure 4A and Video 1 showing orofacial responses scored in this protocol.Aversive responses: gaping (rapid–large amplitude opening of the mandible with retraction of the corners of the mouth), chin rubbing (mouth or chin in direct contact with the floor or wall of the chamber and body projected forward), paw treading (forward and backward movements of the forepaws in synchronous alternation), forelimb flails (rapid horizontal movements of the forelimbs to remove fluid from the fur), and head shakes (rapid side-to-side head movements with the mouth open in order to remove the fluid out of the mouth). Sum these scores to provide a total aversive response score (see Figure 4B and Video 1 for representative aversive responses).Assess the percentage of time spent immobile over the infusion period (scored as suppression of all movements in the rat, with the exception of those required for respiration) as an index of conditioned fear.",
    "In addition, score the frequency of passive dripping (each occasion on which a drop of fluid is allowed to leak out of the mouth to the floor without other orofacial reactions; see Figure 4C and Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4515/bioprotoc-12-18-4515-g004.jpgFigure 4. Representative orofacial reactivity responses. (A) Appetitive responses: tongue protrusion, paw licking, and lateral tongue protrusions. (B) Aversive responses: gaping, head shaking, chin rubbing, and forelimb flailing. (C) Passive responses: dripping and immobility (Based on Inui and Shimura, 2017).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
