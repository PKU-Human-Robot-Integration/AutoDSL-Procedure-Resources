    "NOTE: The Patient shown in the video has agreed on publication of the video material. Written consent was obtained. The protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of the University of Freiburg. Though surgeons may have different preferences, the following protocol will focus on the authors’ preferred technique.\n1. Pre-operative Workup\nAccomplish a standardized pre-operative work-up that consists of a structured history and thorough examination for accurate treatment planning. Thereby, request the etiology of the disease and ask for functional limitations. It is of utmost importance to determine the time elapsed since onset of the paralysis as this affects planning of treatment.\nTake a functional history including oral continence, drooling and speech. Ask the patient how s/he is limited in social life due to aesthetic and psychological issues.\nNext, take a general medical history to rule out any co-morbidity that would affect the surgical plan.\nExamine the patient from the brow down. Evaluate the degree of brow ptosis, dermatochalasis, lagophthalmos, and ectropion.\nCheck for midface ptosis and for nasolabial crease asymmetry and quantify the excursion of the oral commissure. Note the symmetry of teeth exposure upon smiling and the shape of the smile.\nExamine the cranial nerve V to establish the availability as donor nerve and palpate the facial and superficial temporal arterial pulses to help determine their availability as recipient vessels. Usually upon biting, palpate the masseteric muscle to indicate a functioning masseteric nerve. If unsure, perform an EMG (electromyography) to rule out any deficits of the masseteric nerve.\nFinally, take a series of standardized photographs or videography for medical record with the patient’s face at rest, upon smiling with mouth open and closed. Include a lateral view as the frontal view alone cannot capture the whole amount of movement.",
    "Communicate the treatment options to the patient and closely involve the patient in the decision-making process as this represents the key to a successful outcome.\n\tNOTE: Here, we will focus on the dynamic reconstruction of the smile in patients who present with irreversible atrophy of the facial musculature that are no candidates for or do not wish a two-stage procedure.\nIllustrate the risks of the procedure such as flap loss, hematoma formation, infection, pain, scarring, and unsatisfactory post-operative excursion of the oral commissure and acquire informed consent from the patient. Demonstrate postoperative photographs of previous patients as this will give the patient an idea what to expect and how scarring will look like.\nPerform the operation under general anesthesia without muscle relaxation in order to be able to use a nerve stimulator to identify the masseteric nerve and the obturator branch to the gracilis muscle. Perioperatively, administer a prophylactic antibiotic second-generation cephalosporin (e.g., 1.5 g of Cefuroxime) intravenously.\nPlace the patient supine. Prevent pressure points by using protective padding. Fix the breathing tube to the mandible with an interdental suture (0-0) in order to prevent dislocation from moving the head during surgery.\nUse the gracilis muscle from the ipsilateral thigh. Apply Povidone-iodine solution (250 ml) to the leg that has been chosen for flap harvest and use Octenidine Hydrochloride (500 ml) for skin and mucosal disinfection of the head and neck.\n2. Facial Preparation\nNOTE: Perform the procedure with a two team approach. Here, surgical steps are described one after another.\nTurn the patient’s head to the healthy side and adjust the height of the operating table as desired to alleviate subsequent preparation steps. Together with medical binocular loupes, a LED (light-emitting diode) head light lamp is extremely useful for facial dissection.",
    "Carefully plug fatty gauze into the auditory canal. This prevents blood from flowing in and coagulating.\n\tNOTE: Through the application of hairclips, shaving of hear bearing scalp is not necessary.\nMark the facial incision line. Begin in the scalp approximately 2 cm cranial to the upper pole of the ear. Then course downward in the preauricular area anteriorly to the tragus. Perform a submandibular extension of the incision line of approximately 1.5 cm for adequate exposure and the controlled placement of sutures along the oral commissure in the course of the operation.\nBefore incision is made, apply suprarenin diluted in normal saline solution subcutaneously (dilution: 1:200,000, 40 ml maximum). This prevents excessive bleeding during dissection. Wait for vasoconstriction that is visible shortly thereafter.\nBegin dissection at the level of the SMAS (superficial aponeurotic muscular system). At the anterior border of the masseter muscle continue dissection sub-SMAS in order to identify the facial artery and vein. Prevent visual constraints in the operative field by decent hemostasis in using the bipolar cautery.\nSuperiorly, extend the dissection up onto the body of the zygoma and the temple.\nLocate the temporal vessels that pass superficially over the posterior root of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, thereby covered by a thin fascia.\n\tNOTE: In case of failure of the facial vascular dissection, these vessels may serve as rescue vascular supply to the muscle flap.\nIdentify the facial vessels anteriorly to the masseter muscle. Identify the artery by pulsation and the thick aspect of the vascular wall. It first courses anteriorly parallel to the body of the mandible and then curves upwards. At the oral commissure, it divides to give vascular supply to the lower lip.",
    "Locate the vein that, unlike the artery consist of a thin vascular wall, thereby showing a typical blueish aspect. If the vessels are difficult to identify, locate them at the chin where they cross the mandible.\nContinue dissection anteriorly just above the vessels to the commissure and upper lip. Achieve a long exposure as this is necessary to allow for relocating the vessels towards the masseter muscle for an easy microvascular anastomosis to the pedicle of the gracilis muscle. Try to avoid surgical scissors for preparation of vessels. Use non-traumatic blunt instruments instead.\nApply a micro vessel clip to the proximal end of the facial artery and corresponding vein and clip the distal part. Reflect the vessels posteriorly to alleviate subsequent revascularization of the flap.\n\tNOTE: The following steps are essential for a satisfying postoperative result.\nStart positioning of the sutures for secure anchorage of the muscle at the modiolus close to the oral commissure. Place sutures in the sinewy material of the atrophied perioral musculature. Use a double armed 3-0 polypropylene suture.\nPlace the second suture in the lower lip so that with traction it will elevate the lower lip.\n\tNOTE: This suture will serve as an unlocked temporal pull-out suture to relieve the traction from the flap within the first days after surgery and it will be tied over a bolster after flap insert. The pull-out suture does not take a bite of the muscle and will be removed on postoperative day 7. It is lead out in the temporal region as described in step 4.16.\nPlace the third and fourth sutures in the upper lip along the course of the facial artery.",
    "Carefully check the placement of the four sutures by equally pulling all sutures. The presence of a harmonic natural looking nasolabial crease together with the absence of eversion or inversion of the skin indicates an agreeable result. In case of lip inversion the sutures are most likely placed too deep, in case of eversion most likely too superficial. Correct by choosing the correct layer placement.\n\tNOTE: Typically, more than one attempt is necessary for optimal positioning. This step is most crucial for the aesthetic outcome of the procedure. Consider that upon smiling, the upper lip shows a remarkable degree of cranial movement indicating the importance of the upper lip sutures.\nOnce satisfied with the position of the suture, cover the very caudal suture for technical facilitation in order to not confuse it with the sutures that will be used for flap fixation. Lock the remaining sutures carefully and leave the needles in place.\nLocate the masseteric motor nerve. Therefore, define a point 3 cm anterior to the tragus and 1 cm inferior the zygomatic arch9.\n\t\nFrom here, start to locate the nerve that is coated by perineurium and appears with a yellowish aspect. At the posterior margin of the masseteric muscle, the nerve “points” at the oral commissure and forms an angle of 50° with the zygomatic arch. Dissect the masseter bluntly parallel to its fibers using fine scissors and try not to stretch the nerve.\nFor easier access, dissect the origin of the masseter muscle from the zygomatic arch.\nNext, dissect downward to the undersurface of the muscle. Apply a nerve stimulator as this is extremely helpful to not confuse the nerve with other structures. Use a unipolar electrical probe attached to a stimulator source that allows variable voltage and frequency control.",
    "Once identified, trace the nerve into the muscle and remove fibrous connections.\n\tNOTE: The nerve will begin to divide into numerous branches after a 1 cm intramuscular course.\nStrip the nerve as distal as possible and flip it over to lie at a superficial level for microsurgical coaptation.\n\tNOTE: At this point the face is fully prepared for the muscle transplant.\n3. Flap Harvest\nNOTE: The gracilis flap is harvested simultaneously with the facial dissection.\nBefore dissection, be aware that gracilis flap harvest for facial reanimation is best achieved in the proximal one-third of the thigh. Focus on this area during dissection.\nStart with an upper medial thigh skin incision of about 10 cm in length at the anterior border of the gracilis. As a landmark, palpate the tendinous origin of the adductor longus muscle in the medial thigh. Apply monopolar electrodissection to go deep.\n\tNOTE: The saphenous vein is encountered first and preserved by medial retraction.\nExpose the adductor fascia and identify the adductor longus and gracilis muscle. The gracilis muscle is located posterior to the adductor longus muscle.\nOnce the gracilis muscle is encountered, locate the neurovascular pedicle first so as to preserve it during preparation. Therefore, spread into the thin fascia between the adductor longus and adductor magnus and identify the neurovascular pedicle here. Subsequently, track the pedicle to the hilum on the deep surface of the gracilis.\nTo locate the neurovascular pedicle, define a distance of approximately 8 to 10 cm from the origin of the muscle to distally as this is the region of the hilum. Alternatively, identify the cutaneous perforator of the muscle that also originates from the hilum.\nDissect the neurovascular pedicle between the gracilis and adductor longus muscle.",
    "Hold the adductor magnus muscle aside and trace the pedicle laterally under the adductor longus muscle.\n\tNOTE: Vascular connections with the adductor longus and brevis are coagulated or ligated, and divided.\nDissect the pedicle proximal to the branches to the adductor longus and apply a vascular loop to the very proximal end of the vascular pedicle.\nIdentify the motor nerve to the gracilis which is an anterior branch of the obturator nerve that enters the muscle 1-2 cm superiorly to the hilum. Retract the adductor longus muscle for easy tracing of the nerve to the obturator foramen to provide maximum length.\nDefine the segment to be harvested. Note that the length of the muscle transplant has to be adapted to each patient individually. The distance from the oral commissure to the tragus plus 2 cm will give the length of the muscle transplant10 as 1 cm on each side of the flap will be needed for flap anchorage.\nPlace the pedicle at the midpoint or slightly distal of the removed muscle segment, as the distal end of the flap will be placed at the oral commissure and the proximal end close to the tragus.\nDissect the muscle circumferentially for a distance of at least 2 cm in excess of the length required using surgical scissors.\nMark the required muscle segment including the vascular hilum in the middle of the segment. Do not completely dissect the vascular pedicle from the nerve as this may harm the vessels.\nIn order to reduce the muscle bulk, harvest about 30% of the circumference of the muscle. Ideally separate an anterior and posterior muscle segment that is not included with the pedicle. Apply the nerve stimulation to confirm the integrity of the separated segment. Strong contraction should be visible.",
    "Carefully divide the vessels at, or near their origin, using micro ligation clips and remove the muscle segment.\nAchieve hemostasis using the bipolar cautery and irrigate the operative site thoroughly by using sterile saline solution (250 ml).\nPosition a Redon-drain through a stab incision to prevent postoperative hematoma or seroma formation.\nClose the wound with interrupted resorbable subcutaneous sutures (2-0) and an intracutaneous Polypropylene suture (2-0).\nFor ex vivo preparation of the muscle flap, place the gracilis segment on a separate operating table and thoroughly rinse the artery with diluted heparin solution (4-5 ml, 10 units/ ml) in order to prevent intravascular thrombus formation.\nCheck the motor nerve for integrity by application of the nerve stimulator. Strong contraction of the muscle has to be apparent. Rinse the isolated muscle flap frequently with sterile saline solution to prevent drying out of the tissue.\nInsert the distal end of the muscle into the nasolabial crease. To prevent rupture, place non-resorbable mattress sutures or alternatively a continuous suture along the distal end (3-0 Polypropylene). These sutures will provide stability for the anchor- sutures.\n\tNOTE: These sutures can also be placed at the temporal end, however are not as crucial as at the oral end of the muscle.\n4. Flap Insertion\nSuture the anchor-sutures that have been placed in the mouth through the muscle in an interlocking fashion so that they overlap the distally placed continuous suture of the muscle.\nSuture guided, cautiously insert the flap into the facial cavity by two surgeons. Stretch one and arrange the anchor sutures while the other surgeon inserts the flap. Remove the needles afterwards and tie the sutures tightly in order to prevent secondary release.",
    "Have the nursing staff move in the operating microscope. Bring the clamped ends of the facial artery and vein in an adequate position for revascularization by using micro scissors.\nAdjust the pedicle of the gracilis muscle. Usually, anastomose the larger of the two veins to the facial vein under the operating microscope.\nPlace a piece of a penrose drain underneath the vessel ends to increase the contrast and to hold back excessive tissue.\nStart vascular repair with the artery and carefully bring the vessel ends together.\n\tNOTE: Stress-free adjustment is indispensable to prevent thrombus formation.\nUse diluted heparin solution (5 ml; 10 units/ml in saline solution) to flush the lumen of the vessels. This will give an idea of the quality of the intima as endothelial damage will become visible. If necessary, trim back the vessel end to remove damaged endothelium. Remove excessive adventitia meticulously.\nUse interrupted 9-0 Nylon sutures to adjust the front side of the artery first and then turn the vessel ends 180° to complete the anastomosis on the rear side. Make sure to not penetrate the front and back side with one suture by repeated inspection of the vessel lumen.\nContinue with the venous anastomosis that can be more demanding. Venous vessel walls are much thinner and, unlike the artery, tend to collapse shortly after rinsing. Use interrupted 9-0 Nylon sutures for the venous anastomosis.\nUpon release of the clamps pulsation of the artery and venous charge should be visible. In order to check for adequate refill of the vein, use two pairs of microsurgical tweezers to obliterate a section of the vein distal to the anastomosis. Then open the proximal tweezers to observe the rate of recharge in order to exclude false positive retrograde refill.",
    "Apply an implantable Doppler probe for monitoring of the flap against the draining vein. Therefore, trim the silicone cuff to fit the probe loosely around the vein. Afterwards, secure the cuff with Nylon sutures (9-0)11. Avoid constriction of the vein as this may promote thrombus formation.\nLead the Doppler cable out of the wound and connect it with the control box. A smooth venous noise should be audible. In case of arterial pulsation, try to relocate the cuff away from the artery.\nTurn the attention to the nerve repair. Adjust the length of the motor nerve of the gracilis to the minimum that is required for tension free coaptation. At this stage, extend the muscle to its temporal fixation point to test which neural pedicle length is necessary once the muscle is completely extended. Any excessive length will needlessly extend time to reinnervation.\n\t\nUse high-power magnification for coaptation with interrupted 9-0 Nylon sutures in epineural fashion. Consecutively apply fibrin glue that will give additional stability to the coaptation site.\nClose the muscle fascia of the masseter afterwards using absorbable sutures (3-0) in order to deliver some degree of protection to the coaptation site. Avoid suturing the fascia too tight as this may compress the nerve.\nFollowing the neurovascular repairs, secure the muscle origin to the temporal fascia and preauricular fascia with mattress sutures (4-0 Polypropylene). Provide sufficient tension with the muscle flap to produce a lateral movement of the oral commissure. This will ensure maximal movement of the oral commissure once reinnervation occurs. If necessary, distribute the muscle evenly to prevent bulking.\nDivert the pull-out suture at the temporal end of the wound and tie it with sufficient tension over a bolster in order to keep tension off the muscle for the first post-operative week.",
    "Check for any bleeding vessels and perform meticulous hemostasis with the bipolar cautery.\nAfter thorough irrigation of the operative site, position a silicone drain (Jackson-Pratt) through a stab incision to prevent postoperative hematoma formation that might constrain flap perfusion. Alternatively, use a Penrose drain.\nReposition the cheek flap and close the wound with staple sutures in the hair bearing areas and a continuous 5-0 Nylon suture.\nBefore wound closure is completed, apply fibrin glue into the wound cavity for hemostasis and stabilization of the pedicle12.\nFix the Doppler cord with an adhesive bandage and apply antibiotic ointment to the wound. A head bandage may then be applied to cover the preauricular incision area. As the vascular pedicle is located more anteriorly, this will not compromise flap perfusion.\n5. Postoperative Treatment and Follow-up\nPostoperatively, leave the patient in the recovery room for about 4-6 hr and then transfer to the plastic surgery ward. Keep the patient’s body in a slightly elevated position to minimize swelling. Mobilization can be initiated on postoperative day one.\nProvide soft food and prohibit to speak for three days. This prevents loosening of the anchor sutures in the nasolabial crease. Remove the facial drain on postoperative day two and the Redon drain of the medial thigh after output is below 30 ml/24 hr.\nBrief the nursing staff how to handle the Doppler control box and to control the Doppler signal hourly. In case of impairment of blood flow immediate revision surgery is necessary.\nAs discharge can usually be achieved after 5 days, remove facial stitches together with the pull out suture after 7 days. Remove the Doppler probe by pulling it out of the wound 3 weeks after surgery.",
    "NOTE: The muscle usually begins to contract within 3 months postoperatively. Patients often report a “funny feeling” in their cheeks, which is soon followed by active movement of the corner of the mouth and a smile.\nPerform follow-ups 3 and 6 months postoperatively with a thorough examination of the patient. Evaluate the symmetry of oral commissure excursion, symmetry of the cheek volume and identify any synkinesis. Document the presence of a spontaneous smile.\nFinally, take a series of standardized photographs as described in step 1.7 or videography for medical record.\nSubscription Required.
