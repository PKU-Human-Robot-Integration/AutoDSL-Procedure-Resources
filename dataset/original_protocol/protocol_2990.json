    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCell Sample Preparation\nTiming: 2–3 days\nIn this step, sample staining and pretreatment for different scenarios are described in details. For best quantitative results, prepare control samples as described. For HaloRT-based probes, transfect cells with the appropriate plasmid is required.\nCell Transfection (for HaloRT-Based Experiment Only)\nTiming: 2–3 days\nSeed the cells 24 h before transfection at desired density in an appropriate container (2.0×106 cells per sample in a glass-bottom dish for imaging; 1.0×105 cells per well in a 12-well plate for flow cytometry).\nTransfect cells with desired HaloTag plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent or other suitable reagents (e.g., for nuclear GSH measurement, use Halo-NLS plasmid for transfection, 500 ng DNA per glass-bottom dish/per well in a 12-well plate). Culture the cells for 24–48 h.\nAlternatives: a stable cell line expressing desired HaloTag protein can be generated.\nDrug Treatment\nTiming: 1 min to 3 days\nFor GSH synthase inhibitor BSO treatment, add the appropriate amount of BSO to the cell culture medium while seeding the cells. Culture for 48–72 h. Cysteine free culture medium should be adopted for cell culture and for the following measurements.\nNote: BSO will partially affect cell growth when the seeding density is low. To best maintain the viability of cells, use a higher seeding density.\nNote: BSO treatment will take 72 h to reach the maximum effect. BSO Treatment for 24 h and 48 h will result in approximately 70% and 90% of the maximum effect, respectively.",
    "Note: The efficacy of BSO to reduce intracellular GSH levels is highly cell type dependent. Typically drug resistant cancer cells require much higher doses of BSO compared with other cells. To select the best BSO concentration range, pilot experiments are recommended. A starting concentration range of 50–100 μM BSO can be tested in most cultured cells.\nFor short term drug treatment, add the desired compounds to the culture medium and incubate as instructed by the distributor. Typically, 10–100 μM NMM/DEM can reduce GSH concentration by 50% or more in 30–60 min.\nFor monitoring GSH changes during transient compound treatment such as H2O2 or NMM, add the drugs to the sample while acquiring signals or just prior to signal acquisition.\nNote: To minimize changes to the culture environment, it is advised to add the drug at a relatively high concentration, e.g., 100× or 10×. It is also advised to avoid directly adding DMSO containing stock solution into water phase during signal acquisition as the release of heat from solvent mixing may instantly kill the cells and create artifacts.\nNote: Some cells are highly capable of defending against external stimulants. In this case, the changes of the GSH concentrations may be subtle, or the changes may be reversed within a short period of time. Thus, real-time imaging can be advantageous over other signal acquisition methods for recording such transient events.\nCell Staining\nTiming: 8–60 min per sample\nReplace cell culture medium with working solution containing RT-AM/MitoRT/HaloRT ligand. For adherent cells, this step could be done through aspiration of culture medium and then addition of the working solution; for non-adherent cells, a centrifugation step is required before removing the culture medium, and a resuspension step after addition of working solution.",
    "For flow cytometry experiments, all cells need to be in single-cell suspension prior to staining. For adherent cells, use trypsin to digest cells and resuspend into fresh culture medium. The staining process follows the non-adherent cell staining protocol with centrifugation and resuspension steps.\nIncubate the cells in the working solution for 8–10 min at 18°C–25°C for RT-AM stained cells; 15–30 min at 37°C for MitoRT and HaloRT ligand stained cells. Alternatively, longer incubation (30–60 min) at room temperature for MitoRT and HaloRT ligand stained cells may be used in cases where heating devices are unavailable.\nCritical: Temperature of staining will influence the distribution homogeneity of RT-based probes. Generally, a lower temperature will induce less aggregation or clearance of probe thus lead to more homogeneous probe loading. For organelle targeting probes, the targeting mechanism will lock desired probes in place with the protein, a higher loading temperature will facilitate clearing of non-specific probes in undesired organelles.\nFor non-adherent cells (including polystyrene bead-based calibration), place 10 μL of suspension containing stained cells onto a coated glass slides, and then cover with cover glass. The sample is then ready for imaging.\nNote: The sample may dry out in 15 min, please mind the timing. Alternatively, seal the sample with a specific O-ring to prevent drying.\nCritical: Washing steps should be generally avoided for RT-AM and MitoRT stained cells when confocal imaging is used for signal acquisition because confocal imaging can easily distinguish between intracellular signal and excess fluorophore in solution and a washing step may induce additional stress to cells.",
    "Note: Washing step will influence cell state and lead to rapid changes in cytosolic redox conditions. We have observed 20% GSH concentration fluctuation due to washing. This is especially important for imaging experiment because 1) sampling in typically limited in confocal imaging experiment; 2) imaging experiment is typically designed for capturing fast yet subtle changes compared to other type of experiments thus imaging is more prone to such bias.\nWash cells with fresh culture medium in HaloRT ligand stained cells, and incubate cells at 37°C for 15–30 min. The washing step can be repeated one more time if signal to noise is still not optimal after one washing step. For confocal imaging experiments, the washing step may be skipped if the signal to noise is above 5.\nNote: HaloRT ligand require long incubation for cells to clear non-specific binding of probes. The signal is also retained better than chemical targeting and thus allow possible longer recovery time to overcome the fluctuation caused by washing.\nWash cells with fresh culture medium can be skipped for flow cytometry experiments. If the signal to noise is below 5, washing steps may help.\nSignal Acquisition\nTiming: 2–15 min per sample\nIn this step, quantitative fluorescent signal acquisition of individual samples using confocal microscope or flow cytometer are described. Signal acquisition steps should immediately follow staining steps for each sample. Generally, avoid staining and measuring in batches as GSH and the probes are highly dynamic, and that staining relies on fast reversible chemical reactions.\nConfocal Imaging\nTiming: 5–15 min per sample",
    "Use sequential imaging on two channels. Use line-switching mode when possible, especially for imaging within smaller organelles such as mitochondria. Z-stack is generally not advised due to the slow speed. Alternatively, if sequential imaging is not available or too slow, a more complicated calculation should be performed when processing the data. Keep the imaging conditions exactly the same as the conditions used for the calibration curve when absolute quantification is needed.\nNote: Generally, ratio between signals from blue and green channels is linear to the GSH concentration. However, if the imaging condition is not ideal, the linearity will not hold and thus a complex ratio (R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R) should be used, where R is the measured ratio, Rmax is the ratio with maximum signal (need 50 mM or higher of GSH for measurement), Rmin is the ratio with minimum signal (need 0.5 mM or lower combined GSH, cysteine, and other thiols for measurement).\nFor RT-AM based global GSH quantification in live cells, we advise a short imaging time due to the relatively fast probe clearance especially in cancer cell lines. In cases when long monitoring is needed, ensure applying an appropriate non-treated, stained cell sample as a control. Alternatively, the HaloRT strategy can be applied for long-term monitoring experiments.\nFor MitoRT based mitochondria GSH (mGSH) quantification in live cells, a higher magnification may be needed. Some super-resolution imaging method (such as stimulated emission depletion super-resolution imaging or airy- scan) may be used, but the quantification may be compromised.\nFor HaloRT-based organelle-specific GSH quantification in live cells, the imaging time can be extended.\nCritical: Stain the next sample while waiting for imaging to complete. Keep staining time the same for each sample.",
    "For quantification or semi-quantification purpose, please refer to the calibration section for details about creating standard curve for calibration; for qualitative assessment of samples, standard curve can be skipped.\nNote: Please keep laser intensity low to avoid light toxicity and fluorophore bleaching.\nNote: Please have an appropriate probe only control for live monitoring experiments to test the probe clearance speed in your cells of interest.\nNote: Trypan blue can be used to quench cell surface non-specific stain in cases where cell surface fluorescence is high and the signal to noise is below 5. For quality purpose, signal to noise ratio of 2 is considered low and signal to noise above 6 is considered high. Please refer to Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for additional information regarding abnormal imaging results.\nFlow Cytometry\nTiming: 2–5 min per sample\nTypically, cells are dispersed into single-cell suspension (500 μL in a 5 mL polystyrene tube) and brought to the flow cytometer prior to staining.\nCritical: The cells are then stained on-site by adding the probe (5 μL staining solution), vortex, and incubate for required time (for RT-AM staining, 8–10 min; for MitoRT and HaloRT staining,15–30 min) and immediately analyzed. Keep staining time the same across all samples to minimize variations.\nThe gain settings should allow signal to noise >3 in both channels for both positive and negative control samples compared with the non-stained control sample.\nIt is advised to acquire signals from at least 10,000 cells per sample with an optimal of 30,000 or more cells.\nFor quantification or semi-quantification purpose, please refer to the calibration section for details about creating standard curve for calibration; for qualitative assessment of samples, standard curve can be skipped.",
    "Note: MitoRT may partially lose organelle targeting ability during single-cell suspension preparation from adherent cells, because part of the mitochondria loses activity and polarity during cell detachment process thus interrupts the charge based chemical targeting mechanism. To confirm, an imaging flow cytometer can be used. Please refer to Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for additional information.\nData Processing: Imaging Data Processing\nTiming: 0.5–2 h\nIn Fiji ImageJ, open the acquired images, duplicate each fluorescence channel into single frames.\nRun background subtraction using the rolling ball algorithm with diameter 100 (depending on the actual images, different background subtraction algorithm can be used).\nRun image calculation and divide the blue channel image by the green channel image to generate a ratio map. Change LUT (lookup table) for favorable visualization, e.g., physics. Save all images as desired.\nMask the ratio map with regions-of-interest when necessary before quantitative analysis, especially in organelle-specific GSH measurements.\nRecord absolute ratio data from individual cells/organelles in all images from the dataset. Manual picking of region of interest may be necessary.\nCompare with standard curve to deduct the absolute GSH concentrations when performing quantification or semi-quantification (please refer to the calibration section for standard curves).\nNote: Please refer to literature for illustration and examples.(Jiang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])\nNote: Image processing in Fiji ImageJ (steps 21–23) can be partially automated by scripts. However, ratio data collection and quantitative analysis still require manual work. Example script can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/jinwanglab/RT-Imaging-Analysis[href=https://github.com/jinwanglab/RT-Imaging-Analysis]\nData Processing: Flow Cytometry Data Processing\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nIn FlowJo, open the data files. Gate by FSC and SSC to define the single-cell population.\nExport the blue and green channel signal in the single-cell population to a .csv file.",
    "Calculate the ratio in each cell by divide signal from the blue channel by that from the green channel. Remove outliers that are 4 standard deviations away from the mean.\nCompare with standard curve to deduct the absolute GSH concentrations when performing quantification or semi-quantification.\nNote: Statistical data analysis from step 29 can be automated by scripts. Example script can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/jinwanglab/RT-FACS-Analysis[href=https://github.com/jinwanglab/RT-FACS-Analysis]\nCalibration against Lysate-Based Assay (Preferred Method)\nTiming: 2–3 days\nPrepare two identical groups of cells by treating with increasing concentrations of BSO (e.g., 0–500 μM for HeLa cells) for 48–72 h. One group of cells should be cultured in a 12-well or 6-well plate for lysate-based assay, the other group of cells should be cultured in the appropriate containers as described above.\nTake the group of cells cultured for lysate-based assay, measure GSH using standard Ellman’s assay(Rahman et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based assay(Jiang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Squellerio et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMeasure the other group of cells using any of the probe with the corresponding protocol described above. Analyze and record ratio value for each sample.\nCompare assay results with ratio and fit with an appropriate function.\nNote: The ratio and GSH concentration may not follow linear relationship depending on the actual experimental conditions. Please refer to the literature(Jiang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for detailed explanation and function deduction in cases where the fitting significantly deviates from linear.\nNote: Even for semi-quantitative/qualitative experiments, it is still recommended to perform this calibration experiment to assess GSH levels based on the ratio readouts.\nCalibration Using Standard Solutions (Only Applicable for Imaging)\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nAdd 15 μm polystyrene beads suspension into RT solution. Typically, add 1 μL of beads per 100 μL of RT solution.",
    "Critical: Prepare fresh GSH stock solution at 200 mM in PBS. Add 1.0 N NaOH solution to adjust pH to 7.4.\nSerial dilute GSH stock solution to desired concentration, for example, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 mM of GSH.\nMix equal amount (typically 4 μL) of GSH with RT solution, incubate at 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nAdd the above solution onto a coverslip, cover with slide glass, and take images. Make sure to pipette the mixture to prevent beads from aggregating into one spot.\nTo measure Rmin, use 0.01 mM of final concentration of GSH; to measure Rmax, use 100 mM final concentration of GSH.\nCalculate the ratio from each group, plot (R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R) against GSH concentration, a linear relationship can be established as a standard curve for comparing results.\nNote: All conditions for calibration should be kept the same with the actual imaging experiments, including objectives, temperature, magnification, Gain/PMT, offset, filter, laser intensity settings.\nNote: This calibration method pairs with the RT-AM based imaging experiments.\nNote: The GSH standard solutions can be oxidized in air. It is advised to perform this experiment as fast as possible or use nitrogen for protection. Always start with the lowest concentration of GSH because it is more prone to oxidation errors.\nNote: This calibration method can also be used for HaloRT-based imaging experiments, in which the RT solution should be replaced with the HaloRT solution (made from recombinant HaloTag protein reaction with the HaloRT ligand).\nNote: This calibration method is not suitable for MitoRT based imaging experiments, possibly because the microenvironment for MitoRT is mitochondria cannot be faithfully simulated using an aqueous solution.\nCell Volume Estimation\nTiming: 5–60 min",
    "The cell volume data can be used to calculate the absolute intracellular GSH concentrations from bulk lysate- based measurements. The data is needed for lysate-based assay calibration purpose.\nPCV Tubes\nTiming: 5–10 min\nPrepare single-cell suspension as described above.\nTransfer 1 mL of cell suspension into a PCV tube.\nSpin multiple samples for 1 min at 2,500 × g in a standard microcentrifuge.\nRecord pellet volume.\nCount the cell number using a hemocytometer.\nCalculate individual cell volume from the cell number and the total volume.\nImaging Measurement\nTiming: 5–10 min\nTake a z-stack image dataset in transmitted light channel.\nMeasure the length, width, and height of the cell in the z-stack image dataset.\nCalculate the average cell volume from multiple datasets.\nProtein Concentration-Based Estimation\nTiming: 60 min\nUse standard bicinchoninic (BCA) assay or other assays to measure the protein concentrations of cells. The cells should be prepared the same way as the calibration group. Other protein quantification methods such as Bradford assays can also be used as long as the dynamic range fits.\nEstimate cell volume using available data on the corresponding protein concentration per unit volume."
