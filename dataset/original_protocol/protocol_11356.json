    "All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). Human specimens (Normal BM and that from CML (p210-BCR-ABL+) leukemia) were obtained through Institutional Review Board-approved protocols (Institutional Review Board: Federalwide Assurance #00002988 Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) and donor-informed consent from CCHMC and the University of Cincinnati.\n1. Real-time qPCR Analysis\nIsolate total RNA from BaF3 cells growing in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% WEHI spent culture medium as a source of interleukin-3 (IL-3).\nHarvest the cells at logarithmic phase (99% alive) from treated (IL-3 and imatinib) as well as from untreated samples, and centrifuge them at 435 x g for 3 min. The health and the growth stages of the cells are critical as their gene expression profiles can change dramatically.\nIsolate RNA by purifying total RNA22. Quantify the total RNA; then, subject it to DNase treatment23. Convert equal amounts of DNA-free RNA (2 µg) to cDNA with reverse transcriptase24.\nPerform qPCRs with the gene-specific primers (Table 1). Carry out PCRs in 20 µL reactions in 0.2 mL, thin-walled PCR tubes with optical caps, using a 1x polymerase mix (see Table of Materials), 0.5 µM of each primer, 1 µL of DNA, and water. Place the reaction in the thermocycler with the following cycle: Step 1, 95 °C for 10 min; Step 2, 95 °C for 15 s; Step 3 at 60 °C for 1 min; Step 4, repeat steps 2–3 40 times. Perform all PCRs in triplicates and normalize the real-time data to the β-actin expression before plotting.\n2. Western Blotting",
    "NOTE: Whole-cell extracts were prepared by adding 250 µL of 1x lysis buffer as described in Kesarwani et al.13 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2.\nHarvest five million BaF3 cells at logarithmic phase (99% alive) from treated (IL-3 and imatinib) as well as from untreated BaF3 cells by centrifugation at 435 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Lyse the cells in the lysis buffer (250 µL) by pipetting up and down 1x, followed by a 5 min incubation at 80 °C. Sonicate the lysate to break down all the DNA with 5–6 pulses of 5 s each in a cold room at 4 °C.\nTransfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge it at 16,000 x g for 5 min to remove any insoluble material. The extract can be stored at -80 °C until use. Heat samples to 80 °C for 5 min in a heat block before loading. Load 10 µL of the sample using a gel-loading tip on 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nResolve the proteins at 150 V until the reference dye reaches the bottom of the gel. Transfer the protein to nitrocellulose membranes by an electrophoretic transfer at 1 amp for 1 h. After the transfer, block the membranes in 1x Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and probe overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies at a 1:1,000 dilution.\nWash the membranes 3x to 5x with TBST for 10 min each; then, probe with an HRP-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The amount of TBST used depends on the container size. Make sure to submerge the membrane in TBST completely. Wash the secondary antibody 3x for 5 min each with TBST.",
    "Develop the blot using chemiluminescent substrate reagent. Mix equal volumes of the substrate and the buffer from the two bottles, right before use. Add the substrate to the top of the membrane to cover the whole membrane with a 1 mL pipette and incubate for 1 min. The blots should be imaged within 1–10 min of adding the substrate.\nUsing blunt forceps, carefully place the membrane on the platform of the imaging system (see Table of Materials), avoiding much of the liquid. Select a live view and choose blots and chemiluminiscence from the menu. Using manual acquisition, acquire multiple exposures at different time points. These files can be visualized and quantified using imaging software.\n3. Generation of Knockout Mice\nCross c-Fosfl/fl mice with ROSACreERT2 mice to generate ROSACreERT2c-Fosfl/fl mice13. To create the double-knockout (KO) mice, breed ROSACreERT2c-Fosfl/fl mice with Dusp1-/- mice to generate ROSACreERT2c-Fosfl/fl Dusp1-/- mice13. Genotype the mice by tail clips followed by PCR, as described below.\nGenotyping:\nTo prepare the DNA, clip a tiny portion of the tail with scissors and put it into a 1.5 mL tube. Cauterize the tail with heated scissors. Add 200 µL of 50 mM NaOH to the clipped tail in the tube and incubate at 95 °C in a heat block for 1 h.\nVortex the tube well and, then, neutralize by adding 50 µL of 1 M Tris HCl pH 6.8 and vortex again. Centrifuge the tube at maximum speed for 1 min.\nCarry out PCRs in 20 µL reactions in 0.2 mL, thin-walled PCR tubes using 1x Taq polymerase master mix containing dye, 0.5 µM of each primer, 1 µL of DNA, and water. Place the tubes in the thermocycler and run the appropriate cycles as shown in Table 2.",
    "Run the PCR product on 2% agarose gel and image using a gel documentation system.\n4. Isolation of c-Kit+ Cells from Bone Marrow\nSacrifice the mice according to institutional guidelines.\nNOTE: Here, the mice were exposed to carbon dioxide (CO2) at an according to the AVMA recommended flow rate until death was determined by the cessation of respiration and heartbeat, followed by cervical dislocation.\nHarvest the legbones from the mouse — two femurs, two tibias, two iliacs. Clean off all tissues from the bones by scraping away with a scalpel. Put the leg bones in cold 1x PBS on ice — 5 mL in a 15 mL tube. Pour the contents of the tube into a mortar and crush it with a pestle.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL screw cap tube with a 10 mL pipette attached, using a pipette. Wash the mortar and pestle multiple times with cold 1x PBS, collecting and adding cell suspension to the 50 mL tube. Spin down bone marrow at 1,200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant via a vacuum with a glass pipette attached. Suspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of 1x PBS with a pipette.\nWith a pipette, slowly add suspended bone marrow to the top of 5 mL of room temperature (the temperature is critical) polysucrose, taking great care not to disturb the interface. Spin at 400 x g at room temperature for 20 min with the brake turned off.",
    "Collect the cloudy total mono-nuclear cell (TMNC) interface with a pipette and put it into a new 15 mL tube. Bring the volume up to 10 mL with 1x PBS for the wash, taking 20 µL for counting, and spin at 1,200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and save the pellet on ice for step 4.6.1.\nPerform c-Kit+ cell isolation.\nFollow a microbead kit protocol for the c-Kit+ cell isolation. Resuspend the cell pellet in 80 µL of 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA to 107 cells. To the cell suspension, add 20 µL of CD117 MicroBeads/107 total cells. Mix well by vortexing and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C. Bring the volume up to 10 mL by adding 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA and spin at 1,200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant via a vacuum and suspend the cell pellet in 500 µL/108 total cells in 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA. Using the magnet stand with the magnetic column attached, add 3 mL of 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA and allow it to flow through via gravity into a 15 mL collection tube.\nOnce the first buffer addition has finished passing through the column, add the cell suspension to the column, allowing it to flow through via gravity into the 15 mL collection tube. This flowthrough is the undesired cell fraction.\nWash the column 3 times with 3 mL 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA each time, allowing it to flow through via gravity into the collection tube. Remove the column from the magnet and place onto the top of a 15 mL tube.",
    "Add 5 mL of 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA and immediately flush it with the plunger provided with the column. Remove the plunger and repeat the flush with an additional 5 mL of 1x PBS + EDTA + BSA. Count the cells in the total volume using standard methods.\nSpin down the cells at 1,200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in complete IMDM (IMDM + 10% FBS + IL-6 [10 ng/mL] + mSCF [50 ng/mL] + FLT3 ligand [20 ng/mL] + IL-3 [10 ng/mL]) for culture. Culture these cells overnight in 2 x 106 cells/1 mL of cell IMDM complete media by placing them in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n5. Transduction\nRetroviral plasmid transfection\nFreshly thaw HEK293 cells the afternoon before in a water bath set to 37 °C. Spin the cryotube containing the HEK cells at 435 x g at room temperature for 3 min. Remove the supernatant via a vacuum and suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine.\nCount the cells and add the appropriate volume to a 10 cm treated dish (~4 x 106 HEK293T cells). Add 14 mL of the DMEM 10 media to the dish and mix it well by sliding up and down for an equal distribution. Place the dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nOn the next morning, check the confluence of the cells under an inverted light microscope (50% or more works well).",
    "Combine the DNA (desired retroviral plasmid), PclEco (packaging plasmid), 2 M CaCl2, and H20 in a 1.5 mL tube (= 500 µL) using a micropipette in the following amounts: 7.5 µg of DNA (BCR-ABL1-YFP), 7.5 µg of pCLeco, 62 µL of 2 M CaCl2, and water to a final volume of 500 µL. Add 500 µL of 2x HBS to another 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd the DNA mix dropwise to the 1.5 mL tube containing 500 µL of 2x HBS (280 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, and 1.5 mM Na2HPO4) while mixing. Achieve this by setting a vortex to the lowest speed and hold the HBS tube on it for constant mixing while adding the transfection mix.\nAllow the transfection mix to incubate for 20–30 min at room temperature. During the incubation, add 25 nM chloroquine to the HEK cells and place them back in the incubator. After the incubation, add the transfection mix dropwise to the HEK cells and, then, gently swirl the media to mix the transfection mix throughout the plate.\nIncubate the cells with the mix for ~8 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Change the media on these cells by very slowly adding 14 mL of fresh DMEM 10 media. Pipetting slowly against the wall of the dish helps to prevent any stripping of the HEK cells. Incubate the cells overnight in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nCollect the viral supernatant with a 10 mL syringe, draw the supernatant into the syringe, and attach the 0.45 µm syringe filter. Plunge the viral supernatant into a new collection tube. Take the first collection of viral supernatant ~16 h later.\nFibronectin viral concentration and transduction",
    "Add 2 mL of a 0.1 mg recombinant human fibronectin fragment in 1x PBS to untreated 6-well culture plates. Prepare as much fibronectin as needed, which depends on the number of cells and genotypes. One well can sufficiently transduce 10 million c-Kit+ cells. Incubate the plate overnight at 4 °C.\nThe next day, remove the fibronectin from the wells with a pipette, pipette 2 mL of sterile 2% BSA in 1x PBS to block the plate, and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Remove the BSA via a vacuum and wash thoroughly by pipetting 2 mL of 1x PBS then remove it via a vacuum.\nImmediately add freshly collected and filtered (at 0.45 µm) viral supernatant up to 5 mL. Centrifuge at 435 x g at 32 °C for 2 h. Remove the supernatant via a vacuum and repeat this step with additional freshly collected viral supernatant and spin again. Remove the supernatant via a vacuum and wash the wells by adding 2 mL of 1x PBS; then, remove it via a vacuum.\nAdd the c-Kit+ mouse cells that were cultured overnight (step 4.6.6) to the viral coated wells by mixing the cell suspensions well and pipetting them into the now viral concentrated fibronectin plate.

Determine the percentage of BCR-ABL1 positive cells by measuring the percentage of YFP positive using flow cytometry.",
    "Acquire events with the standard procedure. First, gate the live cells based on forward and side scatter. Then, gate the YFP positive live cells excluding the YFP-negativecells determined by negative control (Figure 4).\n6. Colony-forming UnitAssays\nThaw the methylcellulose with cytokines for mouse at room temperature for 1–2 h. Aliquot 3 mL of methylcellulose in a FACS tube using a 5 mL syringe without a needle. Sort the YFP-positive cells on a cell sorter.\nSpin the cells down and suspend the pellet in IMDM complete media. Count the cells to be plated and dilute them to obtain 5,000 YFP-positive cells in 100 µL of IMDM complete media.\nAdd 100 µL of the cell suspension containing 5,000 YFP-positive cells and the appropriate inhibitors to 3 mL of methylcellulose (see Table of Materials). Vortex on high to mix it for 10–30 s.\nAfter most of the air bubbles have escaped, use a 1 mL syringe to plate 1 mL of media in three replicate 3 cm plates by ejecting the media on one side and slowly tilting the plate in a circular motion to spread evenly.\nThe final concentration of the inhibitors to use are imatinib at 3 µM, DFC at 0.2 µM, and BCI at 0.5 µM, alone or in combinations. Wherever appropriate, delete c-Fos by plating the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (1 µg/mL) added to the methylcellulose.\nAfter plating, put the plates in a large Petri dish with one open dish containing 2 mL of sterile water in the middle. Cover the large Petri dish and carefully incubate at the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Record the colony numbers after one week of plating by counting the total number of colonies under a microscope.",
    "Analyze a few colonies from appropriate plates for c-Fos deletion by PCR. Collect the colonies by sucking them with a P1000 tip. Dislodge the cells in 500 µL of 1x PBS by washing the tip in the PBS multiple times. Spin the cell suspensions at 6,000 x g for 1 min and extract the DNA from the cell pellet using a genomic DNA isolation kit.\nUse the genomic DNA for PCR using the primers mFos-FP3 and mFos-RP5, as described in Table 2. Analyze the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel and image using a gel documentation system.\nFor a graphic presentation of the colonies, stain the colonies, using Iodonitrotetrazolium chloride. Dissolve 10 mg of the Iodonitrotetrazolium chloride in 10 mL of water to obtain a 1 mg/mL solution. Filter sterilize the solution using a Luer lock with a 0.2 µm filter attached to a 10 mL syringe under sterile conditions in a tissue culture hood.\nIn the tissue culture hood, add 100 µL of staining solution dropwise around the CFU plate; be careful not to slide or disturb colonies. Incubate the plates overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. The colonies will turn dark reddish brown. Using a white background in the sterile tissue culture hood, take photos of the stained CFU plate.\n7.

    "Block the cells with human FcR block and mouse FcR block followed by staining with anti-human CD45 FITC and anti-mouse CD45 APCCy7 overnight at 4 °C. Perform the FACS analysis on LSRII and analyze the data using flow cytometry analysis software.\nGroup the mice into four different cohorts (n = 6/group) for the treatment with vehicle, imatinib (75 mg/kg), DFC + BCI (both at 10 mg/kg), or imatinib (75 mg/kg) + DFC + BCI (both at 10 mg/kg). Dilute the stock drugs in 1x PBS (vehicle) and administer them by injecting them i.p. 2x daily.\nTreat the mice for six weeks and determine the leukemic burden every two weeks, until week eight after the transplantation as described above in 11.4.\nSubscription Required.
