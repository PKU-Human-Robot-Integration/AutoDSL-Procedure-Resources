    "All methods and procedures described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Tulane University School of Medicine.\n1. Tools and instruments for AAB model creation\nObtain disinfectants, such as 70% isopropyl alcohol and povidone-iodine.\nObtain ketamine and xylazine for anesthesia and buprenorphine for analgesia.\nObtain a heating pad and heavy absorbency disposable underpad with the dimensions of 18 inches x 30 inches.\nObtain a 100% cotton twine roll, a tape and a hair clipper.\nObtain a 20 cm x 25 cm plastic board, thickness range between 3-5 mm.\nObtain a Z-LITE fiber optic illuminator.\nObtain a mechanical ventilator for small animals (e.g., SAR-830/AP).\nObtain 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl taper sutures and nylon 3-0 monofilament suture, sterile gauze pads and sterile extra large cotton tips and sterile gloves.\nObtain 16 G angiocath for intubation.\nPurchase the following surgical tools.\n\t\nObtain a Weck stainless steel Hemoclip ligation and stainless-steel ligating clips.\nObtain hardened fine iris scissors.\nObtain Adson forceps.\nObtain two curved Graefe forceps.\nObtain a Halsted-Mosquito Hemostats-straight forceps.\nObtain a Mayo-Hegar needle holder.\nObtain an Alm chest retractor with blunt teeth.\nUtilize and obtain an autoclave and a bead sterilizer.\n2. Ascending aortic banding surgical procedure\nAnesthetize the animal with an intraperitoneal injection of a mix of 75-100 mg/kg Ketamine and 10 mg/kg Xylazine.\n\tNOTE: Allow a few minutes for the animal to be completely sedated and flaccid. If the anesthetic dose is not sufficient and the animal is still moving in the cage, re-inject the animal with the same anesthetic dose after allowing enough time, around 5-10 minutes between subsequent injections. Most animals require 1-2 injections to achieve deep sedation and anesthesia.\nShave the hair on the surgical site located at the right lateral thoracic area under the right armpit.",
    "Stabilize the animal by gently taping all four limbs to the plastic board. Then perform endotracheal intubation with a 16 G angiocath. After the animal is successfully intubated, initiate mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 2 mL at 50 cycles/min and FiO2 of 21%. Look for the symmetrical rise in chest wall with each breath.\nTurn the animal slowly to lie on its left lateral side, and then bend the tail in a U-shape manner and stabilize it by gently taping it to the plastic board. Then go ahead and disinfect the shaved area with topical application of povidone-iodine. \nInfiltrate the skin at the incision site with 50/50 mix by volume of 1-2% Lidocaine/0.25-0.5 % Bupivacaine as preemptive analgesia before making the incision.\nPerform a right horizontal skin incision, 1-2 centimeters long, in the right axillary area 1 cm below the right armpit. Then, dissect the thoracic muscular layer until reaching the thoracic rib cage. Make a 1 cm thoracotomy between the 2nd and 3rd rib cage.\n\t\nWhile dissecting the muscular layer of the chest, be careful and avoid injury of the right axillary artery, which runs underneath the right armpit.\n\t\tNOTE: Thoracotomy performed between the 1st and the 2nd rib carries the risk of banding the right brachiocephalic artery instead of the ascending aorta. Thoracotomy between the 3rd and the fourth rib makes it hard to visualize and band the ascending aorta, as the operator will be looking at the right atrium.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid extending the thoracotomy too medially towards the sternum to avoid dissecting and injuring the right internal mammary artery.\nDissect the two lobes of the thymus gland gently and push them apart on the side. Then identify the ascending aorta and isolate it from the superior vena cava by blunt dissection via a curved Graefe forceps.",
    "NOTE: Significant manipulation of the thymus gland will render it swollen and makes it hard to visualize the ascending aorta.\n\t\nDissect the superior vena cava from the aorta with extra caution to avoid injury or rupture of the superior vena cava, which is fatal. This may be the trickiest part of the procedure and is expected to happen from time to time even in most experienced hands, but often with beginners and learners.\nLift gently the ascending aorta with a curved Graefe forceps and place the vascular clip around the ascending aorta.\n\t\nAdjust the vascular hemoclip ligation tool via a plastic pre-cut 7\" piece to obtain a vascular clip of the desired internal area of 1.5 mm2 or 2 mm2, depending on which HF model is desired.\nSuture the thorax via a Vicryl 2-0 monofilament suture. Then suture the muscular layer of the chest via a 3-0 Vicryl taper suture. Then suture the skin incision via a Nylon 3-0 monofilament suture.\nAdminister a combination of the following drugs after completion of the surgery for 48-72 hrs to serve as analgesia in the post-operative period: 1) Buprenorphine 0.01-0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously every 8-12h, 2) Meloxicam 2 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12h, and 3) Morphine 2.5 mg/kg subcutaneously every 2-4h as needed for severe pain.\n\tNOTE: Leave the animal to recover on a heating pad under regular monitoring. Once the animal shows signs of recovery from anesthesia (able to breath spontaneously - without evidence of gasping or use of accessory muscles for more than two minutes - and has good reflexes, red and warm extremities), extubate the animal and return it to the cage.\n3. Echocardiography\nSedate the animal with intraperitoneal injection of 80-100 mg/kg ketamine. Ensure adequate sedation for proper acquisition of good quality echo images.",
    "NOTE: The use of isoflurane as an anesthetic is discouraged for its cardiodepressor effect, especially in the setting of severe pressure overload and might give a false impression of LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction that resolves once animal is off anesthetic.\n\t\nBe cautious and administer half or even one third of the dose of ketamine in animals that look dyspneic and tachypneic with suspicion that they have developed the HFrEF phenotype.\nShave the hair of the chest, anteriorly, in the completely sedated animal.\nLay the animal on its back and stabilize it to the plastic board.\nAcquire 2D parasternal long axis and 2D parasternal short axis view clips at the level of the papillary muscle. Also, obtain M-mode images from the short parasternal axis view at the level of the papillary muscle to measure LV septal and posterior wall thickness in diastole as well as LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter.\n\t\nAcquire images or clips at a heart rate of 370 - 420 beats per minute to ensure proper assessment of LV size and function. Acquisition of images at lower heart rates will lead to a false impression of depressed LV function and LV dilatation.\n\t\tNOTE: Acquisition of foreshortened 2D long parasternal axis view images/clips lead to false measurements. For quality control purposes, make sure that the LV apex and the aorto-mitral angle are visualized within the same plane cut.\nAcquire 2D short parasternal axis view images/clips at the level of the mid papillary muscle. This will serve as a reference to obtain reliable serial and subsequent LV measurements while following the animals over time throughout the study period.\nObtain M-mode images in long parasternal axis view at the level of the aortic valve to assess the relative aortic to left atrium (LA) diameter at end systole.",
    "NOTE: Animals with the MOD and HFrEF phenotypes should show evidence of LA dilatation with LA/Ao ratio being ≥1.25 and <1.5 in MOD HF phenotype and ≥1.5 in the HFrEF phenotype10.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
