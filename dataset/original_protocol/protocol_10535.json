    "1. Phage Production\nPerform all phage production and biopanning processes in a biosafety cabinet. Produce phages particles from the different libraries (Tomlinson I and J libraries and Sheets library21) for the biopanning process using the manufacturer’s instructions (http://www.lifesciences.sourcebioscience.com/media/143421/tomlinsonij.pdf).\n\tNOTE: We use multiple libraries in our panning process to increase the diversity of the antibodies available.\nBriefly, culture bacteria stocks of the three libraries in 200 ml of 2xYT containing 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml of ampicillin on a shaker at 37 °C until OD600 is 0.4.\nAdd 8 x 1011 of KM13 helper phage to 200 ml of the Tomlinson I and J libraries and 8 x 1011 of VCSM13 helper phage to 200 ml of the Sheets library. Incubate library samples with helper phage for 30 min at 37 °C without shaking.\nCentrifuge the cultures at 3,000 x g for 10 min and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 ml of 2xYT with 0.1% glucose, 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 50 μg/ml of kanamycin.\nIncubate the cultures O/N at 30 °C with shaking and then spin for 30 min at 3,300 x g the following day.\nAdd 50 ml of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 in 2.5 M NaCl to the 200 ml of supernatant from each of the libraries and incubate on ice for 1 hr. After PEG precipitation, spin the solutions again for 30 min at 3,300 x g.\nAdd 1-2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the cell pellet (depending on the size of the pellet) and transfer to microcentrifuge tubes.\nIncubate phage particles on ice for 1 hr at 37 °C with occasional mixing before centrifuging for 10 min at 11,600 x g. Collect the supernatant and store at -80 °C.",
    "Before freezing, transfer a small volume of the phage particles from the three libraries to another microcentrifuge tube and titer each library individually using TG1 cells to determine concentration. Below is a description of the titer process for one library.\n\t\nGrow TG1 cells to OD600 of 0.4. Add 990 μl of PBS to 6 microcentrifuge tubes.\nTo the first tube add 10 μl of the phage particles. After mixing, remove 10 μl from tube one and add to tube 2. Repeat this step for the remaining 4 tubes.\nAdd 200 μl of TG1 cells to 6 tubes and add 10 μl of each of the six phage dilutions to these tubes. Allow the phage particles to infect for 30 min with no shaking at 37 °C.\nPlate 100 μl of the cells unto Luria-Bertani agar plates with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin (LBA). Incubate O/N at 37 °C and then determine the pfu/ml using the number of visible colonies.\n2. Negative Biopanning Process\nNOTE: Avoid too many freeze thaw of the phages throughout the biopanning process. Ideally, it is best to carry out as many of the negative panning steps as possible in a day. After the completion of the rounds of negative or positive panning against each target it is important to save some of the phage in case of contamination at any step.\n12 Rounds of Negative Panning against Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)\n\t\nAdd 4 ml of 1 mg/ml BSA solution in PBS to 12 immunotubes and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nCombine 1 x 1012 phage particles from each of the three libraries (set aside a small quantity of this phage mixture for future verification of the negative panning process).",
    "Discard the BSA solution from the first tube and wash the tube 2-3 times with PBS to remove any unbound BSA.\nAdd the combined phage libraries to this first tube, incubate for 30 min at RT on the rotator and collect the unbound phages.\nRepeat step 2.1.3 with the second immunotube and add the phage collected from step 2.1.4 to this immunotube. Repeat step 2.1.4.\nRepeat steps 2.1.3-2.1.4 with the remaining 10 tubes of BSA solution and the unbound phage collected after each incubation.\nTo verify removal of all BSA phage binders use AFM. Add 10 μl of the phage from step 2.1.2 and 10 μl of the remaining phage after step 2.1.7 separately to 10 μg/ml of BSA bound to cleaved mica. A brief version of the AFM process is outlined in section 8.\nIt is important to save a small quantity of phage after finishing the numerous rounds of negative panning against each target to verify success of the panning process.\n10 Rounds of Negative Panning against Various Forms of Alpha-synucleinNOTE: In this project, we want to remove phage that could bind other aggregated forms of proteins such as alpha-synuclein (monomer, dimer, trimer, etc.) and so we will eliminate any of these phages (the goal is to eliminate as many cross-reactive phages as possible). Allow purified alpha-synuclein to aggregate for at least 7 days so that both monomeric and oligomeric forms are present for negative panning.\n\t\nPrepare 4 immunotubes with 500 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein in PBS and 4 immunotubes with 100 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nDiscard the solution from one of the tubes with 500 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein, wash with PBS and add the phage library collected after the 12 rounds of negative panning with BSA.",
    "Incubate the tube for 30 min at RT on the rotator and collect the unbound phages.\nRepeat steps 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 for the remaining tubes with 500 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein and then the tubes with 100 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein using the unbound phage collected each time after step 2.2.4.\nRepeat step 2.1.8 using the phage after the first of negative panning against 500 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein and the phage after the eighth round of negative panning against 100 μg/ml of alpha-synuclein.\nTo eliminate all negative binders against alpha-synuclein prepare two extra immunotubes with 500 μg/ml of aggregated alpha-synuclein and repeat steps 2.2.2-2.2.4.\n10 Rounds of Negative Panning against Healthy Human Brain Tissue Homogenate\n\t\nAdd 1x STEN buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% NP-40, 0.2% BSA, 20 mM PMSF and protease cocktail inhibitor) to human brain tissue28. Homogenize at 24,000 rpm for 1 min, centrifuge samples at 3,000 rpm and collect supernatant.\nPrepare 2 immunotubes with 2 ml of 50 μg/ml of human brain tissue in PBS and 8 immunotubes with 10 μg/ml of human brain tissue and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nRepeat steps 2.2.3-2.2.5 first with the tubes containing 50 μg/ml of human brain tissue and then with those containing 10 μg/ml of human brain tissue using the unbound phage collected after the negative panning against alpha-synuclein.\nRepeat step 2.1.8 using the phage after the first of negative panning against 50 μg/ml of human brain tissue and the phage after the tenth round of negative panning against human brain tissue.\n8 Rounds of Negative Panning against Healthy Immunoprecipitated TDP-43",
    "Immunoprecipitate healthy TDP-43 protein from healthy human brain tissue using the protocol described in section 9. Due to lower quantity of immunoprecipitated protein, carry out these rounds of negative panning using mica.\nCleave eight mica surfaces.\nTo the first mica add ~100 μl of 5 μg/ml of the immunoprecipitated protein and incubate for 5-10 min at RT.\nWash the mica 5 times with 0.1% PBS with Tween 20 (PBST).\nAdd ~100 μl of the phage after the negative panning against healthy brain tissue and incubate for 5-10 min at RT.\nAt midway incubation of step 2.4.5, carry out step 2.4.3 using the second mica.\nCollect the phage from step 2.4.5 and wash the mica 5 times with 0.1% PBST.\nWash mica from step 2.4.6 and add the phage from 2.4.7.\nRepeat steps 2.4.4 to 2.4.9 until the phage is negatively panned against all eight mica with the immunoprecipitated protein. Repeat step 2.1.7 using the phage after the first and eight round of negative panning.\n2 Rounds of Negative Panning Against FTD Immunoprecipitated TDP-43\n\t\nImmunoprecipitate TDP-43 protein from the brains of individuals with FTD.\nCleave 2 mica surfaces.\nAdd 50 μl of 10 μg/ml of FTD TDP-43 to one mica. Incubate for 5 min at RT.\nWash the mica 5 times with 0.1% PBST.\nAdd 50 μl of the phage collected after negative panning against healthy TDP-43. Incubate for 5 min.\nCollect the unbound phages.\nRepeats steps 2.5.3 to 2.5.6 with the second mica and the unbound phage collected in 2.5.6.\n3. Positive Panning against Immunoprecipitated TDP-43 from Individuals with ALS\nImmunoprecipitate TDP-43 protein from the brains of individuals with ALS. Cleave 3 mica surfaces. Add 50 μl of 10 μg/ml of ALS TDP-43 to one mica. Incubate for 5 min at RT. Wash the mica 5 times with 0.1% PBST.",
    "Add 50 μl of the phage collected after negative panning against healthy TDP-43 to the mica. Incubate for 5 min.\nCollect the unbound phages. Also collect the bound phages using three elution methods. It is important to keep all collected phages in these panning steps separate.\n\t\nFirst, add 50 μl of trypsin (1 mg/ml in PBS) to each mica and incubate for no more than 10 min. Collect the solution and save. Next, add 50 μl of 100 mM triethylamine (TEA) to each mica and incubate for no more than 10 min. Collect the solution, add equal volume of 1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 and save.\nThird, add 50 μl of TG1 at OD600 of 0.4 directly to the mica and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Also add the phages collected from the two elution methods in 3.3.1 to 100 μl of TG1 at OD600 of 0.4 and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nRepeat steps 3.1 with a second mica.\nTake the unbound phage collected in 3.3.2. using the first mica with ALS TDP-43 and add it to the second mica with ALS TDP-43. Incubate for 5 min.\nRepeat all the steps in 3.3 for these second sets of mica.\nCombine the TG1 cells infected with the phages eluted with trypsin from the two ALS TDP-43 mica and plate on LBA plates. Repeat the same process for the TEA and TG1 eluted phages from the two ALS TDP-43 mica for a total of three plates.",
    "NOTE: Because of TDP-43’s involvement in both ALS and FTD, some of the clones isolated in the two rounds of positive panning against ALS TDP-43 may be specific to this target, but some may also bind FTD. To better isolate ALS specific clones, take the unbound phage collected after 2 rounds of negative panning against FTD TDP-43 (since these two rounds of negative panning should have removed any target that is reactive to FTD TDP-43) and use these phages in one more round of positive panning against the ALS TDP-43 antigen on mica (prepare the ALS TDP-43 mica as described above in 3.3 and 3.4).\nRepeat all the steps in 3.3 with this third ALS mica and plate the infected TG1 cells on three LBA plates O/N at 37 °C. The next day count the number of colonies on the 6 LBA plates with the potential ALS clones. There should be fewer colonies on the three LBA plates with the potential ALS clones after the third round of positive panning compared to the three LBA plates after the two rounds of positive panning.\n4. Culturing and Phage Production of Potential Positive Clones against ALS Specific TDP-43\nGrow each colony from the 6 plates in 96-well plates containing 100 μl of 2xYT with 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml of ampicillin on a shaker at 37 °C O/N.\nThe next day transfer 10 μl from the wells containing the clones from the 3 LBA plates after the third round of positive panning with the ALS TDP-43 protein to microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of 2xYT with 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml of ampicillin.",
    "Add glycerol to all the cultures in the 96-well plates to a final concentration of 15% and freeze the plates at -80 °C. Allow the 1 ml cultures to grow for 2-3 hr shaking at 37 °C.\nAdd 109 of KM13 helper phage and allow the helper phage to infect for 1 hr at 37 °C with shaking. Centrifuge the cells for 10 min at 3,000 x g, discard the supernatant and add 1 ml of 2xYT with 0.1% glucose, 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 50 μg/ml of kanamycin.\nCulture the cells O/N at 30 °C with shaking. Centrifuge the tubes at 3,300 x g for 30 min, transfer the supernatant to new microcentrifuge tubes and add 250 μl PEG/NaCl to each tube.\nIncubate the tubes on ice for 1 hr. Centrifuge the tubes again at 3,300 x g for 30 min, discard the supernatant and add 100 μl of PBS to each tube.\nIncubate the tubes on ice for 1 hr. Spin the tubes for 10 min at 11,600 x g and transfer the supernatant to new tubes. Store the phages at -80 °C.\n5. Sequencing of Potential ALS Clones\nRepeat step 4.2 and allow to cultures to grow O/N at 37 °C with shaking. The next day carry out DNA plasmid preps of the clones according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequence the clones using the appropriate forward and reverse primers.\n6. Screening Potential Positive Clones against ALS Specific TDP-43 Using Indirect ELISA\nAdd 100 μl of 2.5 μg/ml of ALS, FTD and healthy human brain tissue to the wells of a high binding ELISA plate for each potential ALS clone. Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 1 hr with slow shaking.",
    "Wash the plates 3 times with 0.1% PBST. Add 200 μl of 2% milk powder in PBS to the well and incubate the plates at 37 °C for 1 hr with slow shaking.\nRepeat the wash step and then add 100 μl of each phage diluted at least 1/100 in PBS to the wells. After the incubation and wash steps, add 100 μl of 1/1,000 anti-M13 HRP to each well. Wash the plates and visualize using the ELISA femto chemiluminescence substrate kit.\n7. scFv Production and Screening Using Indirect ELISA\nGrow HB 2151 cells to OD600 of 0.4. Add 5 μl of the different phages to 20 μl of the HB 2151 cells. Allow the phages 30 min to infect at 37 °C without shaking. Divide LBA plates into grids so that approximately 20 clones can be plated on each.\nAdd 5-10 μl of each phage infected bacteria to the plate and incubate O/N at 37 °C. The next day add individual colonies to 1 ml of 2xYT with 0.1% glucose and 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and shake at 37 °C for 3-4 hr until OD600 is 0.6.\nAdd 1 μl of 1 M isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) to each tube and incubate O/N at 30 °C with shaking. Spin the tubes at 11,600 x g for 10 min and harvest the supernatant for ELISA testing.\nFor the ELISA testing follow the same procedures in section 6, except instead of phage in 6.5 add the scFv undiluted and for 6.6 add 100 μl of 1/1,000 9e10 HRP.\n8. AFM Process\nAdd 10-20 μl of the target antigen to cleaved mica and incubate for 5-10 min. Wash the mica 5 times with water. Add 10-20 μl of the phages to the mica and incubate for 5-10 min.",
    "Wash the mica 5 times again with water and allow the mica to air dry. Visualize phage binding using AFM1. Execute the AFM imaging process using AFM tapping mode with a Nanoscope IIIa controller in air at RT29. The silicon AFM probes have a resonant frequency of 300 kHz and a spring constant of 40 N/m. Use a scan rate of 3.05 Hz and a scan resolution of 512 samples/line.\nProcess the images by basic flattening of the background to ensure that all particle sizes are comparable within each image. Phage width (not length) may vary from image to image due to other particle sizes and the scanning area, but it will never compromise the accuracy of whether or not phage binds to the antigen.\nIf during AFM verification for each set of negative panning phages are visible on the mica, perform addition rounds until no phages are detected before proceeding to the next set of negative panning.\n9. Immunoprecipitation of Target Antigen\nTo isolate the target antigen (TDP-43), add 250 μg of homogenize brain tissue (from motor cortex), 100 μl of 1/100 dilution of the anti-TDP 43 polyclonal antibody and 1x STEN buffer to 700 μl total volume to an Eppendorf tube28.\nIncubate O/N at 4 °C on a rotator. Wash A/G agarose beads with the 1x STEN buffer 2-3 times and add 25 ml to the tissue mixture. Incubate at 4 °C for 1.5 hr on a rotator and then centrifuge at 2,000-4,000 rpm for 1 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet once with 1x STEN buffer and 5 times with PBS. Add 40-60 μl of 1x STEN buffer to the pellet and boil for 5 min. After the samples are cool, centrifuge and collect the supernatant. Use SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to verify success of the immunoprecipitation process30.\n10. Dot Blot Analysis\nCut nitrocellulose paper into small rectangles for each clone that will be tested. Dot 2 μl of ALS, FTD and healthy human brain tissue samples unto the nitrocellulose paper and let it dry completely.\nAdd 1-2 ml of 5% milk powder in PBS and let it shake for 1 hr at RT. Add 1 ml of 1/100 dilution of each phage and let it shake O/N at 4 °C. Wash the membrane 3 times for 10 min each with 0.5% PBST.\nAdd 1 ml of 1/1,000 dilution of anti-M13 HRP and let it shake for 1 hr at RT. Repeat wash procedure and visualized using Western chemiluminescence solution.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
