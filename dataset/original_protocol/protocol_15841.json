    "Training resources (both events and materials) may be searched in TeSS in several ways. A general search can be performed based on keywords, which will return separate lists of events and materials. Alternatively, events or materials can be searched for independently of each other. The second approach allows more precise filtering on several parameters (e.g., event type, country, and target audience) alone or in combination. In this protocol, we provide examples of searches for specific events or materials.\nNecessary Resources\nDesktop or a laptop computer or a mobile device with fast Internet connection\nUp-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Microsoft Edge\nSearch for specific events\n1a. Select “Events” in the top menu.\n2a. Enter “Single-cell” as the keyword in the search text box and click on the magnifier icon.\n3a. In the side menu, scroll down to the “Country” facet. Select “United Kingdom”.\n4a. In the side menu, scroll to the “Target audience” facet. Select “Graduate students”.\nThe result is a list of training events about single-cell data analysis available in the United Kingdom for graduate students.\nSearch for specific materials\n1b. Select “Materials” in the top menu.\n2b. Enter a keyword in the search text box. We will enter “Data retrieval”.\n3b. In the side menu, select a difficulty level. We will select “Beginner”.\n4b. Scroll to the “Resource type” facet and select “e-learning”.\nThe result is a list of training materials about data retrieval intended for a beginner level audience and tagged as e-learning material.\nWhether searching for event or materials, any of the filters can be removed at any time to reduce the stringency of the search. Past events can also be included by clicking the “Show past events” button.",
    "Widgets are chunks of JavaScript code that can be copied into the website source code to display TeSS content. Several different styles and functionalities are available from our configurable widget suite. Widgets can be used to enhance your site and offer your community lists of relevant events or training resources. Examples of code can be found at https://elixirtess.github.io/TeSS_widgets/[href=https://elixirtess.github.io/TeSS_widgets/].\nNecessary Resources\nDesktop or a laptop computer or a mobile device with fast Internet connection\nUp-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Microsoft Edge\n1.

Save the HTML page and serve the HTML page for visual inspection.\n4. Visually validate that the rendered HTML page includes a table with the events extracted from TeSS.",
    "The table will show a filtered list according to the values in the params section (see snippet from step 2). In this case, all future courses aggregated in TeSS will be live-filtered on the general search term “Python” and display only the courses from Belgium and the United Kingdom.\n5. Remove the term “Python” from the general search.\nThe table should now be updated with all upcoming courses from Belgium and the United Kingdom. By adapting other facets such as “Scientific Topics” and “Target audience”, other filtering schemes can be established.",

    "TeSS features several options for automatically harvesting resources from external sources. This can be helpful if you maintain a large collection of events and materials that changes frequently. To register resources in TeSS automatically, data must be able to be reliably extracted from target sources. To this end, it is helpful if the data are structured according to a globally used standardized format. The following are examples of the kinds of structured data that are compatible with TeSS.\nIf your website currently includes no structured data and you want your resources added to TeSS, we recommend using Bioschemas to structure your site. Schema.org is a project run by a consortium of search engines. Schema.org has created an extensive library of schemas that webmasters can use to explicitly mark up website content in order to improve search engine visibility and interoperability. Bioschemas is an initiative to supplement the work of Schema.org to help improve the findability of online resources in the life sciences. TeSS supports the following Bioschemas profiles: (1) CourseInstance and Course for events that are courses, (2) Event for other events, and (3) TrainingMaterial for training materials. Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.682#cpz1682-fig-0003] provides a schematic overview of the protocol steps.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ab954eb-6975-4c14-bb62-200542996b74/cpz1682-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nSchematic overview of steps for automatic harvesting of training events and materials.\nNecessary Resources\nDesktop or a laptop computer or a mobile device with fast Internet connection\nUp-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Microsoft Edge\n1.

More specifically, enter a JSON object as shown below in a script element with the attribute type=\"application/ld+json\". This script element needs to be placed as a child of the head element of the HTML page. This results in the following script HTML element.\n         \n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n\"@type\": \"LearningResource\",\n\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo\": { \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\", \"@id\": \"https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/1.0-RELEASE\" },\n\"name\": \"Adding nanomaterial data\",\n\"version\": \"0.9.3\",\n\"description\": \"This tutorial describes how nanomaterial data can be added to an eNanoMapper server using an RDF format.\",\n\"license\": \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\",\n\"keywords\": \"ontologies, enanomapper, RDF\",\n\"url\": \"https://nanocommons.github.io/tutorials/enteringData/\",\n\"provider\": {\n\"@type\": \"Organization\",\n\"name\": \"NanoCommons\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.nanocommons.eu/\"\n},\n\"audience\": {\n\"@type\": \"EducationalAudience\",\n\"educationalRole\": \"Graduates\"\n},\n\"inLanguage\": {\n\"@type\": \"Language\",\n\"name\": \"English\",\n\"alternateName\": \"en\"\n},\n\"author\": [\n{\n\"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n\"@type\": \"Person\",\n\"name\": \"Egon Willighagen\",\n\"identifier\": \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7542-0286\",\n\"orcid\": \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7542-0286\"\n}\n]\n}\n</script>\n3. Validate the individual page with the Schema.org validator at https://validator.schema.org[href=https://validator.schema.org] by pasting the URL https://nanocommons.github.io/tutorials/enteringData/index.html[href=https://nanocommons.github.io/tutorials/enteringData/index.html] into the Fetch URL tab (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.682#cpz1682-fig-0004]).\nThe validation procedure will indicate if you have used non-existing properties of the Bioschemas profile. If error messages are returned, see Troubleshooting below.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/028fef46-4bc1-451f-9ae6-d1f2a8538c46/cpz1682-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nScreenshot of the Schema.org validator that checks whether you have used non-existing properties of the Bioschemas profile.\n4. Create a sitemap listing the material page URL and save it as sitemap.xml. The sitemap.xml file needs to be publicly browsable on the internet. In our example, the manually created sitemap.xml is published at https://nanocommons.github.io/sitemap.xml[href=https://nanocommons.github.io/sitemap.xml].\nMore complex mechanisms for sitemap creation are available by using content management systems such as Drupal and using specific sitemap plugins.\n5. Enter “NanoCommons” as the “Content Provider”.\nIf the provider is not already registered in TeSS, this should be done first as described above (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.682#cpz1682-prot-0007]).",
    "6. Make note of the Content Provider's exact Title and URL. In our example, this is NanoCommons and https://www.nanocommons.eu/[href=https://www.nanocommons.eu/].\n7. Go to https://github.com/ElixirTeSS/bioschemas_sources/edit/main/sources.yml[href=https://github.com/ElixirTeSS/bioschemas_sources/edit/main/sources.yml] to edit the sources.yml file and add your Content Provider details along with the URL to your sitemap:\n         \ntitle: NanoCommons\nurl: https://www.nanocommons.eu/\nsource: https://nanocommons.github.io/sitemap.xml\n8. To commit your change, click the button to open a pull request, which will then be reviewed. After review, the new training material will appear in TeSS.\nYour content should appear in TeSS the following day. Each source will be scraped once per day at ∼3 AM UTC."
