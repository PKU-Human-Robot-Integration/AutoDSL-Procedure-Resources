    "1.  Lipophilic Dye Injection\nTissue Preparation:\nAll tissue dissections and manipulations are carried out in animals fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by transcardial perfusion using peristaltic pumps with appropriately sized needles.  Tissue can be stored in 4% PFA in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.  All preparations and manipulations are conducted in 0.4 % or higher PFA until mounting with glycerol for imaging.  This amount of PFA effectively eliminates RNases and preserves the RNA for in situ hybridization.\nDye Storage:\nAll dyes should be stored in a dark closed compartment to minimize air circulation and exposure to bright daylight, as they are photosensitive.  To avoid cross contamination, a separate set of instruments should be used to handle each dye.\nFirst, an application site for the dye must be chosen and extraneous tissue extracted in order to visually confirm the chosen site, and access for placement of the dye.  Choosing the application site is the most important step in this process.  Choosing a good site to label the neuronal population under consideration and not extraneous structures can be challenging.  The accuracy of the placement into a given tract under visual control in the dissecting scope requires a certain level of understanding of the neuroanatomy in question. Dye can either be placed centrally or peripherally to label peripheral or central projections respectively as needed for a given project (i.e. brain, peripheral nerve, ear, eye).  Lipophic dyes will diffuse in all processes belonging to a given neuron, both retrogradely and anterogradely, filling a given neuron or all neurons projecting into a given track.",
    "NeuroVue dye from MTTI comes pre-loaded onto filter strips for easy application.  Dye can also be dissolved in 100% DMSO (work under the hood) and thin hair can be soaked in this solution and subsequently dried for smaller applications. The preloaded filter paper dye is cut into appropriately sized triangular pieces with microscissors.  The size of the dye will depend on the size of the specimen, size of the structure being labeled, and number of colors being used simultaneously.  Be sure to cut as small of a piece as possible to avoid labeling other structures.  After using microsissors for cutting and forceps for handling the dye agitate the instruments in alcohol to remove any dye residue, then air dry completely, or dab with paper.  This is to avoid contaminating the  specimen with residual dye on instruments that may label unwanted structures.\nFor insertion into soft tissue such as brain the filter can be directly inserted using a point of the filter triangle to pierce the tissue.  For more rigid tissues make an incision to allow easier insertion of dye.  Do not use a dissecting needle to push filter into tissue.  This can cause inaccurate placement and disruption of the tissue. Insert alternate wavelengths of NeuroVue dye as needed for labeling of additional neuronal populations.\nAfter inserting the dye, and verifying its position, specimens are placed in a securely closed vial with 4% PFA and incubated at 36°C in the dark for 2-14 days depending on age and diffusion distance to be covered (approximately 2 mm per day at 36°C).",
    "A dissecting scope with epiflouresence can be used to assess if the dye has diffused to the desired location, and the specimen can be placed back in the incubator if the diffusion is deemed to be insufficient.  Using a normal dissecting scope without epifluorescene to detect diffusion will underestimate the true length the dye has diffused.  Also, if dye concentration is high enough to asses visually it may cause absorption quenching when using emitted fluorescence.\nThe desired tissue of interest is dissected out and whole mounted onto a slide with glycerol and coverslipped for imaging with a confocal microscope.  Confocal settings are as described in 1, 2.  If tissue size inhibits whole mounting on a slide, serial sectioning is needed (see below).  More details on preparation of tissue for imaging and dye spectral properties are available at: http://www.mtarget.com/mtti/documents/NeuroVuebrochuremar2010.pdf[href=http://www.mtarget.com/mtti/documents/NeuroVuebrochuremar2010.pdf]\n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2451/2451fig1.jpgFigure 1. Schematic overview of experiment. The ear is exposed to allow for visualization of all structures.  Lipophilic dye is then injected and allowed to diffuse.  After diffusion distinct neuronal populations can be seen labeled by the different dyes.  Next, in situ hybridization (Sox2) is performed on the ear and labels mRNA expression.  Immunohistochemistry is then carried out (Myo7, Tubulin) to visualize protein expression.  Followed by histological sections in which both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry can be visualized.\n2.  in Situ Hybridization\nIn case you want to start with in situ hybridization (after which tracing with lipophilic dyes will be impossible), refer to tissue preparation in Part 1.  Each wash, unless indicated, is carried out with 2 mL of solution at room temperature on an inverter/mixer.  Be sure to work in a clean, RNase free environment.\nDehydrate and then rehydrate samples  through a graded methanol series.\n100% 1 hour to overnight @ 4°C (optional:  store samples at -20°C in 100% methanol)",

The following is a rough estimate of times.  Digestion should be closely monitored as deproteination is a critical step.  Under-digestion will result in poor probe penetration while over-digestion will result in a loss of structural integrity. A good indicator of digestion is a change in the tissue from opaque to almost clear.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nTable 1. Proteinase K digestion time on mouse tissue.,Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry",
    "Steps 1 and 2 can be omitted if Part 2 was completed.  In that case, make sure that all glycerol or other mounting medium is washed off.  Note that not all antibodies will still be able to detect their epitope after proteinase K digestion.  We have a short list of antibodies that can be used in combination with in situ hybridization in mammalian tissue as they retain their specificity (see Table 2).\nGraded ethanol series to rid tissue of lipophilic dyes (if not completed to effect in Part 2):  50% ethanol 5min., 70% ethanol 5 min., 95-100% ethanol overnight or as needed until desired effect, 70% ethanol 5 min., 50% ethanol 5min.\nRehydrate by incrementally adding PBS in 5-10 minutes.\nBlock tissue for 1 hr in 2.5% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.5% Triton X-100 @ RT on shaker.\n(1:1  5% NGS:1.0% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS)\nIncubate with primary antibody(s) diluted in block solution 48-72 hrs @ 4°C on shaker.\nWash with PBS for 1hr x 3 changes.\nBlock as in step 3.\nIncubate with secondary antibody(s) diluted in block solution for 12-24hrs @ 4°C on shaker (Alexa Fluor® dyes from Invitrogen were used).\nWash as in step 5.

    "Imaging: Specimens can be imaged at this step with both transmission and epifluorescent microscopy, preferentially using a confocal imaging system for added resolution.  To do this we routinely whole mount ears in glycerol using coverslips as spacers to avoid over compression of the tissue.  In addition or instead of this whole mount imaging, specimens can be embedded in epoxy resin and serially sectioned for added histological details.  To benefit from the combined whole mount/section analysis, avoid bleaching the fluorescent signal in the confocal imaging step.\nSolutions\nEthanol solutions:  Dilute 100% ethanol in distilled water to final concentrations of 50% and 70%.\nBlock Solution:  1:1 dilution 5% NGS:1.0% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS (final working concentrations: 2.5% NGS; 0.5% TritonX-100).\n1X PBS:  Mix 1 PBS packet (Sigma) in 1L distilled water.\n5% NGS:  Thaw 2.5 mL NGS and mix with 47.5 mL 1x PBS.

Histology",
    "Histology can be introduced after Part 1 to increase resolution of the lipophilic dye tracing in thick whole mounts such as juvenile brains or after completion of Parts 2 or 3.  For serial brain sections we recommend the Compresstome VF-700 microtome (Precisionary Instruments Inc., Greenville, North Carolina)  to obtain uniform section thickness.  Frozen sections are less optimal due to greater dye leakage during the sectioning process 3.  Preparation of serial sections and mounting in glycerol 4 is the preferred method of tissue preparation when whole mounts or surface mounts do not allow adequate visualization of tissue regions of interest.  Tissue can also subsequently be embedded in epoxy resin and cut at 1-2 μm thickness using glass or diamond knifes for TEM.  When using this technique most immunofluorescence will remain and is even more stable after plastic embedding, however, all lipophilic tracing will be entirely lost at this stage as they dissolve in alcohol and epoxy resin.  Take precaution as samples will be light sensitive until they are embedded.\nFor Compresstome VF-700 microtome sectioning, follow the recommendations of Precisionary Instruments Inc.\nEpoxy Embedding/Sectioning:\nFixation:  2.5% gluteraldehyde/1% PFA in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)  1hr to overnight.\nIn a glass sample vial dehydrate tissue:   30% ethanol (5min.), 50% ethanol (5min.), 70% ethanol (5min. to overnight), 95% ethanol (5x 10min. each), and absolute ethanol (5x 10min. each).\nTransitional Solvent:  1:1 absolute ethanol:propylene oxide (PO) for 5 min.\nSolvent:  PO only 5x 10min. each.\nInfiltration with resin:\n1:1 PO:resin overnight on shaker.\nPour solution with sample(s) into flat embedding mold and leave on counter 4-6 hrs to evaporate PO. Alternatively, remove cap of vial and leave on shaker for 4 hrs (works well with larger tissue).\nTransfer samples to 100% resin for 4 hrs.",
    "Embed in resin in final mold with label.  Polymerize by incubating at 60°C for 24-48 hours.\nCut block with a razor blade as needed to minimize extraneous resin. Cut 1-2 um serial sections on an Ultramicrotome (an Ultracut E Reichert-Jung was used).  Mount and image using epifluorescent microscopy.\nOptional:  Stain a portion of the sections with histological stains (i.e. Stevenel's blue) if desired (realize immunofluorescence will not be sustained in these sections). \nSolutions\nEthanol solutions:  Dilute 100% ethanol in distilled water to 30%, 50%, 70%, and 95% concentrations.\nFixation solution:  Mix 2.5 mL 50% Gluteraldehyde, 5 mL 10% Paraformaldehyde, and 42.5 mL 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (final concentrations:  2.5% gluteraldehyde; 4% PFA).  Store at 4°C.\nEpoxy Resin:   Make according to instructions supplied with Poly/Bed 812 Embedding Media/DMP-30 Kit (Polysciences, Inc. #08792-1).  Store at -20°C.\n5.  Representative Results",
