    "All animal experiments described were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Guangdong Lewwin Pharmaceutical Research Institute Co., Ltd. Male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, ~6-11 weeks were used for the experiments. The rats were reared following the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals13.\n1. Animal preparation\nNOTE: All the SD rats used in this study were awake and were not anesthetized/euthanized. The skill of restraint handling by grasping the skin on the back of the animal is needed.\nFind the lowest point of the subclavian triangular fossa between the neck and the forelimb in a rat. Move ~2-3 mm toward the head and reach the needlepoint at the blood collection site (Figure 1). Remove the hair using an electric shaver.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental needs, serum or plasma may be required. Plasma is taken as an example in this protocol, and it will not affect the operation of blood collection.\nPrepare cotton swabs stained with 75% alcohol for wiping and disinfecting and dry cotton swabs for wiping.\n2. Sampling of blood\nNOTE: At least 2 people, both of whom must be experienced in blood collection and rat restraint techniques should carry out these steps.\nGrasp the skin on the back of the neck with one hand to keep the rat's head, neck, and breast upright and expose the injection site (Video 1). Straighten the forelimb on the side of the injection site to maintain its level.\nKeep the syringe parallel to the rat's head with the other hand and tilt the syringe outward 5°-10° so that the tip is tilted toward the ventral direction.\nInsert the needle fully into the anterior cavity. Draw back the syringe to maintain negative pressure within the tube.",
    "Slowly move the needle from deep to shallow and back up the same path. When blood has entered the syringe needle, fix the position of the needle (Video 2).\n\tNOTE: The blood will then be filled at a constant rate in the syringe, as shown in Figure 2A (front view) and Figure 2B (side view).\nMonitor the maximum blood quantity in accordance with the standards set by the institution’s animal care and use committee. This depends on the weight and health of the animal. In absence of other requirements, do not remove more than 20% of the animal's total blood volume within 24 h, which requires ~3 weeks of recuperation14.\nWhen sufficient blood sample is collected, immediately withdraw the syringe and prepare for blood treatment (step 3).\nPressurize the rat's injection site for ~1-2 min to stop the bleeding. Since the collection site is in the lower part of the neck, pinch the skin of the subclavian vein to stop the bleeding by pressing on it (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Blood can be collected alternately from the bilateral subclavian vein when repeated blood collection is needed.\nReturn the rat to the cage and observe its condition.\n3. Processing the blood sample\nRemove the needle from the syringe and discard it in the sharp tool container. Slowly transfer the blood from the syringe to a 1.5 mL tube. Press the syringe against the wall to avoid bubble formations, if any.\n\tNOTE: As pressure may cause red blood cells to rupture, remove the needle to prevent hemolysis14.\nCover the microcentrifuge tube, gently flick it, and turn it upside down at least five times to thoroughly mix the blood with the anticoagulant.\nCentrifuge the whole blood sample at 2000 x g for ~10-15 min at room temperature within 120 min after collecting the plasma.",
    "Use a pipette gun (see Table of Materials) to transfer the upper plasma into a blank microcentrifuge tube. Do not touch the pipette head with the lower whole blood. Dispose of or re-centrifuge the plasma contaminated with the red blood cells.\nUse the samples immediately or store them at -30 °C.\n\tNOTE: The characteristics of the drug determine the storage time. The plasma specimens obtained from the subclavian vein are translucent and light yellow. Hemolysis may turn the plasma red.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
