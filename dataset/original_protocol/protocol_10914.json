    "1.\tActivating the coverslip surface\n\tCoverslips (#1.5, 22x40 mm) are cleaned using a series of soap and ethanol washes in a previously described protocol (Waterman-Storer, 1998) to clean and remove dust.\n\tPlace coverslips in a stainless steel holder rack, such that coverslips are spaced apart and not touching.\n\tIn chemical fume hood (nitrile gloves and goggles recommended), dilute full strength 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane in isopropanol for a final concentration of 2% (2ml silane /100 ml isopropanol) to fill a square glass dish (~350ml volume).  Due to reactivity with plastic, use a glass Pasteur pipette to apply 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to the isopropanol.\n\tFully immerse coverslips from 1.2 into this solution for 10 min while gently stirring on a stir plate in the fume hood.\n\tWash coverslips by immersing in ddH2O (4 exchanges of water).  Allow 10 min soaking time for the final exchange, with stirring.  Amino-silane containing solutions should be disposed as hazardous waste.\n\tDry coverslips in incubator at warm temperature (~37°C) for 10 minutes in a dust free environment.\n\tCool to room temperature.\n\tIn the fume hood, immerse coverslips in 1% glutaraldehyde solution in ddH2O in a glass square dish on stir plate for 30 minutes.\n\tWash by 3 exchanges of ddH2O for 10 minutes per exchange, with stirring.  Dispose of glutaraldehyde as hazardous waste.\n\tDry at room temperature, covering with aluminum foil to avoid dust from sticking to the coverslips.\n\tStore in a dry place, away from dust, for up to 2 months.\n2.\tPreparation of polyacrylamide (PAA) gel",
    "Prepare stock solutions of acrylamide/bis-acrylamide mix from 40% acrylamide and 2% bis-acrylamide, following Table 1.  We maintain several stock solutions that are optimized for PAA gels of different stiffness; examples are listed in Table 1 and 2.  Stock solutions can be kept for several years, as long as they are maintained in a darkened bottle at 4 C.\n\tWorking solutions containing the final desired concentrations of acrylamide/bis-acrylamide are obtained from stock solutions.  For example, we prepare a working solution of 7.5% acrylamide/0.10% bis-acrylamide in ddH2O for making 2.8kPa PAA gels.\n\tDegas acrylamide solution in a vacuum chamber for 20 min, to reduce oxygen within the solution which prevents PAA polymerization.\n\tPrepare 10% ammonium persulfate (APS) solution (0.5g/5mL). Use fresh working stock within 3 days.  Alternatively, stocks can be frozen to be used at later dates.\n\tWhile acrylamide is degassing, wipe a 1x3\" microscope glass slide with Rain-X wipes vigorously to make glass slide surface hydrophobic. To remove excess Rain-X, wipe glass slide with damp Kimwipe.  Set glass slide aside, covered.\n\tRemove acrylamide solution from vacuum chamber and add fluorescent beads (1% by volume, 5 μl for the working solution listed in Table 1).  Add 0.75μl TEMED and 2.5 μl 10% APS, which will initiate gel polymerization. Mix well by pipetting for ~5 sec, to minimize the introduction of bubbles,\n\tApply 10-12 μl of the acrylamide solution to hydrophobic microscope slide (prepared in step 2.4) and place activated 22x40mm coverslip on top of the droplet.  Gel solution should coat entire coverslip.  Smooth out any bubbles that may appear within the solution. Allow the gel solution to polymerize at room temperature for ~10 min.",
    "The completion of polymerization can be assessed by inverting remaining working solution in microcentrifuge tube.  Also, the polymerized gel may pull away from coverslip edges. Immediately after macroscopic polymerization is observed, separate the coverslip from the glass slide.  Using the fine tip of a pair of tweezers or a razor blade edge, carefully remove coverslip, with gel attached, from microscope slide surface and immerse gel in ddH2O, to maintain hydration.\n3.\tCoupling extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to the PAA gel\nThree distinct methods can be used to attach ECM protein either to the top surface of the PAA gel (3.1 and 3.2) or incorporating ECM protein within the gel volume (3.3).  Here, we discuss the coupling of fibronectin to PAA gels to result in a surface ligand density that is equivalent to the amount adsorbed on glass after incubation with 10 μg/mL fibronectin solution for 1 hour.  Considerations for choosing a method are detailed in the discussion.\n\tCross-linking ECM protein to PAA gel surface by Sulfo-SANPAH\nReactive amines on proteins are covalently attached to the PAA gel surface by the heterobifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-SANPAH\n\tPrepare 40 μl working aliquots of Sulfo-SANPAH by dissolving Sulfo-SANPAH powder in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (20 μl per mg of Sulfo-SANPAH). Flash freeze stocks in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C for later use. \n\tRemove ddH2O from gel surface using a coverslip spinner (< 2sec). Avoid drying the gel.\n\tDilute Sulfo-SANPAH-DMSO aliquots in ddH2O (2mg/ml, pH 7) immediately before use and coat gel surface (~200 μl). Note that the reactivity half-life of Sulfo-SANPAH is short (~5 min) at room temperature in water; therefore, these steps should be done at a rapid pace.",
    "Expose gel surface to UV light in a UV cross-linker oven (8W, 254 nm wavelength at a distance of 2-3 inches for 1.5 min).  Sulfo-SANPAH will change in color from orange to brown.\n\tDip UV-treated coverslips in a beaker with fresh ddH2O and remove excess water from gel surface using a coverslip spinner (<2sec).\n\tPipette ~50 μL of cold 1mg/ml Fibronectin (FN) (in PBS, pH 7.4) on Parafilm in Petri dish container. Invert coverslip on top of FN drop, gel side exposed to FN.\n\tReact at room temperature for 1-2 hours or at 4°C overnight.\n\tPlace coverslips in 6 cm tissue culture dishes containing PBS (pH 7.4), enough to cover coverslip, under sterile conditions in tissue culture hood.\n\tWash extensively with several washes (3-5) of PBS (pH 7.4), under sterile conditions.\n\tSterilize the coverslips by use of germicidal lamp in tissue culture hood for 30 min.\n\tIncubate coverslips in cell media for 30-45 min prior to plating cells.\n\tCross-linking ECM to the PAA gel surface by hydrazine hydrate\nCarbohydrate groups on proteins are oxidized and coupled to the gel using hydrazine hydrate.\n\tPrepare polyacrylamide gels as described in section 2.\n\tPlace PAA gel coverslips in plastic Petri dish in a fume hood and using gloves pipette approximately 1 ml of undiluted hydrazine hydrate onto the surface of each PAA gel and incubate for at least two hours, but no longer than 24 hours \n\tAdd ddH2O to the Petri dish; Remove hydrazine hydrate solution and dispose as hazardous waste.\n\tAdd 5% acetic acid to the Petri dish to immerse coverslip.  Cover and incubate for one hour.\n\tRemove the acetic acid and wash with ddH2O. Incubate in ddH2O for one hour. The coverslips are now activated and ready to cross-link oxidized Fibronectin (FN).",
    "Dilute 10 μl of 1 mg/ml FN solution in 940 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) in a dark micro centrifuge tube, making a final concentration of 10 μg/ml.\n\tMake stock of 20X sodium meta-periodate by adding 80 mg of sodium meta-periodate to 1 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5).\n\tAdd 50 μl of 20X sodium meta-periodate stock to the FN solution prepared in 3.2.6, such that final working concentration are 10 μg/ml FN and 4 μg/ml sodium meta-periodate. Incubate in the dark tube at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\tRemove excess ddH2O from activated gel surface prepared in 3.2.5 using a coverslip spinner (< 2 sec). Avoid drying the gel.\n\tPipet ~500 μl of FN solution onto activated gel surface and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\n\tPlace coverslips in dishes containing PBS (pH 7.4), enough to cover coverslip.\n\tWash extensively with several washes (3-5) of PBS (pH 7.4).\n\tSterilize the coverslips by use of germicidal lamp in tissue culture hood for 30 min.\n\tIncubate coverslips in cell media for 30-45 min prior to plating cells.\n\tBulk conjugation of ECM protein in PAA gel by Acryloyl-X, succinimidyl ester\nThis protocol is done prior to 2.5.  Reactive amines on proteins are coupled to an acrylamide monomer with NHS ester chemistry and then co-polymerized into the bulk of the PAA gel.\n\tConjugate ECM protein of choice to Acryloyl-X per the manufacturer's instructions.  Stock solutions of conjugated protein should be stored at 4°C.\n\tCalculate the volume of PAA working solution required for gel fabrication (e.g. 10 uL per coverslip).\n\t Subtract 50 μL (e.g. 10% volume) of water from amount listed in the working solution recipe in Table 1 and initiate polymerization.",
    "Remove volume calculated in 3.3.2 and add ECM/Acryloyl-X solution to 10% volume.  (e.g. 1 μL of ECM/Acryloyl-X  to 9 μL of PAA solution).  This step should be performed rapidly, as gel is polymerizing.\n\tComplete steps 2.6 and 2.7 as described previously.\n\tWash extensively with several washes (3-5) of PBS (pH 7.4), under sterile conditions.\n\tSterilize the coverslips by use of germicidal lamp in tissue culture hood for 30 min.\n\tIncubate coverslips in cell media for 30-45 min prior to plating cells.\n4.\tLoading coverslip into confocal imaging chamber\nThese steps are conducted after cells have been allowed to spread on ECM-coated gel substrate (~6-12 hrs).  To assemble the confocal imaging chamber (RC-30WA), it is useful to consult the Warner Instruments website for guidance.\n\tWarm cell media and 0.5% or 0.25% trypsin and load into a 5ml or 10ml syringe.\n\tLoad a 22x30mm coverslip onto the Top Coverslip holder of a Warner Instruments confocal imaging chamber (RC-30WA) using vacuum grease to keep the coverslip in place.\n\tPlace a chamber forming rubber gasket on top of the coverslip, allowing access to both inlet and outlet polyethylene tubing. This will allow a spacing of 150-1000 μm between the top coverslip and the gel-coated 22x40mm coverslip, depending on the size of gasket used.\n\tLoad syringes onto inlet tubing, via connector kit, and check that media flows through tubing and onto Top Coverslip and no bubbles are apparent in the flow lines.\n\tApply vacuum grease onto base of chamber and load gel-coated 22x40mm coverslip, cell-side up. Apply warm media to cells.\n\tPlace Top Coverslip holder onto chamber base, with Chamber Gasket separating it from the gel-coated coverslip. Make sure that the Locating Pins within the chamber base sit within the Locating Holes in the Top Coverslip.",
    "Apply the Pressure Plate to the chamber base and use the Pressure Plate Wrench to screw in and secure the Pressure Plate.\n\tCheck the flow of media through the tubing and chamber to monitor any potential leaks within the chamber and to eliminate any media-free zones on the cell surface.  Note: using a small gauge needle to draw a slight vacuum while infusing with media can help eliminate media-free zones.\n\tApply the confocal imaging chamber to the Stage Adapter situated within a microscope holder for imaging.\n\tImage fluorescently-labeled protein and fluorescent beads embedded within the gel substrate on a confocal fluorescence microscope.\n\tTo obtain an image of unstrained bead positions within the gel, perfuse trypsin to detach cellular adhesions from the gel, and take an image of the fluorescent beads in the same imaging field where the cell adhered. Comparison of strained and unstrained bead positions allows for the quantification of gel substrate displacement under contraction.\nRepresentative Results:\nThe above protocol describes the experimental procedure for preparing compliant PAA gels for studying cell contractility and is illustrated in Figure 1. The gel surface obtained with this protocol is relatively flat and smooth, with fluorescent beads embedded evenly throughout (Figure 2A).",
    "If measuring gel contraction at the location of focal adhesions, imaging of the cell (Figure 3A) and gel surface (Figure 3B) should be done at the confocal optical plane of focal adhesions. The contraction of a gel can be visualized by displacement of embedded fluorescent beads (Figure 3B) at the gel surface when cells are adherent (strained) versus detached (unstrained). The use of computational algorithms can yield traction stresses associated with bead displacement and corresponding elastic modulus of the gel (Figure 3C and 3D) (Sabass et al., 2008). If imaging takes place deeper within the gel, then bead displacements will be smaller and not representative of traction forces exerted at focal adhesions.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2173/2173fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of experimental setup. The overall goal of this procedure is to create compliant matrices for the purpose of studying cellular contraction. The first step of the experimental procedure is to activate coverslips by amino-silane/glutaraldehyde treatment for the purpose of anchoring polymerized gels.  The second step is to polymerize a polyacrylamide gel, containing fluorescent beads, onto the activated coverslip. The third step involves the chemical cross-linking of extracellular ligand to the surface of the polyacrylamide gel, using one of the three coupling techniques listed in step 3.  Cells are then plated onto the gel and allowed to adhere and spread.  Under active cellular contraction, beads embedded in the gel displace.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2173/2173fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
