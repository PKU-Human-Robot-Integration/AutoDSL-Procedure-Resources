    "The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\n1. Patient selection\nDiagnose achalasia by clinical manifestations and diagnostic testing (barium esophagram, high-resolution manometry (HRM), and upper endoscopy)10: the presence of symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss; the \"bird's-beak\" appearance on barium esophagram; impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and absent peristalsis on the results of HRM; and ruling out malignancy by upper endoscopy.\nUse the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of achalasia; Eckardt score11 > 3; age between 18-80 years; written informed consent for POEM using the scissor-type knife.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: coagulopathy and systemic disorders that precluded safe general anesthesia; pregnancy; ulcerated esophagitis.\n2. Preoperative preparations\nAdminister a liquid only diet 1 day before the POEM procedure.\nAdminister intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 30 min before the induction of anesthesia.\nPerform an upper endoscopy to aspirate any residual contents to reduce the risk of aspiration immediately before the induction of anesthesia.\nAdminister general anesthesia (propofol) with endotracheal intubation.\nPlace the patient in a supine position.\n3. Surgical technique with a scissor type knife for the POEM procedure\nNOTE: See Figure 1 for the POEM procedure using a scissor-type knife.\nIdentify the EGJ by the puckered and tight appearance. Confirm the increased resistance when maneuvering the endoscope through the EGJ. Note the location of the EGJ by measuring the distance from the incisors.\nChoose an injection point 7 to 9 cm proximal to the EGJ in the posterior wall (the 5-6 o'clock position) of the esophagus. Inject saline with methylene blue into the submucosal space with an endoscopic injection needle.",
    "NOTE: Use an extended proximal injection point for patients with Chicago type III achalasia.\nMake a 1.5 to 2 cm longitudinal mucosal incision with the scissor-type knife (endocut Q mode: effect 3, duration 2, interval 4).\nRotate the blades of the scissor-type knife parallel to the muscle layer. Then grasp and dissect (endocut Q mode: effect 3, duration 2, interval 4) the submucosa tissue to create a submucosal tunnel to a location 2 to 3 cm below the EGJ. Keep the dissection plane close to the muscle layer. Inject saline with methylene blue into the submucosal tissue to expand the working space with tunnel progression.\nConfirm the adequate submucosal tunnel length by the blue discoloration of the gastric mucosa on the retroflexed view.\nUse the scissor-type knife for intraoperative vessel sealings and bleeding controls (forced coagulation mode: effect 2, 50 W) without changing the hemostatic forceps.\nBegin the anterograde myotomy at approximately 2 cm distal to the mucosal entry. Selectively grasp and dissect (endocut Q mode: effect 3, duration 2, interval 4) the internal circular muscle bundle with the scissor-type knife. Extend the myotomy 2 to 3 cm onto the gastric cardia.\nAfter the completion of myotomy, confirm the smooth passage through the EGJ by reinserting the endoscope into the esophageal lumen.\nClose the mucosal entry with endoclips.\n4. Postoperative management\nAdmit patients to the inpatient ward following the POEM procedure for observation.\nAdminister intravenous antibiotics for 24 h after the POEM procedure. Continue the intravenous PPIs until discharge, and then switch to the oral PPIs (single dose) for 6 weeks.\nInitiate a liquid diet 24 h after the POEM procedure. At discharge, instruct patients to adhere to a soft diet for 2 weeks, and then resume regular diet gradually.\n5. Follow-up",
    "Schedule an initial follow-up by outpatient visits and telephone interviews at 3 months postoperatively.\nAt the follow-up visit, obtain standardized questionnaires from patients, including Eckardt scores11, GerdQ scores12, body weight, and information about PPIs use. Schedule objective tests, including HRM, barium esophagram, and upper endoscopy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
