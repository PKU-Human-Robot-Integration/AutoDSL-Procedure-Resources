    "1. Preparation of the system\nInstall the fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system and MALS/refractive index (RI) detectors (see Table of Materials) along with their respective software packages for control, data acquisition, and analysis per the manufacturers’ instructions.\nConnect the MALS and RI detectors downstream of the FPLC’s UV and conductivity detectors. Bypass the pH detector unless it is absolutely necessary for pH gradients, to minimize the interdetector volume between the UV and MALS detectors. Use capillary tubing of 0.25–0.5 mm inner diameter (i.d.) between the column and detectors and 0.75 mm i.d. capillary tubing on the output of the RI detector to the waste or fraction collector.\nEnsure that the necessary signal connections between the FPLC and detectors have been established, including a UV analog output from the FPLC detector to the MALS Aux input and digital output from the FPLC to the MALS Autoinject In, via the I/O Box.\n2. Preparation of the sample and buffer\nFilter all reagents, including the washing and elution buffers, with a 0.1 µm filter. Filter the first 50–100 mL of buffer into a waste bottle in order to eliminate particulates from the dry filters, and keep the remainder of the buffer in a clean, sterile bottle that has been washed thoroughly with filtered water and capped to prevent dust from entering.\nAdjust a BSA sample to a pH and ionic strength (e.g., pH = 8, 50 mM NaCl) that allow binding to the IEX column during dilution, ultrafiltration, or buffer exchange procedures.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to prefilter the protein sample to the smallest pore size that does not remove the material of interest (0.02–0.1 µm). Alternatively, the sample can be centrifuged at high speed (13,000–16,000 x g) for 10 min to enable the precipitation of large particles.",
    "Prepare at least 0.3–0.5 mg of BSA (see Table of Materials) to inject in a 1 mL column (5/50 mm) for achieving a good-quality MALS analysis. Note that the volume of injection is unlimited.\n3. Choice and development of an IEX method for a protein\nCalculate the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein based on the primary sequence, for which servers such as Protparam tool on the ExPASy website can be used15. Note that the pI of BSA is 5.8.\nSelect the column type and buffer parameters.\n\t\nUse different buffers for AIEX and CIEX, depending on the pKa of the buffer and the ionic nature of the buffer. Use cationic buffers when running the AIEX column and anionic buffers when running the CIEX column with small counterions. In this example, use 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, for the analysis of BSA on an AIEX column.\nFor a protein with a pI lower than 7, such as BSA, use an AIEX column and buffer with a pH higher than the pI by at least two units. For a protein with a pI higher than 7, use a CIEX column and buffer with a pH lower than the protein pI by at least two units.\nOptimize the buffer pH according to the strength of binding between the protein and the column matrix. If a protein does not bind well to the column, use a pH farther from the pI. Make sure that the protein is stable at the used pH.",
    "Use a low salt concentration in the binding and wash the buffers to allow binding of the protein to the matrix, since protein binding depends on the ionic strength of the loaded sample. Proteins usually require some salt for their stability; therefore, use 50 mM NaCl (or alternative salt) during the protein-loading and column-washing steps.\nFor elution buffer, use a maximum of 0.5 M NaCl to detach the protein from the column.\n\t\t​NOTE: Higher salt concentrations are not recommended when working with the standard-model RI refractometer due to the range limitation of the instrument. However, a high-concentration model can be used and will accommodate 2 M NaCl.\nPerform an initial method as follows.\n\t\nLoad 1 mg of BSA (170 µL of 6 mg/mL) in ~0.5 mL of a loading buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 50 mM NaCl. Wash the column with the same buffer for a 10–15 column volume (CV) to allow the complete elution of the unbound molecules and particles from the system until the light scattering (LS), UV, and RI signals are fully stabilized.\nPerform a short, linear salt gradient of 20–30 CV, using elution buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.5 M NaCl to detach the protein from the column. Perform a gradient of 0%–100% (or alternative widespread gradient) of the elution buffer or split it to two gradients: 0%–50% of elution buffer followed by an additional gradient of 50%–100% of elution buffer, each gradient for 10–20 CV. For BSA, use a widespread gradient of 15%–70% for 30 CV for the initial method.\n\t\t​NOTE: In some instances, the initial method may provide separation for a reliable MALS analysis, and additional runs are not necessary. In many cases, the initial method provides only guidance for further method optimization.",
    "Optimize the IEX method to increase the resolution and improve the peak separation by changing different parameters.\n\t\nChange the gradient slope and length. Short gradients with high slopes provide intense peaks with less separation, while long gradients with mild slopes provide lower peaks with better separation. Find the balance between peak resolution and signal intensity for optimal MALS analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Loading a higher quantity of protein can increase LS, UV, and RI signals but does so at the expense of resolution.\nUse a stepwise salt concentration profile for the elution. Remember that a combination of steps and linear gradient is commonly used.\nDecrease the flow rate to improve peak separation.\n\t\tNOTE: For matrixes with very small particles, this is not very significant.\nChange the buffer pH to increase the charge variation between the protein populations in the sample and improve the separation between those variants. Note that proteins that are not properly separated at one pH can be separated at a different pH.\nUse a pH gradient, linear or stepwise, to detach proteins from the IEX column. Use elution gradients that combine both pH and salt concentration variations if necessary.\nUse stronger salts, such as MgCl2, or weaker salts, such as sodium acetate, to increase sensitivity and resolution16.\nUse longer IEX columns or a different column matrix with smaller particles to improve separation abilities.\nChange the type of column (AIEX/CIEX) to provide a different pattern of separation. Note that matrixes with strong, weak, or combined (mixed-mode) ligands are also available and can improve the resolution of some samples.\nUse a column from a different supplier with the same ligand that is attached to different matrix resins. The resin itself, independently of the ligand, can interact differently with the proteins and affect the separation profile.",
    "Include additives (molecules that stabilize the protein in the solution) in the buffers to improve protein stability and avoid protein aggregation, to improve the IEX experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Examples of such additives are sugars, alcohols, urea, nonionic or zwitterionic detergents, and chaotropic and kosmotropic salts17,18.\n4. IEX-MALS experiment\nOpen New\\Experiment from Method in the MALS software and select the online method from the Light Scattering system methods folder. If the DLS module is available and DLS data are to be acquired, select the online method from the Light Scattering\\With QELS subfolder.\nSet the parameters of the run under the Configuration section.\n\t\nSet the flow rate of the run in the Generic Pump section to the flow rate used in the FPLC (1.5 mL/min), and enter or verify the buffer parameters under the Solvent section.\nEnter the protein name (BSA), refractive index increment (dn/dc; the standard value for proteins is 0.185 mL/g), UV extinction coefficient at the wavelength of 280 nm (0.66 g/L-1·cm-1), and the concentration of the protein sample (6 mg/mL) in the Sample tab under the Injector section. Insert the sample volume for injection (170 µL) as well under the same section.\nIn the Basic Collection tab, under the Procedure section, select the checkbox Trigger on Autoinject and set the duration of the run so that data collection will be continued for at least 5 min after the gradient has reached its final value.\nSet the experiment parameters in the FPLC software.",
    "Create a new experiment in the Method Editor tab. The initial experiment will be a linear gradient of salt or pH (see step 3.3). For the optimized method, create a more specific gradient or a stepwise program according to the elution results during the initial method (see step 3.4 and Figure 1). Include a pulse signal in the method that will trigger data collection in the MALS software.\nWash the column and valves with the relevant buffers: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, with 50 mM NaCl for the washing buffer (A valve) and the same buffer with 500 mM NaCl for the elution buffer (B valve). Make sure that the final column wash uses the binding buffer, containing a low salt concentration, to enable the binding of the protein to the column matrix. For a massive wash of strongly bound impurities, use 0.5 M NaOH before washing with the relevant buffers, followed by a neutralization buffer wash.\nPlace the protein sample in the loop using a syringe. If more than 10 mL of the sample is loaded, use a superloop or the pump-valve of the FPLC instrument while bypassing the filter pump and the mixer of the FPLC.\nStart the experiment first in the MALS software by clicking on the Run button and then in the FPLC software. Data will be collected after receiving the pulse signal from the FPLC instrument via the MALS detector.\nApply the same parameters of the run and instructions described in steps 4.1–4.4 if the IEX-MALS is performed manually with a continuous-flow mode instead of a stand-alone method.",
    "Once the final method has been verified and run, perform exactly the same method using a blank injection (loading buffer instead of the sample). It is important that the timing between the autoinject pulse and the gradient of the blank run is identical to that of the sample run.\n5. Analysis of IEX-MALS experimental data\nPerform the analysis step by step under the Procedure section in the MALS software. The Basic Collection view displays the raw data collection of the experiment.\n\t\nUse the Despiking tab to smooth the chromatograms if they exhibit a lot of noise. Normally, use the normal level.\nDefine the baseline for all signals (all LS, UV, and RI detectors) in the Baseline view.\nDefine the peaks for analysis in the Peaks view. Verify the correct values of dn/dc and the UV extinction coefficient for the protein under each peak.\n\t\t​NOTE: For proteins, it is common to use a standard RI increment value of 0.185 mL/g, but for other macromolecules, different dn/dc values should be used, according to the nature of the molecule. The average dn/dc of polynucleotides (DNA/RNA) is 0.17 mL/g19, while saccharides, such as sucrose, have an average dn/dc value of 0.145 mL/g20 and the dn/dc values of lipids and detergents range between 0.1–0.16 mL/g21.\nAnalyze the molar mass and the radius using the fitting parameters and the correlation function under the Molar Mass & Radius from LS and Rh from QELS views.\nThe RI signal changes significantly during the IEX-MALS run due to the increase in salt concentration. Therefore, subtract the baseline signal from the blank injection for mass calculations that require RI data.",
    "Open both the protein and blank IEX-MALS experiments. Right-click on the protein experiment name, select Apply Method, and choose the Baseline Subtraction folder from the file dialog. Select the correct type of method (e.g., online) for standard molar mass analysis. Note that the parameters and settings defined for the protein experiment will be saved on the new opened method.\nUnder the Baseline Subtraction view, click Import Blank to import the signals of the blank run. Under Instruments (next to the Import Blank button), check all of the detectors to subtract.\nIn the Peaks view, adjust the dn/dc values (if necessary) due to the conductivity of the solution at the protein peak area, since the RI of the solution is changed during the run12.\nCalibrate the IEX-MALS system with BSA monomer.\n\t​NOTE: Normally, the IEX-MALS system is periodically calibrated for peak alignment, band broadening, and normalization of the angular detectors to the 90° detector using a monodisperse protein with a radius of gyration (Rg) of <10 nm, such as BSA monomer. In this example, BSA serves both as the calibration molecule and is itself the subject of the molar mass analysis.\n\t\nAlign the peaks, under the Procedures > Configuration view.\nPerform normalization under the Normalization view, entering 3.0 nm as the Rg value.\nUnder Band Broadening in the same Configuration tab, choose the peak and match the UV and LS signals to the RI signal, using the Perform Fit button.",
    "The graph of the results is shown in the Results Fitting view. Change the axis scales and other graph parameters by right-clicking on the graph, selecting Edit, and then clicking on the Advanced button. A graph figure with more display options is also available in the EASI Graph tab: select Molar Mass from the Display drop-down menu at the top of the window.\nNote that all results, including molar mass, radius, level of purity, and others, are available in the Report view (summary or detailed) under the Results section. Use the Report Designer button to add more results or parameters, as well as figures, to the report."
