    "1. Temporal Summation Protocol\nEquipment\n\t\nHeat pulse delivery and location:\n\t\t\nUsed a circular thermode with a diameter of 2.9 cm. This thermode has a microprocessor driven, automated control system, and a peltier element that enables rapid temperature change. Place thermode on the thenar eminence of the subject and use a glove to secure the placement.\nComputer Interface:\n\t\t\nInterface the thermode with a software program on a laptop that precisely controls the temperature delivery. Preprogram the appropriate heat stimuli for each stage of the protocol (training 1 and 2 only, as the optimization and final trials follow the same pulse structure as training 2) according to specifications listed in Table 1.\nExecute the delivery of the heat pulses by selecting the heat stimulus program appropriate for each stage on the software, adjust the temperatures and hit \"start\" on the user interface.\nPain rating device:\n\t\t\nUse the Computerized Visual Analog Scale (CoVAS).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The CoVAS is a box with a mobile lever on a horizontal bar that represents the visual analog scale (VAS). It is an accessory to the main thermode.\nTraining\n\t\nDefine the visual analog scale (VAS) on the CoVAS:\n\t\t\nPresent the CoVAS to the participant and define the anchoring points on the VAS: 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst pain imaginable. Ascertain that the participant is comfortable moving the lever left and right with ease.\nDefine second pain:\n\t\t\nInstruct the participant to focus on second pain from a heat pulse. Define second pain as \"a slow, burning, achy pain that takes place about one second after the heat pulse.\"\nRate SECOND pain from a single heat pulse (training trial 1):\n\t\t\nSecure the thermode on the participant's thenar eminence. Instruct the participant to use CoVAS to rate second pain from each single pulse delivered through the thermode.",
    "Begin the pre-programed test on the laptop by hitting the \"start\" button on the software menu. Each heat pulse lasts 0.5 second and has an inter-stimulus interval of 10 s (see Fig. 1). Sequentially increase the baseline and peak temperatures of the heat pulse per Table 2.\nObserve closely the participants' rating of second pain. As soon as the participant rates the second pain as more than 2/10, stop the training trial 1 by pressing the stop button on the software. Remove the thermode and record the final heat pulse parameters (i.e. baseline and peak temperatures).\nRate pain continuously from a TS trial (training trial 2):\n\t\t\nSecure the thermode on the opposite hand. Inform the participant that they will receive a series of 10 rapid pulses. Instruct the participant to rate second pain only, and not focus on the faster heat pain sensation that immediately accompanies each pulse (first pain). Explain to the participant that the second pain may increase, decrease, or remain the same between each pulse.\nBegin the pre-programmed test on the laptop. Use the final baseline and peak temperatures recorded from step 1.2.3 above. Keep the pulse width at 0.5 s and the inter-stimulus interval at 2 s (Fig. 2). Switch hand and repeat this training trial if necessary until the participant is comfortable rating second pain continuously in response to rapid heat pulses.\nOptimization\n\t\nDefine P1, Pmax and TSE:\n\t\t\nDefine P1 as the pain rating at approximately 2 s after the delivery of the peak temperature from the first pulse (See Fig. 3).11,21\n\t\t\tNOTE: TSE is the estimated difference between the pain P1 and the maximum pain (Pmax).\nAdjusting pulse temperature. Aim to achieve TSE between 30 and 70/100 by sequentially adjusting the peak and baseline temperature according to Figure 4.",
    "NOTE: See Fig. 4 for optimization algorithm.\nSecure thermode: Using a surgical glove, secure the thermode to the participant's thenar eminence. Switch hand between each trial.\nDeliver heat pulses: Instruct the participant to only rate their second pain from the heat pulses. Confirm that the participant is ready to begin and then start the pre-programed test on laptop.\nIterations: Repeat steps 1.3.2 -1.3.4 until the participant's pain rating at P1 is <50/100 VAS and their TSE is between 30/100 and 70/100 VAS. Conduct no more than 5 optimization trials and ensure that there is a 3 min rest between each trial. Take the parameters from the very last trial as the final parameters.\nFinal Trials\n\t\nRest for 5 min between the optimization trial and the final trials. Repeat 1.3.3 and 1.3.4. using the final parameters from step 1.3.5 above. Have the participant rest for 3 min and then repeat again.\n2. Conditioned Pain Modulation Protocol\nOverview and equipment:\n\t\nTest stimulus: 30 s contact heat (delivered by the same thermode as above) calibrated to 6 out of 10 pain (Heat-6). See 2.2 for details.\nConditioning stimulus:\n\t\t\nConstruct the cold-water bath using a clear plastic box with a perforated dividing wall, and filling it with ice and water on one side and just water on the other. Gently agitate then insert thermometer to water-only side to ensure temperature is stable at 10 °C.\nIf unable to obtain stable temperature, attach a hydro pump to the side with ice to maintain stable temperature by circulating water constantly. Turn on the pump and make sure water side temperature is stable at 10 °C.\nTiming and computing CPM:",
    "Apply the test stimulus to the participant once before and once during the last 30 s of the conditioning cold bath. Compute CPM as the difference in the pain level of the Heat-6 stimulus applied before and during the last 30 s of the cold bath.\nCalibrating for Heat-6:\n\t\nEstimating Heat-6 via heat ramp:\n\t\t\nSecure the thermode to the thenar eminence of the non-dominant hand of the participant. Starting at 32 °C, increase the temperature at a rate of 0.3 °C per second.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A slow ramp rate is used to preferentially activate C-fibers20 which are responsible for CPM.12\nStop whenever the participant reaches thermal tolerance or at 51 °C maximum. Instruct the participant to rate the pain continuously during the heat ramp. Repeat 3 times and compute the average temperature where the pain rating is 6/10.\nFine thresholding: Apply the Heat-6 and instruct the participant to rate the pain. If the rating is between 5 and 7/10, proceed to 2.3.2. If it is >7 or <5, apply a series of 30 s thermal heat stimuli to the participant (alternating hands between each stimuli), ranging from 44 °C to 49 °C and changing in increments of 0.5-1 °C, until the rating is between 5-7, allowing a 30 s rest between each stimulus.\nFinalizing Heat-6 and rating of the pre-conditioning, test stimulus:\n\t\t\nEnd the fine thresholding once the participant's pain rating is between 5 and 7/10. NOTE: Use this final, within-range pain as the rating of the pre-conditioning testing stimulus for the computation of CPM. Also, record the temperature of the final Heat-6 that resulted in this rating.\nCPM protocol\n\t\nPre-condition test stimulus as per step 2.2.3.\nConditioning stimulus:",
    "Apply the cold-water bath at 10 °C to the contralateral foot for 2 min. Instruct the participant to rate the pain from the cold-water bath at 0, 30, and 90 s.\nRepeating the test stimulus during conditioning stimulus:\n\t\t\nApply the final Heat-6 stimulus from fine thresholding (2.2.3) to the same hand again during the last 30 s of the cold-water bath. Instruct the participant to rate the pain from Heat-6 at the end of the 30-second heat stimulus, which is also the end of the 120 s cold bath.\n\t\t\tNOTE: CPM is computed as the difference in the pain rating of the testing stimulus reported before and during the cold bath."
