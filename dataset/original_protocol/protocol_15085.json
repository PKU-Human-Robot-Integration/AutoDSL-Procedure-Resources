    "1. Surgery\nOnce removed by the surgeon, keep the prostate on ice until taken in charge of by a pathologist.\n2. Handling of Prostate Tissues\nTo respect the delay of perioperative ischemia, transfer radical prostatectomy specimens on ice to the laboratory by dedicated staff within 30 min after surgical ablation. The delay of freezing should be less than 20-30 min (Figure 3A).\nWeigh and stain the prostate according to the usual protocol (e.g. green on the right side, black on the left side, see Figures 3B and 3C).\nPerform a large transverse section of the gland on the posterior side (Figure 3D). Orient the prostate and put it on the anterior side. Perform a large transverse section of the gland on the posterior side with a sterile surgical knife.\nDissect pieces of tissue on the transition zone, on the left and right peripheral zones, leaving the margins intact (Figure 3E).\nPut the cores of tissue in an Eppendorf tube, snap freeze and store in liquid nitrogen (Figure 3F). If you are not making biobank proceed directly with step 2.7.\nPerform prostate banking only if the total length of cancer on biopsies is superior to 10 mm. Use a suture thread to close the prostate and to prevent gland distortion and minimal disruption of the surgical margin (Figure 3G). Then fix the radical prostatectomy specimen with formalin and embed in paraffin according to the usual procedure for histological analysis.\nMount frozen tissue cores vertically upon a small mound of OCT and make sections in a cryostat. Take a first single 5 µm frozen section and stain it with blue toluidine.",
    "Perform a quick histological examination to analyze the nature of the tissue (i.e. benign or malignant). For tumoral tissue, estimate the quantity of tumoral cells and select only cores with more than 80% of tumoral cells.\nFollowing this, perform a new single 5 µm frozen section and stain it with hematoxylin, eosin and Safran. Then, cut 15 sections x 30 µm and place it in a RNAse free Eppendorf tube.\nTake a last 5 µm frozen section for hematoxylin, eosin and Safran and stain it to control the quantity of tumoral cells at the end of the procedure.\nPut the Eppendorf tube in dry ice and send the sample to the molecular biology laboratory.\n3. RNA Extraction, Purification, and Quality Control\nHomogenization. Perform homogenization in the presence of 1 ml of Trizol/100 mg tissue until the tissue is completely dissolved in solution. Add Trizol solution gradually and proceed with care on ice using a hand-held grinder. Once homogenized, aliquot the solution to Eppendorf tubes and leave in Trizol at room temp for five minutes.\nPhase separation. Add 300 µl chloroform (or 150 µl BCP/1.5 ml Trizol). Vortex 15 sec then leave at room temp for 2-3 min. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 2-8 °C.\nRNA precipitation. Transfer carefully the top aqueous phase to a new tube. Add 750 µl isopropanol. Incubate at RT for 10 min (agitate by reversal). Incubate 2 hr at -19 °C/-31 °C. Centrifuge samples at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 2-8 °C.",
    "RNA wash and suspension. Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant. Wash RNA pellet with 1 ml 80% EtOH (gently reverse the tubes). Centrifuge samples at 7,500 x g for 10 min at 2-8 °C. Remove supernatant using P1000 and P10. Allow remaining EtOH to air dry for 2-3 min. Add 100 µl RNase-free water, transfer tubes to 70 °C heat block and let sit for 2-3 min to dissolve the pellet. Then put on ice. Store at -19 °C/-31 °C for short term storage and -80 °C for long term storage.\nRNA purification. Purify RNA using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Briefly, start by adding 350 µl buffer RLT to the 100 µl RNA sample and mix well, then follow the Qiagen procedure. Finally, take a 3 µl (out of 50 µl) aliquot of the purified product for quality controls (step 3.6). Store RNA at -19 °C/-31 °C for a short term period or at -80 °C for a long term storage.\nRNA QC (Figure 4A). Check the quality of RNA and the RNA integrity using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and a Nanodrop (Thermo), according to the manufacturer instructions. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) is used to assess the RNA quality. In particular, succeed in the detection of 18S and 28S peaks is strongly recommended to use the samples in further steps.\n4. WT-ovation RNA Amplification\nRecommendations to perform the amplification steps using the WT-Ovation amplification kit in optimal conditions:\nRun no fewer than eight amplification samples at a time to ensure pipetting precision. Then, account for 1 waste volume when preparing master mixes that require a splitting of the kit into 3 batches of 8 reactions.\nAlways keep thawed reagents and reaction tubes on ice unless otherwise instructed.\nUse only a fresh 80% ethanol solution for purification.",

Refer to the standard Affymetrix controls to verify that the HERV-V2 chips meet the QC criteria. For this purpose the following representations can be used: the log intensity value distribution (density plots and box plots), the median absolute deviation (MAD) versus the intensity median (MAD-Med) plots, the background plots, the normalized unscaled standard error (NUSE) plots and the relative log expression (RLE) plots.\nNormalization. In addition, the dataset should be explored to highlight unexpected batch effects and to correct them before statistical analysis. The data preprocessing thus includes a background correction (e.g. based on the tryptophan probe baseline signal), followed by RMA normalization and summarization15.",
    "Data mining and search for differential expressed genes. Normalize the chips and apply a hierarchical clustering approach to explore the dataset (Figure 6A). Then, perform a search for differentially expressed genes (DEG) by using a classical significant analysis of microarray (SAM) procedure16 followed by a false discovery rate (FDR) correction17. Note that these steps are fully integrated in some software analysis suites like Partek GS but can alternatively be performed using the R statistical software18 with packages from the Bioconductor project19. After the statistical analysis, filter the dataset to exclude the probesets for which expression values are less than 26.\nVisualization and interpretation. Interpret the results from the HERV-V2 microarray in a dedicated interface using annotation databases."
