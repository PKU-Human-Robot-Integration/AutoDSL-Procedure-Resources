    "1. Create the Construct Containing the Protein of Interest\nClone the gene expressing the protein of interest into a suitable vector. Use vectors such as the pcDNA series or pRK5 as they are well suited for expression in mammalian systems like HEK293 and CHO cells.\n2. Select the Sites on the Protein to be Tagged with the Fluorophores\nChoose labeling sites that are able to reflect possible conformational changes within the protein. If possible, use a crystal structure of the protein or of a homologous protein to help make this determination. If there is no crystal structure available, use online software to predict the possible structure of the protein and hence receive insight into appropriate sites.\nChoose residues such that the side chains of the selected residues are surface exposed and accessible to the fluorophores so that the protein can be labeled.\n\t\nChoose residues that are not critical to protein function, for example sites that are not involved in ligand binding.\nIn introducing cysteine mutation, give preference to sites that are similar, for example serine, that would cause minimal perturbation to the protein structure.\nAfter choosing the labeling sites, make the mutations to ensure that the protein only gives LRET from these intended sites. Use standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols to mutate away non-disulfide-bonded cysteines that could potentially bind to maleimide-conjugated fluorescent tags. Do not mutate away disulfide-bonded cysteines and buried, free cysteines since they should not react with fluorescent dyes in the folded form of the protein.\nIntroduce cysteine residues in the desired sites by making point mutations using standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols.",
    "Include a protease cleavage site that can specifically cleave off one of the cysteines from the protein. If the protein sequence allows for it, introduce the site by conservatively mutating the protein to have a thrombin (recognition sequence LVPRGS) or Factor Xa (recognition sequence IDGR or IEGR) sequence near the introduced cysteine and accessible to protease cleavage; otherwise the tetra- or hexa-peptide sequence may be inserted as a whole. Choose the site such that upon cleavage one of the introduced cysteines dissociates from the rest of the protein—in certain cases, this may require two cleavage sites flanking a mutated cysteine.\n3. Test the Expression and Functionality of the Protein\nPerform a western blot to confirm expression of the mutated protein.\nPerform a functional assay of the protein to ensure that the mutations have altered the protein function only minimally, if at all, to avoid studying conformational changes of a dysfunctional protein.\n\tNOTE: Since all proteins have different functions, there is no single functional assay that is used specifically for LRET; however, some examples of functional assays include enzyme activity assays for enzymes, ligand-binding assays for receptors, and electrophysiology studies for ion channels.\n4. Select the Fluorophores to be Used\nSelect fluorophores based on the expected distance range being measured such that the range is between 0.5-1x the R0 of the fluorophore pair.\nNOTE: This allows for an easier subtraction of the background, which typically has much longer lifetimes. For example, if the expected distance range being measured is around 35 Å, an appropriate fluorophore pair to use would be terbium chelate as the donor and Alexa 594 as the acceptor, because the R0 for this pair is 53 Å (Table 1).\n5. Express the Protein by Transiently Transfecting the Required Amount of Mammalian Cells",
    "Transiently transfect the protein of interest into the chosen mammalian cells using any of the common transfection reagents. Typically, use four 10-cm dishes per LRET experiment for HEK and CHO cell lines; however, this amount may vary depending on protein expression, stability, etc. Allow the cells to express the protein for 36-48 hr before harvesting.\n6. Label the Proteins\nDetach cells from the culture dish. Detach HEK cells by simply pipetting buffer against the bottom of the dish. Detach CHO cells with a cell scraper, washing off the media with extracellular buffer.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 1,100 x g for 3 min. Use these same centrifuge settings for collecting cells after labeling, as well as after the subsequent washes.\nSuspend cells in 3 ml of extracellular buffer, then add donor and acceptor fluorophores in equimolar amounts up to a final concentration of 100-300 nM. Incubate on a rotator for 1 hr at RT.\nWash these labeled cells 3-4x with extracellular buffer to remove unbound fluorophores, then suspend these cells in extracellular buffer (usually 2 ml) for LRET measurements.\nAs a control, label a separate set of cells with only donor fluorophore (terbium chelate) without addition of any acceptor fluorophore.\n\tNOTE: Data from these donor-only experiments is necessary to complete analysis. These experiments can be done on the same or different days.\nAgain, perform functional validation, this time with labeled mutant protein, as the labeling process may also interfere with function depending on the site used for labeling.\n\tNOTE: These experiments can be done on the same or different days.\n7. Set up the LRET Experiment\nPlace the resuspended cells in a quartz cuvette with a minimum volume of 1 ml.\nTurn on the computer and the instrument and adjust the parameters of the data acquisition program accordingly.",
    "Set the excitation wavelength to the absorbance range of the donor fluorophore (330-340 nm works well for terbium chelate).\nSet the emission wavelength appropriately, keeping in mind that the acceptor emission varies based on the acceptor used. Importantly, select a detection wavelength that measures only the acceptor emission and does not include any bleed-through from the donor’s emission. For example, use a wavelength of 565 nm for Alexa 555 as an acceptor Table 1. For donor-only measurements, in which protein was labeled only with donor but without acceptor, use a wavelength of 545 nm for measuring terbium chelate emission.\nSet the length of emission detection to be at least three times the expected LRET lifetime to ensure that a long-lifetime component will not be missed.\nPerform the scan. Do at least three scans of 99 sweeps to ensure consistency of results. Save the results as a text file (*.txt).\nTo measure conformational changes of a protein with regard to different conditions (such as the addition of a ligand), alter those conditions and again perform at least three scans of 99 sweeps each on the same sample under this new condition. If studying the effects of glutamate on the conformation of glutamate receptors, for example, add glutamate to 1 mM to the same sample scanned in step 7.3, and then scan again.\nAdd up to five units of the appropriate protease and take scans continually until cleavage is complete and no further change is seen in the lifetime for three successive scans. Usually, cleavage is complete in two to 3 hr. If a Factor Xa cleavage site is being used for protease cleavage, for example, add 3 µl of Factor Xa to the sample, and scan every 30 min for 3 hr.\n8. Analyze the Data Obtained",
    "Open the data analysis software.\nLoad the fluorescence lifetime data by using Import ASCII to open the text files. Load all the replicates as well as the final background measurements, into one file.\nAverage the data from all the scans for each experimental condition to get the final data. To do so, highlight the columns that contain the individual trials, then under the Data menu in the menu bar, click on Statistics on Rows to display the average fluorescence intensities from the trials, as well as the standard deviation and standard error.\nPlot the average values as a line graph with fluorescence intensity on the Y-axis and lifetime in microseconds on the X-axis to create a curve that represents the lifetime of the sensitized emission of the acceptor. Change the Y-axis of the plot to a log scale, to allow for better visualization of the data.\nRepeat step 8.3 on the background measurement data, averaging the final scans that show overlap indicating complete cleavage.\nDisplay the mean background data on the same plot that contains the averaged raw data. To do so, open the Layer Control dialog box found under the Plot menu. Then, transfer the data containing the background mean into the list of Layer Contents.\nAlign the mean background data to the mean raw data. To do so, use the Simple Math function under the Math menu to multiply or divide the background data as needed until the tail end of the background overlaps with the tail end of the raw data.\n\tNOTE: At this tail end, the lifetime from the protein of interest should have already completely decayed away; what is aligned is simply the background signal present both before and after protease cleavage.",
    "Subtract the aligned background signal from the initial raw LRET signal, again using the Simple Math function.\nFit the data to an exponential decay (single or multiple exponentials, depending on the sites and the experimental design).\n\t\nSet the start boundary for fitting to begin after the end of the laser pulse. Use this same startpoint for all subsequent curve fittings.\nIn the Select Fitting Function dialog box, select exponential decay so as to fit the lifetime to the following equation for a single exponential decay:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51895/51895eq4.jpg Eq. 4\n\t\twhere, y represents the fluorescence intensity, y0 represents the background intensity due to noise from the system, A1 is the signal intensity, t is the fluorescence lifetime, x is the time, and x0 is the time offset.\nFix x0 to 0, start the Fitting Function, and fit the data.\n\t\tNOTE: If the experiment is designed to have signal only from one pair of sites, the resulting data should easily be fit by a single exponential decay8. The residual of the fit is a good method to determine the goodness of the fit and if additional decay lifetimes are required.\nUse the lifetimes obtained from the data to calculate the distance between fluorophores using the Förster equation (a rearrangement of Equations 1 and 2 above):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51895/51895eq5.jpg Eq. 5\n\tNOTE: All the variables are as mentioned above with τDA having been measured as the sensitized acceptor emission lifetime. Further details and examples on measurements of R0 and R can be found elsewhere7,9,10.",
    "Repeat the experiment and data analysis at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Inconsistency between individual repetitions of the same measurement calls into question the validity of the data; use additional control experiments or repetitions. Calculate errors in measurement using the free Gustavus Error analysis calculator (developed by Dr. Thomas Huber) or a similar system that propagates the error in the fits of the lifetime.\nSubscription Required.
