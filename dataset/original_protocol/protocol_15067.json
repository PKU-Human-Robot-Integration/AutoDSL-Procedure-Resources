    "1. Recruitment\nObtain appropriate Institutional Review Board approval of collection protocol with special attention to consenting subjects with impaired capacity and the collection of biological specimens9-10.\nExclude participants with potential for blood leakage into saliva by assessing oral health (i.e. \"Did you observe bleeding gums in the past two days?\")11.\n2. Preparation of Saliva Collection Supplies\nPrior to scheduling home visit to consented participants, gather and assemble necessary supplies: 4 Salimetrics Children's Swabs (SCS) , 4 swab storage tubes, 4 color-coded tube caps, 5 white labels, 1 plastic zip-lock bag, saliva collection instruction sheet, 5 nitrile gloves, and storage box.\nApply nitrile glove. Using gloved hand, place 4 SCS into 4 storage tubes and cap with yellow, orange, purple, and blue color caps, respectively.\nPlace label on storage tube to indicate time of collection (on awakening- yellow cap, 30 min post awakening-orange cap, mid day before lunch-blue cap, evening before dinner-purple cap).\nPlace the 4 capped storage tubes plus saliva collection instruction sheet and 4 nitrile gloves in zip-lock bag and label bag with subject ID and date of collection.\nSchedule short home visit to subjects previously consented and on day prior to saliva sampling. On arrival to home provide plastic bag of supplies and instruction sheet.\n3. Saliva Collection Instruction\nReview instruction sheet (see Figure 1 for example). Emphasize the need to record start and stop time of saliva collection.\nRecord the name, dosage, and schedule of all prescription and OTC medications taken by the participant within the last 48 hr12.\nInstruct participant to tilt head forward to allow saliva to pool on the floor of mouth.\nInstruct saliva collector (SC) to apply nitrile glove to dominant hand (only required for hand holding swab)9.",
    "Instruct SC to uncap the swab storage tube to retrieve oral swab. Do not remove the basket insert from the tube.\nInstruct SC to place the oral swab under the front of the tongue of the older adult to absorb about 3 drops (75 µl) of pooled saliva, and to HOLD the oral swab in place for 2 min to ensure that it is saturated. Swab will become opaque when saturated.\nHave the SC return the saturated oral swab back into the basket of the swab storage tube and replace the cap.\nHave the SC immediately place tube in storage box and place in freezer. Discard glove in trash bin.\nHave SC record start and stop times on saliva instruction sheet.\n4. Provide Additional Instructions and Answer Questions\nInstruct SC that they will be collecting saliva sample on four occasions the following day. The times of collection are on awakening, 30 min post awakening, mid morning, and evening13,14.\nInstruct SC to avoid sample collection within 1 hr after a major meal.\nHave SC instruct patient to rinse mouth with water 10 min prior to saliva collection.\nDiscard samples visibly contaminated with blood.\nInstruct SC that saliva samples should remain in freezer until retrieved by study team. Confirm that study team will schedule a time and day to retrieve the frozen samples and bring new saliva collection supplies for any future collection date.\n5. Saliva Handling and Processing\nOnce samples are removed from subject's freezer, keep frozen during transport to lab using insulated freezer bag.\nOn arrival to lab, replace white label on tube with sequential barcode.\nConfirm sequential barcode matches subject ID, date of collection, and time of collection.\nReturn saliva sample to freezer (-20 °C) to precipitate the mucins.\n6. Optional: Salivary Cortisol Assay Protocol",
    "Ensure all salivary assay kit reagents are at room temperature.\nAfter thawing saliva samples, vortex and centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 15 min.\nPrepare wash buffer following kit instructions.\nPipette 25 µl of standards and controls into appropriate wells of plate layout. Standards and samples should be assayed in duplicate.\nPipette 200 µl enzyme conjugate into wells.\nMix plate by placing on rotator for 5 min at 500 rpm (then incubate at room temperature for 55 min).\nWash and blot plate with wash buffer 4x.\nAdd 200 µl tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution .\nAgain mix the plate for 5 min at 500 rpm then incubate in the dark for an additional 25 min.\nAdd 50 µl stop solution and mix for 3 min at 500 rpm.\nWithin 10 min of adding stop solution wipe off plate bottom. Read with a plate reader at 450 nm.\nCalculate cortisol concentration using the average optical density. Subtract the average optical density in nonspecific binding wells from the average optical density in zero, standard, control, and sample wells.\nEstimate the concentrations of the controls and unknowns using software capable of logistics.\n7. Optional: Salivary Alpha Amylase Assay Protocol\nSet plate reader to incubate at 37 °C, and read in center measurement kinetic mode at 1 min and 2 min.\nUse 405 nm filter and no reference filter.\nDilute saliva samples with the alpha-amylase diluent provided.\nPrepare 1:200 dilution by first preparing a 1:10 dilution of the saliva by pipetting 10 µl of saliva into 90 µl alpha-amylase diluent. Then, further dilute by pipetting 10 µl of the 1:10 dilution into 190 µl alpha-amylase diluent (1:20).\nHeat alpha-amylase substrate solution to 37 °C using a preheated microtiter plate incubator.\nAdd 8 µl of diluted saliva samples to individual wells.",
    "Simultaneously add 320 µl of preheated (37 °C) alpha-amylase substrate solution.\nFor reading kinetically in 37 °C plate reader, immediately place plate in reader and start reader.\nSubtract 1 min readings from the 3 min reading and multiply by the conversion factor.\nCalculate amylase activity as ΔAbs./min x TV x DF /MMA x SV x LP = U/ml. Where ΔAbs./min = Absorbance difference per minute ; TV = Total assay volume (0.328 ml) ; DF = Dilution factor ;MMA = Millimolar absorptivity of 2-chloro-p-nitrophenol (12.9) ;SV = Sample volume (0.008 ml) ; LP = Light path = 0.97(specific to plate received with kit).\nSubscription Required.
