    "All methods have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cornell University.\n1. Preparation of materials and equipment\nDesign and build the metatarsal loading device for use with an overhead multiphoton microscope.\n\tNOTE: Details for component specifications and device operation are described in the supplementary documentation of a previous study25. Briefly, the major components consist of an actuator in series with a load cell and loading bracket, a water bath, and a fulcrum pin. The actuator and load cell can be obtained commercially and should be capable of accommodating loads up to 300 g. The water bath, fulcrum pin, and load bracket should be constructed of titanium or stainless steel. They can be fabricated in-house or commercially via 3D metal printing.\nCalibrate the strain magnitude values to the actuator displacement in advance for individual mouse groups (i.e., sex, treatment, genotype). This is done using surface strain mapping in a procedure outlined in a previous study25.\nUse mice with C57BL/6 background, aged 16-18 weeks, that express fluorescent calcium indicator constructs in the osteocytes. Osteocyte targeted expression is achieved by crossing flox-activated GCaMP6f and Dmp1-Cre mice. The details of breeding strategies and vendors for founder mice are described in a previously published study25.\nSterilize all surgical tools, load bracket, water bath and fulcrum pin using an autoclave (57.2 °C, 15 psi, 3-4 min). Disinfect microscope objectives with 100% ethanol.\nTurn on electronic components, including laser source, microscope, load cell, and actuator. Allow 15-20 min for each component to warm up prior to intravital imaging.",
    "Make sure the actuator and load cell components are connected and activated in the control device. Generate the control software with a variety of platforms, including Matlab, LabView, and Python, according to the preferences of the user. The main Matlab code used in this study is called Actuator_Control_Software_withLoadCell.m (inside the MT3 Loading Device Control Software.zip folder Supplementary File 1).\n\t\t​NOTE: Most commercially available two-photon microscope systems come with robust imaging software. The key features required for this method are the ability to tune a laser to the appropriate excitation for GCaMP6f (920 nm), the ability to adjust laser power intensity, and a time series collection with a frequency of at least 6 Hz. Prior to experimentation, laser connection to the imaging software and appropriate light path arrangement for two-photon imaging should be confirmed. This is confirmed in different ways depending on the imaging set up. Usually, there is a light indicator.\n2. Surgery\nPrepare a sterile surgical stage and sterilize the surface with 70% ethanol. Ensure that aseptic techniques are employed throughout the surgical procedures.\nAnesthetize the mouse with vaporized isoflurane mixed with medical-grade air or oxygen at a flowrate of 1 L/min. Perform initial anesthetization in a rodent induction chamber with 3%-5% isoflurane. Maintain anesthesia at 1%-2.5% isoflurane in a nose cone for surgical and intravital imaging procedures.\nMonitor the mouse's body temperature with a rectal probe connected to a homeothermic-controlled heating pad (positioned under the anesthetized animal). Monitor the heart rate and oxygen saturation using a rodent pulse oximeter. Keep the breath rate between 60-80 breaths per minute and maintainby adjusting the isoflurane dosage.",
    "Place the mouse in a supine position. Identify the location between the second and third metatarsals. Make a scalpel incision through the dermis between the second and third metatarsals, starting at the distal end and progressing proximally along the length of the bones (~5 mm).\n\tNOTE: The metatarsals are distal to the ankle bones on the paw and follow directly proximal to the distal phalanges. They consist of (medial to lateral) metatarsals I, II, III, IV, and V. The third metatarsal is centered in the middle of the volar aspect of the hind paw.\nUsing forceps, open the surgical site by pulling the skin toward the medial/lateral edges. Resect the extensor tendons using straight Vannas scissors to expose the third metatarsal.\nInsert the center fulcrum pin of the metatarsal loading device beneath the third metatarsal.\n\t\nInitially, insert the pin in the small space at the distal end where the third metatarsal meets the proximal phalange and then move the pin proximally until it rests at the mid-shaft of the third metatarsal.\nTake special care to guarantee a direct interface between the bone and the pin, excluding any muscle and facia. This is critical for stable imaging during loading protocols.\nHold the ankle with forceps and place the foot into theDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) filled water bath (8-10 mL). Secure the paw in place with the loading bracket and connect the bracket to the actuator/load cell arrangement. A completed surgical preparation and arrangement within the device is shown in Figure 1.\n3. Imaging",
    "NOTE: The complete two-photon microscopy setup used in this protocol has two software packages: Chameleon Discovery GUI V2.0.6 for the laser (Figure 2) and ThorImageLS4.0 for the microscope (Figure 3). To image on the two-photon, press Live (Figure 3, blue play button). When conducting an experiment to image and save data, press Capture (Figure 3, the tab at the top, next to Capture Setup). These are specific to the equipment and the vendors used in this experiment, but many alternatives with the necessary specifications found in this protocol (excitation wavelengths, viewable window size, image capture rate, etc.) would also work.\nVery carefully pick up the loading device setup with the mouse and place it onto the microscope platform.\nStart with a low magnification objective in epifluorescence mode (Figure 3, dropdown menu at the top with selections Multiphoton or Fluorescence Setup) to locate and center the mid-diaphysis of the bone.\nAfter a region of interest is located, switch to a higher water immersion objective magnification (20x-40x) and switch the optics to two-photon (Figure 3, dropdown menu at the top with selections Multiphoton or Fluorescence Setup).\n\tNOTE: The recommended field of view size is at least 250 μm x 250 μm for cellular activity and can be achieved with either optical or digital zoom depending on the imaging system.\n\t\nThe suitable minimum pixel density is 512 pixels x 512 pixels. To set the pixel density, use the Galvo/Resonance Area Control settings (Figure 3).\nWhen finding the ROI, avoid photobleaching by reducing the power using the Power Control option (Figure 3,) and increasing the PMT amplification in the Galvo/Resonance Scanner Control settings (Figure 3).\nIdentify the surface of the bone in two-photon mode by looking for the fibrous periosteum autofluorescence in the green channel that uses a bandpass filter centered at 525 nm.",
    "NOTE: The autofluorescence is most visible with the excitation wavelength at 1,000 nm but is also available at 920 nm excitation (Figure 3, Multiphoton Laser Control). This landmark is important for determining the relative depth of the ROI into the metatarsal cortex when observing osteocytes. It should be noted that during time series experiments, the exact depth of the plane imaged is not recorded, although it tends to range between 15-30 µm. If exact depth measurements are desired, then a z-stack would have to be taken.\nRun a test loading bout to ensure the surgical preparation and positioning within the loading device were effective at achieving a stable ROI field (i.e., no z-plane displacement). Briefly, run a loading cycle to appraise the stability of the surgical preparation. Perform loading by running the section Switch on Servo and Move in the Matlab code.\n\t\nApply a small tare load. Ensure that the appropriate haversine wave loading protocols are prepared ahead of time. Input appropriate loading parameters obtained during calibration in section 1.2. Perform loading by running the section Switch on Servo and Move in the Matlab code.\nIf there is a visible movement of the bone during loading, select a different ROI along y- or z- directions to ensure it is directly over the center fulcrum pin. If movement persists, adjust the surgical position of the pin manually underneath the third metatarsal.\n\t\tNOTE: A good region of interest (ROI) is one where the cells do not move in and out of the plane/focus. Movement in the x- and y-directions can be adjusted for post-processing using the template matching plugin on ImageJ.\nConduct z-stack or t-series imaging with loading according to the experimental design to record morphometric or dynamic load-induced signaling events, respectively.",
    "Set the excitation wavelength for the fluorescent indicator (e.g., 920 nm for GCaMP6f). For z-stack, use a low enough resolution to capture features of the osteocytes, such as 0.25-1 μm steps. For t-series, use settings to sample at least 6x the loading rate. For a 1 Hz loading rate, imaging at 6 frames per second (FPS) represents the minimally appropriate capture rate (Figure 3, Galvo/Resonance Scanner Control).\nFor loading and live imaging, collect non-loaded baseline data with each bout. In this study, 60 s of non-loaded imaging followed by 60 s of loading and imaging is preferred. Design the loading and imaging protocols accordingly. To collect data, press Capture (Figure 3, tab at the top, next to Capture Setup).\n\t\t\nThe refractory period for a full calcium signaling response in bone cells is estimated to be approximately 15 min28. Wait at least that long between sequential loading bouts when collecting dynamic signaling data.\nThroughout the entire experiment, do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This is a non-survival protocol meaning that all the animals are euthanized after imaging.\nSubscription Required.
