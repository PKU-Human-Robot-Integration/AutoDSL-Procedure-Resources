    "Plating cells for differentiationPlate 50,000-60,000 osteosarcoma cells per well in 24-well plates in DMEM/10% FBS/ Penicillin-Streptomycin. This can be your cell line of interest too. Change medium according to your cell line of interest.Next day or when they reach confluence (usually in 36 h), switch medium to differentiation medium. Usually cells will not differentiate unless they are at least 80-90% confluent. All differentiation medium is regular DMEM/10% FBS/PS supplemented with the differentiation cocktail indicated in steps 3 and 4.For osteogenesis, use 10 mM beta-glycerol phosphate and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. These are the final concentrations.For adipogenesis, use 10 μg/ml Insulin, 100 nM dexamethasone, 250 μM IBMX and 200 μM Indomethacim. These are the final concentrations. How to make stocks is described later.Feed cells every 2-3 days with fresh differentiation medium made each time during feeding. While feeding make sure Pasteur pipette tip used for aspirating medium does not touch cell layer as cells attach loosely during differentiation, especially during adipogenesis.Stain cells for osteogenesis and adipogenesis at 2, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15 days.Alkaline phosphatase assay to measure osteoblast differentiation.This is a colorimetric assay where the yellow substrate. 4-Benzoylamino-2, 5-dimethoxybenzenediazonium chloride hemi (zinc chloride) salt, Azoic Diazo No. 24 is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase to yield a purple dye precipitate.Prepare fixation solution and staining solution before starting assay. Protect solutions from light fiter preparation.Plate required cells in differentiation medium (usually 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates).Aspirate off medium from cells plated in differentiation medium at designated time.Wash once with 1x PBS. Each washing step involved adding 1x PBS followed by aspiration.Add 1 ml of fixation solution per well and incubate at RT for 1 min.Wash wells with 1x PBS once.Add I ml of staining solution per well.Incubate in the dark for 30 min at RT and check color development.",
    "Development of purple-violet stained areas in well indicates positive reaction. If necessary, continue reaction for another 30 min at RT. Record increased incubation time. Do not exceed 1 h.Stop reaction by washing quickly with dd water or tap water.Do not forget to photograph plates before proceeding to Alizarin red S staining for mineralization.Alizarin red S staining to detect mineralizationAlizarin red S is a calcium-sensing dye. Differentiated osteoblasts deposit large amounts of extracelluar calcium (a hallmark of mineralization) that can be detected by complexing with Alizarin red S. Calcium deposits appear as bright orange-red stained areas.After photographing the plates stained for alkaline phosphatase, proceed to Alizarin red S staining by washing the stained plated twice with 1x PBS whose pH has been adjusted to 4.2 with 0.1% NH4OH.Aspirate the PBS and add enough Alizarin red S staining solution to cover the cellular monolayer. Incubate the plate at RT in the dark for 45 min.Carefully aspirate the Alizarin red S solution and wash the plate fours time wits distilled water.Extracellular calcium deposits appear as brightly stained orange-red areas.Oil red O staining assay to measure adipogenic differentiationThis staining assay is based on the principle that the lipophilic dye Oil Red O is retained in fat globules of adipocytes that can be seen under a microscope.Aspirate medium and wash cells once in PBS.Fix cells in 4% PFA at RT for 15 min.Wash twice with ddH2O for 2 x 5 min.Stain with Oil-Red-O working solution for 15 min at RT.Wash with 1x PBS or ddH2O for 3 x 5 min.Rinse cells with 50% isopropanol once at RT.Rinse cells with 1x PBS or ddH2O.The red stained lipid droplets can be visualized by light microscopy. The adipocytes are also readily visualized in normal microscopy through their rounded morphology and markedly enhanced light reflection of larger lipid droplets.",
    "To count total cells, stain with Mayer's HemTox stain for 15 min at RT and wash 2x with dd water."
