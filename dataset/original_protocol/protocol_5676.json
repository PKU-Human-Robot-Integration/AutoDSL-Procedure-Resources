    "Day 1Bacteria are cultured overnight in 3 ml of LB from -80 °C glycerol stock or a colony on an LB agar plate at 37 °C with shaking (220 rpm). HeLa cells are dispensed in a black 96-well tissue culture plate with transparent bottom (1.5 x 104 cells/well) and grown for 24 h in 200 μl HeLa cell culture medium (see Recipes) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.Note: Importantly, don’t dispense any cells in the two bottom-left wells (see Figure 1: plate infection scheme). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314181329_5884.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of plate infection example. Bacteria are inoculated in the two first rows in duplicate (in 200 μl/well of DMEM-HEPES medium), at an MOI of 50 and then 2-fold serially diluted (by successively transferring 100 μl to the rows below). The final volume is 100 μl. The left column is kept for the controls (red wells column).Day 2Bacterial preparationBacteria are sub-cultured by diluting 50 µl of the overnight culture in 5 ml of DMEM-HEPES medium (i.e., 1:100 dilution) and grown at 37 °C with agitation (220 rpm) until an average OD600nm = 0.6. The number of bacteria per ml is determined by measuring the OD600nm of 1 ml of the culture.Note: The typical value for E. coli is 1 unit of the OD600nm corresponds to 5 x 108 bacteria/ml. HeLa cells preparationBefore infection, eukaryotic cells are cautiously washed once with pre-warmed (37 °C) HBSS. 100 μl of DMEM-HEPES medium is added in all the wells, except the 2 first rows, corresponding to the highest number of bacteria per cell (maximum multiplicity of infection or MOI) where 200 μl of DMEM-HEPES medium is added (Figure 1).",
    "Infection assayAfter determination of the multiplicity of infection (MOI = number of bacteria per HeLa cell at the onset of the infection), the appropriate number of bacteria is added in the first 2 rows of the plate (containing 200 μl DMEM-HEPES medium).2-fold serial dilution is performed to create an infectious dose-effect, in a final DMEM-HEPES medium volume of 100 μl (Figure 1). Note: As an example, for an MOI of 50, add 50 x 1.5 x 104 = 75 x 104 bacteria for a well containing 1.5 x 104 HeLa cells. The number of dispensed cells is taken into account for the MOI calculation.The plate is incubated for 4 h in a cell culture incubator.End of the infection and post-infection incubationAfter infection of 4 h, the absorbance at 600 nm is measured with a microplate reader, to monitor bacterial growth. The typical values obtained are around 0.2-0.3 for MOI 50.Then, cells are washed carefully at least 3 times with an increasing volume of pre-warm (37 °C) HBSS (100 μl, 150 μl and finally 200 μl). The plate is observed under an inverted microscope to check whether most of the bacteria are removed. If required, additional washes can be performed. Finally, cells are incubated in 200 μl cell culture medium (see Recipes) for 3 h with 200 mg/ml gentamicin in a cell culture incubator.Cells fixationThe cells are washed carefully in cold PBS (100 μl) three times. 100 μl fixation solution (see Recipes) is added for 20 min under a chemical safety hood. Paraformaldehyde neutralizationAfter the fixation step, cells are washed with PBS (100 μl per well), for 5 min under rapid agitation (variable speed shaker, 20-25 rpm). This washing step is repeated 3 times.",
    "Then, the paraformaldehyde is neutralized by adding 50 μl of neutralization solution (see Recipes) for 2 min under slow agitation (3-5 rpm). Cells permeabilizationThe cells are washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS, 100 μl per well, under rapid agitation (20-25 rpm) as previously (Step 6). Then cells are permeabilized with cold permeabilization solution (see Recipes), 50 μl per well for 5 min, under slow agitation. Blocking stepCells are washed 3 times with PST buffer (see Recipes), 100 μl per well, under agitation (20-25 rpm).Then, 50 μl/well of blocking solution (see Recipes) is added, and the plate is incubated at room temperature for 60 min under agitation (3-5 rpm). Anti-γ-H2AX immunostaining stepBefore immunostaining, cells are washed with PST buffer 3 times, 100 μl for 5 min under agitation (20-25 rpm). 25 μl per well of anti-γ-H2AX solution (see Recipes) is added and the plate is incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (in that case, the plate has to be sealed carefully with Parafilm to avoid drying), under agitation (3-5 rpm). Note: This solution is not added in the controls A and C (Figure 1), 25 μl of PST buffer is added instead during the incubation time. Secondary detection stepCells are first washed 3 times with PST buffer, 100 μl per well for 5 min under agitation (20-25 rpm). Secondary detection is carried out using an infrared fluorescent dye conjugated IRDyeTM 800CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies absorbing at 800 nm (1/1,000) in PST buffer. For DNA labeling, 1/1,000 dilution of RedDotTM2 in PST is used together with the secondary antibody (see secondary antibody solution in Recipes), 25 μl per well in every well of the plate. The plate is incubated in the dark for 1 h under agitation (3-5 rpm).",
    "Plate scanning stepThe plate is washed 3 times in PST buffer, 100 μl per well for 5 min under agitation (20-25 rpm) in obscurity (covered with aluminum foil). Then, the plate is dried by reversing and patting it delicately on a tissue. The DNA and the γ-H2AX were simultaneously visualized using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging Scanner with the 680 nm fluorophore (red color) and the 800 nm fluorophore (green dye), respectively (Figure 3A).Note: Once the plate dried (Step 11b), it can be conserved several months, at 4 °C protected from the light, upside down, before visualization."
