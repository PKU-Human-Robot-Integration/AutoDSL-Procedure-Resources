    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Michigan.\n1. Generation of Brain Tumor Neurospheres Derived from a Mouse Model\nBefore the dissection procedure, prepare neural stem cell media (NSC Media: DMEM/F12 with 1x B27 supplement, 1x N2 supplement, 1x normocin, and 1x antibiotic/antimycotic supplemented with human recombinant EGF and basic-FGF at concentrations of 20 ng/mL each). Fill a 1.5 mL tube with 300 µL of NSC media and reserve for later.\nSelect a mouse with a large tumor.\n\tNOTE: The size of a tumor can be monitored by bioluminescence if the plasmid or virus injected encodes luciferin. Usually, a large tumor has a bioluminescence of > 106 photons/s/cm2/sr.\nEuthanize the mouse with an overdose of isoflurane: infuse a tissue paper with isoflurane and introduce the tissue in a euthanization chamber, avoiding direct contact with the mice to prevent irritation. Wait until the mice do not show a pedal reflex (usually 5-10 min). Decapitate the mouse and dissect the brain as described in Calinescu et al.13.\nIf the tumors are fluorescent, use a dissecting microscope equipped with a fluorescent lamp to identify the tumor mass within the brain. With fine forceps, dissect the tumor (usually 5-7 mm in diameter) from the normal brain tissue.\nPlace the dissected tumor in the 1.5 mL tube with NSC media (step 1.1). Homogenize the tumor with a disposable plastic pestle that fits into the walls of the microcentrifuge tube by applying gentle pressure.\nTo dissociate the cell clumps, add 1 mL of enzyme-free dissociation media and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer and wash the strainer with 20 mL of NSC media.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, decant the supernatant, and re-suspend the pellet into 6 mL or 15 mL of NSC media, depending on the size of the pellet.\nPlate the tumor cell suspension into a T-25 or T-75 culture flask and culture at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\nAfter 3 days, transfer the healthy suspended NS and re-plate them into a T-25 or T-75 tissue culture flask. If necessary, add more NSC media to the culture.\n\tNOTE: There will usually be a mixed population of cells, some will be dead, some will have adhered, and some will be forming NS that will be floating in the media\n2. Maintaining and Passaging the NS\nNOTE: Prevent overgrowth and maintain cells at relatively high density. Confluence is determined by spheres size (black centers of large spheres mean overgrowth). The growth rate of the NS will depend on the oncogenes used to generate tumors.\nOnce the NS culture has reached confluency, collect the culture in a sterile centrifuge tube and pellet the NS at 300 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 1 mL of the cell detachment solution, and pipette to re-suspend the pellet.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 5 min, flicking the tube every 2 min to help cell dissociation.\n\tNOTE: When NS reach confluency, they can be usually seen macroscopically as small white spheres. To assure cell dissociation, at least all the visible NS must have disappeared.\nAdd 5 mL of HBSS 1x and pipette several times. Pellet cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the pellet in 5 mL of NSC media supplemented with recombinant EGF and basic-FGF.",
    "Add 1 mL of cells to 15 mL of NSC media and culture in a T-75 flask at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\nAdd growth factors (EGF and basic-FGF) every 3 days. If the media turns light orange and the cells are not yet confluent, change the media. To do this, centrifuge the NS at 300 x g for 4 min and re-suspend in NSC media supplemented with growth factors.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the size of the pellet formed, cells may need to be split into more flasks.\n3. Freezing NS for Long-term Storage\nWhen the NS culture becomes confluent, dissociate the cells as described in steps 2.1-2.4. Once the pellet has been re-suspended in HBSS, remove an aliquot and count the cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 x g for 4 min and remove as much as possible of the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the pellet in freezing media (heat-inactivated FBS, 10% DMSO). It is recommended to freeze between 1 x 106 and 3 x 106 cells per vial per mL.\nDivide the re-suspended cells in as many cryovials as needed and slowly cool down the vials by first transferring them to ice, then to -20 °C, then to -80 °C, and finally the next day to a liquid nitrogen storage container.\n4. Fixation of Tumor NS\nCulture tumor NS in a T-25 flask for 2-3 days until cells are confluent (~ 3 x 106 cells). Collect tumor NS in a 15 mL conical tube from a least one T-25 confluent flask. Pellet at 300 x g for 5 min.",
    "Re-suspend the pellet in 1 mL of 10% formalin and keep at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. Add 5 mL of 1x HBSS and pellet the cells as done in step 3.2. Repeat this step one more time.\nPlace the 15 mL conical tube containing the pellet on ice.\n5. Paraffin Embedding of Tumor NS\nRe-suspend the washed NS pellet in 500 µL of 2% warm liquid agarose and mix gently by pipetting.\nImmediately place the agarose-embedded NS on ice until the agarose polymerizes. Remove the agarose piece harboring the NS. Place the polymerized agarose piece with the NS into the cassette for tissue processing (Figure 2).\nContinue with tissue processing (using an automatic paraffin processor) and paraffin embedding (using an embedding station).\n6. Sectioning of Paraffin-embedded NS\nSet the water bath to 42 °C and insert the blade on the microtome carefully using two paint brushes to make sure it is leveled. Use this blade only for trimming.\nPlace the paraffin block on the microtome. With the non-dominant hand, press down on the lever located on left-hand side that controls the thickness of each section. Press to the second stop that indicates a 30 µm thickness.\nBegin trimming the block (i.e., removing excess paraffin) by turning the coarse hand wheel with the right hand until the surface of the sample is reached. At this point, release the lever that controls the trim thickness to either 10 μm or 5 μm. Stop trimming when the surface of the sample is reached.\nFill an ice box with ice and add just enough water so that when the paraffin block is placed on ice, the water acts as a film around the paraffin block, protecting it from directly touching the ice. Incubate the paraffin block on ice for 20 min.",
    "Discard the old blade and insert a new one for sectioning. Dry block using gauze, then place it on the microtome.\nWith the non-dominant hand, obtain a pair of curved forceps that will be used to pull the paraffin ribbon. Keep a damp paint brush near the right hand, which will be used to transfer the paraffin ribbon to the water bath. Begin to section by turning the coarse hand wheel with the right hand at a fast pace. Use the forceps in the left hand to hold the paraffin ribbon.\nUse the damp paint brush to transfer the paraffin ribbon to the water bath.\nUse the curve of the forceps to break apart the sections by superficially placing the forceps in between two paraffin sections, then pushing the two sections away gently.\n\tNOTE: This motion should be entirely on the surface of the paraffin section. Do not press down on the section.\nUse the damp paint brush to push the separated paraffin sections onto positively charged adhesion microscope slides.\nAllow the slides to dry overnight inside a chemical hood before storing them in slide boxes. The storage of slides depends on the type of stain performed.\n7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of Paraffin-embedded NS\nMelt paraffin by placing the slides in a metal rack and incubating them at 60 °C for 20 min.\nDeparaffinize the slides by incubation in a rehydration train at RT: 3x xylene for 5 min, 100% 2x ethanol for 2 min, 95% 2x ethanol for 2 min, 70% 1x ethanol for 2 min, and 1x deionized water for 2 min. Hereon, keep the slides in tap water until antigen retrieval, as drying out will cause non-specific antibody binding.",
    "Incubate the slides in citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% non-ionic detergent, pH 6) at 125 °C for 30 s and at 90 °C for 10 s. Let them cool down, then rinse the slides 5 times with distilled water.\nIncubate slides at RT in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min.\nWash the slides 3 times in washing buffer (0.025% detergent in TBS) for 5 min with gentle agitation.\nIncubate the slides at RT with blocking solution (10% horse serum, 0.1% BSA in TBS) for 30 min.\nIncubate the slides overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody prepared in dilution solution (0.1% BSA in TBS). Wash the slides 3 times in washing buffer for 5 min with gentle agitation.\nIncubate the slides at RT for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibody prepared in dilution solution. Wash the slides 3 times in washing buffer for 5 min with gentle agitation.\nIncubate the slides at RT in the dark for 30 min with avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex. Wash the slides 3 times in washing buffer for 5 min with gentle agitation.\nIncubate the slides with DAB-H2O2 substrate brands here for 2-5 min at RT.\nRinse 3 times with tap water. Dip (1-2 s) the slides in hematoxylin solution to counterstain, and rinse them thoroughly in tap water until clearing.\nDehydrate the slides as follows: incubate in distilled water for 2 min, dip 3 times in 80% ethanol, incubate in 95% ethanol 2 times for 2 min each, incubate in 100% ethanol 2 times for 2 min each, and finally in xylene 3 times for 3 min each.",
    "Coverslip the slides with a xylene-based mounting medium and let them dry on a flat surface at RT until they are ready for imaging.       NOTE: If performing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, the slides can be stored at RT. However, if immunofluorescence staining is performed, slides should be stored in the dark at -20 °C to reduce photo-bleaching.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
