    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol includes three major steps:\nPerform an ESC differentiation into embryoid bodies.\nAnalyze the differentiation outcome to identify an extraembryonic differentiation defect using molecular and cellular approaches.\nCharacterize the identified defect using a directed differentiation protocol of mESCs into extraembryonic endoderm. We recommend doing this series of in vitro experiments before attempting in vivo approaches.\nEmbryoid Body Differentiation\nTiming: 10 days\nThe embryoid body differentiation protocol is classically used to spontaneously differentiate mESCs into the three embryonic germ layers (Robertson, 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Keller, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), but is rarely used to assess extraembryonic endoderm defects. The first steps of the procedure are similar to the previously described protocol (Bodak and Ciaudo, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), with minor changes consisting on non-plating back the cells on adherent gelatin-coated plates, allowing the cellular analysis described further.\nStart the EB differentiation with 80% confluent mESC T25 flask (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPrepare a T75 gelatin-coated flask– add 2 mL of 0.2% gelatin to a T75 flask and incubate at 37°C minimum 15 min before adding cells.\nNote: Make sure to distribute the gelatin on the whole surface of the flask by tapping and tipping the flask.\nHarvest mESCs by first pouring out the ESC medium. Then, wash gently the cells 1 time with 3 mL PBS 1× by tilting the T25 flask\nDiscard the PBS 1× and add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA before to incubate 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 3 mL MF culture medium to the flask and dissociate into individual cells by pipetting up and down with a 5 mL pipette.\nTransfer 2 mL of cell suspension into 2 × 15 mL Falcons (Falcons A and B) and centrifuge 5 min at 182 × g.\nFalcon A is used to amplify undifferentiated mESCs to collect dry pellets (sample day0):",
    "Remove the gelatin from the T75 flask.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from falcon A and resuspend the pellet in 12 mL of mESC medium.\nDissociate into individual cells by pipetting up and down with a 10 mL pipette.\nTransfer the cells in the T75 flask and Incubate at 37°C, 8% CO2.\nChange the culture media the next morning, by pouring out the ESC medium and replace it with 12 mL of fresh ESC medium.\nWhen the T75 flask is 80%–90% confluent wash 1 time with 4 mL PBS 1×.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 4 mL MF culture medium to flask and dissociate into individual cells by pipetting up and down with a 5 mL pipette.\nTransfer cells to 15 mL Falcon and centrifuge 5 min at 182 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the cells in 3 mL PBS 1×.\nTransfer to labeled 3 × 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (mESCs day0).\nCentrifuge 182 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant.\nFreeze dry pellet at −80°C.\nPause Point: The collected pellets can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nAnnotate under the hood 2× Petri dishes (10 cm): EB day6 and EB day10.\nCritical: The petri dishes are not cell culture treated (we use bacterial petri dishes). The cells here should not attach to the dish in order to form aggregates.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nFalcon B is used to start the EB differentiation and obtain the samples day6 and day10:\nCarefully remove the supernatant from falcon B and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of MF medium.\nDissociate into individual cells by pipetting up and down with a 10 mL pipette.",
    "Transfer the cells in the two petri dishes (5 mL each) and add to each dish 5 mL of MF medium for a total of 10 mL of medium.\nIncubate at 37°C, 8% CO2.\nCritical: Do not manipulate the petri dishes during the 3 first days of the differentiation to let the cells aggregate properly.\nAt day 3 of differentiation change the medium of the 2 petri dishes.\nWith a 10 mL pipette, transfer gently the medium and bodies into a 15 mL falcon.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh MF medium into the 2 petri dishes.\nWait 10 min that the EB sediment at the bottom of the falcon tube.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh MF medium into the falcon tubes and transfer back the EBs in their original petri dishes.\nNote: Repeat the medium replacement every 2–3 days depending on the acidification of the medium. Keep checking the cells every day and change the medium if you observe a color change toward light orange-yellow.\nAt days 6 and 10, collect EBs for molecular characterization:\nWith a 10 mL pipette, transfer the medium and bodies into a 15 mL falcon.\nCentrifuge at 182 × g for 5 min.\nGently resuspend the cells in 2–3 mL PBS 1×.\nTransfer to labeled 2–3 × 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (mESCs day6 or day10).\nCentrifuge 182 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant.\nFreeze dry pellet at −80°C.\nPause Point: The collected pellets can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nMolecular and Cellular Characterization of EBs",
    "The molecular characterization of the EBs will allow the identification of differentiation defects from the three embryonic germ layers. If a defect is observed for endoderm markers, a cellular characterization of the EBs is necessary to distinguish between extraembryonic endoderm and definitive endoderm defects as both endoderm layers share the same molecular markers.\nMolecular Characterization of EBs\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThe expression of three germ layers markers is analyzed by RT-qPCR.\nPreviously collected frozen pellets are directly used for RNA extraction.\nNote: The methods of RNA extraction and reverse transcription are not specific. Step-by-step protocols used in the laboratory has been already described in (Bodak & Ciaudo 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We usually perform the reverse transcription reaction using 1–2 μg of RNA.\nPerform quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the following markers (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to assess ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm formation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_203_4.csv\nExample of qPCR reaction 1×\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_203_5.csv\nExample of settings for qPCR\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_203_6.csv\nNote: We performed qPCR on a LightCycler® 480 instrument (Roche, Penzberg). To analyze the qPCR, we calculate the differences between samples and controls using the 2-ΔCT method and we use Rrm2 transcript as a normalizer. The expression level of each marker in differentiated cells is calculated relative to its respective non-differentiated control sample.\nAnalyze your qPCR results as presented in “Quantification and Statistical Analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]” section (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nAnticipated results for the molecular characterization of EBs are presented in the “Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section.\nCellular Characterization of EBs\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe cellular characterization of the EBs will allow the identification of a specific extraembryonic differentiation defect.\nPrepare the solutions.",
    "PFA 4% solution. You can purchase concentrated liquid PFA to dissolve in PBS 1× or start from powder. To prepare 100 mL of 4% PFA solution in PBS 1× from powder, dissolve 4 g of PFA in 80 mL of PBS 1× under the hood on a stir plate at 60°C. Add 1 N NaOH to rise the pH dropwise until the solution clears. Then adjust the pH to 6.9 with HCL. Fill with PBS 1× to 100 mL.\nCritical: Formaldehyde is toxic. Please read the MSDS before working with this chemical. Gloves and safety glasses should be worn and solutions made inside a fume hood.\nPBS/0.25% Triton X-100: add 500 μL of Triton 10% in 20 mL of PBS 1×.\nPBT: PBS/0.1% Triton X-100.\nBlocking solution: 10% fetal calf serum, 3% normal donkey serum (if secondary antibodies were made in donkey, otherwise use goat serum, …), 1% (w/v) BSA in PBT.\nPerform an EB differentiation until day 10 (see embryoid body differentiation protocol above).\nOn day 10, fix the bodies 16–24 h in 4% PFA in PBS 1×, at 4°C:\nWith a 10 mL pipette, transfer the medium and bodies in a falcon 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge 182 × g for 5 min.\nGently resuspend the cells in 10 mL of 4% PFA and place them at 4°C 16–24 h.\nCryoprotect the EBs with PBS containing 30% (w/v) sucrose:\nNote: The addition of cryoprotectants such as sucrose prevent the formation of ice crystal that would damage tissue morphology. A direct transfer of the sample into 30% sucrose will also alter tissue morphology because of too great difference in osmalorality. Therefore, concentration of sucrose must be increased progressively.\nLet EBs decant for 5 min, gently remove the supernatant and add 10 mL of PBS 1×.",
    "Place on a tilting shaker for 10 min.\nRepeat steps a and b 3 times.\nCritical: Perform all manipulations inside a fume hood until the moment when EBs are in the second PBS 1× wash solution. PFA and first PBS 1× wash solution containing traces of PFA should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.\nIncrease progressively sucrose concentration by removing about 5 mL of PBS 1× and replacing it with the same volume of 30% sucrose solution.\nPlace on a tilting shaker for 10–15 min until equilibration (bodies should float before equilibration and easily decant after).\nRepeat steps d and e 3–4 times.\nEmbed in OCT compound and section using a cryostat:\nPlace a Pyrex beaker in a Styrofoam container and fill it with isopentane up to about 10 cm.\nSlowly add some dry ice pellets in the beaker and wait a few minutes until the pellets stop bubbling vigorously.\nCritical: Isopentane is highly flammable and all manipulations should be performed inside a fume hood. Wear gloves and protectives glasses when manipulating dry ice.\nTransfer EBs into in a small cryomold using a P1000 and a cut tip and remove sucrose solution as much as possible.\nFill the mold with OCT and gather EBs with a tip.\nCarefully plunge the mold in cold isopentane and hold until the OCT is frozen.\nRemove sample from mold and place into tin foil in the cryostat chamber for 1 h to allow the temperature of the sample to equilibrate with that of the cryostat.\nSection the EBs at 12 μm using the cryostat.\nMount sections onto SuperFrost Plus histological slides.\nPause Point: The embedded EBs and the sections can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nImmunostaining of frozen EBs sections:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_203_7.csv",
    "Note: Most primary and secondary antibodies (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) are used between 0.5 and 5 μg/μL respectively. Choose carefully the fluorophore coupled secondary antibody depending on specie of the primary antibody or of the combination of primary antibodies you wish to use. In case of multiplexing verify the compatibility of fluorophores.\nDry sections 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDraw incubation chambers with a Dakopen.\nPlace the slide 5 min in a container filled with PBS 1× to rehydrate the sections. We use a 5 slides transport box filled with 10 mL PBS 1×.\nPermeabilize with PBS/0.25% Triton X-100 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash 3 × 5 min in PBT and incubate with blocking solution for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 40–100 μL of primary antibody diluted in blocking solution in each incubation chamber and gently cover with parafilm avoiding air bubbles.\nIncubate 1.5 h at 20°C–25°C (can be extended 16–24 h at 4°C) in the dark in a humidified chamber.\nWash 3 × 5 min with PBT and incubate with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution 1 h at 20°C–25°C in a humidified chamber.\nWash 2 × 5 min with PBT, 1 × 5 min with PBS containing Hoescht (10 μg/mL) and 2 × 5 min with PBS 1×.\nQuickly rinse in distilled water, add a drop of Vectashield on sections and careful place a coverslip on top avoiding air bubbles.\nAbsorb residual liquid on slide and coverslip and seal with nail polish.\nObserve under a fluorescent microscope.\nPause Point: The sealed slides can be stored in the dark at 4°C for several weeks.\nAnticipated results for the cellular characterization of EBs are presented in the “Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]” section.\nExtraembryonic Endoderm Differentiation and Molecular Characterization",
    "The protocol for ExEn differentiation presented here is based on a previously published protocol paper (Niakan et al. 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The differentiation conditions (medium containing activin A and low doses of Retinoic Acid) are the same as previously published. Our contribution consisted on implementing a differentiation time course using different amounts of cells (Ngondo et al 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nExEn Differentiation\nTiming: 10 days\nmESCs are converted to ExEn cells by treating them with Activin A and low concentrations of retinoic acid.\nNote: The Extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) differentiation is performed in 6 well plate but can be scale up if needed.\nPrepare a 0.2% gelatin-coated 6 well plate.\nStart with an 80% confluent mESC T25 flask (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nHarvest mESCs by first pouring out the old ESC medium and wash the cells by tilting gently with 3 mL of PBS 1×.\nDiscard the PBS 1× and add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA before to incubate 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 3 mL MF culture medium to the flask and dissociate into individual cells by pipetting up and down with a 5 mL pipette.\nCount the cells.\nFor a time-course differentiation, we recommend to start with different amounts of cells for the various time points.\nNote: If the cells are too confluent before reaching the collection day, try to seed less cells for these time points. Do not passage the cells during the differentiation time course to avoid introducing a selection bias.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nAliquot the cells in 15 mL falcon tubes. The cells from each tube will be transferred into a 6-well.\nCentrifuge 182 × g, 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 2 mL of ExEn medium.\nRemove the gelatin from the 6-well plate.\nTransfer the cells.\nIncubate at 37°C, 8% CO2.",
    "Change the medium every two days by pouring out the medium using an aspiration pipet on the edge of the well and replace it with 2 mL of freshly prepared ExEn medium.\nNote: A lot of cell death is normally observed within the first 3 days. To eliminate the maximum of dead cells, tilt gently the plate to resuspend the floating cells before pouring out the old medium.\nNote: Visual observation of ExEn cells can give you an indication of the success or the failure of the differentiation. As previously control wild-type cells should be used as a reference. After 4–5 days of differentiation, ExEn colonies should start appearing. They are easily distinguishable from the other cells because of their epithelial morphology. A photograph of an ExEn colony after 9 days of differentiation is presented Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/203-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
