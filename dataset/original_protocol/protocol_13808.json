    "Human donor eyes were obtained from the Aachen Cornea Bank of the Department of Ophthalmology (University Hospital RWTH Aachen) after obtaining informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki protocols. Procedures for the collection and use of human samples have been approved by the institutional ethics committee.\n1. Isolation of primary human RPE cells\nLay out sterile protective clothing and gloves. Place a sterile drape under a laminar flow.\nPlace sterile preparation instruments and other necessary sterile equipment under the laminar flow.\nRecord the receipt of the eye globes, the beginning of the preparation as well as possible abnormalities. Register donor age, gender, cause of death, and the period between time of death and eye removal.\nPlace the eye globe in a sterile gauze compress and hold it in one hand.\nSeparate the anterior segment from the posterior segment by a circumferential cut approximately 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus using a scalpel and an extra fine pointed eye scissor.\nAfter tilting the posterior segment downwards, carefully remove the vitreous and the retina using colibri forceps.\nDiscreetly rearrange the collapsed RPE/choroidea complex using straight iris forceps and subsequently hold it in position with curved iris forceps.\nFill the posterior eye cup with 1 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mixture (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 80 U/mL penicillin and 80 µg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep), and 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B (AmphoB).\n\t​NOTE: Contrary to the isolation of primary RPE cells from pig or bovine eyes36,37, the posterior eye cup doesn't have to be filled and incubated with trypsin.",
    "Harvest the RPE cells by gently brushing the retinal pigment epithelium from the optic nerve toward the limbus with a fire-polished curved glass Pasteur pipette, while fixating the RPE/choroidea complex at the limbus using colibri forceps. Transfer the cell suspension into a Petri dish.\nRepeat the steps 1.8 and 1.9 and collect all cells in the Petri dish. Resuspend the cell suspension carefully by pipetting up and down using a single channel pipette (100-1,000 µL).\nSeed the RPE cell suspension of each eye globe into three wells of a 24-well cell culture plate and fill them up to 1 mL with DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS, Pen/Strep, and AmphoB.\nMaintain the RPE cell cultures at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 until confluence is reached. Change the cell culture medium twice a week.\n2. Electroporation of primary human RPE cells\nPreparation of the SB100X transposase/PEDF transposon plasmid mixture\nPurify the SB100X transposase and PEDF transposon plasmid DNA using customary plasmid purification kits, which are identified to be suitable for the use in applications such as transfection, according to the protocol of the manufacturer.\nQuantify the plasmid DNA contents using a microvolume spectrophotometer and adjust them to a concentration of 250 ng/µL with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).\nMix one portion of 250 ng/µL SB100X transposase plasmid DNA (e.g., 2.5 µL) with 16 portions of 250 ng/µL PEDF transposon plasmid DNA (e.g., 40 µL). Residual plasmid mixture can be stored at -20 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: Multiple repeated freezing and thawing cycles of the plasmid mixture should be avoided.\nPlace 2 µL of the SB100X transposase/PEDF transposon plasmid mixture, containing 29.4 ng of SB100X transposase plasmid and 470.6 ng of PEDF transposon plasmid, in a sterile 1.5 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube. Keep on ice until mixed with cells.",
    "Set-up of the capillary transfection system\n\tNOTE: Electroporation of primary human RPE cells has been performed via a capillary transfection system using the 10 µL kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The system comprises the transfection device, the transfection pipette, and the pipette station. The kit contains 10 µL transfection tips, buffer tubes, electrolytic buffer E (buffer E), and resuspension buffer R (buffer R).\n\t\nConnect the pipette station to the transfection device.\nFill a buffer tube with 3 mL of buffer E and insert it into the pipette station until a click sound is heard.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the side electrode of the buffer tube is connected to the side ball plunger of the pipette station.\nFor the electroporation of primary human RPE cells, set the following pulse conditions on the transfection device: 1,100 V (pulse voltage), 20 ms (pulse width), two pulses (pulse number).\nPreparation of the cultivated primary human RPE cells\nDocument shape and morphology of the primary RPE cell cultures via phase contrast microscopy. Take low magnification micrographs to demonstrate the growth of the RPE cells to a confluent and integrated monolayer as well as higher magnification micrographs to point out the typical cobblestone morphology of the RPE cells.\nAspirate the cell culture medium and wash the cells twice with 1 mL buffered phosphate saline (PBS, pH 7.4).\nTrypsinize primary human RPE cells with 0.5 mL 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 7-15 min (maximum). Check the cell detachment microscopically.\nStop trypsinization with 1 mL of DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS. Take a 20 µL aliquot for cell counting using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the RPE cell suspension at 106 x g for 10 min.",
    "Mix the 20 µL aliquot with 20 µL trypan blue solution. Pipette 10 µL in each half of the hemocytometer and count the cells under a phase contrast microscope.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend the RPE cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS.\nTake 10,000-100,000 RPE cells per transfection reaction and centrifuge them at 106 x g for 10 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: Beside the transfection reactions with electric field application and addition of plasmid DNA, each approach also includes two different control cultures: (1) without electric field application and without plasmid DNA; (2) with electric field application, but without plasmid DNA.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 11 µL of buffer R and combine it with 2 µL of the SB100X transposase/PEDF transposon plasmid mixture (see step 2.1.4).\n\t\t​NOTE: After resuspension in buffer R, the cells must be processed within 15 min to avoid a reduction in cell viability and transfection efficiency.\nInsert the head of the transfection pipette into the 10 µL transfection tip until the clamp fully picks up the mounting stem of the piston. Draw up the cell/plasmid solution into the transfection tip.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid generation of air bubbles and their aspiration into the transfection tip.\nProvide 1 mL of DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS, but without Pen/Strep and without AmphoB, into the required number of wells of a 24-well cell culture plate.\nElectroporation process\nInsert the transfection pipette into the buffer tube placed in the pipette station (see step 2.2.2) until a click sound is heard.\n\t\t​NOTE: Ensure the metal head of the transfection pipette is connected to the ball plunger inside of the pipette station and to the buffer tube.",
    "Press Start on the touchscreen of the transfection device. Before application of the electric pulse, the device automatically checks whether the buffer tube and the transfection pipette are properly inserted. After delivery of the electric pulses, Complete is displayed on the touchscreen.\nCarefully remove the transfection pipette from the pipette station and immediately release the electroporated cells from the 10 µL transfection tip by pipetting the cell/plasmid solution into the prepared wells of the cell culture plate (see step 2.3.10).\nMaintain transfected RPE cell cultures at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Add Pen/Strep and AmphoB with the first medium exchange 3 days after electroporation.\n3. Analyses of transfected primary human RPE cells\nSample preparation\nAfter a cultivation time of 3 weeks, ultimately incubate the RPE cell cultures in a defined volume of 1.0 mL DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS, Pen/Strep, and AmphoB for a defined time of 24 h.\nTake the cell culture supernatants and store them at -20 °C until further near-time processing or at -80 °C for thermally unstable samples and long-term storage.\nTrypsinize transfected RPE cell cultures with 0.5 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nStop trypsinization with 1 mL of DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS. Take small aliquots for cell counting using a hemocytometer (see step 2.3.5). Centrifuge the RPE cell suspensions at 106 x g for 10 min.\nStore the RPE cell pellets at -80 °C until further processing.\nEvaluation of PEDF secretion by western blotting\n\tNOTE: For a qualitative assessment, cell culture supernatants (see step 3.1.2) are analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent western blotting. Depending on the PEDF transposon plasmid DNA used, the supernatants have to be processed differently.",
    "Purification of His-tagged PEDF fusion proteins from cell culture supernatants\nTake 30 µL nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) slurry per sample using a bevel-cut tip and pellet the Ni-NTA resin by centrifugation (2,660 x g for 30 s).\nCarefully resuspend the Ni-NTA resin with 200 µL of 1x incubation buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and pellet it by centrifugation (2,660 x g for 30 s).\nRepeat the previous step.\nCarefully resuspend the Ni-NTA resin with 40 µL 4x incubation buffer (200 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 M NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) per sample.\nMix 900 µL of cell culture supernatant with 260 µL of 4x incubation buffer and 55 µL of pretreated Ni-NTA slurry (see step 3.2.1.4).\nIncubate the mixture on a rocking shaker at room temperature for 60 min.\nPellet the Ni-NTA resin by centrifugation (2660 x g for 60 s).\nCarefully resuspend the Ni-NTA resin with 175 µL of 1x incubation buffer and pellet resin by centrifugation (2,660 x g for 60 s).\nRepeat the previous step.\nCarefully resuspend the Ni-NTA resin with 30 µL of elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and incubate the mixture on a rocking shaker at room temperature for 20 min.\nPellet the Ni-NTA resin by centrifugation (2,660 x g for 30 s).\nCarefully take the supernatant and mix it with 2x SDS sample buffer47.\nHeat the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and separate the Ni-NTA purified proteins on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.\nPerform western blotting using anti-Penta-His antibodies (mouse monoclonal, 1:500) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000) as previously described36,37.\nDirect analysis of non-tagged PEDF proteins\nTake 15 µL of cell culture supernatant and mix it with 2x SDS sample buffer47.",
