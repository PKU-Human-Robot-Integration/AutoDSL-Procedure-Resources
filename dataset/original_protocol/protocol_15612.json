    "This research was performed in accordance with the IVD (Instantie voor Dierenwelzijn Utrecht) and the guidelines for animal research, project number AVD1150020198824.\n1. Von Frey baseline measurements\nPrior to the surgery, perform baseline measurements according to the Von Frey testing procedure, described below in section 5 and section 6.\n2. Anesthesia and preparation\nNOTE: This study was conducted on 15 male Sprague Dawley rats that were 12 weeks old.\nAnesthetize the animals by induction with 5% isoflurane and maintain anesthesia with 2%-3% isoflurane.\n\tNOTE: Maintenance with 2% isoflurane usually results in sufficient anesthesia and spontaneous breathing, without the need for tracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation.\nCheck the animals' reflexes by pinching the foot with tweezers. Be sure that the animal is unresponsive before proceeding. Shave the operative field from knee to ankle with an electric shaver and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. Inject 0.5 mg/kg of analgesic carprofen subcutaneously in the abdominal region.\nPlace the anesthetized rat on its back with its head either to the left or right and the leg to be operated on near the surgeon. Exorotate the lower hind limb so that the medial malleolus faces upward. Place the rat under a stereo surgical microscope with 6x magnification.\nDisinfect the shaved area with three alternating rounds of iodine-based scrub followed by alcohol. Place a sterile sheet with an operative hole over the leg, so only the operative field is visible. Ensure to maintain these sterile conditions during the surgery.\n3. Surgery",
    "Place a small cotton swab below the ankle in order to keep the operative field horizontal. Locate the knee and gently make a longitudinal incision of 1-2 cm using a scalpel over the medial side of the hind paw from mid-calf to ankle. If needed, open the skin and subcutis further with micro scissors until the muscle layers are visible.\nIdentify the superficial neurovascular bundle as two or three white and a thicker purple/red line, sometimes with minor branches, that can move freely over the muscle layers. Using an electrocautery (see Table of Materials), coagulate any active bleeding or oozing in the operative field. Be careful not to damage the neurovascular bundle.\nBluntly dissect to open the fascia in between the gastrocnemius muscles, just posterior to the superficial neurovascular bundle of 3.2. Between the fascia of the muscles, the tibial nerve can be found. The tibial nerve is about three times the size of the superficial nerve in the neurovascular bundle. Use the tibial bone as an additional landmark (the tibial nerve lies just posterior to the tibial bone).\nIdentify the tibial nerve and its bifurcation.\n\tNOTE: The bifurcation is usually visible with a lighter line longitudinally over the nerve.\nCarefully dissect the tibial nerve free from the surrounding vascular bundles. Perform the dissection by bluntly moving the tibial nerve and cutting the exposed tissue that shows some stretch while moving the tibial nerve.\n\tNOTE: If the tibial nerve is attached to crossing veins after dissection, these veins can be coagulated in order to expose the whole tibial nerve. Be careful to not coagulate the tibial bundle itself.",
    "Expose the tibial nerve proximally until it disappears underneath a crossing muscle layer. At this point, the tibial nerve seems to dive more deeply into the hind paw toward the knee. Expose the tibial nerve distally up to the ankle.\n\tNOTE: When the tibial nerve is exposed more distally, the amount of crossing collagen fibers (i.e., fibers perpendicular to the direction of the nerve fibers) will increase. These collagen fibers need to be cut to enable enough length for transposing the tibial nerve.\n\t\nWhen the whole tibial nerve is exposed, place the muscle layers back to avoid dehydration of the nerve. If the nerve dehydrates (i.e., it becomes more stiff, dull, and wrinkly), and covering with muscle layers does not suffice, add drops of saline to hydrate it.\nUsing a blunt microsurgery tool, preferably a micro needle holder, dissect the pretibial skin from the subcutaneous muscle layer in order to make a subcutaneous tunnel. To do this, hold the skin up and push the blunt tip into the tissue, parallel to the skin. Make sure the end of the tunnel is located pretibially or more laterally to ensure easy accessibility of the area for testing of the neuroma.\nIncrease the isoflurane to 5%. Return to the tibial nerve and expose it (i.e., go back to the place described in step 3.6). Cut the tibial nerve (i.e., both plantar branches) at the most distal level near the ankle. Decrease the isoflurane to the normal level of 2%-3%.\nChange the microscope magnification to 10x or 16x. Identify the epineurium of the tibial nerve proximal to the cut made in step 3.8, or in case of a more proximal bifurcation of the tibial nerve, identify the epineurium of both the medial and lateral plantar branches proximal to the cut in step 3.8.",
    "NOTE: The epineurium is whiter and firmer compared to the nerve fibers within, which are more yellow and soft.\nCarefully place a 8-0 nylon suture (see Table of Materials) through the epineurium of the proximal nerve end by carefully holding the epineurium with tweezers and putting the needle between the nerve and epineurium with a bite of approximately 0.5 mm. Pull the suture through and take a bite with the needle subcutaneously at the end of the subcutaneous tunnel made in step 3.7. Make a knot, which will transpose the nerve laterally into the subcutaneous tunnel.\n\tNOTE: If both plantar branches share a common epineurium, one suture should suffice. If both plantar branches have their own epineurium, each epineurium should be fixated individually. Avoid placing the suture through the skin; only fix it subcutaneously.\nPlace a thicker suture with a dark color (preferably a blue or black 4-0 suture) flush to the fixated nerve end, not penetrating the skin. Make sure the suture is visible from the outside of the skin. Check whether the nerve stays in place after moving the paw and muscles. Cut off the suture ends with a slightly longer suture end on the 4-0 than on the 8-0 suture.\nChange the magnification of the microscope back to 6x. Close the skin with intraepidermal sutures using the 8-0 suture and gently clean the skin with 0.9% NaCl using a cotton swab.\n4. Post-surgical treatment\nPlace the rat in a clean cage under a paper towel in a comfortable position. If the room is cold, place a heat pad under a part of the cage (only under a part of the cage as the animal should be able to escape the heat when needed). Ensure easy access to food and water.",
    "Do not leave the post-surgical rat unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The rat can be returned to the company of other animals when it has fully recovered from anesthesia after surgery. This is usually after 1 h and when the rat exhibits its normal walking pattern and behavior.\nAt 24 h and 48 h after the surgery, administer a dose of 0.5 mg/kg carprofen subcutaneously (abdominal region) to treat post-surgical pain.\n5. Von Frey testing of the plantar side of the hind paws\nNOTE: Von Frey testing (step 5 and 6) is performed prior to surgery (for baseline measurement), and from 3 days after the surgery.\nPlace the rats in mesh wire bottom cages 1 week before baseline measurement, or 2 weeks before the surgery, to ensure acclimatization to the testing environment.\nStart with baseline measures at least 1 week before surgery. Make sure three independent baseline measurements are performed on separate days.\nVerify that the rats are calm in the mesh wired bottom cages. Apply a series of Von Frey monofilaments with a logarithmic scale perpendicular to the plantar surface of the hind paw.\n\t\nIn order to stimulate the sural nerve (hypersensitivity), apply the monofilament on the lateral side close to the hair border. Avoid touching the footpads as these are more sensitive.\nTo stimulate the tibial nerve (hyposensitivity), apply the monofilament in the middle of the plantar surface of the hind paw. If the monofilament is applied in the most medial area, this might also stimulate the saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve (Figure 1). Avoid touching the footpads.",
    "Start with the 4 g monofilament. Apply sufficient force to the monofilament so that the hair is bending and hold for 3 s, and then check the responses of the animal on the monofilament. A positive response is sudden paw withdrawal, sudden flinching, sudden paw licking, or vocalization. In some cases, the rat moves and tries to find/attack the monofilament.\nChoose the next monofilament depending on the response to the stimulus via the up-down method23. For example, if the rat responds, stimulate next with the 2 g monofilament; if the rat does not respond, stimulate with the 6 g monofilament, and so on. In total, apply 5-10 stimuli depending on the reaction.\n6. Von Frey testing of the neuroma site\nHandle the animals daily for a minimum of 5-7 days before baseline measures or 2 weeks before surgery. Make sure the animals are held as described in step 6.2, so that they are comfortable with the position.\nHold the rats with their nose pointed toward the elbow fold. If the rat is held in the right hand, their left hind paw should hang freely between the right thumb and index finger (first web space). If the rat is held in the left hand their right hind paw should hang freely between the left thumb and index finger.\nStart with baseline measures at least 1 week before surgery. Make sure three independent baseline measurements are performed on separate days.",
    "Verify that the rats are calm and comfortable while being held. At baseline, place the 15 g monofilament gently on the pretibial surface of the exposed hind paw. After surgery, place the 15 g monofilament on the visible suture (e.g., at the location of the neuroma). Apply sufficient force to the monofilament so that the hair is bending and hold for 1 s.\n\t\nRecord the reaction to each stimulus. The reaction options include no reaction, slow withdrawal, quick withdrawal, and vocalization. Record the response as 0 points for no reaction and one point for slow withdrawal, quick withdrawal, or vocalization.\nRepeat five clusters of five applications of the monofilament, with 2-3 s between each application and 2-3 min or more between the five clusters. In total, each hind paw should have 25 applications of the monofilament with recorded responses.\n7. Specimen recovery for histology and preparation\nNOTE: Histological examination is performed 12 weeks after initial surgery.\nInduce anesthesia and prepare the animals as described in steps 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.\nGently make an incision of 2-3 cm using a scalpel over the scar that was made by the initial surgery, but be careful not to cut too deep as the nerve is superficially placed.\nDetermine the position of the neuroma, carefully dissect the neuroma and nerve free from surrounding scar tissue, and place the harvested neuroma in fixative. To evaluate neuroma morphology, the tissue is preferably longitudinally embedded in paraffin or epoxy resin as described by Tork et al.18.\nAfter harvesting the tissue, euthanize the rats under terminal anesthesia (5% isoflurane) via cardiac puncture or decapitation.\n\tNOTE: It is advised to first harvest the neuroma before killing the rats, because then it is easier to distinguish the neuroma from its surrounding tissue in vivo.",
