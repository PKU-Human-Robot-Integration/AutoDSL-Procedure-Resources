    "All procedures followed the appropriate NIH guidelines. All of the procedures followed animal protocols that were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport. Female Sprague-Dawley rats at 6 weeks of age were used for this procedure.\n1. Determine the doses/volumes of vector needed\nWeigh the rats to be injected and determine the amount of viral vector needed for each animal based on the titer (concentration) of the vector preparation. Use vector doses that have been successful for efficient expression in the rat CNS previously (see Jackson et al.6).\n\tNOTE: For AAV9 TDP-43 or AAV9 GFP, a typical dose is between 3 x 1013 - 1 x 1014 vector genomes/kg. The young adult rats at 6 weeks of age weigh about 150 g.\nMake equivalent doses per kg in all animals for systematic comparisons. Ensure the volume does not exceed standard advised injection volumes (250 - 500 µL for a 250 g rat). A typical injection volume is 200 μl to a young adult rat.\n2. Prepare work station\nGather all required supplies: one paraffin film square (about 5 x 5 cm) per animal, one alcohol preparation pad per animal, gauze pads (2 - 3 per animal), pipet tips, and a micropipette.\nPrepare the working surface by cleaning the surface with 70% ethanol. Place a heating pad down with the temperature set to low (~37 °C). Place a bench pad on top of the heating pad.\nPrepare the gas anesthesia (isoflurane). Ensure adequate oxygen and gas anesthesia for the procedure. Clean the induction chamber and anesthesia mask with 70% ethanol, and place the anesthesia mask on the bench pad.\n3. Prepare the vector\nThaw the vector at room temperature, and label one sterile microcentrifuge tube for each animal.",
    "Pipet the volume of AAV determined in step 1.1 into the appropriate tube and bring the volume up to the desired injection volume (here, 200 μl) with lactated Ringer's solution or saline.\nPulse vortex the sample for 1 - 2 s and then pulse centrifuge for 5 s to bring the sample to the bottom of the tube.\nPipet the total injection volume for the rat out of the tube and onto the square of paraffin film.\nPlace a 30 gauge needle on a 1 mL syringe.\nPlace the needle with the bevel facing down into the vector on the paraffin film. Pull back on the syringe plunger until all the virus is in the needle and syringe. Be careful to avoid drawing air bubbles into the needle, which becomes easier with practice.\n4. Prepare the rat\nTurn the oxygen up to 1 L/min and set the isoflurane anesthesia to 5%. Ensure that the gas anesthesia is flowing to the induction chamber by checking all connecting hoses and stopcock orientations.\nPlace the rat in the gas anesthesia induction chamber about 3 min, until the rat is unresponsive.\nEnsure adequate depth of anesthesia by pinching the toe. There should be no movement in the foot or leg after the toe pinch.\nReduce the isoflurane anesthesia to 2% for maintenance of anesthesia and adjust the stopcock so that the anesthesia is flowing to the anesthesia mask.\nPlace the rat's nose in the anesthesia mask and adjust the rat so that it is lying on its side.\nIdentify the lateral tail vein.\n\tNOTE: The lateral tail veins lie at approximately 10 and 2 o'clock with the dorsal top of the tail as 12 o'clock. With the rat lying on its side, the lateral tail vein should be facing up.",
    "Wipe the injection area with the alcohol preparation pad. The injection site is two-thirds down the length of the tail.\n5. Inject the vector\nFirmly hold the tail slightly above the injection area with one finger directly over the lateral tail vein; this will dilate the vein.\nWith the bevel facing up, align the needle with the visible tail vein in the same direction.\nPierce the skin over the tail vein while taking great care to avoid the other hand holding the tail and pressing on the tail vein.\nRelease pressure from the tail vein to allow for normal blood flow.\nMove the needle into the vein. To ensure that the needle has punctured the tail vein, pull back slightly on the plunger. If the needle is in the vein, blood will flow into the needle.\n\t\nReposition the needle as needed. Then, to stabilize the needle, move the hand above the injection site to below the injection site and hold the end of the syringe against the tail.\nSlowly inject the vector into the tail (approximately 20 µL/s).\n\tNOTE: The vein may lose color as the vector flows through it. Signs that the solution was injected outside of the vein include blebbing, blanching of the skin, or resistance when injecting the vector. With practice, extra-vascular exposure can be minimized.\nAfter the vector has been administered, remove the needle from the rat and press a gauze pad against the injection site to help stem the bleeding for 30 - 60 s.\n6. Clean-up\nTurn off the isoflurane anesthesia and oxygen. Monitor the rat until it regains consciousness, and then return it to its cage.",
    "Carefully place all needles in the sharps container. Dispose of all other disposable materials that are potentially contaminated with AAV into an appropriate biohazard container. Clean the working stations with 70% ethanol.\n7. Evaluate hindlimb escape reflex\nNOTE: Hindlimb deficits usually arise 2 - 6 weeks after TDP-43 gene transfer, depending on the vector dose.\nOn a flat surface clear of debris, with two fingers grab the rat's tail approximately 2 cm from the body. Lift the rat gently until the forelimbs are hanging while viewing the ventral underside of the rat.\n\t\nPerform the procedure weekly throughout the experimental time-course after gene transfer (e.g., up to 12 weeks after gene transfer).\n\t\tNOTE: Also score forelimb deficits in this manner, but hindlimb deficits are more likely to occur in this model, depending on the vector dose used.\nObserve the hindlimbs for 10 s. Note if one or both hindlimbs clench towards the midline during the 10 s.\nRepeat this test for a total of three times with 30 s between trials. If one or both hindlimbs are clenched for each of three trials, the rat is showing motor dysfunction. Record the data (manually in notes) as either unilateral or bilateral hindlimb deficit present if there is consistent clenching across all three trials.\n8. Evaluate motor function on the rotarod\nTo set up the rotarod, place a bench pad beneath the rotarod and set acceleration to 4 - 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) over 2 min (the rate increases by ~0.3 rpm/s). For a 12 week time-course, run the subjects at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after gene transfer.\nAllow the rat to acclimate to the testing room for 20 min.",
    "To train the rat to use the rotarod for the first time, first start the rotarod at a set speed of 4 rpm, then place the rat on the rotarod. Allow the rat to walk for one full revolution at 4 rpm, then start the acceleration and allow the rat to walk on the rotarod until it falls off. Continue training until the rat can consistently walk for at least 40 s. A healthy, young adult rat will be readily trained in this manner.\n\t\nIn the case of a rat with a noticeable motor impairment, which may prevent the rat from achieving a baseline latency to fall of 40 s, provide the rat 3 - 5 training attempts before beginning rotarod scoring.\nTo begin rotarod testing, place the rat on the rotarod and start acceleration of the rotarod. Note the time at which the rat falls from the rotarod; this is the latency to fall. If the rat remains on the rotarod after 120 s, cap the session at this point, remove the rat from the rotarod and record a fall latency of 120 s.\nRepeat the testing two more times for a total of three trials. To minimize the effect of fatigue, space the trials at least 5 min apart. Average the scores of the three trials. An unimpaired adult rat typically has an average latency to fall of > 40 s.\nPlace the rat back in the cage, and clean the rotarod and surrounding areas with 70% ethanol.\n9. Quantification of GFP expression in the cerebellum",
    "Anesthetize the rats and perfuse with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then 4% paraformaldehyde. Dissect the brain and spinal cord and soak the tissues in the fixative overnight and then move them to a 30% sucrose solution. After equilibration, cut 50 μm coronal sections on a sliding microtome with freezing stage4,5,6.\nChoose 3-6 sections of the cerebellum that are evenly spaced in the vermis, the central lobe of the cerebellum. Fluorescently label the GFP to maximize the signal. Use the primary antibody for GFP at 1:500 and use the Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:3004,5,6.\n\tNOTE: See references 4,5,6 for more detail on the sampling, sectioning, and staining procedures.\nPhotomicrograph each section in the defined region of interest with a low magnification lens using a microscope. Use a 2.5X objective (N.A. 0.12) and filter set 10, 450-490/515-565 excitation/emission). Keep the camera settings (exposure times, e.g., 2 s) the same across samples to be analyzed. Save as a .TIF file.\nOpen the photomicrograph in the widely available Scion image program; two windows will open. Close the window indicated as \"Indexed Color\".\nChoose \"Options\", then \"Density Slice\"; a range of shades will be indicated in red on the Look-Up Table (LUT) window. In the window, use the cursor to fill in the specific GFP labelling only and stop when the non-specific background begins to be picked up in the image.\n\tNOTE: This will highlight the fluorescent area on the photomicrograph to be quantified. The settings should be optimized to specifically capture all of the visibly fluorescent cells. With practice, this method can precisely highlight the specific fluorescence.",
    "Before measuring fluorescent area, first ensure that the measurements made are in the correct units (pixels). To do this, click \"Analyze\", then \"Set Scale\"; the fourth line should say \"Units\". From the drop-down list, choose pixels to measure in pixels, then click \"OK\". Toggle the analysis options to \"Include Interior Holes\" to ensure the inclusion of the entire cell body in the analysis.\nTo measure the fluorescent area, click \"Analyze\" and then click \"Measure\". To see this value, click \"Analyze\" then click \"Show Results\"; a results window will appear. The fluorescent area measurement will be under the heading labeled \"Area\".\nTo ensure standardization across the measurements, do not change the highlighted values in the LUT window.\nOnce all measurements have been recorded, average the values for each animal (from 3 - 6 sections per animal). Use an appropriate statistical test to compare the transduced areas between the groups.6\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
