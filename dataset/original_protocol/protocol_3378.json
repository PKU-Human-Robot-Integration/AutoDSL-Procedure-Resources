Preparing BMDMs for infection assay: confluency, media\n              exchange and assay design\n            \n              (A) Prior to infection, a confluent monolayer of BMDMs should be\n              observed. Adjustments to image described in\n              Table S6[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx]. Scale bar = 100 μm.\n            \n              (B) We recommend pipetting along the corner of wells and avoiding\n              direct contact with the bottom of wells to preserve the monolayer\n              of cells.\n            \n              (C) A typical BMDM infection assay layout, with three technical\n              repeats per treatment condition. Chemical treatment is shown as an\n              example. Created with\n              BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\n            \n              (D) Preview of each channel at the first time point. Examples\n              shown are bright field (macrophages and C. albicans),\n              CellTracker Green (viable macrophages), dTomato (all\n              C. albicans), CFW (escaped C. albicans hyphae only)\n              and DRAQ7 (permeabilized macrophages). Scale bar = 50 μm.\n            \nNote: a confluent monolayer of macrophages\n      should be seen (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The infection assay should\n      not proceed if macrophages are over- or under-confluent.\n    \nCritical: A key goal of this assay is\n      to measure the escape of C. albicans after phagocytosis by\n      macrophages. To achieve this, virtually all of the\n      C. albicans cells added need to be phagocytozed by macrophages. If",
    "the seeding density is too low (i.e., large spaces are seen in between\n      cells) it is likely that incomplete phagocytosis of\n      C. albicans cells will be seen. Non-phagocytozed, extracellular\n      C. albicans cells will form hyphae which interfere with the\n      intended hyphal escape analysis. Additionally, the cell density of\n      macrophages and resulting ratio of infection with C. albicans cells\n      need to be consistent among biological repeats.\n    \n        Replace the culture medium of macrophages with 100 μL per well of\n        FBS-free BMDM differentiation medium with 1 μM CellTracker Green CMFDA\n        dye.\n      \n        Incubate the macrophages at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\n      \nCritical: care should be taken when\n      replacing the culture medium of macrophages at each step, because the\n      macrophage monolayer can be disrupted by scraping of pipette tips along\n      the bottom of wells, or fast pipetting (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). A\n      multichannel pipette may be used to synchronize media exchange among\n      wells.\n    \nOptional: This assay can be adapted to\n      investigate the interactions between a number of host cells and pathogens,\n      including bacteria and fungi. Mechanisms can be further investigated using\n      chemical compounds or genetically modified host cells or pathogens. The\n      timing of the addition of such a chemical compound depends on the aim of\n      the experiment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\n    \n        Immediately prior to infection, resuspend C. albicans in BMDM\n        differentiation medium at the required concentration to make infection\n        medium.\n        \n            Add either 10 μL (1:1 ratio of infection) or 30 μL (3:1 ratio of\n            infection) of the 108 cells/mL\n            C. albicans suspension (described in the\n            before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) to 1 mL of\n            BMDM differentiation medium.\n          \nVortex mix this suspension for at least 10 s.\n        Replace the medium of seeded macrophages with the infection medium,\n        100 μL per well.\n      \nNote: this is considered to be 0 h",
    "post-infection. Take note at which time infection has occurred and use a\n      timer to ensure that the steps that follow are done precisely when needed.\n    \n        Centrifuge the 96-well microplates with infected BMDMs at 500 x\n        g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\n      \nNote: this centrifugation step is\n      important as it synchronizes the encounter of C. albicans cells\n      across the population of seeded macrophages.\n    \n        Incubate the infected BMDMs at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1.5 h to\n        allow for phagocytosis to occur.\n      \n        To remove C. albicans cells that were not phagocytozed, rinse\n        each well with 150 μL of sterile PBS three times.\n      \n        Add the imaging culture medium to each well: BMDM differentiation medium\n        with 0.6 mM DRAQ7 and 10 μg/mL CFW.\n      \nNote: both DRAQ7 and CFW are fluorescent\n      dyes that are impermeant to the BMDM cell membranes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This means that the nuclei of BMDMs are only stained when the membrane\n      is permeabilized. Similarly, the hyphae of escaping C. albicans are\n      only stained with CFW if BMDM membranes are permeabilized.\n    \nImmediately proceed to the live cell imaging step.\nCritical: At this stage,\n      C. albicans will already be making hyphal cells that can be in the\n      process of escaping from macrophages. It is therefore important to proceed\n      with live cell imaging set up as soon as possible to capture early\n      permeabilization of BMDMs and C. albicans hyphal escape. Aim for\n      the first live cell imaging time point to be no later than at 2.5 h\n      post-infection (since first addition of infection media to macrophages,\n      Step 5).\n    \n      Live cell imaging of C. albicans-challenged macrophages\n    \nTiming: 1 day\n      In this step we acquire live cell images that capture the escape of\n      C. albicans from macrophages. The 96-well microplate is mounted on\n      a stage inside a microscopy incubator that maintains cells at 37°C and 5%",
    "CO2 for the duration of the live cell imaging run.\n    \nCritical: ensure that the microscope\n      incubation chamber is pre-heated to 37°C, with CO2 supplied at\n      5%, ahead of image acquisition.\n    \nNote: the 96-well microplate used was\n      clear, flat-bottomed and tissue culture-treated. We used Falcon\n      microplates (catalogue number 353072).\n    \n      A detailed overview of microscopy specifications used in our experiments\n      is provided in\n      Table S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx]. Here we outline the main steps applicable to a range of live cell\n      imaging systems.\n    \n        Mount the 96-well plate to the microscopy stage and seal the microscope\n        incubator.\n      \nNote: Ensure that the room is dark\n    \n        Set up imaging positions within the 96-well microplate.\n        \n            Within each well, program two positions for image acquisition.\n            \nNote: We recommend randomizing the\n              selection of these positions if possible. Ensure that the field of\n              view for each position does not include the edge of the well.\n            \n            Save the position information file in a convenient file location.\n            \nNote: This ensures that this step\n              does not need to be repeated if the software crashes. Also note\n              that some microscopy software includes functions that automate the\n              process of programming imaging positions within microplate wells.\n              We encourage the use of this functionality as it decreases bias\n              that can be introduced when selecting imaging positions. Also\n              remember to include the imaging of uninfected macrophages and\n              media-only controls (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\n            \n        Acquire images of CellTracker Green fluorescence for all imaging\n        positions.\n        \n            Set up a channel that captures CellTracker Green fluorescence (we\n            used a FITC filter cube, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D;\n            Table S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx]).\n          \n            Set up a second autofocus channel.\n            \nNote: we recommend using either\n              bright-field or a far red (for example, a Y5 filter cube) channel\n              for autofocus. In this way we limit exposing the sample to blue\n              light, which can lead to phototoxicity.\n            \n            Preview image acquisition for each channel and optimize illumination",
    "settings accordingly.\n            \nNote: when optimizing illumination\n              settings for each channel, we initially aimed for a good balance\n              of laser intensity and gain to obtain a linear range of signal\n              detection. However, this was found to lead to phototoxicity and/or\n              photobleaching. We therefore adjusted illumination settings to\n              acquire images of lower brightness, prioritizing cell viability.\n            \n            Once CellTracker Green fluorescence has been captured for all\n            positions, save the image file.\n          \n        Acquire C. albicans hyphal escape images at 30 min intervals, for\n        18–24 h.\n        \nNote: The interval at which images are\n          acquired can be modified to suit the experimental question.\n        \n            Set up a bright-field channel, along with channels that capture\n            DRAQ7, dTomato and CFW fluorescence (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\n          \n            Preview image acquisition settings for each channel, as described in\n            Step 13c.\n          \n            Check over autofocus settings.\n            \nNote: here we recommend using the\n              channel for DRAQ7 fluorescence (Y5 filter cube) for autofocus. The\n              autofocus settings for our experiments are described in more\n              detail in\n              Table S5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx].\n            \nSpecify the time intervals for image acquisition.\n            Start live cell image acquisition, observing image acquisition for\n            the entirety of the first time point.\n            \nNote: it is important to check\n              that each image is in focus, and that the time it takes to collect\n              images from all positions occurs within the specified time frame\n              (such as 30 min). If it takes longer to collect images within each\n              time point, not all images will be collected, or time points may\n              be further apart than specified in image acquisition settings.\n              Decreasing the time taken to focus may reduce image acquisition\n              time considerably. However, decreasing the autofocus time may also\n              compromise focus accuracy, which may lead to out-of-focus images.\n            \n      Image analysis: Generating illumination-correction images\n    \nTiming: 20 min\n      Captured live cell images were used in the C. albicans hyphal\n      escape image analysis pipeline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The",
    "accurate quantification of C. albicans escape phenomena depends on\n      accurate cell segmentation performed in this pipeline. Illumination\n      correction to remove non-uniform brightness (such as vignetting) is needed\n      to achieve consistent thresholding results across the field of view. Using\n      images that are representative of this uneven illumination\n      (“illumination-correction” images, generated using media-only controls,\n      Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), we corrected for image vignetting (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Fig5.jpg\n          Figure 5.

Adapted\n          from previously published Figure with permission from Olivier et al.,\n          2022.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n        Select images of empty wells (imaging culture media only, no\n        C. albicans or macrophages) for each channel.\n      \nNote: We recommend capturing at least six\n      such images per experiment: with two imaging positions per experiment,\n      this requires three wells in a 96-well microplate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). For each channel, open at least four of these images in ImageJ (see\n      key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\n    \n        Use these images to produce a median projection image (an image that is\n        the product of the median pixel intensity value from all images).\n        \n            In ImageJ, click on \"Image,\" in the menu bar, then select\n            \"Stacks\" and choose \"Images to stack.\"\n          \n            Click \"OK\" when prompted (the name of the stack is not\n            crucial in this context).\n            \nNote: This action combines the\n              selected images into a single stack.\n            \n            Now select \"Stacks\" and choose \"Z project.\"",
    "You will be asked to specify the project type. Select\n            \"median\" to perform a median projection of the stack.\n            Click \"OK\" to proceed.\n          \n        Apply a blurring effect.\n        \n            Using the \"Process\" menu, select \"Filters\"\n            followed by \"Gaussian Blur\".\n          \n            Set the radius to 16 and confirm your choice by clicking\n            \"OK\".\n          \n        Locate the maximum intensity value in the image, the highest brightness\n        level.\n        \n            Using the \"Analyze\" menu, choose \"Set\n            measurements,\" and ensure that \"min & max gray\n            value\" is checked.\n          \nClick \"OK\" to confirm the settings.\n            Now, in the \"Analyze\" menu, select \"Measure.\"\n          \n            Take note of the maximum intensity value obtained: this value is\n            important for the subsequent calculations.\n          \n        Normalize the intensity values of the image.\n        \n            Using the \"Process\" menu, select \"Math,\" and\n            choose \"Divide.\"\n          \nEnter the maximum value noted down in the previous step.\nNote: This division operation generates a\n      new image where the intensity values are close to 1 at the center\n      (maximum) and decrease towards the image edges, which will help us to\n      account for vignetting effects in our image analysis pipeline.\n    \n        Save this image.\n        \n            Go to the \"File\" menu, select \"Save as,\" and\n            choose the TIF format.\n          \n            Provide an appropriate name, such as \"IllumCor\" followed\n            by the month and year, to ensure easy identification of the file.\n          \n        Repeat Steps 15–20 for each channel (CFW, DRAQ7, dTomato and CellTracker\n        Green).\n      \nNote: for each analysis we recommend using\n      illumination correction images generated within the same experiment. We\n      strongly advise against using outdated illumination correction images, or\n      images acquired from a different microscope.\n    \n      Image analysis: Quantifying C. albicans fungal load, hyphal escape\n      and macrophage membrane permeabilization\n    \nTiming: 1 day\n      Using the live cell imaging data generated from our example infection\n      experiment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) we can quantify the total\n      number of macrophages (permeabilized and viable) as well as the area of",
    "phagocytozed and escaped C. albicans (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Here we describe how the image analysis software CellProfiler (see\n      key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) can be used to\n      perform these measurements.\n    \nNote: we provide settings and notes on\n      image analysis modules used within CellProfiler in\n      Tables S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx],\n      S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc2.xlsx],\n      S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc3.xlsx], and\n      S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc4.xlsx], and refer where these apply in the instructions below. We encourage the\n      reader to adapt these modules as needed for their imaging data. As a rule\n      of thumb, image analysis needs at least as much time investment as the wet\n      lab experiments performed to obtain the data. While the automation of cell\n      counting and area estimates allows for thousands of images to be analyzed\n      in a matter of hours, each image analysis step must be carefully tested.\n      The output from image analysis is dependent on the quality of the data,\n      and thorough overview of input images is required prior to analysis.\n    \n        Perform analysis A (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nNote: In this step we use CellTracker\n          Green staining of macrophages, acquired only at the first time point,\n          to quantify the total number of macrophages in the field of view. For\n          this step we will use the CellProfiler project settings provided in\n          Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx]\n          and\n          S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc2.xlsx]. These image analysis steps are also demonstrated in\n          Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7].\n        \n            Import all CellTracker Green (“CtG” images, as detailed in the LIF\n            to TIF conversion in Step 6 of the\n            before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section) TIF files\n            into the \"Images\" module by dragging and dropping the\n            files into the window.\n            \nNote: This includes CellTracker\n              Green images for all positions as well as the illumination\n              correction image for the CellTracker Green channel.\n            \nCritical: it is important to\n              check that each .TIF file name contains information about the\n              position, time point and channel. For example, an image with the",
    "name \"P22_T0_C0″ means that this is image is of position 22\n              at the first time point, of channel = 0 (only one channel is\n              acquired on this occasion). The generation of TIF images with this\n              file naming convention is discussed further in the\n              before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section, Step 6.\n            \n            In the metadata module, check that channel, position, time series\n            and image type information are captured for all images.\n            \nNote: Images should appear as\n              “ctg” and “None” in the “Type” column of CellProfiler for\n              CellTracker Green and illumination correction images,\n              respectively.\n            \n            In the NamesAndTypes module, check that each CellTracker Green image\n            is listed next to the same illumination correction image.\n            \nNote: the order of the images does\n              not matter at this stage of the analysis.\n            \n            Preview vignetting correction and cell segmentation.\n            \n                Select the eye icon next to the ImageMath and\n                IdentifyPrimaryObject modules to be “open”.\n              \n                Select “Start Test Mode” in the bottom left corner of the\n                program interface.\n              \n                Select “Step” to progress through the image analysis modules.\n              \n                To progress through all image analysis modules, select “Run”.\n                \nNote: at this point, windows\n                  appear with image analysis previews. If input images appear\n                  dark, use the “Subplots” menu to adjust the contrast of a\n                  previewed image: for example, by selecting “Image contrast”\n                  then “Log normalized”. The third image, showing outlines of\n                  where cells will be segmented, is a useful visualization of\n                  segmentation. Green outlines represent objects that fall\n                  within the acceptable cell size range, purple outlines\n                  represent objects that are too small or large to be classified\n                  as a cell.\n                \n            Preview the segmentation of macrophages from each treatment\n            condition within an experiment.\n            \nNote: for example, for the\n              experimental setup in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, we would\n              optimize the segmentation using 8 images: one from each treatment\n              condition.",
    "When segmentation of all images has been validated, select “Exit\n            Test Mode”.\n            \nNote: cell segmentation can be\n              impacted by uneven fluorescence staining, irregular cell\n              morphologies or overlap of cells (as this is two-dimensional image\n              data). For this reason, a small number of cells cannot be\n              segmented successfully (less than 5%), even with optimal\n              segmentation settings. If cells are seeded too densely (increased\n              overlap) or there is low signal-to-noise ratio in the captured\n              images, this can lead to decreased segmentation accuracy, and more\n              optimization of sample preparation and image acquisition steps may\n              be required. Cell thresholding and segmentation parameters\n              provided in this protocol (Tables S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc2.xlsx],\n              S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc3.xlsx], and\n              S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc4.xlsx]) are exemplary only, as these are affected by image acquisition\n              settings and the morphology of cells used in the infection\n              experiment. Image analysis settings should be validated for every\n              experiment: this is done by adjusting cell segmentation parameters\n              (in particular, object diameter and thresholding value) to produce\n              the best segmentation results. For example, if a single macrophage\n              appears to be segmented multiple times, the object diameter values\n              may be too small. On the other hand, if several macrophages appear\n              to be segmented as a single cell, the object diameter values may\n              be too large.\n            \n            In the ExportToSpreadsheet module, nominate a destination folder for\n            export of the spreadsheet file under “Output file location”.\n          \n            Select “Press to select measurements” to confirm that the correct\n            measurements are set to be exported.\n            \nNote: See\n              Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc2.xlsx]\n              for recommendations on which measurements to export.\n            \n            With your image analysis settings now finalized, save this project\n            file in a location that is separate to the template file.\n          \n            Press “Analyze Images” to begin analysis.\n            \nNote: for faster processing of\n              your images, deselect the “eye” icons next to the analysis\n              modules.\n            \n        Perform analysis B (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: in this step we use DRAQ7\n          staining to quantify the number of macrophages that are permeabilized\n          over time. For this step we will use the CellProfiler project settings\n          provided in\n          Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc1.xlsx]\n          and\n          S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc3.xlsx]. These image analysis steps are also demonstrated in\n          Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]. This analysis involves a similar\n          process to the CellTracker Green analysis (Step 22, a-j)\n          described above, with the following exceptions:\n        \n            In the “Images” module, drag-and-drop all hyphal escape analysis TIF\n            image files, along with the DRAQ7 illumination correction image.\n            \nNote: these are all hyphal escape\n              assay “hea” images, as detailed in the LIF to TIF conversion in\n              Step 6 of the\n              before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section. We can\n              use the necessary subset of these images by classifying which of\n              these files are of DRAQ7-positive macrophages in the\n              “NamesAndTypes” module.\n            \n            In the Metadata module, check that hyphal escape assay images are of\n            “hea” type, while the illumination correction image appears as\n            “None”.\n          \n            As with Step 22c, each DRAQ7 image (“hea”, channel 0) should be\n            listed alongside the same illumination correction image in the\n            “NamesAndTypes” module.\n          \n            Test all cell segmentation parameters, as described in Step 22d-e.\n            \nNote: not all macrophages will be\n              DRAQ7-positive. Images across several time points need to be\n              tested in addition to a range of positions. Also consider that\n              DRAQ7-positive nuclei will appear smaller than\n              CellTracker-positive cell membranes, and that the expected object\n              diameter needs to be adjusted accordingly in the\n              “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module. As done for Analysis A, this\n              requires optimization by the user for a given experiment, and the\n              values provided in\n              Table S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc3.xlsx]\n              are exemplary only.\n            \n            Prepare the export of data, save the project file and run the\n            analysis as described in Step 22g-j.\n          \n        Perform analysis C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nNote: In this step we quantify the",

These image analysis steps are also demonstrated in\n          Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9].\n        \n            Add TIF “hea” images to the “Images” module, as described in Step\n            22a.\n            \nNote: two illumination correction\n              images should be added (to correct vignetting for both dTomato and\n              CFW images).\n            \n            As described in Step 22b, check that the regular expression extracts\n            relevant metadata from image file names in the “Metadata” module.\n          \n            Using the “NamesAndTypes” module, assign channel identifies to the\n            dTomato and CFW images.\n            \nNote: in our experiments, these\n              images corresponded to channels 1 and 2, respectively (see\n              Table S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3144-Mmc4.xlsx]). Also note that it is important to distinguish the dTomato and\n              CFW illumination correction images in this module.

Each of these\n              modules should be validated before commencing analysis. The end\n              goal is to obtain binarized images that best represent dTomato (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) and CFW-positive (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C)\n              C. albicans cells, as seen in the fluorescence images\n              (these binarized images are previewed using the “ApplyThreshold”\n              modules). Accurate binarized representations of\n              C. albicans cells are needed to estimate total area of\n              dTomato and CFW-positive C. albicans cells.
