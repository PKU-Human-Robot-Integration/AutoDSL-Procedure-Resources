We then used OligoCalc website (OligoCalc (Kibbe, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])) to analyze the full sequence of the prospective primers for potential hairpin formation and/or self-annealing. Targeting PCR efficiency due to maximum primer availability and specific template binding, we avoided using the primer pairs that were predicted to form hairpin or self-annealing. In addition, we only accepted forward and reverse primer pairs with differences in melting temperatures smaller than 5°C (please refer to the note below for detailed explanation). It is important to notice that, due to the limited options of primers, we accepted primers that allowed self-annealing, without hairpin formation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Designing cold fusion primers set\nTm: Melting temperature.\nDownload the appropriate sequences.\nDownload the Reference Sequence for Homo sapiens bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4), transcript variant long, mRNA (GenBank: NM_058243.3) from the NCBI’s website, using the GenBank data base (BRD4-L RefSeq[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_058243.3]).\nDownload the sequence for LentiV_Blast (Addgene, cat# 111887) from Addgene’s website (LentiV_Blast[href=https://www.addgene.org/111887/sequences/]).\nUsing Addgene’s sequence analyzer, identify in the sequence of overexpression vector (LentiV_Blast) the point of insertion of the gene to be overexpressed.\nNote: In the sequence of LentiV_Blast, the point of insertion can be identified by the site including the sequence of the restriction enzyme of BamHI (GGATCC).\nAssemble prospective forward and reverse PCR primers, containing 18–20 bases complimentary to the gene of interest plus 15 bases corresponding to the vector.",
    "Critical: While selecting the 18–20 bases complimentary to the gene, make sure the forward primer includes the start codon (ATG) and the reverse primer includes one of the three stop codons (TAA, TAG and TGA).\nUse OligoCalc website (OligoCalc[href=http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html], (Kibbe, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])) to verify potential hairpin formation and self-annealing of the full sequence of the prospective primers.\nMake sure the difference in melting temperature between forward and reverse primers is smaller than 5°C.\nNote: For melting temperature purposes, only the BRD4-L portion of the primer’s sequences should be considered.\nOrder primer sets.\nNote: Our lab uses custom DNA oligos from the company Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Primers are ordered with standard desalting purification and scale of 100 nmole.\nNote: It is important to notice that the specific difference in primers melting temperature (Tm) of 5°C or less was determined in accordance to the instructions of the manufacturer of the DNA polymerase used (Phusion™, Thermo Scientific™, cat# F-530L - Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]). However, it is also relevant to understand that the Tm of a primer correlates with the temperature at which the primer anneals with the specific sequence of DNA we are intending to amplify during a PCR reaction, also known as annealing temperature (AT). AT is the temperature at which the primers bind, specifically, to the complimentary template region for which they were designed. To avoid unspecific annealing of the primers with the template, it is ideal that both the forward and the reverse primers anneal with the DNA at approximate temperatures. Therefore, a smaller difference in the Tm of the primers will increase the chances that the optimal temperature for annealing (AT) is similar between the forward and reverse primers pair.\nVector linearization\nTiming: 1 day",
    "The overexpression plasmid LentiV_Blast is delivered to the lab as a circular molecule of DNA inserted into live bacteria. Addgene provides the bacteria as an agar stab and the tube with bacteria is maintained at 4°C for up to 2 weeks, during which the plasmid is amplified, and a glycerol stock is created. For detailed instructions of how to manipulate and maintain plasmids obtained by Addgene, please refer to the Addgene website here: Addgene - Bacteria stab[href=https://www.addgene.org/recipient-instructions/myplasmid/]. In order to prepare the plasmid to receive the insert of BRD4-L, we first had to grow the bacteria for 16 h in LB medium, containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. Then, we extracted the circular plasmids from the bacteria using QIAGEN’s CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit (cat# 12863). Finally, we linearized the circular plasmid with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Cover the 500 mL flask with aluminum foil and grow the bacteria for 16 h, at 37°C, on a benchtop shaker incubator, using a speed of 1 g.\nNote: Our lab uses New Brunswick Innova 40 benchtop shaker, in which the speed is converted to 240 rpm.\nPerform plasmid purification, using the CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, cat# 12863).\nNote: All of the sub-steps in this section were performed in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol (CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=9d192369-e455-4fd5-a2b2-72b6eb6c58bf&lang=en]).\nElute the plasmid in 70 μL of Buffer EB.\nNote: Although QIAGEN’s CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit protocol suggests plasmid elution with 100 μL or 200 μL of Buffer EB, our lab uses smaller volumes, to ensure the minimum concentration of 1 μg/μL.\nMeasure the plasmid concentration with spectrophotometer.\nNote: Our lab uses DS-11+ Spectrophotometer (DeNovix).\nAdjust the final concentration of the plasmid to 1 μg/μL.\nUsing a thermocycler, digest 4 μg of LentiV_Blast with BamHI, at 37°C, for 16 h.\nNote: Our lab uses Eppendorf Master Cycler Pro thermocycler.\nCritical: While adding the reagents for diagnostic digestion, make sure the restriction enzyme is the last component to be added to the digestion tube. Concerning incubation time, in previous experiments we attempted to digest LentiV_Blast with BamHI for 1 h and 3 h, however, we observed that this amount of time was not enough to digest the plasmid completely.\nRun the digestion product in 0.8% agarose gel (Thomas Scientific, cat# C9961-57), for 35–40 min, using a voltage of 110 V.\nNote: Make sure to also run circular LentiV_Blast plasmid as control (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Add 10 μL of DNA ladder (GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder, Thermo Scientific™, cat# SM1334) to each side of the gel.",
    "Remove the digested plasmid from the agarose gel, using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, cat# 28704), in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]).\nElute the linearized vector in 30 μL of UltraPure™ water.\nNote: Although QIAGEN’s QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol suggests plasmid elution with 50 μL of water, our lab uses smaller volumes, to ensure the optimal concentration.\nMeasure the linearized vector’s concentration with spectrophotometer.\nIf possible, adjust the final concentration of the linearized vector to 25 ng/μL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_5.csv\nPCR amplification of BRD4-L\nTiming: 1 day\nThe PCR amplification of BRD4-L can be very challenging, because this is a large gene (4,089 bp) which contains several G-C rich regions. Some of the BRD4-L fragments present a G-C content as high as 66.1%. This becomes especially complicated when using cold-fusion primers, which can be prone to self-annealing. After receiving the primers, we performed an annealing temperature (AT) gradient experiment and verified that these primers produced unspecific amplifications bands of sizes ∼700 bp and between 1,500 bp and 2,000 bp (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In addition, after sequencing bands that appeared consistent with BRD4-L amplification (∼4,000 bp) we verified that there were multiple sites with severe changes of the expected sequences, with over 300 bp mismatch.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the first attempt to amplify BRD4-L via PCR, by performing an annealing temperature (AT) gradient, without betaine",
    "For illustration purposes, only the lower range gradient (10°C lower than the mid-point) is observed above. No amplification was observed with AT higher than 63.8°C. Non-specific amplification can be identified around sizes 700 bp and 1,700 bp. The reference band for estimating the product size (4,089 bp) has been identified on the ladder above 3,000 base pairs (bp). Reference ladder used is GeneRuler 100 bp Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific™, cat# SM0323), 10 μL were added to the left side of the gel.",
    "After researching different strategies involved in the PCR amplification of G-C rich templates (Mamedov et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Green and Sambrook, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), we decided to investigate the use of betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B0300-5VL[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/b0300]), as a PCR additive in the amplification of BRD4. Betaine has been widely used in amplification of G-C rich sequences and it acts by reducing the melting temperature of the DNA, decreasing the formation of secondary structures formed by the regions of DNA rich in G-C (Green and Sambrook, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and stabilizing the DNA by equalizing the contribution of GC- and AT-base pairs (5M Betaine - Sigma-Aldrich[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/b0300]). Our approach with betaine included an attempt to titrate the ideal molar concentration of betaine that would allow for amplification of BRD4-L (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). However, the use of betaine as a mere additive to the PCR reactive failed to amplify BRD4-L in multiple efforts, producing inefficient BRD4-L amplification and non-specific amplification. Taking into consideration the fact that the template might have multiple secondary structures prior to the PCR reactions that might not be undone in the process of denaturation, and considering the mode of action of betaine, we attempted to incubate the template in betaine for 16 h (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). After 16 h incubation of the template, BRD4-L was successfully amplified via PCR reaction in every attempt (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), including with the use of cold fusion primers designed for different vectors (data not shown).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Reference ladder used is GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific™, cat# SM1334), 10 μL were added to each side of the gel.\nTherefore, to overcome issues encountered around the amplification of BRD4-L, we have determined that the following measures are necessary for a successful BRD4-L PCR:\nIncubate the template with 0.5 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B0300-5VL) for 16 h, prior to PCR reaction. This procedure was established as critical based on our lab experience.\nUse Phusion™ G-C Buffer instead of Phusion™ HF Buffer (both are provided with the enzyme). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nUse initial denaturation time of 3 min, which is longer, to ensure that the entire template gets denatured. This modification is suggested in the Phusion™ polymerase protocol (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]).",
    "Be aware that the annealing temperature (AT) might be different than what is recommended to be used with Phusion™ polymerase, because of the presence of betaine in the PCR mix. For our specific primers, the advised AT was 65.1°C, however, we found after gradient experiments that AT of 61.6°C produced better results. In order to find the ideal AT for your primers, we suggest performing a gradient experiment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) using the temperature calculated via Thermo Fisher Scientific’s temperature calculator (Tm calculator[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/molecular-biology-learning-center/molecular-biology-resource-library/thermo-scientific-web-tools/tm-calculator.html?CID=fl-we120377]) as mid-point. ThermoFisher Scientific’s Tm calculator will estimate the ideal AT for your primer pair, based on the Tm for each primer. It is ideal to test temperatures that range from approximately 10°C higher to 10°C lower than the mid-point. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTo avoid amplification of unspecific products, we found that shorter annealing times (Mamedov et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and a reduced number of cycles (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]) decreased the chances of our primers biding to unspecific targets. We found these steps to be critical to eliminate non-specific products and to increase efficiency in our reactions. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPCR steps are as follows:\nIn a 0.2 mL PCR tube, combine the DNA template (pcDNA5-Flag-BRD4-WT, transient expression plasmid, Addgene, cat# 90331) with 5 M betaine and UltraPure™ water.\nVortex and spin.\nPlace the tube in 4°C for 16 h.\nAdd the PCR reagents to the same tube.\nNote: Add all the reagents to the tube in which the template was incubated with 0.5 M betaine. Additional 5 M betaine and ddH2O will be necessary.\nCritical: Make sure the polymerase is the last reagent to be added to the tube.\nVortex and spin.\nUsing a thermocycler, conduct PCR in accordance to the PCR cycling conditions indicated below.",
    "Run the PCR product in 0.8% agarose gel, for 35–40 min, using a voltage of 110 V (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nRemove the PCR product from the agarose gel, using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]).\nElute the PCR product in 30 μL of UltraPure™ water.\nNote: Although QIAGEN’s QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol suggests plasmid elution with 50 μL of water, our lab uses smaller volumes, to ensure the optimal concentration.\nMeasure the PCR product’s concentration with spectrophotometer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_6.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_8.csv\nCritical: Cycling times and the number of cycles are critical for proper BRD4-L amplification.

We have found Cold Fusion™ to be a simple and quick technique that provided us with a ligation strategy that diminished the chances of promoting alterations to the BRD4-L insert that might impair its expression.\nAdjust the concentration of the BRD4-L insert, ensuring it is within the desired range (20–200 ng/μL).\nAdjust the concentration of the LentiV_Blast linearized vector, ensuring it is within the desired range (10–100 ng/μL).\nPerform Cold Fusion™ cloning, in accordance to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cold Fusion[href=http://www.systembio.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Manual_Cold_Fusion_083010-1.pdf]), making the following changes:\nEnsure the proportion of BRD4-L insert:LentiV_Blast linearized vector is 3:2 molar ratio.

    "If the processes of vector linearization, PCR amplification and Cold Fusion™ cloning are completed successfully, the steps to be followed for miniprep and clone screening should occur smoothly. The most critical point for clone screening is to define the appropriate combination of restriction enzymes to use with your new plasmid (LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L) that will allow for identification of specific band sizes. Specific band sizes for diagnostic digestion of LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L should be different from empty LentiV_Blast vectors and from plasmids with improperly amplified BRD4-L, i.e., BRD4-L inserts missing fragments. While performing diagnostic digestion of LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L, we determined that the combination of the enzymes EcoRI and MluI digest the plasmid creating bands of sizes 8,229 bp and 2,672 bp. The same combination of restriction enzymes should not cut empty LentiV_Blast vectors, producing a single band (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

We have found that temperatures higher than 36°C (37°C, for example) promote occurrence of multiple mutations and poor colony yield.\nPerform plasmid purification using the CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit, in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol (CompactPrep Plasmid Maxi Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=9d192369-e455-4fd5-a2b2-72b6eb6c58bf&lang=en]).\nElute the plasmid in 70 μL of EB buffer.\nNote: Although QIAGEN’s QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol suggests plasmid elution with 100 μL–200 μL of EB buffer, our lab uses smaller volumes, to ensure the optimal concentration.\nMeasure the plasmid concentration with spectrophotometer.",
    "Send the plasmid for sequencing, to ensure that the correct sequence for BRD4-L has been cloned into LentiV_Blast.\nNote: All of our sequencing experiments were performed by The OMRF Sanger DNA Sequencing facility.\nCritical: To avoid formation of secondary structures and ensure that the sequencing process occurs smoothly, 0.1 M Betaine should be added to the LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L plasmid prior to Sanger DNA sequencing"
