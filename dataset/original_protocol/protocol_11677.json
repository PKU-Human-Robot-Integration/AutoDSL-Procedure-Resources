    "All procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by Northwestern University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee based on guidelines issued by the National Institute of Health.\n1. The Cylinder (Figure 2A)\nConstruct the cylinder as described by Chettih et al. and Heiney et al. from a long foam cylinder14-15. Cut a 10 cm length of cylinder and drill a hole through the center to fit the axle, a metal rod 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) in diameter. Mount the cylinder with its axle onto a metal optical breadboard as described by Heiney et al. or another support (e.g., Plexiglas)15.\nErect two vertical metal rods of 12.7 mm in diameter on either side of the cylinder.\nAttach two right-angle mounts onto the metal rods.\nSecure two more rods (5 cm long, 12.7 mm in diameter) through the right-angle mounts. Bevel the ends of these rods and level their ends above the center of the cylinder (Figure 2G).\nDrill and tap a hole through the leveled ends of the rods to fit two 4-40 machine screws that will hold the wings of the connector in place (Figure 2G).\n2. Assembling the Whisker Stimulation System (Figure 2B)\nCut a 10-tooth segment of comb from a regular hair comb.\nCut a slit about 2-3 mm wide and about 5 mm deep on the top part of the comb to accept a 2-layer rectangular bending actuator.\nSolder one wire to each surface of the bending actuator. Use the solder and flux provided by the manufacturer. Cover the actuator and solder with electrical tape to protect the mouse and user from the electrical current.",
    "Slip the actuator strip into the slit cut into the comb so that the bending actuator strip sits perpendicular to the plane of the comb. Angle the comb so that it is tilted at 45° and more naturally follows the curve of the mouse's face.\nSecure the end of the actuator strip to the top of the comb with quick-setting epoxy.\n\tNote: The wires soldered to the bending actuator strip should be connected to a rheostat that delivers 40 volts to the actuator. Previous experiments have shown that 40 volts is effective for conditioning but does not evoke any startle responses.\nPlace the bending actuator and the comb on a moveable mount. A pipette holder attached to a magnetic base as normally used for in vitro electrophysiology rigs works well.\n3. Assembling the Connector that Mounts to Rods above the Cylinder (Figure 2C, 2E)\nNote: The connector is a 3-D printed 7-hole strip modeled from the Amphenol 221 series nylon strip used for the tether by Weiss and Disterhoft and Galvez et al.10,17\nTap the first hole in the strip for a 0-80 x-1\" machine screw. This will serve as a locking screw to anchor the headpiece to the connector. Affix a 0-80 nut to the head of the locking screw with cyanoacrylic glue in order to facilitate turning the screw by hand.\nLeave one hole empty after the tapped hole (to allow room for the 0-80 machine nut) and push five gold-plated relia-tac sockets through the remaining five holes.\nStrip the coating off five long wires (wires obtained from an Ethernet cable) and solder to the ends of the sockets.",
    "Note: The first two wires will be used to record the electromyographic (EMG) signals that will detect an eyeblink response following signal filtering and amplification from an amplifier. The second two will deliver the shock signal from a stimulus isolator. The last wire will serve as a ground connection. These wires will be connected to the systems used for the timed CS-US delivery.\nEnsure electrical connectivity between the wires and the sockets with a multimeter. Put the multimeter on the continuity setting and hold one of the probes to the pin and the other probe to the stripped ends of the wire. The pins and the wires are electrically connected when the resistance is low and the multimeter emits a tone.\n\t\nAlternatively, if the multimeter does not have a continuity setting, measure the resistance between the pins and the wires. There is electrical continuity if there is very little resistance measured.\nPrepare the wings of the connector from two TO-220 style transistors. Cut off the emitter, base, and collector leads of the transistor and level the surface so it can be affixed to the connector.\nCut the edge of the mounting tab to breach the hole so the tab can slip underneath the head of the screw.\nEpoxy the transistors to the connector. The hole in the mounting tab will be used to secure the connector to the rods above the cylinder.\nApply epoxy to the base of the wires protruding from the sockets and allow the epoxy to dry. The epoxy will insulate and protect the connections.\n4. Preparing the Headpiece (Figure 2D, 2E)",
    "Note: The headpiece strip is a 3-D printed 7-hole strip modeled from the Amphenol 221 series nylon strip used for the headpiece by Weiss and Disterhoft and Galvez et al.10,17. This piece is no longer manufactured commercially. The printer file can be downloaded from this journal's website.\nTap the first hole in the strip for a 0-80 x 1\" machine screw and leave one hole empty after the first hole.\nPush five gold-plated pins through the bottom of the remaining five holes (through the narrower ends). Use a vise to facilitate pushing the pins into the strip evenly.\nUsing a thermal stripper, remove about 0.5 cm of polyimide coating off the end of a stainless steel wire (0.005 in. diameter), solder the stripped end of the wire to the opening of one of the pins and cut the wire to 0.6-0.7 cm.\nStrip about 0.2 cm from the end of the wire to allow current to pass to the animal.\nRepeat steps 4.3-4.4 for the remaining three wires.\n\tNote:The first two wires will record EMG responses while the second two will serve to deliver a shock to the animal.\nAs the last (fifth) wire will serve as a ground wire, cut about 5 cm of uncoated stainless steel wire (0.005 in. diameter), and solder to the remaining pin.\nEnsure continuity between the wires and the pins with a multimeter. (In the case of the ground wire, which is uncoated, the multimeter probe can be placed anywhere along the wire.)\n5. Surgical Preparation (Figure 2F)\nSterilize all surgical tools, including the headpiece. Sterilize the headpiece by soaking it in alcohol and then rinsing with sterile saline.\nAnesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with 3-4% vaporized isoflurane mixed with a flow rate of 1-2 L of oxygen per minute.",
    "Ascertain that the animal is fully anesthetized with a toe pinch. The mouse is fully anesthetized when it does not respond reflexively to the toe pinch.\nOnce the animal has been fully anesthetized, inject a dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride as an analgesic (0.05–2 mg/kg, sc), shave the top of the animal’s head, place it on a covered heating pad on the base of the stereotaxic frame, ascertain that the animal is fully anesthetized, and secure the head to the frame. Maintain flow of vaporized isoflurane to the animal, switching to 2% at a flow rate of 1-2 L of oxygen per minute. Apply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment to the corneas.\nDisinfect the scalp with povidone-iodine and alcohol three time each, alternating between the two.\nWith a number 10 or 15 scalpel blade, make an incision along the midline of the scalp, exposing the skull from the front of the eyes to past the interparietal bone (~1.5-2 cm).\nHold back the flaps of the skin with micro clips. Place one clip above the eye, one along the middle of the rostral-caudal axis, and one at the back of the skull bilaterally (i.e., use six clips in all). In order to prevent headpiece avulsion, expose as much of the skull as possible, including the sides and back. This will increase the surface area for the application of the adhesive luting cement.\nUsing the scalpel, scrape along the top of the skull to remove the periosteum and ensure a clean and dry working surface. Clean the top of the skull with 3% hydrogen peroxide three times.",
    "Drill two holes into the skull with a size 34 inverted cone burr or a 1.6 mm engraving cutter drill bit to accept 00-90 screws (0.0625 in. long). The screws will provide the electrical ground connection. Place one hole in front of Bregma, and the other in front of Lambda, left of the midline when conditioning the right eye. Place one screw in each hole. Lower the screw 0.28 mm into the skull for each full turn; two full turns is sufficient.\nCreate several small divots of approximately 0.75 mm in diameter on the skull in order to increase the surface area and grip strength for the cement.\nTake the completed headpiece and wind the ground wire in a figure-eight configuration around the two screws. Allow some slack (~1.5 cm between the headpiece and the screw) in the ground wire so the headpiece can be positioned properly later.\n\tNote: The figure eight usually ensures a good electrical connection between the wire and the ground screws. The wire can also be soldered to the screw to ensure an electrical connection.\nApply the adhesive luting cement. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing the adhesive luting cement or mix 4 scoops of L-Powder mix, 8 drops of the base, and 2 drops of the catalyst in a cold ceramic mixing dish (ensure the temperature strip on the mixing dish is completely black.) The cold temperature extends the working time of the cement.\n\t\nCoat the skull and the screws liberally with the luting cement and allow the cement to dry. This should take only a few minutes.\nAfter the cement has dried, position the headpiece vertically, with the pins standing up, above the skull. Hold the headpiece in place with a holder similar to the connector",
    "Note: See \"3. Assembling the Connector\"-The holder need only be a five-hole strip with gold-plated sockets in order to receive the pins of the headpiece. The holder is attached to an arm on the stereotaxic frame. The use of the holder and arm facilitates the positioning of the headpiece and the wires.\nAfter the headpiece has been positioned, peel back the skin around the periorbital area and position the two shock wires to allow the 0.2 cm stripped end to rest underneath the skin and approximately 2-4 mm directly caudal to the eye. Do not allow the ends of the two wires to touch each other. Position the two EMG wires on the muscularis orbicularis oculi above the eye socket.\n\t\nIf necessary, cut off the ends of the wires if they are too long and seem as though they may directly scratch the orbit and result in infection. If cutting off the ends of the wire, ensure that there is enough bare wire exposed. Alternatively, if the wires seem too long, bend the wire back at the base, where they extend out of the headpiece.\nCement the base of the wires (i.e., the end near the headpiece) in place on the skull with a small spread of the adhesive luting cement and allow to dry (use half of the portion described earlier).\nRemove the micro clips and gently fold the flaps of skin back over the cement. Allow the skin to settle naturally to prevent tension on any part of the skin in order to avoid distortion of the eyelid, prevention of the eyeblink response, and distress to the animal.",
    "Seal the exposed area with dental cement, covering everything from the incised skin to the edge of the top of the headpiece with cement. Take extra care to avoid dripping cement on the eyes or the pins of the headpiece. Partially cured cement can be smoothed and manipulated with a cotton swab that is dampened with dental cement solvent. Allow the cement to dry completely before removing the headpiece holder.\nAllow the animal to recover from anesthesia on a warmed surface before replacing the animal back in its cage. Administer Metacam (1 mg/kg, SQ) and then place the animal back in its cage.\nAllow the animal 5-7 days of recovery before testing or training. Maintain standard post-operative care to the animal according to your institution's guidelines. The animal should be checked at least once per day after it has recovered from surgery. Watch for signs of poor eating and/or drinking and listless behavior. If pain is suspected, provide Metacam every 24 hr (same dose as at the end of post-surgery) until alleviated. Lidocaine can be locally applied to the wound if the animal is scratching or shows signs of discomfort.\n6. Placing the Mouse on the Cylinder and Training (Figure 2G)\nTo place the mouse onto the cylinder, restrain the mouse with a hand briefly by holding it by the tail with one hand and then grasping the mouse behind the shoulders with forefinger and thumb with the other. Wrap the remaining fingers around the mouse's abdomen and torso.\nWith the hand not restraining the mouse, attach the connector to the headpiece on the mouse's head and turn the locking screw.",
    "Place the mouse gently on the cylinder and hold it in place while attaching the connector to the frame. Use the two screws to fasten the connector to the bars above the cylinder.\nOnce the connector has been secured to the cylinder frame, release the hold on the mouse. Give the mouse one day of two sessions of habituation to the cylinder. Allow each habituation session the same duration as each conditioning session.\n\t\nRecord spontaneous blink rate during habituation and pre-expose the mice to the whisker vibration CS in order to minimize the occurrence of startle responses. Apply the CS as during an actual conditioning session, but without the electrical shock US.\nApply the whisker stimulation CS by placing the Piezo system close (about 0.5 cm) to the conditioned side (the right side) of the mouse, while slipping the teeth of the comb over individual whiskers. Ensure that the same whiskers are stimulated day to day by placing the Piezo system in the same position from day to day.\nBegin training the mouse on classical conditioning. Deliver two sessions of training per day for five days. Leave about two hours between each training session.\n\t\nTo the conditioned group, deliver thirty trials per session of a 250 msec long whisker vibration CS (60 Hz) paired with a 100 msec long electrical pulse US (0.3 mA - 3 mA, delivered from a WPI A385R stimulus isolator). Separate the CS and the US with a 250 msec long stimulus-free trace interval to make the task dependent on the hippocampus (Figure 1)23.\nAdjust the intensity of the electrical shock for each animal so that a blink is evoked. Separate trials with a random intertrial interval of 30-60 sec (average of 45 sec, total duration of 30 min per session.)",
    "Deliver thirty unpaired CS alone and US alone trials each (for a total of sixty trials) to the pseudoconditioned group, using the same stimulus parameters as stated for the conditioned group. Ensure that the CS alone and US alone trials are pseudorandomized such that no stimulus is presented more than twice in a row. Separate each trial with an average intertrial interval of 22.5 sec.\nDeliver background noise at 65 dB throughout habituation and training in order to mask any noise of the vibration generated by the whisker stimulator.\nSubscription Required.
