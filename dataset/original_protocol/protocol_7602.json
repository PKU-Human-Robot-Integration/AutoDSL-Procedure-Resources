    "Production of EPS using submerged cultures S. radiatum and L. crinitus culture preparation.Inoculate each fungal strain from a 4 °C distilled water stock onto solid malt agar medium in a 90 mm × 15 mm Petri dish and incubate at 28 °C until the plate attains full growth for 4–7 days (see Graphical overview, step 1). It is also possible to use other Petri dish sizes.After full growth, cut the solid malt agar medium with a sterile core sampler (5 mm diameter) and transfer three discs of each fungal strain to 2.0 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, using a sterile nichrome inoculating needle.Add 1 mL of sterile distilled water and disperse the agar discs using a pistil. Another option to disperse is to use a stainless-steel immersion blender for 3 s.Transfer the mixture to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer containing 50 mL of SYAMI culture medium previously autoclaved at 15 psi for 15 min and incubate by shaking at 150 rpm and 28 °C for 72 h or another specific duration; this time depends on the experimental design used and the study strain. For example, S. radiatum strain can produce EPS at 72 h and its maximum production is reached at 144 h. L. crinitus strain can produce EPS at 144 h. Other fungal spices may require more time for EPS production.Note: Work under laminar flow cabinet. EPS extraction Neutralization and enzyme inactivation.After the incubation time, add the culture to a 500 mL beaker and measure the pH. The pH can be between 4 and 5.Add sterile distilled water in a 2:1 ratio (100 mL of H2O to 50 mL of culture).Homogenize the cultures (mycelia and liquid) using immersion blender (two pulses).Neutralize the mixture (pH = 7.0) using NaOH (0.1 N).",
    "Transfer the mixture to a 250 mL borosilicate glass bottle and incubate in a water bath for 30 min at 80 °C.Note: Work under fume hood. Weighing mycelial biomass and EPS.Place 20 mL of the mixture in 50 mL conical tubes. In the following steps, the weight of the mycelial biomass and EPS will be determined.Centrifuge at 10,610× g for 30 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 50 mL conical tube. Add cold ethanol (99.8%) to the supernatant in a 1:1 ratio for EPS precipitation. Store this mixture and biomass pellet at 4 °C for 12 h.Transfer the precipitated EPS and biomass pellets obtained by centrifugation to quantitative filter paper discs and place them on 100 mm × 15 mm Petri dishes that were previously weighed. Place each sample on a different filter/Petri dish.Incubate the Petri dishes in a drying stove at 100–110 °C for 2 h.Place the Petri dishes in a desiccator for 30 min.Subsequently, weigh the Petri dishes for each sample (EPS precipitated and biomass pellet).Use the following formula to calculate the dry weight of biomass and EPS:Dry weight = (C - A)/(B - A) × 100where A is the weight of the empty filter paper/Petri dish, B is the weight of the filter paper/Petri dish with the fresh sample, and C is the weight of the filter paper/Petri dish with the dried sample.EPS purification.Filter 130 mL of the mixture derived from step B1e using a quantitative paper (pore size: 10 μm). Use a borosilicate glass filtration system.Repeat the filtering step twice using a quantitative paper (pore size: 3 μm). Use a borosilicate glass filtration system. This prevents the passage of small fragments of mycelium.Transfer the mixture to 50 mL conical tubes.Centrifuge at 10,610× g for 30 min at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a 500 mL borosilicate glass bottle.Add cold ethanol (96%) in a 1:1 ratio for EPS precipitation. Incubate at 4 °C for 12 h (Figure 1a).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4841/bioprotoc-13-19-4841-g001.jpgFigure 1. Precipitation, lyophilization, and solubilization of exopolysaccharides (EPS) obtained from submerged cultures of macrofungi Separate the EPS using a 40 μm sieve. The EPS will be suspended on top of the sieve. Use a container under the sieve to collect the ethanol (see Graphical overview, steps 8, 9, and 10). It is also possible to use filter paper of the same pore size.Add sterile distilled water and repeat steps B3f and B3g.Place the obtained EPS in an ultra-low temperature freezer (-85 °C, 2 h).Freeze-dry the EPS (see Table 1).Table 1.

Do not heat.Add sterile distilled water to a final volume of 25 mL.The final concentration is 4 mg/mL.The final concentration of NaOH is 0.005 N.You can prepare solutions at different concentrations as required by assays.Consider the volume of NaOH (0.1 N) used because it can modify the EPS structure. In this case, it is recommended to use the smallest volume possible and not exceed the final concentration of 0.005 N.The prepared EPS solution can be stored at 4 °C (Figure 1c)."
