    "Ethics Statement: All experimental procedures on zebrafish were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tunghai University (IRB Approval NO. 101-12) and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.\n1. Stock Solutions for 3β-Hsd Enzymatic Activity Staining\nPrepare trans-dehydroandrosterone [10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)].\nPrepare β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (1.2 mg/ml in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2).\nPrepare nicotinamide (vitamin B3, 50 mg/ml in H2O).\nPrepare 4-nitro blue tetrazolium (50 mg/ml in 70% dimethylformamide).\nAliquot all these components into microfuge tubes and store at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: In our experience, repeated freezing and thawing of the aliquots of all the aforementioned solutions do not affect the intensity of 3β-Hsd activity staining.\n2. Whole-mount 3β-Hsd Activity Staining\nNOTE: The 3β-Hsd enzymatic activity is detectable in zebrafish embryos as early as 28 hours post fertilization (hpf) when cultured at 28.5 °C, which is consistent with the onset of mRNA expression of hsd3b12,7. The whole-mount 3β-Hsd activity staining protocol in this study is based on a previously described method8 and was determined to be successful in the developing zebrafish up to 7 days post fertilization9. For analyzing the vascular microenvironment of the interrenal steroidogenic tissue, whole-mount 3β-Hsd activity staining must be applied to transgenic lines expressing endothelium-specific fluorescence, such as Tg(kdrl:EGFP)s843 14 and Tg(kdrl:mCherry)ci5 15. To analyze the interrenal steroidogenic tissue considering zebrafish kidney development, 3β-Hsd activity staining can be applied to the Tg(wt1b:GFP)li1 fish16, where the formation of the glomerulus and pronephric tubules is delineated.\nTreat the developing zebrafish by incubating them in 0.03% phenylthiourea in egg water (0.06 mg/L reef salt in deionized water), starting from a stage between 12 and 24 hpf, to inhibit pigment formation.",
    "Fix dechorionated embryos or larvae in (A) 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PFAT) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) or (B) 2% PFAT overnight at 4 °C or for 2 hr at 4 °C, followed by 4 hr at RT.\n\tCaution: PFA is toxic by inhalation and by skin contact. It is destructive to the skin, mucous membranes, eyes, and upper respiratory tract.\nWash the embryos 4x for 10 min with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) at RT.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to not dry the samples while changing the washing solutions.\nFreshly prepare the staining solution before the reactions (Table 1). Prepare, vortex, and centrifuge parts A and B in separate tubes.\n\tNOTE: Adding all the components straight into one single tube would cause severe precipitation.\nAdd the entire solution of part A to the entire solution of part B, mix well to prepare the staining solution, and immediately distribute 1 ml into each microfuge tube containing fixed and washed embryos.\nWrap microfuge tubes with aluminum foil to protect them from light and place on either a rotator or a rocking platform for gentle shaking at RT.\nEmpirically determine the reaction time by monitoring chromogenic signals through microscopy. Slight precipitations will develop over time; however, they will not interfere with the reaction process.\n\tNOTE: For embryos fixed at 28 hpf, staining at 25 °C for 4 hr generates a clear signal at the interrenal tissue.\nStop the reaction by washing 4x for 10 min in PBST. If no further immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis is required, post-fix the stained embryos with 4% PFAT for 60 min at RT. Otherwise, store the washed embryos at 4 °C until further use.",
    "For whole-mount microscopy, clear the stained, post-fixed, and washed embryos with 50% glycerol in PBS, orient them with the dorsal side facing up on a slide, and observe using an upright microscope under bright field illumination.\n\tNOTE: To make a high-resolution image of the interrenal tissue morphology, flat-mount analysis of the 3β-Hsd activity-stained and deyolked embryo is recommended. As the interrenal steroidogenic tissue is positioned right above the yolk sac, a ventral flat-mount analysis of the interrenal tissue allows a direct and clear observation of the interrenal morphology17.\n3. IHC Analysis of 3β-Hsd Activity-stained Embryos\nNOTE: For analyzing the vascular microenvironment of the steroidogenic tissue, the 3β-Hsd activity-stained embryos with a transgenic endothelium-specific fluorescent reporter are subjected to transverse vibratome sectioning and subsequent IHC analysis12,18.\nPost-fixation\n\t\nPost-fix the 3β-Hsd activity-stained and washed embryos with 2% PFA supplemented with 1%Triton X-100 for 1 hr at 4 °C and wash 4x for 10 min in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBSTx) at RT.\nEmbedding\n\t\nPrepare 4% low-melting agarose by dissolving the agarose in PBS at 95 °C, aliquot into microfuge tubes, and store at 4-8 °C.\nMelt an aliquot of 4% low-melting agarose at 70 °C for 10 min, and then keep the aliquot at 47 °C. Embed each embryo in molten 4% low-melting agarose in a detached cap of a 1.5 ml microfuge tube which serves as a mold, and allow to cool until solid.\nVibratome Sectioning\n\t\nStick a piece of paper tape to the dry platform of the vibratome.",
    "Remove the hardened agarose block from the mold by a razor blade. Apply superglue to the paper tape on the platform, and fix the agarose block onto the paper tape, with the anterior side of the sample facing up. Trim the agarose block to a trapezoidal prism shape, with approximately 4 mm and 8 mm on each side of the upper and lower facets, respectively.\nRinse the sample-containing agarose block with cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 (0.5% PBSTx) by using a dropper.\nSlice the agarose block into 100 µm sections according to the instruction manual of the vibratome. Constantly rinse the agarose block to prevent drying. As each slice is cut, remove it from the vibratome using a 26 G syringe needle, and transfer to a spot plate containing cold 0.5% PBSTx (500 µl /well).\nCollect the 3β-Hsd activity-positive tissue sections by checking under a dissection microscope, and transfer the sections by a pipette tip with its end cut-off (about 1 mm inner diameter at the opening) into a 96-well plate containing cold 0.5% PBSTx (150 µl/well). The tissue samples usually dissociate from the agarose block after this step.\nPermeabilization and Washing\n\t\nWash the slices 6x for 15 min in 0.5% PBSTx at RT, 10 min in PBS, and 4x for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin/1% DMSO/0.1% Triton X-100 (PBDTx).\nBlocking\n\t\nIncubate the slices for 1 hr in 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBDTx at RT.\nPrimary Antibody Reaction\n\t\nIncubate the slices for 1.5 days in PBDTx containing a primary antibody (e.g., rabbit polyclonal anti-human fibronectin and mouse anti-human focal adhesion kinase) at 4 °C.\nWashing\n\t\nWash the slices 6x for 10 min in PBDTx at RT.\nBlocking\n\t\nIncubate the slices for 1 hr in 2% FCS in PBDTx at RT.",
    "Secondary Antibody Reaction\n\t\nIncubate the slices for 1.5 days in PBDTx containing a secondary antibody (fluorophore-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) at 4 °C.\nWashing\n\t\nWash the slices 6x for 10 min in PBDTx at RT and 4x for 10 min in PBST at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: For confocal microscopic analysis, clear the samples with 50% glycerol in PBS.\n4. Confocal Analysis\nObserve the whole mount embryo and the section by a confocal microscope equipped with 10X/0.5 and 20X/0.75 objective lens.\nFor simultaneous detection of the fluorescence and the 3β-Hsd staining, set the multitrack mode as follows: 488 nm argon laser and 505-530 nm bandpass filter for the detection of GFP; 543 nm Helium-Neon laser and 560-615 nm bandpass filter for the detection of mCherry; and transmitted light channel for the detection of 3β-Hsd staining. The pinhole size is 1 Airey unit, and the resolution is 1,024 x 1,024 pixel.\nAssemble the z stacks (with 6 μm interval) as a 3D projection, and merge the projection and the bright field, by using the built-in confocal software.\nSubscription Required.
