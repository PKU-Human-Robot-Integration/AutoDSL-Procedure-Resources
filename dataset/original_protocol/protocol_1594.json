    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\ngPhage library construction\nTiming: 1 month\nThe gPhage display library is constructed in three sequential steps: (i) insert preparation (fragmenting the genomic DNA to the desired size range and making it suitable for cloning), (ii) cloning the purified DNA inserts into the phagemid vector and transformation into bacteria, and (iii) producing phage particles from the library by using a helper phage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). We recommend preparing inserts between 100-500 bp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) because this size range allows for the identification of linear and conformational epitopes that may still be fully sequenced [Illumina Miseq 2×250 bp; Teixeira et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]]. Please see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] in this article for other cloning logistics and details of the gPhage display library construction strategy for T. cruzi: DNA insert size, vector, possible orientation and reading frames of inserts, and genomic coverage distribution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Constructing a gPhage library\n(A) To build the gPhage library, genomic DNA is fragmented and cloned into a phagemid vector such as pG8SAET. Escherichia coli is transformed with the vector and subsequently used to produce the gPhage library displaying the epitopes that can be recognized by the corresponding donor-derived and control-derived immunoglobulins.\n(B) Detail of the fusion transcript encoded by modified pG8SAET. The construct is formed by a signal peptide, the epitope-encoding DNA and the rpVIII gene. When transformed into bacteria, pG8SAET will produce a fusion rpVIII protein, as described.",
    "(C) After fragmentation and cloning, only 1 in 18 inserts will be in the correct frame (i.e., frame 2) to yield a phage particle displaying a T. cruzi-derived peptide. In the correct frame, the mature constructed protein will be formed by the epitope fused in-frame to the rpVIII. For using the phagemid system, co-infection with a helper phage allows the production of native pVIII protein and the other bacteriophage proteins while the pG8SAET phagemid encodes the rpVIII displaying the epitope. These two pVIII proteins (i.e., native and recombinant) will be packed into a hybrid phage construct.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Building and quality control of a Trypanosoma cruzi genomic DNA library\n(A) T. cruzi genomic DNA can be fragmented with the COVARIS S2 ultrasonicator. The image shows an agarose gel electrophoresis comparing T. cruzi DNA before and after fragmentation. The obtained fragments were mainly distributed between 100-500 bp.\n(B) The efficiency of ligation depends on the vector:insert ratio. In the example with T. cruzi fragmented DNA and pG8SAET, the 1:30 ratio yielded the best results. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM, N=3)\n(C) After a PCR amplification of individual clones with primers flanking the insert, each clone will show a particular product size. When using a molecular ladder to calculate the molecular weight of the products, this value serves to estimate the coverage of the library. As a technical cautionary note (shown), a minor subset of clones will have an empty vector (non-insert), with the same size as pG8SAET.",
    "Blunt-ending of genomic DNA fragments Purified genomic DNA may be subjected to fragmentation in a COVARIS S2 equipment (Covaris Inc), which yields fragments in the desired size range in a reproducible manner. If access to such equipment is either unavailable or limited by available resources, one may attempt alternative techniques such as enzyme-based treatment such as DNAse or dsDNA Fragmentase (e.g., NEBNext ds DNA Fragmentase), probe sonication, nebulization, or an optimized combination of these methods.\nQuantify extracted genomic DNA by using the Nanodrop Spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or other spectrophotometric method. Nanodrop is quite suitable because it requires very small amounts of the biological samples.\nFragment DNA in aliquots of 30 μg DNA in 130 μL of TE at the following conditions: Duty cycle – 10%, Intensity – 4, Cycles/burst: 200, time: 80 s.\nAnalyze the fragmentation by electrophoresis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, TAE 2% low-melting- point agarose gel) and visualize the DNA by ethidium bromide staining. The gel should be poured out and run within a cold room or refrigerator to avoid melting.\nObserve and document the fragmented DNA under 320–365 nm UV light (UV A). Excise the DNA between the 100–500 bp range with a sharp surgical scalpel.\nWeigh the gel slice and add 2.5 volumes of TE buffer. Incubate at 65°C for 15 min or until the gel is completely dissolved. Vortexing every few minutes will help accelerate the process.\nAdd an equal volume of 1:1 phenol:chloroform (vol/vol), vortex and then centrifuge it for 5 min at 8,000 × g before carefully discarding the upper organic phase.\nRepeat the previous step until no solids can be observed in the interface between the aqueous and organic phases.\nAdd an equal volume of chloroform, vortex and centrifuge it for 5 min at 8,000 × g. Discard upper organic phase.",
    "Repeat the previous steps as needed until desired amount and purity are obtained (see below).\nQuantify purified DNA using Nanodrop. The yield of DNA recovery after precipitation varies from 50 up to 80%.\nCorrect the DNA 5′ and 3′ ends by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific); this is very important to generate the blunt-ends required for efficient cloning into the vector. Use 1 U of T4 DNA Polymerase per μg of DNA in the presence of 0.1 mM dNTP at 11°C for 20 min.\nStop the reaction by heat inactivation (75°C for 10 min).\nPurify DNA using the QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit. Respect the recommended column capacity by adding only 10 μg of DNA to each column. To be able to purify small fragments (<300 bp), after mixing the sample with 5 volumes of the binding buffer (PB), add 2.5 volumes of 2-propanol and admix it thoroughly.\nRun 100 ng of the material in a 2% agarose gel. A smear within the desired region (100–500 bp) should be observed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nLibrary cloning At this stage, it is necessary to digest the phagemid vector and optimize ligation conditions by varying the vector:insert ratios. It is important to remember that 1 in 18 clones in your final library will (theoretically) display a peptide epitope that belongs to the proteome of the target organism (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). So, this should be taken into consideration in order to properly estimate the library diversity (unique sequences) and genome coverage (average number of genomic-fold coverage). Day 1:\nDigest the chosen phagemid vector with the restriction enzyme. If using the pG8SAET vector, use Eco105I (Thermo Fisher Scientific[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012115_Eco105I_SnaBI_10_UuL_3000U_UG.pdf]) following the standard manufacturer protocol.",
    "Purify the digested vector by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation or an alternative methodology, such as silica column purification (e.g., Qiagen PCR purification kit).\nPerform ligations (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and different vector:insert ratios. To optimize vector:insert ratio, test at least three different ligation conditions using between 50 and 300 ng of insert for 100 ng of the restriction enzyme digested vector. Incubate the ligation reaction at 16°C for 16–24 h. These ligation conditions will roughly correspond to vector:insert molar ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:30 (mol/mol) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1159_5.csv\nDay 2:\nPrecipitate the ligations by adding 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol, 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and centrifuging at 20,000 × g, 4°C for 30 min. Wash with 70% ethanol, then centrifuge for 10–15 min to pellet the DNA (this is important to remove excess salt). Resuspend each ligation in 10 μL of ddH2O.\nTransform each ligated DNA in 100 μL of E. coli DH10B strain by electroporation using a 2-mm gap cuvette (2.5 kV, 200 Ω, 25 μF), and recover in 1 mL of outgrowth media. Culture them at 37°C for 1 h, with agitation (250 rpm). Plate 10-fold serial dilutions (1/10, 1/100 and 1/1,000) in LB agar plates (duplicates) containing 50 μg/mL of carbenicillin plates to estimate the number of total transformants obtained. Day 3:\nCalculate the total number of transformants for each condition based on the number of host bacterial colonies obtained and the dilution factor.",
    "With the optimal conditions and molar ratios empirically determined, scale up the ligation and transformation procedure accordingly to obtain the desired number of transformants (see below and item 5: gPhage display library quality control). In brief, the number of transformants multiplied by the average length of the inserts has to yield a number that is at least 100-times the length of the genome of the organism (ideally, >1,000-times).\nAfter transformation and culture outgrowth for 1 h, pool all transformed bacteria into one tube. Transfer 100 μL to a tube containing 900 μL of LB and perform 10-fold serial dilutions. Plate 100 μL of each dilution in carbenicillin containing agar plates (50 μg/mL) (duplicate). Incubate the plates at 37°C for 16–20 h. This procedure allows for calculating the total number of transformants.\nNote: It is essential to perform colony counting at this time. After 12–16h culture (item i), your culture will be saturated and it is no longer possible to calculate the number of transformants.\nTransfer the bacteria to 500 mL of liquid media (LB 50 μg/ul carbenicillin), and grow at 37°C for 12–16 h, at 250 rpm.\nNext day, purify plasmid DNA by QIAGEN Maxiprep kit and CsCl (or your preferred alternative methodology), re-suspend it in TE buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 8.0) and keep it stored at −20°C. The resulting reagent is a T.cruzi gPhage phage library, that can be used to produce peptide-displaying phage particles for selections. It is expected to obtain 200–500 μg of the library DNA.\nCalculate the total number of transformants in our library based on the number of host bacterial colonies obtained and the dilution factor. To assess the quality of your library, follow the steps below.",
    "Note: Although we have not attempted, using a vector that has the ccdb1 gene[href=https://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-ccdb-the-toxic-key-to-efficient-cloning] as a stuffer may significantly reduce background colonies (with empty vector) and be a time saver as one does not need to purify the backbone after digestion.\nLibrary quality-assurance/quality-control\nAssess library quality control by colony Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): pick random 96 (or more) bacterial colonies infected with the gPhage library and perform colony PCR following polymerase manufacturer instructions (e.g., for ThermoFisher recombinant Taq polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012026_TaqDNAPolymerase_recombinant_5_UuL_100U_UG.pdf], 95°C×3 min; 35 cycles: 95°C×20 s, 55°C×30 s, 72°C×1min30 s; 72°C×5 min, 12°C × hold) and Sanger DNA sequencing primers (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Use the empty vector pG8SAET as control (undigested and single-cut vector). Run samples in an agarose gel and calculate insert size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Comparison with the pG8SAET vector control should reveal whether the clones contain inserts.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1159_6.csv\nQuality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) the resulting gPhage display by DNA sequencing (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]): Pick 30–100 (or more) random bacterial colonies transformed with the gPhage library and sequence the insert by the Sanger sequencing method. Calculate insert length, verify the presence of open-reading frames (ORF) in each insert and make sure the DNA aligns to the genome of the species of interest.\nAssess library quality by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): follow protocols below for Illumina Miseq DNA sequencing and assess insert size distribution, the presence and number of ORF(s), and annotated assignment to reference genomes and/or proteomes.",
    "Note: if resources are limited, it is possible to perform the QA/QC of the gPhage phage library by NGS together with the biopanning selection samples by using DNA bar-coding. If so, it is important to perform the steps described in items a and b to ensure the library yields at least 100-fold coverage of the genome of the organism. It is also recommended that at least 10–20 colonies are sequenced by Sanger (item b) for QA/QC your library.\nLibrary phage amplification and titration Day 1: Transformation and superinfection\nTransform 10 μg of the gPhage library DNA by electroporation into E. coli TG1 strain (Lucigen, also commercialized by Merck). Transfer the transformed bacteria to a new tube. Plate 10-fold serial dilutions to assess the number of transformants as previously explained for DH10B strain (section 2.h) and to ensure it is larger than the original library diversity. For example, if the gPhage library contains 108 unique inserts, you should expect at least 1010 transformants. In contrast to DH10B cloning strain, TG1 has a F′ genotype that enables superinfection by the helper phage and is also an amber codon suppressor strain that allows pVIII protein mounting when using pG8SAET system (there is amber codon between the genomic DNA insert and the pVIII gene).\nRecover your pool of bacteria in 500 mL of LB media and grow for 1 h at 37°C, at 250 rpm. After one hour, add carbenicillin to 50 μg/mL. Grow your pool of transformed bacteria at 37°C (250 rpm agitation) until log-phase (OD600nm–0.4–0.8).",
    "Add 5×1012 plaque-forming units (pfu) of M13KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs) at a final Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 20, and incubate it by shaking at 37°C for 1 h. To calculate the MOI, consider that an OD600nm of 1.0 represents approximately 109 cells/mL. For 500 mL, a total 2.5 cells × 1011 cells are expected and 5×1012 pfu of M13KO7 helper phage corresponds to and MOI of 20.\nAdd kanamycin to a final concentration of 25 μg/mL and grow for 16–20 h at 37°C, 250 rpm. Day 2: Phage precipitation\nPhage particles are purified from the cultured media using the PEG/NaCl method (Giordano et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In brief, remove bacterial cells by centrifuging the bacterial culture at 7,000 × g for 15 min; recover supernatant and add 0.15 vol of PEG/NaCl (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section). Incubate on ice for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g 4°C for 30 min to pellet the phage particles and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the resulting phage pellet in 10 mL of PBS. It helps to let it shake for 15 min at 37°C (250 rpm) and then clarify the phage solution by centrifuging the phage admixture at 7,000 × g for 15 min to remove residual bacterial debris.\nRepeat the procedure. Recover the supernatant and add 0.15 vol of PEG/NaCl, incubate for 1 h at 4°C or on ice and centrifuge at 8,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the phage pellet in 1 mL of PBS 50% glycerol (one may need to increase the volume if the resulting suspension is too viscous). Again, it helps to solubilize the phage particles by incubating for 15 min at 37oC (water bath).",
    "Centrifuge the phage admixture at 20,000 × g for 5 min to remove bacterial aggregates and debris.\nRecover the supernatant, aliquot the gPhage library and store it at −20°C until use. Day 3: Library titration\nThaw an aliquot of your gPhage library and make serial dilutions (from 1/107 to 1/109).\nGrow one colony of E. coli TG1 strain in 10 mL of TB phosphate medium until OD600nm reaches ∼ 0.4–0.8.\nMix 200 μL of the bacteria with 20 μL of the diluted phage aliquots and incubate at 23°C–25°C for 30 min.\nPlate infected bacteria in triplicate in LB agar (50 μg/mL carbenicillin). Incubate at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nNext day: Count the host bacterial colonies and calculate the resulting titers in transducing units (TU) with the appropriate dilution factors.\nLibrary QA/QC",
    "A suitable gPhage display library has to cover at least 100-times the genome of the organism. This is because a substantial number of inserts will produce phage particles that do not display a peptide or will display peptides that correspond to an alternative reading of the genome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Ideally, the gPhage display library should have a coverage greater than 1,000-fold the genome (Teixeira et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Initial estimates may be obtained by calculating insert sizes based on PCR products and then by sequencing them (Sanger, NGS or both). Select random clones from the plates used to calculate the number of transformants, perform PCR reactions and analyze the samples side-by-side with the control empty vector to estimate insert size. Ultimately, a far more precise estimation can be achieved by using NGS sequencing. However, if resources are limited, the quality of the gPhage display library may be initially assessed by PCR and agarose gel estimates followed by Sanger DNA sequencing of 30–100 or so positive clone sample size to confirm that DNA inserts belong to the infectious organism of interest. Then, once the biopanning selection is complete, the gPhage display library may be further analyzed by NGS along with the remaining samples. Once you have information on the size distribution of the clones, one may perform the following mathematical calculations to estimate the coverage of your library in reference to your target genome:\n  L i b r a r y  s i z e = A v e r a g e  i n s e r t  s i z e   (  b p  )  ∗ N u m b e r  o f  T r a n s f o r m a n t s",

If so, the theoretical library coverage would be: 80-times the encoded proteome.\ngPhage display library selection\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "After gPhage display library construction, donor selection and IgG purification from serum samples, one is ready to start the selections. For that, gPhage library is exposed to the immobilized IgG molecules to allow for phage particles displaying specific antigens recognized by the IgG to be captured. After washing away the unbound phage, the remaining phage particles bound to the IgG are recovered by infection with bacteria and amplified for further rounds of selection. It is important to note that we recommend adding excess control IgG during the selection step to prevent binding of phage to IgG constant regions or the selection of ubiquitous antigens. See Teixeira et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] (Fig. 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A within the reference) for an illustrative image of the epitope selection procedure for a T. cruzi library in the setting of patients with Chagas disease.\nIgG immobilization and gPhage library selection Day 1: IgG coating\nImmobilize purified IgG (1 μg in 100 μL of PBS) on 96 wells microtiter high-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Incubate the plate at 4°C for 16–24 h. Start by preparing a culture of E. coli TG1 bacteria by adding one colony in 10 mL of TB phosphate medium. The bacterial culture should be in log-phase (OD600nm–0.4–0.8) for the elution of phage bound to IgG - item e below).\nNote: It is also possible to perform the selection on samples of individual patient; in that case, we recommend the use of protein-G or anti-IgG (Fc fragment) pre-coated microtiter plates to directly capture the patient-derived IgG from sera samples. This step will markedly reduce the required volume of biological sample(s) used in the experiment.\nDay 2: First round of selection",
    "Wash wells 4-four times with PBS 0.1% Tween-20 to remove excess IgG. Block wells with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA) for 1 h at 23°C–25°C.\nAdd the gPhage display library in 100 μL of PBS/BSA plus 10 μg/mL of IgG from your control group. The presence of the control IgG in solution is essential to prevent selection of ubiquitous antigens. Incubate for 2 h at 23°C–25°C. Regarding the amount of gPhage library added, see note below.\nWash the wells ten times with 200μL of PBS.\nAdd 100 μL of your TG1 bacteria (log-phase) in each well and incubate for 30 min at 23°C–25°C.\nRecover infected bacteria and dilute in 10 mL of LB broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/mL).\nTake two or three small aliquots (10 μL each) from the 10 mL suspension and perform 10-fold LB broth serial dilutions. Plate the dilutions in LB agar 50 μg/mL carbenicillin plates and incubate at 37°C. This will allow to calculate how many phage particles were recovered in each round of selection to monitor enrichment (see Note below).\nGrow for 2 h at 37°C at 250 rpm.\nSuperinfect cells with the helper phage by adding 1010 pfu of M13KO7. Incubate cell culture at 37°C for 1 h, with agitation (250 rpm).\nAdd kanamycin to a final concentration of 25 μg/mL. Grow it at 37°C for 16–20 h, with agitation (250 rpm).\nTo prepare for the next round, repeat the IgG immobilization step performed at the beginning of the procedure (item a).",
    "Note: The quantification step may be skipped entirely during the first round of selection in order to avoid loss of phage clones: phage clones that are removed from the 16–20h culture and plated for quantification, are not amplified in the LB broth, and, therefore, will not be present in the successive rounds of selection. When using a gPhage library with a high coverage (>1,000-times the genome), we find that this step is not a cause of concern due to insert redundancy (Teixeira et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nDay 3: Precipitation of first-round phages\nCentrifuge the 16–20 h cell culture for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and add 0.15 volumes of the PEG/NaCl solution to precipitate phage particles. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nExtract plasmid DNA from the remaining cell pellet. We recommend QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (or another method of your preference).\nCount the bacterial colonies of your recovered gPhage plated on the previous day and calculate the number of phage bound to each IgG sample by correcting with the dilution factor and the volume of your culture (10 mL).\nCentrifuge gPhage suspension 10 min at 10,000 × g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the phage pallet in 1 mL of PBS/BSA.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 20,000 × g to remove remaining bacterial cells and debris. Transfer supernatant to a clean microtube to be used for a new round of selection.",
    "Repeat selection procedure for a total of three rounds. Titrate both, the input and output phage for each round. An increase in the ratio output/input is a good indication of positive selection. If necessary, perform a fourth round. However, we find that further rounds of selection often do not improve results due to the takeover of fast amplifying phage particles and loss of diversity.\nNote: The amount of phage input for the first round should be at least 10-times the diversity of the gPhage library. This will assure a fair representation of most phage inserts present in one’s library. However, for the remaining rounds of selection, phage input can be adjusted. In our case (Teixeira et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), we performed two independent biopannings. Although we used similar amounts of gPhage library during the first round (∼ 109 TU) for both selections, we varied the amount of phage during the second and third rounds of selection. This led to a significant difference in the overall number of antigens/epitopes identified. For details, see the discussion of the article.\nSequencing and bioinformatic analysis\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "Next-Generation DNA Sequencing In this step, plasmid DNA obtained from the naïve (unamplified, unselected) library or purified from each successive rounds of selection is used to generate amplicons suitable for Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The addition of variable length degenerations (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) between the region of interest and the partial Illumina adapters removes the need for PhiX spike-ins to add diversity to the sequencing pool – this original step increases the number of reads that may be recovered after a sequencing run by 10–25% depending on the protocol used. Specific primers for pG8SAET containing degeneration and Illumina adapters are listed in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and are used for the first PCR step (which adds partial Illumina adapter sequence). It is also important to use a high-fidelity polymerase such as NEB Q5 or Roche Kapa HiFi. A similar protocol is also detailed in a previous work of our group (Tang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1159_7.csv\nUse 10 ng of the plasmid DNA from the gPhage display selection and the unselected library as the template for your first PCR reaction and follow the DNA polymerase manufacturer instructions for the PCR (for KAPA HiFi[href=https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KAPA-HiFi-HotStart-ReadyMix-PCR-Kit_KR0370-%E2%80%93-v10.19.pdf], 95°C × 3 min; 20 cycles: 98°C×15 s, 58°C×15 s, 72°C×45 s; 72°C×2 min; 12°C × hold). Mix all 8 primers (4 forward and 4 reverse) in each reaction.\nPurify the PCR products by using silica columns (e.g., QIAquick PCR Purification Kit).",
    "Perform the second PCR reaction with the Nextera XT kit[href=https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/nextera-xt-dna.html] (Illumina) primers to add the indexation (for KAPA HiFi, 95°C × 3 min; 8 cycles: 98°C×15 s, 55°C×15 s, 72°C×45 s; 72°C×2 min; 12°C × hold). Follow the standard manufacturer protocol to prepare and quantify your sample. Quantification by qPCR at this step will help adjust library concentration (Library Quantification Kit, Kapa Biosystems). We recommend a 4 nM final concentration of your sequencing library.\nSequence your samples using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles) on an Illumina MiSeq equipment. Other platforms, such as NovaSeq (SP 2×250 cycles Illumina), can be used for increased throughput. Depending on the expected insert length, one can choose to use a different number of cycles (e.g., 2×150 bp), but at the cost of losing longer sequences.\nNote: The PCR reaction should be limited to the minimal number of cycles possible to avoid introduction of point mutations and/or amplification-induced biases in our samples. We used 20 cycles for the first PCR and 8 for the second. We recommend the KAPA Hifi Hotstart ReadyMix 2× (Roche) or equivalent for PCR.",
    "NGS Data Analysis Sequencing data analysis is done in two steps. In the first step we process raw reads, from which the peptide sequences are inferred. In the second step we process the peptide sequences to generate a nonredundant peptide sequence dataset. The reason for the second step is the following: If a gPhage display library has high coverage, several slightly different peptides that correspond to the same epitope may be recovered. In general, it means that peptide sequence clustering is necessary to generate a nonredundant epitope/antigen sequence dataset. All files necessary to run the pipeline have been supplied (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Mmc1.zip] and S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Mmc2.zip]) or can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/aarteixeira/gPhage/[href=https://github.com/aarteixeira/gPhage/]) (preferred, in order to use the most up-to-date version of the scripts).

This setting is recommended only for your samples and not for the gPhage naïve library, since most sequences will be unique.\nTo remove DNA sequences that do not match the reference genome, change option_remove_DNA_below_the arbitrary cutoff to True and set the minimum identity at cutoff_dna_identity (we currently recommend 90% or higher).\nTo remove peptide sequences that do not match the reference proteome, change option_remove_peptide_below_cutoff to True and set the minimum identity at cutoff_peptide_similarity (we currently use 60% or higher).\nRun the script: “python3 dna_processing.py” to obtain de output files (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1159_9.csv\nNote: Another consideration is whether the bacteria you have used to amplify the library is a suppressor strain. For TG1 bacteria (amber suppressor), the codon TAG codes for a glutamine instead of the usual stop codon. Our script takes this change into consideration.\nHaving obtained all the information regarding the peptide sequences of interest, one may now generate clusters to characterize the epitopes using the script clustering.py (Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Mmc2.zip]).\nMake sure you have Python3 installed with the packages Biopython and FuzzyWuzzy installed (Levenshtein, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMake sure you have the software MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and HMMER (Mistry et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) installed and change the variables MAFFT, HMMBUILD, and HMMEMIT (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]) to reflect the path to the corresponding executables.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1159_10.csv\nCreate a file named peptides.txt containing all peptides to be clustered (one peptide per line) in the same folder containing the script.

It is necessary to determine the percentage of transformants that contain T. cruzi inserts. Considering the total number of transformants, one may use BLASTn to determine the percentage of clones corresponding to your target organism. The scripts used for library characterization are available in Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Mmc1.zip].\nNote: In our study, the gPhage library contained ∼4×108 (as determined by the number of bacterial colonies when plating the library after initial transformation). In this step, the equation (see Library QA/QC step) is used to calculate the real coverage. NGS of ∼2.2×105 sequences showed high diversity (99% unique sequences) with an average size of 143 bp and that 75% clones (∼3×108) contained a T. cruzi insert. All this corresponds to a total of ∼4.3×1010 bp of the T. cruzi haploid genome (3×107 bp) or ∼1,400 times. However, due to the blunt-end cloning strategy, inserts may be cloned in all possible reading frames and orientations. So, not all inserts result in peptide display and not all displayed peptides correspond to a T. cruzi protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, some peptides may be derived from alternative reading frames of the genome). Taking this into consideration, only 17.8% of the inserts in our gPhage library encode a peptide and among those, only half (8.9%) share some degree of similarity (60%) with a T. cruzi protein.\nIdentified epitope validation\nTiming: 3 weeks",
    "To validate identified epitopes one may choose two alternative routes: (i) To use synthetic peptides and direct ELISA assays or, (ii) To perform sandwich ELISA or FLISA (Fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay) assays by using gPhage particles displaying the epitope. The first option is straightforward and may allow the validation of linear epitopes, granted that the synthetic peptide binds the ELISA plate. However, for most epitopes (including but not limited to conformational ones) and those in which the synthetic peptide does not adhere to plastic, one can use an indirect approach in which the donor IgG is first coated onto the ELISA plate, incubated with the gPhage particles displaying the peptide of interest, and finally detected by using a secondary reagent (Sandwich gPhage-based assays). This option has the advantage that the peptide will retain its original conformation as displayed on the phage particle.\nDirect ELISA validation with peptides\nThe NGS data generated is a useful starting point to select candidates. Epitopes highly enriched against the patient serum samples of interest but not against the control serum samples are more likely to be true hits. Often times, the most abundant antigens also contain the highest number of overlapping peptides, which may be used for epitope mapping by identifying the conserved core sequence. A synthetic peptide may then be designed and custom-ordered for validation assays.\nUse standard ELISA to immobilize the peptide on the microtiter wells and test the reactivity against either purified IgGs or serum samples. However, in cases where reactivity is not detected, there is still the possibility that the synthetic peptide does not perfectly mimic the true epitope conformation and/or not adhering well to the plastic surface. Detailed results of the ELISA analysis for Chagas disease-related epitopes screening are shown in Teixeira et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] in the article).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1159-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. A gPhage-based validation assay\n(A) Scheme to illustrate the phage binding assay applicable to validate the specific binding of epitope-containing phage to patient immunoglobulins. The number of colonies obtained after plating and incubation can be multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the Transducing Units (TU, viable phage particles) value. The validation can also be performed by immunoassays with an anti-bacteriophage antibody labeled with HRP or a fluorophore, for example.\n(B) Phage binding assay for a specific phage obtained when performing the panning with a pool of severe cardiomyopathy Chagas disease patients. For this binding assay, two pools of sera from patients with severe cardiomyopathy (S1 IgG, S2 IgG) and two pools of control sera (C1 IgG, C2 IgG) were used. Phage particles (CCC phage) show strong binding to immunoglobulins of patients with severe cardiomyopathy in comparison to the corresponding binding to negative control insertless phage particles (pG8SAET).\n(C) Relative phage binding value (quotient of the CCC and pG8 binding values in Transducing Units for each point) when performing the binding assay with individual patient serum samples. An index (S8) patient serum sample presents a 200-fold CCC/pG8 quotient, indicating a strong sensitivity when incubating the CCC phage particles with the IgG of this patient. The index patient serum was included in the S1 IgG and S2 IgG pools during the panning selection.\n(D) Reactivity of the CCC phage with index patient serial serum dilutions. High-reactivity is observed until 106 dilution. In all cases, error bars represent SEM from biological (N=2) and technical (N=3) replicas.",
    "Sandwich gPhage-based assays This type of assays is useful to assess the reactivity of epitopes that require specific conformations for binding or peptides that may be hard to adhere to the microtiter plates. First, isolate a single bacterial colony with the gPhage displaying the antigen of interest. In cases where the antigen/peptide of interest has a high frequency in the pool of isolated phage particles, the corresponding monoclonal phage may be isolated by sequencing individual bacterial colonies by Sanger DNA sequencing. If that is not possible (i.e., low frequency phage clone), synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the antigen sequence may be ordered and subsequently cloned back into the phagemid vector pG8SAET. It may also be useful to produce phage particles from the empty phagemid – this step will yield particles that do not display any foreign peptides and will serve as a suitable negative control in the binding assays. This protocol can be performed by using purified IgG or by direct capturing the IgGs on the microtiter plate. Also, the quantification step may be performed either by using fluorescent/colorimetric secondary reagents or by rescuing the bound phage with host bacteria infection and plating serial dilutions for colony counting (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nMonoclonal Phage Production\nIn a 50 mL conical tube, inoculate a single bacterial colony of TG1 bacteria infected with the clone of interest into 10 mL of LB broth 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and grow at 37°C, with agitation (250 rpm) until early log phase (OD600nm = ∼0.5).\nPerform the helper phage superinfection, growth, precipitation, and titration of the phage produced as described at “Library phage amplification and titration.”\nIgG immobilization and gPhage binding Option A: Microtiter well coating procedure if working with purified IgG:",
