    "SidJ in vitro Glutamylation ReactionReview the flowchart of the experimental outline of SidJ glutamylation and SdeA activity assays before beginning the procedure (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3811/bioprotoc-10-21-3811-g001.jpgFigure 1. Experimental outline for SidJ in vitro Glutamylation and SdeA Inhibition assay. A flow chart of the general experimental steps described in this procedure. The left branch is to assay the inhibition of SdeA ADP-ribosylation or Phospho-Ribosylation of Ub. The right branch is the experiments to assay PR-Ub ligation to substrates.Thaw recombinantly purified SidJ 89-853, SdeA Core (truncation 211-1152), calmodulin, ubiquitin, and optionally, Rab33b (1-200) on ice.Note: Rab33b 1-200 was used in this assay due to the prominence of a single PR-Ubiquitination band and increased protein stability (Jon Wasilko, Mao Lab, unpublished results). Full-length Rab33b may also be used instead. Preheat dry bath to 37 °C.Prepare stock solutions, on ice, listed in Table 1 by diluting in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl). Prepare NAD solution fresh and use glutamic acid and ATP stocks stored at -80 °C.Table 1. Stock solution concentrations for SidJ in vitro glutamylation and SdeA inhibition reaction imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201028/20201028194846_7407.jpg Pipette the volumes of stock solution listed in SidJ glutamylation reaction row for a 25 μl reaction listed in Table 2 into a chilled 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube on ice. Pipette ATP last to initiate the reaction. Immediately vortex, centrifuge briefly (~10 s max speed), and incubate the samples at 37 °C in a dry bath for 30 min.Note: It is important that samples are mixed thoroughly and centrifuged. SdeA is very active and the reaction mixture needs to be homogenous for maximal inhibition. Optional: Prepare a master mix for Step A5. Combine components contained in all reactions by pipetting stock solutions and 10 μl of reaction buffer per reaction. Prepare approximately 10% more reaction mix than needed for samples.",
    "The addition of reaction buffer to the master mix dilutes components to maintain protein stability. If a master mix is prepared, for each reaction, subtract the volumes of reaction components included in the mix and 10 μl of reaction buffer from the amount used in Table 2.Table 2. SidJ in vitro glutamylation and SdeA modification reaction components and concentrations imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201028/20201028195423_8534.jpgPipette remaining reaction components for the SdeA activity portion of the assay into the tube. If assaying ubiquitin modification, replace Rab33b with reaction buffer. Immediately vortex, centrifuge briefly (~10 s max speed), and incubate samples at 37 °C in a dry bath for 30 min.Note: A master mix containing SdeA modification components and 3 μl reaction buffer per sample can be prepared to minimize pipetting inaccuracies. A negative control excluding NAD would be beneficial for the visualization of the absence of SdeA activity. If assaying ubiquitin modification, separate each reaction into two tubes by pipetting 12.5 μl into another 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. Label tubes and pipette 3 μl of native sample buffer into one tube for native-PAGE analysis, and 3 μl of SDS sample buffer into the other for SDS-PAGE analysis and visualization of protein loading. Vortex to mix and centrifuge briefly (10 s at max speed). If only assaying PR-ubiquitin ligation activity, the reaction can be halted by the addition of 6 μl of SDS sample buffer.Note: Do not include SDS in native sample buffer, native-PAGE gels, or native-PAGE running buffer. Detection of ubiquitin modification and PR-Ubiquitin ligation to Rab33b by gel electrophoresisFor detection of ubiquitin modification, electrophorese 13 μl of the portion of each sample in native sample buffer using a native-PAGE gel and native-PAGE running buffer at 80 V.",
    "Once samples have migrated through stacking gel, increase the voltage to 120 V and electrophorese until dye front migrates 50-75% through the gel.Note: Native-PAGE is required to detect modification of ubiquitin. The use of cold native-PAGE running buffer, placement of gel apparatus on ice, and shortened electrophoresis distance may provide better separation and clarity of protein bands. For detection of PR-Ubiquitin ligation and visualization of protein loading for ubiquitin modification gel, electrophorese 2.5 μl of protein ladder and 13 μl of each reaction in SDS sample buffer using an SDS-PAGE gel (4% separating gel, 12% resolving gel) and SDS-PAGE running buffer at 80 V. Once samples have migrated through stacking gel, increase the voltage to 150 V and electrophorese until dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.Separate the gel from the casting glass and remove the stacking gel. Transfer the gel to a microwave-safe, plastic container with a lid. Pour Coomassie stain to cover gel and microwave briefly in a covered container, until boiling. Ensure not to inhale fumes when moving the container by maximizing distance from the container. Stain gel by rocking for a few hours, to overnight, at room temperature.Note: There was some difficulty visualizing the calmodulin band using Coomassie staining. Staining temperature and time may be decreased if calmodulin can be adequately stained. Discard stain and rinse with the destaining solution and incubate in the destaining solution for approximately 30 min to 1 h. Discard solution and repeat incubation. Repeat until protein bands are visible. If some background staining persists, allow longer water destaining in Step B5.Rehydrate gel and destain further by incubation in ddH2O while rocking for 1-2 h. Remove water and repeat if necessary. The addition of a Kim wipe can assist in destaining and provide cleaner gel images.",
    "After the gel is rehydrated, transfer the gel to a sheet protector and image using the gel imager. Wiping dust and staining imperfections with Kim wipe may help obtain clearer images (Figure 2).Analyze results. The addition of phosphoribose or ADP-ribose to ubiquitin by SdeA causes a significant charge alteration relative to the overall size of the small ubiquitin protein. As a result, this alteration greatly shifts the electrophoretic mobility on a native gel, while this modification is not visualized if separating only by protein size as with SDS-PAGE. The inhibition of SdeA prevents the migration shift of ubiquitin (Figure 2A). This assay does not distinguish between the addition of ADP-ribose and further modification to PR-Ub. If assaying the PR-Ubiquitin ligation to Rab33b by SdeA, ligation is detected by incremental 8 kDa band shifts above the unmodified Rab33b band in the presence of NAD. This appearance of increased molecular weight bands corresponds to the attachment of one or multiple PR-Ub to Rab33b. Inhibition of SdeA’s PR-Ubiquitin ligase activity should decrease the intensity of the modified Rab33b compared to the uninhibited SdeA reaction (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3811/bioprotoc-10-21-3811-g002.jpgFigure 2.
