    "Isolation of microgliaKeep all solutions ice-cold through the procedure.Immediately following CO2 euthanasia, open the chest cavity to expose the heart. Insert the 25G butterfly needle into the left ventricle, make a small incision in the right atrium, and slowly perfuse the mouse with 20 ml of PBS with 3 mM EDTA.Cut and peel back the skin to expose the skull. Using scissors, cut the spine at the base of the skull. Starting from the brain stem, cut rostrally along the sagittal suture. Peel the two halves of the skull away to the side. Using tweezers, scoop out the brain and transfer into a 15 ml conical tube containing 5 ml of cold HBSS with 25 mM HEPES and keep on ice.Transfer the brain to a fresh Petri dish on ice and mince the tissue with a scalpel or razor blade into pieces approximately 1 mm in size.Transfer the minced tissue into the 7 ml dounce homogenizer and add 5 ml of HBSS with 25 mM HEPES.The 7 ml dounce homogenizer is supplied with two pestles of slightly different sizes and labeled by the manufacturer. Using the pestle marked “loose,” gently disrupt the tissue, on ice, for approximately 10 strokes. Repeat with the pestle marked “tight” for another 10 strokes.Pour the single-cell suspension into a fresh 15 ml conical tube. Rinse the homogenizer with 5 ml of HBSS with 25 mM HEPES and transfer to the same 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge the single-cell suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Aspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 100% FBS.Add 9 ml of 33% isotonic Percoll solution and mix.Gently add 1 ml of 10% FBS/HBSS over the cell suspension.",

Example plate layout for anti-CD11c PE-Cy7 stained microglia and accompanying FMO controls Transfer 150 µl (approximately 1/7) of the single-cell suspension (approximately 300,000 live cells) from Step A16 to a well of a 96 well v-bottom plate. Repeat for any additional samples. Make sure to include wells for fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls for antigens of interest. For example, if the staining panel includes anti-CD11c PE-Cy7, include a well where cells are stained with all other antibodies EXCEPT for anti-CD11c PE-Cy7. This will account for background fluorescence in that specific channel for each sample.Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4°C.In one swift motion, decant the plate by flicking into a sink. Do not dab the plate dry. Do not flick the plate twice.Resuspend the cells in the plate with 25 µl of diluted FcBlock solution. Incubate at 4°C for 10 min.Add 25 µl of the 2× Microglia Antibody Panel to each well and mix well by pipetting.",
    "Incubate at 4°C for 30 min.Add 150 µl of Flow Staining Buffer to each well. Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4°C.In one swift motion, decant the plate by flicking into a sink. Do not dab the plate dry. Do not flick the plate twice.Resuspend the cells in 200 µl of Flow Staining Buffer. Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4°C.In one swift motion, decant the plate by flicking into a sink. Do not dab the plate dry. Do not flick the plate twice.Repeat Steps B8 and B9.Resuspend the cells in 200 µl of Flow Staining Buffer containing 0.1 µg/ml DAPI.Transfer the samples to a 40 µm mesh filter plate and centrifuge for 1 min at 100 × g to bring the samples to the lower chamber.Transfer the samples to cluster tubes and keep on ice, protected from light. Promptly proceed with Section C: single-color compensation controls.Preparation of single-color compensation controlsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4091/bioprotoc-11-14-4091-g003.jpgFigure 3. Sample plate layout for compensation control beads For the number of fluorochromes used, add one drop of compensation beads to the same number of wells on a separate 96 well v-bottom plate. Include one extra well of beads for an unstained compensation control. Refer to Figure 3 for a sample layout.Add 150 µl of Flow Staining Buffer to each well.Add 1 µl of a single fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to a single well. Repeat for the remaining fluorochromes and wells. Do not add any antibody to the well containing the unstained compensation control. Incubate 15 min at room temperature, protected from light.Centrifuge the plate at 300 × g for 3 min at 4°C.In one swift motion, decant the plate by flicking into a sink. Do not dab the plate dry. Do not flick the plate twice.",
    "Resuspend the beads in 200 µl of flow staining buffer and transfer them to cluster tubes. Acquire promptly on the flow cytometer along with stained samples from Section B.Sample acquisition on a 5-laser LSR Fortessa X-20In Diva, create your experiment and select the detection channels corresponding to the fluorochrome panel used to stain your samples in Section B. For microglia, it is highly recommended to include an additional unoccupied detection channel (e.g., 488 nm laser, 710/50 nm bandpass) to record background autofluorescence.Create compensation controls for your experiment in Diva and acquire each individual single-color control, including the unstained beads, from Section C.Calculate the compensation matrix and then run the samples of interest from Section B."
