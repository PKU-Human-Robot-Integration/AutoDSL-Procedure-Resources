    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLoading and extracting data\nTiming: 30 min\nThe purpose of this step is to quantify the fluorescence intensity from the images acquired during the BI assay. It is performed in the Open-source FIJI software where data (images) are loaded, and raw data, as fluorescence intensity, are extracted to be used in the next step to quantify the Papp.\nNote: To download the open-source software use this link https://fiji.sc/#download[href=https://fiji.sc/#download].\nOpen FIJI software and load the images acquired in the step before.\nGo to the directory where the data are stored.\nSort the data by “Date” by clicking on column heading (just below the address bar) label “Date”. The small blue arrow in the column heading should point upward (Sorting oldest to newest).\nSelect all the data by clicking Ctrl + A and drag them into FIJI.\nCritical: Pay attention while loading the images that they follow the right order. For more information check problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: in total in our example there are 210 images (30 chips, 1 dye, 7 timepoints).\nOrganize images into a stack (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2376-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organize images into a stack\n(A) Access from the menu to open “Image to stack” step 2.a.\n(B) Fill in the “Image to Stack” menu step 2.b.\n(C) Single images will get concatenate in one stack step 2.c.\n(D) Scroll bar in the bottom- left part of the stack window step 2.d.\n(E) Information about number of images and label of the image visualized in the stack are in the top-left part of the stack window (steps 2.d.i and 2.d.ii).\nIn the menu bar of FIJI select Image > Stacks > Images to Stack (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nIn the “Image to Stack” menu fill in or tick on (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B):",
    "“Name”: choose a suitable name for the file.\n“Use Titles as labels”: tick on.\nSelect “ok”.\nThe stack will be created (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInspect the stack:\nInformation about the stack and the chip visualized in the stack, are shown in the top left corner of the stack window. The total number of images in the stack (210) and the image currently visualized in the stack (1) are indicated with “c: 1/210”. Next to it there is the label of the image express as “chip_dye_timepoint” (B02_W2_TP1 in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nBy scrolling the scroll bar (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E), at the bottom of the stack, it is possible to change the image visualized.\nOptional: Change the order of the images in case is needed. In the menu bar select Image → Stacks → Tools → Stack Sorter.\nConvert the stack into an hyperstack (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In the hyperstack, chips and timepoints are indicated as slices (z = 30), and frames (t = 7), respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2376-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Convert the stack into an hyperstack (step 3)\n(A) Access the menu to open the “Stack to Hyperstack” option (step 3.a).\n(B) Fill in the “Convert to Hyperstack” menu with the appropriate number of channels (step 3.b) (c), slices (z) and frames (t).\n(C) The stack is transformed in hyperstack (step 3.c).\n(D) Scroll bars in the bottom- left part of the hyperstack window (step 4.a).\n(E) Information about c, z, t and label of the image are in the top-left part of the hyperstack window (step 4.b).\nIn the menu bar select Image > Hyperstacks > Stack to Hyperstack… (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nIn the “Convert to Hyperstack” menu (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Select “Order” based on how the images are ordered (xyctz). In the example reported the order is dyes (c), timepoints (t) and chips (z) (i.e., N23_W2_TP1, N23_W2_TP2;… N23_W2_TP7, N20_W2_TP1…..N20_W2_TP7).\nFill in with the number of channels (c), slices (z), frames (t). The product c × z × t has to be equal to the number of images in the stack (c = 1, z = 30, t = 7, 1 ∗ 30 ∗ 7 = 210 images).\nSelect “ok”\nThe hyperstack will be generated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nInspect the hyperstack.\nIn the bottom of the hyperstack window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) there are two scroll bars, check from the top to the bottom, that each scroll bar contains the correct image:\n“Z” scroll bar: to change the chip visualized in the hyperstack (30 chips).\n“imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2376-Fx4.jpg” scroll bar: to change the timepoint visualized in the hyperstack (7 TPs).\nNote: in case there are multiple channels a third scroll bar will be present: “C” scroll bar: to change the dye visualized in the hyperstack wondow (2 dyes).\nIn the top left corner of the hyperstack window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) there are information about the hyperstack and the image currently visualize in the window (z: 1/30 t: 1/7 in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) and label of chip visualized ((B02_W2_TP2) in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nz: 1/30 t: 1/7 indicate that there are 30 chips (z) and 7 timepoints (t) and that the image visualized in the window is the first timepoint of the first chip label as B02_W2_TP1.\nAlign the images in the hyperstack (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2376-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Align images in the hyperstack (step 5)\n(A) Open the align plugin (step 5.a).\n(B) Fill in the information to run the alignment (step 5.b).\n(C) Press “ok”",
    "(D) Select an area which will be used by the plugin to align all the images (step 5.d).\nIn the menu bar select Plugins → Template Matching → Align slices in Stack… (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nIn the “Align slices in stack” menu select “ok” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B):\nThe matching method should be left at the default (Normalized correlation coefficient) but can be adjusted for specific scenarios. For more information see: https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/template-matching-ij-plugin[href=https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/template-matching-ij-plugin].\nOptional: Adjust the Search area (pixels around ROI) value. The value should be set based on the drift observed in the images. If there is a large drift present in the images this value could be between 50–80 pixels. Usually about 30 should suffice.\nAn “Align slices” message will pop-up select “ok”.\nSelect a region, in the image, which includes the bended part of the microfluidic chip (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) and the alignment will be performed.\nCheck that the images are aligned. See Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16] for representative image of when the alignment fails or succeed.\nNote: In case there is a large drift between images and the alignment fails check problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nQuantify fluorescence intensity in donor and receiver channel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2376-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
