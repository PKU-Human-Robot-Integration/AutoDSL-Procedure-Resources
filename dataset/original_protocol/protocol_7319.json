    "Zebrafish mating setup (Day 0); 10 min At the night before collecting embryos, arrange pairs of male and female zebrafish separated by a divider (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4525/bioprotoc-12-19-4525-g005.jpgFigure 5. Zebrafish breeding tank with a divider. Male and female zebrafish are separated by a divider which prevents contact for mating. The images are viewed from overhead angle (left) and from the side (right). The divider is then removed, which allows male zebrafish to contact female zebrafish for mating.Note: Young adult zebrafish (3–9 months old) should be used for the crossing. The quality of zebrafish embryos affects screening efficiency (critical step). Water temperature is 27 °C. Duration of sunshine is set from 7:00 to 19:00. Embryo collection and distribution (Day 1); 80 min Remove the divider to allow the fish to spawn in the morning (7:00–10:00).Allow crossing for 10 min to obtain zebrafish embryos of the same developmental stage. For example, if more than 20 chemicals are tested, the crossing might be performed three times at three different time points (Group A: 8:30, Group B: 9:00, and Group C: 9:30).For example, a 60-drug screening would require approximately 1,300 embryos if each drug needs to be tested at one concentration:Group A: 20 (embryos) × 1 (concentration) × 30 (drugs) + 20 (vehicle control) + 20 (positive control).Group B: 20 (embryos) × 1 (concentration) × 30 (drugs) + 20 (vehicle control) + 20 (positive control).Similarly, if each drug needs to be tested at two concentrations, approximately 2,600 embryos would be required:Group A: 20 (embryos) × 2 (concentrations) × 30 (drugs) + 40 (vehicle controls) + 20 (positive control).Group B: 20 (embryos) × 2 (concentrations) × 30 (drugs) + 40 (vehicle controls) + 20 (positive control).After 10 min, replace the divider to prevent the zebrafish from spawning.",
    "Note: This screen measures the suppressor effect of each chemical on the progression of epiboly in live zebrafish embryos. Therefore, epiboly proceeds while the researcher is measuring the effect under a stereoscopic microscope. If more than 20 chemicals need to be tested, the screening should be divided into more than two sessions, and each of the sessions should start at a different time point. For example, if 60 chemicals need to be tested, zebrafish should be crossed at three different time points that are over 30 min apart. That allows 30 min for measuring the effects (critical step). Collect the embryos in 150 mm dishes containing E3 medium and remove dead embryos.Incubate the embryos at 27 °C for 20 min.Collect two-cell stage embryos under the stereoscopic microscope.Note: This step has limited throughput. The collection of zebrafish embryos should be completed during the two-cell stage. Thus, 900–1,200 embryos at the two-cell stage would be the upper limit for one researcher. Array approximately 20 embryos into each well of a 24-well plate.Remove E3 medium from each well by using a pipet.Add 900 µL of E3 medium to each well.Embryo development to the sphere stage; 4 h Incubate the embryos at 27 °C until they develop to the sphere stageNote: The temperature of the E3 medium affects the development rate of zebrafish embryos. Higher temperatures accelerate the development rate; conversely, lower temperatures slow it down (Urushibata et al., 2021). Therefore, a non-uniform temperature in each well of a 24-well plate can cause false positives (critical step). Addition of chemicals; 30 min Prepare a 10-fold concentration of each chemical in E3 medium 30 min before adding the chemicals to the embryos.Note: After preparing the respective 10-fold concentration of the media, the medium should be stored at 27 °C.",
    "When the embryos develop to the sphere stage, add 100 µL of the respective 10-fold media to the wells.For example, a 60-drug screening is divided into three groups:The first set of 20 test chemicals, as well as niclosamide and DMSO as positive and negative controls, are added into group A when embryos from group A develop to the sphere stage.The second set of 20 test chemicals, niclosamide, and DMSO are added into group B when embryos from group B develop to the sphere stage.The last set of 20 test chemicals, niclosamide, and DMSO are added into group C when embryos from group C develop to the sphere stage.Development of DMSO-treated embryos to the 90% epiboly stage; 5 h After adding the test chemicals, incubate the embryos at 27 °C for approximately 5 h.Note: The temperature of the E3 medium affects the development rate of zebrafish embryos. Non-uniform temperature in each well of a 24-well plate would cause false positives (critical step). Measuring the inhibition effects of each chemical; 30 min Compare the epiboly progression of chemical-treated embryos from group A and DMSO-treated embryos under the stereoscopic microscope, when the DMSO-treated embryos develop to the 90% epiboly stage.Note: This step has limited throughput. Comparisons should be completed before DMSO-treated embryos at the 90% epiboly stage develop to the next development stage. Thus, 20–30 chemicals would be the upper limit for one researcher. Compare the epiboly progression of chemical-treated embryos from group B and DMSO-treated embryos under the stereoscopic microscope, when the DMSO-treated embryos develop to the 90% epiboly stage.Compare the epiboly progression of chemical-treated embryos from group C and DMSO-treated embryos under the stereoscopic microscope, when the DMSO-treated embryos develop to the 90% epiboly stage.",
    "Note: Epiboly proceeds while a researcher is comparing the epiboly progression of chemical-treated and DMSO-treated embryos under the stereoscopic microscope. Therefore, measuring the effect should be completed in 30 mins (critical step). To confirm the reproducibility of whether 'hit' chemicals could interrupt the epiboly progression of zebrafish embryos, further testing on subsequent day is advised (critical step)."
