    "LNs were recovered from fresh carcasses of healthy adult Wistar rats sacrificed by cervical dislocation. We followed the NIH Guidelines for Pain and Distress in Laboratory Animals and all procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee and Animal Research of the Research and Education Institute of the Sírio-Libanês hospital (CEUA P 2016-04).\nNOTE: All fresh frozen tissues are considered biohazardous and should be handled using appropriate biosafety precautions.\n1. Lymphadenectomy and Cryosectioning\nPlace fresh carcasses of adult Wistar rats (180-220 g) lying in dorsal recumbency on a clean dissection board at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: LNs must be collected up to 30 min post euthanasia.\nSpray the rat carcass with 70% isopropyl alcohol and use sterilized instruments for LN harvesting.\nLift the abdominal skin with the aid of tweezers and open a cavity with a medial incision without damaging the underlying tissue, exposing the abdominal viscera. Pull out the intestine and the thoracic and abdominal LNs become visible (Figure 1).\nCarefully excise the LNs from each rat with the use of blunt tip scissors to avoid injuring the superior mesenteric artery lying behind.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the location of the resected lymph node, it is necessary to clean other tissues adhered to it, such as mesenteric tissue.\nHarvest LNs into 15 mL conical tubes containing 5 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nProperly discard the rat carcasses.\nRemove fresh LNs from the PBS, roll and dry the node on a dry filter paper. Place it in a small Petri dish and add embedding solution for frozen tissue specimens (O.C.T.) for 2 min.\nTransfer and orientate the LN face down in a desired position in the base of a cryomold, with just enough O.C.T to cover it. Avoid bubbles near the tissue. The sectioning surface is the bottom of the cryomold.",
    "Immediately snap-freeze the cryomold in a Styrofoam cooler with dry ice. When there is still a small part of unfrozen O.C.T. (~20-35 s), transfer the sample to aluminum foil and place it in a cooler with dry ice while continuing to freeze other samples. At the end, store all samples at -80 °C until sectioning.\nSection the LN with a cryostat adjusting section thickness to 5-8 µm. Transfer crysections onto microscope slides.\n\tNOTE: Before sectioning, remove the frozen samples from the -80 °C freezer and allow them to equilibrate to the temperature in the cryostat microtome chamber at -22 °C for approximately 30 min. LN-containing slides can be stored at -80 °C for up to one month.\n2. Cellular Labeling with Fluorescent Dyes\nNOTE: Fluorescent dyes are widely used in cell biology. We prefer to use the long-chain dialkylcarbocyanines labeling (DiI(C18), excitation 549 nm, Emission 565 nm) because they are bright, stable and can be added directly to culture media, does not affecting cell viability or cell adhesive properties25,26.\nDissociate cells growing under ideal conditions (i.e., in complete medium) and resuspend in serum-free medium at a density of 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension (106 cells) to a15 mL conical tube and label with Dil(C18) (2 µg/mL) for 10 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: After 5 min, gently agitate the tubes to avoid cell sedimentation and understaining of sedimented cells. Larger densities require longer incubation times for uniform staining. An optimal incubation time for cell staining varies with cell line. It can be better quantified using the conventional FL2 flow cytometry detection channel (Figure 2A).\nCentrifuge the labeled suspension tubes at 300 x g for 4 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and wash twice in 10 mL of serum-free medium. Recover the cells as red pellets. Resuspend the cells at 106 cells/mL in serum-free medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n3. Precoating Dishes with Poly-L-lysine Solution or BSA as a Seeding Control (Optional)\nNOTE: We used cell culture dishes precoated with PLL as positive loading-control surfaces to ensure that different experimental groups of tumor cells were seeded at the same number, as well as BSA-coated surfaces as negative controls.\nUnder sterile conditions, to prepare PLL- or BSA-coated wells, add 300 µL of PLL (0.1% w/v in H2O) or BSA (diluted at 2.5% w/v in H2O) directly to the 24-well plate and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove solution by aspiration, gently rinse the surface with sterile PBS and air-dry the plate at room temperature in the tissue-culture hood before cell seeding.\n\tNOTE: The final volumes of PLL or BSA must be adjusted according to the area of different well plates.\n4. Seeding Fluorescent-labeled Tumor Cells on LN Cryosections or PLL/BSA-coated Wells\nNOTE: As experimental controls, we used (1) cell culture dishes precoated with PLL or BSA and (2) consecutive sections of the same LN per experiment (see this detail in Figure 2D), where the latter will minimize regional variations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of each LN section, which in turn can dictate the cell adhesion rate. For the following tumor cell adhesion assay, select high quality and sequential LN cryosections.\nGently wash the cryosections twice with PBS and rehydrate with PBS for 15 min at room temperature.\nBlock unspecific adhesion to cryosections with 2.5% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Use immunohistochemistry wash chambers and lamina cradles to ensure that the entire O.C.T was removed during washes and incubations.",
    "Drain the excess BSA on a dry paper towel, dry the outline of LN sections with a cotton swab and encircle the sections using a PAP pen.\nFor the tumor cell adhesion assay, add 100 µL of cell suspension (from step 2.4) to each encircled LN section or well in the 24-well PLL-coated plates and place it in a humidified chamber rack for 1-2 h at 37 °C in the conventional cell culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: The final volume of cell suspension needs be adjusted according to the area of different encircled LNs.\nGently wash off non-adherent cells four times with PBS. Fix the remaining adherent fluorescent cells with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.\n5. Manual Quantification of the Adhesive Index\nNOTE: The adhesive index (i.e., tumor cells/LN mm2) was achieved using a 10X objective and manually counting the number of tumor cells, readily identified by light microscopy and confirmed by a fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2D), per lymph node areas of several independent fields (obtained using National Institute of Health's ImageJ/FIJI software).\nUse a fluorescent microscope with a 10x objective to take separate TIFF images in two channels corresponding to the bright and red-fluorescent fields (Figure 2D). Name and save these images systematically.\nStart ImageJ/FIJI, open the images and set the scale. It is necessary to use a calibration scale (e.g., a micrometric ruler 1 mm) (Figure 2C).\nOpen the photo of the micrometric ruler (or a stage micrometer), select the Straight line tool and draw a straight line that defines a known distance.",
    "In the Analyze menu, select Set Scale. The Distance in pixels will be filled based on the length (in pixels) of the line drawn in step 5.3. The Known distance will be filled with the real distance (in this case, in millimeters) and the unit of length in the Unit of length field (in this case, in millimeters).\nClick on Global (this calibration applies to all images opened in this ImageJ/FIJI session) and press OK.\nLymph node area quantification: Select the Wand tool and by double clicking, open the Wand tool settings. Set mode to 8-connected. Click in the photo and set the tolerance until select all lymph nodes in the photo and press OK. To measure the area, open Analyze | Measure (CTRL + M). The area is expressed in the units set earlier.\nTumor cell quantification: Open the light microscopy/fluorescence images in FIJI software. Select Plugins | Analyze | Cell Counter | Cell Counter. Click on the photo to be quantified and press Initialize button in the cell counter window. Select counter type (1-8) and click on the cells in the photo. To initialize the next photo, press the Reset button in the cell counter window, open the new photo and repeat all steps.\n\tNOTE: LN adhesion index is expressed as the number of adherent tumor cells per LN covered area (cells/mm2).\nSubscription Required.
