    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFixation of fly head\nTiming: 20 min\nFixing the fly head with 4% paraformaldehyde will aid in easier dissection of the eye.\nIncapacitate flies using CO2 then place the flies in a drop of 2% PBST. Wait until anesthetized then transfer to 1× PBS.\nPlace two layers of double-sided tape on a Sylgard dissection plate.\nUse tweezers to move each individual fly onto the tape by its wings.\nRemove the fly head by cutting between the head and thorax with a scalpel.\nMake a small incision at either the posterior or anterior end of the head, but do not bisect the head at this time so the sample handling for the next two steps will be easier.\nFix the head tissue by placing each individual head into a droplet of 4% PFA at room temperature for 10–12 min.\nAfter fixation, remove the heads from 4% PFA and place in a droplet of 1× PBS.\nNote: Work with 3–4 heads (6–8 eyes) at a time, this is the minimal amount for quantification.\nNote: White-eyed flies may be more difficult to work with due to the similar color to the brain. Work with caution.\nDissection of the eye\nTiming: 1–2 h\nDissecting the eye for better antibody staining and confocal microscopy observation.\nTransfer one head from 1× PBS and place on tape. Cut the head along the incision made earlier, separating the two eye tissues.\nPlace one eye back in 1× PBS and remove unwanted tissues on the other eye (such as gena, vibrissae, and brain tissue behind the eye) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1681-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(C) The removed cornea placed next to the eye tissue.\nWith the compound eye facing downward, use the tungsten needle to flick the cornea off the eye.\nGently place the needle on edge of cornea and flick it off of the eye tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nUse a pipette to place the finished eye in 1× PBS for later and continue on the remaining eye.\nNote: Place all heads in 1× PBS and dissect one head at a time to prevent the heads from drying out.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Flicking of the cornea, related to step 2\nWith the tungsten needle placed on the edge of the cornea, swiftly flick it off of the wanted eye tissue.\nAntibody staining\nTiming: 2 days\nPrimary and secondary antibody staining of eye to observe target protein in eye.\nFor primary antibody staining, wash the eyes in 0.3% PBST at 23°C–25°C 3 times for 10 min each.\nTo wash, use a dropper to place 3 drops of 0.3% PBST adjacently on a Sylgard dissection plate. Use a pipette to transfer the eyes to the first drop of 0.3% PBST, slightly pipetting the eyes in the drop. Transfer to the next drop after 10 min and repeat.\nAfter washing, place the desired antibodies and eyes into each individual well on the Terasaki plate.\nPlace on shaker and shake 6–12 h in 4°C.\nFor secondary antibody staining, take the eyes out of the wells and wash them again at 23°C–25°C in 0.3% PBST 3 times for 10 min each.\nPlace the desired antibodies and eyes into each individual well on the Terasaki plate.\nPlace on shaker and shake for 2 h in room temperature at 25 rpm.",
    "After 2 h, remove the eyes from the Terasaki plate and wash in 0.3% PBST at 23°C–25°C 3 times for 10 min each for the final time.\nNote: The 0.3% PBST drops should be new for each wash.\nMounting\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nMounting the eyes in mounting medium for observation under the confocal microscope.\nUse a pipette to transfer the eyes into a drop of antifade mounting medium on the dissection plate.\nPipette both the eyes and the mounting medium onto the edge of the microscopic slide.\nUse the tungsten needle to flip the compound eye upward (the curve of the eye facing up).\nUse a tweezer to place a small piece of randomly shattered cover glass (#1) near the eyes to prevent the cover glass (#1.5) from directly touching the eyes.\nWith the tungsten needle, carefully place the cover glass on top of the shattered glass and eyes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1681-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Placement of the cover glass\nAngled placement of cover glass over fly eyes and shattered glass. Shown at two angles.\nNote: Place the cover glass at an angle to prevent direct pressure on fly eyes.\nUse a pipette to fill up the remaining space between the microscopic slide and cover glass with mounting medium. Avoid air bubbles.\nCover the four corners of the cover glass with nail polish and let dry.\nNote: Line up the eyes in the middle of the slide for easier observation.\nNote: Our lab uses the LSM 510 two-photon confocal microscope with ZEN software and 40× water immersion objective to scan the Drosophila eye at wavelengths 488, 543, and 647. Different magnifications, objectives, and wavelengths may be modified to the desired outcomes."
