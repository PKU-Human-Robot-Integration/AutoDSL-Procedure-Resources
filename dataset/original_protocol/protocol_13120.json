    "1. Preparation of plant samples\nCollect two-month-old cotton plants from the greenhouse (Figure 1A).\nFlip plant pots gently to separate soil and roots with intact lateral roots by loosening the soil around the plant (Figure 1B).\nWash the collected plants thoroughly in trays filled with water to remove all the dirt (for root samples) (Figure 1C).\nUse paper towels to dry separated root, stem, and leaf tissues, and label them (Figure 1D). Air dry for 2 days at room temperature to prevent any fungal contamination (Figure 1E).\nTransfer sample tissues to labelled containers/aluminum foils and incubate in a temperature-controlled incubator at 49 °C for 7 to 10 days (Figure 1F).\n\tNOTE: Higher temperatures may alter the lignin structure. Alternatively, a freeze dryer can be used to dry samples for 1 to 2 days without causing any chemical changes to the plant biomass.\nUse a blade to cut the incubator dried tissue into 5 mm size pieces or alternatively employ a biomass grinder to grind the plant tissues (Figure 1G, Figure 1H).\n\tNOTE: The biomass grinder/blade must be cleaned after each sample was cut/ground.\nTransfer the cut tissue/biomass grounded plant material into grinding vials and grind into fine powder of 1 mm size using a freezer mill or cryogenic grinder with liquid N2.\nGrind samples for three cycles at the rate of 10 CPS (each cycle span of 2 min) into a uniform powder (Figure 1I, 1J, 1K).\n\t​NOTE: The experiment can be paused at this point and samples can be stored at room temperature in airtight containers for long-term storage.\n2. Washing samples with water, PSB, and methanol\nMeasure and record the weight of all empty 2 mL microfuge tubes used for lignin content estimation in the lab notebook.",
    "Transfer 20 mg of the ground sample powder to the pre-weighed tube. Weigh the tube with tissue and tissue powder and record these weights in the lab notebook.\nIncubate all 2 mL microfuge tubes (with open lids) with 20 mg of tissue powder in a heat block or oven at 60 °C for 1 hour.\nAfter incubation, cool samples for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd 1.8 mL of water to each microfuge tube and mix by vortexing. Then, centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT and discard the supernatant (Figure 2).\nAdd 1.8 mL of Protein Solubilization buffer (PSB) (Table 1) to each retained pellet and mix by vortexing. Centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 2.6 again for each sample.\nAdd 1.8 mL of water to each pellet, mix by vortexing, and centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min. After centrifugation, save the pellet and discard the supernatant.\nTo the retained pellet, add 1.8 mL of methanol and incubate in a 60 °C heat block for 20 min. Then, centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT. After centrifugation, discard the supernatant and retain the pellet (Figure 2).\nRepeat step 2.9 again for each sample.\nAir dry the pellet at RT or proceed immediately by vacuum drying. Vacuum dry using vacuum drier at 30 °C for 2 to 3 hours or until the pellet is completely dry.\n\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused at this point by air drying over-night or continue by vacuum drying.",
    "After drying, weigh sample tubes with the dried pellet and record the weight next to the respective empty tube weight in the lab notebook. Estimate the pellet weight by subtracting the two values. These weights will be used for lignin estimation at the end of lignin extraction process.\nAt this point of lignin extraction, include the commercial bamboo lignin for generation of the lignin standard curve. Measure commercial bamboo lignin into separate tubes ranging from 0.5 mg to 5 mg in 0.5 mg increments (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 3.5 mg, 4 mg, 4.5 mg, and 5.0 mg). Measure each concentration three times for three technical replicates.\n\t​NOTE: From here on, the standards measured in the above step were processed in the same way as samples that were dried.\n3. Treatment of pellet with TGA and acid to precipitate lignin\nSubject processed samples from the above step, along with measured standards, to TGA (thioglycolic acid) treatment.\nAdd 1 mL of 3 N HCl (Table 1) and 100 µL of TGA to each pellet.\nVortex and incubate in an 80 °C preheated heat block for 3 hours in a fume hood (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The heating step at 80 °C must be monitored. High pressure buildup may open the lids and can lead to chemical spills. Screw cap tubes are recommended but 2 mL tubes can be loosely capped during this step as an alternative to prevent such spills.\nAfter incubation, cool tubes at RT for 10-15 min and centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: Waste generated from acid and organic solvents must be separated and stored in glass containers with ventilated caps. Use separate glass containers for the collection of TGA-acid waste and acid waste.",
    "After centrifugation, discard the supernatant and retain the pellet. Add 1 mL of water, mix by vortexing, and centrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant and mix the pellet in 1 N NaOH for 24 h at 37 °C shaker/thermal mixer at low speed (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: This incubation time can be reduced to 1 hour7.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge the 2 mL microfuge tubes at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT. Retain the supernatant for the following step.\n\t​NOTE: The procedure involves use of strong acids and other chemicals that are corrosive in nature. Hence, wearing proper PPE is recommended throughout the process of lignin estimation. TGA has a strong unpleasant smell and is corrosive in nature. Hence, it is recommended to use only in the fume hood.\n4. Precipitation of lignin\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh 2 mL microfuge tube and add 200 µL of concentrated HCl. Incubate at 4 °C for 4 hours or overnight (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The extraction process can be paused at this point by extending the refrigeration step to overnight.\nCentrifuge at 25,200 x g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at RT and dissolve the pellet in 1 mL of 1 N NaOH.\nIncubate in the shaker at RT for 10 min to suspend the pellet completely in NaOH.\nFinally, measure the absorbance of samples at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer and compare with the standard lignin curve.\nMeasure the unknown concentration of lignin by using the calibration curve regression line values, and absorbances of extracted samples at 280 nm.\n5. Standard curve preparation and lignin estimation in the sample\nProcess lignin standards in the same way as experimental samples from TGA treatment.",
    "Measure commercial bamboo lignin standards in 0.5 mg increments starting from 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg, 4.0 mg, 4.5 mg and 5 mg. Then, process by TGA, HCl, dissolve in 1 N NaOH followed by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (Figure 3A).\nUse values of lignin concentration and absorbance readings to generate a scattered plot of standard lignin curve (Figure 3B).\nUse the regression line, y = mx+c generated in the scattered plot, for the estimation of unknown lignin content of prepared samples using \"x\" values from average absorbances of extracted samples at 280 nm and \"m\" and \"c\" values from lignin standard curve regression line.\nDivide the lignin content in the resultant y value by total weight of the vacuum/air dried plant biomass sample after methanol extraction in mg (approximately 15 mg) to obtain lignin concentration per mg. Then, multiply this value by 100 to calculate lignin percentage per mg.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
