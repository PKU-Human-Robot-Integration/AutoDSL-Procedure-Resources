    "All methods described here have been approved by the Danish National Authorities (License number: 2018-15-0201-01405) in accordance with Danish and EU animal welfare legislations.\n1. Experimental setup and preparation of distinct contexts\nObject location arena with context\n\tNOTE: The setup below is demonstrated in an enclosed soundproof box (Figure 1B) with the light source located along the edges of the ceiling and the camera located at the center of the ceiling of the box. The arena, 60 cm x 60 cm with walls that are 100-cm high (Figure 1B), is placed inside the box and is fully isolated from the surrounding room. All spatial cues are inside the arena. This simplifies the process of creating distinct contexts. A similar level of isolation from the surrounding room can be achieved by enclosing a normal open-field arena with a uniform curtain around the walls.\n\t\nObtain a square arena made of opaque, non-porous hard plastic with a minimum 60-cm width and a minimum of 50-cm height. Choose a color for the floor contrasting with the color of the rat for successful recording of rat movements by the automated software (if applicable). Place the arena either inside a box (Figure 1B) or on a platform that is enclosed by a curtain.\nTo create a context, obtain a second layer of insertable walls (e.g., wall covering made of the same material as the arena, or plastic wallpaper that can be easily cleaned) in different colors and/or patterns (e.g., black, white, stripes, or dots). Insert the second layer of walls in the arena such that they are distinct from each other.",
    "Obtain three-dimensional (3D) spatial cues (1-2 per context) with dimensions varying between 10 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm and 20 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm (width x length x height) and have (i) distinct geometric shapes and (ii) colors that contrast the wall color. Hang them on the walls high enough so that rats cannot reach these cues.\nObtain different pairs of objects (as many as the context number) that are non-porous, non-chewable, and easy to clean. Aim to have distinct geometric shapes and textures for each new object. Choose objects that are between 5 to 15 cm in width and height (avoid any higher objects). See Figure 1D for examples of four distinct objects (cones, footballs, rectangular prisms, and triangular prisms).\n\t\tNOTE: Each object should be of similar interest to rats, so that the total exploration times for all objects are comparable.\nFind the best solution for attaching the objects on the floor of the arena (e.g., using sticky mats, double-sided tape, attaching a metal plate under the object and a pairing magnet underneath the arena etc.).\nWhen creating another context, re-create the walls such that they contrast the distribution of color and pattern of the walls from the previous context(s). Use new 3D spatial cues that are different from, and contrasting with, all previous cues. See Figure 1C for examples of four distinct contexts.\nObtain a light source that will ensure a diffused and equal illumination within the arena and that has a dimmer option. Adjust the light intensity to approximately 100-120 lux at the corners of the arena after creating each context. Obtain a camera and place it at the center of the ceiling of the box.",
    "​NOTE: The light intensity can be adjusted to a lower level if automated scoring software is not being used.\nObject bucket\n\t\nObtain a bucket (>50 cm in diameter). Do not choose a square shape to avoid any resemblance to the experimental arena. Fill it with bedding material.\nObtain 5-10 objects of different shapes and sizes (different from the objects that are going to be used in the experiment) and randomly place them all in the bucket (Figure 1A).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62458/62458fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: The experimental setup, including four distinct contexts and objects.

Make the software adjustments for each specific context and rat strain before each experiment.\nCounterbalancing of object locations and experimental groups\n\t\nPrepare possible combinations of object locations for encoding and test trials, and name these as counters. Create the combinations such that they cover all corners as object locations, and object movement from adjacent to diagonal corners and vice versa (Figure 2A).",
    "Prepare a schedule for the specific experiment, matching each rat in one experimental group with a counter. Use each pair of the two paired counters (Figure 2A) within one group, if there are enough rats. Use the same set of counters for both experimental groups in a single encoding/test session (Figure 2B). Reassign counters for the following sessions (i.e., each new context).\n\t\tNOTE: Run the rats in a mixed order during encoding/test sessions (e.g., do not run all rats in one cage one after another; instead, rotate cages to ensure a calm environment within a cage of more than one rat).\nWhen using two or more contexts to counterbalance the experimental groups (e.g., 1-h memory versus 24-h memory groups), assign rats to each group, and change the groups in the following contexts (Figure 2B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62458/62458fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Representative counterbalancing methods. (A) Possible orientations of objects in the arena at encoding and test trials are named as counters. Object 1 is always the moving object. Every two counters are counterbalanced such that the location of the moving object changes. Each corner is occupied twice, and object 1 is moved from diagonal to adjacent and vice versa for an equal number of times. (B) Example of encoding/test schedule for two counterbalanced sessions (e.g., contexts 1 and 2). Rats are assigned to experimental conditions in context 1 (session X, left). A set of counter pairs (i.e., 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8) are selected and assigned to each rat in one experimental group. The same set of counters is assigned to rats in both experimental groups. In the following session in context 2 (session X+1; right), the rats in the experimental groups are changed for counterbalancing, and a new set of counter pairs are assigned. The time at the beginning of encoding and test trials should be noted.

Handling and habituation\nStart handling rats beginning either from weaning (if the rats are bred in the home facility) or 2-3 weeks before the beginning of experiments (in the case that the rats are ordered from an external facility, after allowing them to acclimate for one week after arrival).",
    "Spend at least 10-15 min on each cage of 4 rats for 2 or 3 days a week until the rats are comfortable being touched and picked up by the experimenter. Adjust the time allocated per cage depending on the number of rats in a cage.\n\tNOTE: It is important that all experimenters expecting to work with the rats are present during handling.\nIn cases where handling begins at weaning, reduce handling to a minimum (optional) once this level is reached. If beginning 2-3 weeks before the experiments, continue handling until the beginning of habituation sessions.\nBring the rats in their cages to the experiment room to habituate the rats to the transport as well as to the experimental room. Allow rats to sit for at least 30 min to give them time to calm down and habituate. After this time, return the rats/cages to the housing room.\n\tNOTE: Step 2.4 can be combined with handling and repeated as many times as needed. Additional habituation can be implemented at this step if the protocol includes any further manipulations (e.g., handling for the procedure of injections etc.).\nPerform object habituation to habituate rats to interacting with objects and to reduce general stress levels stemming from the experience of new environments.\n\t\nFor session 1, bring all home cages to the experiment room, and let the rats habituate to the room and settle for at least 30 min. Put rats (2-4 rats) from the same cage together in the bucket for 20 min. Clean the bucket by removing any fecal matter between each group of rats. Repeat the procedure for all cages. Put all rats in their home cages and return to the housing room.",
    "For session 2, on a separate day bring all cages to the experiment room and leave for at least 30 min. Put each rat individually in the bucket for 10 min. Place the rat back into the home cage and clean the bucket after each rat. Return all cages to the housing room.\nFor session 3, repeat step 2.5.2 on a separate day.\nIf the experimental apparatus is an enclosed box (Figure 1B), opt to perform empty box habituation to habituate the rats to the new experimental apparatus. In session 4, bring all cages to the experiment room and leave for at least 30 min. Place rats from the same cage together (2-4 rats) in the empty arena with no context or spatial cues (Figure 1B, middle) for 20 min. Place all rats back into the home cage, and wipe the arena with 70% ethanol after each group of rats.\n\tNOTE: Steps 2.5 and 2.6 should be performed in a single week, preceding the context habituation week (step 2.7; see Figure 3). A break for a couple of days during these steps is acceptable. However, after starting step 2.7, each step should be performed on consecutive days as specified, until the end of test trial (step 2.9).\nPerform context habituation to habituate rats to the context and 3D cues, to reduce general stress levels and to support the spatial learning of the environment.\n\t\nModify the empty arena to create the first context as described in section 1.1, but do not put the objects in the arena. Prepare the recording equipment.",
    "For session 1, bring all cages to the experiment room and leave for at least 30 min. Start the recorder if doing this manually. Place the first rat in the center of the arena, and allow the rat to explore the arena for 10 min. Then, stop the recorder (if manual),and place the rat back into the home cage. Wipe the arena thoroughly with 70% ethanol after each rat, and return all cages to the housing room when finished.\nFor sessions 2 and 3, repeat step 2.7.2 for each rat over two consecutive days such that there are 3 sessions of context habituation per rat in total.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider shuffling the order in which rats go into the arena, especially when dealing with a large group. This avoids running specific rats repeatedly at the same time of the day.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62458/62458fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: The design of the behavioral experiment including handling, habituation, and object location task protocols. Rats should be handled regularly starting from few weeks prior to the habituation week. In week 0, object and experimental box habituations are carried out over 4 sessions with at least 24-h intervals in between. In week 1, context habituation is carried out over 3 consecutive sessions with 24-h intervals in between, followed by encoding and test trials. There should be a minimum of 48 h and up to 1 week interval before proceeding with the following session (e.g., begin habituation to the next context in week 2 or 3). Abbreviation: Hab., habituation.

    "NOTE: In the case of pharmacological manipulations, a reasonable time to administer an agent can be either before or immediately after the encoding trial(s) and/or before the test trial depending on the nature of the pharmacological agent.\n\t\nBring all cages to the experiment room and leave for at least 30 min. Using the schedule prepared beforehand (Figure 2B), place the first identical pair of objects in the designated locations (at 2 corners and a distance of >10 cm from each respective wall; an L-shaped piece of cardboard can be used to maintain the same distance each time) by using sticky mats or double-sided tape.\nStart the recorder (if manual). Place the first rat in the arena facing a wall or a corner that is not occupied by any object (equal distance to each object).\n\t\tNOTE: Follow the steps below for either weak or strong encoding.\nFor weak encoding (1 trial), allow the rat to explore the arena and objects for 20 min. Then, stop the recorder (if manual), and place the rat back into the home cage. Remove the objects, and wipe both the objects and the arena thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nRepeat step 2.8.3 for all rats so that each rat receives 1 encoding trial of 20 min.\nFor strong encoding (3 trials), allow the rat to explore the arena and objects for 5 min. Then, stop the recorder (if manual), and place the rat back into the home cage. Do not remove the objects. Wipe the arena and objects with 70% ethanol.",
    "Repeat step 2.8.5 two more times with the same rat such that there are 3 trials in total. Place the rat back into the home cage when the time is up. Remove the objects for thorough cleaning, and wipe the objects and the arena with 70% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: Inter-trial interval for a rat should be approximately 1-2 min.\nRepeat steps 2.8.5-2.8.6 for each rat.\nIf the delay time is shorter than 24 h, keep the cages in the experiment room until the test trial. If not, return all cages to the housing room when completed.\nTest trial (Session 4)\n\tNOTE: The delay period should be counted from the beginning of the encoding trial.\n\t\nIn case of a 24-h delay (or any delay that requires the test trial to be performed the following day), bring all cages to the experiment room, leaving sufficient time ahead of the first test so that the rats can be left for at least 30 min. According to the schedule, place the objects in the designated locations (one of the objects at a new location).\nWhen it is time, start the recorder (if manual). Place the first rat in the arena facing a wall or a corner that is not occupied by any object (equal distance to each object).\nAllow the rat to explore the arena and objects for 5 min. Then, stop the recorder (if manual). Place the rat back into the home cage. Remove the objects, and wipe both the objects and the arena thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nRepeat the steps 2.9.2-2.9.3 for each rat. Return all cages back to the housing room.\n\t\t​NOTE: In each following encoding/test session, start the habituation protocol from step 2.7 (context habituation) after an interval of at least 48 h and up to 1 week.\n3. Data analysis",
    "For each rat, score the exploration time for each object in both the encoding and test trials by using software designed for this purpose or using a manual setup. Score encoding trials for the whole duration. Score test trials for 2 min for best discrimination performance3. If using automated online software scoring, export the scoring data from the software.\nCount exploration time when the rat is in contact with the object, sniffing the object or facing the object at a distance less than 2 cm. Include climbing and sitting on the object as exploration unless the attention of the rat appears to be somewhere other than the object (e.g., looking away from the object).\nCalculate the total exploration time for both objects for each rat. Consider excluding any rat that has a total exploration time of less than 10 s in the test trial (for 2 min scoring) from this test, as it may reflect unreliable exploration.\nCalculate the percentage of exploration for each object (equation 1)or the discrimination index (DI) for each rat (equation 2), and calculate mean values for the groups.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62458/62458eq01.jpg (1)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62458/62458eq02.jpg\n\tNOTE: If % exploration is 50% or DI is 0, it means that the performance is at the chance level, and the rat has no preference for either object. The mean percentage exploration and DI during encoding trials should be ~50% or 0, respectively. Any rat showing a preference higher than [mean ± (2 × SD)] for either object in the encoding trial should be excluded from the analysis of the respective test. This allows for reliable interpretation of preference in the test trial as the memory of the stable object location. This value can be calculated for an individual test or for combined encoding data from several tests.",
    "Analyze the data by the method best fitting the experimental setup. Use a one-sample t-test for detecting a significant preference above the chance level.\nWhile using more than one context with counterbalancing, combine the results of the same experimental condition across contexts.\n\tNOTE: This will result in groups that consist of the same rats, enabling within-subject comparison using a paired t-test for two groups and using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for more than two groups."
