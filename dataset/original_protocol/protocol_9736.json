    "NOTE: The protocol starts with an introduction to (1) the software and (2) the hardware setup to familiarize the user with required installations and the workstation. Following a section on (3) material preparation and (4) the usage of the protocol designer application, (5) the calibration of the pipetting module and (6) the execution of the automated protocol is highlighted in detail. Finally, (7) validation and verification procedures are described, including absorbance reading and data analysis. A general protocol workflow with individual tasks is displayed in Figure 1.\n1. Software setup\nNOTE: This section includes a detailed instruction to install the application programming interface (API) as well as the required protocol designer application and the calibration terminal. The following instructions are written for a Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board computer; however also Windows 8, 10 and macOS 10.13+ have been successfully used with the API and the applications.\nSet up the computer environment.\n\tNOTE: Be familiar with the basics of Python39, how to set up and use a Raspberry Pi40,41, and how to connect to the internet42. The following tutorial steps focus on protocol-specific steps and additional information on the usage of a Raspberry Pi is available online40.\n\t\nOpen a terminal window from the taskbar or application menu.\nUpdate the system’s package list:\n\t\tsudo apt-get update\nUpgrade all the installed packages:\n\t\tsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nRestart the Raspberry Pi:\n\t\tsudo reboot\nCheck installed Python version:\n\t\tpython3 --version\n\t\tMake sure that at least Python 3.5 is installed; if not, install the latest version43.\nInstall python pip, which publishes Python packages with the Python Package Index44:\n\t\tsudo apt-get install python3-pip\nInstall dependencies:\n\t\tpip install numpy\n\t\tpip install python-resize-image\n\t\tNOTE: If you are using Windows, you need to install the windows-curses package via: python -m pip install windows-curses\nInstall the application programming interface (API).",
    "NOTE: The API provides a simple Python framework designed to write experimental protocols script and operate the workstation. The following two APIs are required to successfully execute the generated protocol code.\n\t\nInstall workstation API:\n\t\tpip install openworkstation\nInstall Opentrons API to operate the pipetting module:\n\t\tpip install opentrons==2.5.2\nVerify, if API is installed successfully:\n\t\tpython3\n\t\t>>> import openworkstation\n\t\t>>> import opentrons\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the API and the protocol design application is 2.2 MB and 1.2 MB, respectively. No issues were experienced during the installation when used with limited disk space (200 MB). However, the disk space requirements depend on the operating system.\nSelect a directory for file download (calibration terminal, protocol design application, etc.).\n\tNOTE: Files can be copied and pasted elsewhere afterwards.\nClone files from GitHub repository:\n\tgit clone https://github.com/SebastianEggert/OpenWorkstation\n\tNOTE: The ‘git clone’ command clones and subsequently saves all files into the directory, which is open in the terminal at this time. Since the repository also includes the hardware files for the assembly, not the entire repository is required to execute the presented protocols. All required files to replicate the experiments are available as Supplemental File and in the GitHub repository under “/examples/publication-JoVE”.\nOpen the downloaded folder. If the entire repository was downloaded, navigate to the ‘publication-JoVE’ folder via\n\tcd openworkstation/examples/publication-JoVE\n\tNOTE: This folder includes files required for the operation of the workstation and the usage of the protocol designer application and the calibration terminal.\n2. Hardware setup\nPlace the workstation in a biological safety cabinet to avoid sample contamination.\nInstall pipettes on the workstation.",
    "Select the pipette size based on the experimental setup. In general, take a pipette size which volume to be aspirated is on the higher end of the range. If mixing tasks with volumes greater than 1 mL are required for a specific setup (e.g., aspirating/dispensing of 2 mL), choose the M1000E with a maximal aspirating/dispensing volume of 1,000 µL to minimize pipetting steps and save time.\n\t\tNOTE: A detailed instruction for air-displacement pipettes is available online45. The developed pipetting module is able to integrate the following off-the-shelf positive displacement pipettes: M10E (1–10 µL), M25E (3–25 µL), M50E (20–50 µL), M100E (10–100 µL), M250E (50–250 µL), M1000E (100–1,000 µL).\nUse an M4 Allen key to loosen and tighten screws.\nAttach the two pipette fixation plates (white acrylic plates) to the aluminum rail and tighten M5 screws loosely.\nInsert the pipette into the two pipette fixation plates and ensure that the ergonomic tail of the pipette is resting on the opposite side of the acrylic mounting plate.\nTighten the four screws of the two pipette fixation plates firmly.\nSlide the two square fastening nuts, which are attached to the acrylic mounting plate, into the extrusion slot of the z-axis and tighten screws.\n\t\tNOTE: Fasten pipette tightly to avoid any movement during operation.\n3. Material preparation\nNOTE: The viscous materials (glycerol, GelMA, alginate) are used for the experiments presented in this study, and, therefore, prepared volumes and handling tasks (e.g., add 5 mL of stock solution in 5 mL reaction tubes) are specifically for this experimental setup.\nGelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)\n\tNOTE: GelMA functionalization, dialysis, and lyophilization are not the scope of this paper, and a step-by-step protocol is available in Loessner et al.33. The protocol starts using ﻿lyophilized GelMA, which can be prepared in-house or purchased commercially.",
    "Calculate required mass of GelMA (mGelMA) based on the desired final stock concentration (cGelMA) and volume (VGelMA) using the equation:\n\t\tmGelMA = cGelMA x VGelMA\n\t\tNOTE: VGelMA depends on the experimental setup and it is recommended to prepare 20−30% excess material. The presented protocols start with 5 mL of 20% (w/v) GelMA as a stock solution.\nWeigh the required amount of lyophilized GelMA, add it into a 50 mL reaction tube and add the required amount of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nMix GelMA either by soaking into the solvent at 4 °C overnight or by heating to 60 °C for 6 h in a water bath.\n\t\tNOTE: Sterile GelMA solutions can be stored protected from light at 4 °C for at least six months.\nFill 5 mL of GelMA into 5 mL reaction tubes.\nPhotoinitiator: Lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP)\n\tNOTE: Avoid additional exposure to room light, since LAP is light sensitive.\n\t\nCalculate required mass of LAP (mLAP) based on the desired final stock concentration (cLAP) and required volume (VLAP) using the equation:\n\t\tmLAP = cLAP x VLAP\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to prepare a 3% (w/v) stock solution.\nWeigh the required amount of LAP, add it into a 15 mL reaction tube and add PBS.\nWrap the tube in aluminum foil to prevent photo-induced decomposition.\nDissolve LAP by placing the reaction tube in a water bath at 37 °C for 2 h or until fully dissolved.\nFill 1 mL of LAP stock solution in 5 mL tubes.\nAlginate\n\t\nCalculate required amount of alginate (malginate) based on the desired final stock concentration (calginate) and volume (Valginate) using the equation:\n\t\tmalginate = calginate x Valginate",
    "NOTE: Valginate depends on the experimental setup and it is recommended to prepare 20−30% excess material. The presented protocols start with 5 mL of 4% (w/v) alginate as a stock solution.\n﻿Weigh the required mass of alginate, add it into a 50 mL reaction tubes, and add PBS.\nPlace the alginate mix into a water bath at 37 °C for 4 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The usage of a vortex mixer will accelerate the dissolution process, but also generate air bubbles. Dissolved alginate can be stored at 4 °C for at least six months.\nFill 5 mL of alginate into 5 mL reaction tubes.\nFill 5 mL of glycerol in 5 mL reaction tubes.\nOrange G solution\n\t\nPrepare a 10 mg/mL stock solution of Orange G in a 50 mL reaction tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume depends on the number of experiments. Depending on the diluent type, prepare stock solution either in ultrapure water, PBS or a suitable diluent reagent. In the presented experiments, ultrapure water was used for diluting glycerol and PBS for diluting GelMA and alginate. PBS was used as a diluent for GelMA and alginate, and can be either prepared using tablets or purchased off-the-shelf.\nMix for 10 s by vortexing.\nWrap the tube in aluminum foil to prevent photo-induced decomposition.\n\t\tNOTE: Stock solution can be used after 24 h to ensure proper dissolution of Orange G.\nDilute stock solution to a 1 mg/mL working solution in a 50 mL reaction tube.\nTransfer working solution to appropriate flasks/tubes for the experimental setup.\n\t\tNOTE: For the presented experiments, the working solution was filled into 5 mL tubes. Orange G stock and working solution can be stored at 4 °C and used within three months upon preparation.",
    "Fill 5 mL of the 1 mg/mL Orange G working solution in 5 mL reaction tubes.\n4. Generate protocol code with the protocol designer application\nNOTE: The specified parameters in steps 4.2−4.7 are the same for all conducted experiments, except for the material’s stock concentration and the final output concentration. These parameters are summarized in Table 1 and, in the following, parameters are used to prepare double network hydrogels with 5% (w/v) GelMA, 2% (w/v) alginate, 0.15% (w/v) LAP, and PBS as a diluent.\nOpen the protocol designer application by running ‘ProtocolDesignApp.html’.\n\tNOTE: The app “ProtocolDesignApp.html” guides the user through the parameter selection process and automatically generates the ready-to-use protocol to operate the workstation.
