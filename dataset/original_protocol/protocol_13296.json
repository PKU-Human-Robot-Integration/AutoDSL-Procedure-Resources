    "A brief graphical flow of the protocol is shown in Figure 1. The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (code: 470000013, 4300000011). The data were obtained with the informed consent of the patients. The patients voluntarily signed informed consent prior to the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the ability to follow the doctor's advice; signing the consent form; diagnosis of hemorrhoids; excision of hemorrhoids with Milligan-Morgan surgery (M-M surgery). The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with serious organ diseases; patients with anxiety, depression, or other mental disorders; patients with drug allergies; patients who could not cooperate.\n1. Instrument preparation\nDisinfect all the tools with iodophor cotton swabs, followed by sterile cotton swabs, and then hand sanitizer. No special treatment is needed to disinfect sterile tweezers. Use disposable sterile press needles with dimensions of 0.25 mm x 1.3 mm.\nEnsure that the pulverizer can accommodate more than 200 g of the medicine. Maintain the speed between 25,000-30,000 rpm. Choose a gauze bag with at least a length and width of 10 cm x 8 cm and a treatment towel with a length and width of 50 cm x 40 cm.\nSelect a microwave oven with a rated power of 600-900 W and the capacity for the heat to reach between 80-90 °C in medium or high mode.\nObtain the following ironing medicine for acute pain: Fructus foeniculi 70 g, Fructus aurantii 20 g, Rhizoma curcumae longae 20 g, and Rhizoma corydalis 20 g. Obtain the following ironing medicine for chronic pain: Rhizoma chuanxiong 20 g, Fructus foeniculi 70 g, Radix paeoniae alba 20 g, and Rhizoma curcumae longae 20 g.",
    "Obtain a thermometer that is capable of measuring in the range of 10-110 °C and allows for multiple measurements.\n2. Doctor-patient preparation\nBefore the operation, perform a patient assessment. Evaluate the skin condition in advance. Do not perform the operation when the skin is damaged, infected, or suffering from other skin diseases.\nEvaluate all the equipment. Check all the medical consumables if they are within the usage time, and check the press needles to ensure they are not bent, broken, or have burrs or barbs, etc.\nDisinfection\n\t\nUse pre-sterilized operating instruments in the operation. Ensure they are all disposable medical consumables and are not sterilized in advance.\nCarry out operator disinfection by using hand sanitizer to perform the seven-step handwashing method30.\nCarry out disinfection of the acupoint needle-embedding site using an iodophor cotton swab; perform spiral disinfection of the operation area from the center to the outside. Ensure the diameter of the disinfection site is larger than 3 cm, and let the disinfectant stay for about 1 min until all the iodophor has been volatilized.\n\t\tNOTE: Generally, one disinfectant is enough. If the local area is seriously polluted, three disinfections are required. Prepare the ironing site using warm water to remove the residual dirt on the skin. Additional disinfection is not required.\nPrepare the ironing site after needle-embedding; do not perform this simultaneously.\n3. Operation steps\nNeedle-embedding\n\t\nCarry out acupoint selection (international code). Locate three acupoints, including Erbai (EX-UE2), Chengshan (BL57), Sanyinjiao (SP6; see Figure 2) before the operation. Perform acupoint location selection as done in previous studies in the literature16,31.\nUse sterilized tweezers to grip the edge of the press needle with the left hand, and aim the needle at the selected acupoint.",
    "After positioning the needle, press the needle's tail (bottom side) with the right thumb within 1 s.\nAfter inserting the needle, use the right thumb to gently rotate the needle 20-25 times clockwise at 40-50 times/min. Then, rotate the needle 20-25 times counterclockwise at the same speed. The operation should last 60-90 s.\n\t\tCAUTION: When massaging, the patient may have acid reflux, numbness, swelling, or pain. The practitioner should always ask how the patient feels; if they complain about an obvious pain or discomfort, the practitioner should reduce the strength of the massage or stop imminently.\nFix the needle with tape, and keep it at the acupoint. During the stagnation, press the tail of the needle with up and down floating pressure; the amplitude fluctuates at 1-2 cm, the frequency should range between 40-50 times/min, and each massage lasts 3 min. Perform two sessions per day for 2 weeks, once in the morning and once in the evening.\nChange the needles every 48 h.\nNeedle removal\n\t\nAfter performing the seven-step hand disinfection process, remove the tape. Use tweezers to separate the base of the needle from the skin gently. When it is completely peeled off from the area, use tweezers to pull it out gently.\nWhen the operation is done, use an iodophor cotton swab to disinfect the broken skin. Use a sterile cotton swab to press and achieve hemostasis if the broken skin is bleeding.\nAfter completing the operation, perform the seven-step hand-washing method again for disinfection.\nManagement of acupuncture complications\n\t\nIf the needle is broken and the end is still inside the skin, clamp it out with tweezers.",
    "If the broken end of the needle is flat or slightly depressed within the skin, use the thumb and index finger of the left hand to squeeze the skin vertically downward so that the broken needle will be exposed outside the body, and then remove the needle with tweezers.\nIf the broken needle is too deep, locate it under the X-ray, and remove it by surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: For needlestick injuries or fainting during acupuncture, please see another protocol32.\nIroning\n\t\nRefer to step 2.3.3 to disinfect the operation site, and make sure that the patient's urine is emptied before the operation.\nOperation sites include Qihai (CV29), Tianshu (ST25), and Changqiang (DU1)16,33 (see Figure 2).\nAccording to the characteristics of pain, crush the drug at a room temperature of 10-30 °C and a humidity of 40%-70% for 3 min using a pulverizer at a speed of 25,000-30,000 rpm. After pulverization, pack 130 g of the drug into a gauze bag, and soak in 10-30 °C water until it is fully saturated (about 60-80 s).\nPut the gauze bag in a microwave oven, and heat it for 2 min at 90-110 °C. After the temperature drops to 40-45 °C, wrap the medicated gauze bag firmly with a treatment towel.\nPlace both hands on both sides of the top of the gauze bag, straighten both elbows, lean forward slightly, and press down slowly with the help of part of the body weight. The skin of the abdomen should sink by about 3-5 cm, and on the Changqiang acupoint, 2-3 cm is enough. Hold for 3-5 s, let the heat slowly penetrate the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and then release slowly. Repeat the procedure 60 times.",
    "Massage with the ironing medicine bag clockwise 60 times and counterclockwise 60 times. Each spiral massage lasts 1-2 s; repeat the whole procedure three times.\n\t\tNOTE: For RN6 and ST25, the above methods can be applied with no differences. However, it is worth noting that DU1 is close to the anus, so excessive intensity of the operation may aggravate the patient's discomfort. Therefore, the operator can halve the massage time, and the temperature of the drug should be maintained at 35-40 °C. In order to protect patient privacy, operations can be carried out with clothing in DU1.\nAfter the operation is completed, cover the operation part, and keep it warm. Perform the procedure twice per day, once in the morning and once in the evening, and reuse the ironing medicine bag up to four times. The treatment lasts for 2 weeks.\nScald management\n\t\nFor the treatment of burns, prevention is more important than operation. Strictly follow the above protocol, and do not extend the operation time or increase the operation intensity without authorization.\nIf the burns occur that are limited below a deep partial degree burn, quickly rinse the scalded area with flowing cold water (5-15 °C is preferred) for 30 min. Then, disinfect the damaged spot with iodophor swabs, cover it with gauze, and fix it with medical tape. If the damaged area is large, use antibiotic ointment.\n\t\tNOTE: At the injury site, do not perform the treatment until the lesions have fully recovered. Puncturing of the blisters should not be done.\nIf the scald reaches a deep partial degree, please consult with the burn department immediately.\nSubscription Required.
