    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: MMS treatment, cell collection, and immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 8 h\nThe procedure for RNA immunoprecipitation is as previously described (Wang et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) with minor modifications. Also, to avoid protein degradation, the immunoprecipitation steps (steps 2–14) should be all performed at 4°C or on ice.\nTreat cells with 5 mM MMS at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: Prepare a media containing 5 mM MMS from a 100 mM stock described in above materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nNote: We use this dosage of MMS to generate a sufficient amount of methylated RNAs for detection. This dosage is not recommended to use for more than 2 h since it will cause cell death. Lower concentrations may be used if longer incubations are necessary, although this may compromise methylated RNA signal as such modified RNA may be degraded in the cell.\nHarvest cells as follows:\nRemove media from the dish.\nAdd 6 mL of cold 1× PBS, then use cell lifter to scrape cells and transfer them into a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 2 min to pellet cells.\nWash pellets once with 1 mL of cold 1× PBS then transfer cells into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 2 min to pellet cells again.\nPause point: Cell pellet can be store at −80°C for two months.\nCell lysis: Resuspend cell pellets with 2 volumes of Lysis Buffer, pipette up and down several times until the lysates become completely homogenous, and then incubate on ice for 5 min for cell lysis.\nNote: Usually, the pellet volume of 2× 107 HeLa-S3 cells is ∼200 μL. So, the cell pellet is lysed with 400 μL Lysis Buffer.\nPlace tubes at −80°C to shock-freeze for 30 min.",
    "Note: We do not recommend long-term storage of cell lysates at this point since this will potentially dissociate protein-RNA complexes.\nThaw cell lysates on ice and centrifuge 15,000 × g for 15 min.\nNote: cell lysates usually take ∼20–30 min to thaw completely.\nNote: Repeat if the lysates are cloudy.\nNote: The user can go to step 8 while waiting.\nTransfer supernatants to new 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nSave 5% of each clarified lysate as Input samples.\nNote: If a cell pellet is lysed with 400 μL Lysis Buffer, then total supernatant after centrifuge will be ∼420–450 μL. Then, use 400 μL of supernatant for immunoprecipitation and save 20 μL as Input.\nWhile cells are being centrifuged, prepare ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel as follows:\nCarefully mix the ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel until completely suspended. Immediately aliquot 40 μL of the suspension (20 μL of packed gel volume) into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube for each sample using a wide orifice pipette tip (or cut 1 mm off the end of a regular pipette tip).\nNote: Please refer to the manufacturer’s manual[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/288/183/a2220bul-ms.pdf] for more details of ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel.\nWash the resin by adding 500 μL of NT2 Buffer, mix by vortexing for ∼5–10 s or inverting tubes several times.\nNote: While the manufacturer suggests not using reducing agents in the buffer with the ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel, we have found that β-mercaptoethanol is needed to prevent oxidation of our protein of interest. We have not observed a significant reduction in the recovery of IP material with up to 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol.\nSpin down the resin at 700 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 8b and c for three total washes.",
    "Resuspend beads with NT2 Buffer (equal volume of the supernatant, e.g., 400 μL of NT2 Buffer for 400 μL of cell lysate).\nImmunoprecipitation: Add the supernatants from step 6 onto the M2 gel suspension and incubate at 4°C with rotation for 4 h.\nSpin down the resin at 700 × g for 1 min and remove supernatant.\nWash beads eight times with 1 mL of NT2 buffer as follows:\nAdd 1 mL NT2 Buffer to the resin. Vortex mix for ∼5–10 s or invert tubes several times.\nSpin down the resin at 700 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 11a and b for eight total washes.\nRemove the remaining liquid completely by using a P200 pipette tip.\nElution: Elute Flag-tagged proteins from the beads with 5 bead volumes of NT2 Buffer containing 400 μg/mL Flag peptide. Incubate at 4°C with rotation for 2 h.\nNote: For 20 μL of the packed gel, we use 100 μL NT2 Buffer containing 400 μg/mL Flag peptide for the elution.\nSpin down the resin at 700 × g for 1 min. Collect and transfer supernatants into new 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nWash beads with another 100 μL of NT2 Buffer, pipette several times, spin down the beads as above, then pool the supernatant with the eluate from above.\nNote: For 20 μL of beads, a total of 200 μL of eluate will be collected.\nStep 2: RNA extraction\nTiming: 2 h\nRNA extraction procedure is performed according to the manufacturer’s manual (Qiagen RNasey Mini Kit #217004). We recommend performing these steps with RNAse free consumables and in an area prepared for RNA work, it would guarantee a RNA extraction with higher quality.",
    "Add 800 μL TRIzol reagent to 200 μL of eluate from step 14. Invert tubes several times to mix completely. For input samples, add NT2 Buffer to 200 μL total volume then mix with 800 μL TRIzol reagent.\nPause point: TRIzol mixtures can be stored at −80°C for future use.\nFollow the manual[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=da6c8d17-58c4-411c-a334-bc1754876db3&lang=en] for RNA extraction procedure.\nCritical: We recommend using the protocol with DNase I treatment to remove any DNA contamination in the samples.\nElute RNAs with 30 μL of RNase-free water. For Input samples elute with 150 μL of water.\nPause point: RNA samples can be store at −80°C for future use.\nNote: For m1A detection, we recommend running the samples as soon as possible, as this modification may be converted to m6A through Dimroth rearrangement (Macon and Wolfenden 1968[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nStep 3: RNA digestion and dephosphorylation\nTiming: 3–25 h\nRNA is broken down to individual nucleosides by treating with S1 nuclease and alkaline phosphatase.\nPipette 25 μL of purified RNA from step 17 and add 10 units of S1 nuclease.\nDilute stock S1 nuclear 100 units/μL to 10 units/μL using RNase-free water.\nPipette 1 μL of diluted S1 nuclease into 25 μL of purified RNA.\nVortex and spin down using a microcentrifuge.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 2 h.\nNote: Step 18d may be left to incubate for 24 h.",
    "Note: One unit of S1 nuclease is defined as the amount of need to digest 1 μg of single-stranded nucleic acid to become soluble in perchloric acid per minute at pH 4.6 at 37°C. The RNA concentration of the input samples can be measured by UV spectrophotometry. If desired, the RIP sample RNA concentrations can be measured, but typically requires a high sensitivity method (e.g., Qubit). The amount of S1 nuclease used here is a significantly greater amount than what is necessary to complete digestion. Input RNA concentrations are typically 100–200 ng/μL. By digesting 25 μL, we are digesting 2.5–5.0 μg in total; therefore using 10 units of S1 nuclease for two hours is sufficient. Under the conditions described here, the typical ion intensity of a fully digested input sample is typically 5 × 104 to 1 × 105 for m1A.\nTreat with alkaline phosphatase as follows:\nPrepare alkaline phosphatase reagent (50 μL of total volume).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1531_9.csv\nNote: One unit of phosphatase is the amount of the enzyme required to dephosphorylate 5′-termini of 1 μg of linearized pUC57 DNA in 10 min at 37°C in FastAP buffer. The amount of phosphatase can be adjusted based on the unit definition.\nVortex and spin down briefly using a microcentrifuge to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nFilter digested samples with 0.22 μm filter into 11 mm vials. Cap vials and shake tube to move all of sample to the bottom of the vial. Ensure no bubbles are in the sample. Filter at least 150 μL of water into a vial for use as a blank.\nPrepare 10 nM of m1A, m3C and m7G standards, and filter 50 μL of each standard sample as above.\nStep 4: Nucleoside mass spectrometry",
    "Timing: Several hours (12 min/sample)\nCreate and run a worklist for the digested samples.\nOpen the MassHunter acquisition software to create a worklist for the run (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1531-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Creating an MS worklist and running samples (steps 22–24)\n(A) Create a worklist as follows: 1) Go to “Worklist”. 2) Click indicated icon to create a new worklist. 3) Edit “Sample Names”, “Sample Positions” (see (B) for the meaning of different combination of numbers and letters), and “Sample Types”. Click “Method” to load the method created above. Click “Data Files” to set the data saving location.\n(B and C) (B) Put sample vials into the rack with the corresponding positions as indicated. ‘P1’ refers to plate 1 samples, and the next letter and number indicate the position of the sample within the plate (C) Following (A), 4) click “On” to turn the machine on. 5) After all components become “Idle”, click the “Run” icon to run samples.\nType sample names for all the samples including water, nucleoside standards, Input and RIP samples.\nPut water sample at the beginning of the list as “Sample” for the purpose of clearing the system (see Note). Then use the same water sample as “Blank” following the first step.\nInclude script at the end of the program to put the machine on standby.",
    "Note: Water samples should be run at the beginning of every worklist to ensure the system is clear of remnants of any previous samples. Additionally, when first optimizing a method, it can be helpful to run a water sample between every sample to ensure the column is completely clear and no run-off is present that would skew the determined concentration of subsequent samples. If excessive run-off is observed in these water samples, it may be helpful to extend the run time of the solvent for each sample or change the elution methodology.\nLoad vials into the sample rack with the corresponding positions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nTurn on system and allow all the components to come to “Ready” or “Idle” status. Run the worklist (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nWhen the run has ended, open the Agilent Qualitative Navigator analysis software. Select the samples of interest to open the chromatograms (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1531-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Data analysis using the Agilent Qualitative Navigator analysis software (steps 25–27)\n(A) Select sample of interest to open.\n(B) Process the qualitative analysis as follows: 1) Go to “Method Editor”. Select 2) “Type” as “MRM” and 3) “Transition” as “All”. 4) “Add” this analysis method and select samples. 5) Click “Extract Additional Chromatograms” to obtain the results.\n(C) The chromatography results of different samples. Compare the peaks on the chromatograms of the samples to the peaks on the chromatograms of the standards (indicated by red lines). The numbers indicate the total ion intensity (integrated area under the curve).\nUnder Method Editor, select “MRM” for chromatogram with “All” the transitions, and add it to the method. Then press “Extract Additional Chromatograms” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). This function will integrate the area under the curve of each peak identified by the program.",
    "Compare the peaks on the chromatograms of the samples by retention time to the peaks on the standards’ chromatograms to determine which peak is representing the nucleoside of interest (see Note) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The integrated area under the curve can be compared to determine the amount of methylated nucleoside (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The amount of the RIP sample is then normalized with the amount of its counterpart Input samples.\nNote: Some mass transitions can be the same for different compounds, such as m6A and m1A, due to structural similarities. Therefore, it is important to compare the peak of the standard by retention time to the samples to determine which of multiple peaks represents the compound of interest (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1531-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The different retention times between m1A and m6A in mass spectrometry analysis\nNote that m1A elutes much earlier (< 1 min; middle row) relative to m6A (3.8 min; bottom row)."
