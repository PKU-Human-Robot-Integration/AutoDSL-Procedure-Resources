    "This protocol is optimized for human leprosy lesion tissue (4-5 mm punch biopsy) or mouse footpad tissue (∼20 to 40 mg) placed immediately upon collection into 1 ml of 70% ethanol and fixed for at least 24 hr. Tissues in 70% ethanol can be kept at room temperature (RT; 20°C to 22°C) during transport to the laboratory. However, we recommend using cold packs if tissues must be shipped to another site. Long-term storage should be at –20°C.\nTissue Homogenization\n1. Retrieve tubes containing tissue samples in 70% ethanol from –20°C and place them on ice.\n2. Centrifuge tubes at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C if the sample is in multiple small pieces.\n3. Pipette to remove ethanol.\n4. Add 1 ml nuclease-free water to each tube to rehydrate samples.\n5. Incubate at RT for 1 hr for human biopsy tissue or 15 min for mouse footpad tissue.\n6. Spin tubes at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n7. Pipette to remove the water and place each tissue sample in the lid of a 35 mm × 10 mm Petri dish. Use a pipette tip to aid in removing the tissue sample from the tube.\n8. Pipette 100 μl water onto the tissue and mince in with No. 10 scalpels for 1 min.\nIt is more comfortable to mince the tissue in the shallow lid rather than the bottom of the dish.\n9. Continue to mince with scissors for 3 min until fine. Tissue pieces should be <1 mm in size after mincing.\nUse a new scalpel and scissors for each sample.\n10. Transfer each tissue homogenate to a blue cap FastPrep tube using the scissors.\n11. Add 900 µl TRIzol to each tube for a total volume of 1 ml.",
    "12. Place tubes in the FastPrep FP-24 instrument and homogenize the tissue using a speed setting of 6.5 m/s for 45 s.\nThe FastPrep is used to efficiently homogenize the tissue and break open the cell wall of M. leprae, which increases the yield of nucleic acids.\n13. Allow the blue cap FastPrep tubes containing the homogenates to sit in the FastPrep FP-24 instrument for 5 min.\nHomogenization in the FastPrep FP-24 instrument generates heat, which may decrease the yield of nucleic acids, especially RNA. This 5 min incubation allows the homogenates to cool.\n14. Repeat step 12.\n15. Chill tubes on ice for 5 min.\nNever homogenize a third time, as this decreases the RNA yield.\nDNA and RNA Extraction\n16. Transfer the blue cap FastPrep tubes to a tube rack and add 200 µl chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (CIA) to each tube. Vortex for 10 s.\n17. Let tubes sit at RT for 3 min.\n18. Centrifuge the tubes at 700 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Remove the tubes from the centrifuge and place them on a rack.\n19. Transfer the contents of each tube (both the pink and clear layers) to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSome of the white matrix beads may also be pulled up during the transfer, which is acceptable.\n20. Centrifuge the tubes at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove the tubes from the centrifuge and place them on a rack.\nThe mixture should have separated into a pink, phenol-chloroform lower phase, a solid interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase. The RNA is in the colorless upper phase. The DNA is in the interphase.\n21. Transfer only 400 µl of the top colorless aqueous phase (RNA) to new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "It is crucial not to aspirate any of the interphase.\n22. Place the original tube, which contains the pink phenol-chloroform lower phase and solid interphase, on ice.\nThis tube contains the DNA needed for step 32 in DNA precipitation.\nRNA Precipitation\n23. Add 400 µl of CIA to the 400 µl aqueous phase (tubes from step 21) and vortex for 5 s to mix.\n24. Let tubes sit at RT for 3 min.\n25. Centrifuge tubes at 14,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\n26. Transfer 300 µl of each top aqueous phase to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n27. Add 2.0 µl GlycoBlue to each tube.\nGlycoBlue will enable visualization of the RNA pellet.\n28. Add 30 µl of 5M ammonium acetate to each tube.\n29. Precipitate the RNA by adding 332 µl of cold 100% Isopropanol to each tube. Vortex for 5 s to mix.\nIsopropanol is stored at –20°C.\n30. Incubate tubes at RT for 5 min.\n31. Incubate the tubes at –70°C overnight or until ready to complete precipitation.\nThis is a safe stopping point for RNA.\nDNA Precipitation\n32. Transfer the contents of each tube saved at step 22 (containing the interphase and phenol-chloroform phases) to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n33. Add 100 µl of 1× TE to each tube.\n34. Add 150 µl CIA to each tube.\n35. Place tubes in the FastPrep FP 24 instrument.\n36. Homogenize twice at a speed setting of 6.5 m/s for 45 s with 5 min rest in between each cycle.\n37. Centrifuge tubes at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n38. Transfer the aqueous phase (∼200 µl) to a new 1.5-ml tube.",
    "If there is not 200 µl of aqueous phase, add 200 µl of 1× TE directly into the tube, vortex, and centrifuge again at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n39. Add 1.5 µl GlycoBlue to each tube.\n40. Precipitate the DNA by adding 20 µl of 5M ammonium acetate followed by 400 µl of cold 100% ethanol to each tube. Vortex for 5 s to mix.\nEthanol is stored at –20°C.\n41. Store tubes at –70°C overnight or until ready to complete.\nThis is a safe stopping point for DNA.\nDNA Purification\n42. Thaw the tubes from step 41 on ice.\n43. Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nThe pellets will be blue.\n44. Remove the supernatant and wash the DNA pellet by resuspending in 1 ml cold 70% ethanol. Vortex for 5 s to mix.\n45. Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n46. Remove the supernatant, then air dry the pellet by inverting the tube on sterile gauze at RT for 30 min.\n47. Resuspend the DNA in 30 μl of sterile 1× TE by vortexing for 5 s.\n48. Spin at 10,000 × g for 30 s.\n49. Store purified DNA at –70°C until use.\nGenerally, ∼2 μg of total DNA (both host and M. leprae) per mg of sample are recovered. This is a safe stopping point for DNA.\nRNA Purification\n50. Thaw tubes from step 31 on ice.\n51. Centrifuge tubes at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nIf there is no visible blue pellet after this spin, add another 2 µl of GlycoBlue and repeat the 30 min centrifugation.\n52. Pipette off the supernatant from each tube without disturbing the pellet.",
    "53. Wash the pellets by adding 1 ml cold 75% ethanol. Vortex each tube briefly for 2 s.\n54. Centrifuge tubes at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n55. Let the tubes sit at RT for 5 min.\n56. Centrifuge again at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n57. Carefully remove the supernatant from each tube without disturbing the pellet.\nThe pellets will be blue.\n58. Repeat steps 53-57 once more.\nAfter pipetting off the initial 1 ml of ethanol, use a 20-µl pipette to carefully pipette off as much of the residual ethanol that may remain.\n59. Invert the tubes on sterile gauze and let air dry for 10 min ONLY.\nDo not over-dry the pellet. If the pellet dries too long, the RNA will not solubilize properly.\n60. Resuspend each RNA pellet in 25 µl of nuclease-free water at RT. Vortex for 5 s.\n61. Spin at 10,000 × g for 30 s.\n62. Place tubes in a 55°C heat block for 15 min.\nHeating ensures that the RNA is completely solubilized.\n63. Remove tubes from heat block and place on ice.\nDNase treatment\n64. Add 17 µl nuclease-free water from the Turbo DNase Kit to a PCR reaction tube, one for each RNA sample.\n65. Add 5 µl Turbo DNase 10× buffer to each tube.\n66. Add 25 µl purified RNA from step 63 to each tube.\n67. Add 1.5 µl Turbo DNase to each tube. Vortex for 5 s and spin for 30 s at 10,000 × g.\n68. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C in a thermocycler.\n69. Add 1.5 µl Turbo DNase to each tube. Vortex for 5 s and spin for 30 s at 10,000 × g.\n70. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C in a thermocycler.\nDNase Inactivation",
    "71. Remove the PCR tubes from the thermocycler.\n72. Add 10 µl DNase Inactivation Reagent to each tube.\n73. Set a timer for 5 min. Vortex each tube individually for 10 s. Once each tube has been vortexed for 10 s, start back at the first tube and repeat the 10 s vortex for each tube until the 5 min is over.\nThe tubes must be constantly agitated during this step.\n74. Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 × g for 2 min at RT.\nUse PCR tube adapters to place the PCR tubes in the centrifuge or transfer the contents of each PCR tube into a new microcentrifuge tube before centrifuging.\n75. Transfer 45 µl of each supernatant to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.\nAvoid the “pellet” at the bottom.\n76. Keep the DNase-treated RNA on ice or store at 4°C while setting up the reverse transcription reaction.\nApproximately 2 μg of total RNA (both host and M. leprae) per mg sample are usually obtained.",
    "This protocol describes how to set up and run RLEP qPCR to quantify the number of M. leprae in each sample.

    "This protocol describes how to set up and run a qPCR assay to determine the viability of M. leprae in a sample by measuring the expression of hsp18, which encodes the 18 kD heat shock protein, and esxA, which encodes the ESAT-6 protein transcripts.
