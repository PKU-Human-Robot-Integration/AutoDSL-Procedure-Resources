    "All procedures described below have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at Northwestern University and have been performed under sterilized conditions.\n1. Modification of GL261 cells with Firefly Luciferase Expressing Reporter\nNOTE: HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors express firefly luciferase (Fluc) under the control of the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter. The optical reporter gene has been cloned into the vector plasmid pHRSIN-CSGW-dlNotI.\nMaintain 293-T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and GL261 cells in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2).\nWhen the 293-T cell culture reaches 80% confluency in a T-75 flask, wash the cells once with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+, incubate the cells with 3 ml of trypsin (0.05%) at 37 °C for 5 min, triturate with a 5 ml pipette by holding the flask slightly slanted and collect all the cells from the bottom of flask. Transfer the 3 ml of trypsinized cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube, and add 7 ml of flesh RPMI medium (a total of 10 ml of the cell suspension).\nMix the cell suspension well with a 5 ml pipette. Take 100 μl of the cell suspension from the tube and count the number of the cells using hemocytometer. To do so, mix 100 μl of the cell suspension with 300 μl of trypan blue solution and insert 2 μl of the mixture into a hemocytometer. Count the number of the cells without blue staining from four separate views under a microscope. Average the cell number from each view, as this number represent 104 cells/ml.",
    "Meanwhile, centrifuge the tube containing the cell suspension at 300 x g for 7 min. Aspirate the media and resuspend the cell pellets with fresh RPMI medium to make a GL261 cell suspension at density of 1.0 x 106/ml. Seed 2.5 x 106 GL261 cells with 2.5 ml of RPMI media into a T-175 flask with 27.5 ml DMEM (day 1).\nAfter 24 hr, replace the medium with 20 ml fresh DMEM (day 2).\nTo produce the lentiviral vector, mix 54 μl transfection reagent with 2 ml serum free DMEM for 5 min. Add 3 μg of gag-pol, 3 μg of vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope (VSV-G), and 4.5 μg of Fluc (pSIN-Fluc) into the DMEM with transfection reagent, and incubate for 20 min at RT. Drop the entire DNA mixture into 293-T flask (T-175) and incubate at 37°C in a humidified chamber containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 48 hr (day 2).\nAdd 10 ml of fresh DMEM at 24 hr after transfection (total volume of 293-T cell culture medium should be approximately 30 ml) (day 3).\nTo split GL261 cells into a 24-well plate, wash the cells once with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, incubate the cells with 5 ml of trypsin (0.05%) at 37 °C for 5 min, triturate with a 5 ml pipette by holding the flask slightly slanted, collect all the cells from the bottom of flask, and count cells via hemocytometer as in step 1.2. Meanwhile, centrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 7 min. Aspirate the media and resuspend the cell pellets with fresh RPMI medium to make a GL261 cell suspension at density of 2.5 x 104/ml. Seed 2.5 x 104 GL261 cells with 1 ml of RPMI media in a 24-well plate (day 3).",
    "Collect 30 ml of the lentiviral supernatant with 10 ml pipette from the 293-T flask (T-175) at 48 hr following transfection and transfer the supernatant into 50 ml conical tube. Aspirate the 30 ml lentiviral supernatant via a 50 ml syringe, through a 0.22 μm syringe filter, and aliquot the viral supernatant into 1 ml aliquots (day 4).\nReplace the 1 ml of RPMI medium in GL261 cell plate (24-well) with 1 ml of the lentiviral supernatant and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified chamber (day 4).\nAfter 48 hr of lentiviral infection, replace the medium with 1 ml of fresh RPMI (day 6).\nAfter 24 hr, repeat the lentiviral infection of the GL261 cells (day 7).\nAfter the 2nd 48 hr of lentiviral infection, replace the medium with 1 ml of fresh RPMI (day 9).\nContinue to grow the luciferase modified GL261 cells (to be referred to as GL261.luc cells) and expand the cell culture to a T-75 flask.\nWhen the GL261.luc cell culture reaches 70% confluency in a T-75 flask, harvest the cells by trypsinization and count by hemocytometer as in step 1.2. Plate the GL261.luc cell into a 24-well plate at graduating densities (1.0 x 106, 5.0 x 105, 2.5 x 105, 1.0 x 105, 5.0 x 104, 2.5 x 104 cells/well) and incubate at 37°C in a humidified chamber containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3 hr.\nMeasure cellular luciferase activity relative to luciferase modified U-87 MG (U87.luc) cells using bioluminescence imaging (Figure 1).\n\t\nStart the image software (click icon on the desktop) and initialize the imaging system (click \"Initialize\" button). Initialization will begin automatically and may take several min for the system check-up and the camera to cool down to -90 °C.",
    "Add 25 μl of luciferin (D-Luciferin potassium salt, 150 mg/kg) into each well.\nIncubate the cells with luciferin for 1 min at RT and image the plate for 10 sec. To set up the imaging system, select \"Luminescent\", \"10 sec\" exposure time, and \"Medium\" binning. Place the 24-well plate on the imaging station and click the \"Acquire\" button to start image.\nAfter the image is successfully acquired, you will see an image window and tool palette on the screen. Click \"ROI (regions of interest) Tools\" and select 6 x 4 from the slit icon. Create 6 x 4 slits to cover the area of signal on the image of the 24-well plate and click the measurements tab (pencil icon). Observe a window with a table of ROI measurements as unit of photons per second per steradian per square cm (photons/sec/sr/cm2).\nUse U87.luc cells, previously modified with the same lentivirus used here for GL261 modification11, as a control for assessing luciferase activity in transduced GL261.luc cells.\n2. In Vitro Proliferation Assay\nWhen the GL261 and GL261.luc cell cultures reach 70% confluency in a T-75 flask, harvest the both cell lines by trypsinization and count as in step 1.2, and plate cells into a 96-well plate at a density of 1500 cells in 80 μl of RPMI medium per well using a multichannel pipette to minimize time and pipetting error. Seed each cell line into 20 wells total. To limit the evaporation in the wells populated by cells, fill empty wells with 100 μl of fresh RPMI medium.\nAssess the cellular proliferation using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. Here we use the MTS cell proliferation assay. Using a multi-channel pipette, add 20 μl of MTS reagent into each well of the 96-well plate that contains cells.",
    "Incubate the plate at 37°C in a humidified chamber containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3 hr. Measure absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader. This is repeated at days 1, 2, 4, and 7, after plating. To normalize absorbance values, the values of each day are divided by the corresponding readings obtained at day 1 (Figure 2).\n3. Tumor Cell Implantation\nNote: Autoclave all equipment. Prepare surgical area by spraying a disinfectant (2% chlorhexidine solution) and cover with absorbent drapes. In order to maintain sterile conditions, wear sterile surgical gloves during surgery, and divide the surgical area into two areas by color tape. Area 1 is labeled \"Clean\" and contains sterilized supplies; Area 2 is labeled \"Dirty\" and contains used materials.\nPrior to animal surgery, prepare a cell suspension for intracranial injection. Harvest cells from a 70% confluent T-75 flask by trypsinization and count cells via hemocytometer as in step 1.2, and make a cell suspension at a density of 1.0 x 105 cells/µl in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS).\nAnesthetize mice with intraperitoneal injection of 200 μl mixture containing 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine in 0.9% saline. To confirm proper anesthetization, pinch the toe of the mouse. If the mouse is completely under anesthesia, the mouse should not respond to the stimulus.\nAdminister 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine via subcutaneous injection to relieve the post-operative pain.\nShave the top of the head of the animals using clippers and clean with a cotton-tip applicator dipped in 2% chlorhexidine solution. Apply eye ointment to maintain adequate lubrication during the surgery.",
    "Make a sagittal incision approximately 1 cm long over the parieto-occipital bone using a sterile scalpel. To visualize the bregma, wipe the surface of the skull with a cotton-tip applicator soaked in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution.\nDrill the skull with a sterile 25-G needle to make a small hole 3 mm to the right of the bregma and just behind the coronal suture.\nTo ensure that intracranial injection site is to a depth of 3 mm from the skull, cut 3 mm off the pointed end of a 20 μl pipette tip using scissors and insert a syringe into the pipette tip.\nInsert the syringe perpendicularly to the hole previously created, and slowly inject the tumor cell suspension containing 3.0 x 105 cells in 3 µl HBSS, over a 1 min period. Leave the needle in place for another minute, and then slowly pull out the needle.\nSwab the skull with cotton-tip applicator dipped in 3% hydrogen peroxide and the 2% chlorhexidine solution. Dry the surface of skull with the cotton-tip applicator. Cut out the sterile bone wax approximately 3mm3 in size and attach the bone wax on the end side of the cotton-tip applicator. Apply the bone wax to cover the hole with the cotton-tip applicator.\nDraw the each side of the scalp together over the skull using forceps, and staple to close the wound. Clean the wound with a cotton-tip dipped in 2% chlorhexidine solution.\nMonitor all mice post-operatively until they become ambulant and retain normal activity. Typically, recovery time is approximately 30 min. Do not return the mice to the cage with other animals until they have fully recovered from anesthesia.\n4. Bioluminescence Imaging of GL261 Tumor Growth",
    "Spray a generous amount of disinfectant (0.05% dimethyl ammonium chloride solution) on a clean paper towel. Use the disinfectant-soaked paper towel to thoroughly wipe the black sheet, nose cones and divider inside the imaging chamber where the animals will be in contact with the device. Thoroughly wipe all surfaces with a clean, dry paper towel. Repeat this once more and wait 5 min.\nInitialize the imaging station as in step 1.14.1.\nAnesthetize the mouse with a 300 μl mixture containing 200 μl of Ketamine/Xylazine and 100 μl of luciferin (D-Luciferin potassium salt, 150 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nWait 10 min after injection and confirm if the mice are completely under anesthesia by pinching the tail. To set up the imaging system, select \"Luminescent\", \"Auto\" exposure time, and \"Medium\" binning. Place the mice on the imaging station and click the \"Acquire\" button to start image. Ensure that the time after injection is consistent with each imaging session.\nAfter the image is successfully acquired, an image window and tool palette should appear. Click \"ROI Tools\" and select \"auto\" from the circle icon. To define ROIs, encircle the area of signal on the image, and then take measurements of the ROI as unit of photons/sec/sr/cm2.\nTake the mice out of the imaging chamber and monitor the mice until they become ambulant and retain normal activity. Typically recovery time is approximately 15 min. Do not return the mice to the cage with other animals until they have fully recovered from anesthesia.",
    "Monitor tumor growth by bioluminescence imaging twice a week until animals present the following symptoms: weight loss (loss of more than 20% relative to the weight prior to implantation), inappetance (complete anorexia for 24 hr), and lack of sustained purposeful response to gentle stimuli (weak attempt to get up), at which time they should be euthanized. Euthanize animals with these symptoms using a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation.\n\t\nPlace mice into the euthanasia chamber (do not overcrowded the chamber) and inflow compressed CO2 for 5-6 min. Observe that all animals are unconsciousness and not breathing after approximately 5 min.\nTake the mice out of the chamber. Ensure that the heart is not beating by feeling the chest between your thumb and forefinger and check that there is no blink reflex.\nRestrain the mouse in a prone position on a flat surface and grasp the back of the neck at the base of skull with one hand and base of the tail with your thumb and first finger of the other hand.\nRestrain the head and quickly pull the tail backward. Ensure that skull is separated from the first cervical vertebra using your thumb and first finger.\nNormalize luminescence values for each day against corresponding readings obtained at the first day of bioluminescence imaging as in step 2.3 (Figure 3A).\nFor statistical analysis, generate survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier estimator12 and compare the differences between survival curves using a log-rank test13."
