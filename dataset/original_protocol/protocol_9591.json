    "The human umbilical cord was obtained from Beijing Tsinghua Changgeng Hospital. All procedures and protocols regarding the acquisition, isolation, and culture of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) were conducted with informed consent and with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tsinghua Changgeng Hospital (filing number 22035-4-02), and the procedures and protocols complied with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n1. Monolayer culture of hMSCs, HEK293T cells, and Vero cells\nIsolate primary human UCMSCs from Wharton's jelly according to the reported method21. Use serum-free (SF) hMSC culture medium for the isolation and outgrowth of primary UCMSCs, harvest the cells on passage 2, and cryopreserve as a master cell bank (MCB).\nInoculate 6 x 105 human UCMSCs (preferably passage 2 or passage 3 cells) in one T75 flask (i.e., the seeding density on 2D planar vessels is 8,000 cells/cm2) for monolayer culture with 15 mL of complete SF hMSC culture medium. Ensure uniform seeding through a figure-eight movement of the flask. Culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator to 80%-90% confluency.\nTo harvest, decant the cell culture medium, and rinse the cells with 3-5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Then, add 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, and incubate at 37 °C for 1-2 min until most cells have become round and have detached from the flask, as observed under a bright-field inverted microscope with a 4x objective. Add 3 mL of SF hMSC culture medium to terminate digestion.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 179 x g for 5 min. Decant the supernatant, rinse the cell pellet with PBS twice, and resuspend in around 3-5 mL of SF hMSC culture medium for seeding to microcarriers in bioreactors.",
    "​NOTE: Check the cell viability, and make sure the cells are >90% viable. Only prepare the cells after all the preparation work for the bioreactors has been completed (steps 2.1-3.6).\nFor the monolayer culture of HEK293T cells and Vero cells, inoculate at 2 x 106-3 x 106 cells into each T75 flask, and culture with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% newborn calf serum (NBS), respectively.\nFollow steps 1.3-1.4 for harvesting the cells. Resuspend in 3-5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS.\n2. Preparation of the stirred-tank bioreactor before cell seeding\nOn day −1, rinse the glass vessel thoroughly with running deionized (DI) water once.\nDisassemble all the stainless tubes and impellers from the headplate, immerse them in DI water, and sonicate with an ultrasonic cleaner at 40 kHz and 60 °C for 1 h to clean thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: The preparations and procedures will be the same for first-tier expansion in the 5 L bioreactor and the second-tier expansion in the 15 L bioreactor. The parameters for the 15 L bioreactor are given in brackets throughout. If no parameters are given in brackets, these parameters are the same for the 5 L and 15 L bioreactors.\nCarefully check all the O-rings are intact and in place, and then install the disassembled parts back onto the headplate according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: Replace any worn or torn O-rings before assembly if necessary. Worn O-rings will compromise the airtightness and, hence, the sterility of the vessel.",
    "Add 7 L (18 L for the 15 L bioreactor) of 0.5 M NaOH solution into the 5 L vessel, and place the headplate with the tubes assembled on the rim of the vessel to immerse the tubes in the NaOH solution. Let it stand for 12 h or overnight to remove endotoxins from the tubes and glass vessel.\n\tNOTE: Do not exceed 7 L (18 L) as this is the maximum volume of the 5 L (15 L) glass vessel. Wear proper personal protective equipment when handling the NaOH solution, as it is corrosive.\nRemove the headplate and decant the NaOH solution into a proper waste bottle. Discard according to lab safety regulations. Rinse the vessel, the headplate, and its parts thoroughly with endotoxin-free DI water or water for injection to remove residual alkaline.\nAdd 2 L (5 L) of PBS to the vessel, reassemble all the parts, and bolt the headplate to the metal frame of the vessel according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nFit a Closed System Consumable Pack to the appropriate stainless steel (SS) parts/tubes/ports on the headplate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clamp all the Robert clamps on the tubes, and reinforcing by clamping with hemostats is recommended. Leave one of the tubes, with an 0.22 μm air vent filter at the end that is connected to the condenser, unclamped.\n\tNOTE: Slip the silicone tubes onto the tips onto the hemostats to prevent piercing the silicone tubes. Clamp only on the silicone tubes, and avoid clamping the C-flex tubes included in this kit. Leaving one tube on the condenser unclamped will allow for pressure relief during autoclaving.",
    "Prepare 250 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution in an autoclavable 500 mL GL 45 glass bottle, and fit with a GL 45 Multiport Connector Screw Cap with two ports. Connect a 180 mm long, 0.13 in x 0.25 in (internal diameter x outer diameter) silicone tube onto one of the ports on the lower side of the cap; the length should be long enough to just touch the bottom of the bottle.\nConnect another piece of silicone tube, with a length 500 mm longer than the previous one, to the same port on the upper side of the cap, and connect the other end to a drip feed port on the 5 L vessel headplate. Connect a 0.22 μm air vent filter to the other port on the screw cap.\nPerform a two-point calibration on the pH probe as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then, insert the pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and live cell count probes into the vessel in the appropriate PG13,5 ports, and screw tight onto the headplate.\nPerform an airtightness check of the fully assembled vessel according to the manufacturer's instructions. Maintain a pressure of 0.4 bar ± 0.01 bar for at least 30 min. Slowly release the pressure after the system passes the test. If the airtightness test fails, carefully search for leak points, and reinforce the vessel assembly.\nAutoclave the fully assembled vessel with the consumable kit at 15 psi and 121 °C for 60 min. Following autoclaving, check all the air vent filters to make sure they are intact and dry. Remove all the hemostats.\n\tNOTE: A wet air vent filter will not filter the gas efficiently and might compromise the sterility of the vessel during cell culture. Change the air vent filters if they are wet, and autoclave the entire vessel again.",
    "Transfer the autoclaved vessel into a cleanroom, and wait for it to completely cool to room temperature. Insert the temperature probe into the thermowell tube, and connect the cables for the motor, pH probe, and DO probe from the controller to the respective parts on the vessel. Wrap the heat mat around the vessel tightly.\nUnclamp the Robert clamps on the flexible tubes on the exhaust gas condenser, ring sparger, drip feed port for NaOH, and air overlay port. Turn on the controller, log in, and enter the parameters listed in Table 1 into the system according to the manufacturer's instructions. These tubes should not be clamped at any time during the culture process.\nClick on Start, and name the experiment to start the bioreactor. Allow the bioreactor to run on these settings for at least 12 h, or overnight, to saturate the PBS with oxygen in order to perform a one-point calibration for the DO probe later.\nCalibrate the liquid handling volume speed of pump 1 and pump 2 on the bioreactor controller. Install a 0.13 in x 0.25 in silicone tube on each pump separately, with one end dipping into a bottle of water and the other end of the tube inserted into a measuring cylinder.\nSet the pump rotation speed to 300 rpm, and time for 1 min. Note the amount of water dispensed into the measuring cylinder for both pumps. These numbers will be needed for the subsequent steps.\nPrepare 500 mL of SF hMSC culture medium as per the manufacturer's instructions, and replace the cap of the cell culture medium bottle with a disposable C-Flex EZ Top container closure and compatible cap. Carry out the cap replacement inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC).",
    "Weld the outlet tube on the bottle of medium to the inlet C-flex tube on the bottle of 10 g of pre-sterilized W01 microcarriers for MSC. Install a section of the tube onto pump 1 of the bioreactor controller, set the pump rotation to 300 rpm, and pump in all the culture medium from the bottle into the bottle of microcarriers. Store these microcarriers at 4 °C until use on day 0.\n\t​NOTE: The microcarriers should be prepared on day −1. For 15 L bioreactor culture, prepare four bottles (i.e., 40 g, with 4 x 500 mL of SF medium) in total.\n3. Cell seeding, culture, and harvest in a 5 L stirred-tank bioreactor\nOn day 0, perform a one-point calibration, specifically 100%, for the DO probe on the bioreactor controller as per the manufacturer's instructions. The stirred-tank bioreactor is now ready for cell culture.\nPrepare a 2 L (5 L) glass bottle for waste collection, fit it with a GL 45 Multiport Connector Screw Cap with two ports, with 30 mm, 0.25 in x 0.44 in C-Flex tubes connected to both ports, and autoclave to sterilize. Weld the C-flex tube from one of the ports from the waste bottle to the harvest tube on the headplate of the bioreactor vessel with a tube welder.\nStop the temperature, pH, and DO control on the bioreactor controller temporarily, install the silicone tube attached to the harvest tube onto peristaltic pump 2 in the correct liquid flow direction, and fully dispense all the PBS from the vessel into the waste bottle. Dislodge the tube from pump, and seal and disconnect the waste bottle.",
    "NOTE: Always unclamp any Robert clamps on the flexible tubes involved in liquid flow in each step. Clamp back after the liquid transfer is completed before sealing and disconnecting. Clamp nearer toward the headplate side. Unclamping and clamping should be performed for all the subsequent steps unless otherwise stated.\nPrepare 7 L (30 L) of complete SF hMSC medium, and replace each original bottle cap with a disposable C-Flex EZ Top container closure and compatible cap. Weld a Single-Use Filtration Module to one of the ports on the 10 L (50 L) Single-Use Storage Bag. Perform the operation of replacing the caps inside a BSC.\nFilter and transfer the culture medium to the storage bag, one bottle at a time, by welding the bottles of cell culture medium to the other end of the capsule filter and using the pump on the bioreactor controller. Designate as the feed bag.\nWeld one outlet port from the feed bag to the C-flex tube on the feed tube of the headplate, and install the tube to pump 1 on the bioreactor controller. Weld the other outlet port from the feed bag to the bleed tube, and install the tube to pump 2 on the bioreactor controller in the correct direction of liquid flow.\n\tNOTE: Install the section on the fluid flow line, which is made of silicone tubing, on the pump for better resistance to wear and tear as compared to C-Flex tubes. Ensure the tubes are installed in the correct direction.",
    "Set the pump 1 speed to 300 rpm, and stop the pump after dispensing 1 L (5 L) of medium from the feed bag into the vessel, based on the volume dispensing speed noted in step 2.17. Start the temperature, pH, and DO control again, with the same settings as described in step 2.14.\nSeal and disconnect the tube connecting the feed bag to the feed tube on the headplate. Weld the C-Flex tube from the bottle of the dispersed microcarriers prepared in step 2.18 to the feed tube, and pump all the content from the bottle into the vessel. Seal and disconnect the empty bottle of microcarrier suspension. Disinfect the entire surface of the bottle with 75% ethanol, and place in a BSC to use as a cell suspension transfer bottle.\n\tNOTE: Leave a longer piece of C-Flex tube on the headplate side when sealing and disconnecting the disposable accessories, as multiple welding and disconnecting steps will be performed on the same tube in the following steps.\nEnsure that the temperature shown on the controller reaches a steady state of 37 °C, which usually takes about 30 min, before proceeding to prepare the seed cells as in steps 1.3-1.4. Resuspend 2.5 x 108 hMSCs in 500 mL of SF medium, and transfer to the empty bottle previously containing the microcarrier suspension.\n\tNOTE: The seed cells for the 15 L bioreactor expansion should be prepared according to step 3.21, with the aim of inoculating 1.0 x 109 cells in 500 mL.",
    "Weld the C-Flex tube from the bottle now containing the cell suspension to the feed port on the headplate, and pump all of the contents from the bottle into the vessel to initiate cell inoculation to the microcarriers. Seal and disconnect the empty bottle. Re-weld the feed port from the feed bag to the feed tube on the headplate.\nAdjust the agitation settings on the controller to allow intermittent agitation for enhanced inoculation efficiency of hMSCs by setting the following parameters: V1 = 35 (30) rpm/5 min; V2 = 0 rpm/25 min; number of cycles = 12 (24); final agitation speed = 35 (30) rpm.\n\tNOTE: The agitation speed may be adjusted to 40 (35) rpm or 45 (40) rpm if non-uniform distribution or sedimentation of the microcarriers are observed during the culture process.\nSet up an automated medium supplement and exchange regime on the bioreactor controller in the Medium Exchange interface. Set the parameters for the hMSC cultivation as stated in Table 2.\n\tNOTE: Unclamp any Robert clamps on the flexible tubes involved in liquid flow at this stage, especially for the feed and bleed tube. Keep these unclamped through the entire culture process.\nTake the samples through the sampling tube by connecting the disposable sampling bags via Luer connectors at the desired time points, usually once every day, and aliquoting 10 mL each time into the sampling bag. Aliquot 2-3 mL of sample into the first sampling bag, discard, and then aliquot the actual 10 mL of sample into a new sampling bag each time.",
    "NOTE: The initial 2-3 mL sample could be liquid left in the tube from the previous sampling time point and may not accurately represent the condition in the vessel. Always perform these steps with extra aseptic measures by sanitizing the Luer connectors before and after making or breaking connections with 75% ethanol.\nTransfer the samples taken to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Perform the following tests on the samples.\n\t\nTake 200 μL of the cell-laden microcarrier suspension, and stain with Calcein-AM/PI Cell Double Staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. Observe under a fluorescence microscope.\nSediment the microcarriers by gravitation, which usually takes 5-10 min. Aspirate the supernatant, and test the glucose concentration with a glucose meter as per the manufacturer's instructions. Plot a glucose level graph.\nIncubate the sedimented cell-laden microcarriers with a freshly prepared 3-5 mL of 1 mg/mL digest solution at 37 °C for 20-30 min to fully dissolve the microcarriers. Count the cells after staining with AO/PI with an automated fluorescence cell analyzer. Plot a cell growth curve. Correlate with the real-time live cell growth curve generated on the controller.\nOn day 4 or day 5 of culture, prepare 50 mL (200 mL) of digest solution at 30 mg/mL. The working mass ratio between the digest solution and dissolvable microcarriers ranges from 3:20 to 5:20. Sterile-filter with a 0.22 μm capsule filter, and further dilute in 500 mL (2 L) of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with calcium and magnesium. Transfer to a 3 L disposable storage bag.",
    "​NOTE: Only prepare the digest solution just before cell harvesting. Try to aim for at least 1.0 x 109-1.2 x 109 cells for the first-tier expansion and 1.0 x 1010 cells for the second-tier expansion. If the cells grow faster, harvest at day 4; if not, harvest at day 5. It is not advised to go beyond day 5.\nSet agitation speed to 0 on the controller for the microcarriers to settle, which usually happens within 20 min. Turn off the automated medium exchange protocol, and stop the temperature, pH, and DO control on the bioreactor controller. Manually start pump 2 at 300 rpm on the controller, and dispense supernatant into the feed regime to leave about 1 L (2 L) of culture suspension in the vessel (using the volume dispensing speed noted in step 2.17 or gauging from the graduation marks on the body of the vessel). Seal and totally disconnect the feed bag.\nWeld the bag of freshly prepared digest solution from step 3.15 to the feed tube, and pump all the contents into the vessel. Start the agitation speed at 45 (40) rpm. Ensure that the temperature control is still maintaining the temperature at 37 °C. Microcarriers will dissolve within 40-60 min. Take 1 mL of the sample with a sterile Luer lock syringe at 30 min and subsequently every 5-10 min to observe under a bright-field microscope to check the dissolution of the microcarriers.",
    "After the microcarriers have dissolved, weld one 3 L storage bag (two 3 L storage bags for the 15 L bioreactor) to the harvest tube, and pump out the cell suspension completely using pump 2 at 300 rpm. Prepare 1 L (3.5 L) of saline containing 1% human serum albumin (HSA) as a wash buffer and 500 mL of complete SF medium (500 mL of cell cryopreservation buffer, a formulation of 10% dimethyl sulfate (DMSO) and 90% SF medium is taken as an example) in separate disposable storage bags using the methods and accessories mentioned in previous steps for other liquid transfers.\nTurn on the cell processing system, install a Disposable Cell Processing Kit to the instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions, weld the bags of cell suspension, wash buffer, and SF medium (cryopreservation buffer) to the Disposable Cell Processing Kit, and carefully follow all the instructions displayed on the user interface to initialize and check the integrity and proper installation of the kit.\nOnce the installation is complete, enter the parameters listed in Table 3 for cell washing with wash buffer and resuspension in SF medium (cryopreservation buffer) to the software to start the wash and resuspension process. The whole procedure will be performed automatically with several manual check points.\nTake a sample of the cells from the centrifuge chamber, as indicated by the cell processing system, and calculate the cell density with an automated cell analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adjust the resuspension volume for a density of 2 x 106 cells/mL or a maximum total volume of 250 mL.",
    "Seal and disconnect the cell transfer bag from the Disposable Cell Processing Kit after the system has aspirated the cells out from the chamber. Readjust the cell density to 2 x 106 cells/mL with complete SF medium in a larger cell transfer bag/medium storage bag if necessary. These will be the seed cells for the second-tier expansion in the 15 L bioreactor.\n4. Cell formulation, fill, and finish\nStart preparing the 15 L bioreactor 1 day before cell harvest from the 5 L bioreactor. Follow the steps in protocol section 2 and 3 completely except with the parameters for 15 L indicated in brackets.\nResuspend the cells in 250 mL of cryopreservation buffer, and seal and disconnect the cell transfer bag from the Disposable Cell Processing Kit after the system has aspirated the cells out from the chamber.\nTransfer 2,000 mL of cryopreservation buffer together with the 250 mL of resuspended cells from step 4.2 to a 3 L cell transfer bag. Weld this transfer bag to a Disposable Fill&Finish Consumable Kit. \n\tNOTE: The additional volume of cryopreservation buffer used here should be determined by the specification of formulation and total cell number calculation as per the counting results gained in step 3.21\nAssemble the Disposable Fill&Finish Consumable Kit to the cell filling system, and turn on the pre-cooling system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Follow the instructions on the system, and set to fill 20 mL/bag with a total of 20 bags per batch. Seal and disconnect these bags from the kit, and follow standard cryopreservation procedures. Use cryostorage bags.\nWeld a new set of 20 cryopreservation bags to the Disposable Fill&Finish Consumable Kit, and repeat the fill and finish procedure until all the cells are aliquoted. Follow standard procedures to cryopreserve these cells.",
    "5. Characterization of the cell quality\nSample the harvested hMSCs from the dissolvable microcarriers, and use a cell processing system for characterization by flow cytometry for the determination of the cell identity following the methods described in literature18.\nThaw the cryopreserved cells, and replate on conventional 2D flasks or microplates for further characterization of the cell features, including the cell morphology and tri-lineage differentiation capability, following methods described in literature18.\n6. HEK293T expansion on G02 microcarriers in the stirred-tank bioreactor\nPrepare a 5 L bioreactor as mentioned in step 2. For HEK293T cells, culture the cells with sterile G02 microcarriers instead of W01. The culture process is similar to in protocol section 3, although some parameters are different, as will be detailed in the following steps. Install a special perfusion tube in the bioreactor in replacement of the bleed tube, as perfusion is needed for the culture of HEK293T cells.\nDifferent from the protocol detailed in protocol section 3, prepare 20 g of G02 microcarriers (i.e., two bottles) in DMEM with 10% FBS for the 5 L bioreactor, with the day 0 culture volume set at 3.5 L (i.e., a final concentration of about 5.71 g/L). Dispense 2 L of medium into the vessel before the two bottles of G02 microcarriers, and inoculate 500 mL of 1.75 x 109 HEK293T cells (i.e., at a final density of 5 x 105 cells/mL).\nPerform an agitation regime and medium exchange regime (based on the amount of medium required to be exchanged per day, expressed as culture volume per day, CVD), which is different from protocol section 3 and is detailed in Table 4.",
    "NOTE: Activate pump 1 and pump 2 manually so that both can pump continuously for perfusion to occur. Adjust the pump speed every day to meet the perfusion rate based on the calibration of the pumps' volume dispensing speed. Usually, this will be in the single digit range. For HEK293T cells, use fresh medium as feed, and discard spent medium totally into a waste bottle, unlike with hMSCs, for which the medium is circulated.\nFor the second tier expansion to the 15 L bioreactor, use bead-to-bead transfer of the HEK293T cells instead of full dissolution of the microcarriers as used with hMSCs. Specifically, stop the agitation to sediment the microcarriers after desired cell density is reached, and then aspirate as much supernatant as possible out of the perfusion tube, feed PBS with 3 times the volume of remaining suspension in to wash the microcarriers, and repeat three times. Aspirate and discard as much PBS as possible in the final wash.\nFeed in 3.5 L of 1x recombinant trypsin to detach the cells from the microcarriers while the G02 microcarriers remain intact. Set the temperature to 37 °C and the agitation speed to 60 rpm. Terminate the detachment within 45 min, when more than 80% of the cells have detached, with an equal amount of complete medium.\nTransfer directly from the harvest port to a prepared 15 L vessel for second-tier expansion.\n7. Vero cell expansion on V01 microcarriers in the stirred-tank bioreactor\nPrepare V01 microcarriers by transferring the lyophilized microcarriers into the bioreactor vessel together with PBS to a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Assemble and sterilize the vessel as mentioned in protocol section 2, but autoclave for 30 min instead.",
    "After sterilization, V01 microcarriers naturally settle down. Exchange the supernatant with basic DMEM two times using the bleed and feed tubes, and add the complete DMEM containing 10% NBS to 50%-75% of the volume of the vessel before proceeding to protocol section 3 for cell inoculation and culture.\nDifferent from the protocol detailed in protocol section 3, use 24 g of V01 microcarriers for a 4 L culture of Vero cells (i.e., a final concentration of 6 g/L), and inoculate 500 mL of 4 x 109 Vero cells (i.e., at a final density of 1 x 106 cells/mL).\nFollow steps 6.3-6.6 for the culture process parameters and passaging to second-tier expansion in the 15 L stirred-tank bioreactor.\nSubscription Required.
