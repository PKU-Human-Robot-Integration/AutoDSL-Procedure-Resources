    "1. Preparing the system\nNOTE: The following protocol describes how to prepare grids of a single sample. Usually, a minimum of 2 replicate grids are prepared for each sample or condition. For faster plunge speeds (less than ~ 20 ms time delay), 3 or 4 replicate grids are typically prepared to account for a reduced number of thin ice areas.\nDilute the protein sample to the target concentration in the desired buffer. Typically, final concentrations ≥ 2 mg/mL work well for grid preparation with the TED. Note that the sample can be kept on ice until step 10, from step 10 onwards the sample will spend considerable time at room temperature as it takes approximately 20 min to prepare 3-4 grids.\nTurn on the TED. Then turn on the control PC and start the control software.\nInitialize all syringe pumps by pressing the Initialize button (lower black button) on each syringe pump.\nTurn on the potentiometer power supply, set it to 9 V and start the oscilloscope control software.\nEnsure that the regulator valve of the N2-cylinder is closed. Open the cylinder valve. Then, slowly open the regulator valve setting the outlet pressure to the desired value for the spray gas pressure (typically 1-2 bar). For the PDMS nozzles used here, do not use pressures higher than ~ 2.5 bar to avoid damage to the nozzle. The continuously flowing gas prevents liquid from dripping and accumulating at the nozzle tip which can lead to irreproducible spraying.\nEnsure all syringe pump valves are in the 'load' position. This can be done by switching all valves to the 'dispense' position in the control software and then back to 'load'. Leave all valves switched to 'load'. Set all syringes to zero.",
    "Remove any air-bubbles present in the system at this stage. To do this, the syringes may have to be unscrewed, bubbles removed manually and the syringes mounted again when containing no more bubbles.\nThe liquid handling components are usually stored in H2O. Before loading the sample solution, equilibrate the liquid system with buffer by washing the tubing with an excess of buffer. Use an appropriate maximum liquid flowrate to avoid overpressure on the spray nozzle. Liquid flowrates > 10 µL/s may cause damage to the PDMS nozzles described here.\nPlace a 1.5 mL tube containing ≥ 200 µL buffer onto syringe 1 (the top must be pierced to attach to tubing).\n\t\nMake sure valve 1 is in 'load' position. Switch in the control software, if necessary.\nAspirate the desired amount (typically 50-100 µL) of buffer with syringe 1, through the control software.\nSwitch valve 1 to the 'dispense' position, through the control software.\nDispense all of the liquid in syringe 1, through the control software.\nReturn valve to 'load', reset the syringe position to '0' in the program and press initialize on syringe 1, to prepare the system for the next cycle.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 1.9.1 - 1.9.5 are usually repeated three times to ensure thorough washing of the tubing.\nLoad tweezers with an EM grid (no requirement for any specific type) by loosening the plunging arm clamp, placing the tweezers in the clamp and tightening the clamp.\nManually move the plunging arm so that grid and nozzle are at the same height (the 'sample application' position). If nozzle and grid are aligned, liquid will accumulate on the grid after spraying for an extended period. If necessary, adjust the nozzle position.",
    "Adjust the position of the liquid ethane cup by manually moving the plunging arm with mounted tweezers to its end position (reaching into the ethane cup). When set up correctly, a grid held by the tweezers will reach approximately the center of the liquid ethane cup.\nCheck that the 'run script' will use the desired flowrates, volumes and timings. See section 'The run sequence' above for details.\nMake sure nothing is obstructing the path of the plunger. Aspirate the volume of buffer required for a single run into syringe 1. This is done in the control software, see section 'The run sequence' for typical setting and volumes. Then make sure valve 1 is switched to the 'dispense' position. Perform a test run by pressing Run Script in the control software.\n\tCAUTION: Stay clear of the TED until the run sequence is finished. Moving parts could cause injury!\nWhen the 'run sequence' is finished, set the pressure on the plunging arm to the desired value (typically 1-2 bar). Only then press OK in the control software to release pressure from the plunging arm. If the 'run sequence' or pressure on the plunging arm need to be adjusted, these settings may be changed at this stage and steps 1.13 - 1.15 repeated.\n2. Fast Grid Preparation\nFill the liquid ethane/nitrogen container first with liquid nitrogen. When sufficiently cold and free of liquid nitrogen, fill the cup with liquid ethane. Avoid solidification of the liquid ethane. This step is the same as for conventional grid preparation.\n\tNOTE: To minimize ethane contamination, ensure that steps 2.2 - 2.13 are performed as quickly as possible\n\tCAUTION: Liquid ethane is a cryogen and flammable. Care should be taken when handling.",
    "Prepare cryo-EM grids for glow-discharge. We typically use holey carbon grids and glow-discharge for 90 s, at 0.1 mbar air pressure and 10 mA. Usually, no more than 4 grids are glow discharged at a time. The grids are used within 30 min of glow-discharging.\nEquilibrate the tubing with sample (following steps 1.9.1 - 1.9.5, using sample instead of buffer). If the available sample volume is low, the tubing may be equilibrated with only 1 dead volume.\nAspirate the amount of sample that is needed for a single run into syringe 1 in the control software (see section 'The run sequence' for details). Then switch valve 1 to the 'dispense' position.\nCheck that the relative humidity has reached the desired value (we typically prepare grids at 60 % relative humidity or higher). Once ≥ 60 % humidity is reached, open the humidity chamber only for a minimal amount of time, to maintain high humidity.\nPlace the tweezers, holding a glow-discharged grid, in the pneumatic plunger and fix them. Move the plunger to its start position (at the top).\nMake sure the slider of the potentiometer is in the start position, ready for the measurement, by moving it manually to contact the plunger. Set the trigger on the oscilloscope in the oscilloscope software.\nPlace the liquid ethane/nitrogen container.\nPress Run Script in the control software. When prompted, click OK in the control software to start the run.\n\tCAUTION: Stay clear of the TED until the run sequence is finished. Moving parts could cause injury!\nOnce the 'run sequence' is completed, release the pressure on the pneumatic plunger by clicking OK in the control software.",
    "Open humidity chamber, loosen the connection between plunging arm and tweezers with one hand while securing the tweezers with the other. When the tweezers are free, move the plunging arm up while keeping the grid in the liquid ethane. Then transfer the grid to its storage space in the surrounding liquid N2. After freezing, the grid needs to be kept at liquid N2 temperature at all times.\nSave the oscilloscope measurement. Manually reset the position of the potentiometer slider and plunger afterwards.\nRepeat steps 2.4-2.12 to prepare replicate grids\nTransfer the grids into long-term storage until grid clipping and data collection.\nWash the system with buffer, according to steps 1.9.1 - 1.9.5. Then wash the system with H2O, according to steps 1.9.1 - 1.9.5.\nTurn off the main nitrogen gas regulator and turn off the power.\nPlace the ethane/nitrogen container in a fume hood to let it warm up and let the liquid ethane and N2 evaporate.\n3. Time-resolved cryo-EM\nNOTE: When time-resolved experiments are conducted with the TED, there are additional aspects to be considered, although the basic setup and variables remain the same. It is assumed here that two solutions are mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio to produce the final mixture which is deposited on the grid. Follow the protocol described in '1. Fast grid preparation with the TED', with the following changes:\nUse higher stock concentrations for mixing experiments than for simple spray experiments. Mixing in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio will result in a 2x dilution of each component.\nFor a rapid mixing experiment, use all three syringes rather than just a single one.\n\t\nAttach tubing to syringe pumps 2-3.\nAttach tubing from syringe pumps 2-3 to the spray nozzle.",
    "Equilibrate all three syringes in buffer and sample separately. Typically, syringe 1 is filled with sample A and syringes 2-3 are filled with sample B (Figure 3).\nChange the run sequence. An example for a run sequence using all 3 syringes for a rapid mixing experiment is given in Figure 6. See also section 'The run sequence' for details.\nDifferent time delays can be achieved in two ways:\n\t\nChange the plunger speed. By adjusting the plunger speed, the time delay can be changed in a relatively narrow range. For example, with a spray/ethane distance of 2 cm, the plunger can be moved at 1 m/s or 2 m/s to give a time delay of 20 ms or 10 ms, respectively. This is done as described in step 1.15.\nChange the spray/ethane position by adjusting the (vertical) position of the spray nozzle. If the nozzle is positioned at a 5 cm distance from the ethane surface, for example, a plunge speed of 1 m/s gives a time delay of 50 ms. Achieving significantly longer time delays requires further modifications to the setup.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to laminar flow in the flow focussing region of the nozzle, we do not expect significant mixing in this part of the nozzle. Instead, we expect that mixing occurs during spray generation, in droplets en route to the grid and during droplet spreading on the grid. The time of flight for spray droplets to reach the grid is estimated ≤ 1 ms (for a droplet speed of ≥ 10 m/s and a nozzle-grid distance of 1 cm). Thus, only the time between droplet landing and vitrification is considered the 'time delay'.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
