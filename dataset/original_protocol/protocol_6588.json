Glass coverslips are handled with a pair of tweezers and inserted in a Teflon holder (white), which is transferred into a beaker with Piranha solution for cleaning (Procedure A). For passivation of the coverslips they are transferred into a glass holder and incubated with the Sil-PEG passivation solution in a Schlenk flask at 80 °C in an oil bath. The Schlenk flask can be attached to a vacuum and nitrogen line via its valve to provide an inert reaction container (not shown, Procedure B). After cleaning and drying the coverslips, specific ligands and gold nanoparticles (red solution) are immobilized by incubating a drop of the respective solution in-between two coverslips. To remove the coverslips again from each other, additional water or PBS is injected with a pipette and the upper coverslip is lifted with a pair of tweezers (Procedures C-E). To observe the surfaces at an inverted microscope they are glued with a two-component silicon glue (yellow and blue gel) into a Petri dish with a custom-made hole in the center (2 mm smaller than the coverslip) (Procedure F). The final device is shown in the last figure, where medium and cells can be added before transferring to a microscope. Further information is provided at the steps indicated below the pictures.Cleaning of glass surfacesClean and activate coverslips in a Teflon holder in ~100 ml freshly prepared ‘Piranha solution’ [3:1 (v/v) sulfuric acid: hydrogen peroxide] for 1 h. Make sure the coverslips are completely covered by solution (Figure 2, cleaning). Stir the Piranha solution e.g., with an acid-resistant Pasteur pipette.CAUTION: Piranha solution is very corrosive and reacts exothermic. It must not get in contact with organic solvents. Perform every work step containing Piranha solution under a fume hood with constant ventilation.",
    "Note: From here on transfer and handle the coverslips only with tweezers (Figure 2). Remove ‘Piranha solution’ from the coverslips by carefully decanting it into an appropriate waste container according to the safety regulations of your institute, e.g., discarding after 10-20x diluted in water.Rinse coverslips 3 times with DI water and twice with ultra-pure water.Sonicate coverslips in ultra-pure water once for 5 min in ultrasonic cleaner at ~60 watt (standard sonication power).Dry surfaces in a nitrogen stream by holding them carefully with tweezers. Check point: Observe by eye that no stripes or drops of water remain else repeat Steps A3-A4 or discard the coverslip.Passivation of glass surfacesTransfer dried coverslips to a glass holder with tweezers and avoid touching them in the center.Prepare passivation solution as indicated in Table 1 (depending on the desired surface Opt. I-III, see Figure 1A) under continuous protective nitrogen atmosphere in a Schlenk flask (Figure 2, passivation). All steps involving organic solvents (Steps B2-B7) shall be performed following the safety regulations of your institute under a fume hood with constant ventilation. Create a protective atmosphere by connecting the Schlenk flask to a vacuum line and nitrogen supply. First vacuum-empty the flask, then flush with nitrogen and reduce the nitrogen stream in the following to add the powdery PEG, dried toluene and triethylamine.Table 1. Passivation compositions for the three different type of surfaces (Option I-III). Option I should be chosen when the adhesion of cells to a specific ligand is to be tested, Option II to access the forces at such specific ligands and Option III when ligand-specific adhesion to the surface should be granted independent of the force measurements of specific ligands.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233508_7030.jpegAdd coverslips under protective atmosphere into the Schlenk flask in the solution and close the lid and gas supply.",
    "The reaction is now kept under protective atmosphere.Heat tube overnight at 78-80 °C in an oil bath. The oil bath can be set up combining the heat-resistant glass tub filled with oil on the magnetic stirrer. The additional thermostat keeps the temperature constant.Wash passivated coverslips by sonication in ethyl acetate for 5 min within their glass holder.Wash passivated coverslips by sonication in methanol for another 5 min within their glass holder.Pause point: It is possible to store passivated glass surfaces in methanol for up to 5 days if they are not used immediately. Dry surfaces in a nitrogen stream by holding them carefully with tweezers. Nitrogen stream can be dosed carefully with a compressed air gun. Make sure not to scratch the passivated surfaces during the entire procedure. Check point: As control for proper passivation add a dye (e.g., 100 nM StarRed in PBS) or seed adhesive cells on a passivated versus a non-passivated coverslip and observe their attachment to the surface under a microscope. For reuse, clean the used Schlenk flask and glass sample holder from PEG residue in a potassium hydroxide bath overnight and wash them afterwards with DI water.Option I–Immobilization of specific cellular ligandsPrepare 100 µl of the reaction mixture for copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, see Recipe 7) containing the desired cellular ligand.Note: Choose appropriate alkyne or azide functionalized PEG for azide or alkyne-ligands, respectively. Prepare a humidity chamber with parafilm on the bottom and a wet tissue inside a Petri dish where coverslips are placed onto (Figure 2, immobilization). Parafilm is used to hold the coverslips in their spot and to ease the separation of ‘sandwiched’ glasses later on.Place a drop of 100 µl click mixture on top of a passivated and dried coverslip. Place a second, identical coverslip on top of the first one.",
    "Incubate the ‘sandwich’ for 2 h at room temperature (RT).Option II–Immobilization of DNA hairpin force sensorsPlace a drop of 250-300 µl of the gold nanoparticle solution on top of a passivated and dried coverslip.Incubate the coverslips for 30 min at RT.In the meantime, hybridize hairpin force sensors using ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ and ‘hairpin’ ssDNA. Use DNA mixture and annealing program as indicated (see Recipe 8). If DNA strands are purchased unlabeled, DNA and fluorophore should be coupled in a previous step (see Recipe 4 for labeling of DNA strands below).Separate the surfaces by carefully pipetting 300 µl ultra-pure water in-between the glasses and pick them up with a pair of tweezers (Figure 2, Immobilization). Clean them from supernatant gold nanoparticle solution by thoroughly rinsing with ~10 ml ultra-pure water.Check point: Confirm successful immobilization of gold nanoparticles by the pink shine of the coverslip. Remove excess liquid with tissues over the coverslip edges without letting them run completely dry or touching them.Place a drop of 100 µl DNA mixture on top of a gold-coated coverslip.Place a second, identical coverslip with the gold nanoparticle-coated side facing down on top of the first one.Incubate the ‘sandwich’ overnight at 4 °C under exclusion of light.Prepare 100 µl of the reaction mixture for CuAAC (see Recipe 7) containing tripeptide/ligand.Separate and clean the surfaces carefully from DNA mixture by washing in PBS (analogous to Step D4).Remove excess liquid with tissues over the coverslip edges without letting them run completely dry or touching them.Place a drop of 100 µl click mixture on top of a DNA-coated coverslip.Place a second, identical coverslip with the DNA-coated side facing down on top of the first one.Incubate the ‘sandwich’ for 2 h at RT in the humidity chamber under exclusion of light to avoid bleaching of the fluorophores.",
    "Option III–Combination of specific cellular ligand and DNA hairpin force sensorsPrepare 100 µl of the 1st reaction mixture for CuAAC (see Recipe 7) containing 1st ligand.Prepare a humidity chamber with a wet tissue inside a Petri dish and flat parafilm on the bottom where coverslips are placed onto.Place a drop of 100 µl click mixture on top of a passivated and dried coverslip.Place a second, identical coverslip on top of the first one.Incubate the ‘sandwich’ for 2 h at RT.Separate and clean the surfaces carefully from click mixture by washing in PBS (analogous to Step D4).Further steps are equal to ‘D) Immobilization of DNA hairpin force sensor immobilization’ Steps D1-D14 using the 2nd ligand at Step D9.Sample preparation for microscopySeparate and clean the surfaces carefully from click mixture by washing in PBS (analogous to Step D4).Remove excess liquid with tissues over the coverslip edges without letting them run completely dry or touching them.Glue coverslips with the functionalized surface facing up into Petri dishes with custom made holes (2 mm smaller than the coverslips) in the bottom. Therefore, mix ~200 µl of Twinsil 22 silicon 1:1 e.g., with a pipette tip and apply the glue on the edges of the hole, such as the coverslip completely covers the hole and is surrounded by glue.Wait curing time of the glue (~ 5 min, check with the remaining glue ). If necessary, clean surface by washing in PBS to remove glue contamination.Check for successful immobilization of cellular ligands and force sensors by comparing cellular attachment (Procedure G) and homogenous background fluorescence, respectively, of only passivated coverslips versus those with immobilized ligands (Procedure C) or force sensors (Procedure D).Assays with cells (U2OS)Bring chamber for cell observation to 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.Fill 2-3 ml cellular medium (0.",
    "5% FBS) (see Recipe 5) in the Petri dishes prepared in step F covering the functionalized coverslip. Use medium with low FBS content to prevent unspecific ligand interactions and improve microscopy. Use a cell culture fume hood to prevent medium or cell culture contamination.Harvest adherent cells from culture flask by washing with PBS and detach with Accutase following standard protocols (e.g., Basic Cell Culture Protocols (Helgason and Miller, 2004)).Note: Accutase gently detaches cells for faster spreading results.Seed cells in diluted concentration to allow an undisturbed spread. In case of U2OS 105 cells reach an adequate density (calculated from T-25 and 35 mm dish flask surface for around 1:10 dilution).Wait until cells settle down and start productively spreading on the surfaces (10-30 min).Note: Force transmission is observed best 30 min post seeding cells and appears as bright dots and radial stripes of opened DNA hairpin sensors (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233551_5530.pngFigure 3. U2OS cells adhering and exerting forces on specific ligand presenting surfaces. Representative bright-field, interference reflection microscopy (IRM) and fluorescence wide-field images of U2OS cells 15-20 min after seeding on the surfaces with (A) option I: cRGD-functionalization and (B) option II: cRGD-linked DNA hairpin sensors (4.2 pN opening force; StarRed-fluorophore). Scale bars = 10 µm.Assays with sporozoitesTry to keep the edges of the coverslip as dry as possible, whereas the center of the functionalized surface should be kept humid. This eases the silicon chamber founding.Press a silicon chamber with its sticky side on the edges of the functionalized coverslip to minimize the cellular distribution area (Note: silicon sticks best on dry glass). Purchased multi-well chambers can be cut to a fitting size. This step can be skipped, but eases to generate an adequate parasite density.Fill 15 µl sporozoite medium (6% BSA) (see Recipe 6) into the silicon chamber.",
    "Add 15 µl ice-cooled PBS containing freshly isolated sporozoites from 6-8 pairs of well infected mosquitoes’ salivary glands (for a detailed protocol of mosquito infection and sporozoite collection see Prinz et al., 2017) resulting in 3%-BSA-medium.Notes:FBS-reduced cellular medium (0.5% FBS) can be use as well.Do not keep salivary glands on ice for prolonged times as this could harm the sporozoite motility.Usage of GFP-tagged sporozoites eases the selection of well infected salivary glands as well as their isolation. They can be employed on ligand-presenting surfaces (option I, see Figure 4A), but care must be taken to choose proper filter sets when using them together with force sensors (Figure 4B) to avoid fluorescent bleach through.Spin cells down to surface in a centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 3 min. Well-founded silicon chamber can stand this procedure. Motility can be observed directly after attaching to the surfaces for around 30 min (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233617_3113.pngFigure 4. Sporozoites (P. berghei) gliding on specific ligand presenting surfaces. Representative bright-field, interference reflection microscopy (IRM) and fluorescence wide-field time lapse images of (A) GFP-expressing sporozoites 5 min after seeding on the surfaces with option I: cRGD-functionalization and (B) WT sporozoites 5 min after seeding on the surfaces with option II: cRGD-linked DNA hairpin sensors (4.2 pN opening force; StarRed-fluorophore). For Option II Osteosarcoma cells (hollow arrow) were seeded together with the sporozoites as a positive control for the DNA-based force sensors (see Figure 3). Sporozoites adhere and glide on both surfaces, however, no tension signal was detected with the DNA hairpin sensors. This might be due to sub-threshold forces, few surface interactions or too short adhesion times (sporozoites move at ~2 µm/s), which do not allow for detectable unfolding of the tension probes, while osteosarcoma cells adhering on the same substrates gave rise to fluorescent signals (hollow arrow).",
    "Bright fluorescent spots (full arrow) are auto fluorescent remnants from the purification of Sporozoites out of mosquitoes’ salivary glands. Scale bars = 10 µm.Microscopy settingsImaging was performed on a fluorescence wide-field microscope (Olympus) equipped with a custom-made environmental chamber for cellular conditions (37 °C; 5% CO2). Sporozoites were usually imaged at RT without CO2 supply but we also successfully performed gliding motility assays under cellular conditions.Brightfield images were taken with a polarized light filter set.Fluorescence microscopy images were taken with excitation bandpass filter 632/22 nm and emission filter 679/34 nm.Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) images were taken with excitation bandpass filter 542/27 nm in IRM mode (set emission bandpass filter 525/48 nm) with minimal exposure time and intensity. IRM observation can be thus used as a low-bleaching control for cell adherence to the surface during the imaging process."
