We provide an estimated amount of breeding mice required to obtain a realistic number of experimental MADM animals (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). We provide step-by-step breeding guidance in the following section of this protocol (also see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]):\nFor both breeding strategies, perform Breeding step 1 for gene-X of interest: In order to link the mutation of gene-X to the MADM TG cassette, cross MADMTG/TG animals with a mouse line mutant for gene-X (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(i) and 2C(i)). The resulting F1 generation will be trans-heterozygous for the MADM TG cassette and the mutation of interest (genotype will be MADMTG/+; gene-X+/-).\nFor both breeding strategies, perform Breeding step 1 for the Cre driver (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(iii) and 2C(ii)): cross MADMGT/GT animals with a Cre driver of choice. The resulting F1 generation will be double heterozygous for the MADM GT cassette and the Cre driver specific for the cell type of interest (MADMGT/+; Cre+/-). Perform this step in parallel to the above step.\nAllow F1 generation mice to grow up to 8 weeks of age. For breeding strategy 2, proceed to step 6. For breeding strategy 1, continue with steps 3, 4 and 5.\nFor strategy 1, perform Breeding step 2 for the mutant by crossing MADMTG/+;gene-X+/- mice with MADMTG/TG animals in order to generate F2 offspring homozygous for the MADM TG cassette and meiotically linked gene-X (MADMTG/TG,gene-X) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(ii)).",
    "For strategy 1, perform Breeding step 2 for the Cre driver by intercrossing MADMGT/+; Cre+/- mice with MADMGT/+; Cre+/- animals in order to generate F2 offspring homozygous for the MADM GT cassette and the Cre driver. The resulting genotype will be MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(iv)). Perform this step parallel to step 3.\nAllow F2 generation mice to grow up to 8 weeks of age.\nFor the generation of experimental MADM animals according to strategy 1, cross MADMTG/TG,gene-X mice with MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ animals in order to generate experimental offspring with genetic mosaic tissue with green mutant, red wild-type and yellow heterozygous cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(v)). The genotype of the experimental MADM animals is MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(v)). The probability to obtain experimental MADM animals from this breeding is 50%. The probability for control-MADM animals is also 50%, i.e., animals with MADM-labelling but without mutation. With an estimated litter size of 10 pups per litter, this means that you require 1 breeding cage to obtain a total of 5 experimental MADM mice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(vi)).\nCheck for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to expedite the experimental planning.\nMale and female offspring can be used as experimental animals.\nPerform experiment at developmental stage(s) of choice.\nFor the generation of experimental MADM animals according to strategy 2, cross trans-heterozygous MADMTG/+;gene-X+/-mice directly with double heterozygous MADMGT/+; Cre+/- animals in order to generate experimental MADM offspring with genetic mosaic tissue with green mutant, red wild-type and yellow heterozygous cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iii)). The genotype of the experimental MADM animals is MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iii)). The probability to obtain experimental MADM animals from this breeding is ∼5%. With an estimated litter size of 10 pups per litter, you require ∼10 breeding cages and ∼100 pups to obtain a total of 5 experimental MADM mice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iv)).",
    "Check for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to expedite the experimental planning.\nMale and female offspring can be used as experimental animals.\nPerform experiment at developmental stage(s) of choice.\nNote: In the following examples described in this protocol, all tissue was analyzed at specific postnatal stages. However, experimental animals can also be used at embryonic stages, P0, and any postnatal age depending on your experimental needs.\nIn order to provide a broad overview of applications suitable for histological analysis using MADM in this protocol, we made use of a number of different Cre drivers: (1) constitutively active Emx1-Cre and TM-inducible Emx1-CreER that primarily targets radial glia progenitors in the dorsal forebrain, which give rise to excitatory projection neurons and glial cells in the cerebral cortex (Gorski et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Kessaris et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). (2) We include an example using constitutively active Nestin-Cre and inducible Nestin-CreER (Petersen et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Imayoshi et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), which is a marker of stem cells across the nervous system and therefore results in MADM labeling in all neural cell types including Purkinje cells; (3) and make use of constitutively active Hprt-Cre (Tang et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) which shows ubiquitous spatiotemporal expression. The Hprt-Cre driver was utilized to investigate peripheral organs, in particular the intestine. MADM can also be applied for experiments involving flow cytometry. For details and a step-by-step protocol on the experimental workflow specific for flow cytometry experiments, we refer to (Laukoter et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Specific considerations when breeding experimental MADM animals are provided in the next two sections of the protocol:\nGeneration of experimental MADM mice for postnatal histological analysis in brain\nTiming: 3 weeks–12 months",
    "For population analysis, cross MADMGT/GT; Emx1Cre/Cre or MADMGT/GT; Nestin-Cre+/+ females with MADMTG/TG;gene-X males in order to generate offspring with genetic mosaic brain tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, bottom panel) (also see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]). For clonal analysis, cross MADMGT/GT; Emx1CreER/CreER or MADMGT/GT; Nestin-CreER+/+ females with MADMTG/TG;gene-X males in order to generate offspring with genetic mosaic brain tissue following TM injection at a time point of choice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, bottom panel) (also see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]). For simplicity, the above mentioned distinct Cre/ER drivers will be abbreviated as “Cre” throughout step 7.\nCheck for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to facilitate the experimental planning.\nMales and females of the resulting F1 generation can be used as experimental animals (genotype will be MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/-).\nNote: Upon crossing MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ females with MADMTG/TG,gene-X males to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- mosaic animals, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show uniparental paternal chromosome disomy (patUPD, PP), while red wild-type cells will show uniparental maternal chromosome disomy (matUPD, MM) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). We refer to this breeding scheme as ‘default breeding scheme.’\nNote: In order to reverse the fluorescent colors to control for a potential bias of the fluorescent reporter (color swap), couple the mutation to the MADM GT cassette and use MADMTG/TG females and MADMGT/GT,gene-X; Cre+/+ males (Laukoter et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Here, red cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show patUPD (PP), while green wild-type cells will show matUPD (MM) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). For efficient conduction of this control experiment, we recommend to perform the color swap in the context of population analysis using a constitutively active Cre driver and not a TM-inducible CreER.",
    "Note: In order to reverse the parents to control for a potential genomic imprinting bias of the parental origin of the mutation (parent swap), use MADMTG/TG,gene-X females and MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ males (Laukoter et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- mosaic animals. Here, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show matUPD (MM), while red wild-type cells will show patUPD (PP) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Given that the generation of stock lines for your experiments will yield MADMTG/TG,gene-X females and MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ males in any case, use the opportunity of having these mice available and perform the parent swap in parallel to your ‘default breeding’ setup. For efficient conduction of this control experiment, we recommend to perform it in the context of population analysis using a constitutively active Cre driver and not a TM-inducible CreER.\nPerform experiment at your desired postnatal time point, for example when generation of cell types is completed and the cells have reached a fully developed, mature state (in our examples shown in this protocol we chose time points between P1 and P21).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1163-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Breeding schemes for default setup, color swap, and parent swap\n(A) Schematic showing the default breeding scheme using males where gene-X is meiotically linked to the MADM TG cassette, while females transmit the GT cassette and the Cre driver.

Thus, Cre activity and MADM labelling are highly variable in MADMGT/TG,gene-X; HprtCre/+ females. We therefore recommend to primarily use males for your analysis in order to obtain reproducible results.\nNote: Upon crossing MADMGT/GT; HprtCre/+ females with MADMTG/TG,gene-X males to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; HprtCre/+ mosaic animals, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show patUPD, while red wild-type cells will show matUPD.\nNote: If desired, perform color swap and parent swap (Laukoter et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) as described in the notes for step 7 of the protocol.\nPerform the experiment at the desired postnatal time point, to e.g., analyze cellular phenotypes arising during development in mature tissue and/or trace disease phenotypes when a disease phenotype is evident (up to several months of age).\nMouse perfusion and dissection for collection of MADM-labelled tissue for histological analysis\nTiming: 12–16 h",
    "This section of the protocol documents the perfusion and dissection of postnatal mice for organ removal and further downstream histological analysis.\nCritical: 4% PFA should be ice-cold and protected from light.\nArrange all solutions and tools required for the tissue collection at the dissection area\nAnesthesia\n1× PBS\n4% PFA\nPeristaltic pump or perfusion syringes\nDissection tools\n6-well plates\nCritical: Make sure no air bubbles are trapped in the tubes of the peristaltic pump or within the syringe containing the perfusion buffers. Bubbles may destroy the tissue during the perfusion process. Run the tubes of the pump with PBS prior to starting the perfusion procedure to make sure all air is removed.\nAnesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia working solution at a volume of 0.16–0.24 mL/10 g mouse (equivalent to 400–600 mg/kg).\nCritical: Mice require deep anesthesia before any further procedure can be applied. Test the efficiency of anesthesia by pinching a paw with forceps. Only when the mouse does not display any movement after pinching, you can proceed with the dissection and perfusion.\nPlace the anesthetized animal in supine position on a perfusion tray and disinfect fur with 70% ethanol.\nBelow the rib cage, make a medial incision with scissors and surgical forceps through the skin and the underlying muscle layer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Continue to cut laterally.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1163-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Then trim the rib cage to expose the heart.\nUsing small iris scissors make an incision to the posterior end of the right atrium for the blood to drain during the following perfusion procedure (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Insert a needle attached to a peristaltic pump or a syringe filled with 1× PBS into the lower left ventricle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPerfuse with PBS until the liver turns pale (requires approximately 5–10 mL of PBS).\nOnce complete, switch the perfusion solution to 4% PFA.\nNote: Perfusion requirements need to be adjusted according to the age of the animals. (a) For the perfusion of pups: perfuse manually using 10 mL syringes. Prepare 2 distinct 10 mL syringes: one filled with 1× PBS and another filled with 4% PFA. Once perfusion with PBS is completed, replace PBS-containing syringe plus needle with fresh needle and syringe containing PFA through the same puncture hole in the heart. (b) For the perfusion of juvenile and adult mice, use a peristaltic pump. Place one end of the tube of the peristaltic pump into a flask or Falcon tube filled with PBS. After perfusion with PBS (speed: 5 mL at 2–4 mL/min in juvenile animals; 10 mL at 4–6 mL/min for adult mice), switch to 4% PFA.\nCritical: briefly stop the peristaltic pump and exchange the PBS solution with ice-cold 4% PFA. This is critical to avoid bubbles in the pump tubing. Resume perfusion with PFA at the same speed.\nRemove mouse from perfusion pad and dissect the organ of interest. If organ of interest is brain, continue to follow the protocol. If organ of interest is a peripheral organ, proceed to step 27.\nDissection of brain:\nDecapitate mouse.\nRemove the skin over the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCut the skull at the naso-frontal suture (in front of the olfactory bulbs) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nThen cut along the midline (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F), followed by a cut along the parietal-interparietal sutures.\nLift the skull to the side to expose the brain (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).",
    "Place curved forceps or a thin spatula underneath the brain and remove it from the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nCritical: Avoid mechanical damage of brain tissue during the dissection to ensure you obtain intact tissue for high quality analysis.\nTransfer the brain to a well filled with ice-cold 4%PFA in a 6-well plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nIncubate at 4°C for minimum 10 h.\nNext day, wash 3× with 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nTransfer brain to a 15 mL Falcon tube filled with 10 mL of 30% Sucrose.\nIncubate at 4°C until the brain has sunk to the bottom of the Falcon tube.\nRemove brain from sucrose and gently remove residual sugar from the surface of the brain using lint-free tissues.\nDepending on the cell type of interest and the needs of the experiment, embed brain in coronal or sagittal orientation:\nFor coronal orientation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J), place brain ventral-side down on a piece of lint-free tissue and remove the cerebellum using a razor blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K and 4L). Place brain with the caudal side down in an embedding mold (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M), fill mold and cover tissue with O.C.T. Tissue tek and freeze. Once frozen, store it at −80°C.\nFor sagittal orientation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N), place brain ventral-side down on a piece of lint-free tissue and cut it in two halves along the midline using a razor blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]O and 4P). Place brain with the medial side down in an embedding mold (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]Q), fill mold and cover tissue with O.C.T. Tissue tek and freeze. Once frozen, store it at −80°C.\nPause point: You can keep the frozen tissue at −80°C until further usage.\nDissection of peripheral organ (this protocol is using the colon as an example):\nRemove colon from the mouse and place it on lint-free tissue.",

Tissue Tek and freeze (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]V). Once frozen, store it at −80°C.\nPause point: You can keep the frozen tissue at −80°C until further usage.\nCritical: Optimal tissue freezing during embedding is achieved when embedding molds are placed on dry ice. Control the tissue during the freezing process from time to time and avoid loss of position within the mold.\nTissue sectioning for histological analysis\nTiming: 30 min–3 h\nThis section of the protocol lists details on sectioning MADM-labelled tissue for confocal microscopy.\nRemove tissue from −80°C and transfer to a cryostat cooled to −20°C.\nLet tissue adapt to temperature change for 20 min.\nRemove tissue block from the embedding mold.\nAttach the tissue block to the specimen disk in the cryostat by applying a drop of OCT to the disk and placing the tissue block directly into the OCT. Allow to freeze for 1–2 min.\nInsert disk with attached tissue block in the sectioning holder by placing the tissue in a correct orientation.",
    "Note: For brain sections, insert sectioning disc with cortex facing towards the top. For peripheral organ sections, insert sectioning disc with organ of choice in an orientation that guarantees good sectioning quality for your required analysis.\nStart cutting by trimming the tissue block in 45 μm thick sections until the region of interest is reached.\nSlice the tissue in 30 μm thick sections. Either collect the slices in individual wells of a 24 well plate (= floating sections) or mount them directly onto frosted glass slides.\nPause point: Floating sections can be kept in PBS at 4°C for up to 48 h. When longer storage is required, exchange the PBS with cryoprotectant and store at −20°C.\nPause point: Directly mounted sections can be stored in a slide box at −20°C until further usage.\nTissue mounting\nTiming: 15 min–1 h\nThis part of the protocol can be skipped if the sliced tissue is directly mounted onto frosted glass slides in the course of the sectioning process. In that case, immediately proceed to step 45 of the protocol. If you prepared floating sections, continue with step 40.\nFill a Petri dish with PBS-T.\nPlace a frosted glass slide at the edge of the petri dish so that is covered up nearly to the label with PBS-T.\nTransfer all of your desired sections into the dish filled with PBS-T.\nUse a small paint brush to maneuver the sections onto the slide and arrange them side by side.\nOnce all sections are placed onto the slide (for brain usually ∼12−16 sections/slide), horizontally transfer the slide to a dark slide chamber and let the sections dry completely (∼15 min) to make them adhere to the glass. Either proceed to the next steps of the staining procedure or pause the protocol at this point.",
    "Pause point: Store the mounted slides at 4°C for 10–16 h and continue with the protocol on the next day.\nStaining\nTiming: 3–16 h\nThis section of the protocol explains the staining procedure for MADM-labelled cells together with an additional, cell-type specific marker staining. All steps are performed at 22°C–25°C unless otherwise stated. Please refer to troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] when observing variable signals.\nIf your sections were floating sections and have been freshly mounted and dried, immediately proceed to step 46 of the protocol. If your sections were already mounted during sectioning and stored at −20°C, take the slides from the freezer and let them dry for 15 min.\nEncircle staining area with a hydrophobic pen.\nRehydrate and wash sections 3× 5 min with 1× PBS to remove residual PBS-T.\nMeanwhile, heat up an oven to 85°C. Take the opportunity to put the antigen retrieval buffer into the oven to have the solution pre-heated. Our most commonly used antigen retrieval solution is Citrate Buffer pH 6.0.\nIncubate your sections with 1 mL pre-heated citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 25 min at 85°C in a dark and closed staining chamber (make sure it is closed. If it is open, buffer will evaporate and samples will dry out).\nRemove the staining chamber and let chill on your bench for 15 min. Open it on one corner a tiny bit so the samples can cool down more efficiently (don’t open too much, otherwise the buffer will evaporate and samples will dry out).\nWash 3× 5 min with 1× PBS.\nIncubate with 500 μL Blocking Solution for 1 h.\nPlace humidified tissues into the staining chamber to prevent your samples from dehydration during the next steps of the protocol.",
    "Dilute primary antibodies in Staining Solution, add 250 μL antibody mix for one sample and incubate 8–12 h at 4°C.\nWash 3× 5 min with 1× PBS.\nDilute secondary antibodies in Staining Solution, add 250 μL antibody mix for one sample and incubate for 2 h.\nWash 3× 5 min with 1× PBS.\nAdd 1 mL DAPI working solution for 15 min.\nWash 1× 10 min in PBS\nEmbed the slides with Mowiol and let dry at 22°C–25°C for 30 min.\nPause point: Keep the slides at 4°C until imaging. Image quality is highest upon timely acquisition of images following the staining procedure. We recommend to image the sections within 14 days after completion of step 60.\nNote: Instead of mounting the floating sections onto glass slides prior to the staining procedure, the whole staining protocol can be performed on floating sections in a 24well plate. Buffers are removed manually using a pasteur pipet or a P1000. We recommend the following volumes when performing stainings in 24well plates:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1163_17.csv\nHere, sections should be mounted after the final washing step following the secondary antibody staining. Mounting process is equivalent to steps 40 to 44 of the protocol.

Adjust the z-stack so that all MADM-labeled cells in the tissue are captured.\nAssign the center position of your Z-stack to the tiles and the positions and click “Start” to initiate image acquisition.\nSave the image in .czi file format.\nNote: For tissue overview images and cell number quantification, select a 10× objective and use a scanning speed pixel dwell value of 1.52–2.06 μs (values 7–8 in the ZEN blue image acquisition software) with resolution 1024 × 1024 and no averaging. For high-quality images and morphological analysis, use a high magnification objective (e.g. 63×) and use a scanning speed pixel dwell value of maximum 2.06 μs (up to value 7 in the ZEN blue image acquisition software) with resolution 1024 × 1024 and 2× or 4× averaging.\nPause point: The protocol can be stopped at this point. Image processing and analysis can be performed at any time after image acquisition.",
    "Once image acquisition is completed, use the image processing dashboard in ZEN blue and perform maximum intensity projection using the “Orthogonal Projection” function.\nFollowing projection, perform “Stitching” function by fusing tiles.\nSave the projected and stitched image as a new .czi file.\nExport the projected and stitched .czi file to TIFF format. Export DAPI / GFP / tdT / Alexa647 channels individually for subsequent image analysis."
