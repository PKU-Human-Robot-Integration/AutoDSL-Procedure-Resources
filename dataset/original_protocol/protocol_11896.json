    "1. Food Preparation\nFor stock maintenance and for larval growth, use a cornmeal medium containing 3 % powdered yeast, 10 % sucrose, 9 % precooked cornmeal, 0.4 % agar, thereafter called Cornmeal medium (CM).\nPut 30 g of yeast into 100 mL of tap water, bring it to a boil and let it boil for 15 min.\nSeparately, mix well 90 g of precooked cornmeal, 100 g of sugar, and 4 g of agar into 900 mL of tap water.\nBring the solution to a boil, lower the heat and cook for 5 minutes stirring continuously.\nAfter 5 minutes, add the hot yeast solution and simmer for another 15 min.\nTurn off the heat source and allow the solution to cool to about 60 °C.\nAdd 5 mL/L of 10% methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in ethanol, mix thoroughly and let it sit for 10 min.  \nNOTE: Be careful with the amount of methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, given that a high concentration of fungicide could be lethal for larvae.\nDispense the medium into vials/bottles:  8 mL into each fly vial (25 mm x 95 mm), 3 mL into each fly vial (22 mm x 63 mm) and 60 mL into each fly bottle (250 mL). \nCover vials with cheesecloth and allow them to dry at room temperature (RT) for 24 h prior to storage.\nCalibrate experimentally right consistency and hydration of the CM by modifying either the amount of agar used and/or the cooling/drying times.\n\t\tNote: unplugged, boxed and wrapped vials are stable for about 15 days at 4 °C. \nFor Drosophila adults, use a medium containing 10% powdered yeast, 10% sucrose, 2% agar, thereafter called adult medium (AM).\nMix 10 g of powdered yeast, 10 g of sucrose, 2 g of agar into 100 mL of distilled water.",
    "Bring this mixture to a boil two times, with a 3 minutes interval, or until agar is dissolved, by using a microwave. \nOnce the solution cools to 60 °C, add 5 mL/L of 10% Methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in ethanol, mix thoroughly and dispense in vials (10 mL per vial).\nCover vials with cheesecloth and let them dry at RT for 24 h before storing. \nNOTE: unplugged, boxed and wrapped vials are stable for about 15 days at 4 °C.\nFor fecundity/fertility assay, use Drosophila tomato juice-cornmeal medium.\nPour off 70 mL of warm cornmeal food into a 100 mL beaker and add 30 mL of tomato juice (30% v/v).\nMix thoroughly with a food processor and pipet 3 mL in small vials.\nCover vials with cheesecloth and allow them to dry at RT for 24 h prior to storage. \nNOTE: unplugged, boxed and wrapped vials are stable for about 15 days at 4 °C.\nFor embryo collection, use agar plates, containing 3% agar, 30% tomato sauce, and 3% sugar. \nNOTE: be careful not to make bubbles when pouring the medium in the plates.\n2. Drosophila EDC Dosing\nPrepare an appropriate stock solution dissolving the selected EDC in the suitable solvent. For the EE2 (molecular weight 296.403), dissolve 1.48 g in 10 mL of 100% ethanol to make a 0.5 M stock solution and store at -80 °C.\nCAUTION: EDCs are considered environmental pollutant and precautions should be taken in handling them. \nDilute the EE2 stock solution in 10% ethanol in water (v/v) in order to obtain a 100 mM solution. Make next dilutions (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM) in CM food, starting with lowest concentration and using the same final concentration of solvent for each treatment group. For the control vials use same volume of the solvent alone.",
    "Note: it is recommended to keep the final concentration of the solvent as low as possible, bearing in mind that final concentration of ethanol should not exceed 2% in fly food.\nAdd the solution containing the right dilution of the selected EDC to the cornmeal-based food before solidification, mix thoroughly with a food processor, dispense 10 mL into vials, cover with cotton gauze and let dry at RT for 16 h before using. \nNOTE: use this medium immediately after its preparation.\nFor the adult rearing, prepare different working EE2 solutions (10 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM, respectively) in 10% ethanol in water (v/v) and layer 100 µL of each onto the surface of the AM, in order to obtain the desired concentration of the EE2 (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM). For the control use same volume of the solvent alone.\nNOTE: alternatively, add the solution containing the right dilution of the selected EDC to a small amount of AM in a 50 mL conical tube, vortex thoroughly and stratify 1 mL of it onto the surface of the AM vials.\n\t\nCover vials with cotton gauze, allow drying at RT for 12-16 h under gentle agitation and use them immediately. \nNOTE: drying process should be adjusted experimentally because is depending on the ambient humidity.\nFor feeding assay, add both the solution containing the right dilution of the selected EDC (EE2 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM) and a coloring food (e.g., the red dye no. 40 at 1 mg/mL)35 to the CM before solidification, mix strongly with a food processor and then dispense into vials.\n3. Rearing Flies\nUse a robust isogenic strain, such as Oregon R, maintained by several generation in the laboratory.",
    "Keep flies in a humidified, temperature-controlled incubator, with a natural 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod at 25 °C in vials containing CM food.\nIn each assay, use vials at RT.\n4. Feeding Assay\nNOTE: This assay is recommended to test if the presence of the selected EDC in the medium could affect feeding of flies.\nPut 15 young flies in vials containing CM supplemented with different concentrations of the selected EDC and a coloring food. Allow flies to feed on the media for 1 day.\nNOTE:for example, use red dye no. 4035 (1 mg/mL). \nPut 15 young flies in vials containing CM supplemented with the solvent alone and a coloring food for control. Allow flies to feed on the media for 1 day. \nAnesthetize individually each group of flies with ether.\nTransfer flies of each group to a cylindrical glass container (etherizer) with a funnel inserted into the open end, inverting the vial over the funnel and gently tapping the two containers together to make the flies fall into the etherizer. \nNOTE:  The funnel will prevent them from getting out of the etherizer.\nKnock flies down by gently tapping the etherizer on a soft surface, such as a mouse-pad, and quickly replace the funnel with an ether-soaked cotton and gauze plug.\nWait about 1 min until the flies fall to the bottom and stop moving. \nNOTE: do not exceed the time or the flies will die.\nPut immobilized flies under a stereo-microscope and compare the abdominal coloring of each treatment group with respect to the control group. \n5. Fecundity/Fertility Assay",
    "For each EDC concentration, prepare 3 vials of flies, thereafter called parental vials, with 8 females and 4 males in 10 mL CM/EDC food; for the control prepare 6 vials of flies with 8 females and 4 males in 10 mL CM food supplemented with solvent. Rear flies in an incubator at 25 °C. \nNOTE: avoid overcrowding larvae during their development and try to use consistent larval densities across treatments.\nAfter 4 days, remove parents and return the vials into the incubator for 5 more days.\nIn the late afternoon of the day 9, remove all newly flies from the vials and put the vials in an incubator at 18 °C overnight. \nNOTE: This removal must be done very carefully, checking the surface of the medium well.\n\t\nOn the morning of day 10, for each treatment group, collect virgin females and young males into two groups, under light CO2 anesthetization. Randomly subdivide each group of flies in small subgroups (10 females and 20 males per vial) in independent vials filled with fresh corresponding CM. \n\t\t\nRepeat step 5.3.1 taking care both to carefully remove all flies from the vials 8-10 h before collection and leave vials at 18 °C, until obtain at least 30 virgin females and 30 males for each EDC concentrations and at least 90 virgin females and 90 males for the control. \nHouse these groups of flies at 25 °C until they are aged 4 days post-eclosion, transferring them into new vials containing fresh corresponding medium every two days.  \n\t\tNote: 4 days is sufficient time for the flies to become mature adults, but it is very far from the beginning of the senescence.",
    "After two days ensure there are no larvae in the vials of females. If they do, the flies are not usable because they are not virgins and must be discarded.\nUse 20 single flies of each sex for each treatment group to set up 20 single crosses into small vials containing fresh CM-tomato medium without EDC, as described below. \nTo each treatment group assign a different series of sequential numbers, which uniquely identifies it and label the respective vials; e.g., group1 (solvent alone) from 1 to 20, group 2 (EDC concentration x) from 20 to 40, and so on.\nMake a fertility spreadsheet to record the different series, each corresponding to a treatment group.\nFor each sex anesthetize all the flies belonging to each treatment group under light CO2 and randomly transfer them as follows.\n\t\t\nTransfer one solvent-treated female into a small vial containing fresh CM-tomato medium without EDC and add one solvent-treated male for the control cross. \n\t\t\t​Note: tomato juice should be added to medium during its preparation because dark medium increases the contrast with the white embryos.\nTransfer one EDC treated female into a small vial containing fresh CM-tomato without EDC and add one solvent-treated male for each treatment.\nTransfer one EDC treated male into a small vial containing fresh CM-tomato medium without EDC and add one solvent-treated female for each treatment.\nHouse all these single crosses at 25°C.\nTransfer each mating pair into fresh CM-tomato vials without EDC every day for the subsequent ten days. Label the replicated vials of each series sequentially; e.g. 1-a, 1b, 1c……20a, 20b, 20c and report these number on the fertility spreadsheet. \nVisually inspect each vial every day for the eggs and report their number on the fertility spreadsheet.",
    "Save each vial and, when newly flies start to emerge, also record the daily number of adult progenies over the 10 day period. After 10 days from the initial mating, remove parents. \nNOTE: discard vial in which one or both parents died; in case of escape of one or both the parents, include in the analysis all data until the day them was lost.\nSum the daily number of eggs and the daily number of adult progenies from each treatment group, to obtain the total fecundity/fertility, the mean egg and adult progeny production by a fly for ten days, and the ratio of total progeny to total number of eggs laid. Calculate the differences in percentage of each treatment values with respect to the control. \nCarry out three independent experiments for each group of flies, by using a minimum of 10 flies for each treatment group. \nPerform statistical analysis to compare the different groups. \n6. Developmental Timing\nNOTE: In the two following alternative protocols the developmental timing is evaluated by counting both the number of pupae that form per day and the number of adult progeny eclosing per day.\nEclosion assay protocol 1\nFor each treatment group, set up 10 vials of young (<2 days), healthy flies, each with 6 females and 3 males in 10 mL cornmeal food without EDC.\nLet flies on food for 24 h, and allow them to mate.\nPrepare 10 parallel vials per treatment group with 10 mL each of fresh cornmeal food supplemented with different EDC concentrations or the solvent alone for the control. Transfer mated flies to these new vials. \nNOTE: for each treatment group assign a different series of sequential numbers, which uniquely identifies it and label the respective vials.\nMake a developmental spreadsheet to record the different series.",
    "Allow flies to lay eggs for 16 h. Then remove parents from vials. \nNOTE: The parent flies can be used to repeat the step 6.1.5, by transferring them to other corresponding vials.\nIncubate vials for 3-4 days at 25 °C, or until no more pupae form. Every day count the number of newly pupae in each vial and report it on the developmental spreadsheet. To avoid counting the same pupa twice, write a number in sequence at each pupa with a permanent marker on the outside of the vial. \nStarting from the day 9, count daily the number of emerging adults until no more adults emerged, and report it on the developmental spreadsheet.\nFrom these raw data, calculate the mean larval period, the mean pupal period, as well as the differences in percentage of each treatment with respect to the control. \nCarry out three independent experiments for each group of flies, by using a minimum of 5 vials for each treatment group.\nPerform statistical analysis to compare the different groups. \nEclosion assay protocol 2\nRear young and healthy female (about 150) and male (about 50) flies on a collection cage (Table of Materials) with agar-tomato medium supplemented with fresh baker’s yeast paste (3 g of baker’s yeast in 5 mL of water), thereafter called laying tray, for 2 days at 25 °C.\nDuring these 2 days, allow flies to acclimate to the cage in a dark, quiet place, before beginning egg collection, and change the laying tray twice a day.\nOn the third day, change the laying tray early in the morning. After 1 h, replace the laying tray, discarding these laid eggs. \nAllow flies to lay eggs for 2 h and replace with fresh laying tray.",
    "NOTE: By day 3, a good laying tray should produce 100-200 eggs in 2 h. \nFor each treatment group, prepare a series of three 60 mm dishes containing tomato cornmeal food supplemented with the corresponding EDC concentration or with solvent alone and report each series in the developmental timing spreadsheet. Alternatively, if preferred, use vials instead of dishes.\nGently pick up eggs under a microscope by using a paintbrush or a probe and transfer them to the top of the medium in each dish/vial. In order to facilitate counting, on the laying tray, arrange eggs in 5 groups of 10 each and transfer them one at a time. \nNOTE: Repeat step 6.2.4 as many times as is necessary to obtain enough embryos.\nHouse all these dishes/vials at 25 °C. Store also each laying tray at 25 °C, and count the total number of laid eggs.\nAfter 24-30 h, check each dish/vial under a stereomicroscope and count both the number of white, unfertilized eggs and the number of dark dead embryos. \nSubtract the number of white, unfertilized eggs from the 50 transferred eggs value in order to obtain the ‘total embryos’ value per dish/vial. The number of dark dead embryos can be used to determine potential EDC toxic effects during embryogenesis.\nRepeat steps 6.1.6-6.1.10 of the Eclosion assay Protocol 1.\n7. Lifespan Protocol\nSet up 20 vials of flies with 8 females and 4 males and house at 25 °C in CM (10 mL each). \nAfter 4 days discard flies and place vials back in the incubator. \nNOTE: these flies can be used to start again to obtain other age-synchronized cohorts of the flies. \nIn the late afternoon of the day 9, remove all newly flies from the vials and return vials to the incubator.",
    "Note: a few adults should begin to eclose as early as the ninth day; discarding these flies allows to collect a maximum number of synchronized flies, avoiding the careless selection of early emergent. \n16-24 h later, transfer the adult flies (1 day old) of both sexes into four groups of 250 mL bottles containing AM food supplemented with three different EDC concentrations and one with the solvent alone. If needed, collect another batch the next day.\nMaintain flies at 25 °C for 2-3 days to allow them to mate. \nNOTE: the day of transfer to AM food vials corresponds to the first day of adulthood.\nAfter two-three days, sort each cohort of flies by sex into two groups under light CO2 anesthetization. Randomly subdivide each sex into five vials per treatment at a density of 20 individuals per vial, until there are three replicates of 5 parallel vials for each gender per each treatment.\nNOTE: Work with small groups of flies in order to prevent possible long-lasting health issues due to long exposure time to CO2.\nPrepare a lifespan spreadsheet in which the number of dead flies is subtracted from the number of surviving flies to the previous transfer, in such a way as to automatically obtain the number of survivors at each transfer.\nTransfer flies into new vials containing the corresponding food every 3 days at the same time and check for death.\nNOTE: the transfer must take place without anesthesia that could have a long-term negative effect on fly longevity.\n\t\nAt each transfer, record the age of the flies and the number of dead flies.",
    "NOTE: the number of surviving flies is automatically calculated in the spreadsheet but it is recommended to check it visually. Flies that accidentally both escape or die during the transfer should not be considered. Be careful not to count twice dead flies carried to the new vial reporting this note in the spreadsheet.\nRepeat steps 7.8 and 7.8.1 until all flies die.\nFor each treatment group, create a survival curve as shown in Figure 6, in order to display the survival probability of a fly at any particular time. \nPerform three independent experiments for each treatment group of flies, by using 100 newly eclosed flies for each experiment. \nPrepare a table in which to report the mean lifespan (mean survival days of all flies for each group), the half death time (period of time in days required to reach 50% mortality) and the maximum lifespan (maximum amount of days needed to reach 90% mortality). \nCalculate the differences in percentage between each treatment group with respect to the control group. \nPerform statistical analysis to compare the  different treatment groups.\nSubscription Required.
