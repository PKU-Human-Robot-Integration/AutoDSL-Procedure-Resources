    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nIsolation of Mouse Vaginal Epithelial Cells\nTiming: 2 days\nSacrifice mice according to the protocol, approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee, and harvest the vaginal tissue.\nPlace the tissue into a sterile 10-cm culture dish containing 5 mL ice-cold DPBS. With the help of scissors and pointed forceps remove any fat and blood vessels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/163-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the Procedure for the Isolation of Mouse Vaginal Epithelium\n(A) A representative image of a freshly harvested mouse vagina after removing fat and associated blood vessels.\n(B) Cutting open the vagina.\n(C) Slit open the vagina before proceeding with the enzymatic dissociation.\n(D) Vaginal tissue post-enzymatic digestion. Arrow points to the separated vaginal epithelial sheet after enzymatic digestion.\nScale bar, 1 mm.\nTransfer the tissue to another sterile 10-cm culture dish containing fresh ice-cold DPBS and rinse thoroughly. Using small scissors, slit open the vaginal tube exposing the epithelial lining for enzymatic digestion (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nIncubate the tissue in enzyme solution (1 mL/vagina) containing 1 mg/mL pronase and 0.5 mg/mL DNaseI for 16 h at 4°C with mild rocking/shaking.\nNote: Use a 2 mL Eppendorf tube as it is important to have a wide bottom tube for efficient digestion.\nThe next day, following the digestion step, gently scrape off the epithelium from the underlying mesenchymal tissue using fine forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nTransfer the isolated epithelium into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 5 mL of ice cold ECI medium.\nDisrupt the epithelial cell sheet by gently vortexing the tube for 1 min.\nAlternatives: Pipette up and down approximately 50 times with a P1000 pipette to disrupt the epithelium.\nPellet down the epithelial cells by centrifuging the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Aspirate and discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh ECI medium.\nRepeat steps 8 and 9 two more times.\nPass the cell suspension through a 40 μM cell strainer to remove any undigested tissue or cell clumps.\nCollect the filtrate and pellet down the cells again by centrifuging the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in ECI medium.\nUse hemocytometer to assess the cell number and cell viability. It is recommended not to proceed further with the protocol if the number is lower than 15,000–20,000 cells or the cell viability is lower than 80%–90%.\nBefore proceeding with plating wash the cells with organoid culture medium in order to remove any traces of FBS.\nCulture of Mouse Vaginal Organoids\nTiming: 2 weeks\nPellet down the cell suspension by centrifuging the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C from step 15 and resuspend in ice cold BME at a final concentration of 20,000 cells per 50 μL of BME.\nPlate a 50 μL BME drop (containing 20,000 cells) in the center of a pre-warmed 24-well culture plate avoiding any bubbles.\nCritical: It is important that the cells are mixed with BME slowly and carefully so that no bubbles are introduced as it will affect the growth of organoids.\nCritical: BME should be handled on ice at all times and plating should be done as quickly as possible so that it does not solidify\nIncubate the 24-well culture plate upside down in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 30 min to allow the BME to solidify.\nCritical: The plate should be placed upside down to prevent cell adherence to the plate bottom.",
    "Once the BME is solidified, add 500 μL of pre-warmed organoid culture medium in each well, and return the plate to CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nReplace the medium every 2 days. Organoid culture medium is supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 for only the first 3 days of culture.\nCheck the organoid growth under a light microscope. After 4–6 days in culture, small organoids should appear (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/163-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Timeline of Organoid Development from a Single Mouse Vaginal Epithelial Cell\n(A) Day 1.\n(B) Day 4.\n(C) Day 14.\nScale bar, 250 μm.\nPassaging of Mouse Vaginal Organoids\nTiming: 10 days\nOrganoids can be passaged 10 days after seeding. Prepare all the reagents before proceeding with the experiment. Thaw BME on ice and pre-warm 24-well plates at 37°C.\nTo begin with, remove culture medium and add 1 mL of ice-cold DPBS to each well. Break the BME and dissociate the organoids by gentle pipetting up and down approximately 20 times using a P1000 pipette.\nTransfer the organoid suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nIncubate the pelleted organoids with 0.5 mL of TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Using a P1000 pipette, gently pipette the suspension up and down for 5–10 times to yield a single cell suspension.\nCritical: The organoid dissociation should be carried out gently to avoid cell death.\nNote: Pipetting organoids after TrypLE treatment will result in a single cell suspension. However, some cell clumps might still remain which can either be removed by passing the suspension through a cell strainer or can be plated as such.\nAdd 10 mL of ECI medium to the cell suspension in order to stop the activity of TrypLE.",
    "Pellet down the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in organoid culture medium and centrifuge again.\nResuspend the pellet in 150 μL of BME. Plate 50 μL drops into the center of each well of a pre-warmed 24-well culture plate, thus splitting each organoid culture at a ratio of 1:3.\nPlace the 24-well plate upside down in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 30 min to allow the BME to solidify.\nOnce solidified, add 500 μL of pre-warmed organoid culture medium into each well and return the plate into the incubator. Replace the medium every 2 days. Remember to supplement the organoid culture medium with 10 μM Y-27632 for only the first 3 days of culture.\nCryopreservation of Mouse Vaginal Organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nAfter 14 days of culture, aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of ice-cold DPBS into each well of the 24-well culture plate to break the BME.\nOnce dissolved, transfer the organoid suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube. Centrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and trypsinize the organoids by adding 0.5 mL of TrypLE to the pellet. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nUsing P1000 pipette, gently pipette the organoids up and down for 15–20 times to yield a single cell suspension.\nAdd 10 mL of ECI medium to the suspension in order to stop the activity of TrypLE.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of freezing medium containing 40% FBS and 10% DMSO with 1% Pen/Strep. Aliquot the suspension into cryovials.",
    "Note: 1 mL of freezing medium is sufficient to freeze 1 well of a 24 well plate with approx. 1000 organoids.\nTransfer the cryovials into a freezing container filled with 250 mL of isopropanol. Transfer the container to −80°C for 24 h, after which the cryovials need to be stored in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nCritical: It is not recommended to leave and/or store cells at −80°C for more than 24 h.\nRevival of Mouse Vaginal Organoids\nTiming: 1 h\nRetrieve and thaw the cryovial containing the frozen cells by briefly placing the cryovial in a 37°C water bath.\nCritical: It is recommended that the organoids are not completely thawed at 37°C but only about 50%. Rest of thawing should happen at 20°C–22°C while preparing for next step of the protocol. Over-warming the medium may affect the growth efficiency of the organoids in culture, resulting in poor revival and more cell death.\nWhen thawed, immediately transfer the contents of the cryovial into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nSlowly add 10 mL ECI medium to the Falcon tube containing the cell suspension.\nPellet down the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTo remove the freezing medium completely, wash the cell pellet in ECI medium.\nCentrifuge again at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells with vaginal organoid culture medium.\nPlate the cells as described in steps 16–18.\nNote: 1 vial of cells can be used to plate 3 wells of 24 well plate.\nOnce the BME is solidified, add 500 μL of pre-warmed organoid culture medium in each well, and return the plate to the CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).",
    "Replace the medium every 2 days. Organoid culture medium is supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 for only the first 3 days of culture.\nCheck organoid growth under a light microscope (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/163-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Vaginal Organoids Derived from Cells Stored in Liquid Nitrogen\n(A) Day 1.\n(B) Day 14.\nScale bar, 500 μm.\nProcessing of Vaginal Organoids for Immunofluorescence Staining\nTiming: 1 day\nAfter 14 days in culture, remove culture medium and add 1 mL of ice-cold DPBS to each well. Break the BME and harvest the organoids in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Proceed with their fixation, paraffin embedding and immunofluorescence staining as follows:\nNote: All the organoids will not be released from BME at once. Cut the P200 pipette tip so that the barrel is large enough to suck up the organoids without breaking them and small enough to help break the BME and release the organoids.\nFix the organoids in 4% PFA in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube at 20°C–22°C for 30 min.\nAllow the organoids to settle down at the bottom of the tube. Discard the PFA as supernatant and wash the organoids in PBS twice.\nNote: During the washing steps, organoids should not be centrifuged as it will result in clumping. They should be allowed to settle under gravity for 1 min.\nPause Point: If not using immediately, organoids can be stored at 4°C for 7 days in PBS.\nBefore proceeding with the paraffin embedding, organoids are encapsulated in Histogel specimen processing gel. Warm the Histogel in a 65°C water bath for 1–2 h until it liquifies.\nNote: Make sure that the Histogel is maintained at 65°C all the time, as it will solidify at lower temperature.",
    "Coat the bottom of a cryomold (15 x 15 x 5 mm) with a layer of Histogel by adding 200 μL per cryomold and gently spreading it with a pipette tip. Place the cryomold on ice for 5–10 min to allow the Histogel to solidify.\nGently place the organoids into the Histogel coated cryomold using a cut P200 pipette tip. Use Kimwipes to soak up as much PBS as possible, and make sure that the organoids lie in the center of the cryomold.\nNote: Before adding the second layer of Histogel onto the organoids, use Kimwipes to remove excess PBS otherwise it may result in the shrinkage of Histogel during processing\nGently add 200 μL of Histogel into the cryomold so that the organoids are sandwiched between the two layers of the Histogel.\nReturn the cryomold to ice for 20 min until the Histogel is completely solidified.\nGently remove the solidified Histogel containing the embedded organoids from the mold and transfer it into a tissue cassette for further processing.\nProceed with the standard paraffin embedding process by passing the cassettes through a gradient of 70%, 80% and 95% ethanol for 1 h each, followed by two changes of 100% ethanol for 1 h each and two changes of xylene for 1 h each. Finally, the cassettes are incubated in molten paraffin wax for 2 h, before the Histogel sandwiches, containing organoids are embedded into a paraffin block.\nFor immunofluorescence staining, sections are cut at 4 μm thickness using a microtome."
