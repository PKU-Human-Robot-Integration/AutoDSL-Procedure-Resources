    "The protocol was approved by the research ethics committee of our institution.\n1. Plasma Sample Collection\nCollect 10 mL of whole blood sample in Vacutainer tubes with spray-coated K2EDTA and store at room temperature.\n\tNote: To minimize the hemolysis, separate plasma within 2 h. Do not store the whole blood at low temperature (i.e., 4 °C) to avoid thermal shock and cell lysis that lead to an unspecific miRNA release.\nWithin 1 h, separate the plasma by a first centrifugation step at 1,258 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.\nTransfer the plasma supernatant into a 15 mL tube, carefully avoiding contact with the lymphocytic ring.\nCentrifuge the plasma a second time at 1,258 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.\nAliquot 1 mL of plasma into 1.5 mL cryovials, avoiding collecting the plasma fraction at the base of the tube.\nStore all the aliquots at −80 °C, except one for the evaluation of the hemolysis. The molecular analysis should be performed within 5 weeks.\n2. Evaluation of Hemolysis by Spectrophotometric Measurement\nImmediately after the plasma separation step, in a cuvette for spectrophotometry, make a 1:10 dilution of the plasma sample in 1X PBS (e.g., 100 µL of plasma in 900 µL of 1X PBS) and mix to homogenize it.\n\tNote: The plasma sample should not be frozen before the spectrophotometric measurements, as the freeze-thawing of the sample (and in particular in lipemic samples), could form flocculates that interfere with the spectrophotometric analysis.\nRead the absorbance at 375 nm, 414 nm, 541 nm, and 576 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, with a baseline correction settled at 750 nm and a path length of 10 mm. Perform a blank measurement using 1 mL of 1x PBS.",
    "Calculate the ratio between the absorbance at 414 nm and 375 nm; if higher than 1.4, consider the sample hemolyzed and repeat the blood withdrawal (QC1 in Table 1).\n3. Plasma Total RNA Extraction\nPrepare a 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization (OMG) solution with 20 µL of 1-Thioglycerol per mL of Homogenization Solution. Since 1-Thioglycerol is viscous, carefully pipette for accurate measurement. Chill the OMG Solution on ice or at 2-10 °C before using it.\n\tNOTE: The working solution is stable at 2-10 °C for 1 month.\nSuspend the lyophilized DNase I by adding 275 µL of nuclease-free water into the vial and gently mix (do not vortex). As a visual aid, add 5 µL of blue dye to the reconstituted DNase I and dispense the solution into single-use aliquots in nuclease-free tubes. Store reconstituted DNase I at -30 °C to -10 °C.\nStarting from 200 µL of plasma, add 200 µL of the chilled OMG solution.\nVortex 15-30 s to ensure a complete homogenization. If foaming occurs, let the sample settle on ice.\nAdd 200 µL of Lysis Buffer and 25 µL of Proteinase K to the homogenized sample and vortex for 20 s.\nIncubate the samples for 15 min in a thermomixer preheated at 37 °C.\nLoad a cartridge for each sample on the deck tray of the instrument and place the plugger in the proper position.\nTransfer the lysate to the appropriate position in the instrument cartridge.\nAdd 5 µL of DNase I solution to the proper position in the cartridge.\nAdd 60 µL of nuclease-free water to the base of each elution tube.\nSelect the \"RSC miRNA Tissue\" method and begin the automated purification run. The total RNA samples can be stored at −80 °C.\n4. Taq-based RT",
    "Use the Taq RT Primer Pool with the miRNAs of interest to convert the RNA to cDNA with the Taq MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit.\nPrepare 12 µL of RT reaction mix on ice in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube according to the kit instructions, using 6 µL of the custom Taq RT Primer Pool.\nAdd 3 µL of total RNA for a final volume of 15 µL and incubate in ice for 5 min.\nLoad the RT reaction on a thermo-cycler configured as follows: 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, 85 °C for 5 min, and hold at 4 °C.\n\tNote: The cDNA can be store at -15 to -20 °C for at least one week.\n5. Pre-amplification\nMix 2.5 µL of each RT product with 12.5 µL of Taq Master Mix 2x, 3.75 µL Custom Taq pool, and 6.25 µL nuclease-free water, for a total volume of 25 µL.\nPerform the pre-amplification reaction using a thermo-cycler according to the following thermal profile: 95 °C for 10 min, 55 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min, 12 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 4 min, then hold at 99.9 °C for 10 min and at 4 °C.\nDilute the product by adding 175 µL of 0.1X TE, pH 8.0.\n\tNote: The diluted product can be store at -15 to -20 °C for at least one week.\n6. RT-qPCR Reaction on Custom Taq Array MicroRNA Cards",
    "Use the 384-well microfluidicCustom Taq Array MicroRNA Card to measure plasma levels of the 24 specific miRNAs (spotted in duplicate) on 8 samples simultaneously. MiRBase ID (v21) for the 24 miRNAs are: hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-148b-3p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-197-3p, hsa-miR-19b-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-28-3p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-451a, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsa-miR-660-5p, and hsa-miR-92a-3p.\nMix 1.13 µL of the diluted PreAmp sample with 56.25 µL of 2X Taq Universal Master Mix and 55.69 µL of nuclease-free water in a 0.5 mL tube.\nLoad up to 8 PCR reaction mix on the Custom Taq Array MicroRNA Cards.\nCentrifuge at 311 x g for 2 min.\nSeal the custom card with the array card sealer.\nRun the Real-Time reaction using a Real-Time PCR System modifying the cycling parameters as followed: 94.5 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 97 °C for 30 s, and 59.7 °C for 60 s.\n7. Data Extrapolation and Ratios Generation\nUse the software to obtain raw Ct values, setting an automatic baseline to remove the background signals and a fixed threshold of 0.15 for all assays and samples. Remove spots with poor amplification curves and/or poor passive reference signals.\nExport raw Ct values in \".xls\" format and use the Ct Mean value of the two duplicates for further analysis.\nCorrelate miRNAs' expression levels to historic measurements on clinical study samples (Table 2). If at least 50% of samples on each custom made microfluidic card result in a Pearson's correlation < 97.5, repeat the card (QC2 in Table 1).\nCalculate the −ΔCts between all miRNAs, equivalent to the log2 values of the miRNA ratios.\n8. Evaluation of Hemolysis by the Related miRNA Signature",
    "Generate the hemolysis-related miRNA signature using the following miRNA ratios with respective cut-offs (log2 values) for short storage plasma samples (1-5 weeks at −80 °C): miR-126/451 < −0.07, 15b/451 < −3.67, 221/451 < −3.18, 30b/451 < −1.1, 126/486-5p < −0.33, 15b/486-5p < −3.86, 221/486-5 p < −3.17, 30b/486-5p < −1.42, 126/92a < 1.8, 15b/92a < −1.8, 221/92a < −1.04, 30b/92a < 0.87, 126/16 < −2.85, 15b/16 < −6.33, 221/16 < −5.9, 30b/16 < −3.68.\nClassify as hemolyzed samples where at least 50% of ratios (8 out of 16) exceed respective cut-off (QC3 in Table 1).\n9. Definition of the Level of Risk: High, Intermediate, and Low\nDefine the four signatures of miRNA ratios composing the MSC as reported in Figure 3: risk of disease (RD), risk of aggressive disease (RAD), presence of disease (PD), and presence of aggressive disease (PAD).\nFor each signature, define the ratios exceeding the respective cut-off value for short storage plasma samples (1-5 weeks at −80 °C). The number of exceeding ratios needed to be considered positive is 9 out of 27 for RD and PD, and 14 out of 28 for RAD and PAD (Figure 3A).\nAttribute to each sample the respective MSC risk level as follows: low risk if RDneg ∩ PDneg ∩ RADneg ∩ PADneg; intermediate risk if RDpos ∪PDpos ∩ RADneg ∩ PADneg; or high risk if RADpos ∪ PADpos (Figure 3B)."
