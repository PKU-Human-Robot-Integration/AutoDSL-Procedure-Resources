    "Cell suspension preparation and maintenanceThe protocol described here uses Nicotiana tabacum cultivar Bright Yellow 2 (BY-2) cell suspensions, which are established from in vitro-induced calli (Figure 1A). The BY-2 cell line was produced from tobacco seedlings by Kato et al. in 1972 (Kato et al.,1972) and has since been propagated and shared among plant scientists (Nagata et al., 1992). BY-2 cells are currently used as models in a number of experimental systems and are available from various research groups.To generate a suspension of plant cells, transfer approximately 1 ml of calli to a sterile 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml of MES/Phosphate-buffered culture medium (Recipe 8) using a sterile spatula or inoculation loop (in the flow hood). Be gentle to avoid unnecessary mechanical stress to the calli. In order to prevent contamination, work carefully and orderly at the flow hood. Incubate at 27 °C in the dark and under gentle agitation (100-120 rpm) in an orbital shaker. The calli will release small cell aggregates that will eventually result in a cell suspension.After 10-14 days, transfer 5 ml of the resulting cell suspension using a 10 ml tipless serological pipette to a sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 45 ml of subculturing medium (Recipe 9). Incubate at 27 °C in the dark and under gentle agitation (100-120 rpm) in an orbital shaker.After 7 days, repeat the subculturing as described in Step A2. At this point, the newly established cell suspension should be similar to the one shown in Figures 1B-1C. Inspect an aliquot of the suspension under the microscope to ensure that it is free from contaminants.For regular maintenance of BY-2 cell suspensions, subculture the cells weekly as described in Step A2.",
    "It is advisable to routinely keep two or three independent flasks of cell suspensions to prevent culture loss due to contamination.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413120046_7785.jpgFigure 1.

C. A 7-day-old cell suspension. Note the pale-yellow color indicating saturation.MAMP treatment and measurement of medium alkalinizationOnce established cell suspensions are available (as described in the previous section), MAMP-triggered medium alkalinization can be accessed. Aliquots of cell suspension are individually treated with MAMPs and probed for response (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200413/20200413120217_4333.jpgFigure 2. Experimental setup for medium alkalinization measurement. A 12-well microplate containing 2.5 ml of cell suspensions in each well is kept under gentle agitation on an orbital shaker. The pH sensor is inserted so that the probe is completely submerged and does not touch the walls.Carefully transfer a 3- to 5-day-old cell suspension to a 12-well plate (2.5 ml per well) using a 10 ml tipless serological pipette. The cell cultures to be used should be similar to the ones shown in Figure 1C, with a pale-yellow coloration. Dark yellow or brownish colored suspensions are typically stressed and should not be used.Note: One key factor that affects the medium alkalinization assay is the age of the cell suspension. In our experiments with BY-2 cells, we used 3- to 5-day-old suspensions. However, the optimum age may vary from lab to lab and therefore needs to be determined experimentally. Incubate the plate for at least 2 h and up to 4 h at room temperature and under gentle agitation in an orbital shaker (typically 100-200 rpm; the speed should be just enough to keep the cells in suspension).",
    "This step allows the cells to recover from stresses caused by the transference to the plate.Before starting the measurements, adjust the pH meter settings appropriately: measurement resolution of 0.001, endpoint format set as manual and timed interval readings of 3 s. Calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using calibration standard solutions.Open the EasyDirectTM pH Software on a computer connected to the pH meter and set the export option to Excel. An Excel sheet will automatically be opened.Keeping the plate under agitation on the orbital shaker (100-200 rpm), insert the sensor in one well, carefully adjusting the position to ensure that the sensor is sufficiently inserted (colored tip submerged) and is not touching the walls or the bottom of the well.Press the Start button on the pH meter. The instrument will start recording the pH values in the Excel sheet.Once the measurements become stable (same value for at least 12 s), add 25 μl of 1 µM NAG6 (Recipe 1) (final concentration: 10 nM) or 25 μl of 10 µM flg22 (Recipe 2) (final concentration: 100 nM) to the well. To avoid artefactual changes in pH, equilibrate the elicitors to room temperature for 10 min before adding to the cell suspension. Make sure that each plate includes at least one well treated with elicitor solvent (H2O) as non-elicited control.Record the pH values for 10 min for NAG6 and 60 min for flg22.After the measurement is complete, remove the sensor from the well, wash thoroughly with ultrapure water and dry using tissue paper.Repeat Steps B5-B9 until all samples included in the experiment have been tested."
