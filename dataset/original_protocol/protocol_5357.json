    "Target site selection and oligo design for sgRNA expression   Nuclease cleavage site selection will be dependent on gene editing objective. For gene knockout, it is recommended to select cleavage sites in the first two coding exons or in protein functional domains. For gene correction or homologous recombination (HR), the cleavage site should be as close as possible to the nucleotide to be changed or to the target integration site to maximize the efficiency. For cytidine deamination-based editing, the nicking site will be dependent on the cytidine deamination window.   Select a proximal dCas9 binding site upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. The dCas9 binding sites each must be separated from the nuclease binding site by about 10 bp to avoid potential steric hindrance, but beyond the 10 bp separation the dCas9 binding sites also should be kept as close as possible to the nuclease binding site to maximize the effects. The dCas9 binding sites can be on either strand of the DNA.   One of the advantages of CRISPR-Cas effector nucleases over previous generations of programmable nucleases as genome editing tools is the simplicity of nuclease retargeting via straightforward oligo design and sgRNA expression plasmid cloning once target sites are selected. In this illustrative experiment, the two SpdCas9 proximal binding sites are: 5’-CCAAGGGTGAGGCCGGGAAGCGG-3’, and 5’-CAAGGTGTACATGGGGGAGATGG-3’; and the CjCas9 binding site is: 5’-TTCGCCAGTACGAGCTTGTGGTCCACAC-3’; where the underlined nucleotides are protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs).",
    "Therefore, the DNA oligo sequences for sgRNA expression plasmid cloning are: forward 5’-ACCGCCAAGGGTGAGGCCGGGAAG-3’ and reverse 5’-AAACCTTCCCGGCCTCACCCTTGG-3’ for SpdCas9 binding site 1; forward 5’-ACCGCAAGGTGTACATGGGGGAGA-3’ and reverse 5’-AAACTCTCCCCCATGTACACCTTG-3’ for SpdCas9 binding site 2; and forward 5’-ACCGTTCGCCAGTACGAGCTTGTG-3’ and reverse 5’-AAACCACAAGCTCGTACTGGCGAA-3’ for the CjCas9 binding site; where the underlined nucleotides in the forward sequences are a constant overhang for ligation to a human U6 promoter and the underlined nucleotides in the reverse sequences are a constant overhang for ligation to a SpdCas9 sgRNA scaffold or a CjCas9 sgRNA scaffold in cloning vectors.      Transfection and gene editing analysis   Culture K562 cells in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Maintain the culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Split the culture every 2-3 days or when the culture reaches 1-2 million cells per ml by transferring 1/10 or 1/5 of the culture to a new culture flask containing fresh medium pre-warmed to 37 °C to make a 1:10 or a 1:5 split (see Note 1).    Split the culture to 0.25 million cells per ml one day before transfection. The culture will reach about 0.5 million cells per ml for transfection the next day (see Note 1).   Prepare three plasmid DNA solutions for transfection in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (see Note 2):    5 µg of SpdCas9 plasmid DNA, 4.2 µg of CjCas9 plasmid DNA, 3 µg each of the two SpdCas9 sgRNA plasmid constructs and the CjCas9 sgRNA plasmid construct, and 1.5 µl of 200 µM of single stranded DNA oligo donor.   4.2 µg of CjCas9 plasmid DNA, 3 µg of the CjCas9 sgRNA plasmid construct, and 1.5 µl of 200 µM of single stranded DNA oligo donor as no proximal dCas9 targeting control.   1.5 µl of 200 µM of single stranded DNA oligo donor as oligo-only control.",
    "Keep the tubes on ice before transfection.    Add 2 ml of fresh culture medium to each well of a 6-well plate and equilibrate the medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 20 min before transfection.   Set the Nucleofector program to T-016 (see Note 3). Unseal the cuvettes and disposable transfer pipettes and place them inside a cell culture hood.   Count the cells with a glass hemocytometer:    Clean the hemocytometer and coverslip with alcohol before use.   Gently swirl the flask to make sure the cells are evenly distributed. Take 10 ul of cells and add to the chamber under the coverslip. Cells will be drawn out by capillary action and spread evenly on the hemocytometer.   Count the cells with 10x objective under a microscope. Using a hand tally counter, count the cells in all four corner squares with 16 smaller squares. Only count the cells within a square or on the right-hand or bottom boundary line.    Average the total number by four and then multiply by 10,000 (104). This will be the number of cells per ml in the culture.    Transfer the required amount of cells to a sterile 50-ml conical centrifuge tube. Each transfection reaction will require 1.0 million cells (see Note 4). Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Carefully remove the culture medium by aspiration.   Resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of Hank’s balanced salt solution. Centrifuge at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min and carefully remove the wash fluid by aspiration. Gently re-suspend the cell pellet in nucleofection solution V to 1.0 million cells per 100 µl (see Note 5).   Pipette 100 µl of the cells into a 1.",
    "5-ml tube containing a plasmid DNA solution and mix thoroughly but gently by pipetting up and down 3-5 times. Transfer the whole content to a nucleofection cuvette and perform the transfection immediately using the T-016 program.   Add a pipette full of pre-equilibrated culture medium to the transfected cells inside the cuvette with a disposable transfer pipette and immediately transfer the whole content into a well containing pre-equilibrated culture medium. Culture the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 immediately after nucleofection.   Extract genomic DNA 3 days after transfection using GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit. PCR amplify the POR genomic region using JumpStart Taq ReadyMix with the forward primer 5’-CTCCCCTGCTTCTTGTCGTAT-3’ and the reverse primer 5’-ACAGGTCGTGGACACTCACA-3’ and the following cycling condition: 98 °C for 2 min for initial denaturation; 34 cycles of 98 °C for 15 sec, 62 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 45 sec; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.    Purify PCR products with GenElute PCR Clean-Up Kit. Digest purified PCR products (about 500 ng per digestion) with EcoRI (20 U) at 37 °C for 2 h. Resolve digestion products on a pre-cast 10% acrylamide gel from Bio-Rad Laboratories using DirectLoad Wide Range DNA Marker as markers.
