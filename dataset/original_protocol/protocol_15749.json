    "Animal experiments were approved by UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals. Adult C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-30 g was used in this study. The von Frey assessment was performed between 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm.\n1. Anesthesia and mouse preparation\nPlace a mouse in a plastic chamber filled with 2% isoflurane in O2 at a flow rate of 1.0 L/min until it is fully anesthetized.\nCover the eyes with ophthalmic ointment using a cotton-wool applicator.\nPlace the snout of the mouse into a flexible nose cone with 2% isoflurane flow throughout the surgical procedure.\nPlace the mouse in a right lateral position. Keep the left leg up with knee flexion and secure it with adhesive tape.\nRemove the hair around the thigh and knee area with an electric shaver and disinfect the skin with 70% alcohol.\nEnsure sufficient anesthesia depth before surgery by testing no response to pinch stimulus on the hind limb or tail with tweezers as the standard.\n\t​NOTE: No local anesthetic or NSAID was used before and after performing the SNIt model because local anesthetic and NSAID significantly reduce the neuropathic pain behavior after SNIt.\n2. Modified SNIt surgery\nCut a 1 cm incision starting at the first 1/3 of the horizontal line crossing the knee with an approximately 30° angle from the vertical line with scissors (Figure 2A).\nTwo white lines can be visualized under the biceps femoris muscle (BFM) after separating skin incision, with the medial (cephalad) thick line as the femur and lateral (caudal) thin line as sciatic nerve (Figure 2B).",
    "Blunt dissect BFM along the caudal white line with curved micro forceps and micro scissors to expose the sciatic nerve. Avoid blood vessel damage during blunt dissection. If accidental vessel damage occurs, use sterile cotton-wool swabs to absorb blood and apply proper pressure to stop bleeding.\nDifferentiate the three branches from the sciatic nerve at the superior edge of the gastrocnemius muscle. The tibial nerve is the one with the biggest diameter passing under the gastrocnemius muscle, whereas the sural nerves (lateral, the smallest diameter) and the common peroneal nerve (medial) run above the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 2C and Figure 3A).\nDepending on how BFM is dissected and opened, visualize the common peroneal nerve as lateral (Figure 2C) or medial (Figure 3A) to the tibial nerve.\nSeparate the common peroneal and the sural nerves from the neighboring tissues using curve micro forceps.\nLigate the common peroneal and sural nerves together with a 6-0 suture, as both nerves run above the gastrocnemius muscle, but the tibial nerve passes under the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 2D and Figure 3B,C). Observe the limb for contraction following the tight ligature. For the traditional method, ligate the common peroneal and sural nerves separately.\nCut nerve at a distal part within 2-4 mm of the ligation with a pair of micro scissors. Ensure that the tibial nerve remains untouched during the whole procedure. For the traditional method, cut the common peroneal and sural nerves at the distal part within 2-4 mm of the ligation and remove a 2 mm section, separately.\nClose the muscular layer with a 6-0 silk suture and the skin incision with wound clips.",
    "After surgery, return the mice to the animal room until full recovery from anesthesia. Check daily for intact incisions, normal food intake, water consumption, general body condition, regular movements, and grooming. Remove wound clips 7-14 days after surgery.\n3. von Frey assessment for mechanical threshold\nAcclimatize the mice for 6 days to the testing room environment and testing materials to perform the von-Frey assessment. Place the mice in clear plastic cylinders on an elevated wire mesh grid for 1 h of habituation. Place white papers between each cylinder to prevent any visual cue from each testing animal.\nDuring this period, perform habituation every 2 days, and measure the baseline of von Frey monofilaments under the mid-plantar of the hind paw after the last habituation.\nPerform von Frey assessment with a blind tester. Stimulate the mid-plantar of the hind paw with von Frey filaments by using the up-down paradigm12. Apply the von Frey filament to the plantar surface perpendicularly with applied force to cause slight curling.\nVerify positive responses as sudden paw withdrawal, sudden flinching, or sudden paw licking. Exert the next stimulus at an interval of 5 s to avoid the influence of the previous stimulus.\nConfirm mechanical threshold per paw by taking an average of 3 sessions.\nBased on the 50% hind paw withdrawal threshold decided by the up-down method, use the percent response method with 0.16 g filament to assess the difference further.\nRecord the percentage of the positive responses after 10 stimuli of 0.16 g filament applied to the mid-plantar of the hind paw regardless of the responses.\nPerform the von Frey assessments on pre-surgery day 1, and post-surgery on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14.\n4. Statistical Analysis",
    "Report normally distributed continuous data as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Analyze the continuous data with 2-tailed t-test or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Process all data using statistical analysis software, with statistical significance at the level of p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
