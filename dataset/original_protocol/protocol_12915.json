    "1. Generation of Yeast Strains\nGenerate a yeast strain bearing the factor of interest tagged with MNase.\nPCR amplify the MNase tagging cassette from the desired vector (Table 1) using the specified reaction mixture (Table 2) and cycling conditions (Table 3). Mix 5 µL of the PCR reaction and 1 µL of 6X DNA loading dye. Run each PCR aliquot on a 0.8% agarose gel at 120 V for 40 min. The expected product size is ~2.3 kb.\nTransform the amplified tagging cassette into the strain of choice using standard lithium acetate transformation22 and perform selection.\nVerify correct integration of the tagging cassette with colony PCR.\n\t\t\nPrepare the specified reaction mixture (Table 4) for the number of colonies to be screened. Keep on ice until needed.\nPick a portion of each colony to be tested into the bottom of a PCR tube using a sterile toothpick or pipet tip.\nMicrowave the picked colonies at high power for 1 min.\nAdd 50 µL of PCR mix (Table 4) to each microwaved colony and pipet up and down to mix. Perform PCR using the specified cycling conditions (Table 5).\nMix the 50 µL of PCR reaction and 10 µL of 6X DNA loading dye directly in each PCR tube. Run 10 µL of each sample on a 1% agarose gel at 120 V for 40 min. The expected product size is ~ 700 bp.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If desired, verify appropriate expression of the MNase fusion protein via western blotting. A ~ 20.6 kilodalton shift in the molecular weight of the tagged protein is expected.\nGenerate a free MNase strain by homology-based cloning of the promoter of the gene of interest into pGZ136 (Table 1) and transformation and selection as in step 1.1.2.",
    "Alternatively, assemble the promoter of the gene of interest and 3xFLAG-MNase-SV40 NLS into a plasmid vector, transform and select as in step 1.1.2, and grow the strain in the appropriate selective condition for maintenance of the plasmid.\n2. ChEC\nIn the afternoon/evening of the day prior to the ChEC experiment, inoculate 3 mL yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) or appropriate selective medium with a single colony of the strain bearing the MNase-tagged factor. Incubate this culture overnight (180 RPM shaking, 30 °C).\nIn the morning of the day of the ChEC experiment, dilute the overnight culture into 50 mL of medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2 - 0.3. Incubate this culture (180 RPM shaking, 30 °C) until it reaches an OD600 of 0.5-0.7. As the culture approaches the appropriate OD600, set heat block or water bath to 30 °C and start thawing Buffer A additives (Table 6).\nPrepare 5 mL of Buffer A plus additives (Table 6) per culture. Keep buffer A at RT during the procedure.\nPrepare microfuge tubes containing 90 µL of stop solution (Table 7) and 10 µL of 10% SDS for each time point to be collected. For each new factor analyzed, take samples at 0 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2.5 min, 5 min, and 10 min.\nDecant culture into a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1,500 x g and room temperature (RT) for 1 min.\nThoroughly resuspend cells in 1 mL of Buffer A and transfer the resuspended cells to a microfuge tube. Pellet resuspended cells in a microfuge at 1,500 x g and RT for 30 s.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and thoroughly resuspend cells in 1 mL of Buffer A by pipetting up and down. Pellet resuspended cells in a microfuge at 1,500 x g and RT for 30 s. Repeat this step once.\nThoroughly resuspend cells in 570 µL of Buffer A. Add 30 µL of 2% digitonin (0.1% final concentration) to facilitate permeabilization of the cells, and invert to mix.\nPermeabilize cells in heat block or water bath at 30 °C for 5 min.\nPipet the reaction up and down to ensure an even distribution of cells. Remove a 100 µL aliquot of permeabilized cells as a negative control to a microfuge tube containing stop solution and SDS (step 2.4) and vortex briefly to mix.\nAdd 1.1 µL of 1 M CaCl2 (2 mM final concentration) to permeabilized cells to activate MNase and invert several times quickly or vortex briefly to mix. Immediately return the mixed reaction at 30 °C and start a timer.\nAt each time point to be collected, pipet the reaction up and down to ensure an even distribution of cells, then remove a 100 µL aliquot of permeabilized cells to a microfuge tube containing stop solution and SDS and vortex briefly to mix. For each new factor analyzed, take 0 s (no CaCl2 added), 30 s, 1 min, 2.5 min, 5 min, and 10 min time points.\n\tNOTE: ChEC experiments with factors that rapidly cleave DNA at 30°C may be performed at lower temperatures to slow MNase cleavage kinetics.\nOnce all time points have been collected, add 4 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K to each sample, vortex briefly to mix, and incubate at 55 °C for 30 min.",
    "Add 200 µL of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to each sample, vortex vigorously to mix, and centrifuge at maximum speed and RT in a microfuge for 5 min.\nRemove each aqueous phase (~ 150 µL) to a new tube. Add 30 µg of glycogen and 500 µL of 100% ethanol. Vortex vigorously to mix and precipitate on dry ice for 10 min or until solution is viscous.\nPellet precipitated DNA at maximum speed and 4 °C in a microfuge for 10 min.\nDecant supernatants and wash pellets with 1 mL of RT 70% ethanol.\nDecant ethanol, removing the remainder by inverting and gently tapping the tubes on a paper towel. Briefly spin samples using a benchtop centrifuge and use a pipet to remove residual ethanol, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Air-dry pellets for at RT for 5 min.\nWhile pellets are drying, make a master mix to resuspend dried pellets in 29 µL of Tris, pH 8.0 + 1 µL of 10 mg/mL RNase A each. Digest RNA at 37 °C for 20 min.\nMix 1 µL of 6X DNA loading dye with 5 µL of each sample and run on a 1.5% agarose gel at 120 V for 40 min.\n3. Size Selection\nNOTE: The goal of size selection is to remove multi-kilobase fragments of genomic DNA from the sample to be sequenced and enrich fragments of ~150 bp (approximately the size of nucleosomal DNA) or smaller. In sequencing data, fragments <400 bp are enriched, with a notable peak around the size of nucleosomal DNA (~150 bp) and a peak or broad distribution of subnucleosomal fragments.",
    "To each sample, add 75 µL of solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution23 and pipet up and down 10 times to mix. Incubate the bead:DNA mixture at RT for 5 min.\nDuring the SPRI bead incubation, prepare microfuge tubes containing 96 µL of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 4 µL of 5 M NaCl for each sample.\nPlace tubes in a magnetic rack to collect beads on the side of the tube. Allow the beads to collect on the side of the tube for 2 min.\nTransfer each supernatant to a new tube containing Tris and NaCl (step 3.2).\nAdd 200 µL of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to each sample, vortex to mix, and centrifuge at maximum speed and RT in a microfuge for 5 min.\nRemove each aqueous phase to a new tube. Add 30 µg of glycogen and 500 µL of 100% ethanol. Precipitate DNA on dry ice for 10 min or until solution is viscous.\nPellet precipitated DNA at maximum speed and 4 °C in a microfuge for 10 min.\nDecant supernatants and wash pellets with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.\nDecant ethanol, removing the remainder by inverting and gently tapping the tubes on a paper towel. Briefly spin samples using a benchtop centrifuge and use a pipet to remove residual ethanol, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Air-dry pellets for at RT for 5 min.\nResuspend dried pellets in 25 µL of Tris, pH 8.0. Determine sample concentration using a high-sensitivity assay. For TF ChEC experiments, 10-100 ng DNA is routinely recovered after size selection.\nPrepare sequencing libraries. Library preparation protocols that do not rely upon size selection, as previously described24, are desirable to allow sequencing of a large range of fragment sizes (25-500 bp).",
    "Sequence libraries in paired-end mode. A minimum of 25 bases of sequence on each end is needed for high quality read mapping. Between 1 and 2 million reads provides sufficient coverage for a ChEC sample.\n\tNOTE: Analysis of ChEC-seq data is a complex procedure and beyond the scope of this article. Detailed information on data analysis can be found in previous publications1,21, and the custom scripts used for analysis are available on GitHub (https://github.com/zentnerlab/chec-seq). HOMER25 (http://homer.salk.edu) can also be used for command-line analysis of ChEC-seq data.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
