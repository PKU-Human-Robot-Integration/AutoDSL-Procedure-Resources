    "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microsome preparationAll steps are carried out on ice or at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise.Pre-cool all buffers, tubes etc. used in the procedure.5 g of maize coleoptile or primary root tissue (4 d after germination) are ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. The powder is then homogenized in 4 ml of ice-cold buffer 1 and transferred into a 50 ml falcon tube. 4 ml of ice-cold buffer 2 are added to the tube and the suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min. Then the homogenate is centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant is poured over 4 layers of cheese cloth into a fresh falcon tube. At this step, the resulting extract is considered total plant extract for later enzymatic assays. The extract is centrifuged again at 4,500 x g for 25 min at 4 °C.Prepare ultracentrifuge corex tubes with a 4 ml sucrose cushion (buffer 3) on the bottom.The 8 ml of plant suspension is layered on top of the sucrose cushion by slightly angling the tube and carefully and slowly pipetting the suspension at the side of the tube. The tube is centrifuged for 90 min at 93,000 x g (ultracentrifuge with swing-out rotor SW41).The resulting pellet is removed from the ultracentrifuge tube if necessary with 20 μl of buffer 4 and transferred to a 2 ml Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer. The supernatant is kept and used as cytosolic extract in later IAA quantifications.The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer 4 using a glass rod and a 2 ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Protein content was measured using a Nanodrop. Freshly prepared microsomes were used for enzymatic assays straight away.",
    "This part of the procedure will take between 3 and 4 h depending on sample size.Microsomal enzymatic tests The YUCCA-route of auxin biosynthesis is a two-step process (Figure 1): In maize TAR-proteins [Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis-related proteins; ZmTAR1 (Chourey et al., 2010), ZmVT2 (Phillips et al., 2011), and ZmTAR3 (ZmAlliin1; Bernardi et al., 2012)] are converting tryptophan (Trp) to indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) which is then converted by YUCCA proteins to IAA [ZmYUC1 and ZmSPI1 (Phillips et al., 2011)]. It was shown that ZmYUC1 and ZmVT2 are localized in the cytosol, whereas ZmSPI1, ZmTAR1 and ZmTAR3 are localized to the ER (Kriechbaumer et al., 2015).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160504/20160504192055_3720.jpgFigure1. YUCCA-route of auxin biosynthesis in maize. Cytosolic enzymes are labeled in green, ER-localised enzymes in blue.Enzymatic activity tests (100 μl total volume) with microsomal and cytosolic fractions were carried out in the following manner:20 μl of microsomal or cytosolic extract or total plant extract (see step A5)1 mM NADPH100 μM FAD100 μM IPyA or Trp (depending on experimental interest) 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) up to a total volume of 100 μlMixed carefully in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes Note: For this the 100 mM Tris-HCl should be pipetted first, followed by the plant extract and then FAD. The reaction time is started with the addition of the substrate (IPyA or Trp).The assays were incubated for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen straight after the incubation time.For comparison enzymatic tests were also performed with the cytosolic fraction and total plant extract.At this stage the assays can be stored at -20 °C before the IAA analysis is carried out.IAA extraction and quantificationIAA is extracted by ethyl acetate phase separation (Park et al., 2003; Kriechbaumer et al., 2007) (Figure 2) from the enzyme assays prepared in section B.",
    "The whole sample of each assay is used for this procedure. For this the pH of sample is adjusted higher than 9.5 with 1 M Na2CO3, and the sample is then extracted with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. The aqueous lower phase is recovered and 200 μl of water are added.The partitioning procedure is repeated recover the aqueous phase again. The aqueous phases from both partitioning steps are combined. The collected aqueous phase is acidified with acetic acid to a pH below 2.5 and partitioned twice with addition of 400 μl of ethyl acetate for each step. The organic phases are collected and the liquid evaporated using a speed-vac (pre-set settings with room temperature). Evaporation will take around two hours but the sample should be checked from time to time. The dried substances are re-dissolved in 100% methanol and can be stored at -20 °C before further analysis if necessary.The IAA extraction can take up to 5 h depending on sample size and evaporation time in the speed-vac.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160504/20160504192113_4368.jpgFigure 2. Schematic representation of IAA extraction using ethyl acetate phase separation. The steps for IAA extraction by ethyl acetate phase separation are shown in this diagram. The Water phase is shown in blue, the organic phase in red. pH adjustments are indicated as well as changes in Eppendorf tubes.IAA is then analysed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase column.For this the HPLC system is run in an isocratic flow of 0.8 ml min-1 with a 40:60 mixture of buffer A (10% methanol, 0.3% acetate) and buffer B (90% methanol, 0.3% acetate). Peaks were identified by comparison with the standard substances with respect to retention time and UV spectrum using both a UV monitor and a fluorescence monitor.",
    "The amount of IAA in each sample was calculated using the volume of the IAA-peak and compare it with the volume of IAA peaks resulting from IAA standards with known amounts. This will give the amount of IAA per sample. The protein amount in microsomal, cytosolic and total protein fractions is determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm by an UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (e.g., by Nanodrop Instrument ND-2000). With this data the amount of IAA per µg protein can be calculated (Figure 4)."
