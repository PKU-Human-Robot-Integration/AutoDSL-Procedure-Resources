This is a schematic of yfg (your favorite gene – the gene of interest) with all necessary primers and N20 sequences. This will help put in context the different steps for primer design. As a positive control, primers needed to generate a CRISPR plasmid for a mgrB gene knockout are included in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/507-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of “your favorite gene” (yfg) and homology primers\n(A) Depicted is yfg annotated with the necessary primers to PCR amplify the homology for a 120 bp deletion, including the start codon. The chosen N20 sequences are also labeled, along with the Del_F/R primers used to identify the appropriate mutants.\n(B) Depicted is the actual sequence and primers necessary to create a pmrA gene knockout.\n(C) Primers are shown to generate SNPs in yfg. Notably in the yfg_Up_Hom_SNP_Silent_R the primer is designed to have 15–20 bp of overlapping sequence with the yfg_Dwn_Hom_Silent_F primer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_1.csv\nCopy the first 200 bp (from the ATG start codon) of yfg into the https://crispr.dbcls.jp/[href=https://crispr.dbcls.jp/] website and click “design.” Please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, which shows the sequence, annotated primers and annotated N20 sequences for the K. pneumoniae pmrA gene as a reference.\nChoose two appropriate guide RNA N20 candidate sequences with a melting temperature of 70°C–75°C and a GC content between 40% and 60%.",
    "Note: Be sure to note which strand the N20 sequence is found on (forward or reverse complement strand). PAM sequences (NGG) are found at the 3′ end of the N20 sequence. Two different guide RNA sequences are chosen for each knockout in case the efficiency of one is low in the knockout protocol. This allows for rapid use of the second guide RNA without having to re-design the CRISPR plasmid.\nClick on the gRNA button next to the two selected N20 sequences to generate the full gRNA sequences. Change RNA to DNA by clicking the U→T button on the next page. This will provide the template DNA sequence for the gRNA.\nCopy the first 40 bp of the DNA sequence:\nN20 Sequence + GTT TTA GAG CTA GAA ATA GC\nThese sequences will be the gRNA_1_F and gRNA_2 F primers (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nCopy and paste these primer sequences into an excel spreadsheet based on Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nCreate a reverse complement of the two N20 sequences to generate the two gRNA_R primers. The additional sequence shown below is part of the pTAC promoter found directly upstream of the gRNA template DNA in the pUC19_CRISPR_ΔpmrA plasmid.\nReverse complement N20 Sequence + CCA CAC ATT ATA CGA GCC GA\nThese sequences will be the gRNA_1 and gRNA_2 R primers.\nCopy and paste these primer sequences into the excel spreadsheet.\nOpen the full gene sequence for the desired gene to be knocked out in a sequencing analyzing software, like SeqBuilder Pro from DNASTAR. Ensure there is at least 300 bp upstream of the start codon.\nAnnotate the two N20 sequences in the gene sequence. Ideally, the N20 sequences are within the first 150 bp of the gene.",
    "Design primers to amplify two areas of homology for the puc19_CRISPR_Δyfg plasmid. Ideally the area of homology (upstream and downstream of the Cas9 cut site) is between 500–1,000 bp. For example, design the upstream homology primers to amplify approximately 250 bp upstream of the Cas9 cut site and the downstream homology to amplify 500 bp downstream of the Cas9 cut site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The sequence between the two areas of homology will be deleted following the knockout protocol.\nNote: Four primers will be designed as indicated below. The two middle primers contain an imbedded restriction site. XbaI is shown below, but an alternative restriction site can be substituted. This site is used to ligate the two areas of homology together to create the full homology cassette. The 5′ and 3′ primers contain BsaI and AhdI sites respectively, allowing for ligation into the digested pUC19_CRISPR plasmid.\nyfg_Up_Hom_F_BsaI\nyfg_Up_Hom_R_XbaI\nyfg_Dwn_Hom_F_XbaI\nyfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI\nChoose 20 bp approximately 250 bp upstream of the yfg start codon.\nATT + [BsaI site:GGT CTC GCG GT] + chosen 20 bp\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Up_Hom_F_BsaI.\nChoose 20 bp around the start codon of yfg\nATT + [XbaI site: TCTAGA] + reverse complement of chosen 20 bp\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Up_Hom_R_XbaI.\nChoose 20 bp approximately 120–150 bp from the start codon of yfg. Ensure the start of this primer is downstream of the second N20 sequence.\nATT + [XbaI site: TCTAGA] + chosen 20 bp\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Dwn_Hom_F_XbaI.\nNote: The area between the yfg_Up_Hom_R_XbaI and yfg_Dwn_Hom_F_XbaI primers, which are used to amplify the two homology arms, will be the region within yfg that will be deleted in the final knockout strain. If the area to be deleted exceeds approximately 150 bp the efficiency of homologous recombination decreases.",
    "Choose 20 bp approximately 500 bp downstream of the yfg_Dwn_Hom_F primer.\nATT + [AhdI site: GAC CCC CTG TC] + reverse complement of chosen 20 bp\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI.\nCopy and paste the four primer sequences into the excel spreadsheet.\nChoose 20–25 bp directly upstream of the yfg_Up_Hom_F primer sequence.\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Del_F.\nChoose 20–25 bp directly downstream of the yfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI primer sequence.\nThe reverse complement of this sequence will be: yfg_Del_R.\nNote: These primers will be used after the knockout protocol is completed to screen for the appropriate knockout mutant. Mutants that have undergone the appropriate CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will have a smaller band (based on the amount of the gene deleted) than the WT parent strain.\nCreate two primers with the two N20 sequences used in the two gRNA_F primers. These will be named N20_1_F and N20_2_F. The N20_1_F and N20_2_F and the yfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI primers will create an approximately 1,800 bp band if the final plasmid has ligated together appropriately. Please see the plasmid cloning section for further details.\nNote: These primers will be used to identify the correctly ligated final CRISPR plasmid after the ligation is transformed into chemically competent E. coli cells.\nPrimers CRISPR_Vector F: 5′-GTT GTG AAG AAA AAG TGA ATG ATG TAG CCG and gRNA_Vector_R: 5′-ATT ACC GCG AGA CC G AAA CCA TTA TTA TCA TGA CAT TAA CC are included in the excel spreadsheet and are required to PCR amplify the gRNA cassette from the pUC19_CRISPR_ΔpmrA plasmid.\nOrder primers from IDTdna or an equivalent company that synthesizes DNA oligonucleotides.",
    "Note: Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] includes validated primers for a knockout of the mgrB gene in K. pneumoniae. These primers can be used as a positive control. The knockout of mgrB induces polymyxin resistance, which is an easy to measure phenotype via broth microdilution or Etest.\nPrimer design (for SNP insertions)\nTiming: 2–3 h\nNote: Please review the schematic in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, which illustrates all the necessary primers and N20 sequence for a SNP insertion in an example yfg. For SNP insertions we use the same CRISPR plasmid backbone as for deletions, but replace the origin of replication with pBBR1. This is a broad-host range, low copy number, origin of replication. The lower copy number origin of replication is more efficient for SNP editing. The pBBR1MCS2 plasmid can also be obtained via Addgene and the origin of replication can be amplified and used to replace the pUC origin of replication in the pUC19_CRISPR_ΔpmrA plasmid.\nCopy the 200 bp downstream of the location of the desired SNP in yfg into the https://crispr.dbcls.jp/[href=https://crispr.dbcls.jp/] website and click “design.”\nChoose one appropriate guide RNA N20 candidate sequences based on the following parameters: a melting temperature of 70°C–75°C, a GC content between 40% and 60%, and approximately 30–60 bp from the desired SNP.\nFollow steps 3–7 of the primer design section for gene knockouts to create the primers to amplify the gRNA template DNA for SNP insertion.\nNote: For SNP insertion only one N20 sequence is necessary. The amplified homology cassette will be specific to the selected N20 sequence.",
    "Note: Two primer pairs will be designed as indicated below. One of the two middle primers will contain the desired SNP and both will contain approximately 40 bp of overlapping sequence to allow for a downstream fusion PCR reaction to amplify the full homology cassette. This overlapping sequence will contain yfg gene sequence with a series of silent mutations that help to improve the efficiency of homologous recombination during the knock-in protocol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). The 5′ and 3′ primers will contain BsaI and AhdI sites respectively, allowing for future ligation into the digested pBBR1_CRISPR plasmid.\nyfg_Up_Hom_F_BsaI\nyfg_Up_Hom_SNP_Silent_R\nyfg_Dwn_Hom_Silent_F\nyfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI\nChoose 20 bp approximately 250–500 bp upstream of the desired SNP.\nATT + [BsaI site:GGTCTCGCGGT] + chosen 20 bp\nThis sequence will be: yfg_Up_Hom_F_BsaI.\nEnsure the sequence analysis software displays the amino acid sequence for yfg in the desired reading frame.\nChange the gene sequence to include the desired SNP.\nHighlight the sequence directly downstream of the desired SNP and the end of the selected N20 + PAM (NGG) sequence. Identify all the codons that have a wobble bp and change the 3rd bp in these codons to insert a silent mutation. Ensure the resulting amino acid sequence (other than with the desired SNP) does not change.\nHighlight approximately 15 bp upstream of the SNP and 45 bp downstream of the SNP to create an approximately 60 bp sequence. The reverse complement of this sequence will be: yfg_Up_Hom_SNP_Silent_R.\nIdentify an approximately 60 bp sequence that includes at least 15 bp of overlap with the yfg_Up_Hom_SNP_Silent_R primer, the modified N20 + PAM sequence and 15 bp of un-edited yfg sequence downstream of the N20 + PAM sequence. This sequence will be: yfg_Dwn_Hom_Silent_F.\nChoose 20 bp approximately 250–500 bp downstream of the yfg_Dwn_Hom_Silent_F primer.",

This sequence will be: yfg_SNP_Confirm_F.\nChoose 20–25 bp directly downstream of the yfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI primer. The reverse complement of this will be: yfg_SNP_Confirm_R.\nNote: These two primers will be used to confirm the successful homologous recombination of the yfg homology into the genome. This primer combination will only amplify genomic DNA that has been modified with the completed yfg SNP CRISPR plasmid.\nOrder primers from IDTdna or an equivalent company that synthesizes DNA oligonucleotides.\nCRISPR plasmid cloning\nTiming: 5–7 days\nDay 1: PCR amplify the two areas of homology (Up homology, Down homology) for the homology cassette and the two gRNA PCR products for the gRNA cassettes.

Since the PCR products will be used in downstream applications we recommend a 50 μL reaction volume following the NEB Phusion polymerase protocol. The PCR parameters shown below can be used for all four PCR reactions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_3.csv\nLoad all 50 μL of each PCR product on a 1% agarose gel to visualize and ensure the appropriate band sizes indicated above.",
    "Note: The size of the homology arms will depend on the primers chosen above.\nGel purify the four PCR products according to the QIAquick gel purification kit protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]). Elute the DNA product in 45 μL of H2O. Store the two gRNA PCR products at −20°C\nSet up a restriction enzyme digestion with XbaI for the up and down areas of homology. Incubate at 37°C for approximately 1 h.\nClean up the two restriction enzyme digests according to the QIAquick PCR purification kit protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]).\nQuantify the concentration of the two areas of homology and set up a ligation at a 1:1 molar ratio of each with T4 DNA ligase. Follow the protocol from NEB to setup a 20 μL ligation (https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/dna-ligation-with-t4-dna-ligase-m0202[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/dna-ligation-with-t4-dna-ligase-m0202]). Allow the ligation to incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for approximately 1 h.\nNote: This ligation reaction will generate three different product sizes, assuming 100% ligation efficiency. A 500 bp product (up homology + up homology) a 750 bp product (up homology + down homology) and a 1000 bp product (down homology + down homology). The 750 bp product is the desired homology cassette that will induce the desired deletion after homologous recombination into yfg.\nRun the entire ligation reaction on a 1% agarose gel, allowing for appropriate separation of the three expected bands: 500 bp, 750 bp and 1,000 bp.\nGel purify the 750 bp band using the QIAquick gel purification kit. Elute product in 30 μL of H2O.",
    "Note: For amplification of the homology for a SNP insertion the amplification and gel extraction steps are the same. Since the second PCR reaction utilizes a fusion PCR technique, restriction enzyme digestion + ligation is not necessary. It will be necessary, however, to quantify the concentration of the two areas of homology after gel purification to generate a 1:1 molar ratio in the downstream fusion PCR reaction.\nSet up PCR reactions using the Phusion polymerase to amplify the full gRNA cassette, the ligated yfg homology cassette or the yfg homology cassette for a SNP insertion. Since these PCR products will be used for downstream cloning, we recommend a 100 μL reaction to ensure enough product.\nyfg_Up_Hom_F_BsaI + yfg_Dwn_Hom_R_AhdI (gene deletion primers)– Template: 1 μL of gel purified ligation.

The N20 sequence in the gRNA_F primer and the reverse complement of the N20 sequence in the gRNA_R primer will bind via homology allowing for amplification of the full 1500 bp cassette. Similarly, the overlapping area of silent mutations in the yfg_Up_Hom_SNP_Silent_R and yfg_Dwn_Hom_Silent_F primers will bind via homology allowing for amplification of the full cassette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).

Gel purify the cassettes using the QIAquick gel purification kit. Expected band sizes are:\nThe gRNA cassette: approximately 1,500 bp,\nyfg homology cassette for knockout: 750 bp,\nyfg homology cassette for SNP insertion: variable.\nNote: With the gRNA cassette amplification, the fusion PCR technique will yield several smaller, non-specific bands.

Incubate at 37°C overnight, 12–18 h.\nNote: Plating a lower concentration of the transformation reaction (only 50 μL or 1:10 / 1:100 dilutions) may be necessary depending on the underlying competency of the K. pneumoniae strain to be modified. The ST258 carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae isolates are minimally competent and thus require plating a higher concentration of the transformation reaction. Additionally, it may be necessary to change the final concentration of zeocin in the LB plates. Performing a broth microdilution with zeocin and the isolate to be modified will allow for more precise prediction of the isolate’s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to zeocin. 1000 μg/mL is an appropriate zeocin concentration for the majority of the carbapenem resistant ST258 K. pneumoniae isolates.\nPick between 8 and 32 colonies on the resulting plate for colony PCR to confirm the CRISPR plasmid has been taken up.",
    "Note: There is low-level background resistance to zeocin that develops in vitro for some of the K. pneumoniae isolates. As a result, this colony PCR step to confirm the desired plasmid has been taken up by the K. pneumoniae isolate is necessary.\nRe-suspend the picked colonies in 25 μL of water.\nUse the CRISPR_Vector_F and gRNA_Vector_R primers to confirm the presence of the CRISPR plasmid using colony PCR with standard Taq polymerase. Follow the NEB protocol for a 25 μL reaction (https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273]). The pUC19_CRISPR_ΔpmrA plasmid can be used as a positive control. The expected band is approximately 1,500 bp. Use 1 μL of each picked colony as a template. Below are the appropriate PCR reaction conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_10.csv\nRun the resulting PCR products on a 1% agarose gel to identify colonies that harbor the CRISPR plasmid, demonstrated by a 1,500 bp band.\nStore the picked colonies that have taken up the plasmid at −20°C for future use in the knockout protocol.\nDay 5: MgrB knockout or SNP editing protocol. Inoculate 10 μL of each picked colony into two 5 mL cultures of LB supplemented with 1000 μg/mL of zeocin. Label one culture “induced” and one culture “control”.\nNote: The knockout and SNP editing protocols are identical for either a deletion mutant or a SNP mutant.\nCritical: There is variability in the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 protocol. As a result, choosing 2–4 colonies that contain the CRISPR plasmid to use in the knockout / SNP editing protocol allows for higher likelihood of success.\nGrow the two cultures per picked colony shaking at 220 RPM and 30°C for 2 h.",
    "After 2 h add 100 μL of 10% arabinose to the “induced” culture to achieve a final concentration of 0.2% arabinose. The arabinose will induce the expression of the cas9 and lambda red recombineering genes (see below).\nGrow the induced and control cultures shaking at 220 RPM and 30°C for 6–8 h.\nNote: Since the plasmid contains two arabinose promoters, one upstream of the cas9 gene and one upstream of the lambda red recombineering genes, only the induced cultures will express the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery. Since the double-strand break induced by the combination of Cas9 and the mgrB gRNA is toxic to growing bacterial cells, only those isolates that undergo homologous recombination with the mgrB homology will survive. Since the homologous recombination event is not 100% efficient, the induced culture should be significantly less turbid than the control culture (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/507-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Differential growth of the induced versus control cultures\nShown in the left panel are two cultures from a single picked colony containing a CRISPR plasmid. The left culture was induced with 2% arabinose and has grown significantly slower than the control culture, which has not been induced. On the right is the resulting plate showing significantly fewer colonies on the induced side compared with the control side.\nMeasure the OD600 of the induced and control cultures after the 6–8 h of growth. If the OD600 is greater than 0.10 (visibly turbid) make a 1:100 dilution of the cultures to ensure single colonies upon plating. If the OD600 is less 0.1 (not visibly turbid) plate directly from the resulting culture\nPlate 10 μL of the induced culture dilution on LB + 1000 μg/mL of zeocin + 0.2%\narabinose and 10 μL of the control culture dilution on LB + 1000 μg/mL of zeocin only.",
    "Incubate the plates at 30°C overnight, 12–18 h.\nDay 6: mgrB knockout mutant or SNP edited mutant confirmation. Perform colony PCR on 24–48 colonies from the induced plate using the mgrB_Del F/R primers to detect a deletion within the genome. Use the standard Taq polymerase and follow the NEB protocol for a 25 μL reaction (https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273]). Run a control reaction with a colony of the wild type parent K. pneumoniae isolate. Use 1 μL of each picked colony as a template.\nNote: These primers bind genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the homology contained in the pUC19_CRISPR_ΔmgrB plasmid, thus will not amplify the plasmid and will only amplify genomic DNA (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). If the double-strand break and homologous recombination event have occurred there will be a deletion in the genomic DNA and the PCR band from the desired mutant will be smaller than from the WT parent isolate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/507-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative gel confirming a CRISPR mediated gene knockout\nThe first four wells demonstrate a smaller band, consistent with an approximately 140 bp knockout in four mutants.\nNote: For confirmation of SNP editing the yfg_SNP_Confirm_F/R primers are used. The forward primer binds within the area of homology containing the silent mutations; only binding genomic DNA of the desired mutant, or the pBBR1_CRISPR_yfg_SNP plasmid. The reverse primer will only bind genomic DNA and as a result only the desired mutant will produce a band with this primer set. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C for a schematic to see relative locations of primer binding. Below are the PCR reaction conditions for both the knockout and SNP editing confirmation using standard Taq polymerase.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_11.csv",
    "Identify the picked colonies that contain the appropriate deletion or SNP based on the PCR reaction. Streak up to 4 on non-selective LB agar and incubate at 37°C overnight, 12–18 h.\nDays 7–9: Confirming the Mutant via Sanger Sequencing, curing the CRISPR plasmid and Stocking the Final Mutant. Pick 4–8 colonies from each sub-cultured mutant and repeat the colony PCR with the mgrB_Del_F/R or yfg_SNP_Confirm_F/R primers to ensure the mutation is stable.\nSend 1–4 PCR products for Sanger sequencing to confirm the deletion. Use the mgrB_Del F or yfg_SNP_Confirm_R primers to confirm the desired mutation. This will confirm the presence of the knockout or SNP in the genomic DNA.\nStreak the same 1–4 picked colonies onto non-selective LB agar. Incubate at 37°C overnight, 12–18 h.\nPick up to 48 colonies from the plates that were sequence confirmed to run colony PCR to evaluate for loss of the CRISPR plasmid. Use the CRISPR_Vector_F and gRNA_Vector_R primers with standard Taq polymerase in a 25 μL reaction. Follow the NEB protocol for a 25 μL reaction (https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273]). Below are the appropriate PCR reaction conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_12.csv\nNote: After one sub-culture onto non-selective media, loss of the CRISPR plasmid occurs in 1%–5% of picked colonies. After two rounds of sub-culturing onto non-selective media this increases to approximately 20%–50% of picked colonies. Screening 48 picked colonies will likely yield at least one colony that lacks a band with the CRISPR_Vector_F / gRNA_Vector_R primers, indicating loss of the CRISPR plasmid.\nSelect 1–2 picked colonies that lack the CRISPR plasmid and inoculate these colonies into 5 mL of LB broth. Shake at 220 RPM and 37°C overnight 12–18 h.\nStock the mutant in a final concentration of LB + 25% glycerol. Store at −80°C for future use.",
    "Note: We frequently also carry out whole genome sequencing of edited isolates to confirm the deletion, true loss of the plasmid and to ensure no off-target effects have occurred. This can be performed with multiple commercial agencies including Genewiz (https://www.genewiz.com/en/Public/Services/Next-Generation-Sequencing/Whole-Genome-Sequencing[href=https://www.genewiz.com/en/Public/Services/Next-Generation-Sequencing/Whole-Genome-Sequencing]).\nNote: The resulting mgrB deletion mutant will be polymyxin resistant; an easy way to test the resulting phenotype is to perform a broth microdilution to polymyxin B as described below.\nDilute 55 mg of polymyxin B sulfate in 8.27 mL of molecular grade water. This makes a 5120 μg/mL stock solution. Vortex and separate into 500 μL aliquots.\nCreate 11 solutions in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) based on the table below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_13.csv\nThis will create enough solution for approximately 4 broth microdilution 96 well plates. Add 100 μL of the solutions to a 96 well round bottom cell culture plate based on the table below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_507_14.csv\nWrap plates in parafilm and store at −80°C for future use for up to 2 weeks.\nRe-suspend bacterial isolates from picked colonies into 3 to 5 mL normal saline in a disposable culture glass tube to reach a 0.5 McFarland standard of the bacterial suspension.\nDilute 15 μL of this 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension in 1485 μL of CAMHB.\nInoculate 100 μL of this dilution into one row of the 96 well broth microdilution plate. Each 96 well plate can test up to 8 isolates.\nWrap the plate in parafilm and incubate at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nThe MIC corresponds to the final polymyxin B concentration in the first well where there is no bacterial growth.\nNote: The expected polymyxin B MIC of the mgrB deletion mutant will be 8–32 μg/mL, with resistance defined as a MIC of >2 μg/mL."
