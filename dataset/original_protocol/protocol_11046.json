    "Six to eight week old male BALB/c athymic mice (n = 10) were housedin individually ventilated mice cages (5 mice/cage) in a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animal room under the conditions of 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to SPF feed and sterile water. Mice were adaptively fed for a week before the experiments.All animal experiments were approved by the animal welfare committee of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n1. Cell preparation\nOn the day of prostate cancer cell injection, wash 80%-90% confluent luciferase labeled PC-3 cells (PC-3-luciferase) cultured in a 10 cm cell culture dish with pre-cold sterile PBS (pH 7.4) twice. Trypsinize for 3 min with 1.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin, and collect the cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube after quenching the trypsin with 6 mL of F-12 medium containing 10% serum.\n\tNOTE: The PC-3-luciferase cell line is derived from the PC-3 cell line after being transfected with the pLV-luciferase vector15.\nUse an automatic cell counter and calculate the cell concentration by transferring 20 µL of the cell suspension to the cell counting plate (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nUse a pipette to discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in F-12 medium (see Table of Materials) to a final cell density of 1 x 107 cells/mL.\nKeep the cells on ice at all times until injection.\nBring the cells to the surgery room and finish the cell injection within 2 h.\n\tNOTE: Prepare additional cell suspensions (usually doubled volumes as required) to ensure accurate injection doses (for example, to avoid the dead spaces inside the syringes).\n2. Surgery for intra-cardiac injection of the human prostate cancer cells",
    "NOTE: The surgical apparatus used for intra-cardiac injection is a 1 mL syringe (Figure 1). Provide thermal support throughout the procedure until the animal’s recovery from anesthesia.\nKeep the mouse in the SPF animal room. Perform all the procedures with sterilized apparatuses within an aseptic cabinet.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 2% isoflurane with 98% oxygen under a 2 L/min oxygen flow rate.\n\tNOTE: Smear a small quantity of ophthalmic ointment on the mouse's eyes to avoid dryness during the anesthesia.Perform the whole surgery in a well-ventilated area. Make sure that the mouse is deeply anesthetized by pinching the mouse's toes before cell injection. If responses (e.g., a jerk or twitch) remain, wait for additional time for the anesthesia to take effect.\nPlace the mouse in a supone position and immobilize both upper limbs perpendicularly stretched away from the midline (Figure 2A).\nImmobilize the mouse from the abdomen down with surgical adhesive tape. Avoid pressing hard and displacing the internal organs (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Maintaining the topographic anatomy (i.e., fixing with adhesive tape) is essential since the intra-cardiac injection is blind (i.e., the accurate injection site on the heart is invisible to the naked eye).\nDisinfect the skin of the thorax with a 70% ethanol swab.\nIdentify the mouse xiphoid process in the depression at the lowest end of the mid-sternum by palpating down the middle of the anterior chest wall. Identify the mouse jugular notch in the central depression at the upper border of the manubrium by palpating up from the middle of the anterior chest wall.",
    "Label the most inferior point of the xiphoid process and jugular notch with a marker pen (Figure 2A). Make a third mark in the middle of these two landmarks and slightly to the right (animal's left) just over the heart in the third intercostal space.\n\tNOTE: The site of injection is 1-2 mm left of the midline, and the injection point is between the third and fourth ribs of the mouse (Figure 2A).\nLoad 200 µL of the cell suspension into a 1 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: Keep an air bubble in the syringe, as shown in Figure 2C, to ensure that the blood is pulsating. The cell suspension must be thoroughly mixed before loading.\nVertically insert a 26 G needle through the injection site (Figure 2D).\nKeep the hand holding the syringe stable on the table, or use the other hand to hold it stable. Ensure that the long axis of the syringe is perpendicular to the injection site, and insert the syringe about 2 mm subcutaneously.\nBright-red blood pulsation is visible in the needle hub and/or cell suspension when the needle tip is correctly inserted into the left ventricle. If the blood pulsation is invisible, the needle tip is not in the heart. Retract and replace the needle (in case the blood clotting inside the needle stops blood pulsation). Insert the needle once again.\nInject the cells. Inject the cell suspension (100 µL) very slowly over 40-60 s and keep the hand holding the syringe stable all the time.\n\tNOTE: Keep a close eye on the cell suspension in the syringe, and do not inject the air bubble inside the syringe into the heart.\nApply pressure to the injection site with a dry cotton swab for 15 s to ensure hemostasis when the needle is retracted.",
    "Return the mouse to the clean cage and monitor the animal until it completely recovers from anesthesia.\nImage the mouse with an in vivo bioluminescence system within 24 h post-injection to ensure the cancer cells have entered the systemic circulation.\n\tNOTE: Correctly injected cancer cells enter the arterial circulation via the left heart ventricle, which is seen by the bioluminescence signaling visible all over the body (for example, see Figure 3A).\nPerform in vivo bioluminescence imaging.\n\t\nTurn on the instrument and the computer. Open the software when the power indicator on the instrument and computer brightens, and then open the Image Acquisition window.\nIdentify the in vivo imaging system connected to the computer in the device pane. Place the mouse to be imaged into the imaging chamber in a supine position. Then close the door of the imaging chamber.\nSet the parameters on the Setting pane provided in the Image Acquisition window.\n\t\t\nSet the parameters with Lens > Zoom > 1x, Lens > Focus > 108, and Lens > Iris > F 2.8 to make the images clear.\nSet the shooting channel in Filter&Light: Filter&Light > Filter > Luminescence, Filter&Light > Light > OFF, and Filter&Light > Light Intensity > Middle.\nSet the type of image to be taken: Imaging > Type > Single-Frame, Imaging > Exposure Time > 500 ms, Imaging > HDR Mode > Low GainMode. Click on the Acquire button to acquire the image.\nVisualize the metastatic cancer growth with in vivo bioluminescence.",
    "NOTE: At each time point of the visualization, intraperitoneally inject 200 µL of the luciferin substrate into a 20 g mouse (150 mg/kg) and wait 15 min before the anesthesia (2% isoflurane mixed with 98% oxygen in an induction chamber). Place the mouse on the bioluminescence imaging system platform. Maintain anesthesia through a nasal mask with 2% isoflurane.\n3. Pathologic investigation\nFour weeks after the cell injection, sacrifice the mouse by CO2 inhalation and then cervical dislocation.\nImmobilize the mouse in a supine position. Make a vertical incision (about 6 cm) from the abdomen to the thorax with surgical scissors to expose and grossly examine all the organs in the abdomen and thorax for cancerous lesions and/or pathological changes.\n\tNOTE: For an intra-cardiac cancer cell injection study, cancer lesions in the mediastinum adjacent to the heart suggest misinjected cancer cells (cells not injected into the left cardiac ventricle); therefore, these mice are not included in the final data collection.\nExcise the metastatic tumors with scissors. Measure the long diameters (a) and short diameters (b) of the tumor using calipers to calculate the tumor volume (V) using the formula V = 1/2 × a × b2, and weigh the tumor using an electronic scale.\nFix the tumor tissues in 10% formalin solution followed by embedding in paraffin. Alternatively, snap-freeze the tumors in liquid nitrogen.\nExcise the bones (hind limbs, vertebrae, and/or ribs) with metastatic lesions. Fix the specimen of each mouse in a 50 mL tube containing 20 mL of 10% formalin solution for 24 h after removing the skin and muscles, followed by decalcification for 14 days in 10% EDTA solution with frequent buffer change (every 3 days).\nEmbed the specimen in paraffin and section the samples for the routine histological examination16.\nSubscription Required.
