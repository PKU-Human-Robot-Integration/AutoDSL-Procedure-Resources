    "1. Preparation of Media and Reagents\nThaw the basement membrane matrix coating for culture plates at 4 °C (do not allow the basement membrane matrix to warm up or it will solidify). Make 1 mL aliquots and store them at -20 °C or -70 °C.\nReconstitute basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 10 µg/mL and make 10 µL aliquots. Store them at 4 °C.\nTo a new, unopened, 500 mL bottle of DMEM/F12 with glutamine, add B27 (10 mL), N2 (5 mL), and penicillin-streptomycin (5 mL). Place 50 mL of this neural stem cell (NSC) media in a conical tube and add 10 µL of 10 µg/µL (2 µg/mL final) bFGF. Store the NSC (+)bFGF media at 4 °C.\nTo make (-)bFGF media, use the same recipe as described in step 1.3 but do not add bFGF. This media will be used to differentiate NSCs to neurons and to maintain neuronal cultures after differentiation.\n2. Lentiviral Constructs\nNOTE: Before beginning work with lentiviral constructs, ensure that the lab has been approved to use biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) agents. Furthermore, BSL-2 culture hoods, personal protective equipment (PPE), and disposal methods must be used when working with lentiviral vectors.\nObtain tau constructs packaged into lentivirus from a preferred source (see Sanders et al.10 for construct information).\n3. Culturing Human Neural Stem Cells",
    "NOTE: NSCs are typically seeded at 100,000–150,000 cells/cm2 and most commercially available NSCs are sold as 1 x 106 cells/vial. This protocol has been optimized for 10 cm cell culture dishes (although other sizes of dishes may be used); therefore, if commercially available NSCs are being used, the NSCs may need to be expanded by first being cultured in six-well dishes in order to result in enough cells to seed 10 cm dishes. This protocol can alternatively be adapted for a variety of cell culture dish sizes (but it does not contain instructions for passaging NSCs as these protocols are available elsewhere11,12).\nFor the preparation of cell culture plates, remove one aliquot of frozen basement membrane matrix coating for cell culture plates and allow it to thaw at 4 °C (aliquots can be placed at 4 °C overnight the day before the cells are to be seeded). Add 385 µL of basement membrane matrix coating to 5 mL of DMEM/F12 media + penicillin-streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: 5 mL of DMEM/F12 media + penicillin-streptomycin is enough to coat a single 10 cm dish (1 mL of this basement membrane matrix coating solution is sufficient to coat one well of a six-well dish). Alternatively, if the cells are to be fixed and immunostained, or stained for thioflavin, culture cells on glass coverslips in 24-well culture dishes.",
    "Keep the media and the matrix coating cold before and while adding them to culture dishes. Add the basement membrane matrix coating to culture dishes and place the dishes in an incubator (at 37 °C) for 1 h. For optimal coating, do not incubate the basement membrane matrix for more than or less than 1 h. After 1 h, aspirate the basement membrane matrix coating from the cell cultures dishes. Make sure this coincides with the NSCs being ready to be plated.\nNOTE: If cells are not being thawed from frozen stocks, skip step 3.2 and continue with step 3.3.\nIf cells are being thawed from frozen NSC stocks, take a vial of frozen cells and warm it in a water bath heated to 37 °C by moving the vial back and forth in the water. Once thawed, spray the vial with 70% ethanol and place it into a cell culture hood. Transfer the cells to ~10 mL of DMEM/F12 + penicillin-streptomycin media and centrifuge the tube at room temperature at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the media and resuspend the cells in NSC media.\nDilute the cells in NSC media to obtain the appropriate seeding density for the cell culture vessel that is being used.\nNOTE: For example, if NSCs are being plated onto a six-well plate—one well on a six-well culture dish has a surface area of 9 cm2—900,000 to 1,350,000 cells are required to seed. So, one vial containing 1,000,000 cells can be resuspended in 2 mL of media and added to a single well of a six-well dish.",
    "Add enough cells suspended in NSC media to seed the basement membrane matrix-coated culture dishes (100,000 cells/cm2) and change the media every other day (if using a frozen stock, change the media the day after plating and every other day thereafter). Grow the cells until they are 75%–80% confluent.\nNOTE: The cells will likely reach 75%–80% confluence shortly after plating, but this may take longer if frozen stocks are used.\nOnce the NSCs are 75%–80% confluent, begin neuronal differentiation by removing the NSC (+)bFGF media and replacing it with NSC (-)bFGF media. Culture the cells in this media (replacing the media every other day) for at least 4 weeks.\nNOTE: The cells will continue to divide for a few days following the withdrawal of bFGF; therefore, cells may reach 90–100% confluence. After culturing for 4 weeks, the cells will have achieved a neuronal fate and will be ready for the treatment of lentivirus.\n4. Transduction and Maintenance of Neuronal Cultures\nTo transduce neurons with lentivirus, use a titer count of 3.4 x 105 transducible units/cell (a 100% confluent 10 cm dish will contain ~10 million neurons). Dilute the transducible units to the necessary concentration in cell culture media and add them to the cells (use the normal volume of media for the cell culture dish). Two days after adding the lentivirus, wash the cells 1x with fresh (-)bFGF media (without lentivirus) and continue culturing in (-)bFGF media as usual.\nFor the post-lentiviral treatment, feed the transduced neurons by changing the cell culture media ([-]bFGF media) every other day. Maintain the cells for ~8 weeks after transduction. Routinely visualize the cells under a light microscope to ensure viability.\nNOTE: Sparseness or dendritic breakages are signs that the cells are no longer viable.\n5. Imaging of Cells\nLive-cell imaging",
    "After transduction (4 days after the addition of lentivirus), observe YFP signals under a fluorescent microscope capable of live-cell imaging. Take the cell culture dishes out of the incubator and make sure the culture wells remain sterile by keeping the lid on top of the culture dishes. Visualize the cells using a 10x objective with an excitation wavelength of ~514 nm and an emission filter of ~527 nm.\nNOTE: Aggregates are typically visible in transduced cell cultures 6–8 days after the application of lentivirus.\nFixed-cell staining (β-tubulin III labeling and thioflavin staining)\nTo fix the cells in paraformaldehyde (PFA), remove the culture media from transduced neurons grown on glass coverslips. Wash the cells 1x with PBS, remove the wash, and add 300–500 µL (if using 24-well plates) of 4% PFA (diluted in PBS) to the coverslips for 20 min at room temperature. Remove the PFA and wash the coverslips 2x with PBS.\nPrepare a blocking solution consisting of PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.3% Triton X-100. Add 300–500 µL of the solution to the wells and incubate the coverslips for 2 h at 4 °C. After 2 h, dilute primary antibodies (at an antibody concentration of 1:500) in blocking solution and add 300–500 µL of primary antibody solution to each well. Place the plate on a rocking or rotating platform (at low speed) overnight at 4 °C.",
    "The next day, remove the primary antibody solution and wash the coverslips 3x for 5 min each with PBS. Dilute secondary antibodies in a blocking buffer solution (at a concentration of 1:1,000) and add secondary antibody solution to each well. Select the appropriate secondary antibody by using a fluorescent tag that does not overlap with the YFP signal (CY-3, for example). Incubate the cells at room temperature for 2 h on a rocking or rotating platform. After 2 h, remove the secondary antibody solution and wash the coverslips 3x for 10 min each with PBS.\nWash the coverslips in double-deionized water (DDW) for 10 min. Remove the DDW and add 300 µL/well of 0.015% thioflavin-S diluted in 50% ethanol for 10 min. Remove the thioflavin solution and wash the coverslips 2x for 4 min each with 50% ethanol, followed by one 4 min wash with 30% ethanol and two washes for 5 min each with 30% ethanol. Wash the coverslips 1x with DDW prior to mounting.\nNOTE: The thioflavin staining described in step 5.2.4 is optional.\nTo mount the coverslips to glass slides, place a single drop of mounting media on the “+” side of a glass slide. Remove all liquid from the well containing the glass coverslip and, using fine forceps, carefully remove the glass coverslip, keeping track of which side has the cultured cells.",
    "Gently press the edge of the coverslip against a Kimwipe to remove any excess moisture. Still gripping the coverslip with fine forceps, touch the edge (with the cell side facing toward the drop of mounting media) of the coverslip to the mounting media, and then, gently place the coverslip on the mounting media (placing the cultured cells into the mounting media and sandwiching them between the coverslip and the glass slide). Allow the mounting media to harden for 30 min prior to imaging. The slides can be stored at -20 °C for future use.\nImage the cells using a fluorescent microscope and the appropriate excitation/emission spectra (YFP = ~514/527 nm, CY-3 = ~555/568 nm, and thioflavin S = ~390/426 nm).\n6. Optional Methods\nEvery 2 days, collect conditioned media from the cultures and store it at -20 °C for future analyses of tau species released by cultures.\nSubscription Required.
