    "All procedures performed involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the internal review board (IRB) of the Radboud university medical center and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The ORG algorithm is a vendor specific product and is available on the Siemens Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner family and newer PET/CT models.\n1. Patient preparation\nPatient anamnesis\n\t\nCheck the patient’s name and date of birth. Inclusion criteria are similar to routine non-gated PET scanning. No additional in- or exclusion criteria are required.\nCheck the label delivered with the syringe containing the radiotracer (name, date of birth and amount of activity).\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of activity administered to the patient is dependent on the patient’s body mass and can vary between institutions (in this protocol an amount of 3.2 MBq/kg is suggested).\nEnsure that the clinical information on the application form is correct by interviewing the patient. Ask the patient whether there were any recent relevant changes in treatment or medication.\nAsk the patient whether he or she has diabetes mellitus (DM). In case the patient has DM, ask whether he or she followed appropriate preparation (i.e., no administration of short working insulin less than 4 hours prior to the PET scan, or use of blood glucose lowering agents (such as metformin).\nAsk the patient whether he or she has any allergies or uses anticoagulants.\nMeasure the patient’s blood glucose by applying a drop of blood obtained by pricking the side of the fingertip of the patient on a dedicated test strip (the serum glucose should not exceed 11.0 mmol/L).\nExplain the patient preparation and imaging procedures to the patient.\nAdministration of the radiotracer",
    "Secure venous access to the patient by inserting a peripheral venous cannula in one of the antecubital veins.\nAttach a three way stop cock system with Luer lock to a 20 mL syringe containing saline (this is the secondary syringe).\nFlush the three way stop cock system with saline (for the purpose of deaeration).\nAttach the three way stop cock with syringe to the end of the venous cannula.\nCheck whether the venous cannula is patent by carefully flushing 10 mL of saline through the cannula (ask the patient whether he or she has any complaints during flushing).\nAttach the syringe containing the radiotracer (primary syringe) to the three way stop cock. Turn the valves of the three way stop cock so that the flow direction of fluid through the system runs from the syringe containing the radiotracer to the peripheral venous cannula. Administer the radiotracer by slowly pushing the plunger of the syringe (the syringe containing the tracer is placed in a special lead shielded container).\nTurn the valves of the three way stop cock in such a way that the syringe containing saline is connected to the primary syringe (that contained the radiotracer) and flush the syringe to rinse any residual radiotracer from the syringe.\nTurn the valves of the three way stop cock and push the plunger of the primary syringe to administer any residual radiotracer remaining in the syringe to the patient.\nRepeat step 1.2.7. and 1.2.8. three times.",
    "Turn the three way stop cock (to prevent backflow of blood from the patient’s vein) and detach the primary syringe. Attach a third syringe containing furosemide, turn the three way stop cock again and administer 0.5 g/Kg of furosemide (with a maximum amount of 10 mg) by pushing the plunger of the syringe. Remove the peripheral  venous cannula and apply pressure to the puncture site using a sterile bandage. Check whether there is no significant bleeding and from the puncture site and fix the bandage using medical tape.\nPatient incubation\n\t\nLet the patient rest in a comfortable position, preferably in a dimly lit room, for 50 minutes.\nAfter 50 minutes, instruct the patient to void their bladder.\nAt 55 minutes, escort the patient to the scanner and position the patient supine with the arms up on the scanner bed. Use appropriate arm support to make it as comfortable as possible for the patient. If the patient is not able to elevate his or her arms, scanning can be performed with the arms position alongside the patient.\nObserve the patient’s breathing pattern and secure the respiratory belt around the patient’s thorax (usually, the position just beneath the rib cage is optimal). Ensure that the sensor is placed at a location where abdominal wall excursion is identified after visual inspection (usually 5-7 cm from the midline). Secure the belt around the patient by using the Velcro-based closing system.\nCheck on the scanner display whether the respiratory signal remains within bounds of the minimum and maximum range (if the respiratory signal is clipping, fasten or tighten the belt appropriately).",
    "Tip: Make sure the belt is fastened tight enough around the patient’s chest. Given that patients enter a more relaxed state after some time, the respiratory signal tends to drop (baseline drift of the signal). This prevents the signal from going out of bounds, thus maintaining a high quality of surrogate signal that is being used for respiratory gating.\nStart scanning at 60 minutes after incubation time.\n2. Image acquisition and reconstruction\nProtocol selection\n\t\nSelect the whole-body protocol on the scanner. This can be done by moving the cursor over the appropriate protocol category (indicated by the circles next to the patient icon in the examination card), and click on the appropriate protocol (Figure 3).\nThe ORG acquisition protocol will start with a scout scan (topogram) of the patient. To initiate acquisition of the topogram, press the scanner start key (yellow round key with a radiation sign) on the scanner control box (Figure 4). To halt or abort acquisition of the topogram, press the suspend or stop key respectively.\nStart by planning the PET bed positions on the topogram. This can be done by clicking the left mouse button on the topogram and setting the scan range.\nSelect the bed positions which to be corrected for respiratory motion (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: These are the ‘gated’ bed positions that cover the thorax. The ‘gated’ bed positions are recorded in listmode. Depending on the clinical indication, bed positions covering the upper abdomen can also be gated (for example when imaging is indicated for liver or pancreatic lesions). For the non-gated bed positions, it is only necessary to record the sinograms for image reconstruction.\nSet image recording time for the PET bed positions (Figure 5).",
    "NOTE: Depending on the amount of injected activity, scan duration of the non-gated bed positions has to be adapted to yield sufficient image quality. Additionally, the recording time of the non-gated bed positions in combination with the duty cycle being used for image reconstruction of the gated bed positions, the recording time of the gated bed positions is determined. For example, for a duty cycle of 35%, lengthening the scan by factor 3 yields approximately similar statistics for gated and non-gated bed positions. Suggested imaging protocol at the Radboud University Medical Center is a recording time for non-gated bed positions of 2 minutes, whilst for gated bed positions recording time is 6 minutes using a duty cycle of 35%\nAfter setting up the acquisition parameters, press and hold the start key (yellow round button with a radiation sign) on the scanner control box and wait until the scanner bed has moved back to the starting position. Press the start key again to acquire a low dose CT scan from the patient (head to feet). After acquiring the CT scan, press the start key to initiate the PET scan.\nDuring image acquisition, regularly check on the patient and the quality of the respiratory signal (adjust the respiratory belt if required).\n\t\tNOTE: Adjustment of the belt should only be performed when no respiratory gated bed positions are acquired. Therefore, adjustments should be done before or after these bed positions are acquired. Adjustment of the belt during acquisition of the gated bed position will affect the quality of the ORG images. Careful observation of the respiratory signal and possible adjustment of the respiratory belt before acquisition of the gated bed positions is required to counteract any significant baseline drifting of the signal during PET scanning.\nImage reconstruction",
    "Review the respiratory signal that has been acquired and select the appropriate duty cycle for the gated bed positions (Figure 6).\n\t\tNOTE: The amplitude range used for respiratory gating is superimposed on the respiratory signal). Check for inconstancies or baseline drifts in the respiratory signal that can influence quality of the respiratory gating.\nSelect image reconstruction protocol optimized for viewing (Figure 7). This is usually a high-resolution image reconstruction protocol with smaller voxel sizes for detection of small lesions. It is of importance to realize that the ORG algorithm will calculate the optimal amplitude range by using the entire respiratory signal of the selected bed positions. Though different duty cycles can be used for different bed positions (for example to correct for a varying quality respiratory signal), using different duty cycles for different bed positions is not advised given that this will introduce variations in image quality between different bed positions.\n\t\tNOTE: Here is an example image reconstruction protocol for viewing:\n\t\t\nAlgorithm: TrueX + TOF (UltraHD PET)\nNumber of iterations:3\nNumber of subsets: 21\nMatrix size: 400 × 400\nPost-reconstruction filtering, kernel (3D Gaussian), full width half maximum (FWHM): 3.0 mm\nDuty cycle 35%\nFurthermore, reconstruct the PET images with an protocol compliant to the Research4Life (EARL) initiative for quantitative PET imaging. These are usually lower resolution images with specific post-reconstruction filtering applied.\n\t\tNOTE: Here is an example image reconstruction protocol for image quantification:\n\t\t\nAlgorithm: TrueX + TOF (UltraHD PET)\nNumber of iterations: 3\nNumber of subsets: 21\nMatrix size: 256\nPost-reconstruction filtering, kernel (3D Gaussian), full width half maximum (FWHM): 8.0 mm\nDuty cycle 35%\nSend the reconstructed images to the PACS archive. The images are now ready to be evaluated by the nuclear medicine physician\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
