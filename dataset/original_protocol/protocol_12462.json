    "Experiments described in this manuscript were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the University of California, Santa Cruz Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Setup (Also See Materials List)\nUse millet seeds as food pellets.\nUse a custom-made clear Plexiglas training chamber (20 cm tall, 15 cm deep, and 8.5 cm wide, measured from outside, with the thickness of the Plexiglas 0.5 cm) that contains three vertical slits (one slit on 'shaping' edge, and two slits on the opposite 'training' edge). The vertical slits should be 0.5 cm wide and 13 cm tall and be located on the front wall of the box: in the center, on the left side, and on the right side (Figure 1A).\nUse a tilted tray to hold the seeds used during shaping sessions. The tray can be custom-made from three glass slides (Figure 1B).\nPrepare a food platform (8.5 cm long, 4.4 cm wide, and 0.9 cm tall). This food platform is placed in the front side (facing the trainer) of the training chamber during training sessions. There are two divot slots on the food platform for positioning seeds, one slot on the left, and the other slot on the right side. The divots are 0.3 cm from the long edge, and 2.4 cm from the width edge (Figure 1C). The left and right divot slots correspond to the left and right slit in the mouse training chamber and are used for training of dominant forelimbs. The purpose of having these divot slots is to ensure that the seed is placed consistently at the same place for each reaching attempt.\nDuring sessions have in hand a pair of forceps, weighing scale, and stopwatch.\n2. Food Deprivation (2 Days)",
    "Weigh each mouse to obtain a baseline bodyweight before food deprivation.\nFood-restrict mice for 2 days to initiate bodyweight loss. As a general starting point, mice are given 0.1 g of food per 1 g bodyweight per day (e.g. a mouse weighing 15 g, we usually start with 1.5 g of food). Adjust the amount of food based on the baseline bodyweight, the rate of weight loss, sex, and age of mice. While the bodyweight may continue to decrease a little more during the shaping phase, such reduced body weight (i.e. ~90% of the original baseline weight) should be maintained throughout training (Figures 2A and 2B). The amount of food necessary to maintain the mouse's body weight is typically the same as the amount used in restriction.\n3. Shaping (3-7 Days)\nGroup habitat acclimatization (Day 1): Put two mice into the training chamber at the same time. Place approximately 20 seeds/mouse inside the chamber for their consumption. Allow the mice to stay in the chamber for 20 min and then put them back into their home cage.\nIndividual habitat acclimatization (Day 2): The same setup as in step 3.1, but place mice into the training chamber individually. The purpose of group and individual habitat acclimatization is to get the mice familiar with both the training chamber and the millet seeds.",
    "Determination of forelimb dominance (Day 3 and later): Place the single slit side of the training chamber facing downwards (Figure 1D). Fill the food tray with seeds. Press the food tray up against the front wall of the training chamber to allow the seeds accessible to the mouse. Place mice into the cage individually. If they are sufficiently interested in the seeds located on the food tray, they would plow through the slit to get the seed inside. They will then pick up the seeds and consume them. 'Shaping' is considered finished when both of the following criteria are met: 1) the mouse conducts 20 reaching attempts within 20 min, and 2) more than 70% reaches are performed with one forelimb.\nNotes:\nIf the mouse uses its tongue to get the seeds into the chamber, move the tray back from the slit slightly. The increase in reaching distance discourages the mouse to use its tongue to acquire the seed and therefore facilitates its forelimb reaching.\nIf the mouse cannot finish shaping within a week, drop it from the experiment.\n4. Training (8+ Days)\nPlace the double-slit side of the training chamber facing downwards (Figure 1E).\nPlace the mice in the cage individually. Put individual seeds on the food platform in the divot corresponding to the preferred paw (i.e. for the right-handed mouse, use the slit on the mouse's right side).\nObserve mouse reaching behavior and score according to the following categories:\n\t\nSuccess: The mouse reaches with preferred paw, grasps and retrieves the seed, and feeds it into its mouth.\nDrop: The mouse reaches with preferred paw, grasps the seed, but drops it before putting it into its mouth.",
    "Fail: The mouse reaches with preferred paw towards the seed, but it either misses the seed or knocks it off from the holding plate.\nTrain the mice for 30 reaching attempts on the preferred limb or 20 min (whichever comes first) per day.\nPlace the mice back to their home cage after training and provide daily food quantum.\nNotes:\nIn some cases, mice reach even when there is no seed placed on the food platform. Such reaches are considered \"in-vain reaches\" and are not counted towards the total number of reaching attempts. To discourage \"in-vain reaches\", train mice to walk back to the other end of the training chamber before placing the next seed. A similar strategy has been used in rats for a similar behavioral task21. Mice sometimes also reach with nonpreferred paw in the presence of the seed. These reaches are considered 'contralateral reaches' and do not count towards the total number of reaches either.\nTo limit behavioral variations due to the fluctuations in circadian rhythm, perform all shaping and training sessions at the same time of the day, during normal waking hours for mice.\nTo avoid  behavioral variation due to different trainers, make sure the same person trains the same mice throughout the experiment.\nAttention of mice is critical for this behavioral test. Train mice in a separate and quiet room to minimize environmental perturbation.\nMice can be trained with more than 30 reaches daily (e.g. 50 reaches). Increasing the number of reaching attempts makes it possible to examine behavioral improvement within the same training session.\n5. Data Quantification\nThere are many ways to quantify mouse behavior following training. Two most straight-forward analyses are:\nSuccess rate = successful reaches over total reaching attempts, presented as percentages. Drop and failure rates can be plotted the same way.",
    "Speed of success = number of successful attempts divided by time, presented as successful reaches per minute. In most cases, the speed of success continues to increase, even when the success rate attains the plateau.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
