    "Grow an overnight culture of the strains to be assayed, including relevant controls, in 3 ml of the appropriate medium being tested.   Prepare the MIC plate with the drug gradient to be tested.   Always set up the plates in duplicate.   Add 100 µl of the medium to all 96 wells except for column 12 using a multi-channel pipette.   To column 12, add 200 µl of the medium that contains drug at 2x the final concentration that the titration will start at.   Perform 2-fold dilutions by transferring 100 µl of the drug-containing medium from column 12 to column 11 (mix well and repeat across the row). Stop at column 2 and discard the excess 100 µl so that column 1 is the drug-free control.     Measure the OD600 of 100 µl of the overnight cultures in duplicates in a 96 well plate.   Subtract the OD600 reading from medium only wells to account for background.   Calculate the average OD600 for each strain.     To prepare the inoculum in 5 ml of medium, add 1/OD600 x 1.5 µl of the overnight culture.   Add 100 µl of diluted inoculum (~103 cells) to every well from columns 1 to 12, one strain per row.   Incubate the plates statically at the appropriate temperature (35 °C is the standard temperature approved by CLSI standard, 37 °C is a clinically relevant temperature, and 30 °C is a commonly used laboratory temperature) for the desired amount of time, often for 24, 48, or 72 h.   To prepare plates for OD600 reading, mix wells with a multi-channel pipette.   Process the data in Excel.   Copy OD600 values for each drug replicate into a new worksheet.   Above the first row of values, label the drug gradient with the appropriate concentration for each column.   Label the strains in the left-most column.",
    "Calculate the average of medium-only values and subtract it from all values on the plate. Convert any negative numbers to “0”.   Calculate the average of values from each duplicate.   Optional: To normalize growth in the drug gradient relative to its drug-free control, divide the OD600 values of each well by the OD600 value of the well in the column 1 of the corresponding row.   Copy the referenced values to a new worksheet using “paste special”, select “values only” and arrange in the following format.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151019/20151019030120_0930.jpg Note: This data was updated by authors on Oct. 15, 2015.

Growth measured by optical density is quantitatively displayed with color as indicated in the color bar, such that bright green represents full growth and black represents no growth. As indicated above, growth of each strain can be plotted as values normalized to the drug-free control for the same strain, or growth can be directly plotted without normalization."
