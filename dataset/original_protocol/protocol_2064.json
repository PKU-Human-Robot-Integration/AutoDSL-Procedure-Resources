Select the cells by plating them onto an agar plate with 1× kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and incubating the plate overnight for 12–18 h at 37°C.\nPrepare and autoclave 1 L Terrific Broth (TB) media for each protein of interest.\nNext day, pick a single colony and start a 5 mL Luria Broth (LB) overnight culture.\nAdd 1× kanamycin (50 μg/mL) to each culture and grow the cells at 37°C.\nNext morning, use the overnight culture to inoculate a 1 L TB culture. Add 1× kanamycin (50 μg/mL) to the inoculated TB culture and grow the cells at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking.\nMove the culture to a 30°C incubator when absorbance at 600 nm reaches between 0.4 and 0.6. After 30 min, induce protein expression with 0.2 mM IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).\nAfter 4–6 h of protein expression at 30°C, harvest cells by centrifuging the culture at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nIf proceeding immediately to protein purification, resuspend the cells in His binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol or BME) so that the total volume is 50 mL or less. Add a Pierce protease inhibitor tablet (1 tablet per 50 mL) listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Otherwise, freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and store it at −80°C.\nProtein purification day 1.",
    "Lyse cells by sonication in His binding buffer supplemented with a Pierce protease inhibitor table, as described in the previous step.\nAn amplitude of 60% was used to sonicate the cells for 5 s followed by 5 s of pause, for the total pulse time of 20 min.\nClear the lysate by centrifuging at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTake supernatant and load onto a 5 mL HisTrap column using an AKTA FPLC system and a 50 mL Superloop. Specific purification columns used in the original study are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nNote: Other methods such as Ni resin and gravity columns would also work.\nWash thoroughly with at least 4 column volumes (CV) of His binding buffer.\nElute with His elution buffer (His binding buffer with 400 mM imidazole).\nPool elution fractions and dilute 2-fold using Q binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM Dithiothreitol or DTT) to reduce the salt concentration to around 100 mM.\nFor Pab1, load the sample to a Heparin column to remove RNA. For Hsp104 and Hsp40, load the sample to a HiTrap Q anion exchange column.\nWash thoroughly with at least 4 CV of Q binding buffer.\nElute proteins from both Heparin and Q columns with a 20 mL gradient from 0 to 100% Q elution buffer (Q binding buffer with 1 M KCl).\nPool elution fractions and add an aliquot of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Tropea et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to Pab1 or SUMO protease Ulp1 (Malakhov et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) to Hsp104/40 to remove the purification tag.\nUsing a 10 kDa cutoff SnakeSkin dialysis tube, dialyze proteins with the appropriate protease overnight for 12–18 h at 4°C in 1 L of His binding buffer.",
    "Protein purification day 2.\nTo remove uncleaved protein, load the dialyzed sample through a HisTrap column and collect flow-through.\nConcentrate the sample using a spin concentrator and load the sample onto a size exclusion column equilibrated in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT).\nPool fractions containing protein of interest, concentrate, and freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C. Concentration was measured using Bradford assay with BSA standard.\nPurification of Hsp70\nTiming: 4 days\nIn this step, S. cerevisiae Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified.\nNote: S. cerevisiae has four cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones (Ssa1–4). Ssa1 and 2 are constitutively expressed while Ssa3 and 4 are induced upon stress. We specifically chose to work with Ssa2 because it is constitutively expressed and is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp70 in S. cerevisiae (Csárdi et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). However, we have also purified Ssa1 and Ssa4 using this protocol and used them to disperse Pab1 condensates in the original study (Yoo et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nExpress protein.\nTransform BL21(DE3) competent cells with a plasmid encoding 6×His-(SUMO)-Ssa2 (pHY024). This plasmid has a kanamycin resistance cassette. Select the cells by plating them onto an agar plate with 1× kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and incubating the plate overnight for 12–18 h at 37°C.\nPrepare and autoclave 2 L TB media.\nNext morning, pick multiple colonies and use them to start a 25 mL LB culture with 1× kanamycin. Grow the cells at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking until absorbance at 600 nm reaches between 0.4 and 0.6.\nInoculate each of the 1 L TB media with 10 mL of the starter LB culture. Add 1× kanamycin to the TB cultures. Grow the cells at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking.",
    "Move the cultures to an 18°C incubator when absorbance at 600 nm reaches between 0.4 and 0.6. After 30 min, induce protein expression with 0.2 mM IPTG.\nAfter 14–18 h of protein expression at 18°C, harvest cells by centrifuging for 15 min at 3,000 g, at 4°C.\nNote: We recommend immediately lysing the cells and starting Hsp70 purification.\nHsp70 purification day 1.\nResuspend the cells in Hsp70 His binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 750 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM BME, and 1 mM ATP) supplemented with a Pierce protease inhibitor tablet listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] (1 tablet per 50 mL).\nLyse cells by sonication.\nWe used an amplitude of 60% for 5 s of sonication followed by 5 s of pause, for the total pulse time of 20 min.\nClear the lysate by centrifuging at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTake supernatant and use a 5 mL HisTrap column to bind His-tagged Ssa2.\nWash thoroughly with at least 5 CV of Hsp70 His binding buffer.\nEquilibrate the column with Hsp70 His binding buffer supplemented with 20 mM ATP. Incubate the column and the bound protein in this high ATP buffer for at least 30 min at 4°C to saturate Hsp70 with ATP and promote substrate release from Hsp70.\nWash the column again with at least 4 CV of Hsp70 His binding buffer.\nElute Hsp70 with Hsp70 His elution buffer (Hsp70 His binding buffer with 400 mM imidazole).\nPool elution fractions and use a 10 kDa cutoff SnakeSkin dialysis tube to dialyze the sample against 1 L Hsp70 binding buffer for at least 2 h at 4°C to reduce imidazole concentration. High imidazole concentration can inhibit protease activity.",
    "Add an aliquot of SUMO protease Ulp1 to the dialysis bag.\nDialyze overnight for 12–18 h at 4°C in a 1 L Hsp70 His binding buffer.\nHsp70 purification day 2.\nLoad the dialyzed sample through a HisTrap column and collect flow-through.\nReduce salt concentration to below 100 mM by repeatedly concentrating and diluting the sample in Hsp70 Q binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP).\nLoad the sample to a HiTrap Q anion exchange column.\nElute Hsp70 over a 50 mL gradient from 0 to 100% Hsp70 Q elution buffer (Hsp70 Q binding buffer with 1 M KCl). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Hsp70 often elutes in a broad single peak with a left shoulder or sometimes in two separate peaks around 25 mS/cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Both peaks contain Hsp70, but only the later peak fractions exhibit activity in luciferase reactivation and Pab1 condensate dispersal assays. We recommend saving all elution fractions from this step and testing Hsp70 activity against Pab1 condensates and/or luciferase aggregates (Glover and Lindquist, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Nillegoda et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) in each fraction before combining fractions. This step can be done once to optimize the protocol and skipped in subsequent preparations.\nPool fractions containing active Hsp70 and buffer exchange into Hsp70 storage buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1656-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A representative elution profile of Hsp70 from the anion exchange column\nHsp70 eluted in a peak around 25 mS/cm (solid arrow) with a left shoulder (dashed arrow). Only the elution fractions belonging to the main peak (solid arrow) were collected.",
    "Concentrate the protein if necessary and freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C. Concentration was measured using Bradford assay with BSA standard.\nNote: Because the storage buffer contains 1 mM ATP, absorbance at 280 nm cannot be used to determine Hsp70 concentration.\nPreparation of Pab1 condensates\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, we make small Pab1 condensates by exposing purified Pab1 monomers to the same heat shock condition that we use to stress yeast (Yoo et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Upon exposure to heat, Pab1 undergoes autonomous demixing to form stable condensates (Riback et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). We isolate small Pab1 condensates from the remaining monomers using size exclusion chromatography.\nPab1 monomers were buffer exchanged into aggregation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT) and diluted to make a 500 μL sample of 25 μM Pab1.\nNote: This sample was sometimes supplemented with 0.25 μM firefly luciferase to increase yield (Yoo et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). About 30% of Pab1 elutes as condensates in the absence of luciferase and this increases up to 60% in the presence of luciferase.\nIncubate the sample in a 42°C water bath for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the sample for 3 min at 8,000 g at 4°C.\nNote: At pH 6.8, the sample remains clear after heat shock and no or minimal pelleting is observed.\nLoad the supernatant onto a Superose 6 10/300 size exclusion column equilibrated with storage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT).\nCollect 0.25 mL fractions. Small Pab1 condensates elute in the void volume (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1656-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Pab1 condensates eluted in the void volume shaded in gray. The molecular weight cutoff for elution in the void volume is 5,000 kDa in Superose 6 10/300. The figure was adapted from Yoo et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] with permission from the authors.\nMeasure Pab1 condensate concentration in each fraction using Bradford assay with a BSA standard and/or SDS-PAGE with Pab1 monomer standards of known concentrations. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Typical Pab1 condensate concentration in a fraction ranges from 0.5 to 2 μM. Attempts to further concentrate condensates by dialysis or spin concentration led to sample loss.\nFreeze protein aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C.\nNote: Although Pab1 condensates remain stable after thawing, we recommend making small aliquots and avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nPreparation and execution of Pab1 condensate dispersal reactions\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, we mix varying concentrations of Pab1 monomers with a fixed concentration of labeled poly(A) RNA to get a calibration curve. We then mix Pab1 condensates with molecular chaperones, ATP, and labeled 19-mer poly(A) RNA to start the dispersal reaction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Because Pab1 condensates have a much reduced RNA binding activity compared to Pab1 monomers, condensate dispersal is monitored by the change in fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled RNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1656-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Overview of the dispersal assay\n(A) Pab1 condensates are mixed with molecular chaperones and fluorescein-labeled 19-mer poly(A) RNA.\n(B) Fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled RNA is measured as a function of time in the absence or presence of ATP. In the absence ATP, the labeled RNA remains unbound and this results in low fluorescence anisotropy. In the presence of ATP, chaperones disperse Pab1 condensates back to Pab1 monomers, which then bind the labeled RNA and cause an increase in fluorescence anisotropy.",
    "Note: Pab1 binds 12-mer poly(A) RNA with full affinity and has a footprint of roughly 25 nucleotides (Sachs et al., 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). We used 19-mer poly(A) RNA to promote 1:1 binding of Pab1 monomer to RNA.\nSet up calibration samples as shown in the table below.\nThe working stocks of Pab1, ATP, and RNA were kept on ice. The 1× disaggregation buffer and the mixed calibration samples were kept at room temperature.\nMake a master mix to minimize error. Each sample is 15 μL.\nSamples can be mixed in an Eppendorf tube and transferred to a well in a 384-well plate, or mixed directly in the well. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1656_3.csv\nSet up Pab1 condensate dispersal reaction samples as shown in the table below.\nThe working stocks of all proteins, ATP, RNA, SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor, and the ATP regeneration system (creatine kinase and creatine phosphate, or CK and CP) were kept on ice. The 1× disaggregation buffer was kept at room temperature.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1656_4.csv\nNote: Add the key component(s) last to minimize downtime. In this example, ATP is added last.\nNote: Pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cannot be used as an ATP regeneration system in this assay because PK binds RNA.\nNote: We have noticed and confirmed using western blot that we lose about 50% of Pab1 condensates during transfer, likely due to adsorption to plastic surfaces. To compensate for this loss, we set up each reaction with twice the target concentration of Pab1 condensates. For example, in the table above we aim the final concentration of Pab1 condensates to be around 0.2 μM by beginning with 0.4 μM Pab1 condensates. The actual amount of Pab1 in each well can be estimated during data analysis using the calibration curve.",
    "Note: Concentrations of Hsp104 and Sis1 are in terms of hexamers and dimers, respectively.\nAdd 15 μL of 1× disaggregation buffer to a well as a blank buffer control.\nSeal the wells with a low autofluorescence microplate sealing tape listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] to prevent sample evaporation.\nMeasure fluorescence anisotropy of all samples using the setting described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Troubleshooting 3–5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nWhen the measurement is done, save the data and take the plate out of the plate reader."
