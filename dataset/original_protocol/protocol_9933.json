    "1. Preparation of AWS\nNOTE: This protocol was developed using one acoustophoretic chamber. However, the bench-scale AWS has five turbidity probes that can operate 4 acoustophoretic chambers in series if needed.\nConnect the turbidity cables into their respective ports labeled as F, 1, 2, 3, 4 (e.g., turbidity probe 1 in Figure 1c and port 1 in Figure 2a) and the chamber power BNC cables to the back of the AWS system labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4 (Figure 2b).\n\tNOTE: Do not connect the other end of the chamber power BNC cable (Figure 3c) to the back of the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 3d) until step 2.6 when the chamber is filled with fluid. If the chamber power is turned on with no fluid in the chamber, it will damage the piezo transducer in the chamber and no longer function.\nInsert the turbidity probes into the turbidity meter and thermometer housing and tighten the screws (Figure 1c and Figure 3).\nConnect the feed tubing to the input of the feed turbidity port (Figure 4a) via the feed pump (Figure 1b to 1c).\nConnect the y-tubing from the output of the feed turbidity port (Figure 4b) to the inlet ports of the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 4c).\nConnect the stage1 tubing from the waste port of the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 4d) via the stage1 pump to a cell collection vessel (Figure 1d via 1e to 1f).\nConnect the tubing from the permeate port of the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 4e) to the input of probe1 turbidity port (Figure 4f).\nConnect the harvest tubing from out of the probe1 turbidity port (Figure 4g) to a product collection vessel (Figure 1c to 1g).\n2. Prime the system with HCCF",
    "NOTE: This protocol was developed using CHO-K1 cells cultured in chemically-defined medium (ActiCHO P with 6 mM L-glutamine) producing the model IgG1 monoclonal antibody VRC0113 and may need to be adjusted for other cell lines and products. The HCCF used in this protocol was obtained at the end of 7–8 days of CHO-K1 cultures from a shaking flask or bioreactor process.\nTurn on the AWS by turning on the power switches on the back and front of the AWS.\nTurn on the computer and double-click the desk icon for the associated software (see Table of Materials). From the “Readings” panel, press the “Start Test” button to initiate data recording (Figure 5). Once data recording is initiated, all data collected will be recorded in an exportable spreadsheet until the test is stopped.\nConnect the feed tubing end into the HCCF vessel being stirred.\nStart the feed pump by entering the pump rate on the “Controls” screen within the “Feed Pump Image” and press “Enter” on the keyboard. Ensure that the “Pump Direction Arrow Icon” (clockwise or counterclockwise) is correctly selected in the gray box to the right of the Feed Pump Image to pump HCCF from the vessel into the acoustophoretic chamber. Click on the “Triangle Icon” next to the words “Turn ON” within the gray box under the Feed Pump Image to “Start” the pump (Figure 6a).\n\tNOTE: The maximum pump rate is 10 L/h (167 mL/min), but it is recommended that the nominal flow rate, 60 mL/min, be used for this step to quickly fill the tubing and chamber without risking overfilling the chamber prior to beginning the separation.",
    "Monitor the feed turbidity measurements by observing the “Percent Reduction Panel” (Figure 5c) during the filling of the acoustophoretic chamber. The turbidity values will remain consistent during the loading of the chamber if the HCCF is being mixed sufficiently in the HCCF vessel.\nOnce the liquid is above the piezo transducer at the back of the acoustophoretic chamber, press “Turn OFF” within the gray box under the Feed Pump Image to stop the pump. Connect the BNC power cable (Figure 3c) to the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 3d).\n\tNOTE: The holdup volume of each acoustophoretic chamber is around 190 mL.\n3. Operation of AWS\nOnce the acoustophoretic chamber is filled and the BNC power cable is connected to the back of the acoustophoretic chamber, change the rate of feed pump to the desired operating rate (Figure 6a and Table 1). Several feed pump rates should be tested to identify the ideal operating parameters for a given process.\nTurn on the stage1 piezo power by sliding the bar in the power module to 10 W (Figure 6d) and pressing the “Turn ON” icon on the right side of the Stage 1 box (Figure 6c). As suggested by the manufacturer, use 10 W, the recommended power setting for CHO cells. This will generate a fixed frequency of 2 MHz for operation. After several seconds, the cells will start to visibly clump at the wave nodes in the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 7a).",
    "Once the cells begin to settle to the bottom of the acoustophoretic chamber (Figure 7b), start the stage1 pump with an appropriate rate based on the cell density and feed pump rate (Figure 6b). Based on the manufacturer’s optimization and steady-state operation spreadsheet, the stage1 pump rate can be calculated based on the packed cell mass and feed flow rate using the following equation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61161/61161equ01.jpg\nTo calculate packed cell mass, tare a scale with an empty 15 mL tube (or other tube compatible with centrifugation). Fill the tube with feed material and record the total weight of the tube with feed. Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 3,700 x g. Decant the supernatant into a separate container. Measure the weight of the tube with the cell pellet. The packed cell mass percentage of the feed material = (decanted tube weight/filled tube weight) x 100%.\nMonitor the turbidity profile of stage1 turbidity as the overflow from the acoustophoretic chamber enters the turbidity probe1 (Figure 8).\nAs the cell separation continues, cell removal efficiency imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61161/61161equ02.jpg will increase.\nIn addition, monitor the temperature difference between feed and stage1 as it will increase as the cell separation continues (Figure 9). The temperature may rise when higher cell density feed is used but can generally be reduced by altering the feed flow rate.\n\tNOTE: When using multiple acoustophoretic chambers, one can sequentially connect the tubing from the previous acoustophoretic chamber via turbidity probes to the input of the current acoustophoretic chamber. In addition, one can connect stage tubing from the bottom of the acoustophoretic chambers via stage pumps to cell collection vessels. A total of four acoustophoretic chambers can be connected in series for optimal cell removal efficiency if necessary.\n4. Ending AWS",
    "When the run is over, stop the feed and stage1 pump by pressing Turn OFF within the gray box under the feed pump and stage1 pump images, respectively, to stop the pumps.\nTurn off the power to the chamber by pressing Turn OFF on the right side of the Stage 1 box and disconnect the BNC power cable.\nTake the product harvest material collected for further clarification and purification procedures, such as depth filtration and chromatography methods. Discard the cell harvest material.\nDrain the remaining fluid in the acoustophoretic chamber by placing the waste tubing into an empty vessel, disconnecting the tubing from the acoustophoretic chamber inlet and permeate ports and releasing the waste tubing from the pump head.\nReconnect the tubing, place the waste tubing back into the pump head, and flow through DI water from the end of feed tubing using a feed pump rate of 60 mL/min and stage1 pump rate of 60 mL/min. Continue for 15–20 min. Discard the flow through.\nPump 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) through the tubing and the chamber using the feed pump for 15–20 min. Discard the flow through.\nRepeat cleaning procedure with DI water to clear the tubes and the chamber by using the feed pump for 15–20 min. Discard the flow through.\nDisassemble the tubing from the turbidity probes and acoustophoretic chambers and clean the area with 70% IPA.\nDisassemble the turbidity probes and clean inside the turbidity probes with 70% IPA. Let all parts air dry and then reassemble for the next use.\n\tNOTE: The acoustophoretic chambers are manufactured for single use but can be reused if handled and cleaned properly as described in this protocol."
