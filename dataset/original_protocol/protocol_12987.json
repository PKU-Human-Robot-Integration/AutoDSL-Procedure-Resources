    "The overall workflow of the protocol is described in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of the sample chamber\nSlide and coverslip cleaning\n\tNOTE: These steps aim to clean the surfaces of the slides as well as the coverslips and prepare them for aminosilanization. One critical requirement for conducting single-molecule fluorescence experiments on surface-tethered molecules is a passivated surface. The most reliable and reproducible passivation technique involves covalently attaching inert polymer chains to the glass surface as a dense layer. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most efficient polymer used for surface passivation16. The details of the passivation procedure using PEG (PEGylation) are described below:\n\t\nMark holes to be drilled on the slides with a marker (~6 mm apart and away from the edge). Use a Dremel to drill small holes (1 mm diameter) on the glass slide. Immerse the slides in water during the drilling process.\nWash the slides with acetone to remove residual ink from the marker.\nRemove from acetone and rinse the slides with water, then microwave them for 5 min in water at high power (700 W).\nClean the slides with water before placing them in a glass staining jar to be sonicated. Place the coverslips in a different staining jar.\nSonicate the slides and coverslips in acetone for 30 min in a bath sonicator at 23 °C.\nIn the meantime, clean a glass flask for preparing the aminosilanization solution used during the next step. Fill the flask with 1 M KOH, sonicate the flask for 30 min, thoroughly rinse out the KOH with water, and then sonicate for an additional 30 min in methanol. Leave the flask in methanol until the time of the aminosilanization step.",
    "In the meantime, remove the aminosilane, mPEG, and biotin-PEG from the freezer (−20 °C) and allow them to come to room temperature (RT) in the dark.\nDispose of acetone from the slide and coverslip jars in the appropriate chemical waste container, rinse thoroughly with water, and then sonicate the slides in 5 M KOH for 30 min.\nRinse the slides and coverslips with water, and then sonicate in methanol for 2 min (repeat twice). Leave the jars filled with methanol until the aminosilanization step.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, deionized water is used unless otherwise mentioned. A bath sonicator working at 23 °C is used.\nAminosilanization\n\tNOTE: This step aims to covalently link aminosilane to the clean slide and coverslip surface. Functionalized mPEG and biotin-PEG will covalently bind to this surface in the next step.\n\t\nPrepare an aminosilanization mixture in a clean flask (step 1.6). Prepare the solution by mixing methanol (150 mL), acetic acid (7.5 mL, use glass pipette), and aminosilane (2.5 mL).\nMix the solution gently in the chemical fume hood, then pour it into the slide and coverslip jars. Use 50 mL for the coverslips and 100 mL for the slides. Ensure slides and coverslips are fully immersed in the solution.\nIncubate for 10 min, then sonicate the jars for 1 min (sonication removes the impurities from the surface), and incubate for another 10 min.\nDispose of aminosilanization solution in the waste collection container. Add methanol to the jars, close the jars with lids, and shake gently by hand. Dispose of the methanol, and fill jars with water.\nReturn the aminosilane bottle to the freezer (−20 °C).\nPEGylation\n\tNOTE: These steps describe the PEGylation procedure.",
    "During aminosilanization, prepare the pegylation buffer. Weigh 84 mg of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and add it to 10 mL of water (10 mM). In addition, weigh mPEG and biotin-PEG and set them aside. For six slides and coverslips, use 96 mg of mPEG and 1.2-2.4 mg of biotin-PEG.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important not to add too much biotin-PEG since it can increase the number of background spots. Do not dissolve the PEG mixture until right before application to slides.\nRinse the slides with water, dry them with a gentle air blow, and then place them in the humidified assembly boxes.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential to use a clean airline. Avoid using compressed canned air, which can leave residues on the glass.\nAdd pegylation buffer to PEG powder mixture and pipette up and down gently multiple times to dissolve. Add 55 µL of pegylation buffer per slide (for six slides, add 330 µL of pegylation buffer).\nCentrifuge at 9,600 x g for 1 min at 23 °C to precipitate undissolved particles. Collect the supernatant to use in the next step.\n\t\tNOTE: Biotin-PEG hydrolyzes quickly due to the presence of the NHS group. It is important to do the mixing and centrifugation steps quickly.\nApply 60 µL of PEGylation solution to each slide and then place the coverslip on top so that the PEGylation solution is sandwiched between the slide and the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid introducing bubbles between the slide and coverslip, as this will reduce the passivation efficiency. Remove any bubbles by adjusting the coverslip and the slide with a pipet tip.\nPlace the slides in a drawer that is flat and dark. Slides can be stored overnight; however, incubation for 4-6 h results in optimum passivation.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential to remember which side is pegylated.",
    "Mark the non-pegylated side before storage. After incubation, gently disassemble and rinse the slides and coverslips thoroughly with water\nDry the slides and coverslips by blowing air. Keep the slides and coverslips in a sterile tube (50 mL), with the PEGylated surface facing away from each other. Store at −20 °C until the day of the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best to use slides and coverslips within 4 weeks of preparation. The PEGylated surfaces should face away from each other. Storing the PEGylated slides and coverslips in vacuum-sealed bags can increase their shelf life.\n2. mGluR2 expression with incorporated unnatural amino acid, fluorescent labeling, and extraction\nNOTE: This protocol outlines the preparation, reagents, and treatment of cells for expressing mGluR2 containing the UAA 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AZP). The procedure is for HEK293T cells grown on 18 mm glass coverslips. The procedure can be scaled up as necessary.\nSeeding\n\tNOTE: Maintain the HEK293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 unit·mL−1 penicillin-streptomycin, and 15 mM HEPES buffer (Supplementary File 1) (pH 7.4) at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\n\t\nPassage the cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Seed HEK293T cells on poly-L/D-lysine (PLL/PDL) glass coverslips so that they reach ≥80% confluency during the time of transfection.\nTransfection\n\t\nPrepare a 40 mM stock solution of AZP in 0.1 M NaOH.\nPrepare AZP-supplemented media for growing cells and mGluR2 expression. Supplement standard media (+ FBS, pen/strep, 15 mM HEPES) using 40 mM AZP stock solution. Bring the final AZP concentration to 0.6 mM. Add 1 M HEPES solution (half the volume of 40 mM AZP stock solution added). For example, to prepare 10 mL of AZP supplemented media, combine 9.775 mL of standard media, 150 µL of 40 mM AZP stock solution, and 75 µL of 1 M HEPES solution.",
    "Filter (sterilize) the media using a syringe filter (0.2 µm, PES).\nReplace the standard media with media containing AZP-supplemented media prior to transfection.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to dry the cells during the replacement of the media.\nTransfect the cells with transfection reagent (Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's manual. Transfect HEK293T cells on an 18 mm coverslip using a total of 2 µg of DNA (1000 ng of tRNA/synthetase + 1000 ng of amber codon-containing protein plasmid). Refer to Table 1 for the concentration and volume of components used.\nChange the media 24 h after transfection to fresh AZP-supplemented media and allow the cells to grow for an additional 24 h.\nLabeling with alkyne cyanine dyes\n\t\n20 min before labeling, wash the coverslips with warm (37 °C) recording buffer (RB) (Supplementary File 1) twice, and move them to warm (37 °C) standard media with no AZP (+ FBS, Pen/Strep, 15 mM HEPES).\nPrepare the labeling solution containing Cy3-alkyne, Cy5-alkyne, BTTES, copper (II) sulfate (CuSO4), (+) sodium L-ascorbate, and aminoguanidine.\nFollow the order of making and adding solutions (Table 2):\n\t\t\nPrepare 50 mM BTTES.\nPrepare 100 mM aminoguanidine.\nPrepare 100 mM Na-ascorbate.\nPrepare 655.5 µL of RB.\nAdd Cy3/Cy5 alkyne dye (10 mM in DMSO stock) to the RB.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Add aminoguanidine to the RB.\nPrepare 20 mM CuSO4.\nMix CuSO4 and BTTES in a new tube (the solution will turn blue).\nAdd the CuSO4 and BTTES mixture to RB (2.3.3.6.)\nAdd the Na-Ascorbate.\nFollow the volume given in Table 2 below for an 18 mm coverslip.\nMix the solution thoroughly and incubate on ice and in the dark for 10 min prior to labeling cells.",
    "Before adding the labeling solution to the coverslips, remove the media and wash them with RB. Add the labeling solution and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C in dark conditions.\nNOTE: To improve labeling, add glutamate (final concentration ~0.5 mM) after 10 min and incubate for an additional 5 min. Copper is very toxic to the cells, and the labeling reaction should not continue for more than 15 min in vivo. Prepare all the components fresh. Add Na-Ascorbate last. Keep the reaction at 4°C while preparing. However, upon the addition of labeling solution, the cells are to be stored at 37 °C inside the incubator.\nHarvesting the cells and extracting the proteins (cell lysis)\n\t\nRemove the labeling solution and wash the coverslip (18 mm) containing the mGluR2 transfected cells twice with the RB.\nUsing a pipet, wash the cells off the coverslip and resuspend in RB (1 mL).\n\t\tNOTE: Minimize the sample exposure to light as much as possible after this point.\nPellet the cells by spinning at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 80-130 µL of the lysis solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell pellet should be visible by eye. The lysis volume depends on the amount of sample lost during the labeling and washing process.\nMix gently by pipetting to break up the pellet. Wrap in foil and place on the rocker at 4 °C for 0.5-1 h to lyse the cells.\nPellet the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 20,000 x g and 4 °C for 20 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh cold tube (the lysed protein that contains the fluorescently tagged protein of interest) and store it on ice for experiments.\n3. Single-molecule flow chamber assembly and functionalization",
    "Remove the slide and the coverslip from the freezer and allow them to warm at RT in darkness (~30 min).\nAssemble the chamber using double-sided tape by sandwiching strips of double-sided tape between the slide and coverslip. Make sure the PEGylated surfaces form the interior of the flow chamber.\nUsing a pipet tip, press the coverslip to ensure the tape is making complete contact with both coverslip and slide; take care not to break the coverslip. Apply epoxy to the edges of the slides.\n\tNOTE: Do not add so much that epoxy fills in the drilled holes.\nPlace the flow chamber with the coverslip side facing downward in a humidified dark box to allow the epoxy to dry (~30 min).\n\tNOTE: Add T50 buffer (Supplementary File 1) through the drilled holes to prevent the epoxy from covering the holes (10-15 µL) during the drying period.\nIncubate each chamber lane with 500 nM Neutravidin (diluted in T50) by slowly applying ~40 µL to each lane.\nIncubate at RT for 2 min inside a humidified dark box. Wash with ~100 µL of T50 buffer per lane.\nIncubate each chamber lane with 20 nM biotinylated antibody11. The choice of antibody depends on the tag on the protein.\n\tNOTE: If the primary antibody is not biotinylated, first incubate with the biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min and then incubate with the primary antibody.\nIncubate at RT for 30 min inside a humidified dark box. Wash with ~200 µL of T50 per lane.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the lanes never dry out during the preparation process.\n4. Single-molecule buffers\nTrolox buffer",
    "NOTE: Trolox buffer is the starting buffer for making imaging buffer. Components of the buffer are dependent on the experiment and may vary depending on the protein of interest. The buffer used in the protocol described here includes salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2), buffering agent (HEPES), and Trolox (pH ~7.35).\n\t\nDissolve 9-10 mg of Trolox in 10 mL of single-molecule recording buffer (SRB, Supplementary File 1)\n\t\tNOTE: Trolox makes the buffer slightly acidic. Adjust the pH at this stage using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, 10 M (pH 7.35). The fine pH adjustment will be made after Trolox is fully dissolved; however, increasing the pH at this point increases the solubility of the Trolox.\nMix the solution at RT using a benchtop rocker for 4-8 h (wrapped in aluminum foil) to fully dissolve the Trolox.\nCheck the pH and adjust if needed.\nEnsure the Trolox is fully dissolved. Sterilize the solution with a syringe filter and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The buffer should be used after 2-10 days of aging. Trolox helps to suppress blinking and is commonly used in single-molecule studies17. The anti-blinking properties come from an oxidized derivative of Trolox18; hence, it is recommended to keep it at RT for at least a few hours to mature. Additionally, UV radiation of fresh Trolox solution speeds up the oxidation process and can be used to accelerate the \"aging\" of Trolox buffer18.\nImaging buffer recipe: Mix Trolox buffer + detergent (~2 times the detergent's CMC value) + 4 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA).",
    "NOTE: The detergent concentration is kept near CMC as high detergent concentrations may result in increased protein denaturation. For example, the following mixture can be used 955 µL Trolox + 5 µL 10% DDM + cholesterol (W%, 10:1) + 40 µL of 100 mM PCA stock solution. Here, PCA acts as an antioxidant agent and was previously used in smFRET studies19. DDM is non-ionic, is commonly used to solubilize membrane proteins20,21, and has been used in single-molecule studies. DDM is a good first choice detergent; however, we recommend testing multiple detergents and ensuring the results are consistent.\n5. Microscope setup and smFRET data acquisition\nTurn on the computer and microscope. Turn on the lasers to warm up (532 nm for Cy3 excitation and 640 nm for Cy5 excitation).\n\tNOTE: Here, an inverted microscope equipped with a 100x TIRF objective (N.A. 1.49), image splitter, and EMCCD camera was used. The setup is equipped with a four-line laser combiner, a dichroic mirror, a long pass emission filter, an emission dichroic filter, and a notch filter.\nTurn on the EMCCD camera and open the camera software. Wait 20 min for the camera to reach −69 °C and stabilize.\nMount the sample chamber on the microscope stage. Add the protein sample gradually to achieve ~400 molecules per field of view (step 2.4.5). Wash the chamber with 100 µL of the imaging buffer.\nAdjust the gain, acquisition rate, and laser powers such that single-molecule fluorescence signals are detected in both the donor and acceptor channels. Adjust the concentration of the proteins inside the sample chamber if needed.\n\tNOTE: With more than 400 molecules in the field of view, distinguishing individual molecules becomes more difficult, and the background noise will be higher.",
    "Excite the donor and acquire time traces until at least 80% of the donor molecules in the field of view are photobleached.\nAt the end of the movie, turn on the 640 nm laser to directly excite the acceptor until some of the acceptor molecules photobleach, facilitating single-molecule from multimer discrimination.\nMove over to a different field of view and repeat the steps above to collect at least three movies (technical replicates) per condition.\n\tNOTE: Use the lowest laser power possible while selecting a new region of interest (ROI) and focusing to minimize photobleaching. Pay attention to the stage drift during acquisition. If noticeable drift is observed after moving to a new ROI, wait for 3 min before starting acquisition.\n6. Data analysis\nDonor and acceptor channel alignment (movie mapping)\n\t\nRecord the fluorescent bead images in the donor and acceptor channels.\nGenerate the mapping file using the bead data to correlate the donor and acceptor fluorescence from each molecule22,23.\n\t\tNOTE: The emission signal from a single molecule is split into donor and acceptor signals by the emission dichroic filter inside the image splitter. The donor and acceptor images are projected on the camera side-by-side. To accurately associate the donor and acceptor intensities of a single molecule between the two areas, a mapping file is often generated using fluorescent bead samples. Using this mapping file, all the molecules that are detected in the donor and acceptor channels are mapped onto each other. The analysis then generates the time traces, which are the donor and acceptor intensities over time, for each molecule.\nSelection of single-molecule FRET traces (particle picking)",
    "NOTE: Individual particle traces are examined and selected for downstream analysis using MATLAB. The exact selection criteria depend on the system. General guidelines on what constitutes a quality particle are outlined here. All the custom-modified codes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/vafabakhsh-lab).\n\t\nSelect the traces where the total intensity of the traces (donor + acceptor) is stable over time. Select the traces with anti-correlated changes in donor and acceptor intensities.\nSelect the donor and acceptor molecules that show single-step photobleaching. Select the traces that are >5 s long.\n\t\tNOTE: The background in each channel after bleaching should go to zero. The traces should not have many blinking events; this will increase the difficulty of analysis.\nCalculate the FRET efficiency using the equation E = (IA− 0.088 × ID)/(ID + [IA− 0.088 × ID])24,25,26, where ID and IA are raw donor and acceptor intensities, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: The leakage of donor emission into the acceptor channel is determined using donor-only labeled sample excited using a 532 nm laser26. The leakage correction factor, 0.088, may differ for different setups depending on the filter sets used. It is important to note that quantitative and robust conversion of FRET efficiencies to absolute distances requires the correction of donor and acceptor intensities for multiple factors and has been extensively discussed before27.\nIdentify the conformational state by Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM)\n\t\nExecute the vbFRET28 program in MATLAB and import the selected traces for a given condition. Set the constraints for the number of potential states and iterations to be executed.",
    "NOTE: Based on the raw data from the representative results, it was hypothesized that there were up to four discrete FRET states occupied by the conformational sensor; thus, a range of one to four states was designated. Improvements in fitting were previously determined to negligibly increase with >25 iterations; thus, 25 iterations were used for fitting the representative data.\nAnalyze the smFRET traces and export the idealized traces and analysis session. Save the idealized traces to a separate folder for downstream analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: The programs used to extract state transition and dwell-time data from idealized traces were made available in previously published work29.\nUsing MATLAB programs, extract state transitions and plot them as a heatmap with the X-coordinate indicating starting conformation and the Y-coordinate indicating ending conformation.\n\t\tNOTE: Transitions are defined as changes in FRET value >0.1 in the representative results discussed here. The threshold for transitions is dependent on the hypothesized conformational states a protein of interest occupies (set transition threshold to be less than the difference between the closest FRET states), as well as the resolution allowed by the experimental setup. The examination of heatmaps for multiple conditions enables the identification of the most common conformational states a sensor transitions through and, thus, occupies. Four FRET states were identified for the representative results (FRET = 0.31, 0.51, 0.71, and 0.89).\nUsing MATLAB programs, extract the dwell-times for each identified conformational state. Designate a range of FRET values delineating each state and time resolution during data acquisition. FRET ranges are evenly divided by adjacent FRET states. Export the dwell-times for given treatment conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: In most cases, dwell-time data can be estimated well by a single exponential decay function. This analysis can be performed in a data analysis and graphing software.",
    "Gaussian fitting of smFRET population histograms to quantify state occupancy\n\t\nImport population FRET histograms for conditions of interest into the data analysis and graphing software for multiple peak fitting analysis.\nIndicate the number of peaks present (four peaks or states based on HMM analysis). Fitting was performed using multiple Gaussian distributions30 defined as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64254/64254eq01.jpg, where A is the peak area, xc is the peak center, and w is the peak width for each peak.\nConstrain the fitting parameters as A > 0, xc = FRET ± 0.02, and 0.1 ≤w≤ 0.24. Four FRET peaks for individual population FRET histograms were fit simultaneously. Apply the defined constraints for the fittings of all conditions.\nCalculate the state of occupancy (percentage) as the area of peak of interest divided by the total area, defined as the sum of all peaks.\nSubscription Required.
