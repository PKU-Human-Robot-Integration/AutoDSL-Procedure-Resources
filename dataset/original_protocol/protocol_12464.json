    "1. Barnes Maze Procedure for Small Rodents\nTurn on the overhead lights above the maze and place \"Do Not Enter\" signs on the outside of the lab door.\nBring mice in their normal home cages to the test room approximately 30 min prior to beginning the first trial to permit habituation. If the room is quiet, it may not be necessary to include white noise, otherwise this precautionary measure may be considered.\nSet up the tracking program.\nGently remove the first mouse from its home cage and place in the tall covered plastic box. Place its escape (clean home) polypropylene cage (29 cm x 19 cm x 13 cm) under the designated escape hole.\n\t\nEnsure the paper that is blocking the tube is removed from that escape hole and all other holes are plugged.\nDraw curtain around the maze.\nPlace the plastic box with the mouse inside in the maze center and approximately 8 sec later, gently take the animal out of the cage and place it onto the maze.\n\t\nAfter placing the animal in the center of the maze, quietly move to the computer area (~150 cm from the maze).\nInitiate the appropriate tracking software program that should already be open to ensure minimal time (within a few seconds) has elapsed from the time the animal was placed on the maze until the program starts documenting its performance.\nObserve animal's performance from computer monitor and record hole number, trial number, search strategy, and number of errors made. An error is defined as sniffing of an incorrect hole. Assessment of search strategy may be made live or later based on the tracking pattern.\n\t\nSearch strategy is categorized as Direct (going directly into the escape cage with 3 or fewer errors),",
    "Serial (traveling along the maze perimeter until the escape cage is located), or\nRandom (crossing the maze center multiple times to check various holes).\nStop the tracking program when the animal has all four paws inside the escape cage.\nIf the mouse fails to enter the escape cage within 5 min, gently guide it to the correct location and into the escape cage. Let the mouse remain in the escape cage for 2 min.\nRemove mouse from the escape cage and place in home cage.\nSpray the maze top and escape cageÂ with 70% ethanol and wipe dry. Set the first cage/mouse aside for 30 min before running its second trial.\nBefore beginning the next mouse, plug the previously correct escape hole and remove the paper plug blocking the hole from the designated escape hole for that next subject.\nEach mouse is tested for 2 trials/day with an inter-trial interval of approximately 30 min.\nRepeat these steps until all mice have been tested for seven consecutive days, which may increase the likelihood of observing improved performance and/or differences between treatment groups, relative to only four days of data.\n2. Barnes Maze Testing for Rats When a Tracking Program is Not Available\nEnsure the maze is in its correct placement (directly centered below lights), false bottoms that block nonescape holes and prevent the animal from falling out are securely in the maze, and the escape cage is in the designated location for the first subject. Overhead lights above the maze should be turned on.\nEnsure computer and camera are ready and a stopwatch is available.\nTurn on white noise to attenuate any noises from other nearby locations. The tester's chair is approximately 122 cm from nearest edge of the maze top and remains in the same location throughout testing.",
    "A timer (set to 2 min) should be available (only needed on Day 1 of testing). Timer should not \"beep\" or otherwise make noise. Door(s) to test room should have \"Do Not Enter\" sign on outside.\nA test order sheet for the subjects will list the order of subject testing, the session number, the hole number location of the escape cage for each subject, and areas to record latency and time of day for each subject as well as an area for any necessary notes (Figure 6).\nFrom 30-60 min before the first rat is to be tested, bring the animals in their home cages to the test room to allow for habituation.\nThe center tube that the rat is placed into at the beginning of a trial is set in the maze center. Set the cardboard sheet showing the first animal ID on top. This allows the video recording to capture the animal ID for easy identification of each subject by observing the first few seconds of the video.\nInitial Testing Day 1:\nBegin computer video recording (if used) and include approximately 5 sec of the trial with animal ID sheet for subject identification. File name (or date created) will identify day/time of testing.\nRemove the first animal from its home cage (check identity if multiple animals are in cage) and gently place head first into the escape cage. Cover the escape cage with an extra false bottom and start the 2 min timer. This allows the animal to habituate to the escape cage.\nAfter 2 min timer ends, gently remove animal from escape cage (remove false bottom cover as well and set away from maze), lift ID sheet, and immediately place the rat inside the center tube. Cover top of center tube with cardboard ID sheet.",
    "Gently and slowly lift center tube with cardboard cover and set aside. Start the stopwatch as the center tube is lifted above the animal. Move to sit in the tester's chair.\nSit quietly in the chair, watching both the animal and the stopwatch. Each animal has a maximum of 5 min to find the escape cage.\nIf the rat finds the escape cage in less than 5 min, stop the stopwatch and record latency and time of day on test order sheet. Remove animal from escape cage and place back into home cage.\nIf the rat does not find the escape cage within 5 min, gently guide the animal to the escape cage and allow 15 sec to pass before removing and returning the animal to the home cage.\n\t\nThis 15 sec duration can be timed using a clock with a second hand on the test room wall.\nRecord time of day on the test order sheet and record that the rat did not find the escape cage.\nIf the rat falls/jumps off the maze, the tester should glance at stopwatch for time. The tester should then attempt to quickly retrieve the animal.\n\t\nIf this can be done within 10 sec, replace the animal onto the center of the maze and record the time of the fall/jump on the test sheet (if the tester can distinguish between a fall or jump, this should be denoted). Continue the trial.\nIf retrieving the animal takes longer than 10 sec, stop the stopwatch, and put animal back into the home cage. Record time of fall/jump (if the tester can distinguish between a fall or jump, note this).\nData from trials in which an animal fell/jumped and could not be retrieved within 10 sec are omitted from statistical analyses.",
    "Stop video recording on the computer. Record any comments about the trial.\nRemove any urine or feces from the maze top, spray with 70% ethanol, and thoroughly wipe dry. Remove escape cage and clean with 70% ethanol.\nPut a clean escape cage at the designated placement for the next subject. Having more than one escape cage allows each to air-dry to lessen the ethanol odor. Put a clean false bottom at the previous hole (so that all but one hole has a false bottom and that one hole contains the escape cage).\nSet the center tube with ID sheet for the next subject in the maze center. Begin video recording on the computer.\nRemove the next animal to be tested, place into escape cage (if Day/Session 1), and start 2 min timer (only if Day/Session 1). Continue from step 2 above. Each subject receives 1 trial/day.\nAfter all animals are tested, clean the maze and escape cage, turn off overhead lights, and white noise. Remove \"Do Not Enter\" sign(s) from door(s).\nDays 2 through 7 Testing\nSet up test room and maze for testing as detailed above.\nSet center tube in maze center with ID sheet on top. Begin video recording. Remove the first animal from home cage and place into the center tube.\nThis step differentiates Days 2-7 from Day 1; specifically, on Days 2-7, the subject is placed directly into the center tube after removal from the home cage and the 2 min habituation period inside the escape cage is not done.\nRepeat procedure beginning from step 4 above.\n3. Statistical Analyses for Barnes Maze Endpoints\nData analyses may require several statistical tests. Continuous variables, such as latency and error rate, may be analyzed as a split plot in space and time52.",
    "If some animals do not locate the escape or home cage within the maximum allotted time, the latency data can be assigned as the maximum and analyzed by using ProcLife testing in SAS version 9.2 software analysis.\n\t\nThis statistical method is useful for behavioral data in which there is an upper limit cutoff.\nSearch strategy data may be analyzed by using a repeated measure design with PROC GLIMMIX and SAS version 9.2 software analysis.\n\t\nThis first analysis employs a cumulative log it link and a multinomial distribution such that all three search strategies (random, serial, and direct) are included in this analysis.\nTo determine if the animals are learning to use the more efficient search strategy (direct), a second analysis on search strategy can be performed on which the two less efficient strategies (random and serial) are combined and compared against the more efficient direct search strategy.\nThis latter method results in a binomial distribution and also employs PROC GLIMMIX.\nSubscription Required.
