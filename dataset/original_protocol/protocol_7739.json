    "Using sodium borate buffer system to extract zeinsSoak 3-5 mature corn kernels in ddH2O for 10 min, then remove the pericarp and embryo and dry the kernels for 10 min at 37 °C.Grind kernels into powder using a mortar and pestle within liquid nitrogen.Transfer the powder into a 2 ml eppendorf tube. Dry it in Concentrator plus for 1 h till achieve constant weight.Add 1 ml petroleum ether. Vortex and place in the shaker at 250 rpm for 1 h.Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at room temperature (RT), and discard the supernatant.Dry it in Concentrator Plus for 1.5 h until no smell of organic liquid is detectable.Fill a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube with 50 mg dried powder from the step 6.Add 1 ml sodium borate buffer and 20 μl β-mercaptoethanol as well as 1% PMSF. Mix and incubate with shaking at 250 rpm for at least 2 h at 37 °C.Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at RT.Transfer 300 μl supernatant into a new 2 ml eppendorf tube as total protein extraction (Fraction A).Transfer another 300 μl supernatant from the step 9 into a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube, and add 700 μl ethanol as well as 1% PMSF. Mix with shaking at 250 rpm for 2 h at RT.Centrifuge product from step 11 for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at RT.Transfer 400-500 μl supernatant into a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube and dry it in Concentrator plus for 2-3 h. Resuspend it in 200 μl IPG as zein proteins extraction (Fraction B).Wash the precipitate in step 12 with 70% ethanol twice.Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at RT.Discard the supernatant and air-dry the precipitate until the edges become transparent. Resuspend it in 200 μl IPG as non-zein proteins extraction (Fraction C).",
    "Add 10 μl protein extraction from fraction A, or B, or C (see the attached corresponding pictures), 1.5 μl DTT and 3 μl 5x Protein loading buffer in a new 0.2 ml eppendorf tube. Heat 10 min at 99 °C for denaturation.Load 2-5 μl denatured protein sample and perform the SDS-PAGE on a 15% separation gel.Afterwards, the gel is stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130714/20130714184519_5955.pngFigure 1. SDS-PAGE (Fraction A). M represents protein standards with molecular weight ranging from 14,400 to 97,400 Da (similarly hereinafter). This figure shows total proteins extraction. 1, 2, 3, 4 represent four different maize cultivars.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130716/20130716002125_3961.jpgFigure 2. SDS-PAGE (Fraction B). This figure shows zein protein extraction. 1, 2 represent two different maize cultivars (two replicates for each maize cultivar).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130714/20130714184645_5828.pngFigure 3. SDS-PAGE (Fraction C). This figure shows non-zein protein extraction. 1, 2, 3, 4 represent four different maize cultivars.Simple and rapid extraction approachSoak 3-5 mature corn kernels in ddH2O for 10 min, then remove the pericarp and embryo and dry the kernels for 10 min at 37 °C.Grind kernels into powder using a mortar and pestle within liquid nitrogen.Transfer the powder into a 2 ml eppendorf tube. Dry it in Concentrator plus for 1 h till achieve constant weight.Fill a new 2 ml eppendorf tube with 50 mg dry powder from step 3.Add 400 μl 70% ethanol and 8 μl β-mercaptoethanol as well as 1% PMSF.Mix and incubate for at least 2 h at RT. Invert the cube 2-3 times during incubation.Centrifuge for 10 min at 1,300 rpm at RT.Transfer 100 μl supernatant into a new 2 ml eppendorf tube.Add 10 μl 10% SDS, and mix by pipetting.Dry it in Concentrator plus for 1 h.Add 200 μl ddH2O for elution.",
    "SDS-PAGE is performed in 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels are stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130716/20130716001915_0266.jpgFigure 4. SDS-PAGE (zein proteins). This figure shows zein proteins through simple and rapid extraction approach. 1, 2 represent two replicates of same maize cultivar."
