    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare SynCom for inoculation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nWash bacteria to remove antibiotics and other metabolites potentially in the culture media, and then combine into a SynCom for inoculation into MS agar media.\nWash and resuspend bacterial cultures.\nCentrifuge bacteria at 4,000 × g for 15 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant without disturbing bacterial pellet using a pipette.\nResuspend pellets in an equal volume of 10 mM MgCl2.\nFor SynCom experiments: combine strains in a conical tube, centrifuge again at 4,000 × g and resuspend well in 10 mM MgCl2.\nResuspend bacterial cultures to desired OD 600.\nMeasure OD600 of bacterial suspension using a photometer. Be sure to measure a dilution of the suspension within the linear range of your photometer.\nDilute SynCom mixture to OD 600 = 0.1 in 10 mM MgCl2. This stock solution will be used to inoculate growth media. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nFor a heat-killed negative control, incubate an aliquot of bacterial inoculant in a heat block at 99°C for 20 min.",
    "Critical: For complex SynComs with many strains growing in 96-well plates, both the original culture plate and the subcultured plate are combined to capture both slow and fast-growing strains in growth phase. Ensure that all bacteria are pelleted during the centrifugation step. Depending on the bacteria being used, you may need to adjust the centrifugation time. For complex SynComs it is generally not feasible to adjust the OD600 of each strain individually to control the ratios of strains in the input. When working with fewer strains, as in mono-associations, it may be desirable to adjust the OD600 of each strain before combining. Bacteria are resuspended at OD600=0.1, to be used as 1,000× dilution in media (Final OD 600=0.0001, ∼104–105 CFU/mL). This may need to be adjusted for individual bacteria or experimental purposes.\nPour experimental media plates\nTiming: 2–3 h\nMedia are supplied with available or unavailable forms of iron, inoculated with bacteria, and poured into plates.\nAdd iron and pH buffer to base MS media\nAllow autoclaved base MS media (from step 11 above) to cool to ∼50°C.\nPlace media bottle on a magnetic stir plate in a laminar flow hood. Stir at medium speed and add appropriate volume of FeEDTA or FeCl3 solution (stocks are 1,000×).\nContinuing to stir, add necessary volume of HEPES buffer (stock is 200×).\nAllow media to cool in water bath to 42°C–45°C. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nPour experimental plates\nFor each plate, 45 mL of media will be poured into a square 120 × 120 mm petri dish.\nAdd 50 μL of bacterial solution, or heat-killed SynCom negative control, to the bottom of a 50-mL conical tube (for a 1:1,000 dilution). Pour 45 mL of prepared and cooled media into the tube gently to prevent bubbles. Close lid and invert several times to mix.",
    "Pour media into petri dish and allow to dry with lid open for 20 min.\nNote: Once HEPES buffer is added, media should be intermittently stirred on a magnetic stir plate to ensure equal distribution of iron without precipitation.\nPause Point: Experiment can be paused after drying plates for up to several hours before continuing to seedling transfer. After drying, cover plates with lids and leave until ready to continue.\nTransfer plant seedlings\nTiming: 1–3 h\nAxenic seedlings are transferred from germination plates to experimental media plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] ).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/330-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Transfer of seedlings onto experimental media plates\nVisually check germination plates for signs of contamination, which should be apparent by day 5.\nTo transfer, gently remove seedlings from the plate by lifting under cotyledons with a sterile pipette tip or forceps. Avoid damaging the seedlings by overhandling or pinching.\nPlace seedlings (6–8 per plate) in a row near the top of the experimental plates, leaving enough room for shoot growth.\nSeal plates with micropore tape and place vertically in a light chamber with the program: 10 h light, 60–70 PPFD (μmol m−2 s−1) at 21°C/14 h dark, 19°C.\nGrow for 2 weeks, rotating the position of the plates within the growth chamber every 2–3 days to prevent location effects.\nNote: Discard tips used for seedling transfer frequently to avoid contaminations. Always use a new tip when transferring to sterile control plates. Alternatively, if using forceps, sterilize between plates with 70% ethanol.\nEvaluate plant performance\nTiming: 3–5 h\nAfter 2 weeks of growth, evaluate plant performance by shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll measurement.\nUsing a scalpel, cut through micropore tape seal and open plates.",
    "To measure shoot fresh weight (SFW), cut seedlings at the shoot-root junction, being careful not to cut off any leaves. Remove plant shoot with forceps and blot on paper towels to remove from the leaves any water condensation. Record weight of individual plant shoots using a precision scale. Dead plants are recorded as 0.\nMeasure chlorophyll content of a pooled leaf sample from each plate.\nAfter measuring the fresh weight of all plants from a single plate, collect a single leaf from each plant into a 2-mL microcentrifuge tube. Measure tube weight before and after adding sample to record input weight. This should be 20–30 mg of tissue.\nFreeze chlorophyll samples in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C until further analysis.\nExtract chlorophyll by adding 1 mL DMSO to sample tubes and incubating with shaking at 65°C for 45–60 min, until leaf samples are clear and extracted. If the input sample weight was ≥30 mg, increase the amount of DMSO added to compensate.\nMeasure the absorbance at 652 nm of the DMSO extract using a spectrophotometer.\nCalculate the chlorophyll concentration in the extract with the formula ( Hiscox and Israelstam, 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]):\nChlorophyll mg/L = Abs652 ∗ (1000/34.5)\nMultiply the chlorophyll concentration in the extract by the volume of DMSO added (in mL), and divide by the input sample weight (in g) to obtain the plant chlorophyll content (mg/g of fresh weight)."
