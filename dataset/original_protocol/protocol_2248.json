    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of MA modified YM\nTiming: 8 days\nThis step describes how to prepare modified YM by MA. The process is also suitable for other water-soluble polysaccharides to be modified by MA. The protocol was adapted from Huang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nCaution: This process should be done in darkness.\nAdd MA emulsion dropwise into YM solution with magnetic stirring at 100 rpm at 20°C–25°C in darkness in a fume hood. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nKeep the reaction solution at pH8-9 by adding 1 M NaOH in the reaction process.\nNote: If the addition of MA/1×PBS emulsion causes a large change in the pH of the solution, several milliliter of 5 M NaOH can be used to adjust the pH and then switch to a low concentration of 1 M NaOH to adjust the pH to 8–9.\nKeep MA reacting with YM in the reaction solution for eight hours at 20°C–25°C in darkness.\nNote: Under this reaction condition, the degree of functionalization of YM mainly depends on the feed ratio of MA to YM. The higher degree of substitution is obtained with the more mole ratio of MA to YM.\nNeutralize the reaction solution by adding 0.1 M HCl.\nAlternatives: The reaction can also be stopped by adding 5 times the volume of ddH2O to dilute the solution.\nCentrifuge the solution of reaction products to remove insoluble impurities at 3,260 × g for 5 min in 15 mL centrifugal tubes.\nDialyze the reaction product solution with dialysis membrane against 5–10 times volume of ddH2O to remove unreacted MA and byproducts for at least 4 days, and then ddH2O for three times a day.\nCentrifuge the dialyzed product solution to remove insoluble impurities at 3,260 × g for 5 min in 15 mL pointed centrifugal tubes.",
    "Alternatives: If you have a vacuum filter, a filter bottle, a Büchner funnel and filter membranes, you can remove insoluble impurities by pumping as well.\nFreeze the aqueous product at −80°C more than 6 h.\nLyophilize the frozen product for three days.\nCollect and weigh the freeze-dried product, keep the product dry and away from light.

In order to react MA with YM molecules, MA must be fully dispersed in 1×PBS buffer and then added to the stirring mannan solution drop by drop.\nPreparation of YM-MA bioink\nTiming: 20 min\nThis step describes how to prepare YM-MA bioink.

The positive control is methylacryloyl modified gelatin (GELMA) bioink (Klotz et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nAll data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation n = 5.
