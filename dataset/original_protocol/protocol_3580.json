Isolation of exosomes from tumor culture medium\n(A) Illustrative overview of exosome separation.\n(B) 100 kDa MWCO to separate > 100 kDa fraction from tumor culture medium.\n(C) The exosome pellet is brown in appearance.\n(D) Dynamic light scattering analysis of exosomes. PdI, polydispersity index.\n(E) Western blot workflow.\nCulture tumor cells in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted FBS. Collect supernatant of tumor cells after 48 h when cells reach 80% confluency.\nNote: In this protocol, MC38 mouse colon cancer cell line is used.\nRemove cell debris from tumor culture medium (typically 20 mL) by centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. Then transfer supernatant to a sterile 100 kDa MWCO (Molecular Weight Cut Off) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), and centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to discard the faction < 100 kDa, and finally make the concentrated-supernatant (usually 1.5 mL).\nPause Point: Concentrated-supernatant can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months until future use.\nNote: An additional 10,000 × g centrifugation after this step would further increase the purity of exosomes isolated.\nIsolation of exosomes by ExoQuick-TC (EXOTC50A-1, SBI).\nNote: ExoQuick-TC from SBI is a proprietary polymer (PEG, polyethylene glycol) that gently precipitates exosomes between 30 and 200 nm in size from tissue culture media, urine, or spinal fluid. The detailed mechanism of this method can be found in SBI user manual: https://systembio.com/wp-content/uploads/MANUAL_EXOTCXXA-1-1.pdf[href=https://systembio.com/wp-content/uploads/MANUAL_EXOTCXXA-1-1.pdf].\nTransfer concentrated tumor culture supernatant to a sterile vessel and add 1/5 volume of ExoQuick-TC. Mix well by inverting the tube.",
    "Incubation the ExoQuick-TC/supernatant mixture 16–20 h at 4°C. The tubes should not be rotated or mixed during the incubation period and must remain upright.\nNote: Do not vortex or rotate the ExoQuick-TC/supernatant mixture, as it is recommended for PEG-based precipitation of exosomes.\nCentrifuge the ExoQuick-TC/supernatant mixture at 3,000 × g for 30 min. Centrifugation may be performed at either 25°C or 4°C with similar results. After centrifugation, exosomes may appear as a brown pellet at the bottom of vessel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nDiscard the supernatant and centrifuge again at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove the residual fluid.\nResuspend the pellet with about 200 μL 1×PBS to make exosome solution.\nExosome may be quantified by total protein quantification using BCA protein assay kit, or by EXOCET Exosome Quantitation Kit.\nPause Point: Exosomes can be characterized as below and used immediately or stored at −80°C for 3 months.\nNote: Do not vortex but use pipette to handle exosome solution. Avoid repeatedly freeze and thaw exosomes. The diameter of exosomes ranges 40–60 nm accessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and the yield typically ranges 0.5–1 mg exosomes per 1×106 cells based on BCA protein quantification method. Quality control assays of exosomes are routinely performed by DLS and BCA methods during −80°C storage. Within 3 months, the integrity, mean diameter, particle distribution, and concentration of exosomes remain nearly the same as fresh isolation.\nStaining and imaging of exosome by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nFix purified exosomes with 1 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min.\nGlow-discharge the thin formvar/carbon film coated grids for 1 min.\nLoad 5–7 μL exosome suspension (containing 50 μg exosomes) solution on the grid and incubate for 1 min.\nNote: If the concentration of exosome is too high, dilute it to 1/10–1/20.",
    "Stain with filtered 1% uranyl acetate solution on the surface of grid.\nRemove the excess uranyl acetate with filter paper.\nRinse the grid with drop of water to remove the excess staining solution.\nDry for 10 min at 25°C.\nStore grid in a box for future observation by TEM at 80 kV (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nDetection of markers of exosome by western blot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E)\nResuspend 0.2 mg exosome pellet in 200 μL RIPA buffer (with protease inhibitor added) and vortex 15 s.\nPlace at ice for 5 min to allow complete lysis.\nAdd 2×SDS buffer and heat at 95°C for 5 min. Chilled on ice before loading onto gel.\nPerform standard SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and western transfer onto PVDF.\nBlock with 5% milk in Tris buffered saline + 0.05% Tween (TBST) for 1 h.\nIncubate blot 16–20 h at 4°C with exosome specific primary antibody at 1:1,000 dilution (5% milk in TBST).\nWash 3 times with TBST.\nIncubate 1 h at 25°C with secondary antibody at 1:1,500 dilution (5% milk in TBST).\nWash 3 times with TBST.\nIncubate blot with western blotting substrate and visualize on film.\nNote: It is important to note that not all cells produce exosomes with the same composition of tetraspanin markers, therefore not all the exosomal marker proteins (e.g., ALIX, TSG101, CD63, CD9, CD81, etc) could be definitely detected in your samples. However, it is strongly recommended to use some intracellular organelle markers to exclude contaminations of Golgi bodies (GM130), mitochondria (Cytochrome C) or nucleus (Histone H3). In our study, GM130, Cytochrome C, and Histone H3 was excluded to make sure the purity of exosomes(Yin et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nGeneration of TDE-treated DCs in vitro\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step details how to generate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/503-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
