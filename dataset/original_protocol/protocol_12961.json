    "1. Cleaning sequence for all glassware used in surface science experimentation\nScrub the glassware with a concentrated cleaning solution (see Table of Materials) diluted in water (10%).\nRinse thoroughly with a sequence of tap water, propanol, distilled water, and ultrapure water. Dry in a cabin and store in a closed cabinet until use.\n2. Sample preparation\nPrepare artificial digestive media according to INFOGEST standardized protocols11,20 (see Table of Materials).
