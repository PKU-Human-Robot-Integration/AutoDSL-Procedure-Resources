    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransduction and selection of primary keratinocytes\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis step describes the engineering of primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) to express GFP and HPV18 E7. In this example the cells are simultaneously transduced with two vectors: one encoding HPV18 E7 or an empty vector control and the second encoding GFP. Using two vectors alleviates the need to clone the gene or sgRNA of interest into a vector containing a fluorescent marker. It should be possible to engineer the cells using any approach that delivers the modification of interest plus a fluorescent marker gene.\nGenerate GFP and cell modification retroviruses and/or lentiviruses.\nIdentify retroviral or lentiviral vectors of interest.\nExperiment requires GFP-expressing lentivirus or retrovirus, e.g., PHAGE-P-CMVt N-HA GFP.\nExperiment requires positive control lentivirus or retrovirus, such as HPV18 E7 expressing vector, e.g., Addgene #163311.\nOther lentiviruses/test conditions of interest should be determined by individual investigators.\nTransfect suitable 293T cells, e.g., Lenti-X 293T (recommended passage: 10 or lower).\nFor each transfection, seed 2.5 × 106 293T cells into one 6 cm tissue culture dish. Use 293T transfection medium (lacks pen/strep).\nLet cells settle overnight.\nFor each transfection, add 12 μL of Trans-IT 293–400 μL of Opti-MEM. Pipet to mix.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nFor each lentiviral transfection, add 2 μg of lentiviral vector, 1 μg of psPAX2, and 1 μg of pMD2.G. Pipet to mix.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nFor each retroviral transduction, add 2 μg of retroviral vector, 1 μg of pUMVC, and 1 μg of pCMV-VSV-G. Pipet to mix.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nAdd one transfection mix to one 6 cm plate of 293T cells, dropwise. Swirl to mix.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37°, 5% CO2.\nRefeed the 6 cm plates.",
    "Aspirate and disinfect the supernatant on each 6 cm plate.\nReplace with 2 mL of Monolayer Keratinocyte Serum Free Medium.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37°, 5% CO2.\nHarvest lentivirus.\nCollect supernatant containing lentiviral particles.\nFilter supernatant through 0.45 μm syringe filter to remove cell debris.\nFreeze aliquots of supernatant containing lentiviral particles at −80° for up to one year.\nNote: A modified protocol describing retrovirus production can be found in.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Detailed protocols for retroviral and lentiviral transduction are available on the Addgene website.\nPrepare primary HFK cells. A detailed protocol for the isolation and cryopreservation of HFK is in.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nThaw low passage primary HFK (recommended passage: 3 or lower).\nPrimary HFK should be used as soon as possible after initial isolation. We have had the best success with HFKs that were cryopreserved at passage two post-isolation or earlier.\nThe next time the cells are trypsinized and passaged, seed primary HFK for transduction or to maintain passage-matched cells for organotypic culture.\nUsing a 6 well tissue culture plate, seed 5 × 104 cells per well in 2 mL of monolayer keratinocyte serum free medium. Seed one well per cell condition of interest.\nInclude an extra well to use as selection control for each drug-selectable marker being used. In this example the HPV18 E7 and control retroviral vectors confer G418 resistance and the GFP lentiviral vector confers puromycin resistance.\nSeed one 15 cm dish of HFK for every two planned organotypic cultures to use as the passage-matched, parental cells in later steps. Seed 1.5 × 105 HFK per plate.\nNote: You will need 5 × 105 unmodified cells for each 0.5 cm2 organotypic culture and 1 × 106 for each 1 cm2 organotypic culture.\nTransduce primary HFK cells.",
    "24 h after seeding, aspirate the existing media from wells of 6 well plates.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh monolayer keratinocyte serum free media containing 16 μg/mL polybrene to each well of keratinocytes.\nAdd 750 μL of control or HPV18 E7 retrovirus and 250 μL of GFP lentivirus to appropriate wells.\nNote: When using other retrovirus/lentivirus stocks, volume to add during this step must be determined empirically.\nAdd 1 mL of monolayer keratinocyte serum free media to control wells.\nSwirl gently to mix.\nIncubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 h.\nReplace media with fresh monolayer keratinocyte serum free media.\nIncubate at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nExpand and select HFK cells.\n24 h post-transduction, passage transduced keratinocytes and seed all of the cells from a single transduced well into one 15 cm dish. One well will yield approximately 1.5 × 105 cells.\nCulture the doubly transduced HFK in selection media with puromycin and G418.\nCulture one well of the control HFK in selection media containing puro and one well of the control HFK in G418.\nNote: Typical antibiotic concentrations suitable for selection of primary HFK can be found in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], but the efficiency and timing of cell selection should be confirmed by individual investigators using their cells and antibiotic stocks.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2458_15.csv\nRefeed HFK with 18 mL of selection media every 48 h. Monitor selection progress by tracking the death of cells in the control plates.\n4–5 days post-selection (for G418), there should be no surviving cells in the control (untransduced) populations, indicating complete selection.\nMonitor GFP transduction by fluorescence microscopy. All of the doubly transduced cells should be GFP positive once the selection is complete (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2458-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Assessment of successful transduction and selection",
    "Primary HFK were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding GFP and with a retroviral vector encoding either HPV18 E7 or the empty vector control (EV). GFP expression in engineered cell populations was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar = 100 μm.\nSeeding dermis with fibroblasts\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step describes how to seed devitalized dermis with primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) before initiating organotypic epithelial cultures. To optimize the timing of organotypic culture setup, seed the HFF on the devitalized dermis the day after placing the HFK in selection. HFF in dermis and selected HFK should then be ready at approximately the same time.\nThaw sufficient dermis for experiment by placing frozen aliquot in conical tube in 37°C water bath.\nPour both dermis and buffer into a 15 cm tissue culture plate.\nUse autoclaved forceps to spread the dermis into a flat, even layer on the plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2458-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Labels indicate the epithelium and the surrounding dermis.\n(J) Organotypic culture prior to trimming excess dermis.\n(K) Organotypic culture pre-fixing in formalin following trimming.\nAspirate excess buffer.\nDetermine which side of the dermis is the basement membrane and which is dermal (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "The basement membrane side should look rough and slightly more tan in color.\nThe dermal side should look shiny and more white in color.\nNote: Keep this orientation in mind, as it can be difficult to determine the orientation after media is added or on smaller pieces of dermis.\nCut the dermis to size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nUsing the forceps to guide the scalpel, cut the dermis into appropriately sized pieces. Each dermis piece should be a square, each edge of which is ∼5 mm longer than the edge of the hole in the stand.\nNote: It is helpful to have a sterile raft culture stand on hand to help you judge how big to cut the pieces of dermis.\nNote: Video depictions of these and all subsequent dermis handling steps are viewable in Li et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nPlace the pieces of dermis into individual wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate with the dermal side facing up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Unused pieces of dermis can be refrozen in PBS + penicillin and streptomycin at −80°C.\nAdd 500 μL of HFF medium to each well.\nTrypsinize and seed HFF (recommended passage: 6 or lower).\nTrypsinize primary HFF by adding 2 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution per 10 cm plate of cells.\nInactivate trypsin by adding equal volume of HFF medium. Transfer cells to conical tube.\nCentrifuge cells for 4 min at 290 RCF.\nResuspend cells in 2 mL fibroblast medium.\nSeed 1 × 105 fibroblasts in 500 μL of medium on each piece of dermis. Final volume is 1 mL per well.\nCulture the fibroblasts at 37°C on dermis.\nNote: Fibroblasts and dermis can be co-cultured for 3–4 days, as needed to match HFK selection.\nReplace the media after 48 h.\nCritical: Be careful not to aspirate the dermis.\nCheck HFF density.",
    "Look at the area in the well that is not covered by the dermis. The fibroblasts in these areas will be nearly 100% confluent when the dermis is ready for organotypic culture setup.\nEstablishing and maintaining organotypic epithelial cultures\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis step describes how to set up and maintain organotypic epithelial cultures for the purpose of monitoring cell fate decisions within a labeled subset of cells.\nPrepare for organotypic culture setup (day before culture setup).\nAutoclave a scalpel, at least two pairs of forceps, and the number of raft culture stands required for the experiment.\nThaw 200 μL of Matrigel per organotypic culture (see Note below) in an ice bucket at 4°C overnight.\nNote: Although you will only need ∼100 μL Matrigel per culture, thaw enough for 200 μL per culture.\nPlace dermis on stands.\nFor each raft, place one stand in a 6 cm dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nUsing two pairs of forceps, stretch one fibroblast covered piece of dermis over the hole of each stand (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 2G Side View).\nThe dermis should be basement membrane side up / dermal side down on the stand.\nMake sure that there are no gaps around the edges of the hole.\nAspirate any remaining liquid from the dermis prior to the Matrigel addition.\nPlug the bottom of the stand with Matrigel.\nPlace the lid on all of the 6 cm dishes.\nFlip each covered dish so that the dermal side of the dermis is visible through the hole in the stand (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G Bottom View).\nNote: Dermis will adhere to the stand with no intervention.\nUsing pre-chilled tips, pipette about 100 μL of Matrigel onto the bottom of each raft.\nEnsure that the hole gets completely covered by Matrigel. Try not to produce any bubbles in the Matrigel.",
    "Note: Because the Matrigel solidifies quickly, it can be helpful to pipette enough Matrigel for several rafts at once using a p1000.\nAllow Matrigel to solidify while preparing HFK.\nSeed keratinocytes at the air-liquid interface.\nTrypsinize engineered and parental HFK.\nInactivate trypsin by adding equal volume of E medium. Transfer cells to conical tube.\nCentrifuge cells for 4 min at 290 RCF.\nResuspend cells in 2 mL E medium.\nPrepare one 15 mL tube of cells for each raft culture to be established.\nFor each organotypic culture on an 0.5 cm2 organotypic culture stand, aliquot 5 × 105 parental HFK into a fresh 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: If using 1 cm2 organotypic culture stand, use 1 × 106 parental HFK per culture.\nAdd the appropriate GFP-labeled HFK to each tube at the correct ratio. In this example, control- and HPV18 E7-expressing HFK were used at a ratio of 1:50 (modified to parental), so 1 × 104 modified cells were added to each tube of parental HFK.\nMix cells gently but thoroughly.\nCentrifuge cells for 4 min at 290 RCF.\nAspirate the media from the keratinocyte pellets, removing as much of the media as possible without disturbing the pellets.\nWhen the Matrigel is set, flip the 6 cm dishes containing the organotypic culture stands right side up.\nNote: Tap the lids of the dishes to get the stands to drop if necessary.\nWorking one culture at a time, resuspend the keratinocyte pellets in 40 μL of E media.\nSeed all of the suspension in the center of the basement membrane side of the dermis on the organotypic culture stand.",
    "Note: Be careful not to let the cell suspension spill off of the dermis. Using a lower volume for the resuspension can help to prevent cell loss at the time of culture setup.\nFill the plate surrounding the stand with E media until it just touches the bottom of the stand (around 3 mL) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nReplace the media every 2–3 days.\nMonitor the cultures for growth.\nNote: A tan mass of cells will become visible in the center of the dermis in the first few days of culturing. The cells should expand to nearly fill the section of the dermis that is in contact with the liquid below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nFixation of organotypic epithelial cultures\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes how to fix organotypic epithelial culture tissues using 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nTrim organotypic cultures.\nUsing a clean 15cm plate as a cutting surface, trim off the portions of the dermis that contain no epithelium.\nNote: The epithelium is a thin tan/yellow layer on the basement membrane side of the dermis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nOptional: Pre-fix the organotypic culture.\nAdd a thin layer of neutral buffered formalin (approximately 1 mL) into the bottom of a clean 6 cm dish.\nPlace the trimmed organotypic culture in this dish.\nTilt and submerge the organotypic culture into the formalin with forceps.\nThen ensure the culture is lying flat.\nLeave the dish undisturbed at room temperature for 10 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nThe pre-fixation step ensures that the organotypic culture does not curl during the prolonged fixation overnight.\nFix the organotypic raft cultures.\nPlace the trimmed organotypic culture in excess neutral buffer formalin—one jar per culture.\nIf the optional pre-fixation step was used, transfer the culture to the larger jar now.\nPlace in a dark, room temperature place for 24 h.",
    "Dehydrate tissues in 70% ethanol, embed in paraffin, and cut sections onto slides.\nStaining and imaging\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step describes how to stain sections of the organotypic epithelial cultures by immunofluorescence.\nDeparaffinize tissue sections.\nPlace slides at 55°C until the paraffin wax becomes clear (around 30 min–1 h).\nRemove the paraffin from the slides by incubating the slides in the wash series described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2458_16.csv\nWash slides 5 times with water.\nPause point: The deparaffinized slides can be stored in water at 4°C for several days.\nHeat-induced epitope retrieval.\nFill a polypropylene coplin jar with Sodium Citrate antigen retrieval buffer and place it in the bowl of a pressure cooker.\nAdd 1–2 cm of water to the bowl around the jar.\nPreheat the pressure cooker until the water inside comes to a boil.\nStop the pressure cooker, release the pressure, and place the slides in the coplin jar containing the antigen retrieval buffer.\nRestart the pressure cooker and allow to incubate for 10 min after coming up to pressure.\nRelease the pressure. Remove the jar from the pressure cooker place into a wet ice bath.\nAllow jar and slides to cool for 15 min.\nBlock.\nRemove slides one at a time from the cooled coplin jar.\nTap the side of the slide gently on a paper towel to remove any residual liquid.\nUsing a PAP pen, draw a border around the tissue sections.\nWash the tissues with 100–200 μL of 0.05% TWEEN 20 in PBS.\nAspirate the wash buffer and replace with histology blocking buffer spiked with 10% goat serum.\nIncubate for 30–60 min.\nIncubate in primary antibody.\nAspirate the blocking mixture.",
    "Dilute primary antibodies in blocking buffer spiked with 10% goat serum (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).

Example images of organotypic epithelial cultures imaged for GFP+ cell fate\nOrganotypic epithelial cultures were grown from GFP-labeled cells mixed with unmodified parental HFK at a dilution of 1:50 (GFP-labeled:parental). GFP-expressing cells of one epithelial culture also express HPV18 E7 from a retroviral vector and GFP-expressing cells from the other express the empty control vector (EV). Note that the majority of GFP+ cells in the EV condition are found in the suprabasal layers (IVL+), while most of the GFP+ cells in the HPV18 E7-expressing condition are found in the basal layer (IVL-). Scale bar = 100 μm.",
    "Note: To record enough GFP+ cells for quantification, we recommend taking many images (or one stitched image) that cover the entire length of the organotypic culture section."
