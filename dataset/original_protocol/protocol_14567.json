    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by Thüringer Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz Abteilung Tiergesundheit und Tierschutz, Germany. Because the portal venous system was visualized separately from the hepatic venous system, separate animals were needed for the different vascular trees.\n1. Reagents Preparation\nHeparin-saline solution\n\t\nAdd 0.1 ml heparin into 10 ml saline (5 IU/ml).\nSilicone compound mixture\n\t\nAdd 2 ml MV-120 in one 5 ml tube. Dilute MV-120 by adding 3 ml MV diluent resulting in a 40% solution.\n2. Portal Venous System Silicone Injection\nLaparotomy\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber and anaesthetize it with 2% isoflurane and 0.3 L/min oxygen.\nFix the anaesthetized mouse on the operating table using tape with continuous inhalation of 2% isoflurane and 0.3 L/min oxygen. Check the toe-pinch withdrawal reflex of the mouse and start operation if the reflex is absent.\nMake a transverse incision on the abdomen using scissors for the skin layer and an electric coagulator for the muscle layer. Move out the intestines to the left side using cotton tips and cover the intestines with saline soaked gauze.\nCatheter insertion\n\t\nDissect portal vein under the microscope using micro-forceps. Place one 6-0 silk suture underneath the extrahepatic portal vein, in approximately 1 mm distance to its bifurcation and tie it loosely for later use.\nInject prepared heparin-saline solution via penile vein (male) or inferior vena cava (female) for systemic heparinization for 5 min.\nInsert the 26-gauge (26 G) catheter with needle into portal vein and fix it with a clamp\nHeparin-saline solution and silicone compound perfusion\n\t\nLoad heparin-saline solution in 5 ml syringe and turn on perfusion device. Fill the catheter fully with heparin-saline solution to avoid air bubbles.\nConnect extension tube to the catheter and fix them tightly. Start heparin-saline perfusion with a perfusion rate of 0.4 ml/min.",
    "Ligate pre-placed 6-0 silk suture for double fixing the catheter and blocking blood flow from splenic vein and mesenteric vein. Euthanatize the mouse by exsanguination via perfusion under anesthesia.\nRinse the liver using saline during the whole perfusion procedure in order to keep it moist.\nAdd 0.1 ml curing agent into the MV-120 tube. Change heparin-saline syringe to silicone syringe.\nStart silicone perfusion with a perfusion rate of 0.2 ml/min for approximately 1 min to prefill the catheter system and to fill the portal vein system. Stop silicone perfusion when the vessels on the surface turn blue.\nSampling\n\t\nKeep the liver in-situ until the silicone is fully polymerized after approximately 15 to 30 min. Dissect ligaments connecting liver and adjacent organs with care to keep liver intact. Explant the liver and put it into formalin for fixation.\n3. Hepatic Venous System Silicone Injection\nPerform laparotomy as performed in step 2.1 and expose operative field fully.\nCatheter insertion\n\t\nDissect portal vein under the microscope using micro-forceps. Place one 6-0 silk suture underneath the extrahepatic portal vein, in approximately 1 mm distance to its bifurcation and tie it loosely for later use.\nInject prepared heparin-saline solution via penile vein (male) or inferior vena cava (female) for systemic heparinization for 5 min.\nInsert one 26 G catheter (catheter 1) with needle into portal vein and fix it with a clamp. Insert another 26 G catheter (catheter 2) with needle into inferior vena cava and fix it with a clamp.\nLigate the branches of inferior vena cava (including left and right renal veins) and its distal end using 6-0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture.\nHeparin-saline solution and silicone compound perfusion",
    "Load heparin-saline solution in 5 ml syringe and turn on perfusion device. Fill catheter 1 completely with heparin-saline solution to avoid air bubbles. Connect extension tube to catheter 1 and fix it tightly. Start heparin-saline perfusion at a rate of 0.4 ml/min.\nLigate pre-placed 6-0 silk suture for double fixing the catheter and blocking blood flow from splenic vein and mesenteric vein. Euthanatize the mouse by exsanguination via perfusion under anesthesia.\nRinse the liver using saline during the whole perfusion procedure in order to keep it moist. Add 0.1 ml curing agent into the MV-120 tube. Exchange heparin-saline syringe with silicone syringe.\nPlace a clamp on the suprahepatic inferior vena cava to obstruct the outflow of the liver.\nConnect the extension tube to catheter 2 and start silicone perfusion with a perfusion rate of 0.2 ml/min for approximately 2 min to reach an objective hepatic vascular volume as reported. Stop silicone perfusion when the vessels on the surface turn blue.\nSampling\n\t\nDissect hepatic ligaments avoiding any injury to the liver. Explant the liver and put it into formalin for fixation.\n4. Micro-CT (µCT) Scanning\nTo scan the explanted liver sample using µCT, the following steps are needed.\nTake the liver sample out of the fixation solution. Place the liver onto the µCT bed. Put the µCT bed with the liver sample into the µCT.\nAcquire topogram before starting the scan. Use one subscan for the small liver sample and two subscans for large samples.\nSelect a µCT protocol with a high resolution (e.g., HQD-6565-390-90). This protocol acquires 720 projections with 1,032 x 1,012 pixels during one full rotation with the scanning time of 90 sec per sub-scan. Start the µCT scan.\n5. Histological Serial Sections",
    "Embed the liver specimen in paraffin as a whole after µCT scanning. Cut whole paraffin sample into 4µm sections, resulting in a series of 2,000 to 2,500 sections.\nStain sections with appropriate staining technique to visualize molecular events of interest such as Ki-67 as proliferation marker and HMGB1 as a marker of ischemic damage. Determine sequence of staining in respect to scientific question.\nUse a whole slide scanner to digitalize the stained sections.\nPerform 3D-reconstruction of vascular tree(s) (already feasible) and visualize 3D-distribution of molecular events in respect to vascular tree (research in progress).\nSubscription Required.
