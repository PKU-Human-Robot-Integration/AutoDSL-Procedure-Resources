    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing cells for imaging\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis step outlines the necessary procedures for sample preparation before proceeding for the imaging process.\nRevive FYVE-GFP-expressing C. glabrata strain on a CAA plate 1–2 days, prior to the experiment.\nNote: The revived strain can be stored at 4°C for a maximum of 15 days.\nPrepare cells for imaging.\nInoculate and grow the strain in 10 mL CAA medium for 16 h.\nNote: C. glabrata culturing conditions depend on the type of the experiment being performed, and can be changed accordingly.\nUse these cultures to set up a secondary culture at an initial OD600 of 0.1 in 10 mL CAA medium.\nGrow the culture at 30°C for 4 h to obtain logarithmic-phase cells.\nNext, stain the vacuole with FM 4–64.\nHarvest 4–5 OD600 logarithmic-phase cells at 2000 × g at 25°C.\nCritical: Use cells of same OD600 for all samples.\nSuspend cells in 100 μL CAA medium containing 16 μM FM 4–64 dye.\nAlternatives: For vacuole staining, the CMAC dye, which stains the vacuolar lumen, can also be used.\nIncubate at 30°C with continuous agitation at 10 × g for 2 h.\nWash cells three times with 1 mL CAA medium at 25°C. Collect cells via centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min.\nCritical: Cells need to be washed properly, before proceeding for the FM 4–64 chasing step\nGrow FM 4-64-labeled cells in 10 mL CAA medium for 2 h at 30°C.\nNote: This step of FM 4–64 chasing is to ensure that FM 4–64 reaches and stains the vacuolar membrane.\nNote: For FM 4–64 staining in the YPD medium, labeling time should be reduced to 30 min.\nWash the cells thrice with 1 mL PBS at 2000 × g for 5 min at 25°C.",
    "Stain the plasma membrane with TMA-DPH dye.\nIncubate 4–5 OD600 FM 4-64-labeled cells in 100 μL Tris-HCl buffer [1 M Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 M EDTA] containing 0.5 μM TMA-DPH dye at 25°C for 10 min with continuous agitation at 10 × g.\nCritical: For plasma membrane staining with TMA-DPH dye, always prepare Tris buffer fresh.\nWash cells three times with chilled 1 mL PBS at 4°C and place on ice.\nSuspend cells in 200 μL of chilled PBS and store on ice.\nCritical: Since C. glabrata cells are not fixed in this protocol, images should be acquired on the same day.\nConfocal imaging of FYVE-GFP-expressing C. glabrata cells\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step highlights important parameters for image acquisition, and gives directives for image analysis.\nClean glass slides and coverslips with Kimwipes dipped in 70% ethanol, and air dry, before slide preparation. Protect glass slides and coverslips from dust. The slide preparation steps, mentioned below, are illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Steps for preparation of slides for imaging\n(A) A microcentrifuge tube displaying pelleted-C. glabrata cells.\n(B) A microcentrifuge tube showing PBS-cell suspension.\n(C) A 6 μL sample drop in the middle of the slide.\n(D) The gentle placement of an inclined coverslip over the sample drop.\n(E) A properly-positioned coverslip.\n(F) A tissue paper kept gently on the top of the coverslip (indicated by the red arrow) to remove excess cells, as indicated by the black arrow.\n(G) A coverslip sealed with the nail paint, and the slide is labeled as S1 (Sample 1) on the left-hand side with a marker.\nPlace 6 μL PBS cell suspension in the middle of the slide.",
    "Keep the coverslip gently on the top of the cell suspension, avoiding the entry of air bubbles. Remove any excess cells by placing a tissue paper over the coverslip.\nCritical: The slides and coverslips should be clean, and totally dust- and smudge-free.\nPut the nail paint on two edges of the cover slip to seal the coverslip.\nNote: In case of multiple samples, slides are freshly prepared for each sample.\nWait for 30–60 s to let the cells settle down, before proceeding for image acquisition.\nNote: The slides may get dry while imaging. Thus, to acquire images for more than 30 min, prepare a fresh slide with the same sample.\nAlternatives: Slides can be coated with poly-L-lysine or concanavalin A to immobilize cells.\nImage cells using the confocal microscope. One representative acquired image is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

It ensures that the hardware necessary for image acquisition is ready.\nSwitch on the Zen Black software.\nNote: We have used the Zeiss confocal microscope. Its inbuilt software, Zen Black and Zen Blue, were used for image acquisition and analysis, respectively.\nAlternatives: Any other confocal microscope such as Leica, Nikon etc. can be used.\nSelect the objective lens, laser lines, detectors and scanning parameters (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image acquisition parameter settings in the Zen Black software",
    "(A) The ‘Locate’ option is used to select the objective lens, and is marked by the yellow circle. Adjacent to it, is the ‘Acquisition’ option, which is used to open the settings for image acquisition parameters.\n(B) The ‘Channels’ option allows laser selection, and the laser power and gain can be adjusted using further settings, under this option.\n(C) The ‘Imaging Setup’ is used to adjust detector settings.\n(D) The ‘Acquisition mode’ is used to set-up scanning parameters, and to select the region of interest to acquire image from the whole field, using the ‘Crop Area’ option.\nSelect the objective lens in the Zen Black software under the ‘Locate Menu’ command, which is encircled in yellow in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nNote: We have used the Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil objective lens. This lens magnifies the image 63 times of the actual size, and has 1.4 Numerical aperture (NA). NA determines the lateral and axial resolution in the sample. The higher the NA of the objective lens, the better will be the resolution. The Plan-Apochromat lens aids in accurate color reproduction and yields better quality images. The immersion oil increases the resolution and improves the image quality. Overall, based on the magnification and the resolution requirement of the experimental set-up, the appropriate lens can be chosen.\nAdjust the laser line and its settings, as shown under the ‘Channels’ option in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nNote: We have used three different laser lines, 405, 488 and 561, for FM4-64, GFP and TMA-DPH, respectively. The laser line choice depends on the excitation wavelength of the fluorophores and dyes being used in the experiment.\nSelect the detector settings, as shown under the ‘Imaging setup’ option in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nNote: The detector is selected based on the emission spectrum of the fluorophores and dyes being used in the experiment.",
    "Critical: The accurate selection of laser line and detector minimizes the issues of photobleaching, autofluorescence and bleed-through in the samples.\nSet the laser power and detector gain. These settings can be adjusted, as shown under the ‘Channels’ option in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nNote: The laser power should be selected to excite fluorophores and dyes optimally. While the higher laser power can cause photobleaching, phototoxicity or oversaturated signal, the low laser power may yield weak or no fluorescence signal.\nNote: The optimal detector gain is important to minimize the signal to noise ratio.\nConfirm the accuracy of adjusted settings.\nNote: Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A shows both the impact on signal saturation, when samples are illuminated with laser power higher than required, and on image quality when using higher than required gain.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Image acquisition parameter comparison to improve the image quality\nScale bar = 2 μm.\n(A) Images illustrating signal saturation and signal haziness under settings of increased laser power (percentage) and laser gain (Voltage; V), respectively.\n(B) Images displaying resolution variations in images acquired using different pixel sizes.\nSet up the scanning parameters including scanning mode, scan speed and pixel size (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: These features help in balancing the time required for image capturing and acquiring best image resolution. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B shows the images captured at four different pixel sizes, 1204∗1204, 512∗512, 256∗256 and 128∗128.\nNote: The Pixel size correlates with image resolution, the fewer the pixels are, the less-resolved the image will be.\nDefine the region of interest (ROI). It can be selected from the ‘Acquisition mode’ option (Crop Area), as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D.\nAcquire images. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] marks the cells that can impact image acquisition and quality. These issues should be resolved prior to image capturing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Four cells were used to quantify signal, and sample mean intensity values are plotted arbitrary units as. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 4). p ≤ 0.001; Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was applied. (Signal should ideally be quantified in 100‒150 cells).\nFrom the ‘Graphics’ menu, select the ‘spline contour’ option, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B.\nDraw one spline contour close to the cell boundary and another one enclosing the vacuole for measuring FYVE-GFP signal intensity at the plasma membrane and in the vacuole, respectively.\nCopy the same spline contour to the blank space where cells are not present.\nThe intensity values obtained from the blank space are considered as background signal.\nTo access information on the area and mean intensity values for the selected GFP channel under the spline contour, tick off the ‘M' option within the ‘Graphics’ menu (indicated by the yellow box in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nNote: This step will create a 'table containing desired information' on the right-hand side of the image (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nSelect the ‘Measurement’ option (marked by the orange box in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C), and then select the ‘Create document’ (marked by the blue box in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) to export the table as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.\nSubtract the background intensity values from sample mean intensity values, and plot data as arbitrary units in the GraphPad prism (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nNote: Statistical significance of fluorescence intensity differences between two organelles (plasma membrane and vacuole; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) can be determined by employing an appropriate statistical test, such as Student’s t-test.\nNext, choose the image that accurately reflects the findings of all acquired images.",
    "Select the ‘Profile plot’ option from the left side, as marked by the white box (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) or from the ‘Graphics’ menu, as shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3193-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Depending on the experimental requirement, fluorophore intensity plot combinations can be selected. We observed FYYE-GFP distribution on the plasma membrane as well as in the vacuole with varying degrees of intensity (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: By choosing the ‘Channels’ option, marked by the orange box in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, fluorophore localization either solely at the plasma membrane or in the vacuole, or at both cellular organelles can be illustrated.\nModify the intensity plot data against the distance generated for the fluorophore by selecting and changing, respectively, the ‘Profile view’ and ‘X and Y-axis settings’ options, marked by the yellow box and the orange box in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C.",
