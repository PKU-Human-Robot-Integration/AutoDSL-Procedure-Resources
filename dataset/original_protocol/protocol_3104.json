    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of pre-implantation embryo\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe exact time to perform the experiment will depend on which pre-implantation embryo stage you are interested to analyze. A time frame for the isolation of embryos at different stages has been mentioned in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] In addition, the female mice can be superovulated before keeping it for mating.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] This will help to synchronize the developmental stages and increase the yield of embryos at a particular stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2878-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Timeline of murine embryonic development and their isolation\nUsing the below mentioned protocol you will be able to isolate pre-implantation embryos. A schematic representation for the isolation of embryos and usage of mouth pipette has been demonstrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2878-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Procedure for the isolation of embryo and usage of mouth pipette\n(A) Schematic representation for the isolation of mouse embryo at different stages of development.\n(B) Model of mouth pipette used to transfer embryos.\n(C) Cartoon representation of holding the mouth pipette while embryo transfer under the microscope.\n(D) Closer look into the position of hands while using the mouth pipette.\nEuthanizing the female mice.\nBring the mice to the euthanasia room and perform cervical dislocation to sacrifice the mice.\nDissecting the uterine horn-\nSpray alcohol on the belly of the mouse and wipe with tissue paper. Using a tweezer lift up the skin fold and cut open the skin and abdominal lining to expose the uterine horns.\nUsing fine forceps and scissors cut the uterine horn and place it in a dish containing 1× PBS at 25°C–28°C.\nIsolation of embryos from the uterine horn.\nCut out the ovaries and also the area adjacent to the joining of the uterine horns.",
    "Take media in 1 mL syringe and plunge it into the horns while holding the horns properly with a tweezer such that the media washes out the contents within the fallopian tube into the wells of a 4-well dish.\nRepeat the process twice for both uterine horns.\nAllow the embryo to settle down for 10–15 min.\nObserve the embryos under the phase contrast microscope.\nWash the embryos twice or thrice with 1× PBS to remove the debris.\nTransfer the embryos to the wells of the 4-well plate by mouth pipetting.\nTake a micrograph with a phase contrast microscope for further reference.\nPool the embryos if you are isolating them from multiple female mice and sort the embryos for various procedures.\nProceed to fixation step if the embryo is to be used for immunofluorescence and perform until the blocking stage.\nThe embryos can be stored at 4°C after blocking, to be analyzed later or can be immediately proceeded for staining.\nFor RNA isolation, transfer the embryos to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nSnap freeze the embryos by immersing the microfuge containing embryos in liquid nitrogen for 2–3 min.\nStore at −80°C.",
    "Critical: For beginners, sometimes there is confusion in visualizing the embryos. The fat droplets look similar to size of embryos, and the embryos appear to float in different focal planes under the microscope. Hence, it is important to let the embryos settle for 10–15 min before you start looking for them under the microscope. Our experience indicates it is better to start with a phase contrast microscope. When your eyes are set to detect embryos, a stereoscope should be good enough. For your own reference, micrographs should be recorded for each stage of embryonic development. However, if the downstream processing of the embryo involves other studies like the derivation of embryonic or trophoblast stem cells, the transfer of embryos into pseudo-pregnant females, or to study any in vitro development of the embryos, a wait time for settling the embryos is not suggested. The embryos in that case should be processed at the earliest.\nImmunostaining of mouse pre-implantation embryos\nTiming: 2–3 days\nAll the steps are conducted in shaking condition. The volume of buffers mentioned here is for a batch of embryos.\nFix the embryos with 300 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde kept in a single well of a 4-well plate.\nIncubate at 25°C–28°C for 10 min.",
    "Note: For morula to blastocyst stage embryos, a fixation for 30 min is preferred while 10 min is sufficient for embryos at earlier stages. Depending upon the type of protein to be detected the fixation solution would vary. A freshly prepared fixative should be used. Antibodies that will be used should be checked with proper positive and negative controls. Some antibodies might need more time for fixation. Here, the protein of our interest is E-cadherin and the antibody specific for the protein has been standardized.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Also, we have looked into only pre-implantation embryos, hence 4% paraformaldehyde with the mentioned time of incubation is sufficient to fix the embryos.\nCritical: Depending on the quality of the fixation, immunofluorescence analysis for the detection of the protein of interest would differ. Hence, standardization of the fixation protocol with the antibody of your interest is an absolute necessity.\nWash the embryos thrice with 300 μL of 1× PBS using mouth pipette and in 4-well plate.\nPermeabilize the embryo with 300 μL 0.25% TritonX-100, incubate at 25°C–28°C for 1 h.\nWash the embryos twice with 300 μL 1× PBS.\nIncubate the embryos in 300 μL of blocking solution at 25°C–28°C for 2 h or at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nNote: The embryos can be stored after blocking at 4°C for several weeks, if you wish to perform the immunostaining later. In fact, we have used embryos almost one year after blocking. In case of prolonged storage, it is better to transfer the embryos into a microfuge with sufficient volume of blocking solution.\nPause point: The embryos processed till now can be stored at 4°C.\nDilute primary antibody E-cadherin/CDH1 (1:100) in blocking solution.\nTransfer embryos to the diluted antibody solution by mouth pipetting.\nIncubate for 12–16 h at 4°C.",
    "Note: The dilution of the primary antibody will change depending on the isotype, clonality and concentration of the supplied antibody from a company. Hence, the dilution of the primary antibody would vary.\nThe next day, keep the plate at 25°C–28°C for 10 min.\nWash the embryos thrice with 300 μL of 1× PBS.\nNote: The following steps are light sensitive; hence they should be performed in the dark\nAdd 200 μL of secondary antibody (1:200, diluted with 1× PBS) and keep for 1 h at 25°C–28°C.\nNote: After the addition of secondary antibody the embryos may get sticky, so handle them carefully.\nWash the embryos thrice with 300 μL of 1× PBS, 10 min each.\nAdd 300 μL of nuclear stain HOECHST (1 mg/mL) diluted in 1× PBS (1:1000), and keep for 10 min at 25°C–28°C.\nWash the embryos once with 300 μL of 1× PBS for 5 min at 25°C–28°C.\nCheck the embryos under a fluorescent microscope and carefully transfer them to a slide with a cavity.\nNote: A cavity can be made on a normal microscopic slide, as used in this study. Mark a small circle multiple times with a transparent nail polish. The diameter of the circle should be less than the coverslip to be used. However, concave glass slides commercially available (with a shallow depression) can be used to prevent smashing of the embryo by the coverslip.\nAdd a drop of antifade reagent and place the coverslip gently.\nNote: Be careful to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nFix the coverslip by gently adding transparent nail-polish around the circumference of the coverslip.\nKeep the slide at 25°C–28°C for 15–30 min.\nUse confocal microscopy to detect the presence and localization of E-cadherin/CDH1.\nNote: You can preserve the slide at 4°C until imaging.",
    "Alternatives: The washing or incubation of the embryos during staining could be done in drops placed in a 60 cm dish, but that might hinder the proper washing of the embryos, for negating any non-specific interaction.\nRNA isolation from pre-implantation mouse embryos using Pico-pure kit\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step helps in the isolation of RNA from snap frozen pre-implantation mouse embryos to be used for cDNA preparation and quantitative RT-PCR. We have used Arcturus Pico Pure RNA isolation Kit and have followed the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher, KIT0204, =%%%https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F1268200.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?urlhttps://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets2FLSG2Fmanuals2F1268200.pdf]).\nNote: The working area should be properly cleaned. You can turn on the heating block for step 2 before you start. The steps mentioned below are in continuation from the step 4c-II of the section: Isolation of pre-implantation embryo. You can proceed for either immunostaining or RNA extraction after the isolation of the embryos.\nAdd 100 μL of Extraction buffer and resuspend the cell pellet gently by pipetting.\nIncubate the samples at 42°C for 30 min in a heating block.\nNote: You can start conditioning the column by the end of this incubation.\nCentrifuge the samples at 3000 × g for 2 min.\nPipette the supernatant containing the extracted RNA into a new microfuge tube.\nCondition the RNA purification column:\nPipette 250 μL conditioning buffer onto the purification column filter membrane.\nIncubate the column with conditioning buffer for 5 min at 25°C–28°C.\nCentrifuge the purification column in the provided collection tube at 16000 × g for 1 min.\nPipette 100 μL of 70% ethanol to the cell extract. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The combined volume must be approximately 200 μL.\nPipette the contents into the pre-conditioned purification column.\nTo bind RNA:\nCentrifuge the samples for 2 min at 100 g.",
    "Centrifuge once more at 16000 g for 30 s to remove the flow through.\nPipette 100 μL wash buffer 1 into purification column and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 × g.\nPipette 100 μL wash buffer2 to the purification column and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 × g.\nPipette 100 μL wash buffer 2 into the purification column and centrifuge for 2 min at 16000 × g.\nIf the wash buffer remains, centrifuge at 16000 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer the purification column to a new 0.5 mL tube supplied with the kit.\nPipette the elution buffer directly onto the membrane of the purification column (gently touch the tip of the pipette to the surface of the membrane while dispensing the elution buffer).\nNote: The minimum elution volume to be used is 11 μL, for 6 blastocysts we have used approximately-15 μL, decide accordingly.\nWait for 3 min, then spin at 8000 × g for 30 s.\nDiscard the column and store the RNA at −80°C.\nCritical: While conducting the entire procedure, you should wear gloves. The amount of RNA isolated from the embryos sometimes might be very little, so we have standardized for how many minimum embryos could be good enough to isolate RNA of good quality that can be used to synthesize cDNA and eventually analyzed for the expression of genes of interest by Sybr Green reporter based quantitative RT-PCR assay. On average 20 embryos per stage (4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst) are good enough to isolate RNA for cDNA synthesis using the Pico-pure kit.\nPause point: You can store the isolated RNA at −80°C until you are ready to use it.\ncDNA synthesis from RNA isolated by Pico-pure kit\nTiming: 2 h\nMeasure the RNA concentration by Nanodrop.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2878_2.csv",
    "Prepare the master mix with the cDNA high capacity reverse transcriptase kit as- 10× RT Buffer-2.0 μL, 25× dNTP Mix (100 mM) 0.8 μL, 10× RT Random Primers 2.0 μL, MultiScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase 1.0 μL, RNase Inhibitor 1.0 μL, Nuclease-free water 3.2 μL with total volume per reaction 10.0 μL (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fcms_042557.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fcms_042557.pdf]).\nTake at least 50 ng of RNA in a 0.2 mL PCR tube and make up the volume to 10 μL with nuclease free water.\nAdd 10 μL of master mix to the RNA in the PCR tube.\nMix by pipetting once or twice, spin for a pulse of 10 s at 800 × g.\nKeep the tube on ice until you start the Thermal Cycler to carry out the PCR.\nPCR cycling conditions are- 25°C for 10 min, 37°C for 120 min, 85°C for 5 min, and 4°C hold.\nOnce the reaction is over, store the sample at −20°C."
