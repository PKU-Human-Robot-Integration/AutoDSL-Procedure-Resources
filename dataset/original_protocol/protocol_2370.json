    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicrofluidic system preparation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nOnce micro-channels are milled in the polycarbonate sheets (as described in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] SECTION), the system is bonded with the elastic PDMS membrane, and subsequently the pressure tubing connector is installed.\nActivation of the Polycarbonate disk with the engraved microchannel and inlet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPut the polycarbonate disk in the plasma chamber, the crafted side facing up. Close the chamber and turn on the vacuum pump to decrease the pressure inside the chamber to 0.1 mbar.\nNote: Depending on the plasma system and the vacuum pump, it can take up to several minutes to stabilize the pressure inside the chamber.\nMeanwhile, prepare the station for polycarbonate APTES functionalization.\nOn a bench fix a parafilm that is slightly bigger than the polycarbonate disk.\nPlace a drop of 400 μL of freshly prepared APTES 1% v/v solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) onto the parafilm.\nWhen the pressure is 0.1 mbar in the chamber, purge the chamber with pure O2:\nOpen the O2 bottle and the valves connected to the chamber.\nTurn on the O2 flow-meter to 2.0 nL/h and wait for the pressure to increase to ∼1 mbar.\nDecrease the O2 flow-meter to 0.2–0.3 nL/h in order to reach a pressure of 0.3–0.4 mbar in the chamber and subsequently activate the plasma for a total of 60 s at the power of 10%. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Depending on the plasma cleaner system the parameters might vary, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nTerminate the plasma cleaner cycle by turning off the pump and filling the chamber with the air.",
    "Using forceps, take the polycarbonate disk and put it on the 400 μL APTES drop with activated side (side with engraved channel) facing down. Incubate the polycarbonate for 20 min at 20°C–30°C.\nCritical: You must proceed fast and put in contact the activated polycarbonate with APTES solution rapidly, since the plasma treatment is reversible. Usually it takes around 1 min to finalize this step.\nCritical: Very often at first attempt of putting the system in contact with APTES an air bubble is entrapped at the channel void. Reposition the system several times to remove the air and secure complete contact between the system and the APTES solution.\nMeanwhile prepare a container with 50–100 mL of ddH2O, and a laboratory wash bottle with the pure isopropanol; both solution will be used for washing the polycarbonate after the APTES treatment.\n5 min before the end of system incubation with the APTES proceed to the activation of the PDMS membrane; step 3.\nActivation of the PDMS membrane and bonding with the polycarbonate disk.\nCut a piece of 20 μm-thick PDMS membrane (available commercially) slightly bigger than the polycarbonate disk.\nPut the PDMS film into the plasma chamber, with the PDMS layer facing up.\nNote: PDMS membrane is supplied on a removable plastic (thin-film) support on one side and protected by the non-sticking paper on the other side. During manipulation, it is important to keep the protective film as long as possible to limit the deposition of dust and debris on the PDMS membrane. We suggest removing the protection paper once the plastic film with the PDMS is already positioned inside the chamber.\nActivate the PDMS film with the plasma cleaner following the steps 1 c–e.",
    "Critical: If ventilation of the plasma chamber is too rapid the PDMS membrane on the plastic film can be displaced or even turned upside-down. To avoid it, secure the PDMS membrane at the corners with the Magic scotch TAPE.\nMeanwhile, when plasma chamber equilibrates to atmospheric pressure, using forceps, place the polycarbonate disk into a ddH2O water container and gently rinse the system with water. Subsequently, while still holding the polycarbonate disk with the forceps, wash the APTES treated side thoroughly (30 s continuous flow) with the isopropanol from a manual dispenser (wash bottle).\nDry the polycarbonate disk with the compressed air.\nPlace the polycarbonate disk with the channel facing down on the activated PDMS membrane (obtained from step 3c) and press firmly.\nCritical: Start the bond from the one side of the polycarbonate disk in order to avoid entrapment of air bubbles. Some bubbles can be removed by pressing them away locally with the fingers.\nLet it react for 30 min at 20°C–30°C.\nInspect the fabricated system under the microscope to identify potential problems such as entrapped dust or not perfectly bound membrane. Discard any system that presents such problems. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nInstallation of the pressure tubing connector (PDMS cube) to the system.\nRemove the protection film from the PDMS by peeling it off gently from the edge of the system. At this stage the channel and the inlet are closed by the membrane.\nUsing forceps and scalpel remove the PDMS membrane from above the inlet area to enable control over pressure in the channel.",
    "Critical: If you are not working in the clean-room environment, keep fabricated systems in a closed Petri-dish or multi well plates to avoid any dust deposition. Wear laboratory gloves. To ensure successful bonding with the connector, avoid touching any PDMS surface to be bound and activated.\nPlace the tubing connector and the polycarbonate system with the PDMS membrane already bonded (result of steps 2 and 3) facing up in the plasma chamber.\nActivate both PDMS surfaces (connector and system) by following the steps 1c–e.\nAlign the connector and the inlet from the polycarbonate/PDMS system and put the two activated surfaces in contact for bonding. Subsequently, press gently to ensure full contact. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: After step 3d, the surface of the PDMS membrane is activated with the plasma cleaner and therefore remains highly hydrophilic up to 3 h. Before proceeding to cell culture, it is necessary to wait at least 3 h for the PDMS membrane to become hydrophobic again.\nQuality verification of the system fabrication.\nInsert the tubing into the fabricated connector on the system and further connect the system with the pressure controller (pressure pump). Subsequently insert the system to the Petri dish (diameter 10 cm) with water so that the connector can be fully submerged.\nPlace the system submerged in the water-bath in the Petri dish under the inverted microscope and observe visually if the PDMS membrane detaches from the polycarbonate upon increased pressure (we usually use +100 mbar for the testing). Subsequently, verify by eye if no air bubbles are produced in the water-bath at the level of tubing connector or channel. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nQuantification of the membrane deformation.\nSonicate the beads in the sonicator on the high power to destroy clusters of beads formed in the tube.",
    "Dilute the nano-beads 1/200 in pure isopropanol and deposit a 20 μL drop on a microscope slide. Using a pipette tip, spread the solution to create a larger area over which the beads will be deposited. Let it dry at RT (or to accelerate in the oven at 40°C).\nOnce dry, put in direct contact the microscope slide with the deposited beads and the microsystem. Ensure that the region containing the channel is in contact with the beads. Repeat this step several times to deposit maximum number of beads on the PDMS membrane.\nTo observe the membrane deformation with the standard inverted confocal microscope, install the system upside down – channel facing the objective - in the coverslip holder (i.e., Ske company or Pecon Cultivation System). Connect the tubing and the pressure controller.\nUse a confocal microscope with tile or multi-position option to create Z-stacks of the deformed membrane over the channel. Typically, we used a 20× objective (air, N.A 0.5) on a Spinning Disk Andromeda RILL-FEI (EMCCD iXon 897 Camera). Standard Z-range limits of the confocal microscope are sufficient for the imaging.\nTake a Z-stack over the non-deformed system, and scan with different pressures the deformation of the membrane. From the obtained Z-stack it is possible to calculate the curvature at the channel border, and from the relative position of the nanobeads it is possible to calculate the in-plane strain of the membrane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2004-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Observation of the membrane deformation",
    "On the left, confocal orthogonal (XZ) images of nano beads deposited on the membrane for control (0 mbar) and under pressure (ΔP = -450 mbar). Scale bar 100 μm. On the right, superposition of fluorescent images of nano beads before (cyan) and after (magenta) the application of the pressure. Scale bar 10 μm. The relative displacement in respect to image border or between the beads can be used to calculate the strain.\nNote: Similarly, the in-plane strain can be calculated by directly observing the changes in the area of the fluorescently stained cells.\nWash-out the nanobeads from the PDMS system by using soap and scrubbing the surface with hands covered with laboratory gloves (i.e., nitrile or latex). Subsequently, rinse thoroughly with water.\nSeeding cells to form a monolayer on the system\nTiming: 3 h preparation and 24 h incubation of cell culture\nOnce the system is fabricated and functional, the next step accomplishes formation of the epithelial monolayer on the system.\nCritical: Once the system is prepared, before proceeding to coating it is necessary to wait at least 3 h for the PDMS membrane to recover from the plasma membrane treatment.\nUnder the laminar hood, place the system in a sterile container, such as a Petri-dish or a 6-well plate. Wash the system three times by fully submerging the system in the ethanol 70%. Once sterile, using forceps, transfer the system into a new sterile container and wash the system three times with the sterile PBS.",
    "Coat the system with a sufficient amount of 40 μg/mL Fibronectin solution in PBS to cover the surface of the PDMS but not the connector. Typically for a single well of a 6-well plate we used 1.5 mL of fibronectin solution. Leave the system one hour at 37°C then rinse it carefully with PBS without introducing PBS inside the PDMS cube. Remove the PBS.\nNote: Systems will have tendency to float on top of the fibronectin solution. Use sterile forceps or pipette tip to push the system toward the well bottom to cover the system with the coating solution.\nAlternatives: Other than fibronectin coating (i.e., collagen, matrigel, laminin etc.) can be performed on the microfluidic system during step 8 to provide cell-specific adhesion to the system.\nPrepare MDCK cells to be seeded on the system:\nRemove the medium of your 80% confluent T75 flask MDCK culture and rinse twice the cells with 5 mL of PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin on the cells and wait at 37°C until the cells are no longer attached to the surface (this step can take up to 20 min).\nCentrifuge cells (260 × g for 4 min) and re-suspend the pellet in 2–3 mL of the fresh culture medium.\nCount MDCK cells and adjust the concentration to deposit 3 × 105 cells per 1 cm2 on the fibronectin-coated system in S-MEM completed with 5% FBS, 1% antibiotic and 5 μM CaCl2. Low calcium helps to form an instant monolayer as described in literature (Benham-Pyle et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). After two hours, gently wash the system once with the normal MEM complete medium to remove non-adhered cells and let the monolayer to be formed in the MEM complete medium. Typically, we used 2–3 mL of the media per well of a 6-well plate. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Incubate the system in the cell incubator (5% CO2; at 37°C) for 24 h. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Longer incubations will lead to higher cell density and can affect the formation of calcium waves. In that case it might be necessary to optimize the in-channel pressure change and therefore the resulting membrane deformation to trigger calcium waves in denser monolayers.\nOptional: Other type of cells can be used to form a monolayer on the system.\nTriggering calcium waves in the epithelial monolayer\nTiming: 3 h\nWhen the monolayer is successfully formed, cells are incubated with a calcium fluorescent probe (Fluo-4 Direct Calcium) which allows following changes in calcium concentration upon triggered epithelial deformation.\nNote: Before you begin, turn on the CO2 and temperature control on the microscope that will be used for the observation of calcium waves. This will help stabilize the focus during the experiment.\nIncubate cells with the calcium fluorescent probe:\nFilter dead or non-attached cells from the culture medium in which cells on the system were maintained during the last 24 h. Aspirate the medium into a syringe, fix the 0.20 μm filter and gently put 500 μL of the medium back to the well with the system.\nNote: Use of conditioned medium and not fresh at this stage improves the reproducibility in calcium wave generation between the experiments.\nUsing forceps install the system in the microscopy holder (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] and materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] SECTION, and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Make sure that the system is correctly installed and no medium leakage occurs from the bottom.\nFollowing the supplier protocol.",
    "(https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F10471[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F10471]) double concentrated Fluo-4 Direct Calcium probe solution is added to an equal volume of medium (i.e., total volume of 1 mL composed of 500 μL Fluo-4 Direct Calcium probe for 500 μL of the conditioned medium as described in the step 10a), mixed gently, and the system is incubated for 1 h (or as stated by the supplier) in the cell incubator.\nNote: The Fluo-4 Direct reference that we used does not need to be washed away before imaging, however, some other references can require this step.\nInstall the system on the inverted microscope stage and connect the system via tubing (as on Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) to the pressure controller. As showed in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], when installed in the holder, the setup resembles a normal Petri dish chamber in which cells grow on the top of the chamber covered with the culture medium.\nUse 20× objective for visualization (observation setup as in step 6e). Adjust the focus and use minimal excitation source power that ensures the good quality of the fluorescence signal. Longer excitation times are less phototoxic when used with a lower power excitation source. Low heterogeneity of fluorescence between cells is typically observed with this probe (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPosition the field of view so that the border of the channel is visible on the image. The calcium wave spreads away from the channel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2004-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Calcium waves spreading upon induced epithelial folding\n(A) Schematic representation of the observation setup and positioning of the field of view.\n(B) Calcium waves are initiated above and by the border of the channel and spread laterally. Scale bar 50 μm.",
    "(C) With the imposed negative pressure, the membrane deflates and stretches (quantification of the strain in C; described in step 6) causing the activation of calcium signals. Changes in calcium level were quantified by following the fluorescence of Fluo-4 Direct Calcium in the function of distance from the channel border. The graph presents the mean value +/-SEM.\nAdjust time-lapse observation settings. We typically captured an image every two seconds for one minute.\nCritical: Verify if observation settings are not phototoxic by taking a control time-lapse observation very far from the channel. If excitation power is too strong, it alone can cause an increase in calcium signal.\nStart a time-lapse and acquire the first 5 frames before you turn on the pressure (ΔP = -450 mbar). This serves to quantify the starting level of calcium signal. Additionally, acquiring these initial frames helps to observe if no fluorescence fluctuations occur before any stretching is triggered.\nNote: Once the pressure is on, you should be able to see a cellular deformation followed by local increase in the calcium signal fluorescence. The wave spreads during ∼30 s and in our system reaches ∼150 μm distance.\nTurn off the pressure controller to bring the pressure in the channel to the atmospheric level, and subsequently detach the tubing.\nNote: At this stage you can fix cells on the system with the standard procedures and proceed to immunofluorescence. At the end of the staining protocol, mount with the mounting medium and a coverslip. Using a scalpel cut off the connector. For the observation you can use the same system holder as for the live experiments.\nWash the system to reuse it for another experiment.",
    "Scrub the system gently with gloves under water and with soap. This will remove the majority of the cell layer and cell culture reagents.\nCritical: Do not wash the system with alcohol as it can fix the proteins on the surface of the system.\nSecure the inlet with a tubing closed up at the other end with a needle and a luer lock.\nInsert the system in a small plastic bag with a zip and fill with the RIPA buffer.\nPlace the bag in a sonicator bath and make sure that the system is fully submerged in the lysis buffer. Subsequently run two cycles of 4 min at the highest power.\nNote: Systems can be reused up to 6–8 times.\nTo reuse the system for a new experiment, proceed directly starting from step 6. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAnalysis of calcium waves\nOnce movies are acquired it is possible to analyze the spatial and temporal properties of calcium waves. Using the steps described below you will be able to obtain the graph as presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nInstall and Open ImageJ.\nUpload the acquired video into the ImageJ.\nNote: ImageJ supports majority of file formats from the image acquisition software. If it is not a TIFF format transform it by saving your movie as a 16-bit TIFF file.\nAdjust the scale and time resolution of your experiment.\nGo to Image>Image Properties.\nSet the scale of the image by filling pixel width and pixel height (set units to μm).\nSet the frame interval (in this protocol we recommended acquiring a time-point every 2 s).\nSelect “global” if you will analyze more images of the same properties from the experiments. This way the scale and time-point information will be conserved.",
    "Rotate the image so that the channel is positioned parallel to the left border of the image.\nGo to Image>Transform>Rotate…\nSet the angle of rotation and check with Preview if the transformation was correct. Then validate with OK.\nSubtract the Fluo-4 Direct base signal to analyze only changes in fluorescence triggered by epithelial deformation.\nDuplicate last image in sequence before pressure was turned on. To do so, go to Image>Duplicate. Choose to not duplicate the whole stack by unclicking stack.\nGo to Process>Image calculator and choose your time-lapse image as Image 1 and Duplicated image as Image 2. Choose Subtract in the Operation panel. Validate with OK (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2004-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Analysis of calcium waves in ImageJ software\nTop images show the operation to remove the basal level of the fluorescence (step 17). From the image at the maximal wave distance (in here at 14 s) subtract the image at 2 s before the cell deformation is triggered (in here 2 s) to obtain an image with the corrected fluorescence level being the signal related only to calcium wave. The image at the bottom shows how the image should be transformed by rotation to obtain calcium wave spreading in horizontal direction (from left to right) in order to obtain the mean gray value profile over the distance (step 18). Scale bar 50 μm.\nAnalyze distance calcium wave have spread.\nSelect the time-point of interest.\nUsing Rectangle tool from the main menu, draw a rectangle that starts at the channel border and covers the whole area of the system except the channel.\nUse Ctrl+K to plot a profile of Intensity over the distance. A new window with a graph will open. To obtain raw data click on Data>Save Data (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: The average gray value (as showed in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) is calculated automatically by the software. The error bar is a result of the analysis of experimental replicates."
