    "The protocol for human blood collection and handling was reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee (CPP Est II), and the protocol number is 2011-A00594-37.\nNOTE: The following protocol describes the handling of human blood. Please follow institutional guidelines while disposing of biohazardous material. Laboratory safety equipment, such as lab coats and gloves, should be worn. A flow chart describing the protocol is displayed in Figure 3.\n1. Blood and Body Fluid DNA Extraction\nPipet 20 µL of proteinase K (15 µg/µL) into the bottom of a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 200 µL of sample to the 1.5-mL tube. Use up to 200 µL of whole blood, plasma, serum, buffy coat, or body fluids, or up to 5 x 106 lymphocytes in 200 µL of PBS.\nAdd 200 µL of lysis buffer to the sample. Mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s.\nIncubate at 56 °C for 10 min in a water bath.\nBriefly centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube to remove the drops from the inside of the lid.\nAdd 200 µL of ethanol (96-100%) to the sample and mix again by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. After mixing, briefly centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube to remove the drops from the inside of the lid.\nCarefully apply the mixture from step 1.6 to the membrane column (in a 2 mL collection tube). Without wetting the rim, close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Place the membrane column in a clean 2-mL collection tube and discard the tube containing the filtrate.",
    "Carefully open the membrane column and add 500 µL of wash buffer 1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Place the membrane column in a clean 2 mL collection tube and discard the tube containing the filtrate.\nCarefully open the membrane column and add 500 µL of wash buffer 2 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.\nPlace the membrane column in a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the collection tube with the filtrate. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the membrane column in a clean 1.5 mL tube and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate.\nCarefully open the membrane column and add 200 µL of distilled water. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nProceed to the determination of DNA concentration step or freeze the DNA samples at -20 °C\n2. Determination of DNA Concentration\nNOTE: See Figure 4.\nPress 1 to select DNA mode on a spectrophotometer. Select a 5 mm path length using the left and right arrows. Select a dilution factor of 1 using the left and right arrows.\nSelect the unit (µg/mL) using the left and right arrows. Select a factor of 50 using the left and right arrows. Press OK.\nPipet 10 µL of distilled water into the cuvette. Put the cuvette in the spectrophotometer. Press the OA/100%T button.\nPipette 10 µL of the DNA sample (1/4 dilution in distilled water) into the cuvette. Put the cuvette in the spectrophotometer. Press the green button (read/start). Note the concentration.\nFreeze the DNA sample at -20 °C.\n3. HRM-PCR Protocol",
    "Thaw the DNA samples. Dilute the DNA samples in 1.5 mL tubes with water to adjust them to a concentration of 10 ng/µL\n\tNOTE: The total volume of diluted DNA should be between 2 µL and 10 µL.\nThaw the primer solutions. Dilute the primer solutions in 1.5-mL tubes with water to adjust them to the same concentration of 6 µM.\n\tNOTE: The primer sequences and reaction conditions are provided in Table 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56012/56012table1.jpg\nTable 1: Primers and parameters used in the high-resolution melting analysis.\nThaw the HRM-PCR kit solutions and mix carefully by vortexing to ensure the recovery of all contents. Briefly spin the three vials containing the enzymatic mixture with DNA binding dye, MgCl2, and water in a microcentrifuge before opening them. Store them at room temperature.\nIn a 1.5 mL tube at room temperature, prepare the PCR mix for one 20 µL reaction by adding the following components in the order listed below:\n10 µL of enzymatic mixture with DNA binding dye;\n2 µL of 25 mM MgCl2;\n1 µL of primer 1, 6 µM (final concentration: 300 nM);\n1 µL of primer 2, 6 µM (final concentration: 300 nM); and\n5 µL of water.\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare the PCR mix for more than one reaction, multiply the volumes above by the number of reactions to be run, plus one additional reaction.\nMix carefully by vortexing.\nPipet 19 µL of PCR mix, prepared above, into each well of a white multiwell plate.\nAdd 1 µL of concentration-adjusted DNA template, prepared in step 3.1.\n\tNOTE: For control reactions, always run a negative control with the samples. To prepare a negative control, replace the template DNA with water.\nSeal the white multiwell plate with sealing foil.",
    "Place the white multiwell plate in the centrifuge and balance it with a suitable counterweight (i.e., another multiwell plate). Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,500 x g in a standard swing-bucket centrifuge containing a rotor for multiwell plates with suitable adaptors.\nLoad the white multiwell plate into the HRM-PCR instrument.\nStart the HRM-PCR program with following PCR conditions:\n\tDenaturation: 95 °C for 10 min; 1 cycle.\n\tAmplification: 95 °C for 10 s, 62 °C for 15s, and 72 °C for 20s; 47 cycles.\n\tMelting curve: 95 °C; ramp rate: 0.02 °C/s; 25 acquisitions per °C; 1 cycle.\n\tCooling: 40 °C for 30 s; ramp rate 2.2 °C/s; 1 cycle.\n4. HRM Analysis to Determine the CR1 Length Polymorphism\nNOTE: The methodology described (Figure 5) is specific to our software (See the Table of Materials), although other software packages may be used.\nOpen a gene scanning software to perform the CR1 length polymorphism scanning analysis.\nOpen the experiment containing the amplification program and the melting curve program.\nClick Sample editor in the Module bar and then select the Scanning workflow.\nDefine the properties of the samples (i.e., name; unknown or negative control).\nClick Analysis in the Module bar.\nIn the Create New Analysis list, select Gene Scanning.\nClick the Normalization tab to normalize the melting curves.\nClick the Temperature shift tab to reset the temperature axis (x-axis) of the melting curves.\n\tNOTE: The lower graph shows melting curves that are both normalized and temperature-shifted.\nClick the Calculate button to analyze the results and determine the grouping.\nClick the Difference plot tab in the charts area to view the Normalized and Shifted Melting Curves and the Normalized and Temperature Shifted Difference Plot."
