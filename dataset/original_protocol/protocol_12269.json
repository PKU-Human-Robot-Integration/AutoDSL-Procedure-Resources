    "Avian embryos are not considered vertebrate animals under IUCAC regulations.\n1. Obtaining Embryos for Surgery\nIncubate 80 - 90 fertilized Bovan chicken eggs (blunt end up) in a humidified (60%) rocker incubator at 40 °C for approximately 72 hr to obtain embryos at Hamilton and Hamburger (HH) stage 17. Determine exact number of eggs based on power analysis and survival rate of embryos 17. Use plastic egg trays for incubation to allow adequate air circulation.\nOnce this desired developmental stage is attained, pour approximately 20 ml of warm (37 °C) Tyrode's buffer (supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (1 g/L)) into a 100 mm x 26 mm petri dish.\nSterilize an egg shell with 70% ethanol.\nGently crack the shell with a scalpel handle and carefully release its contents into the dish containing Tyrode's buffer. Discard embryos if (i) they visually appear abnormal (ii) they are not at the right developmental stage (iii) they are improperly oriented on the yolk and/or (iv) any bleeding occurs. Retain any embryos not subjected to surgery immediately after being placed ex ovo at 40 °C so as to not compromise development.\n\tNote: Staging is performed based on Hamilton and Hamburger 18. Abnormality of chick embryos is determined by the naked eye and under the dissection scope. Ensure that the embryo has appropriate folding and bending and vasculature.\n2. OFT Banding\nTweeze out individual 1 cm long threads from a single 11/0 nylon surgical suture and form a loose knot. UV sterilize all preformed knots.\nUnder a dissection microscope, visually ensure that the heart is beating at a normal rate (~ 120 beats/min). If not, discard the embryo.\nJust before surgery, apply 5 - 6 ml of warm (37 °C) Tyrode's buffer to the embryo surface using a transfer pipette.",
    "Pass one free end of the preformed knot under the OFT, position the suture at the OFT/ventricle junction (OVJ) (or desired location), and pass the free end into the knot thereby constricting the OFT including the membranes surrounding the heart.\nAfter surgery, wet the surface of the yolk with 5 - 6 ml of warm (37 °C) Tyrode's buffer using a transfer pipette.\nMaintain control embryos ex ovo as the banded embryos; however do not subject them to the surgical procedure.\nIncubate the embryos, for the desired amount of time, at 40 °C in a humidified (60%) incubator.\nOnce the desired time point is reached, excise the embryo from the yolk using straight scissors. Dissect the heart with fine forceps and use for several downstream studies such as changes in cardiac morphology due to altered hemodynamics 17.\n3. Confirming that the Banding Intervention Causes a Change in Hemodynamics\nNote: The partial constriction caused by the banding intervention leads to an increase in blood flow velocity at the OVJ. This hemodynamic parameter is conveniently assessed using 2D ultrasound imaging, which is performed at the desired time point of the experiment.\nSince only a single embryo can be imaged at a time, maintain all other embryos designated for ultrasound imaging in a 40 °C incubator.\nPlace the petri dish containing the embryo to be imaged on a heating pad set at 40 °C.\nFill the dish, up to the brim, with warm (37 °C) Tyrode's buffer. Slowly pour the buffer solution into the dish so as to keep the yolk intact. If, however, the integrity of the yolk is compromised during this step, discard the embryo.\nOrient the embryo such that the central axis of the embryo is perpendicular to the ultrasound probe which is suspended from an adjustable stand.",
    "With the ultrasound machine operating in B-mode, obtain a 2D image of the beating heart on the screen and move the stage (heating pad) such that the OFT, ventricle and OVJ are clearly visible.\nSwitch to the pulsed-wave (PW) mode, at the desired pulse repetition frequency (e.g., 20 kHz) and obtain velocity data exactly at the OVJ. A B-mode image of the beating heart is obtained on the screen.\n\t\nMove the stage to see the OFT, ventricle and the OVJ. Using the ultrasound machine software, obtain velocity measurements exactly at the OVJ.\nNote: If the heart rate of an embryo decreases during imaging, velocity data thus obtained should not be used for analysis. All embryos used for velocity measurements should preferably not be used for any other experiments after ultrasound imaging.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
