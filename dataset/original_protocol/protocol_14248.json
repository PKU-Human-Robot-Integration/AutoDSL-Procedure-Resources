    "All experiments were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Yale University.\n1. Set Up / Preparation of the Reagents.\nBleomycin\n\tCaution: Based on the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, bleomycin is classified as a GHS08 health hazard.\n\t\nPrepare bleomycin in a chemical hood. Resuspend 15 U into 5 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAliquot 100-200 µL of the solution into glass vials and freeze them at -20 °C for future use. Properly label the tubes with the date of resuspension. Use within 6 months from this date.\n\t\tNOTE: Each mouse strain has a different sensitivity to bleomycin26. Testing different doses of bleomycin for each mouse strain is recommended. The mouse strains and the corresponding doses of bleomycin used in representative experiments are listed in Table 1.\nMice\nPurchase mice needed for the experiment and allow mice 7 days to acclimate before injection. Perform infusions in a biosafety hood. Transfer animals housed in a non-BSL2 compliant room to a BSL2 room using standard institutional procedures prior to bleomycin infusion. Inject mice at 6-8 weeks of age.\n\t\tCaution: Inject mice following institutional guidelines for hazardous agents, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) and IACUC approval.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice purchased for the representative experiments are listed in the Table of Materials. Only male mice have been used.\nLung Cancer Cell Lines",
    "Culture desired cell lines in their respective media. Before injections, perform short tandem repeat DNA profiling or genetic testing to ensure proper cell line identification. To facilitate in vivo and ex vivo imaging, infect cell lines with a lentivirus expressing the thymidine kinase, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase fusion reporter27, and sort reporter positive cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to engraftment. Test lines for mycoplasma every 6 months.\n\t\t\nCulture H2030 human cancer cell line as recommended by the manufacturer using Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, and amphotericin B.\nCulture 368T1 murine cell line (derived from a KrasG12D;p53-/- mouse) using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, and amphotericin B.\nCulture PC9 human cancer cell line using RPMI with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, and amphotericin B.\n2. Bleomycin Treatment\nPlan to inject mice intratracheally with bleomycin 14 days prior to tumor cell engraftment.\nThaw bleomycin stock on ice 2 h prior to injection.\nOnce thawed, dilute bleomycin to the desired working concentration (0.02 U/50 µL or 0.005 U/50 µL), and keep it on ice.\n\tNOTE: Concentration of bleomycin depends on the mouse strain used for the experiments (Table 1). Titration of bleomycin in mice should be performed to determine optimal dose.\nPrepare anesthesia by diluting ketamine and xylazine to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively, Using a 1 mL syringe and 27 G needle, anesthetize each mouse by injecting intraperitoneally ketamine/xylazine solution at 100/10 mg/kg respectively.\nMonitor the breathing of mice and employ a toe pinch. Confirm proper anesthetization when mouse does not respond to toe pinch. Apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.",
    "Place 1 mouse at a time on an intubation platform by hanging its front teeth with its back against the platform.\nIlluminate the upper chest using a fiber-optic illuminator to help with visualization of the trachea. Open the mouth of the mouse and pull the tongue out gently with sterile flat forceps.\nUse an intravenous catheter without the needle to avoid blocking breathing. Position the catheter over the white light emitted from the opening of the trachea.\nInsert the catheter into the trachea until the top of the catheter reaches the front teeth. Confirm proper placement of the catheter in the trachea by visualizing the white light shining through the opening of the catheter in the mouth.\nUsing a pipette, dispense 50 µL of bleomycin or vehicle (PBS) directly into the catheter to ensure that the entire volume is inhaled. Perform this step under sterile conditions.\nIf the catheter is correctly inserted, the mouse will immediately inhale the contents of the catheter. Wait a few seconds until the entire volume travels down the catheter. Then remove the catheter from the trachea and dispose in 10% bleach solution.\n\tNOTE: The average time per mouse of steps 2.7-2.11 is around 5 min.\nIf the mouse is not inhaling the liquid, carefully monitor breathing and adjust the catheter position. If the mouse stops breathing, remove the catheter immediately and allow the mouse to resume breathing normally before re-inserting the catheter.\nPlace the injected mouse on an IACUC approved heating pad on their back on a flat surface for recovery. The whole procedure will take 10 min per mouse. Do not return an animal that has undergone injection to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nPlace a \"Hazardous Chemical in Use\" Card on the cage for 24 h.\n3. Monitoring Mice Post-Intubation",
    "Monitor the mice for respiratory distress immediately after intubation and then every 15 min until mice wake up from anesthesia. Do not leave mice unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nInject ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to alleviate pain.\nExamine the mice 24 h post intubation and 3 times a week for any signs of morbidity.\nKeep a record of the date of procedure, animal identification, type of procedure, type of anesthetic, and post-operative monitoring observations with times.\nMonitor the mice for weight loss, respiratory distress, behavioral abnormalities, and a body condition score <2 (segmentation of vertebral column evident/dorsal pelvic bones are palpable) bi-weekly following injection of bleomycin.\nEuthanize mice under respiratory distress or mice that have experienced 15% loss of body mass by CO2 or by ketamine/xylazine followed by cervical dislocation. Confirm euthanasia by conducting palpation for respiratory activity.\n4. Engraftment of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.\nNOTE: Perform engraftment of cells 14 days after the injection of bleomycin (step 2.1).\nAllow cells to grow in 75 cm2 flasks undisturbed for 3 days prior to the day of injection with corresponding media as stated in step 1.3.\n\tNOTE: They should be 80% confluent at the day of injection (which corresponds to 2-3 x 106 in each flask depending on the cell line).\nWash the cells growing on 75 cm2 flasks with 5 mL of PBS at room temperature.\nAspirate PBS and add 1.5 mL of trypsin to the cells and incubate the cells at 37 °C until the cells detach (typically 2-5 min).\n\tNOTE: We recommend checking every 2 min for cell detachment from the plastic by simple visualization of the bottom of the flask or under a light microscope. Do not exceed 5 min of incubation with trypsin.",
    "Neutralize trypsin by adding 4 mL of media containing 10% FBS (same media as step 4.1). Collect the cells into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge it at 200 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the media and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of PBS to wash cells. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 3 min at room temperature to pellet cells. Repeat this 1 time.\nAspirate the PBS and resuspend the pellet in 1.5 mL of PBS per flask.\nMix 50 µL of cell mixture with 50 µL of trypan blue and count the cells using a Cell Counter/Hemocytometer chamber28.\nPrepare cell suspension by diluting the cells in PBS to inject 1 x 105 cells (or other amount indicated) in 50 µL per mouse. Keep the cells on ice prior to injection.\n\tNOTE: Prepare at least two times more cells for injection to avoid running out of cell suspension.\nPrepare anesthesia by diluting ketamine and xylazine to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively, Using a 1 mL syringe and 27 G needle, anesthetize each mouse by injecting intraperitoneally ketamine/xylazine solution at 100/10 mg/kg respectively.\nMonitor the breathing of mice and employ a toe pinch. Confirm proper anesthetization when mouse does not respond to toe pinch. Apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace 1 mouse at a time on an intubation platform by hanging its front teeth with its back against the platform.\nIlluminate the upper chest using a fiber-optic illuminator to help with visualization of the trachea.\nResuspend the cells gently using a p200 pipette to make sure they do not form clumps. Open the mouth of the mouse and pull the tongue out gently with sterile flat forceps.",
    "Use an intravenous catheter with the needle removed to avoid blocking breathing. Position the catheter over the white light emitted from the opening of the trachea.\nInsert the catheter into the trachea until the top of the catheter reaches the front teeth. Confirm proper placement of the catheter in the trachea by visualizing the white light shining through the opening of the catheter in the mouth.\nUsing a pipette, dispense 50 µL of cells directly into the catheter to ensure that the entire volume is inhaled. Perform this step under sterile conditions.\n\tNOTE: If the catheter is correctly inserted, the mouse will immediately inhale the contents of the catheter.\nWait a few seconds until the entire volume travels down the catheter, and then remove the catheter from the trachea and dispose in 10% bleach solution.\nIf the mouse is not inhaling the liquid, carefully monitor breathing and adjust the catheter position. If the mouse stops breathing, remove the catheter immediately and allow the mouse to resume breathing normally before re-inserting the catheter.\n\tNOTE: The average time per mouse of steps 4.11-4.18 is around 5 min.\nPlace the injected mouse on an IACUC approved heating pad on their back on a flat surface for recovery.\n\tNOTE: The whole procedure will take 10 min per mouse. Do not return an animal that has undergone injection to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nShave the entire rib area both ventrally and dorsally of B6129SF1/J and other mouse strains with dark hair using an electric shaver prior to imaging.\n2-3 min after cell injection, inject 100 µL of luciferin retro-orbitally (15 mg/mL) using an insulin needle. Alternate the eye used for injection every imaging session.",
    "After at least 2 min, place up to 5 mice in an animal bioluminescence imager in the dorsal recumbency position and acquire a ventral picture using luminescence settings29.\nUnder the control panel adjust the resolution and sensitivity settings to measure luminescence of a given cell line. For most applications, start with 3 min (or \"Auto\" if saturated), binning=Medium (4), F/Stop=1, Field of View=D, Subject Height=1.50.\n\tNOTE: If the injection is successful, luminescence signal is detected in the upper chest area, in one lung or both lungs.\nFlip mice onto sternal recumbency position and acquire a dorsal picture as above.\n\tNOTE: If cell injection is not performed properly, cells may cluster at the entrance of the trachea or in the neck.\nInject ketoprofen 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally to alleviate pain.\nMove mice back to their cage and place a \"BSL-2 Agent in Use\" Card on the cage.\nMonitor mice for respiratory distress immediately after intubation, and then every 15 min until mice wake up from anesthesia. Do not leave mice unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nExamine the mice 24 h post intubation and three times a week for any signs of morbidity.\nKeep record in the logbook of the date of procedure, animal identification, type of procedure, type of anesthetic and post-operative monitoring observations and times.\nMonitor mice for weight loss, respiratory distress, behavioral abnormalities, and a body condition score <2 (segmentation of vertebral column evident/dorsal pelvic bones are palpable) bi-weekly following inoculation of bleomycin.\n\tNOTE: Mice with lung tumors may exhibit respiratory irritation, weight loss, cachexia, and/or death.\nEuthanize mice under respiratory distress or mice that have experienced 15% loss of body mass by CO2 or by ketamine/xylazine followed by cervical dislocation if collecting tissues. Confirm euthanasia by conducting palpation for respiratory activity.",
    "5. Monitoring of Tumor Growth by Bioluminescence Imaging\nRepeat imaging of the mice at day 3 post-engraftment and weekly thereafter.\nAnesthetize mice by injecting ketamine/xylazine (as described in steps 2.4-2.5) or by inhaled isoflurane (2%). Monitor breathing of mice and employ a toe pinch to confirm proper anesthetization. Apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nShave the entire rib area both ventrally and dorsally of B6129SF1/J and other mouse strains with dark hair using an electric shaver prior to imaging.\nOnce the mice are under anesthesia, inject 100 µL of luciferin retro-orbitally (15 mg/mL) using an insulin needle. Wait 2 min. Alternate the eye used for injection every imaging session.\nPlace mice in the imager and acquire dorsal and ventral images as described in steps 4.22-4.24.\nPlace mice back into the cage after imaging, on their back on a flat surface for recovery.\n\tNOTE: The whole procedure will take 5 min per group of 5 mice. Do not leave mice unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAnalyze the images using the imager/bioluminescence analysis software.\n\t\nSelect the appropriate images and load them as a group in the bioluminescence analysis software.\nClick ROI tool | square to add a square region of interest (ROI). Place the ROI over the upper chest area, covering the entire lung image. Repeat this for each mouse image.\nRight click and select Copy all ROI function to apply the same ROI to all images in the group and position them in the upper chest of the mice, both ventral and dorsal views.",
    "In the upper left corner of the image window, select the Photons function. Click the Measure control panel function to measure the ROIs. Copy and paste the output table containing total flux (photons/s) into a software of choice to analyze the data further.\nNormalize the daily ROI value of each mouse to its ROI value measured on day 0.\n6. Tissue Isolation and Processing.\nAnesthetize mice by injecting ketamine/xylazine (as described in steps 2.4-2.5 or by inhaled isoflurane (2%). Monitor breathing of mice and employ a toe pinch. Confirm proper anesthetization when mouse does not respond to toe pinch. Apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nInject 100 µL of luciferin retro-orbitally (15 mg/mL) using an insulin needle. Wait 2 min.\nImage mice following steps 4.22-4.24 from this protocol.\nInject into the other eye from step 6.2 another 100 µL of luciferin retro-orbitally using an insulin needle prior to euthanasia.\nEuthanize the mice by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (see step 2.4 for details) followed by cervical dislocation if mice are under deep anesthesia in accordance with guidelines provided by IACUC. Confirm euthanasia by conducting palpation for respiratory activity.\nUsing sterile surgical scissors make a skin incision below the sternum. Open the muscle layer along the diaphragm using forceps and surgical scissors and expose the thoracic cavity by cutting through the rib cage on either of the lateral sides avoiding the internal thoracic arteries.\nPerfuse the mouse by making a small incision in the right atrium of the heart and inject 5 mL of PBS through the left ventricle. The color of lung tissue will go from red to pale pink-white if the blood perfusion is done properly.",
    "Excise the lungs from the thoracic cavity carefully by grabbing the esophagus or heart with forceps. Gently pull the tissue and use surgical scissors to carefully cut connecting tissue avoiding puncture of the lung tissue. Preserve the trachea as much as possible for inflation of the lung airways at a later step.\nWash the lung by submerging and swirling the tissue 3 times in a 6 well plate filled with 3 mL of PBS to remove excess blood.\nPlace the lung onto the lid of a 6 well plate, and place the lid containing the tissue in the bioluminescent imager and acquire a luminescent image30.\n\tNOTE: We recommend selecting the following settings from the \"Acquisition control panel\" \"Field of view=A\" and \"Subject Height=0.75 cm\" and then \"Auto exposure\" to avoid getting saturated images.\nExcise and image other organs, as done in step 6.9-6.10, where metastasis have been identified by luminescence, such as brain, liver, adrenal, bone, lymph nodes, kidney or spleen31.\nPerfuse the lung with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde by inserting the needle into the trachea of the mouse. The lungs will inflate if well-perfused.\n\tCaution: 4% paraformaldehyde is a toxic, a health hazard GHS07 and GHS08.\nTransfer the lungs into a 15 mL conical with 5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde.\nFix the lungs or other tissues by incubating the tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C in a shaking device at 30-50 rpm.\nEmbed lungs (or other tissues) in paraffin or optimum cutting temperature compound depending on the application32.\n\tNOTE: Paraffin is the preferred method to preserve the lung structure and for Masson Trichrome and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining.\nSubscription Required.
