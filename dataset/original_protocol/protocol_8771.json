    "The procedures for animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of Toledo in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Institutes of Health and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Brain Extraction, Sectioning and Tissue Preparation\nSacrifice wild-type mouse strain C57BL/6 by deeply euthanizing with CO2 asphyxiation for 5 min. Assure death by cervical dislocation.\nClean the mouse head with 70% ethanol.\nPerform craniectomy using sterile scissors and forceps by first pulling the skin off, starting with the top of the head to expose the skull.\nThen, when the skull is exposed, remove the skull by peeling the bone piece-by-piece, starting from the posterior side and moving toward the anterior side. Be cautious not to destroy the brain ventricles.\nCollect the whole brain.\nPlace the brain in a 100 mm Petri dish containing DMEM/High-Glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution containing 10,000 units/ml of penicillin and 10,000 µg/ml of streptomycin and pre-warmed to 37 °C.\nSlice the brain on the median sagittal plane by hand with a sharp blade, and obtain the first 100-200 mm section from each half using a vibratome.\nRinse the brain tissue with pre-warmed 37 °C phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) solution.\nImmediately place the brain section in DMEM/High-Glucose media pre-warmed to 37 °C.\n2. Live Imaging Configuration and Setup\nPlace the brain tissue sections in 30 mm glass-bottom culture dishes containing 1 ml of DMEM/High-Glucose media. Adjust the microscope’s enclosed chamber environment to 37 °C, 95%/5% O2/CO2 content (Figure 1).",
    "Using a 60X objective oil immersion lens, collect the ependymal cells/cilia images by first placing an oil drop on the 60X objective lens and focusing on the cells with regular DIC transmitted light.\nThen, follow the direction of the DMEM bubble movement as a guide to the location of the motile ependymal cilia as ciliary beatings create a kind of bubble movement in the area. Choose an area containing healthy cells with motile cilia in the brain’s lateral ventricle using the DIC filter. Once the ependymal cilia are found, adjust the light and focus to obtain a satisfactory image.\nSet the live imaging parameters according to a specific purpose using Metamorph imaging software. In the present demonstration, acquire twenty four-bit images with the camera binning set to 1 x 1 combined with 60X objective and 5-10 msec exposure time.\nCollect the DIC images by opening the microscope aperture to an optimal level in order to have a minimum exposure time. Observe live images stream to the camera to provide fast and immediate image acquisition without delay. Calculate the speed of cilia beating based on the requirement of the minimal exposure times to obtain sufficient image contrast.\n3. Data Visualization and Analysis\nCalculate the number of cilia beatings by counting the number of beatings in 1 min. Do this by decreasing the speed of the video and counting the number of beats using a cell counter or similar tool.\nTo calculate the frequency of beatings, multiply the exposure time at which the video is recorded by the number of the frames or time-lapse images acquired to get the number of sec. (Example: exposure time 5 msec 200 frames = 1,000 msec or 1 sec).",
    "Calculate the number of beatings in one second to obtain the frequency which is expressed as the number of beating per one sec. Do this by dividing the number of cilia beatings over a one-second time interval (Example: cilia beats 50 times in a 200 frames video recorded at exposure time of 5 msec i.e. 5 msec x 200 frames = 1 sec; now divide 50 beats by 1 sec = 50 Hz).\nCalculate the ciliary beating angle by evaluating the path taken by the ependymal cilia during both the power and recovery strokes. Perform this according to a previously described method, with minor modifications 11. The precise movement of individual cilia is observed during the complete beat cycle.\nOn an acetate sheet placed over the monitor, draw a horizontal line along the ependymal edge and a vertical line through the midline position of the cilia at the start of the power stroke.\nPlot the precise position of the cilium frame by frame as it moves forward during the power stroke. In a similar manner, plot the movement of the cilia during the recovery stroke.\nCalculate the ciliary beating angle from the maximum deviation of the cilium from the midline during the power stroke as well as the recovery stroke.\n4. Calcium Signal Recording\nAfter slicing the brain, briefly rinse the brain slice with 1x PBS or Dulbecco’s PBS (pH 7.0). Prepare fresh Fluo-2 to avoid fluorescence quenching and to obtain good signal-to-noise ratio.\nPrepare 1 mM stock solution of Fluo-2 solution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), mix and vortex the solution for at least 5 min to ensure that Fluo-2 is homogenously dissolved in DMSO.\nDilute the Fluo-2 stock solution in 500 ml of DMEM/High-Glucose supplemented with 2% B27 pre-warmed to 37 °C to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml.",
    "NOTE: B-27 is an optimized serum-free supplement containing vitamin A, antioxidant cocktail and insulin used to support short- or long-term viability of hippocampal and other CNS neurons.\nImmediately incubate the brain slice with 20 mg/ml Fluo-2 for 30 min at 37 °C in a glass-bottom plate.\nTo determine the optimal loading concentration of calcium fluorophore Fluo-2 and to avoid calcium dye cell toxicity, challenge cells with ATP, and check the cell viability by determining the time course and peak magnitude of calcium signals in response to ATP.\nRecord the video for calcium oscillation at a capture rate of 5 msec for a minimum of 1 sec (200 frames per sec), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 515 nm, respectively (Movie 2).\nTo distinguish the Fluo-2 calcium signal from autofluorescence or movement artifacts, ensure that the intensities emitted at 515 nm is monitored separately.\n\tNOTE: Fluo-2 is not the calcium fluoremetric suitable to quantify intracellular calcium. However, it is an excellent dynamic calcium dye to detect fast calcium changes, such as calcium oscillations. For more accurate calcium quantification, Fura-2 is recommended. However, the dynamic changes of Fura-2 are limited by its ratiometric nature of the dye.\nFollow the formulas provided by the manufacturer to calculate the exact free intracellular calcium values. Example [Ca2+] = Kd × (R–Rmin)/(Rmax – R). Where Kd is the dissociation constant of the dye from the released calcium, R is the measured fluorescence at 488, and Rmin and Rmax are the fluorescence ratios at minimum and maximum ion concentration 12.\n5. Immunofluorescence Microscopy\nFix the brain sections with phosphate buffered saline solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 2% sucrose for 10 min. Alternatively, fix the whole brain with 4% PFA and then section into 50 mm sections using a cryostat.",
    "Wash the tissue three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each time.\nIncubate the brain slice with a solution of 0.1% Triton-X in 1x PBS for 5 min, then rinse three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each time.\nIncubate the brain slice with mouse primary antibody, antiacetylated a-tubulin, used at a dilution of 1:5,000 in 10% FBS in 1x PBS for one hour at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the tissue three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each time.\nIncubate the brain slice in secondary antibody, fluorescein anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:500 in 10% FBS in 1x PBS solution for 1 hr at RT.\nBefore observation under a fluorescent microscope, counterstain the section with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min to stain the nucleus (or DNA) 13. To minimize photobleaching, image the sections immediately with minimum exposure time possible.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
