    "1. ZIF-8 synthesis\nFor the purpose of this example, use a 1:10:100 (metal:linker:solvent) mass ratio to synthesize the ZIF-8. For this, measure out zinc nitrate hexahydrate, and record the measurement. Utilize the example mass ratio to calculate the amount needed for the linker, 2-methylimidazole, and the solvent (i.e., methanol).\nPlace the zinc nitrate hexahydrate and linker into two different glass vials. Add half of the calculated amount of methanol to the zinc nitrate hexahydrate and the other half to the linker. Allow each solution to dissolve.\nCombine the two solutions (i.e., solutions containing the metal and linker, respectively). Place the container with the combined solution for the reaction onto a stir plate and stir at 700 rpm for 24 h at room temperature (RT).\n2. ZIF-8 collection\nOnce the above reaction has concluded (i.e., after 24 h), place the solution into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 3,075 x g for 5 min (use equal amounts and balance the rotor). Remove any of the supernatants from the centrifuged tubes.\nAdd methanol (5-15 mL) to the centrifuge tubes and redisperse the particles.\nRepeat the centrifugation and washing steps at least two to four more times. After the last wash, discharge the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: The washing steps remove any non-precipitated species.\nRemove the lids of the tubes and place parafilm tape over the top; subsequently, poke holes in the parafilm. Place the tube/s containing the sample in a vacuum chamber at RT to dry for 24 h.\n3. ZIF-8 surface morphology (scanning electron microscopy [SEM])\nMount the dry powders of ZIF-8 onto carbon tape and sputter for 120 s with gold-palladium to prevent any charging that could occur during the SEM analysis.",
    "Set the accelerating voltage of the microscope to 15 kV. Bring the particles into focus and adjust the magnification (magnifications of 500x, 1,000x, 1,500x, 4,000x, 10,000x, 20,000x, 30,000x, and 40,000x were used.)\nImage the particles under the magnification that allows both a clear particle size and morphology assessment (recommended to consider ranges for particles of 5 µm, 10 µm, and 20 µm).\nCollect data from at least three different fields of view, and for each, consider different magnifications.\n4. ZIF-8 elemental composition\nFollow the steps for SEM imaging.\nUsing the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy unit of the SEM microscope, analyze the sample elemental composition.\nMake sure the SEM accelerating voltage and magnification match the EDX monitor. Turn off the infrared camera on the SEM microscope.\nOn the EDX monitor, go to Collect Spectrum and input a collection time of 200 s. This is recommended to avoid particle charging and disintegration that could lead to false evaluations.\nCollect data from at least three different fields of view. Once the collection is finished, analyze the data, and identify the elements of interest.\n5. Cell culture\nCulture immortalized BEAS-2B cells in media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: Passages between 5-10 should be used to ensure that no phenotypical changes have previously taken place in the cell batch being used37 (all reagents are listed in the Table of Materials).\nTake a 100 mm cell culture plate and place 10 mL of the media onto the plate. Add 1 mL of the BEAS-2B cell solution to the plate.\nPlace the plate into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and allow the cells to grow.",
    "Check the plate after 24 h to determine if the cells have reached 80% confluency. Herein, the 80% confluency refers to the percentage of the surface covered by adhered cells. If not, change the media and allow the cells to grow until the 80% confluency level is reached.\n6. Cell counting\nOnce the cells on the plate have reached a confluency of 80%, remove the media from the plate. Wash the plate with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nRemove the PBS from the plate. Add 2 mL of trypsin to the plate and place it in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 2 min.\nAdd 2 mL of media to the plate and pipet the media up and down to remove the cells from the plate. Transfer the solution to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 123 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant from the tube and add 2 mL of media. Pipet the media up and down to redisperse the cells.\nUsing a 1.5 mL tube, add 20 µL of trypan blue and then 20 µL of the cell solution (1:1 ratio of trypan blue:cell solution).\nPlace 10 µL of the cell mixture onto a glass slide and place it onto an automatic cell counter. Wait until the screen comes into focus, then select capture.\nThe screen displays the live cell numbers and cell viability. The measurement range extends from 1 x 104-1 x 107 cells.\nAlternatively, count the cells manually using a hemocytometer.\n\t\nFor this, add 15-20 µL of the trypan blue-treated cell solution to the hemocytometer.\nUse an upright microscope with a 10x objective focus on the grid lines of the hemocytometer.",
    "Count the number of cells in the four outer squares and divide the number by four. Then, multiply by 10,000 to obtain the live cell count number.\nTo calculate cell viability, add together the live and dead cell count to obtain the total cell count, and subsequently divide the live cell count by the total cell count.\n7. ZIF-8 dose preparation\nMake a ZIF-8 stock solution of 1 mg/mL. For this, measure the amount of ZIF-8 and add deionized (DI) water to the particles to reach a 1 mg/mL concentration.\nSonicate (set the sonicator to sonics) the ZIF-8 stock solution for 2 min at 30 s intervals in a water bath.\nMake different doses of ZIF-8 for cellular exposures by calculating the amount of stock solution and Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) needed to reach the desired doses using the equation C1V1 = C2V2. The doses will range from 0-950 µg/mL.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, doses of 0 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, 100 µg/mL, 250 µg/mL, 500 µg/mL, 750 µg/mL, and 950 µg/mL were selected.\n8. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC  50)\nAfter cell counting, seed the BEAS-2B cells at a density of 4 x 104 cells/mL in a 96-well plate, with a volume of 100 µL/well.\n\t\nTo reach a density of 4 x 104 cells/mL, use C1V1 = C2V2 to calculate the amount of cell solution needed to be combined with the media.\nEnsure to maintain blank wells for each dose; leave these wells empty until ZIF-8 exposure.\nPlace the 96-well plate into the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and allow the cells to grow to a confluent monolayer for 24 h.",
    "Remove the media from the wells and expose the BEAS-2B cells to ZIF-8 doses ranging from 0-950 µg/mL. Add 100 µL of ZIF-8 to their respective blank and cell wells.\nPlace the 96-well plates back into the incubator for an exposure time of 48 h.\nAfter the exposure, add 10 µL of 4-[3-(4-idophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) to each well (blank and cell wells) and incubate for 2 h. The media remains in the wells; the ratio is 1:10 (reagent:media).\nRead the changes in absorbance on a plate reader using a 485 nm absorbance.\nCalculate the cell viability through the software to determine the IC50 value (see section 10).\n9. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)\nUse a 96-well plate (96W10idf) to perform ECIS analysis. The plate28 contains inter-digitated finger connection electrodes covering an area of about 4 mm2.\nFirst, test that all the wells are being read by the sensors. For this, place the 96-well plate onto the well station and click on the Setup button.\nIf the wells are connected properly, green will appear; any unconnected wells will be identified as red. If such a case arises, remove and reinsert the well plate and click the Setup button again, until all the wells offer viable green readings.\nStabilize the electrodes for 40 min with 200 µL of media per well to prevent potential drift. Add 200 µL of media to each well being used and then place the 96-well plate onto the ECIS station. Click on Setup/Check to ensure the plate is properly connected. Click on Stabilize.\nOnce stabilization is complete, remove the plate from the station and remove the media from each well.",
    "Seed the BEAS-2B cells at a density of 4 x 104 cells/mL, with a volume of 100 µL per well, into the wells containing the cells and place the plate onto the ECIS station in the incubator.\nOn the monitor, click on Check to determine that all the electrodes are read by the sensors on the station.\nSet up the time course measurement by selecting Multiple Freq/Time (MFT). The program will measure each well at seven different frequencies.\nClick Start and allow it to run for 24 h so the cells can form a confluent monolayer.\nAfter 24 h, the wells containing cells will show increased resistance on the monitor. This is an indicator that cells have attached to the electrodes.\nPress Pause on the monitor to stop the data collection.\nMake the ZIF-8 doses at, above, and below the calculated IC50 value by following the steps outlined in section 7 above.\nExpose the ZIF-8 nanoparticles to their respective blank and cell wells at a volume of 100 µL per well and place the 96-well plate back onto the station.\nClick on Check again on the monitor to ensure the sensors are reading all the electrodes. Click on Resume and allow the system to run for 72 h to monitor the cellular behavior and attachment.\nOnce data collection has finished, click on Finish on the monitor. To save the file, click File > Save As. Save the data as a spreadsheet file.\nTo get the alpha parameters, click on Model. On the screen pop-up, click on Media-Only Well, then select the well that has only media.\nClick on Set Ref. On the monitor, click on Find.\nIf the well shown in the system is not the same as what was chosen, repeat step 9.16.",
    "Click on Set. Click on Fit T-Range to determine the time range desired for data collection.\nWhile it is processing, click on Alpha. When the system finishes the analysis, click on Save RbA and save it as a spreadsheet file.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the ECIS manual, which can be found on the manufacturer's website38.\n10. Data analysis\nSEM\n\t\nOpen the imaging software to analyze the SEM images. Click File > Open, and then select the image to analyze.\nClick on Image > Type > 8 Bits to convert the image to grayscale to perform the threshold operation.\nCalibrate the distance measurement of pixels to microns. Click on the Straight-Line tool and trace the length of each particle aimed to be measured.\nClick Analyze and then Set Scale. The known distance will be set to the length of the size of the scale bar on the SEM image. The known unit of length will be set to microns. Check Global and press Ok.\nClick on the Straight-Line tool and trace the diameter of the particle, then select Analyze and Measure. Record the length result.\nRepeat for all the collected images. Average all the diameters from at least 60 particles for a suitable statistics evaluation.\nEDX\n\t\nAverage all the weight percentages of each element together from all the collected images (see EDX section above).\nUsing a spreadsheet, plot a bar graph of each element on the x-axis and their average elemental weight percentage on the y-axis.\nIC50​\n\t\nAverage the blank wells and average the dose wells for each replicate.\nCalculate the adjusted blank by subtracting the control blank average from the dose blank average. Calculate the true cell value for each dose by subtracting the adjusted blank from the average dose value.",
    "Subtract the adjusted blank value for each dose from the average control value. Calculate the cell viability of each dose utilizing the equation: cell viability = (true cell value/(control value - adjusted blank value)) x 100.\nRepeat this for all other replicates.\nAverage the cell viability for each replicate together to get the final cell viability for each dose.\nIn the software, choose the XY tab on the screen.\nEnter the concentration (dose) values into the X column and the cell viability (%) from each dose into the Y column.\nTransform the X values by clicking Analyze > Transform > Ok, and Transform X = Log(X).\nNormalize the Y values by selecting the Transformed Data sheet, clicking on Analyze, and then selecting Normalize.\nSelect the Normalize of Transform data sheet, click Analyze, and select Nonlinear Regression (Curve Fit). Select Dose-Response-Inhibition and click Log(Inhibitor) Vs. Response-Variable Slope (Four Parameters). Click on OK to view the results.\nECIS\n\t\nFrom the spreadsheet, take the resistance (ohm) columns for each replicate (blank wells and dose wells) and average them together from the 4,000 Hz frequency. This frequency allows cell-cell contact evaluation38.\nCalculate the corrected resistance by subtracting the averaged blank from the averaged dose for each replicate. Average the corrected resistance for the replicates for each dose.\nRepeat the same steps for the alpha values to calculate the average alpha parameter. Plot the x-axis as time (h) and the y-axis as the average resistance/alpha values for each dose value.\n11. Statistical analysis\nSEM\n\t\nPerform a standard deviation in the spreadsheet file where the average diameters of the ZIF-8 particles were calculated.\nUtilizing the STDEV function in the spreadsheet, highlight the data of the 60 particles and click Enter. Graph the standard deviation for each average diameter calculated.\nEDX",
    "Similar to SEM (steps 11.1.1-11.1.2), calculate the standard deviation for each average elemental composition using the STDEV function in the spreadsheet. Graph the standard deviations for each average elemental composition.\nIC50​\n\t\nOpen the software utilized to calculate the IC50 and click on Grouped Data Sheet.\nEnter the ZIF-8 doses in the rows labeled Group A, Group B, etc. Enter the average cell viability for each dose and replicate in the column corresponding with the ZIF-8 dose.\nClick on Analyze, and under Column Analyses, select One-way ANOVA (and nonparametric or mixed).\nIn the Experimental Design tab, select No Matching Or Pairing. Under Gaussian Distribution Of Residuals, select Yes use ANOVA.
