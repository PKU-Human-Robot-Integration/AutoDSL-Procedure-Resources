    "1. Prepare Animal and Equipment for Procedure\nBefore beginning surgery, prepare the surgical area and the animal. Make the carotid catheter by inserting a 23-gauge blunt needle into one end of 12\" of PE50 tubing. Cut an approximately 45° bevel in the opposite end of the catheter. Sterilize equipment prior to the procedure. Wear a hair bonnet, surgical mask, and sterile gloves.\nPlace a heating pad on the surface where the surgery will be performed. Activate it and allow it to warm. Cover the area with an absorbent bench pad.\nVerify that you have 25% mannitol in solution without crystals. If crystals are present, dissolve them by placing the vial in a hot water bath at 80 °C and agitating periodically.\nRecord the mass of the animal.\nMake a propofol dilution for delivery at 0.8 mg/kg/min at a rate of 0.1 ml/min.\nPlace the rat in the induction box for 3 min. Settings: 5% isoflurane, 2 L/min flow rate on ventilator.\nOn top of a disposable towel, shave the neck and both inner thighs.\n2. Intubate the Rat\nPlace the animal back in the induction box for 3 min.\nPrepare your endotracheal tube with an IV catheter. For this size and strain of rat, we use an 18 ga catheter. The tube must be large enough to allow adequate airflow, but small enough to fit into the trachea without causing damage. Pull the needle out of the plastic catheter and carefully break the needle approx. 1 cm from its sharp tip. The bunted needle will be your stylus. Put the needle back into the catheter.\nHang the rat by its teeth on an angled surface.\nShine a light directly against the animal's neck and lined up between its ears.",
    "Insert a small spatula approx. 3 cm into the oropharynx. Lift upward while gently pulling the tongue out of the mouth.\nVisualize the opening of the trachea. You will see a small hole open and close with each breath.\nGently insert catheter into the hole. You can sometimes feel the plastic enter the cartilage of the trachea. The trachea is sensitive. Do not force the catheter.\nSet the ventilator to 1 L/min and 60 bpm and the isoflurane to 2%.\nConnect the catheter to the ventilator and tape the tube to the operating surface.\nVerify the animal is anesthetized by performing a toe pinch.\n3. Establish Propofol IV Anesthesia\nSecure the rat by taping all four limbs and the tail to the operating surface.\nScrub the shaved neck and groin sites with chlorhexidine soap three times. Then scrub with chlorhexidine rinse three times.\nAttach a syringe of propofol to an IV extension set. Mount the syringe on an infusion pump.\nUsing a scalpel, cut through the skin of the shaved thigh. Avoid cutting muscle.\nOpen the incision with forceps to visualize the femoral vein.\nPull away tissue over the artery to expose the vessel.\nInsert a 26 ga monoject veterinary IV catheter into vein. When the needle punctures the wall of the vein you will feel it become easier to push. Retract the needle and push the catheter into the vessel.\nStart the propofol infusion at 0.1 ml/min.\n3-5 min after beginning the propofol infusion, switch the anesthesia gas to a mixture of 50% O2 and 50% N2O and shut off the isoflurane.\n4. Expose the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery\nMake a midline incision at the neck with scalpel blade.\nCut between the two large salivary glands with scissors or scalpel.",
    "Dissect away tissue lateral to the midline to expose the carotid artery. Use forceps to open layers of tissue. You can use scissors to remove pieces that you expose with the forceps and determine to be minimally vascular. Control bleeding with gauze, cotton swabs, and cautery if necessary.\nInject 3 ml saline IP if there has been moderate to heavy bleeding.\nUse retractors to pull tissue away from the carotid. Find the bifurcation.\nExpose the occipital artery just distal to the bifurcation. Cauterize it between forceps and separate it with an electrocautery.\nUse forceps to fully expose the carotid bifurcation and as much of the ECA as possible.\nExpose the superior thyroid artery branching off the ECA distal to the occipital artery. Cauterize it between forceps and separate it with an electrocautery.\n5. Catheterize the External Carotid Artery\nPlace 2 lengths of 4/0 silk under the ECA.\nGrab 1 length of suture with your hemostat and retract the ECA back caudally (toward the rat's feet).\nTake the other suture and tie as far cranially (toward the rat's mouth) as possible with a surgeon's knot. This forms a permanent ligature to sacrifice the ECA.\nRemove the first hemostat (the one that was applying caudal tension) and grab the other suture (the one that is knotted around the ECA) and apply gentle tension cranially with the hemostat.\nTie another surgeon's knot loosely (do not secure - leave barely tied) distal to the bifurcation and proximal to the permanent ligature.\nIrrigate with 1% lidocaine to relax the artery.\nFill your catheter with heparinized saline.\nPlace a temporary vessel clip as close as possible to the bifurcation. Place vessel clip at an angle to maximize space for catheterization. Slide the loose knot toward the clip.",
    "Make a small arteriotomy (cut) in ECA just proximal to the ligature using microscissors. There should be no bleeding if the clip and ligature are secure.\nUsing forceps to control the ECA walls, feed the beveled end of the catheter into the vessel.\nSecure the catheter with the loose suture knot. Tie the artery around the catheter.\nRemove the clip and clean the area with a cotton swab.\nAdvance the catheter to about 1 mm distal to bifurcation. Hold the artery with forceps proximal to the knot to ensure the vessel is immobilized.\n6. Administer Mannitol\nFill an 8\" IV extension set and a 6 ml syringe with mannitol without creating any air bubbles. Store this in the incubator at 37 °C. Note: work quickly with mannitol - it will readily precipitate out of solution at room temperature.\nIn order to visualize BBBD, you may administer Evans blue dye and watch it enter the areas of the brain where the barrier has been disrupted. To do this, give the animal 2 ml/kg of 2% Evans Blue through a new IV site on leg contralateral to the propofol infusion.\nAttach the extension set to a 5 μm filter and fill it with mannitol to remove air bubbles. Then, attach this to the stopcock without creating bubbles.\nAdminister mannitol at 0.09 ml/sec for 25 sec. Watch for the mannitol to reach equilibrium with the flow in common carotid at a point just proximal to the ICA. It should appear to pulse with the rat's heart rate. If the mannitol simply flows down toward the heart you have overcome the rat's blood pressure. This can cause life-threatening complications and poor BBBD.\nSubscription Required.
