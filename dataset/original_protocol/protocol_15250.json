    "1. Cell culture and induction conditions\nNOTE: In the following experiments, three strains are used: E. coli BL21 (DE3) with an empty vector, E. coli BL21 (DE3) with plasmids pAfcA14 and pET28:green fluorescent protein (GFP), and E. coli BL21 (DE3) with plasmids pAfcB14 and pET28:GFP. All strains are grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or minimal media with appropriate antibiotics. Prepare stock solutions of 1,000x kanamycin (50 mg/mL) and carbenicillin (100 mg/mL) in deionized (DI) water.\nMedia preparation\nPrepare LB media by adding 25 g of LB powder stock to 1 L of DI water. Autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 20 min to sterilize. Wait until the sterilized LB media temperature is below 60 °C before addition of 1 µL of antibiotic stock for every 1 mL of LB media.\nTo prepare LB plates, add 15 g agar to the LB media before sterilization. Wait until the sterilized LB agar temperature is below 60 °C before addition of antibiotic.\n1.1.3 For the biosensing cells, prepare media or plates with dual antibiotics, kanamycin and carbenicillin.\nCarbohydrate inducers\nPrepare stock solutions of the carbohydrate inducers at molar equivalents to 20 g/L of lactose: 29 g/L of 2’-FL and 3-FL.\n\t\tNOTE: Each 200 µL of cells will require 20 µL of 2’-FL or 3-FL.\nInduce 200 µL of cells with 2.0 g/L final concentration of lactose or 2.9 g/L final concentration of 2’-FL/3-FL. Incubate at 37 °C with continuous shaking and let cultures grow overnight.\nCell culture\nThe day before the experiment seed 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and carbenicillin from a fresh bacterial colony, using sterile technique.\nIncubate all cultures at 37 °C with agitation and grow the cultures overnight.",
    "Transfer 50 µL of overnight culture into 5 mL of fresh LB/M9 media with kanamycin and carbenicillin. Incubate at 37 °C with continuous shaking and grow until culture has reached optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5–0.7. At this mid-log phase, the cells can be induced.\n2. Measurement of fluorescence and limits of detection\nPreparation of cells for flow cytometry\nTransfer the overnight cultures to 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuge at 12,500 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 500 µL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 6 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM NaH2PO4, 145 mM NaCl in DI water, pH 7.2) to prepare a single cell suspension and transfer the single cell suspension to 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.\nKeep the cells in the dark at 4 °C until running the samples on a flow cytometer. For best results, analyze the cells as soon as possible.\nSelect 488 nm laser to excite GFP. Collect fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence levels (20,000–40,000 events, gated for forward and side scatter to avoid aggregated cells and debris) with a 525/50 nm bandpass filter.\nCalibrating the biosensor\nTo make a calibration curve, make 8–10 dilutions of the standard 2’-FL in the range 0–2,500 mg/L.\nCulture the 2’-FL biosensing cells (containing pAfcA and pET28:GFP) and induce them with the standard dilutions, as described previously in section 1.3. Carry out three biological replicates for each dilution.\n3. Detection and quantification of 2’-FL in a producer strain\nCultivation of producer strain",
    "For making minimal media, prepare separate solutions of 1 M K2HPO4, FeSO4·7H2O, sodium citrate, and 1 M thiamine-HCl. Sterilize the solutions using a 0.22 µm filter. Mix M9 media broth powder with 1 L of DI water. Autoclave the M9 solution at 121 °C for 15 min. Cool the solution down to 50 °C. Add MgSO4, CaCl2, K2HPO4, FeSO4·7H2O, sodium citrate, and thiamine to final concentrations of 2 mM, 0.1 mM, 12 g/L, 11 mg/L, 75 mg/L, and 7.5 µg/L, respectively.\nStart a culture of 2’-FL producing strain, e.g., JM109 gwBC-F2, in 5 mL of LB media and let it grow overnight at 37 °C, as described in Baumgartner et al.12.\nSubculture at 1% as described earlier in step 1.3.3 in 250 mL of the minimal media prepared in step 3.1.1. Add glycerol to a final concentration of 10 g/L and incubate the culture at 37 °C.\nWhen the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5–0.7, add isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and lactose to a final concentration of 2 g/L.\nIncubate at 37 °C with continuous shaking and let cultures grow for 24 h.\nExtraction of 2’-FL\nTransfer the overnight cultures to sterile 50 mL tubes and centrifuge at 900 x g for 15 min.\n3.2.2 Discard supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in DI water. Repeat the wash step three times to remove residual lactose and finally re-suspend in 5 mL of DI water.\nTo lyse the cell suspension, use a sonicator at 30% power, in 30 s pulses. Keep the cells on ice at all times.\nCentrifuge the lysed cells for 25 min at 2,000 x g. Remove the supernatant, pass it through a sterile (e.g., 0.22 µm) filter and store it at 4 °C until analysis.\nQuantification with biosensor",
    "Inoculate a culture of 2’-FL biosensing cells and at mid-log phase, induce with cell lysate equivalent to estimated concentrations of 2’-FL used to make the calibration curve as described in section 2.2. Perform the calibration in the same milieu as the sample to be analyzed (e.g., cell lysate) by adding dilutions of 2’-FL to control (i.e., non-producer) filtered cell lysate before inducing biosensor cells.\nRun the samples on a flow cytometer. Generate a dose-response curve by plotting the fluorescence output against the oligosaccharide concentration. Compare the response of the standards to the cell lysate.\n4. Selective removal of lactose\nNOTE: The biosensing cells are sensitive to lactose and it is desirable for the biosensor to selectively detect HMOs over lactose. One strategy would include washing of cells as described in section 3.2. Three other strategies are described below.\nTreatment with commercial purified β-galactosidase\nDissolve lyophilized β-galactosidase to 1,000 (FCC lactase) units/mL, in 1 mM MgCl2 or use commercial β-galactosidase in solution.\nTo determine the optimum concentration of enzyme needed, grow an inoculum of 2’-FL biosensing cells and induce with 2 g/L lactose and 2.9 g/L 2’-FL at mid log phase.\nTo 100 µL cultures, add variable amounts of β-galactosidase, up to 12 units, and let the cultures grow overnight at 37 °C with continuous shaking.\nMeasure the fluorescence as described in section 2.1 and calculate the optimum units of enzyme needed by determining the minimum enzyme concentration to achieve desired attenuation of signal.\nTo 2’-FL producing cells grown for 24 h, add optimum units of β-galactosidase and incubate overnight at 37 °C. Proceed with the protocol for determining the 2’-FL titer as described in section 3.3.\nPre-treatment with LacZ+ strain",
    "Start a 25 mL culture of 2’-FL producing strain and once induced at mid-log phase, incubate the culture at 37 °C for 24 h.\nInoculate an E. coli BL21 (DE3) culture in LB, grow it to mid-log phase at 37 °C and add 50 mL of the culture (2:1) to the 24 h culture.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 3 h. Proceed with the protocol for determining the 2’-FL titer as described in section 3.3.\nLactose precipitation with ethanol\n\tNOTE: This section is adapted from Matsuki et al.12.\n\t\nStart a 25 mL culture of 2’-FL producing strain and once induced at mid-log phase, incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.\nAdd two volumes of 100% ethanol to the culture, shake well, and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 900 x g for 15 min. Collect the supernatant and incubate overnight at 4 °C, which precipitates the lactose.\nRemove the precipitated lactose by passing the solution through a filter paper (11 µm). Collect the filtrate that is the cell lysate containing the 2’-FL, which can be quantified by following section 3.3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
