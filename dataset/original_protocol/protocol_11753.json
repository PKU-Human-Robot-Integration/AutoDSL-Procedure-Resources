    "All experiments involving the use of zebrafish were carried out in accordance with protocols established by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Sample preparation\nSet up a mating pair of Tg(Rx3:GFP) zebrafish in a gated cross tank the night before imaging is planned. The following morning pull the gate as the lights come on in the fish facility34,35.\n\tNOTE: The mating pair of fish selected should be between 4 months to 2 years in age and are easily distinguished as male or female based on body shape and coloration35.\nCheck the crosses every half hour for embryos and note what time embryos are first visualized in the bottom of the cross tank. Transfer the embryos to a Petri dish and maintain the embryos at 28.5 °C for approximately 10 h to develop to the 1-2 somite stage (ss). Begin to image at the 1-2 somite stage (ss).\nTo screen for the presence of somites, observe the embryos under a stereoscope at 10 hpf and count the number of somites1.\n\tNOTE: Any embryos that are beyond the single somite stage should not be used for this experiment.\nOut of the embryos that are at the single somite stage, screen for GFP expression using a fluorescence adapter in combination with a stereomicroscope to confirm the presence of the Rx3:GFP transgene. Once 3-5 GFP positive individuals have been identified, use fine forceps to dechorionate the embryos and transfer them into a small Petri dish containing E3 embryo buffer with a glass pipette35.\nAnesthetize the embryos by transferring them into 0.5 mL E3 embryo buffer (pH 7) containing 0.168 mg/mL Tricaine (MS222) in a microcentrifuge tube35,36. Spontaneous muscle movements begin as early as 17 hpf37. Ensure that embryos are anesthetized to image beyond this timepoint.",
    "Embed the embryos in 1% low melting temperature agarose in 0.168 mg/mL Tricaine and E3.\n\tNOTE: This is the optimal concentration of low melting temperature agarose to allow for the embryo to be held in place but remain pliable enough to permit the growth of the embryo over the imaging time-course30,31.\nPrepare a 10 mL solution of 2% low melting temperature agarose in E3 buffer. Heat it in a microwave oven to dissolve agarose using 15 s intervals, to prevent the solution from boiling over. Allow the solution to cool enough to hold without discomfort but not so much that it solidifies, and not cause harm to the embryos. Once the agarose is sufficiently cool, add 0.5 mL to the embryos in the tube of Tricaine in E3 and gently pipet the solution and embryos to mix.\nUsing a 1 mm glass capillary and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plunger, pull up the embryos in the agarose solution into the capillary. Make sure to pull a total of 3-5 embryos (multiple embryos) into the capillary to increase the likelihood of having a well-positioned embryo.\n\tNOTE: Due to the round nature of the embryos at this timepoint, it is challenging to guarantee a specific orientation in the capillary. Ideally, the body of the embryo will be positioned laterally in the capillary, allowing for the greatest ease of positioning within the microscope.\nLet the agarose solidify over a period of 30-60 s at room temperature. Place the capillary in a beaker of 0.168 mg/mL Tricaine in E3 buffer until ready to image (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: The excess 2% low melting temperature agarose solution can be allowed to solidify and subsequently reheated in future experiments.\nPlace the capillary into the sample holder (Figure 1B-F) as described in step 2.5.\n2. Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 setup",
    "Switch on each component of the microscope and the computer in the following order: 1) System, 2) PC, then 3) Incubation (Figure 2A).\nPlace the 20x imaging objective and the 10x illumination objective into the microscope chamber. Match the objective settings in the Zen Software interface under the Maintain tab.\nSlide the chamber (Figure 2C) into the housing on the track (Figure 2B) with the tubing facing out. The tubing connects to the appropriate ports on the right as shown in Figure 2E.\nAttach the extension line to the syringe with the luer-lock mechanism (Figure 2D); fill it with Tricaine in E3 and place it in the holder attached to the right of the microscope35. Connect the extension attached to the syringe filled with Tricaine in E3 to the bottom right of the chamber with the luer-lock mechanism. Push the plunger to fill the chamber with the Tricaine/E3 buffer. Close the door to the chamber.\nPlace the capillary with the sample into the capillary sample holder. The capillary sample holder comprises two rubber sleeves, a metal sample holder disc, a metal stem, and a metal cap (Figure 1B). Click the metal sheath into the center of the metal disc (Figure 1C). Place the two rubber stoppers into the sheath, with the slits facing the ends of the sheath followed by the capillary. Slide the capillary through the middle of the rubber stoppers. Fasten it in place with the metal cap once the marker is at the base of the metal sheath (Figure 1D).\nPlace the capillary sample holder onto the top of the microscope, with the white marks aligning (Figure 1E,F). Close the lid.",
    "Click on the Locate Capillary button on the software interface (Figure 3A). Use the ErgoDrive control panel, a manual device that controls the capillary orientation (Figure 3E), to move the capillary and position it just above the objective (Figure 3B).\nOpen the lid, and gently push on the plunger until the section of agarose containing the embryo is hanging below the capillary bottom and is in front of the objective (Figure 3C).\nTurn off Locate Capillary and click on the Locate Sample button (Figure 3A). This switches the view from the sample chamber's webcam to the microscope objective (Figure 3D). Use this view to adjust the position of the sample more precisely. Turn off Locate Sample (Figure 3A).\nSwitch over to the Acquisition tab. Check the boxes for Z-Stack and Time Series.\nIn the Acquisition Mode parameters window, choose the Dual Side Lightsheet setting and check the boxes for Online Dual Side Fusion and Pivot Scanning.\nIn the Channels window, choose 488 channel, set the laser power to 1, and the exposure time to 7.5 ms.\nNext, click on the Continuous button to get a live view of the embryo. Use the ErgoDrive control panel to adjust the position of the embryo until the eye field is directly facing the camera. Continue adjusting the left and right lightsheets in the Channels parameters until the eye field is sufficiently in focus.",
    "Set the Z-Stack parameters using the ErgoDrive control panel to move through the Z-plane. Set the first and the last Z-Positions around 500 µm beyond the last detectable fluorescent signal. This leaves room for the eye field to remain in frame as the embryo grows throughout the time-lapse imaging session. After setting the range of the Z-Stack, click on the Optimal button to set the step size to 0.477 µm, the optimal setting.\nSet the Incubation parameters by checking the box for the Peltier Unit to keep the temperature at 28 °C. In the Time Series window, choose the frequency and time interval to acquire images. In this protocol, the parameters were set to image every 5 min, for a total of 166 intervals.\nClick on the Start Experiment button. Choose the folder to save the image set. Set the image prefix and hit Save to start the imaging.\n\tNOTE: The microscope will now run through each image set at the interval specified.\nAfter the time-lapse imaging session has been completed, send the stage to the load position, and remove the capillary sample holder. Take apart the capillary sample holder in the reverse order that it was put together and use the plunger to remove the sample and excess agarose from the capillary. Open the chamber door. Use the syringe to remove the chamber liquid from the chamber, disconnect and remove the chamber, then rinse with water and air dry.\n3. Image analysis\nOpen the arivis Vision4D software program.",
    "Click on File, then choose Import file. Select all .czi files from the time-lapse imaging session and open. The next window opens with the options on how to import the files; select Z-stacks as Frames to order the z-stacks in the order obtained. Once the files have been imported, the software saves as a single .sis file. To specify the location for the file to be saved, select the folder prior to clicking on Import.\nAfter the file is imported, arivis is now ready to render a video of the time-lapse images. Click on the 4D Viewer Cube in the bottom-left corner and the Scale Bar icon (Figure 4D-E). Click on the video icon to bring the Storyboard taskbar to the bottom of the screen (Figure 4C).\nIn the Storyboard taskbar, choose Add Keyframe Sequence (Figure 4F). Specify the duration of the video in seconds, uncheck the Create Rotation box, and check the Use Time Progression to include the specific timepoints in the video. The software displays these parameters to the right of the Storyboard taskbar for any adjustments at any time. Save the Storyboard to apply the same parameters to multiple image sets (Figure 4F).\nClick on Export Movie to save a video of the time-lapse imaging (Figure 4F). Specify the movie export settings, including the file name and location, video format (.mp4), video resolution (1,080 p), framerate (60 FPS), and data resolution (1,297 x 1,297 x 784). Add timestamps here, if desired. Once these parameters are set, choose Record (Figure 4F).\nSteps 3.4 and 3.5 can be repeated with modification to Step 3.4 to create rotation videos at specific timepoints. When adding a keyframe sequence to the storyboard, check the Create Rotation box, and uncheck Use Time Progression. Then, follow the same instructions as in step 3.5.",
    "To render a high-resolution image at any orientation at any individual time point, select the Camera icon in the 4D Viewer to obtain a high-resolution image (Figure 4C).\nTo build a pipeline for analysis, choose the Flask icon to access the Analysis panel (Figure 4B). In the Analysis panel, click on the Analysis Operations dropdown menu. As an example, the protocol demonstrates below the sequence of operations for a volume analysis pipeline. Run or undo each step of the pipeline individually to fine tune each parameter (Table 1).\nClick on the blue triangle at the top of the pipeline to allow the pipeline to run.\n\tNOTE: This will take some time depending on the speed of the computer. Once the pipeline has been optimized, the pipeline can be exported and imported to arivis with ease and applied to multiple datasets in a batch analysis.\nTo access batch analysis, click on Batch Analysis under the Analysis tab.\nAfter the pipeline runs, a window pulls up with all of the objects found. Access this manually through the Table icon (Figure 4B). At the top of this window, click on the box labeled Feature Columns to pull up a list of features that can provide information about the object of interest. For the eye field volume analysis, these features include Surface Area, Volume (Volume, VoxelCount), Intensities #1 (Mean), Attributes (Id, Type), and Time Point (First). Click on Export to export the data to a spreadsheet."
