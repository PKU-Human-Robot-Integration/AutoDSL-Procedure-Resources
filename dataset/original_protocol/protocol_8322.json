    "All methods described here have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanchang University.\n1. Assemble the Equipment and Connect the Microtome\nDesign the parameter per the requirements (Supplementary Figure 1).\nSubmit the parameter to a local factory to manufacture the acrylic boards.\nAssemble all parts in sequence: Use chloroform to combine 7 commercial acrylic boards into a tank with a section channel and water bath (Figure 1).\n\tCAUTION: Chloroform produces toxic substances when it meets light and oxygen. Assemble the apparatus in a fume hood.\nInstall the tubular electric heating element through the hole in acrylic board #1 (Figure 2A, arrowhead).\nTo install the temperature controller, create a small hole on the #2 acrylic board using an electric drill, and install the temperature detector (Figure 2A, arrow). Install a digital thermostat on the tank (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The temperature detector should be within 1 cm below the water surface.\nTo provide power access, adjust the voltage below 24 V before turning on the equipment.\nRemove the section waste tray from the microtome.\nLink the sections channel with the microtome blade holder with neutral silicone sealant (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Do not smear any neutral silicone sealant above the top of the blade so that the old blade is easily replaced.\nDry overnight to allow the chloroform and neutral silicone sealant time to solidify.\nInstall the blade to the blade holder. Pour water into the water bath (Figure 2C). The water surface should just touch the top of the blade (Figure 2D, arrow head).\n2. Paraffin Sectioning\nNOTE: Debris often accumulate on the upper or lower edges of the wax block and the water surface. This debris should be cleared regularly.\nPerform Conventional paraffin sectioning10.",
    "Clamp the paraffin-embedded specimen on a rotary microtome and place the blade in a blade holder.\nTurn the handwheel and section the specimen.\nTransfer the paraffin sectioned ribbon to the 38.5 °C warm water bath.\nPick up the sections onto the microscope slide from the water surface after unfolding.\nDry the slides in an oven at 42 °C overnight.\nImproved paraffin sectioning (Figure 3)\nTurn on the equipment.\nOpen the heater with temperature detection switch and set the targeted temperature between 38.0 °C to 40.0 °C for 1 h in advance to warm the water.\nModify the paraffin block acquired by paraffin embedding; then place the paraffin block on the microtome's cassette clamp and lock it.\n\t\tNOTE: The superior and inferior borders of the paraffin block should be modified horizontally to prevent the section ribbon from forming an arc and becoming unable to flow through the narrow sections channel.\nQuickly approach the sample by cutting thicker sections.\nAdjust to a suitable section thickness (10 µm for adult mouse brains, adult mouse kidneys, and embryo mouse brains, 4 µm for zebrafish eyes). Turn the handwheel and the sections will automatically enter the sections channel and bath.\nSection the specimen in a slow and uniform cutting stroke (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: Thethickness of the first section will be altered after the handwheel has been stopped for a few minutes. The disposable blades should be replaced when the sections have consecutive scratches.\nGuide the sections into the bath chamber to float in a line (Figure 3B, 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: If the head section adheres to the chamber wall, use a brush guide to keep it floating.",
    "Adhere sections onto microscope slides. After the sections fully unfold in the water bath, separate several sections with tweezers. Then pick them up from the water bath onto the microscope slides (Figure 3D).\n\t\tNOTE: Sections should be picked up from the posterior of the water bath, as those in the sections channel and the anterior of the water bath will not yet be fully unfolded.\nDry the slides by placing them in a 42 °C oven overnight. The slides can then be stored at room temperature indefinitely.\nUse Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining for the sake of evaluation of the improved method8.\nSubscription Required.
