    "1. Mouse Anesthesia Procedures\nAnimals are removed from their cage and placed in an anesthetic pre-operative induction chamber for gas induction at 5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen, at a flow rate of 0.5 liters per minute (vaporizer controlled).\nMice are sedated in the anesthetic induction chamber, removed from chamber and the ventral abdomen is shaved with electric clippers, or maintained within the chamber if a hair depilatory is used (1min).\nWhile still under sedation, they are weighed, the eyes are lubricated with sterile opthalmic ointment and then placed in a dorsal recumbancy on a warm water circulating heating device under general anesthesia, with a nose cone, using isoflurane and oxygen. At this point the oxygen rate is reduced to 0.2 liters per minute.\nThe abdomen is sprayed with chlorhexidine solution (chlorhexidine diacetate is rapidly bacterialcidal and persistent) and wiped with sterile gauze three times or until the surgical site is clean.\n2. Mouse Micro-surgical and Recovery Procedures\nA ventral midline incision (2cm) is made with iris scissors through the skin and abdominal wall exposing the abdomen. A sterile saline soaked 2x2in gauze is used to reflect the intestines to the animalâ€™s left side. A mouse restrainer is put in place allowing visualization of the inferior vena cava (IVC).\nAt this point, a maintenance level of 2% isoflurance and 100% oxygen rate of 0.2 liters/min is used for the remainder of the surgical procedure.\nBlunt dissection is facilitated using a sterile applicator swab and extra delicate iris half curved tissue forceps. Care must be taken\n\tin handling mouse tissues for they are extremely fragile. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, use a sterile saline soaked 4x4in gauze\n\tto reflect and exteriorize the intestines onto a sterile drape, thus allowing visualization of the IVC.",
    "All IVC back branches, from the renal veins to the iliac bifurcation, are cauterized while side branches are ligated with 7-0 non-reactive prolene sutures.\nThe IVC is separated from the aorta, just inferior to the renal veins. 7-0 prolene is used to ligate the IVC.\nThe laparotomy site is closed in a two-layer fashion. Our laboratory uses 5-0 vicryl, a synthetic suture, in a continuous pattern to close the abdominal wall. Adhesive skin glue is used to close the skin. There are no external sutures for removal.\nMice are then recovered in an individual mouse cage, observed post-operatively (45 minutes to 2 hours) under a heating lamp (minimum\n\tdistance- 24 inches away from cage), then returned to their original housing units. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents can be\n\tused if it does not interfere with study objective.  Scientific justification to withhold pain medications, veterinary, and ICUCA\n\tapproval are needed.  Our laboratory has found that Buprenorphine, 0.05-0.1 mg/kg SQ is an excellent pre- and post-operative analgesic\n\tfor mice.  In addition, Lidocaine at 4mg/kg (0.4 ml/kg of a 1% solution) can be infused in the incision site when systemic analgesics\n\tmay confound experimental results.\nSham animals from each experimental group undergo the above dissection used for the surgical approach, except the IVC or any draining branches are not ligated or cauterized.\nEuthanasia is performed in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines on Euthanasia for rodents.\nSubscription Required.
