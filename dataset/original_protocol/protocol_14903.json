    "NOTE: The protocols used have been approved by our institutional Animal Research Ethics Board at McMaster University according to Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. Experiments were performed at the McMaster University Central Animal Facility.\n1. Culturing LCRT Cells\nCulture LCRT cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Maintain cells in T-150 tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Passage cells when they form a 90% confluent monolayer (every 2-3 days, Figure 1).\nPre-warm 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1x trypsin and medium in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min prior to splitting the cells.\nAspirate medium from the flask and rinse cells with 5 ml of 1x PBS.\nAfter rinsing, aspirate PBS and incubate cells with 2 ml of 1x trypsin until cells dissociate from the flask (~2 min).\nResuspend cells in 8 ml medium (for a total of 10 ml cell suspension) and gently pipette up and down to break up clumps of cells.\nMaintain cells in a T-150 flask by seeding 1 ml cell suspension into 24 ml medium (for a total of 25 ml per T-150) and rock flask gently from side to side. Maintain cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until next split.\n2. Assessing Virus Replication and Cytotoxicity in LCRT Cells\nVirus Replication\n\tNOTE: Virus constructs expressing a fluorescent tag, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), under control of endogenous viral promoters facilitate visualization of virus infection and spread using fluorescence plate readers.",
    "Seed LCRT cells into culture plates, leaving a well for counting. Seed cells such that they will be 80-90% confluent one day later. Use a concentration of 105 cells/ml (100 µl per well) to produce the desired confluency one day later in 96-well flat bottom plates.\nThe next day, pre-warm 1x PBS, 1x trypsin, complete and serum-free medium in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min prior to starting the experiment.\nAspirate medium from the counting well and rinse cells with 5 ml of 1x PBS by rocking it over the surface of the well.\nAfter rinsing, aspirate PBS and incubate cells with 2 ml of 1x trypsin until cells dissociate from the flask (~2 min).\nResuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of complete medium to yield a cell density within the countable range using a hemocytometer. To ensure an accurate cell count, thoroughly mix the cell suspension prior to inoculating the hemocytometer by pipetting up and down.\nDetermine the volume of virus stock required for infection at the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI).\n\t\tRequired Paque Forming Units (pfu) = number of plated cells * MOI (pfu/cell)\n\t\tVolume of virus stock required = required pfu / virus stock titer (pfu/ml)\nPrepare virus inoculum in serum-free medium in tubes. Mix thoroughly by vortexing or pipetting before adding inoculum to the cells.\nInfect cells for 1 hr at 37 °C, after which apply a maintenance overlay of DMEM + 1% FBS.\nScan plates one and two days post infection (pi) to visualize GFP fluorescence.\nVirus Cytotoxicity\n\tNOTE: Perform the resazurin cytotoxicity assay under low light conditions as the compound is photosensitive. A well containing medium only should be included to correct for background fluorescence.\n\t\nPrepare a 5% (v/v) solution of resazurin in 1x PBS. Mix the solution by pipetting.",
    "Aspirate medium from cells and apply the 5% resazurin solution. Include a well containing medium only to correct for background fluorescence.\nIncubate cells for 30 min at 37 °C, after which read fluorescence using a fluorescence plate reader (excitation 530 nm, emission 595 nm).\nAnalyze data relative to uninfected controls correcting for background fluorescence.\n3. Housing and Handling\nHousing and Diet\n\t\nHouse cotton rats individually to decrease in-fighting in polycarbonate rat cages containing rodent bedding (1/8” corncob bedding), a section of PVC tubing no longer than 8 inches and nestlets as enrichment (Figure 2).\nUse a securable steel basket to sit overtop of the cage and contain rodent food and a water bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: This cage setup will allow for safe and easy capture of the animals, with the placement of the enrichment tube against the end of the cage being of the utmost importance.\nHandling\n\t\nHandle cotton rats in the morning, prior to rounds by animal facility technicians to avoid exciting them before a procedure.\nDuring all procedures, wear thick leather gloves for protection.\nAs the animals primarily remain in the enrichment tubes, use them to transfer the rats into a new cage during routine cleaning. Alternatively, open the cage slightly to allow the handler to reach their hand in, the animal can then be restrained by scruffing the skin just above the shoulders and pushing down. Practice care not to use excessive force as the animal may bite their tongue.\nBe patient and use a steady hand as the animals have a strong flight-or-fight response and will try to avoid capture by running and jumping out of the cage. Importantly, do not handle animals by the tail as degloving will occur.\nTrap the animals in their enrichments tubes over direct handling. This drastically decreases injuries and escaping.",
    "4. Capture and Anesthesia\nCapture\n\t\nWear thick leather gloves for protection during all procedures.\nUse a large clear plastic container with holes for air and a lid, an anesthetic induction chamber large enough to fit the container and a nose cone fitted to the gas output hose (Figure 3).\nWork in pairs to make the procedure more efficient and to decrease the exposure time of the animals to isoflurane, an inhalation anesthetic. Make sure one researcher is responsible for opening and replacing the steel cover on the cage and the lid of the induction chamber (handler #1) and their associate is responsible for capture of the animal in the tube and transport to the induction chamber (handler #2).\nPlace the cage on a flat surface and remove the outer lid. Lift the steel feed tray slightly and slowly maneuver the enrichment tube so it is parallel with the sides of the cage and against the back. If necessary, use an object to maneuver the enrichment tube without opening the cage to avoid agitating the animal (handler #1).\nIf the animal becomes agitated and leaves the tube, allow adequate time for the animal to relax and once again settle in the tube (handler #1).\nSlowly and deliberately lift the edge of the steel cover furthest from the enrichment tube, keeping the other end in contact with the cage. Make a space large enough for the plastic container (handler #2).\nIn one smooth, quick motion, push the plastic container overtop of the enrichment tube. Maintain contact of the container with the side of the cage, trapping the animal in the tube. Perform steps 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 as quickly as possible (handler #2).",
    "Remove the steel feed tray and give the plastic container lid to handler #2 (handler #1). Slide the plastic lid between the side of the cage and the container, being mindful of the trapped animal’s appendages in the process. Do not seal the container as this will make the next step more difficult (handler #2).\nAnesthesia\n\t\nMake sure the container remains closed and transport the animal to the induction chamber. Quickly place the animal in the chamber and remove the container lid in one fluid motion (handler #2). Open and immediately replace the induction chamber lid (handler #1).\nTurn on the flow of isoflurane to the induction chamber (5 L/min) and monitor the animal for signs of lethargy, at which point quickly slide the animal from the tube and container, removing both from the induction chamber to facilitate gas circulation.\nWhen the rat is fully anesthetized, move it to the working surface and place the nose and mouth into the nose cone (Figure 3). The rat is fully anesthetized when it is unresponsive to a forceful toe pinch.\nPlace vet petrolatum ophthalmic ointment on the animal's eyes to prevent dryness and abrasions. This is an essential step as cotton rats have large eyes that can be prone to infection if injury occurs.\nCarefully monitor and maintain a constant respiration rate and ensure that the animal’s nose remains in the nose cone fitting throughout the procedure. Adjust the flow rate of isoflurane appropriately. The amount of isoflurane required to anesthetize each animal will vary.\nPost-procedure, return the animal to its cage and ensure it regains full mobility and sternal recumbency.\n5. Preparation of LCRT Cells for Subcutaneous Tumor Formation",
    "NOTE: One T-150 flask of LCRT (90% confluency) yields approximately 2 x 107 cells. Base the number of T-150 flasks required on the total number of cells needed. Seed extra flasks to ensure the total number of cells required is obtained and to accommodate cells lost during preparation and those needed for extra injections. Keep cells on ice whenever possible to prolong cell viability.\nTo harvest cells, aspirate medium from the flask and rinse cells with 5 ml of 1x PBS.\nAspirate PBS and incubate cells with 2 ml of 1x trypsin until cells dissociate from the flask (~2 min).\nResuspend cells in 8 ml medium (for a total of 10 ml cell suspension) and gently pipette up and down to break up clumps of cells. Continue to harvest cells from additional flasks.\nPool all cell suspensions into one conical tube, approximately 4 T-150s per 50 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 160 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate medium and resuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate volume of PBS (10 ml PBS per T-150) to yield a cell density within the countable range using a hemocytometer. To ensure an accurate cell count, thoroughly mix the cell suspension prior to loading the hemocytometer by pipetting up and down.\nCalculate the total number of cells:\n\tTotal number of cells harvested = cell count (cells/ml) x resuspension volume (ml)\nDetermine the volume of cell suspension required for all injections. Make 2-3 extra doses per experiment. A total of 5 x 105 LCRT cells injected subcutaneously will form palpable tumors within 3-4 days.\n\tTotal number of cells required = 5 x 105 cells x total number of doses\n\tVolume cell suspension required (ml) = (total cells required * sum of injection volumes) / (total number of cells harvested)",
    "Pipet the required volume of cell suspension into a conical tube containing PBS and mix thoroughly. Aliquot individual injections (100 µl) into Eppendorf tubes. Maintain tubes on ice during injection procedure.\n6. Injections\nNOTE: Perform procedures with two researchers, one to perform the injections while the other monitors the animal’s respiration rate and general condition while under anesthesia. Use insulin syringes (29 G x 1/2’, 0.3 ml) for all injections and a new needle for each animal.\nSubcutaneous injections\n\t\nCapture and anesthetize the animal (section 4).\nShave the injection site using clippers. Cotton rat fur is thick and requires a sharp trimmer to get a smooth surface for injections. Clean the injection site with 70% ethanol using a cotton swab and allow it to evaporate completely before proceeding.\nLoad syringes (29 G x 1/2’, 0.3 ml) with the cells by drawing up slowly and steadily. If bubbles are evident flick the syringe with some force. Once the bubbles are at the top push the plunger until the liquid is at the top of the needle.\nLift the skin at the injection site (referred to as skin tenting) and insert the needle bevel side up. Make sure the needle moves freely under the skin to avoid injecting intramuscularly.\nExpel the contents of the syringe evenly and slowly. Withdraw the needle bevel side down.\nIntratumoral injections\n\t\nCapture and anesthetize the animal (section 4).\nClean the injection site with 70% ethanol using a cotton swab and allow it to evaporate completely before proceeding.",
    "Load syringes (29 G x 1/2’, 0.3 ml) with the virus inoculum by drawing up slowly and steadily while holding the needle in an upright position. If bubbles are evident flick the syringe with some force. Once the bubbles are at the top push then plunger until the liquid is at the top of the needle.\nInsert the needle bevel side up into the tumor and expel the contents of the syringe evenly and slowly while moving the needle in a fan-like pattern, partially withdrawing the needle before each movement to prevent laceration of the tumor. Withdraw the needle bevel side down.\n\t\tNOTE: Subcutaneous LCRT tumors are fast-growing, reaching approximately 100 mm3 in 5-7 days. Furthermore, necrotic and hemorrhagic centers often form on the surface of the tumor within several days and require careful monitoring (Figure 4).\nIntraperitoneal injections\n\t\nCapture and anesthetize the animal (section 4).\nClean the injection site with 70% ethanol using cotton swabs and allow it to evaporate completely before proceeding.\nLoad syringes (29 G x 1/2’, 0.3 ml) with the drug by drawing up slowly and steadily. If bubbles are evident flick the syringe with some force. Once the bubbles are at the top push then plunger until the liquid is at the top of the needle.\nInsert the needle into the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Pull back on the plunger to ensure that blood or feces are not aspirated, this indicates incorrect placement of the needle. If this occurs, withdraw the needle and prepare a new syringe. When the needle is correctly placed, expel contents of the syringe evenly and slowly.\n7. Tumor Excision and Necropsy\nGather and clean all tools with 70% ethanol prior to euthanasia of the animal.",
    "Euthanize the animal by the desired method, CO2 inhalation (2 L/min for 5-10 min) is recommended. Examine the animal for any abnormalities in body condition.\nPlace the animal in dorsal recumbency on a dissection board and clean the animal with 70% ethanol.\nUse tweezers to lift the skin at the lower abdomen. Cut through the skin and muscle using scissors and make a medial incision running the length of the animal (anus to chin).\nCut the rib cage by making two cuts, one laterally up the side of the ribcage and one across the sternum to expose the heart and lungs. Examine the lobes of the lung for any metastases 27,29.\nExamine all organs for abnormalities and record any changes in color, size, and consistency. If necessary, incise the organs with a scalpel to examine internal tissues. Specifically, examine the liver, kidneys, spleen and gastrointestinal tract.\nInspect the lymph nodes for metastases and enlargement 27,29.\nTo collect the tumor, make flank incisions above and below the tumor such that the skin can be pulled away from the body with tweezers. While firmly holding the skin with tweezers, use a scalpel to carefully remove the tumor by cutting between the tumor and dermis (Figure 5).\nImmediately place the tumor in a labeled container of 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nDepending on the size of the tumor, allow 1-2 days (≤ 2 mm, small) or 5-6 days (> 2 mm, large) for fixing before preparing sections for histological analysis (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required.
