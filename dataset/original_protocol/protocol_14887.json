    "NOTE: Placentae should be collected from singleton healthy pregnancies, with a preference for term elective caesarean sections. Written, informed consent should be given for the collection of their placenta. Your relevant human research ethics committee should approval all collection and use of human tissues.\n1. Isolation of Amnion Epithelial Cells\nPlace the placenta onto a sterile surface within a class II biological safety cabinet.\nUsing sterile hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), wash as much blood as possible from the placenta surface and membranes.\nWith the placenta placed with the umbilical cord facing up, mechanically separate the outer edge of the amnion and chorion membranes.\nOnce separated, manually strip the amnion membrane from the chorion membrane of the placenta, working around the edge of the membrane, towards the umbilical cord.\n\tNOTE: Be careful to remove any pieces of contaminating chorion membrane from the amnion.\nUsing sterile scissors, cut the amnion membrane approximately 2 cm from the base of the umbilical cord and place in a 500 ml sealed container containing 250 ml HBSS.\nWash thoroughly by shaking the sealed bottle containing the amnion membrane.\nRemove the amnion membrane from the collection container using sterile forceps, and place into a 15 cm Petri dish.\nCut the amnion membrane into pieces approximately 5 cm long (when held vertically with forceps), discarding bloody or torn pieces.\nPlace in a 500 ml sealed container and wash with 250 ml HBSS approximately 3-5 times or until the amnion membrane becomes translucent with no contaminating blood.\n\tNOTE: Any blood present may reduce the efficiency of the enzymatic digest solution.\nTransfer all pieces of amnion membrane into a container containing 50 ml of the enzymatic digest solution, taking care to minimize carryover of HBSS.",
    "Incubate the amnion pieces in enzymatic digest solution in a water bath or warm room at 37 °C for 15 min with gentle agitation to remove any remaining blood.\nRemove the amnion membrane pieces from the enzymatic digest solution and place in a new sterile container.\nAdd 100 ml of fresh enzymatic digest solution to the amnion membrane and incubate at 37 °C for 60 min in a water bath or warm room with gentle shaking (first digestion).\nRemove the amnion membrane pieces and place into new container taking care to allow the enzymatic digest solution to drain from each piece of membrane.\n\tNOTE: This can be achieved by dragging amnion pieces along the inside rim of the container.\nAdd 100 ml of fresh enzymatic digest solution to the amnion membrane pieces and incubate 60 min in a water bath or warm room at 37 °C with gentle shaking (second digestion).\nPass the cell suspension from Step 1.14 through a 70 µm filter and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 10 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 ml HBSS containing 1 mg/ml soybean-based enzyme inhibitor. Gently pipette repeatedly with a 1 ml pipette to obtain a single cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: At this stage cells can be left on ice until cells from the second digest are at the same stage of processing.\nRemove the amnion membrane pieces and place into new container taking care to allow the enzymatic digest solution to drain from each piece of membrane.\n\tNOTE: This can be achieved by dragging amnion pieces along the inside rim of the container.\nPass the cell suspension from Step 1.18 through a 70 µm filter and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 10 min.",
    "Remove and discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 ml HBSS containing 1 mg/ml soybean-based enzyme inhibitor. Gently pipette repeatedly with a 1 ml pipette to obtain a single cell suspension.\nPool cells from the two digests or alternatively keep cell digests separated until after cell counts.\n\tNOTE: This prevents mixing of potentially low viability cells with high viability cells.\nAdd HBSS to a final volume of 10-20 ml and perform cell counts using trypan blue to measure viability.\nConfirm the epithelial cell phenotype by flow cytometry. Make up appropriate antibody cocktails using anti-EpCAM-PE (1:2 dilution) anti-CD90-PeCy5 (1:250) and anti-CD105-APC (1:100) in HBSS.\nResuspend a subset of cells from one or both digests in the antibody cocktail at a concentration of 25 x 106 cells/ml.\nFor flow cytometry, stain 1 x 106 cells with antibody cocktails containing isotype controls (eg. IgG1 isotype control-PE + anti-CD90-PeCy5 + anti-CD105-APC). Keep ~1 x 106 cells unstained for flow cytometer set-up.\nIncubate cells in antibody cocktails at 4 °C for 60 min.\nWash cells 3x in HBSS and resuspend at 5 to 10 million cells per ml for flow cytometry.\nPerform flow cytometry and note results. The purity of the cell isolate (the percentage of EpCAM positive and CD90/CD105 negative cells) is expected to be 90-95% and <1% respectively.\nSet aside a suitable number of cells for testing for appropriate quality control or release criteria as determined by final application.\n\tNOTE: This can include disease/viral screening, or other safety or biological criteria.\nFor the remaining cells, follow the cryopreservation protocol, or alternatively place directly into culture (direct to culture step 3.6).\n2. Cryopreservation of hAECs\nDetermine cell number and viability using flow cytometry data or manual counting with trypan blue exclusion.\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend cells between 1-10 million cells per ml in animal product-free cryopreservation media.\nPipette a suitable volume of cells into O-ringed cryopreservation vials and place into a controlled rate freezing apparatus where cooling occurs at approximately 1°C/min until -80°C is achieved.\nTransfer vials into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n3. Thawing and Culture of Cyropreserved hAECs\nRemove cryopreservation vials from liquid nitrogen and place on ice.\n\tNOTE: For transfer only - proceed rapidly to next step.\nThaw the cryopreservation vials rapidly at 37 °C until only a small piece (~5 mm x 5 mm) of ice remains.\n\tNOTE: It is important that the cell solution does not warm to reduce the toxic effects of DMSO in the cryopreservation media.\nDilute cryopreservation media 10-fold with cold (~4 °C) serum-free media, added drop-wise in a suitable sized tube or container.\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend in serum-free medium, to an approximate concentration of 1 million cells per ml. Determine cell number and viability using automated or manual counting with trypan blue exclusion. Expected viability post-thaw will be 5-10% less than pre-cryopreservation viability.\nPlate cells on standard cell culture-treated plastic ware, or alternatively use Type I collagen to coat culture surfaces.\nFor Type I Collagen coating follow the protocol below\n\t\nPrepare acid soluble Type I Collagen from human placenta (15 mg collagen with 25 ml deionized water and 50 µl glacial acetic acid).\nCover beaker with Parafilm and stir moderately at 37 °C until collagen strands are dissolved.\nSterile filter collagen solution using a 0.22 µm filter.\nDilute the filtered collagen stock 1:10 with deionized water. This diluted stock is the working concentration solution for coating plastic and membrane surfaces.",
    "Collagen coat plastic, glass and membrane surfaces for 2 hr at RT at 37°C, or O/N at 2-8 °C.\nRemove excess fluid from the coated surface, and allow it to dry O/N.\nRinse with sterile tissue culture grade water or HBSS before introducing cells and medium.\nPlate hAECs at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 in serum-free medium, and allow attachment to occur for 72-96 hr.\nFollowing attachment, change media by carefully aspirating and replacing with a suitable volume of serum-free medium every 2-3 days.\nPassage cells using the protocol below\n\t\nAspirate cell culture media and wash with 1x volume of sterile HBSS\nAdd 1x volume of enzymatic digest solution and incubate for 5-15 min, or until cells are observed detaching from the cell culture surface.\nCollect enzymatic digest solution containing cells, ensuring cells are detached from the cell culture surface by repeatedly pipetting the enzymatic digest solution against the cell culture surface\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in a suitable volume of HBSS containing 1 mg/ml soybean-based enzyme inhibitor. Gently pipette repeatedly with a 1ml pipette to obtain a single cell suspension.\nAdd serum-free medium to an approximate concentration of 1 million cells/ml. Determine cell number and viability using automated or manual counting with trypan blue exclusion.\nPlate hAECs at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 in serum-free medium, and continue with standard culturing methods.\nSubscription Required.
