    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell lysis\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step, the frozen, formaldehyde-fixed pellets from target and spike-in cells are processed for cell lysis. All steps are performed on ice.\nNote: Target and spike-in cells are processed separately to allow for alternative cell lysis protocols e.g., when working with tissues instead of cell lines.\nAlternatives: If the cell lysis and sonication conditions for target and spike-in cells are identical, both might already be mixed in step 2.\nThaw target and spike-in cell pellets on ice.\nNote: For one ChIP-seq experiment targeting a transcription factor, use 40 M cells, and for histone marks, use 20 M cells. For ChIP-qPCR, 2 M cells per IP are recommended. 5% of the experimental cell number is required for spike-in per ChIP-seq experiment, and 15%–25% should be used for ChIP-qPCR. Use spike-in pellets accordingly.\nCritical: The amount of spike-in chromatin must be adjusted depending on the genome size differences between the target and spike-in species and according to the genomic coverage of the protein of interest. The above-mentioned amount of spike-in chromatin is optimized for murine cells combined with Drosophila spike-in, and for performing ChIP-Seq against widely occurring histone marks such as H3K4me1/me2/me3 or H3K27ac. See Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9].\nResuspend 20 M cells in 1 mL ice-cold FastIP buffer. Let the chromatin sit on ice for 10 min. During this time, pull the cell suspension through an insulin syringe once for mechanical cell lysis.\nSpin at 12,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant using either vacuum or a pipette. Leave the pellet untouched. Some liquid may remain.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3.",
    "Critical: Cell and tissue lysis needs to be optimized individually for each tissue or cell line. We refer to Mir at al. (Mir et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) for recommendations.\nSpike-in and sonication\nTiming: 30 min per 3 samples (depending on the Bioruptor tube holder)\nIn this step, 5% of spike-in chromatin is mixed with the target chromatin and fragmented by sonication.\nResuspend cell pellets completely in 1 mL ice-cold Shearing Buffer per 20 M cells.\nCritical: The Shearing Buffer needs to be cold but not “cloudy”. In case of SDS precipitation, warm the sample briefly and vortex it to solubilize all precipitates.\nShortly before distributing the spike-in chromatin, mix spike-in nuclei very well and add 5% of spike-in per target chromatin per 1.5 mL Bioruptor TPP tube.\nNote: For sonication in 1.5 mL Bioruptor TPP tubes, do not fill the tube with more than 550 μl of chromatin, to ensure a complete immersion of the liquid-filled tube in the water bath. If 20 M target cells are resuspended in 1 mL Shearing Buffer and 10 M spike-in cells in 500 μl Shearing Buffer, aliquot 25 μl spike-in nuclei per 1.5 mL Bioruptor tube and add 500 μl of target chromatin. Two Bioruptor tubes per 20 M target cells are required during sonication.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] 1: Different sonication conditions for target and spike-in cells or tissues.\nContinue with sonication using a Bioruptor 300 or similar model (Diagenode).\nNote: If the Bioruptor tube holder cannot fit all the tubes in one round, distribute aliquots from the same sample across different rounds to avoid sonication biases introduced by the samples being in different sonication rounds.\nUnite the sheared chromatin from each sample aliquot inside a 2 mL low binding Eppendorf tube and store on ice until proper sonication is confirmed by fast-reverse cross-linking.",
    "Fast reverse cross-linking\nTiming: 2–3 h\nHere, the appropriate size of the chromatin fragments is validated before proceeding with immunoprecipitation.\nTake 20 μL of sheared chromatin from each sample (e.g., experimental condition) and adjust the volume to 100 μL with 1×TE buffer.\nAdd 4 μL 5 M NaCl and incubate at 99°C for 15 min mixing at 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer.\nRemove samples from the thermomixer and wait for them to cool down to 18°C–24°C.\nAdd 0.5 μL RNase A∗ (10 mg/mL stock). Incubate for 15 min at 37°C and 300 rpm.\nAdd 4 μL 1 M Tris-HCl∗ pH=7.5, 2 μL 0.5 M EDTA pH=8 and 1 μL Proteinase K∗ (10 mg/mL stock). Incubate at 56°C for 1 h, while mixing at 300 rpm.\nPurify the samples with the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute the samples in 15 μL elution buffer.\nNote: Adjust the pH of the PB buffer if the color is not yellow, by adding 1 μl 3 M NaOAc pH=5.2.\nMix each sample with 4 μl of 6× colorless DNA loading dye and load onto a 0.7% agarose gel containing peqGreen or similar.\nNote: Dyes in the sample loading buffer might lower the fluorescence intensity of the sample DNA at the front of the dye and thereby affect the visibility of the fragmented chromatin.\nIf required, add additional sonication cycles and repeat the fast reverse crosslink.\nCritical: The fragment size of the chromatin should be comparable between all samples under study. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an example.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/889-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. DNA fragment size verification\nPurified DNA form macrophages treated with LPS (A) or LPS plus Dexamethasone (B) was loaded onto a 0.7% agarose gel stained with peqGreen DNA dye. Each sample contains 5% spike-in chromatin from Drosophila S2 cells\nImmunoprecipitation",
    "Timing: 2 days\nIn this step, the chromatin fraction bound by the factor of interest is purified using immunoprecipitation (IP).\nLeave the fragmented chromatin at 18°C–24°C until all SDS precipitates are dissolved. Occasionally vortex samples gently. (1–2 min)\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTake the top 90% of each sample’s supernatant (900 μl for one 20 M cell pellet) into a 15 mL conical tube. Do not touch the pellet (cell debris).\nTransfer 9 μl of supernatant from each sample to a 1.5 mL tube as an input control (1% input) and freeze at −20°C until de-crosslinking in step 41. Discard the remaining volume and the pellet.\nNote: The amount of input material might be increased to 10%, if an independent input sample is required for sequencing. Adjust the percentage input calculations accordingly.\nAdd 8.1 mL Dilution Buffer to the 15 mL conical tube containing the sample (1:10 dilution of the sheared chromatin).\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, take 10% input (9 μl) and 90 μl of chromatin per IP. Dilute the chromatin with 810 μl of dilution buffer and perform IPs in 1.5 mL low binding Eppendorf tubes. Adjust the percentage input calculations accordingly.\nAlternatives: If the epitope of interest is expressed at low levels or if the antibody affinity is low, reducing the dilution of the sheared chromatin might be advantageous. In this case, reduce the amount of SDS in the shearing buffer (see Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.13]).\nAlternatives: An additional pre-clearing step might be included, in the event that high background signal is detected (see Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.13]).\nAdd 4 μg of antibody to each 15 mL conical tube containing the diluted sample.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, use 1 μg of antibody for each IP.",
    "Note: Antibody concentrations need optimization and depend on the antibody affinity and the amount of epitope present within the sample.\nNote: Antibodies must be tested for specificity. See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.3].\nRotate tubes 12–16 h at 4°C.\nBlock Dynabeads.\nNote: The type of beads depends on the isotype and species of the ChIP antibody. For polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit, we recommend sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads (Life Technologies).\nTransfer 60 μL of well suspended Dynabeads/IP from the stock bottle into a 1.5 mL low binding tube and place the tube into a magnetic rack.\nAdd 1 mL Dilution Buffer. Remove the tube from the rack and resuspend the beads by inverting and flicking the tube.\nPlace the tube back into the magnetic rack and wait for 30 s until the liquid is cleared from the beads.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the beads.\nRepeat b-d twice more.\nAdd 1 mL Dilution Buffer supplemented with 0.5% BSA (molecular biology-grade), completely resuspend the beads by flicking the tube and incubate 12–16 h at 4°C while rotating slowly.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, use 20 μL of sepharose protein A/G beads per IP. Instead of the magnetic rack, spin the beads 30 s at 300 × g for washing. Take care to never vortex sepharose beads.\nAlternatives: Dynabeads perform equally well in ChIP-qPCR.\nThe next day, spin the 15 mL conical tubes containing the IP for 20 min at 3,600 × g at 4°C.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, spin IPs at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C (1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes).\nDuring the centrifugation, wash the blocked beads 3 times in Dilution Buffer.\nPlace the Dynabeads in the magnetic rack. Wait 30 s until all beads are collected and the liquid is cleared.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully without losing beads.",
    "Add 1 mL Dilution Buffer, remove the tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the beads by flicking the tube.\nPlace the Dynabeads inside the magnetic rack. Wait 30 s until all the beads are collected and the liquid cleared, and aspirate the supernatant carefully.\nRepeat c-d twice more.\nResuspend beads in 65 μl Dilution buffer/IP.\nNote: For sepharose beads, spin the beads 30 s at 300 × g and 4°C instead of using the magnetic rack.\nAliquot 15 μL Dynabeads into fresh 2 mL low binding Eppendorf tubes (4 tubes for one 20 M cell pellet).\nAfter centrifugation, take the top 90% (approx. 8 mL) of chromatin. On ice, aliquot 2 mL per 2 mL low binding Eppendorf tube containing Dynabeads beads (from step 27).\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, transfer the top 90% of the chromatin (800 μl) into a new 1.5 mL low binding tube that contains 20 μL of sepharose beads in Dilution Buffer.\nIncubate for 6 h at 4°C while slowly rotating the tubes.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, incubate for 3 h at 4°C while rotating. On ice, wash the beads with the immobilized chromatin of interest with FAST IP Buffer. Place magnetic racks on ice.\nPlace the 2 mL Eppendorf tubes inside the magnetic rack. Wait for 30 s until the liquid is cleared.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL ice-cold Fast IP buffer.\nTake the tubes from the magnetic rack and mix by inverting and flicking the tubes. Let the samples sit on ice for 2 min.\nRepeat a-c four more times.\nNote: For sepharose beads, spin beads 30 s at 300 × g and 4°C instead of using the magnetic rack.\nDuring the washes, prepare the Bead Elution Buffer.\nNote: Steps 32 and 33 are only required for ChIP-seq samples",
    "After the fifth wash, add 100 μL ice-cold 1× TE buffer to each tube. Unite the beads from the four 2 mL tubes (for one 20 M cell pellet) by removing the tubes from the magnetic rack and resuspending the beads with the P200. Collect all beads from one sample in one tube. Afterward, one tube with 400 μl bead suspension per sample remains.\nAdd another 50 μL ice-cold 1× TE buffer to each one of the empty tubes, resuspend any remaining beads and unite with the beads from step 32 (650 μl beads in 1×TE).\nPlace the tubes into the magnetic rack, wait 1 min until the solution is cleared, and carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette. Be careful, the beads will only be loosely attached in TE buffer.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, the steps 32 and 33 are not required, since every tube is a separate IP.\nAdd 1 mL 1× ice-cold TE buffer, resuspend the beads by inversion and by flicking the tubes, and place them back into the magnetic rack. Wait 1 min until the solution is cleared.\nCarefully pipet the TE buffer off using a pipette. Shortly spin the beads and transfer the tube back to the magnetic rack. Remove any remaining supernatant.\nNote: For sepharose beads, spin beads 30 s at 300 × g and 18°C–24°C instead of using the magnetic rack.\nAdd 100 μL Bead Elution Buffer per tube, vortex and incubate 15 min at 18°C–24°C and 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, add 50 μL Bead Elution Buffer to each IP.\nPlace the tubes into the magnetic rack and collect the supernatant into fresh 1.5 mL low binding Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Add another 100 μL Bead Elution Buffer to the beads, vortex and incubate again inside the thermomixer for 15 min at 18°C–24°C and 1,000 rpm.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, add 50 μL bead elution buffer and spin beads 30 s at 300 × g and 18°C–24°C instead of using the magnetic rack.\nShortly spin the tubes in a bench top centrifuge. Place the tubes into the magnetic rack and collect the supernatant into the 1.5 mL tubes from step 38. The final volume of the eluted chromatin is 200 μL.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, the final volume should be 100 μL.\nThaw the input sample and adjust the volume of the input sample to 200 μL using 1× TE buffer.\nAdd 8 μL of 5 M NaCl to the 200 μL eluted chromatin and input, vortex and heat at 65°C for 12–16 h. Do not shake.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, adjust the volume of the input sample to 100 μL and add 4 μL of 5 M NaCl.\nDNA purification\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, the chromatin is de-crosslinked and the DNA is purified.\nAdd 1 μL of RNase A∗ (10 mg/mL stock) to the eluted DNA and input samples.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C and 300 rpm in a thermomixer.\nAdd 4 μL 0.5 M EDTA pH=8, 8 μL 1 M Tris-HCl∗ pH=7.5 and 1 μL Proteinase K∗ (10 mg/mL stock).\nIncubate in a thermomixer for 2 h at 56°C and 300 rpm.\nPurify the de-crosslinked chromatin using the MinElute PCR purification kit from QIAGEN.\nAdd 1,110 μL PB buffer and 50 μL 3M NaOAc pH=5.2. The color of the pH indicator should be yellow.\nNote: For ChIP-qPCR, add 500 μL PB buffer and 20 μL 3M NaOAc pH 5.2.",
    "Mix with a pipette and load 700 μl de-crosslinked chromatin in PB buffer onto the spin column and spin at 20,000 × g for 30 s at 18°C–24°C.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nRepeat step b with the remaining chromatin.\nWash with 750 μL PE buffer (containing EtOH∗) to the spin column.\nSpin at 20,000 × g for 30 s and discard the flow- through.\nSpin the empty column at 20,000 × g for 1 min to remove residual PE buffer.\nAdd 16 μL EB buffer and spin at 20,000 × g for 1 min.\nPause point: For ChIP-seq, the purified ChIP DNA might be stored at −20°C until libraries can be prepared. Before freezing the samples, take a 2 μl aliquot for qPCR (see steps 48–55)) and another 1–2 μl aliquot to measure the DNA concentration with Qubit. Avoid freeze and thaw cycles.\nCritical: Purified DNA for ChIP-qPCR is very unstable due to its low concentration. ChIP samples with lowly concentrated DNA tend to lose a higher fraction of DNA to adsorption by the tube walls and subsequent denaturation of smaller fragments (Gaillard, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Zhong et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Low-concentrated ChIP DNA (as from ChIP-qPCR) should be processed immediately. The maximal storage time is 12–16 h at −20°C.\nQuantitative PCR (qPCR)\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, the enrichment is quantified. It serves as a quality control of ChIP samples designated for sequencing.\nThaw SYBR Green PCR master mix and prepare 10-μM dilutions of the primers for at least one negative and positive locus.\nTake 2 μl from the eluted ChIP or input DNA, and add 118 μl of nuclease-free water (1:60 dilution). This is sufficient for 8 qPCRs in a 384-well format when performing triplicates.",
    "Note: For ChIP-qPCR experiments, only dilute the eluted DNA (ChIP or input) 1:15 at the highest, depending on how many qPCRs will be performed. Further dilution will make the spike-ins undetectable.\nCreate five standards by making serial dilutions of the input samples, as indicated in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_889_17.csv\nFurther dilute the input 1:5.\nAdd 4.5 μl of each standard, water (as non-template control), input and ChIP samples to 3 of the 384 wells each (triplicates).\nPrepare the qPCR master mix based on the following table. Replace n by the number of ChIP samples (including all input samples).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_889_18.csv\nRun the following protocol on the qPCR machine:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_889_19.csv\nOptional: Run a melt curve analysis.\nConfirm that the reaction efficiency is between 90%–110% by analyzing the standard curve.\nQuality control\nBefore proceeding to library preparation, the following two quality control standards must be met.\nSpecific enrichment for the factor of interest, as determined by ChIP-qPCR.\nTest the enriched chromatin for a positive locus occupied by the factor of interest and for a negative locus that should not be bound by the factor of interest (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: The negative control is of utmost importance, as ChIP-seq experiments are not usually compared to IgG controls to test whether an antibody is specific.\nThe majority of the input chromatin should be fragmented between 200 and 1500 bp as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nLibrary preparation\nTiming: 2 days for 1 to 20 libraries\nTiming: 3 h until next pause point per five libraries for steps 6 6 and 6 7\nTiming: approx. 3–16 h for step 6 8\nTiming: 2 h depending on the cycle number for steps 69 and 7 0\nTiming: 3 h for 1–10 libraries for step 7 1",

    "Note: The adapter identifies each sample. Accordingly, use different adapters for each sample and record the adapters used, to enable computational demultiplexing after sequencing. An adapter contains the primer binding sequence for the universal amplification primers in step 69, and a unique barcode (index) on one (single index) or both strands (dual index), which are required for the identification of each sample (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Adapters might be ordered from any oligonucleotide vendor.\nWe are using single index adapters here. However, dual indices are recommended for sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 machines to avoid index hopping.\nPost-ligation Clean-up (0.8× AMPure XP bead clean-up)\nCritical: AMPure XP beads should be equilibrated to 18°C–24°C.\nNote: Timing during AMPure XP bead clean-up is important, we therefore recommend to process at most 10 libraries at the same time. Multiple rounds of 10 purifications are possible.\nMix AMPure XP beads well and add 88 μl per 110 μl ligation reaction using a pipette. Mix reaction by pipetting up and down for 10×.\nIncubate 5 min at 18°C–24°C.\nPlace PCR tubes in magnetic tube holder (8-stripe) and wait until the liquid is clear (1–3 min).\nRemove 175 μl of the supernatant with a pipette and discard it.\nCritical: Do not disturb the beads.\nAdd 200 μl of freshly prepared 80% EtOH∗ without disturbing the beads. Incubate 1 min.\nRemove all EtOH∗ with a pipet without disturbing the beads.\nDry beads at 18°C–24°C (2–5 min).\nCritical: Check each tube individually. Do not overdry beads. Overdried beads will show cracks.\nAdd 25 μl Library Elution Buffer to the beads, take the PCR tubes from the magnetic rack and pipet up and down for 10× times. Incubate 2 min at 18°C–24°C.\nPlace PCR tubes into the magnetic tube holder and wait until the liquid is cleared (1–5 min).",
    "Transfer 22 μl of the supernatant to a fresh PCR tube.\nPause point: Adapter-ligated DNA can be stored at 4°C for one week or at −20°C for one month.\nSize Selection with the Pippin Prep\nAlternatives: Double-sided size selection with AMPure XP beads might be performed, but does not yield size ranges as accurately as the Pippin Prep. For a target range of 200–660 bp, 0.5× AMPure XP beads are added to the sample in the first step. Larger fragments are bound to the beads, while the desired fragments remain in the supernatant. New beads are added to the supernatant according to the following formula, using a left-sided ratio of 0.8×:\n  V  (  S P R I b e a d s  )  = V  (  s a m p l e  )  ×  (  l e f t  s i d e d  r a t i o − r i g t h  s i d e d  r a t i o  )  = V  (  s a m p l e  )   × 0.3  \nThe desired fragments are bound by the beads and small fragments are discarded together with the supernatant. The procedure is the same as described in point 65 after adjusting for the AMPure XP bead ratio.\nNote: With one Pippin Gel Cassette, size selection of up to five libraries can be performed. For more libraries, consecutive runs of Size Selection might be performed.\nTurn the Pippin Prep on and create the following protocol:\nSelect the correct cassette from the drop-down menu: “2% Marker E”\nSelect Range (turns orange).\nEnter 200 into the “BP Start” and 600 in the “BP End” field.\nEnter the sample ID.\nPress “Use Internal Standards”, which will auto-fill the Reference Lane box.\n“End Run when Elution is Completed”",

Dislodge them by slightly tapping against the cassette.\nNote: If an air bubble is visible between the plastic and the agarose, do not use this well.\nPlace the cassette into the optical nest of the Pippin Prep and remove the adhesive strips.\nRefill buffer wells with less than 50% buffer.\nRemove all buffer (approx. 50 μl) from the elution wells and replace with 40 μl fresh Electrophoresis Buffer.\nNote: Carefully place the pipet tip at the bottom of the elution well for refill and move upwards with the buffer level to avoid the introduction of air bubbles.\nSeal elution wells with the provided adhesive tape strips.\nFill sample wells with Electrophoresis Buffer (approx. 70 μl in total).\nRun the Continuity test by pressing “TEST”.",
    "Note: If a separation lane fails the continuity test, check the sample well’s buffer level. If the buffer is sufficient but the lane still fails, do not use this lane.

    "Note: Flow cells and pooling strategy need to be adapted according to the number of libraries, the sequencer available and the desired sequencing depth. We recommend contacting the sequencing facility or provider before pooling. The number of samples to pool in one lane is determined by the total number of reads given by a flow cell (e.g., 800 M reads for one lane on the SP flow cell for the NovaSeq 6000) and the desired sequencing depth. Sequencing depth recommendations for the mouse genome are as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_889_29.csv"
