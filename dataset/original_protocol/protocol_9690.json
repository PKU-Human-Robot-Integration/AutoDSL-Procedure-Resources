    "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Project ID: 1046). Primary astrocytes were prepared from 1-3 day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups in compliance with UNL's IACUC protocol 1046 and according to protocol with slight modifications7,11.\n1. Preparations\nObtain a master pattern of desired geometry before beginning this protocol.\n\tNOTE: Commercially available silicon wafers prepared using standard photolithography techniques are used in this protocol. The recommended starting pattern is 100-200 µm lines.\nPrepare buffers and media.\n\t\nPrepare poly(diallylmethylammonium chloride) (PDAC) and sulfonated poly(sterene) (SPS) polymer solutions to coat plates.\n\t\t\nPDAC coating solution is 0.3 wt. % PDAC and 0.1 M NaCl in ddH2O.\nSPS coating solution is 30 µM SPS and 0.1 M NaCl in ddH2O.\n\t\t\tNOTE: 1 L of PDAC coating solution and 1 L of SPS coating solution is sufficient to coat six 6-well plates. Solutions can be reused 2-5 times. Replace the solutions when they become cloudy.\nPrepare standard cell culture media, if needed.\n\t\t\nTypical astrocyte and GBM media are, respectively, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM).\nObtain, prepare, or thaw cells.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is described for primary rat astrocytes isolated from 1-3 day neonatal rats and U87MG or A172-MG glioma cells. This protocol can be expanded to similar cell lines after confirmation of differential attachment of cell lines of interest on polymer surfaces.",
    "Due to cell loss during staining, use a minimum of 200,000 GBM cells on Day 0 and 400,000 live primary rat astrocytes on Day 1 per well in a 6-well plate. Adjust cell numbers if using a different size well or plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: Primary astrocytes from passages 2-4 prepared as described by Wilson and coworkers12 are recommended for this protocol. Glioma cells were commercially obtained (see Table of Materials).\n2. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp molding\nIn a disposable container, weigh 12 parts (by weight) of PDMS pre-polymer and 1 part (by weight) of curing agent. Mix vigorously for 2-4 min until the entire mixture is filled with bubbles.\n\tNOTE: 26 g of the mixture is sufficient for one 100 mm Petri dish.\nPlace fluorosilane into the fluorosilane desiccator. Place the disposable container with the polymer mixture into the desiccator to degas for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: This allows bubbles to rise out of the mixture. More time may be needed if large bubbles are still present after 20 min.\nPlace the pre-patterned structure master into a Petri dish. Pour the PDMS mixture slowly into the Petri dish over the pre-patterned structure master, ensuring to completely cover the master. The optimal depth of the PDMS layer is about 2-3 mm thick.\n\tNOTE: Avoid creating air bubbles by slowly pouring the mixture. Ensure that the silicone master is lying flat in the Petri dish.\nKeep the Petri dish in the fluorosilane desiccator until all the bubbles are removed. Cure the Petri dish in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h. If 60 °C is not available, cure the Petri dish at 37 °C overnight.\nUsing a sharp scalpel, evenly and gently cut around the master.",
    "CAUTION: Use caution when using a scalpel. Never leave the exposed blade unattended. Scalpels are sharp. Use appropriate safety precautions to prevent injury.\nRemove the stamp using a tweezer and place it on a cutting surface such as a cutting board. Using a scalpel, cut the stamps into a size small enough to fit into 6-well plates (approximately 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm).\n3. Building Polyelectrolyte Multilayers (PEMs)\nNOTE: This protocol describes plasma coating with an attached pressurized oxygen tank and gas mixing accessory (see Table of Materials). Any method of evenly plasma-cleaning the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surface is suitable. Time and intensity may need to be optimized by the user when using a different plasma cleaning method.\nPlasma-clean a 6-well plate for 7 min.\n\t\nBleed the chamber by turning the three-way valve on the front of the door to the right until the hiss from the air release can be heard. Turn the three-way valve back to the vertical position once the pressure reading is above 1800 mTorr.\nOpen the door and put the 6-well plate in the chamber. Close the door and turn on the vacuum pump. Evacuate the chamber until the pressure is stable around 100 mTorr.\n\t\tNOTE: While the chamber is evacuating, confirm that the oxygen tank is open, and the output pressure of the oxygen is 10 psi.\nOpen the three-way valve to the left to align the line with the oxygen input hose. Allow the oxygen gas to bleed into the chamber until the pressure stabilizes between 400 and 450 mTorr.\n\t\tNOTE: Confirm that the input pressure on the flow meter is 10 mm and adjust if needed.\nTurn on the RF power. Wait for the plasma to form (~15 s), and then start the timer for 7 min.",
    "After 7 min, turn off the RF power and turn the three-way valve back to its vertical position. Allow the chamber to evacuate to 150 mTorr.\nTurn off the vacuum pump and wait for the pressure to rise to 1500 mTorr. Vent the chamber by turning the three-way valve to the right until the hiss from the air release can be heard. When the pressure reading is above 1800 mTorr, turn the three-way valve back to its vertical position, open the door and retrieve the sample.\nPlace plasma coated plates in room temperature baths as follows: PDAC for 20 min, DI water for 5 min, DI water for 5 min, SPS for 20 min, DI water for 5 min, and DI water for 5 min. Ensure that the entire plate surface is submerged.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, an automated slide stainer may be used to reduce active time. Use gentle agitation, if available.\nRepeat the previous step a total of 10 times. Allow the plates to air dry.\n\t​NOTE: The dried plates can be stored at room temperature for up to several weeks before use.\n4. PEM patterning via micromolding in capillaries\nWash the PDMS stamps with gentle lab soap followed by DI water. Dry the stamps using an air compressor and place them on a flat, movable surface such as an unused 6-well plate lid.\n\tOPTIONAL: The stamps can also be air-dried. The stamps must be covered and protected from dust while drying.\nPlasma coat the stamps, as described in step 3, for 1 min. Promptly remove the stamps from the plasma cleaner and place them face down on the prepared 6-well plates.",
    "Pipette 10 µL of PDAC solution along the bottom edge of the stamp, steadily dispensing the polymer along the length of the stamp. Ensure to add the polymer to the side of the stamp with openings from the line patterns to allow capillary action to take place.\nPlace a 350 g weight on top of each stamp for 20 s to help enforce the pattern. Allow the stamps to rest on the plates for 20 min.\nDip the plate into DI water and peel off the stamps in the direction of the line patterns. Wash the plate twice for 5 min each in DI water.\nWash the stamps with soap and DI water and dry with an air compressor. Allow the plate to air dry.\nIf ready for cell culture, sterilize the plates under UV light in a Class II biosafety hood for a minimum of 8 h immediately prior to use. The minimum recommended total UV-C dose is 400 mJ/cm2 at 265 nm. If visualizing patterns, skip the UV sterilization step, and perform step 5. If ready for cell culture, perform step 6 after UV sterilization.\n5. Visualizing stamped patterns with carboxyfluorescein (CFSE)\nNOTE: Perform this procedure to visualize stamped patterns or skip this step and instead prepare patterns for cell culture. Once the patterns are stained, they cannot be used for cell culture. Once sufficient confidence in stamping is gained, the patterns can be used for cell culture. Carboxyfluorescein is light-sensitive. Stain and transport in the dark.\nPlace dried, stamped patterns in CFSE pattern staining solution (0.1 µM CFSE in 0.1 M NaOH) for 60-90 min. Wash stamped patterns for 5 min in DI H2O two times.",
    "NOTE: If using glass slides, place the entire slide into a 50 mL tube containing the staining solution. If using well plates, add enough staining solution to cover the entire pattern.\nVisualize patterns using an appropriate fluorescence microscope.\n\t\nTurn on the fluorescent bulb to allow it to warm up for 10 min. Since patterns are stained with CFSE, use the interference blue filter (IB) to visualize the green patterns. View the patterns and take photos.\n6. Staining and seeding glioblastoma cells with carboxyfluorescein\nNOTE: All cell culture work should be performed in a suitable Class II biosafety cabinet.\nDetach the cells from the culture surface with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of cell culture media without serum (DMEM and 1% penicillin-streptomycin), centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS and transfer to sterile 1.5 mL tube. Add 10 µL of 10 µg/mL CFSE and immediately mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min and transfer into a 15 mL sterile tube.\nAdd a minimum of 1 mL of cell culture medium (see step 1.2.2.1) to quench the CFSE dye reaction. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of cell culture medium and transfer to a fresh 15 mL sterile tube.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of cell culture medium.\nRepeat the previous wash step twice.",
    "Seed the stained glioma cells (100 cells/mm2 or 100,000 cells/well) in the patterned 6-well tissue culture plate from step 4 with astrocyte culture media. Culture the cells in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h before adding stained astrocytes in step 7.\n7. Staining and seeding primary astrocytes with PKH26\nNOTE: All of the cell culture work should be performed in a suitable Class II biosafety cabinet.\nDetach the cells from the culture surface with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of cell culture media without serum (DMEM and 1% penicillin-streptomycin), centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant.\nPrepare a 2x cell suspension by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of room-temperature Diluent C from the PKH26 kit.\nPrepare a 2x dye solution (4 x 10-6 M) by adding 2 µL of PKH26 to 0.5 mL of Diluent C in a sterile 1.5 mL tube. Prepare the dye solution right before use.\nAdd 2x cell suspension to 2x dye solution and immediately mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate the cell suspension for 1-5 min.\n\tNOTE: The staining happens quickly, and Diluent C is harmful to cells. Longer incubation does not mean better dyeing.\nQuench the staining by adding a minimum 5x volume of the cell culture medium and incubating for 1 min to bind the excess dye.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and carefully remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of cell culture media and transfer to a new sterile 15 mL tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant and resuspend in 5 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant and resuspend in 5 mL of cell culture media.\nRepeat steps 7.9 and 7.10 for a total of three washes.\nSeed the stained astrocytes (200 cells/mm2 or 200,000 cells/well) with astrocyte media (see step 1.2.2.1) in the patterned 6-well tissue culture plate pre-seeded with glioma cells from step 6. Culture the cells in 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for the time experiments are carried out.\n8. Fluorescence imaging of patterned mono-culture and co-culture\nTurn on the fluorescent bulb to allow it to warm up for 10 min.\nRemove the cell culture from the incubator and set it on the stage of an inverted microscope capable of fluorescence imaging.\nInsert or attach the appropriate filter. If the cells being imaged are stained with CFSE, use the interference blue filter (IB) to visualize the green cells. If the cells being imaged are stained with PKH26, use a Rhodamine filter to visualize the red cells.\nView the specimen and take photos.\n\tNOTE: The cells can now be separated using flow cytometry to analyze the biological effects of contact-mediated communication.\nSubscription Required.
