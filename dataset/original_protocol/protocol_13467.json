    "This study was approved by the ethics committee at Okayama Rosai Hospital (No. 201-3).\n1. Patient examination\nHistory taking\n\t\nEvaluate a patient with a suspected herniated disc or stenosis by taking their history. Usually, the patient presents with a history of prodromal low back pain. The patient may correlate their symptoms with an episode of trauma.\nAsk the patient to describe the radiating leg pain, its location, and aggravating and relieving activities.\nPhysical examination\n\t\nTo determine the level of the affected nerve, look for signs of motor weakness or loss of sensation in the leg. Check the lumbar range of motion, the straight leg raise (SLR) test, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness.\nPerform the Kemp test to check the location of the herniated discs. If the Kemp test yields a positive result, local pain suggests a facet pathology, while radiating pain into the leg is more suggestive of nerve root irritation, which frequently accompanies foraminal disc herniation or stenosis.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually, the SLR test is negative for patients with lumbar canal stenosis and positive for patients with lumbar disc herniation.\n2. Evaluation of images\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\t\nPerform an MRI. This is the most accurate diagnostic modality for assessing lumbar disc herniation, showing the site of herniation and the nerve roots affected. The L5 nerve root can be compressed by fibrocartilage at the pars interarticularis of L5.\nComputed tomography (CT)\n\t\nUse CT to check whether the herniated disc is calcified and to rule out nerve compression by any osteophyte.\nCT-MRI fusion imaging\n\t\nUse the fusion image to evaluate the feasibility of performing OLIF51. The vascular window, made by the common iliac vessels at the L5-S1 disc level, is clearly visualized. A vascular window of less than 20 mm makes OLIF technically difficult (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig01.jpg",

Patient positioning and neuromonitoring\nPatient positioning\n\t\nPlace the patient in a right lateral decubitus position on a carbon table. Use an O-arm to obtain 3D images of the lumbar spine of the patient (Figure 2).\nTo protect the neurovascular structures, place an axillary roll underneath the patient's right axilla.\nFlex the hip and knee to 20° to relax the psoas muscle and the lumbar nerve. Secure the patient to the table with tape.\nInsert a percutaneous reference pin into the left sacroiliac joint.\nObtain 3D images of the O-arm and transmit them to the navigation system.\nNeuromonitoring\n\t\nWhenever possible, neuromonitor the patient to prevent neurological complications (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Patient positioning.

Intraoperative CT and spinal navigation\nIntraoperative CT\n\t\nPlace a navigation reference frame (RF) percutaneously into the contralateral sacroiliac joint or L5 spinous process, and obtain intraoperative CT images (Figure 4).\nNavigation\n\t\nThe navigation system is necessary for this technique. Transmit the CT 3D reconstructed images to the navigation system (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: O-arm. One O-arm scan is just 23 s.

Navigated instrument registration",
    "Register every navigated instrument and perform an accuracy check.\n6. Incision and muscle dissection\nSkin incision\n\t\nMark the skin incision using a navigated pointer. Direct the entry point to the center and parallel to the L5-S1 disc space.\nMake a 4 cm long oblique incision on the skin, 4 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine and parallel to the pelvis (Figure 6).\nMuscle dissection\n\t\nDivide the abdominal muscles and dissect along the line of the skin incision. A monopolar cautery is contraindicated due to the risk of injury to the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves.\nWith a retroperitoneal approach, use both index fingers to dissect the retroperitoneal space, following the internal abdominal wall posteriorly down to the psoas muscle, which can then be visualized (Figure 7).\n\t\tCAUTION: If the iliohypogastric nerve is injured, abdominal herniation may occur.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Skin incision.

Disc preparation and trialing\nDisc preparation\n\t\nAfter exposing the promontorium, identify the left common iliac vessels and retract laterally (upward) using a special self-retaining retractor under illumination. Take great care to preserve the left ureter. The L5/S1 intervertebral disc is exposed (Figure 8).\nRetract both common iliac vessels and the bifurcation with three self-retaining retractors. A blunt dissection of the adventitial layers on the L5/S1 disc is necessary to not injure the sympathetic chain. Retrograde ejaculation may occur in male patients if the sympathetic chain is injured.",
    "After the center of the disc is marked with a navigated pointer, incise the annulus with a knife, and perform a discectomy using Kerrison rongeurs, pituitary forceps, a navigated Cobb elevator, a navigated shaver (Figure 10), a navigated combo tool (periosteum elevator), and a navigated curved curette (Figure 11).\nUse the navigated curved curette to remove the posterior part of the disc.\n\t\tNOTE: Since all the instruments are navigated, the use of an intraoperative C-arm is not required.\nTrialing\n\t\nAfter disc preparation, sequentially distract the disc space using navigated trials. Determine the size of the cage on a preoperative lateral radiogram. For Asian patients, a disc height of 10-14 mm and an angulation of 12°-18° is advisable.\nAt this step, perform intraoperative radiography to check the implant position and the size of the cage. If the cage protrudes beyond the disc space, choose another adequately sized cage (Figure 12).\n\t\tCAUTION: The surgeon should check the accuracy of the navigation system before using the navigation instruments, as the reference frame may sometimes be accidentally altered. Unlike the C-arm, the disc space in the navigation image does not open on insertion of a trial with an adequate height.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig08.jpg\nFigure 8: Approach to the promontorium.

Cage placement and screwing\nCage placement\n\t\nInsert a mixture of autogenous bone and demineralized bone material into the cage hole. Confirm the angle of insertion for the cage with a navigation pointer to insert the OLIF51 cage accurately.\nUse a mallet to gently insert the OLIF51 cage. After the implant is positioned, take anteroposterior and lateral radiographs to confirm the position of the cage (Figure 13A).\nScrewing\n\t\nAfter cage insertion, insert one or two supplemental screws to prevent cage back-out (Figure 13B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig13.jpg\nFigure 13: Cage placement and screwing.

Simultaneous percutaneous pedicle screw (PPS) fixation\nHave another surgeon insert the PPSs in the same lateral decubitus position of the patient under navigation guidance.\nMake the screw hole with a navigated high-speed burr, navigated pedicle probe, and navigated tap. Measure the length and diameter of the screws by navigation.\nInsert the S1 PPS in a transdiscal manner to enhance the screw pullout strength.\nTake radiograms after the insertion of the screws (Figure 14).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63572/63572fig14.jpg",

Postoperative procedure\nAmbulate the patient 1 day after the surgery. The use of a soft brace is recommended for 3 months. Follow-up at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the surgery to assess for solid bony fusion.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
