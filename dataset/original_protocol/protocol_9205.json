    "1. Tools \nMicroscope, Nikon\nStereo Investigator, MBF Bioscience – MicroBrightField, Inc.\n2. Preparation\nBefore working on any morphometric analysis, each retina sample is sectioned at 4 micron thickness and undergoes the H&E staining.\nThe retina section is divided into 4 regions – upper peripheral region, the upper central region, the lower peripheral region, and  the lower central region.\nAfter defining the regions, an image of each region is acquired at 10x40 magnifications under the bright beam microscope of Nikon.\nNow, we are ready to analyze morphometry of the retina.\n3. Measuring INL thickness\nFour measurements of INL thickness in each region were measured. Four lines will be drawn perpendicularly from the contour baseline to the outer border of the INL.\nOpen the software called Stereo Investigator and choose the 40x Lens from the Main Toolbar.\nSelect \"Image Open\" under the tab \"File\". Choose an image of a desired retinal region that you would like to analyze.\nChoose the type of contour line from the Dropdown list box of the Main Toolbar and press the “Auto Move” button.\nRight click in the tracing window, and select \"Simple Click Tracing\".\nDraw the contour line along the inner border of the INL.\nWhen the drawing is done, right click in the tracing window and choose \"End Open Contour\".\nSelect a marker at the marker toolbar and add markers at the junction points.\nAfter adding all the markers, deselect the marker icon at the Marker Toolbar.\nPosition a cursor at the centre of one of the markers.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig1.jpg\nSelect \"Quick Measure Angle\" under the tab \"Tools\".\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig2.jpg\nRight click in the tracing window and deselect the \"Continuous\" option.    \nMeasure an angle by first clicking at the center of a marker, which is adjacent to the marker selected for an end of the line segment.",
    "imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig3.jpg\nThen, move the mouse to the center of the concerned marker and click again.\n Extend the rubber band line to the outer border of the INL.    \nAdjust the angle until 90° is reached.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig4.jpg\nLeft click at the desired position. A dialog box showing an angle measurement will pop up right after the click.    \nPress the \"Enter\" key while holding the mouse still.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig5.jpg\n Left click the tracing window so that a line is drawn from one end to the new selected end.\n Right click in the tracing window and choose \"End Open Contour\".   \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3377/3377fig6.jpg\n Draw the other lines at different positions in exactly the same way as described before.    \nAfter drawing all the lines, select the Editing mode and rename the 4 line segments accordingly.    \n Four measurements can be obtained by pressing \"Contour Measurement\" button.    \nSelect these 4 measurements and paste them to a spreadsheet by clicking \"Copy to Clipboard\".    \nSelect \"Save As\" under the tab \"File\". The tracing data can be saved as a data file. \n4. Quantifying the number of RGCs\nSelect \"Image Open\" under the tab \"File\". Choose an image of a desired retinal region that you would like to analyze.    \nChoose the type of contour line from the Dropdown list box of the Main Toolbar. \n Draw a contour line along the border of nerve fiber layer (NFL).    \nEnd the tracing with the option \"End Open Contour\".    \nAt each end, add one marker at the tip of the line and another at the position near the tip.    \nDeselect the marker icon at the marker toolbar. \nPosition a cursor at the centre of the markers at the tip.    \nSelect \"Quick Measure Angle\" under the tab “Tools\".    \nRight click in the tracing window and deselect the \"Continuous\" option.",
    "Adjust the rubber band lines and measure an angle of 90°.    \nPress the \"Enter\" key after a dialog box is popped up.    \nLeft click the tracing window so that a new line can be perpendicularly extended from the tip.    \nDraw another new line in the exactly the same way at another end. \nTwo boundaries are created within which the number of RGCs is counted.    \nChoose one boundary as an exclusion line which the cell touches is not counted.    \nSelect one type of marker and attach one to each live cell.    \nSelect another type of marker for the dead cells.    \n The number of each type of markers placed will be displayed alongside the marker icon accordingly at the marker toolbar.    \n Select the Editing mode and pick up the contour baseline. Right click in the tracing window and rename the line.    \n The length of the contour baseline can be obtained by pressing \"Contour Measurement\" button.    \n The number of the cells can then be expressed per mm of the length.    \n Select \"Save As\" under the tab \"File\". The tracing and the marker data can be saved as a data file. \n 5. Measuring the cell size of a RGC cell\nSelect \"Image Open\" under the tab \"File\". Choose an image of a desired retinal region that you would like to analyze.    \nZoom in a live cell and choose the type of contour line from the Dropdown list box of the Main Toolbar.    \nDraw a contour line along the circumference of the cell.    \nAt about the end, right click the tracing window and select \"End close contour\".    \nThe area of the cell will be displayed under the item of Area in the Contour Measurement dialog box. \nSubscription Required.
