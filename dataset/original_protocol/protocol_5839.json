    "Genomic DNA isolationHarvest 0.1-0.2 g (one mature leaf from Arabidopsis, ~20 mm in length excluding the petiole) of fresh tissue into a 2 ml microfuge tube containing a 4 mm glass bead and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen. Grind the tissue in liquid nitrogen. Include at least two wild-types (or isogenic background to the mutant) samples. We use the mini-bead beater for grinding the tissues. Add 300 μl of Chl/IAA and 300 μl of 2% CTAB solution, vortex for 10 sec.Incubate at 65 °C for 30 min. Centrifuge at the maximal speed, 4 °C, 10 min. Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh 1.5 ml tube and add 300 μl of Chl/IAA. Vortex for 10 sec, and centrifuge at the maximal speed (18,210 x g), 4 °C, 10 min. Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh 1.5 ml tube and add an equal volume of isopropanol. Vortex for 10 sec.Precipitate the genomic DNA by incubating the tube for 10 min at -20 °C. Centrifuge at the maximal speed (18,210 x g), 4 °C, 10 min. Discard supernatant, wash once with 70% ethanol and dry pellet. Add 50 μl of TE buffer + 0.5 μl RNase stock solution. Mix the contents gently to dissolve the pellet. If it does not dissolve easily, warm the tubes at 65 °C. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 400 μl of 1 M CsCl solution and mix well.Add 800 μl of ethanol, mix and let the genomic DNA precipitate for 20 min at -20 °C. Centrifuge at the maximal speed (18,210 x g), 4 °C, 10 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 700 μl of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge the tubes again to and discard the remaining ethanol.Dissolve dried pellet in 50 μl TE buffer.",
    "The DNA can be stored at -20 °C. Note: The method above produces good quality DNA samples, which is important for the reproducibility of the downstream analysis. Other genomic extraction procedures can be used in place of the above method, as long as the DNA quality is comparable.  Primer designPrimers flanking the predicted editing site should be designed. We typically design a primer set producing an 80-120 bp fragment. Amplicon size > 150 bp might decrease the sensitivity of HRM analysis (Gundry et al., 2013). Tm should be 58 ± 2 °C, and GC content should not exceed 65% (Laurie and George, 2009). Optimizing the PCR protocolPipet the PCR mixture into a 1.5 ml tube, containing the following components per reaction. We recommend testing temperatures ± 3 °C around the Tm with two technical replicates. 4 μl 5x Phire Reaction Buffer2 μl dNTP, 2.5 mM each2 μl forward primer, 5 μM2 μl reverse primer, 5 μM2 μl genomic DNA from Step A14, diluted 1/10 in water0.4 μl Phire Hot Start II DNA Polymerase5.6 μl water Run a gradient PCR protocol as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180717/20180717021754_6440.jpgRun the PCR products on a 4% agarose gel in TAE buffer. Pick the condition that does not produce non-specific secondary bands. ATTENTION: Additional non-specific bands will complicate the HRM analysis by producing multiple peaks in the decay curve (see the example in Figure 1).  Notes: For preparing a 4% gel, it is recommended to mix the agarose and TAE and let it hydrate for 30 min prior to microwaving. This step promotes uniform melting.Theoretically any PCR enzyme can be used in combination with LC green. In our hands, Phire Hot Start II polymerase produced the most robust results. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180717/20180717022024_0658.jpgFigure 1.

Melt curves from a primer combination that does not produce non-specific bands.HRM analysisMake a PCR master mix into a 1.5 ml tube, containing the following components per reaction. We strongly recommend at least two technical replicates per sample. 4 μl 5x Phire Reaction Buffer2 μl dNTP, 2.5 mM each2 μl forward primer, 5 μM2 μl reverse primer, 5 μM2 μl LC Green dye0.4 μl Phire Hot Start II DNA Polymerase5.6 μl water Pipet 18 μl each of the master mix into the 96 well black and white PCR plate. Add 2 μl 1/10 diluted genomic DNA from the unknown samples. Overlay 20 μl mineral oil to each well and seal with an optical film.Note: Mineral oil is not required if the instrument used for producing HRM is top-heated.Perform a PCR reaction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180717/20180717022608_8197.jpgATTENTION: *The above two steps are critical for forming the heteroduplexes between the PCR products between WT and mutant DNA. Centrifuge the plate briefly to remove any condensation or air bubble. Obtain the melting curve using LightScanner or an equivalent machine capable of performing HRM analysis. In the authors’ lab, the temperature range of 75 °C to 100 °C is used. LightScaner records fluorescence intensity of each well at approximately 0.1 °C interval. The result is automatically saved once the melting is completed as .mat file."
