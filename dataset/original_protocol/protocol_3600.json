    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDouble-stranded RNA immunoprecipitation (dsRIP) from fetal livers\nTiming: 4 h\nThis protocol allows for the isolation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) from tissues, such as murine fetal livers. It is predicted to work with other tissues, such as bone marrow, and cell pellets of cell lines or primary cells. Cell numbers equivalent to ∼30 μg RNA should be used. Lysates are incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody J2 followed by isolation with magnetic beads (Protein G Dynabeads™) (Blango and Bass, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Lybecker et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Son et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nSet aside approximately one fifth of each fetal liver for preparation of total RNA as input control for dsRNA analysis. The total RNA can be extracted per standard protocol of the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat# 74134) or following the standard TRIzol isolation procedure.\nPlace the remainder of each fetal liver (∼30 million nucleated fetal liver cells) into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 600 μL dsRIP lysis buffer. Vortex and incubate on ice for exactly 5 min. If the tissues are firm and hard to dissociate and lyse by lysis buffer, they should be minced prior to lysis into smaller fragments.\nSpin down cell lysates in a tabletop centrifuge at maximum speed (13,000 × g) for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Carefully pipet equal volumes of the supernatant from each fetal liver into two new 1.5 mL tubes placed on ice. Add 5 μL anti-dsRNA J2 antibody (1 μg/μL) to one tube and 5 μg mouse IgG to the second tube and incubate at 4°C for 2 h with rotation. During this step, dsRNA will be recognized and bound by J2 antibody while non-specific binding is expected to occur with mouse IgG (Schonborn et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA J2 antibody may be replaced by other antibodies of interest, but readers should ensure specificity and that appropriate Dynabeads are used, according to the species antibodies are raised in.\nTowards the end of the incubation period of cell lysates with anti-dsRNA J2 antibody, prepare 25 μL Protein G Dynabeads for each sample.\nAliquot 25 μL Dynabeads Protein G each into two 1.5 mL tubes for each fetal liver and add 500 μL dsRIP lysis buffer and vortex.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic rack and allow beads to collect on side wall of Eppendorf tube for 2 min.\nCarefully pipette off supernatant without dislodging beads while tube remains on the magnetic rack. Repeat the wash step × 1.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the beads for the next step.\nAt the end of the two-hour lysate/antibody incubation period, transfer lysates to the tubes with the Protein G Dynabeads and incubate at 4°C for 1 h with rotation.\nAt the end of the incubation period, place the tubes on the magnetic rack and allow beads to collect on side wall of tubes, remove supernatant and wash beads as under 5b–5d 4 times with 500 μL dsRIP lysis buffer. This step should be performed in a cold room.\nPlace the tubes with washed beads on ice for RNA extraction.\nExtraction of immunoprecipitated dsRNAs",
    "Timing: 1 h\nThis protocol allows for isolation of J2-immunoprecipitated dsRNAs from fetal livers.\nAdd 1 mL TRIzol to each tube with Protein G Dynabeads™ and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nAdd 200 μL chloroform to the TRIzol solution, mix well and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nSpin at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove aqueous phase (530 μL) without disrupting protein layer or disturbing phenol phase. Add 200 μL chloroform and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nNote: The second round of incubation with chloroform serves to reduce contamination with phenol, which is a common problem in the extraction of low amount of RNAs inhibiting downstream reactions (Toni et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nSpin at 4°C and 13,000 × g for 15 min.\nTransfer 480 μL of the upper aqueous phase as above into equal volume (480 μL) isopropanol. Add 1 μL GlycoBlue or RNAse-free glycogen of choice, invert by hand 10 times to mix and incubate at −20°C for 20 min.\nSpin down at 4°C and 13,000 × g for 10 min to precipitate RNA.\nNote: Addition of glycogen serves to make the RNA pellet visible following precipitation and to prevent loss of RNA during the next wash and precipitation steps.\nPipet off and discard the supernatant and add 800 μL 75% ethanol in nuclease-free water to the RNA pellet.\nCentrifuge at 4°C and 8000 × g for 5 min.\nPipet off and discard the supernatant.\nPulse spin samples at ∼23°C.\nCarefully remove the remainder of the supernatant without disturbing the RNA pellet.\nAir-dry the pellet with the lid open at ∼23°C for 5 min.\nAdd 15–20 μL RNase-free water to the pellet and dissolve dsRNAs.",
    "Quantify RNA using a Nanodrop or other instrument to determine concentration and purity. Usually, one sample can produce around 2 ng/μL dsRNA corresponding to ∼30 ng in total. Clear absorbance peaks at 260 nm and 280 nm should be seen.\nPerform quality control analysis on a TapeStation System using High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/525-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of RNA profiles obtained by dsRIP on the TapeStation System\nPause Point: The extracted RNA can be stored at −80°C for use in subsequent steps.\nLibrary preparation and next-generation sequencing\nTiming: 2–5 days\nAt this step, submit both INPUT and experimental (J2-dsRIP ± IgG-dsRIP) samples for library generation. Note that IgG immunoprecipitation may not yield RNA sufficient for library preparation (in our hands, IgG controls yielded concentrations lower than 0.1 ng/μL and less than 2 ng in total, insufficient for sequencing). In this case only INPUT and J2-dsRNA samples should be processed further.\nRibosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion and library construction are performed following the instructions of the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase.\nSamples are ready for high-throughput sequencing on Illumina or other platforms. Generally, 60 million reads/sample should be sequenced to yield good results.\nrRNA depletion instead of mRNA selection is important for the dsRIP-seq to capture all possible dsRNAs that may or may not have poly-A tails, such as circular RNA (circRNA), for sequencing."
