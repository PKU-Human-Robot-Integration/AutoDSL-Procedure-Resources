    "Quantification of root-associated APase activity and the activity of APases released into the growth mediaQuantification of root-associated APase activityArabidopsis seeds are suspended with 5% sodium hypochlorite solution/0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with occasionally inverting for surface-sterilization. Remove the liquid and wash the seeds with sterilized ddH2O for 4 times.Place 20-30 surface-sterilized Arabidopsis seeds horizontally on the upper part of each 9-cm-diameter Petri dish containing full-strength or half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (P+ or P- medium). For each biological sample, use three replicates.Keep the Petri dishes at 4 °C for 2 days for stratification.Place the Petri dishes vertically in a controlled environment growth room and allow the seedlings to grow for 6-7 days under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime (90 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) at 22-23 °C.Excise roots with a razor blade and measure root length. The average root length of the Arabidopsis seedlings grown on P+ medium is 4.0-5.5 cm and that grown on P- medium is 2.5-4.0 cm.Immerse two roots with forceps into 650 µl of pre-warmed (37 °C) reaction buffer in a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube.Quickly add 50 µl of pNPP solution.Incubate at 37 °C for 1-4 h.Add 100 µl of 0.4 N NaOH and shake vigorously by hand to stop the reaction.Remove the roots with forceps and measure the absorbance at 410 nm (A410) in the remaining solution with a spectrophotometer.Calculate the root-associated APase activity as A410/cm root/h (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326194604_5488.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of APase activity secreted by Arabidopsis seedlings of WT and various single, double, and triple pap (purple acid phosphatase) mutants grown in or on P+ or P- medium. Root-associated APase activities (A) and APase activities in the medium (B) were determined with pNPP as the substrate. Values are means with SE.",
    "A one-way ANOVA analysis was carried out for the whole data set, and post hoc comparisons were conducted using the SPSS Tukey HSD test at P < 0.05. Within each of the four plots, values with different letters are significantly different. Adapted from Wang et al. (2014).Concentrating the proteins in the liquid growth mediumTransfer about 150 9-day-old seedlings that were grown vertically on P+ solid medium with autoclaved forceps to a 250 ml autoclaved conical flask containing 100 ml of P+ or P- liquid medium.Place the flasks on an orbital shaker (40 rpm/min) and allow the seedlings to grow for 6-7 days under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime (90 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) at 22-23 °C.Remove all of the seedlings from the flasks and freeze the liquid medium at -20 °C.Put the medium in the holder of a pre-cooled freeze dryer, cover the lid, and lyophilize the medium for 3-4 days.Thoroughly wash the bottom of the flask using 5-6 ml of ddH2O and transfer the washing solution to dialysis tubing.Dialyze the sample for 24 h at 4 °C against 4 L of pre-cooled ddH2O and change the ddH2O every 6 h.Transfer the dialyzed sample to a 2 ml tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500 x g.Transfer the supernatant to a 50 ml Falcon tube and freeze the liquid at -20 °C, then lyophilize for 2 days as described in step A2d.Dissolve the lyophilized sample in 200 µl of ddH2O.Measure the protein concentration using the Bradford method as described in step A3.The concentrated, secreted proteins can be used immediately or can be stored at -80 °C for further analysis.Determination of protein concentrationPipette 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 μl of 1 μg/μl BSA into 1.",
    "7 ml Eppendorf tubes and add ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μl.Add 980 μl of Bradford solution to each tube and mix well.Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Measure the absorbance at 595 nm (A595) with a spectrophotometer.Make a Bradford standard curve by plotting BSA content and A595.Add 20 μl of concentrated secreted proteins to 980 μl of Bradford solution.Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Measure the A595 with a spectrophotometer.Compare the resulting A595 value with the Bradford standard curve to determine the protein concentration of various samples.Quantification of APase activity in the growth mediumAdd 10 µl of concentrated proteins (about 2.5 µg) collected from the liquid growth medium to 590 µl of reaction buffer in a 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube. For each sample, make a least three replicates. Add 80 μl of pNPP solution to the reaction mixture.Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.Add 120 μl of 0.4 N NaOH to terminate the reaction.Measure the A410 with a spectrophotometer.Calculate the APase activity in the growth medium as A410/mg protein/min (Figure 1B).Analysis of root-associated APase activity using histochemical stainingGrow seedlings vertically on P+ or P- MS medium for 6-7 days as described in steps A1a-A1e.Add 100 ml of ddH2O and 0.5 g agar to a 250 ml conical flask, gently shake the flask, and then heat the flask in a microwave oven until the agar is completely dissolved.Add 1 ml of the BCIP stock solution (100x) and shake briefly by hand.Keep the BCIP/agar solution at room temperature or use flowing water to cool the solution for a few minutes to about 40 °C.Keep the BCIP/agar solution in a 40 °C water bath.",
    "Uniformly overlay about 5 ml of the BCIP/agar solution on one row of the Arabidopsis roots and incubate at room temperature for about 24 h (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326195115_7640.jpgFigure 2. A demonstration of how to overlay the BCIP/agar solution on the root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on Petri dishThe roots of Arabidopsis grown on P- medium will be stained blue, while these grown on P+ medium will remain unstained (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326195239_4980.jpgFigure 3. Histochemical staining of root-associated APase activity. Upper row: The morphologies of 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS P+ and P- medium without BCIP staining. Bottom row: Seedlings whose roots were stained with a 0.01% BCIP/0.5% agar solution for 24 h. In the lower row, root-associated APase activity (as indicated by the blue color) was detected on roots of seedlings grown on P- medium (bottom right) but not on roots of seedlings grown on P+ medium (bottom left).APase histochemical staining is greatly affected by the BCIP concentration. A high concentration of BCIP (0.08%-0.16%) can cause over-staining, which may mask differences in the level of secreted APase activity (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326195333_6105.jpgFigure 4. The effect of different concentrations of BCIP on staining of root-associated APase activity of 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS P- medium. The concentrations of BCIP used are indicated at the left bottom corner. nop1-1 and nop1-2 are Arabidopsis mutants that have mutations in the AtPAP10 gene. With the increase in BCIP concentration, the activities of other root-associated APases, mainly AtPAP12 and AtPAP26, are also detected. Adapted from Wang et al. (2011).",
    "Analysis of profiles of APase isoforms released into the growth medium (in-gel assay)The isozyme profile of APases released into the growth medium is visualized by separating protein samples on SDS-PAGE (denaturing gel) or Native-PAGE (non-denaturing gel), which are then stained with the chromogenic substrates β-NAP and fast black K. For Native-PAGE analysis, omit SDS from the gel and running buffer.Prepare a 10% separating gel and a 5% stacking gel (SDS-PAGE) according to the following Table 1.Table 1. Recipes for separating gel and stacking geltable:",

Change reaction buffer and repeat 4 times.Add 50 ml of APase activity profiling detection buffer and incubate at 37 °C for 1-3 h with gentle agitation.
