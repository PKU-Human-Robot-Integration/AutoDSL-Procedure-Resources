    "Sterile and aseptic techniques are critical to the preparation, maintenance, and use of slice cultures for extended periods.  Furthermore, the rationale for our use of slice cultures only after 18 days in vitro is based on evidence that indicates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission becomes most mature, and glia (astrocytes and microglia) become quiescent and consistent with their in vivo counterparts (Figure 1).\n1. Preparation & Maintenance of Hippocampal Slice Cultures\nThe same day of culturing, equilibrate sterile inserts in 1.1 mL growth media consisting of 50 mL Basal Medium Eagle, 25 mL Earle's Balanced Salt Solution, 23 mL Horse Serum, 0.5 mL Glutamax (200 mM stock), 0.1 mL gentamicin (10 mg/mL stock), 0.4 mL Fungizone (250 μg/mL), 1.45 mL D-glucose (45%; 42 mM total).\nKeep six-well trays in an incubator at 36°C, 5% carbon dioxide and 95% humidity.\nFor maximal sterility, culturing is ideally done in a HEPA filtered positive pressure culture room with the air also purified via self-contained ultra-violet light air-cleansing fans, and while wearing a clean lab coat and sterile gloves stretched over the lab coat sleeves.\nPrepare slice cultures in a BSL-1 laminar fume hood that includes all needed materials (i.e., McIlwain tissue chopper, related Teflon inserts, razor slicing blade, dissection cold (3-4°C) plate, surgical tools, and dissection Petri dishes) using a Wild (M8) stereomicroscope.\nAllow the cooling plate (run from a nearby water bath) to reach 3-4°C temperature for at least 30 min while at the same time exposing dissection materials to ultraviolet light to further establish sterility of the dissection area and tools.\n          \nThe laminar flow hood is periodically tested to ensure the ultraviolet light has sufficient power at the tabletop level with a shortwave ultraviolet light measuring meter.",
    "Use rat pups (P8-P9 and ~23 g/ea. from litters culled to 10 at birth) anesthetized with 100% carbon dioxide in a small animal box on an aseptic bench behind the fume hood  and cleansed by dipping in 100% ethanol within the fume hood, where all subsequent steps are performed.\nDecapitate pups in one half of a 100 mm Petri dish and place the head in the second half, using a fresh dish per pup.\nDissect out the brain and place it into the bottom half of a 60 mm Petri dish containing 10 mL sterile cold (3-4°C) Gey's Balanced Salt Solution supplemented with D-glucose to 6.5 mg/mL (i.e., 7.5 mL of 45% d-glucose per 500 mL bottle of Gey's.\nDissect out the hippocampus from each hemisphere and place them onto a Teflon disk for the McIlwain chopper.  Spread media away from the brain tissue using an iris spatula to prevent cut brain sections from adhering to the cutting blade.\nSection the hippocampi perpendicular to their long axis using the McIlwain chopper, with section thickness set at 350-400 μm.\nBriskly wash freshly cut slices off of the Teflon inserts and into the top half of a 60 mm Petri dish containing cold (3-4°C) Gey's Balanced Salt Solution with 6.5 mg/mL D-glucose using a one mL pipettor.\nInspect slices under the stereomicroscope for an intact dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer. \nGently place the largest slices onto an insert (three per insert and 12 slices/pup) and maintain under normal incubation conditions in an incubator cleaned every six months and calibrated every three months with an infrared carbon dioxide analyzer and thermometer accurate to one decimal place. \nRefresh growth media in culture dishes every 3-4 days in vitro using a BSL-2 hood and sterile technique.",
    "After 7 days in vitro, replace media with 1.1 mL serum-free media (SFM) consisting of 97 mL Neurobasal, 2 mL B27, 0.5 mL Glutamax (200 mM), 0.1  mL ascorbic acid (0.5 M), and 0.68 mL D-Glucose (45%; 42 mM total).\n2. Pre-screen Vitality of Slice Cultures\nAliquot Sytox Green stock (10 μL) and store at -20°C.\nDilute Sytox stock to 500 nM working concentration in serum-free growth media (i.e., 10 μL in 100 mL media).  Store Sytox media at 4°C and use for up to one week. \nPlace 1.1 mL of Sytox per well in 6-well culture dishes and warm to 36°C at 5% carbon dioxide for a sufficient period (i.e., as evidenced by lack of condensate on culture dishes). \nMeanwhile, allow an ultraviolet lamp (i.e., a fluorescent light source with an FITC filter) powered via a stabilized power supply to ensure uniform light intensity to warm to temperature for at least 20 min. \nPlace slice cultures (18 days in vitro) in Sytox-media for 10 min and then back to SFM to screen for irreversible CA1 pyramidal layer injury. \nView cultures on an aseptic surface of an inverted microscope, examined under 5x magnification. \nAccept cultures with fewer than 30 Sytox positive cells in the CA1 area.\n3. Cold-Preconditioning\nPlace 1.1 mL of SFM in 6-well culture dishes.  Allow cooled media (e.g., 30°C) to equilibrate in an incubator (5% carbon dioxide and 95% humidity) for at least 20 min before use.  Absence of condensate on culture dishes indicates that adequate time for equilibration has occurred.\nTransfer slice culture inserts to cooled media (1.1 mL/well) tray kept at 30°C and incubate for 90 min using sterile technique in a BSL-2 fume hood.",
    "Place slice cultures back into normal SFM under normal incubation conditions for 24 hours, again using sterile technique via a BSL-2 fume hood.\n4. Excitotoxic Injury\nBegin slice culture experimental use prescreen by exposing to Sytox media for 20 min.\n          \nAcquire individual slice images with slices maintained at an orientation similar to that used for prescreen (background images).  This is done by placing a mark to the left and two marks to the right with marker pen at \"10\" and \"two\" o'clock on each insert.  This maneuver facilitates using the same area of interest shape for each culture set of images.\nAt the same time, turn on the ultraviolet lamp source (under regulated power supply), and CCD camera for a minimum of 20 min so they warm to temperature. \nThen, calibrate the CCD camera with a fluoroscein standard.\n          \n\"Clear\" the CCD by exposing to light for 50 cycles unless an automatically calibrating CCD camera is used.  We have established a program within MetaMorph to clear our Cool Snap camera used for injury quantification.\nPlace 10 μL of fluoroscein in 90 mL PBS (10 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl at 7.3 pH) and vortex.\nPipette 10 μL of fluoroscein mixture onto a 100 μm deep hemacytometer.\nAdjust full image intensity to 1000/4096.\nCollect background images of slice cultures to verify that cold-preconditioning did not cause injury (i.e., discard cultures with ≥ 250 CA1 area of interest intensity). \nPrepare trays with NMDA media.\n          \nPrepare 10 mM stock solution of NMDA at least weekly.\nFor excitotoxic injury, dilute NMDA to 20 50 μM in SFM and equilibrate to normal incubation conditions for at least 20 min.\nUsing the BSL-2 hood and sterile technique, place inserts into the NMDA-media for 60 min under normal incubation conditions.",
    "Rinse NMDA off of inserts by dipping each insert three times in three separate 60 mm dishes each containing 10 mL Neurobasal warmed to 36°C.  Do not use more than three inserts for each set of three 60 mm wash dishes.\nReturn cultures to normal incubation conditions. \nCollect injury images 24 hours after exposure to NMDA.\n          \nCalibrate camera with fluoroscein standard as described above.\nPlace cultures in Sytox media for 20 min.\nQuantitate Injury:\n          \nUsing MetaMorph software, draw an AOI around CA1 region.\nMeasure intensity of selected region for \"injury.\"\nCopy and paste AOI from \"injury\" to \"background\" image.\nEnter values from \"injury\" and \"background\" into Excel.\nQuantitate \"numerator-background\" for Control and Cold-preconditioned cultures.\nUsing statistical software (e.g., SigmaStat), run appropriate statistical tests to compare injury of experimental group(s) versus a control group, which should always be included with each experimental run.\nNote:  If injury levels are low in one-day post-injury images, carry-out experiment to two three days.  Protection in cultures may be masked due to a lack of susceptibility to injury (Figure 2).\nNote:  The issue of \"protection\" prompted us to move to measuring injury levels and not ratios for all comparisons (Figure 3).\n5. Co-treatments Applied with Cold-preconditioning\nAn important advantage of slice cultures is that environmental conditions can be accurately controlled.  This means that cytokine signaling from cold-preconditioning can be measured, mimicked, and modulated to dissect the critical node aspects.\nRecombinant (e.g., agonist) proteins and neutralizing (e.g., antibody or soluble receptor) proteins can be used to mimic and modulate, respectively, cytokine signaling. \nIn general, these proteins are reconstituted and stored as aliquots at -20°C for use within six months to ensure adequate bioactivity. \nHere, we describe exemplary use of TNF-α signaling abrogation using soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1).",
    "Reconstitute sTNFR1 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to a stock of 50 μg/mL, aliquot in 20-50 μL amounts, and store at -20°C.\nFor use, dilute sTNFR1 to 200 ng/mL in slice cultures growth media warmed to 36°C and place slice cultures in sTNFR1-media for 20 min prior to cold-preconditioning.\n                    \nNote:  To reduce variance, it is best to dilute 200 ng/mL sTNFR1 in a large volume of growth media (i.e., 1:250 dilution from 50 μg/mL sTNFR1 stock in 10 mL of growth media requires 40 μL sTNFR1) vs. adding sTNFR1 directly to each well in dish (4.4 μL per 1.1 mL media).\nDilute sTNFR1 to 200 ng/mL in media and place 1.1 mL in each insert well.  Allow media to equilibrate to 30°C for at least 20 min before exposing slice cultures to cold-preconditioning for 90 min as described above.\nPlace slice cultures back at 36°C with sTNFR1 present in media.\n24 hours later, expose cultures to Sytox media for 20 min as previously described and collect background images to verify that cold-preconditioning did not injure cultures.\nQuantitate data as described above.\nRefresh media with components every 3-4 days in vitro.\n6. Immediate and Delayed Excitotoxic Injury after Cold-preconditioning\nImmediate injury with cold-preconditioning.\n          \nPerform cold-preconditioning as described above.\n                    \nAfter cold-preconditioning, return cultures to normal incubation for 20 min.\nThen, expose cultures to 20-50 μM NMDA injury for one hour.\nRinse cultures three times as described above and return to normal incubation.\nAfter 24 hours, acquire injury photos as described above.\nDelayed effects of cold-preconditioning.\n          \nPerform cold-preconditioning as described above.\nExpose cultures to NMDA injury 24 hours later as described above.\nContinue to acquire injury images for up to three days after initial cold-preconditioning to monitor protection.\n7.  RNA Isolation",
    "The following gene expression procedures are scaled for a single slice culture.\nTransfer slice cultures from growth media and normal incubation to 3 mL RNAlater in 6-well culture dishes to stabilize RNA.  Store at 4°C for up to three days until processed as described below.\nGently lift the slice culture off the insert with a fine tip paint brush and place in 1 mL of cold (4°C) PBS in a 1.5 mL (DNase, RNase, and DNA free) microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge samples for 30 sec and remove PBS supernatant. \nStore samples at -80°C.\nTo isolate RNA from slice cultures (~250 ng/ea.), thaw samples on ice.\nIsolate RNA using Qiagen MicroRNeasy kit via the following procedures that are described in further detail and adapted from the RNeasy Micro Handbook (Qiagen).\n          \nPlace 350 μL Buffer RLT (containing 10 μL β-mercaptoethanol per mL) into each microcentrifuge tube containing one slice culture.\nHomogenize samples by vortexing for 30 sec.

Discard buffer.\nDilute 10 μL of DNase I stock in 70 μL Buffer RDD to yield 80 μL total volume.  Pipette gently to mix do not vortex.  Prepare 80 μL of diluted DNase stock per sample.  Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd 350 μL Buffer RW1 to sample spin column and centrifuge for 15 sec.  Discard collection tube.",
    "Using a new collection tube, add 500 μL Buffer RPE to sample and centrifuge for 15 sec and discard buffer.\nPlace 500 μL of 80% ethanol on sample and centrifuge for 2 min.  Discard the collection tube.\nDry the spin columns by centrifuging for 5 min at max speed with tube caps open, discard collection tubes, and transfer spin column to a 1.5 mL collection tube supplied by the kit.\nTo collect isolated RNA, place 14 μL RNase-free water on the center of the spin column membrane.  Centrifuge for one min and collect the fluid.\nAdd 2 μL of RNasin (diluted at 1 U/ μL in TE buffer) and store at -80°C.  TE buffer consists of 10 mM Tris (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane), 1mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt hydrate) at 8.0 pH.\n8.  RNA Quantification\nNote:  RNasin does not interfere with the RiboGreen assay.\nDilute RiboGreen 1:200 in RNase-free TE buffer as follows.\n          \nTE (mL):\t1;\tRibogreen (μL):   5;\nTE (mL):\t4;\tRibogreen (μL):   20;\nTE (mL):\t6;\tRibogreen (μL):   30.\nRNA standards are prepared as follows.\n          \nYeast tRNA is used as the RNA standard.  tRNA is stored (-20°C) as 1 mg/mL in TE buffer.\nDilute the 1 mg/mL stock 1:100 in TE buffer, using (DNase, RNase, and DNA free) 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to produce a 1 μg/mL working standard.\nPrepare the standard curve directly in a 96-well fluorescent assay plate by adding the TE buffer diluent first, then adding the appropriate amount of the 1 μg/mL standard into the TE buffer already in the plate wells as shown in the adjacent table.  Make duplicate wells for each standard as follows.\n                    \nVol. of std. (μL): 100;\tVol. of TE (μL): 0;    RNA in well (ng): 100;\nVol. of std.

The most efficient way to do this is to use a multichannel pipettor.\nAdd 1 μL of RNA to the experimental sample wells.\nAdd 100 μL of the diluted RiboGreen to each well using the multichannel pipettor and triturate with one or two strokes of the pipettor.\nRead the plate on a fluorescent plate reader at 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission.\nConstruct a standard curve using Microsoft Excel with measured fluorescence intensities of RNA standards.\nCalculate RNA concentrations in samples using the resulting linear equation from the standards curve.\n9.  SYBR Green Quantitative PCR\nPCR procedures are best done in a clean area reserved specifically for work with RNA (Figure 4).\n          \nDecontaminate the area and related lab equipment from potential DNA contamination and RNase activity before use with ultraviolet light, 10% bleach or RNase Away.\nWear gloves throughout all procedures.\nUse RNase free water for all procedures as provided with the kit.  Do not use DEPC-(diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water.\nClose all PCR-related tubes immediately after use to retard aerosol contamination of foreign DNA.\nDevelop and characterize primers for the mRNA target(s) of interest.  These methods are detailed in the Supplementary Methods to Hulse et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2008 13.\ncDNA is produced from 30-200 ng total RNA via reverse transcription using iScript.",
    "The choice of starting RNA quantity is determined by the total amount of RNA available with the goal of performing RT-PCR analysis on a portion of the sample (i.e., 10%-20% of the total).\nThe remaining larger portion of RNA is stored for future analysis.\nThe iScript kit utilizes a blend of random hexamers and oligo-dT primers, and a modified MMLV reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μL.\nReverse transcription proceeds for 25°C for 30 min followed by 42°C for 50 min, and the reverse transcriptase is subsequently denatured at 85°C for 5 min.\nDilute cDNA in TE buffer to a final concentration of 0.4 ng/μL relative to starting RNA quantity.\nSYBR Green PCR based strategy is used to amplify cDNA.\n          \nPCR reactions are monitored in real-time by monitoring SYBR Green incorporation.\nThe 50 μL reactions contain 3 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 15 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, 1 μM fluorescein, 1x SYBR Green dye, 10 μL (4 ng) slice culture cDNA, and 1.25 U Platinum Taq polymerase in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris, 8.3 pH.\nPCR is performed using the iCycler thermocycler that can collect data in real time.\nCycling parameters consist of 15 sec denaturation (95°C) followed by 30 sec annealing/extension (60°C) repeated 45 times.\nOptical measurements are taken during the annealing/extension step and Ct values were determined using the iCycler system software.\ncDNA for cytokine targets  of interest and β-actin are used to construct standard curves.\n                    \nCopy number is determined from the molecular weight and mass of the plasmid cDNA.\nStandard curves of copy number/mass are constructed and included in each assay.\nCt values for each cDNA dilution are used to determine the copy number v.

Quantitative PCR for Microarrays\nQuantitative real-time qPCR array screening is a highly sensitive and reproducible means to probe for low-level inflammatory mediator expression changes.\nThe RT2 Profiler PCR array from SABiosciences is used for inflammatory mediator gene expression changes, with the following steps described in further detail by the manufacturer. \nThe assay uses 0.1-1.0 μg RNA.  We use local slice areas (e.g., CA1 which provides ~250 ng total RNA from two pooled samples) or whole single slices that contain a similar amount of total RNA. \nSample and control RNAs are reverse transcribed to cDNA using a first strand kit (e.g., #C-03).\n          \nThe resultant cDNA is mixed with SYBR Green-based PCR mix (#PA-011) and 25 μL aliquotted into each of the 96 wells of the PCR array plate (measuring 84 unique experimental genes and 16 housekeeping genes).\nOne array plate is prepared for the experimental sample and a second plate is prepared for the control.\nNote:  The SYBR Green master mix provided by the manufacturer is thermal cycler-specific.\nThermal cycling is done using an iCycler with a 40 cycle protocol consisting of a \n          denaturation step of 15 sec at 95°C followed by an extension step of one min at 60°C.  Optical data is collected during the extension step.  Thermal cycling is followed by melt curve analysis scanning the 55-95°C temperature range in 0.5°C increments. \nThe relative expression of genes in treated and control plates was determined using the 2-ΔΔCt method using the provided Excel based software and expressed as a fold increase or decrease relative to controls. \nGenes with two-fold increases or decreases in expression are considered for further evaluation.\nGenes identified from PCR array screening (e.g., using #PARN-011A for cold-preconditioning) are further confirmed using qPCR.",
    "PCR arrays identify which genes are regulated in response to stimuli.\nIn the example of cold-preconditioning, we identified the IL-11 gene as positively regulated in response to cold-preconditioning.\nThe next step in the analysis is to confirm that the newly identified gene is regulated in slice cultures using the qPCR assay detailed above.\n11.

Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2192/2192fig1.jpgFigure 1. Appearance of hippocampal slice cultures and microglia. The left hand image shows a typical mature (i.e., 21 day in vitro) hippocampal slice culture stain with NeuN (green) to illustrate the cytoarchitecture of the principal neurons.  Pyramidal neurons are shown in areas CA1 and CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons to the left.  Scale bar is 250 μm.  The right hand image is derived from the CA1 area and shown at higher power to illustrate the branched quality of quiescent microglia within mature slice cultures.  Cells were marked with the microglial surface marker, cd11b.  Scale bar is 50 μm.",
    "imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2192/2192fig2.jpgFigure 2. Cold-preconditioning neuroprotection in hippocampal slice cultures. Cultures are incubated with Sytox Green, a fluorescent marked dead cell marker. The top row shows sham control cultures and the bottom row shows slices exposed to 28°C for 90 min.  Left hand, pre-screen images show no CA1 injury.  Relative injury color calibration scale is shown in the left upper image.  Middle row images show relative slice culture injury 24 hours after exposure to 20 μM NMDA.  Notice that sham control injury is greater than that of cultures exposed to cold-preconditioning (CP). Traditionally, cultures are then exposed to 20 μM NMDA overnight to maximize CA1 neuronal injury levels and relative injury of CP v. sham, noted as a ratio of injury/maximal injury.  However, exposure to maximal injury stimuli may not be sufficient to overcome neuroprotection from preconditioning.  Accordingly, use of ratios of injury/ maximal injury may not accurately reflect neuroprotection from preconditioning.  This is evident in the right hand images that show CP maximal levels are less than those of the sham controls.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2192/2192fig3.jpgFigure 3. Schematic illustrating the utility of  using initial, first day measurements to quantitate injury levels in cold-preconditioning experiments. As noted above, we found that use of ratios (injury/maximal injury) could obscure neuroprotection from cold-pre-conditioning.   This can be seen from the schematic to the left where sham injury is shown in red and that after cold-preconditioning in blue.  One day after NMDA exposure cold-preconditioning shows a relative \"3\" level of injury v. sham (\"5\") control, consistent with 40% neuroprotection.  However, if a traditional format using ratios (i.e., injury/maximal injury) is used, no protection is evident [i.e., (5/10)=50% for sham v. (3/6)=50% for cold-preconditioning].",

Double-label immunostaining used to confirm qPCR and qPCR array results. A slice culture was processed for IL-11 (red) and NeuN (green; to mark neurons) to probe for the cellular expression loci of IL-11.  Notice that some pyramidal neurons (arrows) show IL-11 and NeuN staining (yellow) while a few smaller cells (arrows), presumed to be astrocytes, show only increased IL-11 staining (red)."
