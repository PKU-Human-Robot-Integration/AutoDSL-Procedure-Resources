    "Sample collectionPreparation (1)Wrap clean tweezers and forceps in an aluminum foil and autoclave them.Prepare two 60 mm dishes per muscle sample, pipette 3 ml cold (~5 °C) sterile DPBS into each dish.Collection of human muscle biopsies from the rectus abdominis muscleNotes:Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) muscle biopsies were obtained during peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion procedures. Control biopsies were taken from otherwise healthy subjects during elective surgery for abdominal wall hernias. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The muscle biopsies were delivered to the lab in a 50 ml tube containing 20 ml DPBS. The sample had to be collected and maintained emersed in ice for a half an hour at the most. Sample size is variable.Preparation (2)Give muscle tissue a code, that identifies each specimen for each patient.Transfer the muscle biopsies in a 60 mm dish containing 3 ml cold (~5 °C) DPBS.Clean tissue muscle by tweezers and a sterile mono-use scalpel from any visible connective and adipose tissue.Reduce the specimen size with a sterile mono-use scalpel, if necessary. Generally 0.4 x 0.4 cm is enough.Wash the muscle in another 60 mm dish containing 3 ml of cold (~5 °C) DPBS.Paraffin slides preparationMuscle processingTransfer the tissue into a 15 ml conical tube containing 10 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde and fix overnight at 4 °C.Discard 2% paraformaldehyde.Dehydrate the tissue by passing it through a series of solutions of increasing Ethanol concentration:10 ml 50% ethanol for 60 min at room temperature10 ml 70% ethanol for 60 min at room temperature10 ml of 100% ethanol for 60 min at room temperature10 ml of 100% ethanol overnight at 4 °CClear with xylene for 4 h at room temperature.Discard the xylene.Note: For each step, decant the solutions into the organic solvent disposal container in the fume cupboard.",
    "Infiltrate the muscle tissue in melted paraffin at 56 °C for 60 min.EmbeddingUse forceps to transfer the muscle tissue to the well of the embedding base mold.Snap the base of the tissue cassette into the embedding base mold.Fill the mold with melted paraffin.Notes: Previously the embedding base mold is cooled down on a block of ice, and each step is carried out as quickly as possible! Allow the paraffin to solidify at -20 °C. SectioningHeat the deionized water up to 56 °C in a histology bath.Mount the paraffin block on the microtome.Write down the code specimen on the slide with a pencil.Cut thin sections (5 µm).Pick up the sections using small brushes and transfer them into the histology bath.Dip a microscope slide into the histology bath, allowing the tissue section to adhere to its surface.Dry the slides in an oven at 56 °C from 1 h up to overnight.Note: For each slide, pick up 2 sections. In the histology bath, the temperature of water must be 56 °C to allow the sections to flatten.Immunohistochemistry stainingNotes:Before staining, the paraffin must be removed. All steps must be performed in the fume cupboard. De-paraffinization/RehydrationPrepare 4 glass staining dishes, each with a lid, containing:Ethanol 50%Ethanol 70%Ethanol 100%XyleneTransfer the slides into:table:",

    "Antigen UnmaskingTransfer the slides into the PMP vertical staining jar with lid.Heat slides in the microwave submersed in 60 ml 10 mM sodium citrate buffer and partially covered with lid until boiling is initiated.Sub-boil for 15 min.Cool slides on bench top for 20 min.Note: In every groove of the PMP vertical staining jar, a slide must be accommodated. The number of slides must be the same for every session of antigen unmasking so that the efficiency of unmasking is always the same. This ensures a similar heat distribution to each slide and reduces the differences in antigen retrieval. In our jar, there are 8 grooves, and in every session, we have always accommodated 8 slides. If the slides with the muscle sample are less than 8, the empty slides have to, however, be heated. For example, 3 slides with muscle tissue plus 5 empty slides. The 10 mM sodium citrate buffer must not be re-used after each boiling. StainingWash the slides in deionized water for 30 s.Block endogen peroxidases with 3% hydrogen peroxide (peroxidase inhibition solution) for 15 min (repeat twice).Note: Prepare freshly 3% hydrogen peroxide at the time of the use and for each change time. Wash the slides in deionized water for 30 s.Wash the sections in PBS for 5 min.Note: From this point forward, transfer the slides in the humidity chamber. Wash the slides in the glass staining dish. Block each section with 100-200 µl of 5% BSA for 20 min, at room temperature.Wash the sections in PBS for 5 min for 3 times.Draw a circle around the tissue section by a pap pen.Block each section with a drop of avidin for 15 min at room temperature.Repeat Step C3f.OKBlock each section with a drop of biotin for 15 min, at room temperature.Repeat Step C3f.",
    "Dilute the primary antibodies in 1% BSA-PBS.Note: The bottom of the humidity chamber was covered with water. For primary antibody dilution, we consulted product datasheet. According to TLR4, 1:100, the negative control was obtained incubating the section with mouse IgG in the same conditions. Incubate each section with 100 µl overnight at room temperature.See Repeat Step C3f.Dilute the Biotinylated Anti-Mouse IgG in PBS in the ratio of 1:300.Incubate each section with 100 µl, 30 min at room temperature.Repeat Step C3f.Dilute Streptavidin/HRP in PBS in the ratio of 1:500.Repeat Step C3p.Note: During Steps C3m, C3p and C3s, ensure that the slides dry up. Repeat C3f.Prepare DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride) Enhanced Liquid Substrate System according to data sheet.Incubate each section with 100 µl DAB solution for 15 min at room temperature.Note: Monitor the staining development under a microscope. Repeat Step C3f.Note: Wash the slides in a glass staining dish. Immerse slides in deionized water.Counterstain the sections with Carazzi’s Hematoxylin for 1 min.Rinse under tap water for 5 min.Transfer the slides into the deionized water.Rehydration and the mounting of the sectionsTransfer the slides into:table:",

Preparing permanently mounted sectionsPlace 2-3 drops of Eukitt over the section.Avoid trapping air bubbles, lowering the coverslip carefully from one side of the droplet by the coverglass forceps.Note: There should be enough mounting medium to completely cover the bottom of the cover slide. Excess Eukitt can be removed by a paper towel (Figure 1). Leave slides in the fume cupboard for 24 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190114/20190114180818_7301.jpgFigure 1.
