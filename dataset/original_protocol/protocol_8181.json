    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n1. Preparations of microdrive array parts\nPrint the microdrive array parts using a 3D printer using dental model resin (Figure 1A,B). Ensure that the thickness of individual 3D printed layers is less than 50 µm to keep the small holes on the printed parts clear and viable.\n\tNOTE: The microdrive array consists of five parts (Figure 1C): (1) the main body of the microdrive array, which includes nine microdrive-screws for tetrodes and one screw for a silicon-probe (Figure 1Ca-d). The coordination of the tetrode bundle and hole for the opto-silicon probe at the bottom depends on the target brain area’s coordinates (Figure 1Cd); (2) a shuttle to attach a silicon-probe or optrode (Figure 1Ce); (3) a probe electrical connecter mount to hold the silicon probe connecter (Figure 1Cf); (4) a fiber ferrule holder that clamps to the center part of the body to prevent undesired movements of the implanted opto-silicon probe when plugging/unplugging an optical fiber connector (Figure 1Cg); and (5) a shielding cone that provides physical and electrical shielding to the microdrive array for stable recording (Figure 1Ch). The total weight of the microdrive array is 5.9 g, including the shielding cone (Table 1). If holes are clogged in the printed parts, drill out the holes using drill bits: #76 for the inner holes and #68 for the outer holes for tetrode-microdrive screws, #71 for tetrode microdrive-screw supporter hole, and #77 for the holes for the guide-posts at the bottom of the body.\nInsertion of guide posts into the microdrive array body.\n\t\nCut two 16 mm lengths of 26-Ga stainless steel wire. Gently sharpen the wire tips using a rotary grinder.",
    "Insert the wires into the bottom holes of the body (Figure 2A). Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue at the bottom of the body to secure the guide posts.\n2. Opto-silicon probe preparation\nPrepare the microdrive screw for a silicon-probe.\n\tNOTE: The microdrive screw for the silicon probe consists of a custom screw (300 µm pitch), supporting a support tube, and an L-shape tube (Figure 2B).\n\t\nPrepare the mold for the microdrive head (Figure 2C). To construct the mold, prepare the 3D-printed plastic pattern of the microdrive (Figure 2Ca). Then, pour liquid silicone gel after making a temporal wall by putting tapes around the pattern. Remove air bubbles by shaking gently, wait until it is cured, then remove the silicone-gel mold from the pattern (Figure 2Cb).\nCut 18 mm and 9.5 mm lengths of 23 G stainless wire using a rotary grinder. Roughen the top 2–3 mm of the wires with a rotary grinder to enhance adhesion of the dental acrylic.\nTake one custom screw and apply small amount of silicon oil to reduce the friction with the dental acrylic. Set the wires and a custom-screw to the mold.\nPour dental acrylic into the mold using a syringe to eliminate air bubbles around the wires and the screws. Air bubble contamination will make the microdrive fragile. Wait until the dental acrylic is fully cured, then take off the microdrive screws from the mold. Bend 6 mm of the longer wire tip to a 60° angle using pliers.\nCheck the quality of the microdrive screws (e.g., cracks, air-bubbles, and friction) to rotate the screw. If there is high friction, rotate the screw until they become smooth using an electric screw driver with a customized driver tip, which couples with the microdrive screw.",
    "Install the microdrive screw into the microdrive array body to check whether it moves up and down smoothly by turning the screw. Threads for the screw are automatically created when inserting the screw into the hole of the body.\nPrepare the shuttle (Figure 3Aa).\n\t\nCut two 5 mm lengths of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tubing using sharp scissors. Align the tubes at both sides of the shuttle. Glue the tubes and shuttle using epoxy.\nApply small amount of silicon oil on the guide posts. Check the quality of the shuttle by inserting onto the guide posts of the microdrive array body. Make sure the shuttle moves smoothly without excessive friction.\nPrepare an optorode (Figure 3Ab). This step can be skipped if an optogenetic experiment is not required.\n\t\nCleave the optical fiber to 21 mm in length using a ruby cutter. Grind the fiber tip to make the tip flat and shiny.\nGently place the optical fiber on the front side of the silicon-probe. The fiber tip is positioned 200–300 µm above the top of the electrode sites. Hold the fiber temporarily with transparent tape.\nGlue the optical fiber to the base of the silicon-probe using small amount of epoxy. Wait for at least 5 h until the epoxy is fully cured.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to attach the optical fiber on the same side as the electrode sites. Attaching the fiber at the backside may prevent light from properly illuminating the recording sites.",
    "Attach the shuttle to the silicon probe (Figure 3Ac): apply a small amount of epoxy at the back of the silicon-probe’s base. Attach the bottom part of the shuttle to the silicon-probe’s base, and gently hold in position for 2–3 min to avoid formation of a gap between the shuttle and silicon-probe base during initial cure of the epoxy. Wait for at least 5 h until the epoxy is completely cured.\nCarefully insert the shuttle tubes onto the guide posts of the main body under the microscope (Figure 3B). During this procedure, hold the groove of the shuttle with fine tweezers.\nInsert the microdrive-screw into the screw hole by turning the screw. Engage the silicon probe and microdrive-screw by inserting the tip of the L-shape wire into the groove of the shuttle head (Figure 3C).\nAttach the probe electrical connecter holder to the microdrive array body (Figure 3D).\n\t\nCut two #0 screws to 3.5 mm thread length. Grind the tips to remove burrs.\nPlace the probe connecter holder on the body. Place the silicon probe electrical connector into the holder.\nSecure the silicon probe connector in the holder using epoxy, and be sure to not glue it to the microdrive array body to allow for the recovery procedure of the silicon probe. Insert the screws to hold the probe connecter holder.\nAttach the ferrule-holder to the opto-silicon probe and microdrive array body (Figure 3D).\n\t\nCut two #0 screws to 6 mm thread length. Grind the tips to remove burrs.\nGrind the outside of two #0 machine screw nuts to make small hex nuts with 2.5–3.0 mm outer diameter to reduce the weight and space.\nInsert the screws into component A of the holder. Glue the screw heads using epoxy.",
    "Apply small amount of silicon grease to component A and B to reduce friction with the body. Insert component A into the body, then temporally hold using inverse tweezers.\nPlace component B onto component A’s screws. Thread the customized nuts into the screws. Use pliers to tighten the nuts to secure the ferrule holder on the body.\nInsert the fiber ferrule into the groove of the fiber ferrule holder (component B). Ensure that the fiber ferrule is sticking 4–5 mm out from the holder.\nApply small amount of epoxy between the ferrule and the holder groove. Wait until the epoxy is fully cured and check that the ferrule does not move. Check the shuttle and ferrule holder for smooth motion by loosening the nuts before turning the microdrive-screw.\nCheck the working distance of the probe. Ensure that the probe tip completely retracts into the body when the ferrule-holder is at the top position while the shuttle tubes are still associated with the guide-posts. The maximum working distance is determined by the length of the silicone probe and the target brain region.\nIf the microdrive-screw is loose, apply small amount of dental acrylic around the screw to add more threads for support. When it is cured, rotate the screw to check tightness and stability.\n3. Tetrode preparation\nNOTE: This procedure is similar to previously published articles8,19,20,39.\nPrepare the microdrive screws for the tetrode. The microdrive for a tetrode consists of a custom-machined screw and a 23 G tubing (Figure 2B). This procedure is similar to section 2.1.\nMake a bundle of 30 G stainless steel tubing that has a 5.5 mil wire inside. In this case, a total of nine 30 G tubing (eight recording tetrodes and one reference electrode) were used.",
    "Thread the 30 G bundle from the bottom of the drive body, and secure them with 20 G thin-walled tubing to the main body. Trim the bottom of the bundle with a rotary grinder to make the tip even and flush. Trim top part of the 30 G tubes with a rotary grinder so that the 30 G tube sticks out about 0.5 mm from the main body.\nLoad 5.5 mil polyimide insulating tubes into the 30 G tubing. Prepare tetrode wires and load them into a 32-channel electric interface board (EIB). Check electrical connection with the impedance tester before final precision cut.\nLower electrode tip impedance to 250–350 kΩ with gold plating solution. Fix all tetrodes with superglue.\nFill excessive gap between polyimide tube and tetrode with mineral oil for sealing and lubrication. Route the ground wire to the EIB.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, the optical fiber can be integrated along tetrode wires12.\n4. Attaching the shielding cone\nPaint silver conductive shielding paint on the inside of the printed cone. Place the microdrive array inside of the cone (Figure 3E).\nCut two #0 screws to 3.5 mm thread length. Fasten the screws from the outside of the cone to hold the microdrive array in place.\nApply silver paint around the screw head to electrically connect the shielding cone with electrical ground. Check the electrical connectivity between the ground wire and cone. Apply a small amount of epoxy between the microdrive array body and shielding cone to securely attach the body.",
    "NOTE: Another way to prepare the shielding cone is to use aluminum tape40 (Figure 3F). First, prepare the pattern paper for the shielding cone after sticking aluminum foil to the paper (Figure 3Fa). Then, roll the paper and attach it to the microdrive body using a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue (Figure 3Fb). The weight of this cone is 0.72 g and total weight of the microdrive array is reduced to 4.7 g (Table 1).\n5. Implant surgery\nNOTE: This procedure is modified from previously published articles18,39,41 for dual-site implantation. Ensure that the weight of the animal is over 25 g for the microdrive implant for faster recovery after the surgery.\nPreparation\n\t\nTo prepare a ground screw, attach the silver wire to a skull screw and apply silver paint. Then, attach a gold pin to the opposite side of the wire using silver paint.\nPrepare the drive holding adapter to hold the microdrive array to a stereotactic device. Attach a male connecter to a stainless handle using epoxy. Make sure that alignment of the connecter and stainless handle is straight.\nIn the case that histological confirmation is needed after recording, apply Di-I to the tetrodes or backside of the silicon-probe38.\nLower the silicon-probe down to be desired depth. Loosen the nuts of the ferrule holder using pliers, lower the silicon-probe (opto-silicon probe) by turning the silicon-probe’s microdrive-screw, then fasten the nuts to secure the ferrule holder. When implanting tetrodes in hippocampal area CA1 and a silicon-probe in MEC, the distance between the tetrode cannula and silicon-probe’s tip is 3–4 mm.",
    "Set the anesthetized mouse (0.8%–1.5% isoflurane) in a stereotaxic device. The anesthetic condition of the mouse is confirmed by absence of the toe-pinch reflex. Apply clear ointment to the eyes to prevent drying. Cover the eyes with a piece of foil to protect from strong surgical light exposure.\nDisinfect the mouse’s scalp with iodine and isopropanol after shaving the fur. Make a 1.5–2.0 cm incision at the scalp using standard surgical scissors, and remove the tissue over the skull using cotton swabs after subcutaneously applying lidocaine.\nAlign the mouse head with the stereotaxic tool. Ensure that the height difference between bregma and lambda is less than 100 μm. Determine the craniotomy location using an atlas and mark these locations with a sterilized pencil.\nAnchor the skull screws (0.8 mm diameter, 0.200 mm thread pitch) by rotating them 1.5 turns (0.3 mm) on the skull, using surgical tweezers and a screwdriver after drilling 8–11 holes in the skull using 0.5 mm drill bit.\n\tNOTE: 2–4 holes in the frontal skull, 2–3 holes in each side of the parietal skull, and 1–2 holes in the interparietal skull are suggested.\nAttach the ground screw to the hole by rotating it one turn (0.2 mm) after drilling a hole in the interparietal bone. Ensure that this hole does not penetrate through the bone into the brain case; otherwise, cerebellar signals will contaminate the recording. Check that the impedance is less than 20 kΩ at 1 kHz between the ground screw and skull screws using an impedance meter.\n\tNOTE: Larger impedance will cause the introduction of motion artifacts during recording.\nPerform the craniotomy at the marked locations. The dura can be left intact in mice.",
    "Connect the male pin of the ground screw and the microdrive array’s ground connector. Check connectivity using the impedance meter by measuring between the ground screw and shielding.\nSet the microdrive array to the adapter, set it to the stereotaxic device, and slowly lower the silicon probe until the desired depth. Ensure that the tetrode bundles are placed above the brain surface but still inside of the microdrive array when the silicon probe is inserted into the brain (Figure 4A).\nCarefully apply the silicon grease to seal the area of the silicon probe and the tetrode bundle (Figure 4B). Put a small amount of the silicon grease at the tip of a 20 G needle and apply the grease around the probes using the needle. Repeat until silicon grease completely covers the area around the probe so that dental acrylic does not flow onto or underneath the electrodes/probes. Be careful not to let the grease touch the electrode sites, otherwise it will dramatically increase the impedance of the recording sites.\nApply dental acrylic to fix the microdrive array to the anchoring screws in the skull.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to apply dental acrylic in three layers to avoid the excessive heat produced during curing of the acrylic.\nRemove the adapter from the microdrive array carefully. Inject 1 mL of PBS subcutaneously to prevent dehydration. Inject 5 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously as an analgesic treatment.\nCover the silicon-probe connector by a piece of tape to prevent any dirt from getting inside of the electrical connections. Cover the microdrive array using a plastic paraffin film and tape it in place.",
    "Administer appropriate analgesic treatment for 3 days (e.g., subcutaneous injections of 2 mg/kg meloxicam once per day). Allow 3–5 days for recovery before starting the tetrode adjustment. The implanted mouse after the recovery period is shown in Figure 4C.\n6. Recovering the silicon-probe (Figure 4D)\nInject ketamine (75 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (1 mg/kg) anesthetics intraperitoneally and confirmed absence of the toe-pinch reflex. Fix the anesthetized mouse by directly perfusing 4% paraformaldehyde through the heart using a hood. Surgical methods for rodents are described previously42.\nLoosen the nuts of the ferrule holder using a plier. Then, carefully move it to the top of the body by turning the adjusting screw to fully retract the silicon-probe towards inside of the microdrive array body. Fasten the nuts to hold the probe at the top position.\nTake the mouse brain out from the bottom by cracking the skull from the side. The microdrive array is now separated from the animal.\nCompletely remove the L-shaped microdrive-screw that drives the silicon-probe. Loosen and take out the nuts of the ferrule holder using pliers. Take out the component A of the ferrule holder.\nUnscrew the probe connector mount and detach from the drive body. Check that the probe connector mount can come off from the microdrive array body.\nHold the top part of the shuttle with tweezers, then carefully slide the silicon-probe assembly out from the microdrive array.\nClean the probe tip with contact lens cleaner (first with enzyme, then 3% hydrogen peroxide) for at least 1 day. Carefully wipe the electrode tip using isopropanol pads under the microscope. Keep the probe in a static-free storage box.\n\tNOTE: The shuttle and probe connector mount remain attached to the silicon probe and can be reused in the next implantation.",
    "NOTE: Some silicon probes are not tolerable with hydrogen peroxide. In this case, use the contact lens solution containing proteolytic enzyme only.\nTo reuse the microdrive array body for the next surgery, remove the dental acrylic using a combination of fine-tip drills and nippers. Then, recover the skull-screws by immersing the removed dental acrylic into acetone. Note that the acetone will dissolve plastic parts of the microdrive array.\nRemove the epoxy between the microdrive body and shielding cone using a scalpel.\n\tNOTE: No additional parts need to be printed again for the next surgery if the microdrive is not broken.\nSubscription Required.
