    "1. MLV Transduction of Human Cells\nIsolate target cells and transduce them with an mLV-derived retroviral vector harboring the eGFP reporter gene and pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G (VSV-G) or the amphotropic envelope glycoprotein16.\nKeep mock-transduced cells as a negative control for the following analyses. Since mLV-based retroviral vectors can transduce efficiently dividing cells, culture the target cell population in conditions that stimulate cell division. Transduction conditions need to be specifically optimized for each cell type under study. Cell growth and transduction conditions for human hematopoietic progenitors, T cells and epidermal cells are described in References 7, 14, 15, and 17.\n48 h after transduction, resuspend 100,000 cells in 300 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% fetal bovine serum and measure eGFP expression by flow cytometric analysis (488-nm excitation laser). Use mock-transduced cells as negative control. For optimal integration site retrieval, purify GFP+ cells by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).\nCollect 0.5 to 5 million cells for genomic DNA preparation. A longer culture period (>7 days) is preferred to dilute the unintegrated provirus and necessary when analyzing the long-term progeny of bona fide stem cells (see Discussion Section and reference15). The cell pellets can be snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C until use.\n2. Amplification of mLV integration sites by linker-mediated-PCR (LM-PCR)\nPreparation of genomic DNA (gDNA)\nExtract gDNA using a column-based DNA extraction kit and follow the protocol for cultured cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nRestriction enzyme digestion\nSet up 4 restriction enzyme digestions per sample in 1.5 mL tubes.

Samples can be stored at -20 °C until use.\nSecond PCR\nSet up 48 PCR reactions (1 from each \"first PCR\" tube) in 0.2 mL tubes. For each PCR, add the following components to 2 µL of the first PCR reaction: 5 µL of 10X PCR buffer, 2 µL of 50 mM Magnesium Sulfate, 1 µL of 10 mM dNTP Mix, 1 µL of 10 μM linker nested primer, 1 µL of 10 μM mLV-3' LTR nested primer, 0.3 µL of Taq DNA Polymerase (1.5 U) and 37.7 µL of water. Use nested primers designed for the specific massive sequencing strategy chosen: (i) linker nested primer and mLV-3' LTR nested primer compatible with Illumina platform; (ii) linker nested primer and mLV-3' LTR nested primer compatible with Roche platform. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1.\nPerform PCR reaction in a thermal cycler with heated lid, as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 5 min; hold at 4 °C.
