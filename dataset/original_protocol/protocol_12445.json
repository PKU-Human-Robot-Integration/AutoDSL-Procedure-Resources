    "The following methods are in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Texas at Austin and Illinois Wesleyan Animal Care and Use Committees. It is recommended that researchers either wear gloves or take appropriate precautions (washing hands before and after) when engaging in behavioral training with any laboratory animal. Gloves must be worn when handling animals in preparation for and during surgery.\n1. Habituation and Food Restriction\nNOTE: As the PMRT is an appetitive task, it is beneficial to restrict the amount and timing of feeding prior to the onset of training in order to motivate the reaching response and prevent satiety during training sessions.\nPlace mice on a restricted feeding schedule beginning at least 1 week prior to the onset of task training. Weigh each mouse prior to the onset of food restriction to establish free-feeding weights, which are determined as the weights of each animal on the first day of restricted feeding.\n\t\nFeed mice once daily, with each mouse receiving ~2.5 g of standard rodent chow per day (e.g., if there are 4 mice housed in a cage, the cage will receive 10 g of food daily). Ensure feeding occurs at the same time each day, preferably at the time daily training sessions are expected to conclude.\nWeigh animals regularly to ensure that no mouse loses more than 10% of their free-feeding weight. NOTE: Adjust daily food amounts accordingly to promote appropriate weight maintenance. Mice typically gain weight as they mature, even with constant food restriction Mice remain on food restriction for the duration of PMRT training/assessment.",
    "Expose animals to smaller pieces of pasta (cut to 1.6 cm) in their home cage several times prior to training in order to overcome neophobic responses. NOTE: Typically 5-10 days of exposure are sufficient, with about 4 pieces per mouse provided at each feeding.\nCut pasta pieces to size (3.2 cm) using a razor blade. NOTE: It is recommended that an excess of pasta pieces are cut prior to beginning the day’s training and unused pieces stored in an airtight container. Capellini pasta is used to fill the matrix. As different brands of pasta vary in texture and diameter, which could influence the stability of pasta in the matrix or the amount of force necessary for the mice to break the pasta, it is recommended that DeCecco brand pasta be used throughout training and testing.\nPlace uncooked capellini pasta pieces in the pasta matrix, filling all available holes in the matrix (Figure 1A).\nHabituate mice to the testing chamber with a full pasta matrix placed in front (Figure 1A) and several pieces of pasta to eat at the bottom of the testing chamber. Habituate mice for 3 sessions of 5-10 min. NOTE: Mice should not be encouraged to reach for pasta during habituation training. Mice usually begin to show interest in the pasta located outside of the reaching chamber by sniffing at it through the aperture. It is possible to habituate two cage mates in a single chamber if desired, but mice should be shaped and trained individually. All surfaces should be cleaned with 70% ethanol or a similar, safe disinfecting solution before and after each animal is placed in the behavioral apparatus.\n2. Shaping the Reach",
    "Determine each animal’s preferred limb by shaping the reach over 3-5 once-daily shaping trials. Permit mice to reach for 10 min or a total of 10 times, which occurs first.\n\t\nPlace mice individually in the testing chamber with a full pasta matrix in front of the chamber as in habituation training (Figure 1A).\nRecord the number of reaches with each limb, denoting the number of reaches with the right and left limbs separately. Define a reach as extension of the limb through the reaching aperture such that the wrist breaks the plane of the chamber; it is not necessary for the reach to be directed toward or make contact with the pasta.\nHold several pieces of pasta just inside the chamber through the reaching aperture to encourage mice that are reluctant to reach. Draw the pasta pieces out when the mouse shows interest (e.g. sniffing, biting), thus encouraging them to reach after the retreating pasta pieces. If the mice do not initially show interest in the dry pasta, then wet the tips of the pasta pieces in a small cup of warm water to make them more palatable.\nDetermine limb preference when a mouse exhibits a minimum of 70% of their daily reaches with a single limb. Do not to over-shape animals, as this can limit the amount of learning observed during the training portion of reaching tasks 17. Begin PMRT training once mice are shaped. NOTE: Training can be started as soon as the next day, but it is also acceptable to wait several days between shaping and training procedures.\n3. Reaching Training",
    "Train mice once daily prior to insult in order to establish proficiency on the PMRT. NOTE: Each trial consists of a maximum of 15 min or 100 reaches counted by the observer (successful and unsuccessful), whichever occurs first. Mice are trained to reach only with their preferred limb. Mice will tolerate two trials per day if a more intense training paradigm is desired 18.\n\t\nPlace mice in the testing chamber with a half-full matrix placed in front (Figure 1B). Train mice to reach only with their preferred limb by filling only the side of the matrix contralateral to the preferred limb since mice reach across the midline of their body. Leave the portion of the matrix corresponding to the unpreferred limb unfilled in order to discourage reach attempts with this limb (which would not be successful because they cannot reach the pasta) and encourage reaching only with the preferred limb.\nPlace a small amount of pressure on the pasta while it is in the matrix to help mice successfully break pieces during early training sessions. Do not break the pasta pieces for the mouse. Achieve this by holding one or two pasta pieces lightly behind and perpendicular to the intended reaching target. This small amount of support helps stabilize the thin pasta, which is quite flexible and difficult for mice to grasp as they are initially learning the task.\nRecord the total number of reaches, number of successful reaches, and locations of successful reaches. Successful reaches require the mouse to reach through the aperture, grab a piece of pasta, and break the pasta piece to remove it from the matrix. NOTE: Pasta pieces should not be replaced in the matrix until after the trial has terminated. Early in training, mice will not break many pasta pieces.",
    "Train mice on the PMRT to proficiency, which is defined as at least 3 days (and up to 5 days) of consistent performance (breaking at least 9 pieces of pasta with no more than 2 more or fewer pieces over days). It often takes between 15-20 days to train young adult mice to proficiency.\n4. Less-affected Limb Training\nTrain the less-affected limb (i.e., the pre-operative unpreferred limb) beginning four days after ischemic insult to the motor cortex contralateral to the preferred reaching limb (see Figure 2 for clarification on affected/preferred and less-affected/unpreferred limbs). Administer once daily 15-min or 100-reach training sessions.\n\t\nRemove the first column of pasta (i.e., the most medial vertical column extending from the reaching aperture) for the first week of less-affected limb training in order to ensure that early reaches with the affected limb are not successful.\nPlace mice in the reaching chamber with the half-filled matrix placed in front. Ensure that the filled half of the matrix is opposite of the pre-operative filled half, which will force the mice to now reach with the less-affected (unpreferred) limb.\nEncourage reaching with the less-affected limb by reinforcing extension of this limb through the reaching aperture. When mice extend the less-affected limb in the first few days of training place a small (1/2 piece) of pasta onto the floor of the reaching chamber regardless of whether or not the reach is successful.\nCount only those reaches made with the less-affected limb toward to the 100 reach total. Do not count furtive attempts with the affected limb towards the total number of reaches.\nReturn the most medial vertical column of pasta to the matrix after the first 7 days of less-affected limb training.",
    "Record the number of reaches, number of successful reaches, and locations of successful reaches. NOTE: These data can be analyzed to observe differences in reaching patterns with the less-affected limb, but have not been previously reported.\n5. Reaching Analysis\nDetermine the impact of less-affected limb use on recovery of function of the affected limb by assessing the affected limb on the PMRT task following less-affected limb training. This assessment occurs after the desired number of less-affected limb training days are complete (typically 14 days).\nPlace the matrix in front of the chamber, oriented identically to training procedures (i.e., with the half of the matrix contralateral to the preferred limb filled). NOTE: This forces mice to reach with their affected (and previously preferred) limb.\nRecord the total number of reaches, number of successful reaches, and locations of successful reaches to compare with pre-stroke performance levels. Do not probe performance of the affected limb during less-affected limb training as these affected limb probes may function as training sessions that could impact recovery of the affected limb.\nSubscription Required.
