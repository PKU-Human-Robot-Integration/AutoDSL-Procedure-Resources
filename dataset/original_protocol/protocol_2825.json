    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmunization of hDPP4-KI mice with a sublethal dose of MERS-CoV\nTiming: 3 min/mouse\nIn this section, we describe intranasal (i.n.) immunization of hDPP4-KI mice with a sublethal dose of live MERS-CoV on day 0. The 3R (replacement, reduction, and refinement) principle needs to be followed in all animal experiment design. Intraperitoneal immunization with live virus may also induce humoral and cellular immune responses to MERS-CoV but will be less efficient in generating airway-resident immune memory in recipients. Manipulations of mice for immunization are similar to those used for mouse infection described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nImmunization with a sublethal dose of live MERS-CoV (Day -28).\nNote: All of the following procedures need to be caried out in a ABSL3 lab wearing PPE with institutional permission.\nDetermination of immunization dose.\nNote: The dose of MERS-CoV used to immunize mice should result in moderate morbidity without causing death of mice. Based on the outcome of MERS-CoV virulence test described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2], the optimal dose used to immunize mice shall lead to a 10–20% loss of initial weight. The peak of weight loss usually occurs during 7–10 dpi and mice may start to regain their weight, responsiveness, and activity from 10 dpi.\nNote: To avoid inter-batches variation, the same batch of virus should be used to determine viral virulence and for immunization. Virus sequence should be verified.\nNote: To avoid the loss of viral titer and virulence caused by repeated freezing and thawing, all virus remaining after each experiment will be inactivated and discarded.\nPreparation of hDPP4-KI mice.\nNote: Same as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nImmunization of hDPP4-KI mice.\nNote: Same as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].",
    "After returning mice to the original cages after they completely awake, monitor their weight and general condition 1–2 times per day. If humane endpoints (as described in Mers-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]) are reached, although unlikely with the sublethal infection, mice will be euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\nImmunization of hDPP4-KI mice with 2 doses of VRP-MERS-S\nTiming: 3 min/mouse\nIn this section, we describe i.n. immunization with 2 doses of VRP-MERS-S on day -70 and -42. Similarly, we highlight the important 3R considerations.\nImmunization with VRP-MERS-S can be carried out in a ABSL1 laboratory with institutional permission.)\nPreparation of hDPP4-KI mice is the same as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nImmunization of hDPP4-KI mice is the same as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2], except that 2 doses of VRP-MERS-S will be inoculated to hDPP4-KI mice, i.n., 25 μL /nostril, 50 μL total.\nNote: Different from sublethal MERS-CoV immunization, mice receiving VRP-MERS-S are NOT expected to show any significant abnormal signs (such as substantial weight loss, irritation, hunch, and respiratory distress) after immunization.\nImmune response assessment and virus challenge\nTiming: Day -28 to 42 post re-challenge with MERS-CoV\nIn this section, we describe the assessment of virus-specific humoral (neutralizing antibody-mediated) and cellular (CD4 and CD8 T cell-mediated) immune responses at multiple time points after immunization with a sublethal dose of live MERS-CoV or two doses of VRP-MERS-S. In vivo challenge of a lethal dose of MERS-CoV will also be executed to verify the protective efficacy of immunizations. As described above, we highlight the important 3R considerations. All animal manipulations are carried out following the protocol approved by IACUC.",
    "Determination of virus-specific neutralizing antibody in the serum of immunized mice (The following procedures may be carried out in ABSL3, or ABSL1 laboratory dependent on the immunization method. Nevertheless, PPE is needed for all manipulations.)\nCollection of serum samples.\nCheck the general condition (activity, responsiveness, healthy fur) of mice and anesthetize them in an isoflurane chamber (0.5 lpm (liters per min) oxygen and 2 lpm isoflurane).\nNote: it usually takes 5 min to obtain complete anesthesia.\nRemove anesthetized mice from the chamber and restrain them with the non-dominant hand by grasping the loose skin over the shoulders and behind the ears; the skin should be taut over the mandible.\nAfter cleaning the face skin with 70% EtOH pad, puncture the facial vein with a 25-gauge needle or a lancet slightly behind the mandible, but in front of the ear canal.\nNote: A swift lancing motion should be used to puncture the vessel. Only the tip of the needle should enter the vessel to a shallow depth of 1–2 mm. Blood will flow immediately.\nCollect sample with capillary tubes or pipettman tips. When the sample has been collected (0.2 mL), apply gentle pressure to the blood collection site with a sterile gauze sponge until bleeding has stopped.\nNote: If facial punch is not allowed, tail cutting can be an optional method to collect blood sample. The tail tips (2 mm) of mice will be cut with sterile scissors under complete anesthesia and blood obtained. The wound then needs to be tightly pressed to stop any active bleeding and sterilized with 70% EtOH. The wound needs to be monitored daily until complete healing occurs. If infection of the wound is observed, the animal needs to be treated with antibiotics or euthanized as per institutional guidelines.",
    "The animal may be returned to their home cage after completely awakening.\nNote: The recovery of mice from isoflurane anesthesia usually takes 2–3 min. To avoid irritation and stress of animals, manipulation needs to be swift and gentle. The procedure needs to be paused if the animal wakes up during the sample collection. Repeat the procedure to collect the sample from the vein on the other side of the face if necessary. At each time point, avoid repeated punctures at the same sites to reduce the risk of contamination. Sample collection will be carried out at a minimum interval of 2 days to allow wound healing.\nAfter the manipulation is finished, monitor the general condition and wound daily. An anti-inflammatory (meloxicam, 5 mg/kg, daily) or analgesic (buprenorphine SR, 0.5–1 mg/kg, every 48 h) treatment may be applied as necessary.\nTitration of serum virus-specific antibody (PRNT50 assay).\nPlace collected whole blood samples in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes at 25°C for 4 h, to separate serum by precipitation.\nCentrifuge samples at 4,500× g for 5 min. Transfer the supernatant (serum) into a new clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4,500× g for 5 min.\nTransfer the clarified serum into a new screw cap tube or aliquot serum into multiple tubes per need (0.2 mL whole blood usually generates 0.05 mL serum).\nNote: Store serum in a −80°C freezer. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing, which may impair the efficacy of antibody function.\nDilute serum with serum-free DMEM (we generally start our serial dilutions at a 1:10 dilution, which results in a final concentration of 1:20 after mixing with virus).\nMix diluted serum with MERS-CoV virus (diluted with serum-free DMEM at 400 PFU/mL) at a volume ratio of 1:1. Incubate the mixture in a 37°C incubator for 1 h.",
    "Remove the media from Vero 81 plates (prepared as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]) and rinse cells with pre-warmed 1× PBS.\nAfter removing PBS by aspiration, add the mixtures of serum and virus into plates at 0.2 mL/well and make triplicates for each mixture.\nNote: Always leave 1 column (3 wells) for positive control (mixture of virus with verified serum) and 2 columns for negative controls (virus alone and the mixture of virus with serum harvested from naive mice).\nReturn plates to the 37°C incubator for 1 h with gently shaking every 15 min.\nRemove the mixtures and rinse cells with pre-warmed 1× PBS.\nQuickly add prepared 0.6% DMEM agarose into plates, 0.5 mL/well.\nLeave the plates in the Biosafety cabinet at 25°C, until the agarose solidifies.\nAdd 0.5 mL D2 medium overlay to the agarose-DMEM in each well.\nReturn plates to the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 3, read plaques (visualized by Crystal violet staining like Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) as described in MERS-CoV propagation and titration[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\nThe titer of neutralizing antibody is calculated by regression analysis.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\nNote: The titration of samples to be examined usually starts at a 1:20 dilution to minimize their non-specific effects on virus replication. Serum titers <1:20 are regarded as non-virus specific or non-neutralizing.\nDetermination of virus-specific T cell responses in the lung and the spleen of immunized mice (The following procedures may be carried out in ABSL3 or ABSL1 lab dependent on the immunization methods. Nevertheless, the PPE will be needed for all manipulations.)\nCollection of lung and spleen samples.\nAnesthetize immunized mice with 100 mgkg-1/10 mgkg-1 Ketamine/Xylazine via i.p. injection in 0.2 mL volume using a 1 mL insulin syringe.",
    "Examine the responsiveness of animals by pinching the tail or limb to assess anesthesia and fix animals to the operation platform in a supine position.\nClean the abdominal skin with 70% EtOH pad and cut the skin open with scissors or scalpels to expose the subcutaneous tissue.\nLift the tissue with forceps and cut the thoracic and peritoneal cavity open with sterile scissors.\nNote: Pay attention not to puncture the heart and other organs.\nAfter bleeding by cardiac puncture, insert a 25-G needle into the right ventricle and perfuse with 10–20 mL cold 1× PBS.\nNote: The PBS should be administered under constant pressure slowly. High pressure may damage the normal structure of the lung.\nNote: The mice will die in minutes after thoracic cavity is opened due to the loss of negative pressure. Therefore, the perfusion needs to be carried out immediately after opening the thoracic cavity. A good perfusion results in inflated white lung lobes in healthy mice.\nRemove the lung and separate the lobes (total of 5), and the spleen with sterile scissors and plate the tissues in cold 1× PBS.\nHomogenization of lung and spleen samples.\nRinse lung lobes and spleen with cold 1× PBS.\nPlate a 70 μm cell strainer in a 6-well plate, then add 5 mL cold 1× PBS into the well.\nPlate spleen in the strainer and homogenize with the cap of a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube or the plunger of a 1 mL syringe.\nRemove the filtered cell suspension at the bottom of the well to a clean 15 mL tube.\nRinse the cell strainer with 5 mL cold 1× PBS and add PBS to cell suspension.",
    "Centrifuge the pooled samples at 300× g for 10 min, at 4°C and resuspend the pellets in Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) buffer (GIBCO, A10492-01) to remove red blood cells (RBC) (4°C, 5 min).\nCentrifuge cells at 300× g for 10 min, at 4°C, discard the supernatant and re- suspend the cell pellets with pre-warmed 10% FBS-RPMI, followed by cell counting under microscope.\nCut lung lobes into 2–5 mm3 pieces with sterile scissors and place in a 70 μm cell strainer. Insert the strainer in a 6-well plate and immerse lung pieces in 5 mL pre-warmed 3 mg/mL type III Collagenase (NC9405360) /5 μg/mL DNase I (LS006342) (Sigma Worthington) cocktail.\nLeave the plate in a 37°C incubator for 30 min.\nHomogenize the lung pieces in the cell strainer with the cap of a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube or the plunger of a 1 mL syringe.\nRemove the filtered cell suspension into a clean 15 mL tube. Rinse the strainer with 5 mL cold 1× PBS and pool wash with cells. Centrifuge at 300× g for 10 min at 4°C and remove RBC with ACK buffer, 5 min, at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 300× g for 10 min, at 4°C and discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellets with pre-warmed 10% FBS-RPMI, followed by cell counting using a microscope.\nDetermination of virus-specific T cell responses by in vitro peptides or peptide pools stimulation followed by flow cytometry assay.\nDilute single cell suspension of the lung and spleen with pre-warmed 10% FBS-RPMI at a concentration of 20×106/mL and plate into round-bottom 96-well plates, 0.1 mL/well.\nDissolve MERS-CoV peptides or peptide pools (MERS-CoV-specific immunodominant peptides are predicted using online programs and synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, 85% purity)21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).",
    "Note: The stock solutions should be prepared at a concentration of 10–100 mM and stored at a −80°C freezer (stable for 2 years).\nPrepare peptides or peptide pools working solutions immediately before use. Thaw 1 vial of stock solution at 25°C and dilute with 10% FBS-RPMI to a concentration of 4 μM.\nNote: The final concentration of DMSO in cell culture system should be no more than 1:1000.\nAdd 0.1 mL of working solution into each well pre-seeded with 0.1 mL of lung or spleen cells and gently mix by up and down with a 200 μl pipetman.\nPlace the 96-well plates in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, and culture for 6 h.\nTo block the secretion of induced cytokines, Brefeldin A (BFA) (Invitrogen, B6542) is added into the culture at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL for the final 4 hr of incubation.\nTo quantify cell numbers, CountBright™ Absolute Counting Beads (106 beads/ml, Invitrogen, C36950) are added into each well, 5–10 μl /well at the start of culture.\ncentrifuge plates at 300× g for 10 min at 4°C and remove the culture medium.
