  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California Davis. 3-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were used for the present study.\n1. Non-invasive ACL injury\nNOTE: ACL injury produced by an externally applied compressive load is a simple and reproducible method that closely recapitulates ACL injury conditions in humans. This protocol is written for a commercially available load frame instrument (see Table of Materials), but could be adapted for similar systems.\nOpen the software compatible with the load frame instrument (see Table of Materials) and select an existing control file or create a new file.\nTurn on the power of the actuator.\nIn the calibration menu, tare the force reading of the load cell and set the displacement of the actuator to 0.\nUse 1%-4% inhaled isoflurane in oxygen to anesthetize the mice and ensure the animals are fully anesthetized by toe pinch and/or tail pinch.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position on the platform. Position the lower leg vertically between two loading fixtures (Figure 1) (see Table of Materials). Fit the foot into the cutout of the top fixture and the knee in the cup of the bottom fixture.\nManually adjust the height of the bottom fixture to apply a preload of 1-2 N (monitored in real-time on the computer screen) and tighten the set screw to hold the position. The preload is necessary to hold the leg in the correct position prior to applying the injury load.\nApply a single compressive load to a target force (~12-15 N) or target displacement (~1.5-2.0 mm).",
    "NOTE: Applying the load at a slower loading rate (~1 mm/s) will provide a greater level of real-time monitoring and control but will likely result in an avulsion failure of the ACL. Applying a faster loading rate (~200 mm/s) will be more likely to produce a mid-substance ACL injury22.\n\t\nSet the loading rate in the software control file and confirm using the force-displacement data.\n\t\tNOTE: Bone fracture during tibial compression loading is typically not a concern since the fracture force (~20 N) is considerably higher than the ACL injury force. However, this should be monitored with palpation, and imaging (i.e., x-ray) can be used to confirm that no tibial fractures have occurred.\nInjury is typically indicated with a sound (\"click\" or \"crunch\") and a release of force that is identifiable on the force-displacement plots (Figure 1C). If a slower loading rate is used, stop the compressive load immediately after injury to prevent further loading and possible damage to other joint tissues.\n\tNOTE: ACL injury typically occurs at 8-15 N depending on body mass34. It is important to set a target force greater than the anticipated ACL injury force.\nConfirm the ACL injury using an anterior-posterior drawer test35,36 or comparable assessment of joint instability.\nAdminister an animal weight-dependent dose (0.1 mg/kg) of analgesic (buprenorphine, see Table of Materials) to mice post-injury.\n2. Animal preparation for FRI imaging",
    "NOTE: For optical imaging, animal fur (particularly dark fur) is highly effective at blocking, absorbing, and scattering light, therefore, fur must be removed as much as possible from the area around the knee joints before imaging. A depilatory cream is typically more effective for fur removal than clippers. Nude or hairless mice don't require fur removal. However, fur removal is necessary for most commonly used mouse strains (e.g., C57BL/6). If possible, feed mice with low-fluorescence purified food before imaging. Standard mouse chow contains chlorophyll, which auto-fluoresces with a wavelength of around 700 nm and may affect data collection from the near-infrared FRI system.\nAnesthetize mice with 1%-4% inhaled isoflurane in oxygen. Keep mice on a heating pad as much as possible and apply eye ointment to prevent irritation of the eyes.\nUse a cotton swab to apply depilatory cream (see Table of Materials) onto the anterior (cranial) aspect of the legs of the mice around the knee joint.\nLet the cream stand for ~1 min, then use wipes to remove the cream and fur from the leg. Repeat if necessary.\nOnce the knee joints are fully exposed without any fur covering the area, clean the legs with alcohol wipes to remove any remaining depilatory cream.\n\tNOTE: Depilatory cream can be used on the same mice multiple times throughout a study, but these applications should be at least one week apart to prevent unnecessary irritation of the skin.\n3. Preparation of the probe solution",
    "If necessary, dilute the fluorescence activatable probe according to the manufacturer's instructions in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). One vial of the commercially available probe (see Table of Materials) typically contains 20 nmol in 0.15 mL of 1x PBS. To dilute the solution in the vial, add 1.35 mL of 1x PBS to make 20 nmol in 1.5 mL of 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: After dilution, one vial can be used to image ten mice when injecting 0.15 mL per mouse.\nVortex the solution with a minimum speed (~2000 rpm) for 30 s to ensure that the probe is dissolved in solution, and then centrifuge briefly to ensure that all liquid is out of the lid.\n\t​NOTE: The solution can be stored at 2-8 °C in a location that is protected from light for up to 12 months.\n4. Retro-orbital injection\nNOTE: Refer to Yardeni et al. regarding the details of this procedure37.\nUse 1%-4% inhaled isoflurane in oxygen to anesthetize mice and place the mouse on its side with the snout in a nose cone.\nUse ~29 G insulin syringes for injection of probe solution (prepared in step 3).\nKeep the syringe covered before use to prevent exposure to light.\nWhen administering the injection:\n\t\nInject on the inside of the eye (lacrimal caruncula), and ensure that the bevel of the syringe is angled towards the eye. For right-handed people, it is recommended to inject into the right eye of the mouse with the animal facing right.\nWith the non-injecting hand, gently pull back the skin around the eye to stabilize the head and cause the eye to protrude.\nAngle the syringe parallel to the body of the mouse.\nGently advance the syringe past the eye until it meets rigid resistance; do not attempt to push past this point.",
    "Slowly inject the probe solution into the retro-orbital sinus, then slowly pull the needle out of the eye socket. If no solution comes out with the needle, the injection is successful.\nApply saline or eye ointment to the injected eye.\n\t\t​NOTE: Based on the documentation provided with the imaging probes, the optimal imaging time is typically between 1 and 2 days after injection of the probe solution. If possible, it is recommended to do an initial time screening to determine the optimal imaging time for each specific application. Mice will metabolize the injected probe within approximately 7 days, after which a new dose of probe solution will need to be injected if additional time points are desired.\n5. Fluorescence reflectance imaging\nNOTE: The procedures in this section are specific to a commercially available optical imaging system (see Table of Materials) . Similar imaging can be performed with comparable systems.\nAnesthetize mice with 1%-4% inhaled isoflurane in oxygen and place the animal supine in the imaging system with the snout in a nose cone.\nPosition the mouse with the lower legs extended so that the knees are pointed slightly in the air (it may be necessary to tape down the feet). It is critical that a consistent positioning is used for all animals.\nOpen the compatible software (see Table of Materials) on the imaging system computer; the \"Acquisition Control Panel\" will appear.\nTo warm up the system, click on Initialize and wait until the temperature light turns green.\nClick on Imaging Wizard, and ensure that the \"Imaging Wizard\" window will appear.\nClick on Filter Pair, and ensure the setting is on 'Epi-Illumination', then press Next.",
    "To select the correct excitation/emission settings, find the probe of interest from the pulldown list. If one can't find the correct probe, find the Name 'Input Ex/Em' and manually type in the value of Excitation Peak and Emission Peak based on the property of the probe that is to be used (e.g., for Excitation Peak, enter 675, and for Emission Peak, enter 720). Click on Next.\nChoose Mouse for \"Imaging Subject\". In \"Exposure Parameters\", ensure the Auto Settings is checked, and the Fluorescent and Photograph options are selected. Select D-22.6 cm in the checklist of \"Field of View\". Press Next.\nThe imaging setting can be seen and modified on the right panel of the \"Acquisition Control Panel\". Ensure all settings are correct, and press the Acquire Sequence button. After the image shows up, confirm that the image had adequate exposure. If not, change the exposure time setting and click on Acquire Sequence again.\nTo analyze the image, position a region of interest (ROI) circle with consistent size over each knee joint on the black and white image (this prevents biased positioning based on areas of fluorescent signal).\nCalculate total radiant efficiency and/or average radiant efficiency for each knee joint. If the radiant efficiency is also calculated on the contralateral legs, normalize the data by dividing the radiant efficiency measurement for the injured leg by the radiant efficiency measurement of the contralateral leg.",
    "NOTE: If a region of interest with consistent area is used for all knees, both total radiant efficiency and average radiant efficiency will yield similar results. Using average radiant efficiency is recommended if regions of interest with different sizes are used. Normalizing radiant efficiency data from the injured joint with the data from the uninjured contralateral knee will provide an internal control to account for any differences in the amount of probe injected and the delivery efficiency between different animals.\nSubscription Required.
