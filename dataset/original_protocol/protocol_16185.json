    "After choosing the desired cultivable bacterial and fungal strains for a DIY mock community (see Strategic Planning), it is important to verify the identity of each chosen strain once procured, as well as to have known and verified marker gene sequences of each strain if a targeted sequencing approach is used. This is what the user will do in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0001], via Sanger sequencing of gDNA previously extracted by users according to optimized protocols for their strains (Strategic Planning). DNA should be extracted from each culture and examined using agarose gel electrophoresis, to be sure that it is of sufficiently high quality and molecular weight for amplification and sequencing.\nHere, PCR with a high-fidelity polymerase will be used to amplify the appropriate target gene from genomic DNA. The PCR products are then cleaned using agarose gel extraction and submitted for Sanger sequencing to a genomics facility. When reads are returned, the forward and reverse reads of the target gene are merged using a sequence analysis program to identify their overlapping regions and build a consensus sequence. Agreement in the overlapping regions of the forward and reverse read allows greater confidence in the consensus. Using the curated consensus sequence and the NCBI BLAST algorithm (Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, & Lipman, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0001]), each strain is identified with respect to its nearest taxonomic relatives.\nMaterials\nNuclease-free water (Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Prepare a 1% (w/v) agarose gel using TBE buffer with DNA gel visualization stain (here, ethidium bromide) at a volume that matches the gel casting apparatus of choice, and let solidify with a sample comb.\nDetails on agarose gel electrophoresis can be found in Voytas (2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0030]).\nUse the widest sample combs possible.\n4. Once the gel has solidified, remove sample combs and fill gel electrophoresis apparatus with TBE buffer.\n5. Add a 1 Kb DNA ladder to one well of the agarose gel. Add all of the PCR product from each reaction to a different well of the agarose gel.\nThis may require the addition of a DNA loading dye if the PCR master mix does not contain a colored dye. For 40 µl of PCR product, add 8 µl of 6× loading dye.\n6. Run the gel with voltage and time parameters recommended by the manufacturer, and then visualize using ethidium bromide (Voytas, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0030]) or other DNA visualization stain to ensure that DNA bands are the correct size.",
    "For the 16S rRNA gene, and using the primers listed above, this band should be approximately 1500 bp long. For the full ITS gene, this should be approximately 400-600 bp long, but will vary by fungal species.\n7. While the gel is running, weigh and label 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, using one per sample. Pre-weigh each tube.\n8. After running the gel, and using a UV light box, excise each desired gel band using a razor blade and transfer to the appropriately labeled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nMinimize gel and personal exposure to UV light, and consider using long-wavelength UV light to protect the DNA.\n9. Weigh the gel slice inside the tube (subtracting previously recorded weight of tube alone) and add 4 volumes of Gel Dissolving Buffer (from the Monarch kit) to the gel slice.\nFor instance, use 400 µl of buffer per 100 µl or 100 mg agarose.\n10. Incubate the sample at between 37 and 55°C (typically 50ºC), vortexing periodically until the gel slice is completely dissolved (∼5-10 min).\nIf completing Sanger sequencing of other desired DNA and marker gene regions that may be longer than 8 kb, an additional 1.5 volumes of water should be added after the slice is dissolved, to mitigate the tighter binding of larger pieces (e.g., 100 µl gel slice, 400 µl Gel Dissolving Buffer, 150 µl water).\n11. Insert spin column into a collection tube (both from the Monarch kit) and load the sample onto the column. Spin for 1 min, then discard flowthrough.\n12. Re-insert spin column into collection tube.\n13. Add 200 µl of DNA Wash Buffer (from kit) and spin for 1 min.\nDiscarding flowthrough is optional.\n14. Repeat step 11.\n15. Transfer spin column to a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Ensure that the tip of the column does not touch the flowthrough. Re-spin for 1 min if needed.\n16. Add at least 6 µl of DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix.\nTypical elution volumes are 6-20 µl. Nuclease-free water may be used to elute DNA. Heating the elution buffer to 50°C prior to use may improve yield.\n17. Wait for 1 min, and then spin for 1 min to elute DNA.\nPerform Sanger sequencing\n18. Prepare DNA and submit for Sanger sequencing according to the sequencing center specifications.\nThis step will require quality checking of sample DNA. If using the recommended PCR protocol, an ample quantity of DNA will be available for DNA quality checks for and multiple replicates of Sanger sequencing. Each sample submitted for Sanger sequencing should only contain one primer, either the forward or reverse. We recommend multiple replicates for Sanger sequencing, at minimum six replicates per isolate, three in the forward direction and three in the reverse direction.\n19. Upon the return of Sanger sequencing data, find the consensus sequence of each read by combining the replicate reads in each direction, and then merging the forward and reverse reads using a tool such as the freely available FinchTV program (see Internet Resources).\nA read should be discarded when it has a quality score of less than 60%, and strains should be re-sequenced to obtain higher-quality data if necessary. Also check that there is no more than one marker gene sequence returned (aside from copy/sequence variants expected from the same genome), as this suggests contamination.\nSee Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-fig-0002] for images of consensus sequences. These were generated using the licensed software Geneious Prime, but open software is available and can be used as an alternative (Kearse et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0014]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/661e05e2-a96a-4db2-a9e7-a58ae98fa10d/cpz1533-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Example consensus sequence generation.\nUsing a sequence examination software such as FinchTV or Geneious Prime, users can combine multiple forward and reverse Sanger sequences to obtain a consensus sequence. Shown here is the creation of a consensus sequence for the 16S V4 rRNA marker gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using Geneious Prime to find a consensus sequence using three forward and three reverse Sanger sequences.\n20. Use a nucleotide sequence match (e.g., BLAST) in NCBI, the Ribosomal Database Project, SilVA, or other database to verify the identity of each strain based on the quality sequence returned (Quast et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0021]; Stoddard et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0027]).\nIf the strain is not found to be as expected, it is typically more efficient to start over with a “clean” stock (e.g., a pristine freezer stock or new strain order from ATCC) than to troubleshoot the source of contamination. Any strain or DNA derivatives used to generate the contaminated sequence should be promptly and fully discarded.\nSee Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-fig-0003] for images of NCBI BLAST results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/87a7061c-7783-48cd-a349-9c5eb4601825/cpz1533-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nNCBI BLAST table showing identity of P. aeruginosa.\nUsing the sample consensus sequence from Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-fig-0002], we can assign taxonomy to our strain of interest using the NCBI BLAST tool, which gives an output similar to that shown here. In the example shown, the identified strain is P. aeruginosa, with close relatives in the Pseudomonas genus.",
    "Once the included strains for a mock community have been chosen and verified (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0001]), an essential step is to create separate high-quality freezer stocks of each strain so that they can be re-grown and used to assemble fresh stocks of mock communities as needed. Freezer stocks contain glycerol and growth medium to preserve bacterial and fungal strains for long-term storage at −80ºC. In this protocol, users will take an aliquot of an overnight liquid culture of each strain and combine with glycerol (a cryoprotectant) for long-term freezer storage of multiple replicates of each mock community strain.\nMaterials\n50% (v/v) glycerol (J.T. Baker, cat. no. 2136-1), sterile, autoclaved\nOvernight liquid cultures of desired strains, ∼5 ml culture/strain\n1.5-ml externally threaded cryovials (VWR, cat. no. 10018-734)\nP1000 Micropipette and micropipette tips\n−80ºC Freezer\nFreezer boxes\n1.

Add 750 µl of an overnight strain culture into each labeled cryovial.\nEach cryovial should contain 750 µl of 50% (v/v) glycerol and 750 µl of overnight strain culture. Each microbial member should be aliquotted in a separate glycerol stock. One glycerol stock contains one microbial member.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 at least five times for each strain to create multiple glycerol stocks of each strain.\nThis is important, as you will want many glycerol stocks for contingency in case of contamination as well as for future use, to re-grow and assemble new mock community aliquots.\n5. Place glycerol stocks into a labeled freezer box, and place into a −80ºC freezer for long-term storage.\nUse Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0003] to assess the viability of strains during freezing with and without cryoprotectant.",
    "During storage of a fully assembled, whole-cell-based mock community, strains are stored as a combination of pelleted cells, including each community member at its desired concentration and without the addition of a cryoprotective agent. Cryoprotectants can interfere with downstream activities, and can be difficult to remove from stocks, so we elected to exclude a cryoprotectant from mock community stocks. Because of this exclusion, it is first necessary to ensure that the cells of each included strain are viable after freezing, to verify that the created mock community can be used as a valid lysis control for DNA extraction. Verification of viability after freezing is determined by pelleting each strain and plating on solid agar after subjecting it to a freeze-thaw cycle. If strains grow after freeze-thaw, at least some cells are viable after freezing in pelleted form.\nIn summary, as a positive extraction control, the mock community helps determine if all cells are lysed during DNA extraction to release their DNA. We recommend the use of viable strains in a mock community, as membrane integrity is compromised when microbial strains are not viable. If strains are not viable after freezer storage testing, additional cryoprotectant agents must be added for the mock community to be a valid positive control for reporting on the lysis efficiency of a DNA extraction.\nMaterials\nOvernight liquid culture of desired strains, ∼5 ml culture/strain\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-rec-0001]), ∼1 ml /strain\nSolid medium plates; two per strain\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes: one per strain\nCentrifuge with microcentrifuge tube rotor\n−80ºC Freezer\nVortex\nGlass beads (or glass spreader)\nIncubator(s)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for aseptic techniques in inoculating and transferring cultures (see Current Protocols article: Bykowski & Stevenson, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0007])\nFreezing\n1. Vortex the overnight culture of each strain.",
    "2. Add ∼1 ml of each strain from its overnight culture to a separate, labeled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n3. Centrifuge 10 min at 5000 × g, room temperature, and discard the supernatant.\n4. Resuspend with approximately 500 µl of sterile PBS.\n5. Centrifuge 10 min at 5000 × g, room temperature, to wash the medium from the cells.\n6. Discard the PBS supernatant and store pellets at −80ºC at least overnight.\nWhile freezer aliquots of a fully assembled mock community may be stored at −80ºC for weeks or months, the maximum time of storage has not been determined, but is expected to be several months.\nPost-freezer viability\n7. Thaw the frozen pellets from step 6.\n8. Rehydrate each pellet with 500 µl of sterile PBS.\n9. Vortex for 1 min, or until pellet has been disrupted.\n10. Inoculate up to 50 µl of the mixture on two separate replicates of the corresponding agar plate for each strain.\nSee Bykowski and Stevenson (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0007]) for detailed discussion of aseptic procedures including inoculation.\n11. Add glass beads and shake to evenly spread the liquid onto the agar plate.\nThis step can also be completed with a glass spreader or other plating technique.\n12. Incubate for 24-48 hr at each strain's preferred growth temperature to ensure cells are viable.\nLook for growth of each strain. We typically find lawn growth for each of our strains, even those hypothesized as slow growers.\nSee Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-fig-0004] for agar plates displaying growth after a freeze-thaw cycle.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6785582e-eae1-4a2d-a34a-bc0698b45f66/cpz1533-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nFreezer viability plate growth.",
    "After plating and incubating strains that have previously been frozen, there should be visible cell growth on each plate. Shown here are plated samples of strains that have been frozen without cryoprotectant after overnight incubation, with growth demonstrating cells are viable. Each column is a different strain in our mock community, with four different strains shown, with two replicates each.",
    "In each mock community aliquot, strains are normalized to a standard concentration, so that users can be aware of the exact input into the system or experimental techniques, and the expected output is then calculated. To do this, standard curves must be created to ensure that the concentration of each member is known and standardized in each community, so that the bias can be determined from the number of cells as input compared to the number of cell-equivalents observed as output from the marker gene analysis (after accounting for any multiple copies of the marker gene per strain). Because it is tedious to complete a dilution series and plate count each time for many different strains, we provide more efficient instructions to create standard curves for each member. These curves will be created by first completing serial two-fold dilutions of each strain and measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Then, a ten-fold dilution will be completed for each of the two-fold dilutions, and plated on solid agar. After overnight growth and incubation, colonies will be counted to determine the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) per ml of liquid culture for each stain. This is done in stationary phase, so that the chromosomes of each strain are not being duplicated. By using information on the copy number and unique copy number of a specific marker gene, it is possible to ultimately calculate the exact number of microbial cells per strain that have been lysed and that have released their DNA in the workflow. The standard curves are created by plotting the OD600 on the x axis and the colony-forming units (CFU)/ml on the y axis. A trendline and the associated equation should be added, and an r-squared value greater than 0.93 is sufficient to proceed.",
    "The linear equation should be recorded for future use when assembling new mock community aliquots. The CFU/ml may be averaged for replicates of the same dilution factor. After Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0004], users will have standard curves that can be used for mock community assembly, described in Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0005].",

Using aseptic technique and a pipette, take 1 volume of culture from each 1:101 tube and add it to a corresponding tube labeled 1:102, which should already contain 9 volumes of sterile liquid medium. Vortex or mix gently.\n10.

Using aseptic technique and a pipette, take 1 volume of culture from each 1:105 tube and add it to the corresponding tube labeled 1:106, which should already contain 9 volumes of sterile liquid medium.

Label six agar growth plates—two for each dilution factor—with the date, the strain, the medium, and the dilution (see Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-tbl-0003] for sample data and suggested plating based in the OD600 of the culture).\nDilution factors should be plated with the intention of obtaining 20-200 colonies on the agar plate after overnight growth. The specific dilution factor varies by strain, but generally, dilutions 1:104, 1:105, and 1:106 are recommended. See Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-tbl-0003] for guidance. These plate counts will be used to calculate the CFU/ml of culture and are graphed for the construction of the standard curve.",
    "15. Using aseptic technique, take 50 µl from the desired test tube for each dilution factor and add it to the correctly labeled plate.\n16. Repeat step 17 for each of the five remaining plates using the correct dilution tubes and plates, respectively.\n17. Add 5-10 glass beads to each plate and shake slowly from side to side, rotating plates every few seconds to spread the liquid completely on each plate.\n18. Remove glass beads and place them into a 10% (v/v) bleach solution.\n19. Seal agar plates using Parafilm and incubate for ∼24 hr at ideal growth temperature for the strain.\n20. Count and record the number of colony-forming units (CFU) on each plate after 24 hr.\nUse the following formula to count the CFU per ml of culture for each counted plate:\n         \nCFU/ml = CFU/volume of plated culture (ml) × dilution factor)\nExample calculation: count of 282 CFUs on the 10-4 dilution factor plate. A total of 50 µl of culture were plated.\nCFU/ml = (282)/(0.05 ml × 10-4) = 56,400,000 CFU/ml\nColony count can be used when the number of colonies per plate is between 30 and 300.\n21. For each dilution factor, plot the optical density against the average CFU/ml using Microsoft Excel or other graphing software.\n22. Add a linear trendline to the graph as well as the equation of the trendline. Make note of the equation of the trendline for use in Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0005].\nSee Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-fig-0005] and Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-tbl-0004] for an example of standard curve construction. Standard curve CFU/ml versus OD600 with high goodness of fit (r2 ≥ 0.93) is appropriate and can be used to calculate the desired bacterial/fungal cells concentration. If r2 < 0.93, it is necessary to repeat the protocol until an appropriate value is obtained.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf405cfa-608e-4c83-96a6-09cdd3c96056/cpz1533-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

The linear trend line and the associated equation and appropriate r2 value are also shown on the plot. This standard curve can be used during Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0005] for mock community assembly, because the r2 value is greater than or equal to 0.93.",
    "Mock communities can be constructed and assembled in new batches as needed, and each batch should be clearly identified with the date created in case batch contamination is discovered later. Every time the mock community is constructed, the concentration of each member must be known. To build the mock community each time, use glycerol stocks of each strain from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0002]. After strains have been freshly grown from their freezer stocks, they can be cultured using liquid medium overnight. The OD600 will be measured for each strain in liquid culture, and the number of cells in each liquid culture will be calculated using the linear trendline equations from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0004] for each member. This will allow for normalization of each member to a known and standardized concentration in each mock community aliquot. After each member has been normalized to a standard concentration, the growth medium will be washed from the cells of each strain, and then the individual microbial strains will be combined into the final aliquot. Please note that this generalized protocol creates ten mock communities at once. It is recommended to generate as many mock communities as required to complete sample processing of a focal study, and then to store them in a −80ºC freezer to ensure their ready availability. The assembly of many communities at once provides greater efficiency for construction and uniformity across sample processing batches within a study.\nMaterials\nFreezer stocks of each member of the full community, created during Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0002]\nSolid (agar) medium specific for each strain, ∼20-24 agar plates/strain (100 mm × 15 mm; VWR, cat. no. 25384-302), 2 plates/strain\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-rec-0001]), 40 ml PBS/strain/group of 10 communities\nShaking incubator with flask holder\n50-ml Erlenmeyer flask, one per strain\n50-ml conical tubes; (Corning cat. no. 430290)",

Using aseptic technique, streak each member on corresponding solid agar plates for single colonies and incubate overnight appropriately.\nWe recommend performing this step in duplicate to ensure that each strain has a single colony that can be used to inoculate a liquid overnight culture, and has not been contaminated.\nOvernight growth and normalizing cell concentration\n3. Prepare an overnight culture of each strain by taking a labeled 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of sterilized liquid medium and inoculating the medium using a sterilized loop (Bykowski & Stevenson, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-bib-0007]) with a single bacterial or fungal colony from the solid agar.\n4. Place the inoculated flask into a shaking incubator overnight with appropriate conditions for each strain.\n5. Use aseptic technique and a spectrophotometer to obtain and record optical density readings at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600).",
    "When retrieving each flask, look for turbidity in the culture to indicate that the bacterial or fungal strain has grown. Some strains may require longer than 24 hr of culture in order to obtain the recommended OD600 > 1.0. An OD of greater than or equal to 1.0 is usually appropriate for mock community construction, but this may change based on strain or spectrophotometer detection limits.\nBe sure to use the correct liquid medium to blank the spectrophotometer.\n6. Use the trendline equations from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.533#cpz1533-prot-0004] to evaluate each equation at the OD600 to find the number of cells in culture.\n7. Using the following equation, calculate the necessary amount of each culture for standardization and final assembly of the mock community:\nNecessary volume in ml = [(final solution volume in ml) × (final concentration in number of cells)]/(Overnight culture concentration in CFU/ml).\nThe necessary volume of culture is dependent on the desired final solution volume and final solution concentration. The necessary volume advises how much of the original culture should be added to the full community. A low final concentration of cells can be used for determining the detection limit of a technique, or to replicate a low-biomass system. A higher final concentration can be used to explore the efficacy and accuracy of DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing efforts. For our purposes, we recommend making several known community aliquots at once. The final solution volume should be the volume to be transferred into each mock community aliquot, multiplied by the number of mock communities being made. The authors recommend using 30 ml as a final solution volume so that 3 ml of each strain can be added to 10 mock community aliquots.
