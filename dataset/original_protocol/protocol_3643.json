    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nChemical plasmid transfection of DIV 19 cortical neurons\nTiming: 5 h\nTransfection of neurons with a fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid to label subcellular structures, i.e., dendrites, spines, and spinules, adapted from (Srivastava et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPrepare in advance the following media (See “Materials and equipment” for detailed recipe), pre-warm to 37°C in an H2O bath, and then pass through a 0.22 μm filter using a sterile syringe.\nNB transfection medium.\nOpti-MEM 1×.\nNB + supplements + 1× APV (feeding) medium.\nCritical: Transfection media must be free of antibiotics to prevent neuronal cell death.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, add 100 μL of Opti-MEM 1× to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and 50 μL of Opti-MEM 1× to a second tube (set of 2 tubes per imaging dish).\nForm the lipofectamine 2000 (LFA2K)-DNA complexes.\nAdd 7 μL of LFA2K to the first tube containing 100 μL of Opti-MEM 1×.\nAdd 4 μg of DNA per plasmid, i.e., p-mRuby-N1 or p-GFP, to the second tube containing 50 μL of Opti-MEM 1×.\nUsing a 200 μL pipette tip, transfer contents of the Opti-MEM + LFA2K tube to the plasmid DNA tube.\nPipette up and down steadily 30 times to mix LFA2K and plasmid DNA.\nTransport closed tubes to 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator, open the caps, and incubate for 20–30 min to facilitate LFA2K-DNA complex formation.\nTransfect dissociated cortical neuron cultures with fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid(s).\nUsing a 1 mL pipette tip, remove neuronal conditioned media, reserving it in a 15 mL conical tube, to be kept at 37°C for later use.\nGently add 1.75 mL of pre-warmed, antibiotic-free NB transfection media to the inside edge of a dish, taking care not to disrupt the neuronal network.",
    "Add contents of the Eppendorf tube, which now contains LFA2K-DNA complexes, to the dish drop-by-drop using a 1 mL pipette tip.\nGently mix by rocking the imaging dish up and down and then back and forth to evenly distribute DNA complexes. Do not swirl.\nIncubate imaging dishes in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3–4 h to enable sufficient uptake of complexes by neurons.\nReplace transfection media containing complexes with ½ conditioned media and ½ NB + supplements + 1× APV medium.\nPosition a glass pipette tip along the inside edge of the dish, carefully use suction to remove all transfection media without disrupting the neuronal network.\nAdd 1.5 mL of reserved, pre-warmed neuron-conditioned medium and 1 mL of NB + supplements + 1× APV medium.\nIncubate dishes in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for ~48 h to allow time for adequate fluorescent protein expression.\nPause Point: Allow ~48 h for adequate fluorescence protein expression in transfected neurons.",
    "Critical: The above protocol results in low transfection efficiency, with an average of 0.25 to 1 transfected cell per 20× ocular field of view. Sparce labeling enables the discernment of individual fluorescently labeled spines and spinules in medium to high density neuronal cultures. A high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the spines of transfected neurons is necessary to achieve enhanced resolution and visualization of fine structures, i.e., spinules, in subsequent steps. Optimal labeling of neurons by chemical transfection is dependent on the health of neurons, as well as the fluorescence labeling strategy. Suggested plasmids encoding fluorescence markers optimal for the live imaging of cortical dissociated neurons include p-GFP and p-mRuby-N1 to achieve green and red labeling, respectively. To increase neuron transfection efficiency of a particular plasmid in the case of low S/N, this protocol can be optimized. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: In addition to the fluorescent cell-filling plasmid, a second plasmid can be added to label a protein of interest or measure intracellular calcium transients in spinules. For example, spinules can be labeled by transfecting with p-mRuby-N1 (red) and endogenous PSD95 can be labeled with pCAG_PSD95.FingR-eGFP-CCR5TC (green). Similarly, to track spinule and local intracellular Ca2+ transients, neurons can be transfected with p-mRuby-N1 (red) and pGP-CMV-GCAMP6s (green).\nConfocal parameter optimization and live time-lapse imaging\nTiming: 4 h\nOptimized optical parameter set-up and live time-lapse confocal image acquisition",
    "This protocol describes the optimization of confocal parameters for enhanced resolution spinule imaging using a Nikon A1R HD microscope with resonant scanning and a GaAsP multi-detector unit with a Plan Apo Lambda 100× 1.45 NA oil objective, and 488/561 nm excitation lasers. Although we used a Nikon A1R HD laser scanning system, enhanced resolution via oversampling with a smaller pinhole and pixel size coupled with deconvolution can theoretically be achieved using any research grade point scanning confocal microscope, provided that the data can be collected with appropriate S/N, sample spacing, and proper deconvolution (Biggs, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The use of a piezo-electric positioner with nanometer resolution and repeatability is also critical for rapidly acquiring the high precision Z-stacks needed to track individual spinules. Our protocol is also generally applicable to imaging tissues, e.g., acute or organotypic mouse brain slice cultures, but the loss of signal associated with the imaging of deep optical tissue sections may limit the resolution benefit.\nEnvironmental chamber set-up for live imaging.\nStart microscope system according to standard protocol.\nTurn on the Tokai Hit stage top incubation system, using manufacturer-recommended settings to maintain a temperature of 37°C in the environmental chamber, and open 5% CO2 tank valve.\nNote: If your incubation system is not equipped with a gas mixer, a tank of premixed gas (5% CO2, 20% O2, Balance N2) may be used.\nCheck for water in humidifier.\nSwitch to the Plan Apo Lambda 100× 1.45 NA oil objective and attach the objective heat collar.\nAdd one drop of oil to 100× 1.45 NA objective.\nSwitch to the Plan Apo VC 20× 0.75 NA DIC N2 dry objective.\nAttach environmental chamber insert to the stage base.",
    "Securely mount the sample, a 35 mm dish (No. 1.5 Coverslip, 14 mm Glass Diameter) containing healthy transfected pyramidal excitatory neurons, onto the environmental chamber stage.\nFind the sample plane of focus at 20× magnification.\nSelect eye port for ocular viewing using an X-Cite 120 Fluorescence LED Illumination System with FITC filter cube. Other light sources, e.g., a mercury arc lamp, can be used as an alternative to LED illumination.\nScan the entire glass area for healthy, brightly fluorescing neurons and save each X/Y coordinate demarking a neuron’s location by navigating to the ND Acquisition tab and XY sub-tab (leave XY box unchecked) and checking box #1, #2, etc. under Point Name. (Pause Point)\nPause Point: Minutes. Assessment of neuron health prior to live imaging is critical as unhealthy spines can display dramatic changes resulting in irregular morphologies and potentially altered spinule formation. Avoid imaging cells with indications of plasma membrane blebbing and/or dendrite deterioration.\nSwitch to the 100× 1.45 NA objective and adjust focus. If more oil is needed, carefully remove environmental stage with the sample still securely attached to preserve X/Y positions.\nSelect Resonant scanning detector button.\nCritical: This protocol was optimized using resonant scanning mode. The use of a galvo scanning detector will result in higher S/N with less need for line averaging and better overall image quality, but the trade-off is reduced acquisition speed. Hence, resonant scanning is preferable for live time-lapse confocal imaging, while galvo scanning is optimal for fixed or single time-point live images.\nSelect a scan speed of ½ frame per s.\nAdjust the pinhole to 0.6 airy units.",
    "Select a pixel size of 1/2 Nyquist suggested sampling size. For the 100× 1.45 NA lens, we used the following 3D pixel dimensions: X= 0.06 μm, Y= 0.06 μm, Z=0.12 μm and a scan area of 1024 pixels (width) × 512 pixels (height).\nUse Scan or Capture mode to adjust field of view, centering on the secondary branches of apical neuronal dendrites, where mushroom spines are evident.\nAdjust the laser power, photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain (named as HV by the software), and offset for each channel to achieve optimal S/N for enhanced resolution spinule imaging in the sample. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: In general, high S/N is critical for optimal 3D deconvolution and confocal image resolution enhancement. Laser power and voltage gain values are chosen to balance S/N versus the effects of photo-bleaching and photo-toxicity. Indications of photo-toxicity include increasing membrane blebbing, particularly along dendritic processes, eventual fragmentation of neuronal processes, and cell death. The use of high laser power and low gain will result in an image with high S/N (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), but greater photo-damage than an image acquired with low laser power and high gain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), which displays significantly lower S/N. Noise can be minimized with line averaging, at the expense of acquisition speed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), which represents an example of acceptable S/N in practice. For optimal live time-lapse enhanced resolution imaging of fine structures, i.e., spinules and/or spine necks, the laser power should be set as low as possible to illuminate fine structures, while not causing observable photo-bleaching, using increased gain and 2×–8× line averaging to enhance S/N of the image.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/568-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Balancing laser power, gain, averaging, and noise is critical for time-lapse enhanced resolution spinule imaging",
    "Single Z-plane images depict a secondary apical dendrite and spines of a fixed GFP-expressing DIV 21 mouse pyramidal neuron acquired with a 100× 1.45 NA objective. The use of different optical settings highlights the necessary balance between laser power, voltage gain, and line averaging to achieve optimal S/N with minimal photo-toxicity and photo-bleaching at adequate acquisition speeds. The offset was held constant in all conditions and the images had comparable levels of intensity with these settings.\n(A) Upper: Imaging settings: Laser power (15%), gain (20), no averaging, and acquisition speed (65 ms/frame). Scale bar equals 10 microns. Lower: Line intensity profile (green arrow) shows an idealized S/N using high laser power, which would result in unacceptable amount of photo-toxicity and photo-bleaching for live time-lapse imaging. Scale bar equals 1 micron.\n(B) Upper: Image settings: Laser power (2%), gain (45), no averaging, and acquisition speed (65 ms/frame). Lower: Line intensity profile shows poor S/N, which is suboptimal for deconvolution.\n(C) Upper: Image settings: Laser power (2%), gain (45), 4× line averaging, and acquisition speed (260 ms/frame). Lower panel: Line intensity profile shows an acceptable S/N using a combination of low laser power, high gain, and averaging, which would result in negligible photo-effects at the modest expense of acquisition speed.\nSelect 2× to 4× line averaging, depending on the desired Z-interval, 2× for shorter intervals and 4× if longer intervals are preferred.\nIf imaging more than one channel, select Channel Series to minimize channel bleed-through, which will increase image acquisition time.",
    "For enhanced resolution, select a Z-step size of 0.1 μm. Set a Z-range that encompasses the entire dendrite, spines, and emerging spinules, typically from 3 to 8 μm. Add 1 or 2 additional Z-slices to the top and bottom of the range to account for possible drift during time-lapse imaging. The use of a piezoelectric Z-axis nanopositioner achieves the necessary high-speed and high-precision sampling in Z.\nSet duration of imaging and Z-interval in accordance with the aims of the experiment.\nFor tracking long-lived spinule dynamics, which exist for ≥60 s, we recommend acquiring at speeds of 15 to 30 s per stack for a minimum duration of 15 min and a maximum duration of 2 h.\nFor tracking short-lived spinules, which can exist from 2 s up to 60 s, we recommend acquiring at speeds of 2 to 5 s per stack for a minimum duration of 2.5 min and a maximum duration of 30 min.\nFor tracking both short and long-lived spinules, we recommend acquiring at ~10 s per stack for a minimum duration of 10 min and a maximum duration of 1 h.\nSelect Run.\nThree-dimensional confocal image deconvolution\nTiming: ~2 min per dataset (dependent on computer’s processer speed/Graphics Processing Units)\nThe use of iterative image restoration-based 3D deconvolution software, which can afford up to a 1.5 times improvement in XY and a 1.7 times improvement in Z (Holmes and Liu, 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Biggs, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) has been possible for decades in principle. However, the application of deconvolution has been limited until recently by computer processing speed. Nikon’s enhanced resolution software offers algorithms for deconvolving point-scanning confocal datasets in minutes, depending on the processing system’s Graphics Processing Units.\nOpen NIS Elements AR, i.e., Version 5.211, software.",
    "Navigate to File tab, select Open folder, and open a previously acquired NIS-Elements ND2 file to be deconvolved. Other file formats are not supported.\nNavigate to the Deconvolution tab and select 3D Deconvolution from the drop-down menu.\nUnder the General tab, select automatic from the Deconvolution Method drop-down menu. Other parameters, e.g., Modality, Magnification, Pinhole Size, NA, Immersion Ref. Index, Calibration, Z-step, should all auto-populate.\nFor the output, select create new document.\nUnder Channels, check the box for each channel to be deconvolved, e.g., 488, 568, 647.\nCritical: Deconvolution alters fluorescence intensity, precluding the use of deconvolved data for fluorescence intensity quantification. For example, if the researcher wants to quantitate intracellular Ca2+ in relation to spinules, they should deconvolve the red cell-fill channel, but not the green Ca2+ indicator channel.\nUnder the Advanced Settings tab, Preprocessing, verify that ‘do not subtract’ is already selected. Under Point Spread Function, verify that ‘Compute PSF automatically’ is already selected.\nClick the Deconvolve button to begin deconvolving. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nProcessing frame number pop-up window will appear and show progress as processing frame number.\nPerforming Deconvolution pop-up window will appear showing progress in processing as progress percentage.\nWhen processing is complete, navigate to the File menu and select Save As. If ‘show image window on save’ box is checked, an Image Properties pop-up window will appear. Select OK.\nNote: While our protocol has been optimized for the detection of fine spinule-like protrusions in live imaging data, 3D deconvolution can be utilized for ad hoc or post hoc analysis of spinules in fixed images. Additionally, deconvolution can be used for post hoc analysis of live imaging data acquired using standard confocal parameters, although the deconvolution benefit may be weaker than expected."
