    "NOTE: LCO synthesis has been performed in our labs for more than a decade. By essentially applying protocols for electrophilic aromatic substitution, palladium catalyzed cross-coupling, amide coupling, and ester hydrolysis, we synthetically customize probes for different purposes5,12. After synthesis, characterization, and purification, the LCO product is lyophilized and stored at room temperature. Some of the probes (among them hFTAA) are now commercially available (see Table of Materials).\n1. LCO Staining Solution\nNOTE: If hFTAA is purchased from a commercial vendor, please follow the vendor's instructions instead of section 1.\nResuspend the lyophilized hFTAA in 2 mM NaOH to prepare a stock solution of 1 mg/mL. Keep the stock in a glass vial at 4 °C. The stock can be stored for one year.\nOn the day of staining, prepare a working solution by diluting the stock 1:10,000 in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n2. Preparation of Tissue Samples\nNOTE: Many tissue types can be imaged using hFTAA as an amyloid marker. See Figure 1 for examples. hFTAA is sensitive to aggregate conformation. The staining should hence preferably be performed on undisrupted aggregates with no epitope exposure. Optimal spectral quality is achieved if the tissue fixation is kept to a minimum. Hence fresh frozen material, gently fixed in ethanol at the time of staining, is preferred. However, it is possible to detect amyloid deposits also in tissue that has been fixed with e.g., formalin. hFTAA generally penetrates the tissue well. Select a specimen thickness that is compatible with the intended imaging technique.\nIf formalin fixed, parafinembedded sections are used, deparafinize in xylene over night. Dip the sections in consecutive baths of 99% ethanol, 70% ethanol, dH2O, and PBS, 10 min in each. Allow the tissue sections to dry under ambient conditions.",
    "Caution: Xylene is always handled in a chemical fume hood. Xylene and other organic solvents are harmful.\n\t\nThaw cryosections in room temperature. Fix the tissue sections in 10% formalin overnight and rehydrate by dipping them in consecutive baths of 99% ethanol, 70% ethanol, dH2O, and PBS, 10 min in each. Allow the tissue sections to dry under ambient conditions.\nAdd droplets of the hFTAA working solution (approximately 200 µL) to the tissue sections to cover it. The droplet should stay in place by surface tension. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature for staining.\nRinse off the staining solution with 500 µL PBS using a pipette and then immerse the slide in the PBS bath for 10 min. Allow the section to dry under ambient conditions.\nMount using the fluorescence mounting medium. Allow mounting medium to settle overnight.\n\tNOTE: hFTAA staining can be performed in combination with other staining methods such as immunofluorescence, cell- or organelle specific markers, etc. To perform co-staining, run your complete staining protocol of choice and add hFTAA staining at the end, starting from step 2.2. See Figure 2 for examples. For immunofluorescence, preferably select a secondary antibody that is excited at 640 nm or higher. In this wavelength range, hFTAA does not absorb and hence cannot be excited and will not fluoresce. This ensures that no bleed-through is seen between hFTAA and antibody.\n3. Microscopy\nNOTE: Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with long pass filters. All settings below were used to generate the images in Figure 4. Adjustments may need to be made depending on the amyloid type and tissue sample. Although hFTAA bound to amyloid is stable towards bleaching, it is advisable to turn off the light source when the specimen is not examined or imaged.\nHIS",
    "NOTE: The experiment was performed using an epifluorescence microscope with long pass emission filters and a camera head for HIS (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nUse a standard fluorescence microscope equipped with long pass filters and a hyperspectral camera. Make sure that the spectral camera is calibrated.\nIn the software, name the project, select \"spectral image\" and start acquisition.\nSelect the object of interest through the ocular using the 436-nm excitation filter and shift the light path to the camera.\nIn the Case Data Manager (CDM), select the sample type Spectral, label the sample, and press acquire. The acquisition window will open.\nIn the acquisition window \"Spectral imaging\", open the settings menu, select acquisition properties, and set the spectral range to 460 - 700, the speed quality at maximum speed, and the measurement type at gas/laser/narrow filters. Close the dialog box.\nIn the image menu, select live full. In the icons bar, turn fringes off. Select or size a region to image that has the peak memory value below 800 MB. Set the exposure time to a value that gives a total image brightness between 1,000 and 3,000. In the icons bar, press the colored camera. Acquisition will start. When image acquisition is complete, press Save in the \"Acquire spectral image\" dialog box and \"New cell\" in the case data manager dialog box.\nFrom the CDM, open the collected image using the start analysis button. The data analysis window will open.\nSpectral information can be collected from each pixel of the image by selecting ROIs using the Spectral display dialog box. Choose \"define\" and select ROIs from the relevant areas of the image.",
    "Save the spectral data as a text file using the Lib button. The saved .txt file can be imported to any analysis software of choice. The .slb file can be used for analysis within the data analysis software. The hyperspectral cube data from the entire image can also be exported as a raw file, as \"layers as tif\", or as \"layers in text format\" for data and image analysis applications using external software.\nConfocal microscopy\n\tNOTE: The confocal microscope is equipped with a tunable laser as the excitation source. For all fluorescence emission experiments, set the laser intensity to 0.2% (corresponding to an average power of 3 µW), the pinhole to 1 airy unit, the frame size to 1,024 px x 1,024 px, the scan speed as 7 and averaging over 16 scans, and the bit depth as 8 bit (see Table of Materials). These settings need to be adjusted for each individual confocal system, laser source, and sample type.\n\t\nFor the emission spectrum, collect the data using lambda mode and the excitation using argon laser set to 488 nm. Collect emission between 503 and 687 nm using 22 channels in the 32 channel GASP detector. Set the gain to 755.\nTo achieve single channel images, use the smart set up option. For FITC (green filter), set the gain to 750 and for Alexa 535 (red filter) set the gain to 845.\nTo collect the excitation spectrum with the tunable laser, use excitation with 1 nm steps between 490 and 545 nm while collecting emission between 551 and 586 nm. Set the laser intensity to 2% (corresponding to an average power of 30 µW) and the gain to 774.",
    "To collect Z-stack in the spectral mode, scan through the depth of the section in steps of 0.96 µm. The same excitation and emission settings as in step 3.2.1 can be used but set the gain to 730.\nFLIM\n\tNOTE: The confocal microscope is equipped with a FLIM unit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nSet up the following parameters for the confocal microscope: Pinhole, 20; excitation wavelength, 490 nm; laser intensity, 0.5% (corresponding to an average power of 7.5 µW). Use pulsed lasers at 40 MHz.\nIn the FLIM software, set up photon counting over 550 nm. In the Display parameters window, follow the photon counting until the Max count is around 4,000 photon counts.\nSave the file and export it as SPC image.\nFit the data to a 2-component exponential decay in the FLIM software. A fit that gives a χ2 < 2 is good. The value on the y-axis is the number of counts for the given lifetime.\nSelect a threshold for counts to include, e.g., 100. Color code by T1 and select lifetime range. The decay is dependent on the amyloid structure where the hFTAA is bound. Fluorescence lifetimes between 300 and 1,000 ps have been observed. Save the file.\nExport the raw data by using the export options and save the desired data in a new folder."
