    "Ethics statement: The study was approval by the local ethics committee of the University of Munich (# 007-14).\nNote: An examination couch freely accessible on both sides and the foot end is required for non-weightbearing testing. A line (tape, approximately 2 meters) on the ground perpendicular the wall is needed for weightbearing testing. A standard goniometer with 2° increments and 20 cm length is used. We recommend documenting the results using a standardized fourfold table containing ADF measurement for the knee extended and flexed for each leg separately.\n1. Participant Preparation\nHave the subject take off their pants and remove their footwear.\nMark the axis of the fibula by drawing a line connecting the center of the distal fibula 5 cm and 15 cm above the tip of the fibula.\n2. Non-weightbearing Measurement (Figure 2A) \nHave two investigators perform the measurement, one conducting the test, the other measuring the degree of ankle dorsiflexion.\nPlace the subject in supine position on the examination couch. The examination couch must be freely accessible on both sides and the foot end.\nHave the first investigator place one hand at the level of the subtalar joint to ensure a neutral pronation-supination position of the rear foot and place the other hand around the midfoot. Thereby one hand stabilizes the talonavicular joint, while the other hand applies force on the plantar aspect of the forefoot to achieve maximum ankle dorsiflexion.\nHave the first investigator ensure that the knee is fully extended.\nHave the second investigator perform the measurement of the ankle dorsiflexion using a goniometer. Place one arm of the goniometer connecting the start and end point of the previously marked axis of the fibula. Align the other arm with the plantar aspect of the foot.\nNote the result on the documentation sheet.",
    "Have the first investigator ensure 90° of knee flexion by placing one hand on the distal dorsal aspect of the thigh while the other hand applies force on the plantar aspect of the forefoot to achieve maximum ankle dorsiflexion.\nHave the first investigator place one hand at the level of the subtalar joint to ensure a neutral pronation-supination position of the rear foot and place the other hand around the midfoot. Thereby one hand stabilizes the talonavicular joint and the other hand applies force on the plantar aspect of the forefoot to achieve maximum ankle dorsiflexion.\nHave the second investigator perform the measurement of the ankle dorsiflexion using a goniometer. Place one arm of the goniometer connecting the start and end point of the previously marked axis of the fibula. Align the other arm with the plantar aspect of the foot.\nNote the result on the documentation sheet.\nRepeat steps 2.1 through 2.10 for the contralateral side.\n3. Weightbearing Measurement (Figure 2B)\nHave one investigator perform the test.\nPlace the subject standing opposite a wall.\nHave the subject get into the lunge position with the leg to be measured being the rear leg.\nHave the investigator help the subject to place his/her rear foot centered on the previously marked line. Ensure that the heel and the second toe of the rear leg are centered on the line.\nHave the subject hold onto the wall in order to stabilize their stance.\nHave the subject fully extend their rear leg. Have the investigator ensure that the knee is fully extended. Be aware that even slight knee flexion significantly influences ankle dorsiflexion.\nHave the subject move their hip towards the wall until just before heel lift off of the rear leg. The front leg can be flexed as needed / as comfortable.",
    "Have the investigator place one hand on the dorsal aspect of the subtalar joint to ensure a neutral pronation-supination position of the rear foot.\nHave the investigator perform the measurement of ankle dorsiflexion with the other hand. Align one arm of the goniometer connecting the start and end point of the previously marked axis of the fibula. Place the other arm on the floor.\nNote the result on the documentation sheet.\nHave the subject get into the lunge position with the leg to be measured being the rear leg. Therefore have the patient move towards the wall until a comfortable position has been reached.\nHave the investigator help the subject to place his/her rear foot centered on the previously marked line. Ensure that the heel and the second toe of the rear leg are centered on the line.\nHave the subject hold onto the wall in order to stabilize their stance.\nHave the subject flex the rear leg as comfortable and move their hip towards the wall until just before heel lift off of the rear leg. The front leg can be flexed as needed / as comfortable.\nHave the investigator ensure that the rear knee is flexed at least 20 degrees. In case of doubt use the goniometer to ensure knee flexion greater than 19 degrees.\nHave the investigator place one hand on the dorsal aspect of the subtalar joint to ensure a neutral pronation-supination position of the rear foot.\nPerform the measurement of ankle dorsiflexion with the other hand. Align one arm of the goniometer connecting the start and end point of the previously marked axis of the fibula. Place the other arm on the floor.\nNote the result on the documentation sheet.\nRepeat steps 3.1 through 3.18 for the contralateral side.\n4. Data Analysis and Interpretation",
    "Ask the subject to identify the symptomatic side.\nReview the ADF data on the documentation sheet.\n\t\nFirst identify whether ADF with the knee extended is less than 10° on the symptomatic side. If so, consider MGT to be a possible cause. Then, compare ADF with the knee extended and flexed. If knee flexion results in a significant increase of ADF, MGT is present.\nIn case ADF is greater than 10°, compare ADF with the knee extended between both legs. If ADF is reduced on the symptomatic compared to the non-symptomatic side consider MGT to be a possible cause. If knee flexion on the symptomatic side results in a significant increase of ADF, MGT is present.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
