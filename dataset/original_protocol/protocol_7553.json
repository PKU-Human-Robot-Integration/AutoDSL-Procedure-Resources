    "The overall procedure is divided into several parts, with the fungal extracts first prepared (section A) and analyzed by the SIMBA method (sections C–F) and the data analyzed as described in the data analysis sections. For selected extracts showing antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity, the extracts are then fractionated (section B), followed by another round of SIMBA method (sections C–F) and data analysis.Obtaining cold water fungal extracts (CWFE) and their fractionation Cold water extraction of fruiting bodies of wild or cultivated fungi Collect and clean fresh fruiting bodies and store in a freezer at -20 °C (see Note 1).Thaw frozen fruiting bodies overnight at 4–8 °C.Place a beaker on ice.Wrap the thawed fungal sample in the viscose cloth and place inside the potato ricer.Press the potato ricer firmly over the beaker on ice and rotate the cloth with the sample several times to extract all the liquid that collects in the beaker below.Measure the volume of crude extract in the beaker.Add 1/20 of the volume of 20× PBS to obtain a concentration of 1× PBS in the extract and mix well.Transfer to a suitable centrifuge tube that has been chilled on ice (see Note 2).Centrifuge at 10,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material.Carefully transfer the supernatant to suitable centrifuge tubes (on ice) (see Note 3).Filter sterilize the supernatant, which is the cold water fungal extract (CWFE), using a 0.2 μm syringe filter.Store CWFE in aliquots in the freezer at -20 or -80 °C until analysis with SIMBA method (Note 4).Fractionation of CWFE with confirmed antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity (see Note 5) Thaw selected CWFE (with antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity confirmed by SIMBA method) on ice.",
    "Work with refrigeration (4–8 °C) either by using a refrigerated automated liquid chromatography system or in a cold room (see Note 6).Equilibrate the Sephacryl S-200 column in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 0.4 M NaCl.Load CWFE sample (at up to 2% of the total column volume) and elute in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.Collect 5 mL fractions and measure the absorbance at 280 nm (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4783/bioprotoc-13-15-4783-g001.jpgFigure 1. Examples of size-exclusion chromatograms of two different cold water fungal extracts (CWFEs) showing absorbance at 280 nm in fractions. The chromatogram of CWFE 1 shows better resolution than that of CWFE 2, where all proteins elute in a single peak. Fractions are subjected to the SIMBA method, and fractions showing antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity are then selected for further analysis or fractionation.Filter sterilize fractions using 0.2 μm syringe filters.Store fractions at 4–8 °C until analysis with SIMBA method (see Note 7).SIMBA method—Determination of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of CWFE and fractions of CWFE with confirmed antimicrobial and/or anti-biofilm activity Revival of S. Infantis Work aseptically.Remove a vial containing a permanent culture of S. Infantis ŽM9 from the ultra-low temperature freezer and place it on ice.Scrape off the frozen culture and transfer it to a TSA plate using a sterile loop.Incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.Preparation of the inoculum of S. Infantis Work aseptically.Prepare 5 mL of PBS in a 15 mL tube.With a cotton swab, add the biomass (of S. Infantis growth on plate) and vortex for 10 s.Add 1 mL of the bacterial suspension to a cuvette and measure the absorbance at 600 nm on the spectrophotometer. Use 1 mL of PBS as a blank.The measured absorbance should be 0.100 ± 0.010, which corresponds to (1–2.5) × 107 CFU/mL.",
    "If the measured value is lower than the target value, add more culture. If the measured value is higher than the target value, add PBS.Transfer 100 μL of the prepared bacterial suspension to 9.9 mL of 2× TSB.Use the prepared inoculum within 20 min of preparation.Setup of the microplate Work aseptically.Remove the CWFE/CWFE fraction sample from the freezer and place it on ice to thaw.Vortex the thawed CWFE/CWFE fraction for 10 s.Pipette the thawed CWFE/CWFE fraction into the wells of the microplate (see also Note 8).Transfer 100 μL of CWFE/CWFE fraction (row A, columns 1, 2, and 3 of the microplate schematic in Figure 2) if you want to test only a 50% concentration of the extract.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4783/bioprotoc-13-15-4783-g002.jpgFigure 2. Microplate preparation scheme before adding the prepared bacterial inoculum and 2× TSB Transfer 200 μL of CWFE/CWFE fraction (row A, columns 4, 5, and 6 of the microplate schematic in Figure 2) if you wish to test 50% concentrations and two-fold dilutions of the extract (see Note 9).i. Pipette 100 μL of PBS (rows B–H, columns 4, 5, and 6 of the microplate schematic in Figure 2).ii. Transfer 100 μL of CWFE/CWFE fraction from row A to row B and mix by pipetting. Continue these transfers to row H and discard the remaining 100 μL.Pipette 100 μL of PBS (rows B and C, columns 1, 2, and 3 of the microplate schematic in Figure 2) for positive (row B) and negative (row C) control.Pipette 100 μL of the prepared inoculum into all wells filled with CWFE/CWFE fraction or its dilutions.Pipette 100 μL of the prepared inoculum for positive control (row B, columns 1, 2, and 3).Pipette 100 μL of 2× TSB for the negative control (row C, columns 1, 2, and 3).",
    "Shake the prepared microplate on a microplate shaker at 600 rpm for 2 min.Absorbance measurement Set the microplate reader for kinetic measurement.Set the temperature to 37 °C.Set 61 kinetic intervals of 20 min, giving a total of 20 h of measurements.Set 5 s of continuous shaking at 600 rpm before measurement.Measure the absorbance at 600 nm.Insert the microplate when the temperature reaches 37 °C and start the kinetic measurements.Export the absorbance measurements to Excel."
