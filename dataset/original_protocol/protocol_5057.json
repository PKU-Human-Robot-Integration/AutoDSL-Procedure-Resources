    "Cultivate rice seedlings in full strength nutrient solution for 7 d. Afterwards, transplant 10 uniform seedlings to 1.5-L pots. After 6 d of treatments, discard the nutrient solution, and treat these rice seedlings with 0.5 mM CaCl2 (pH 5.5) overnight to collect the organic acids (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170213/20170213002307_4099.jpgFigure 1. The apparatus for collection of root exudatesAfter 12 h, collect and weigh the fresh roots of the treated rice seedlings. Pass the root exudates in the 0.5 mM CaCl2 solution through a cation exchange column (16 mm x 14 cm) that contained 5 g of Amerlite IR-120B resin (H+ form) and an anion exchange column filled with 1.5 g of Dowex 1 x 8 resin (100-200 mesh, formate form) (Figure 2). Overall, this process takes approximately about 5.5 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170213/20170213002452_5385.jpgFigure 2. The equipment for retention of the organic acidsElute the organic acid anions that were retained in the anion exchange resin immediately after the second step using 15 ml of 1 N HCl (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170213/20170213002544_8610.jpgFigure 3. The equipment for eluting the organic acidsThen, evaporate the eluent by using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C, a rotation speed of 120 rpm, and a vacuum pressure of 35 hPa (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170213/20170213002643_5015.jpgFigure 4. The equipment used in concentrating the organic acidsTerminate the evaporation process when the eluent solution has completely dried into powder (approximately 30 min later). Then re-dissolve the powder in 1 ml of distilled water and filter the solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter prior to analysis.Detect the organic acid anions by ion chromatography (ICS 3000; Dionex) equipped with an IonPac AS11 anion-exchange analytical column (4 x 250 mm) and a guard column (4 x 50 mm). The mobile phase is 1.2 g/L NaOH at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min.",
    "Generate a standard curve by using 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 80, and 100 mg/L of the organic acid (oxalate, malate, and citrate) stock solution.Calculate the organic acid efflux expressing it as a function of the root fresh weight. Notes: The recovery rate of organic acids must be > 80%. To calculate the recovery rate, at least two different concentrations of an organic acid (oxalate, malate, and citrate) stock solution were employed. For example, mix 20 μl or 100 μl 100 mg/L of organic acid stock solution with 1 L of distilled water, and repeat the procedure from 1 to 5 (theoretical concentration in distilled water is 2 or 10 μg/ml). Then, repeat step 6 of procedure and calculate the actual organic acids concentration. Finally, calculate the recovery rate using the following equation: Recovery rate = (Actual value/Theoretical value) x 100. To prepare the anion exchange resin, wash the anion exchange resin powder (500 g) in 1 L 4 N NaOH for about 30 min at room temperature. Repeat three times and wash with distilled water to neutral pH. Wash three more times in 1 L 2 M formic acid for about 30 min each and wash again with distilled water to neutral pH.  Similarly, wash the cation exchange resin (500 g) four times with 0.5 L 4 N NaOH about 1 h at 60 °C each, then rinse it with distilled water to a neutral pH, afterwards, wash it three times in 0.5 L 2 N HCl about 1 h each at room temperature, then rinse it with distilled water to a neutral pH.  The prepared resins can be stored at 4 °C for at least 1 year.This method can be easily adapted to other plant species such as Arabidopsis (Zhu et al., 2012).",
    "However, the secretion of organic acids is limited for some small plant species. In this case, the recovery rate can be relatively low, and thus the number of plants per pot must be scaled up in order to collect enough organic acids."
