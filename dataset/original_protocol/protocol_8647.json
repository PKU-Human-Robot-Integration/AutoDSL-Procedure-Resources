    "1. Study Animal\nRear individual Mecynorrhina torquata beetles (6 cm, 8 g) in separate plastic containers with wood pellet bedding.\nFeed each beetle a cup of sugar jelly (12 ml) every 3 days.\nKeep the temperature and humidity of the rearing room at 25 °C and 60%, respectively.\nTest the flight capability of each beetle before implanting thin wire electrodes.\n\t\nGently throw a beetle into the air. If the beetle can fly for longer than 10 sec for 5 consecutive trials, conclude that the beetle has regular flight capabilities and employ it for subsequent flight experiments. To recapture the beetle, switch off all the lights in the room to make it dark. This causes the beetle to terminate flight.\n\t\tNote: A beetle spontaneously begins to fly away when released into the air. It is better to conduct the flight experiments in a large closed room such as the one shown in Figure 1 (16 x 8 x 4 m3 with a motion capture space of 12.5 x 8 x 4 m3), as a flying beetle moves very fast (approximately 3-5 m/sec) and draws large arcs when turning in the air.\n2. Electrode Implantation\nAnesthetize the beetle by placing it in a plastic container filled with CO2 for 1 min13,16,20-24.\nSoften dental wax by dipping it in hot water for 10 sec. Place the anesthetized beetle on a wooden block and immobilize it with the softened dental wax. The dental wax naturally cools and solidifies within a few minutes.\nCut insulated silver wires (127 µm bare diameter, 178 µm diameter when coated with perfluoroalkoxy) into lengths of 25 mm to use as thin wire electrodes for implantation.\nExpose 3 mm of bare silver by flaming the insulator at both ends of each wire.",
    "Dissect the top surface of the beetle's cuticle using a fine-tipped scissor to create a small window of approximately 4 x 4 mm on the metepisternum (Figure 2c). Note: A soft brown-colored cuticle is then exposed, as shown in Figures 2c-e. The 3Ax muscle is located underneath the soft cuticle.\nPierce two holes on the exposed brown cuticle using an insect pin (size 00) with a distance of 2 mm between the two holes (Figure 2d).\nInsert two wire electrodes (including one active and one return electrodes prepared in step 2.4) carefully through the holes and implant them into each 3Ax muscle at a depth of 3 mm.\nSecure the implanted electrodes and hold them in place to avoid contact and short-circuits by dropping melted beeswax on the holes. If needed, reflow the beeswax over the cuticle by touching the beeswax with the tip of a hot soldering iron. The beeswax quickly solidifies and reinforces the implantation.\n\tNote: To check if the implantation is correct, the elytra of the beetle can be lifted to observe the movement of the 3Ax muscle during electrical stimulation.\n3. Wireless Backpack Assembly\nNote: The backpack consisted of a built-in radio microcontroller on a 4 layered FR-4 board (1.6 x 1.6 cm2). The backpack was driven by a lithium polymer microbattery (3.7 V, 350 mg, 10 mAh). The total mass of the backpack including the battery was 1.2 ± 0.26 g which is less than the payload capacity of the beetle (30% of 10 g body weight). The backpack was pre-programmed to receive wireless communications and had two output channels.\nClean the pronotum surface (remove the wax layer on the cuticle) using double-sided tape. Then, attach the backpack on the pronotum of the beetle with a piece of double-sided tape.",
    "Connect the ends of the implanted electrodes to the outputs of the backpack.\nWrap retro-reflective tape around the microbattery to produce a marker for motion capture cameras to detect.\nAttach the microbattery to the top of the backpack using a piece of double-sided tape so that the retro-reflective tape can be detected by motion capture cameras.\n4. Wireless Control System\nNote: In this case, the term wireless control system includes a receiver for the remote controller, a laptop computer to run the custom flight control software, a base station, the backpack, and the motion capture system.\nConnect the base station and receiver of the remote controller to the laptop computer via USB ports.\nSwitch on the motion capture system and connect it to the laptop computer via an Ethernet port.\nPerform volume calibration by waving the calibration wand (provided by the vendor company of the motion capture system) to fully cover the motion capture space.\n\t\nOpen the motion capture software from the desktop of the laptop. Click and drag to select all the cameras on the \"System\" menu of the \"Resources\" panel.\nClick on the \"3D Perspective\" menu and select \"Camera\" to change to the camera view. Click on the \"Camera\" tab on the \"Tools\" panel to show the calibration setup. Click \"Start\" on the \"Create Camera Masks\" menu to eliminate noise from the cameras and then \"Stop\" after the noise is masked in blue.\nClick and select \"5 Marker Wand & L-Frame\" from the \"Wand\" menu and the \"L-Frame\" menu on the \"Camera\" tab. Set the \"Wand Count\" to 2,500, click \"Start\" on the \"Calibrate Cameras\" menu, and wave the calibration wand through the entire motion capture space. The calibration process stops when the wand count reaches 2,500.",
    "Repeat the calibration process if image error (at the bottom of the \"Camera\" tab of the \"Tools\" panel) is higher than 0.3 for any camera. After calibrating, put the wand on the floor in the middle of the motion capture space and click \"Start\" on the \"Set Volume Origin\" menu to set the origin of the motion capture space.\nCheck the coverage of the motion capture system using a dummy test to record the motion path of a marker waved by a user in the motion capture space and confirm whether the marker is detected and tracked. If the marker is frequently lost during detection, repeat volume calibration until the dummy test succeeds.\n\t\nClick on the \"Capture\" tab on the \"Tools\" panel and then \"Start\" on the \"Capture\" menu before waving the sample marker through the entire motion capture space to record its trajectory.\nAfter recording, click on \"Runs the Reconstruct pipeline\" to reconstruct the positions of the marker and check the quality of the recording.\nConnect the terminals of the microbattery (attached to the backpack in step 3.4) to the power pins of the backpack.\nTest the wireless communication between the laptop and the backpack using the custom flight control software. Click the \"Start\" command on the software and check the displayed connection status.\n5. Free Flight Experiment\nCarry out the free flight experiment in a flight arena measuring 16 x 8 x 4 m3.\nInput the appropriate parameters to the flight control software (voltage, pulse width, frequency, and stimulation duration). Note: For demonstration, we fixed the voltage to 3 V, pulse width to 3 msec, and stimulation duration to 1 sec and varied the frequency from 60 to 100 Hz.",
    "On the software screen, type 3 for 3 V in the \"Voltage\" box, 1,000 for 1,000 msec in the \"Stimulation Duration\" box, 3 for 3 ms in the \"Pulse Width\" box, and a desired frequency in Hz in the \"Frequency\" box on the command window.\nRelease the backpack-mounted beetle into the air allowing it to fly freely within the flight arena. Manually trigger the stimulation when the beetle enters the motion capture space. Press the appropriate command button (Left or Right) on the remote to stimulate the target muscle on the left or right side of the beetle.\n\tNote: Once the button is pressed, the flight control software running on the laptop generates the command and sends it to the backpack. The backpack then outputs the electrical stimulus to the muscle of interest (on the left or right side).\nObserve the beetle's reaction in real time during the stimulation and reconstruct the data using 3D graphing software.\n\t\nSelect one of the trials recorded in the data list of the \"Beetle Display\" window and click \"Export Panda\" to copy the data of that trial to the analysis folder and run the 3D graphing module.\nPress \"N\" on the keyboard to combine the stimulus signal with the recorded trajectory. Press I to show the trajectory of the beetle with the highlighted stimulation periods.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
