    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmunofluorescence in L929 cells\nTiming: 4 days\nSoak NEST Scientific cover glasses in chromic acid overnight and rinse them with fresh water on the next day. Washed cover glasses can be kept in 75% ethanol for a long period of time.\nUsing forceps, dip a single cover glass into 95%–100% ethanol. Blot off excess ethanol and then wave the cover glass through a flame. When flame extinguishes and no more ethanol remains, drop the now-sterile cover glass into one well of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 500 μL of PBS to each well of the plate (cover glass should be totally immersed in the solution), and incubate the plate in a 37°C incubator for a minimum of 30 min to degas.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μL of 0.1% Gelatin Solution to each well of the plate. Incubate the plate in a 37°C incubator for 10 min and then wash once with 500 μL of PBS.\nSeed 5 × 105 L929 cells in each well and leave the plate in a 37°C incubator overnight.\nOn the next day, replace the medium with fresh medium containing TNF (20 ng/mL) and Z-VAD (20 μM).\nAt each indicated time point (0, 2, or 3-h post treatment), aspirate the medium and wash each well once with 500 μL of PBS.\nAdd 500 μL of 4% PFA to each well and incubate at room temperature (25°C) for 15 min to fix the cell. Wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 500 μL of 0.25% TritonX-100 to each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 500 μL of 5% BSA to each well and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.",
    "On a Parafilm in a light-protective black western blot incubation box, for each sample, add 50 μL of 2.7 μg/mL phospho-RIPK3 antibody in 5% BSA.\nNote: Please pay attention that we use final concentrations for antibodies instead of dilutions in this protocol.\nTake the cover glasses out of the 12-well plate using a syringe needle bent at the tip and a tweezer and then place the cover glass face down on the antibody droplet. Incubate at 4°C overnight (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. How to take the cover glasses out of a 12-well plate, relevant to step 12 in the section of “Immunofluorescence in L929 cells”\nCritical: When lifting the cover glasses, be careful not to scratch the cells and not to reverse the sides of the cover glasses. Place a 35-mm dish of PBS in the incubation box to ensure a moist condition if needed.\nPlace the cover glasses back into the 12-well plate, face up, and wash with 500 μL of PBS three times for 5 min each.\nPrepare the staining solution: 5% BSA added with 1:200 Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 568 Antibody and 1 μg/mL Hoechst.\nChange Parafilm in the black incubation box and add 50 μL of the staining solution onto the new Parafilm for each sample, place the cover glasses face down onto the antibody droplet and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.\nPlace the cover glasses back into the 12-well plate, face up, and wash with 500 μL of PBS three times for 5 min each.",
    "Add 9 μL of ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent onto CITOGLAS slides and carefully place the cover glasses face down onto the droplets. Use nail polish to seal the rim of the cover glasses and place the slides in a light-protective slide holder to dry overnight at room temperature.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles formed during this process. Seal the rim of the cover glasses completely using nail polish to prevent any leak.\nUse Zeiss LSM 880+Airyscan laser-scanning confocal microscope to acquire images. At the channel list, select Alexa Fluor 568 for phospho-RIPK3 and Hoechst 33342 for Hoechst, and also take a bright-field image to show the overall morphology of the cells.\nCritical: Signals of phospho-RIPK3 exist in necrotic cells, hence, find necrotic cells first by morphology and then you will find phospho-RIPK3 signals easily (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nImmunofluorescence in yolk sacs\nTiming: 14 days\nPrepare the mice for timed mating: house 3- to 4-month-old Casp8+/− males individually for 1–2 weeks prior to mating. Group house 8- to 15-week-old Casp8+/− females for 10–14 days prior to mating and expose them to soiled bedding from a male’s cage 2 days before mating.\nTimed-mating: add 1–2 female(s) in estrus into each stud male’s cage at 9:00 PM. Examine females for vaginal plugs and separate them from male mice at 9:00 AM the next morning. Set the morning when a vaginal plug is found as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\nAt 9:00 AM in the morning of E10.5, euthanize pregnant females via CO2 exposure for at least 5 min until no breathing is observed.\nEnsure death by performing a toe pinch. Perform cervical dislocation as a secondary method of euthanasia.\nNote: Yolk sacs should be collected before the Casp8−/− embryos are resorbed.\nIsolate embryos and separate the yolk sac from the embryo proper.",
    "Mount yolk sacs on adhesion microscope slides. Allow the slides to dry at room temperature for 20 min.\nUse a Super PAP Pen to draw a circle around the yolk sac on the slides to confine the flow of reagents added later to the defined area.\nNote: It is critical to use adhesion microscope slides.\nFix the yolk sacs by adding 50 μL of 4% PFA in PBS for 4 h at 4°C (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nAspirate 4% PFA, permeabilize the cells by adding 50 μL of the permeabilization buffer and incubating at room temperature for 45 min.\nDiscard the permeabilization buffer, add 50 μL of the blocking solution containing 2% goat serum in PBS, and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nAspirate the blocking solution, add 50 μL of the primary antibody cocktail (blocking solution added with 0.78 μg/mL rat anti-PECAM antibody and 2.7 μg/mL mouse anti-phospho-RIPK3 antibody), and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nWash the slides with 50 mL of PBS three times for 5 min each and then incubate for 1 h in the dark at room temperature with 50 μL of the secondary antibody cocktail (blocking solution containing 1:200 diluted Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat antibody and 1:200 diluted Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody).\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution, add 50 μL of 1 μg/mL Hoechst in PBS, incubate for 1 min at room temperature in the dark, and then wash the slides with 50 mL of PBS three times for 5 min each.\nAdd 9 μL of ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent onto the yolk sac on the slide and carefully place one cover glass onto the droplet. Use nail polish to seal the rim of the cover glass and place the slide in a light-protective slide holder to dry overnight at room temperature.",
    "Use Zeiss LSM 880+Airyscan laser-scanning confocal microscope to acquire images. At the channel list, select Alexa Fluor 488 for phospho-RIPK3, Alexa Fluor 594 for PECAM, and Hoechst 33342 for Hoechst.\nTNF injection, tamoxifen treatment, tissue collection, fixation, and sectioning\nTiming: 5 or 7 days\nDetailed protocol for TNF injection and cecum collection has been described elsewhere (He et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Briefly,\ninject the mice intravenously with murine TNFα 300 μg per kg body weight (μg/kg) prepared in endotoxin-free saline.\nharvest ceca at 8-h post-injection and fix them in 4% PFA overnight (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nclean feces after fixation. For the collection of small intestines,\ntreat the Setdb1fl/fl mice and the Setdb1fl/fl Vil-CreERT2 mice with one dose of 400 mg/kg tamoxifen by gavage,\ncollect small intestines at day 4 post tamoxifen injection,\nclean the feces, roll the small intestine up, and fix the tissues in 4% PFA (this can be any other mouse models with small intestine injury and inflammation).\nTransfer the cecum and small intestine samples to the semi-enclosed benchtop tissue processor for dehydration: sequentially incubate them.\nin 50%, 70%, and 80% ethanol in water (v/v) for 25 min,\nin 95% ethanol in water (v/v) twice for 15 min each,\nin 100% ethanol twice for 30 min each,\nin ethanol and xylene mixture (1:1 v/v) for 30 min,\nin xylene twice for 20 min each.\nFinally, incubate them in paraplast tissue embedding medium twice at 60°C for 1.5 h each.\nTransfer the infiltrated tissues into the embedding workstation (working temperature: 60°C) and embed them with an appropriately sized embedding mold.\nTrim the tissue-embedding paraffin blocks and section the tissues at a thickness of 5 μm on an RM2016 microtome.",
    "Float the tissue sections in a tissue section flotation bath and use CITOGLAS slides to pick the tissue sections from the water bath.\nDry the slides on a 42°C slide drier and then in a 56°C oven. For details of sectioning, please refer to (He et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nDeparaffinization and immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nDeparaffinization:\nincubate the slides in xylene for 10 min,\nrepeat the xylene incubation twice,\nmove on to 100% ethanol for 10 min,\nrepeat the 100% ethanol incubation once,\nand then proceed to 90% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\n80% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\n70% ethanol in water (v/v) for 5 min,\nand wash the slides in ddH2O for 5 min three times.\nNote: Xylene and neutral balsam (which is dissolved in xylene and will be used later) should always be used with adequate ventilation, preferably in a fume hood. Eye and skin exposure should be avoided. Follow the chemical safety data sheet when handling these reagents.\nAntigen retrieval: put slides in a pressure cooker containing antigen retrieval buffer and make sure the buffer covers the whole tissue. Place the pressure cooker on an induction stove and heat it at 1800 W. Let the cooker vent for 1.5 min and then turn the stove off. Allow the cooker to cool down to room temperature.\nAfter antigen retrieval, use a Super PAP Pen to draw a circle around the tissue so that all reagents and antibodies except the washing solution will be added to area within the circle.\nWash the slides in wash buffer on a shaker at 55 rpm for 5 min, repeat the washing step twice, and incubate the slides in BLOXALL Blocking Solution at room temperature for 10 min.",
    "Wash the slides using washing solution on a shaker for 5 min at 55 rpm three times, add 50 μL of 2.5% horse serum to the tissue within the circle, and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nRemove excessive serum from the slides and add 50 μL of phospho-RIPK3 (T231 + S232) antibody in 2.5% horse serum (6.75 μg/mL for ceca and 1.35 μg/mL for small intestines). Put the slides into a slide rack and incubate at 4°C for 12 h.\nNote: Put a small dish of water inside the slide rack so that the slides will not dry out.\nAfter the phospho-RIPK3 antibody incubation, place the slide rack on the benchtop for about 30 min to warm to room temperature.\nWash the slides using wash buffer on a shaker at 55 rpm for 5 min. Repeat the wash step twice. Incubate the slides with 50 μL of biotinylated horse anti-mouse/rabbit IgG secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the slides using wash buffer on a shaker at 55 rpm for 5 min. Repeat the wash step twice. Incubate with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Reagent at room temperature for 30 min.\nAfter three washes using wash buffer on a shaker at 55 rpm for 5 min each, 1:1 mix the ImmPACT DAB EqV solutions as instructed by the manufacturer and incubate the slides until appropriate stain intensity develops.\nUse ddH2O to wash the slides 3 times, and wash for 5 min each time on a shaker at 55 rpm at room temperature.\nCounterstain the slides with 50 μL of Hematoxylin for 1.5 min at room temperature.\nAfter 3 washes with ddH2O for 10 s per wash, incubate the slides in 0.08% ammonia for 6 s and then wash 3 times with ddH2O for 10 s per wash.",
    "Dehydrate the slides with 80% ethanol in water (v/v) for 1 min, 90% ethanol for 1 min, 100% ethanol for 1 min twice, and 100% xylene for 1 min twice.\nAdd the permanent mounting medium neutral balsam to the sections, cover the sections with cover glasses, and press gently to get rid of any bubbles.\nNote: Bubbles can easily form during this process. You can add neutral balsam onto the tissue, let one side of the cover glass touch the droplet first, and then slowly put the other side down to get rid of the bubble.\nLet the slides dry in a fume hood at room temperature for 12 h.\nPause point: These slides can be stored permanently at room temperature.\nUse Leica DM4B to capture the images and analyze the data."
