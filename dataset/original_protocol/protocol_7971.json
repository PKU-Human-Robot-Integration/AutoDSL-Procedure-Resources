    "NOTE: All animals were cared for in accordance with the guidelines set by the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Phox2b-Cre mice (MMRRC strain 034613-UCD, NP91Gsat/Mmcd) or TrkBCreER mice (Ntrk2tm3.1(cre/ERT2)Ddg) were bred with tdTomato reporter mice (Ai14). AdvillinCreER47 were bred with Phox2b-flpo48 and Ai65. For 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) injections, the EdU was prepared and doses calculated according to Perea-Martinez et al.49.\n1. Preparation of materials\nPreparation of solutions\n\t\nDissolve 5.244 g of monobasic sodium phosphate and 23.004 g of dibasic sodium phosphate in double-distilled water (ddH2O) on a stir plate. Adjust the pH to 7.4, and bring the total volume to obtain 1 L of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (PB).\nDissolve paraformaldehyde in ddH2O in a fume hood by heating while stirring on a stir plate until the solution reaches 90 °C. Add 4 M NaOH solution dropwise to clear the paraformaldehyde, and filter the solution using a vacuum Erlenmeyer flask and ceramic filter with filter paper. Add an equal volume of 0.2 M PB, and adjust the pH to 7.4 to obtain 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB.\n2. Tissue preparation\nTissue collection\nSacrifice mice using an anesthetic overdose with a working solution containing 10 mL of sterile saline and 0.25 mL of a stock solution containing 5 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and 5 mL of tert-amyl alcohol. Perfuse transcardially with 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB; remove the tongues and the palate.\nIsolate the circumvallate taste buds using a coronal cut separating the posterior tongue, behind the intermolar eminence; cut off the taste buds with a razorblade; and then bisect the anterior tongue at the midline. Post-fix overnight at 4 °C with 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB.",
    "Cryoprotect the tissue in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: The tissue can be frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound using 2-methylbutane chilled in a beaker on dry ice and stored at -80 °C if the procedure has to be paused here.\nFungiform taste buds\n\t\nChill 2-methylbutane in a beaker on dry ice in preparation for step 2.2.8.\nThaw and rinse the tongue in 0.1 M PB. Place one half of the anterior tongue containing the fungiform papillae on a glass slide under a dissecting microscope.\nUse blunt-ended forceps and dissection scissors to remove the muscle. Use blunt-ended forceps to hold the tissue open as the lingual epithelium is curved, and ensure a flat orientation by keeping the blades of the coarse dissection scissors parallel to the epithelium.\nDiscard the ventral non-keratinized epithelium of the tongue as it contains no taste buds.\nUse fine dissection scissors for closer dissection to the underside of the keratinized epithelium.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important to dissect close to the epithelium so that the remaining muscle is of uniform thickness, and the surface is smooth to ensure uniform antibody penetration. The consequence of non-uniform thickness of the remaining muscle will be uneven sectioning on the cryostat, with exposure of the epithelium in areas with less muscle and a thicker layer of muscle for other areas, which impedes antibody penetration.\nUse the blunt-ended forceps to lay a piece of epithelium into a tissue mold (muscle side down), and ensure that it lays flat. Once the tissue is flat, add a drop of OCT to the tissue.\n\t\t​NOTE: Given that the tip of the tongue is curved, it may be necessary to make a cut in the epithelium where it is curved so that the tissue can be made to lay flat.",
    "Place the tissue mold on a metal base (previously cooled in dry ice) under the dissecting scope. Continue to tap the tissue lightly with the forceps until the OCT has frozen to ensure the tissue freezes as flat as possible.\nOnce the OCT has frozen, quickly add additional OCT, and place the mold in a beaker of 2-methylbutane (cooled in dry ice) until frozen.\nCryostat sectioning\n\t\tNOTE: The cryostat is used for fine removal of remaining subcutaneous tissue, which may inhibit antibody penetration (Figure 1).\n\t\t\nMount the OCT molds on the cryostat, and cut 20 µm sections. Collect each section, and view it under the light microscope to assess its proximity to the base of the epithelium (Figure 1E - H).\nAfter the tissue is shaved from the underside of the epithelium, thaw the epithelium and rinse it twice in 0.1 M PB on a shaker.\nCircumvallate taste buds\n\t\nUsing a coronal cut with a razorblade, separate the circumvallate papilla from the anterior tongue. Use two parasagittal cuts with the same razorblade to remove the tissue lateral to the papilla under a dissecting scope. Place the papilla in a tissue mold using forceps so that one lateral edge of the circumvallate papilla faces the bottom of the tissue mold.\n\t\tNOTE: The tissue can be frozen in OCT using 2-methylbutane chilled in a beaker on dry ice and stored at -80 °C if the procedure has to be paused here.\nCut the tissue into 90 μm floating sections on the cryostat.\nTaste buds on the palate\n\t\nCut the hard palate anterior to the junction of the soft and hard palate (Figure 2). Use scissors to separate the soft palate from the underlying tissue, making sure any remaining bone fragments are cut away. Remove additional muscle and connective tissue.",
    "NOTE: Once removed, all tissue that remains will consist of glands and loose connective tissue, which are lightly adhered to the underside of the palate.\nHold the palate with blunt-ended forceps, and remove the remaining glands and loose connective tissue by gently scraping them with a razor blade.\n\t\tNOTE: The tissue can be frozen in OCT using 2-methylbutane chilled in a beaker on dry ice and stored at -80 °C if the procedure has to be paused here.\n3. Immunohistochemistry staining\nWash the tissues with 0.1 M PB, 3 x 15 min. Place the tissues in 1 mL tubes with blocking solution (3% donkey serum, 0.5% non-ionic surfactant (see the Table of Materials), 0.1 M PB) at 4 °C overnight.\nRemove the blocking solution, and incubate the tissue in primary antibody (rabbit anti-PCLβ2) in antibody solution (0.1 M PB, 0.5% non-ionic surfactant) for 5-days at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash, and incubate in secondary donkey anti-rabbit 488 antibody (1:500) in antibody solution for 2 days at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash, and block with 5% normal rabbit serum in antibody solution.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min. Incubate with donkey anti-rabbit blocking antibody (20 µg/mL) in antibody solution for 2 days at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash, and then incubate with primary antibody dsRed (rabbit) conjugated to a fluorescent label (according to the manufacturer's instructions) in an antibody solution for 5 days at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash, and then incubate with primary antibody (goat anti-Car4 (1:500)) in antibody solution for 5 days at 4 °C.",
    "Wash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash. Incubate with secondary donkey anti-goat 647 antibody (1:500) in antibody solution for 2 days at 4 °C.\nWash with 0.1 M PB, 4 x 15 min each wash, and mount (epithelial side up) in aqueous mounting media, and place a coverslip over the tissue section.\n\t​NOTE: If using antibodies from different species, as in the case with keratin-8 and dsRed only, add all primary antibodies to the antibody solution in step 3.2 and all secondary antibodies in step 3.3 before proceeding to step 3.9.\n4. Confocal imaging and deconvolution\nCapture confocal images using a confocal microscope with a 60x objective (Numerical Aperture= 1.40), 4 ms/pixel, zoom of 3, Kalman of 2, and size of 1024 x 1024. Select a step size of 0.47 mm along the z-axis. For capturing innervation to the papilla, use a zoom of 2.5 if the field of view with a zoom of 3 is too narrow to capture all the innervation to the papilla.\nTo deconvolute the images, note that some settings will automatically import with the image; therefore, fill in the remaining details for modality, objective lens, numerical aperture, immersion medium, sample medium, and fluorophores captured in the image. Then, select 3D Deconvolution.\n5. Image analysis\nTaste bud and innervation volume\n\t\nImport deconvoluted image stacks to a pixel-based image analysis software (see the Table of Materials) to determine the taste bud volume and volume of total innervation within the taste bud.\n\t\t\nUncheck Volume in the main Object menu.\nSelect Add new surfaces from the Object menu.

To find the value for the volume, select Tools under the nerve fiber Object menu, and select Volume from the dropdown menu.\nTerminal arbor contact analysis\n\t\t\nImage preparation\n\t\t\t\nGo to the Edit menu and select Crop 3D. Crop the image on all sides, removing space outside of the taste bud.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Crop as close to the taste bud without removing any relevant structure-any excess image will lengthen processing time.\nSelect Edit from the main menu, click Change data type. Select To: 32 bit float from the dropdown menu.\nSelect Add new surfaces from the Object menu. Click on Skip automatic creation, edit manually, select Contour, and then drag the slice position to the right to find the total number of optical slices.\nGenerate isometric voxels, and make sure that instead of the voxels being rectangles (0.0691 x 0.0691 x 0.474) as XxYxZ, respectively, the voxels are 0.0691 x 0.0691 x 0.0691 by dividing the rectangles into cubes with identical values for fluorescence intensity as the original, rectangular voxel. Select Image Properties. Then, divide the Z value for Voxel Size by the X or Y value (= 0.474/0.0691), and multiply that value by the number of slices (optical sections) found in the previous step.\nGo back to Edit on the main menu, and select Resample 3D.\nReplace the Z value (number of slices) with the newly calculated value.\nCreating automatic surfaces based on fluorescence",
