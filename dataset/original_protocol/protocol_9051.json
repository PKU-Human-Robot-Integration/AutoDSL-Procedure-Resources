    "1. Ex utero Electroporations with Green Fluorescent Protein Expression Plasmid\nPlasmid DNA injection solutions are prepared with  CAG-eGFP DNA 27 diluted to the final working  concentration of 0.33 mg/ml in ddH2O. Qiagen Endo-Free Maxi-Preps are used to purify the plasmid from transformed bacteria. Fast green dye at ~0.02% (w/v final) is added to the DNA solution as an injection tracer.\nTo prepare the surgical area, spray down bench top and dissecting microscope stage with a 70% ethanol solution and wipe dry. Spray surgical scissors and forceps with 70% ethanol prior to dissection and wipe dry.\nTimed Pregnant Swiss/Webster dams are sacrificed on E13 by transfer into a chamber filled with CO2  from a pressurized cylinder and the dam is monitored until all motion has stopped for at least 1 min. After sacrifice by CO2 inhalation the embryos are removed from the uterus and placed in a 10 cm Petri dish containing ice cold Hanks balanced saline solution (HBSS).\nCarefully dissect each embryo from the surrounding extraembryonic membranes and keep in ice-cold HBSS.\nTransfer each embryo individually to a second 10 cm Petri dish containing cold HBSS. Use a Hamilton syringe to inject 2-3 μl of the DNA fast green mixture into the ventricle of the left cerebral hemisphere, taking care to inject in a cortical area spatially separate from the cortical area for future analysis.\nTo electroporate, hold the embryo gently with forceps and lightly place the positive paddle of the tweezer electrode on the dorsal midline of the head and lightly place the negative paddle underneath the embryo chin. Electroporations are achieved with a BTX830 electroporator programmed to deliver five 30 V pulses of 50 msec duration, separated by 950 msec intervals. These settings are for the BTX830 model. Other systems can be used according to manufacturer's instructions.",
    "2. Whole Hemisphere Explant Preparation\nAfter electroporation the embryos are placed back into ice-cold HBSS. The brain is removed using two #5 jeweler forceps to remove the skin and cartilaginous skull from the embryo head. A forcep is then slid underneath the brain to remove the intact brain from the skull. The electroporated hemisphere (left) is then dissected away from the brain and attached mid-brain tissue is removed. Throughout the dissection procedure care is taken to not damage the meninges overlying the left cortical hemisphere.\nOnce dissected each embryo is transferred in HBSS using a pipettor with a cut 1 ml pipette tip. The hemisphere is gently expelled onto a collagen coated culture insert. Up to six hemisphere explants are arranged medial side down on each 24 mm insert. Once arranged, excess HBSS is removed from the insert and the insert is then placed into one 35 mm well of a 6 well dish. The well contains exactly 2.7 ml of media: DMEM-F12 media containing Glutamax and supplemented with 2% B-27, 1% G5 and 1% Penicillin-Strep. A few drops of the media from the well can be pipetted on top of each explant, but do not add media in excess of the original 2.7 ml per well.\nOnce the explants have been placed onto Collagen filters the 6 well dish containing the explants is placed into a Billups Rothenberg (BR) chamber (that also contains a humidifying dish of water). A 95%/5% Oxygen/CO2 gas mixture is infused into the chamber for at least 1 min before sealing the chamber shut and disconnecting the 95%/5% Oxygen/CO2 gas supply tube. The BR chamber is then placed into a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for the remainder of the culture period, 1-2 DIV.\n3. Fixation of Explant Tissue for Histology",
    "In a fume hood prepare the Pagano fixation solution by first solubilizing 8 g of paraformaldehyde in 100 ml of preheated (~80 °C) ddH2O. Add 1-3 drops concentrated NaOH to promote solubilization and gently stir. Once solubilized mix the 8% paraformaldehyde solution 1:1 with a solution that is 500 mM sucrose, 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl for a final concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mM sucrose 50 mM Hepes, 25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, pH 7.4.\nTo fix the explants warm the Pagano fix solution to 37 °C. Quickly remove most of the DMEM/F12 media from each culture well and add 5 ml of Pagano Fix to each well of explants. Make sure to cover each explant completely in fix. Fix for 1 hr at RT. Do not remove explants from filter prior to 1 hr of fixation.\nAfter fixation remove the Pagano fix solution and replace with Pagano solution without fix (250 mM sucrose 50 mM Hepes, 25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, pH 7.4). Add a few drops of 10% sodium azide and store at 4 °C until embedding.\n4. Embedding and Sectioning for Histology\nPrepare a 10% calf skin gelatin solution by solubilizing 10 g of calf skin gelatin in 100 ml of warm water (55-60 °C). Place gelatin solution on a hot plate set to 60 °C and swirl periodically until solubilized.",
    "Pour approximately 10 ml of the 10% gelatin solution into the bottom of a 10 cm Petri dish and allow 30 min to solidify. This will form a \"pad\" for embedding the explants. These pads can be prepared days in advance and stored at 4 °C. Use a ruler to draw a grid on the bottom of the Petri dish and transfer individual explants into each box of the grid. Remove residual Pagano solution and using a pipettor, cover each explant with warm 10% gelatin solution and allow to solidify. Resume slow addition of gelatin solution until each explant is completely surrounded by gelatin, taking care not to melt the pad by the addition of too much warm gelatin at once. Allow for the gelatin to harden for ~1 hr. Once hardened the individual explants can be cut out in small blocks of gelatin. The blocks are then post-fixed in Pagano fix for 24-48 hr prior to sectioning with a vibratome.\nExplants in gelatin blocks are positioned olfactory bulb up and sectioned in the coronal plane at 100 μm thickness. The sections are collected and stored in PBS + 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C until immunohistochemical processing.",
    "Immunohistochemical detection is performed by transferring sections into a 24 well plate (2-3 sections per well). First block non-specific antibody binding by adding 0.5 ml PBST+B (PBS + 0.5% Triton X 100 and 2% BSA) to each well, incubate 1 hr with gentle shaking. The appropriate primary antibody is then diluted in PBST+B and 0.4 ml per well is added for overnight incubation at RT. The primary is washed out with 3X PBS washes for at least 10 min each. The secondary antibody and 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain are then diluted in PBST+B and the samples are incubated for 2 hr at RT with gentle shaking. Three PBS washes (10 min each) are performed and then the sections are mounted on slides using a 90% glycerol 50 mM Tris, pH7.4, mounting media.\nSubscription Required.
