    "1. Dissection\nCockroach saline solution used throughout this protocol has the following composition:\nCockroach saline solution36: (grams for 100 ml)\n210 mM NaCl (1.227 g)\n2.9 mM KCl (0.0216 g)\n1.8 mM CaCl2 (0.0265 g)\n0.2 mM NaH2PO4•2H2O (0.0032 g)\n1.8 mM Na2HPO4•7H2O (0.0483 g)\n(pH 7.2. Adjust pH with 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl).\nSelect a male cockroach from the holding tank that has robust cerci (Figure 1). The last segments of the male are narrow compared to the female; and containing no ovaries and egg mass, males are easier to dissect. The males of P. americana have a pair of short styli between the cerci. These styli are not observed in the females.\nCut off the wings, legs and head and pin the body, ventral side up, to a dish lined with silicone elastomer.\nWith forceps pick up the ventral plates and cut them off with fine scissors, starting at the posterior end and working anteriorly. Always keep the internal organs moist with saline while trying to keep the cerci dry. One can use wax or pieces of rubber to position the abdomen upwards to prevent the saline from wetting the cerci. If they do get wet, dry them with a piece of tissue paper. Push to the side the internal organs and the white matter (fat body). The VNC is in the center of the field, runs the length of the abdomen and should be visible between the shiny tracheae. The nerve cord is translucent and may initially be difficult to see until the lighting is adjusted properly (Figure 2). DO NOT handle the VNC with forceps or insect pins; instead manipulate it using glass probes.",
    "Clear away the animal's tracheae system as best as possible from the nerve cord with forceps and with a pair of fine glass needles, very carefully split the VNC connectives longitudinally between A6 and A5 or A5 and A4 ganglia (Figure 3). Cradle the cerci and abdomen upwards out of the saline bath with shortened insect pins and wax or a wedge of the silicone elastomer that can be cut to fit the preparation (Figures 4A and B). Be extra careful in the last abdominal segment not to damage the cercal nerves that project into the ganglion (Figures 2D and 5).\n2. Extracellular Recording\nThe dissected preparation, microscope, and recording apparatus should be setup inside a Faraday cage to block external, particularly AC, electric fields that could override signals from neurons (Figure 6).\nPosition the microscope so that it is overlooking the microscope stage. Once the preparation is placed on the stage, adjust the position of the high intensity illuminator beam for best visualization of it.\nConnect the AC/DC differential amplifier to the integrated data recording unit (details on the specific hardware and software settings have been previously described 25). The head stage holding a suction electrode should be connected to the amplifier. A silver ground wire that has been coated with Cl- inserted into the abdomen results in more stable recordings. The reason is if the solution in the body cavity is not in contact with the bathing fluid in the dish, the fluid associated with the recording electrode remains grounded.\nSet the recording frequency to 4 kHz. Set the voltage scale (y-axis) to 500 mV (this can be adjusted to optimize visualization of the trace). Run the recording software in continuous or oscilloscope mode to record neural activity in response to stimulations.",
    "Cut one of the VNC connectives close to A5 and place the cut end attached to A6 into a suction electrode. Be sure to pull saline into the suction electrode to cover the silver wire inside it before sucking in the nerve.\nWith a dry pipette blow air on to the hairs located on each cercus. See if stimulating the hairs on the cercus ipsilateral to the recorded connective gives a different response than the contralateral one. Take note of the amplitude of the responses and the number of spikes in a given time interval during the stimulation.\nMove the suction electrode to a cercal nerve for recording. To get a better fit, switch to an electrode tip with a smaller opening if necessary.\nCut the cercal nerve close to A6 and then suck up the nerve leading to the cercus. There should be spontaneous firing of action potentials. Now, blow air onto the cercus and note the responses.\n3. Electrically Stimulating the Sensory Nerves to Determine Recruitment\nChange the recording software to sweep mode so that it records traces (100-500 msec.) each time a stimulus is triggered.\nConnect the stimulating electrode to the output of the stimulator.\nConnect the stimulator cable with the two mini-hook leads or clips.\nConnect the BNC trigger output from the stimulator to the trigger input on the recording unit.\nThe following stimulation parameters should evoke a response: Duration: 0.3 sec; Delay: 10 msec; Frequency: 1 Hz; Voltage: adjust as needed to obtain a signal in the recordings (just over threshold and being able to obtain a maximal response). There is no reason to go to voltages much higher than maximal threshold for recruitment as a high voltage can be damaging to the nerve.",
    "Cut the cercal nerve as distal as possible so that a long nerve root can be pulled into the stimulating suction electrode (Figure 7, arrow head). The connective between A6 and A5 or another segment more anterior can be used.\nSet the recording suction electrode so you can pull up a cut connective into the electrode. Be sure to pull some saline into the suction electrodes to cover the silver wire inside it before sucking in the nerves. Make sure the stimulating electrode is also grounded in the bath saline (in the abdomen near A3 is ideal).\nDeliver a series of single stimuli of increasing voltage until an action potential appears on the screen. One should make a record of the minimal stimulating voltage and duration to recruit a response. Increase the intensity until a synaptic response in the connectives is observed. The large spike (extracellular APs) from the giant axons appears first, and then other smaller AP's may also be observed."
