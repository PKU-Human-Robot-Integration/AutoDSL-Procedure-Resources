    "All animal experimental procedures were performed according to the Animal Protection Guidelines of Yokohama City University.\n1. Generation of the Acute Liver Injury Mouse Model\nAdd 1 ml of phenolized 0.85% NaCl solution (0.6 g phenol in 100 ml of 0.85% NaCl solution) to 1 mg diphtheria toxin (DT) to make a 1 mg/ml DT stock solution. Note: DT at a concentration of 1 mg/ml can be stored for approximately 2 years at 3 °C to 8 °C.\nSerially dilute the 1 mg/ml DT stock solution to 0.3 μg/ml DT in phenolized 0.85% NaCl solution and prepare an aliquot of the 0.3 μg/ml DT solution as a working solution. Note: This working solution should be freshly prepared.\nTo conduct experiments using a sublethal dose (~ 50% lethality), administer 8-week-old mice a 1.5 μg/kg dose of DT.\n\t\nPerform an intraperitoneal injection of DT by holding the mouse in dorsal recumbency and insert the needle below the bend of the knees, left or right of the midline. Avoid the midline to prevent penetration of the bladder. Angle the needle at approximately 45° to the body.\nUsing an insulin syringe, inject the mice with 100 µl of freshly prepared 0.3 μg/ml DT per 20 g of mouse weight. For example, an 18-g mouse should receive 90 µl of the 0.3 μg/ml DT solution.\nAt 48 hr post DT injection, collect blood from the tail vein by placing the mouse in a restrainer and warming the mouse tail in a 37 °C water bath for approximately 10 min to dilate the blood vessels. Then, make a 1-mm nick in the tail 2 cm from the tip with a sharp scalpel blade and collect the blood with a microcapillary tube.",
    "Centrifuge the microcapillary tube containing the blood at 1,500 x g for 5 min and collect the serum by separating the supernatant and cell pellet.\nPipette 50 µl of 1:20 diluted mouse serum onto GOT/AST-PIII slides. Measure the absorbance of the reaction product (blue dye) at 650 nm using a multi-purpose automatic dry-chemistry analyzer according to manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: The read-out of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) activity is displayed automatically. 2 days post DT injection, approximately 60% of the mice exhibited AST values between 12,000 - 16,000 IU/L and were considered to be suffering from acute liver damage. These mice were transferred to a new cage and used as cell transplant recipients.\n2. Preparation of Human Hepatic Stem Cells\nIsolate human hepatic stem cells from human primary fetal liver cells with a cell sorter using the CDCP1, CD90, and CD66 cell antigens to obtain a CDCP1+CD90+CD66- subpopulation, then seed the isolated cell population on collagen IV-coated culture dishes, as previously reported15. Use human primary fetal liver cells of an embryonic age between weeks 14 and 18.\nCollect human hepatic stem cells cultured to 80% - 90% confluence on 100-mm culture dishes, aspirate the culture medium, wash the cells with 10 ml PBS, and then remove the PBS. Trypsinize the cells with 2 ml 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C. Note: Cells at greater than 90% confluence are not suitable for cell transplantation since cell differentiation may influence their proliferative capability in mice.\nMonitor the status of cell dispersion under a microscope. When the cells appear to be floating or flowing freely, stop the enzymatic digestion by adding 8 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS.",
    "Suspend the cells slowly using a 10-ml serological pipette and transfer the cells into a 15-mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 100 x g and 4 °C.\nCarefully resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and determine cell numbers using a microscope counting chamber.\nDivide the cells into 1.0 x 106 cells per 50 µl of PBS aliquots for each individual mouse and store on ice until transplantation.\n3. Intrasplenic Transplantation of Human Hepatic Stem Cells\nPlace a clean cage on a 37 °C electric heating pad.\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane inhalation (1 - 1.5% (vol/vol) in 2 L of oxygen per min) by placing it underneath the nozzle. Alternatively, use tubes containing gauze soaked with isoflurane.\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse is anesthetized by lightly pinching the rear footpad. If a knee jerk is elicited, place the mouse back in the chamber. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nShave the surgical site using electric clippers and apply 70% (vol/vol) ethanol and povidone-iodine to sterilize. Then make a 1-cm skin incision in the left flank just below the costal border of the ribs, followed by an incision on the abdominal wall, as well as the peritoneum.\nCarefully expose the spleen. Use a 100-μl microinjection syringe with a 32-G 1/2-inch needle to directly inject 1.0 x 106 human hepatic stem cells in 50 µl PBS into the spleen of each mouse. Tilt the needle at a 5° angle for injection.\n\t\nEnsure that the depth of injection is less than half the thickness of the spleen. The needle should enter the spleen at one end (the head) and deposit the cells at the other end (the tail).",
    "To prevent leakage of the cells following injection, gently apply pressure using a finger for 2 min and then remove the needle.\nPlace the spleen back into the mouse body and close the cavity with a normal running suture for the musculature and skin.\nTransfer the mice into a 37 °C pre-warmed cage immediately following transplantation. To ensure the mouse is able to breathe comfortably, place the mouse on its side in the cage, avoiding contact between the cage bedding and the site of surgery.\nMonitor the mice until the anesthesia wears off to ensure the sutures remain closed and the mice return to pre-surgery conditions.\nEnsure the mice are provided with normal drinking water and food. After 1 hr, return the cage to the mouse room of the animal center and monitor the mice daily.\n4. Detection of Transplanted Human Hepatic Stem Cell-Derived Hepatocytes in the Mouse Liver\nNote: For the following procedures, euthanize all animals using an overdose of ketamine and xylazine followed by cervical dislocation.\nAt 4 - 6 weeks post transplantation, euthanize the mice and open the abdominal cavity by simultaneously cutting the cutis and fascia using surgical scissors.\nDissect the connective tissue above the peritoneum, using the scissors as a spreader, and cut the peritoneum along the linea alba to open the peritoneal cavity.\nLift the sternum with forceps, puncture the diaphragm, and cut through each side of the sternum up through the cervical girdle.\nSever the vena cava on the thoracic side of the liver and pull the esophagus through the liver in the anterior direction. Remove the diaphragm in order to remove the liver.",
    "Note: Be careful to keep the tips of the scissors pointed upward in order to prevent any damage to the thoracic organs underneath. The thymus has a tendency to occasionally cling to the dorsal side of the sternum and this must be carefully avoided.\nUsing the diaphragm as a handle, start pulling the liver out of the abdominal cavity. The interior vena cava will be holding the liver in place. Cut the interior vena cava; be careful not to prematurely liberate the right adrenal.\n\tNote: Mice have a four-lobed liver consisting of a median lobe, left lobe, right lobe, and the caudate lobe. The gall bladder is suspended in the small bifurcation of the median lobe.\nSeparate the lobes from each other at the junctions and embed them in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound according to the manufacturer's protocol. Freeze the OCT containing the liver tissue in the metal grids on the cryostat.\nCut 5-µm-thick sample sections using a cryostat at -18 °C and mount them on RT microscope slides. Store the stock at -80 °C. Prepare the slides for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining according to previously reported procedures16.\n5. Detection of Human Albumin Secretion and Calculation of the Chimeric Rate\nTo measure human liver reconstitution, perform human albumin ELISA using serum and a human albumin ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCalculate the humanized liver chimeric rate by real-time PCR analysis of expression levels in the whole-humanized liver. Determine the relative expression level ratio of human-specific actin to human-mouse cross actin (ratio 1) and the ratio of mouse-specific actin to human-mouse cross actin (ratio 2). The chimeric rate is calculated as ratio 1/(ratio 1 + ratio 2).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
