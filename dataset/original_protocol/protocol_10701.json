    "1. Nanoporous Gold Fabrication\nClean substrates in Piranha solution\n\t\nAdd 25 ml hydrogen peroxide (30%) to 100 ml sulfuric acid (96%) in a crystallization dish and heat the mixture to 65 °C on a hotplate. CAUTION: The liquids are extremely corrosive and must be handled with care. The spent solution should not be stored in a sealed container, as it may explode.\nPlace 1-inch by 3-inch microscope slides into the mixture using acid-resistant forceps and clean them for 10 min. Use a porcelain immunostaining boat for batch-cleaning small coverslips. Treat small coverslips with air plasma at 10 W for 30 sec prior to immersion into the solution.\nRinse the cleaned samples in crystallization dishes under running deionized (DI) water for 3 min. Blow-dry samples with a nitrogen gun over lint-free towels.\nPrepare stencil mask (Method 1: Use this for creating millimeter-scale patterns)\n\t\nPunch 250 μm-thick silicone elastomer sheets with biopsy punches and/or incise out regions with a scalpel over a semi-hard plastic surface. Clean the processed elastomer sheets in 70% isopropanol and dry with nitrogen gun.\nPlace the punched sheet on a lint-free cleanroom towel and align the piranha-cleaned coverslips over the stencil with the sample surface facing the stencil.\nPattern lift-off photoresist (Method 2: Use this for creating sub-millimeter-scale patterns)\n\t\nPlace a piranha-cleaned microscope slide on spinning chuck and blow off any particulates with nitrogen gun. Dispense 1.5 ml of adhesion promoter (hexamethyldisilazane) onto the glass slide using a plastic pipette. Spread the promoter by spinning the slide successively at 500 rpm for 5 sec and 1,500 rpm for 30 sec. Bake the slide on a hotplate at 115 °C for 7 min and let it cool for 5 min.",
    "Dispense 4 ml of photoresist onto the glass slide (3-inch by 1-inch). Spread the photoresist by spinning the slide with the same protocol as for the adhesion promoter. Bake the photoresist on a hotplate at 115 °C for 1.5 min and let it cool for 10 min.\nExpose the photoresist-coated slide with UV light (intensity: 22 mW/cm2) through a transparency mask for 15 sec. Bake the photoresist on a hotplate at 115 °C for 1.5 min and wait for 45 min. Dissolve the exposed photoresist in the developer for at least 3.5 min. Rinse thoroughly with DI water. Inspect the developed patterns under an optical microscope.\nDeposit precursor metals to produce np-Au thin films\n\t\nLoad the samples into a sputtering machine that can independently deposit gold, silver, and chrome. Sputter-clean the samples for 90 sec at 50 W under 25 mTorr argon processing atmosphere before starting metal deposition.\nSputter chrome for 10 min at 300 W under 10 mTorr argon. Sputter gold for 90 sec at 400 W under 10 mTorr argon. Co-sputter gold and silver for 10 min with silver at 200 W and Au power at 100 W. Turn off gold sputter source approximately 10 sec before turning off the silver sputter source.\nObtain precursor metal micropatterns\n\t\nSonicate photoresist-coated samples in ~180 ml of photoresist stripper for 10 cycles of 20 sec sonication and 2 min pause between the cycles. Rinse the samples with DI water and dry with a nitrogen gun. Inspect the metal patterns under a microscope.\nPeel the elastomer stencil from non-photoresist coated samples using two tweezers to reveal the deposited metal.\nDealloy precursor metal and modify nanostructure via thermal treatment",
    "Fill a 200 ml glass beaker with 170 ml of nitric acid (70%) and maintain the solution temperature at 55 °C on a hotplate. CAUTION: The nitric acid is extremely corrosive and should be handled with appropriate protective equipment.\nTreat small coverslips with air plasma at 10 W for 30 sec prior to immersion into nitric acid. Place 1-inch by 3-inch microscope slides into the beaker using acid-resistant forceps and dealloy them for 15 min. Use a porcelain immunostaining boat for batch-dealloying small coverslips.\nRinse the dealloyed samples by successively immersing them in two beakers filled with fresh DI water three times. Store samples in DI water and replace the water with fresh DI water every day for at least a week. Blow-dry samples with a nitrogen gun over lint-free towels before use.\nLoad samples onto a clean silicon wafer in a rapid thermal processing equipment. Adjust the temperature to between 200 °C and 450 °C and the ramp rate to 10 °C/sec. Expose the samples to the prescribed temperature for 10 min under nitrogen ambient. Let the chamber cool (<100 °C) and remove the samples. Alternatively, slowly place the samples on the hotplate for thermal treatment.\n2. Cell Culture\nPrepare np-Au samples for cell culture\n\t\nPlace np-Au samples in polystyrene dishes and treat with air plasma at 10 W for 30 sec and transfer the samples to 24-well tissue culture plates.\nAdd 500 μl complete culture media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) to each well. Store in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until seeding the cells (<1 hr).\nMaintain, passage, and seed cells\n\t\nMaintain cells of interest (in this case 3T3-NIH fibroblasts or murine astrocytes) in T75 flasks with culture media and passage when cells are 70% confluent.",
    "For passaging the cells, remove media from the flask, wash twice with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS), add 2 ml of 1x Trypsin/EDTA and incubate until the cells detach (~5 min). Add 3 ml fresh media and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 3 min. Aspirate supernatant and suspend the pellet in 2 ml media.\nRemove the spent media from the wells and seed the cells onto the glass coverslips at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 with a final volume of 1 ml. Shake the culture plate forward-back and right-left to ensure a uniform coating of cells over the samples. Incubate the cells until analysis while inspecting daily.\n3. Cell and Material Analysis\nStain cells to visualize cytoskeleton and nuclei\n\t\nRemove spent media from wells and wash cells twice with PBS. Fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min.\nPrepare staining solution of 300 nM Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin.\nWash cells twice with PBS, and permeabilize them in 500 μl 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.\nWash cells twice with PBS and transfer them to clean wells. Blot 50 - 200 μl staining solution onto the samples and store in dark for 20 min.\nWash cells with PBS and counter-stain with 3 nM of DAPI in PBS for 5 min.\nWash cells with PBS, and dip in deionized water before mounting on glass cover slides with mounting media and seal with clear nail polish.\nAcquire images of np-Au samples and cell cultures on np-Au surfaces\n\t\nImage np-Au surfaces with scanning electron microscope (SEM) with 50,000X magnification at 10 kV electron energy using secondary electron detector.\nCapture composite cell images at different spots on the samples using an inverted fluorescence microscope at 10X magnification with the appropriate filter cubes.",
    "Process images to determine pore and cell morphology\n\t\nOpen images in ImageJ and split into individual channels if applicable. Convert the images to 8-bit, subtract the background, and smooth them by median filtering. Adjust threshold either manually or by built-in thresholding algorithms to highlight the pores (voids) and cell bodies/nuclei.\nUse watershed command to separate merged pores or cells. Set particle analysis parameters and execute the command to extract number of particles, average area, and percent coverage by particles. Use DAPI-stained cell images for cell counting and phalloidin-stained cell images for quantifying percent cell coverage.\nModify the included macro files to perform batch analysis of multiple images.\nSubscription Required.
