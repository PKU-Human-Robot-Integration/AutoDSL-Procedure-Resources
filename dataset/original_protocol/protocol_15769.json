  "procedures": [
    "All of the procedures involving experimental animals outlined below have been approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Manitoba, which is governed by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Procedure setup and preparation\nNOTE: The following items are required for a tail vein catheter injection: insulin syringes, a 15 cm piece of PE10 tubing, 30 G needles, gauze, saline, forceps, green fluorescein dextran dye, pliers, and scissors. Also, have a needle ready with ketamine/xylazine anesthesia that will be injected before the imaging session.\nCRITICAL: All materials and equipment in Steps 1 and 2 must be sterilized prior to the use by autoclaving or rinsing with 70% ethanol. If the pliers cannot be properly sterilized, the use of a pair of large needle holders is recommended. Catheter assembly must be done with pliers and forceps to avoid accidental needle punctures.\nCut approximately 15-20 cm of Polyethylene Tubing, PE10 (I.D. 28 mm; O.D. 61 mm).\nFill a 27 G insulin syringe with 0.9% saline and lace the needle of the syringe into the tip of the polyethylene tube. Push saline through the tube, making sure there are no leaks.\nUsing pliers, bend a 30 G needle (0.3 mm x 25 mm) back and forth until it breaks from the hub. The needle must be clean with no bends.\nHolding the needle with forceps, carefully insert the needle into the end of the PE10 tubing that is attached to the saline filled syringe and remove air bubbles. This is the catheter for injection.\nFilter 30 µL of 2.5% (w/v) fluorescein dextran through a 13-25 µm filter prior to the injection.\nFill another insulin syringe with the 30 µL aliquot of dextran and make sure that there are no bubbles in the filled syringe.\n2. Tail vein injection",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5% maintenance) or ketamine/xylazine (60 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg; i.p.) and apply eye lubricant gel. Ketamine/xylazine is recommended for more stable blood flow measurements during imaging and the dose can be increased to 90 mg/kg; 10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine for longer imaging sessions.\nWhen the mouse is at the surgical plane of anesthesia, place a glove filled with warm water on the tail to dilate the lateral vein.\nRemove the glove after 30 s and clean the tail with ethanol.\nPlace the tail between the thumb and the middle finger. Provide pressure with the index finger on the tail to dilate the vein. With the other hand, pick up the needle of the catheter with forceps orienting the bezel upwards towards the ceiling.\nAfter cleaning the tail with 70% ethanol, smoothly, insert the needle into the vein at a 0° angle and gently inject saline through the catheter to ensure the needle is placed correctly.\n\tNOTE: If there is no resistance on the plunger and no swelling of the tail, then the needle is in the vein. If there is significant resistance or swelling, the needle should be removed. Steps 2.2-2.5 can be repeated up to 3 times on each side of the tail, replacing the 30G needle in the end of the catheter every second trial until placement is correct.\nOnce the needle is in the vein, switch the saline syringe at the end of the catheter with the syringe containing fluorescein dextran (Step 1.6). Slowly inject the dextran into the catheter tubing, ensuring no bubbles enter the tube. If an air bubble is apparent, cut the tubing containing the bubble to remove it and reattach the syringe.",
    "When all the dextran (30 µL aliquot) has been injected, remove the syringe, and replace it with the saline syringe. Inject the remaining dextran from the tubing into the mouse until no dye is left in the tube.\nRemove the needle from the tail and provide pressure with gauze for 10-30 s until the bleeding stops.\n\tCRITICAL: If after 6 attempts the tail vein injection is not successful, the animal should be imaged in another session. Also, the total volume (saline and dextran) injected into the mouse should not exceed 100 µL.\n3. Two photon microscopy\nFocusing on the cranial window\n\tNOTE: Use ketamine/xylazine anesthesia during data acquisition because it has less vascular effects (vasodilation) than isoflurane. If using isoflurane in the steps above, inject the mouse with ketamine/xylazine i.p. (recommended dose described above) before imaging.\n\t\nFix the mouse with a screw through its head post to a platform with a heating pad under the microscope.\nApply eye lubricant to the eyes of the mouse.\nClean the cranial window with damp dental applicators. Make sure that there are no particles left that could interfere with the imaging process.\nApply ultrasound gel on the window.\nFocus through the two-photon microscope objective until the pial blood vessels can be seen under the window.\nCheck the breathing of the mouse and ensure that the heating pad is providing sufficient temperature support.\nImage acquisition\n\tNOTE: The two-photon microscope used in this experiment has a tunable Ti-Sapphire laser for fluorescence excitation with a Pockel cell that controls the amount of laser that reaches the sample. Emitted light is split by a 565 long pass dichroic to two GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with 595/50 band pass filter (red) and 525/70 band pass filter (green) for detection.",
    "The procedures described in Steps 3.2 to 3.4 are performed using specific software of the two-photon microscope from this protocol (see Table of Materials). These steps can be adapted to other microscope software and equipment.\n\t\nWith the room lights off, set the desired wavelength in the microscope software to 990 nm to excite both RCaMP and fluorescein-dextran by clicking on the 2-P Laser box.\nSet the laser power by clicking on the Power/Gain box/Lasers section and adjusting the Pockels 1 cell voltage at 30% or a value of 300 on a scale of 1000. The laser power that reaches the sample at this setting was previously determined to be ~30 mW.\nSet the PMT detector sensitivity by clicking on the Power/Gain box/PMTs section and adjusting the value to 700-800.\n\t\tNOTE: These values can be adjusted relative to the intensity of the fluorescent sample and should be set to zero before turning on the lights in the room.\nGo to Image Resolution section and click on the 512 x 512 resolution for a larger image size.\nClick on 2-P Laser/Open to open the 2-P Laser shutter.\nGo to Scanning Section and click on the Live Scan button.\n\t\tNOTE: Live scanning with these parameters and higher resolution, RCaMP positive mural cells and the fluorescently labelled blood plasma can be seen. If the signal is weak, the pockel value can be increased until the picture is clear.\n\t\tCRITICAL: In the superficial tissue layers, the laser power should not exceed 50 mW, which is about 600 in the Pockels cells settings in this example.\nAcquiring a depth stack of the mural cells and the vascular network",
    "NOTE: Acquisition of a depth stack is recommended to properly locate pericytes in the vascular network. Ensheathing pericytes are located on the first to fourth branches from the penetrating arteriole7,8,9. The microscope software utilized in this protocol refers to depth stacks as \"Z-series\".\n\t\nMoving the microscope objective in the X, Y and Z plane, localize a large artery on the surface of the brain based on the smooth muscle cell labelling of RCaMP.\nClick on the Z-Series box.\nFocus at the top of the tissue near the pial vessels, set this as the zero point and top of the Z-series stack by clicking on the Current Z-series/ Start position [µm] section. Click on the box with four black stripes and one red stripe on the top.\nFocus down in the tissue to the desired depth and set this as the bottom of the stack by clicking on the Current Z-series/Stop position [µm] section. Click on the box with four black stripes and one red stripe on the bottom.\nSet the thickness of each image plane (step size) to 1-2 µm by typing the desired value in the box below the \"Step Size\" button (Step Size button is localized in Z-series/Current Z-series section). This will define the number of pictures that are acquired in the stack.\nSet the laser power to increase exponentially as the microscope moves deeper through the stack by clicking on the Laser/PMT Compensation box and selecting Relative (Exponential Gradient).\nName the file, chose a folder to save it and click on Start Z-series.\nAfter acquisition, open the Z-series in the imaging processing software.",
    "Merge the two channels as colored images and scan through the stack looking for pericytes and blood vessels of interest by clicking in the box Image | Color | Split Channels; Image | Color | Merge Channels.\nSelect Regions of interest (ROIs) that contain pericytes and save the positions to help locate these spots again in future imaging sessions.\nT-series calcium imaging movie acquisition (time)\nUsing the depth stack and ROIs from above as a reference, move the microscope objective in the X, Y and Z axis during live scan mode until a pericyte of interest is found.\nTo collect a movie of pericyte calcium events, increase the acquisition frame rate (>10 frames per second) by going to Image Resolution section, and clicking on the 128x128 box.\nSet the imaging duration to 60 s by clicking on the T-series box and entering the time in the duration box.\nBeside the Save Path box, click on the button with three dots to update the save path with a unique file name.\nZoom optically on the vessel to account for the lower resolution and to gain a closer view of the pericyte by adjusting the value in the Optical Zoom [mag] section.\nAcquire the T-series by clicking on Start T-series.\nHemodynamics measurements with kymographs (line scans)\nFocus on the vessel of interest at 512 x 512-pixel resolution in Live Scan mode.\nTo measure blood vessel diameter and red blood cell velocity, click on the Line Scan to start a one-dimensional scan with the microscope.\nSet the duration of the scan (30-60 s) in milliseconds.",
    "Draw a line that bisects the vessel of interest and moves parallel along the vessel. This will generate a kymograph of the vessel diameter on the left and streaks of the red blood cells moving through the vessel on the right.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple blood vessels can be measured with the same line as long as they are in the same imaging plane.\nName the file and click on the Start Linescan(s) to acquire the data.\n4. Image Analysis\nCalcium movie analysis.\n\tNOTE: This protocol outlines the steps for spectral unmixing (Figure 2) and two different methods to analyze ensheathing pericyte calcium events using manual, hand-selected ROIs (Figure 3) and automated, activity-based ROI selection (Figure 4)16,17. In order to detect and classify the signal peaks with the normalized calcium trace from each ROI, the data is long-pass and band-pass filtered which helps to smooth the data for amplitude and width estimations and also to identify peaks of different shapes: single peaks, multi-peaks, and plateaus (Figure 3B). The parameters for this analysis can be optimized to detect different types of dynamic cellular signals. The steps below will require the use of image processing software and programming software with image processing packages which contain different codes to analyze calcium movies as mentioned above. Please see the materials table for a complete list of programs and packages used in this protocol. Imaging data from different types of microscopes can be imported with these packages maintaining the metadata from the images.\n\tNOTE: Steps 4.1.1-4.1.7 describe how to select ROIs by hand in image processing software for subsequent use in the manual calcium analysis method (Step 4.1.16)\n\t\nLoad the calcium imaging T series in the image processing software, by dragging the .xml file to the software tool bar. Click on the OK box.",
    "Take the average of the stack (the average of the stack is labeled as \"Z projection\" by the image processing software). This can be done by clicking on Image | Stacks | Z projection in the tool bar.\nMake a colored image from both channels as in step 3.3.9.\nOpen the ROI manager window by clicking in the box Analyze | Tools | ROI Manager, or simply pressing the letter \"T\" in the keyboard.\nSelect the polygon tool by clicking on the polygon shape on the image processing software tool bar and outline the visible ensheathing pericyte structures, such as soma and processes.\nClick on the Add button located in ROI manager window to add selected ROIs in the ROI manager.\nGive each region of interest a unique name by clicking the Rename button and save them as a zip folder that can be loaded later in the programming software by clicking More>> | Save.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 4.1.8-4.1.14 describe how to import the calcium T-series into the programming platform and how to unmix the different fluorophores detected by the microscope PMTs into different channels (Figure 2).\nOpen the programming software and make sure the folders for the image processing packages are on the path (see Table of Materials).\nImport the calcium T-series into the programming software by calling the BioFormats function in the programming platform command window, which automatically opens the file selection window.\nDefine what is on each channel by entering the desired number. In this example data, Channel 1 answer=6 (cellular_signal), Channel 2 answer=1 (blood_plasma).\nPlot the data as a movie within the programming software to facilitate visualization by calling the plot function.",
    "For removing green fluorescence from fluorescein-dextran that bleeds through into the red RCaMP channel, unmix the channels in the image processing package by calling the unmix_chs function in the programming platform command window.\nSelect a region that only contains fluorescence from this fluorophore in Channel 1, such as RCaMP in this case.\nSelect a region that only contains fluorescence from fluorophore 2, such as fluorescein in the blood plasma in this example.\nSelect a background area that does not have fluorescence from either fluorophore. This generates a spectral contribution matrix which is applied to each pixel in each channel. It significantly improves the localization of the RCaMP signal which will enhance the detection of calcium events in these structures.\n\t\tNOTE: As mentioned above, there are multiple ways that the calcium imaging data can be analyzed within the image processing packages. Steps 4.1.16-4.1.23 describe the method to analyze ensheathing pericyte calcium events using manual, hand-selected ROIs.\nRun the cellular signaling analysis on the unmixed calcium movie by calling the CellScan function in the programming platform command window.\nThe code will ask \"Which ROI detection method would you like to use?\". Type the number 2 to load the hand-selected ROIs to the programming platform.\nLoad the regions of interest from the zip folder that were selected from the pericytes by hand earlier (Step 4.1.6).\nThe code will ask \"What's the scale factor?\". Determine the scale factor for the hand-selected ROIs relative to the image series being analyzed and type the number of the scale. In this example, the scale factor is 1 because the ROIs do not need to be resized since they were selected on images with 128x128 pixels, the same resolution as the original calcium movie.",
    "Generate plots of each ROI and the normalized calcium traces in different colors (Figure 3A) by calling the process and plot functions in the command window.\nIf the code does not detect majority of calcium events in the individual traces, modify the built-in parameters within the configuration optimization box by calling the opt_config function and adjusting the values, such as decreasing the threshold for the short-pass filtered data to three times the standard deviation of the baseline period, which is the first 30 frames of the T-series.\nSelect the Process button in the optimization box to apply the new parameters.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to detect and classify the signals, the normalized calcium trace is long pass and band pass filtered, which helps to smooth the data for amplitude and width estimations, but also to determine if signals are single peaks, multi-peaks or plateaus (Figure 3B).\nOutput the data as a .csv file that contains spatial information about the regions of interest and the peaks that were identified by calling the output_data function in the command window. Give the file a unique name for further analysis in a statistics program.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 4.1.24-4.1.31 describe the method to analyze ensheathing pericyte calcium events using analysis of activity-based ROIs.\nRepeat steps 4.1.8.-4.1.16 to import the calcium movie, unmix the channels, and call the CellScan function in the programming platform.\nThe code will ask \"Which ROI detection method would you like to use?\". Type the number 6 to select the automated region of interest identification based on the activity and change in fluorescence in 3 dimensions (x, y, and time; \"3D FLIKA algorithm\").",
    "Plot the processed results to view the identified regions of interest as different colors by calling the process and plot functions in the command window. Each ROI is distinguished in time and space and represented as an overlayed mask (Figure 4).\nIf the algorithm does not detect ROIs that are clearly visible by eye, modify the built-in parameters within the optimization box by calling the opt_config function and adjusting the values, such as increasing the gaussian filter that smooths the data in time (by 2 s) and decreasing the threshold for finding ROIs to 3 times the standard deviation of the baseline.\nSelect the process button in the optimization box to apply the new parameters. With the optimization process more ROIs should be identified (Figure 4B).\nPlot the ROIs as a movie to clearly identify the areas of activity (outlined in rainbow colors) by changing the mode of the default box to movie within the optimization window for further visualization.\nOutput the data as a csv file by calling the output_data function in the command window. This file can be analyzed further in a statistics program.\n\t\tNOTE: The analysis parameters can be adjusted to fit any type of dynamic cellular signal (calcium, FRET ratios, etc.). All of the steps above can be automated with simple programming code in order to batch process many calcium movies with the same settings.\nLine scan blood flow analysis.\nImport the line scan kymograph data file acquired in section 3.5 into the programming software.\nThe code will ask \"What is shown on channel 1 and 2?\". Define what is on each channel when prompted. In this example, Channel 1 is blank (type 0) and Channel 2 is blood_plasma (type 1).",
    "Run the diameter analysis function on the line scan by calling the LineScanDiam function, which opens a box to select the area that corresponds to the diameter in the kymograph (Figure 5B, left).\nDraw a box outside the kymograph fluorescence boundaries that corresponds to the vessel diameter.\nProcess this data class by calling the process function in order to measure the full width at half maxima for vessel diameter and generate a plot (Figure 5C) with the plot function.\nOutput the data as a csv file by calling the output_data function in the command window. This file can be analyzed further in a statistics program.\nRun the velocity radon transformation analysis by calling the LineScanVel function, which opens a box to select the area that corresponds to the RBC velocity in the kymograph (Figure 5B, right).\nDraw a box inside the border of the kymograph fluorescence that corresponds to the vessel velocity.\nProcess this data class by calling the process function in order to calculate the velocity, flux, and linear density of red blood cells from the angle of the streaks in the fluorescence. Generate a plot (Figure 5D) with the plot function.\nOutput the data as a csv file by calling the output_data function in the command window. This file can be analyzed further in a statistics program.\n\t\tNOTE: The kymographs must have clear fluorescence with well-defined edges between the black spaces in order for the diameter and velocity analysis to be accurate (Figure 5A, B). It is very important to draw the orthogonal and parallel lines in a precise manner, otherwise reliable analysis of the kymographs will not be possible. Similar to calcium analysis with the image processing algorithms, the parameters for diameter and velocity calculations can be optimized."
