    "All studies involving animals were conducted and reported according to ARRIVE guidelines29. All studies were performed with institutional research ethics board approval (REB number 4276). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada), and all animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition (National institutes of Health 2011).\n1. Aortic Ring Assay Setup\nIsolate the rat aorta.\n\t\nEuthanize 8 - 10-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats using CO2 asphyxiation: Set CO2 chambers to 20% gas replacement (flow rate = 0.2 x chamber volume/min). Confirm by the absence of pinch reflex and heart beats by palpating chest.\nWet the fur on chest area using sterilized gauze with 70% ethanol. Use sterilized forceps and scissors to make an incision in the chest midline and cut through skin and muscle layers.\nOnce the rib cage is exposed, cut the rib cage on each side and fold upwards about 5 mm from the sternum on each side. Some bleeding is expected from intercostal arteries in fresh cadavers.\nPush the lung tissue and heart to the anatomical right side to expose the aorta. The aorta is the white colored vessel located adjacent to the spinal column.\nUse forceps to pinch the aorta (after the aortic arch) and use surgical scissors to make the first incision while holding the aorta with forceps. Upon cutting the aorta, the chest cavity will quickly fill with blood, therefore it is critical to work quickly to obtain the aorta prior to blood coagulation.",
    "Use forceps to hold the aorta and gently peel the aorta downwards, away from the spinal column. The pull will sever the intercostal arteries without further incisions. Obtain approximately 10 cm of tissue and/or before the aorta divides into two branches in the abdominal cavity and cut the aorta out of the carcass. Push the diaphragm if needed to the caudal direction to gain access to lower sections of the aorta.\n\t\tNOTE: Peel the aorta gently because intense force can cause it to tear. If the aorta tears, allow blood coagulation for a few seconds and use a paper towel to remove the coagulated blood, allowing visibility of the remaining aorta.\nPlace the aorta in a 15 mL tube with 10 mL of ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Keep the tubes on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The aortic tissue can last for 1-2 h on ice but it is best to process it as quickly as possible.\nPrepare the aortic ring assay culture media in a sterile biosafety cabinet (BSC).\n\t\nPrepare the Endothelial Growth Medium (EGM) by using a filtration unit to filter 500 mL of Endothelial Basal Medium (EBM) supplemented with 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% gentamicin and growth factors (see Table of Materials). Place 50 mL of the filtered media into a bead or water bath at 37 °C.\nUse another filtration unit to filter 100 mL of EBM supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% P/S to prepared the EBM 2% FBS (EBM-FBS) and store at 4 °C.\nCoat 12-well tissue culture plates with Basal Membrane Extract (BME) while working on ice.",
    "Place a 12-well plate on a cold surface (large ice pack or tray). Add 200 µL/well of freshly thawed BME using refrigerated pipette tips and swirl the BME to ensure even coating. Work quickly to avoid uneven polymerization of the BME.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical aorta excision yields 20 aortic rings. To account for variability between the aortic ring assays, setup at least three aortic ring assays per treatment group and include a control. If the source permits, 6 rings per treatment group is recommended.\nPlace the coated plates into humidified incubators (95% relative humidity, 37 °C, 5% CO2; these conditions apply to all humidified incubator steps hereafter) for 30 min. Place 1,000 µL pipette tips back into -20 °C for step 1.5.3.\n\t\tNOTE: While the basal membrane extract is used in stock concentration, its consistency and stiffness is strictly controlled by the polymerization time. Make sure to keep the exact same polymerization times for all parallels and independent experiments.\nSection the aorta into uniform rings.\n\t\nTake the aorta from the 15-mL tube and place it into a 10 cm dish with 10 mL of fresh HBSS supplemented with 1% P/S.\nUse two sets of forceps to carefully separate the excess connective tissue, adipose tissue, and use a scalpel for the remaining branches of the intercostal arteries connected to the aorta. This reduces variability between ring units based on differing levels of the residual tissue. Remove any residual coagulated blood from inside of the aorta.\nPlace a ruler or grid under the 10 cm dish to precisely cut 1 - 2 mm wide sections of the aorta using sterile scalpel and forceps. Cut the sections as exact as possible to reduce variability between units.\nEmbed the aortic rings into BME.",
    "NOTE: If the sectioning of aortic rings is not completed before BME polymerization incubation, remove the coated plates from humidified incubators and add 100 µL of EBM to each well to terminate the polymerization. Exact timing is critical as over-polymerization of BME may interfere with the endothelial network development and cell migration. Once the aortic rings are prepared, remove the EBM from the wells and continue from step 1.5.2.\n\t\nRemove the BME coated wells from the humidified incubators and return to the BSC.\nCarefully pick up individual aortic rings with forceps and place one in the middle of each BME-coated well. Repeat for the remaining aortic rings.\n\t\tNOTE: Media transferred along with the aortic ring should be kept minimal in order to avoid polymerization irregularities.\nUse cooled (-20 °C) 1,000 µL pipette tips to add 300 µL of BME on top of each aortic ring and evenly distribute the BME around the well.\nReturn the embedded aortic rings to the humidified incubators for 30 min.\nRemove the plates with the embedded aortic ring from the humidified incubators and slowly add 1,000 µL of EGM (prepared and warmed at step 1.2.1) by placing the pipette tip against the wall of the culture well.\n\t\tNOTE: Directly pipetting the media onto the BME can disrupt the polymerized BME and hinder continuous endothelial network development. Use an appropriate multichannel pipette if available.\nFollowing 24 h, remove 1,000 µL of EGM and replace with 1,000 µL of EBM-FBS prepared in step 1.2.2, again by slowly pipetting against the side of the culture well.\nMaintain the aortic ring assay by replacing 500 µL of EBM-FBS with 500 µL of fresh EBM-FBS (37 °C) every 48 h.",
    "NOTE: See section 2 to start the MSC culture expansion on the same day as aortic ring assay establishment. This will ensure that MSCs are ready for co-culture when the endothelial networks are ready.\nUse the bright field microscopy to follow aortic ring assay endothelial network development (see Figure 1 as reference for optimal network development). Once the endothelial networks aspect is as shown in Figure 2, proceed with setting up the aortic ring assay-MSC co-cultures (section 3). Refer to step 4.1 for further details of imaging the endothelial networks.\n2. Tissue Culture\nPrepare stock solutions of tissue culture media.\n\t\nCulture FTM HUCPVCs (previously established, n ≥ 3 independent lines for each)30 and commercially available BMSCs in alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S.\nSterilize the media using 0.2 µm pore size filter bottles.\nStore the prepared media solutions at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks.\nMaintain FTM HUCPVC and BMSC cultures in humidified incubators and passage at 70 - 80% confluency determined by phase contrast microscopy. Use appropriate volumes of media for the size of tissue culture dish used (i.e. 10 mL in a 10 cm dish). Use these culture conditions for maintaining and passaging the MSCs.\nDissociate the MSC monolayers for passaging or aortic ring assay-MSC co-cultures using a dissociation enzyme solution (4 mL/10 cm dish) and incubate in the humidified incubators for 3 min. Ensure detachment of the cells using bright field microscopy; incubate for an additional 1 - 2 min if required.\nTransfer the dissociated cells into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of an appropriate culture media (alpha-MEM complete media for passaging cells or EBM-FBS for aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures) for counting using a cell counter.\n3. Preparation of Aortic Ring Assay/MSC Co-cultures\nSeed 104 MSCs on each embedded aortic ring (9,000 cells/cm2/12-well plate). Based on the number of aortic ring assays, pre-stain the MSCs with viable, nontransferable fluorescent dye. Maintain at least three wells of aortic rings without MSCs for a control group.\n\t\nTo stain 105 MSCs/mL EBM-FBS media, add 2.5 µL of viable, non-transferable fluorescent dye/mL media (5 µM) into a 15 mL tube and place in the humidified incubator for 30 min. Gently mix the tube halfway through the incubation.\nFollowing the 30 min incubation, add 1 volume of fresh EBM-FBS to the stained cells and spin at 400 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of EBM-FBS media. Confirm successful staining of the MSCs using fluorescence microscopy.\nRemove the aortic ring-containing plates from the humidified incubator and remove 500 µL of EBM-FBS from each well.\nCarefully seed 104 MSCs in 500 µL of EBM-FBS on each embedded aortic ring by evenly pipetting around the endothelial networks. Ensure even distribution by gently shaking the culture plate.\n\t\nAdd additional EBM-FBS to ensure that the total volume of media on the aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures is 1,000 µL.\nUse fluorescence microscopy to visualize the fluorescently labelled MSCs in the aortic ring assay.\n4. Microscopy",
    "Use bright-field microscopy to image the rat endothelial networks prior to the aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures for baseline (day 0) measurements of endothelial network properties (e.g., network length, network loops). Image 4 quadrants per well from the aortic ring to the furthest section of the endothelial network within that quadrant.\n\t\nImage the aortic ring networks following the aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures at days 3, 5 and 7. Use these images to quantify the MSC effect on the endothelial network development.\nUse fluorescence microscopy to image pre-labelled MSCs in the aortic ring assay.\n\t\nFollowing 24 h of aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures, use fluorescence microscopy to visualize MSC homing, elongation and integration with the endothelial networks. Overlap the fluorescent images of MSCs with the bright field images of endothelial cells to observe the colocalization of both cell types.\nImage the MSCs localized within the developed endothelial networks proximal to the aortic ring tissue, and the MSCs localized within newly developing networks distal to the aortic ring tissue (Figure 2).\n5. Flow Cytometry and qPCR\nOne day prior to dissociating the aortic ring endothelial networks, thaw frozen dispase at 4 °C O/N. Section 5.3 is identical for both flow cytometry and qPCR.\nWarm 50 mL of dispase and 50 mL of 0.5% trypsin in 37 °C bead or water bath.\nRetrieve the cells for analysis from the aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures.\n\t\nAfter 1 week of aortic ring assay/MSC co-culture, remove the culture media and add 1 mL of Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) slowly to each well for 3 min and remove. Repeat this wash twice more.\nAdd 800 µL of pre-warmed dispase to each well and incubate in the humidified incubators for 15 min.",
    "Remove the plates from the humidified incubators and suspend dispase by pipetting (5 - 10x) to break up the BME, and transfer the contents of each well into separate 15 mL tubes.\nRepeat step 5.3.3 again with fresh pre-warmed dispase until no residual BME is observed in the culture well. Add 1 volume of PBS supplemented with 3% FBS to the dispase-cell suspension to inactivate the dispase. Remove the aortic rings floating in the cell suspension using pipette tips.\nSpin the cell suspensions at 400 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant carefully, leaving 3 mL of cell suspension in the 15 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: An obvious, solid pellet may not be visible but cells and BME are present.\nAdd 3 mL of prewarmed 0.5% trypsin to the cell suspension and vigorously resuspend (5 - 10x by pipetting) cells. Incubate the trypsinized cell solutions in the humidified incubators for 10 min.\nRemove the trypsinized cell suspensions from humidified incubators and add 6 mL of PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and resuspend a few times. Spin the cell suspensions at 400 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove all the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet in the tube and resuspend cells in 1 mL PBS supplemented with 3% FBS in each tube.\nFilter the 1 mL cell suspension using a 70 µm cell strainer to remove aggregated cells and residual BME from the cell suspension. Count the cells in 1 mL of cell suspension using a cell counter.\nPrepare the cells for flow cytometry.\n\t\nIncubate the cell suspensions (105 cells in 200 µL PBS supplemented with 3% FBS) with fluorophore-conjugated (FITC or APC) primary antibodies (TRA-1-85-, CD146, CD31) concentration = 1:40) at 4 °C for 30 min, protected from light.",
    "NOTE: Flow cytometry for MSCs was optimized by Hong et al., 201328. A minimum of 10,000 cells is required for accurate readings.\nFollowing the 30 min incubation, resuspend the cells in 2 mL of PBS supplemented with 3% FBS and centrifuge (400 x g, 5 min).\nKeep cells at 4 °C protected from light until analyzing by flow cytometry (at least 1 x 104 events) within 1 h. For the gating strategy, see Supplementary Figure 1. Sort human MSCs using anti-TRA-1-85 (APC) (concentration: 1:40 and in 0.5% FBS/PBS) and sort cells into 350 µL of cell lysis buffer for qPCR analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Lysed cells can be stored at -80 °C for up to 3 months for future qPCR analysis.\nPrepare the cells for qPCR analysis.\n\t\nIsolate the RNA from lysed cells using column-based RNA isolation kits and determine the RNA concentration and quality.\nPrepare cDNA from up to 5 µg of RNA per 100 µL reverse transcriptase reaction. Perform a pre-amplification step if the RNA yield is low (< 10 ng/µL). Use of less than 100 ng of RNA will result in a high rate of false negatives.\n\t\tNOTE: The cDNA templates can be stored at -20 °C for further analysis for up to 4 months.\nPerform the qPCR using angiogenesis expression profiler arrays to detect changes in gene expression. Use 5 ng of cDNA per reaction (40 cycles, 60 °C annealing/extending temperature). Express fold change of expression compared to undifferentiated MSC derived cDNA samples. Run the appropriate negative controls (aortic ring without human MSCs).\n6. Network Quantification Following Aortic Ring Assay/MSC Co-cultures\nDownload imaging software such as ImageJ along with Angiogenesis Analyzer plugin31.\nImport the endothelial network images taken and open using the software.\nConvert the image scales based on the specifications of the microscope used.",
    "Use a straight-line tool to measure the radial network growth.\nCount the endothelial network loops using the cell counter tool (loops with at least 4 sides should be quantified).\nFor additional quantification of network properties, use the Angiogenesis Analyzer plugin or other similar plugins to analyze master segments, total segment length, total network areas, and number of junctions. Use the blurred mask tool to blur aortic ring tissue and empty spaces to avoid false positive calculations.\nTransfer the values to a statistics program and graph endothelial network properties following the aortic ring assay/MSC co-cultures.\nSubscription Required.
