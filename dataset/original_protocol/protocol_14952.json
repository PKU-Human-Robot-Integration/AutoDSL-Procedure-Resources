    "NOTE: This protocol follows the guidelines of the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg in Luxembourg.\n1. Preparation of Diffusion Tensor Imaging for the Visual Pathway for Neurosurgery and Follow Up\nPerform an MRI-scan at least one day before surgery strictly axial using 32 gradient directions and one b0-image. Keep in close touch with the neuroradiology unit at any moment.\n\tNOTE: Make clear to the neuroradiologist that the images after surgery are the same as those before the operation.\nUsing a 3-Tesla MRI, perform a 3DT1-weighted and DTI-sequence scans. Perform a 3DT1-weighted sequence after surgery as well.\n2. Using the Planning Station\nTransfer the T2-weighted, 3DT1-weighted and DTI-sequence scan data to digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM). This procedure takes up to 7 min.\n\tNOTE: Don`t stop the procedure before having transferred all the sequences. It is possible to stop and continue later depending on the date of surgery.\nOpen the surgical navigation system program. Click on File and then on Import DICOM. Repeat this procedure three times for all the sequences mentioned above.\n\t\nClick Add to view. Add every sequence separately. Don`t try to proceed with View.\nClick on Tools. Open DTI Tensor preparation. Observe a new window in the middle of the screen.\nComplete the following four steps.\n\t\nPerform Gradient Assignment as the first step.\n\t\t\nChange the b-value from 1,000 to 800 s/mmÂ² on the bottom right of the window.\nAdjust the Threshold on the top right of the window. Do it manually by simply writing a number or moving a cursor. 20 might be an acceptable value. It is a personal experience and it is not mandatory.\nPerform Gradient Registration as the second step.\n\t\t\nClick the button All Auto. This procedure takes up to 5 min.",
    "Click Verify All Registrations. Without verifying the registrations it is not possible to continue.\nPerform Coregistration as the third step.\n\t\t\nCoregister MR1 and b0 MR2 images manually. In the end Verify All Registrations.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is possible to perform this step automatically. However, the results may not be always satisfactory in the end.\nPerform Tensor computation as the fourth and last step,\n\t\t\nMake sure FA / DEC / ADC are on. If not click ON.\nClick on Compute. This procedure will take only some seconds.\nSave all the data and continue with fibertracking. Do not stop without saving everything.\n3. Fibertracking\nNOTE: Anatomic knowledge of the visual pathway is very important for the successful result.\nPrepare to find the three important points where the fibers have to go through.\nDetermine the optic chiasm using anatomical knowledge.\n\t\nUse a ROI as a starting point and let the fibers go through. ROIs are defined by the physician.\nAlternatively, segment the suspected region. Click Segmentation on the bottom left and another window will appear. Segmented areas are anatomically defined areas.\n\t\t\nPaint the region manually. Scroll up and down to include the whole optic chiasm. Save the procedure and go back.\nTrack the fibers either from the region of interest or from the segmented area or both.\nThe fibers reach the left geniculate nucleus (LGN), which is the second important point of the visual pathway. The maximum angle was 50. The risk of false tracts will rise with if the angle is too high.\n\t\t\nThere is a possibility to segment the LGN as shown with the optic chiasm and then track the fibers. After having segmented the optic chiasm, track fibers which run from the LGN and finish in the optic chiasm or vice versa.",
    "Segment the visual cortex. Proceed like in the case of the optic chiasm. This might take some time as 3DT1-weighted image contains 160 slices.\nTrack the fibers from the visual cortex to the LGN. It is possible to track them from the LGN to the visual cortex as well.\nIf the visual cortex is invaded by a tumor or edema then use a region of interest in place of a segmented area and then let the fibers run in direction of the LGN.\n\t\tNOTE: If the edema is segmented it sometimes might invade the visual cortex then then the visual cortex might not be able to segmented entirely because the computer can`t distinguish between them. That`s why it is necessary to put a ROI.\nRepeat everything for the other hemisphere.\nStart with the healthy hemisphere first.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to start with the other one too but it might be easier to track the fibers of the healthy hemisphere first to become a first idea about the situation. It is not mandatory, it is only an advice.\nSegment the cerebral lesion and the edema. Proceed as mentioned above in 3.2.2.\n\t\nAssign a color for every segmented area or lesion in order to distinguish better.\nSave the procedure after each step in case of unforeseen events or in case of an emergency.\nExport the entire data locally. It is possible to export it to the operating room directly but it isn`t recommended.\n\t\nPress File and then Export 3D-Objects. Make sure to export only the Navigation Exam.\nDon`t export the Hybrid Exam.\nEnter Cranial. Choose the right patient then press Stealthmerge. Choose 3DT1-weighted images as reference exam.\nCreate a 3D-model and insert everything.\nImport the data in the operation room.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
