    "Preparation before ciliary shaft purificationGrow and maintain mouse ependymal cells (mEPCs) in a 75 cm2 flask (Hao et al., 2021).Add 6 mL of fibronectin (10 μg/mL in PBS) to a 75 cm2 flask, and incubate at 37°C for 24 h to coat the flask the day before culture.Dissect the telencephala from five C57BL/6 mouse pups at postnatal day 0 to 1 (P0–P1) in ice-cold dissection buffer, and remove the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the choroid plexus, the olfactory bulb, and meninges with sharp tweezers.Transfer the dissected telencephala into a 15-mL tube, and digest them with 10 mL of freshly prepared enzymatic digestion buffer at 37°C for 30 min.Dissociate cells carefully by pipetting ten times with a 5-mL pipette, and collect cells by centrifugation at 400 × g at room temperature for 5 min.Resuspend cells with mEPC culture medium, and seed them into a 75-cm2 fibronectin-coated flask.Shake off and remove neurons one day after seeding.When cells are confluent, rinse the cells with PBS, and add 10 mL of starvation culture medium to induce differentiation.Harvest cells after culturing for ten days in starvation culture medium.Note: The ratio of multiciliated cells should be approximately 50%, when harvested on day 10 of serum starvation (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4467/bioprotoc-12-14-4467-g001.jpgFigure 1. Primary cultured mouse ependymal cells. Acetylated tubulin (Ac-tub) decorates ciliary axonemes. Zo-1 and DAPI label tight junctions and nuclei, respectively. Scale bar, 25 μm.Coat coverslips with poly-L-lysine, one day before ciliary shaft purification.Place 12 sterilized coverslips in a 24-well plate, with one coverslip per well.Rinse coverslips three times, with 500 μL of PBS per well.Add 500 μL of poly-L-lysine in PBS (100 ng/μL) to each well, and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.Ciliary shaft purificationWash mEPCs twice with 6 mL of ice-cold PBS, and twice with 6 mL of ice-cold deciliation buffer quickly.",
    "Into the flask, add 9 mL of ice-cold deciliation buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100.Fix the flask on a horizontal shaker with a sticky green rubber base (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4467/bioprotoc-12-14-4467-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative image of an adhered flask on a horizontal shaker. Immediately shake at 300 rpm and 37°C for 15 min, to detach cilia from the base of the transition zone (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Ciliary shaft purification using shear force. Transfer the supernatant containing ciliary shafts into a 15-mL tube.Centrifuge horizontally in a swinging bucket rotor (BIOFlexTM HC) at 600 × g and 4°C for 10 min to remove cell debris.Rinse the poly-L-lysine coated coverslips three times with 500 μL of PBS per well.Aliquot the supernatant into 12 wells with poly-L-lysine coated coverslips in equal amounts (720 μL of supernatant per well).Place the 24-well plate in a swinging bucket rotor (BIOFlexTM HC).Centrifuge horizontally at 4,200 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Wash the coverslips once with 500 μL of PBS per well.Now, the purified ciliary shafts are ready for immunostaining, puromycin labeling, and proximity ligation assays.Note: It is recommended to use immunofluorescence staining to examine the quality and integrity of cilia. The antibodies against Arl13b (a ciliary membrane protein) and acetylated tubulin are for the quality and integrity of ciliary membrane and axonemes, respectively. The antibodies against Cep290 (a transition zone protein) and Odf2 (a basal body protein) are used to check if the purified ciliary shafts contain the transition and lack the basal body. Immunostaining of purified ciliary shaftsFix the ciliary shafts with 500 μL of 4% PFA per well at room temperature for 15 min.Briefly wash with 500 μL of PBS per well.Permeabilize with 500 μL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS per well for 15 min.Briefly wash with 500 μL of PBS per well.",
    "Incubate with 500 μL of blocking buffer (4% BSA in TBST) per well at room temperature for 1 h.Make a humidity chamber (Figure 3).Wrap the outer surface of a 15 cm Petri dish with tin foil, to protect the sample from light. Place the shiny side of the tinfoil facing out of the humidity chamber.Place a water-soaked filter paper into the Petri dish.Place a piece of parafilm on the filter paper.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4467/bioprotoc-12-14-4467-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative image of a humidity chamber. Tinfoil, filter paper, parafilm, and coverslip are noted. Filter paper and parafilm are outlined by purple and blue dashed lines, respectively.Using a tweezer, transfer the coverslips onto the parafilm. Place the side with ciliary shafts upward.Incubate each coverslip with 90 μL of primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight.Wash with 200 μL of blocking buffer three times for 5 min each.Incubate each coverslip with 90 μL of secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h.Wash with 200 μL of blocking buffer three times for 5 min each.Briefly wash with 200 μL of Milli-Q water per coverslip.Drop 10 μL of mounting medium (ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant) per slide.Remove excess Milli-Q water from coverslips with a filter paper.Mount the coverslips onto the slides immediately (Cao et al., 2014).Dry the sample at room temperature for at least 2 h in the dark, and store it at 4°C.Imaging of purified ciliary shafts by confocal microscopeConfocal microscopy images were taken on a Leica TCS SP8 WLL system with a 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. Immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.518 was used to minimize spherical aberrations. Scan speed was 400 Hz, line average was 3, and optical sections were captured at 0.5-μm intervals along the z-axis. A typical image is shown in Figure 4.",
    "For extra fluorescence images, please refer to the supplementary Figure 2C of the original research article (Hao et al., 2021).Measurement parameters for confocal imaging are in Table 1, and proper ciliary shaft density for fluorescence imaging is shown in Figure 4.Table 1.
