    "This research has been performed in compliance with all institutional, national and international guidelines for human welfare. Brain tissues were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program in Sun City, AZ. The operations of the Brain and Body Donation Program are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB protocol #20120821). All subjects or their legal representatives signed the informed consent. Commercial (non-brain) biospecimens were purchased from Proteogenex.\n1. RNase R Treatment\nNOTE: In the following steps, the reaction volume is adjusted to a total volume of 50 µL. This is the minimum sample volume to be used in the RNA cleanup & concentrator kit (see Table of Materials). Additionally, the optimized protocol described here is for an input amount of 4 µg of total RNA. A longer incubation time for RNase R treatment is recommended for an input amount >4 µg.\nDilute total RNA to 4 µg in 39 µL RNase-free water in a microcentrifuge tube and mix well by pipetting.\nIn a separate tube, dilute the RNase R to a working concentration of 2 U/µL with 1x RNase R Reaction Buffer. Make only enough for immediate use.\nPipette 39 µL of total RNA and 5 µL of 10x RNase R Reaction Buffer into a 1.5 mL reaction tube and mix well by pipetting (50 µL will be the total reaction volume). Next, add 6 µL of RNase R (2 U/µL).\nAdjust the pipette to the full reaction volume (50 µL) and mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nPlace the tube in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. Make sure that the full reaction volume is immersed in the water bath.\nPlace the tube on ice and immediately proceed with RNA cleanup & concentration (section 2).",
    "2. Purifying RNA Using an RNA Cleanup and Concentrator Kit\nNOTE: When using high quality RNA (RIN>8, DV200>80%), RNase R treatment may result in loss of approximately 60% of RNA. Using a 4 µg input, it is estimated that 2–2.5 µg of treated RNA is left after section 1.\nBefore starting, prepare the RNA Wash Buffer by adding 48 mL of 100% ethanol to the buffer concentrate and mix well by pipetting. Place purification columns into collection tubes (see Table of Materials) and place in a tube rack.\nNOTE: Use the following centrifugation settings for all following steps: 10,000–16,000 x g. If DNase I treatment has already been performed, skip DNase I treatment at this stage.\nAdd 2 volumes of RNA Binding Buffer to the RNase R treated sample, and mix well by pipetting (total volume: 150 µL).\nAdd 1 volume of 100% ethanol to the RNA Binding Buffer and RNase R treated sample mixture, and mix well by pipetting (total volume: 300 µL).\nTransfer the entire volume to the column and centrifuge the column for 30 s. Discard flow through.\nAdd 400 µL of RNA Prep Buffer directly to the column, centrifuge the column for 30 s, and discard flow through.\nAdd 700 µL of RNA Wash Buffer directly to the column, centrifuge the column for 30 s, and discard flow through.\nAdd 400 µL of RNA Wash Buffer directly to the column, centrifuge the column for 2 min, and transfer the column to a fresh RNase-free 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 11 µL of RNase-free water directly to the column by holding the pipette tip right above the column filter and ensuring that water lands only on the column filter.\nIncubate the column for 1 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 1 min.",
    "Before discarding the column, check for flow through in the RNase-free tube. If elution was successful, store sample at -80 °C or immediately proceed with library preparation. The final total elution volume of approximately 10 µL is used for library construction.\nNOTE: Stopping point: Leave RNA at -80 °C for up to 7 days before continuing with library preparation.\n3. circRNA Library Prep\nNOTE: See Table of Materials for kit, which contains most reagents used in this section.\nrRNA depletion and fragmentation\n\t\nTransfer 10 µL of purified RNA from step 2.10 to a clean well in a new 96-well 0.3 mL PCR plate. To the well, add 5 µL of rRNA Binding Buffer followed by 5 µL rRNA Removal Mix. Gently pipette up and down 10 times to mix.\nSeal plate and incubate for 5 min at 68 °C on a pre-programmed, pre-heated thermocycler block. After completion of the 5 min incubation, place plate on bench and incubate at room temperature for 1 min.\nRemove seal from plate.

Remove and discard all of the supernatant from the well.\nWith the plate still on the magnetic stand, add 200 µL of freshly prepared 80% EtOH to the well without disrupting the beads. Incubate for 30 s, then remove and discard ethanol. Repeat for a total of 2 washes.\nAdd 11 µL of Elution Buffer to each well and pipette up and down 10 times to mix. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min, and then transfer to the magnetic stand until the solution clears (1–5 min).\nTransfer 8.5 µL of the supernatant from the well to a new well on the same plate or to a new plate.

When samples reach 4 °C, proceed immediately to adapter ligation.\nTo each sample add 2.5 µL of Resuspension buffer, 2.5 µL of a unique RNA adapter, and 2.5 µL of Ligation Mix. Pipette up and down 10x to mix.",
    "Incubate samples on a pre-programmed, pre-heated thermocycler block at 30 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 5 µL of Stop Ligation buffer to each sample and pipette up and down to mix.\nAdd 42 µL of mixed PCR purification beads to each sample and mix thoroughly. Follow steps 3.2.6 through 3.2.10, but change the resuspension volume to 52 µL and final elution volume to 50 µL.\nRepeat the PCR purification bead protocol again with the 50 µL elution from step 3.3.6, but change the resuspension volume to 22 µL and final elution volume to 20 µL.\nNOTE: If not proceeding immediately, samples can be stored at -20 °C for up to 7 days.\nAdd 5 µL of PCR Primer Cocktail and 25 µL of PCR Master Mix to each sample. Mix by pipetting up and down 10 times. Incubate the reaction on a pre-programmed, pre-heated thermocycler block using the following parameters: 98 °C for 30 s; then 8 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; then 72 °C for 5 min, then 4 °C hold.\nNOTE: Optimization of the total number of PCR cycles may be needed to generate sufficient amounts of library for sequencing.\nFollow the protocol for PCR bead purification (steps 3.2.4 through 3.2.9), except add 50 µL of well-mixed PCR purification beads and change the resuspension volume to 32.5 µL with a final elution volume of 30 µL.\nNOTE: Samples should be stored at -20 °C.\nQuantification and Quality Control using a nucleic acid analyzer\n\t\nAllow tapes and reagents to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min.\nMix 2 µL of library with 2 µL of HS D1000 buffer, and add to a compatible well plate.",

Data Analysis Workflow\nSequence RNA-seq libraries (see Table of Materials) to generate 82 bp paired-end reads. Convert raw sequencing data in the form of basecall files (.bcl) to FASTQs using the bcl2fastq tool (v0.2.19).\nDetect circRNAs.\nNOTE: Based on previously reported evidence that an ensemble circRNA detection approach performs better compared to using a single detection tool21,22, we suggest using multiple tools for circRNA detection. Here, circRNAs were identified using six existing circRNA prediction algorithms: find_circ, CIRI, CIRCexplorer, Mapsplice, KNIFE, and DCC, applying the recommended parameter settings for each algorithm.\n\t\nDownload and install each circRNA detection algorithm on a Linux high performance computing cluster using the instructions provided by the developers.\nAlign RNA-seq FASTQs against the reference genome (GRCh37), utilizing the aligner recommended for each tool.\nFollowing alignment, execute circRNA detection algorithms by applying their respective recommended parameter settings.\nEach tool will output a multi-column results file with the list of detected circRNAs, extract the circRNA co-ordinates and the number of supporting reads from this in order to quantify the number of candidates detected in each sample/test condition.\nConvert the circRNA coordinates output by CIRI, Mapsplice, and DCC to 0-based coordinates to be consistent with the other three algorithms.\nSelect circRNAs with two or more supporting reads or downstream analyses and comparisons. Table 1 summarizes all the parameters evaluated in our study along with the total number of sequencing reads generated for each sample.",
    "For each sample/test condition, count the number of detected circRNAs normalized to the number of mapped reads generated for that library, per million. Summarize the results across the various tools/samples in box plots, as detailed in the Representative Results.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
