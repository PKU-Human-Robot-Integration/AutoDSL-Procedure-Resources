    "NOTE: All the procedures were approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals.\n1. Sleep Deprivation Setup\nUse soft paintbrushes to gently poke mice when asleep.\n\t\nMake sure the paintbrush can fit through the bars of the mouse cage feeder to ensure that mice have access to food and water ad libitum during sleep deprivation.\nDo not use paintbrushes for multiple cages to prevent the transfer of scents between cages. We suggest that you label each brush with its assigned cage and restrict its use to that cage.\nDesignate a room where all sleep deprivation will occur.\n2. Animal Setup\nRandomly assign each cage to either sleep deprivation or control group.\nGive mice access to food and water ad libitum during the experiment.\nMake sure view of mice is not restricted by bedding, nest material, or enrichment objects in cage.\n\t\nRemove extra bedding or enrichment objects that could restrict the view of the mice.\nIf food or water restricts view of mice, move mice to an area of cage where the view is not restricted.\n\t\nIf the food blocks a large portion of the cage, remove some food and place pellets at the bottom of the cage so that animals maintain access to food during the sleep deprivation period.\n3. Animal Conditions\nNOTE: We chose to begin the three hour sleep deprivation period at 11 AM, when mice are in the middle of their inactive phase, but the time of day and duration of sleep deprivation can be chosen based on the desired experimental conditions.\nControl Group.\n\t\nOn P5, remove the sire from the breeder cage and leave the dam with the pups until weaning (P21).",
    "Move mice assigned to the control group to the sleep deprivation room and gently prod the mice with a paint brush continuously for 10 minutes a day for the duration of the experiment (P5 to P42).\nAfter these 10 minutes, return the mice to the animal holding room and do not disturb them\nSleep Deprivation Group.\n\t\nOn P5, remove the sire from the breeder cage and leave the dam with the pups until weaning (P21).\n\t\tNOTE: Sleep deprivation prior to P5 may result in cannibalization of the pups. We did not observe significant cannibalization at P5 and later.\n\t\tNOTE: In young pups, the drive to sleep is very high requiring almost constant stroking. As the mice develop, especially after weaning, the sleep pressure is lower and they do not need constant prodding.\nContinue with sleep deprivation every day until P42.\n\t\tNOTE: Sleep deprivation protocols can vary in length and extend past P42 if desired.\nMove mice assigned to the sleep deprivation group to the sleep deprivation room daily during the light cycle where they will be monitored. The exact duration of sleep deprivation can be adjusted based on the specific research question.\n\t\tNOTE: In neonatal mice sleep deprivation that lasts longer than 3 hours is difficult because of the increase in sleep pressure15.\n\t\t\nDuring this time, gently prod the mice with the paintbrush any time that sleep is evident. Specifics of sleep deprivation are explained in the next section.\n4. Sleep Deprivation\nGently prod mouse with paintbrush if suspected of being asleep until a response is observed. Alternatively, invert mice and push over onto their backs to disrupt sleep.\n\t\nConsider a mouse to be asleep if any of the following occur: inactivity, twitching (especially with pups), or if their eyes are closed (in mice older than P12).",
    "Consider mice to be awake if they are moving around, trying to flip over after being on their backs, or grooming themselves.\nIf dam is covering pups during sleep deprivation, gently prod her away from pups so the view of the pups is unrestricted.\n5. After Sleep Deprivation\nWhen the three-hour period of sleep deprivation is complete, put the bedding and any food that may have been removed back and put the lid back on the cage.\nReturn cages to animal holding room until the next day of sleep deprivation.\n6. Subsequent Experiments\nDepending on the goal of the sleep deprivation study, proceed with subsequent experiments.\n\t\nHarvest serum from animals to determine corticosterone levels18.\nDo any of a number of behavioral tests, including Open field, RotaRod, Elevated Plus Maze, Social behavior testing, Marble Burying, etc.8,19,20 These behavior tests will also prevent the animals from sleeping so that should be factored in when determining how many days of continuous sleep deprivation to employ.\nSubscription Required.
