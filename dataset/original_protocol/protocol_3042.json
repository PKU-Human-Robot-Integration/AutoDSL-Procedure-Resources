    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nNeedle Wounding\nTiming: 10 animals/min\nA glass needle is used to wound the worm. This step is very crucial in analyzing the protein aggregation at the wound site.\nGrow the worm strain to be used in the experiment using the NGM plate in a 20°C incubator.\nSeparate 20–30 L4 worms to a fresh NGM plate by picking them out of the master plate 1 day ahead of wounding.\nNote: Separating worm will reduce the possibility for us to forget which worm we have wounded.\n30 min before wounding, place the NGM plate to be used for wounding on an icebox.\nCritical: Icebox treatment is not recommended for observing protein that aggregates early post wounding. Transport of vesicles slows down at lower temperatures and thus will affect the aggregation level.\nNote: This will reduce the movement of the worm, making wounding easier and more precise.\nLoad the glass needle to a stable mount (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Image of the Needle Mount\nPlace the agar plate with worms to be wounded under a light microscope.\nUse low magnification and locate the glass needle, then lower the needle while increasing the magnification of the microscope while also gradually adjusting the focus.\nPosition the needle perpendicular to the worm for wounding.\nWound the worm around 1/3 from the head and 1/3 away from the tail, avoiding gonads. Make sure that the wound is punctured in hyp-7.\nCritical: Shortly after wounding, small cytoplasm leakage can be observed. Do not pierce too deep. If the intestine of the worm came out or if the body of the worm ruptured, then it will not be suitable for imaging. Moreover, worms in this type of damage will mostly kill the worm shortly after wounding.",
    "Incubate the wounded animals and unwounded control animals at 20°C, waiting for the recovery (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. C. elegans Diagram\nCritical: Do not kill the worm.\nNote: There are ways to confirm the worm is still alive:\nCheck if the pharynx pump of the worm is still functioning.\nTest if the worm still responds to touch.\nPut a drop of water to the worm to see if there are any responds. (living worms will usually wiggle or swim).\nAlternatives: Use automated micromanipulator and microinjector to perform precise needle wounding.\nTrypan Blue Staining\nThis experiment is used to observe the capability of membrane repair of a specific strain of worm. The staining will be done after needle wounding.\nNote: Cell membrane will be breached when the worm is wounded\nA single worm can be wounded twice.\nCritical: Do not kill the worm; dead worms cannot repair wounds.\nImmediately put the wounded worms inside the TryB solution for 1 h incubation at 20°C.\nAfter 1 H, Pipette out most of the TryB solution out.\nNote: Do not position the pipette tip at the very bottom. The worms may also be sucked into the pipette tip.\nDilute with M9 buffer. (repeat washing process 3× or until the solution is clear-light blue) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Washing Off TrypB Solution\nThe light-blue colored solution has been washed and is ready to be transferred to the NGM plate. The dark-blue solution shows the unwashed solution. The green arrow points to unwashed solution. The red arrow points to washed solution.\nCritical: Wait for about 30 s for the worms to sediment at the bottom of the tube before pipetting out the excess solution. Do not centrifuge the wounded worm, as this can kill the worm.",
    "Incubate the worms 20°C–25°C until the time point for imaging is reached.\nObserve the worms under a microscope. Here we used Nikon, Eclipse Ni-U.\nNote: Wound site can be seen as a dark-blue spot while the healed wound will be light blue or even no staining can be observed.\nTips: 96 well plate is an option to be used if a large quantity of staining needs to be done\nNote: To improve the reliability of the results, at least 100 worms are needed for the statistical analysis. Repetition of the experiment is also crucial\nAlternatives: Use other membrane-impermeable fluorescent molecules to assess the damaged membrane.\nSingle-Plane Imaging\nPrepare 4% melted agar and put it inside warmer to prepare the agar pad.\nPrepare four glass slides and construct as the picture show.\nNote: This is to make an even surface of the agar pad (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. How to Assemble Glass Slides\nUse a dropper to drop a little melted agar to a cover slide and immediately cover it with another glass slide.\nUsing 10 μL pipette put a drop of 12% levamisole on the agar pad.\nPick the worms and group them on the levamisole for easier observation in the confocal microscope.\nLay a coverslip on top of the agar pad and drop oil on the coverslip.\nNote: Make sure that the oil has covered the area where the worms have been placed.\nNote: The more detailed guide is available at IQ 3 user guide\nAdjust the magnification, focus, and brightness to observe the worms\nFirst, use 10× magnification to spot the worms. Use coarse Z plane adjustment to spot the position of the worm.\nNote: This adjustment will change the Z plane.",
    "After the worms can be observed clearly, lower the Z plane. This should bring the Z plane to the base.\nChange to 100% magnification and bring up the Z plane. Press the button on the joystick. This will make the X-Y movement to Extra-fine mode. Change the Z plane adjustment to Fine. Adjust so that worms can be seen clearly.\nChange the Z plane adjustment to ExFine, turn the white light off, and press the L300 button for fluorescence protein observation.\nChoose the fluorescence of choice to observe the desired fluorescence protein\nAdjust the z plane to observe the epidermis. The epidermis is located between the cuticle layer (when stripes are visible) and the intestine.\nNote: Intestine is recognized by its path that extends from the pharynx all the way to anus.\nCapture several images from the z plane using a Z scan (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Z Scan Illustration\nNote: Scroll unit is the z plane moved/click on the up and down button.\nNote: Z step indicates every certain unit length; an image will be captured.\nNote: If the fluorescence is not very bright, the brightness/exposure can be adjusted manually. Another option is to check the automap box.\nCritical: Be sure to add a scale bar on one of the images that are captured using the same magnification.\nConfocal Microscope Time-Lapse Imaging\nThe principal of this protocol is to set up multiple points on the XY plane to be revisited for Z scanning after a period of time. We used this assay as a method to show the aggregation of protein at the time point, in which the aggregation starts to show significance.\nNote: Protocol will not be described as detailed since some details have been discussed on Single-plane imaging.\nPrepare and agar pad on a glass slide",
    "Critical: in this step, the agar must be evenly flat. Any unevenness will impact the quality of the result.\nUsing a 0.5–10 μL pipette, place a small drop of 12 μM levamisole on the agar pad.\nPlace 10 wounded worms on the levamisole drop and cover with a coverslip.\nObserve a single worm and set the start and endpoints for the Z scan.\nNote: Make sure that Z plane will be applied for all XY coordinate added.\nSelect the desired channel to be used to observe the fluorescence protein.\nSelect a multi-field scan from the scan manager. Then, click next.\nClick add to the first point. Then, move the joystick to adjust the XY plane to fine another wound site. (keep on adding until all desired wound sites have been added).\nClick on the Time-Lapse button. Then, select the duration and interval before starting the imaging.\nNote: Duration is how long the imaging will run. Interval is the gap time for the next XY scan to run.\nCritical: The more Z plane to be scanned, the longer it will take to finish the imaging of one point. Pay close attention to the time needed to scan a point and roughly estimate the time needed to complete the set of coordinates chosen. The time needed to complete one run should not exceed the time interval selected.\nClick run to start the time-lapse (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/279-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Adhesive Application",
    "Note: Applying adhesive around the coverslip will stabilize the time-lapse imaging in the long run. As the levamisole dries out, the adhesion of the coverslip and the agar pad will decrease. Hence, the friction between the microscope lens and the coverslip will cause a slight movement and will influence the imaging result. Also, it will seal the gap between the agar pad and the glass slide. Hence, preventing the agar pad from drying out.\nNote: Observe the first cycle to see if all points selected have the right Z plane adjusted. If not, stop the protocol and try to readjust the z plane for better quality imaging.\nCritical: It is very important to pay attention to the time interval. Selecting too many coordinates might cause the cycle to end before Z projection of all coordinates being captured."
