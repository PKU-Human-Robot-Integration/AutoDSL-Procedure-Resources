    "This study was approved by the Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University Committee (Ethics Approval No: 2021-KY-081-01) on August 25, 2021. The present human surgery protocol was approved by and performed according to the ethical guidelines of the Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Moreover, informed consent was obtained from the patient for the release of his treatment-related information and data.\n1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclude patients with the following clinical evaluations.\n\t\nPreoperative CT image evaluation suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nPreoperative imaging examination indicating that the maximum diameter of liver tumors is >5 cm.\nAll preoperative Child-Pugh grades as A or B9.\nPatients with residual volumes of >30% normal and >40% sclerotic livers.\nPatients with no serious vital organ lesions.\nExclude patients with the following clinical evaluation.\n\t\nPreoperative CT images suggestive of tumor invasion of the IVC, left hepatic pedicle or left hepatic vein.\nPreoperative CT images indicating tumor invasion of the left liver and distant metastasis.\nPreoperative CT images suggestive of tumor rupture.\nPreoperative CT images showing the presence of tumor close to the IVC.\n2. Preoperative preparation\nProhibit the patient from eating and drinking before the surgery.\nUse tracheal intubation under general anesthesia10.\nSterilize the skin with 0.5% iodine-based scrub.Place sterile towels on the inter-nipple connection, symphysis pubis, right midaxillary, and left midclavicular lines.\n\t​NOTE: Disinfect the surgical area with iodophor three times.\n3. LARH surgical technique\nPlace the patient in a supine position, with the head of the bed elevated, the feet of the bed lowered, and the right side of the patient's body tilted at 15°.",
    "Make five different curved incisions. Use a pneumoperitoneum needle to access the abdominal cavity by inserting it through the umbilicus incision. Connect the pneumoperitoneum needle to the pneumoperitoneum machine through the pneumoperitoneum connecting tube and inject CO2 into the abdominal cavity (Table of Materials). Set the pneumoperitoneum pressure to 13 mmHg on the pneumoperitoneum machine.\nConsider a curved incision on the umbilicus as the laparoscopic hole (A), two 1-cm curved incisions (B and E) as the main operating holes, and two 5-mm curved incisions (C and D) as the auxiliary operating holes (Figure 2).\n\t\nPlace the trocar of 5, 10, 10, 5, and 5 mm at the umbilicus (Figure 2, point A), below the xiphoid process (point B), midclavicular line (point E), the anterior axillary line under the right costal margin (point C), and between operation incisions A and B (point D) (Figure 2).\nPerform abdominal exploration by penetrating the abdominal cavity. Locate the tumor and check for the presence of significant extrahepatic metastases through visual inspection.\nDissect the recess6 between the root of the middle hepatic vein (MHV) and the right hepatic vein (RHV) with an ultrasonic knife and an aspirator (Figure 3).\nSeparate the gallbladder triangle with an ultrasonic knife to expose the gallbladder duct and artery. Cut them off and remove the gallbladder.\nEnsure the assistant assists in lifting the liver, and the operator separates the right hepatic artery (RHA) and the right branch of the portal vein (RPV) with an ultrasonic knife and aspirator. Then, use a suture (4#) to ligate the RPV but do not transect it first. Use a home-o-lock to clamp the RHA.",
    "Trace the IVC bottom-up to look for the short hepatic veins (SHVs) wounds and ligate them (Figure 4A). Then clamp them using an ultrasonic knife to access the avascular area behind the liver (Figure 4B).\nInsert the Goldfinger dissector through the hepatic posterior space and exit through the hepatic vein recess.\nFix the Goldfinger dissector with a urinary catheter (Table of Materials) and bypass the liver to establish a retro hepatic tunnel (Figure 5).\nUse a catheter to lift the liver and assist in exposing the liver resection plane during liver dissection.\nTransect the liver parenchyma with an ultrasonic knife along the hepatic ischemic line. Ensure no significant bleeding occurs until the tumor is removed along with the right liver.\nOpen the inferior hepatoduodenal ligament with an ultrasonic knife and use the sterile bracelet to bypass the hepatoduodenal ligament as a pre-blocking band to perform the first hilar occlusion and reduce bleeding, if necessary.\nWhen possible, use an ultrasonic knife to transect the liver parenchyma along the MHV and during the process. Thicker pipes that are encountered can be cut off by suture ligation and home-o-lock clipping (Figure 6).\nFree the right anterior and posterior Glissons and subsequently transect them using an endoscopic stapling instrument and single-use loading unit (e.g., Endo-GIA).\nAfter completely cutting off the liver parenchyma, examine the presence of vessels from the bottom up and separate them one by one.\nSeparate the right hepatic coronary and triangular ligaments using an ultrasonic knife with the help of an assistant who can help with proper exposure.\nPlace the specimen in a specimen bag and make a transverse incision at the intersection of the right midclavicular line and the umbilical line (Line Red) to remove the specimen altogether (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: Note that the MHV is visible during the liver section and IVC below the liver after completing liver resection (Figure 7).\nPlace a laparoscopic drainage tube (Table of Materials) at the liver resection site and exit from the right lower abdomen after confirming no active bleeding in the abdominal cavity.\nSuture all the 5-mm and 10-mm trocar incisions layer by layer.\n4. Postoperative care\nClosely monitor the patient's vital signs in the first postoperative 24 h through continuous real-time electrocardiography.\nAdminister an antibiotic intravenously for 24 h postoperatively to prevent infection.\nRemove the catheter and drainage tube after 24 h and 48-72 h postoperatively, respectively.\nPerform an enhanced CT examination on the 3rd postoperative day.\n\tNOTE: Enhanced CT showed changes after the right hepatocellular carcinoma was resected, with an indentation corresponding to the external drainage tube in the operative area (Figure 8)."
