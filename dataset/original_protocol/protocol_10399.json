    "1. Fibers\nManufacture the fibers by phase inversion spin casting (spinning). Details of this method can be found in23,24.\n\tNOTE: For this work the fibers are manufactured in-house using a non-biodegradable proprietary polymer, NMP as the solvent and H2O as the non-solvent. Details of other suitable polymers can be found in the discussion. The fibers used in the system described here are 1.05mm outer diameter with a 600-700 µm lumen diameter. The fibers are porous with pore diameters measuring 2.28 µm ± 1.5 µm (mean ± standard deviation). This is designed to separate cells from the media feed in the fiber lumen, replicating the liver sinusoid or vasculature of other tissues. Fibers can also be purchased from membrane suppliers such as Pall.\n2. Module Fabrication\nNOTE: The modules used in this study are made from 1 mm thick borosilicate glass with 2 side ports (Figure 2A). The fibers in the module described here have an outer surface area of 4.95 cm2 which is the equivalent of roughly half of a well of a 6-well plate.\nSiliconize modules before first use by coating the inner surface with Sigmacote (Table 1) and allowing to dry in a fume hood. Autoclave (121 °C, 1 atm, 20 min) to increase the life of the treatment.\nUsing a scalpel cut 75 mm-long fibers and insert three fibers into each module leaving ~7 mm excess length at each end (Figure 3A).\nPlace ~0.5 ml of silicone glue (Table 1) into a weighing boat. Use a P200 pipette tip to pick up a small amount of silicone and work the glue into the ends of the module around the fibers to form a 3-5 mm plug (Figure 3B). Allow to dry for >3 hr.",
    "Using a scalpel cut the silicone flush with the glass module ends (Figure 3C).\nWrap a small amount (~4 layers) of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape around one side port.\n3. System Setup and Sterilization\nNOTE: Pump tubing and modules with fibers are not autoclaved and are sterilized using 70% ethanol. The authors recommend calibrating the pump tubing with the pump to be used. The procedure below is carried out in a laminar flow hood.\nAutoclave (as section 2.1) all autoclavable components prior to set-up.\nSet-up\n\t\nPlace 10 ml 70% ethanol into the reservoir bottle and set-up the reservoir bottle, Q-series cap, feed tube, pump and pump tubing (Table 1) as in Figure 4.\nLoosely place an end cap over the PTFE-taped side port. Slide the ends of the L/S16 module connectors over the module ends and free side port. Connect a 40 mm section of L/S13 tubing to the module connector nearest the capped side port (Table 1) as in Figure 2B.\nConnect the module to the pump tubing, ensuring to orientate the module so the capped side port is nearest the pump.\nConnect the permeate line and retentate line to the module connectors and the L/S14 of the Y-connector on the reservoir bottle (Table 1). Ensure that the set-up resembles the schematics in Figure 4.\nSterilization\n\t\nPump ethanol through the module at 800 µl/hr (267 µl/hr per fiber) for enough time to treat unautoclaved components for >30 min (adjust times if other sterilizing methods are used; see25).\nWash",
    "To wash the ethanol out of the system, first turn off the pump and drain the tubing. First, detach the pump tubing from the module adaptor tubing. Hold the module aloft to drain the ethanol out of the fibers and retentate line, back into the reservoir bottle. Remove the side port end cap from the module to drain the ethanol from the module itself, and the permeate line. Reattach the side port end cap. Reverse the flow of media on the pump to drain the pump tubing and feed line of ethanol. Turn off the pump, and reattach the pump tubing to the module adaptor.\nUnscrew the ethanol bottle from the lid and replace with a bottle containing 10 ml of cell growth medium (such as EMEM, GMEM, DMEM or RPMI) without serum. Pump the medium through the system at 800 µl/hr until the retentate line is full of media. Clamp the retentate line to force permeation of the media through the fibers to wash the module. Wash for ~2 hr.\n4. Seeding\nNOTE: The media and supplements used in this protocol should be those that are established for the desired cell type. Please refer to the literature, the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for further information. Prior to this method cells should be maintained according to established protocols for the desired cell type. For this work the hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2/C3A subclone were maintained according to the distributors recommendations (ATCC).",
    "NOTE: The seeding protocol presented below also serves to pre-culture the module with cell culture medium prior to cell growth. Should a more extensive pre-culture be required then this should be carried out prior to seeding the module by draining the wash media from the system, replacing with growth media and permeating this through the module for few hours. See section 7.5.2.1 for details on replacing media in the system.\nPrepare a single cell suspension by trypsinization according to established protocols for the desired cell type. A general protocol for a T75 culture is as follows:\n\tNOTE: The number of cells to use in the seeding step should be empirically determined for your desired cell type. The bioreactors described here are seeded at a 35-fold higher cells density (cell/cm2) than used in 2D tissue culture plastic for a 7 day culture.\n\t\nWash the cells by adding 10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS), aspirate, then add 3 ml 0.05% trypsin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (enough to cover the cells) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nHarvest cells in 7 ml growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to neutralize the trypsin. Mix well, add 10 µl to the chamber of a hemocytometer and count the cells.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells at 4x106/ml in growth media supplemented as required for the desired cell type.\nTurn off the pump and drain the feed tube and module as in 3.4.1.\nDetach the module from the module connectors and attach module end caps (Table 1) pre-sterilized in 70% ethanol, leaving one side port free.",
    "Transfer ~500 µl of the cell suspension (2x106 cells) (4.1.4) to the module using an 18 G needle and 1 ml syringe, taking care to avoid bubble formation and not to damage the fibers.\n\t\nCap the side port using an end cap. Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2-4 hr with manual turning of the module by 180° every 5 min. Alternatively the modules can be attached to a tube rotator with an intermittent mixing setting (Table 1).\nFollowing seeding, attach an end cap onto an injection port (Table 1) pre-sterilized in 70% ethanol, and attach this to the PTFE-taped side port. Remove the other side port end cap and slowly drain the cells by injecting air into the attached injection port using a 27 G needle and 1 ml syringe.\n\t\nReplace the injection port with an end cap. Slowly fill the module with media using the free side port and an 18 G needle with a 1 ml syringe. Remove the module end caps and attach the module to the tubing using the module connectors.\nReplace the wash media bottle with one containing 50 ml growth media and supplements following the procedure detailed in 7.5.2.1. Pump the growth media through the system at 800 µl/hr.\n5. Proliferation\nNOTE: The fibers used in the research system described here are set to permeate at ~80 µl/hr, with an 800 µl/hr feed rate.\nUse the fibers to grow the cells for periods of up to 7 days in a humidified incubator set at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: Monitoring of nutrients and metabolites during the growth phase can provide useful information on the proliferation, metabolic uptake and output of the cells and nutrient and metabolite levels in the media. For example glucose usage and lactate production. Kits are available from various suppliers that can quantitate these factors from media (see Table 1 for those used in this study). Injection ports can be added to the permeate and retentate tubing and media sampled via a 27 G needle and syringe, and media can be sampled from the media reservoir bottle. This gives nutrient and metabolism information for the input and both output streams. Sampling should be carried out in a laminar flow hood. Sterilize injection ports before sampling by holding an ethanol soaked blue roll against the port for >30 sec.\n6. Excision\nNOTE: Fibers can be excised from the module at the end of an experiment for analysis.\nUnplug and drain the HFB.\nInsert a scalpel/micro knife (Table 1) blade between the glass and silicone. Turn the module so as to cut away the silicone from the glass. Repeat this procedure at both ends of the module.\nUsing the blade hook out the silicone plug from one end and gently pull. Ensure that the fibers come with it.\n7. Cell Analysis\nCell numbers\n\tNOTE: For the C3A cells used in this study any time points within the 7 day growth period are suitable for use in this calculation as growth rates do not substantially change over the cell densities achieved in this timeframe.",
    "After excision (Section 6) dip the fibers into PBS to wash and cut them into a 1.5 ml tube containing 0.5 ml Tris EDTA (TE) buffer. Subject this to two freeze-thaw cycles in a -80 °C freezer. Measure the DNA content using PicoGreen and determine cell numbers by comparing this value to a standard curve made with the desired cell type26.\nCell proliferation rates\n\t\nUsing the cell numbers calculated at two different time points calculate the specific growth rate µ (Equation 1) where Ln(X1) is the natural log of the cell number at the first time point and Ln(X2) is the natural log of the cell number at the second time point.\n\t\tµ=(Ln(X2)-Ln(X1))/time(hr)      (1)\n\t\tFrom this calculate the population doubling times (dT) (Equation 2) where µ is the specific growth rate.\n\t\tdT=Ln2/µ      (2)\nCell viability\n\t\nAfter excision (Section 6) dip the fibers into PBS to wash and cut them into a 1.5 ml tube containing 500 µl 0.05% trypsin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nMix and add 10 µl of cell suspension to 10 µl trypan blue. Load 10 µl onto a haemocytometer and count the number of dead (blue) and alive cells.\nImaging\n\t\nAfter excision dip the fibers into PBS to wash and use scissors to cut them into smaller lengths into a 24-well plate. Add 400 µl 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) and incubate at RT for 20 min.\nWash with PBS by pipetting 400 µl on and off. Repeat this step with fresh PBS.\nAdd 400 µl 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) diluted in PBS to approx. 100 ng/ml and incubate at RT for 20 min. Protect from light.",
    "Wash with PBS twice (as 7.3.2) and once with H2O. Add a fluorescence mounting medium to cover the fiber and image immediately to collect data before the samples dry (DAPI ex/em; 359/461 nm).\nTake images at different focal planes and use 'focus stacking' software (e.g., stack focuser plugin for ImageJ, below) to make a composite image showing a greatly expanded depth of field. This is required as the fibers are not flat.\n\t\t\nDownload ImageJ (http://imageJ.nih.gov/ij/) and the ‘stack-focuser’ plugin (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/stack-focuser.html).\nIn ImageJ open the images to be stacked. Then in the 'Image' menu go to 'Stacks'-'Images to Stack'. In the 'Plugins' menu go to 'Stack Focuser'. Specify an n for nxn kernel. Trial and error with 'n' may be required in order to generate an image with little 'noise'. Values between 11 & 77 tend to work well.\nAlbumin secretion\n\tNOTE: This is a hepatocyte cell function test and not a general test of cell function.\n\t\nSeed cells (HepG2/C3A) onto 2D tissue culture plastic at 10,667/cm2 and grown for 6 days. Seed HFBs as described in Section 4 and grow for 6 days.\nFollowing this proliferation period change the culture media (EMEM + 10% FBS, 1x glutamine & 1x penicillin/streptomycin) for the tissue culture plastic and HFB to a serum free Williams E media supplemented with 1x glutamine and 1x penicillin/streptomycin for 24 hr:\n\t\t\nDrain the tubing and HFB module following the steps set out in 3.4.1. Unscrew the reservoir bottle and replace this with a bottle containing the Williams E media. Pump this through the HFB at 800 µl/hr.",
    "Following 24 hr, take media samples. Quantify secreted albumin by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table 1). Dilute media samples 1 in 10 to 1 in 40 before use in order to bring albumin concentrations within the range of the standard curve."
