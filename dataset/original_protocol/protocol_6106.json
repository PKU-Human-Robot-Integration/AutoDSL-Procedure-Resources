    "Prepare vapor chamber by ensuring the pre-assembled air and vacuum lines and pressure gauges are securely connected to the air and vacuum lines for the vapor inhalation system (Figure 1).Connect ethanol delivery line to a five-gallon carboy containing 95% (v/v) ethanol and secure the cap (Figure 1A).Note: Do not use 100% ethanol, as it is toxic to animals, and do not use ethanol that is denatured or contains methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), denatonium benzoate, or benzonite.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190427/20190427195957_6004.jpgFigure 1. Assembled vapor inhalation system. A. Complete system. 95% (v/v) ethanol is delivered from a 5-gallon carboy reservoir (a) to the glass flask (b). A heating element is used to generate ethanol vapor, which is delivered to cages housed in the setup via incoming air lines. The temperature of the air delivered to the cages is not appreciably altered by this process. The amount of ethanol delivered through the air lines is controlled by the pump (c), which controls the frequency and volume of ethanol deliveries to the heated flask, where it is evaporated. Air flow is monitored via the air gauge (d). B. Close-up image of the pump. C. Close-up image of heating element, power source for heating element, and air gauge. Adjust pump settings to desired levels, based on animal weight and desired BALs.Note: These settings can be guided by a general rubric provided by the manufacturer. It is best to start at lower pump settings and gradually increase BALs over the course of the first week, rather than having rats start at a high BAL from session one (see Table 1 for an example). Further considerations for pump settings can be found in the Notes section of this protocol. Set the timer on the power strip to the desired settings.",
    "In our experiments, the ethanol pump (plugged into the power strip) is set to ON for 14 h a day, and OFF 10 h a day.Note: Vapor ON/OFF times can differ, but the experimental demands may dictate this schedule. The experimenter should be able to access animals at specific time points in the “vapor ON” and “vapor OFF” phases for measurement of BALs (at least once weekly, more often in the beginning of the exposure) and behavioral testing. For our experiments, we often set vapor ON at 6:00 PM and vapor OFF at 8:00 AM, with behavioral tests occurring at approximately 3:00 PM. Lights in our vapor room turn OFF at 8:00 AM, which means that most of the alcohol vapor exposure occurs during the light cycle and testing occurs during the dark cycle. Remove lid of the rats’ home cage, but keep the wire lid with food and water reservoirs in place. Insert cages into vapor inhalation system and secure the enclosure.Note: Never turn off incoming air to the vapor inhalation system when animals are inside the vapor inhalation system. If air pressure drops (detectable with the air gauge), remove cages immediately. When combining CIE with behavioral experiments that utilize repeatable procedures, it is ideal to collect baseline behavioral data (e.g., hindpaw withdrawal threshold using a Hargreaves apparatus for nociception, or lever pressing for operant self-administration studies; baseline data should be collected until individual behavior stabilizes to within 20% variability between sessions), and use those data to assign rats to “vapor” or “air” exposed groups that are counterbalanced for baseline behavioral data. Rats should be weighed before the first exposure to vapor and throughout the CIE procedure (e.g., twice per week). Perform vapor exposure, and monitor BALs.",
    "At the vapor OFF time point following the first session in vapor, monitor rats for intoxication by visually assessing somatic symptoms (e.g., gait, respiration, locomotion) while rats are in the homecage (e.g., Nixon and Crews, 2002). Using a razor blade, make a cut at the tip of the tail for blood collection; gently apply pressure to the length of the tail to encourage blood flow, and use a 1.5 ml microtube to collect blood from each animal (volume needed may differ based on the assay being used to measure BALs; for our experiments, we collect ~100 μl). This procedure can be performed with minimal restraint; place the rat on the experimenter’s non-dominant arm, encouraging the rat’s head to nestle in between the elbow and body, and use non-dominant hand to secure the rat’s tail. Place the rat’s tail on a sterile surface, and use the dominant hand to nick the tip of the tail. Return rats to homecage when finished collecting blood. Blood should also be collected from air-exposed controls to match for the stress of this procedure.Note: Microtubes containing heparin or other anticoagulant may be used; these should not interfere with BAL measurement using the Analox system (Step 7). Each time a change is made to alcohol pump settings, blood should be collected to measure BALs at that new setting. This procedure should be repeated until rats achieve the desired BAL range (in our work, typically 150-200 mg/dl). After the target BAL range is achieved, BALs should be measured at least once weekly thereafter to detect and account for metabolic tolerance and/or potential drift in settings. Adjustments will likely be needed as rats develop metabolic tolerance for alcohol following repeated exposures. If combining with behavioral experiments, perform tail bleeds on days when animals are not being tested.",
    "Air-exposed controls should be handled and bled on a schedule that is matched to alcohol vapor-exposed rats. Centrifuge blood samples at 9,500 x g for 12 min at room temperature to separate serum from blood. Determine BALs by running serum samples on an Analox AM1 analyzer, using a reconstituted alcohol oxidase/buffer reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An ethanol standard, used to calibrate the Analox prior to running serum samples, should be as close as possible to the anticipated range of BALs. In our experiments, we prepare a 100 mg/dl standard by adding 62.5 μl 100% (v/v) ethanol to 50 ml DI H2O. Standard solutions should be prepared frequently (at least every 1-2 weeks) to ensure accurate concentration.Note: If animals are extremely impaired (e.g., loss of locomotor activity, loss of muscle tone, no reaction to touch), this likely indicates extremely high BALs (can be confirmed by measuring BALs). If this exposure level is not the aim of the study, animals should be removed from alcohol vapor overnight to allow BALs to return to zero before the start of the next exposure. Consult with veterinary staff if additional intervention is necessary (e.g., saline administration if rat appears dehydrated; liquefied food if unable to eat solid food; placing on a heating pad if body temperature decreases; pharmacological treatment if severe withdrawal symptoms [e.g., seizures] are present). Adjust pump settings as necessary to reduce BALs. If unable to access an Analox AM1 analyzer, alternate methods for measuring BALs, such as commercially available enzymatic assays and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, are available. If alternate methods are utilized, adjust the blood collection procedure (e.g., sample storage, centrifuge settings) as necessary. Monitor rats throughout the CIE period. Assess rats daily for general health and well-being by visually observing behavior.",
    "Check food and water amounts daily, and refill when necessary. Replace bedding once weekly, on non-test days.Note: Vapor delivery to the cage generally does not result in wet food or bedding; in the event of condensation buildup, transfer animals to a clean, dry cage, and replace food and bedding. Withdrawal symptom severity can be assessed by the experimenter using desired metrics. While described in greater detail elsewhere (Majchrowicz, 1975; Faingold, 2008), symptoms that manifest during the withdrawal period, as BALs approach 0, can range from mild (e.g., general hyperactivity) to more severe (e.g., convulsive seizures). In the event of seizures, animals may be treated with a benzodiazepine or returned to alcohol vapor to relieve symptoms. It is best to consult with your institution’s veterinarian to develop an intervention plan prior to initiating experiments.   A very rough estimation of the rate at which rats typically metabolize ethanol is approximately 25 mg/dl/h. Tests or tissue collection intended to access the intoxication or withdrawal stages should be scheduled accordingly (i.e., when BALs are peaking or equal to zero). For example, rats being tested for acute withdrawal effects might be maintained in a target range of 150-200 mg/dl and tested or sacrificed at 6-8 h after vapor OFF. Following completion of the experiment, turn the vapor inhalation system off. Clean cages with a mild detergent (e.g., Liquinox), and allow all components (cages and air/vacuum hoses) to completely dry."
