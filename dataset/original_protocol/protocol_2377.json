Given the length of apoptosis induction, we recommend that this step be carried out at the night before conditioned media collection and apoV separation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2011-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the protocol\nThe mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) undergo apoptosis induction (1) and the conditioned media is collected for separation of apoVs via gradient centrifugation (2). After (1) and (2), apoVs are characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunoblotting. Some figure elements were created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nCritical: This section should be performed under sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet.\nPut the apoptosis-inducing solution and PBS into a 37°C water bath for pre-heating.\nAspirate the complete culture medium.\nAdd 5 mL pre-warmed PBS to rinse the cells for 10 s, and then aspirate the PBS.\nRepeat step 3 once.\nNote: All rinsing steps should be performed gently so as to avoid cell detachment.\nAdd 5 mL pre-warmed apoptosis-inducing solution to each dish and incubate the cells in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 12 h.\nNote: We recommend approximately 12 h of apoptosis induction for MSCs so that ∼90% cells can undergo apoptosis and release apoVs for separation. Moreover, the maximum duration of apoptosis induction is recommended not to exceed 16 h.\nCritical: The duration of apoptosis induction depends on the sensitivity of the cells to the apoptosis-inducing solution. Pre-experiment is needed to determine the induction time length for a specific type of cells.\nSeparation of apoVs\nTiming: 1 h for collecting conditioned media; 5 h for separation of apoVs",
    "This major step describes the isolation of apoVs from the conditioned media via differential centrifugation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCritical: This section should be performed in a sterile biosafety cabinet.\nWhen ∼90% cells undergo apoptosis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), flush the cells thoroughly with pipetting the conditioned media to detach all apoptotic cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2011-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Microscopy images of the cells undergoing apoptosis\n(A and B) Microscopy images comparing the morphology of the cells undergoing apoptosis (B) versus the control (A). The morphological characteristics of apoptosis include intercellular connection disappearance, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and fragmentation into membrane-bound vesicles. Scale bars, 100 μm (left and middle) and 20 μm (right).\nNote: It is recommended that the cells be observed under an inverted microscope for evaluation of apoptosis. The morphological characteristics of apoptosis include intercellular connection disappearance, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and fragmentation into membrane-bound vesicles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTransfer the supernatant, together with detached cells, to a sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube on ice.\nRinse each dish with 2 mL cold PBS, and transfer the PBS to the same centrifuge tube (Each tube contains 7 mL of liquid).\nPlace the centrifuge tubes in a centrifuge.\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 800 × g at 4°C to remove the cells and cell debris (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2011-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: All centrifugation steps should be performed at 4°C. The samples and reagents need to be kept on ice.\nCritical: Before centrifugation, centrifugal tubes with liquid in the same volume should be placed in a symmetrical position in the centrifuge.\nCollect the sample supernatant with a pipette and discard the precipitation containing cells and cell debris (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nDivide the supernatant into five 1.5 mL EP tubes.\nPlace the EP tubes in a centrifuge.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: When collecting the supernatant, 5 mm supernatant in height above the precipitate can be retained to prevent precipitation from being sucked up.\nCritical: The EP tubes should be placed with the cap uniformly oriented towards the center of the rotor, so that the separated apoVs will remain at the bottom of a specific side of the EP tubes.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL cold PBS to each tube and gently resuspend the pellet for sample cleaning by pipetting.\nMerge the suspension of every five EP tubes into one EP tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: When removing the supernatant, the EP tubes can be tilted to make the supernatant parallel to the precipitation so as to avoid unnecessary loss of apoVs (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL cold PBS to each tube and gently resuspend the pellet for sample cleaning by pipetting.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant, and re-suspend the precipitate with the corresponding solvent (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The precipitation is the apoVs. (If the yield of apoVs is low or unstable please read troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1–2).",
    "Re-suspend the precipitate separated from one dish with 50 μL cold PBS and store at 4°C for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) analysis.\nRe-suspend the precipitate separated from one dish with 50 μL cold PBS and store at 4°C for TEM analysis.\nRe-suspend the precipitates separated from two dishes with 50 μL lysis buffer, incubate on the ice for 30 min and store at −80°C for Western blotting (WB) analysis.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Tilting the EP tubes, related to step 12\nCharacterization of apoVs: Nanoparticle tracking analysis\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: The NTA protocol below is specifically for the microscope model PMX-120. NTA measurement using different machine will need different protocol.\nNTA is used for measuring the amount and size of apoVs by capturing the movies of apoV particles that move under Brownian motion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTake 10 μL of the 50 μL sample, and dilute to 10 mL with PBS.\nNote: The samples should be maintained on ice during transportation.\nUse a sterile 10 mL syringe to inject at least 5 mL ddH2O to flush the ZetaView® BASIC NTA machine channel at a constant speed (0.5 mL/s to 1 mL/s), until the number of particles displayed on the detection interface is less than 10 (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nPrepare calibration solution (diluted at 1:250,000).\nDilute 1 μL calibration solution provided with the NTA machine to 1 mL with ddH2O.\nTake 100 μL and dilute to 25 mL with ddH2O.\nNote: The calibration solution needs to be freshly prepared immediately before use.\nUse a sterile 10 mL syringe to inject at least 5 mL calibration solution to flush the machine channel (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: Maintain a uniform and stable flow during the injection process so as to avoid the formation of bubbles.",
    "When the number of particles displayed on the detection interface is between 50-400 (preferably around 200), run the calibration program (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nRepeat step 16 to clean the machine channel (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nUse a sterile 10 mL syringe to inject at least 5 mL buffer solution (PBS) to flush the machine channel at a constant speed (0.5 mL/s to 1 mL/s), until the number of particles displayed on the detection interface is less than 10 (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]).\nSlowly inject the sample into the machine channel (at least 2 mL) using a sterile 1 mL syringe (Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).\nNote: Before injection, hold the syringe upright and tap the side gently to drain the bubbles in the sample.\nNote: For samples with an optimum particle concentration, the number of particles displayed on the detection interface should be between 50-400 (preferably around 200).\nCritical: If the reading is too high, repeat step 16 immediately to avoid particles retention at the channel wall. Use PBS to further dilute the sample, and when the number of particles displayed on the detection interface is less than 10, repeat step 21–22.\nConduct particle capture analysis and generate analysis report. (If contaminants are found in NTA please read troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3).\nRepeat step 21 to clean the sample in the channel.\nRepeat step 16 to clean the PBS in the channel.\nUse a sterile 10 mL syringe to inject at least 10 mL air at a constant speed (0.5 mL/s to 1 mL/s) to remove the ddH2O in the channel.\nNote: If multiple samples need to be analyzed, carry out step 20–23 above in sequence.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Injecting the sample, related to step 22\nCharacterization of apoVs: Transmission electron microscope analysis\nTiming: 4 h\nTEM is used for analyzing the size and morphology of apoVs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nDrop 10 μL of the 50 μL sample onto a copper mesh and incubate for 10 min at 25°C. Remove excess liquid with filter paper.\nNote: In order to ensure that single particles can be observed, the sample concentration should be adjusted and the suspension should be clear without obvious turbidity. The sample used here is diluted at 1:1,000. However, the dilution of different cells should be determined by the preliminary experiment.\nNote: Before dropping, mix the suspension well and pipette from the middle of the liquid.\nCritical: Pay attention to dropping the sample to the front side of the copper mesh.\nRinse the copper mesh in 100 μL sterile ddH2O and remove excess liquid with filter paper. Repeat this step for another two times.\nNote: Use electron microscope tweezers to clamp the edge of the copper mesh, and immerse the front side downward into ddH2O to rinse it.\nNegatively stain the copper mesh by immersing the front side in 2% uranyl acetate solution for 1 min at 25°C, and remove the excess liquid with filter paper.\nRepeat step 28.",
    "Remove excess liquid with filter paper and put the copper mesh on a new filter paper to dry it under an incandescent lamp for 2 min or at room temperature (25°C) for 10 min.\nObserve the copper mesh under a TEM operating at 100 kV and imaged with a digital camera.

(If the morphology of apoVs is not typical please read troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 4).\nCharacterization of apoVs: Immunoblotting analysis\nTiming: 24 h\nThe protein concentration of apoVs is quantified via the BCA assay and the expression levels of specific markers for apoVs are detected via WB (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Methods for determination of protein concentration can be selected according to laboratory conditions, such as using Qubit protein quantification assay (Hu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This protocol only provides a relatively simple and common determination method.\nCentrifuge the lysates (the sample obtained at step 14c) at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5 mL EP tube.\nNote: Place all the samples on the ice during the operation.\nPreparation of 0.5 mg/mL BSA standard solution.\nDilute 0.5 mg/mL BSA standard solution with normal saline to a serial concentration.\nAdd 20 μL of standard solution at different concentrations into each standard well of the 96-well plate, and add 2 μL sample and 18 μL normal saline into each sample well of the 96-well plate.\nNote: Be careful when adding to the microplate so as to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nMix BCA reagent A and BCA reagent B in a 50 : 1 ratio to make the needed amount of working solution.\nNote: It is recommended that the working solution be prepared right before use.",
    "Add 200 μL working solution to each well, and incubate the 96-well plate in an incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nPut the 96-well plate into the microplate reader and measure the optical density (OD) value at the wavelength of 562 nm.\nEstablish the standard curve according to the OD data and calculate the protein concentration of each sample.\nAccording to the results, dilute the samples to 1 μg/μL with normal saline and 5 × loading buffer.\nSeal the tubes with parafilm and heat them at 95°C for 5 min.\nLoad equal protein mass per sample onto a precast 4%–20% (wt/vol) TGX stain-free gel.\nNote: Choose the gel percentage according to the molecular weight of the proteins of interest.\nRun the SDS-PAGE at 80 V for the concentrated gel and 120 V for the separation gel.\nNote: The purpose of this step is to resolve the proteins based on their sizes.\nNote: The running time may vary according to the equipment or percentage of gel.\nTransfer the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using a wet transfer system for 120 min at 200 mA.\nNote: The PVDF membrane needs to be rinsed shortly (20 s) in methanol immediately before transferring.\nBlock the membrane in 1 × TBST containing 5% BSA for 2 h at 25°C with gentle shaking.\nNote: The 1 × TBST is obtained by diluting the 10 × TBST with ddH2O.\nIncubate the membrane with the primary antibodies diluted in 1 × TBST at 4°C for 12–16 h with gentle shaking.\nThe anti-Caspase-3 antibody that detects both full length Caspase-3 and Cleaved Caspase 3 is used at a 1:1,000 dilution as specific markers for apoptotic products (Nicholson et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).",
    "Wash the membrane in 1 × TBST for 10 min at 25°C on a shaker.
