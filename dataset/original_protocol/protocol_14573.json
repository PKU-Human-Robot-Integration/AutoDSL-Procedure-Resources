    "All procedures and manipulations of animals have been approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of The Cleveland Clinic in accordance with the United States Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Animals, and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Preparations:\nFluorescent Dye for Labeling Platelets\nPrepare rhodamine 6G solution, 0.5 mg/ml, in saline and sterilize the solution with 0.22 µm filter.\nFeCl3 Solution\nMake a fresh stock solution of 30% FeCl3 (Anhydrous, equals 1.85 M) in pure water, and filter with 0.45 µm filter. Prepare 5 ml fresh FeCl3 solution at the desired concentration [e.g., 2.5% (0.154 M), 5% (0.308 M), 7.5% (0.463 M), 10% (0.617 M) and 12.5% (0.771 M)] by diluting the 30% FeCl3 solution with water in a 6 cm tissue culture dish and keep the lid closed.\nNOTE: Using the culture dish makes it easier to pick up the filter paper saturated with FeCl3 solution than to pick it up from a narrow container, such as a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.  FeCl3 is extremely hazardous and that precautions, such as wearing gloves and lab coat etc., Personal Protective Equipment, should always be taken.\nFilter Papers\nCut the filter paper to 1 mm x 2 mm size. Soak enough pieces of the cut filter paper in the FeCl3 solution in the same dish.\nPapaverine Hydrochloride Solution\nPrepare papaverine hydrochloride solution (25 mg/ml) in water and sterilize the solution with 0.22 µm filter.\nAgarose Gel\nPrepare 2% agarose gel in PBS or saline in 6-well tissue culture plate, ~ 1 cm thickness, and cut it to half-circle with ~ 3 cm diameter.\n2. FeCl3 Induced Carotid Arterial Injury Thrombosis Model\nSurgical Procedures for the Thrombosis Model",
    "Use 8 - 12 weeks old C57Bl6 mice (or other strains as necessary). Anesthetize mice with the mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Confirm the depth of the anesthesia by toe pinching.\nNOTE: This amount of ketamine/xylazine is sufficient to keep the animal in stable anesthesia and no pain (response to toe pinching) for at least 1 hr.\nRemove fur on the neck and upper chest with a small animal electric clipper. Depilatory cream is not necessary. Apply neutral petroleum eye ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nSecure the mouse in the supine position on the lid of 15 cm tissue culture plate. Use one long tape (~ 10 cm) to secure hind limbs and lower body, and two pieces of small tape (2 cm x 0.5 cm) to secure forelegs. Use a 4-0 suture to wrap around the incisors, tape the two ends of the suture to the lid to keep mouse neck straight (Figure 2).\nPlace plate with mouse head toward the operator under a surgical light source.\nSterilize the surgical site with alcohol pad. Use the Micro-Adson Forceps to hold the skin and use a surgical scissors to make a small incision (2 - 3 mm).\nHold the skin of the incision with the forceps and insert surgical scissors with jaws closed into the incision. Push the scissors subcutaneously toward the manubrium or chin, and then open the scissors to free the skin from the subcutaneous layer.\nCut the skin with the surgical scissors to make a midline incision from the manubrium to the level of hyoid bone (Figure 3A and 3B). Bluntly dissect the thin fascia (dotted line, in Figure 3B) between the submaxillary glands with a fine hemostat and a Graefe forceps (Figure 3B and 3C; blue arrows).",
    "NOTE: The manubrium (black arrow in Figure 3C) and the trachea (T in Figure 3C) will be seen after this step.\nHold the soft tissue and the skin seen at the right of the manubrium with the Graefe forceps, insert the hemostat under the fascia toward the 2 o'clock position (yellow dotted line in Figure 3C), open the jaws of the hemostat to free the jugular vein from surrounding tissue.\nCut the fascia, soft tissue and skin toward the 2 o'clock position (Figure 3C) with the surgical scissors to expose the right jugular vein (Figure 3D, arrow).\nDraw about 200 - 300 µl rhodamine 6G solution using a 1 ml syringe with 22 G needle, and then change it to 30 G needle.\nNOTE: This protects the 30 G needle from damage of its fine tip.  Directly drawing the rhodamine 6G solution with the 30 G needle will not damage the tip; however touching the container wall accidentally will cause damage, which may make injection difficult.\nFlush the 30 G needle by slowly pushing out the rhodamine 6G solution, make sure no air bubbles remain in the syringe or the needle. Keep 100 µl rhodamine 6G solution for injection.\nBend 2 - 3 mm tip of the needle to a 90° angle with the needle holder, which will prevent inserting the needle too deep to the jugular vein and makes the injection more easily controlled (Figure 3D).\nInject the rhodamine 6G solution into the right jugular vein to label platelets. To stabilize the syringe and keep the needle in position, hold the syringe with one hand and the needle with the Graefe forceps with another hand during the injection.After injection, clamp the injection site with the Graefe forceps to avoid bleeding.",
    "Open the jaws of the hemostat and insert it under the Graefe forceps to clamp the vessel wall of the injection site, and then ligate the injection site with a 6-0 suture.\nNOTE: As an alternative of step 2.1.15, applying pressure to the injection site with a finger for 2 min will stop the bleeding; however, this method has a risk of causing further bleeding if the clot at the injection site is removed accidently.\nBluntly dissect the soft tissue and fascia around the left submaxillary gland with the hemostat and the Graefe forceps and pull the gland toward the 7 o'clock position (Figure 3E) to expose the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (blue arrow in Figure 3E).\nBluntly dissect the fascia (Figure 3E, dotted line) between the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle or the sternohyoid muscle (Figure 3E, green arrow) located to the left site of the trachea with the hemostat.\nPass a needle with 6-0 silk suture (about 15 cm long) under the middle of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (blue arrow in Figure 3E), put the two ends of the suture together and pull the suture laterally toward the 10 o'clock position.\nNOTE: This procedure should be performed carefully to avoid injury of the left jugular vein, which is located outside of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nBluntly separate the thin sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle to expose the carotid artery (CA) (Figure 3F arrow) after pulling away the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut the sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle as necessary. Use the hemostat to separate the soft tissue from CA without touching the CA.",
    "NOTE: CA is accompanied by the vagus nerve, the white structure seen in Figure 3G (green arrow), and in most cases it is under the thin sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle (between the yellow dotted lines in Figure 3F).\nUse a fine tip forceps to pick up the lateral fascia around the CA while avoiding the vagus nerve and CA. Use another fine tip forceps to punch a hole on the fascia between the CA and vagus nerve.\nPass the hook through the hole and gently lift the CA, and then place the fine tip forceps under the CA. Move the hook and forceps in opposite directions along the CA to strip adventitial soft tissue. Free at least ~ 5 mm length of CA (Figure 3H, blue arrow) from surrounding tissue.\nTo block background fluorescence, press the end of a black plastic coffee stirrer to flat, crosscut the coffee stirrer into a 3 mm piece, and then cut longitudinally along the fold edges to get two pieces of \"U\" shape plastic (Figure 3H, green arrow).\nRinse one piece of this \"U\" shape plastic with saline and hold it with forceps and place it under the CA while gently lifting the CA with the hook (Figure 3H, green arrow). Immediately apply 2-3 drops of saline to avoid drying the CA.\nReal time Recording Video\nTransfer the mouse and plate lid together to the microscope stage and place in an appropriate position under the 10X water lens. Fill the space between the 10X lens and the CA with saline.\nStart the digital video recording software application, and launch a new file and name it accordingly. Record normal vessel images and write down the frame number when the video recording is stopped.",
    "NOTE: Reference the video recording software in the computer for recording. We use digital video recording software and the following descriptions are based on this application. \nNOTE: Since mechanical trauma can injure the endothelium and lead to thrombus formation20, it is necessary to confirm that there is no surgical injury to the vessel wall prior to the FeCl3 injury. It is also necessary to confirm that there is no remaining tissue around the CA, which may form a barrier and attenuate the effect of FeCl3-induced injury. Write down the frame number of the records will make it easy to analyze the videos according elapsed times later.\nMove the mouse with plate lid out of the 10X lens. Fold a corner of a paper towel to make a thin and fine tip and use it to carefully blot the saline around the CA (avoid touching CA) as well as in other places in the surgical field. This is important to avoid dilution of the FeCl3 solution used.\nUse a fine tip forceps and pick up a piece of filter paper saturated with FeCl3 solution and place it directly on the CA and keep it on site for 1 min.\nNOTE: To aid visualization of the bloodstream and harvest accurate data, place the filter paper close to the distal end of the exposed CA (Figure 3I) and leave a short segment at the proximal site (green arrow in Figure 3I) for observing blood flow at late phase (see below).\nRemove the filter paper (this time point is defined as the start of “after injury”) and rinse the CA with saline (at least 2 ml).",
    "Put the mouse with plate lid back to the 10X lens; observe the vessel and start to record video images. Write down the video frame number at the end of the first minute of recording.\nNOTE: Thrombus formation is identified by accumulation of the fluorescent platelets, which is observed in real-time video images on computer screen or under microscope. Record video images immediately after putting the mouse back under the microscope. Keep recording to the end of the first minute after removing the filter paper. Observe the entire vessel from the distal to the proximal sites to obtain information about the injury, and then focus on the area of interest (usually is the center of the injured area) for further imaging.\nRecord video images for 10 sec every minute for the first 10 min (e.g., 2:55 to 3:05) and then 10 sec every other minute until the end of the experiment. Write down the frame numbers when each recording is stopped.",
    "NOTE: The end points of the model are: 1) when blood flow has ceased for >  30 sec; or 2) if occlusion is not seen in 30 min after injury. In this case, use 30 min for statistical analysis. Set Exposure Time of the video record as 10 msec at the beginning, so it will be easy to observe the blood flow over the thrombi. When the thrombi become large and the fluorescence saturates the camera’s sensor, it becomes difficult to identify the blood flow over thrombi. To solve this issue, move the imaging center to the proximal uninjured site (Figure 3I, green arrow) where blood flow can still be clearly observed. We also increase the Expose Time to 15 or 20 msec when focusing on the proximal un-injured site, so the blood flow can be observed more clearly. When blood flow will cease, numerous larger cells (leukocytes) start to roll on the vessel wall at the proximal site of the thrombus. Flow usually stops within 2 - 3 min after the appearance of the large cells. Write down the Expose Time on the recording sheet if it is changed. It usually takes about 30 min from the anesthesia to the end of the experiment, if the normal wild type C57Bl6 mice were used.\nCAUTION NOTE: Don't use the white aggregated platelet clot as the sign of the blood flow cessation, which will not give an accurate data and it is affected by the exposure time. The white clot covered the vessel lumen does not mean blood flow ceased (see the representative video 1).\nAt the end of experiment, euthanize the mice using overdose ketamine/xylazine (200/20 mg/Kg), followed by cervical dislocation after confirming no breath and heartbeat.\n3. FeCl3 Induced Mesenteric Artery/Vein Thrombosis Model",
    "Anesthetize 8 − 12 week old C57Bl6 mice as mentioned in section 2.1.1. Apply vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nInject Papaverine solution (total 0.4 mg/mouse) intraperitoneally to inhibit gut peristalsis.\nRemove fur on the neck and abdomen with an animal electric clipper. Depilatory cream is not necessary.\nSecure the mouse in the supine position on the lid of 15 cm tissue culture plate. Use four pieces of small tape (2 cm x 0.5 cm) to secure all legs. Use a 4 -0 suture to wrap around the incisors, tape the two ends of the suture to the lid to keep the neck straight (Figure 2).\nFollow procedures 2.1.4 - 2.1.15 to expose the jugular vein for injection of rhodamine 6G to label platelets.\nPerform a midline incision through the skin from xiphoid to lower abdomen using the surgical scissors (Figure 4A). Pick up the middle peritoneum (also called linea alba, Figure 4A, arrow) with Graefe forceps, which is clear and has no blood vessels, lift about 2 - 3 mm high, confirm no bowel under the cutting line, and cut the peritoneum open longitudinally with the fine scissors (Figure 4B).\nRe-secure the mice to right lateral position. Place the half-circle agarose gel close to the abdomen, and gently exteriorize the intestines and spread it on the top of the gel with the Graefe forceps (Figure 4C). Use the second branches for the thrombosis experiment (Figure 4C, arrow).\nNOTE: Use the hemostat or Micro-Adson forceps to help to exteriorize the intestines. Avoid hurting the bowel and the vessel.\nPlace 5 - 6 drops saline to keep the moisture of the bowel and vessel. Transfer the mouse with the plate lid together to the microscope stage and place in appropriate position under the 10X dry lens.",
    "NOTE: Use a dry lens because the jejunoileal membrane cannot hold saline solution. Make sure to drop saline solution on the exposed tissues to keep them moist.\nBlot the saline around the mesenteric artery and vein before treatment.\nUse a fine tip forceps to pick up a piece of filter paper saturated with 12.5% FeCl3 solution and place it directly on the mesenteric artery and vein for 1 min (Figure 4D).  Remove the filter paper (this time point is defined as the start of “after injury”) and rinse the injured mesenteric artery and vein with saline (at least 2 ml).  \nPut the mouse with plate lid back under the 10X dry lens; observe the vessels and start to record video images as mentioned in 2.2).\nNOTE: The end points of this experiment are: 1) when blood flow has ceased for > 30 sec; or 2) if occlusion is not seen in 30 min after injury, and in this case use 30 min for statistical analysis.\nAt the end of experiment, euthanize the mice using overdose ketamine/xylazine (200/20 mg/Kg), followed by cervical dislocation after no breath and heart beating are confirmed.\nSubscription Required.
