    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEME sample collection, storage, shipping and concentration estimate\nTiming: hours to days\nThis step is dedicated to environmental sample collection, storage, target species concentration estimates, enrichment and viability tests. It requires knowledge of the ecological niche or the habitat of the taxa of interest.\nCollect a small amount of the sample in its original environment and prevent contamination with non-native microorganisms, e.g., from the lab, equipment, hands etc.\nPrepare: laboratory gloves, disinfecting solution (either 70% ethanol, 70% isopropanol or 15% bleach), collection gear (sterile pipettes or 50 mL plastic tubes), sterile storage labware (depending on your sample type and its condition choose one as appropriate: 50 mL plastic tubes, Eppendorf tubes, screw cap tubes, dark tubes, bags.)\nPut on the gloves, disinfect them and, using any convenient collection method (e.g., pipette, 50 mL tube), place an aliquot of the environment in which the taxa of interest are present in the sterile storage labware.\nKeep the sample at the same temperature, humidity and light condition that was in its natural environment as much as possible to avoid drastic changes that may affect viability and concentration of target organisms: Bring the sample to the laboratory. Keep it in its original conditions. Examine the sample under the microscope and determine your target environmental microbial eukaryote (EME) concentration using a hemocytometer. Take a picture of your target EME at small and high magnification. If the target EME cannot be distinguished visually from other organisms in their environment proceed to step 4. For examples of such samples see our paper (Ciobanu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFreeze-thaw viability and cell integrity test. This step is optional and is necessary if the sample will have to be shipped long distance or stored long term.",
    "Take three 500 μL aliquots of your sample and put each in a pre-sterilized 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAliquot one: place on ice for 15–30 min; move to −20°C for 30 min; move to −80°C for 24 h–168 h.\nAliquot two: add sterile Glycerol to 30% final concentration (± 10% variation is ok) dropwise, slowly in a sterile hood. Do not vortex, do not shake, use a wide tip (1–5 mL) gently pipette 2–5 times, no more. When glycerol is fully dissolved place the aliquot on ice and transfer to −80°C for 24 h–168 h.\nAliquot three: place the aliquot at −80°C in a pre-chilled container for 24 h–168 h.\nPause point: This is a pause point, do not exceed 7 days.\nThaw all three aliquots at the same time. Thaw each at 20°C–21°C, unless the original sample was collected at temperatures lower than 15°C. In this case, thaw the aliquots on ice and keep on ice.\nUsing a hemocytometer calculate your target EME concentration after thawing.\nCompare the concentration before freezing and after thawing.\nIf the concentration of the target EME after thawing in any of the aliquots is lower than 20% from the original sample, that freezing method is not suitable for storage and transportation.\nIf one of the above methods has the same concentration with the pre-frozen sample, within 20% variation, it can be used for storage at −80°C and transportation on dry ice.\nIf none of the above methods is suitable, the sample has to be stored either at 4°C (if collected at 0°C–15°C in its native environment) or 20°C–21°C if collected above 15°C. The 4°C samples can be transported on ice. The 20°C–21°C samples should be transported at 20°C–21°C. Note: 20°C–21°C samples should be processed as fast as possible, or enriched for the EME.",
    "Pause point: The next step can be done on the same day as collection or at a later date, e.g. prior to FACS sorting.\nTarget EME concentration enrichment\nIf the target EME concentration in your sample is less than 103/mL and the environment is rich in other organisms, proceed to point b. If the target EME concentration is above 103/mL, collect enough volume of sample to amount to 106–1024 total target EME and store as determined to be optimal in step 2.\nUse the appropriate filtration system (e.g., Cell strainers) to filter out the most abundant non-target population by size. Do not use gradient centrifugation for this purpose! Avoid vacuum filtration, best practice is to use gravity to filter out the larger and the smaller populations.\nPause point: The next step can be done on the first day of collection or at a later date.\nTarget EME operational taxonomic unit (OTU) identification and abundance estimation via ribosomal DNA genes.\nDissolve a sample aliquot of 50–100 μL in 1 mL of Milli-Q 0.1–0.2 μM filter-sterilized water. If sample amount is restricted or expected concentration of the target is very high 106/mL or more, a 2 μL in 100 μL of water can be used.\nBoil for 2 min to release the DNA into solution, cool on ice.",
    "Prepare sufficient amount of PCR master mix for each rDNA gene primer-pair to be used (e.g., 16S universal for prokaryotes, 18S universal for eukaryotes, 18S, 28S, ITS for fungi, protists and other eukaryotes) in triplicate. Keep on ice. In separate thin-wall 200 μL tubes or appropriate plates for the instrument used, aliquot 7 μL of master mix. Add 1 μL of boiled and chilled DNA to each well/tube. Add 1 μL 10 μM each primer from each primer pair to each reaction. For primers and their amplification conditions see steps 25–31, OTU identification: rDNA gene qPCR and screening, further down.\nPrepare one NGS Illumina or PacBio library per primer pair, using manufacturer instructions. Follow sequencing instructions. For rDNA analysis see steps 37–38.\nCritical: Do not swap sterilization method, where specified (e.g. filtration with autoclave). Avoid unnecessary shaking, vortexing, centrifugation, and change in chemistry, unless specified otherwise.\nSingle-cell FACS isolation and target enrichment\nTiming: 5–16 h\nThis step is dedicated to isolating pure single-cells of the target organisms from its habitat for subsequent whole-genome isolation and De-novo assembly. We also describe how to enrich for poorly represented organisms’ populations. The isolation is done via a Fluorescently Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) instrument (here is described the BD Influx™ Cell Sorter, see instrument manual BD Influx™ Cell Sorter User’s Guide (2011)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for additional details that are not in the protocol below). Necessary adaptations to another cell-sorter can be done following the specific instrument user guide or a trained technician who uses the instrument. For example, Wolf G2 cell sorter is significantly easier to use and steps 7 and 8 are automated and take 1 h. Many other steps are also simplified. BD-Influx is the least automated instrument. Italicized are the names of the buttons to be pressed.",
    "Sterilize the fluid lines of the cell sorter used and prepare sterile sheath fluid. This step can be done in the evening of the day before sorting.\nPrepare 1000 mL 10% Bleach solution using a 0.2 μM filtration system. using the tank reserved for bleach ( not the single-cell fluid tank), Run for 1 h 30 min through the lines. Between 500 mL to 700 mL bleach will be used, the rest can be used to wipe clean the working surfaces, store it in a sterile container.\nPrepare 2000 mL autoclave Milli-Q water. Prepare 1000 mL of filter-sterilized Milli-Q water. Use autoclaved H2O to rinse the tank from bleach, 500 mL three times. Run the 1000 mL filter-sterilized H2O through the fluid lines that have been sterilized with bleach. Put on Rinse until the lines dry out completely. Remove the tip and continue until no water comes out. Shut down, if this is done the evening before the sorting, otherwise proceed to the next step without shutting down the instrument.\nPlace the clean (can be rinsed with the filtered Milli-Q water) tank for single-cell sheath fluid in the UV- hood opened with the lid inside out. Turn on UV lamp for over-night for UV-decontamination.\nPause point: Can be stopped here until next day.\nInstrument calibration and fluidics optimization for sterile sorting\nUV-sterilize the sorting area if it is enclosed. Otherwise, spray with sterile 70% Ethanol and let dry. The plates may need to be wiped clean with 70% ethanol if there are salt residues after the previous sort. Wiping the sorting area with ethanol using sterile wipes also helps reduce static that can affect deflection of the stream.",
    "Prepare 3–5 L of 0.2 μM filter-sterilized PBS at 1× or 0.5× concentration from a 10× stock solution (can be non-sterile). This sheath-fluid solution is suitable for all fresh-water and soil organisms. If you are sorting marine or ocean organisms, filter-sterilize the sea or ocean water. In this case, you may have to do several rounds of filtration to remove first the large debris with a larger filter. Final filtration should be 0.2 μM sterile filter if sorting organisms larger than 1 μM or 0.01 μM filtration systems for ultra-small organisms.\nSonicate (at medium power) the sorting tip in 1% Alconox solution for 5 min. Use a 3 mL–10 mL syringe to check if the fluid moves free through the tip, using sterile water or sheath-fluid. Hold the tip with sterile forceps. If it is hard to hold the tip with the forceps, install the tip into the metal threaded holder.\nNote: Repeat sonication if the tip is clogged or later the stream is not perfectly vertical.\nClose the UV-ed tank from step 7c in the hood. Turn on scale and ZERO tare with empty tank on. Return the tank to the clean hood and wipe clean with 70% ethanol. Open the tank inside the hood. Pour the filter sterilized PBS sheath fluid into the UV-sterilized tank. Cover the tank in the clean hood. Connect lines to sheath and waste tanks. Record weight of full tank for later use.\nTurn on air & vacuum pump & check pressure in tanks: Sheath tank pressure should be 15 psi, Waste tank pressure should be 10–15 Hg.",
    "Note: If sheath tank below system pressure or waste <15 Hg, check and reseat fittings and lids. Adjust sample pressure and sheath pressure using the knobs on the far-right side to 16 and 16.8 respectively. Sample pressure should be greater than tank pressure, but not by >1 psi.\nTurn on electronics (red switch under the Influx table top –not computer table), computer and laser(s) – 488 nm: switch & key on control box (between Influx table and computer table. When the Ready light is on turn laser power up to 98% (098 – in the screen) – not necessary to do it, or keep it on if not using the laser for a long time.\nRinse briefly without tip to fill fluid lines – do not overflow the receptacle basin. Replace tip. Run with tip in place for a couple minutes.\nNote: Repeat sonication if the stream is not perfectly vertical.\nImmerse tip into 70% EtOH (helps disrupt surface tension necessary for air bubble removal) using a 50 mL Nunc orange cap, set on top of small black waste basin. Turn off Run when the tip is immersed to prevent air getting inside.\nPurge lines to de-bubble, using Pulse button and flicking lines – make sure tip stays immersed or air will be pulled in and you have to restart de-bubbling.\nStop Purge, press Run, & immediately remove the orange cap. Absorb droplets formed on the outside of the tip using the corner of a wipe.",
    "Turn on Illum – button on the top part of the screen. Check the stream alignment (far top right window) relative to the drain cup (bottom) and relative to the 3 pinholes – stream should be centered and in focus in both windows. If the stream is not aligned properly, adjust position of the stream and position of the camera (pinhole area) using brass knobs on nozzle assembly in the center: Silver knobs help adjust and keep the stream in focus, black knobs move it sideways and front/back. Recommended to adjust first the front/back position of the stream, keeping it in focus in the pinhole area. Use the hand lantern (red laser) to see the stream live if needed. (far left window) Make sure that “laser-door” is opened and there is good light over the 3 pinholes. Using top knob, lower tip so that shadow is just visible on top of pinhole camera screen. Center it and bring all the way up, so that is slightly visible. Using nozzle stages (silver knobs behind the brass knobs), center stream over pinholes & bring edges into focus; Check that stream is still in the center of the drain cup; if not, return to (i) & iterate.\nPause point: This is a good place to take a 1-h break and leave the fluidics to stabilize.\nCheck that plate voltage is shut off, clean plates with sterile alcohol wipe. Close the plates. Turn on Plates. Value should be ≈ 3.6 V ± 0.1 (left positive, right negative).\nClose stream-area cover and open laser shutters: Pull knob on the far-left side and wave your finger in front of the camera window. Set laser power to desired level.",
    "Use laser optics stages knobs to place laser beam on the stream over the top pinhole. Set the arrow (in the middle top window) at the bottom of the cut-off droplet.\nCheck that sort area is clear; start Spigot software & open desired configuration file. In the SORT menu choose a window with pre-set sorting parameters (fluorescence and size): e.g., 488 vs FSC. Inactivate other sorting windows if active from before. Let instrument stabilize for at least 1 h. Check if the arrow is still pointing to the same place as before stabilizing.\nBring the calibration beads. (Choose beads of a size relevant to your target organism size). Vortex to de-clump. Make correct dilutions following manufacturer’s instructions. Set the tube with correctly diluted beads in the sample holder. Press Sample and Boost until signals (enough dots on the screen) appear. Stop Boost. keep Sample. Using laser optics stage knobs, maximize on fluorescence, then forward scatter: Adjust dots position until they group tightly in the higher part of the sorting window (this will set them to be the max fluorescence) and if sorting cells bigger than beads size – set the beads group in the far-left side and if sorting smaller than beads size cells – set beads in the far-right top corner. Stop Sample.\nRemove the tube with calibration beads, close with the tube cap and put aside for later. Turn on Backflush for a few seconds to clear the beads from the sample line.\n(Middle window) Click on “Sort Config” and adjust droplet frequency and piezo to bring break-off point into view with drop camera (typically droplet position ∼200): Use the top single right silver knob to move the camera up and down the droplet stream.",
    "Check deflection (left). Turn on Flash charge – adjust Piezo Amplitude value (usually increase), so that the stream stays left after turning on/off Flush Charge.\nTest streams should be steady when toggling flash on and off. Note droplet break-off image – it should stay the same, if not, count again droplet position: break-off point, 4 droplets down, 5 droplets up, laser (top of the stream at the tip end). Approximate drop delay (18–20) using Spigot – press Count.\nTurn on microscope fluorescent light to warm up.\nCalibrate drop delay by sorting 5 × 5 matrix (glass slide) and counting (green) beads (2 μm) on fluorescent scope. Press (Sample); Boost until signals (enough dots on the screen) appear. Stop Boost. keep Sample. Choose “Calibration Slide” in the Sorted Sample Container. Press Sort ready. After sorting onto the slide Stop Sample.\nNote: Sometimes the calculated time delay is off. Once determined empirically, it should be recorded and the difference from calculated should be recorded. This difference may be useful for later calibrations.\nView calibration slide under fluorescent light on the microscope using 10× objective. Count the beads in several droplets, starting with the middle one, then the higher and the lower (should be ± 5 beads). Choose the correct drop position from the slide (max number of beads). Press on slide layout table the drop position with the best bead count. Software will adjust the droplet interval. Verify calibration 2 times at least.\nBackflush between beads and between samples with sheath fluid. If beads or sample are too sticky 10% sterile Bleach can be used in the sample line for a few minutes, followed by backflush for a few minutes. If done so, at least 5 different samples can be sorted one after other without cross contamination.",
    "Note: Sample pressure – increase or decrease – fine adjustment – orient yourself based on the stream in the Pinhole screen. DO NOT orient by the Total Rate – however, do not go above 400/s, at this rate there are approximately 40 events/s. Rather dilute sample to obtain around 100 events/s. For very small-volume samples, dilute further and reduce to minimum possible events/second to minimize losses. This can be practiced with various bead dilutions prior to sorting.\nSet-up for sorting into a tube for target enrichment and single or multiple-cell 384-well plates: Choose the Sorted Sample Container (tube or 384-well plate).\nCalibrate the stream position in the well. For the tube, determine the tube angle to obtain the sorted droplet where desired. For the 384-well plates, use a calibration 384-well plate: Mark a few wells in column 1 for the top of the 0.3 μL volume. In the 384-well layout of the sorting software choose column 2 and sort clean sheath fluid for 500–1000 ‘imaginary’ events into each well. This can be done if the laser is moved temporarily into the noise area of the stream. Do not forget to return the laser beam to the correct droplet position when sorting real events (cells or beads).\nInspect the sorted fluid drop visually. If the drop is too far off the well bottom, increase/decrease offset: Adjust position using offsets on the x- axis and/ or y axis: increase the number to shift the drop as desired. Start with one axis only.\nOnce the correct offset is established for column 2, repeat for columns 11 and 22. Choose the value that positions the droplet around the bottom of the well in all three columns, not higher than the 300 nL mark.",
    "Choose desired sorting window , e.g., 488 vs FSC or FSC vs SSC. Close other opened/active windows. Stain the sample with Syto-9 (488 nm) for DNA and another dye (chose correct laser/filter for each type of dye) if a specific feature (e.g., tubulin for flagella) is used for sorting. If necessary, dilute the sample with sterile sheath-fluid or sterile water. Place the sample tube with the sample to be sorted into the sample tube holder until clicks in place (sealed for pressure).\nRun Sample, Boost until the cell population starts to appear in the active window. Stop Boost, keep Sample. Gate each cell-population. Choose the population(s) wanted to be sorted. If the population of interest is not known, perform an exploratory sort from each gate into a tube. Sort until a 2–5 μL droplet appears on the tube wall. Examine under the microscope. If the organisms shape is not known, each Gate can be sorted into three separate wells (500 events) and a PCR of the rDNA can be performed, using Lysis and Neutralization buffer described in the next step, but skipping the MDA amplification, followed by steps 25–31. OTU identification: rDNA qPCR and screening, point 3. If more than one primer pair is intended to be used, a brief (1 h) MDA should be performed, followed by steps 25,26, after MDA amplification. Followed by available NGS or Sanger sequencing. See protocol below.\nOnce the desired Gate with the organisms of interest is identified, proceed to sorting into a sterile tube filled with 1–2 mL of sterile sheath fluid. Sort the entire sample volume to obtain a good target organism enrichment. Verify under the microscope that the desired organism was sorted and the cleanliness of the enrichment.",
    "Insert the single-cell clean (10–15 min UV sterilized in the Stratalinker 2400) 384-well Bio Rad qPCR clear plate, into the plate holder∗. The type of plate depends on the specifications for the real-time thermocycler used. ∗See steps 11 to 24 for single-cell genome amplification.\nUse column 2 to sort sheath fluid (to sort sheath fluid, sort on noise and set the event to the maximum of the multi-cell sort, e.g., 100 events if sorting 100 cells. Go back to the normal view of the window and use column 3 to sort the multiple-cell sorts for positive controls (e.g., 10-cells, 50-cells, or 100-cells). For easy to lyse cells, 10-cells are sufficient. For small genomes from relatively clean populations, the number of multiple-cells sorted into one well could be increased. This allows to avoid genome amplification (steps 11 to 24 can be shortened to Lysis only, followed by NGS library creation) and genome bias due to amplification. In this case, after single-cell lysis, proceed directly to amplified (increase cycle to 21 cycles) NGS library creation. See the Troubleshooting section, Solution 11 Nextera XT information. For mining unknown species multiple-cell sorts are recommended only for good, clean homogeneous population enrichments, otherwise should be avoided.\nUse the rest of the wells for single-cell sorting, except column 23 and 24 leave for later use in the next step. When the sort is finished, seal the plate with sterile aluminum foil and place on dry ice in a Styrofoam box, for transportation to the −80°C freezer later for long-term storage.]\nShut Down the instrument: Record weight on scale to determine consumed and remaining sheath fluid volume.",
    "Add 2 mL of 10% bleach to sample tube and Sample for 10 min. Remove bleach tube and Backflush for 1 min. Add 2 mL of filter-sterilized H2O to sample tube and Sample for 5 min. Close laser shutter(s) and take off Run.\nDetach sheath lines, vent sheath tank, and disposed of excess sheath fluid down drain. Add 500 mL of filter-sterilized Milli-Q H2O to the sheath tank used for bleaching the lines and connect fluid and pressure lines to sheath tank and pressurize.\nPut the waste basin beneath tip, push Rinse and Backflush sample line (back-flushing will continue until fluid is gone and air is flowing through the tubing). Continue until no events are visible and the lines are dry.\nShut off lasers. UV-sterilize the sort area or wipe clean with 70% alcohol.\nRemove tip and Run for 5 min until no trace of water comes out. Turn off Run. Shut down software & computer. Shut off electronics. Shut off vacuum pump & pressurized air.\nDisconnect the waste tank and add bleach to final conc. of 10% by volume, and let sit for at least 15 min before disposing into the sink. Rinse with tap water and set to dry.\nSingle-cell lysis and genome amplification: Choose fast single-cell MDA or slow single-cell MDA\nTiming: 4–8 h, hands-on 1 h for FAST MDA; 8–16 h, hands-on 2–3 h for SLOW MDA; 5 h to 6 h, hands-on 1 h to 2 h for step 13",
    "Note: We recommend FAST single-cell genome MDA protocol (steps 11 to 14) for larger size eukaryotic genomes and genomes that are average size and have 45%–55% genome GC. See Ciobanu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for examples. Also, this is our default protocol for unknown organisms or organism with unknown characteristics of the genome. However, if the resulting genomes are found to be highly biased (See Ciobanu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for examples.), we recommend to use SLOW single-cell genome MDA, see steps 15 to 24. Also, SLOW single-cell genome MDA is more suitable for small genomes and poorly lysed cells, using one of the optimizations, see Note at the end of step 24.\nAll the manipulations should be performed while fully gowned: Single-use lab coat, gloves, and facial/ head piece that prevents the hair moving around. The work in the hood should be done only after disinfecting the gloves with bleach or 70% sterile Isopropanol or 70% sterile Ethanol. Ideally the work should be performed in a sterile room, or all the surfaces should be disinfected prior to use. If no sterile room available, at least a biosafety or PCR hood should be placed in a low foot-traffic area where is no work with amplified DNA and no culturing of microbial organisms occurs.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1355_1.csv\nThis step is dedicated to plasticware and reagent UV sterilization and preparation and sterilization of the stock solutions.

Open it in the clean hood. Remove 10–20 tubes. Close the tubes inside the hood wearing sterile gloves. Place them on a piece of aluminum foil and transport to the Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 along with components from step 12.\nUV sterilize for 1 h the empty tubes and the H2Osc and Stop Solution from sub-step ii. If using the LabCyte ECHO525 for reagent transfer, UV-treat the 384 well LabCyte plate (source plate for ECHO525) with clear seal for 30 min to 1 h along with the above. Save the tubes in a sterile container or wrap them in the aluminum foil and leave in the hood. Return the rest to the hood.\nWipe clean the DLB tube and prepare the stock DLB buffer by adding 500 μL of the H2Osc 1-h UV-ed water to the pellet in the supplied tube. Vortex and spin down.\nPrepare Lysis Buffer by first adding 200 μL of buffer DLB to empty new (not UV-treated) 1.5 mL clear DNAase, RNAase free sterile Eppendorf tubes, then adding 18 μL of DDT and finally adding 200 μL of UV-treated H2Osc (in respective order).\nConfirm pH for Lysis and Stop buffer by dispensing 1 μL of Lysis buffer on pH strip. pH should be 12–14. Dispense 1 μL of Stop buffer on top of the Lysis droplet.

Target genome size was 30.77 Mb, average GC%. 100-cell (dark blue) and 50-cell (light blue) amplified after 40 min and single cells (green) amplified well after 50 min. Positive control (black) (E. coli gDNA) amplified after 80 min. There were three instances where negative control amplified (pink) (cycle 9, 13, and 17). This is most likely attributed to contamination from using ECHO machine to dispense MDA. Right: longer MDA. Target genome size was 11 Mb, average GC%. Positive control (black) (E. coli gDNA) amplified at 60 min, multiple-cell FACS sorts in light green amplified after 150 min, single-cell wells amplified after 200 min. Negative controls in red did not amplify. This plate was dispensed using an automated multi-channel pipette in a clean hood.",

Dark blue are wells with multiple-cell FACS sorts; Light green are single-cell FACS sorts. (C) Target genome size was 46.5 Mb, average GC%. MDA reaction volume was 2 μL MDA mix over 0.75 μL Lysis and Stop, customized reagent volumes. Single cells (light blue) amplified sparingly starting after 50 min 100-cell (dark blue) also amplified sparingly after 30 min. There were three instances where negative control amplified (at cycle 18, 19, 20). Positive control (E. coli gDNA) amplification pattern does not match the normal pattern. Nevertheless, this MDA gave a very good rDNA OTU amplification and target OTU frequency (See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). We speculate that this batch of the Repli-G had a slightly higher concentration of the enzyme, which along with an efficient early lysis led to an earlier amplification of an already large genome (46 Mb) and the MDA plateau was reached after a few cycles due to saturation of the ultra-low reaction volume.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1355-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. rDNA-fragment real-time PCR of the Thamnocephalis sphaerospora MDA plate from Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C\nLeft side shows amplification curves, melting curves are on the right side.\n(A) 16S PCR with v6 region universal primers (926, 1392).

Tween 20 detergent stock solution should be filter-sterilized and UV-treated in the clear bottle from the filter-system in the hood, for 3 h to 16h. For long term storage it can be aliquoted and stored at −20°C. To incorporate the Tween 20 detergent into lysis: at the step of preparing the UV-treated water, prepare a Tween 20 solution at a concentration that will result in 0.3% final concentration after added to the Lysis buffer. UV-treat this stock solution along with the water tubes. The same applies to EDTA (final concentration in the Lysis buffer should not exceed 1 mM). For Proteinase K prepare a stock solution of maximum concentration in UV-treated water. Filter sterilize this solution. Aliquot 1 mL in 1.5 mL tubes, like the water above.

Wipe clean and carefully remove the cover as not to create aerosol.\nIn a 96-well plate that fits any available thermocycler dispense 2 μL of ExoSap-IT to all the wells that will be used. To each well with ExoSap-IT transfer 5 μL of the selected qPCR rDNA fragment and incubate at 37°C for 30 min, inactivate at 80°C for 15 min, cool down to 4°C. If not using for sequencing right away, seal with aluminum foil the plates and freeze at −20°C.\nFor sequencing, transfer 5 μL of the treated reaction to a plate suitable for Sanger sequencing core facility and add either forward or reverse primer to the ExoSap-IT-treated fragments. Concentration of the primers should be chosen according to the sequencing protocol. Typical for Sanger sequencing kits primer concentration is 0.5 μM and volume is 1 μL added to 5 μL treated DNA.",
    "Note: Sequence at your local core facility following local sequencing protocol for the amount of template and primers to be used. The rDNA fragments amplified with primers that have an M13 sequence end are better sequenced using the default Sanger M13 primer, because of the optimal annealing temperature for the standard Sanger protocol.\nEME OTU analysis\nTiming: 1 day or more. hands on time 2–8 h\nThis step is dedicated to taxonomic unit identification. If you want to learn about phylogenetic methods that can be used to further infer the place of the organism, see our paper (Ciobanu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDownload the software for analysis of the rDNA Sequencing Results.\nChoose from software below:\nSequencher 5.1 from http://sequencher.software.informer.com/5.0/[href=http://sequencher.software.informer.com/5.0/]\nBioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor from http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html[href=http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html]\nDownload the appropriate module from DNASTAR Navigator http://www.dnastar.com/t-navigator.aspx[href=http://www.dnastar.com/t-navigator.aspx]\nUnzip results sent from the Core Sequencing Facility Sequencher offers a sequence quality estimate and can trim low quality ends. It can align highly similar sequences and group them, thus allowing a fast screening of the large batches of sequences. BioEdit allows to see chromatographic traces in cases of nucleotide ambiguity or low-quality score. It is helpful to identify if low quality score is due to multiple sequences or due to the lack of sequence or due to high gDNA background. When multiple-sequence happens (assuming all the previous steps were followed correctly) a long-read NGS or short-read NGS + rDNA gene assembly could be helpful for distinguishing between these rDNA. See Ciobanu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for details. SeqMan Ultra module from DNASTAR package can be used for both for Sanger and NGS read analysis.",
    "Using one of the software packages described above, upload the FASTA files and analyze the quality score and length. Trim the low-quality ends if necessary. Export the trimmed sequences with High quality (at least above 50% for long sequences or above 70% for 300 bp short sequences). Arrange them in a FASTA file.\nNote: For NGS short reads, assemble the rDNA gene prior their analysis. However, the assembly can introduce bias and for qPCR fragments is advised to do long-read NGS to avoid this extra-step.\nGo to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov] and choose BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Upload the FASTA file and run in Basic BLAST the nucleotide blast. Choose Other for your database (see orange arrow on the Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Click BLAST (see light green arrow on the image below).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1355-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Ice block configuration with aluminum foil tray and tubes\nMDA reaction mix should be UV-ed in the tray with some UV-clean refrigerated water to ensure constant cooling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1355-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative outcomes for slow real-time MDA of environmental microbial eukaryotes\n(A) Target genome size was 18.2 Mb genome with average GC%. MDA mix was dispensed with automated pipette in a clean hood. Black, positive control, 1 pg S. pombe purified gDNA; green, positive control, 100-cell sorts; pink, negative control, lysis and MDA mix, 16 wells; blue, 288 wells, single cells. Right side: shown the plate layout with amplified wells in blue.",
    "(B) Target genome size was 10.7 Mb genome with average GC% and cell wall. MDA mix was dispensed with Echo. Due to large volumes of the MDA mix, contamination was introduced during Echo dispensing (blue and red). If larger volumes of the reaction are to be dispensed via Echo, a better sterilization of the fluidics of the instrument has to be achieved and a test amplification should be performed the day before dispensing. Alternatively, hand dispensing using an automated pipette in a clean hood is recommended. Keeping the MDA reaction mix to a minimum volume also eliminates contamination. Otherwise sequencing of the contaminating organism can help remove the reads prior assembly. Negative controls: blue, 16 wells, MDA mix; red, 48 wells, Lysis buffer with MDA mix; green, positive control, 16 wells, 100 cells; purple, 288 wells, single cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1355-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Fragment of the qPCR results table generated after selecting wells of interest\nShown are the wells with Cq value predictive of the amount of the gDNA generated. Only the samples with positive Cq value were used for rDNA qPCR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1355-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Selection of the PCR reactions, of the rDNA-fragment, with correct melting curves\n(A) Single Melting curve with characteristic temperature for 800–1500 bp fragment. This reaction is suitable for Sanger sequencing and most likely has a homogenous set of DNA fragments from one species.\n(B) The melting curve with a shoulder could represent either high genomic DNA background or a few different sequences. This reaction should be used either for nested PCR, or an agarose gel run to determine exact cause. If there are two distinct bands, this can be sequenced via an NGS method, long read setting.",
    "(C) Two melting curves both with temperatures above 70°C represent two distinct fragment, one shorter one longer. This type of reaction should be sequenced either via an NGS method, long read setting or eliminated from the further study, if a clean single species genome is the goal.\n(D) Melting peak temperature is higher than 90°C, these fragments may be larger than 1500 bp and/or genomic DNA. Gel electrophoresis can help identify if there is an amplified band. If only gDNA smear is visible, no sequencing will help for OTU screening.\nAlignment Scores <40 indicates low levels of similarities. Alignment Scores ≥200 indicates good matches. Note down organism matches for corresponding wells.\nNote: For novel organisms from phylogenetic groups that are severely underrepresented use specialized databases (e.g. Aftol for fungi) and follow specific database analysis protocol.\nPhylogenetic placement and genome sequencing. For methods used for phylogenetic placement of the obtained rDNA see our method paper Ciobanu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. After choosing the MDA wells that gave the expected or desired rDNA phyla, proceed to library construction for chosen NGS genomic sequencing. For examples and methods comparison see Ciobanu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], for low input genomic DNA (e.g., 100–10,000 cells and no MDA, or 1 cell with very short and low volume MDA) see Solution 11 detailed protocol of adapted Nextera XT library preparation."
