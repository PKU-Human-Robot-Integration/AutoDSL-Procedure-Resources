    "Endometrial samples were collected from premenopausal women undergoing routine hysterectomy for benign uterine conditions at Northwestern University Prentice Women's Hospital, according to an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Written consent was obtained from all women included in the study.\n1. Preparation of Agarose Molds\nPrior to beginning cell isolation, cast and equilibrate 1.5% agarose micro molds (Table of Materials) to house the organoids according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n2. Generation of Endometrial Organoids\nHarvest primary stromal and epithelial cells\nIn a biosafety cabinet using aseptic technique, prepare enzyme solution (2.5 mg/mL collagenase type I + 0.1 mg/mL DNase I in 10 mL of dispase [500 units]) at 37 °C, and sterile-filter the solution using a 0.2 µm syringe filter into a 15 mL conical tube.\nIn a biosafety cabinet using aseptic technique, scrape off endometrium from the uterine biopsies and mince tissue under hood into very small pieces with a scalpel.\nNOTE: Endometrial tissue that is at least 20 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm is required to generate sufficient numbers of organoids.\nPut freshly minced tissue into the enzyme solution in a 15 mL conical tube. Close the cap and wrap the top with a wax film (Table of Materials) to prevent contamination.\nPut the tube with tissue in a water bath or an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking (80−100 rpm).\nStack a 100 µm cell strainer on top of a 20 µm cell strainer on a 50 mL conical tube. Filter the solution through the two strainers, and then rinse the 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Table of Materials) and put the wash through the strainer to ensure all cells are collected.",
    "NOTE: The flow-through liquid contains stromal cells and red blood cells (~20 mL total). Epithelial cells are collected on the 20 µm strainer. Chunks of undigested tissue remain on top of the 100 µm strainer. Discard undigested tissue into a biohazard waste container.\nInvert the 20 µm cell strainer from step 2.1.5 onto a new 50 mL conical tube and wash the epithelial cells off the strainer with 20 mL of organoid media (Table of Materials) supplemented with 1% pen/strep.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes from steps 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 at 500 x g for 5 min.\nWith the collected stromal cells, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer.  Incubate at 37 °C for 10−15 min. Centrifuge the conical tube at 500 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet with 200−300 µL of organoid media (see step 2.2.2 for further instructions).\nWith the collected epithelial cells, remove the supernatant and re-suspend with 100 µL of organoid media (see step 2.2.2 for further instructions).\nSeeding cells\nAfter equilibrating the 1.5% agarose molds in wells (1 mold per well) of a 24-well plate, remove organoid media on the outside of the agarose molds and tilt the tissue culture plate so that the medium from the cell seeding chamber of the agarose dishes can also be carefully removed.\nView epithelial (from step 2.1.9) and stromal (from step 2.1.8) cell suspensions under the microscope.  Add more organoid media to either the epithelial or stromal cell suspensions 100 µL at a time, so that the suspensions are roughly equal in density.\nNOTE: Epithelial cells will clump together, and it is not advisable to digest/trypsinize epithelial cells into single cell suspensions.",
    "Combine 1 part of stromal cells with 3 parts of epithelial cells by volume.\nPipette 50 µL (60,000 cells) of the combined cell suspension into the cell seeding chamber of the agarose mold.\nOnce the agarose molds are filled with cells, carefully add 400 µL of fresh organoid media into the well of the 24-well plate.\nNOTE: The medium reaches just below the surface of the agarose dishes and will not cause the cells to float out of the molds. After 2−3 days, cells will settle and start to form organoids.\nChange medium every second day with 500 µL of organoid media.\nAfter 2-3 days, change medium to one that is supplemented with 0.1 nM estradiol (E) and 0.8 nM testosterone (T) to promote organization of epithelial and stromal cells.\nNOTE: Although organization of epithelial and stromal cells can occur with or without hormones, more organoids will organize in the presence of hormones.\n3. Harvesting Endometrial Organoids for Experiments\nNOTE: After the experiment is done, endometrial organoids can be processed for histology or RNA analysis.The following steps describe how to process the organoids.\nHistology\nDissolve 1.5% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by boiling. Allow the liquid agarose to cool to approximately 50 °C.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, tilt the 24-well plate and carefully pipette out the medium from the outside of agarose mold. Carefully pipette out the medium from the interior of the agarose mold to avoid disrupting the organoids.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, carefully pipette 70-75 µL of warm (50 °C) 1.5% agarose into the chamber of the agarose dish. Be careful not to disturb the organoids.\nLet cool at 4 °C for 5 min.",
    "Add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) into each well of the 24 well plate and fix the entire sealed agarose mold containing organoids overnight at 4 °C. Then store in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until ready to process for paraffin embedding.\nRNA isolation\nUnder a dissecting microscope, tilt the 24-well plate and carefully pipette out the medium from the chamber of the agarose mold.\nForcefully pipette 1 mL of fresh organoid medium directly into the agarose mold so the organoids are flushed out of the microwells. Be careful not to create too many bubbles.\nRepeat the pipetting again with the same medium from step 3.2.2.\nCollect all the medium containing the organoids. Centrifuge at max speed to collect the organoids and proceed to RNA extraction.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
