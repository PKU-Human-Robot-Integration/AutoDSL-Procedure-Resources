    "1. Determine Resting Motor Threshold:\nTo begin, seat your subject in a comfortable chair.\nNext, apply EMG surface electrodes over the first dorsal inerosseus muscle of the subject's right hand.  (INSERT FIGURE1)  If you are having trouble locating this muscle, ask the subject to make a pinching motion or to move his/her index finger back and forth - this should make the muscle easier to locate.\nPlace a ground electrode on the meaty portion of the subject's forearm.\nDetermine the location of the subject's left motor cortex.  Although this area differs slightly for everyone, it will generally be around 3.5 cm rostrolateral of cranial vertex.  Do not be afraid to explore a small grid around this region and adjust the angle of stimulation until finding the motor \"hotspot\".\nOnce you've found M1, starting at 50% power, begin single pulse stimulation to this region and measure the resultant evoked MEPs.\nAdjust the power up or down until you are able to produce an MEP of greater than 50 μV on exactly 5 out of 10 consecutive pulses.  This power level is the subject's resting motor threshold.\n2. Determine Active Motor Threshold\nUsing the same electrode set-up as described above, ask the subject to pinch his/her right forefinger and thumb together using about 20% pressure.\nWhile the subject holds this pinching position, begin single-pulse stimulation at 50% power over M1 and measure the resultant MEPs.\nAdjust the power up or down until you are able to produce an MEP of greater than 200 μV on exactly 5 out of 10 consecutive pulses.  This power level is the subject's active motor threshold.\n3. Determine Baseline Mep\nTo determine a subject's baseline MEP amplitude, stimulate motor hotspot at 120% resting motor threshold with 10 single pulses.\nMeasure the MEP after each pulse.",
    "Average the MEP values from three batches of 10 pulses.\n4. Setting TMS Parameters\nWe will be utilizing standard Theta-Burst parameters: three pulses at 50 Hz at an intensity of 80% active motor threshold for 200 ms intervals.\nTo administer intermittent TBS, generate a two-second stim train (at the aforementioned parameters) followed by eight-seconds of no stimulation. Repeat for 190 seconds (a total of 600 pulses).  iTBS has been shown to facilitate cortical activity.\nTo administer continuous Theta-Burst, generate an uninterrupted stim train (at the aforementioned parameters) for 47 seconds (a total of 600 pulses).  cTBS has been shown to inhibit cortical activity.\n5. Tms Stimulation\nFor this protocol, administer either iTBS or cTBS over the earlier established M1 motor hotspot.\n6. Determine Post-stimulation MEP\nFollowing TBS, as before, stimulate motor hotspot at 120% resting motor threshold with 10 single-pulses.\nAverage the batch of 10 MEP levels.\nCollect new 10-pulse batch averages at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes post-stimulation.\n7. Representative Results\nWhen utilizing an iTBS pattern, you should notice an increase in MEP values for a duration reflecting the subject's natural state of plasticity. Likewise, when utilizing a cTBS pattern, you should notice a decrease in MEP values for a duration reflecting the subject's natural state of plasticity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2272/2272fig1.jpgFigure 1.
