    "Ethics Statement: all procedures were performed in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. A protocol flowchart is provided in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4745/bioprotoc-13-16-4745-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protocol flowchart Euthanasia and retina harvesting Anesthesia: determine the mouse’s body weight to the nearest gram and inject intraperitoneally 40–50 μL of the anesthesia cocktail for a 25 g mouse, for a dose of 80–100 mg/kg ketamine and 5–10 mg/kg xylazine. Wait a few minutes until the mouse is completely anesthetized as measured by loss of response to toe pinch.Transcardial perfusion (Figure 2):Mount the mouse in supine position on Styrofoam or wood surgical station using tape or pins on its four paws.Expose the xiphoid by making a skin incision on the chest; then, make lateral incisions beneath the ribcage using tissue scissors. Carefully cut through both sides of the rib cage up to the collarbone using tissue scissors.Pin the sternum up over the head of the mouse with a hemostat. Clear the pericardial sac and any other tissues/organs covering the heart using dissecting forceps to provide a clear view of the heart and vessels.Make a small incision in the right atrium using iris scissors to create a perfusion outlet. Perform transcardial perfusion using a 25 G needle inserted into the left ventricle with 1× PBS at a constant speed of ~1.5 mL/min using a perfusion pump until the fluid exiting the right atrium is entirely clear. The rate of 1.5 mL/min depends on the pump speed and tube size. It can be adjusted by timing the drip into a 2 mL tube before the experiment and adjusting the pump speed accordingly. It is important that the heart remains beating during the perfusion process to achieve complete perfusion.",
    "Inject each mouse with the correct dose of anesthesia cocktail right before perfusion, as giving a high dose or waiting a long time after the cocktail injection may cause the heart to stop and perfusion to fail.The perfusion step is essential to clear retina vessels from any residual blood, to limit analysis to retinal resident and infiltrating immune cells and exclude cells in the blood circulation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4745/bioprotoc-13-16-4745-g002.jpgFigure 2. Transcardial perfusion. 1. Mouse mounted in supine position with arrows indicating the incision line to open the chest cavity. 2. The heart is exposed by making lateral incisions on both sides of the ribcage using tissue scissors. 3. Heart is exposed after clearing the pericardium with the arrow pointing to the apex. It is important that the heart remains beating during the perfusion process to achieve complete perfusion. 4. Insert a 25 G needle connected to the perfusion pump tubing into the left ventricle through the apex of the heart. 5. Make a small incision in the right atrium using iris scissors to create a perfusion outlet. 6. Turn on the perfusion pump to perform transcardial perfusion with 1× PBS at a constant speed of ~1.5 mL/min, until the fluid exiting the right atrium is entirely clear and the liver (denoted by asterisk) becomes pale.Retina tissue collection (Figure 3):Put the mouse in prone position.Place Dumont #7 curved forceps around the rear part of the eyeball close to the optic nerve and apply gentle pressure to protrude the eye.Make a wide cut in the cornea along the equator using a sharp blade while holding the eyeball with forceps from beneath.Gently remove the lens and vitreous body with the tip of the blade; then, extract the retina from the eyecup by pulling the forceps upwards.Note that the retina is an off-white translucent tissue.",
    "Make sure that the retina is detached from the retinal pigment epithelium by removing any black tissue that comes out with the isolated retina. Place the retina from both eyes in 2–3 mL of cold HBSS in a 10 mm Petri dish.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4745/bioprotoc-13-16-4745-g003.jpgFigure 3. Retina tissue collection. 1. Put the mouse in prone position and hold the eyeball from beneath to cause the eye to protrude. 2. Make a wide cut in the cornea along the equator using a sharp blade while holding the eyeball with the forceps from beneath. 3. Grip the dissected eyeball with forceps to remove the lens and vitreous denoted by arrow. 4. Squeeze the remaining eye cup to extract the retina from the eyeball. 5. Move the retina (off-white translucent tissue) to 2–3 mL of cold HBSS. Asterisk denotes the discarded lens with the vitreous and iris. 6. Remove any remaining retinal pigment epithelium (black tissue, denoted by asterisk). 7. Retinas from both eyes in HBSS are ready for further processing.Retina digestion and single-cell suspension (Figure 4) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4745/bioprotoc-13-16-4745-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "Use a scalpel to dice the retinas into pieces < 1 mm in HBSS; then, transfer to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pelleted tissue in a total of 500 μL of digestion buffer.Note: You can add an additional step to eliminate any red blood cells (RBC) in the samples by incubating the digested tissue in 1 mL of RBC lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Place the tubes on a rack and place the rack into a 37 °C water (or dry beads) bath for 30 min. Vortex gently every 10 min.Add 10 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS to the reaction to inhibit the enzymatic digestion and increase the cell yield.Gently strain each sample three times through a 40 μm cell strainer and wash the strainer with 1 mL of PBS after each strain. Use the rubber end of a syringe plunger to gently press the samples through the mesh.Spin down at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the pelleted tissues in 3 mL of PBS and count the cells. One can start by pooling two to four whole retinas per sample and reduce the number in subsequent experiments based on the cell yield.Cells can be counted on an automated cell counter or manually using a hemocytometer under a microscope.Note: Cell counts are approximately 1.5 × 106 cells per three retinas, which is sufficient for each staining panel/sample. Consider pooling more retinas for fluorescence minus one (FMO) and control samples. Divide the cell samples into the 5 mL FACS test tubes with proper cell number and groups. At least 1.5 million cells per tube are required for further processing.",
    "The tube groups should include the following controls along with sample groups: A) negative/unstained cells; B) single stain controls for each color; and C) FMOs for each color. For our antibody panel, we used the following groups: unstained cells, cells + PerCP only, cells + APC only, cells + PE only, cells + FITC only, cells + AF700 only, cells + BV605 only, cells + viability dye only, FITC FMO- cells with all stains except FITC, PE FMO- cells with all stains except PE, APC FMO- cells with all stains except APC, PerCP FMO- cells with all stains except PerCP, AF700 FMO- cells with all stains except AF700, BV605 FMO- cells with all stains except BV605, and viability dye FMO- cells with all stains except viability dye.Note: Controls are needed to set instrument voltages and compensate the samples, while the FMOs are used to set the positive and negative gates for each color (fluorophore) in the analysis. Controls can be done the first time the samples are run and omitted for subsequent experiments if the same conditions and protocols for tissue lysis and staining are followed. Spin down at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Carefully aspirate the supernatant in each tube without disturbing the pellet until approximately 100 μL are remaining. Next, add another 100 μL of PBS and resuspend the pellet immediately to avoid clumping.Cells are then ready to be stained for flow cytometry. Cells should be protected from light throughout staining and storage.Staining for flow cytometry Stain for viability (live/dead stain) by diluting the fixable Zombie Violet UVTM dye at 1:100–1:1,000 in PBS and resuspend 1.0 × 106 cells in diluted 100 μL of Zombie UVTM solution. Incubate the samples for 30 min on ice in the dark.",
    "To minimize background staining of live cells, titrate the volume of dye and/or number of cells per 100 μL for optimal performance.Note: Titrate the dye volume that will be used in preliminary studies to minimize background staining of live cells. Wash by adding 2–3 mL of FACS/EDTA buffer and spin down at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C. Gently aspirate supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet.Block with 1 μg/mL of Fc block anti-mouse CD16/32 and 20% normal rat serum at a volume of 50 mL of PBS/sample for 10 min at room temperature or 20 min at 4 °C.Without washing, add the appropriate volume of antibodies for surface staining to evaluate the different cell populations. For this protocol, we used the antibody panel listed in Table 1.Protect samples from light and incubate them as per the antibody manufacturer’s instructions, which is typically 20 min at 4 °C.Add 1 mL of FACS/EDTA buffer and spin down at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Gently aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of FACS/EDTA buffer and cover the samples with foil for same-day run on the flow cytometer.Alternatively, samples can be fixed by resuspending in 0.4% PFA and kept overnight at 4 °C and protected from light for next-day run on the flow cytometer. However, we recommend running the sample immediately after staining to avoid any loss of yield or signal."
