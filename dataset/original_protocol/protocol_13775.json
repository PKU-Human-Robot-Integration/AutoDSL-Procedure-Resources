    "The protocol demonstrates the use of the electronic health record TBase, how to add data into the database, and how to extract them for research purposes. All steps are in accordance with the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.\n1. Register a new patient and add basic patient data into TBase\nUpon registration, transfer the patient's basic data (name, birth date, and health insurance data) from the patient's health insurance card to the hospital information system. During this process, a new unique case number is created. If the patient has never been treated at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, a new unique patient number is created as well, that clearly identifies this particular patient in the hospital system.\nDuring this registration process, obtain written informed consent from the patient for TBase data processing by Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the outpatient clinic of Charité (Ambulantes Gesundheitszentrum der Charité) according to the EU GDPR.\nHave an employee with appropriate permission add this new patient to TBase. First, sign into TBase via the GUI. For that, enter \"https://nephro.tbase.charite.de” into a Chrome-Engine based Web Browser in Charité Intranet. Next, enter the username and password assigned by the TBase administrator. Click Log On.\nNext, click on the Add new patient button on bottom of the Patient overview frame on the left. Then, an input screen appears.\nEnter the patient's name, birth date, Charité hospital patient number (see above, or alternatively a Charité hospital case number), and the information about patient data processing consent (if it is granted, not granted or revoked by the patient). Click on the Save button on the bottom right when data entry is completed.",
    "​NOTE: Now, a new patient has been added to TBase and automatically all available patient data are now transferred from HIS into the TBase EHR system.\n2. Viewing and adding data to a patient record in TBase in the Sections: Master Data, Medical Data, Doctors, Diagnosis, Procedures, Transplantation Data, Hospital\nLog in to EHR as described in step 1.3.\nSearch for the desired patient via the search field on the top left via name or birth date.

A new screen appears, with 18 different options (ranging from laboratory results to complete medical report).\n\t\nFor example, create a medical report with a few clicks: Click on Outpatient Medical Report. The patient name, the treating physician, the last date of the laboratory values and last date of medical course are automatically filled out, but can be changed if needed. After confirmation by clicking on OK, a properly formatted word (.doc-) document file is created and downloaded for printout containing the selected information.\n6. Logging out\nTo actively log out of TBase, click the Log out button at the bottom right. Additionally, one is logged out automatically after 60 minutes of inactivity or if the browser is closed.\n7. Using the collected data\nTo query the collected data, use replication server (Figure 1) as described in the Database structure and interfaces section. Any data processing programs that can connect to a database via Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) can be used for the queries. Once the connection to the database has been established, use the open-source software R Studio.\nTo set up an ODBC database connection, for example, in the Windows operating system, open the ODBC tool and click Add for a new user data source name (DSN) under Control Panel and Security Management. There, enter the available connection data to the replication database. Enter the following data: \"Driver Name\", \"ODBC Connection Name\" (set by the user), \"Hostname\" and the SQL authentication details \"User Name\", \"Password\" and \"Database Name\".",
    "In order to generate a very simple query (e.g., number of transplants divided by gender in the years 2000-2020) in the open-source software R Studio after the ODBC database connection has been set up, open File, New File in the application R Studio at the top left and click on R Script. The example script code (Code 1) is entered in the empty script window that opens.\nClick on button Source on the top of the script window and the script is running and then generates the bar chart defined in the script with the data from the connected database (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required.
