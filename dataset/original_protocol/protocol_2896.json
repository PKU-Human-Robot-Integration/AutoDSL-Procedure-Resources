    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1\nCD4+ T-cell separation, cell activation and drug testing\nTiming: 6 h\nDuring the first day, CD4+ T-cells (or PBMCs) will be separated from whole blood of PLWH or thawed from frozen aliquots. The CD4+ T cell separation is based on antibody labeling of all PBMC sub-populations except our cells of interest. The antibody-labeled cells can thus be removed using a magnet separator leaving a highly pure CD4+ T cell suspension for downstream use.\nCells will then be activated and/or treated with experimental compounds to assess HIV-1 reactivation for TILDA (“shock” phase) or sorted to isolate live cells for quantification of integrated HIV-1 DNA by Alu-PCR (“kill” phase).\nSeparate PBMCs from fresh blood or leukapheresis using Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation or using PBMCs cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen.\nWhen starting from whole blood.\nDilute blood 1:1 with PBS.\nTransfer 12 mL of Ficoll Hypaque in a 50 mL conic tube.\nAdd slowly 30 mL of diluted blood on the top of the Ficoll solution with the help of a pipette.\nCentrifuge for 20 min at 4°C at 700 × g (setting no break in the centrifugation).\nAspirate with a pipette the white/reddish cell ring containing the PBMCs.\nWhen using cryopreserved PBMCs.\nTransfer a vial of cryopreserved PBMCs (generally 10–50 million per vial) in a 37°C water bath and wait until the vial is completely thawed.\nTransfer the content of the vial to a 50 mL conic tube.\nAdd, drop by drop, 40 mL of R20 media solution.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard the R20 media solution and add 40 mL of R10 media solution.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard the R10 media solution and add another 10 mL of R10 media solution.\nCount cells.",
    "Isolate CD4+ T-cells by negative magnetic selection.\nWarm the negative magnetic selection kit to 15°C–25°C at least 30 min before use.\nResuspend 50 million PBMCs in 1 mL of R10 media solution and transfer to a 5 mL conic polystyrene tube.\nAdd 50 μL of the negative selection antibody solution (provided with the negative selection kit) and incubate for 5 min.\nRight before use, vortex the magnetic beads present in the negative selection kit and add 50 μL of magnetic bead preparation to the cell suspension.\nAfter a 5 min incubation, add an additional 2 mL of R10 to the 5 mL conic polystyrene tube and mix the solution with the help of a pipette.\nAdd 50 μL of magnetic bead suspension and again mix a few times with the help of a pipette.\nTransfer the tube into the magnetic separator and incubate for 5 min.\nInvert the magnet and the tube pouring the negatively selected cells into a new tube.\nCount cells.\nNote: we suggest always assessing the CD4+ T-cell purity by FACS analysis and, in case it should be lower than 95%, repeating the CD4+ T-cell negative selection process. When thawed cells are used, it is also particularly important to check for the presence of dead cells and exclude them from the counting process (e.g., using trypan blue).",
    "Critical: at least 2 × 106 CD4+ T-cells per experimental condition (i.e., resting, activated with or without the experimental drugs to be tested) are required for the whole workflow, with 1 × 106 set aside for TILDA and 1 × 106 for sorting viable cells and downstream Alu-PCR. These amounts can be typically obtained from 20 × 106 PBMCs or 10 mL of total blood. When possible, it is recommended to start from larger volumes/amounts to guarantee the possibility of including additional replicates of the same experimental condition.\nActivate isolated CD4+ T-cells (or PBMCs) to provide a positive control for the TILDA assay and/or treat them with experimental compounds to test their “shock and kill” effects.\nTransfer 1 mL of CD4+ T-cells at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL in R10 media solution to a 24-well plate.\nKeep cells in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3–5 h.\nAdd 1 μL of PMA and 1 μL of ionomycin solution per each mL of cell suspension (final concentrations: 100 ng/mL PMA and 1 μg/mL ionomycin).\nIncubate cells with PMA and ionomycin for 12–18 h to have a positive control for the reactivation of the HIV-1 reservoir.\nSplit the remaining cells in the required conditions for treatment with the experimental drug(s) of choice, leaving at least 2 × 106 cells under resting condition as controls.\nNote: when CD4+ T-cells are separated from fresh blood, no incubation time is necessary before step 3c (stimulation). Repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided for the PMA or ionomycin working solutions.",
    "Note: assuming for simplicity the testing of a single experimental drug, the minimum number of conditions included in step 3e will be: resting condition (negative control), PMA/ionomycin condition (positive reactivation control), and the experimental drug treatment condition. Additionally, a condition of cells treated with PMA/ionomycin plus the experimental drug can be included in the same setup to evaluate the ability of the experimental drug to boost/inhibit the reactivation potential of other stimuli.\nNote: the protocol and the cell quantities that we recommend are set on an ideal \"shock and kill\" protocol, in which one drug provides both the \"shock\" and the “kill” stimulus. However, it is also possible, and likely, that two or more drugs will be required, each providing either the stimulus to reactivate HIV-1 from latency or to induce selective killing of the infected CD4+ T-cells. If two or more drugs are used, the number of treatment conditions will depend on whether the “kill” drug is expected to exert an effect per se (“silent killing\" of the latently infected cells without HIV-1 reactivation) or whether its effects are dependent on the previous viral reactivation. In the latter case, testing only the drug combination may be sufficient. Overall, although the total amount of cells to allocate for step 3e will depend on the number of experimental drugs/concentrations envisaged for the experiment; even in the case of experiments testing multiple drugs, we recommend plating at least 2 × 106 cells per condition.\nDay 2\nTILDA preamplification, nested-qPCR and analysis (“shock” phase)\nTiming: 7 h",
    "During the second day the cells will be probed for the presence of spliced HIV-1 mRNA using TILDA (the procedure of which is summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This is accomplished by performing a pre- amplification (first PCR) followed by a nested qPCR (second PCR) on cells serially diluted in a 96-well plate. A limiting dilution calculator software will finally be used to estimate the number of cells expressing spliced HIV-1 mRNA.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic workflow of TILDA\nTILDA is used to evaluate the \"shock” phase (HIV-1 latency reactivation) by performing a nested PCR of a serially diluted cell input to detect spliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts (i.e., Tat and Rev). After isolation from whole blood of PLWH, target cells (typically CD4+ T-cells or PBMCs) are left untreated or activated with PMA/ionomycin or treated with experimental compound(s) (step 1). Cells are then plated at serial dilutions (as detailed in the main text) and used for the pre-amplification PCR (step 2). The pre-amplificates are then loaded in a qPCR assay (step 3) and the expression of spliced HIV-1 mRNA is calculated with a dedicated software (step 4).\nPrepare the pre-amplification (first PCR) mix.\nFollow the calculations shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below to prepare the pre-amplification (first PCR) mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_3.csv\nAmounts are calculated for one well.\nDistribute the pre-amplification mix adding 10 μL per well in the pre-amplification plate.\nPrepare the nested qPCR mix.\nFollow the calculations shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] below to prepare the nested qPCR (second PCR) mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_4.csv\nAmounts are calculated for one well.\nDistribute the nested qPCR mix adding 9 μL per well in the nested qPCR plate(s).",
    "Note: generally, a full 96-well plate is loaded with the nested qPCR mix. In this case it is helpful to prepare a mix for 110 wells and distribute 9 μL per well with a multichannel pipette. The assay is, however, also compatible with 396-well plates which can be useful when multiple samples/conditions are tested.\nNote: after distributing the pre-amplification (first PCR) mix and the nested qPCR mix in their allocated plates keep the plates at 4°C until use.\nLoad serial cell dilutions in the pre-amplification plate (first PCR) according to the scheme shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and following the steps below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Suggested schemes for plating target cells in limiting dilution in the TILDA pre-amplification plate\nThe pre-amplification PCR of TILDA uses serial dilutions of target cells to detect spliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts. The figure depicts typical schemes for plating serial cell dilutions in a 96-well plate. For the specific calculations of the different dilutions (i.e., solutions A-D) refer to step 6 of the “step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]” section of the manuscript.\nCollect at least 1 × 106 CD4+ T-cells (or PBMCs) previously stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (or unstimulated controls, or cells treated with the experimental compounds) in a 1.5 mL tube.\nSpin cells for 10 min at 600 × g.\nCount cells and dilute them in R10 media solution at a concentration of 18 × 106 cells/mL (equal to 18,000 cells/μL or 1 × 106 CD4+ T cells/55.5 μL). This is referred to as cell component solution A.\nTransfer 1 μL of cell component solution A to 24 wells (flat bottom) of the pre-amplification plate (18,000 cells/well).\nTransfer 24 μL of cell component solution A to a new sterile 1.5 mL tube and add 24 μL of R10 media solution. This is referred to as cell component solution B.",
    "Transfer 1 μL of cell component solution B to the next 24 wells of the pre-amplification plate (9,000 cells/well).\nAdd 48 μL of R10 media solution to component solution B. This is referred to as cell component solution C.\nTransfer 1 μL of component C to each of the next 24 wells of the pre-amplification plate (3,000 cells/well).\nAdd 96 μL of R10 media solution to component solution C. This is referred to as cell component solution D.\nTransfer 1 μL of component D to each of the next 24 wells of the pre-amplification plate (1,000 cells/well).\nSeal the pre-amplification plate with a sealing foil, spin the plate at 700 × g (or max speed) for 30 s, and transfer the plate to the PCR instrument.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of expected qualitative TILDA results\nThe nested qPCR of TILDA yields an initial qualitative result (i.e., number of wells positive for spliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts) that can be calculated through the Second Derivative Maximum method or similar methods (step 9 of the main text). Typically, positive wells will be more common in stimulated cells (i.e., cells that were treated with PMA/ionomycin or experimental drugs) and in lower dilution wells.\nCritical: to prevent non-specific amplification, keep the plate at 4°C (e.g., cooling holder) until use, also while dispensing cell dilutions.\nNote: when collecting cells for TILDA in step 6a, leave at least 1 × 106 cells in culture for downstream analysis (Day 3–4 of the protocol).",
    "Note: the pre amplification reaction requires a full plate for each experimental condition (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), with a potentially large number of plates required in experimental setups testing multiple drugs and/or drug concentrations. Although plates can be stored for up to 6 h at 4°C until use, the number of thermocyclers available might be a limiting factor and potentially increase the turnover time of the experiment.\nNote: always vortex component solutions A-D (steps 6c-j) for a few seconds before transferring the cells to the pre-amplification plate, to guarantee an even distribution of cells.\nNote: the standard TILDA dilution scheme (18,000; 9,000; 3,000; 1,000) can be adapted according to the expected frequency of positive cells. For example, when using cells isolated from the blood of viremic donors (normally harboring a higher number of spliced HIV-1 mRNA positive cells) the scheme can be modified as follows: 9,000; 3,000; 1,000; 333.\nNote: if working with low amounts of CD4+ T-cells, the number of replicates per dilution factor (24 × 4) can be scaled. However, this may impact on the accuracy and precision of the measurements (i.e., wider confidence intervals).\nStart the pre-amplification (first PCR) reaction using the program shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_5.csv\nLoad the nested qPCR plate.\nAt the end of the pre-amplification (first PCR run), carefully remove the sealing foil and add 40 μL of TE buffer 1× to each well of the pre-amplification plate.\nMix by gentle pipetting and transfer 1 μL of the diluted PCR products to the equivalent well in the nested qPCR plate.\nSeal the plate with a qPCR grade sealing foil.\nSpin the plate at 700 × g (or max speed) for 30 s and transfer the plate to the real-time PCR instrument.",
    "Start the real time PCR cycling using the program shown in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_6.csv\nAt the end of the qPCR amplification, perform the initial qualitative analysis using the Second Derivative Maximum method.\nCount positive wells at each dilution and record the data (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: the Second Derivative Maximum method compares fluorescent curves directly, finding a characteristic (and constant) point on the graph, which reflects the shape of the curve. Alternatively, the Fit Points method, First Derivative method and Cycle Threshold method can be used as well.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] All these methods are typically incorporated in every modern qPCR instrument software and require little or no input from the operator. Ultimately, the aim of this analysis step is to identify positive and negative wells, rather than comparing the relative amount of spliced HIV-1 mRNA per well.\nPerform the final quantitative analysis. Input the data into an appropriate limiting dilution calculator software to determine the frequency of cells expressing spliced HIV-1 mRNA per million CD4+ T-cells.\nNote: We recommend the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) software, http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda[href=http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda].12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] When this software is used for calculations, the input data will be as follows:\n  18000, 24, X1.\n  9000, 24, X2.\n  3000, 24, X3.\n  1000, 24, X4.\nWhere the first column is reserved for the dilution (cells per well), the second column for the number of replicates per dilution, and the last column (X1, X2 etc.) for the number of positive wells per dilution factor (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. ELDA calculator input for quantitative TILDA analysis\nThe final quantitative analysis of TILDA data is performed with an appropriate limiting dilution calculator software. The Figure depicts an example of input and output data using the recommended ELDA software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda.5[href=http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda.5]) to determine the frequency of cells expressing spliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts per million CD4+ T cells.",
    "Note: the ELDA software returns a maximum likelihood estimate and 95% confidence interval (lower limit, upper limit). Multiply the estimates and 95% confidence interval by 1 × 106 to get the frequency of cells expressing spliced HIV-1 mRNA / 1 × 106 CD4+ T-cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). If all wells are positive (extremely large reservoir) repeat the assay increasing the dilution factor. If all wells are negative (very small reservoir), repeat the assay with more replicate plates.\nDay 3\nStaining of dead cells with 7-AAD/Annexin V\nTiming: 30 min\nPart of the cells isolated on DAY1 were used for TILDA on DAY2. The remaining cells (i.e., unstimulated, activated with PMA/ionomycin, treated with the experimental drug/s) will now be used for viability sorting, followed by HIV-1 integrated DNA quantification in live sorted cells (to assess the “kill” phase of the therapeutic approach).\nSince in DAY1 at least 2 × 106 cells were plated for each condition, and since TILDA requires less than 1 × 106 cells, there will be at least 1 × 106 cells available for the following steps.\nWash cells with cold PBS and resuspend them at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL in 1× Annexin Binding Buffer.\nAdd 5 μL of 7-AAD and 5 μL of Annexin V solution (provided in the kit) per 100 μL of cell suspension.\nGently vortex cells and incubate for 15 min at 15°C–25°C in the dark.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min and resuspend them at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL in 1× Binding Buffer. Cells are now ready for sorting and viable cell collection.",
    "Optional: a positive cell death control can be prepared by treating control cells isolated from healthy donors or surplus cells isolated from PLWH with compounds of known cytotoxicity (e.g., H2O2, doxorubicin, etoposide), or by incubating them at 60°C for 10 min. Results can vary and therefore a protocol to prepare a positive apoptosis control should be validated in advance.\nNote: the untreated population is used to define the basal level of apoptotic/dead cells to estimate the effect of experimental compound(s).\nSorting of viable cells\nTiming: 15 min per sample\nIn this step (summarized in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) cells are analyzed by FACS and gated based on their physical parameters and negativity/positivity for Annexin V and 7-AAD. Viable cells (i.e., double negative for Annexin V and 7-AAD) are then sorted.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic workflow of viable cell sorting using Annexin V/7-AAD staining\nCD4+ T-cells (or PBMCs) are isolated and treated with the investigational compound(s) of interest (step 1) (see also Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). After typically 48 h, cells that were not used for TILDA are stained with Annexin V/7-AAD in binding buffer (step 2) and the population double negative for these markers is separated through sorting (step 3). Sorted cells are then used for downstream Alu-PCR analysis to quantify the amount of integrated HIV-1 DNA (step 4).\nGate live cells based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters excluding the debris localized in the low FSC area of the FACS plot (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative gating strategy for debris exclusion in flow cytometric analysis",
    "Exclusion of apoptotic bodies (debris) is based on the physical parameters visualized and gated on the forward (FSC) and side (SSC) scatter axes. The Figure depicts two examples of debris content/gating in CD4+ T-cells: low amounts of debris in a mostly viable population (left panel) and high amounts of debris in a stressed/dying population (right panel).\nAnalyze and sort healthy/live cells.\nUse the gating in step 14 to further gate live cells based on Annexin V/7-AAD expression, as shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Representative outcomes of Annexin V/7-AAD analysis/sorting\nThe Figure depicts the gating profiles and expected percentages of viable CD4+ T-cells (i.e., negative for both Annexin V and 7-AAD fluorescence) that can be sorted in typical experimental scenarios.\nSort cells that are negative for both Annexin V and 7-AAD fluorescence to obtain a live population for downstream HIV-1 DNA quantification.\nNote: each cell culture includes apoptotic and dead cells which produce apoptotic bodies, characterized by a size that is a fraction of the total cell volumes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). These bodies are normally distributed along the SSC axis but have low FSC values as compared to live cells. As this debris can contain both proteins and nucleic acids, it should not be gated, because it can lead to an overestimation of the HIV-1 DNA quantification. Therefore, only the events located outside this debris region should be gated and analyzed (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). As untreated fresh cells are normally poor in debris, they can be used to setup the appropriate gating strategy that can be then applied to all samples.",
    "Optional: the population of cells double negative for Annexin V/7-AAD (healthy/live cells) can be analyzed and sorted for other relevant markers (e.g., CD4). Although this control could be useful in some studies, it could be biased in other cases, such as when the experimental treatment alters the expression or fluorescence of the marker analyzed (e.g., CD4).\nDay 3–4\nLysate preparation for Alu-PCR\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step previously sorted, viable cells are lysed for downstream Alu-PCR analysis (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Schematic workflow of the Alu-PCR assay\nThe Alu-PCR protocol is used to quantify integrated HIV-1 DNA and, when applied downstream to viable cell sorting (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), can be used to estimate the efficacy of the “kill” phase of the therapeutic strategy (i.e., elimination of infected cells). Following two preparatory steps (proteinase K solution preparation and standard curve preparation), the specific protocol includes four steps. Initially, previously isolated and sorted target cells (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) are lysed in proteinase K buffer (step 1). This is followed by a pre-amplification PCR of the standard curve lysates and of the experimental lysates (Alu-HIV PCR, step 2). The pre-amplificates are then used in a nested qPCR (step 3) with primers directed against the HIV-1 genome or the CD3 gene (housekeeper control). Finally, data are analyzed and the number of integrated DNA copies per million target cells is calculated.\nWash and resuspend cells in PBS and count them.\nPellet cells and add pK solution according to the following formula: (number of cells/30,000) × 15 = X μL of pK solution (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). For example, 60,000 cells will be resuspended in 30 μL of pK solution (60,000/30,000 × 15 = 30 μL).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig9.jpg",
    "Figure 9. Calculation examples of the number of wells required for different cell inputs in Alu-PCR\nEach sample consists of 30,000 cells per well diluted in 15 μL of lysis (pK) buffer.

Moreover, the plate should be prepared and stored in an amplicon-free room, generally designed as pre-PCR room.\nPerform the first round of PCR amplification.\nSet the lid of the PCR instrument at 110°C to avoid sample evaporation.\nSet the parameters of the PCR as shown in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] and start the PCR reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_8.csv",
    "Critical: The pre-amplification is the most important technical step of the Alu-PCR protocol. In this step Alu-LTR amplicons of different size will be generated (up to 10 kb in length). Long denaturation and extension times are required to ensure the generation of these amplicons. In our experience, instruments with low heating and cooling rates perform better, while fast cycling instruments should be avoided. We generally use an Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro instrument with heating and cooling rates of 4°C and 3°C per second, respectively. In addition, we have also tested the ABI Geneamp 9700 and Biometra instruments with positive results. When setting-up the assay for the first time, we suggest performing the tests while running the ACH-2 standards with different PCR instruments and cycles (typically between 8 and 12 cycles). The amplification conditions may be considered satisfactory when all five standard curve dilutions are positive, and the slope of the curve meets the criteria outlined in the “Expected outcome” paragraph.\nPreparation, run and analysis of the nested real-time PCR (“kill” phase)\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step the pre-amplificates prepared as described in the previous paragraph will be incubated with two qPCR reaction mixes, one for the detection of the CD3 gene (housekeeper) and one for the detection of integrated HIV-1 DNA. The CT values obtained will then be used to quantify the amount of integrated HIV-1 DNA in each cell lysate examined.\nPrepare the two nested real-time PCR mixes (i.e., for CD3 and HIV-1 DNA) as described in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_9.csv\nAmounts are calculated for one well.\nNote: if not used immediately the mixes must be stored at 4°C.\nLoad in triplicate the nested PCR plate with 13.6 μL of mix per well keeping separate wells containing either the CD3 mix or the HIV mix.",
    "Recover the Alu-HIV plate at the end of the first PCR run (described in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]) and gently remove the cover film.\nTransfer 10 μL from each well of the Alu-HIV plate in a new PCR plate.\nAdd 90 μL of H2O per well and gently mix with a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer 6.4 μL of the diluted pre-amplification product (i.e., Alu-HIV product) in the nested PCR plate (i.e., both in the wells with CD3 mix and in the wells with HIV mix) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2609-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Schematic depiction of optimal sample/control distribution in the nested qPCR plate for integrated HIV-1 DNA quantification\nDepicted are the steps required for sample/control and master mix preparation which are then combined in the final nested PCR plate. For the master mix, the two reaction mixes for CD3 and HIV are prepared and loaded separately in the nested qPCR plate. For sample/control preparation, the pre-amplification (Alu-HIV) plate is diluted 1:10 in the dilution plate and 6.4 μL of each well from the dilution plate are loaded in the nested qPCR plate. For the color code of the standards/samples, see Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10].\nNote: to increase the throughput of the technique, and if a compatible instrument should be available, it is recommended to load the nested qPCR in a 384 well-plate, as the nested qPCR will contain twice the number of samples (due to the two different mixes) as compared to the Alu-HIV plate (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nSeal the nested PCR plate with a real time PCR grade sealing foil and spin it at 700 × g (or max speed) for 30 s.\nTransfer the plate in the real-time PCR instrument and run the qPCR using the program shown in Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8] below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_10.csv",
    "Note: in case promising pharmacological “shock and kill” candidates are identified, it is strongly recommended to repeat the assay with cells from multiple donors and in increased amounts to improve the precision of the technique.\nAnalyze the data.\nAt the end of the nested qPCR reaction, quantify the CD3 amount per well and the HIV-1 copy number using the absolute quantification method according to the instructions of the qPCR machine used.\nUse the CD3 and HIV-1 DNA quantifications to calculate the ratio (HIV / CD3) × 106 and obtain the copy number of HIV per million cells, as shown in Table 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl9].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2609_11.csv\nNote: the absolute quantification method can be easily calculated by modern qPCR machines performing a second derivative analysis (although alternative methods, such as the fit points analysis, can be used as well). This leads to a count of CD3 and HIV-1 DNA molecules for each well, based on the respective CD3 and HIV standard curves."
