    "Gradient preparationPrepare 8 ml of 10% and 50% sucrose solution each in 1x sucrose gradient buffer for a single gradient (see Recipes, Table 1).Degas the solution under vacuum for 5 min.Mark ultracentrifuge tubes at 50% of tube height with permanent ink marker using the marker block provided with the Gradient Station.Carefully add 10% sucrose solution upto the 50% mark of the tube with a wide gauge cannula.Aspirate the 50% sucrose solution into a syringe and insert the cannula directly to the bottom of the tube through the 10% sucrose solution then slowly layer the heavier solution to the bottom of the tube without disturbing the 10% sucrose solution. The heavier sucrose solution will slowly push the 10% solution up, and the 50% sucrose solution should reach up to the 50% marking of the ultracentrifuge tube.Cover the tube with rubber cap and place the tube in the tube holder on the rotor of the gradient station.Run the following pre-set program in the Gradient Master softwareProgram name: Short Sucrose 10-50% (w/v) FastProgram specification: 10-50%; Step: S1/1; Time: 1 min 45 sec; Angle: 81.5; rpm: 25 (Video 1).Carefully take out the tubes and store vertically at 4 °C for 2 h without disturbance.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Gradient preparation Cell lysate preparation for polysome profilingTreat 70-80% confluent cells in a 10 cm dish with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) by directly adding it to the culture media at 15 to 30 min prior to harvesting.Wash the cells twice with PBS containing 100 µg/ml CHX, and harvest them by scraping into 10 ml ice cold PBS containing 100 µg/ml CHX. Centrifuge at 600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant carefully.Lyse the cell pellet by adding 200 µl of polysome lysis buffer (see Recipes).",
    "Mix gently with 200 µl pipette for a number of times and incubate on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml tube.Measure OD at 254 nm using a spectrophotometer.Overlay 25-50 OD equivalent of lysate gently on top of the gradient in the ultracentrifuge tube without disturbing the gradient. Leave around 2 mm of space in the gradient tube on top of the lysate layer (Figure 1).Weigh each gradient tube in a balance and adjust the weight of each tube containing the gradient to be exactly equal by adding polysome lysis buffer to the overlaid layer without disturbing the gradient.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315033941_3311.jpgFigure 1. 10%-50% sucrose gradient showing 2 mm space on top of gradientUltracentrifugation and fraction collectionPre-cool the rotor assembly and the tube buckets at 4 °C.Load the tubes carefully into the buckets without disturbing the gradients. Load the buckets on the rotor assembly ensuring equal weights in opposing positions. Perform the ultracentrifugation at 111,000 x g (Avg RCF) for 4 h at 4 °C at maximum vacuum. During the last hour of the ultracentrifugation switch on the gradient profiler, UV detector, gradient profiling software and wash the fractionator tubing with running DEPC treated water for several times and dry by running air.Carefully take out the tubes, one at a time, from the buckets and load into the tube holder of the gradient fractionator, and place at the proper position under the collector piston.Run water through the tubing and press auto zero on the UV monitor.Set up the tube length, gradient length (75 cm for SETON open top polyclear tube), fraction number (12 to 16) in the set up window.Run the fractionation and collect fractions (Figure 2) in 1.5 ml tubes and transfer to ice immediately.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315034049_0814.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Ribosomal fractions from MCF7 cells were analysed by 10-50% sucrose density gradient fractionation. A. Ribosomal RNA content, measured at 254 nm, is plotted against fraction numbers (top panel). B. RNA isolated from selected fractions was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR using PDCD4 and GAPDH primers (bottom panel).RNA isolation and RT-PCRAdd 300 µl phenol (citrate saturated, pH 4.5) and 300 µl chloroform to the tubes containing the gradient fractions.Vortex for 30-60 sec.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Carefully transfer the supernatants to new tubes.Add 10 µg glycogen (RNase free) and equal volume of isopropanol and mix by inverting the tubes several times. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml ice cold 75% ethanol.Air dry the RNA pellet and dissolve into 10-20 µl of nuclease free water.Measure the absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer to determine RNA concentration. cDNA synthesis: Setup the following reaction for cDNA synthesis for each RNA. table:",
