    "Isolation and differentiation of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages and incubation with stable isotopeHarvesting Marrow from Mouse Femur and TibiaPrepare macrophage differentiation media (MDM) (see Recipes). Warm up the media in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min before harvesting the marrow. Euthanize the mouse with CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation and place the mouse in a beaker with 100% ethanol. Using sterile scissors in a tissue culture hood, clip the skin and remove the skin from the lower part of the mouse body.Remove the legs from the mouse body with scissors that have been placed in a beaker with 100% ethanol (Figure 1). Remove all remaining hair and skin. Remove muscle, and fat surrounding the bones. Place the bones in 100% ethanol for 5 min. Pour 8 ml of MDM into a sterile 100 mm x 15 mm polystyrene Petri dish. Transfer the bones from the 100% ethanol to the Petri dish with media. Separate at the knee joint the femoral bones from the tibia and fibula. Be careful not to break the bones. Cut off each end of the bone as shown in Figure 1. You should have a total of 3 bones for each mouse leg in one Petri dish with media.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223307_2701.jpgFigure 1. Isolating bone marrow from mouse tibia, fibula and femur. The mouse was euthanized. A. Image illustrating where to cut and remove the leg. B. Schematic diagram of the positions to be cut at mouse leg for isolating bone marrow. Cut the legs at position 1 (red dashed lines). Next remove the fur, skin and muscle from the leg. Then cut the bones at the red dotted lines to isolate the bones in the order indicated (numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5). Note that each bone is cut medially and distally.",
    "Fill 26 G needle/1 ml syringe with macrophage differentiation media (MDM) (see Recipes). Put the tip of the needle into the bone and flush the bone marrow from both ends of the bone (Figure 2). Do this for the femur, fibula and tibia. Repeat flushing the marrow out of the bones until the bones turn white.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223322_1436.jpgFigure 2. Flushing the bones. A.

Flushing of the bones to remove bone marrow Collect the cells in MDM and pass them through a 70 μm cell strainer into a sterile conical tube. This removes debris that may contaminate your cells (see Video 2). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removing debris from isolated cells Spin down cells at 1,950 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Count the cells and resuspend the pellets with macrophage differentiation media (MDM) so that you can seed 5 x 106 cells and MDM into each well of the 6-well plate.Incubate plates for 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change media every three days with freshly made media.Differentiation of macrophage to M1 or M2When BMDM are almost confluent (at Day ~7), replace with new MDM. In order to polarize the macrophages, we used either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-4 (IL-4).For classic M1 activation: Add lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100 ng/ml (10 μl of stock solution into 4 ml MDM) and incubate for 4 h.For classic M2 activation: Add interleukin-4 (IL-4) at a dose of 40 ng/ml (1.6 μl of stock solution into 4 ml of MDM) and incubate for 4 h.",
    "Metabolism studies using U-13C GlucoseReplace the MDM in the differentiated macrophages (already treated with either LPS or IL-4) with medium that contains no glucose, 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, 100 ng/ml LPS, 5 mM U-13C glucose (99.98% enriched) and incubate overnight at 37 °C. We did this because the gene of being investigated, Pck1, is activated in the fasted state, so we removed the glucose and insulin. At the next day, collect the media and cells. To collect media, pipet off half of the media. Keep 1 ml of the media for measurement of isotope enrichment. To collect cells, scrape the wells to dislodge the cells. Pipet up the cells and remaining media and place into conical tubes. Spin down the cells at 1,950 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend the pellets in 50 μl of 1x PBS. Save 20 μl for measurement of protein concentration by Bradford assay. Freeze sample at -20 °C to lyse cells. The protein concentrations are used for normalization in the metabolite analysis. Cells are for analysis by GC-MS. In our case, we sent the cells to the Case Western Reserve University Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) for analysis by GC-MS.Bradford assay: Carry out the assay according to the manufacturer’s directions (Quick StartTM Bradford Protein Assay[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4110065A.pdf]). We used 2 mg/ml BSA as a standard. Pipette 20 μl of the resuspended cells into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and add 1 ml of 1x Dye reagent from the Quick StartTM Bradford Protein Assay. Mix the sample and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Place the sample in a cuvette. Set the spectrophotometer to 595 nm. Zero the instrument with the blank sample (100 μl water and 1 ml of 1x Dye reagent).",
    "Measure the absorbance of the BSA standards and the unknown (macrophage cells). Determine the amount of protein in the sample from the standard curve (if 2 μl aliquot of sample yields a 595 nm value equivalent to 250 μg/ml of protein, then the cell sample would have a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml).For the study on Pck1MC-KO macrophages, the cells were sent to the Case Western Reserve University Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) for analysis by GC-MS. The following section displays an example for the study of metabolites in the LPS-activated macrophage. The purpose of the example study was to compare the metabolites in Pck1MC-KO (experimental) and Pck1fl/fl (control) macrophages after a 24 h treatment of LPS.Analysis of the citric acid cycle (CAC) and related intermediates (such as citrate, succinate and malate) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)Cell sample preparationBriefly, this approach utilizes the rapid reaction of silylating reagents with alcohols, acids and amines to form silyl derivatives (Yang et al., 2008a and 2008b; Kombu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015). Commercial silylating reagents are available as combinations to accelerate the reaction, as well as to react with the hindered group. For example either a mixture of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) to form a TMS derivative, or a mixture of N-Methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) and t-butyldimethylchlorosilane (TBDMS) to form TBDMS derivatives can be used (Yang et al., 2008a and 2008b; Kombu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015).For absolute quantification of analytes, as previously described (Ko et al., 2018): 50 μl of cells are spiked with selected internal reference standards such as ~5 nmole of each metabolite [13C6] citrate, [13C4] succinate, and/or [2H4]-3-hydroxyglutarate.",
    "Note: Choice of internal reference standards are dependent on precursor tracer used such that there is no interference of the M+ labeling from the tracer versus the labeled standards added; its best to use non-endogenously produced reference standards, such as tricarballylic acid.  Homogenize the cells with 3-5 ml of 5% acetic acid in methanol/water (1:1) extraction buffer (chilled on ice) for 2 min on ice bath.Centrifuge the homogenate at 670 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant into a glass test tube and save on ice and process immediately Note: May freeze the supernatant at -80 °C until assaying for GC-MS. TMSC/TBDMS derivatization procedure: pipette 100-200 μl of the supernatant collected in Steps B1b and B1c into 16 mm x 125 mm disposable borosilicate glass tubes.Dry completely under nitrogen gas (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223351_8647.jpgFigure 3. Nitrogen DryerReact by adding 70 μl of either derivatizing TBDMS reagents (in a pyridine-based solvent) and heat on a heating block at 80 °C for 1 h (Figure 4).Note: May react at room temperature overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223415_8397.jpgFigure 4. Heat block with tubes for derivatizationTransfer to GC insert and cap (Figure 5); follow GC parameters and the monitored SIM ions (m/z) for each analyte, as outlined (Yang et al., 2008a and 2008b; Kombu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223439_6153.jpgFigure 5. Samples put into GC tubesGC-MS AnalysisTMSC or TBDMS derivatives are analyzed using an Agilent 5973-MSD equipped with an Agilent 6890 GC system, and a DB-17MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm; may use 60 m). The mass spectrometer is operated under electron impact mode (EI) or ammonia chemical ionization mode (CI) and selective ion monitoring (SIM) m/z for each analyte; When stable isotopes are applied, the SIM for M0-M+ m/z are monitored (Yang et al.",
    ", 2008a and 2008b; Kombu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015) (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223456_3856.jpgFigure 6. GC-MS apparatus used in this protocolAfter the GC-MS run, calculate the area under the curve for succinate, citrate and malate and the ratios to the internal standard (Table 1). After background correction, calculate the MPE% using the following formula: MPE% = [(13C labeled M1 thru M + for each of the CAC intermediates) x (13C labeled + unlabeled) - 1] x 100 (Table 1) Table 1. The calculation of mole percent enrichments from 13C-glucose into citrate, succinate and malate. M0, M1 to M3 were calculated based on the ratio of labeled intracellular metabolites to unlabeled and were corrected with reference to the intracellular volume of the extracted cells (Feldberg et al., 2009). The %MPE was calculated as %m2 = [(13C labeled M1 thru M + for each of the CAC intermediates) x (13C labeled + unlabeled) - 1] x 100.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829223738_5646.jpg"
