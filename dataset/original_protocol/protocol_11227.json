    "Informed written consent was obtained from all patients (from the Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, Norway according to local ethics committee regulations). Our protocol follows the guidelines of our institution’s human research ethics committee. \n1. Generation of uniform size tumor spheroids\nNOTE: Stem-like cells are cultured in neurobasal medium complemented with B27 supplement, heparin, FGF-2, penicillin, and streptomycin, as described in previous articles12. These cells spontaneously form spheroids in culture.\nWash the tumor cells with 5 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubate the cells with 0.5-1 mL dissociation enzyme (see Table of Materials) for 5 minutes at 37 °C.\nWash with 4-4.5 mL PBS and add 10 mL of the complete growth medium (complete neurobasal medium, cNBM).\nCount the cells using an automatic counting technique with trypan blue and a cell counting chamber slide.\nTo generate 100 spheroids with 104 cells per spheroid (according to preferred size), mix 106 cells in 8 mL of NBM with 2 mL of 2% methylcellulose.\nTransfer the suspension to a sterile system container and dispense 100 µL/well with a multichannel pipette into a 96 well round bottom plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Equal sized spheroids will form and can be used after 3-4 days.\n2. Three-dimensional experiments\nProliferation\n\t\nPreparation\n\t\t\nSuspend inhibitors (e.g., rotenone as in Figure 4A) and chemicals in 100 µL of medium and add to the 100 µL of medium in each well (i.e., one spheroid per well).\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.\nImage acquisition and analysis\n\t\t\nTake pictures with a video microscope in brightfield to create a series of conditions at T0 and the following times expected.",
    "Use Fiji to analyze pictures either manually or in a semiautomated manner. To do so manually, draw a circle around the spheroid core with the freehand selection tool and measure the area of each spheroid. To analyze the images in a semiautomated manner, use the macro shown in Supplementary Document 1 with //Core Area only.\nInvasion\n\t\nPreparation\n\t\t\nPrepare the collagen matrix in a tube on ice with type I collagen at 1 mg/mL final concentration, 1x PBS, 0.023xVcollagen, 1 M sodium hydroxide, and sterile H2O. Incubate the solution on ice for 30 min.\nCollect spheroids from the round bottom well plate in 500 µL tubes and wash 2x with 200 µL 1x PBS.\nPipette the spheroids carefully into 100 µL of the collagen matrix and insert in the center of a well in normal 96 well plates.\nIncubate the collagen gel for 30 min at 37 °C and then add cNBM on top of the gel. Inhibitors or activators (e.g., hydrogen chloride as shown in Figure 4B, 4C) can be added to the medium at this step.\nImage acquisition and analysis\n\t\t\nTake pictures sequentially with a video microscope in brightfield mode 24 h after collagen inclusion.\nUse Fiji to analyze pictures either manually or in a semiautomated manner. To do so manually, draw around the core and the total area of the spheroid with the freehand selection tool and measure the invasive area of each spheroid by subtract total area with core area. To analyze the images in a semiautomated manner, use the macro as indicated in Supplementary Document 1 to determine the invasive area.\nMigration\n\t\nPreparation\n\t\t\nCoat a 6 well plate with Matrigel (0.2 mg/mL) in NBM for 30 min at 37 °C, then remove the Matrigel and add 2 mL of cNBM.",
    "Transfer spheroids into 50 µL of cNBM from the round bottom well plate to the 6 well plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C and wait 30 min for the spheroids to adhere.\nAfter 24 h of incubation, stain with 10 ng/mL of Hoechst and incubate 30 min at 37 °C.\nImage acquisition and analysis\n\t\t\nObtain images using a video microscope in brightfield. A 405 nm laser is used for visualization of Hoechst staining.\nUse Fiji software to analyze pictures and run the macro as indicated in Supplementary Document 1.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Touching the bottom of the well or completely removing the supernatant damages the spheroids. For collagen type I gel handling, keep the gel on ice to avoid collagen polymerization, do not add an acidic component because the change in pH will affect the compactness of the gel, and pipette cells rapidly into the collagen to prevent cell death and the degradation of the gel.\n3. Fiji Macro\nNOTE: Fiji is an image analysis program developed in the public domain that allows the development of macros to speed up image analysis. Manual analysis is also possible, but this is a slow process and may introduce biases. Images can be imported by drag-and-drop in the software and quantified with the ROI Manager Tools plugin. The procedure used in this study is described below:\nOpen the macro window: Plugins | Macros | Interactive Interpreter.\nCopy and paste the following adapted purple loop. Keep the purple sentences and add the green sentences of interest (Supplementary Document 1).\nTo analyze the entire series, adjust the parameters in red for a specific quantification and run the macro using Macros | Run Macro or pressing Ctrl+R.\nCheck and, if necessary, manually adapt the region of interest (ROI).\n4. Electron microscopy of spheroids",
    "NOTE: Most of the following steps must be done in a chemical hood.\nFixation step\n\t\nCollect the spheroid with a cut pipette tip, put it in a 1.5 mL tube, and wash 1x with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB).\nFix the spheroid overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PB.\nReplace the fixation solution with a solution of 1% PFA in 0.1 M PB followed by sample preparation.\nSample preparation\n\t\nTransfer the spheroids into a strainer and put them in a glass beaker in order to avoid spheroid damage.\nCarefully wash 3x with 0.1 M PB.\nIncubate with osmium for 2 h in the dark. Dilute osmium to 4% in 1% 0.1 M PB buffer.\nCarefully wash 3x with 0.1 M PB.\n\t\t\nDehydrate as follows: soak in 50% ethanol for 10 min, 70% ethanol for 10 min, 2x 90% ethanol for 15 min, 2x 100% ethanol for 20 min, and 2x acetone for 30 min.\nIncubate the samples in a 50/50 mixture of acetone/resin for 2 h. During this step, prepare the EPON resin (Embed-812: 11.25 g; DDSA: 9 g; NMA: 4.5 g).\nDiscard the acetone/resin mixture, replace with freshly prepared resin and incubate overnight.\nReplace the resin by a new one and incubate between 2-6 h.\nAdd the spheroids in resin into a mold at 60 °C for 48-72 h.\nSubscription Required.
