    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEmbryo preparation\nTiming: 19 h\nEmbryos obtained by intercrossing the Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 zebrafish line are collected and grown until 17 h post-fertilization (hpf) (about the 16 somite stage).\nTransfer the Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 zebrafish into the breeding tank in which the male and female fish are separated by a divider during the afternoon or evening (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/555-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of the dechorionated zebrafish embryos at 17 hpf\n(A) Set up zebrafish to breed in the separate breeding tank (step 1).\n(B) Initiate breeding by removing the divider separating the male and female fish (step 2).\n(C) Rinse the embryos on the strainer with 0.03% sea salt solution (step 5).\n(D) Cleaned embryos on the strainer.\n(E) The embryos transferred into a 10-cm petri dish containing E3 medium (step 6).\n(F and G) The 17 hpf embryos transferred into a beaker containing E3 medium (step 8b).\n(H) The embryos treated with the Pronase solution (step 8d). Note that the chorions start to break open (arrow).\n(I) Dechorionated embryos in a 10-cm petri dish containing E3 medium (step 8g).\nNote: To stimulate good quality egg production, the day-night light cycle (14 h light/10 h dark cycle) is controlled with an automatic timer, because zebrafish reproduction depends on the light cycle.\nWhen the light comes on the following morning, remove the divider separating the male and female fish to initiate breeding (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Breeding tanks have a removable insert with holes to prevent adult fish from eating their eggs.\nNote: Reducing the amount of water inside the tank facilitates zebrafish breeding.\nRemove the adult fish 15–30 min after the beginning of spawning.\nCollect the embryos by pouring the water and the embryos through a mesh tea strainer.",
    "Rinse the embryos on the strainer well with 0.03% sea salt solution (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nWash the embryos off into a 10-cm petri dish using E3 medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nKeep the embryos in petri dishes containing E3 medium at a density of less than 30 embryos per dish until 17 hpf at 28°C.\nNote: Do not incubate the embryos at a density of more than 30 embryos per dish to prevent developmental delay.\nPreparation of the cells dissociated from the embryos\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThe Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 embryos are dissociated into a single cell suspension. Screen the embryos with a fluorescence stereo microscope in advance, selecting the brightest embryos.\nDechorionation of zebrafish embryos\nAt 17 hpf, transfer the Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 zebrafish embryos into glass beakers (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 2G).\nIncubate the embryos in the Pronase solution at 20–25°C for 5–10 min.\nDuring the incubation, gently mix the embryos once per minute and check the condition of the chorions under a microscope.\nWash the embryos thoroughly with E3 medium several times when the chorions start to break open (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nPipet the embryos back and forth in E3 medium using plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the chorions.\nCollect the dechorionated embryos in the 10-cm petri dish containing E3 medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nEnzymatic dissociation of the embryos\nTransfer fifteen embryos into a 2 mL-Eppendorf tube.\nNote: If possible, select embryos at the same stage by counting the number of somites.\nWash the embryos with 1 mL of PBS once.\nIncubate the embryos with 500 μL of 1× Liberase solution at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: During the incubation, gently mix the embryos every 20 min using a P1000 single channel Pipette.\nAfter the incubation, add 1 mL of Liberase termination solution to the tube and mix to terminate the enzymatic reaction.",
    "Dissociate the embryonic cells by gentle pipetting using a P1000 Pipette.\nFilter the dissociated cells through a 100-μm cell strainer.\nCollect the cells in new 2 mL-Eppendorf tubes.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,600 rpm (approximately 250 × g) for 3 min at 15–25°C.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of DPBS.\nAdhesion of LPM cells dissociated from the embryos to the fibronectin-coated dish\nTiming: 13.5 h\nThe LPM cells dissociated from the Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 zebrafish embryos are allowed to adhere to the fibronectin-coated dish.\nPellet the cells suspended in DPBS (from step 9-j) by centrifugation at 1,600 rpm (approximately 250 × g) for 3 min at 15–25°C.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of Leibovitz’s L15 culture medium.\nPlate 200 μL of the resuspended cells onto the fibronectin-coated glass bottom dish (12-mm diameter glass bottom).\nNote: The cells derived from the embryos contain not only GFP-positive LPM cells but also GFP-negative cells.\nOptional: While the GFP-positive LPM cells can be isolated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, this step might result in cell damage.\nIncubate the cells, thereby allowing them to adhere to the fibronectin-coated dish, at 28°C for 13 h.\nStaining of the LPM cells adhering to the fibronectin-coated dish\nTiming: 2 days\nThe cells adhering to the fibronectin-coated dish are stained with rabbit anti-GFP and mouse anti-vinculin antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 564-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies and with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated phalloidin to analyze cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions in the LPM cells.\nAfter the incubation, gently wash the adherent cells with PBS twice.\nFix the cells with fixative solution for 20 min at 15–25°C.\nPermeabilize the cells with permeabilization solution for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash the cells with PBS three times, briefly.",
    "Incubate the cells with blocking solution for 90 min at 15–25°C.\nIncubate the cells with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:300 dilution) and mouse anti-vinculin antibody (1:300 dilution) dissolved in PBS at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nWash the cells with PBS three times for 10 min each.\nLabel the proteins reacting with primary antibodies by incubating the cells with PBS containing Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 564-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 2 h at 15–25°C.\nCritical: Execute steps 22–26 in the dark.\nWash the cells with PBS six times for 10 min each.\nIncubate the cells with PBS containing Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000 dilution) for 2 h at 15–25°C to visualize filamentous actin.\nWash the cells with PBS three times for 10 min each.\nSubmerge the cells with PBS.\nPause Point: The stained cells can be stored in the dark at 4°C for several days.\nFluorescence imaging of the LPM cells adhering to the fibronectin-coated dish\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFluorescence images of the LPM cells adhering to the fibronectin-coated dish are obtained with a FluoView FV1000 confocal upright microscope system equipped with a water-immersion 60× lens (LUMFL N 60×/1.10 W), 473-, 559-, and 635-nm laser lines, and a GaAsP photomultiplier tube controlled with FluoView ASW software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/555-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
