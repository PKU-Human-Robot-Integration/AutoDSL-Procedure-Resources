    "The SCSA test is a two-fold simultaneous flow cytometric measure of (1) the extent of sperm nuclear single (ss) and double (ds) DNA breaks, and (2) chromatin structure, in thousands of sperm in a fresh or frozen/thawed semen sample.\nMaterials\nFresh or frozen/thawed semen samples (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-prot-0003])\nTNE buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0008])\nAcid-detergent solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0002])\nAcridine Orange (AO) stock solution, 1.0 mg/ml (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0001])\nAO staining buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0005])\nAO staining solution (working solution) (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0006])\nAO equilibration buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0007])\nFCM tubing cleanser (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0009])\nPurified water for reagents and FCM Sheath fluid (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0010])\nWater bath (37°C)\nHigh-resolution electronic balance\nAdjustable, 0.20–0.80 ml automatic bottle dispenser for the acid-detergent solution with glass amber bottle (Fisher Scientific)\nAdjustable, 0.80–3.0 ml automatic bottle dispenser for the AO staining solution in glass amber bottle (Fisher Scientific)\nPipettors: adjustable 0–10 μl, 10–100 μl, 100–1000 μl, and a nonadjustable 200 μl (Fisher Scientific)\nVortex mixer\nTubes that fit the flow cytometer are used to mix the components of the SCSA test\nCrushed ice buckets (3) for samples and reagent bottles\nContainer with ∼10% household bleach solution in which to place the unused portion of semen samples and used laboratory supplies\nStopwatch\nStrongly suggested: a laminar flow biological safety hood to prepare the samples\n35 L LN2 tank or ultracold (≥70°C) freezer\n2-ml cryotubes for freezing semen samples (Fisher)\n0.5–1.0 ml snap cap cryotubes for storing numerous “reference samples” (Sarstedt)\nClinical specimen jars, polystyrene, sterile (VWR Scientific)\npH meter\nRefrigerator (4°C) for reagents (Do not use refrigerator freezer with automatic defroster to store semen samples because the rise and fall of temperature will cause DNA damage)\nLN2 dry shippers or well-insulated dry ice containers to ship frozen semen samples\nFluorescent beads, Fluoresbrite, Plain YG 6 μ (Polysciences)\nAluminum foil",
    "Disposable gloves (human samples are handled using disposable gloves in a biological safety cabinet)\nFlow cytometer (FCM) set up as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-prot-0004].\nThe SCSA test requires only a minimally configured FCM consisting of a 488 nm laser and two detectors for green (FITC filter) and red (630LP filter) fluorescence and interfaced to a computer. Numerous makes and models are available worldwide.\nUltracold freezer (−70° to −110°C) or, preferably, a 35 L LN2 tank\n1. Fresh liquified semen samples can be diluted and measured immediately. Single frozen samples in cryotubes are immersed in a 37°C water bath, just until the last remnant of ice disappears.\n2. Depending on sperm density in the semen samples, transfer a sufficient volume of fresh or flash-frozen/thawed semen into 200 µl TNE buffer to attain an approximate 1–2×106 sperm/ml.\nFor many semen samples, a transfer of 5–10 µl is a good guess.\n3. Add 400 μl acid detergent solution to the 200 μl sperm suspension. Mix on lab vortex.\n4. After 30 s, add 1.20 ml AO staining solution with an automatic bottle dispenser. Mix on lab vortex.\n5. Place the sample tube into the flow cytometer and start sample flow.\n6. Start acquisition of FCM data at 3 min.\nThis allows ample time for AO equilibration in the sample and hydrodynamic stabilization of the sample within the FCM fluidics, both important aspects of AO staining.\n7. Check the sperm flow rate. If the rate is >300 cells/sec, a new sample is made at the appropriate dilution.\nThis previous sample cannot be diluted with AO buffer to lower the concentration. A fresh sample must be prepared. Do not change the sample and sheath flow valve settings to increase or decrease the sample flow rate during an SCSA measurement period.",
    "8. Collect 5000 or more FCM events. The actual number of sperm included in these measurements varies with the ratio of sperm to non-sperm cells in the semen sample.\n9. For verification of a proper SCSA measurement and for statistical considerations, samples should be independently measured with a second prepared sample in succession.\nIt is important to measure one sample at a time rather than preparing several samples and placing the samples in an automatic carousel. Delayed measuring of prepared SCSA samples can produce artifacts for distinct reasons including ongoing oxidative stress causing further DNA breakage and absorbance of the AO stain to the sample tube altering the AO/DNA concentration required for differential staining of ss and ds DNA. Furthermore, measuring one sample at a time, followed by a second independent measure of an aliquot of the first sample, allows full control over each sample. If numerous samples were placed in an automatic carousel, any alteration of sample stream flow by a contaminating substance may ruin the entire batch. Since infertility clinics typically send only one frozen semen sample per patient, the thawed sample used hours ago may have deteriorated and no longer be of true value.\n10. When measuring a batch of clinical samples, measure each sample as follows:\n         \nWhile the first measurement is being done, the repeat sample can be prepared and measured immediately after the first is completed.\nFollowing the repeat sample, place the AO staining solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0005]) in the FCM and let that run until the next sample is ready. This step flushes out any adhering sperm in the fluidics and maintains equilibration of the AO with the fluidic sample tubing.\n11. After the last sample has been measured, flush the FCM fluidic system with FCM tubing cleanser.",
    "The flow cytometric SCSA test measures the percentage of sperm in a semen sample with broken (fragmented) DNA. This is termed the %DNA Fragmentation Index (%DFI). The SCSA test simultaneously measures the % of sperm in a semen sample with High DNA Stainability (%HDS). These sperm have an increased ratio of nuclear histones to protamines that causes an abnormal chromatin structure, which may cause abnormal readout of genes during early embryo growth.\nMethod 1 is done without a strict setup of the FCM for repeat measures with preset green and red fluorescence values. SCSA diagnostic labs that measure thousands of clinical semen samples use Method 2, in which all sample values are compared to a fixed reference sample set at fixed green and red fluorescence values on a linear 1024 × 1024 cytogram.\nMethod 1. For a quick measurement of one to a small series of samples without the use of a “reference sample” (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-prot-0005]), place the AO-stained semen sample in the flow cytometer, adjust the FCM green and red fluorescent gains so that the AO-green fluorescent (515–530 nm BP) main population is just short of halfway up the Y axis on a linear 1024 × 1024 (or equivalent) cytogram and the AO-red fluorescence (630 nm LP) is at about 1/5 of the total X axis.\nMake four computer gates on the green versus red cytograms as seen in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0001].\n         \n1.Make a horizontal gate near the top of the cytogram to exclude diploid somatic epithelial cells and leukocytes.\n2.Make a horizontal gate touching the top of the cigar-shaped main sperm population. Above this line are the sperm with an abnormal excess of histones (HDS fraction).\n3.Make a straight or curved gate on the right side of the cigar-shaped normal sperm population.",
    "4.Make a 45-degree angle gate that touches the bottom of the cigar-shaped main population that excludes apoptotic and dead sperm and other seminal debris.\n5.The region between 3 and 4 is the sperm with broken DNA (%DFI).\n6.Use the computer to calculate %DFI and %HDS sperm.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9144c1d7-e534-491e-9a6d-418a5931b924/cpz1508-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\n(A) AO-Green (FITC 525 nm) versus AO-Red (630 nm LP) fluorescence cytogram using an Ortho Cytofluorograf 30 FCM. Raw FCM data showing each of ∼5000 sperm as a single dot on scattergram. Y axis: green AO fluorescence of DNA stainability. X axis: red AO fluorescence of sperm with broken DNA. Dotted line at 75 on Y axis marks the upper boundary of DNA staining of normal sperm chromatin; above that line are sperm (dots) with partially uncondensed chromatin allowing more AO DNA stainability (HDS sperm).

(B) Raw data from left panel are converted by SCSAsoft (or equivalent software) to total AO DNA stainability (Y axis: red + green fluorescence/2) versus DNA fragmentation Index (X axis: red/red + green AO fluorescence × 1000). This transforms the angled sperm bullet display in the left panel to a vertical pattern that is used for sometimes more accurate determination of the percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA (%DFI) and transforms the DFI sperm to a horizontal pattern. (C) Frequency histogram of data from middle panel showing computer gating of %DFI. Clinical report: %DFI = 19.0 %HDS = 3.5.",
    "Method 2. Conversion of green versus red cytogram (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0001]) to a cytogram (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0001]) of Y = green + red fluorescence (total)/2 versus X = red/red = green fluorescence (mean DFI = scale 0–1) × 1000.\nFrom the Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0001] cytogram, compute the frequency histogram (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0001]) with the cut-off point between sperm with and without broken DNA.\nFor human clinics, there is interest in only %DFI and %HDS. However, extensive use of other parameters (% moderate and high DFI, Mean DFI, and SD DFI) has been very useful in research studies of human and animal sperm as seen in many manuscripts (Evenson, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0009]; Evenson, Baer, & Jost, 1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0011]; Evenson & Wixon, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0018]). Mean DFI (formerly termed “alpha t”) is calculated as red/red+ green fluorescence) and is a measure of the shift in FCM channels (0 to 1000) from green to red fluorescence (Darzynkiewicz, Traganos, Sharpless, & Melamed, 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0004]).\nOur laboratory uses Method 2 as it lends itself to easy, rapid, and precise comparative determination of %DFI and %HDS on thousands of clinical samples via SCSAsoft or equivalent software. This method requires the use of a “reference sample” to set the FCM green and red fluorescent gains to near exact positions on the cytogram; for our Ortho FCM we set AO-green at 475 ± 5/1024 and AO red at 125 ± 5/1024.\nFigure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0002] shows a high correlation (R2 = 0.951) between %DFI measures on human semen aliquots measured on two different FCMs in two different countries.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ce8dc6c6-6f3b-4089-b390-e8077a55aabd/cpz1508-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCorrelations (R2 = 0.951) between %DFI measured from same frozen/ thawed human semen aliquots (n = 57) on an Ortho Cytofluorograf 30 FCM at SCSA Diagnostics in the USA and a FACSCalibur FCM at Andrology Center in Coimbatore, India.

    "The SCSA test is a medical diagnostic test that must be certified by various national and state agencies, such as CLIA and the New York State Department of Health in the USA. Since our laboratory was the inventor of the SCSA test using the Ortho FCM, it was grandfathered as the test to be matched by others providing a clinical diagnosis. The flow cytometer brand must also be approved for SCSA testing. Thus, our laboratory will send to a new diagnostic center about 15–20 frozen semen aliquots that have been measured on our original Ortho FCM and these samples are then measured in the new diagnostic lab. The comparative data must match closely to that measured on our Ortho FCM or our certified FACScan FCM. Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-fig-0002] shows the excellent correlations of %DFI on 57 semen samples obtained on two different FCMs.",
    "1. A physician, clinic, patient, or non-patient can go to an SCSA Diagnostics testing website, for example, www.scsatest.com[href=http://www.scsatest.com], or the websites of other SCSA diagnostic centers worldwide and click on: “order now”. Enter personal identifying details, name of clinic or physician if relevant, credit card number, and request to have a cooled LN2 dry shipper sent by FedEx to home or clinic delivery address and phone number.\nPrior to shipping a semen sample to an SCSA diagnostic center, it is necessary to do the following to ensure a “fresh” semen sample.\n2. To obtain “fresh semen”, patients are advised to abstain for 2–3 days prior to collection. However, if the abstinence time was a week or two or more prior to this 2 to 3-day abstinence period, then to obtain fresh sperm and not include dying/apoptotic sperm, we advise having two ejaculations, such as on Wednesday and Friday, and then collect a clinical sample on Monday. Alternatively, fresh sperm can be obtained by ejaculation morning and night for one day and then collect a clinical sample 2 days later. This is advised as sperm are stored in the epididymis after production in the testis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, and the fact that the epididymis does not entirely empty all sperm upon ejaculation, meaning those retained sperm have increased DNA damage.",
    "3. As per detailed instructions enclosed in the LN2 shipping tank, ejaculate by masturbation into a plastic clinical specimen container. Wait about 20–30 min for liquefaction of the semen. Freshly ejaculated semen consists of a large amount of a gel-like substance within which the sperm are lodged. Normally this substance “liquefies” by semen proteases after approximately 30 min at room temperature and frees the sperm, thereby providing a homogenous suspension of sperm that ensures a random sampling of all sperm that then can be measured immediately by the SCSA test.\n4a. To ship frozen samples:\nUsing the SCSA test kit enclosed plastic pipette, transfer about 0.25–0.35 ml semen into each of two or three 2.0-ml cryovials. Tightly cap the cryovials and immediately flash freeze in the LN2 tank. Close the tank and seal with a zip tie. Contact FedEx (or equivalent service) for pickup of the LN2 tank to be delivered to a laboratory that performs SCSA testing (many in Asia, Europe, India, Scandinavia, and North and South America).\nImportantly, and in contrast to the WHO recommendation (WHO, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0024]) raw clinical semen samples being sent for SCSA testing must be flash-frozen without dilution in buffer or any cryoprotectants. (Note, however, that a semen sample that has been frozen with cryoprotectants yields the same data as those without cryoprotectants.)\nSemen samples may be kept for up to several hours at room temperature prior to measuring or freezing without significant loss of quality, allowing for collections within a medical institution and transport to the flow cytometry laboratory.\nCryoprotectants are not needed since flash-frozen sperm and those frozen with a cryoprotectant provide equivalent SCSA data. This feature is unique to mammalian sperm cells due to the highly condensed, crystalline nature of the nuclear chromatin.\n4b. To transport samples locally:",
    "If transport of freshly collected semen is required outside of a building complex to an FCM lab, the sample may be transported in an insulated box or jacket pocket to maintain ambient temperature, that is, to keep from freezing or put on liquid ice if the temperature is hot leading to increased %DFI not representative of fresh sperm.\nAll human biological fluids are considered potentially infectious. Always observe precautions.\n         \ni. Dry ice.\nSemen samples shipped on dry ice are placed into a well-insulated commercial shipping container. Small chunks of dry ice are first placed on the bottom of the shipping container, the sample box is placed near the center of the shipping box, and then more dry ice is placed around the box. Eight to 10 pounds (lbs) of dry ice, broken up into pieces, in an insulated shipping container are satisfactory for FedEx Priority overnight shipments from any point in the United States during any season. This amount of ice will keep samples frozen for at least 2–3 days; however, shipments should be made only on Monday through Wednesday in the rare event that the shipment is “mis-shipped” or is held up for a day due to weather-related problems. Dry ice shipments sent from London on Monday afternoon to our facility in South Dakota typically arrive on Wednesday.\nAirline couriers have a hazardous goods restriction limiting the total amount of dry ice in a container to 5 lbs. By the time the box is picked up and transported to the airport, we estimate that the ice weight will be ∼5 lbs.",
    "The advantage of shipping frozen semen samples in dry ice containers is that the shipping costs are only for one-way shipping, thus reducing the cost of sample transport. The total weight of a dry ice shipper is less than the LN2 shipping tank, also leading to lesser shipping costs. The two disadvantages are that most clinics do not have dry ice easily available, and furthermore, the dry ice pack stays cold for only two to three days in contrast to LN2 shippers that stay cold for 7–10 days.\n         \nii. LN2 shipper tanks.\nThese tanks can hold numerous 2.0-ml cryotubes. The LN2 temperature holds for approximately 7–10 days depending on ambient temperatures. A label on the outside of the tank reads: DRY SHIPPER NON-HAZARDOUS PER FX-08 to meet airline regulations.",
    "1. Ensure optical alignment of FCM using standard fluorescent beads (see above) as directed by instructions for the FCM used.\n2. Very importantly, the AO equilibration buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-rec-0007]) must be passed through the FCM fluidic system for ∼15 min to saturate the tubing with AO molecules that otherwise might be removed from the measured semen sample.\n3. Using the reference semen sample (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-prot-0005]), adjust the green and red fluorescent gains so that the mean green (AO – Green-525 nm) and red (AO – red- 630 LP) fluorescence values are at 475/1024 ± 5 and 125/1024 ± 5 channels, respectively, or equivalent ratio in FCMs using a different scaling.\n4. The green and red fluorescent signals are processed and displayed as peak (or height) rather than area signals.",
    "To make strict comparisons between sperm samples from human fertility clinics (Evenson, Djira, Kasperson, & Christianson, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0013]) or in animal or toxicology studies (Evenson, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0007], 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0009], Evenson & Wixon, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.508#cpz1508-bib-0018]), all samples need to have a reference point that requires precise repeat instrument settings whether done on measurements on the same or different days. These settings are obtained by using aliquots of a single semen sample called the “reference sample” (this is not a “control” sperm from a fertile donor). A semen sample that demonstrates heterogeneic DNA integrity (e.g., ∼15% DFI) is chosen as a reference sample and then diluted with cold (4°C) TNE buffer to a working concentration of 1–2×106 cells/ml. Several hundred 300 μl aliquots of this dilution are quickly placed into 0.5-ml snap-cap vials and frozen at −70°C to −100°C in a freezer or, preferably, in an LN2 tank. These reference samples are used to set the red and green photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage gains to yield the same mean red and green fluorescence levels from day to day. The mean red and green fluorescence values are set at ∼125/1024 ± 5 and ∼475/1024 ± 5 channels, respectively, or equivalent numbers depending on the scaling of the FCM. These settings allow for the DFI sperm to fall mostly at a downward 45° angle; this provides “room” on the cytogram to detect the increased levels of HDS and DFI of abnormal sperm.",
    "The values established by a laboratory should be used consistently thereafter. Strict adherence to keeping the reference values in this range must be maintained throughout the measurement period. Obviously, it would be advantageous to prepare all batches of reference samples from the same individual donor. However, if a new donor is used, then first set the FCM PMTs from the previous reference sample to be at the same X and Y channel positions, then measure the new reference sample, note the red and green mean values, and use these values for the following studies. Since reference samples can be stored in LN2 for years, a donor could provide enough samples for thousands of reference aliquots."
