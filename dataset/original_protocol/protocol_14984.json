    "CAUTION: For all subsequent work, it is very important that the yellow-colored polyimide foil must not be touched with unprotected fingers, because of possible contaminations to the sample holder. Also, the usage of protected forceps is highly recommended.\n1. The sample holder\nUse one of the three types of sample holder.\n\tNOTE: Three different versions of the new developed sample holder are shown in Figure 1. All of them contain a black plastic support structure, an airtight COC foil on the outside and a microporous structured polyimide foil on the inside. Type 1 (Figure 1A) contains a fixed outer plastic ring, whereas for types 2 and 3 (Figure 1B,1C) the outer ring can be broken off mechanically at the designated respective break points for use in automated sample transfer systems (see red arrows in Figure 1B). The design of the sample holders allows the setup of multiple crystallization drops on the yellow polyimide foil. It does not compromise the monitoring of the crystallization experiment, as the material is highly transparent for visible light. The 21 μm thick polyimide foil also features 5 μm pores, which allows simple crystal manipulation by soaking later on. Since the transmission of X-rays is close to 1.0 at all commonly used diffraction data collection energies in macromolecular crystallography, the contribution of the foil to the background scattering in a diffraction experiment is negligible28.\n2. Setting up crystallization drops\nCreate a clean and dust-free surface using a damp lint-free cloth. Take one sample holder from its box and gently place it, yellow foil facing up, on the cleaned surface to avoid damage or unwanted puncture of the backside COC foil.",
    "Set up the crystallization drops with a maximum recommended volume of 2 µL on the yellow foil as it would be done on commonly used cover slides. Place the drops gently to avoid any rupture or piercing of the foil using a pipette. On a sample holder of type 1 (Figure 2A) up to three drops can be placed, whereas on sample holders of type 2 and 3 two drops are the recommended maximum (Figure 2C).\nFlip the sample holder over and place it onto a pre-greased cavity of a 24-well Linbro style plate. Use the positioning aids (see red arrows in Figure 1A) of the sample holder to guide it to its optimal position.\nEnsure the correct position of the sample holder in order to avoid unwanted evaporation (Figure 2A).\n3. Observing crystal growth\nBy placing the crystallization plate under a transmission light microscope, with or without polarizers, monitor crystal growth without any disturbance of the experiment (Figure 4).\nWhen using the smaller 18-mm sample holders of type 3 (Figure 1C), which were designed for use on SBS footprint plates, use an imaging robot capable of handling SBS-footprint plates to monitor the crystal growth in a more automated way.\n4. Crystal manipulation\nNOTE: It is recommended to perform all subsequent steps under a transmission light microscope.\nCryo-protection\nGently pierce the outer COC foil using a fine cannula. Make sure the inner yellow foil remains untouched. The puncture should be right next to the drop that is to be manipulated (Figure 3A,3C).",
    "Use a fine paper wick and insert it in the poked hole. Carefully push the wick forward until it touches the yellow polyimide foil. Keep the wick in contact with the perforated foil. The wick will suck away all excess solution. The time required for complete liquid removal depends on the viscosity of the solutions and the mother liquor composition (Figure 3B).\nAfter all liquid is sucked away, gently retract the paper wick. Remember the position of the drop, since it may not be visible after removal of the mother liquor.\nTake a standard pipette to apply a small volume of cryo-protectant solution, max. 3 µL, using an extruded tip (e.g., a gel loading tip) through the same hole. Once the liquid is dispensed, retract the tip. The porosity of the yellow foil allows for diffusion across the foil. The time to attain cryo-protection of your crystals highly depends on the employed solution and its components.\nTo reseal the self-healing COC foil, gently place a protected finger on the hole for about 1 s and slide it across the puncture. The slight pressure in combination with the elevated temperature will promote the resealing of punctures, which are not too large.\nLigand soaking\n\tNOTE: Excess mother liquor may be removed before ligand soaking. To do so, follow the steps described in 4.1.1 to 4.1.3.\n\t\nDissolve the ligand in mother liquor in the desired concentration in a reaction tube.\nSpin the solution for 10 minutes at 12,000 x g in order to remove insoluble particles. Use a temperature-controlled centrifuge if needed.\nGently place a volume of max. 3 µL of ligand containing solution in the gap between the COC foil and the polyimide film using a long, extruded pipet tip. Retract the tip.",
    "To reseal the self-healing COC foil, gently place a protected finger on the hole for about 1 s and slide it across the puncture (see also 4.1.5).\nIncubate the experiment for some time in order to allow for diffusion across the membrane. The soaking time highly depends on the viscosity of the diffusing solution and its components29.\nRepeat steps 4.2.1 to 4.2.5 multiple times to subsequently soak different ligands.\n5. In situ diffraction data collection at ambient temperature\nNOTE: In order to minimize solvent scattering, remove excess solution before data collection.\nEnsure a stable humidity controlled beamline environment with pre-established conditions30.\nGently lift the transparent COC foil at the designated point using forceps and peel it off like one would remove the lid from a yogurt cup ( Figure 6B).\nGently lift the sample holder from its cavity and insert it immediately into a pre-prepared magnetic sample holder base. No glue is necessary for this step (Figure 6B).\nApply gentle pressure to ensure the correct positioning of the sample holder within the base.\nMount the sample holder on a beamline goniometer and ensure correct positioning of the holder. Depending on goniometer geometry the sample holder can be rotated by up to 160° without causing any shadowing during the diffraction experiment.\nUse a paper wick and gently touch the yellow polyimide foil from the backside to remove excess mother liquor. Please note, that at that stage ligand soaking or cryo-protection may be performed just as well. The sample is now ready for centering and diffraction data collection.\nWhen using a sample holder with removable outer ring, apply gentle pressure by holding on to the outer ring and break it off at the designated break points (Figure 6C). The sample is now ready for centering and diffraction data collection.",
    "6. In situ diffraction data collection at cryogenic temperature\nNOTE: It is recommended to remove residual mother liquor from the sample by performing the steps 4.1.1. to 4.1.3. before continuing with the next steps to minimize solvent scattering. Most samples may be transferred to liquid nitrogen without prior cryo-protection31. If cryo-protection is needed, see steps 4.1.1. to 4.1.5.\nGently lift the COC foil at the designated point using a forceps and peel it off (see step 5.1.2) (Figure 6A).\nTake the sample holder off the cavity and mount it on a magnetic sample holder base. Gentle pressure may be applied in order to ensure correct and tight fitting (see step 5.1.5, Figure 6B).\n\tNOTE: The symmetrically arranged designated break points allow for simple removal of the outer ring of the sample holder by applying gentle pressure (see step 5.1.8., Figure 6C). Now, the sample holder is ready and can be plunged into liquid nitrogen. The geometry of the sample holder types 2 and 3 (Figure 1B,1C) allows their transfer into standard SPINE sample vials, which can be used for robot assisted sample mounting (Figure 6D)."
