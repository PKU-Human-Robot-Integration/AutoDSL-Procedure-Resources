    "The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University School of Medicine (KY20181215) on December 10, 2018.\n1. Inclusion criteria\nInclude all patients (aged >18 years) undergoing pulmonary bullae resection, pulmonary wedge resection, or lobectomy.\n2. Exclusion criteria\nExclude patients based on an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of >315.\nExclude patients with a body mass index (BMI)16 >30 kg/m2.\nExclude patients with oesophageal cancer, total pneumonectomy, and open-heart surgery with resection of the ribs.\nExclude patients with a previous medical history of bronchiectasis, destroyed lung, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nExclude patients with definite multiple pulmonary infections or inflammation prior to surgery, as well as other severe systemic diseases.\nExclude patients with coagulation disorders and severe psychiatric or neurological disorders.\n3. Preparation before the anesthesia\nFast the patient for 8 h before the surgery.\nAdjust the operating room temperature to be between 24 ° C and 26 ° C.\nInsert a 20 G top-winged infusion needle into the non-surgical dorsal vein of the hand.\nMonitor the electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate of the patient.\nApply a bispectral index (BIS) quatro sensor to the forehead of each patient.\n\tNOTE: Continuously monitor the radial arterial pressure and central venous pressure, if necessary.\n4. Ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral blockade\nPlace the patient in a lateral decubitus position.\nPlace the ultrasound probe directly above the spinous processes of the third thoracic and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and obtain a cross-sectional image of the spinous processes.\n\tNOTE: In the middle of the image is the hyperechoic spinous process with a posterior acoustic shadow, and the bony structures with a posterior acoustic shadow on either side of the spinous process are, in order, the vertebral plate and the transverse process.",
    "Move the ultrasound probe laterally to show the transverse process in its entirety.\nMove the ultrasound probe outward to visualize the transverse process, transverse rib joints, and ribs.\nMove the ultrasound probe caudally until the transverse process, the pleura, and the thoracic paravertebral space between them are detected in the image.\nLocally anesthetize the skin by injecting 2 mL of 1% lidocaine.\nInsert the block needle from lateral to medial with the in-plane approach under ultrasound guidance.\nCarefully increase the aspiration before the injection. Ensure that no blood reflux is observed.\n\t​NOTE: The purpose of this step is to prevent systemic toxicity from the local anesthetic.\nInject 2 mL of saline, and then visualize the anterior displacement of the pleura and the widening of the thoracic paravertebral space with the ultrasound.\nInject 15 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine at the levels of T3 and T7.\n5. Anesthetic induction\nSpray 1% levobupivacaine (3 mL) onto the throat.\nInject 1.5 µg/kg of fentanyl and 1-1.5 mg/kg of propofol.\nFor continuous oxygen administration, place a facial mask, or insert a laryngeal mask airway (double-tube mask; #3 for 30-50 kg, #4 for 50-70 kg, #5 for 70-100 kg). Oxygen enters the patient's airway via the facial mask or laryngeal mask.\n\t​NOTE: Adjust the injection dose to achieve a BIS value between 40-6016.\n6. Maintenance of anesthesia\nMaintain an oxygen flow rate of 0.5-1 L/min.\nMaintain the concentration of sevoflurane at 1.5%-2.0% after the artificial pneumothorax.\n\tNOTE: Inject 0.5 µg/kg of fentanyl if the intraoperative spontaneous respiratory rate is higher than 20 breaths/min or when there is mediastinal flutter or coughing. Sevoflurane enters the patient's airway via the facial mask or laryngeal mask.\nMonitor the inhaled oxygen concentration and the end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2 < 60 mmHg).",
    "Monitor the body temperature. Monitor the level of consciousness, and maintain a BIS value of 40-6016,17.\nInject 20µg/kg of atropine if the patient develops sinus bradycardia (HR ≤ 50 beats/min).\nContinuously perfuse 2 µg/kg/h of norepinephrine using an infusion pump if the systolic blood pressure is lower than 30% or 90 mmHg.\nPerform arterial blood gas analysis 15 min before the end of the surgery.\nInject 1 mg/kg of flurbiprofen 30 min before the end of the surgery.\n7. Thoracoscopic vagal block techniques and pleural infiltration anesthesia\nUse a 24 G top-winged infusion needle to produce an infiltration of 0.375% ropivacaine (3 mL) near the vagus nerve at the level of the lower trachea when performing right-sided procedures.\nUse a 24 G top-winged infusion needle to produce an infiltration of 0.5% ropivacaine (3 mL) near the vagus nerve at the level of the aortopulmonary window when performing left-sided procedures.\nSpray 10 mL of 2% lidocaine onto the surface of the visceral pleura using a 10 mL syringe.\n8. Conversion from non-intubated anesthesia to intubated general anesthesia\nConvert the non-intubated anesthesia to intubated general anesthesia if the patient meets one of the following conditions:\n\t-Severe hypoxemia (pulse oximetry < 80%)\n\t-Severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 80 mmHg)\n\t-Hemodynamic instability: intractable arrhythmias and right ventricular failure\n\t-Persistent coughing resulting in surgery becoming difficult or impossible\n\t-Intraoperative bleeding requiring thoracotomy\n9. Post-operative care\nAfter fully waking, ask the patient to take a deep breath and cough to re-expand the collapsed lung.\nConnect a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) pump to the intravenous catheter with a 100 mL solution in a PCA reservoir bag (containing 1 µg/kg of sufentanil and a 0.9% sodium chloride injection), and titrate 2 mL/h of the PCA solution.",
    "Remove the chest drain when there is no air leak on coughing, no obvious fluid pneumothorax on the review of the chest X-ray, and a 24 h drainage of <300 mL.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
