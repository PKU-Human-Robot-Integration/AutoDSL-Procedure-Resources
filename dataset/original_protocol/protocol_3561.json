    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExperimental timing\nOn day 1, collect tissue from surgery. This must be done within 60 min of tumor removal. Please refer to step 1 of tissue collection and processing for the details on the processing during day 1 and reagents used.\nPatient-derived 3D culture initiation: 2–14 days\nNote: Patient-derived sphere (gliospheres) formation can be achieved in 7 days.\nNote: Patient-derived organoid (PDO) formation can be achieved in as early as 14 days. However, depending on the collected tumor size, seeding density, culture conditions, and the desired use, PDO culture could take up to three months.\nPatient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs) after 3D culture: 2–12 weeks\nGliosphere and PDO expression profiling by qPCR or RNA seq: 8 h to 7 days\nWhole-mount IF and IHC on gliosphere and PDO cultures: 2–4 days\nDrug treatment and synergy assays: 5 days\nNote: Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an overview and images depicting the morphology and size of the GBM organoids and gliospheres generated using this protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/483-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generation of gliospheres and PDOs from patient tissue\nMorphological and histological analysis of GBM PDSs, PDOs, and PDOXs.\n(A) Schematic outline for histological analysis of GBM patient-derived spheres (PDSs) also called gliospheres, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and mouse brain patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs).\n(B) Representative GBM gliospheres in bright-field images taken using inverted microscopy on day 7 (top left panel).

    "(D) Representative GBM PDOX mouse brains in H&E and IHC staining for cell proliferation marker Ki67 and neuroepithelial progenitor marker Nestin. Scale bars are 100 μm in bright-field, H&E, and IHC images in (B)–(D) and 20 μm in IF images in (B) and (C).\nTissue collection and processing\nTiming: days 1–3\nSurgical specimen should be collected from the operation room within 60 min of tumor removal from GBM patients previously diagnosed using MRI and/or histology and undergoing craniotomy resection. The neuropathologist will place the GBM specimen in serum-free GBM collection medium after diagnostic confirmation of GBM using H&E staining. Pathology assistant will record the deidentified sample number and have it delivered to the tissue culture facility.\nTissue samples are divided into three fractions: first for cryofreezing, DNA and RNA extraction (for glioseq exome sequencing; Nikiforova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), second for expression profiling to determine GBM subtypes and targets for drug testing, and third for live tissue for initiating 3D cultures to make gliospheres and PDOs.\nUnder the tissue culture hood, place the tissue in a Petri dish and use a sterile scalpel to cut patient GBM tissue into small cubic fragments (~1 mm3 each).\nIncubate tissue fragments with Accutase at 10 mL per 75 cm2 surface area for 2–4 min at 37°C only when tissue fragments are ≥1 mm3 in size. This will dissociate tumor cells from the surrounding extracellular matrix. If fragments are smaller in size, use only 1–2 mL of Accutase in a 15 mL Falcon tube and incubate for 2 min at 37°C.\nCollect fragments from the incubator and pass multiple times through a 26-gauge needle to obtain a suspension of single cells. Serial passing through the needle helps break down tissue fragments and generate tumor cell suspension.",
    "Filter the cell suspension through a 40 μm filter placed on top of a 50 mL Falcon tube. Wash the filter with 5 mL of serum-free GBM media into the 50 mL tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–21°C).\nResuspend in 500 μL to 1 mL of serum-free GBM media.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer.\nPlate the cells (based on surface area) in multi-well ultra-low attachment plates.\nNote: If using a 96-well ultra-low attachment plates, seed approximately 1,000 cells per well. Alternatively, if using 6 well suspension plates, seed approximately 10,000–25,000 cells per well.\nMonitor the cells during the first 2–3 days.\nCheck for cell clumping and formation of sphere-like structures at days 5–7 for gliospheres.\nFor PDOs, monitor the Matrigel droplets for 14 days.\nAt days 7–14, respectively, cells are ready for processing and downstream applications, or for cryofreezing for future use.\nAt day 7 or 14, accordingly, start to propagate gliospheres or PDOs for 2–12 weeks to generate GBM cells for histological processing (see representative data in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C), cryofreezing, labeling with luciferase reporters, and for engraftment into mouse brains to generate PDOXs or perform drug testing and synergy assays.\nCulture establishment, storage, and propagation\nTiming: 5–15 min\nAdd growth factors to GSBM (see table in Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for reference on how to make GSBM).\nB27 (50× stock concentration), 20 μL/mL final concentration.\nEGF (10 μg/mL stock concentration), 20 ng/mL final concentration.\nbFGF (10 μg/mL stock concentration), 20 ng/mL final concentration.\nNote: The amount of media needed is dependent upon the number of wells containing GBM cultures. For a 96-well plate, each well receives 100 μL of media. Calculate the media needed and add desired factors based on the media volume being used.",
    "Prepare GBM Organoid Basal Media (GOBM)\nGSBM supplemented with:\nHydrocortisone (200× stock concentration), 1× (50 ng/mL) final concentration.\nB27 (50× stock concentration), 20 μL/mL final concentration.\nEGF (10 μg/mL stock concentration), 20 ng/mL final concentration.\nbFGF (10 μg/mL stock concentration), 20 ng/mL final concentration.\nNote: The amount of media needed is dependent upon the number of wells containing organoids. For a 96 well plate, each well receives 100–200 μL of media (usually 100 μL is enough to cover the gel matrix). Calculate the amount of media needed and add desired factors based on the total media volume being used.\nThawing and plating of cells\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIf working from previously cryo-frozen samples, thaw the vials by gentle shaking in a 37°C water bath until the cell pellets are approximately 2/3 thawed.\nAdd thawed cell pellets to a 15 mL canonical tube and overlay cells with 9 mL of GSBM.\nSpin the sample down at room temperature (20°C–21°C) for 5 min at 300 × g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of GSBM.\nUsing a 200 μL pipette, mechanically dissociate the pellet into a single cell suspension by pipetting up and down gently multiple times.\nCritical: Make sure to be careful and gentle when pipetting to prevent damage to the cells.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nPlate 1,000–5,000 cells per well in 96-well untreated/suspension plates and add 100–200 μL of fresh GSBM to each well.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange half of the media every 2 days by tilting the plate to a 45°angle.\nCritical: It is easy to aspirate the spheres/organoids when removing fluids (i.e., media, PBS, fixative) from the wells, therefore, it is critical to monitor the cells during the aspiration.",
    "Note: Tilting the plate and slowly aspirating from the surface of the media/plate interface will help minimize the number of spheres/organoids that are lost throughout the media changes and passaging processes. Alternatively, working under a dissecting microscope will help track the organoids/spheres throughout the process. Though, this might be laborious and time consuming.\nNote: If working from freshly dissociated cells, proceed to steps 6a–6f.\nWhen plating PDOs additional care and steps are required:\nRefer to steps 5a–5e for details on how to thaw, prepare a single cell suspension, and count before proceeding to 6b.\nCritical: It is important to place the desired number of plates in the incubator 1–2 h prior to starting the following steps. Additionally, it is paramount to work and keep tubes on ice from this step forward.\nPlace thawed Matrigel in ice.\nBased on cell counts using a hemocytometer, dilute cells to 100 cell/μL.\nCritical: Overall composition of the gel/cells and media solution should not exceed 20% cells with media and 80% Matrigel. Additionally, avoid creating bubbles to the mixture of gel/cells and media when pipetting up and down.\nPrewarm a 96-well plate by placing it in the cell culture incubator.\nRetrieve the 96-well plates from the incubator and add a 10 μL cell/Matrigel droplet to the middle of the well to generate the basement membrane 3D culture chamber.\nPipette slowly to generate a doom-shaped droplet chamber.\nNote: It is important not to touch the bottom of the plate with the pipette tip. This would help with maintaining the integrity of the gel matrix longer.\nMove the plate back to the incubator and allow the Matrigel to harden.",
    "Note: The overall time for hardening of the gel varies based on the size of the Matrigel droplet. For a 10 μL droplet, it should take no more than 10 min for the gel to harden.\nCritical: For a 96-well plate, do not leave the gel in the incubator for longer than 10 min since this could affect the cells embedded in the gel.\nOnce the Matrigel has solidified, overlay the droplet with enough GOBM to cover it. This is usually achieved by adding 100–200 μL per well.\nFollow steps 5g and 5h.\nMonitor organoid growth every other day and record images (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for a typical GBM PDO growth during the first week of culture. Note the cell mobility and interaction with the ECM, which requires readjustment of focus for proper imaging) . PDOs are usually ready for analysis and use starting at 14 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Cellular motility of GBM PDO cells in organoid culture, related to step 6j in Step-by-step method details and Figure 1\nTime lapse recording of a typical GBM PDO growth during the first five days of the 3D culture after plating. Note the clusters of GBM dividing cells and the cellular motility of GBM cells, with neurite extensions, and the repeated interactions between various cells and the ECM, which forms the surrounding Matrigel droplet edge. These continuous cellular motilities might require readjustment of focus for proper time lapse imaging. This time lapse movie was taken during days 1–5 of 3D GBM organoid culture and was set to 200× playback.\nPassaging of gliospheres and PDO cells\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPassaging cells from gliospheres: gliospheres are ready for passaging after 7 days. Pool gliospheres in 15 mL canonical tubes.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at room temperature (20°C–21°C) for 5 min at 300 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL GSBM.\nMechanically dissociate spheres using a 200 μL pipette.\nCritical: Make sure to be careful and gentle when pipetting to prevent damage to the sphere producing cells.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nPlate 1,000–5,000 cells on 96-well untreated/suspension plates.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange half of the media every 2 days.\nPassaging of PDO cells: PDOs are ready for passaging after 10–14 days. When passaging organoid cells, additional steps are required:\nRemove all the media from the wells.\nDissolve the Matrigel droplet chamber by adding 200 μL of ice-cold GOBM.\nScrape the bottom of the well by gently using a cell scraper/or a pipette tip (depending on culture dish used) and collect the organoid/Matrigel sample in a 15 mL canonical tube.\nCentrifuge the collected tube at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash the pellet three times with ice-cold PBS.\nCritical: You must centrifuge at room temperature (20°C–21°C) at 300 × g for 5 min between each wash in order to prevent losing any of the organoids collected from the wells.\nCentrifuge one more time at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–21°C), remove supernatant and overlay the remaining organoid pellet/Matrigel mixture with 1 mL of cell recovery solution (CRS).\nAllow the 15 mL tube to sit on ice for 30 min. Make sure that the Matrigel remnants are no longer visible.\nCentrifuge one more time at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash once with PBS.\nRemove PBS by centrifugation (as described above).\nAdd 2 mL of GOBM.",
    "Dissociate the organoid pellet by mechanical dissociation using a broken Pasteur pipette or with a laser pulled needle.\nNote: Avoid dissociating organoids into single cells, rather leave them as small fragments if possible, in order to maintain relatively similar proliferative rate without single cell outgrowth.\nCount the organoids under a light microscope and split/pass at a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4 depending on organoid density.\nNote: It is important to determine if proliferation rate in 3D cultured PDOs reflects a relatively similar proliferation rate of the original GBM tumor (e.g., relatively similar number of Ki67+ cells) and additionally upon the formation of PDOXs (see below). The cell doubling time should be established under light and/or fluorescent microscopy (when cells are labeled with fluorescence or luciferase reporters).\nFollow steps 5g and 5h for culture conditions, and media changes.\nCritical: Since Ki67 levels are usually determined during GBM diagnosis, immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 and/or PCNA can be used to confirm the same proliferative rates of GBM cells in PDOs and PDOXs compared to original tumor. This is highly critical when using PDOs and PDOXs for drug sensitivity testing.\nCryofreezing of cells\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFreezing cells: gliospheres. Pool gliospheres in a 15 mL canonical tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 244 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of GSBM.\nCritical: Additional care should be taken when aspirating the supernatant. Using a long 200 μL pipette might help prevent aspirating some of the spheres.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of freezing media\nNote: Freezing media is made by mixing GSBM with 10% DMSO\nAliquot cells in 1.5 mL cryotubes, and store in a Mr. Frosty or similar freezing container at −80°C for up to 24–48 h.\nMove the frozen vials into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.",
    "Freezing cells: PDOs. When freezing organoids, additional steps are required:\nFollow steps 8a–8j.\nAdd 2–4.5 mL of GOBM substituted with 10% DMSO to the tube containing the organoid pellet.\nNote: GOBM substituted with 10% DMSO is used for cryopreservation of PDOs\nAdd the desired volume containing the desired number of organoids to a 1.0–1.5 mL cryogenic tube.\nFollow steps 9d–9e.\nInitiation of mouse brain Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX)\nTiming For Implantation Surgery: 4 h\nBefore you begin, prepare mouse anesthesia as described in Materials and equipment.\nCritical: Ketamine and xylazine are used in animal anesthesia as controlled substances. Institutional monitoring of drug usage and secure holding of these substances are required, please consult with your institutional safety officer.\nAlternatives: Alternatively, you can replace PBS with 0.9% Sodium Chloride.\nBefore planning the surgical implantation of gliospheres or PDO cells in the mouse brain, GBM cells may optionally be labeled with luciferase reporters and/or fluorescent reporters (e.g., using lentiviral vectors) (see Chadwick et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] for details) to be able to monitor glioma formation in live mouse brains after formation of PDOXs.\nOn the day of the mouse surgery, prepare a cell suspension from labeled gliosphere or PDO cultures and prepare the appropriate media (see Materials and equipment and Culture establishment, storage, and propagation, steps 3 and 4). Suspend the desired number of cells to be implanted in 3–5 μL of media. Use GSBM for spheres or GOBM for organoids .\nCritical: It is important to keep the cell suspension on ice to prevent cell death.",
    "Note: Detection of mouse glioma depends on the proliferative rate of originating GBM. We have detected gliomas in PDXs using luciferase and/or MRI imaging from as little as 2,000 implanted cells in as early as 2–3 weeks. Mouse brain tumors could be confirmed in all animals at 12 weeks following implantation.\nAnesthetize 6- to 12-week-old NSG mice with 100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine solution via intraperitoneal injection with a sterile 27-gauge insulin needle.\nCritical: Administer 100 μL anesthetic solution per 10 g mouse weight. Ensure that anesthesia is complete by performing toe or tail pinch before surgical proceeding and continue to monitor every 5–15 min throughout the procedure.\nNote: If the animal is still responsive to toe or tail pinch, an additional IP injection of no more than 25% the initial anesthetic dose can be administered. Ensure full anesthesia is achieved before making the scalp incision.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to eyes to prevent drying throughout the procedure.\nProceed to remove hair on scalp with the hair removal cream.\nImmobilize the anesthetized mouse on the stereotactic device (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) by hooking incisors on the indentation on the tooth bar, securing the snout clamp, and then tightening the screws holding on either side of the head (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/483-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: Make sure that the head is held stably and is on an even plane.\nCritical: Place the heating pad underneath the mouse and insert the lubricated rectal thermometer. Both the heating pad and the thermometer are attached to the homeothermic monitoring system for continuous monitoring and maintenance of the 37°C body temperature throughout the procedure and during recovery (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nSwab the scalp with 3 alternating cycles of betadine and 70% ethanol, making sure that the area is free of loose hair and any remaining hair removal cream.\nUsing a scalpel, make a 0.5–0.75 cm longitudinal scalp incision midway in the scalp from between the eyes to between the ears.\nSwab the skull with hydrogen peroxide to identify the bregma.\nNote: The bregma is the point on the surface of the skull where the sagittal and coronal sutures meet. It can be distinctly identified because when exposed to hydrogen peroxide it should adopt a pale coloration that stands out from its surroundings.\nNote: Small bubbles should form on the T-shape of the bregma when hydrogen peroxide is applied. Adjust incision to make sure the bregma is in view before proceeding.\nAttach the drill to the stereotactic apparatus and center the drill tip above the bregma.\nCritical: Avoid touching the skull during this step. Doing so will prevent calibration of the device.\nSet up the stereotactic coordinates on the Stoelting instrument display to X = 0, Y = 0, and Z = 0 at this point.\nSet the drill 2.5 mm to the right, and 1.5 mm anterior to directions +2.5, +1.5, 0.\nLower the drill to contact the skull, making sure to maintain 2.5 mm and 1.5 mm in the x and y directions, and gently drill through the skull.",
    "Note: Stop as soon as you cut through the bone, it will be very quick!\nCritical: Pull back the skin, as it can get caught in the drill. Be careful not to penetrate too deep in order to prevent unwanted damage to the brain.\nResuspend cells in media by gently pipetting up and down before filling the Hamilton syringe with the appropriate volume of cells and media for injection.\nNote: The maximum volume for infusion is 5 μL.\nCritical: Ensure that there are no bubbles in the injection syringe, as air bubbles can cause air embolisms.\nReplace the drill with the Nanomite syringe pump on the stereotactic frame. Clean off the needle of the Hamilton syringe with an alcohol pad before attaching it to the infusion pump.\nMove the needle to the burr site and move the needle downward so it is just touching the brain. Reset the coordinates of the stereotactic instrument ensuring that the z coordinate is at 0 mm.\nLower the needle slowly in the z direction to −3.5 mm.\nCritical: Avoid going past this point as this can cause some cells to go into the ventricular system, which will lead to cells migrating into the central nervous system and causing unwanted neoplasms.\nAllow the automated injector pump to inject the cells at a rate of 0.5 μL/min.\nLeave the needle in brain for an additional 2 min after infusion is complete before slowly withdrawing it.\nCover the hole in the skull completely with bone wax and close the scalp incision with Vetbond adhesive.\nRemove the rectal probe from the mouse and remove the mouse from the stereotactic device. Place the mouse in a heated recovery cage. When the mouse regains consciousness and coordination, it can be returned to its original cage.",
    "Tumor growth can be monitored with MRI, or with bioluminescent imaging using the IVIS system if luciferase expressing cells are used (see Patrizii et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nMonitor mice for neurological symptoms or general signs of distress at which point mice should be euthanized and brains can be collected for histology (see the multiple steps for generating these mouse PDOXs in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and the representative histology outcome of PDOX tumors in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/483-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Generation of PDOXs\nSteps and key requirement for establishing mouse PDOXs from PDO 3D cultures. The steps include dissociation of PDOs, labeling with lentiviral fluorescent reporters, engrafting glioma in mouse brains, detecting PDOXs using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and MRI imaging, and molecular assays. Ctl, control mice are compared to PDOX mice.\nRNA extraction, RNA sequencing, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)\nTiming: 8 h to 2 days\nGliospheres and PDOs could be pelleted as described above.\nRNA extraction from gliospheres, PDOs, PDOX brain, and their corresponding originating GBM is accomplished by following the RNeasy kit instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#productdetails[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-mini-kit/#productdetails]). Alternatively, if the RNeasy kit is not available, RNA extractions can be accomplished by following the Trizol RNA extraction method (http://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf[href=http://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf]).\nThe resulting amount of RNA can be measured using the nanodrop/Nanovue system and RNA could be used for expression profiling using RNA sequencing and qPCR. The expression profiles can then be matched to the original GBM tissue preserved to ensure parity between the generated 3D cultures and the originating GBM.\nApproximately 1 μg of RNA is used for cDNA Synthesis (explained below):\ncDNA synthesis is accomplished by following Thermo Fisher Superscript IV VILO Master Mix protocol (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/superscriptIV_VILO_master_mix_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/superscriptIV_VILO_master_mix_UG.pdf]).",
    "Resulting cDNA is used along with the desired primers for qPCR (for a list of target genes that are used to identify the expression signature of GBM subtypes, please refer to the list in Chadwick et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]):\nNewly synthesized cDNA is diluted using ultra-pure PCR grade water.\nA SYBR green mix including forward (F), reverse (R) primers and ultra-pure PCR grade water mixture is made fresh and following the manufacturer’s specifications.\nUse triplicate wells for each target, and cDNA is added independently with a fresh pipette tip (10 μL pipette) to prevent cross-contamination of the samples.\nThe following set up (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) is used on StepOne qPCR instrument using SYBR Green master mix following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0013511_PowerUp_mastermix_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUG93ZXJVcCBTWUJSIEdyZWVuIE1hc3RlciBNaXggLSBVbml2ZXJzYWwgMlggbWFzdGVyIG1peCBmb3IgcmVhbC10aW1lIFBDUiB3b3JrZmxvd3M=[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0013511_PowerUp_mastermix_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUG93ZXJVcCBTWUJSIEdyZWVuIE1hc3RlciBNaXggLSBVbml2ZXJzYWwgMlggbWFzdGVyIG1peCBmb3IgcmVhbC10aW1lIFBDUiB3b3JrZmxvd3M=]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_483_4.csv\nStage 1 = 1×, Stage 2 = 1×, Stage 3 = 40×\nImmunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nTiming: 2–4 days\nSee Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for representative histology and IF staining of gliospheres and PDOs.\nFixation, permeabilization, and staining of gliospheres and PDOs for IF and IHC\nSpheres and organoids are collected and the media or Matrigel plus media are removed respectively.\nNote: See steps 8a–8j for instructions on how to remove the Matrigel.\nCritical: When aspirating/removing the media, it is better to use a glass Pasteur pipette, or a 200 μL (preferred) pipette to prevent aspiration of the spheres or organoids.\nThe spheres and organoids can be fixed in the wells at 37°C for 10–15 min using fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nNote: The volume of PFA used is dependent upon the plate size. For a 96-well plate, 200 μL of 4% PFA is used.\nWash the samples 3 times using 1× DPBS to remove the fixative.",
    "Permeabilize the samples overnight (8–12 h) at 4°C by using 0.5% Triton X-100. A blocking step may be included for antibodies that generate high staining background.\nWash samples 3 times using DPBS to remove as much of the Triton X-100 as possible.\nIncubate cells at room temperature (20°C–21°C) for 18–24 h with desired primary antibodies diluted per the manufacturer’s specifications. Primary antibodies against neuroepithelial progenitor markers such as NESTIN, and neuroepithelial differentiation markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (for CNS mature astrocytes and ependymal cells), galactosidase C (GALC) (for early-stage oligodendroglia), and tubulin-beta-III (TUJ1) (for neuron-specific early commitment) should be used.\nFor drug testing in GBM PDOs (see below), IF and/or IHC are done with primary antibodies against GBM hallmark GFAP, glioma stem cell (GSC) proteins such as the orphan nuclear receptor tailless (TLX), the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and self-renewal protein SOX2, and the self-renewal marker BMI1, and against pathway specific markers such as PI3K/mTOR marker pS6 to detect drug on-target activities and validate combination therapies (See (Mehta et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and (Chadwick et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) for details).\nNote: Although this method has been successful for us, we understand that not all cultures are the same. Alternatively, optimization of the antibody staining might be necessary. In some cases, when using the appropriate controls for detecting background staining, if the desired staining cannot be detected using the times specified above, a prolonged primary antibody incubation can be performed by incubating cells for 1–2 days at 4°C or 1 day at room temperature (20°C–21°C).\nAfter incubating for 18–24 h, wash 3 times using DPBS. Each wash should be approximately 5 min.",
    "Treat the samples by adding desired secondary antibodies selected against the species of the primary antibody used. Make sure to dilute the latter in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and per the antibody manufacturer’s specifications.\nIncubate the cells at 4°C for 18–24 h and 1–2 h at room temperature (20°C–21°C) before washing 3 times with DPBS\nNote: Each wash should be performed for approximately 5 min, preferably with mild rocking. Antibody incubation times and temperatures can be adjusted based on the organoid/gliosphere density and the antibody optimization protocols.

Prepare 10× conc. of each drug according to the GI50, add 10 μL of each 10× drug (as shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) to 90 μL of organoid media per well for a total complete media including the tested drugs of 100 μL per well. Each dose should be tested in triplicates.\nAlternatives: This matrix can be used for any number of doses for each compound based on GI50. At least four serial doses should be examined to determine Bliss synergy scores.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_483_6.csv\nThe working concentrations of Pozi or Nira are listed based on the utilization of 10 μL from a 10× stock concentration to achieve the final 1× concentration in a total of 100 μL per well.\nCritical: Add 10 μL of each drug at 10× concentration (as shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] ) to 90 μL of organoid media per well for a total complete media including the drug of 100 μL.",
    "Alternatives: This matrix can be completed for multiple combinations of compounds. At least four serial doses of two drugs should be examined to determine Bliss synergy scores. The most promising combinations should be validated in vivo in PDOXs. For larger scale drug screening, optional 384-well ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates can be used with total media and drug of 40 μL per well. See also Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for dose distribution of drugs tested and assessed for synergy in GBM PDOs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/483-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Drug synergy assays in PDOs\nSteps 1–4 show the utilization of PDOs to determine the antitumor activity of drugs A and B. Drugs are added to the media from a 10× stock to reach 1× final concentration. Treatment is continued for 3 days, based on initial determination of GI50 concentration In some cases, treatment may be continued for 7 days to see the full inhibitory effects. Effects on PDO cell viability is determined by assessing intracellular ATP levels using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are input into SynergyFinder software to determine synergy between drugs A and B.\nOn the first day, plate 4,000–5,000 GBM cells per well in a 96-well plate and culture in 90 μL of media.\nNote: You can culture the cells as gliospheres or organoids as PDOs. For advantages of using PDOs vs gliospheres, please refer to Chadwick et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. See steps 5b–5h for spheres and 6b–6g for PDOs.\nOn day 2, prepare a stock of 10× drug, and dilute to 1× by adding 10 μL of 10× drug to each well containing 90 μL of media.\nNote: A media change is not necessary to add the 10 μL of the drug of choice.",
    "Treat the cells with drug combinations at the desired concentrations (see Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) and as suggested on the SynergyFinder site for 72 h and up to 1 week.\nNote: Access to the synergy site can be acquired by following this link: https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi/synergy/20201021224844908442/[href=https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi/synergy/20201021224844908442/]\nAt 72 h, add 40 μL of Promega’s Cell Titer-Glo mix to each well of the culture plate to determine cell viability by measuring intracellular ATP levels.\nMove the plate to a shaker and keep at room temperature (20°C–21°C) for 30 min.\nTransfer 60 μL from each well to an opaque plate to perform the cell viability assays based on the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/0/celltiter-glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay-protocol.pdf?la=en[href=https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/0/celltiter-glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay-protocol.pdf?la=en]) using a plate reader.\nCell viability readouts are determined by comparing treated wells to untreated, DMSO, and positive control wells. Growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) and area under the curve (AUC) values can be determined with quantitative analysis using GraphPad prism software.\nNote: Generate a standard curve using 8 wells containing serial dilution of a compound that kills all cells as a positive control. Median concentration can be used to establish reproducibility among PDO wells by performing a series of dilutions starting from the highly concentrated samples (e.g., high cell numbers) to highly diluted samples. Use these standard curves to measure the AUC to determine the effect of the drug on the cell viability of GBM PDOs.\nInput the data into the SynergyFinder site to generate the respective plots.\nNote: While beyond the scope of this protocol, drug sensitivity assays can be confirmed in mouse PDOXs to assess the effects of promising drugs in vivo and in particular upon crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is highly desired for clinical translation for GBM patient therapy.",
    "Note: PDOs (and PDOXs) are established using deidentified tissues and by investigators who are blinded to patient data and patient responses to therapy. Upon completion of the preclinical drug assays described in this protocol, correlation to clinical responses can be established by clinical investigators who have access to clinical data following IRB guidelines."
