    "All methods described here were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Research Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). The IACUC at UNL has approved two protocols related to generating and using hu-BLT mice, including double hu-mice. Additionally, the Scientific Research Oversight Committee (SROC) at UNL has also approved the use of human embryonic stem cells and fetal tissues, which are procured from the Advanced Bioscience Resources for humanized mice studies (SROC# 2016-1-002).\n1. Mice housing and maintenance\nPurchase 6-8-week old NSG mice (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ).\nHouse the mice under SPF conditions with air exchange, prefilters, and HEPA filters (0.22 μm) in a room with controlled temperature, humidity, and pressure.\n\t\nHouse and maintain the mice in autoclaved individual microisolator cages in a rack system capable of managing air exchange with prefilters and HEPA filters (0.22 μm).\nPerform all procedures and manipulations of the mice in a Class II Type A2 biological safety fume hood that has been pre-treated with 70% ethanol. Before working in the animal room, shower and change into clean scrubs, tyvek suit, boot covers, hair cap, face mask, and gloves. Wear a surgery gown over the tyvek suit during surgical procedures.\n\tNOTE: Ultraviolet (UV) light decontamination is also preferred prior to procedures.\n\t\nAutoclave all instruments and reagents if possible and then disinfect prior to transferring to the fume hood.\nDuring procedures, remove the animals' individually-ventilated cages from the rack and disinfect prior to transferring to the fume hood.\nFeed the mice an irradiated diet and provide autoclaved water. Provide irradiated food ab libitum and supplement with additional irradiated food as needed. Change autoclaved water weekly or as needed.\n\tNOTE: Autoclaved acidified water can also be used. The irradiated diet provided had a shelf-life of 6 months after manufacture.\n2. Generation of humanized BLT mice",
    "NOTE: Generation of hu-BLT mice has been described previously22,23,24.\nOn the day of surgery, give the mice whole-body irradiation at a dose of 12 cGy/g of body weight.\nPrepare the mice for surgery.\n\t\nGive each irradiated mouse a mixture of Ketamine at the working concentration of 100 mg/kg and Xylazine at the concentration of 12 mg/kg, which ranged from 130-170 μL per mouse based on body weight by intraperitoneal (IP) injection for anesthesia. To prepare 3 ml of the Ketamine and Xylazine mixture, add 0.27 mL of Ketamine at the stock concentration of 100 mg/mL and 0.03 mL of Xylazine at the concentration of 100 mg/mL to 2.7 mL of sterile saline and mix well. Disinfect the skin with 70% isopropanol prior to injection.\nGive each irradiated mouse Buprenorphine 1 mg/kg of body weight (half-live 72 h, SR-LAB) by subcutaneous injection for long lasting pain management.\nGive each irradiated mouse 100 μL (858 μg) of Cefazolin by IP injection for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.\nShave the hair of the mice using electric hair clippers around the left lateral and medial side of the mouse at the later surgical site used to expose the left kidney.\nVerify proper level of anesthesia by pedal reflex (firm toe pinch).\nGive isoflurane gas at 3-5% if additional anesthesia is needed at any point during surgery.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent corneal desiccation. Apply ear tag if needed.\nPerform surgery to implant the liver and thymus tissues into the left kidney capsule.\n\t\nDisinfect the skin at the surgical site by applying iodine scrub starting from the center of the surgical site and moving towards the outside in a circular manner. Repeat this process with 70% isopropanol and a third time with iodine.",
    "Using forceps, first load one human fetal liver tissue fragment into a trocar. Then using forceps, load one human fetal thymus tissue fragment into the trocar. Then using forceps, load another human fetal liver tissue fragment into the trocar. Tissues should be cut to 1-1.6 mm3 to fit the inner dimensions of the trocar.\nUse forceps to lift the skin and use scissors to make a small cut longitudinally. Extend the cut to 1.5-2 cm in the left side of the mouse.\nUse forceps to lift the muscle layer and use scissors to make a small cut longitudinally. Extend the cut as needed to expose the kidney.\nExpose the kidney by gently grasping the fatty tissue surrounding the kidney. Do not directly touch the kidney parenchyma.\nMake a 1-2 mm incision at the posterior end of the kidney capsule using a scalpel.\nSlowly insert the preloaded trocar through the incision parallel to the long axis of the kidney and release the tissues between the kidney capsule and kidney.\nCarefully return the kidney and bowel to their normal position. Use absorbable 5/0 P-3 (P-13) sutures with 13mm 3/8 circle needle to close the muscle layer and surgical staples to close the skin.\nAfter surgery, put the mouse into a clean autoclaved microisolator cage for recovery.\n\t\nTo minimize heat loss during post-surgical recovery, put the cage containing the mice on a heating pad that is connected to a water pump that warms and circulates the water.\nMonitor the mice until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nWithin 6 h of surgery completion, via the tail-vein, inject CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated from human fetal liver tissue.",
    "Warm up the mice with a heat-lamp. Disinfect the tail with 70% isopropanol and then inject 1.5 to 5 × 105 stem cells/200 μL into the tail vein.\nStop any bleeding from the injection and return mice to the microisolator cage and the microisolator cage to the cage rack.\n\t\tNOTE: Post-surgery mice are typically housed together, five per microisolator cage, during and after recovery. However, mice are only housed together if they all received surgery on the same day.\nCheck the mice daily. Carefully monitor the surgical staples and replace them as needed. Closely monitor the mice for any sign of infection or discomfort. Supply autoclaved food on the floor of the microisolator cage for a few days post surgery.\nRemove the surgical staples 7-10 days after surgery. Give isoflurane gas at 3-5% to anesthetize the mice. Carefully remove the staples and then apply antibiotic and pain-relieving ointment onto the site.\nAllow 9-12 weeks for reconstitution of human immune cells, then collect peripheral blood from the medial saphenous vein from each of the humanized mice.\n\t\nRestrain conscious mice using an appropriately sized plastic cone restraint with an opening near the head of the mouse for breathing and an opening near the back of the mouse to isolate one leg. Put the mice into the restraint cone head first and then gently pull one leg through the leg opening.\nSpray the medial side of the isolated leg with 70% isopropanol, then spread antibiotic and pain-relieving ointment onto the same site.\n\t\tNOTE: The ointment helps to reveal the location of the vein without the need for hair removal and also assists in blood droplet formation.",
    "Using a 25-gauge needle at a 90° angle, puncture the vein and collect 50-100 μL of blood using an EDTA coated blood collection tube. Stop the bleeding by applying pressure to the site with sterile gauze. Once the bleeding has stopped, return the mice to their cage.\n\t\tNOTE: The maximum blood volumes collected are typically 50 μL per week or 100 μL every two weeks.\nUse the collected peripheral blood to test the level of human immune cell reconstitution using flow cytometry with antibodies for hCD45, mCD45, hCD3, hCD4, hCD8, hCD19.\n3. Antibiotic treatment\nPrior to antibiotic treatment, collect pre-treatment fecal samples. Move the mice to a new autoclaved microisolator cage.\nPrepare a fresh cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics daily.\n\t\nPrepare 250 mL of water containing freshly prepared Metronidazole (1 g/L), Neomycin (1 g/L), Vancomycin (0.5 g/L), and Ampicillin (1 g/L) for each microisolator cage of mice.\n\t\tNOTE: Use autoclaved or sterile water for the antibiotic supplemented drinking water.\nAdd 9.2 g of grape sugar sweetened drink mix to 250 mL of antibiotic supplemented water.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of grape sugar sweetened drink mix masks the bitter taste of the antibiotics and helps prevent dehydration in the mice.\nChange the antibiotic and grape sugar sweetened drink mix supplemented water and place the mice in a new autoclaved cage daily.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice are coprophagic and changing the cages daily prevents the mice from re-inoculating themselves with gut bacteria.\nFor maximal engraftment of the human-like gut microbiome, provide antibiotics for 14 days. During antibiotic treatment, monitor the mice for weight loss and dehydration. Weight loss is expected during the first 3-4 days and plateaus after that for the duration of the treatment. If dehydration occurs, give the mice saline or Ringers Solution via intraperitoneal injection.",
    "NOTE: Other gut microbiome humanization protocols call for oral gavage of antibiotics. While effective at depleting the murine gut bacteria, we found that the less invasive method of adding antibiotics to the drinking water put less stress on our humanized mice and led to better outcomes.\n4. Donor samples and fecal transplant\nPrepare human donor fecal samples.\n\t\nUse properly prepared sources of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) material for fecal transplant into the humanized mice.\nThaw FMT preparations and aliquot them under anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic chamber.\nIf desired, at this step mix equal parts of the fecal samples together to create an unbiased \"human\" sample.\nKeep freezing and thawing of the FMT material to a minimum, if aliquoting or mixing of samples is not needed, only thaw immediately before the procedure.\nHuman fecal transplant\n\t\nAfter completion of 14 days antibiotic treatment, change the drinking water to autoclaved water and move the mice into a new autoclaved cage. Stop daily cage changes and implement a once every 1-2 weeks cage changing schedule.\nGive two fecal transplants at 24 and 48 h post cessation of antibiotics.\n24 h after antibiotics treatment, thaw the needed amount of FMT material, give each mouse 200 μL of FMT material via oral gavage. Repeat procedure again at 48 h post antibiotics.\nSpread any remaining or leftover thawed FMT material on the fur of the humanized mice or onto the cage bedding.\n5. Fresh fecal sample collection\nAutoclave individual paper bags prior to transferring to the fume hood.\nIn the fume hood, put one mouse into each individual paper bag and allow the mouse to defecate.\nUsing sterile forceps, collect the fecal sample into 1.5 mL plastic tubes and freeze at -80 °C. Return the mice to microisolator cages.",
    "NOTE: This method of collecting fecal samples allows for fresh fecal sample collection from individual mice without any stress inducing manipulations.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
