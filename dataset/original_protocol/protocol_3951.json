Tn5 can tagment organellar genomes with high efficiency due to a lack of nucleosomes on chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA (Lu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The following steps are designed to remove cellular and organellar debris and enrich for single nuclei. The gating strategy illustrated here has been optimized for maize nuclei, users may need to adjust the gating strategy specific to their organism. Growth and sampling conditions for published scATAC-seq data from maize and Arabidopsis thaliana tissues can be found in the STAR Methods section in Marand et. al.\nApproximately 3–4 B73 maize V1 seedlings (7–10 day old) were placed on a petri dish on ice and saturated with 500 mL of chilled Lysis buffer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/918-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sample preparation\n(A) Seven-day old B73 maize leaf roll on pitri dish.\n(B) Samples are saturated with 500 μL nuclear lysis buffer.\n(C) Homogenized leaf tissue following two minutes of chopping in nuclear lysis buffer.\n(D) Filtered lysate containing DAPI, nuclei, chloroplast, and mitochondrial contamination prior to flow sorting.\nUsing a sterilized single-edge razor blade, seedlings were chopped for 2 min to break the cell wall and release nuclei into solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nThe aqueous nuclei slurry was then filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOptional: Two layers of sterilized miracloth can be used in place of a 40 μm cell strainer.\n1 μL of DAPI (1 mg/mL) was added for every 200 μL of lysis buffer recovered (e.g., 2 μL DAPI for 400 μL of lysis buffer post filtering).\nSorting was performed on a Moflo Astrios EQ running sterile preservative free flow cytometry solution.",
    "The instrument was set up with a 70 μm tip, sheath pressure at 60 psi and sample pressure at 60.1 psi.\nNuclei were run between 200 and 1000 events/second depending on their concentration.\nNuclei were first gated on log scaled forward scatter (FSC) versus log scaled side scatter (SSC) to eliminate debris (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/918-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow sorting gating strategy\n(A) Forward scatter versus side scatter to eliminate debris.\n(B) DAPI width versus DAPI area to remove nuclear aggregates.\n(C) Green fluorescence versus DAPI area to exclude green fluorescing material.\n(D) Distribution of events by DAPI area to collect nuclei at various stages of the cell cycle and ploidy.\nAll subsequent data were collected in linear mode.\nDAPI width versus DAPI area gating was used to eliminate doublets (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nThe next gate was on a graph depicting green fluorescence vs. DAPI Area to eliminate any green fluorescing material (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThe final gate was on DAPI area selecting the first strong peak and all subsequent peaks depending on the downstream experiment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nSorting was performed in Purity 1 drop mode and triggered on DAPI fluorescence.\nA total of 120,000 nuclei were collected across four 1.5 mL microcentrifuge catch tubes (30,000 nuclei in 200 μL of collection buffer, per tube) and immediately placed on ice.\nCritical: Refrain from chopping for longer than 2 min to reduce rupturing the nuclear envelope. Keep nuclei on ice whenever possible.\nQuantification and evaluation of nuclei quality\nTiming: [30 min]\nThis step describes the evaluation of nuclei quality and concentration prior to generating scATAC-seq libraries.\nFour tubes containing nuclear suspensions (∼230 μL in each tube) were centrifuged at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4°C in swinging bucket centrifuge.\nThe supernatant was discarded, leaving approximately 10 μL in the bottom of each tube.",
    "Critical: Be careful not to disrupt the nuclei pellet at the bottom of the tube when collecting supernatant. The pellet may or may not be visible after centrifugation.\nNuclei pellets were resuspended in the remaining 10 μL of collection buffer by pipetting (10-times) and pooled in a single 1.5 mL centrifuge tube (total volume ∼ 40 μL).\nCritical: The nuclei resuspension should be done by gently pipetting with no visible debris or clumps in the tubes.\nNuclei concentration and quality were evaluated on a hemacytometer under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/918-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Evaluating DAPI-stained nuclei quality under a fluorescent microscope\n(A) 20× magnification of DAPI-stained nuclei via epifluorescence (top) and bright field (bottom) microscopy. The scale bar indicates 20 μm.\n(B) Intact nuclei at 40× magnification via epifluorescence (top) and bright field (bottom) microscopy.\n(C) Nuclei with intermediate ruptured nuclear envelopes at 40× magnification via epifluorescence (top) and bright field (bottom) microscopy.\n(D) Lysed nuclei at 40× magnification via epifluorescence (top) and bright field (bottom) microscopy.\nThe total number of nuclei can be determined by multiplying the concentration by the sample volume.\nCritical: Samples with excessive nuclear aggregates (clumping, Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) or low frequency of intact nuclei (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) should not be used for scATAC-seq library preparation.\nInput nuclei for the 10× Genomics scATAC-seq solution are required to be suspended in diluted nuclei buffer. To achieve this, nuclei were once again pelleted in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4°C.\nThe supernatant was discarded with a P200 filter pipette tip, leaving approximately 10 μL of collection buffer.\nThe final 10 μL of collection buffer was discarded using a P10 filter pipette tip.",
    "Critical: Be careful not to disrupt the nuclei pellet at the bottom of the tube. The pellet may or may not be visible after centrifugation.\nNuclei were resuspended in 10 μL of diluted nuclei buffer (10× Genomics) by 10-times pipetting with wide-bore P20 filtered tips.\nCritical: The nuclei resuspension should be performed by gently pipetting with no visible debris or clumps in the tubes.\nOptional: An additional check of nuclei concentrations and quality can be performed using 1–2 uL of DAPI-stained nuclei with a hemacytometer under a fluorescent microscope. A loss of ∼50% of total nuclei is common during centrifugation.\nThe concentration of nuclei was then adjusted to 3,200 nuclei per μL using diluted nuclei buffer (10× Genomics).\nSingle-cell ATAC-seq library preparation\nTiming: [1–2 days]\nscATAC-seq libraries were then prepared following instructions from the manufacturer (10× Genomics) using 5 μL of nuclei in diluted nuclei buffer (∼16,000 nuclei).

It is important to have the Master Mix prepared as soon as the tagmentation is performed (usually 2 min before the reaction finishes).\nKeep in mind that if the sample number is less than eight it is necessary to load the unused chip wells with 50% glycerol. An easy solution is to load unused wells while the tagmentation reaction is being performed (5–10 min before the reaction finishes).\nFor optimum loading, wait at least 30 s before adding glycerol in each sequential row.\nOptimal droplet formation on the Chromium microfluidics chip H requires a predictable flow rate to generate gel beads in emulsion (GEMs).",
    "Any condition that impairs GEM formation, such as bubbles in the sample/master mix or gel beads well, should be avoided.\nSlowly adding reagents and samples to the bottom of each well helps prevent bubble formation.\nDuring double-sided size selection, the volumetric ratio of SPRIselect to the sample library specified in the manual (74 μL SPRIselect to 130 μL of library) ensures proper selection of amplified fragments by removing primer dimers and excessively large fragments. Collecting more sample volume than the recommended 130 μL in the manual may negatively affect library quality and recovery."
