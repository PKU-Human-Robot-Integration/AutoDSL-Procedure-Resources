    "Mix 1.0% (w/v) birch wood xylan with 1.0% (w/v) agarose in McIlvaine’s buffer (15 ml/Petri dish) and boil in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flask (approximately 10 min) until the birch wood xylan is dissolved completely; mix thoroughly and then dispense it in a Petri plate (44 mm base diameter x 12 mm depth).Allow the birch wood xylan–agarose solution to solidify in the Petri dish and then prepare a 0.5-cm-diameter well on it. The hole in agarose is poked using a hallow flat end of a 0.5-cm-diameter drinking straw.Place 30 µl of A. niger or T. longibrachiatum xylanase solution (total volume to be adjusted with McIlvaine’s buffer) in 0.5-cm-diameter wells of birch wood xylan-agarose Petri plate. Incubate the Petri plate at 30 °C for 16 h. Overlay the plate with 95% ethanol and keep the plate at room temperature for 30 min to reveal the halo representing the degradative activity of xylanase. Measure the diameter of the halo using a scale.Take the image using a digital camera or scan the Petri plate using a scanner to keep the record of the results (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160630/20160630230025_1701.jpgFigure 1.
