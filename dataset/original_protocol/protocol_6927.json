    "Preparation of critical reagentsCRISPR-RNA (crRNA) (IDT)Guidelines for designing crRNA are described in Note 1.ssDNA donorGuidelines for designing the ssDNA donor are described in Note 2.Generate a double-stranded DNA template bearing homology arms.Create a double-stranded DNA template (for an example, see Figures 2A and 2B) using two 90-bases ssDNA primers (for an example, see Figure 2C) and a GFP template (for example, pXL-BacII-CAG-Venus). We use a high-fidelity PCR enzyme (Q5 DNA polymerase), perform a 100-µl reaction in a thermocycler, run agarose gels, and purify the appropriately sized major PCR product (Left arm + GFP + right arm: ~850 bp; Figure 2C) using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g002.jpgFigure 2. Designing crRNA and the ssDNA donor: TFAP2A is given as an example. (A) The TFAP2A gene in the UCSC Genome Browser. (B) Genomic sequence of TFAP2A in the targeted region and TFAP2A-crRNA as shown in A. (C) 90 nucleotide primer sequences that anneal to the 5’ (ATG) and 3’ ends of GFP and the structure of the single-strand donor DNA used for inserting GFP into the TFAP2A locus. (D) Primers and single-strand donor DNA for inserting CRE into the TFAP2A locus. See Table 1 for sequences.This PCR uses standard methods and equipment. A typical reaction is for 25 cycles (2 min, 95°C; 25 cycles of 94°C, 30 s/60°C, 30 s/72°C, 1 min + 1 s extension at 72°C/cycle; 72°C, 7 min; 4°C). If a clean single PCR band is not obtained, try using buffers optimized for GC-rich templates and/or adding DMSO.Table 1. Primer sequences (see Figure 2 and Figure 8)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210730/20210730012430_3065.png Optimize PCR for ssDNA generationBefore carrying out a large-scale preparation of ssDNA by asymmetric PCR, it is helpful to optimize the reaction on a small scale. We use a robust and low-price PCR enzyme mixture for this purpose.",
    "First, using the double-stranded DNA template prepared above, we set up two reactions containing different molar ratios of primers: Reaction #1, 1 forward:100 reverse; Reaction #2, 100 forward:1 reverse.Reaction #1 and Reaction #2 (2 tubes)50 µl EconoTaq PLUS GREEN 2× Master47 µl dH2O1 µl ~0.01 µg/µl template from Step A2a1 µl 0.01 mM primer: (Reaction #1) Forward or (Reaction #2) Reverse1 µl 1 mM primer: (Reaction #1) Reverse or (Reaction #2) Forward*Note that typical PCR uses 0.1 mM primer stocks. Split into two PCR wells (50 µl each). 94°C, 2 min40 cycles of 94°C, 30 s/60°C, 30 s/72°C, 1 min + 1 s extension at 72°C/cycle72°C, 7 min4°CRun 1%(w/v) agarose gels (with ethidium bromide). Note that ssDNA is less effectively stained with ethidium bromide than is double-stranded DNA.A typical result is shown in Figure 3A. In this case (TFAP2A), Reaction #1 gave one intense band (~850 bp) and several faint bands, including one that co-migrated with a ~500 bp double-strand DNA marker. Reaction #2 gave two clean bands: the slow-migrating band (asterisk) corresponds to double-stranded DNA (~850 bp) based on its predicted size. However, electrophoretic migration of ssDNA is often anomalous in regular non-denaturation electrophoresis buffers, making it difficult to be sure which band corresponds to ssDNA species. It is therefore useful to incubate a portion of the PCR product (2 µl) with E. coli exonuclease I, which specifically digests linear ssDNA. As shown in Figure 3B, some bands from the digest, including part of the diffuse band at ~500 bp, were resistant to E. coli exonuclease I digestion, suggesting that some double-strand DNAs were present at ~500 bp. By contrast, in Reaction #2, the corresponding band was less diffuse and was completely digested by E. coli exonuclease I, indicating that it contained only ssDNA (arrow).",
    "Therefore, we used the conditions of Reaction 2 for large-scale preparation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g003.jpgFigure 3. Assessing the quality of ssDNA. (A) Products generated by asymmetric PCR (molar ratio of primers (forward/reverse): 1/100 in Reaction #1; 100/1 in Reaction #2). (B) PCR products were digested with E. coli Exonuclease I (E. coli Exo I), which specifically digests single-strand DNA (arrow). An additional band (asterisk) corresponds to double-strand DNA. See text for details.Large-scale preparation of the ssDNA donorScale-up the reaction optimized in b and then purify the ssDNA donor.500 µl EconoTaq PLUS GREEN 2× Master470 µl dH2O10 µl ~0.01 µg/µl template from Step A2a10 µl 0.01 mM Reverse primer10 µl 1 mM Forward primerSplit into 20 PCR wells (50 µl each)94°C, 2 min40 cycles of 94°C, 30 s/60°C, 30 s/72°C, 1 min +1 s extension72°C, 7 min4°CRun a large agarose gel and purify ssDNA using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.It is important to use thin wells so that the bands are clearly separated. Typically, we use an 11-cm wide × 13-cm long × ~7-mm thick gel. After solubilizing the agarose in the QG solution (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit), add 20% volume 2-propanol, and load onto 4 mini spin-columns. Elute each tube with 100 µl EB (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit) and 50 µl EB, successively. Add 1:10 volume 5 M NaCl, extract twice with phenol-chloroform, then twice with chloroform, and finally ethanol-precipitate by adding 2.5 volumes -20°C ethanol. Rinse the pellets three times with 70% ethanol at -20°C. Spin down, completely remove the residual ethanol, dry, and resuspend in RNase-free water (total 20 µl).Estimate the DNA concentration using a conventional or NanoDropTM (Thermo Fisher) spectrophotometer. Note that OD260 of ssDNA is lower due to hyperchromicity (40 µg/ml for OD260 as opposed to 50 µg/ml for double-stranded DNA).",
    "Adjust the concentration to 1 µg/µl, freeze, and store at -20°C until use.Equipment setupFigure 4 shows a stereomicroscope setup for injection and electroporation (Figure 4A and 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Glass capillary loaded with eCHIKIN cocktail plus Fast Green.Tungsten needleCut a 0.1-mm tungsten wire to an appropriate length (~2 cm) and sharpen the tip. We sharpen it electrically (Brady, 1965) (see Figure 4C and 4D).Glass capillaries for injectionMake glass capillaries for injection. We use home-made micropipettes that are finely drawn from glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, 1B100F-3 (3-inch, 1-mm) using a puller. Break off the last few mm of the tip to allow facile injection while maintaining sharpness (Figure 4E).Incubation of eggsAt appropriate times prior to injection and electroporation (see below), place the eggs in the incubator. Eggs need to be incubated on their side (horizontally; Figure 5A). Mark the top of each egg since the embryo will float on top of the yolk. Incubate more eggs than you plan to inject because some are likely to be infertile or have embryos poorly placed for injection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g005.jpgFigure 5.

All plasticware and reagents must be RNase-free.",
    "crRNA:transcrRNA/Cas9 RNP (Solution “R”)To reconstitute the guide RNA duplex, the target-specific crRNA (35-36 nt) and tracrRNA (67 nt) are combined, heat-denatured, and annealed by slowly chilling to room temperature. In a 1.5-ml tube, add these reagents in this order:2.5 µl dH2O0.5 µl 10× Reaction Buffer1 µl crRNA (2 nmol/20 µl dH2O; concentration, 100 µM)1 µl tracrRNA (2 nmol/20 µl dH2O; concentration, 100 µM)Spin briefly and incubate for 5 min at 95°C in a heat block.Leave at room temperature so that cooling is slow, maximizing annealing.Leave for 5 min, briefly spin, and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Add 0.8 µl 10 mg/ml Cas9 protein (Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 Nuclease V3), mix, spin briefly, and incubate for 60 min at room temperature. This solution is Solution “R.”Denaturation of the ssDNA donorThe ssDNA donor should be prepared in advance and stored at -20°C until use.Thaw the frozen aliquot, heat at 95°C for 5 min, and rapidly cool on ice. This denaturation can be carried out simultaneously with the annealing of crRNA:tracrRNA/Cas9 RNP described in the previous step. However, in contrast to slow annealing of the crRNA:tracrRNA, this tube needs to be cooled quickly by placing on ice immediately. Spin the tube briefly before use.Dilution buffer with HDR enhancer (Solution “D”)In an RNase-free 1.5-ml tube, add these reagents in this order:21.5 µl dH2O2.5 µl 10× Reaction Buffer1 µl Alt-R® HDR Enhancer (available as a solution suspended in DMSO). Mix well and spin briefly.piggyBac plasmid mixture (Solution “P”)For GFP reporter eCHIKIN, mix in a 1.5-ml tube:45 µl 1 µg/µl pXL-BacII CAG-mCherry5 µl 1 µg/µl pCAG-mPBFor Cre reporter eCHIKIN, mix in a 1.5-ml tube:22.5 µl 1 µg/µl pXL-BacII CAG-mCherry22.5 µl 1 µg/µl pXL-BacII CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-Venus5 µl 1 µg/µl pCAG-mPBNote that these plasmid DNAs must be RNase-free (see Recipe 5 and Note 3).",
    "Final injection cocktailTo a tube of Solution “R” (total 5.8 µl), add these reagents in this order (see Note 4):11 µl Solution “D”3 µl 1 µg/µl ssDNA donor (denatured at 95°C in advance)3 µl Alt-R® Cas9 Electroporation Enhancer (2 nmol/50 µl; concentration, 40 µM)3 µl Solution “P”2 µl 0.1%(w/v) Fast GreenMix well and place this solution on ice. Use within 5-6 h.Preparation of eggs and embryosEmbryos reach stage 9-10 in ~40 h at 38°C. Thus, if eggs are placed in the incubator at 8 pm (Day 0), they should be ready to electroporate at noon on Day 2. However, embryos should be staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (1951) because the developmental rate is sensitive to small changes in temperature and also varies among eggs. To slow development when planning to inject many embryos, eggs can be removed from the incubator and maintained at room temperature for up to 5-6 h without compromising viability.Spray eggs with 70% ethanol and allow to dry. Always keep the previously marked top side of the egg facing upward (Figure 5B).Apply a piece of transparent tape to the top of each egg (Figure 5C).Insert an 18 ½ G needle on a 10-ml syringe into the rounded side of each egg (Figure 5D); this side contains the air sac.Remove 1-2 ml egg albumin depending on the size of the eggs (Figure 5E). Some researchers omit this step to obtain better survival.Make a small window (~5-mm diameter) on top of the egg by cutting through the tape and shell using surgical scissors with curved blades (Figure 5F and 5G).Injection and in ovo electroporationIf necessary, gently rock the egg so that the embryo sits on top of the yolk. Make the window larger if needed (Figure 6A).",
    "In some cases, the translucent membrane beneath the shell needs to be carefully removed using #5 forceps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g006.jpgFigure 6. Key steps of injection and in ovo electroporation. (A) Locate the embryo and expand the window. (B) Place the cathode as in G and inject the reagent cocktail (blue) into the embryo. (C) Wet the cathode and embryo with Hanks’ + kanamycin. (D-E) Insert the anode as in G and electroporate. After successful electroporation, small bubbles appear at the anode. (F) Seal the egg with plastic tape. It is important to seal the small hole (green) that was made for removing albumin. (G) Summary.Place the egg under the dissection microscope. For beginners, it may be challenging to see enough detail in the embryos for accurate injection. One aid is to inject a few µl black India ink beneath the embryo. Images in Hamburger and Hamilton (1951) are useful for orientation.Place the L-shaped cathode parallel to the embryo (Figure 6A and 6G).Load the CRISPR cocktail into a micropipette (Figure 4E) and inject ~0.1-0.2 µl using a mouth pipette or microinjector (e.g., FemtoJet, Eppendorf). To transduce the retina, inject to one side of the optic vesicle of stage 9-10 embryos (Figure 6B and 6G). To transduce the optic tectum, injection should be targeted to the midbrain vesicle at stage 11-12.Wet both the cathode and embryo with 20 µl HBSS + kanamycin using a pipette tip (Figure 6C).Insert the fine tungsten anode of the electroporator into the head of the embryo (Figure 6D and 6G).Deliver square wave pulses (Figure 6E and 6G). For optic vesicles, we use 6 pulses (7 V/25 ms) at 1-s intervals. A sign of successful electroporation is the appearance of numerous tiny bubbles at the anode.Close the window with transparent tape (Figure 6F).",
    "It is important to also seal the small hole (green arrowhead in Figure 6F) that was made to remove the albumin.Place the eggs back in the 38°C incubator.This technique (Steps D2 and D3) relies heavily on the performer’s skill and requires considerable practice. Experts can inject one embryo every few minutes or ~120 embryos in a 4-h session.Histological analysisChick embryos hatch at E21; however, mortality increases greatly from E17. This is a common consequence of manipulations that introduce a window in the eggshell; it is not specific to eCHIKIN. Thus, it is best to retrieve tissue by E16, if possible. Both the retina and optic tectum are fairly mature by that age.Although other methods can be used, the main analytical method is immunohistology. Embryos are retrieved, and the appropriate regions (retina or tectum in the cases described here) are dissected. The tissues are fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 h, sunk in 15% (w/v) and 30% (w/v) sucrose/PBS successively, embedded in Tissue Freezing Medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences), frozen at -80°C, and sectioned at 20 µm in a cryostat. Sections are then double-stained with anti-GFP and antibodies against cell class- or type-specific markers. Commercially available rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP, and anti-GFP nanobody-reporter conjugates (RANbodies; Yamagata and Sanes, 2018a) can be used. However, commercially available chicken anti-GFP IgY antibodies display high background in chick tissues and should be avoided. Detailed immunohistochemical methods have been described in previous publications (Yamagata and Sanes, 2018b and 2019; Yamagata et al., 2021).A problem that we encountered was finding cells marked by eCHIKIN, both because they were rare and because in some cases expression levels were low. To circumvent this limitation, we co-electroporated a second reporter (usually a red fluorescent protein) expressed from a strong, ubiquitous (CAG) promoter.",
    "To guarantee maintained expression through multiple cell divisions, we ensured stable genomic integration using a piggyBac transposon/transposase system. In most cases, fluorescence from the CAG-driven fluorescent protein was readily detectable in tissue using a dissection microscope equipped with fluorescence. Regions identified in this way could then be dissected, sectioned, and immunostained.A potential confounding factor is that HDR could lead to integration into, and thus inactivation of, both copies of a targeted allele, resulting in alterations in the target cell. We did not encounter this problem: labeled cells that we were able to visualize by alternative methods (e.g., immunohistochemistry) were not detectably abnormal. Nonetheless, we cannot dismiss it and therefore tested two methods to circumvent it. In one, we maintain the function of endogenous protein by targeting the C-terminus to generate a fusion protein. For example, we appended GFP to the C-terminus of the TFAP2A coding region (Figure 7E, Figure 8A, and 8B). This method reveals the subcellular distribution of the tagged protein. In the case shown, the TFAP2A protein is a nuclear transcription factor, so the fusion protein is localized in the nucleus (Figure 7F). Subcellular localization can be either advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the purpose of the experiment. As a second approach, when cell filling is desired, we use the self-cleavable 2A peptide to generate the inserted proteins and, separately, GFP (Figure 7E). We use a tandem fusion of two 2A sequences (tPT2A) comprising P2A (2A from porcine teschovirus-1) and T2A (2A from thosea asigna virus) (Liu et al., 2017) to separate TFAP2A from GFP. In this case, GFP remained soluble and filled the cytoplasm (Figures 7G and 8C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4105/bioprotoc-11-15-4105-g007.jpgFigure 7. eCHIKIN for TFAP2A.

(A) Genomic sequence of TFAP2A flanking its C-terminus. TGA (red) is a termination codon. The target sequence (opposite strand) of TFAP2A-Cter-crRNA is shown below. (B) To generate a donor DNA template with 70 bases arms, two 90-nt primers were used.",
    "One primer (TFAP2A-Cter-left arm-GFP-Forward) links to the 5’end of the GFP sequence (ATG), the other primer (TFAP2A-Cter-right arm-GFP-Reverse) links to the 3’ end of GFP. (C) To insert the tPT2A self-cleavable peptide sequence between TFAP2A and GFP, the donor DNA template was generated with two primers using a tPT2A-GFP plasmid as a template. See Table 1 for sequences.EXAMPLES Figure 7 shows examples of TFAP2A-expressing chick cells labeled using the eCHIKIN method. TFAP2A encodes a transcription factor expressed strongly by amacrine cells and weakly by horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Figure 7A, from a retina transfection with a TFAP2A/GFP knock-in construct, shows that integration events were in some cases quite frequent. It is apparent that eCHIKN-labeled cells are all present in the inner nuclear layer, where amacrine cells are localized, whereas CAG-mCherry labeled cells are distributed among all retinal layers. The number of cells per layer is likely influenced by the number of divisions between the integration of the piggyBac transposon plasmid and later analysis; this varies among cell classes and types. In this image, there are more eCHIKIN-GFP-labeled cells than mCherry-labeled cells, but this is atypical. Figure 7B-D shows sections from retinas labeled by co-electroporation of TFAP2A-cre and a cre-dependent reporter. Cells in Figure 7B and 7C were labeled with anti-GFP, while cells in Figure 7D were labeled with an anti-GFP RANbody (P-RAN-GFP1; Yamagata and Sanes, 2018a). The RANbody provides more intense labeling than conventional indirect immunofluorescence (Yamagata and Sanes, 2018a). Figure 7F and 7G, described above, shows cells labeled with TFAP2A-Cter-eCHIKIN-GFP and TFAP2A-Cter-tPT2A-GFP-eCHIKIN, respectively.    Application of eCHIKIN to 15 other genes, expressed by all retinal neuronal classes – photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells – is illustrated in Yamagata et al. (2021).",
    "In our hands, eCHIKIN successfully labels ~90% of genes, although the efficiency of labeling is quite variable. In this fast-moving field, new methods can be added to the eCHIKIN protocol to enhance efficiency (Yeh et al., 2019; Broeders et al., 2020).    We also applied eCHIKIN to the optic tectum. Figure 7H shows labeling of cells with TFAP2A-GFP in the same laminar distribution as those labeled with anti-TFAP2A (Figure 7I). This result provides encouragement that eCHIKIN could be applied to multiple tissues in chick embryos and possibly to other birds. From our experience to date, we believe that the main key to the success of the technique is to achieve robust electroporation and choose appropriate CRISPR reagents; thus, the protocol may need to be modified for other tissues or species."
