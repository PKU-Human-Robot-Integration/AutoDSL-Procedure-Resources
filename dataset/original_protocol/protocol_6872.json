    "Biological samplesIt is essential that all work using human tissue receives prior approval from the appropriate institutional and/or national review boards; donors must always provide informed consent. For this work, tissue samples were obtained with written informed consent from all participants under ethical approval from the East of England–Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (17/EE/0151).All work with unscreened human placental tissue is regarded as a potential hazard for group 3 blood-borne pathogens and should be carried out in containment level 2 facilities.Obtaining a single-cell suspension from first-trimester placental tissueHBC are fetal macrophages found within the stroma of the villi, which make up the placenta. A series of enzymatic digestions ensures the breakdown of the tissue to obtain a single-cell suspension with high HBC yield and viability (see Note 2). This single-cell suspension will also contain other cell types that make up the placenta, including trophoblast cells and fibroblasts, as well as placenta-associated maternal monocytes/macrophages (PAMM) (Thomas et al., 2021). A purified population of HBC can be obtained from this digest by FACS, a method described in further detail in Procedure D.Prepare reagents and equipmentThe same materials and equipment are required for Procedures B. Media, reagents, and tools must be sterile (see Note 1).Prepare the Trypsin/EDTA solution (see Recipes)Prepare the RF10 medium (see Recipes)Prepare the collagenase V stock solution (10 mg/ml) by dissolving it in RF10. Distribute the solution to 2.5 ml aliquots and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months.Prepare the DNase I stock solution (10 mg/ml) by dissolving it in sterile water. Distribute the solution to 100 µl aliquots at -20 °C for up to 6 months.Prepare PBS with DNase I (20 µg/ml) by diluting an aliquot of DNase I (from Procedure B1d) in 50 ml of 1× PBS.",
    "Keep sterile at 4 °C and make fresh each time (see Note 3).Before beginning placental tissue processing, warm Trypsin/EDTA (0.2% solution), collagenase V, 1× PBS, and Pancoll to 37 °C. Set a heated shaker to 37 °C, with 500 rotations per min (RPM), and set a magnetic stirrer hot plate to 37 °C.Processing first-trimester placental tissue to obtain a single-cell suspensionProcess the placenta immediately upon receipt.Rinse the placenta in 1× PBS gently with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min at room temperature (RT).Transfer placenta to a Petri dish.Remove any blood clots with forceps.Hold down one end of the placental unit and gently scrape the villi from the chorionic membrane with a scalpel (see Figure 2A).Discard the fetal membrane.Using a Pasteur pipette (with the tip cut off), transfer scraped villi into 75 ml of pre-warmed 0.2% trypsin-EDTA in a sterile 250-ml glass Duran bottle. Place on the hot plate magnetic stirrer heated to 37 °C and stir gently for 7 min.Add 2 ml of FCS to stop the trypsinisation of the tissue.Filter the trypsined tissue through a sterile muslin gauze in a funnel.Rinse with PBS at RT.Keep both the digested tissue that ran through the gauze and the remaining tissue on the gauze.Retrieve the undigested tissue from the gauze using a scalpel and place it in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Add 2.5 ml of collagenase V and 100 µl of DNase I and add PBS to a final volume of 25 ml (final concentration of 1 mg/ml Collagenase V and 40 µg/ml DNase I).Note: The addition of DNase I is crucial; macrophage yield and viability are greatly reduced in the absence of DNase I. Digest for 20-30 min at 37 °C on the heated shaker at 500 RPM.",
    "Filter the resultant cell suspension through the sterile muslin gauze in a funnel. Discard any undigested tissue and centrifuge the filtrate for 5 min at 120 × g, RT, to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.Pool the cells from steps i and n and wash in PBS with DNase I (see Note 3).Note: The cells from Step B2i will mainly contain maternal and trophoblast cells. We have found that HBC are sometimes also found in this digest, and pooling cells from Steps B2i and B2n will help to maximize HBC yield. However, it not essential to pool the cells from Steps B2i and B2n, as few HBC are found in the cellular suspension from Step B2i. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of PBS with DNase I.Filter the cell suspension through a 400 µm strainer.Layer the cell suspension onto 10 ml of Pancoll in a 50 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge for 20 min at 600 × g, RT, acceleration 0, break 1.Collect the cells at the interface using a Pasteur pipette.Wash with PBS with DNase I and centrifuge for 5 min at 120 × g, RT. Discard the supernatant.Repeat the previous step.Resuspend cells in PBS with DNase I and pass through a 70 µm strainer, count the cells with a haemocytometer, and place them on ice (see Notes 2 and 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4044/bioprotoc-11-11-4044-g002.jpgFigure 2. Scraping of placental villi. Images showing scraping of placental villi from (A) first-trimester and (B) full-term placenta.Obtaining a single-cell suspension from full-term placental tissueHuman placenta collected from full-term pregnancies differs dramatically from those in the first trimester. As pregnancy progresses, placental villi continue sprouting, and the vascular network matures to increase the surface area and vascularisation of the organ and meet the needs of the growing fetus.",
    "Full-term placental villi have a more compact fibrous stroma with muscular arteries, which are absent in the first trimester (Castellucci and Kaufmann, 1982). For this reason, the digestion of full-term placental tissue for the isolation of HBC differs from that described in Procedure B for first-trimester placenta and is outlined in detail below.Prepare reagents and equipmentPrepare reagents and equipment as described in Step B1.Process full-term placental tissue to obtain a single-cell suspensionProcess the placenta immediately upon receipt.Cut out a lobe from the whole placenta using surgical scissors.Note: For consistency between donors, always isolate the lobe from the same region. Rinse the placenta in PBS gently with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min at RT.Transfer to a Petri dish.Remove any blood clots with forceps.Remove and discard a thin layer (~1 mm) of tissue from the basal side (side which faces the mother) using surgical scissors.Note: This step ensures the removal of any decidual tissue from the placenta. Hold down one end of the placental unit and gently scrape the villi from the chorionic membrane with a scalpel (see Figure 2B).Discard the fetal membrane and any thick connective tissue fibers and visible blood vessels.Using a Pasteur pipette (with the tip cut off), transfer scraped villi into 75 ml of pre-warmed 0.2% trypsin-EDTA in a sterile glass Duran bottle (250 ml). Place on the hot plate magnetic stirrer heated to 37 °C and stir gently for 15 min (see Note 4).Add 2 ml of FCS to stop the trypsinisation of the tissue.Filter the trypsined tissue through a sterile muslin gauze in a funnel.Rinse the gauze with PBS at RT.Keep both the digested tissue that ran through the gauze and the remaining tissue on the gauze.Retrieve the undigested tissue from the gauze and place in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Add 2.",
    "5 ml of collagenase V and 200 µl of DNase I and add PBS to a final volume of 25 ml (final concentration of 1 mg/ml collagenase V and 80 µg/ml DNase I).Note: The addition of DNase is crucial; macrophage yield and viability are greatly reduced in the absence of DNase I. Digest for 60 min at 37 °C on the heated shaker at 500 RPM (see Note 4).Filter the digested tissue through a sterile muslin gauze in a funnel. Discard any undigested tissue and centrifuge the filtrate for 5 min at 120 × g, RT, to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.Repeat Steps B2o-B2w.Isolating Hofbauer cells from first-trimester and full-term placental digestsIn this protocol, single-cell digests obtained from Procedures B and C are stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for the isolation of HBC by FACS. The protocol includes an optimized panel and gating strategy that allows isolating a highly purified population of HBC without contamination of maternal monocytes/macrophages that are found in placental digests.Prepare reagents and equipment (see Note 1)Prepare the FACS buffer (see Recipes). Keep sterile and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.Prepare blocking buffer (see Recipes). Filter through a 0.2 µm sterile filter and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.Note: All serum is heat inactivated by placing in a water bath at 56 °C for 30 min. Prepare 0.9 mM DAPI in sterile water. Store at -20 °C indefinitely.Prepare RF10 as described in Step B1b.Isolate HBC by FACSPass cells through a 30 µm filter into a polypropylene FACS tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 120 × g, 4 °C. Discard supernatant.Resuspend cells in 150 µl of human blocking buffer per 10 × 106 cells.",
    "Make antibody cocktail in 50 µl of Brilliant stain buffer per tube (follow dilutions in Table 1, for a final volume of 200 µl). The same antibody cocktail is used for first-trimester and full-term placental cells.Add the antibody cocktail to the cells and mix by gently vortexing.Incubate on ice for 20 min.Add 2 ml of cold FACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 120 × g, 4 °C. Discard supernatant.Repeat previous step.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of cold FACS buffer.Stain cells with DAPI (1:10,000) for 10 min prior to starting the sorting.See representative images of the gating strategy used to identify HBC within first-trimester and full-term placental digests in Figure 3 (see Note 6).Cells are sorted at 4 °C into appropriate collection tubes and buffers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4044/bioprotoc-11-11-4044-g003.jpgFigure 3.
