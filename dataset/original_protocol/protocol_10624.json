    "1. Microscope Specifications\nTo carry out imaging in the correct fashion the microscope should have the following specifications:\nPossess both differential interference contrast (DIC) and brightfield (BF) contrast.\nHave computer-controlled z-axis movement.\nHave an adjustable aperture stop to vary the condenser lens numerical aperture. An aperture with a graded rule or electronic readout is required to know the value of the numerical aperture. The numerical aperture should range from 0.1 for NIQPM up to 0.9 (or higher) for HTDIC.\nThe microscope should have a narrow band color filter to be utilized for bright field imaging. This filter is required to fix the refractive increment, a wavelength-dependent facture used to convert phase to mass density for NIQP.\n2. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Z-stack Acquisition\nOpen the SlideBook software and create a new slide for image collection.\nNext, open the Focus Window. Under the Filter Set section, select DIC. On the Scope tab, under the Condenser section, adjust the Aperture slide bar to the furthest right position (open all the way). This provides high numerical aperture illumination and enhances optical sectioning of the specimen.\nFocus on the sample using a DIC objective. Adjust the halogen lamp intensity until the sample is easily visible. To ensure the camera is not being saturated, select the Camera tab in the Focus Window and check that the histogram of pixel intensities is within the dynamic range of the camera.\nOpen the Image Capture window. In the Capture Type section, check the 3D box. In the 3D Capture section, select the Range around center and Return to current location boxes and specify the Z-direction range, number of planes, and step size. The Z-direction range should incorporate the entire sample.",
    "In the Filter Set section of the Image Capture window, check the DIC box and specify exposure time. In the Image Information section, name the image (optional), and select Start to initiate the imaging.\n3. Bright Field (BF) Z-stack Acquisition\nOnce the microscope has finished collecting the DIC Z-stack of the sample, open the Focus Window and select Open under the Filter Set section. Adjust the Aperture slide bar to the furthest left position (closed all the way) to provide low NA illumination.\nChange the microscope light-path filter to green. Adjust the halogen lamp intensity until the sample is visible. Ensure there is no saturation of the camera by selecting the Camera tab in the Focus Window and checking that the histogram of pixel intensities is within the specified range.\nOpen the Image Capture window. The 3D Capture settings from the DIC Z-stack acquisition will be displayed.\nIn the Filter Set section of the Image Capture window, check the OPEN box and specify exposure time. In the Image Information section, name the image (optional), and select Start to initiate Z-stack image acquisition.\n4. Exporting Z-stack Images\nOpen a Z-stack capture. Change the view to 100%. Adjust the histogram of the pixel values to be displayed between 0 and the maximum pixel value of the camera (4,095 for 12 bit cameras, 65,535 for 16 bit.).\nSelect View > Export > TIFF Series. This will export the Z-stack as a series of TIFF images (one for each Z plane). Save the TIFF series in a separate folder with a name that has an underscore at the end (i.e. \"DIC Stack 1_\"). Repeat this with each DIC or BF Z-stack.\n5. Volume Measurements\nOpen the HTDIC MATLAB program entitled \"JoVE_HTDIC_v1.m\".",
    "Under Section 0 of the HTDIC program, update the dependencies directory variable. Copy and paste the directory containing the hilbert_transform_dic.m and sobel_edge_detect.m files from explorer (PC) in between the single quotes following \"dependencies_directory =\". ExecuteSection 0 of the JoVE_HTDIC_v1.m program.\nIn Section 1, update the \"images_directory\". Again, copy and paste the directory containing the through-focus images in .tif form in between the single quotes. ONLY RUN SECTION 1 ONCE.\nAlignment and rotation of images for Hilbert transform Run Section 2 of the code. A dialog box titled \"Define HTDIC Parameters\" will appear. Five numbers are required from the user: the focal plane number where the DIC image of the sample is in focus, lateral resolution (μm/pixel in the image), the axial resolution (this is 0.1 for image acquisition in 0.1 μm axial steps), the rotation angle of the DIC image needed to perform the Hilbert transform, typical values are 45 and -135. Lastly, enter the region of interest size, this parameter defines the length of a side of a box that will subsequently appear - typical value is 400. Click Ok.\nAn image of the DIC focal plane specified by the focal plane number will appear with a blue box. Position the box over the feature of interest, e.g. a cell. The box need not be square. Once the box has been positioned over the desired region, double click inside the box.\nAnother figure will now appear: this figure contains a cropped and rotated image of the region of interest selected in the previous step. The contrast of the image should be such that dark features appear on the left while bright features appear on the right. Drag the blue box over the region of interest, reshape as necessary.",
    "Section 3 generates a mask for the z-stack cube. There are two types of masks available: a rectangular mask to create a rectangle around the cell and a free-hand tool to outline the cell of interest by hand.\nTo generate a rectangular mask, uncomment line 167 and comment line 170 (comment a line out by placing a \"%\" at the beginning of that line). Execute Section 3 of the program. Click in the image and drag the mouse to begin defining the rectangular mask. Double click on the box to accept it.\nTo generate a hand-drawn mask, comment line 167 and uncomment line 170 and execute Section 3. Click and draw the desired mask with the mouse. Double click on the mask to accept it.\nRun Section 4to construct the Hilbert transformed DIC image stack and the corresponding DIC image stack of the area of interest. The mask constructed in Section 3 will be applied to the Hilbert transform DIC stack and the regular DIC stack when \"maskON\" is set to 1 at line 179. Setting \"maskON\" to 0 will construct image stacks without applying the mask.\nRun Section 5 to optimize the image segmentation of the xz cross sectional images of the region of interest. Figure 500, produced by the program, appears displaying three different types of contrast. The success of the algorithm to find the borders of the cell is reliant on a combination of the mask used and the value of \"threshold\" at line 229 of the program. Begin with a value of 0.5. Adjust the value of threshold and rerun this section of the program until the proper outlining is achieved in one of the columns.",
    "If the outlining was best in column 1, use Section 6 to determine the volume using DIC image segmentation. If column 2 gave optimal results, run Section 7 to determine cell volume from Hilbert-transformed DIC imagery. If column 3 gave the optimal results, run Section 8 to determine volume using Fourier-filtered Hilbert-transformed DIC imagery.\nThe measured volume of the sample, reported in cubic μm (fl) is presented in the title of Figure 600, 700, or 800 produced by the program depending on which volume measurement is chosen.\n6. Mass Measurements\nOpen the NIQPM MATLAB program entitled \"JoVE_NIQPM_v1.m\".\nUnder Section 0 of the NIQPM program, update the location of three directories needed to run the program. These are the \"dependencies_directory,\" the \"brightfield_directory,\" and the \"dic_directory.\"\nNext, run Section 1. This section of code generates a bright field image cube of the full field of the entire set of images. ONLY RUN SECTION 1 ONCE.\nNext, run Section 2. A dialog box titled \"Define NIQPM Parameters\" will appear. Four numbers are required from the user: the focal plane number where the bright field image of the sample is in focus, lateral resolution (μm/pixel in the image), the axial resolution (this is 0.1 for image acquisition in 0.1 μm axial steps), and the region of interest size, this parameter defines the length of a side of a box that will subsequently appear - a typical value is 200. Click Ok.\nAn image of the bright field focal plane specified by the focal plane number will appear with a blue box.\n\t\nIf the image is not in focus, double click in the blue box and rerun Section 2, be sure to adjust the focal plane number in the dialog box.",
    "If the image is in focus, drag the blue box around the image and resize it by selecting the nodes of the box and dragging them as necessary. Position the box around the feature of interest, e.g. a cell. The box need not be square. Double click inside the box to accept it.\nNext, run Section 3 to construct a stack of bright field images cropped to the region of interest.\nTo generate the phase map, pseudo DIC image, and comparisons to bright field imagery and the true DIC image, run Section 4.\nWith the pseudo DIC and true DIC images as similar as possible the mass density map, total mass, and histogram of the cell density can be determined by running Section 5a or 5b. Section 5a carries out automated boarder detection of the field - optimize \"threshold\" at line 300 - typical values vary between 0.1-1. Rerun this section as needed to optimize the value of threshold. Section 5b carries out mass determination, etc. after the user outlines the cell of interest.\nSubscription Required.
