    "All human experiments were approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.\n1. Patient Identification\nAdminister informed consent with the patient or substitute decision maker. Explain potential adverse events related to the procedure, such as bleeding and neurological deficits, to the patient.\nAssess the candidate patient for MRgFUS thalamotomy. A physician with expertise in movement disorder should perform the assessment.\n\tNOTE: It is important to rule out differential diagnoses such as dystonic tremor, Parkinson's Disease, and psychogenic tremor. Further, the neurologist should assess whether adequate trials of medical treatments have been attempted, and the patient deemed treatment-refractory.\nCheck for contraindications such as an inability to tolerate an MRI.\nAssess the patient's medical fitness along with an anesthetist.\n\tNOTE: Active heart disease, impaired kidney function, and propensity for bleeding are all contraindications for MRgFUS.\nObtain bloodwork such as complete blood cell count, electrolytes, creatinine, and coagulation panel as part of the screening process.\nPerform a full neurological exam (Table 1) and use the clinical rating scale for tremor (CRST) to document tremor and disability. It is useful to also administer a standard quality of life scale to capture this information at baseline and to follow it over time.\n2. Imaging Setup\nObtain a CT scan prior to the day of treatment to assess for any intracranial calcifications and skull thickness.\n\tNOTE: The CT scan should have at least 512 by 512 resolution, 1 mm thickness with zero spacing, covering the entire skull from the very top to the skull-base.\nObtain an MR scan prior to the day of treatment to rule out contraindications such as previous intracranial hemorrhage or brain tumor.",
    "Use a commercially available helmet transducer with 1,024 independent elements, each with central frequency 650 kHz and integrated with a 3 Tesla MR scanner8. MRI thermometry is available to provide real time feedback of the target temperature.\n3. Patient Preparation\nAdvise the patient not to take their medication for essential tremor on the day of treatment and not to have anything by mouth beginning at midnight the night before surgery.\nCheck the patient into the hospital, typically through Same Day Surgery.\nEnsure the entire team is present: neurosurgeon, movement disorder neurologist, physicist, imaging technician, and anesthetist.\n\tNOTE: An anesthetist should be available to support the patient throughout the procedure in case of discomfort, anxiety, and vertigo/vomiting, while keeping the patient conscious at all times.\nPlace suction equipment nearby for emergency airway maintenance and peripheral intravenous lines in case medications need to be administered urgently.\nAttach non-invasive monitors of heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.\nInsert a Foley catheter, if necessary, for the patient to empty his/her bladder.\nPut graduated compression stockings on the patient to help prevent deep venous thrombosis in the lower limbs.\nCarefully shave the hair completely and check for scalp lesions.\nPlace the stereotactic frame with the help of a neurosurgeon and apply local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine or bupivicaine) at the 4 pin sites.\nPlace the rubber diaphragm on the patient's head.\n\tNOTE: Because the space between the transducer and scalp is filled with degassed water, a rubber diaphragm encircles the patient's head to prevent the water from leaking. Cool water is circulated, carrying away any excess heat from the scalp.\nEnsure the patient does not have any ferrous components before entering the procedure room.\nHave the patient lie flat, headfirst into the ultrasound helmet.\nCover the patient with a warming blanket to prevent hypothermia.",
    "NOTE: The temperature in the treatment room is approximately 15 °C.\n4. Target Selection of the Vim nucleus of the thalamus\nPerform a preliminary 3D localizer MR scan and T2-weighted sequence with at least axial and sagittal planes immediately prior to sonication to register the patient to pre-treatment CT/MRI scans.\nFuse the new scans with the pre-treatment MRI and CT.\nContour any lesions on the scalp, calcifications in the brain, sinuses, and air volumes as no-pass zones so the transducers can avoid these specific areas.\nChoose the target on the axial T2 weighted image cutting through the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior commissure (PC).\n\tNOTE: There are different approaches to identifying and targeting the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. Given that the Vim is not visible even on 3T images, its location is deduced relative to known anatomic landmarks (i.e., indirect targeting).\n\t\nAt the level of the AC-PC line, begin at 25% of the intercommissural distance, anterior to PC. This is typically approximately 6 mm.\n\t\tNOTE: The average AC-PC distance in humans is 24 - 28 mm, and can range from 20 - 30 mm. Dividing the distance into quarters, one begins by defining the point that is ¼ the distance of the anterior-posterior distance, anterior to PC.\nLaterally, select a point midway between the point 14 mm lateral to midline and the point 11.5 mm lateral to the lateral edge of the ventricle at the level of the AC-PC plane.\nMake small adjustments according to the actual length and width of the specific patient's third ventricle and regional anatomy.",
    "NOTE: Third ventricular width can vary widely, especially in elderly patients. It is important to be mindful of internal capsule fibers when determining the laterality of the proposed target. An individualized approach, taking into consideration the patient's specific anatomy, is critical.\n5. Ultrasound Delivery\nProvide a stop button for the patient so they can abort energy delivery at any time.\nPerform a test sonication at low energy by raising the temperature in the target region to around 45 °C.\nVerify the alignment of the heating volume to the target and correct in all three dimensions\nRaise the temperature further to approximately 50 °C.\nAfter each sonication, perform a screening exam of motor power and sensation to light touch along with a test for the patient's tremor.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the patient may experience transient dizziness, tingling and/or numbness.\nAdjust the target (i.e., moving anterior if the patient reports parasthesias) according to the patient's responses before increasing the energy to make the permanent lesion around 55-60 oC.\nRepeat the sonication until the tremor is reduced to a satisfactory level.\n\tNOTE: 12 - 29 sonications each with a duration of 10 - 25 s are typically administered in increments of 0, 1, or 2 °C in an awake patient.\n6. Post-treatment\nImmediately after treatment, perform a T2-weighted MRI to assess for lesion size and associated radiologic findings such as edema.\nOnce satisfactory, take the patient out of the scanner and remove the frame.\nCheck pin sites for bleeding. A few minutes of pressure will usually stop this.\nPerform another neurologic exam (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: This exam is important to rule out any neurologic deficits such as paresthesia, weakness, speech or visual deficits.\nAdmit the patient to a post-surgical unit overnight for observation.",
    "Perform an MRI on day one post-treatment to confirm the presence of the lesion and rule out any adverse events.\nRequest assessment by a neurosurgeon if an adverse event (e.g., mass effect on imaging, intracranial hemorrhage, or decreased level of consciousness) is detected.\nDischarge the patient in the morning if they are doing well.\n7. Follow-up\nSchedule the patient for their first follow-up visit approximately 1 week after treatment.\nReview the patient's tremor symptoms, side effects, medication changes, and neurologic exam.\nPerform the CRST and quality of life measure to document and follow tremor and disability.\nDocument any adverse events including pin-site infection, motor deficits, sensory disturbances, and speech problems.\nRequest assessment of an adverse event by a physician, if necessary. Request a CT scan if the patient has a new neurological deficit to rule out intracranial etiology such as hemorrhage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
