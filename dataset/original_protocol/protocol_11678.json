    "Protocols involving the procurement, culture, and use of fertilized chicken eggs and unhatched embryos were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka.\n1. In ovo electroporation of chick auditory precursors\nsgRNA design and cloning for CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout\n\t\nFor creating gene knockouts, design guide RNAs to disrupt the exon regions of the gene, preferably closer to the 5' end of the coding region.\nSelect the potential guide RNAs using a web tool CRISPOR23. Set the browser data to Gallus gallus and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence to 5'- NGG -3'. The program determines guide RNAs from the input sequence and assigns different scores based on on-target and off-target activity. Select the top four guides for further studies.\nFor the designing of template specific oligos for guide (g)RNA production, remove the PAM sequence (5′- NGG -3′) from the gRNA design tool output. This is not needed for targeting, but contains the Cas9 cleavage recognition sequence. Synthesize two HPLC purified complementary oligos with BsmBI restriction site at both ends, for each potential gRNA.\nClone the guide sequence in frame with a tracrRNA scaffold of a vector of choice (here, pcU6_1sgRNA vector was used24).\nDissolve the sgRNA oligonucleotides at a concentration of 100 µM in DNase/RNase-free water. Perform annealing of the two sense and antisense oligo guides using a thermocycler with the following parameters: 95 °C for 3 min ,then 37 °C for 15 min, and then decrease to 4 °C.\nUsing standard molecular biology techniques as described in25, setup restriction digestion of the annealed oligos and pcU6_1sgRNA cloning vector with BsmBI enzyme overnight. Setup ligation with the gel-purified linear BsmBI-digested pcU6_1sgRNA vector and digested sgRNA oligos. Transform into a DH5-alpha competent cell and sequence confirm the obtained clone.\nEgg handling and windowing",
    "Procure freshly laid eggs and clean them by wiping them with 70% ethanol to prevent contamination. Incubate at 37-38 °C, with 45% humidity for 3.5-4 days.\nAfter incubation, place the egg on its side for at least 5 min before opening. This allows the embryo to reposition to the top of the yolk. Use forceps to make small holes at the top and blunt end of the egg such that a 21G needle can pass through.\nTo prevent damage during windowing, remove albumin to lower the embryo away from the shell. To do this, use a 5 mL syringe and a 21G needle to carefully draw 2 mL of albumin from a hole at the blunt end of the egg. Use clear tape to cover the hole at the blunt end.\nTo make the egg window, affix clear tape to the top of the eggshell. Cut open a window, around 2 cm long and 1.5 cm wide, using spring bow scissors and expose the embryo. Use forceps to open the chorionic membranes overlying the embryo, allowing access to the embryo.\nMicroinjecting plasmids\n\t\nFor the gene knockout experiment, prepare two solutions: the knock-down mix containing SpCas9 protein and guide plasmid - pcU6_1sgRNA, and the tracer plasmid mix of T2K-eGFP (this is a chick ß-actin promoter driving GFP cassette surrounded by the transposon sites of Tol2) together with the T2TP (the Tol2 transposase cloned in Tol2 construct26,27). The tracer is used to track electroporation efficiency.\nWhen electroporating multiple plasmids, ensure that the final concentration of DNA is at least 4 µg/µL. Mix the three constructs, guide plasmid - pcU6_1sgRNA, T2K-eGFP, and T2TP, in a 1:1:1 ratio with 1 µg of SpCas9 protein, 30% sucrose, and 0.1% Fast Green dye in a final volume of 10 µL.",
    "Pull needles for microinjection from standard glass capillaries (length 3 in, OD 1.0 mm) using a vertical pipette puller. Use fine forceps to break off the capillary tip after pulling to obtain a tip diameter of approximately 50 µm with a tapered end.\nLay the embryos at E3.5 on their left side with the head facing right. This way only the right otic vesicle is accessible for micro-injection. Micro-inject the knock-down mix into the otic vesicle. Inject around a 200 nL volume of DNA solution mix to fill the otic vesicle.\nDetermine the guide efficiency using a T7 endonuclease assay28.\nElectroporation\n\t\nAdd a few drops of 0.719% saline on top of the embryo prior to electroporation to lower the electric resistance and prevent overheating of the embryo.\nPlace the positive electrode through the hole made at the blunt side of the egg when the albumin was removed. Maneuver the electrode so that it is under the yolk. Place the negative electrode over the filled otocyst.\nUse electroporation to transfect plasmids into the cells of the embryo. Use a square pulse generator and apply five pulses of 25 V and 100 ms duration each, 50 ms apart. Determine the conditions empirically based on an individual electroporation setup.\nHydrate the embryo after electroporation by adding a few drops of 0.719% saline. To clean denatured albumin from the surface of the electrodes, thoroughly rinse it with distilled water. Reseal the egg with clear tape and return to the humidified incubator at 37-38 °C for further incubation.\n\t\t​NOTE: Embryos can be cultured until hatching after electroporation, however there is a steep reduction in viability.\n2. Basilar papilla dissection",
    "Use 70% ethanol to disinfect the surgical table, microscope stage, and surrounding area. Heat or alcohol sterilize microdissection equipment which include minimally spring-bow scissors, micro-curette, and two pairs of fine forceps.\nPrepare the following dissection plates: a glass Petri dish with a black silicon base, a 90 mm plastic Petri dish, and a 60 mm Petri dish. Chill either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for dissections.\nGently crack the egg into the 90 mm Petri dish. Identify the outer ear of the chick. Decapitate the embryo by cutting the neck just below the level of the lower jaw using scissors. Transfer the head to a 60 mm Petri dish filled with ice-cold PBS.\nOrient the embryo with the top of the beak facing toward the experimenter and hold the beak using one of the #5 forceps. Scoop out the eyes using the second #5 forceps. Going from rostral to caudal, cut the skull along its midline. Scoop out the brain.\nAdd more ice-cold PBS or HBSS and locate the two shiny structures, close to the level of the pinna. These are the otoliths of the lagena at the end of the cochlear duct and are found close to the midline.\nCut roughly between the two lagenas, and well above and below this region to isolate two inner ears. Under oblique lighting, visualize the outline of the inner ear. Remove extraneous tissue and the vestibule.\nTransfer the isolated cochlea to a black silicone base plate with ice cold PBS. Using #5 forceps, peel away the cartilaginous cochlear capsule to obtain the cochlear duct. Locate the undulated layer (tegmentum) of the cochlear duct and remove using #55 forceps to expose the BP. Using #55 forceps, remove the tectorial membrane to expose HCs and SCs.",
    "3. Culture of basilar papilla explants\nMembrane culture of the BP\n\t\nTake a six-well tissue culture plate and arrange one culture membrane insert per well.\nCollect the dissected basilar papilla (explant) in a 200 µL pipette with 1x HBSS buffer and transfer it onto a membrane. To prevent the tissue from sticking to the wall of the pipette, draw up some media before aspirating the tissue.\nOrient the explant such that the basilar papilla is facing upward, so that the hair and support cells are visible from the top29. Once the explant is positioned, aspirate the HBSS buffer slowly from the culture membrane surface. In this process, the explant will attach to the culture membrane.\nAdd 1.2 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) culture media between the membrane insert and the well wall to fill up the wells of the six-well plate. Up to six explants can be cultured on a single 30 mm culture membrane.\nCollagen culture of the cochlear duct\n\t\nPrepare collagen mixture by adding 400 µL of 3 mg/mL rat tail collagen, 50 µL of 10x DMEM, 30 µL of 7.5% NaHCO3, and 5 µL of HEPES in a tissue culture hood.\nTake a four-well plate and add three drops of collagen mixture into each well. Transfer dissected cochlear duct to each collagen drop. Incubate the plate for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to cure the collagen matrix.\nSmall molecule treatment of cultures\n\t\nPrepare culture media (DMEM, N-2 supplement, Penicillin) with either the pharmacological modulator or its solvent alone (for use as a control). Replace the culture media with 700 µL of media supplemented with the inhibitor. Culture the explants in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "Replace 50% of the culture media every day. After appropriate incubation time, remove the culture media and use the explants for downstream assays.\n4. Imaging and analysis\nImmunofluorescent analysis\n\t\nRemove culture media from wells and wash the explants twice with 1x HBSS. Using a pipette, add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to the well and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nRemove PFA and wash the explants three times with 1x PBS at room temperature. To collect the explants from the culture membrane, make a small cut around the membrane containing the piece of the tissue using small spring bow scissors and transfer the tissue along with the membrane to a 48-well culture plate using forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tissues are floating after the fixation, then aspirate with a 200 µL pipette and transfer it to 48-well plates for further processing. Avoid forceful detachment of the tissue from the membrane.\nFor collagen droplet culture, use forceps to transfer the entire collagen drop to a silicon plate. Add 200 µL of 1x PBS and remove collagen with the help of forceps, and then transfer the tissue to a 48-well culture plate.\nPermeabilize the explants with 1 mL of 1x PBS supplemented with 0.3% Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature. Incubate the explants with 200 µL of blocking buffer (10% goat serum + 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate the explants with 200 µL of primary antibody solution (1:300, in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Remove the primary antibody solution and wash the explants thoroughly 5 x 20 min with PBST.",
    "Incubate the explants with 200 µL of phalloidin and secondary antibody solution (in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Remove the phalloidin and secondary antibody solution and wash the explants thoroughly 5 x 20 min with PBST.\n\t\tNOTE: Secondary antibody concentration and wash length must be determined for each individual imaging application. For imaging using super resolution microscopy, we typically increase the concentration of the secondary antibody from 1:500 to 1:200 and increase the concentration of phalloidin from 1:400 to 1:200.\nIncubate the explants with a solution of DAPI (1:1000 in PBST) for 15 min at room temperature. Remove the DAPI solution and wash the explants 3 x 5 min with PBST.\nUse the mounting media to mount explants on a slide with BP facing in an upward direction (against the coverslip). For confocal imaging use antifade mounting media. Let the mounting media dry overnight at room temperature in the dark. Either image directly or store the slides at 4 °C until imaging.\nOTOTO fixation for SEM analysis\n\t\nPrepare all solutions fresh and handle according to local safety guidelines. Fix membrane-cultured explants (from step 4.1.4) in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) with 3 mM CaCl2. Perform fixation at 4 °C for 24 to 72 h with a change of fixative every 24 h.\nRemove the fixative and wash the tissue with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate 3 x 5 min at room temperature. Secondary fix with 1% OsO4 (diluted from a 4% OsO4 stock using 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Perform this and the subsequent steps until dehydration in a fume hood.",
    "Rinse using 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer 3 x 5 min at room temperature. Then rinse in double distilled or ultrapure water 3 x 5 min at room temperature.\nPrepare a 0.5% solution of thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) in ultrapure water. Stir at 75 °C for 10 min and filter the solution when it has cooled to room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: TCH is extremely hazardous. Usage must be approved by the local safety committee, and care must be taken when handling.\nRemove ultrapure water from the sample and add 0.5% TCH drop by drop. If the solution turns brown, stop and rinse the sample with ultrapure water, before carefully adding the 0.5% TCH solution. Once the solution is clear, replace it with 0.5% TCH. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min30,31.\nRinse the sample with ultrapure water 3 x 5 min at room temperature. Repeat steps 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.5 two more times ending with OsO4 incubation followed by rinsing.\nDehydrate the samples in an ethanol series to 100% anhydrous ethanol (EtOH). Incubate first in 25% ETOH for 10 min, then 50% ETOH for 10 min, 75% EtOH for 10 min, 95% ETOH for 10 min, before incubating for a total of 3x for 10 min each in 100% ETOH.\nPerform critical point drying using liquid CO2. Immediately mount the samples on a SEM stub with double-sided carbon adhesive tape. Proceed to sputter coat to provide 5-10 nm of coating. If not imaging immediately, store the samples in a desiccator under vacuum.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
