    "1. Mechanical Deformation of Single Cells\nFabrication of a PDMS Substrate with Embedded Fluorescent Beads\n\tPrior to fabrication of the substrate, fluorescent microspheres in water solution are resuspended in isopropanol to enhance bead mixing in the PDMS due to its hydrophobic nature.\n\t\nPipette 500 μl of fluorescent microspheres into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 16,200 x g for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 500 μl of isopropanol followed with 5 min of vortexing. Put the vial aside overnight in the dark in order to allow any large particles aggregates to sediment.\nThe next morning, carefully remove the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge vial. This bead solution can be used to fabricate more than 5 substrates. NOTE: The bead solution will continue to sediment for the next 3 days. Be careful to avoid resuspending the pellet.\nPour 0.5 g of the curing agent provided with the PDMS kit in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge vial using a scientific balance. By successive steps, add a total of 90 μl of beads (in six 15 μl additions), vortexing for 1 min between each addition. Set aside.\nWeigh 10 g of PDMS and mix for at least 12 min with the 0.5 g of the curing agent supplemented with fluorescent beads.\nFabricate an SU-8 2050 cross-shaped mold using standard photolithography techniques following manufacturer’s instructions. The mold used has a height of 320 μm and an area of 13.4 cm2 (Figure 3). The mold can contain 428 μl or 440 mg of PDMS.",
    "Pour 400 mg of the PDMS with beads in the cross-shaped mold using a transfer pipette and cure for 2 hr at 80 °C. After curing, peel off the substrate from the mold (Figure 5A). The substrate can be kept in a Petri dish at room temperature for 2 weeks without showing significant changes in its mechanical properties.\nPour droplets of PDMS (curing agent:PDMS with a ratio of 1:20) in a Petri dish with a final size of approximately 4 mm in diameter and cure them upside down for 2 hr at 80 °C (Figure 5B). These anchoring features can be kept in a Petri dish for weeks. NOTE: Maintain the dish upside down to prevent the drops from flattening during the curing process.\nAir-plasma treat (30 sec at 30 W) the substrate and 8 anchoring features. Bind the features on each end of the substrate at a distance of 4 mm from the square shaped indent present on the substrate (Figure 5C).\nMounting Membrane on the Clamps\n\t\nWrap each end of the substrate around the grooved cylindrical part of the clamps and secure it in place with the 2 setscrews from the top (Figure 2B and Figures 5D-E).\nScrew the 4 clamps on the clamp holder and pour PDMS (ratio 1:20) using a disposable transfer pipette at the interface between the substrate and the grooved cylindrical part of the clamps. Spread the uncured PDMS around the grooved cylindrical part using a 1.5 mm hex key.\nPour PDMS (1:20) in the grooves until completely filled by capillary action and cure the assembly at 80 °C for 2 hr (Figure 5F).\nSeeding Cells on the Membrane\n\t\nAir-plasma treat (30 sec at 30 W) the whole assembly to sterilize and functionalize the substrate to allow for collagen coating.",
    "Functionalize the area of the substrate where cells will be seeded with 1 ml of 0.02 M acetic acid supplemented with 16 μg/ml of rat-tail collagen at room temperature for 1 hr. The desired final collagen density is 5 μg/cm2.\nRinse the substrate 3x with phosphate buffer and let it dry at room temperature for at least for 10 min.\nAdd 40 μl of culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin containing 2,000 cells in the center portion of the substrate to cover an area of 1 cm2 (cell density: 20 cells/mm2). Cell density can be altered according to experimental requirements.\nPut the whole assembly in a standard cell culture incubator with the substrate facing up with the drop of culture medium containing cells on it. NOTE: The assembly must be kept with the substrate facing up for at least 3 hr to allow cells to firmly attach it. To prevent evaporation, 30 μl of warm culture medium is added into the drop on the substrate every 45 min for 3 hr.\nAfter 3 hr, flip the whole assembly into a Petri dish filled with fresh culture medium to submerge the substrate and incubate overnight to allow cells to proliferate.\nThe next day, prepare HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS; 20 mM of Hepes, 120 mM of NaCl, 5.3 mM of KCl, 0.8 mM of MgSO4, 1.8 mM of CaCl2, and 11.1 mM of dextrose). Adjust the pH to 7.4. NOTE: The HBSS solution has to be prepared daily and kept at 37 °C during the experiments. This physiological solution is used to maintain the cells on the microscope stage by mimicking the normal tissue/blood environment.",
    "Mount the set-up on inverted phase contrast or fluorescent microscope Mount the clamp-substrate assembly on the BAXS platform and motors. Fill the Petri dish inside the Petri dish heater with HEPES buffer (Figure 2D).\n2. Stiffness Measurement of Small Caliber Vessels\nPreparation\n\t\nKrebs physiological solution: Prepare a solution of 118.1 mM NaCl, 11.1 mM D-glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 2.5 mM CaCl2. Adjust the pH to 7.4 and oxygenate the solution with carbogen medical gas (95% O2/5% CO2) for 30 min. NOTE: The Krebs solution has to be prepared daily and kept at 37 °C during the experiments. This physiological solution is used to maintain the tissues alive by mimicking the normal tissue/blood environment.\nGather instrumentation for the dissection and mechanical assessment of aortic vessels: surgical scissors, bended tweezers, micro-scissors, surgical dissecting microscope, 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes, and 10 ml serological pipettes. The surgical and experiment procedure do not require any sterile conditions. Mount the clamps of the BAXS platform along with the load cell beforehand.\nTissue Isolation and Dissection\n\tAll experimental procedures involving laboratory animals have to be approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the users’ institution, which complies with the Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the users’ country.\n\t\nPerform mouse euthanasia with the inhalation of 99% CO2 (7 psi) in a Plexiglas chamber (Figure 6A).\nOpen mouse abdomen and cut the thoracic aorta to bleed the mouse.\nRemove the diaphragm, the thoracic cage and the lung lobes (Figure 6B). NOTE: To minimize the risk of damaging the tissue, keep the heart attached to the aorta and avoid touching the vessel directly but manipulate it using the heart.",
    "Remove the heart, the aortic root and the thoracic aorta by gently cutting between the vessel and the spine. NOTE: Do not induce any elongation in the vessel during the excision to keep the inner structure of the tissue intact (Figure 6C).\nImmediately immerse and keep the heart and aorta in Krebs solution.\nCut and carefully wash the aorta in Krebs solution to remove any blood clots. Remove connective tissue using micro-scissors, tweezers and surgical dissecting microscope (Figure 6D-E). NOTE: Keep all the vessel length and use the aortic root to determine the vessel orientation.\nVessel Dimension Determination and Mounting\n\tTo determine the stiffness of the vessel, the unloaded vessel dimensions are required and can be determined with a calibrated microscope.\n\t\nCut an aortic ring of about 2 mm in length and precisely measure its length using a calibrated microscope setting (Figures 6F-G). Put this segment aside in Krebs solution.\nCut another aortic ring as small as possible between each of the 2 mm segments (Figure 6F). Put this small segment on a microscope glass slide with the lumen facing up and measure the wall thickness using a calibrated microscope setting (Figure 6H).\nFill the Petri dish on the BAXS platform with Krebs solution and insert the 2 mm aorta ring segment on the pulling pins (inset in Figure 4C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51454/51454fig5highres.jpg",
