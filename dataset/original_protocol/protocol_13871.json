    "The experiments conducted in this study have been approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals for Teaching and Research (CULATR), The University of Hong Kong. Dry powder formulations prepared by spray freeze drying (SFD) containing 0.5% of luciferase messenger RNA (mRNA), 5% synthetic peptide PEG12KL4 and 94.5% of mannitol (w/w) are used in this study to demonstrate mRNA expression in the lung16. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of SFD powder is 2.4 μm. Spray dried (SD) mannitol powder are used to investigate the effect of air volume used in powder dispersion16. The MMAD of SD powder is 1.5 μm.\n1. Fabrication of dry powder insufflator and loading of dry powder\n(Optional) Neutralize the static charges of dry powder (in a vial) and the 200 µL non-filter round gel-loading pipette tip. Use an anti-static gun or a balance with deionizing function according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\nPrepare a weighing paper with a size of around 4 cm x 4 cm. Fold the paper in half diagonally and then unfold it.\nWeigh 1-2 mg of dry powder on the weighing paper.\nFill a gel-loading pipette tip with powder through the wider opening of the tip. Tap gently to pack the powder until the powder forms loose agglomerates near the narrow end of the tip (Figure 1A). Avoid packing the powder too tightly as it may hamper powder dispersion.\nConnect the powder-loaded tip to a 1 mL syringe through a three-way stopcock (Figure 1B). The size of syringe can be changed according to the volume of air used to disperse the powder. Hold the tip and syringe vertically during connection to prevent spillage of powder. If administration is not performed immediately, use parafilm to seal the openings of the tip and store it temporarily under suitable condition until administration.",
    "2. Fabrication of intubation device\nLight source (Figure 2)\n\t\nPrepare a custom-made light source with a light emitting diode (LED) torch and a flexible optical fiber with a diameter of 0.8-1 mm.\nMake a centered orifice on the clear lens of the LED torch with a hand drill or a drill bit so that the optical fiber can barely pass through.\nInsert the optical fiber through the orifice. Switch on the LED torch to adjust the position and the depth of insertion for maximum brightness at the other end of the optical fiber.\nAffix the optical fiber in position with clear epoxy glue.\nGuiding cannula (Figure 3)\n\t\nTake a 1 mL plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 3A) and hold the pipette at both ends.\nUse an alcohol lamp (or other heat sources in the laboratory such as a Bunsen burner) to heat the middle of the pipette by placing it at 5-10 cm above the flame (Figure 3B). Rotate the pipette to make sure it is heated evenly.\nWhen the plastic becomes soft and deformable, move the pipette away from the flame and stretch the pipette gently.\nCut the stretched pipette in the middle with a pair of scissor into Part A and Part B (Figure 3C-E). Use Part A as a fine tip pipette and Part B as a guiding cannula. To increase the chance of successful intubation with the guiding cannula, make a bevel (not too sharp which may increase the risk of injuring the animal) at the end of Part B (Figure 3F). When a 200 µL gel-loading pipette tip (for powder loading) is inserted into the guiding cannula, it should protrude the cannula by 1-2 mm.",
    "NOTE: A guiding cannula (Part B) with the appropriate dimension (internal and external diameter) for intubation could have a 21 gauge needle fit inside it while it can also fit inside a 17 gauge needle. Multiple attempts may be needed in stretching the pipettes to achieve the appropriate dimension.\n(Optional): Cut a small opening at the wider end of the guiding cannula to make it more flexible so that it is easier to hold the optical fiber (Figure 3F). This opening also allows the fitting of a microsprayer for the administration of liquid aerosol.\n3. Intubation\nAnaesthetize the mouse (BALB/c, 7-9 weeks) with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nPrepare a platform made of Plexiglass and mount it to a stand with a clamp (Figure 4A). Place the anaesthetized mouse on the platform (at around 60° of inclination) in a supine position. The height and angle of inclination of the platform could be adjusted by the position of the clamp on the stand.\nSuspend the mouse by hooking its incisors on a nylon floss (Figure 4B). Secure the position of the mouse by a piece of tape or a rubber band.\nInsert the optical fiber into the guiding cannula before intubation with the tip of the fiber level with the opening of the guiding cannula. Turn on the LED torch to illuminate.\nGently protrude the tongue of the mouse with a pair of forceps to expose its trachea.\nUse the other hand to hold the guiding cannula with optical fiber inside. Insert them through the oral cavity. With the illumination from the optical fiber, the opening of the trachea can be visualized as an orifice between the vocal cords.",
    "Align the bevel of the guiding cannula towards the midline of the opening (Figure 5A). Gently intubate the guiding cannula with optical fiber into the trachea by aiming the finest tip of the cannula at the tracheal opening.\nUpon intubation, swiftly remove the optical fiber and leave the guiding cannula inside the trachea (Figure 5B). A normal respiration should be observed.\nHold the fine tip pipette (Part A) at the opening of the guiding cannula and insufflate a small puff of air (about 0.2 mL) into the lung of the mouse. A slight inflation in the chest of the mouse indicates proper intubation. Remove the fine tip pipette prior to powder administration.\n4. Powder administration\nHold the powder loaded-tip that is connected to the syringe as described in step 1.5. Ensure the airflow between the syringe and the tip is disconnected.\nPull the syringe plunger backward to withdraw 0.6 mL of air.\n\tNOTE: The volume of air used to disperse the powder is dependent on the properties of the powder and the amount of powder loaded. This is further described in the result section.\nTurn the valve of the three-way stopcock to connect the airflow between the syringe and the powder-loaded tip.\nInsert the powder-loaded tip into the guiding cannula which has already been placed in the trachea of the mouse (Figure 5C). Hold the guiding cannula and push the syringe plunger forcefully in one continuous action to disperse the powder as aerosols into the lung.\n\tNOTE: Any forward motion of the device should be minimized to avoid injuring the animal.\nRemove the tip and check if the powder inside the tip has been emptied. If not, repeat step 4.1 to 4.4.\n\tNOTE: If the powder is packed too tightly due to excessive tapping, it might not be dispersed properly.",
    "Once the administration is complete, remove the guiding cannula from the trachea.\nAllow the mouse to recover by positioning it horizontally in a supine position with its tongue half protruded to avoid the blockade of the airways.\nSubscription Required.
