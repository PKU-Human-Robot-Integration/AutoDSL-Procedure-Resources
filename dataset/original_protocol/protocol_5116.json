    "Preparation of flag-affinity purified proteinsTransfect 3 μg each of pUNO RdRp-flag and pUNO ORF2-flag plasmids into ten 60 mm plates (each plasmid transfected into 10 plates, not cotransfected), containing Huh7 human hepatoma cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 in 1:1 ratio, following manufacturer’s instructions. Incubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. 24 h post-transfection, replace media with 2 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.48 h post transfection, wash the cells with 1x PBS and resuspend each dish in 800 μl IP buffer.Generate a homogenous suspension by repeated pipetting and vortexing, and incubate overnight (16 h) on ice at 4 °C (cold room or fridge).Next day, clarify the lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min and collect the supernatant into a fresh 1.6 ml RNase free microcentrifuge tube.Pool lysates of all ten plates and add 100 μl of flag agarose beads, incubate on rocker at 4 °C for 4 h, wash 3 x in 1 ml IP buffer each by centrifuging at 800 x g, 1 min, at 4 °C. Add 200 μl flag peptide (0.2 mg/ml in PBS) and incubate on a rocker for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 800 x g, 1 min, at 4 °C and collect the supernatant, which contains the eluted protein.Check an aliquot of the purified protein by Western blotting using octa-probe antibody and silver staining, as mentioned below.Resolve the proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE and transfer onto a PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane.",
    "Block the membrane using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBS for 45 min at room temperature, incubate overnight (16 h) with 1:1,000 octa-probe primary antibody diluted using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBST at 4 °C, wash 3 x in PBST, incubate with 1:5,000 anti-rabbit IgG HRPO secondary antibody diluted using 5% skimmed milk in 1x PBST at room temperature, followed by detection of the signal by enhanced chemiluminescence using ‘clarity Western ECL blotting substrate’. Acquire the Images and analyze using a gel documentation system. A single band of approximately 55 kDa should be obtained, as illustrated in Nair et al. (2016).For silver staining, resolve the proteins in 10% SDS-PAGE.Proceed for silver staining using silver stain kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A single band of approximately 55 kDa should be obtained as illustrated in Nair et al. (2016).If expected bands are obtained in Western and silver staining, estimate the respective protein concentration by serial dilutions by Bradford assay and store the protein in single use aliquots at -80 °C.Preparation of template for RdRp assayFuse HEV genomic regions 1-130 bases and 6,963-7,204 bases (from 5’-end) to each other by removing 131-6,962 bases from pSKHEV2 plasmid. Briefly, pSKHEV2 plasmid was digested with StuI, NheI and Tth111I restriction enzymes, followed by gel extraction of ~3.5 kb band. This fragment was treated with DNA polymerase I klenow fragment to generate blunt end, followed by self-ligation. Resulting plasmid is named as pSK HRt. Plasmid is available on request. This plasmid has been described in our earlier publication (Nair et al., 2016).Linearize 10 µg pSK HRt plasmid using 50 U BglII ( R0144L  , NEB, buffer 3.1) in 50 µl reaction mix (5 µl 10x buffer, 20 µl DNA, 2.5 µl enzyme and 22.5 µl water).",
    "Purify the linearized DNA using PCR purification kit. Use 1 µg linearized DNA for in vitro transcription using mMessage mMachine T7 Kit, following manufacturer’s instruction, to generate a 340 nucleotide long capped RNA, which is to be used as template in RdRp assay to monitor antisense strand synthesis.Verify the size and integrity of the RNA by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis.Quantify the RNA by spectrophotometry and store in single use aliquots in RNase free microcentrifuge tubes at -80 °C.RdRp assayAssemble the reaction as described below in RNase free tubes.table:",

    "Incubate at 22 °C for 2 h.Use appropriate negative controls such as RNA template without protein or RNA template with an unrelated protein (ORF2).Run one additional sample containing RNA template with RdRp and digest it with RNase A (add 1 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A to the tube, incubate at 37 °C for 10 min).Add 50 µl 2x proteinase K buffer and 1 µl proteinase K (50 mg/ml stock solution in water) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.Add 1 µl glycogen (10 mg/ml stock solution in water) and 1 ml of ice-cold absolute ethanol to the samples; incubate at -80 °C for 45 min.Centrifuge the samples at 14,000 x g, 15 min, 4 °C. Wash the pellet with 1 ml 75% ethanol and resuspend in 10 µl nuclease free water. Note: Be careful while removing the 75% ethanol, pellet may be lost. Although not necessarily a better alternative, it may be possible to minimize pellet loss by gently pipetting out 75% ethanol instead of directly decanting. Irrespective of whatever handling technique preferred, attention should be given not to disturb the pellet.Resolve the samples by 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis in a chemical fume hood.Formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis of RNA samplesFor 100 ml, add 0.75 g agarose in 72 ml DEPC-treated water in a conical flask and boil. When the solution has cooled to 55 °C, add 18 ml of 37% formaldehyde and 10 ml 10x MOPS. Cast the gel in gel running apparatus and allow to solidify.Note: Do not add formaldehyde and MOPS to very hot agarose solution. Perform the entire procedure in a chemical fume hood.Run the gel for 30 min prior to loading the samples.",
    "Mix 5 µl RNA, 3 µl 10x MOPS, 6 µl formaldehyde, 15 µl formamide and incubate at 85 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling on ice for 2 min. Add 2.5 µl of freshly prepared gel loading dye and load samples into the gel and run at 3-4 V/cm in 1x MOPS until the lower dye has migrated two third of the distance from the top.Run RNA molecular weight marker (Millennium marker, Ambion, USA) in parallel to monitor the size of the RdRp assay products. Excise the lane corresponding to the marker and stain with ethidium bromide (2 μl of 10 mg/ml stock in 50 ml running buffer) for 15 min to visualize the markers. Proceed with rest of the gel for transfer to nylon membrane.Transfer of RNA and detection of signalRinse the gel twice in 20x SSC buffer for 15 min each.Incubate the positively charged nylon membrane in DEPC-treated water until it is completely wet from beneath.Immerse the membrane in 10x SSC buffer for 5 min.In a glass tray, add 20x SSC buffer and put a glass plate on a glass jar. Spread a Whatman filter paper wick over the glass plate so that the tips are completely immersed in the buffer.Place the gel in inverted position. Make a notch on left side of the gel.Place the membrane on the gel without trapping air bubbles.Cover the sides of the gel with plastic wrap and remove air bubbles.Place a Whatman paper cut in the same size of the gel on top of the membrane.Place a stack of blotting paper cut in the same size of the gel on top of the Whatman paper.Put a glass plate on the stack and keep a 500 g weight support on top of it.Allow transfer overnight without disturbance.",
    "Next day, dismantle the transfer assembly and keep the membrane on a filter paper.Fix the RNA to the membrane by UV crosslinking (120 millijoules/cm2) for 1 min.Rinse the membrane briefly in DEPC-treated water.Rinse the membrane in washing buffer for 5 min at room temperature.Incubate the membrane in 20 ml of 1x blocking solution (see Recipes) for 30 min at room temperature.Note: Be careful not to allow the membrane to dry at any point from this step onwards.Incubate in 10 ml of anti-DIG antibody solution (1:10,000 in 1x blocking solution) for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody comes in the DIG Northern Starter Kit.Equilibrate in 100 ml detection buffer for 5 min at room temperature.Place the membrane on a development folder and apply CDP star (part of DIG Northern Starter Kit) and incubate for 5 min in the dark at room temperature.Note: Remove all air bubbles.Acquire chemiluminescent images using a gel documentation system or using an X ray film."
