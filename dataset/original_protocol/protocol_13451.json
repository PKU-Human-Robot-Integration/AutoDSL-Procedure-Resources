    "The present protocol complies with the guidelines of the Ethics committee of Padova University Hospital. SF was collected with patient consent from the knee joints of patients receiving therapeutic arthrocentesis for joint effusion at their initial presentation to the clinic or in response to an arthritic flare. Contraindications to the procedure were: coagulopathy, anticoagulant medications, skin lesions, dermatitis, or cellulitis overlying the joint. All SF samples were deidentified.\n1. Synovial fluid preparation\nTransfer the SF samples collected during arthrocentesis of swollen joints15 into a tube containing anticoagulant (preferably EDTA; see Table of Materials) and to a second tube containing no additive (Figure 1).\nIn suspected cases of infection, aseptically transfer a portion of the SF sample (~ 1 mL) into culture bottles for microbiological testing.\n\tNOTE: Infection can be suspected as a result of both clinical features (severe tumor, dolor, calor, functio laesa, and at times fever) and macroscopic appearance of the SF (turbidity, color). In this case, the physician prescribes a microbiological analysis, which is performed by a microbiology laboratory.\nCarry out SF analysis (steps 2-5) as soon as the sample is collected.\n2. Macroscopic examination\nNOTE: Macroscopic evaluation of SF samples consists of subjective, qualitative, and semiquantitative assessments. There are no reference standard scales, and no control samples are used.\nAnnotate the SF volume expressed in milliliters. Define the color of the sample, which can range from pale to dark yellow. Record the presence of blood.\nDefine the degree of clarity by observing the sample in the backlight and determining the ease of reading a printed page through the fluid tube (Figure 2A).\nAssess the viscosity by dripping the sample from a disposable pipette. A long string or drop formation indicates good or poor viscosity, respectively (Figure 2B).",
    "Assess the presence of particulate materials, including tissue fragments or fibrin, by observing the sample through the tube and in the backlight.\n3. Microscopic examination\nNOTE: The SF microscopic analysis consists of cytological examination, including total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts and the search for crystals.\nDetermine the total cell count following the steps below.\n\t\nDetermine the total number of leukocytes in the SF collected in the EDTA tube using a hemocytometer (see Table of Materials).\nDraw 0.5 µL of the SF from the EDTA tube using a Malassez-Potain pipette (mark 0.5; see Table of Materials) (Supplementary Figure 1). With the same pipette, draw 9.5 µL of 0.1% methylene blue solution (mark 11). The final dilution is 20-fold.\nMix the pipette by gentle inversion, discard the first drops, and pour the synovial fluid + methylene blue solution into the counting chamber.\nCount the cells in two consecutive squares out of nine, and multiply the obtained number by 100 (simplified formula; Supplementary Figure 2). Express WBCs as the number of leukocytes per cubic millimeter.\n\t\tNOTE: Simplified formula: Leukocytes (N/mm3) = the number of counted cells in two consecutive squares x 100.\nClassify the SF according to the total number of WBCs following previously published reports16,17 (Table 1).\nPerform differential cell count.\n\t\nDetermine the percentage of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes using supravital or traditional staining13,18.\nFor supravital staining, place one small drop of SF in the center of a ready-to-use slide pre-coated with cresyl violet and methylene blue (Supplementary Figure 3; see Table of Materials).\nCover with a coverslip, and place a drop of microscope immersion oil.",
    "Prepare an air-dried SF smear for traditional staining (less suitable for routine analysis). Put a small drop of SF at the end of a clean slide. Using a second slide or a coverslip, spread it along the slide with a forward movement. Let the smear air-dry.\nStain the sample according to a standard May-Grünwald-Giemsa procedure18.\nExamine the slide under the oil immersion objective (1,000x).\nCount 100 consecutive cells and distinguish between polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 4).\nExpress the total number in each category as a percentage.\n\t\t​NOTE: To obtain accurate results, cytological examinations must be performed as soon as the SF is collected or within 24-48 h of arthrocentesis when properly stored (4 °C).\n4. Crystal detection\nDetermine the presence of pathological crystals using a polarized light microscope equipped with an additional polarizing filter and a red compensator19 (see Table of Materials).\nPerform slide preparation for crystal detection.\n\t\nCarefully clean a glass slide with optical paper or soft paper imbibed with ethanol. Apply a small drop of SF on the glass slide.\nCover with a coverslip and place the slide under the microscope.\nIdentify the crystals.\n\t\nFocus the slide under the microscope using a low-power magnification objective. Carefully examine the slide under a bright field with a 40x objective. Look inside and outside the cells.\nIdentify the crystals according to their size and shape (e.g., rhomboidal, needle-shaped, rod-shaped).\nInsert the polarizing filter between the light source and the specimen. Rotate the polarizer until its optical axis is perpendicular to the analyzer (placed above the objectives) to create a dark background.\nOnce a birefringent crystal has been identified, insert the compensator between the polarizer and the specimen and move it parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis of the crystal.",
    "Observe the color revealed by the crystal (Table 2).\n\t\tNOTE: MSU crystals appear needle-shaped, brightly birefringent in the dark field, and display a yellow/orange color when their axis is parallel to the compensator. Conversely, they are blue when positioned perpendicular (negative sign) (Table 2; Figure 4). CPP crystals are rod- or rhomboid-like crystals, weakly birefringent under polarized light, and display a blue or yellow color when they are aligned parallel or perpendicular to the axis of the compensator (positive sign), respectively (Table 2; Figure 5).\n5. Alizarin red staining\nPrepare a 2% solution of alizarin red S (pH 4.1-4.3), filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter, and store it away from light.\n\t\nFor preparing the slide, mix a drop of SF with the same volume of alizarin red solution (1:1) on a clean slide. Cover with a coverslip and examine at 400x magnification.\nIdentify the crystals under the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The test is positive when bright, dark red precipitates are visible under transmitted light, with a round shape and concentric layers. Under polarized light, they appear strongly birefringent20 (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
