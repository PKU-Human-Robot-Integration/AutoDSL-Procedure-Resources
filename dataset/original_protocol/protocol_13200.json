  "procedures": [
    "The study was approved, and the patient was recruited from the Department of Infectious Diseases at Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, in Beijing, China. The patient underwent a routine abdominal Dixon MRI scan after providing informed consent. In this investigation, a 3D distribution modeling approach is employed to reconstruct the liver fat fraction (LFF) in a standard patient with medically diagnosed hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the study provides a quantitative assessment comparing the patient's liver with a healthy liver. The software tools utilized in this research are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation and data collection\nNOTE: The variance in parameters remains unaffected by the research approach. In this investigation, genuine DICOM data were obtained from clinical imaging. The data were acquired using a MRI apparatus with a field strength of 1.5 Tesla. The dataset comprises four distinct phases derived from the Dixon sequence, specifically In-phase, Out-of-phase, Water, and Fat.\nCheck the Dixon sequence for the upper abdomen.\n\t\nCopy all DICOM data to a customized working directory.\n\t\tNOTE: The working directory is the same in both the operating system and MATLAB.\nGo to the directory housing the data within MATLAB's current working directory (as shown in Figure 1).\nConfirm that the DIXON data displays a horizontal resolution of 520 pixels by 704 pixels, with a pixel spacing of 0.5682 mm and a slice thickness of 5 mm.\nQuickly check images of Dixon.\n\t\nChange the directory to access folders for different phases, which include In-phase, Out-phase, Water, and Fat phases, each stored in distinct folders for Dixon imaging.\nUtilize the Slice_View function to visualize the images for each phase.",
    "See Figure 2 to view an image of the MRI-Dixon sequence's interactive graphical user interface (GUI). Employ the scroll bar situated at the bottom of the GUI to efficiently navigate through the various sequences.\nEmploy the MRI-Dixon In-phase sequence to enhance descriptions of liver tissue boundaries.\n\t\tNOTE: In Figure 2, one can find icons located in the upper right corner of the GUI. These icons offer functions such as zooming out, zooming in, returning to the global view, and marking the coordinates of the selected pixel. Make use of the zoom feature to closely examine local lesion features.\nUse the Mark pixel coordinates feature to calculate the distance between two points, aiding in the measurement of nodule sizes.\nThe initial color bar uses the jet colormap, which signifies a color shift from blue to red, signifying low to high values respectively. To switch to the standard gray colormap and reset the entire GUI, right-click on the Color Bar and select the option from the pop-up menu.\nIf the default filter window is not suitable, adjust it by dragging up and down in the middle of the figure using the left mouse button to modify the window level. Dragging left and right adjusts the window width, and the precise filtering range will be shown on the color bar.\n\t\t​NOTE: Subsequent operations will focus on utilizing the DIXON In-phase sequence to represent the 3D region of the liver.\n2. Extracting the 3D region of the liver",
    "NOTE: To compute the Liver Fat Fraction (LFF), each voxel within the 3D liver region acts as a spatial carrier, with its fat fraction value obtained from MRI-Dixon data. Before calculating LFF, it's crucial to extract the 3D liver region. Although deep learning methods could achieve this more efficiently, the focus here is on using mature software tools like MIMICS for liver region extraction.\nOpen the MIMICS software and choose New Project. In the subsequent dialog box, locate the folder housing the DIXON Out-phase images. Continue by clicking on NEXT, and then hit Convert to enter the sequence-editing mode.\nGenerate an empty Mask by clicking on New within the MASK dialog box situated on the right-hand side, and opt for the maximum threshold.\nUse the Edit Masks tool located under the \"Segment\" label to delineate the liver area in all horizontal views.\nCreate a 3D spatial representation of the liver by choosing the liver mask depicted earlier and clicking on Calculate Part from Mask. The resulting 3D liver region will be presented (refer to Figure 3).\nNavigate to File, then select Export, and choose the DICOM option. In the pop-up dialog box, select the liver mask, specify the file path and names, and then click on OK to export the 3D liver region to the designated DICOM files.\n3. Generating Fat Fraction Map (FF-Map)\nNOTE: The fat fraction map (FF-Map) has a value range of 0-1. In this study, the FF of each voxel is calculated by dividing the voxel value of In-phase minus Water-only by that of In-phase using Dixon MRI.\nChange the directory to the folder of In-phase images and select the Volume_In function to generate the in-phase Volume.\nChange the directory to the folder of Water-only images and select the Volume_Water function to generate the water-only Volume.",
    "Select the FF_Volume function using the two Volumes generated in step 3.1 and step 3.2 as inputs to obtain the FF-Volume of the abdominal MRI, visualized as shown in Figure 4.\nThe Fat Fraction (FF) map shown in Figure 4 is presented as an RGB true-color image with a data structure of 520 by 704 by 44 matrix. In this representation, each pixel is composed of three values, representing the red, green, and blue channels. Take note of the color bar on the left side, which provides a visual reference for the fat fraction values associated with different colored pixels.\n\t​NOTE: The GUI shown in Figure 4 allows closer observation of the patient's liver through the zooming tool in the top right corner and obtaining the exact FF values using the probing tool. By dragging the scroll bar at the bottom, users can observe the FF-maps of all scanning positions in the horizontal plane.\n4. 3D-volume of liver fat fraction distribution\nNOTE: Figure 4 shows the LFF map calculated based on the Dixon MRI images of the upper abdomen. Combined with the 3D liver region in Figure 3, the 3D-LFF volume of the entire liver can be computed separately.\nUtilize the LFF_Volume function, providing it with the 3D liver region (as depicted in Figure 3) and the Liver stiffness map (shown in Figure 4) as input parameters. This will result in the creation of the 3D-Volume representation of the liver fat fraction, as illustrated in Figure 5.\nTo examine the stiffness map for each liver layer, simply use the scroll bar located beneath the GUI displayed in Figure 5.\n\tNOTE: In this view, only liver tissue is accurately depicted.",
    "Pay attention to the icons located in the upper right corner of the GUI (as shown in Figure 5). These icons provide functionalities for zooming out, zooming in, returning to the global view, and marking the coordinates of the selected pixel.\n\tNOTE: The default color bar utilizes the \"jet\" colormap, where colors transition from blue to red to represent varying values (measured in units of kPa) from low to high.\nRun the LFF_Distribution function using the identical input parameters as \"LFF_Volume\" to produce the spatial distribution of the 3D Liver Fat Fraction (3D-LFF), as depicted in Figure 6.\n5. 3D-LFF quantitative analysis\nNOTE: Normal liver voxels: LFF < 5%; Mild fatty liver voxels: 5%-10%; Moderate fatty liver voxels: 10%-20%; Severe fatty liver voxels: LFF ≥ 20%11,12,13,14,15. A key quantitative focus of this study is determining the proportion of voxels at different LFF stages in the patient's liver. Figure 6 demonstrates the uneven spatial distribution of liver fat fraction in the patient. The lack of distinct clinical symptoms is primarily attributed to a substantial proportion of normal liver tissue. Therefore, precise quantification of differences between patients and healthy individuals is imperative. This represents a vital quantitative concept herein.\nCalculate the 3D-LFF distribution for a healthy liver by repeating steps 1-4.\n\tNOTE: The built-in MATLAB bar function enables the comparison of the 3D-LFF distributions for healthy and fatty livers (Figure 7).\nSubscription Required.
