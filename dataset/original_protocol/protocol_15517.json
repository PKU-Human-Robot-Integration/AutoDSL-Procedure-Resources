    "Mice were obtained as an in-house breed from the local animal care facility or from Janvier Labs in France. The investigations were conducted according to the guidelines outlined in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. National Institutes of Health Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant institutional approvals (state government LANUV reference number AZ:84-02.04. 2016.A435).\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Solutions, and Equipment\nPrepare 1 L of phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 1 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and 0.1 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2) (PBSCM) and filter it through a sterile filter.\nPrepare 5 mL of sterile PBSCM per mouse for perfusion and place it on ice.\nFor each mouse, prepare 5 mL of sterile PBSCM supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL biotin.\nFor each mouse, prepare 5 mL of sterile PBSCM and add 0.8 x 108 magnetic beads (e.g., 200 µL of a 4 x 108 beads/mL solution, without pretreatment) for embolization of the glomeruli. Prepare this solution under the cell culture bench to keep the magnetic beads in the original tube sterile. Place this solution on ice.\nPrepare a quenching solution by adding 100 mM glycine to PBSCM (5 mL per mouse) and keep it on ice.\nMake a collagenase solution (0.378 U/mL collagenase A in sterile PBSCM). Per mouse, pipette 1 mL of the collagenase solution into a 2 mL tube and place it on ice.\nFor washing, prepare sterile PBSCM (see step 1.1) in a 50 mL tube and place it on ice.\nFor perfusion, use a syringe pump with a flow of 2.0 mL/min.",
    "Prepare a 10 mL syringe with a 21G needle. Place the tip of the needle in a 20-30 cm long catheter (inner diameter, ID = 0.58 mm). Connect the catheter (ID 0.58 mm) with a 10 cm short catheter (ID 0.28 mm) and cut the tip of the smaller catheter oblique for an easy insertion into the mouse aorta.\nFor ligature procedures during the surgery, cut three 5-7 cm silk threads (4-0 to 6-0) per mouse.\nFor the surgery, prepare 3 surgical clamps, 2 surgical scissors, 2 tweezers, 2 fine tweezers, 1 fine scissor, and swabs. Prepare the anesthesia (e.g., intraperitoneal anesthesia ketamine 100 mg/kg bodyweight and xylazine 5 mg/kg bodyweight).\nFor isolation of the glomeruli of two kidneys, use a 100 µm cell strainer, two 50 ml tubes, and a magnet catcher.\nPrepare CHAPS lysis buffer: 20 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS); 20 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethan (Tris) pH 7.5; 50 mM sodiumchorlide (NaCl); 50 mM sodiumfluoride (NaF); 15 mM Na4P2O7; 0.1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pH 8.0; 2 mM sodiumorthovanadate; and 2 mM adenosinetriphosphat (ATP).\nCool centrifuges to 4 °C.\n2. Surgery Under the Microscope\nAnesthetize the mouse (e.g., with ketamine/xylazine intraperitoneally, see step 1.11). Perform the toe-pinch test to confirm proper anesthesia.\nDisinfect the ventral side of the mouse with 70% isopropanol.\nPerform a median cut through the skin from the pelvis to the sternum and remove the skin from the abdominal fascia using tweezers. Cut the skin on both sides in the middle of the abdomen with surgical scissors.\nChange surgical tools. Apply a median cut from xiphoid to the bladder through the abdominal muscle layer and divide them into four quadrants using tweezers and surgical scissors. Attach the upper two aside with clamps toward the neck of the mouse with two surgical clamps.\n\tNOTE: The abdomen is now opened.",
    "Put visceral organs aside with a sterile swab and cut the hepatic-phrenic ligament with fine scissors.\nPrepare a ligation (with a silk thread 4-0 to 6-0) around the aorta proximal of the renal arteries on the height of the adrenal gland with two fine tweezers. Tighten the proximal aortic ligation to abolish blood flow with tweezers.\nFree the distal aorta from fascia, fat, and other tissues and prepare a ligation around the hepatic/mesenteric artery cranial of the renal arteries using fine surgical tweezers.\nPrepare a ligation (with a silk thread 4-0 to 6-0) around the aorta distal of the renal arteries and clamp the vena cava and aorta at the height of the bifurcation.\nCut a small hole into the aorta distal to the renal arteries so that the hole is half the diameter of the aorta. Put the catheter into the aorta and fix it with the prepared ligature.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid bubbles in the perfusion system to prevent air embolism.\nStart perfusion with the ice-cold PBSCM at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.\nCut a hole into the renal vein at the level of the renal arteries with fine surgical scissors and tighten the ligation around the hepatic and mesenteric arteries.\n\tNOTE: Kidneys should turn pale after starting the perfusion.\n3. In Vivo Biotinylation\nChange the syringe bubble-free to ice-cold PBSCM supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL biotin for surface labelling, and perfuse kidneys with 5 mL at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.",
    "NOTE: Mix the PBSCM solutions (e.g., by turning the 50 mL tubes) gently to avoid forming bubbles within the solution. After aspiration of the solution within the syringe, evacuate any bubbles or air from the syringe. Use an extra cannula (21G) on the syringe to fill the space in the cannula that is connected to the catheter system. Finally, stick the syringe into the cannula with the catheter without bubbles.\nChange the syringe bubble-free to ice-cold PBSCM supplemented with 100 mM glycine to quench the glomeruli and perfuse with 5 mL at a flow of 2 mL/min.\nChange the syringe bubble-free to ice-cold PBSCM supplemented with 200 μL magnetic beads/mL and perfuse kidneys at 2 mL/min.\n\tNOTE: On the kidney surface, embolization of glomeruli with brown magnetic beads will be visible.\n4. Isolation of Glomeruli from Two Kidneys\nRemove kidneys at the hilum and remove the capsule. Place the kidneys on ice in 15 mL of PBSCM in a 10 cm cell culture dish. Euthanize the mouse with cervical dislocation under anesthesia after harvesting the kidneys. The surgery and perfusion procedures last approximately 20-22 min.\nCut kidneys into the smallest pieces possible with a new double-edge blade. Move the tissue into a 2 mL tube with 1 mL of collagenase A (see step 1.6) and digest at 37 °C for 30 min. Before and after digestion, mix gently with a 1000 μL cut pipette.\nRinse the digested tissue through a 100 μm cell strainer using ice-cold PBSCM. Gently use the cell-scraper to mince the remaining tissue trough the cell strainer and rinse it with ice-cold PBSCM afterwards to a total volume of 50 mL.",
    "Centrifuge the suspension at 4 °C 500 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with slightly less than 1.5 mL of ice-cold PBSCM while vortexing the pellet. Afterwards, put the glomerular suspension into a new 2 mL tube.\n5. Washing\nUse the magnet catcher to pull the glomeruli to one side. Wait for 1 min before the glomeruli have moved toward the magnet.\nRemove the supernatant with a 1000 μL pipette while the 2 mL tube remains in the magnet catcher. During the first and second washing steps (see step 5.3), 250 μL of supernatant remains in the tube to avoid the loss of glomeruli. Perform this procedure quickly to avoid letting tubular structures sink to the bottom of the tube.\n\tNOTE: The washing procedure will last longer otherwise.\nRemove the 2 mL tube from magnet catcher and add 1 mL of PBSCM, pipette up and down (very important), then vortex.\nPut the tube back into the magnet catcher and start over with step 5.2.\nRepeat the washing steps until the purity of glomeruli has reached 90%. For this, examine a representative aliquot of the supernatant under a microscope (40-100X).\n\tNOTE: Glomeruli will appear as round structures containing brown magnetic beads. Elongated structures are tubular fragments, and free magnetic beads appear as brown round dots. Cell debris might appear as bulky structures.\nIf purity is reached, estimate the count of glomeruli by dissolving the glomeruli in 1 mL of PBSCM. After mixing, take an aliquot of 10 μL and count the glomeruli under the microscope. Calculate the number of glomeruli with the following equation: final number of glomeruli = number of glomeruli in 10 μL aliquot x 100.\nSuccessful isolation of glomeruli leads to a range of 10,000-40,000 glomeruli.\n6. Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation (IP)",
    "Collect glomeruli by centrifugation at 4 °C at 6800 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant while using a magnet catcher and resuspend the pellet in ice-cold lysis buffer (e.g., 30,000 glomeruli in 300 μL; CHAPS, see step 1.11). Homogenize the samples with a tissue homogenizer at the highest speed for 30 s and lyse them on ice for 30 min.\nRemove insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 30 min for 4 °C. Pipette the supernatant which includes the cell lysate into a new 1.5 mL tube. Discard the pellet.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the supernatant by using a bicinchoninic (BCA)-based method following the manufacturer's instructions. A successful lysis of 30,000 glomeruli yields to a glomerular protein amount of 700-1,000 µg/mL. Adjust to equal protein amounts with lysis buffer.\nTake an aliquot of 10% of the total volume for glomerular lysate and add 2x Laemmli + dithiothreithol (DTT) before incubation for 5 min at 95 °C.\nFor IP, incubate the rest of the lysate with streptavidin agarose beads overnight at 4 °C on an overhead shaker.\nCentrifuge agarose beads at 1000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant, and add 800 μL of lysis buffer to wash the beads for unspecific protein binding.\nRepeat the wash 3 times, and remove the supernatant completely.\nAdd 30 μL of 2x Laemmli + DTT and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min.\nLoad the lysate and IP probes on a 10% SDS gel and run the SDS gel at 70 V for 30 min, then at 20 mA per gel for 1.5 h. Afterwards, blot the gel for 2 h at 200 mA on a nitrocellulose membrane.\nBlock the nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in washing buffer.",
    "Incubate the membrane with the antibody of interest overnight at 4 °C. Wash with washing buffer 3 times for 5 min on a shaker and incubate the membrane with the HRP-tagged secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Repeat the washing step.\nVisualize the lysate and immunoprecipitation probes on the membrane by using a super-resolution chemiluminescent agent with a CCD camera.\nSubscription Required.
