    "1. Lab-scale malachite green assay\nPreparation of assay buffer\n\t\nPrepare the assay buffer, as per the composition and preparation presented in Table 1.\nPreparation of phosphate standards\n\t\nUse 1 mM phosphate standard, provided in the malachite green assay phosphate assay kit (stored at 4 °C).\nPipette 40 µL of 1 mM phosphate standard in 960 µL of ultra-pure water to obtain 40 µM phosphate solution (premix solution). Add the premix solution with ultra-pure water, as per manufacturer's instructions, to form a serial dilution of phosphate from 0 to 40 µM.\nPreparation of yeast Hsp90\n\t\nUse yeast Hsp90 with a glycerol stock concentration of 0.66 mg/mL. Thaw on ice just before use.\nUse 8 µL (5.98 µg, 0.80 µM) of yeast Hsp90 for measurable ATPase activity. Check that the optical density difference after the addition of malachite green reagent between the blank and positive control is at least 0.5 and less than 1.0. Here, the absorbance difference between the blank (without Hsp90) and positive control (with Hsp90) was found to be 0.510.\nPreparation of ATP\n\t\nTransfer 1 mg of ATP to a vial containing 453.39 µL of ultra-pure water to obtain 4 mM of stock solution. Perform weight calculations based on anhydrous ATP (molecular weight [m.w.] = 551.14). Prepare ATP fresh, as it can spontaneously hydrolyze over time.\nAdd 4 µL of ATP stock solution to each well to give a final well concentration of 0.2 mM (final total assay well volume of 80 µL). Add ATP as the last component to the reaction, using a multichannel pipette so that all the reactions start simultaneously.\nPreparation of geldanamycin (GA)",
    "Prepare a 10 mM stock of GA by dissolving 1 mg in 178.37 µL of DMSO (m.w. = 560.64). Using the stock solution, prepare 4 mM, 0.8 mM, 0.16 mM, 0.032 mM, 0.0064 mM, and 0.00128 mM solution in DMSO by serial dilution.\nAdd 2 µL of these stock solutions to each well to obtain a final well concentration of 0.1 mM, 0.02 mM, 0.004 mM, 0.0008 mM, 0.00016 mM, and 0.000032 mM, respectively.\nPrepare the wells as described in Table 2 and Table 3, with the wells containing the blank (buffer + water + DMSO) and negative control (Hsp90 in buffer + water + DMSO). The wells containing GA (Hsp90 in buffer + water + GA) serve as the positive control.\nPreparation of well plates and order of addition\n\t\nPrepare 96-well plates with the layout presented in Table 2. For compounds that show absorbance at 620 nm, prepare a separate well for recording the absorbance at this wavelength. Do not prepare a separate well for GA, as GA does not show absorbance at 620 nm for the concentration used in the assay.\nPrepare each constituent with the total volume of each constituent, as presented in Table 3.\nSet up assay wells by adding ultra-pure water to each well. Following this, add the required amount of assay buffer and a compound solution (for example, GA solution).\nThen, add Hsp90 to the appropriate wells, and shake the plates for 2 min on a plate shaker at room temperature.\nAdd 4 µL of ATP solution using a multi-channel pipette. Wrap the plate in aluminum foil and shake for 2 min on a plate shaker (200 rpm) at room temperature. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 3 h.\nPreparation and addition of malachite green reagent",
    "The malachite green reagent consists of reagents A (ammonium molybdate in 3M HCl) and B (malachite green and polyvinyl alcohol). Bring the reagent to room temperature before use. Mix reagents A and B at a 100:1 ratio (1,000 µL:10 µL). Prepare this within 3 h before use, since it is unstable and starts decomposing after 3 h.\nAfter 3 h of step 1.6.5, stop the reaction by adding 20 µL of malachite green reagent, added in the same order as ATP, using a multi-channel pipette.\nAfter a 15 min incubation at room temperature, measure the absorbance of the plate at 620 nm in a plate reader.\n2. High-throughput screening of Hsp90 inhibitors by malachite green assay\nNOTE: The protocol for high-throughput screening is similar to the lab-scale methodology. The final well volume in each case is 80 µL. However, there is a slight difference in the order of the addition of reagents. In the lab-scale based method, there are five stages of solution addition (34 µL of water, 32 µL of buffer, 2 µL compound in DMSO, 8 µL of Hsp90, and finally 4 µL of ATP solution). In contrast, with HTS there are three stages of addition (40 µL of buffer solution containing yeast Hsp90, 2 µL of DMSO in 18 µL of water containing the compounds, and finally 20 µL of ATP dissolved in water). The minimum amount of solution that can be pipetted accurately in the HTS setup is 20 µL. Hence, a difference in pipetting between lab and HTS scales is observed.\nPreparation of assay buffer (pH 7.4)\n\t\nUse the same buffer in HTS as for the lab-scale malachite green assay (Table 1).\nPreparation of yeast Hsp90\n\t\nUse protein with a glycerol stock concentration of 0.66 mg/mL. Thaw on ice just before use.",
    "Use 8 µL (5.98 µg, 0.80 µM) of yeast Hsp90 in each well, which provides measurable ATPase activity.\nDilute the protein (8 µL) in buffer (32 µL) for each well. The final total working volume for each well is 40 µL in a total assay volume of 80 µL.\nPreparation of 0.8 mM ATP\n\t\nDissolve 1 mg of ATP in 2,267 µL of distilled water to obtain a 0.8 mM solution. The total working volume for each well is 20 µL in a total assay volume of 80 µL.\nPreparation of geldanamycin (GA)/test compounds\n\t\nPrepare a 0.8 mM stock of GA in DMSO, as in step 1.5. Dilute 10 µL of the GA stock with 90 µL of water to give a final concentration of 80 µM.\nUse 20 µL of the 80 µM GA solution in appropriate assay wells (final total assay well volume = 80 µL), giving a final well concentration of 20 µM. This serves as a positive control.\nFor test compounds, prepare solutions in DMSO as per their desired concentration for evaluation.\nPrepare 10 µL of DMSO in 90 µL of water for addition to blank (buffer + water + DMSO) and negative control wells (Hsp90 in buffer + water + DMSO). Prepare the test compounds in a similar fashion at a 100 µM final well concentration.\nDesign of assay plates and order of addition\n\t\nUse four main plates, one compound plate, and four addition plates containing stocks of reagents to set up the assay (Figure 2 and Table 4).",
    "In addition, plate A, add 90 µL of assay buffer in each well; in addition plate B, add 90 µL of buffer with Hsp90 in each well; in addition plates C and D, add 90 µL of ATP and 90 µL of malachite green reagent, respectively, in each well (Table 5 and Table 6).\nFrom addition plate A and plate B, transfer 40 µL of solution from each well to main plate 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, respectively, using an automated multichannel dispensing system. Here, the Biomek(R) FXP laboratory automation workstation was used (Figure 2 and Table 6).\nFrom each well of the compound plate, transfer 20 µL of the solution to main plates 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 2). Shake the plates for 1 min in a shaker (200 rpm).\nFrom each well of the addition plate C (ATP), transfer 20 µL of solution to main plates 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 2). Shake the plates for 1 min in a shaker (200 rpm).\nIncubate the plates for 3 h at 37 °C.\nPrepare the malachite green reagent as per step 1.7. After 3 h, transfer 20 µL of malachite green reagent from addition plate D into the wells of main plates 1 ,2, 3 and 4 (Figure 2).\nAfter a 15 min incubation at room temperature, measure the absorbance of the plate is at 620 nm in a plate reader.\nSubscription Required.
