  "procedures": [
    "1. Maintaining a Source of R. reniformis Inoculum\nFill terra cotta clay pots (15 cm in diameter, 13.5 cm in height) with a steam pasteurized mix of 1-part sandy loam and 2-parts sand. Plant a susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) variety in each pot and place the pots in a glasshouse.\n\tNOTE: Other susceptible plant varieties such as cotton can be used instead of tomato.\nInoculate the tomato plants with vermiform reniform nematodes (see step 3.3). Maintain the plants in the glasshouse at a temperature of approximately 28 °C.\n2. Planting Cotton Genotypes for R. reniformis Resistance Evaluation\nPrepare soil by combining 2-parts fine sand with 1-part sandy loam collected from the field.\nSteam pasteurize the soil mixture to ensure that the soil is free of nematodes and soil-borne plant pathogens.\nAdd the soil mixture to conical plastic pots (4 cm in diameter, 21 cm in height). Prior to filling the pots, place a ball of cotton in the bottom of the pot to prevent soil loss. Partially fill the pots with soil approximately 2 cm from the top.\nPrepare a plastic stake for each pot to designate the genotype to be planted.\nPlant seeds of the cotton genotypes selected for evaluation.\n\t\nPlant a single seed in each pot for the evaluation of segregating populations, in which each seed represents a unique genotype.\nFor cotton varieties or germplasm accessions, plant 2 to 3 seeds in a single pot to insure germination of at least one plant with the other seedlings removed from the pots prior to nematode inoculation.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, seeds can be germinated for 24 to 72 h prior to planting to minimize the number of pots with non-viable seeds.\nPlant seeds of selected resistant and susceptible control genotypes.",
    "Note: Control genotypes are replicated 5 to 10 times to assess natural variations inherent to the screening methodology.\nFill pots with additional soil to cover the seed in each pot.\nPlace the pots in the growth chamber. Maintain a constant temperature of 28 °C, an ambient air temperature, for the growth chamber. Provide artificial lighting with a mixture of fluorescent and incandescent lamps with a 16 h photoperiod.\nPlace water emitters in each pot, and water the pots twice per day using an automatic watering system. Adjust the watering system to supply additional water as the plant grows.\n3. Nematode Inoculation of Cotton Plants and Preparation of Root Samples\nExtract vermiform reniform nematodes maintained on susceptible tomato plants (see step 1) using elutriation19 and centrifugal flotation20 methodologies the day before inoculation. Store the extracted nematodes at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Baermann funnel extraction21 is an alternate method for nematode extraction.\nDetermine the number of nematodes extracted by counting the number of nematodes in a 100 µL subsample and prepare a suspension of 1,000 nematodes/mL in tap water for inoculations.\nInoculate the cotton seedlings 7 d after planting with the nematode suspension. Create a small depression in the soil next to the plant, and pipette 1 mL of the reniform nematode suspension into the depression.\nRemove plants from the pots 28 d after inoculation for nematode evaluation.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, plants are approximately 15 cm tall with 4 to 6 fully expanded leaves.\n\t\nRemove most of the fully expanded leaves from the plants using scissors prior to removing the plants from the pots.\nTo remove plants from the pots, squeeze the pot and slide the soil out into the hand.",
    "Gently remove the soil from the roots by agitating the root system in tap water in a 10 L container. Briefly rinse the root system in a container of clean tap water.\nRemove the root system from the plant approximately 1 cm below the soil line using scissors.\nPlace the root system into a 120 mL plastic, non-sterile, disposable specimen container along with the plastic stake from the pot used for identification.\n\tNOTE: Multiple samples are processed before proceeding to step 3.7. Proceed to step 4 for the vegetative propagation of the plant shoot.\nPrepare a 12.5% (v/v) solution of red food coloring17 in tap water to stain the nematodes attached to the root system.\nAdd approximately 30 mL of the red food coloring solution to the root sample in the specimen container to completely cover the root system.\nPlace the specimen container in a microwave oven and heat the root sample until the staining solution starts to boil. Remove the sample from the microwave oven and allow the sample to cool at room temperature.\nDecant the red food coloring solution from the root sample and add approximately 100 mL of tap water to the specimen container to remove excess stain. Place the cover on the specimen container and store the sample in a refrigerator at 4 °C. Proceed to step 5 for evaluation of root infection.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here before proceeding to step 5.\n4. Vegetative Propagation to Recover Plants for Seed Production",
    "Place a ball of cotton in the bottom of a conical plastic pot (see step 2.3) and partially fill the pot with peat moss potting media. Then, place the vegetative shoot in the pot and firmly add potting media to fill the pot. Place a new labeled plastic stake in each pot to designate the cotton genotype.\nPlace the tray of pots in a plastic container (73.6 cm length x 45.7 cm width x 15.2 cm height) with water and briefly water the plants to moisten the potting media. Place the pots in a growth chamber with a constant temperature of 28 °C using a 16 h photoperiod. Add additional water to the plastic container as needed to maintain soil moisture.\nTransplant the plants to larger pots for seed production after approximately 30 d. Partially fill a 6 L plastic pot with potting media (see step 4.1), remove the plant from the small pot, place the plant into the 6 L pot, and firmly add potting media to fill the pot.\nPlace the plants in a glasshouse and add water to moisten the potting media. Maintain the temperature in the glasshouse at approximately 28 °C (artificial lighting is not required).\n\t\nWater plants by hand as needed for approximately 30 d.\nWhen approximately 75% of the plants require daily watering, water plants daily using an automatic watering system. Adjust the automatic watering system to water more frequently as needed for plant growth.\nAdd approximately 10 g of a slow-release fertilizer to each pot prior to the start of floral initiation.\nHarvest plants at maturity and process the cotton seed samples to obtain seeds for further evaluation.",
    "To harvest cotton seeds, remove the cotton from the open bolls on the plant by hand and place it in a labeled paper bag. The seeds are attached to the cotton fibers, which are removed in the following steps.\nRemove lint fibers from the seed samples using a 10-saw laboratory gin.\nRemove fuzz fibers from the seed samples using concentrated sulfuric acid. Neutralize seed samples in a 15% (v/v) solution of sodium carbonate, rinse the samples with tap water, and dry the samples in a forced air drier.\nPlace the seed samples in labeled envelopes for storage.\n5. Evaluation of R. reniformis Root Infection\nRemove the root sample from the specimen container and count the number of female nematodes attached to the root system using a stereomicroscope (20X magnification).\n\tNOTE: Only female reniform nematodes are capable of infecting plant roots.\nPlace the root system on paper towels for approximately 10 min to remove excess moisture. Weigh the root system to determine the fresh root weight.\nEnter the nematode count and fresh root weight data into a computer spreadsheet program and calculate the number of females per gram of root.\nSubscription Required.
