    "All methods described here have been approved by the School of Psychology Ethics Committee of the University of East Anglia.\n1. Preparation\nAdvertise the experiment as a memory experiment; it is important for the language production version that language is never mentioned as the dependent variable.\nInform all participants in accordance with ethical guidelines, and let them sign a consent form confirming they agree to take part under the following presumptions:\n\t\nPresume that participants understand the information provided.\nPresume that participants had the chance to ask questions about the experiment and had these answered satisfactorily.\nPresume that participants know their participation is voluntary and that they are allowed to withdraw at any time, without giving any reason and without it affecting them in any way.\nPresume that participants know that no personal information (such as a name) will be shared outside of the research team or published in the final report(s) from the research.\nMaterials\n\t\nCover a standard height table (L = 325 cm, W = 90 cm) with a single-colored tablecloth to prevent any marks on the table from being a spatial marker for participants. The length of the table may be varied as a function of the distances to be tested.\nMark locations, spaced equidistantly on a location-stick, placed along a midline from the participant (who sits at a short end of the table, See Figure 1). Place the objects on the near edge of the location marks, so that there is no variation in the exact location of the placed objects.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of marked locations and their distances may be varied as a function of the tested parameters. In the video we use 12 locations, with a distance of 25 cm between them.",
    "Print different colored shapes and place them in plastic discs (6.5 cm in diameter), thus controlling for object properties. Other objects can be used, dependent on the hypotheses to be tested; for example in one experiment manipulating ownership coins owned by either the participant or experimenter were used (See Figure 5).\nCover the space around the table with curtains, in order to eliminate any distance cue from the room.\nCover one of the long sides of the table with a curtain [see Figure 4]. In the memory version (section 3.2) of the procedure, the experimenter is behind this curtain while the participant indicates where s/he remembers that the object was. This ensures the participant cannot see the experimenter, preventing any non-verbal cues as to the accuracy of the participants' response. In turn, the experimenter cannot see the table, thus eliminating any confounds in moving the indication stick.\nPlace a measuring tape on the table on the experimenters' side of the curtain, out of sight of the participants, in order to record the recalled location in the memory version (section 3.2).\nTo avoid being influenced by the tape measure during the participants' instructions, have the experimenter focus only on moving the stick at a constant speed. This way, the experimenter does not have information on accuracy while moving the indication stick. When the participant states that the near edge of the indication stick matches the near end of the object, use the measuring tape to note the recalled location of the object.\nParticipants\n\t\nMake sure participants are native speakers of the tested language, and (ideally) do not speak another native language. (Of course, the memory game can be used for bilingual studies/testing other populations if desired.)",
    "Ensure participants have a depth perception of at least 40\" (arcseconds), which can be measured with depth perception tests (e.g., Randot Stereopsis test; see table of materials).\n2. Procedure\nNOTE: Some details of the setup depicted in the video differ slightly from the manuscript. For example, the location—stick looks somewhat off centre (especially when turned over), the position of the experimenter next to the participant, and the lighting conditions (resulting in shadows), were adjusted for videographic reasons. This should be avoided during testing, to avoid confounding visual cues. Follow the details in paper when replicating.\nSeat the participant as close as comfortable to the short side of the table (but without actually touching it).\nInstruct the participant to try and maintain their position throughout the experiment.\nTell the participant which objects and which locations will be used during the experiment.\nPresent the participant with six practice trials, using the 6 different objects and locations, so that any uncertainties about the procedure are noticed and explained.\nInstruct participants following the instruction transcript (Supplementary File).\nAdjust the procedure to specific testing needs. For example, different parameters can be manipulated or fewer trials can be used to keep to a specific timeframe (see section 3.3).\nAt the end of the task, ask participants what they thought of the experiment, and specicially what they thought the experiment was testing. This is particularly important for the language version where participants need to be eliminated from the analyses should they report that their demonstrative choice was being tested.\n3. Variants\nLanguage version\n\tNOTE: The language version of the memory game assesses how spatial language is used to verbalize spatial situations.",
    "First instruct participants that they are taking part in an experiment testing the influence of language on spatial memory (so that participants do not realize that their demonstrative use is being measured). Tell participants that the experiment is testing the influence of language on memory for object location, and that they are taking part in the 'language condition' (with other people - not actually tested - in the 'no language' condition). Instruct participants to use three words: [a demonstrative], [the color of the object], [the shape of the object] (e.g., this/that black cross), in order to make this as similar as possible for all participants.\nOn each trial, the experimenter will instruct the placement of an object (e.g., \"I/ You place the [object] on the [location]\"). The agent (who places) condition is one of the experimentally controlled parameters.\nPresent an example trial in which the experimenter places the object and shows what a trial looks like, for example: \"I place the [object] on the [location].\"\nCreate multiple trial lists, randomizing the order of trials while ensuring no object or location is used in two successive trials. This prevents trial order effects and carry-over effects from trial to trial.\nAfter the object placement, when both experimenter and participant are seated, have the participant use body language (only to point at the object, but not touch it) and verbal language to name the object.\nInstruct the participant to name the object, only using three words: [demonstrative], [object color], [object name] (e.g., \"this blue heart\").\n\t\tNOTE: The participant does not name the location. Participants are informed that they must use only three words so that the 'language condition' participants are all using the same amount of language to potentially affect memory.",
    "As an experimenter, record which demonstrative term the participant uses to refer to the object. (From the partcipant's perspective, it appears that the experimenter is marking off completed trials.)\nAfter the participant names the object, remove the object and proceed with the instruction for the next trial.\nMaintain the 'memory game' cover of the language version of the experiment, by asking the participant to recall the most recent locations of four of the objects, at six or more different times, presented throughout the experiment (so at least 24 memory trials in total; this can be varied as a function of the total number of trials).\nMemory version\n\tNOTE: The memory version assesses how manipulated conditions (e.g., ownership, language, see section 3.3), affect memory for object location.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to read out an instruction card at the start of every trial, instructing the placement of an object. The instruction card allows the manipulation of a language condition if desired.\nDuring object placement, ensure participants have their eyes closed. Following object placement, control for memory encoding time and ensure participants get exactly 10 seconds to encode object location memory (look at the object).\nAfter the 10 seconds of memory encoding, instruct participants to close their eyes and turn the location-stick turned upside down so that participants cannot see the locations during the memory recall [see Figure 4].\nMake sure both experimenter and participant are at their respective places during the recall (see Figure 1). In this setup, a second experimenter will move the indication stick, out of sight of the participant.\nPlace the indication stick at varying distances from the actual location (counterbalanced to be closer by or further from the participant), so that participants have to instruct the movement of the indication stick to reach the actual location.",
    "To prevent the placement of the indication stick becoming an anchor for participants, within the first 10 trials, add 3 filler trials. At these filler trials, place the indication stick at more extreme distances (e.g., 20 cm) from the actual location. These filler trials are not used in the analysis.\nInstruct the participant to verbally indicate whether the indication stick needs to be 'further' or 'closer' to match the recalled location of the object.\nWhen the participant is satisfied with the location of the indication stick, instruct them to say 'stop.'\nNote the recalled location, using the measure tape on the side of the table.\nRepeat a trial at the end of the experiment if the participant memorizes an object to be more than 10 cm from the actual location.\nVariants on Tasks\n\tNOTE: Variants on these tasks can be used in both the language version (section 3.1) and the memory version (section 3.2).\n\t\nTo manipulate the agent, use instructions that indicate whether the experimenter or the participant places the object.\nTo manipulate ownership, provide the participant with coins (e.g. as part of the participation payment). By using the participants' coins and the experimenters' coins, the ownership variable is manipulated.\nUse different object colors and forms to manipulate familiarity (e.g., for familiar: red circle; for unfamiliar: viridian nonagon).\nCover objects during encoding to manipulate visibility. A metal cover for the no-visibility and no-touch condition, a glass cover for the visibility but non-touch condition, or no cover for the visibility and possibility to touch condition. More information about these manipulations can be found in Coventry et al. (2014).",
    "To manipulate language at encoding in the memory version, use instruction cards on which language is manipulated (e.g., the participant reads out instruction cards like \"Place this/that/the [object] on the [location]\"). The instruction cards are printed on laminated cards the size of playing cards. Present these cards in a card-shoe, placed on the objects-table, to ensure easy access for the participant.\nRepeat a trial when a participant does not remember the demonstrative used on the instruction card at the end of the trial. Ask the participant to recall the demonstrative used on the instruction card at the end of each trial (to ensure participants remember the specific language condition of the trial). To ensure participants do not realize the study is about demonstratives, present this demonstrative recall task as cognitive load task, to make the task more difficult.\nTo manipulate position of a conspecific, have the conspecific take position either next to the participant, or on the opposite side of the table. In this way, the territory of the participant and experimenter can be shared or positioned opposite. This manipulation is based on linguistic theories suggesting some language (e.g., Japanese) require perspective taking when an object is closer to a conspecific. When participant and experimenter are seated opposite one another, locations can be divided by position (e.g., within reach of participant, within reach of experimenter, out of reach for both) and distance from participant (within reach of participant and experimenter, medium far, furthest away). Using this manipulation, a second experimenter needs to move the indication stick on participants’ instruction so that the first experimenter can maintain his/her position.\n4. Analysis using Multilevel Modelling (MLM)\nIdentify potential zero-values in individual cells of the design, as these may lead to statistical separation6,7",
    "Use the Satterthwaite approximation8,9 to calculate effective degrees of freedom in the MLM.\nUse a backwards stepwise procedure for interaction terms to eliminate non-significant, highest order interactions:\n\t\nRetain all lower-order interactions if a related higher-order interaction is significant.\nDouble check the changes in the model via the classification table, coefficients, and main effects with each iteration.\nUse the AIC to determine the efficiency of the model relative to the previous iteration10.\nRepeat Step 3 until reaching a model including all main effects, all significant (higher order) interactions (if any), and related lower order interactions (whether significant or not).\nUpdate: Please find more information of this updated analysis replacing Section 4 of this publication at doi: https://osf.io/wnj2v/[href=doi: https://osf.io/wnj2v/]"
