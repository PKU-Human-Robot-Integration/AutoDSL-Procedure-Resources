    "Set up the OpenSPR instrument and software according to the manufacturer’s detailed instructions in the OpenSPR manual, which includes the connection of the OpenSPR instrument to the computer with a USB cable and the fluidic setup of three bottles (for buffers and waste).Open the Experiment Data Interface on the computer, and click Start to proceed to the preparation of the instrument by:Indicating your running buffer and priming the fluidics of the OpenSPR by filling the pumps and tubing with the indicated running buffers (HBS-T, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 150 μL/min for 2.5 min to clear out any contamination or bubbles out of the fluidic lines prior to your test.Taking a new optical reference spectrum without a Sensor Chip in the instrument to calculate the sensor absorbance signal before loading a new Sensor Chip to start a new test.Loading a new NTA Sensor Chip prior to the start of a test:i. Clean the face of the Flow Cell with a lint-free wipe soaked in 80% isopropanol and allow it to air dry completely before installing a new Sensor Chip.ii. Rinse the Sensor Chip thoroughly with distilled water and allow it to air dry completely to prevent leaking and bubble formation in the Flow Cell.iii. Carefully slide the Sensor Chip into the Sensor Holder in the correct orientation and place the Sensor Holder into the instrument by first aligning it with the Fluidics Block, then slowly bring it into contact.Prepare the test by:Switching the Injection Valve to the Load position and preparing for sample injection by:i. Slowly rinsing the Injection Port and Sample Loop with at least 1.0 mL of running buffer (HBS-T, pH 7.4) to flush any previous sample/solution out of the Sample Loop fluidic lines.ii.",
    "Purging the Sample Loop using the same buffer syringe filled with at least 1.0 mL of air to push the air through the Sample Loop, to remove excess buffer in the loop via the outlet line.Removing bubbles within the fluidic lines.i. Set the pump speed at 150 μL/min and turn the Injection Valve counterclockwise to the Load position.ii. Use a syringe with a blunt-end tip to inject 300 μL of 80% isopropanol via the Inject Port into the Sample Loop, and then turn the Inject Valve clockwise to the Inject position to deliver isopropanol to the sensor.iii. Turn the Injection Valve counterclockwise back to the Load position.Immobilize the 6× His Tag-containing pCTS-L ligand onto the NTA sensor according to instructions.Surface conditioning: set the pump speed to 150 μL/mL and use disposable syringes to fill the 100 μL Sample Loop with 200 μL of imidazole solution (200 mM), and then turn the Injection Valve to the Inject position to initiate delivery of the injected imidazole solution from the Sample Loop to the sensor to clean the sensor surface. After 5 min, turn the Injection Valve counterclockwise back to the Load position.Rinse the Inject Port and Sample Loop with at least 1.0 mL of running buffer (HBS-T, pH 7.4) and purge with at least 1.0 mL of air as described in step 3a before the next injection.Surface activation: set the pump speed to 20 μL/mL and use disposable syringes to fill the Sample Loop with 200 μL of NiCl2 solution (40 mM), and then switch the Injection Valve to the Inject position to initiate delivery of the injected NiCl2 solution from the Sample Loop to the sensor to activate the NTA sensor surface.",
    "Leave the Inject Valve in the Inject position for the entire duration of the activation time until a stable baseline is obtained, and then turn the Injection Valve counterclockwise back to the Load position.Rinse the Inject Port and Sample Loop with at least 1.0 mL of running buffer (HBS-T, pH 7.4), and purge with at least 1.0 mL of air as described in step 3a.Switch the running buffer from HBS-T to 1× PBS by:i. Clicking the Stop button in the Pump Menu of the Experiment Data Interface to stop the pump.ii. Switching the inlet tubing from the bottle containing HBS-T to the bottle containing 1× PBS (pH 7.4).iii. Resuming the pump by clicking the Start button in the Pump Menu.Set the pump speed to 20 μL/mL and use disposable syringes with gastight blunt-end tips (TIP-BLUNT-50) to inject 200 μL of pCTS-L solution diluted in the running buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL. Quickly turn the Injection Valve clockwise to the Inject position to initiate the delivery of the injected pCTS-L ligand solution from the Sample Loop to the NTA sensor. Leave the Injection Valve on the Inject position for the entire duration of the ligand interaction with the sensor surface. A representative sensorgram for immobilizing pCTS-L ligand onto an NTA Sensor Chip is shown below (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230821/20230821184445_9167.jpgFigure 2. Sensorgram of pCTS-L Ligand Immobilization Note: For most protein ligands, the recommended ligand concentrations for immobilization are typically 10–50 μg/mL. We chose a higher concentration (50 μg/mL) of pCTS-L ligand to ensure its maximal immobilization to most active sites of the NTA sensor. The amount of ligand immobilized onto the NTA Sensor Chip can be determined by the subsequent increase in the response signal in corresponding sensorgrams.",
    "Once the immobilization signal has reached plateau levels, it indicates a state of maximal ligand immobilization. However, the user can repeat the immobilization procedure one more time to ensure there will be no additional further increase in the response signal (i.e., the “net signal shift”) corresponding to additional ligand immobilization, so that most (if not all) NTA open sites are occupied by the ligand to prevent non-specific interaction with analytes containing exposed histidine residues. When an injection is made, an Injection Details box will appear for the user to input the ligand name (pCTS-L) as well as the concentration (50 μg/mL), which will be used to identify the injection in the data analysis.Note: For all injections, other than the Bubble Removal Injection and Analyte Injections, leave the Injection Valve in the Inject position for at least the entire duration of the interaction time of your sample with the sensor surface. When ready to perform the next injection, turn the Injection Valve back to the Load position, and rinse the Injection Port and Sample Loop with running buffer and purge the Sample Loop with air as described in step 3a. Once the immobilization signal has reached plateau levels, it indicates a state of maximal ligand immobilization. Allow the instrument to stabilize with buffer running until the slope of the baseline is < 5 pM/min, which may take anywhere from 5 min to 1 h.Rinse the Inject Port and Sample Loop with running buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4), and purge with air as described in step 3a.Prepare TLR4 analyte solution in the analysis running buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4) at 3-fold serial dilutions (i.e., 283.7 nM, 94.6 nM, and 31.",
    "5 nM), and inject at least 200 μL of analyte solution at a flow rate of 20 μL/min in the order of increasing concentrations with an association time of 240 s and a dissociation time of 480 s.Load syringe with 200 μL of TLR4 analyte solution at a concentration of 31.5 nM, insert it fully into the Injection Port, and then slowly depress the plunger to introduce the analyte into the instrument. Wait at least 5 s to stabilize the syringe fluidic pressure in the Sample Loop before removing the syringe from the Injection Port.Turn the Injection Valve clockwise to the Inject position to initiate the delivery of the injected TLR4 analyte solution from the Sample Loop to the NTA sensor and wait for 240 s to ensure maximal interaction between ligand and analyte.When the Injection Remaining counter reaches 00:00:00, quickly turn the Injection Valve back to the Load position, and wait for 480 s to allow maximal dissociation between ligand and analyte.When the injection is complete and the baseline has settled, the user can move on to the next round of injection of TLR4 analyte at 94.6 nM and 283.7 nM, respectively, by repeating steps 6 and 7.Note: When an injection is made, an Injection Details box will appear to let the user input the analyte sample name (e.g., TLR4) as well as the concentration (e.g., 31.5 nM), so the software can identify this injection in subsequent data analysis. Before each analyte injection, the Injection Port and Sample Loop must be rinsed with analysis running buffer (e.g., 1× PBS, pH 7.4) and purged with air as described in step 3a to prevent cross-contamination between injections. To complete an experiment, click Finish to stop tracking the absorbance peak and create the final data files.",
    "For the characterization of the pCTS-L-RAGE interaction, load a new NTA Sensor Chip and prepare the solution of RAGE analyte in the analysis running buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4) at 3-fold serial dilutions (i.e., 250 nM, 83.3 nM, and 27.7 nM). Respectively, inject the Sample Loop with 200 μL of RAGE analyte solution at a flow rate of 20 μL/min in the order of increasing concentrations with an association time of 240 s and a dissociation time of 480 s following similar procedures as described in steps 2–8.Data Analysis: Once the user finishes the test, the software will create several types of data files that will always be saved under Documents\\OpenSPR\\TestResults\\ along with the name given by the user at the beginning of the test.Open TraceDrawer Software and click Add run to select and import saved files and relevant curves (i.e., TLR4 or RAGE) for analysis.Create an overlay by clicking New Overlay and then left click and drag a run to an overlay to perform data modifications in the Overlay windows.On the left side of the screen, click New Evaluation to set the Evaluation Type to Kinetics Evaluation.Define two timepoints where a concentration change occurs in the data, i.e., the beginning and end of the association phase.In the Kinetics Evaluation table that displays a row with the selected timepoint, define the concentrations of each curve, and press Next.In Fit model dropdown list, choose OneToOne model to initiate a 1:1 diffusion-corrected binding model with global fitting, then press Fit.For more comprehensive instructions on the TraceDrawer Software, please refer to the manual.Note: The user can zero the graph by clearing all the data points from the graph and normalizing the response tracking to zero on the y-axis at any stage in the experiment where a new baseline is established.",
    "For instance, the user can zero the graph to make a relative comparison for subsequent injections at any stage after the ligand immobilization step and before injection of the analyte for analysis. The user can also open advanced settings to manually adjust the axes scale by clicking the gear (settings) button in the graph menu and setting custom axes before saving an image of the graph. Shutdown ProcedureIf the user does not plan to use the instrument in the near future, it is recommended to perform a full shutdown before rinsing all fluidic lines thoroughly with at least 20 mL of deionized water and 20 mL of 80% isopropanol at the maximum speed (150 μL/min), followed by purging the lines with a sufficient amount of air to dry out the tubing lines. For information regarding other rinsing procedures and maintenance, please refer to the manual of the instrument."
