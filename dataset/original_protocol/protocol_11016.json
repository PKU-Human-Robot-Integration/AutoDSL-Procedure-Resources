    "Tumor tissue and ascites were obtained after obtaining patient consent as part of a gynecologic oncology biorepository that was approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (IRB). Patients were included if they had advanced stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). All procedures were performed at room temperature on the bench unless otherwise specified. All reagents were prepared at room temperature (unless otherwise indicated) and stored at 4 °C.\n1. Organoid generation\nGenerate the organoids following the previously published report20.\n2. Plating and irradiation of organoids\nUsing organoids in culture, dislodge the tabs of the organoids from the culture dish through manual manipulation of a pipette tip. Collect the organoids in a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the conical tube at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Using a pipette, aspirate off the supernatant carefully.\nAdd 1,000 µL of an animal origin-free, recombinant enzyme to the pellet (see Table of Materials). Mix the solution and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the solution at 1,650 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Using a pipette, carefully aspirate off the supernatant.\nAfter centrifugation and aspiration, resuspend the pellet in 1,000 µL of phosphate-buffered saline.\nTransfer 10 µL of the solution to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and mix with 10 µL of trypan blue.\nTake 10 µL of the trypan blue cell solution into a cell counting chamber slide and insert it into the cell counting machine (see Table of Materials).\nPlate 40,000 cells per 20 µL of basement membrane extract (BME) into an 8-well glass chamber slide (see Table of Materials). This maintains the organoids for 3-5 days to allow the cells to form organoids and grow to a suitable size.",
    "To induce double-strand DNA breaks, radiate the plated organoids with 10 Gray (Gy) of ɣ-irradiation (see Table of Materials for irradiator details).\n\tNOTE: This could take up to 5-10 min.\nIncubate the organoids in their culture media in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h.\n3. Immunofluorescence staining\nNOTE: Volumes refer to the amount per well of the 8-well chamber slide (~300 µL).\nAfter irradiation and incubation of the organoids, aspirate the media with a pipette, carefully so as not to disrupt the 3D matrix. Wash with 300 µL of PBS.\nFix the organoids in 300 µL of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min.\n\tNOTES: Do not leave for too long, as the BME will depolymerize and could be aspirated off.\nWash the organoids with 300 µL of staining buffer (see Table of Materials). Place on a shaker for 5 min.\nFor permeabilization, gently add 300 µL of permeabilization buffer (see Table of Materials) and incubate for 20 min. Wash with 300 µL of staining buffer. Place on a shaker for 5 min.\nAdd 300 µL of staining buffer to block the permeabilization step. Place on a shaker for 30 min. Aspirate off the staining buffer using a pipette.\nAdd 300 µL of primary antibodies (rabbit anti-RAD51, mouse anti-Geminin, rabbit anti-RPA, mouse anti-ɣH2AX, rabbit anti-Geminin, mouse anti-53BP1; see Table of Materials) diluted in staining buffer. Incubate at 4 °C for 16 h.\n\tNOTE: Avoid co-staining with the same host animal. Leave the lid off to avoid the antibodies mixing into neighboring wells.\nRemove the primary antibody solution. Perform three washes with 300 µL of staining buffer for 5 min each on the shaker.",
    "Add 300 µL of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 647; see Table of Materials) solution diluted in staining buffer and incubate for 1 h in the dark.\n\tNOTE: All subsequent steps must be performed in the dark.\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution. Add 300 µL of diluted DAPI. Place on a shaker for 5 min.\nPerform three washes with 300 µL of staining buffer for 5 min each on the shaker. Remove the staining buffer and detach the chambers using the removal kit included with the chamber slides (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Ensure not to push too far forward so as to disrupt the 3D matrix.\nUsing a p200 pipette tip with the tip cut off, add mounting medium (see Table of Materials) to cover each well with an organoid tab (e.g., 20-30 µL for each organoid tab).\nPlace a coverslip over the specimen, avoiding bubbles.\nTake clear nail polish and paint it onto the sides of the cover glass to seal the slide. Let it harden for 1 h and place it at -20 °C.\n\t​NOTE: After imaging, the slide can be stored for at least 6 months with minimal loss of fluorescence.\n4. Imaging\nAcquire images using a confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) at 63x objective with immersion oil.\n\tNOTE: If imaging nuclear proteins, 63x is advantageous, but 40x is also acceptable.\nUse DAPI to locate the organoids through the eyepiece. Select the appropriate filters for microscopy based on the fluorophores used. Set the parameters for capturing the z-stack images.\n\tNOTE: The fluorophores used in the study were DAPI, 488, and 647. The 405, 488, and 638 lasers were turned on to visualize the staining.\n\tNOTE: The recommended z-stack depends on the resolving power of the objective.",
    "Adjust the live image: set focus, laser intensity, etc.\n\tNOTE: The higher the laser intensity, the more likely the sample will photo-bleach. Therefore, select an optimum laser intensity.\nAcquire the z-stack.\n\tNOTE: This could take up to 5-10 min.\nFrom the images collected in the z-stack, screenshot at least three images per stack.\n\tNOTE: Ensure to obtain screenshots throughout the stack so as to not duplicate the nuclei when quantifying.\nSave each file as a TIFF and proceed to analysis (step 5).\n5. Analysis\nNOTE: Use JCountPro for all image analysis following the previously published report21. To obtain this software, reference the associated publication.\nUnder the object analysis panel (top of the program) in the file selection tab (bottom of the program), select the TIFF files.\nClick Add to move the selected files to the selected files group. Select Display.\nUnder the segmentation tab, select blue as the color of the nuclei. Select Auto segmentation to optimize the threshold of the nuclei.\n\tNOTE: If the auto segmentation does not accurately identify the objects, then the user can adjust the fine tune and raw tune to the image or see the user manual to further optimize the segmentation.\nUnder the objects panel, select Auto split large objects and optimize the size of the nuclei.\n\tNOTE: The nuclei typically have an unconditional size of 5,000 pixels, while the conditional size is 1,500 pixels. See the user manual to further optimize the size of the objects.\nSelect Identify objects to test the parameters.\n\tNOTE: If these parameters are not accurate, the size and tuning can be adjusted along with other settings. See the user manual for instructions regarding further optimization.\nAfter adjusting the parameters to the image, select Identify Objects in All Images to identify the nuclei in all the images selected.",
    "Select the Foci Analysis panel (top of the program).\nUnder the select files tab (bottom of the program), select the TIFF files that were used for object analysis and select the Arrow Buttons (>>) to move the images to the image files group.\nIn the directory group underneath the image files that were moved, double click the Manual Edit folder and select to move the ioc files into the object collection files group.\n\tNOTE: All TIFFs selected must have matched ioc files.\nPress Select to move the files into the selected files group. Select the Foci counting tab at the bottom of the program.\nOptimize the parameters following the steps below.\n\t\nTop hat settings index: 12.\nFocus channel: Select the color of the foci (green: ɣ-H2AX; red: RAD51).\nH dome settings: dome height %: 30; threshold %: 28 and 28.\nShape/size setting: Min focus size, pixels: 5. Select Apply Shape/Size. Max focus size (conditional): 32. Min roundness, x100: 96. Max focus, pixels: 60.\nNoise filter: size 1.\n\t\tNOTE: If determining if a nucleus is positive for geminin staining, under the second channel select green, and under analysis select intensity.\nTo test the parameters set, select the below buttons in order: Top Hat > H-Dome > Foci Count.\n\tNOTE: If these parameters do not work, the size and tuning can be adjusted along with other settings. See user manual to learn more about how the image can be further optimized.\nOnce the parameters are optimized for the selected images, select Auto count to count the foci in each image per nuclei. If the second channel is desired, the program will determine the intensity which can be used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
