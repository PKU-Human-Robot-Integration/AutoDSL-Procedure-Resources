  "procedures": [
    "The protocol provided here was adapted from established protocols13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. The overall procedure for the immunoaffinity purification (IP) of MHC class I and II peptides is illustrated in Figure 1. See Table of Materials for details about the cell lines and antibodies used.\n1. Beads coupling with the antibodies (Day 1): Coupling antibodies to sepharose CNBr-activated beads\nNOTE: Prepare fresh solutions for each new experiment. Refer to Table of Materials and Supplementary Table 1 for the list of reagents and solutions recipes. All the steps are carried out at room temperature (RT). When using a new antibody, check the binding efficiency by collecting key aliquots (see the indication OPTIONAL) and performing Coomassie blue staining SDS-PAGE (Figure 2).\nActivation of the sepharose CNBr beads\n\t\nWeigh 80 mg of sepharose CNBr-activated beads per sample and transfer them to a 15 mL conical tube.\nTo facilitate resuspension of dried beads, first, add 5 mL of 1 mM HCl and pipette up and down 5 times. Then, fill the conical tube with an additional 8.5 mL of 1 mM HCl.\nRotate at 20 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 30 min at RT using a rotator device. Centrifuge the beads at 200 x g for 2 min at RT and remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nAdd 500 µL of coupling buffer to the beads pellet and transfer to a new 2.0 mL centrifuge tube and keep aside for step 1.2.2.\nCoupling of antibodies to CNBr-activated beads\n\t\nPrepare the antibody selected for the isolation of the MHC class I or II peptides in a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube by adding 2 mg of the antibody (according to the concentration specified by the manufacturer). Complete the volume to 1 mL with the coupling buffer solution to get a final concentration of 2 mg/mL.",
    "Centrifuge the beads from step 1.1.4 at 200 x g for 2 min at RT and then remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nAdd the antibody solution to the 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the activated beads.\n(OPTIONAL) Take an aliquot of 18 µL (INPUT), add 6 µL of 4x SDS-PAGE buffer, and freeze immediately.\nRotate the microcentrifuge tube from step 1.2.3 at 20 rpm for 120 min using a rotator device. Centrifuge the beads at 200 x g for 2 min and then remove the supernatant.\n(OPTIONAL) Take an aliquot of 18 µL of the supernatant (unbound antibody), add 6 µL of 4x SDS-PAGE buffer and freeze immediately.\nBlocking and washing of antibody coupled-beads\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of 0.2 M glycine to the microcentrifuge tube containing the antibody-coupled beads from step 1.2.5. Rotate at 20 rpm for 60 min at RT using a rotator device.\nCentrifuge the beads at 200 x g for 2 min, then remove the supernatant. Add 1 mL of PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline).\nCentrifuge the beads at 200 x g for 2 min, then remove the supernatant.\n(OPTIONAL) Take an aliquot of 18 µL of the supernatant (unbound antibody, last wash), add 6 µL of 4x SDS-PAGE buffer and freeze immediately.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS to the beads in step 1.3.3.\n(OPTIONAL) Take an aliquot of 18 µL of beads mixture (beads coupled with antibody), add 6 µL of 4x SDS-PAGE buffer, and freeze immediately.\nKeep at 4 °C until use the same day in step 2.5.\n\t\t​NOTE: Beads can be prepared the day before the immunocapture, but longer storage has not been tested.\n2. Cell lysis and immunocapture with antibody coupled-beads (Day 1)",
    "NOTE: The level of MHC molecules varies from one cell type to another, and the quantification of MHC/HLA molecules per cell is suggested21 (Figure 4A). We recommend a minimum of 1 x 108 cells for each IP. This number of cells corresponds to 6-10 mg of protein from JY, EL4, and A20 cells solubilized with 0.5% Chaps buffer. To prepare cell pellets for IPs, cells should be harvested, centrifuged, and washed twice with 5 mL of PBS. Then, cell pellets can be stored in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube or a 15 mL conical tube at -80 °C until the time of the IP. Note that IPs can be performed on fresh harvested or frozen cell pellets.\nTo isolate MHC class I or II peptides, thaw a frozen pellet of 1 x 108 cells by warming the bottom of the tube with the palm. Add 500 µL of PBS to the pellet and pipette up and down until the suspension is homogenous.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the cell type, the cell pellet volume can vary substantially. If 500 µL of PBS is not enough to dissolve the cell pellet, use more PBS until the cells disaggregate easily while pipetting up and down.\nMeasure the total volume of the pellet resuspended in PBS and transfer into a new tube 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Split into more tubes if needed.\nAdd a volume of cell lysis buffer (1% chaps buffer in PBS containing protease inhibitors, 1 pellet/10 mL of buffer) equivalent to the volume of cell pellet resuspended in PBS measured in the previous step. The final concentration of the lysis buffer is 0.5% Chaps.",
    "Rotate at 10 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C using a rotator device. Centrifuge the cell lysate at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C with full brake and transfer the supernatant (containing the MHC-peptides complexes) in a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nRecover the antibody-coupled beads from step 1.3.7 by centrifugation at 200 x g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nTransfer the cell lysate supernatant in step 2.4 to the antibody-coupled beads and incubate with rotation (10 rpm) for 14-18 h (overnight) at 4 °C using a rotator device.\n3. Elution of MHC peptides (Day 2)\nNOTE: Polypropylene column allows elution of MHC-peptide complexes while retaining the beads into the column. In order to evaluate the proportion of MHC-peptides complexes bounded to the beads before and after acidic elution with 1% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid), it is possible to perform a western blot with aliquots taken at key steps during the protocol (see the indication OPTIONAL). Western blotting shown in Figure 3 reveals the enrichment of MHC-peptide complexes following acidic elution with 1% TFA. The absence of signal in this fraction would indicate that the elution step was not successful. Note that the proportion of unbound MHC-peptides complexes to the beads can also be evaluated in parallel by western blotting using an aliquot described in step 3.1.6.\nElution of MHC-peptide complexes from the antibody coupled-beads\n\t\nRemove the bottom lid of the polypropylene column, place the column onto the polypropylene column rack and install an empty container underneath to collect flow through.\n\t\tNOTE: One column per sample is required.\nRinse the polypropylene column with 10 mL of buffer A and let it drain by gravity. If the flow speed of liquid elution is too slow, further cut the bottom tip of the polypropylene column.",
    "Measure and collect the beads-lysate mixture (~2 mL) from step 2.5 and transfer it into the polypropylene column.\n(OPTIONAL) Take an aliquot of 20 µL (or 1/100 out of the total volume) for western blotting and freeze immediately. This fraction corresponds to the total MHC-peptides complexes incubated with the beads.\nLet the liquid mixture elute by gravity.\n(OPTIONAL) Collect and measure the flow-through and take an aliquot of 20 µL (or 1/100 out of the total volume) for western blotting and freeze immediately. This fraction represents the residual unbound MHC-peptides complexes.\nTo recover the beads-lysate mixture as much as possible, rinse the tube from step 3.1.3 with 1 mL of buffer A and transfer it to the polypropylene column.\nWash the beads retained in the polypropylene column by adding 10 mL of buffer A. Let the washing buffer elute by gravity.\nRepeat the washing step with 10 mL of buffer B, 10 mL of buffer A and then 10 mL of buffer C.\nRemove the polypropylene column from the rack and place it on the top of a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. Hold the column and the tube together with the hand.\nAdd 300 µL of 1% TFA to the polypropylene column and mix the beads by pipetting up and down 5 times.\n\t\tNOTE: The beads will be retained in the polypropylene column, and the MHC-bound peptides will elute in the 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTransfer the eluate in a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat step 3.1.11 and pool the 2 eluates (the eluates containing the MHC-peptide complexes should correspond to a total of 600 µL and will be used at step 3.2.4).",
    "(OPTIONAL) Collect an aliquot of 6 µL (or 1/100 of the total volume) for western blotting and freeze immediately. This fraction corresponds to the MHC-peptides complexes eluted from the beads.\nDesalting and elution of MHC peptides\n\tNOTE: Desalting and elution of MHC peptides steps could be done by installing the C18 column onto a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. For a better fit, install the anneals provided by the manufacturer between the C18 column and the 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. In this protocol, a C18 column is used with a volume capacity of 5-200 µL (6-60 µg). All the steps are carried out at RT.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of Methanol on top of the C18 column, then centrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 200 µL of 80%ACN (acetonitrile)/0.1%TFA on top of the C18 column, then centrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.1%TFA on top of the C18 column, then centrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min. Discard the flow-through.\nLoad 200 µL of the MHC-peptide complexes from step 3.1.12 on top of the C18 column. Centrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min and discard the flow through.\nRepeat step 3.2.4 twice until the complete volume has been loaded. Note that MHC peptides are retained in the C18 column.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.1%TFA to the C18 column, then centrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min. Discard the flow-through.\nTransfer the C18 column into a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. Elute MHC peptides from the C18 column by adding 150 µL of 28%ACN/0.1%TFA.\nCentrifuge at 1546 x g for 3 min.",
    "Transfer the flow-through in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Be careful not to discard the flow-through; it contains the isolated MHC class I or II peptides.\nRepeat steps 3.2.7-3.2.9 twice for a total volume of 450 µL.\nFreeze the 450 µL of eluate (purified MHC class I or II peptides) at -20 °C until samples are analyzed by LC-MSMS.\nPrior to LC-MS/MS analysis, the purified MHC class I or II peptides from step 3.2.11 are evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator with presets of 45 °C for 2 h, vacuum level: 100 mTorr and vacuum ramp: 5.\n\t\t​NOTE: The evaporation of frozen samples is highly efficient. Dried peptides can be re-frozen until analysis.\n4. Identification of MHC class I and II peptides by LC-MS/MS\nNOTE: Analyze the MHC class I and II immunopeptidome using a High-performance Orbitrap and high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometers6. The following information is given as an indication only, taking into account that the various existing tandem mass spectrometry instruments operate according to different operational standards. A brief outline of the steps are discussed below :\nSolubilize the dried samples (from step 3.2.12) in 50 µL of 4% formic acid (FA).\nLoad three injections of 16 µL for each sample and separate on a home-made reversed-phase column (150-µm i.d. by 250 mm length, Jupiter 3 µm C18 300 Å) with a gradient from 5%-30% ACN-0.1% FA and a 600 nL/min flow rate on a nano-flow UHPLC connected to an MS.\nAcquire each full MS spectrum at a resolution of 120000, an AGC of 4 x 105 with automatic mode for the injection time and spectra using tandem-MS (MS-MS) on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions for a maximum of 3 s.",
    "NOTE: Tandem-MS experiments are performed using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 30%, a resolution of 30,000, an AGC of 1.5 x 105, and an injection time of 300 ms.\nProcess the data files from the three injections/sample using a proteomics LC-MS/MS analysis software (e.g., PEAKS X) using the mouse and human databases (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (2019_09)).\nSelect 'Unspecified Enzyme Digestion' for the enzyme parameter, and 10 ppm and 0.01 Da for mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions, respectively.\n\t​NOTE: Variable modifications are deamidation (NQ) and oxidation (M). All other search parameters are the default values. Final peptide lists are filtered using ALC of 80% and with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 % using the proteomics LC-MS/MS analysis software.\n5. Visualization of immunopeptidomics data\nNOTE: The quality of immunopeptidomics data generated by MS can be assessed in multiple ways, as recently described22,23. To visualize the data and assess their overall quality, composition, and MHC-specificity, the MhcVizPipe (MVP) software tool can be used.\nFollow all the instructions and related documentation to install and run the MVP software available at the Caron Lab GitHub website24.\n\tNOTE: MVP provides a rapid and consolidated view of sample quality, composition, and MHC-specificity. MVP parallelizes the use of well-established immunopeptidomics algorithms (NetMHCpan25, NetMHCIIpan26, and GibbsCluster27) and generates organized and easy-to-understand reports in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format. The reports are fully portable and can be viewed on any computer with a modern web browser. See Supplementary Data 1-4 for examples of HTML reports."
