After tumors have been dissociated into single cells, the cells go through a series of washes. Reagents such as EDTA are added during the initial steps after plating to avoid clumping of the cells. In this example, Cell-ID™ Cisplatin is added to the sample as a live/dead stain to properly remove dead cells from downstream analysis. The Cell-ID™ Cisplatin reagent may require a titration experiment for optimal live/dead discrimination. Alternative reagents, e.g., palladium isotopes, may be used for live/dead discrimination. However, when planning, it is important to select non-overlapping channels to be used for live/dead, barcoding, and Cell-ID™ staining. Timely addition of complete RPMI media is important for quenching excess reagent. For studies that require tumor retrieval and CyTOF staining of samples on different days, see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.1].\nPipette at least 1.5 million cells from each individual sample onto each well of a U-bottom 96-microwell plate.\nCentrifuge plate at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nNote: After the first plating from the TIL, at minimum/average 2 washes are encouraged. Pellets should appear as below:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2289-Fx4.jpg\nNote: For steps using microwell plates, we recommend using a multichannel pipette and reagent boats to facilitate the workflow.\nWash cells with 200 μL of 2 mM EDTA per well, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nWash cells with 250 μL of Maxpar® PBS per well.\nResuspend cells in 50 μL/well of 20 μM Pt (1:500) in Maxpar® PBS.\nIncubate the plate for 2.5 min at 25°C.",
    "Promptly quench excess reagent by directly adding 150 μL/well complete RPMI, centrifuge plate at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nWash cells in 200 μL of Maxpar® CSB, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nRepeat the wash step two more times for a total of 3 Maxpar® CSB washes.\nCarefully pipette off the residual supernatant off the side of each well without perturbing the cell pellets.\nCyTOF for tumors—Barcode stain and batching\nTiming: ∼1 h\nUpon completion of live/dead labeling, cells will be barcoded by surface epitopes, e.g., CD45, CD98, CD29, followed by batching of samples into multiplexed tubes. This improves the efficiency of the workflow while minimizing antibody consumption and batch effects.\nAdd barcode stain 75 μL/well, gently resuspend to mix.\nIncubate the plate for 25 min at 25°C.\nAdd 150 μL/well of Maxpar® CSB to the samples, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nResuspend with 200 μL/well of Maxpar® CSB to wash, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nRepeat wash step.\nCombine well contents into multiplex tubes (VWR® Culture Tubes – Polypropylene, 4.5 mL).\nFor each multiplex batch, use 300 μL Maxpar® CSB to mix and pipette transfer from one well to the next, combining directly all wells that will be batched into one tube.\nPipette well mixture into multiplex tubes through a 40 μm filter cap.\nRepeat this at least two more times for a total of 900 μL for transferring for each tube.\nCentrifuge the multiplexed tubes at 500 g for 5 min, decant supernatant, and pipette off residual volume.\nCritical: Pipetting off any residual supernatant after decanting helps to ensure that antibody concentrations are not inadvertently diluted down.\nCyTOF for tumors—Fc receptor block and surface stain",
    "Timing: ∼1 h\nThe Fc receptor block is first added to reduce nonspecific binding of the Fc sites on antibodies. The staining cocktail of antibodies against surface epitopes is then added directly onto the samples.\nResuspend cells in calculated volume of Fc block stain.\nFor calculations, refer to ‘Reagent Preparation for CyTOF – Tumors’.\nIncubate tubes for 10 min at 25°C.\nAdd in the calculated volume of Surface Stain Cocktail.\nIncubate tubes for 30 min at 25°C.\nAdd 1 mL of Maxpar® CSB/tube, centrifuge tubes at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nWash samples in 1 mL of Maxpar® CSB/tube, centrifuge tubes at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant off, then pipette off residual.\nOptional: since tumor dissociation can be lengthy, cells can be fixed and stored in 1.6% PFA in Maxpar™ PBS for a maximum of 20 h at 4°C with stability.\nCyTOF for tumors—Fix/perm for intracellular staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe fix/perm step first fixes the cells and utilizes detergent-based permeabilization buffers to enable staining of the intracellular and intranuclear epitopes. All centrifugation steps are at 700 g instead of 500 g after fixation. An additional fixation step with a freshly made PFA solution is carried out at the end of all staining steps to ensure stability of the stained samples.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL/tube of eBio™ Fix/Perm.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C.\nAdd to samples 1 mL of perm buffer/tube, spin at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nWash samples with 1 mL of perm buffer/tube, spin at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant the supernatant and pipette residual volume off.\nResuspend cells in calculated volume of intracellular stain.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C.",
    "Add to samples 1 mL of perm buffer/tube, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nWash samples in 1 mL of Maxpar® CSB/tube, centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant, then pipette any residual volume off.\nResuspend cells in 400 μL/tube of 1.6% PFA in Maxpar® PBS, and fix for 10 min at 25°C if planning to proceed immediately to ‘CyTOF for Tumors – Rh Staining + Cell Counting[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.1.5]’.\nOptional: can be stored in 1.6% PFA in Maxpar® PBS up to 1 week at 4°C with stability.\nCyTOF for tumors—Rh staining + cell counting\nTiming: ∼1–2 h\nThe Rh stain, a DNA Intercalator, is used to recognize nucleated cell events during analysis. As discussed above, it is important to choose the Cell-ID™ carefully as some commonly used barcoding methods and live/dead assays can overlap in signal. For this protocol, we recommend avoiding live/dead assays with lower metal channels (such as 102–110Pd), as they would overlap in signal with the custom barcodes (metal channels 112–116) utilized in tumor CyTOF. Alternative Cell-ID™ metals for this barcoding scheme include iridium (191/193) and cisplatinum (194–198). The final cell count is critical for estimating the cell yield at the end of the data acquisition.\nCentrifuge tubes at 700 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant the supernatant, pipette residual volume off.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL/tube of Rh, incubate for 30 min to 1 h at 25°C.\nAdd to samples 1 mL of Maxpar® CSB/tube.\nDo a final cell count for each tube after resuspending in Maxpar® CSB.\nCentrifuge tubes at 700 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.",
    "Repeat wash, after decanting, vortex tubes for 2–3 s to resuspend cells in residual volume, Store tubes at 4°C until data acquisition; Rh stain will be stable for 2–3 days in 4°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2289-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating scheme used for demonstrating expected outcomes from mouse tumor immunoprofiling\nSequential gating is performed to identify CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells (PD1- and PD1+). Continued subsequent gating identifies B220+CD19+ B cells, NK1.1+ NK cells, F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages, Ly6C+ monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and Ly6G+ granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells.\nNote: For visualization of a stable Rh stain, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nSection 2: CyTOF for whole blood\nTiming: 6–7 h\nCyTOF for whole blood—Bleeding\nTiming: 10 min\nIt is imperative to work quickly with fresh blood. Although the blood collection tube will come pre-coated with an anticoagulant, it is recommended to shake the tube after collection so that the blood can be mixed well with anticoagulant as much as possible. We recommend the Microvette K3EDTA collection tube (Cat: 102971-718, VWR). Additional EDTA is mixed to further prevent cell clumping.\nBlood collection, as described in above section [Example protocol for survival blood collection.\nJust prior to staining, pipette 90 μL blood from the collection tube into a deep-well 96-well plate with pre-aliquoted 10 μL of 0.5 M EDTA and mix well.\nProceed immediately to Fc receptor block and surface stain.\nNote: We generally skip initial cell counting step or any other preprocessing methods, e.g., ACK lysis of red blood cells or live-cell barcoding for multiplexing of samples prior to staining, to avoid sample loss. We have expected cell yields from a 100–200 μL volume of blood based on prior experience. See below in Expected Outcomes.\nCyTOF for whole blood—Fc receptor block, surface stain, fix/lyse\nTiming: 1 h 15 min",
    "The Fc receptor block is first added to reduce nonspecific binding of the Fc sites on antibodies. The staining cocktail of antibodies against surface epitopes is then added directly onto the samples. Since the staining occurs prior to multiplexing in this protocol, the use of a multichannel pipette is recommended. If the study involves assaying of time-sensitive antigens, e.g., phospho-epitopes, prompt fixation of blood samples followed by staining is recommended. However, the antibody panel must be tested to ensure that the antigens of interest are detectable post-fixation with the antibody clones used in the panel.\nPipette 2 μL of stock Fc receptor block directly into wells and mix.\nIncubate for 10 min at 25°C.\nAdd 48 μL surface stain solution into the wells and mix, incubate for 30 min at 25°C.\nAdd to samples 1 mL of Maxpar® CSB/well, centrifuge plate at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of Maxpar® CSB.\nPipette 2 mL of pre-warmed 1× BD Phosflow™ Fix/Lyse in each well.\nIncubate plate in a 37°C water bath for 15 min, centrifuge plate at 500 g for 5 min at 25°C, decant supernatant.\nNote: Make sure red blood cells have fully lysed before moving onto the next step.

As discussed above, it is important to choose the Cell-ID™ carefully as some commonly used barcoding methods and live/dead assays can overlap in signal. In this protocol for whole blood staining where Pd is used for barcoding (102, 104, 105, 106, 108–110), Ir (191/193) is selected instead of Rh (103).
