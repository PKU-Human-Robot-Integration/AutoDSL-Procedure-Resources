    "1. \tChoose a Polymer\nChoose a polymer (e.g., poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polystyrene (PS) or nylon) based on your specifications (e.g., biodegradable, thermoplastic or cross-linkable) and a solvent of that polymer. Choose suitable personal protective equipment based on your selection.\nSelect a substrate based on your application (e.g., glass, plastic, metal or silicon wafer).\n2. \tChoose a Collector\nChoose the collector geometry based on your specifications. Random fibers can be collected on stationary plates. Aligned fibers can be collected on rapidly rotating wheels, drums or rods, or on parallel plates.\nThe collector must be conductive and must remain isolated from its axel in such a way that it can be grounded without also grounding adjacent objects, the table top, etc.\n3. \tApproximate the Critical Entanglement Concentration Empirically1\nPrepare several candidate polymer concentrations (e.g., 4, 10, 15, 20, 30 wt%) and choose a concentration that flows (the solution should be a viscous liquid but not a gel) to start with.\nSet up the electrospinning apparatus2,3,4,5  (see Figure 1)\nLoad the syringe pump and set the pump speed such that any bead of solution wiped from the tip is immediately replaced.\nGround the collector and clip the high voltage wire to the conductor plate (a small square of conductive material such as aluminum foil through which the syringe tip protrudes).\nStart the wheel spinning.\nMake sure the power supply is set to zero before turning it on.\nObserve the stream\nRamp voltage up slowly and watch the bead of the solution at the needle tip.\nAdjust the voltage to obtain a long and steady stream.  If a steady stream cannot be obtained, adjust the polymer solution concentration. See Table 1 for an example.\n4. \tTroubleshooting - the Stream:\nTrouble viewing the stream",
    "Use a dark matte backdrop and place a unidirectional light source (such as a flashlight) between the viewer and the stream (see Figure 2).\nDripping from the syringe tip\nIf the polymer solution is dripping straight down with no attraction to the wheel, make sure the conductor plate is making contact with the needle tip and that the collector is making contact with ground.\nIf the drop of polymer solution at the syringe tip is leaning in the direction of the wheel but is not forming a stream, increase the voltage.  The quality of the stream can be adjusted by varying the distance and the voltage until a steady stream is visible.  See Figure 3 for suggested distances with corresponding voltages for a 4% PLLA solution and an 8x8 cm conductor plate.\nLarge globs at the syringe tip\nWhen the polymer solution begins to collect and harden at the tip of the needle, swipe the glob away with a paper towel attached to a non-conductive stick.\nOscillating or 'wagging' streams\nWhen the stream is wagging up and down rapidly, turn down the voltage or increase the distance between the syringe tip and the wheel. If the stream continues to wag use a higher concentration of polymer or add a little solvent with a slower evaporation.\nShort or discontinuous streams\nVisible steady streams making observable contact with the wheel set at a high rotational velocity yield the highest quality of uniformity and alignment. When the stream is short and discontinuous, increasing the polymer solution, adding more slow evaporating solvent, and adjusting the voltage will improve the length and steadiness of the stream.\n5. \tTroubleshooting - Fiber Morphology6,7,8 (refer to Figure 4)\nBeading",
    "When beads are discovered in the fibers, increase the polymer solution and make sure the conductor plate is making continuous contact with the needle and that the grounded wire brush is making continuous contact with the wheel.\nRibbons and bleeding fibers\nWhen fibers are forming as ribbons or are bleeding together, use a higher concentration of polymer or a solvent with a higher rate of evaporation (more volatile).\nCurlicue or wavy fibers\nWhen fibers are forming waves or curlicues, increase the wheel speed or move the needle tip further from the collector.  Also, check that the conductor plate and collector are not vibrating.\nPorosity9\nIf pores are desired, use a rapidly evaporating solvent. If pores are not desired, try adding a small amount of co-solvent that is less volatile than the major solvent.\nAlignment10\nWhen the collector is moving at a low RPM or at rest, the alignment quality is poor.  Increase the alignment by increasing the speed of the wheel.\n6.  Representative Results:\nPlease refer to Figure 4 for depictions of typical fiber results.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2494/2494fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A typical electrospinning setup. A polymer solution (blue) is dispensed from a syringe pump (orange). A high voltage DC power supply (green) grounds a rapidly rotating wheel collector (grey) onto which aligned nanofibers are collected. The polymer jet between the syringe and collector consists of a steady streaming segment and a rapidly oscillating whipping segment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2494/2494fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The streaming jet is visible exiting the syringe tip; the whipping jet is too small to be seen.\nApproximating the critical entanglement concentration of PLLA\ntable:\nï»¿0,1,2\nPLLA (% wt/v),Observation,Concentration Adjustment\n0.5,Dripping; no stream,Increase\n2.0,Spitting small globs; no stream,Increse slightly\n4.0,Steady stream,Good\n6.0,Spitting large globs or beads,Decrease slightly\n12.0,Clumping at the tip; no stream,Decrease",
    "Table 1. An example depicting the approximation of the critical entanglement concentration of PLLA. Various polymer concentrations are tried and the resulting streaming jets observed until a steady stream is obtained.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2494/2494fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The distance between the syringe tip and the collector must be balanced with the applied voltage to obtain a steady streaming jet. Excess applied voltage causes an oscillating or 'wagging' jet to form that results in less well-aligned fibers. When the voltage is too low, no jet will form and the solution will only drip from the syringe tip. The purple shaded region above represents the voltage range over which a steady streaming jet can be obtained for PLLA as a function of syringe-to-collector distance.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2494/2494fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Electrospun fibers can exhibit a variety of morphologies, including beading (A), ribbons (B), curlicues (C), porous globs (D), good alignment (E) and poor alignment (F)."
