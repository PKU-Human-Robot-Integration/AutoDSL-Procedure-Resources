    "Prepare transwell membranesDilute Matrigel to 0.2% in cell culture media (see Note 1).Place the transwell membranes upside down in a 15 cm cell culture plate. Add 1 ml of diluted matrigel on the top, coating the bottom (underside) of each transwell membrane.Incubate at 37°C for 1 h.Prepare cellsIn the meantime, wash cells with 1× PBS and trypsinize them.Pellet by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min.Resuspend in cell culture media to a concentration of 500,000 cells per ml. Two milliliters of this cell suspension is needed for each transwell membrane (see Note 2).Plate cellsRemove Matrigel solution from the transwell membranes.In each well of a deep well 6-well plate, place 4 ml of cell culture media.Put one transwell filter in each well.Place 2 ml of cell solution (Step B3) onto each filter.If a media change following plating is necessary (e.g., a change into differentiation-inducing media), allow cells to attach for 1 h, then replace the media above and below the membrane. Change pipettes in between dealing with the solutions above and below the membrane to avoid introducing cells into the lower chamber.Allow cells to incubate at 37°C for 48 h.Fractionate cellsNote: For a description of this procedure, see Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Mechanical fractionation of neuronal cells for subcellular RNA analysis. This video details the procedures for mechanical fractionation of neuronal cells using microporous membranes and highlights key points of the protocol.Gently remove media above and below the membrane by aspiration.Replace the media with PBS, using 2 ml below the membrane and 1 ml above the membrane.Remove the cell bodies on the top of each membrane.Gently but thoroughly scrape the top of each membrane with a cell lifter, making sure to get the edges of the membrane where it joins the plastic housing (Figure 1A) (see Note 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210527/20210527233415_3378.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Mechanical fractionation of cells. A. The top of the membrane is scraped to remove cell bodies. B. The membrane is then removed from the plastic housing using a razor blade. C. The cut membrane is placed in a dish of lysis buffer using tweezers.Transfer 700 μl of the cell body suspension into a 15 ml conical tube on ice.Tilting the membrane, scrape any remaining cell bodies into the remaining 300 μl of PBS.Thoroughly transfer the PBS into the 15 ml conical tube.Place the membrane upside down on a clean surface (for example, the lid of the 6-well plate).Repeat Steps D3a through D3e for the remaining membranes.After scraping and removing the cell bodies from all six membranes, place 550 μl of RNA lysis buffer from the Zymo RNA Microprep kit into a 6 cm dish.Remove each membrane from its plastic housing.Using a fresh razor blade, cut each membrane to remove it from the housing, leaving approximately 3 mm around the edge (Figure 1B) (see Note 4).Using tweezers, carefully put the released membrane into the RNA lysis buffer with the neurite-containing side facing down (Figure 1C).Repeat for all six membranes, placing all in the same 6 cm dish.Incubate the dish at room temperature with rocking for 15 min to lyse neurites.In the meantime, centrifuge cell bodies at 2,000 × g at 4°C for 7 min. Resuspend in 600 μl of PBS (i.e., 100 μl per membrane).Reserve samples for western blotting.Take 10 μl of the 600 μl cell body suspension. Add 90 μl of Protein Sample Buffer.Take 50 μl of the 550 μl neurite lysate. Add to 50 μl of Protein Sample Buffer. Guanidine in the RNA lysis buffer will precipitate from solution upon addition to Protein Sample Buffer, but that is expected.",
    "Store these samples at -20°C until analysis of fractionation efficiency by western blotting.Isolate RNATake 100 μl of cell body suspension and isolate RNA according to the instructions of the Zymo Quick RNA Microprep kit, beginning with the addition of 350 μl of RNA lysis buffer.Take the remaining 500 μl of neurite lysate and isolate RNA according to the kit’s instructions, beginning with the addition of 500 μl of 95-100% ethanol.Elute RNAElute RNA in 15 μl RNase free water (see Note 5).Analysis of fractionation efficiency using western blotting (see Note 6)Heat the samples that were reserved for western blotting (Step D8) for 5 min at 98°C.Load 5 μl of cell body sample per lane.Load 15 μl of neurite sample per lane while it is still hot. This helps any precipitated guanidine to dissolve and facilitates loading.Run a SDS-PAGE gel and transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane.Blot with primary antibodies.Use the β-actin antibody at 1:5,000 dilution.Use the histone H3 antibody at 1:10,000 dilution.Probe with an appropriate mouse secondary antibody.Image blot. See Figure 2 for a blot depicting an efficient fractionation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210527/20210527233525_4615.jpgFigure 2. Assessment of fractionation efficiency by western blotting. Cell body samples are indicated by CB, and neurite samples are indicated by N.Analysis of fractionation efficiency using RT-qPCR (see Note 7)Reverse transcribe 100 ng of RNA from each sample (see Note 8)Combine 2 μl of 5× iScript RT master mix, RNA, and water into a 10 μl reaction.Incubate in a thermocycler for 5 min at 25°C, 20 min at 46°C, and 1 min at 95°C.Dilute reaction with water to a 20 μl final volume (see Note 9).Perform qPCRUsing a qPCR master mix of your choice, perform qPCR to quantify the desired marker RNA molecules in each fraction. Use 2 μl of cDNA from Step F1c per reaction.",
    "It is usually best to quantify the ratio of two RNA molecules in each sample, with one of the two known to be neurite enriched. The accuracy of the ratio in each sample can be improved using TaqMan qPCR probes to allow simultaneous quantification of the two species in the same reaction.Assess qPCR resultsFrom the qPCR results, calculate the relative abundance of the neurite-enriched and control RNAs in the cell body and neurite fractions. If the fractionation was successful, the ratio of the neurite-enriched RNA to control RNA will be higher in the neurite fraction than in the cell body fraction. See Figure 3 for qPCR results from a successful fractionation. The increased variation in neurite quantification relative to cell body quantification is typical and likely reflects the technical variation inherent to differences in fractionation efficiency between replicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210527/20210527233624_0546.jpgFigure 3. qPCR results from a successful fractionation. Ranbp1 RNA is known from previous experiments to be enriched in neurites, while Tsc1 is known from previous experiments to be enriched in cell bodies. The relative amounts of these RNA species were quantified in cell body and neurite samples using Taqman qPCR.Construction of high-throughput sequencing librariesUse the purified RNA to make high-throughput RNA sequencing libraries. Several commercial kits are available for this purpose, although we have had consistently good results using the mRNA Hyperprep kit from KAPA (Kapa KK8580). Importantly, provide the same amount of input RNA (e.g., 100 ng) for all samples in the kit, even though significantly more RNA can be isolated from cell bodies than from neurites."
