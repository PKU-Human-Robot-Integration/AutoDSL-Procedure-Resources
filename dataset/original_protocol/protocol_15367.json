    "1. Cell culture, plasmid and buffer preparation for the experiment\nIn this experiment Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) are used. Cells are grown in a nutrient mixture HAM-F12 (PAA) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 µl/l gentamicin (all from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Deisenhofen, Germany), and 1 ml/l crystacilin (Pliva, Zagreb, Croatia). Cells are kept at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in the incubator for 24h.\nAmplify plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) in DH5α strain of Escherichia coli and isolate it with HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Plasmid DNA concentration (plasmid dissolved in TE buffer) should be spectrophotometrically determined at 260 nm and confirmed by gel electrophoresis.\nPrepare isoosmolar sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.4).\nOn the day of experiment prepare cell suspension by trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Deisenhofen, Germany). Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 1000 rpm (180 x g) at 4°C (Sigma, Germany) and resuspend cell pellet in isoosmolar sodium phosphate buffer to a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml.\n2. Hardware equipment\nCells are exposed to electric field in pipette tip (Figure 1) with integrated electrodes connected to a high-voltage prototype generator. The tip and electrode geometry allows application of relatively homogeneous electric field and the generator allows delivery of electric pulses in different directions. The tip and the generator were developed at Laboratory of Biocybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana 1.",

In the cross section grey color is used for the plastic housing and black for the electrodes. The pipette tip with integrated electrodes consists of four cylindrical rod electrodes. The electrodes are made of stainless steel; their diameter is 1.4 mm, adjacent electrodes are 1 mm apart, and opposite electrodes are 2 mm apart. The electrodes are glued into the plastic tip in parallel and their applicable length is 30 mm 2.\n3. Gene electrotransfer protocol\nAdd plasmid pEGFP-N1 to a cell suspension in concentration 10 μg/ml.\nIncubate the mixture for 2-3 minutes at room temperature, before applying electric pulses.\nAspire 100 µl of cell suspension into the pipette tip with integrated electrodes.\nTo achieve best gene electrotransfer efficacy and maintain cell viability, optimal parameters of electric pulses should be used. In this experiment a train of 8 rectangular pulses (each with duration of 1 ms, amplitude 225 V at 1 Hz repetition frequency) is applied to each sample, using high-voltage prototype generator. Two different electric field protocols (Figure 2) are used: in the first protocol all pulses are delivered in the same direction, whereas in the second protocol pulses are delivered by changing alternatively the electric field direction and orientation. The second protocol can only be used with appropriate pulse generator, which allows application of electric pulses in different directions.\nImmediately after the pulse application transfer the cells from pipette tip into 6 well plate and add fetal calf serum (FCS-Sigma, USA) (25% of sample volume).\nIncubate cells for 5 min at 37°C to allow cell membrane resealing.",
    "Add 2 ml of HAM-F12 to each sample in 6 well and incubate cells for 24h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in the incubator.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3309/3309fig2.jpgFigure 2.Electric field protocols: (a) all pulses are delivered in the same direction, (b) pulses are delivered by changing alternatively the electric field direction and orientation.\n4. Image acquisition and determination of gene electrotransfer efficacy\nEfficacy of gene electrotransfer is determined as the percentage of cells expressing GFP 24h after the pulse application.\nThe cells are observed using a fluorescence microscope (in our case Zeiss 200, Axiovert, ZR Germany) with excitation light at 488 nm generated with a monochromator system (PolyChrome IV, Visitron, Germany) and emission is detected at 507 nm. The images are recorded using imaging system (MetaMorph imaging system, Visitron, Germany), but other similar acquisition software can also be used.\nAcquire at least five images (phase contrast and green fluorescence) at 20x objective magnification.\nCount cells in phase contrast image and cells that are expressing GFP in green fluorescence image. Determine the percentage of gene electrotransfer efficacy by dividing the number of cells that are expressing GFP with the number of all cells in each corresponding image (Figure 3).\n5. Representative results:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3309/3309fig3.jpgFigure 3.The percentage of cells expressing GFP when all pulses are delivered in the same direction and when pulses are delivered by changing alternatively the electric field direction and orientation is presented. Cells were exposed to a train of eight pulses with amplitude 225 V, duration 1 ms and repetition frequency of 1 Hz. Results were obtained by means of fluorescence microscopy. Each value in the graph represent mean of three independent experiments ± standard deviation. By changing the electric field direction and orientation the percentage of cells expressing GFP increases.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
