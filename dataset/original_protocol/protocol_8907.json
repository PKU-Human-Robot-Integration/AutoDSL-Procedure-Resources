    "Ethics statement: All animal experimentation adheres the animal care guidelines established by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the Canadian Council of Animal Care.\n1. Oxygen Induced Retinopathy (OIR)\nRecord date of birth of mouse pups as P0.\nRecord all weights of animals upon entry into O2 to ensure an adequate weight range. Note: For C57BL/6 mice at P17, body weight should range between 5 and 7.5 g for maximal NV32. In order to maintain environmental consistency, it is recommended to use littermates as control (for genetically modified mice as well as mice receiving experimental treatments). When assessing effects of a viral vector, one must consider tropism of the virus and allow sufficient time for full expression of virally-delivered transgenes. Rapidly expressing viral vectors such as 3rd generation lentiviruses24,25,33 are recommended.\nPlace mouse pups at P7 (C57BL/6 or desired strain) and a CD1 fostering mother into an oxygen chamber set at 75% O2 for 5 days27. Environmental humidity and temperature were held constant throughout O2 exposure. Note: Research facilities equipped with a central source of O2 are ideal and limit the cumbersome replacement of empty O2 tanks. If working with transgenic or knockout mice, it is important to ensure that control and experimental mice are acquired from the same vendor to limit genetic drifts within the same strains30,29. \nAt P12, remove mice from the oxygen chamber and return animals to ambient O2.\n2. Intravitreal Injection for Delivery of Compounds to the Inner Retina (When Assessing Effects of a Pharmacological Compound or Recombinant Protein)",
    "At P14, anesthetize mice with 2% isoflurane in oxygen 2 L/min (or animal protection committee-approved anesthetic of choice). In order to verify the effectiveness of the anesthesia, sequentially pinch the tail, rear foot and ear with forceps.\nPlace the mouse on its belly.\nUsing a sterile 10 µl syringe fitted with a beveled pulled-glass needle, perform an injection of a maximal volume of 1 µl of solution containing the compound being investigated or vehicle (physiological saline) at the posterior limbus of the eye, with a 45° angle avoiding the lens. Note: The pulled glass-needle is attached to the syringe using a drop of epoxy-resin.\nApply a drop of lubricant ophthalmic ointment (ideally with antibiotic) with a swab to the mouse’s eye.\nReturn the mouse back to the cage with fostering mother. Mice are then carefully monitored until recovered and fully ambulatory.\n3. Assessment of Vessel Perfusion and Barrier Function (Integrity) by Fluorescein Angiography\nAnesthetize mice with 2% isoflurane in oxygen 2 L/min (or animal protection committee-approved anesthetic of choice). In order to verify the effectiveness of the anesthesia, sequentially pinch the tail, rear foot and ear with forceps. Note: This is typically performed at P17 when regeneration is assessed. Also carry-out the analysis at P19 and P21 to determine if vascular integrity is preserved over time.\nOnce anesthetized, weigh the mouse.\nMake a midline abdomen incision with dissecting scissors. Note: Dissecting instruments should be regularly checked and sharpened.\nCut ribs laterally and raise the ribcage with the aid of forceps. Note: It is necessary to cut as laterally as possible to avoid damage to the heart.\nAfter removing peripheral tissue from the heart, clamp the descending aorta with hemostatic forceps.",
    "Slowly inject fluorescein-dextran to the left ventricle using a 25 G needle. Note: If vascular barrier function is investigated, 70 kDa fluorescein-dextran is employed as it will leak out of vessels when vessel integrity is compromised. If the investigator wants to cast blood vessels, 2 MDa fluorescein-dextran is used. Critical steps: 1) To ensure a homogenous repartition, centrifuge fluorescein-dextran and inject the supernatant, 2) In order to prevent vessel constriction, inject warmed fluorescein-dextran solution, 3) Its circulation time shouldn’t excess 4 min.\nDecapitate mice 2 min after injection with operating scissors.\n4. Enucleation and Eye Fixation\nNote: When assessing rates of vascular regeneration, first collect retinas at P12 and additionally at P14 and P17. Increase the number of sampled time points for more accurate determination of rates of revascularization24.\nTilt the mouse head and place it on its side.\nRemove skin and eyelids covering the eye using dissecting scissors.\nPlace curved forceps below the eye and gently pull it up until the optic nerve is severed.\nTurn the mouse’s head onto its other side and perform the same steps (steps 4.2 and 4.3).\nTo ensure better penetration of fixative, puncture a hole in the anterior chamber of the eye using 30 G needle.\nTransfer eyes to a tube containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and fix for 1 hr at room temperature.\nRemove PFA and wash eyes 4 times with a solution of ice-cold PBS.\n5. Retinal Dissection\nPlace mouse eyes in a Petri dish containing cold PBS and perform dissection of the retinas under a stereomicroscope.\nRemove extra fat/tissue surrounding the eye with micro-dissection scissors.\nCut off the cornea with micro-dissection scissors.\nUsing two pairs of forceps, minutely peel the sclera away from the periphery towards the optic nerve and discard.",
    "Pinch the lens (whitish ball beneath the cornea) with forceps and extract it from the eye cup. Use one pair of forceps as a support, and the other to grip and carefully raise and remove the lens.\nDetach the hyaloid vessels from the inner side of the retina using small brushes (size 0) and forceps.\nRemove bundles of hyaloid vessels connected to the optic disc using forceps.\nTransfer dissected retinas to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing PBS and place on ice prior to starting the staining procedure.\n6. Retinal Vascular Staining\nIncubate dissected retinas overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C in a solution of fluorescently coupled-isolectin B4 (rhodamine-lectin or other) in PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2 (a 1:100 dilution of a 2 mg/ml isolectin B4 solution is recommended). During the entire staining procedure, cover tubes with aluminum foil or an opaque foil to protect from light.\nOn the following day, remove staining solution and wash retinas 3x in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\n7. Preparation of Retinal Flatmounts\nTransfer retinas, photoreceptor-side down, onto a microscope slide and make four deep equidistant radial incisions using a surgical scalpel to divide the retina into four equal-sized quadrants. During the incisions, brace the retina with a brush so that it does not move.\nUsing two brushes soaked in PBS, carefully flatten the quadrants photoreceptor side-down and immerse the retina in mounting medium to prevent photo-bleaching. Then carefully place a coverslip on the surface of the mounted retina without applying pressure and making sure that air bubbles do not accumulate under the cover slip.\n8. Imaging and Quantification of Vasoobliteration (VO) and Neovascularization (NV) as Previously Described31\nTake images of whole-mounted retinas with an epi-fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 10X.",
    "Open the retinal image in photo editing software, stitch together and measure the total retinal area, and avascular area. Area can be expressed in pixels.\nDetermine extent of VO by dividing the number of pixels in the avascular area by the number of pixels in the total retinal area.\nDetermine extent of NV by dividing the number of pixels of NV by the number of pixels in the total retinal area as described31.\nSubscription Required.
