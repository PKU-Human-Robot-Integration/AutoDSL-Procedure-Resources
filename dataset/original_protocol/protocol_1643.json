The surgical procedure for implanting electrodes\n(A) Adult mice were anaesthetized, the head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and the hair on the head of the mouse was removed.\n(B) Two skull screws were inserted in the frontal skull for EEG recording, and two others were placed in the skull of the lateral parietal region for grounding. The skull was leveled using a stereotaxic frame, and the location of the target nucleus was marked. Scaling bar: 5 mm.\n(C) The electrode bundle of the homemade multichannel electrode was slowly inserted into a hole at the targeted location on the skull.\n(D) The electrode bundle was secured by dental cement.\n(E) Two EEG wires were soldered to two skull screws in the frontal region for EEG recording, and two ground wires were soldered to two other screws for grounding.\n(F) A large spherical solder was soldered at the terminals of the EMG wires.\n(G) Two EMG wires were inserted into the neck muscles, and the skin was sutured.\n(H) Dental cement was used to secure the exposed skull and electrode.\n(I) The mouse was recovered after surgery.",
    "Sterilize the surgical scissors, hemostatic forceps, stainless skull screws and other surgical instruments by autoclaving before the operation. Spray alcohol on the operating tables, stereotaxic frame, and electrode bundles for disinfection. Use the iodophor to disinfect the scalp of mice with hair removed. Wear gloves and masks during the operation, and strictly implement aseptic operation to alleviate the pain of mice as far as possible.\nAnesthetize an adult mouse with 1% sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and place it on a stereotaxic frame. Remove the hair on the head of the mouse, and fix the head of the mouse by an adaptor of a stereotaxic frame (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCut the mouse scalp to expose the skull, insert two stainless skull screws into the frontal region, and place two others in the lateral parietal region.\nAdjust the skull plane to ensure that the bregma and lambda are at a horizontal level on the stereotaxic apparatus.\nCalculate and mark the location of the target nucleus (LC: AP = −6.00 mm; ML = ± 0.95 mm) on the skull according to the mouse atlas by Paxinos and Watson (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nMove an electrode over the target brain region, and drill a hole at the desired location on the skull. To verify the location of the implant at the end of the experiment, the electrode tips are dipped in fluorescent Neuro-Dil dye (dissolve at 1–2 mM in vegetable oil by heating to 55°C) prior to surgery insertion, which can then reveal the electrode track under a fluorescent microscope.\nRemove the dura of the hole carefully, and insert the electrode bundle slowly into the brain tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (Ma et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nSecure the electrode bundle on the skull using 3M Vetbond tissue glue and dental cement sequentially (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Solder two insulated silver EEG wires to two screws in the frontal skull, and solder two ground wires to two other screws in the lateral parietal skull respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nInsert two EMG electrodes into the neck muscles, and suture the neck skin (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and G).\nFix the electrode finally to the skull with more dental cement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nAfter the dental cement is solidified, remove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame and place on an electric blanket to keep warm and accelerate recovery from anesthesia (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nCritical: Soldering of insulating silver wire and stainless-steel screw as quickly as possible to prevent brain damage caused by high temperature. Skull screws for EEG recording should not contact the scalp to avoid recording the heartbeat of mice. Skull screws should not be inserted too deep to avoid damage to brain tissue, and dental cement should be covered around the skull screws to provide better sealing.\nEEG-EMG signal recording and LC neuronal spike acquisition\nTiming: 1 day\nOne week after the electrode is implanted, mice have no hemiplegia, no inflammation and edema in the dental cement cover. And mice appear healthy with normal activity and body weight regain to more than or equal to 90% of their presurgery level. At this point, we can record the discharges of LC neurons in different sleep stages (including wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1203-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Record neuronal signals in a quiet room with a shielded box starting on the 7th day after implantation of the electrodes into the mice.\nConnect mice with a commutator at least 1 day before the recording for habituation. To avoid electrode shedding, anesthetize the mice lightly with isoflurane before connecting the electrodes to an adaptor of the recording system.\nFilter the spike and LFP (local field potential) signals online at 300–7,000 Hz and 0.7–200 Hz, respectively.\nRecord LFP and spike signals simultaneously. The LFP signals of channel 2 and 4 represent EEG signals, channel 1 and 3 represent the EMG signals, and the spike signals of channels 5 to 16 collect the discharges of LC neurons.\nRecord LFP and spike signals continuously for approximately 1 h during zeitgeber time(ZT) 2 to ZT 14, and the mice experience stages of wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep.\nCritical: The recording time should not exceed 1 h, otherwise the recording file will be very large, approximately 8 GB. The big data file is not conducive to data processing, and different sleep states should be recorded in one file to facilitate later data processing.\nData processing and analysis\nTiming: 3 days\nSave spike waveforms, time stamps and LFP signals to Plexon data (∗.plx) files. Analyze LFP signals by SleepSign software (Kissei Comtec, Japan). Sort the spikes by the valley seek method with Offline Sorter software (Plexon, USA) (Fukunaga and Mantock, 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The sorted units are analyzed with NeuroExplorer 5.0 to obtain a graph, and a chart of the firing rate of the neurons and timestamps is exported for further analysis in GraphPad Prism (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1203-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(B) EEG and EMG recording traces during wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep.\n(C) Action potential waveforms of two sorted LC neurons from a single electrode channel and clusters formed by the distinct action potential waveforms plotted in principal component space are shown in Offline Sorter.\nLFP signal processing\nTiming: 6 h\nExporting Plexon data (∗.plx) files to spreadsheet txt (∗.txt) files by Spike2 software.\nOpen spreadsheet txt (∗.txt) files in SleepSign software, and digitize the LFP signal data at a sampling rate of 230 Hz using SleepSign.\nPolygraphic recordings are automatically scored offline as wakefulness, NREM sleep, or REM sleep in 4 s epochs using SleepSign according to standard criteria. We define wakefulness as desynchronized, low-amplitude EEG rhythms and elevated EMG activity with phasic bursts; NREM sleep is defined as synchronized, high-amplitude, low-frequency (0.5–4 Hz) EEG activity in the absence of motor activity compared with wakefulness; REM sleep is defined as containing a pronounced theta (4–10 Hz) rhythm and muscle atonia (Luo et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Visually examine and manually correct defined sleep-wake stages if necessary.\nSelect the time range in which the mice are in wakefulness, NREM or REM sleep (the duration of episode: wakefulness and NREM sleep ≧ 6 min; REM sleep ≧ 30 s).\nSpike signal sorting\nTiming: 2 days\nOpen recorded neural activity in a .plx file by Plexon Offline Sorter.\nSelecting and opening the channel that records the neuronal spike signal.\nRemove the obviously distinct, mussy waves manually.\nAutomatic clustering\nTo obtain the best principal component calculation effect, it is necessary to align the action potential waveform (align waveforms). When operating, choose to align the waveform at the maximum or minimum value of the action potential waveform (Min et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nRecalculate the principal components (RPC).",
    "Then, the waveforms are clustered automatically by the valley seeking method, and units are added.\nRemove the remaining mussy waves manually in a three-dimensional feature space by the template method (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1203-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Cut the brain sections serially in the coronal plane at a thickness of 30 μm with a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).\nThen select the sections containing the brain region of LC and excite the fluorescent Neuro-Dil dye by 556 nm laser under the fluorescence microscope."
