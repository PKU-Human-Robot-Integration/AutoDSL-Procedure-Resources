    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Western University of Health Sciences.\n1. Isolation and Expansion of MSCs from Equine Umbilical Cord Matrix\nObtain the placenta from an adult mare (pregnant) after observed foaling and aseptically isolate the umbilical cord from the placenta. Keep the umbilical cord in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) at 4 °C during transfer until processing.\nWash the umbilical cord twice with room temperature PBS with 1% P/S in a 50 mL tube. Section the umbilical cord into 2-inch-long fragments on 150 mm plate and wash in room temperature PBS with 1% P/S in a 50 mL tube two or three times, until most of the blood is rinsed out.\nCut the umbilical cord longitudinally to expose vessels. Remove vessels, including 2 arteries, a vein, and an allantoic stalk from the cord using forceps and scissors. Collect umbilical cord matrix (Wharton's Jelly), which is the jelly-like matrix surrounding vessels, onto a 150 mm plate by scraping with a scalpel, and mince the jelly into fine pieces.\nPlace Wharton's Jelly from 2–3 umbilical cord fragments (approximately 12–15 g) in a 50-mL tube with 15 mL of 0.1% (w/v) collagenase type IA solution in PBS. Incubate at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 3-4 h until dissolved.\nCentrifuge digested tissue at 300 x g for 15 min and aspirate supernatant. Resuspend digested tissue in 15 mL of room temperature PBS with 1% P/S, mix by pipetting, centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min, and aspirate supernatant (wash). Repeat washing twice more.",
    "Resuspend washed cells in 15 mL of room temperature PBS with 1% P/S, mix by pipetting, strain by with 100 µm cell strainer, centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min, and aspirate supernatant.\nPrepare culture medium (CM) by mixing low glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (LG-DMEM) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% P/S. Sterilize the medium by filtration.\nResuspend strained cells in 10 mL of CM pre-warmed to 37 °C, mix by pipetting, transfer into a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask, and incubate in 5% CO2 at 90% humidity and 37.0 °C. Change CM every 3 days until the culture reaches 70–80% confluence, when the culture will be passaged.\nTo passage the culture, aspirate CM from flask, wash with 5 mL of room temperature PBS twice, and detach with 3 mL of 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 °C for 5 min.\nNeutralize trypsin/EDTA with 6 mL of CM pre-warmed to 37.0 °C, mix by pipetting, transfer into a 15 mL tube, centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min, and aspirate supernatant. Resuspend detached cells in 1 mL of CM, mix by pipetting. Count the viable cells using trypan blue and hemocytometer. Re-seed into a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask at 5,000 cells/cm2, and incubate in 5% CO2 at 90% humidity and 37.0 °C.\n2. Preparation of Spheroids with UCM-MSCs Cultured on Chitosan Films\nTo prepare 100 mL of 1% (w/v) chitosan solution, add 1 g of chitosan in 99 mL of distilled water (dH2O), and mix well with a magnetic stirrer.\nAdd 670 µL of glacial acetic acid and continue mixing until chitosan dissolves and becomes viscous. This usually takes 3–4 h.",
    "Add 500 µL of chitosan solution into each well of the 12-well tissue culture plate, and swirl the plate to distribute chitosan solution evenly and cover all of the bottom surface.\nDry the chitosan solution coated plate under laminar flow cabinet without a cover overnight for 24 h. Once dried, thin film will be formed and adhered to plate.\nNeutralize chitosan film by adding 1 mL of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution into each well and incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Aspirate NaOH from each well and wash each well with 1 mL of dH2O three times. Wash each well with 1 mL of 70% ethanol (EtOH) once.\nTo sterilize chitosan film, add 1 mL of 70% EtOH into each well and incubate overnight in laminar flow cabinet. Aspirate remaining EtOH from each well in the following day. Wash each well with 1 mL of sterile PBS three times. Sterilize chitosan film with ultraviolet light under laminar flow cabinet overnight without a cover.\nTo form spheroids of UCM-MSCs, seed expanded and passaged cells into each well at 5,000 cells/cm2, and incubate in 5% CO2 at 90% humidity and 37.0 °C.\n\tNOTE: Cells can be incubated under hypoxia or normoxia, depending on the investigator's interest.\n3. Expression of Surface Markers Analyzed via Flow Cytometry\nPreparation of a single cell suspension\nStandard plate\n\t\t\nRemove medium from each well and wash twice with room temperature PBS.\nDetach cells with 500 µL of a cell dissociation reagent into each well of a 12-well plate for 5–10 min at room temperature.\nAfter incubation, add 1 ml of staining buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA) into each well and mix by pipetting to detach cells.\nTransfer cell suspension into 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min.\nChitosan plate",
    "Collect all spheroids by aspirating medium using a pipette with a 1,000 µL tip. Transfer collected medium into a 15-mL conical tube. After collecting medium, wash well by adding 1 mL of PBS, and transfer washed PBS into the same 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge spheroids at 150 x g for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nAdd 500 µL of the cell dissociation reagent (e.g., accutase) and incubate for 5–10 min at room temperature. Mix by pipetting using a 1 mL tip until spheroids dissociate and are no longer visible.\nAdd 1 mL of staining buffer into the single cell suspension and centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min.\nWashing cells\nRemove the supernatant from the conical tube and re-suspend the cells in 3 mL of cold staining buffer. Keep cells on ice throughout experiment from this step.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min (washing).\nWash twice.\nStaining cells\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nCount viable cells using a trypan blue and hemocytometer. Re-suspend 1 x 106 cells in 50 µL blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% horse serum) and incubate for 30 min on ice.\nAdd 10 µL fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated antibodies (CD44, CD90, CD105, CD34, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, or isotype control for each antibody) and 40 µL of staining buffer, then incubate protected from light for 1 h on ice.\nAdd 3 mL of cold staining buffer and mix, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, and aspirate supernatant (washing).\nRepeat washing twice.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of staining buffer\nAdd 5 µL of 7-AAD (viability dye) and incubate for 30 min on ice",
    "Analyze stained cell samples by flow cytometer. Exclude debris by their smaller SSC and FSC, and identify viable cells with lower uptake of 7-AAD. Plot FL1 and FL2 on the y- and x- axes, respectively. Use isotype control to create a gate above the diagonal line. Measure the percentage of positively stained cells in the area. Count at least 20,000 events/sample (Supplementary Figure 1).\nMeasure the percentage of cells stained with antibodies by gating viable cells and auto-fluorescence, and subtract percentage of cells stained with isotype control.\n4. Bilateral Patellar Tendon Defect Model in the Rat\nSelect Sprague-Dawley rats (adult male, 4–5 months old, body weight 350–375 g). Note the relatively large size of the rats used for this model.\nAnesthetize and apply artificial eye lubricant the rat with 8% sevoflurane in 2 L/min 100% oxygen delivered via mask, until disappearance of pinch-toe reflex in the induction chamber.\nAdminister an intramuscular injection of Meloxicam (1 mg/kg) as preemptive analgesia.\nPlace the rat between two 0.5 L water bottles filled with warm water and covered with a cloth to maintain body temperature and position, while preventing skin injury. Tape each extremity to the table. To reduce risk of hypothermia, cover the body with bubble wrap (Figure 1).\nMaintain anesthesia with continuous flow of 5% sevoflurane in 1 L 100% oxygen mixture via nose cone, with the animal on dorsal recumbency on water heating pad.\nTo avoid skin trauma, do not clip the surgical sites. Instead, apply hair remover cream over both stifles. Use a tongue depressor to remove the cream and hair.\nScrub the surgical site with chlorhexidine digluconate scrub, and rinse with 70% ethanol 3 times.",
    "Incise the skin with a sterile #15 scalpel blade in a proximal to distal direction, on the craniomedial aspect of the stifle. Start the incision about 1 cm proximal to the level of the patella, and extend it approximately 5 mm distal to the tibial tubercle.\nReflect the skin to expose the patellar tendon by freeing the underlying subcutaneous tissue with a #15 scalpel blade.\nUsing the #15 scalpel blade, excise the central third of each patellar tendon (1 mm) from the distal aspect of the patella to the tibial tuberosity.\nAlign a 0.99 mm-diameter Kirschner wire against the tendon as a template to standardize the size of the defect in each limb (Figure 2).\nMake 2 full-thickness incisions on each side of the Kirschner wire with a #15 scalpel blade to isolate the central portion of the tendon (Figure 3). Resect the central section proximally and distally with fine Iris scissors (Figure 4).\nBefore closing the fascia of the stifle, insert the clot (mixed cell suspension and ACP) for the appropriate treatment groups as described in 5.5. Close the fascia with a cruciate pattern and skin with an intradermal pattern using 5-0 polyglactin 910 sutures (Figure 5).\nRepeat the procedure on the contralateral stifle.\n\tNOTE: One defect is randomly assigned to a treatment (stem cells conditioned on chitosan or cultured on standard plates). The contralateral defect is left empty, to serve as internal control.\nAfter surgery, administer 4 tablets of enrofloxacin (2 mg/tablet, orally, once daily) and a tablet of meloxicam (2 mg/tablet, orally, once daily) for 7 days. These doses were recommended by a laboratory animal veterinarian and approved in the IACUC protocol.\n5. Delivery of MSCs within the Patellar Tendon Defect",
    "Anesthetize a healthy rat which is not used for patellar tendon defect creation with 8% sevoflurane in 2 L/min 100 % oxygen delivered via mask, until disappearance of pinch-toe reflex in the induction chamber.\nCollect 5 mL blood by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat (adult male, 4–5 months old, body weight 350–375 g), in a 5 mL syringe with a 20 G needle containing 1 mL of acid-citrate-dextrose (5:1 v/v).\nEuthanize the rat after cardiac puncture and blood collection, by intracardial injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), while under the same anesthesia.\nCentrifuge the sample at 350 x g for 15 min at room temperature. Transfer supernatant and store aliquots (120 µL each) at -20 °C until use.\nImmediately before in vivo implantation, thaw the above aliquot and mix 20 µL with 0.5 x 106 MSCs (from either 1.9 or 3.1.2.1) detached from standard plates using trypsin/EDTA, or collect from chitosan plates by flushing (with PBS/medium).\nAdd 6 µL of 10% calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the remaining 100 µL of thawed plasma in a well of 96-well plate to activate the plasma and induce formation of a clot (activated conditioned plasma: ACP).\nMix cell suspension (20 µL) and ACP (100 µL) to form a clot (Figure 6). Place the clot within the patellar tendon defect created before closing the fascia of the stifle (see step 4.10.3).\n6. Functional Outcome\nMonitor rats twice a day for signs of pain, based on the rat grimace scale (RGS)37,38 and swelling over the implantation sites.\n\tNOTE: A scoring system (0–6) was developed to evaluate ambulatory function based on 3 activities, including timed hind limb standing with forelimbs supported (0-3), timed unassisted hind limb standing (0–2), and the ability to climb a 17 cm plastic cage wall (0–1) (Table 1).",
    "Evaluate rats for the two hind limb standing activities in the morning and in the evening of each time point to calculate an average score.\nEvaluate rats for the ability to successfully climb a 17 cm plastic cage wall with both hind limbs reaching the top.\n7. Gross Appearance and Histopathology of the Patellar Tendon\nEuthanize rats at 7 days (to evaluate inflammation) or 28 days (to evaluate tissue healing) post treatment by intracardial injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) under anesthesia with 8 % sevoflurane and 2 L 100% oxygen delivered via mask.\nHarvest patella-tendon-tibia tuberosity units by scalpel and scissors after euthanasia. Remove soft tissues and ligaments around the stifle, except for the patellar tendon.\nExamine each specimen for gross appearance and thickening of the tendon (Figure 7).\nOrient the specimen by placing a surgeon's knot of 5.0 Polydioxanone on the proximal and lateral aspect of the tendon. Fix each specimen in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution and obtain transverse sections (5 µm) from the mid-portion of each tendon.\nStain the sections using hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson's Trichrome staining following standard protocols.\nExamine section to detect the presence of hematoma within the defect, as well as pathological changes such as inflammation.\nEvaluate the histological score of sections using the previously published scoring system, based on collagen grade, degree of angiogenesis, and cartilage formation (Table 2)39.\nSubscription Required.
