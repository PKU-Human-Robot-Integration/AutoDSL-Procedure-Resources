    "1. Cell Culture\nMaintain human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and additional substrates (10 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mM pyruvate) at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 95% air, 100% humidity).\n\tNOTE: Use the above DMEM formulation when DMEM is referenced in later steps for respirometry and calorimetry.\nPlate the cells at 1 x 106 cells per 100 mm culture plate and subculture them every 7 days or before reaching 90% confluency and renew the medium every 3 - 4 days.\nPerform the experiments when cells are 60 - 80% confluent.\n2. Preparation of Respirometer and Calorimeter\nPipet 2.2 mL of DMEM into the respirometer chamber, insert the stopper fully, and adjust it with the stopper spacer tool to allow for optimal oxygen diffusion from air to medium.\nStir continuously at 37 °C until oxygen concentration (blue trace) and oxygen flux (red trace) are stable. Ensure the respirometer's software is programmed to account for the oxygen solubility of the medium used in the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Different media have different oxygen solubility coefficients (e.g., DMEM = 0.92).\nAfter stabilization of the oxygen concentration in DMEM with the chamber open, select a stable portion of the oxygen concentration trace and calibrate it for 100% air saturation.\nCalibrate for 0% oxygen selecting a stable portion of the oxygen concentration trace when no oxygen is present in the chamber. Perform this step after 20 µL titration of 230 mM sodium dithionite or after all oxygen is consumed by the biological sample at the end of an experiment.\nAfter the 100% air calibration of the respirometer, close the stopper and ensure that no bubbles are present in the chamber.",
    "NOTE: a slight increase in oxygen flux will be detected in the closed chamber as the polarographic oxygen sensor (POS) consumes oxygen in order to measure the oxygen partial pressure.\nAfter ~10 min of the stopper being closed, confirm that the respirometer is ready for HepG2 cells by observing a stable oxygen flux.\n\tNOTE: The calorimeter used here utilizes stainless steel ampules and requires one ampule to be used as a reference.\nAdd 2.5 mL of H2O (dH2O) [equal volume as the samples (step 4)] to the reference ampule of the calorimeter and tighten the cap, using pliers if necessary. Clean the sealed ampule with airflow and slowly lower the ampule to position 1 in the reference channel of the calorimeter. Remain at position 1 until biological sample is prepared.\n3. Preparation of HepG2 Cells for Respirometry and Calorimetry\nConfirm that the respirometer and calorimeter are prepared and calibrated. Warm DMEM and trypsin to 37 °C in a water bath.\nAdd DMEM to a fresh 100-mm plate and place in the incubator to allow for the equilibration of the medium for both CO2 and temperature.\n\tNOTE: This medium will be used for the calorimetry experiment, so the appropriate volume depends on the number of ampules that will be used.\nConfirm with an inverted light microscope that the cells are at 60 - 80% confluent, then wash the 100-mm plate 2x with 10 mL of room temperature phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 3 mL of the 37-°C trypsin to the 100-mm plate of cells and incubate them for 7 - 10 min at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator. Neutralize the trypsin with 3 mL of 37-°C DMEM and suspend by gently pipetting it ~20 times with a 5 mL pipet.",
    "Transfer the 6 mL of resuspended cells in DMEM and trypsin into a sterile 15-mL conical tube and centrifuge it for 5 min at 175 x g. Remove the liquid without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in ~5 mL of DMEM and pipet it thoroughly to ensure the cells are sufficiently dissociated from one another.\nRemove ~100 µL of the well-mixed sample and perform a thorough cell count utilizing all 8 fields on a hemocytometer to determine the total number of cells. Then calculate the volume for resuspension of the cells in order to generate ~2 x 106 cells per 50 µL.\n\tNOTE: This will ensure that 2 x 106 cells are added to each chamber of the respirometer with minimal medium displacement.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 175 x g. Resuspend the pellet in the calculated volume of DMEM from step 3.7.\nPerform a cell count to determine the volume required to inject 2 x 106 cells per chamber in the respirometer (this should be ~50 µL). Store the cells for the respirometric measurement on ice until ready.\nWhile the concentrated cell sample is on ice, determine the dilution required to produce a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL for the calorimetry.\nMix the sample well and prepare ~3 mL of the cells at 1 x 105 cells/mL in DMEM for each ampule.\n\tNOTE: The DMEM used for the sample dilution should be the equilibrated medium prepared in step 3.3.\n4. Calorimetry\nEnsure that calorimeter is connected to the computer and the calorimetric signal in µW is observable and stable.",
    "Add 2.5 mL of the cells at 1 x 105 cells/mL (~2.5 x 105 cells) to each ampule, ensuring sufficient air is between the lid of the ampule and the medium to allow for gas diffusion.\nImmediately tighten the cap, using pliers if necessary. Clean the sealed ampule, using airflow to remove any external debris, and slowly lower the ampule to position 1 of the calorimeter. Record the time the ampule is lowered to position 1.\nAllow the ampule to sit at position 1 for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: During this 15 min period, cells are to be injected into the respirometer (step 5). This ensures that the same interval of time is used for both heat production and oxygen consumption when the CR ratio is determined.\nAfter 15 min at position 1, slowly lower both the reference and sample ampules to position 2. Record the time the ampules were lowered and measure for at least 30 min.\n5. Respirometry\nDuring the 15-min interval in which the ampule is at position 1 in the calorimeter, begin the respirometric studies.\nThoroughly mix the cell sample by pipetting to ensure a homogenous solution and inject <50 µL of the cell sample into each chamber of the respirometer for a final concentration of ~2 x 106 cells/chamber. Record the time the cells are injected into the respirometer.\nAfter the injection, the HepG2 cells are continuously stirred at 37 °C. Wait at least 20 - 30 min for both a stabilization of the oxygen flux and a steady decrease in the oxygen concentration.",
    "Select the O2 flux per V tab on the right of the screen and highlight a stable portion of oxygen flux. Select marks, then statistics and record data for O2 flux per V. This recording will be used in calculation of the CR ratio.\n\tNOTE: Steps 5.5 and 5.6 are optional. Leak respiration and maximal uncoupled respiration will be revealed by titrations of oligomycin and FCCP.\nInject 1 µL of 4mg/mL oligomycin into each chamber and allow ~ 10 min for oxygen flux stabilization. Record stable leak respiration rate by following steps performed in 5.4 by highlighting a stable portion of the oxygen flux trace after oligomycin addition.\nTitrate 2-µL injections of 0.2 mM FCCP into each chamber, allowing for oxygen flux stabilization after each injection. Continue the titrations until the maximal flux is reached, as indicated by a slight decline in the subsequent FCCP titration. Record the stable respiration rate during the maximal flux.\n6. Calculation of Calorespirometric Ratio\nPerform a final cell count of the samples prepared at ~ 1 x 105 cells/mL utilizing all 8 fields of a hemocytometer to determine the total number of cells added to the ampule (2.5 mL).\nDetermine a time to record measurements from both calorimeter and respirometer at which stable signals are present at identical times. Reference the time recorded when the ampule was lowered to position 2 and the time of injection of cells into the respirometer.\nRecord the heat production by placing the cursor over the trace displaying heat output for the respected ampule at the time determined in step and express as µW/million cells. Collect oxygen consumption data and ensure that it is expressed as pmol O2 x s-1 x million cells.",
    "To calculate the CR ratio, first convert µW to kJ/s, and then divide kJ/s over mol of O2/s to obtain the CR ratio expressed as kJ/mol O2. NOTE: The CR ratio is presented in kJ/mol O2.\n\t(see Supplementary FIle 1[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57724/JoVE_Supplemental_File.docx])\nSubscription Required.
