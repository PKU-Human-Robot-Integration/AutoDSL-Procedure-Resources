    "1. Assessment Guidelines Prior to Placement\nPrior to insertion, assess rectal opening for contraindications which include:\n\tlesions, tumors, abscesses, rectal bleeding, diarrhea or recent bowel surgery (less than 6 weeks).\nAssess rectum for stool by performing a digital rectal exam prior to placement.\n\tNOTE: It is best if the rectum is empty, however, formed stool in the rectum is not a contraindication for use.\n2. Insertion of the Device\nLubricate catheter from the tip to the blue marker line with water-soluble lubricant.\nInsert the catheter into the rectum to the blue marker line between the two blue arrows.\nInflate balloon with Luer syringe by injecting 15 mL water or saline.\nGently tug catheter to assure balloon is positioned against the rectal sphincter.\nPosition catheter between the legs and secure to the anterior aspect of the patient's thigh or lower abdomen with a catheter-securing device.\n3. Medication Preparation and Administration\nPulverize solid forms of medications.\nAdd 10 - 20 mL water to pulverized medication to produce a microenema suspension.\nPull microenema suspension into enteral syringe and inject quickly into catheter port over about 3 - 5 sec.\n\tNOTE: For medication already in liquid form, Step 3.1 and 3.2 are not necessary.\nQuick-flush the Medication Administration Port (over less than one sec) with 3 mL of water using a 3 mL enteral syringe.\n4. Hydration (Proctoclysis Procedure)\nAdminister hypotonic solutions only (water, 0.2% Normal Saline, 0.5% Normal Saline, etc.).\nAdminister bolus fluids using a large (45 or 60 mL) enteral syringe at a rate of about 60 mL over 15 - 30 sec.",
    "NOTE: A hydration infusion via the catheter may be done using a gravity tube feeding bag which attaches readily to the medication port on the Macy Catheter. Infusion at rates of up to 250 - 400 mL/h have been shown to be well tolerated.7\n5. Catheter Removal\nRemove the catheter before defecation. The catheter can remain in the rectum for up to 28 days.\n\tNOTE: The catheter is easily expelled with defecation and will not inhibit the passing of stool.\nTo remove the catheter deflate balloon with a Luer syringe. Attach 20 mL Luer syringe to balloon inflation valve and gently withdraw the 15 mL water from the balloon. Remove gently from the rectum.\n\tNOTE: Contraindication for use. Do not use the catheter for patients with rectal lesions, tumors, active rectal bleeding or recent bowel surgery (less than 6 weeks). Do not use if rectal mucosa is compromised (ulcers or ischemic proctitis). Do not use for patients with diarrhea."
