    "All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC) at Mayo Clinic.\n1. Design and Analysis of a 2205 Stainless Steel Stent\nDesigning a bare metal stent using CAD\n\t\nMake an extruded hollow cylinder by selecting on ‘extruded boss/base’ feature with the wall thickness equal to the stent strut thickness.\nDesign a stent pattern on a different sketch plane tangential to the extruded cylinder. Make the width of the flat pattern to match the circumference of the extruded hollow cylinder.\nTransfer the flat pattern design onto the hollow cylinder using the wrap feature.\nSave the part in its native format and also in ACIS format to be exported for FEA.\nFinite element analysis for stent models\n\t\nImport the solid geometry saved in ACIS format into the part module of the FEA software for further analysis.\nModel 2 analytical cylinders coaxially to the stent in the part modeler of the FEA software. The outer cylinder has an initial diameter larger than the diameter of the stent to simulate the crimper and the inner cylinder has an initial diameter of 1 mm to simulate a balloon for inflation.\nDouble click on the ‘instances’ tree item of the assembly modeler to assemble the above said parts in relative positions.\nUse the mesh module of the FEA software, specify the element type as 20-node hexahedral element with reduced integration, specify the element size, and mesh the stent.\nSpecify frictionless rigid contact pairs between the stent and the two cylinders respectively in the ‘interaction properties’ of the model tree.\nAssign elasto-plastic stress-strain behavior of 2205 stainless steel to the stent model.",
    "Define boundary conditions to firstly crimp the outer cylinder to 1 mm which simulates the crimping of the stent. Remove the outer cylinder to simulate the relaxation of the crimped stent. Expand the inner cylinder to 3 mm to simulate expansion and finally, remove the inner cylinder to simulate recoil of the stent.\nDefine the simulation parameters including the number of processors and amount of RAM allocated in the ‘Analysis’ model tree item and run the simulation.\nOnce the simulation is complete, open the result file (filename.odb) and post-process the results to study the principal strains and iteratively improve the stent design to achieve a principal strain of 20% which is less than the failure limit of the material.\n2. Stent Fabrication and Testing for Crimping and Expansion\nStent fabrication\n\t\nObtain the 2205 stainless steel tubes by gun drilling and precision grinding bar stock material at a precision machining company such as Action Precision Products in Pioneer, OH.\nTransfer the precision ground tubes and the flat pattern stent design to a stent cutting company such as Laserage Technology Corporation in Waukegan, IL for laser cutting and electropolishing.\nPassivate the surface of the electropolished stents by submersing them in a strong acid (50% HCl) for 10 min followed by a base (10% NaHCO3) for another 10 min. CAUTION: handle chemicals with proper protective equipment and under a fume hood. Finally, wash the stents with ethyl alcohol and deionized water. This process is called acid pickling.\nTesting of manufactured stent for crimping and expansion\n\t\nCrimp the stent onto a trifold balloon using a hand held crimping tool. Hold the stent and the trifold balloon in the crimping tool. Press the handle to radially deform the stent to be crimped on the balloon.",
    "Inspect the crimped stent using a microscope for uniform crimping and any signs of failure in the structure due to plastic deformation.\nExpand it to the designed diameter of 3 mm by pressurizing the trifold balloon with water. Examine the expanded stents for microscopic fractures and uniform expansion.\n3. Characterization of Stent for Retained Magnetic Field\nNOTE: Cylindrical magnet of 2 inch diameter and 1 inch height was used in this study. The poles of the magnet are aligned along the axis. The surface magnetic flux density of the magnet is approximately 1 T.\nMagnetize the stents diametrically or axially using a strong neodymium magnet.  Hold the stent close to the strong magnet for approximately 1 min for magnetization.\nHold the stent on one of the flat faces with its diameter along the magnetic field lines to be magnetized diametrically or hold the stent next to the cylindrical surface with its axis along the magnetic field lines to magnetize it axially. Retained magnetic field of the stent was found to be stable for at least 24 hr, but use the stent as soon as possible after magnetization.\nMount the stents individually onto glass mandrels and then mount the glass mandrels in the precision chuck of the magnetic probing fixture. Magnetic microsensor probe can be precisely positioned close to the stent without touching the surface using the XYZ stages assembly of the magnetic probing fixture (Figure 4).\nMeasure the baseline reading of the magnetic microsensor far away from the stent and then measure the retained magnetic field at the stent's surface by positioning the probe using the XYZ stages of the magnetic probing fixture.\n4. Magnetic Cell Capture Studies\nObtaining cells, labeling with SPION and staining with fluorescent dye",
    "Derive the endothelial outgrowth cells (EOC) from porcine peripheral blood as described in5,7. Culture in a T-75 flask until approximately 80% confluent (5x106 to 8x106 cells).\nSynthesize SPIONs as 10 nm diameter magnetite (Fe3O4) core surrounded by 50 nm thick poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) shell as described in 8,9.\nIncubate the derived EOC with SPION at a concentration of 200 µg/ml of cell culture medium for 16 hr at 37 oC.\nAspirate the cell culture medium gently. Gently wash the cells by adding 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the flask, rocking, and aspirating the PBS.\nStain the cells with fluorescent dye (CM-DiI) for visualizing during experiments. This is done per the manufacturer’s instructions by adding the dye to 10 ml of cell culture medium at a concentration of 5 µl/ml and incubating with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWash the cells with PBS as in step 4.1.4 and incubate with 3 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C to lift the cells from the flask.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube, top off with PBS, and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min to form a cell pellet.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in PBS at a concentration of 1-2x106 cells/ml and mix thoroughly by pipetting in and out of the conical tube several times.\nIn-vitro cell studies\n\t\nDesign and fabricate (e.g., 3D printing) a simple fixture to hold the stent just above the surface of a glass coverslip.\nDemagnetize a stent using an electromagnetic degausser or magnetize a stent diametrically or axially using a strong neodymium magnet.",
    "Pipette the SPION-labeled EOC suspended in PBS into the dish containing the axially magnetized or diametrically magnetized or non-magnetized control stents. Image the stents with EOC suspended in PBS immediately for fluorescence using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n5. In-vivo Animal Studies\nStent implantation\n\t\nDraw peripheral blood from 4 healthy Yorkshire pigs – weighing approximately 50 kg – 3 weeks prior to stent implantation respectively and culture EOC as described in 5,7.\nAdminister anti-platelet medication starting 3 days prior to surgery (aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily).\nOn the stent implantation day, anesthetize the pigs with intramuscular Telazol, Xylazine, and Atropine (5/2-3/0.05 mg/kg respectively) as stated in the applicable institutional animal care and use guidelines.\nIntubate and place the pig on inhalation of 1-2.5% Isoflurane anesthesia.\nShave the ventral neck region of the pig and conduct the procedure in general sterile conditions.\nImplant 1 magnetized and 1 non-magnetized stent into the right coronary artery (RCA) using standard cardiac catheterization technique.\n\t\t\nCatheterization of animals should be performed by a trained interventional cardiologist. Access the right carotid artery with a 9 French sheath.\nCannulate the target coronary artery and inject iodinated contrast dye to obtain fluoroscopic images.\nPlace a 0.014 inch standard coronary guidewire in the artery. Advance the balloon and stent using this guide wire and deploy the stent in a 3-3.5 mm diameter vessel.\nOcclude the blood flow within the RCA proximal to the implanted stents using an over the wire balloon and deliver approximately 2x106 autologous EOC labeled with SPION suspended in 4 ml of PBS via the central catheter over a 2 min period.\nRestore blood flow to the RCA after 2 min of additional occlusion.\nTransfer the animal to the recovery room and closely monitor the animal until it has regained consciousness.",
    "Continue to administer anti-platelet medication (aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg) post operatively until sacrifice.\nStent explant and histology\n\t\nEuthanize the animals 7 days after surgery by first anesthetizing the animal as explained previously and then administer intravenously a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) as per applicable institutional animal care and use guidelines.\nSurgically harvest the stented arterial segments. Fix the explanted arteries in 10% formalin buffer for a minimum of 30 min. Leave the samples in formalin buffer for further histological analysis.\nOutsource the fixed sample to facilities capable of performing histology with metal stents. During this processing, the samples are embed in methylmethacrylate, cross-sectioned, and analyzed histologically using Mallory’s staining technique with Prussian blue stain for iron particles.\nSubscription Required.
