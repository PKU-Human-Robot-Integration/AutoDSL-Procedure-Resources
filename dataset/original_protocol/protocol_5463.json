    "Seed sterilization and germination   Surface sterilize A. thaliana seeds (~5 mg) in a 2 ml tube with 70% ethanol (EtOH) by vortexing the tube for 2 min. Discard the EtOH with an adjustable micropipette (1,000 µl) and wash seeds twice with DSW. All the steps were performed under a laminar flow hood to ensure aseptic conditions throughout.   Add 50% Bleach containing 0.1% Tween-20 to the seeds and sterilize for 10 min with vigorous shaking. Once complete, decant Bleach with a 1,000 µl micropipette (Figure 1A).   Rinse the seeds for five times with DSW to remove any residue of Bleach.   Post-sterilization process, add 0.1% agarose (previously autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C) to seeds for ease of handling.   Using a micropipette (1,000 µl), place ~4 seeds per drop aligned in a row leaving ~1 inch distance from the top end of square Petri-dishes (Figures 1B and 1C) containing MS based seed germination medium (SGM, see Recipes). Double wrap the Petri-dishes using Parafilm.   Incubate the Petri-dishes vertically in a stand (to ensure elongated root formation) in a CT (controlled temperature) room set at 24 °C, 16 h light ~4,000 lux photoperiod and 8 h dark for 15-20 days (Figure 1D).   Root harvesting should be achieved before roots reach the end of dish, at which stage ~20 segments of < 0.5 cm length each should be obtained per plant.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170920/20170920225858_5093.jpg Figure 1.

    "adhaerens OV14_pCambia5105 (here onwards E5105) on a TTY agar (see Recipes) containing 100 mg/L kanamycin, 200 mg/L streptomycin and 200 mg/L spectinomycin to select for the unitary plasmid containing T-DNA as well as virulence (vir) genes, overnight at 28 °C (Figure 2A).   Pick a single colony to inoculate 10 ml TTY broth containing appropriate antibiotics (100 mg/L kanamycin, 200 mg/L streptomycin and spectinomycin) in a sterile conical flask and grow overnight at 28 °C and 220 rpm to reach 0.8 OD600 nm (Figures 2B and 2C).   Pellet the cells in 50 ml Falcon tubes by centrifugation and wash them using 0.9% NaCl to remove any antibiotic residues. Centrifuge bacterial cultures at 3,750 x g (rcf) for 25-30 min for the inoculum preparation. Re-suspend the cells in 0.9% NaCl to maintain 0.8 OD600 nm (Figure 2D).   Add 200 µM acetosyringone and incubate at 28 °C, 220 rpm for additional 1.5 h to induce virulence.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170920/20170920230044_7355.jpg Figure 2. Steps involved in preparing E5105 cultures for transfection of root segments. A.

E5105 resuspended in 0.9% NaCl and supplemented with 200 µM acetosyringone for vir induction at 28 °C, 1.5 h.      Preparation and transfection of A. thaliana root segments   Separate the A. thaliana roots from plants using a sterile scalpel blade before laying roots down on a Petri-dish containing a small amount (~500 µl) of DSW to ensure adequate root hydration (Figures 3A and 3B).   Align roots together and cut into 0.3 to 0.5 cm long segments (Figure 3C).",
    "Place bundles of ~30 root segments on MS based co-cultivation medium (CCM, see Recipes) containing 200 µM acetosyringone.   Using a P1000 pipette place 2-3 drops of E5105 on each the A. thaliana root bundle and allow a transfection time of 10 min (Figure 3D). Untreated root segments (no bacteria) should be used as a negative control.    Remove any excess bacterial solution after the 10 min transfection time using the P1000 pipette. Double wrap the Petri-dishes with Parafilm.   Co-culture the bacteria and A. thaliana roots at 20 °C, in the dark for 5 days.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170920/20170920230210_5377.jpg Figure 3.

Transient GUS expression assay   Post 5 days co-cultivation; wash treated/untreated root segments in DSW containing 500 mg/L cefotaxime to mitigate bacterial overgrowth.    GUS staining: The activity of β-glucuronidase in putative transgenic root segments is performed as described by Jefferson et al. (1987) using one of two ways:   For faster results, the washed roots are treated in GUS stain solution (see Recipes) with an overnight incubation at 37 °C. To remove the excess stain, wash root segments in 90% (v/v) ethanol (Figures 4A and 4B).   To allow further proliferation of root segments and to facilitate ease of handling, transfer the roots onto callus induction medium (CIM, see Recipes) containing 250 mg/L cefotaxime. Seal the plates with Parafilm and incubate for additional 5-6 days at 24 °C in the dark, before staining in GUS stain solution, overnight at 37 °C (Figures 4C and 4D).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170920/20170920230418_5578.jpg Figure 4.
