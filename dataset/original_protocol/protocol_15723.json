    "The experimental design and animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Penn State University College of Medicine. Adult C57BL/6J male mice, 10-week-old, weighing 20-25 g, were used for the studies. Animals were housed at the animal facility under sterile animal management conditions, and they were acclimatized at least 5 days before conducting the studies.\n1. Animal preparation\nAnesthetize the animals deeply using a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection using a 26 G needle.\nShave the animals' right hind limb and lower back using a trimmer and then clean with alcohol prepped with 10% povidone-iodine solution using sterile cotton-tipped applicators (see Table of Materials).\nApply ophthalmic lubricant ointment to the eyes using sterile cotton-tipped applicators to avoid dryness of the eyes.\nAfter prepping, place the animals on a homeothermic heating pad (see Table of Materials) to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C.\nTape the mice's hind limbs on the heating pad and carefully position them symmetrically so that the knee joint makes a right angle with the body.\nSterilize all the surgical tools by autoclaving and then place them on the sterile pad.\n\t​NOTE: The surgeon must wear a sterile mask, gown, and gloves before conducting surgeries.\n2. Traumatic Peripheral Nerve Injury (TPNI) model generation\nAfter preparation, make a lateral skin incision (~2 cm) along the length of the femur using a scissor and a precision stereo zoom binocular microscope (see Table of Materials).\nBluntly expose the sciatic nerve (SN) through the iliotibial band using dissecting scissors and microsurgical forceps. Avoid any iatrogenic mechanical damage to the SN.\nClose the skin with surgical staples after TPNI surgeries (steps 4-9). Administer slow-release buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials) subcutaneously to all the animals as an analgesic.",
    "Perform Sciatic Nerve Crush Injury (SNCI) following the steps below.\n\t\nPosition the SN approximately 3 mm proximal to the trifurcation in the flat shape between the forceps tips (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Extreme care needs to be taken to avoid misshapen position, which brings variations in the experimental results between animals/groups.\nPerform the SNCI using calibrated forceps and custom aluminum jigs (Figure 1C)31,35 to result in a specific pressure over a fixed width (3.5 mm).\n\t\tNOTE: The details of the digital pressure sensor device for SNCI using calibrated forceps and custom boring jigs are mentioned in our previously published reports31,35. Custom jigs were made by boring holes in small pieces of aluminum. These jigs are confirmed to produce specific pressures using a digital pressure sensor, using parts and specifications publicly available and described previously31,35.\nAfter positioning, push the jig gently to reach the block on the forceps, and after 30 s, slowly release the jig and confirm the injury by the altered structure of the nerve (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: The structural alterations of the nerve confirm the degree of injury severity. This can be verified using microscopy in trial cases.\nAfter SNCI, burry the nerve between the muscles carefully to avoid iatrogenic injury by a surgeon.\n\t\tNOTE: The crush injuries caused by calibrated forceps were exact, reliable, and reproducible, which was established using precision pinch pressure sensor device31 (Figure 1D). The time course of real-time crush injury pressure by different jig with forceps is depicted in Figure 2A,B.\nPerform Transection and Glue (TG).\n\t\nTransect the SN completely ~3 mm proximal to the SN trifurcation using dissecting scissors.",
    "After transection, repair the nerve gap instantly by applying 10 µL of fibrin glue (see Table of Materials) around the transection site to limit further displacement of the severed nerve ends. The clotting time of fibrin glue was ~15 s.\n\t\tNOTE: SN gap was uncontrolled and haphazard after transection because of retraction, which might be a variable for the resulting outcome.\nPerform Stepwise Transection and Glue (STG).\n\t\nTransect the SN incompletely (80% of its width) ~3 mm proximal to the SN trifurcation using dissecting scissors preventing gap formation.\nNext, apply 10 µL of fibrin glue around the cut site and completely transect the remaining 20% of the nerve before complete clotting (~10 s) of the glue.\n\t\tNOTE: This method effectively diminished the gap formation caused by the elastic retraction of the cut nerve ends, but it was also free from additional surgical manipulation to the nerve, unlike the TG model (Figure 3A).\nPerform Flip and Transection with Glue (FTG).\n\t\nFirst, transect the SN to 40% of its width from each side (Figure 3B).\nTransversely flip the distal stump and apply 10 µL of fibrin glue around the transection site.\nNext, completely transect the central 20% nerve before complete clotting (~10 s) of fibrin glue.\nConfirm the complete transection under a direct microscope.\nPerform gap and grafting of nerve following the steps below.\n\t\nIn a graded nerve gap and grafting model, use pairs of mice in series for cascade syngeneic nerve grafting32 in 1 set of experiments.\nIn a mouse (say, mouse #1), create a 7 mm (G-7/0) nerve gap on the right SN, where the nerve was dissected ~3 mm proximal to the SN trifurcation and 7 mm distance away from this using a sterile graduated scale (Figure 3C).",
    "NOTE: An irreparable nerve gap was created by dissecting a 7 mm sciatic nerve without grafting. This mouse is labeled G-7/0 because a 7mm graft is taken, but no repair is performed.\nAfter dissection, immediately transfer the transected nerve to the sterile condition of the Petri dish containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and bury the proximal stump of the SN (mouse #1) underneath the muscle with 10 µL of fibrin glue.\nNext, in mouse #2, create a 5 mm nerve gap on the right SN and graft the 7 mm dissected nerve section from mouse #1 using fibrin glue (10 µL, ~10 s) at both ends (G-5/7) (Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: While grafting, special care needs to be taken to avoid misalignments and other iatrogenic injuries of the SN by the surgeon.\nPerform Stepwise Transection and Sutures (STS).\n\t\nSevere the sciatic nerve along 80% of its width (Figure 3D), and repair the stumps using epineural stitches of 9-0 nylon.\nAfter completion, severe the remaining portion of the nerve and repair using a single 9-0 nylon stitch.\nInvert the nerve to expose the backside of the laceration, and use two 9-0 nylon stitches to complete the repair.\nSubscription Required.
