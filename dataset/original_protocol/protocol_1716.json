In case you want to use the saliva for bacterial quantification or RT-PCR analysis, make sure to use sterile equipment.\nTake a 0.5 mL tube and remove the lid using scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1304-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Saliva collection without pilocarpine injection\n(A) Remove the 0.5 mL tube lid.\n(B) Use the 16-gauge needle to make a hole in the bottom of the 0.5 mL tube.\n(C) Place the 0.5 mL tube in the 2 mL tube.\n(D) Use the collection swab to collect saliva.\n(E) Place the collection swab in the 0.5 mL tube and cut the holder.\nUsing a 16-gauge needle, perforate the bottom of the 0.5 mL tube and place it in a 2.0 mL centrifuge tube (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nNote: It is better to prepare the equipment and materials before performing the protocol.\nCritical: Be careful, if the gauge slips, it can cause a serious injury.\nHold the mouse with one hand, and with the other hand, use the collection swab to collect saliva from the oral cavity by moving the swab for 30 s, make sure to reach all areas - buccal and beneath the tongue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: for bacterial quantification, make sure the swab does not touch anything but the oral cavity.\nTake the swab out, place it in the perforated 0.5 mL tube in the 2 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nSeal the tube using parafilm and place it on ice while collecting other samples to prevent the saliva from drying.",
    "After sampling the mice, remove the parafilm and centrifuge at 8000 g for 3 min while the 2 mL tube lid is open.\nTake the 0.5 mL tube with the swab out, the saliva is in the bottom of the 2 mL tube.\nCollection of saliva after stimulation with pilocarpine\nTiming: ∼ 45 min for 5 mice\nNote: Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], prepare sponge pieces to collect saliva, cut a sponge into small pieces to a cylinder shape with a diameter of 0.5 cm and 1.5 cm height or boxes of the same size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1304-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Saliva collection with pilocarpine stimulation\n(A and G) Lay the mouse on its side after the injection of anesthesia and pilocarpine.\n(B and H) Open the mouth of the mouse with forceps.\n(C, D, and I) Hold the mouth open, use forceps to place the sponge in the oral cavity.\n(E and J) Wait 15 min for the sponge to absorb the saliva.\n(F) Remove the sponge and place it in the 0.5 mL tube for centrifugation.\nAnesthetize the mouse by injecting the mice intraperitoneally (IP injection) with 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) – approximately 200–300 μL of anesthesia solution per mouse, and wait 3–4 min until the mouse is fully anesthetized. Verify that the mouse is well anesthetized.\nInject the mouse with pilocarpine, IP injection of 0.375 mg/kg BW.\nNote: It is important to follow the recommended concentrations/quantities of pilocarpine precisely as a slight overdose in addition to the anesthesia may be lethal. We found this protocol suitable for mice that are older than 2 weeks.\nIt takes 2–3 min for the pilocarpine to induce saliva secretion, in the meantime, lay the mouse on its side to avoid choking from excess saliva (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2G).",
    "Use a curved forceps to open the mouth of the mouse, and with another forceps, insert the sponge in a way that fills up the oral cavity. Make sure the sponge is stable and not inserted too deep (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2E and 2H–2J).\nCritical: If the sponge is inserted too deep it may cause suffocation. Do not use sharp forceps.\nSet timer for 15 min, keep an eye on the mouse, move the mouse/sponge if it shows any signs of suffocating.\nUsing forceps, take the sponge out of the oral cavity and place it in the perforated 0.5 mL tube. Place the tube in a 2 mL tube, seal it with parafilm, and place it on ice so the saliva will not dry out (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nDo the same to the rest of the mice.\nAfter taking all sponges out of the mice, remove the parafilm and centrifuge the tubes at 8000 g for 3 min while the 2 mL lid is open.\nAt the end of centrifugation, saliva should be at the bottom of the 2 mL tube. You can now measure the volume of the saliva.\nKeep the mice warm using a warming light until they are fully awake from anesthesia.\nMeasuring volume/weight of saliva\nTiming: ∼ 5 min for each tube\nFor measuring the weight of the saliva, it is recommended to use a sterile 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nLabel each 2 mL tube and measure its weight while empty before saliva collection.\nAfter collecting saliva, take the perforated 0.5 mL tube with the sponge out.\nClose the 2 mL tube and weigh again with the saliva inside.\nCalculate the net weight of the saliva.\nFor measuring the volume of the saliva\nAfter centrifugation, remove the 0.5 mL tube with the sponge out.",
    "If pilocarpine was used, use a pipettor, set it to a large volume of liquid (100–150 μL for instance), pull out all liquid, and then set again the pipettor to a smaller volume until the liquid reaches the margin of the tip. This is the volume of the saliva.\nIf pilocarpine was not used, the amount of saliva might be too little and viscous for direct measurement. Therefore, dilute the saliva with a known amount of PBS (100 μL for instance), collect the sample as described in the preceding step (step 23). Calculate the saliva volume by subtracting from the volume indicated by the pipettor the volume of the PBS.\nParotid gland extraction surgery (parotidectomy)\nTiming: ∼ 45 min per mouse\nNote: While this study focuses on the parotid glands, it’s worth mentioning that the submandibular glands produce the majority of saliva under physiological conditions. The submandibular glands were also reported to play an important immunological role.\nBefore performing the surgery for the first time, practice the procedure on a cadaver.\nAnesthetize the mouse by IP injection with 200 mg/kg BW (approximately 200–300 μL of anesthesia solution per mouse).\nAfter verifying the mouse is well anesthetized, fix the mouse on a clean platform using duct tape placed on the limbs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and G).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1304-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Parotid salivary gland extraction surgery\n(A and G) Fix the limbs of the anesthetized mouse to perform with duct tape.\n(B and H) Find the appropriate position to reach the wanted area.\n(C and I) Make a horizontal incision under the ear lobe.\n(D and J) Pull the parotid gland out with forceps.\n(E and K) Separate the gland from the surrounding tissues with a scalpel.\n(L) Pull the gland and watch for the blood vessel.",
    "(F and M) Close the wound with surgical sutures.\nShave a 1 cm × 0.5 cm area right under the mouse ear lobe using an electric pet shaver (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H). Disinfect the area with 70% medical ethanol.\nMake a 4 mm horizontal incision on the skin placed 1–2 mm below the ear lobe to expose the glands underneath (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, 3C, and 3I).\nNote: There are two similar glands in this area: the posterior is the parotid gland, while the anterior is the extraorbital lacrimal gland. We recommend locating both glands to make sure the removal is performed on the parotid gland.\nAfter identifying the parotid gland, use the curved forceps to pull the gland out, use a scalpel to separate the gland from the surrounding tissue (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, 3E, and 3J–3K). Cut the gland out right beneath the lower margin of the gland (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L). Bleeding is unlikely unless a blood vessel was accidently ruptured.\nNote: Beware of cutting the external/common carotid artery.\nClose the wound by a simple skin suture technique using a sterile vicryl surgical suture (three sutures should be enough) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3M).\nTreat the mouse with painkillers, IP injection of 100 μL Carprofen solution.\nRelease the mouse and put it back in the cage. Keep all the mice warm after surgery under a warming light. Wait for the mice to awake from the anesthesia and make sure they are moving just fine.\nWatch the behavior of the mice and their ability to eat food and drink water on the following days."
