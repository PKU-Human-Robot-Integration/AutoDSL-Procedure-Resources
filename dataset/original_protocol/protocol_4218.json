    "Determine the number of animals that will be injected with the GFP-MSCs and the number of cells that will be required. Note: We have successfully injected 1-3 x 106 GFP-MSCs per animal to achieve the desired results.    Expand the GFP-MSCs in CCM from low-density seeding (100-300 cells/cm2) for 6-7 days. Upon reaching 70% confluence, harvest the GFP-MSCs using trypsin/EDTA then collect the cells by centrifugation at 450 x g for 5-7 min. Note: Proper MSC culture method is detailed in references below. It is important to prevent MSC cultures from becoming confluent. If necessary, the MSCs can be passaged to avoid the formation of confluent cultures.    Aspirate the supernatant and suspend the GFP-MSC pellet in a low volume of CCM for cell counts. Note: A viability dye such as trypan blue is recommended to discriminate between live and dead cells. GFP-MSCs are typically greater than 95% viable.   After counting the cells, add up to 45 ml HBSS to the cells and centrifuge at 450 x g for 5-7 min.   Aspirate the supernatant and suspend the cells in HBSS at a concentration of 5,000-10,000 viable cells per µl.   With the mouse under isoflurane anesthesia, inject 200-300 µl of GFP-MSCs (1-3 x 106 cells) from the cell suspension into the peritoneal cavity using a 29 gauge needle. Notes:   For optimal MSC viability, do not mix the cell suspension with the needle. Instead, mix cells using a pipet or simply by flicking the vial.   Intraperitoneal injections should be performed following procedures set forth by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or equivalent.     Immediately following GFP-MSC injection, disperse the cells within the peritoneum by gently massaging the abdomen for 5-10 sec. Note: To massage the abdomen, gently press on the abdomen with 1 or 2 fingers.",
    "Start from an area in close proximity to the injection site and progress distally. Do not press forcefully to avoid causing trauma to the internal organs.   Repeat procedure with additional mice.   Accommodate the mice for 4-72 h on a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and with standard nutrition. Notes:   Aggregates collected at 72 h are compact and often adhere to the tissues making them more difficult to obtain. Aggregates collected at earlier time points are less compact and more abundant.   Aggregates collected from the peritoneum will vary in size and number. MSC aggregates typically range in size from several hundreds of microns to 2-3 mm in diameter although smaller aggregates composed of fewer cells can be obtained. The number of aggregates that can be collected from the peritoneum gradually decreases with time. Following injection of 1-3 x 106 GFP-MSCs, 15-30 aggregates can be obtained at 4 h, 10-15 aggregates at 24 h, and less than 10 aggregates at 72 h.     After 4-72 h, anesthetize the mouse by isoflurane inhalation then euthanize the animal by cervical dislocation.  Note: Other methods of euthanasia can be performed however it is not recommended to use a method that introduces fluid into the peritoneum.   Using dissecting pins stabilize the euthanized mouse on a rubber or styrofoam platform (ventral side up).   Expose the peritoneal cavity using dissecting forceps and scissors (Figure 2). Avoid disturbing the internal organs or cell aggregates.   Visualize the GFP signal using a dissecting microscope with an epi-fluorescence attachment and appropriate filter set (Figure 2). Note: The localization of the aggregates can be variable between animals. Under some circumstances, visualization of aggregates requires careful repositioning of the internal organs.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140716/20140716185805_0403.jpg Figure 2.

    "Images of the mouse peritoneal cavity uncovered to reveal the (A) internal organs and (B) GFP-MSC aggregates. (C) Magnified view of a GFP-MSC aggregate (arrow) in the peritoneum of a BALB/c mouse 4 h after intraperitoneal injection of 2 x 106 GFP-MSCs.    Collect the aggregates using forceps and transfer to a 50 ml tube containing ice cold HBSS. Notes:   Due to surface tension, the aggregates adhere readily to the forceps without the need to squeeze the forceps around the cells.   Aggregate formation by MSCs in the peritoneal cavity is not the only fate of the cells.  MSCs will adhere to certain structures of the peritoneum. Free floating aggregates can be distinguished from adherent cells with careful examination. Moreover, the peritoneum can be washed repeatedly with 1-2 ml HBSS to distinguish the free floating aggregates that often reposition during the wash from adherent cells that will not move.     After collecting the GFP-MSC aggregates of interest, make certain that most of the cells descended to the bottom of the tube. Note: Aggregates connected to fatty tissue will remain in suspension and can be removed by careful aspiration. Aggregates that are void of fatty tissue will rapidly fall to the bottom of the tube.     Aspirate the HBSS supernatant to remove cell aggregates containing fatty tissue while avoiding contact with the cell pellet.   Wash the cells in HBSS and collect aggregates by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min.   Aspirate the supernatant. The aggregates are now prepared for downstream applications and analysis. For analyzing changes in gene and protein expression, the cell pellet can by lysed in appropriate lysis solution. Alternatively, aggregates can be transferred to a cell culture dish (Figure 3) or to a cryomold and frozen for immunofluorescence applications.",
    "MSC aggregates can also be dissociated using trypsin/EDTA and analyzed by microscopy (Figure 4) or flow cytometry. Other applications have not been tested.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140716/20140716185826_2407.jpg Figure 3. Transfer of GFP-MSC aggregates in vitro.

Small round cells (GFP negative) are also obtained from peritoneal aggregates. The majority of the small round cells are host immune cells.  Scale bar = 100 µm"
