    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCommon behavioral methods for humans and monkeys\nTiming: 2–12 months\nUse the economic concepts for designing behavioral tasks suitable for assessing the participant’s choices and estimate their subjective reward value and preference. The task should be appropriate for identifying time-specific, discriminant and well-interpretable neural signals in discrete, repeated trials with well-defined onset and end. Each trial contains a limited number of temporally well-separated events, such as reward-predicting stimuli, movement and reward. Adequate temporal separation of task events allows us to analyze neural signals without overlap by other task events, thus reducing intercorrelations. The statistical analysis of neural responses requires repeated trials, which allows us to apply the concepts of stochastic choice theory mentioned above (9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Only major steps of the design are presented here; for details see our earlier study.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nDefine the choice options (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2740-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Step-by-step schematics of concept-driven behavioral methods",
    "(Step 1) Define the choice options. Quantitative stimuli predict two options, each of which contains the same two reward liquids indicated by colors (blue, green). Their independently set amounts are indicated by vertical bar position within each rectangle (higher is more). (Step 2) Define the sequential task events (example for monkeys). Key touch triggers appearance of the quantitative stimuli on a computer touch monitor. Subsequent touch of a central spot (red) elicits appearance of two lateral spots (blue). Touching one of the lateral spots results in delivery of the two rewards of the chosen option. (Step 3) Estimate subjective reward value at choice indifference point (IP). Left: example choice between preset Reference Option (Ref: blackcurrant juice 0.8 mL, grape juice 0 mL) and Variable Option (Var: blackcurrant juice 0.1–0.5 mL, grape juice 0.3 mL). Right: psychophysics: choice probability for Variable Option increases with blackcurrant juice being given up (Weibull fit ± 95% confidence interval). At choice indifference (P = 0.5 each option), at which both options have same subjective value, the animal gives up 0.5 mL of blackcurrant juice to gain 0.3 mL of grape juice. (Step 4) Estimation of choice indifference curve (IC) from multiple choice indifference points (IP). At each IP, the animal gives up some amount of Reward A (e.g., blackcurrant juice) to gain some amount of Reward B (e.g., grape juice) without change of value. (Step 5) IC map composed of two ICs. All options on a same-colored IC have same subjective value. All options on a higher IC (farther away from origin) have higher value compared to all options on a lower IC, despite different reward composition. The value difference between ICs holds even when one component of a higher-IC option is smaller than in a lower-IC option (partial physical non-dominance; stars).",
    "(Step 6) Transitivity tests on ICs. Brown curves show best-IC-itting quadratic polynomials. Preferences of options were inferred from IC order as c ≻ b ≻ a. Graphs in all steps are adapted from our earlier study.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]",
    "Use two options (binary choice), a pre-settable Reference Option and a Variable Option with one psychophysically adjustable reward.\nUse two components in both options.\nSelect two specific reward liquids for each option.\nUse the same two reward liquids in each option.\nSet each reward in each option to a specific amount.\nConsider that the subjective value (utility) of a two-component option depends on the amount of both of its rewards.\nNote: The presentation of symmetric choice options that each have two rewards reduces visual confounds and allows more focused data analysis, as compared to more ‘natural’ options with heterogeneous components.\nDefine the task events (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 2).\nTrial start.\nHumans: the participant is presented with a small cross at the center of the computer monitor. The cross generates attention and thus focuses the eyes on the center, usually without requiring specific ocular control.\nMonkeys: the animal contacts a touch-sensitive key to start a trial without being prompted by a specific stimulus on the computer monitor.\nSimultaneous appearance of two visual stimuli on the computer monitor, each stimulus indicating a two-component choice option.\nEach stimulus alternates pseudorandomly between left and right stimulus positions to avoid side bias (and control for spatial neural coding).\nEach stimulus contains two vertical rectangles.\nThe bar in each vertical rectangle indicates a specific reward amount (higher is more).\nChoice between two options.\nHumans: the participant presses one of two specific keys on a computer key board.\nMonkeys: the animal releases the touch-sensitive key and contacts one of two specifically marked areas on the computer touch monitor with its hand to choose the option indicated by the respective stimulus.\nRewards: the two rewards of the chosen option are paid out at trial end according to the specific schedules for humans and monkeys.",
    "The next trail starts after an inter-trial interval of 1.6 ± 0.25 s.\nNote: The complexity of the visual stimuli must not exceed the visual capacity of humans or monkeys.\nNote: The repeated delivery of reward induces a Pavlovian association between each visual stimulus component and the type and amount of each reward liquid. Thus, each stimulus component becomes a predictor of the specific liquid and amount.\nEstimate a choice indifference point (IP) between two two-component choice options (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 3). At the IP, each option is chosen with P = 0.5 (binary option set).\nDefine one two-component option as Reference Option and set both of its rewards to specific test amounts (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 3, Ref at top left).\nDefine the other two-component option as Variable Option (Var).\nSet one of its rewards to a specific test amount.\nPseudorandomly vary its other reward across the full range of testable reward amounts, using several fixed amounts (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 3, left).\nPsychophysically estimate a choice indifference point (IP) at which the Reference Option and the Variable Option are equally preferred (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 3, right). Proceed as follows:\nRepeatedly measure the choice frequency for each amount of the variable reward of the Variable Option, pseudorandomly alternating between the amounts.\nFit a sigmoid choice function (softmax, Weibull or Gaussian) to the choice frequency.\nEstimate the IP at choice P = 0.5 of each option.",
    "Critical: The amounts of both reward components of the Reference Option define its subjective value. Any IP between that Reference Option and any other option (Variable Option) has by definition the same subjective value, even if the reward amounts of the two components of that other option differ from the reward amounts of the Reference Option. Thus, even options with oppositely varying reward amounts can have the same subjective value. This is the way how single-dimensional subjective values (and neuronal signals) emerge from multi-component choice options.\nEstimate a choice indifference curve (IC) from multiple IPs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 4).\nKeep the same Reference Option but set the Variable Option to a different test amount than before.\nPsychophysically establish an IP between the new Variable Option and the original Reference Option.\nThe new IP has by definition the same subjective value as the Reference Option, and by transitivity the same subjective value as the initial Variable Option.\nPseudorandomly select a new Reference Option from the existing Variable Options and use a new Variable Option to establish a new IP, thus avoiding gradually increasing measurement inaccuracies and systematic deviations due to direction of testing.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] Repeat this step a few times for increasing accuracy of the subsequently estimated IC.\nHyperbolically fit an IC to all IPs for the same initial Reference Option. Plot the 95% confidence interval on each side of the IC to indicate the fitting error.\nAs the Reference Option defines the subjective value of all equally preferred two-component options, all options on the same IC have the same subjective value and are equally preferred to each other despite their different reward amount composition.",
    "The equal preference can be thought of as giving up some amount of one reward for gaining some amount of the other reward without loss of subjective value (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 4, colored arrows).\nNote: The coefficients of the estimated IC hyperbola provide the slope and the curvature of the graphic IC. A more simple measure of IC curvature is provided by the maximal vertical distance between the curve and a line connecting the curve intercepts with the y-axis (x = 0) and the x-axis (y = 0); the distance is expressed in ml of the y-axis liquid.\nEstimate an IC map (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5).\nSet different Reference Options to estimate several different ICs.\nAll options on a higher IC (farther from origin) are preferred to all options on a lower IC.\nAcross ICs, an option with one smaller reward component than its alternative can be preferred to an option with a larger reward component if the first option’s other reward component is much larger (partial physical non-dominance) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5, stars).\nCritical: With two-component options, a smaller reward component of preferred option compared to same reward component of alternative option indicates that the subjective value of two-component options results from integrating both components, rather than simply following the reward amounts of all components. This partial physical non-dominance further demonstrates how single-dimensional subjective values (and neuronal signals) emerge from multi-component choice options.\nTest choice consistency via transitivity using not previously estimated IPs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 6).\nTest choice between two options that are randomly set onto a high IC vs. a middle IC. The high-IC option should be preferred to the middle-IC option (a ≻ b; '≻' indicates preference).",
    "Test choice between that middle-IC option and a low-IC option at a position that is not an IP. The middle-IC option should be preferred to the low-IC option (b ≻ c).\nAssess transitivity by testing choice between the high-IC option and the low-IC option. To comply with transitivity, the high-IC option should be preferred to the low-IC option (a ≻ c).\nStrong stochastic transitivity9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] is evidenced by higher preference (probability of choice) for (a ≻ c) compared to both preferences (a ≻ b) and (b ≻ c).\nFor further validity testing, use leave-one-out statistics to assess the contribution of individual IPs to a single fitted IC. Compare the difference between the original IC and four new ICs estimated with one of the original IPs left out, using four criteria.\nLack of overlap between [the new IC fitted without the left-out option] and [another IC].\nLack of overlap between [the new IC fitted without the left-out option] and [the 95% confidence interval of another IC].\nOverlap between [the new IC fitted without the left-out option] and [the 95% confidence interval of the original IC].\nInsignificant deviation between [the new IC fitted without the left-out option] and [the left-out option].\nFor further validity testing, use out-of-sample tests to confirm a basic assumption of the IC scheme: options on higher ICs have higher subjective value than, and are preferred to, options on lower ICs.\nSet each component of one option to a randomly selected position (graphically an x-y point) on a higher IC (farther from origin). The position should not be a previously estimated IP.\nPosition the other option of the same option set onto a randomly selected non-IP x-y coordinate on a lower IC.\nTest repeated choice between the two options to measure choice probability as indicator of the monkey’s preference.",
    "Repeat this procedure a few times with different IC positions. If the monkey fails to prefer the high-IC option to the low-IC option, the IC map is unacceptable and should be re-established from scratch.\nNote: Reasons for inverse preferences could be insufficient training and suboptimal testing.\nAssess the validity of IPs and ICs using a homothetic model.\nEstimate a homothetic model from the hyperbolic or quadratic model that fits best all IPs on all ICs of a given two-component option.\nOut-of-points prediction.\nSelect a test IP on an IC of the homothetic model; the IP should not have been used for constructing the homothetic model.\nPsychophysically estimate a new IP against a Reference Option positioned at the y-intercept (x = 0 mL) of the tested IC of the homothetic model.\nUsing the same x-coordinate, compare the y-coordinates between the newly estimated IP and the initially selected test IP.\nOut-of-curves prediction.\nRemove all IPs belonging to one IC from the homothetic fitting procedure and construct a reduced homothetic model from the IPs of the remaining ICs.\nUse the coefficients of the reduced homothetic model to construct a new IC that corresponds best to the left-out IC.\nSelect a test IP on that new IC.\nAs with the out-of-points prediction, psychophysically estimate a new IP against a Reference Option positioned at the y-intercept (x = 0 mL) of the tested IC of the original homothetic model.\nUsing the same x-coordinate, compare the y-coordinates between the newly estimated IP and the selected test IP on the new IC.",
    "For both out-of-points and out-of-curves predictions, use the difference in y-coordinates between the newly estimated IP and the selected test IPs as a metric of validity (ml along the y-axis). Smaller differences indicate better contribution of the IP to the IC, and thus higher IC validity for representing subjective value and choice preference.\nNote: In sum, the IC map shows the following properties: all options on higher ICs have higher value than, and are preferred to, all options on lower ICs, even when one component of the preferred option has a smaller amount than the alternative option (partial physical non-dominance; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5, stars). Thus, all options on the red IC are preferred to all options on the green IC, and all options on the green IC are preferred to all options on the blue IC. When transitivity is satisfied, all options on the red IC are preferred to all options on the blue IC.\nTest the specificity of trial-by-trial choices using a multiple logistic regression: correlate the choices with the amounts of the option components rather than with other factors that are not of primary interest for understanding choices between two-component options, such as reaction time, position of visual stimulus indicating the option, and previous choice.\nSpecific behavioral methods for human participants\nTiming: 1–2 months\nSpecify the human choice task and adapt it to the requirements for subsequent fMRI neuroimaging. For details see our earlier study.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nDefine reward liquids: each option consists of a mixture of two milkshakes with specific amounts of the same two ingredients, sugar and fat.\nmilkshake 1: low-sugar high-fat (no sugar, 25% whole milk and 75% double cream).\nmilkshake 2: high-sugar low-fat (10% sugar, skimmed milk).\nCollect choice data.",
    "Task training: run several sessions of 10–30 min until stable performance with consistent preferences for two-component options is obtained.\nIf necessary to prevent rapid satiation, consider paying out reward only on every fifth trial on average (20%), or at a similar frequency, the payout trial being selected from a Poisson distribution with a mean of five (trials). However, intermittent reward delivery likely results in confounds of attention, expectation and risk to be included in the data analysis.\nEstimate 4 IPs for each of 3 Reference Options to obtain 3 ICs for the same two liquid components. As each IC requires 7 test amounts and 6 repetitions, the total procedure requires 504 trials in each of > 20 participants.\nIncluding an inter-trial interval of 0.5 s, the 20% rewarded trials last a mean of 11.0 s, the 80% unrewarded trials last a mean of 5.5 s. Thus, the total of 504 trials requires 55 min.\nValidate the value order of the choice options independently of the estimation mechanism with a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like bidding mechanism.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nThe participant receives in every trial a new ‘endowment’ of a constant amount of water.\nThe computer sets pseudorandomly a bid that is not displayed to the participant.\nThe participant bids for a given two-component option against the computer bid.\nIf the participant’s bid is higher than or equal to the computer bid, the participant receives both component liquids of the option (‘win’) and ‘pays’ an amount from the water endowment that is equal to the computer bid (second price auction).\nIf the participant’s bid is lower than the computer bid, the participant loses the auction, pays nothing by receiving the full water endowment, and does not receive the reward s/he bid for.",
    "To start the BDM, present the vertical composite visual stimulus for one two-component option on a computer monitor to the left of a scale of 0–20 UK pence.\nTo place a BDM bid, the participant moves a cursor horizontally on the monitor, using the left and right keyboard arrows.\nCollect BDM bids in each of > 20 participants for 15 options with 12 repetitions, which requires 180 trials in one session lasting 55 min.\nAnalyze BDM bids according to the IC scheme (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5).\nTest monotonicity across ICs with linear regression.\nTest monotonicity across ICs without requiring linearity with Spearman rank correlation.\nTest significance across ICs and insignificance along ICs with 2-factor Anova (factors 1 and 2, respectively). Use insignificance of the along-IC factor to indicate insignificantly different BDM bids for options positioned on same IC, suggesting similar value of all options represented by a single IC.\nCompare the BDM bids with ICs by hyperbolic fitting of BDM isolines to similar BDM bids and plot the BDM isolines on top of the ICs. Isolines that match the ICs should stay within the 95% confidence intervals of ICs.\nUse binary machine learning decoders to determine the accuracy of ICs representing the value of choice options.\nTest whether a binary support vector machine (SVM) decoder accurately assigns an option to its original IC as opposed to a neighboring IC.\nTest whether two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) assigns a given test option to one of the different ICs (first discriminant) without assigning it to any particular position on a given IC (second discriminant).\nTest whether binary SVM and two-dimensional LDA assign BDM bids correctly to ICs.\nNeuroimaging methods for human participants\nTiming: 2–4 months",
    "Use the behavioral task, validated by demonstrating meaningful choices, for investigating neural reward signals for multi-component choice options in specific human brain regions using fMRI neuroimaging. For details see our earlier study.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPrepare fMRI scanning.\nFix dates for fMRI scanning with local imaging center, typically for a 3-Tesla scanner.\nConfirm usefulness of a previously validated scan sequence17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] or else establish a new scan sequence.\nIn the scanner, tilt the scan acquisition plane by 30° to reduce signal dropout in medial-temporal and inferior frontal regions.\nOnce the fMRI technology is assured, set scan dates with all participants from the behavioral tests.\nIdeally, scan soon after participants show consistent behavioral performance.\nRecruit and task-train additional participants if necessary.\nNote: Statistical analysis of the small fMRI signals requires data averaging over multiple trials and multiple participants anchored to discrete task events (stimuli, action, rewards). Therefore, the collection of sufficient fMRI data for each participant may require two sessions of 30–45 min each on different days.\nNote: Data averaging across multiple participants involves a compromise between general economic principles and reliable data analysis: preferences and utility are subjective and thus cannot be easily compared between participants. To reduce confounds, the participants should be matched for sex, gender, age and risk attitude.\nCritical: All participants must be tested in the same scanner to allow data averaging across participants.\nAdapt behavioral task to scanning conditions.\nTo assure the participants’ cooperation in the noisy scanner, split the behavioral test session of 55 min into two shorter scanning sessions on two consecutive days.\nHabituate each participant to task testing in a horizontal position, ideally using a mock scanner with comparable scanning noise.\nRe-test the task in each participant and adjust the amount of both option components until all participants show similar ICs to facilitate data averaging across participants.",
    "Record fMRI neuroimaging data.\nTo eliminate confounds from the unchosen option, collect event-related fMRI neuroimaging data only during no-choice trials. Only one two-component option is shown in these trials.\nScan in individual sessions of 30–40 min duration / participant.\nPerform second scan on another day soon after the first scanning day.\nUse the SPM 12 data analysis package for preprocessing.\nRealign the data to correct for motion.\nNormalize the data to standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) coordinates.\nSmooth data using a Gaussian kernel with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mm.\nUse SPM 12 to set up and run an initial General Linear Model (GLM) to identify blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in brain regions of interest (ROI) whose stimulus-induced activations follow the two-dimensional IC scheme (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5).\nVariation across ICs (high > low).\nSimilarity along same ICs.\nAlternatively, apply small volume correction based on published data from a large number of studies on human fMRI neuroimaging responses to reward-predicting stimuli (> 50) to define ROIs measuring 6–10 mm in radius.\nNote: The most reliable fMRI ROIs with responses to reward-predicting stimuli are found in ventral striatum, midbrain, and orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nUse Spearman rank correlation to test for monotonic response change across the three ICs within each ROI.\nNote: The initial option-predicting stimulus contains simultaneous and full information about both components of the option, whereas the final individual two outcomes occurring with 0.5 s interval provide only partial information about the option (for sequential task events, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 2). Thus, to capture the integrated value of the options, focus the data analysis on responses to the initial stimulus rather than on the ultimate delivery of the individual reward components\nRun another GLM using SPM 12 to further assess meaningful responses.",
    "Identify brain regions with stronger response even when one of the components in the preferred option (on a higher IC) is smaller than in the alternative option (on a lower IC) (partial physical non-dominance) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5, stars).\nSubsequently directly compare the fMRI neuroimaging responses between the two options on different ICs.\nAnalyze BDM bids with a GLM using SPM 12. Identify brain regions whose fMRI neuroimaging responses to stimuli for individual options correlates with BDM bids during the bidding phase.\nSpecific behavioral methods for monkeys\nTiming: 3–9 months\nAs with the human part of the study, use the economic concepts to design a choice task in monkeys that is suitable for assessing subjective value and preference for multi-component choice options. The tasks should be appropriate for subsequently investigating the underlying neuronal signals. For details see our earlier study.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nDefine reward liquids.\nEach option contains two liquids, such as blackcurrant juice, grape juice, water, apple juice or mango juice.\nTo enlarge the range of testable rewards, add taste enhancers, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG; 20–50 mM) or inosine monophosphate (IMP; 2–5 mM).\nIn every correctly performed trial, always pay out the two rewards of the chosen option (reward probability P = 1.0; ‘safe rewards’) and in a constant sequence, separated by 0.5 s.\nHabituate each animal to controlled testing in a primate chair.\nSeparate the animal from the other animals in the home cage for each daily procedure.\nPosition and secure the chair in front of the door of the animal’s home cage.\nPlace a tunnel in front of the cage to facilitate passage of the animal into the chair (a cover on top of the chair prevents escape into the room).",
    "Place attractive food items into the tunnel and chair, each day gradually farther away from the home cage, to habituate the animal to entering the tunnel and then the chair.\nWhen the animal enters the chair completely via the tunnel, each day touch the neckplate of the chair to habituate the animal to such manipulations. The animal should not withdraw its head into the interior of the chair.\nClose the neckplate of the chair and immediately administer attractive foods and/or liquids as rewards.\nCheck the chair for comfortable fit and adjust over several days to achieve completely pressure-free fitting that can be sustained over several hours.\nAfter well entering the primate chair, wheel the animal inside the chair, over several days, gradually further towards the laboratory.\nRelease the animal into its home cage each day, and immediately give additional attractive foods and/or liquids.\nDo final adjustments of the primate chair for comfortable fit and pressure-free seating.\nCritical: Do not advance too rapidly to avoid setbacks.\nInitiate task training by requiring the animal to perform a simple action that forms a component of the ultimate full task, like touching a resting key or touching a specific spot on a computer monitor to receive a drop of liquid reward.\nStep-by-step task training (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2740-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Step-by-step task training for monkeys",
    "(Step a) Pavlovian stimulus conditioning. The animal touches a resting key and without further action receives a single reward with a specific amount (height of bar in vertical rectangle; higher is more). (Step b) The animal releases the resting key and touches the stimulus to get the reward. (Step c) The animal chooses between two stimuli predicting different amounts of the same reward liquid. (Step d) Specific colors and textures surround the quantitative stimuli for specific reward liquids. (Step e) Complete task stimuli: each choice option contains the same two reward liquids (indicated by different colors) with independently set amounts. (Step f) No-choice control: both rewards of one option are set to 0. Graphs in all steps are adapted from our earlier study.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nPavlovian conditioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] step a): a simple quantitative reward stimulus presented on the computer monitor predicts a specific liquid amount according to the vertical bar position of a horizontal bar inside a rectangle (higher is more, a universal metaphor also familiar to monkeys). Deliver a single reward with the indicated amount without requiring an action by the animal.\nOperant conditioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] step b): now require the animal to touch the stimulus on the computer monitor to obtain the indicated reward amount. Thus, the operant is the arm movement, and the animal is free to move its eyes.\nChoice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] step c): present two quantitative stimuli, each predicting a different amount of the same reward. The animal chooses by touching one, and only one, of the two stimuli.\nAdd to the quantitative stimuli a specific color or background to unambiguously identify each specific reward liquid (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] step d).

Train the animal until it no longer chooses this option.\nAt every step, check correct understanding of quantitative stimuli leading to meaningful choices.\nThe animal should choose the larger reward in > 50% of trials (stochastic choice).\nChoice of the smaller option in < 50% of trials indicates incomplete training that should dissipate with continuing task experience (remaining 5%–10% choices of lower amounts would comply with stochastic choice theory).\nWhen changing the reward amount of an option, the animal should select the better reward on the very first trials.\nTrain the animal until it reaches about 500–800 correct trials on each test day.\nNote: Gradually advance over several weeks to include all stimulus and reward settings of the final task.

    "Note: Macaque monkeys perform well when tested by the same researchers or technicians at the same time on every day of the working week. Their cooperation and performance increases gradually over several weeks of stereotyped testing. Therefore, avoid changing personnel and varying experimental hours (‘monkeys hate changes’).\nNeurophysiological methods for monkeys\nTiming: 6–12 months per animal (1–2 years for a minimum of two animals)\nUse the behavioral task, validated by meaningful choices, for investigating reward signals for multi-component choice options in single neurons of specific brain structures of macaque monkeys. For details see our earlier study.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nSelect brain structures of interest.\nOrbitofrontal cortex (OFC): only subsets of OFC neurons carry reward signals. Their distinction from non-reward signals may be easy during on-line monitoring but needs to be confirmed by off-line multi-variate data analysis.\nDopamine neurons: besides their pronounced reward prediction error signal, these neurons carry also non-reward signals related to stimulus saliency and behavioral activation18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] that need to be distinguished by experimental design, careful inspection (maximal response duration of 0.1–0.8 s) and data analysis.\nOther possible brain structures.\nAmygdala: besides their fear and aversive processing, amygdala neurons carry substantial reward signals19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] that need to be distinguished from non-reward signals by varying reward amounts while keeping sensory stimuli and movements constant.\nStriatum: most neurons in the caudate nucleus and accumbens, and about half of the neurons in the putamen, carry reward information, either for reward alone or for reward together with movement.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]\nFrontal, parietal and temporal cortex and several basal ganglia nuclei process reward information together with sensory or motor information.\nAdapt the behavioral task to the requirements of neuronal testing.\nNumber of trials per neuron: statistical neuronal data analysis requires multiple trials.",
    "Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon paired-test require at least 10 trials in each tested condition for reasonable significance (e.g., two different reward amounts).\nOther, non-parametric tests usually require at least 20–30 trials per condition for reasonable significance.\nStandard multiple linear regressions should include a regressor for every possible stimulus and behavioral variable in a single model; the number of trials must exceed the number of regressors.\nTrial duration.\nShort intra-trial durations of 5–10 s allow efficient data collection.\nLonger inter-trial intervals than intra-trial durations assure good association between rewards and stimuli and movements. However, after extensive experience and satisfactory task performance, inter-trial durations can often be shortened to 4–5 s.\nThus, cycle time (intra-trial plus inter-trial durations) sums to 10–15 s in each trial, which allows 4–6 trials per minute and requires about 10–20 min for recording 40–120 trials from a given neuron.\nTrain the animal in the final task until 90%–95% correct performance is achieved.\nPrepare neurophysiological recordings.\nSurgical implantation: implant the following devices under general anesthesia and aseptic conditions.\nHead holder: for head fixation to allow eye position monitoring, which is also helpful for keeping the animal’s attention on the task and its stimuli.\nRecording chamber: for holding the microelectrode drive.\nElectrodes.\nBuy glass-covered tungsten recording microelectrodes that are sufficiently rigid to sustain mechanical stress during insertion into the brain and during movement inside the brain. The glass insulation allows us to use precisely shaped and insulated electrode tips for recording from well-isolated single neurons as opposed to poorly separated multiple neurons.\nPlatinize the microelectrode tip22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the identification of the characteristic extracellular discharge of dopamine neurons and their distinction from discharges of neighboring non-dopamine neurons (see below).",
    "Find the position of OFC by implanting the recording chamber at stereotaxic coordinates from the Paxinos brain atlas for rhesus monkey.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]\nFind position of dopamine neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2740-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Recording sites of dopamine neurons\n(A) Lateral radiographic view of a monkey skull with a guide tube directed toward the midbrain.\n(B) Composite figure of recording area in midbrain. The schematic drawing of the base of the skull was obtained from an earlier study.28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] Nissl-stained standard sagittal histological section from Macaca mulatta was obtained from www.brainmaps.org[href=http://www.brainmaps.org] (slide 64/295). All figure components are displayed at the scale of the radiography shown in A. Adapted from our earlier study.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]\nImplant the recording chamber, oriented parallel to the three stereotaxic planes, at 8–10 mm anterior to the interaural line (AP = 8–10). The chamber position defines a new, head-centered stereotaxic reference.\nAfter a post-implantation recovery of two to three weeks, anesthetize the animal again and perform lateral and frontal radiography of the head with a metal (radio-opaque) guide cannula inserted vertically into the brain (according to the stereotaxic plane) at an antero-posterior position of the substantia nigra determined in reference to the recording chamber.\nIdentify the guide cannula on the radiography and then use bony landmarks to calculate the approximate antero-posterior position of the face area of the somatosensory ventroposteromedial thalamus (VPM) that lies above the lateral substantia nigra.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]\nNote: the VPM lies about 17–20 mm posterior to the kink in the sphenoid bone, somewhat depending on brain size (which correlates loosely with non-obese body weight).\nOne week after radiography, anesthetize the animal again, bring it into the laboratory and fix it in the sphinx position. Immobilize the head atraumatically above the body axis using the implanted head holder.",
    "Insert a recording microelectrode inside a guide cannula vertically into the brain at the approximate position of the VPM face area based on the radiography.\nLocate the VPM face area by electrophysiological recordings. VPM neurons have very small receptive fields (sometimes only one facial hair), very low stimulation thresholds and often tonic responses during maintained tactile stimulation. They are found over a 2–3 mm vertical extent.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nRepeat the VPM mapping in a horizontal grid of 1 mm to identify approximate VPM boundaries. Repeat and extend the mapping once a week to delineate the extent of the VPM. Usually 4–6 electrode tracks are sufficient.\nCollect neuronal data during behavior on most working days of the week.\nBring the animal from the home cage into the laboratory.\nFix the animal’s head and clean the implant to prevent infections.\nInsert one or several microelectrodes inside guide tube(s) through the dura into the brain of the awake animal.\nMove the microelectrode(s) inside the brain with a micromanipulator to search for, isolate and record from single neurons during task performance. Use a Narishige microdrive for a single electrode and a NAN Drive for multiple electrodes.\nAim for at least 2:1 signal-to-noise ratio of perfectly isolated single neuron action potentials (signal size measured as action potential amplitude), which allows on-line time-window discrimination and digitalization as time events. Multi-unit recordings of 2:1 signal-to-noise ratio require off-line sorting.\nRecord for at least 20 trials in each of at least 2 trial types. Extend recording durations as long as recording quality remains acceptable (2:1 signal-to-noise ratio).\nRepeat searching for, isolating and recording from single neurons until the animal’s daily performance degrades. Recording durations are usually 2–4 h each day, during which the animal performs 500–800 correct trials.\nRespect the heterogeneity of neuron types.",
    "Extracellular neurophysiological recordings in OFC can distinguish between different response types but cannot identify their anatomical identity.\nExtracellular recordings from dopamine neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area serve to determine their identity and distinguish against neighboring non-dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine neurons discharge wide impulses (between 1.5 msec and > 2.0 msec duration with 100 Hz high-pass filter) at low frequency (usually 0–6 impulses/sec), as confirmed by optogenetic identification,26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] and contrasting with all other neurons in the area.\nConduct neuronal tests in both choice and no-choice trials. While choice trials implement the decision process conceptualized by economic choice theory, no-choice trials serve to reduce interference from the unchosen option. For no-choice trials, set the amount of both liquids of the not-to-be-chosen option to zero, which after a few repetitions lets the animal choose the non-zero option (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] step f).\nOn every recording day, withdraw the electrode assembly and return the animal to its home cage. Give it some extra treat (e.g., banana, marshmellow), in particular when it cooperated well.\nCritical: Identification of neuron type by discharge characteristics is crucial for obtaining recordings from functionally or anatomically well-defined neuron types in heterogeneous brain structures.\nNote: Collect neuronal data during most working days of each week to provide similar conditions required for valid data comparisons and population analyses. A possible non-recording exception is Monday on which some animals perform less reliably because of weekend distractions.\nIdentify task-related neurophysiological responses.\nConsider four relevant task epochs.\nVisual stimuli predicting the options.\nGo signal for making the choice.\nChoice itself.\nReward delivery (separately for Liquids A and B).\nCount the number of neuronal impulses in each task epoch and in a pre-trial control epoch.",
    "Identify task-related responses with the paired Wilcoxon test for individual comparisons (task epoch vs. pre-trial control epoch) or the Kruskal-Wallis test or one-way Anova (all five epochs at once).\nTest whether task-related neuronal responses follow the scheme of two-dimensional ICs.\nEstablish a neuronal response scheme (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) that implements the characteristics of an IC map (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 5).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2740-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Neuronal response scheme for two-component choice options\nIndistinguishable neuronal response along same indifference curve (IC) on which all options have same subjective value (blue, red) despite varying option composition (pink, green), but different responses across ICs with different value. Height of small pink and green bars indicate respective amounts of Rewards A and B. Adapted from our earlier study.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nNeuronal response increase or decrease across ICs (high > low).\nSimilarity along same ICs.\nUse adequate statistics.\nUse triple linear regression on physical reward amount for assessing significance of response change across ICs (one regressor for each component, one interaction regressor). Test correlation of neuronal responses with IC slope with the component regressors and IC curvature with the interaction regressor.\nUse Spearman rank-correlation to confirm monotonic ordinal change across ICs.\nUse two-factor Anova for response similarity along ICs: insignificant change along IC in Anova with significant across-IC factor.\nUse adequate regressions to analyze neuronal responses during choice according to various forms of chosen value (absolute or relative chosen or unchosen value) (given the similar composite visual stimuli, the two choice options cannot be identified unequivocally by the animal, which precludes analysis in terms of object value).\nRun an initial analysis to test whether the reward settings are suitable for revealing neuronal responses that follow the IC response scheme.\nInspect the neuronal data every day, ideally with histograms and rasters using prepared analysis software.",
    "Search for statistically significant responses to the task events (stimuli, choice, reward delivery; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] step 2).\nFine-tune the task parameters including reward amounts until neuronal responses follow the response scheme (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nFinalize data collection and analysis.\nOnce the task details have been finalized, record neurons in trial numbers that are sufficient for statistically assessing response significance (see above).\nCollect similar trial numbers with each neuron to have adequate data for comparing responses between neurons.\nCollect similar neuron numbers from at least two monkeys for reproducibility across animals. Otherwise extend recordings to a third or even a fourth monkey.\nAim for a minimum of 50–100 neurons per monkey that show the characteristics specified by the task design (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), and a total of 100–200 neurons for the whole study.\nNote: Data variability is only tested across multiple neurons, not across monkeys. The low number of monkeys allows only data confirmation across animals and precludes specific comparisons or statistics. This procedure is justified by ethical considerations about minimal necessary animal experimentation.\nUse neuronal population responses to construct neuronal ICs.\nAnalyze only neuronal responses that vary significantly across ICs but not along ICs.\nObtain a normalized count for each response to a single option component for each neuron by calculating a z-score (subtraction from mean neuronal activity during pre-trial control period and division by standard deviation of that activity).\nObtain a z-scored neuronal population count for each option by averaging all z-scored individual neuronal responses to that option. Thus, neurons with significant changes in > 1 task epoch may contribute multiple responses to the population average.",
    "Plot the tested options at the actual x-coordinate of component B and the estimated y-coordinate for component A derived from a neuronal regression interaction coefficient. Then fit hyperbolically neuronal population ICs to x-y points of similar neuronal response strength irrespective of behavioral ICs.\nDetermine whether the neuronal population ICs fit well into the 95% confidence intervals of the hyperbolically fitted behavioral ICs to indicate precision of neuronal coding.\nNote: Analyze all behavioral and neuronal data separately for each monkey, thus respecting the individual subjectivity of reward value.\nUse machine learning tools to predict behavioral choices from neuronal responses.27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]\nUse a linear support vector machine (SVM) to decode neuronal responses according to two ICs, using svmtrain and svmclassify procedures from Matlab.\nNote: The SVM decoder would find the optimal linear hyperplane for the best separation between two neuronal response populations relative to lower vs. higher ICs.\nUse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to decode neuronal responses between and along ICs. The LDA decoder would find the axes (linear discriminants) for best separation between lower and higher ICs (first discriminant) and positions along individual ICs (second discriminant).\nTo run either decoder, use 10 trials per neuron for each of two ICs (total of 20 trials). Inclusion of 15–20 trials per group does not seem to provide significantly better decoding rates but reduces the number of useable neurons.\nWith neurons recorded for > 10 trials per IC, select randomly 10 trials for each IC.\nImplement the SVM/LDA decoder.\nUse a leave-one-out cross-validation method in which one of the 20 trials is removed and train the SVM/LDA decoder on the remaining 19 trials.\nThen use the SVM/LDA decoder to assess whether it accurately detects the IC of the left-out trial.\nRepeat this procedure 20 times, every time leaving out another one of the 20 trials.",
    "The 20 repetitions result in percentage of accurate decoding (% out of n = 20).\nThe final percentage estimate of accurate decoding results from averaging 150 iterations.\nTo distinguish from chance decoding, randomly shuffle the assignment of neuronal responses to the tested ICs, which should result in an accuracy of 50% correct. Significant non-shuffled decoding would be expressed as statistically significant difference against the shuffled data (Wilcoxon test).\nFor visualization with LDA, select randomly 10 trials from all neurons tested with two options located on lowest and highest IC. Attribute the first linear discriminant to separation between options on two different ICs, and the second linear discriminant to separation of options along same ICs.\nCheck whether the accuracy of the prediction increases monotonically with the number of neurons included in the decoder, which indicates valid choice prediction.\nCheck the number of neurons required for prediction accuracy of > 80%. Lower number of neurons indicates sparser coding.\nNote: The decoder approach models the influence of a neuron on postsynaptic neurons whose activity ultimately leads to the choice.\nTest reward-specific satiety as an example of value change that should be manifested in value-coding reward neurons.\nAnimals become naturally sated during on-going daily task performance.\nStudy satiety from on-going consumption rather than from more artificial bolus injection.\nSelect two rewards for which the animal will become sated with different speed and degree. Therefore, reward-specific satiety will be relative, not absolute.\nSatiety tests with two differentially sated rewards help to distinguish against general satiety that is not limited to value reduction and likely also reflects fatigue and loss of arousal and attention.",
    "As ICs reflect reward-specific value, ICs would change when the relative reward value is affected by satiety. Therefore, an IC map offers a diagnostic tool for relative reward-specific satiety. The altered IC map should be reflected in altered neuronal responses.\nCritical: Record from the same neuron before and after satiety."
