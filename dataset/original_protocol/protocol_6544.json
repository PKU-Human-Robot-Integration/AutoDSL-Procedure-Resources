    "TransfectionPrepare cellsPlate HEK293T cells at approximately 60% confluency in a 6-well culture plate. Ensure that the cells have not been passaged more than 10 times before transfection.Note: Cells can be plated any time before transfection, including immediately beforehand, as long as the density is 60% at the time of transfection. TransfectionTransfect HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.Use 2 μg of total plasmid, and 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well, for a 1:3 plasmid to reagent ratio.To produce ftn-PAK4, use 1 μg of ftn-PAK4 plasmid and 1 μg of inka-PAK4 plasmid. To produce inka-PAK4, use 2 μg of inka-PAK4 plasmid. The plasmid concentration is not important, only the total mass of DNA.To aid in crystal visualization through fluorescence microscopy, include 0.2 μg GFP-PAK4 plasmid in the plasmid mix. It is not necessary to increase the amount of Lipofectamine used.Wait for crystal growthThe first crystals should appear 24 h after transfection. While inka-PAK4 crystals should be immediately visible, ftn-PAK4 crystals may not be obvious after 24 h. To maximize crystal yield and size, maintain cells in culture for 72 h after transfection before isolation (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034422_2575.jpgFigure 1. HEK293T cells containing ftn-PAK4 and inka-PAK4 crystals, with GFP-PAK4, 72 h after transfection. These crystals are ready for isolation.PAK4 isolationLyse CellsRemove the media from the cells, and gently rinse once with 1 ml room-temperature sterile deionized water. Add 500 μl lysis buffer and 10 μl DNase solution directly to the cell culture well, and place on a rocker at 50 tilts/min at room temperature for 40 min.The presence of DNase in the lysis buffer is critical to high yields. Without DNase, a sticky pellet will form from the lysed cells’ DNA, which will trap most of the crystals (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034455_3973.jpgFigure 2. A ftn-PAK4 isolation without, and with DNase.",
    "In the DNase-free condition, many of the crystals have been trapped in a sticky pellet, substantially reducing the concentration of free crystals.CentrifugeAfter rocking, transfer the lysed cell solution to 1.5 ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 400 rcf for 1 min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of 0.1 M HEPES buffer.Note: The supernatant will still contain crystals, which can be collected using a second centrifugation. Verify IsolationCheck crystal yield by pipetting a few μl of the suspension onto a coverslip and looking at it under the microscope. Isolated crystals should be visible through the eyepiece using a 10x objective under both brightfield and GFP illuminations.Iron loading and assayAdd IronPrepare a solution of FAS (50 mM, 100x) and mannitol (500 mM, 100x) in sterile deionized water. Add 1 μl of each stock solution to a 100 μl aliquot of the crystal suspension. Incubate at room temperature for exactly 15 min.Notes:The final concentrations are 500 μM FAS and 5 mM mannitol. The mannitol reduces the autooxidation of the iron. The FAS stock solution must be made immediately before use, as the Fe2+ will rapidly oxidize to the insoluble Fe3+. The final iron-loaded suspension may be a light yellow/orange color. The darker this color is, the more Fe3+ precipitate there is. Wash IronCentrifuge samples at 400 rcf in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of HEPES buffer.Notes:It is important to match the volume of the wash buffer with the original suspension volume. If a larger volume, like 500 μl, is used, the ftn-PAK4 suspension may not pellet during centrifugation, though the WT-PAK4 will.",
    "Common failure: If the resulting pellet is a yellow/orange color, the iron incubation step was likely too long, and analysis will be confounded by the presence of Fe3+ precipitates. Prepare Prussian Blue (PB) StainPrepare a solution of 5% concentrated HCl v/v and 1% potassium ferrocyanide w/v in water.Note: It is important to prepare the PB stain immediately before use, because Fe2+ will oxidize and create Prussian Blue over time. While this oxidized solution will still work for approximately 48 h, it will contain a significant suspension of Prussian Blue particles. Add PB StainTo verify iron loading, pipet a 10 μl droplet of iron-loaded PAK4 crystals onto a glass slide or coverslip and add 1 μl of the PB stain. The droplet can be immediately checked under brightfield optical microscopy (Figure 3).Note: If iron loading is successful, ftn-PAK4 crystals should have a deep blue color in the center. Inka-PAK4 crystals may be a faint blue, depending on the optics of the microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034520_0074.jpgFigure 3.
