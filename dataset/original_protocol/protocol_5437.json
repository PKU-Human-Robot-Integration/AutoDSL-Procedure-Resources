    "Note: All steps before cell fixation require processing under a sterile bench. Maintaining U2OS cellsCulture U2OS cells in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine as well as 1% P/S and incubated in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Frequently (~two times a week) passage cells after attaining approximately 80% confluency using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. For long-term storage freeze cells at -150 °C in FBS containing 10% DMSO. Note: Freeze enough cell aliquots at the same time to perform the entire screen from one batch. Prepare enough 10 cm tissue culture dishes with U2OS cells to have sufficient cells of 70-80% confluency for the planned siRNA screen at the assay day. For two 384-well plates, one 10 cm dish should be sufficient. Reverse siRNA transfection of U2OS cells (Figure 1A)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830021349_2102.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the siRNA screening procedure. A. Lyophilized siRNAs in 96-well plates are solubilized and then diluted with water to receive a Stock2 plate containing siRNAs with a concentration of 1 µM, which is combined with a Lipofectamine RNAiMax-Opti-MEM-Mix (Lipo plate) and transferred to a 384-well imaging plate. U2OS cells are added prior to incubation of the 384-well plates. Finally, cells are fixed, immunostained and imaged followed by image and data analysis. B and C. It is recommended to avoid using the outer rim of the 96 (B) or 384 (C) well plates indicated by black wells to prevent edge effects.Resuspend lyophilized siRNA pools (Stock1 plate)Bring ordered 96-well plates containing the lyophilized siRNAs (0.1 nmol) from -80 °C storage to sterile bench after short centrifugation.Equip pipetting robot (Selma) with new tips. Dispense 15 µl RNase free water in every well of a 96-well v-bottom plate using a multi-channel pipette (H2O plate).",
    "With the automated pipetting robot resuspend the lyophilized siRNA by transferring 10 µl RNase free water from the H2O plate into the siRNA containing 96-well plates from Dharmacon to obtain a 10 µM stock siRNA solution (Stock1 plate). Mix well by pipetting up and down using the automated pipetting robot in the ‘mixing cycles’ mode.Notes: Be careful to arrange the control siRNAs properly amongst the screening siRNAs (e.g., randomly across the plate but at least one control per lane) while ordering the 96-well plates with lyophilized siRNAs. Thereby, an extra step is avoided where the siRNAs have to be rearranged in a suitable sequence/order for the screen.Do not use the outer rim of 96-well plates (A1-A12, H1-H12, B1, C1, …, B12, C12, …) to avoid edge effects (Figure 1B, black edges). Especially whilst using the automated pipetting robot constantly check the orientation of your plate. Always position the well A1 in one specific corner and remember the orientation. Most 96-well plates contain one notched corner for easier orientation.Discard H2O plate or also use for dilution of Stock2 plate when directly proceeding with protocol.Cover Stock1 plate with an aluminum seal and store at -80 °C or proceed with protocol.Count U2OS cells with Neubauer counting chamberWash every 10 cm dish containing U2OS cells with 2 ml sterile PBS (see Recipes). Then, add 1.5 ml trypsin per dish and incubate for approximately 5 min at room temperature until the cells are detached. Block trypsin activity by addition of 8 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine but without P/S (DMEM(-)P/S). Pool all cells for the screening assay in one flask (e.g., common sterile 15 ml or 50 ml Falcons).Transfer 10 µl of the pooled cell solution into a Neubauer counting chamber and count cells under a light microscope.",
    "Dilute U2OS cells with DMEM(-)P/S to obtain a cell density of 7.14 x 104 cells/ml (1,500 cells in 21 µl). Note: Perform the cell counting before the 384-well imaging plate preparation to reassure the necessary number of cells is available.Dilute siRNAs from Stock1 plate to obtain a 1 µM working solution in a Stock2 plate.The amounts described here are sufficient for one full 384-well imaging plate loaded in quadruplicates. If more 384-well imaging plates are necessary for the screen, adjust the amounts accordingly. Dispense 15 µl H2O in every well of a 96-well v-bottom plate using a multi-channel pipette (H2O plate).With the automated pipetting robot using the ‘sample dilution’ mode pipette 9 µl RNase free water from the H2O plate and then add 1 µl from the Stock1 plate into the same tips and release both together in a new 96-well v-bottom plate to obtain a siRNA working solution of 1 µM (Stock2 plate). Mix well by pipetting up and down using the ‘mixing cycles’.Prepare reverse siRNA transfected U2OS cells in 384-well imaging plates with a final siRNA concentration of 30 nM.Transfer 30 µl poly-L-lysine into every well of a 384-well imaging plate using a multi-channel pipette and incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature. Remove the poly-L-lysine from the 384-well imaging plate using a multi-channel pipette and discard. Let the 384-well imaging plate dry for a couple of minutes. Mix 3,382 µl Opti-MEM with 38 µl Lipofectamine RNAiMax and place in reservoir (Lipo-Opti-Mix). For each 384-well this corresponds to 8.9 µl Opti-MEM and 0.1 µl Lipofectamine RNAiMax. The excess amount is prepared to assure enough liquid for the automated pipetting robot.Transfer 50 µl Lipo-Opti-Mix in every well of a 96-well v-bottom plate using a multi-channel pipette (Lipo plate).",
    "Again, do not use the outer rim (Figures 1B and 1C). Equip automated pipetting robot with new tips.With the automated pipetting robot using the ‘sample dilution’ mode absorb 9 µl Lipo-Opti-Mix from the Lipo plate and subsequently 0.9 µl siRNA from the Stock2 plate into the same tips and release into the first replicate well of the 384-well imaging plate (Figure 1C, green wells). Note: Again, check the orientation of your plate. Repeat 3 times to receive quadruplicates from one siRNA pool on the 384-well imaging plate (Figure 1C, grey wells). Incubate siRNA-Lipo-Opti-Mix in 384-well imaging plate for 20 min at room temperature. Dispense 21 µl DMEM(-)P/S including 1,500 U2OS cells per well (total volume 11.76 ml for one 384 plate) from a reservoir into each well of the 384-well imaging plate using a multi-channel pipette. Ensure that the liquid dropped to the well bottom or gently centrifuge plate if necessary. Gentle mixing by slowly pipetting up and down with a multi-channel pipette is possible but usually not necessary. While mixing, use new tips for every siRNA. 96- and 384-well plates can be centrifuged at 161 x g with the appropriate plate inlays for centrifuges.Note: Given that cells quickly sink onto the reservoir bottom (only approximately 1 min equal distribution), mix cells in the reservoir regularly. Dispense 30 µl DMEM(-)P/S into each well of the 384-well edge (Figure 1C, black wells) using a multi-channel pipette to avoid edge effects.Incubate 384-well imaging plate in cell culture incubator for 72 h.Fixation and Immunostaining of cellsDiscard liquid from 384-well plates in proper cell culture waste.U2OS cells in the 384-well plates are fixed with 50 µl 4% PFA per well for 15 min at room temperature pipetted with a multi-channel pipette.",
    "Discard liquid in PFA waste in sealed glass bottles and check department instructions for proper waste disposal as suggested by the EH&S Chemical Waste Program.Wash cells for three times with 100 µl self-made PBS per well using a multi-channel pipette. Remove the PBS by turning the plate upside-down on top of a sink. Store plate containing 100 µl PBS per well at 4 °C or directly continue immunostaining protocol. Discard liquid.Using a multi-channel pipette, permeabilize cells with 50 µl 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS per well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Discard liquid. Block cells with 100 µl 1% BSA in PBS per well transferred with a multi-channel pipette and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Discard liquid.With an automated dispenser, wash cells once with 100 µl self-made PBS per well. Discard liquid.Prepare primary antibody solution (either anti-ATG12 1:50; anti-GABARAP 1:200; anti-LC3B 1:800; anti-STX17 1:250; or anti-WIPI2 1:500 in 0.1% BSA in PBS) and distribute 20 µl per well with a multi-channel pipette. Incubate cells for 1 h at room temperature and then discard liquid. Note: Every 384-well plate is only stained with one primary antibody.With an automated dispenser, wash cells for three times with PBS as described above. Prepare secondary antibody solution (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa Flour 488, 1:1,000 in 0.1% BSA in PBS) and distribute 20 µl per well with a multi-channel pipette. Incubate cells for 1 h at room temperature and then discard liquid.Prepare cytoplasmic staining solution (HSC CellMask Deep red stain 1:25,000,000 in 0.1% BSA in PBS) and distribute 20 µl per well with a multi-channel pipette. Incubate cells for 1 h at room temperature and then discard liquid.Prepare nuclear staining solution (DRAQ5, 1:5,000 in 0.1% BSA in PBS) and distribute 20 µl per well with a multi-channel pipette.",
    "Incubate cells for 10 min at room temperature and then discard liquid.With an automated dispenser, wash cells for three times with PBS as described above. After the third wash, distribute 100 µl sterile PBS per well with a multi-channel pipette and seal the 384-well imaging plate with an aluminum seal to avoid exposure to light. Store plate at 4 °C until image acquisition. Note: This last step is performed with a multi-channel pipette and sterile PBS to prolong storability of the imaging plates."
