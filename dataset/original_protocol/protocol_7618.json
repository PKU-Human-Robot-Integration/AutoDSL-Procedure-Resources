    "Sample preparation (Note 3) Colony cultureTransform electrocompetent cells with > 50 ng of plasmid mutant library (Note 5).Resuspend the bacterial cells using 1 mL of LB media and transfer the cells into a cell culture tube holding 2 mL of LB. Grow the cells within a shaking incubator for 1 h at 37 °C.Add antibiotics to the 3 mL of LB solution (100 μg/mL carbenicillin) and grow overnight at 37 °C in a shaker incubator.Prepare four microcentrifuge tubes holding 990 μL of LB and perform three 100-fold dilutions of the overnight culture by serially transferring 10 μL of sample to the next tube three times. Mix the tubes thoroughly in each dilution step. For the fourth tube, transfer 10 μL from the second tube (10,000-fold diluted) resulting in two tubes having 1,000,000-fold diluted samples.Using an inoculating turntable and a spreader stick, spread 500 μL of the diluted culture solution onto a prewarmed 150 mm plate in the biosafety hood. The liquid should be spread over an area like the 90 mm filter paper.Immediately after, use the tip top of the shorter leg of the L-spreader stick to uniformly spread the liquid layer while slowly rolling the turntable. Do not spread until the liquid becomes dry.Dry the liquid layer in the hood. Seed three more plates in the same manner.Seal the plates with parafilm-M (Note 6).Label the sample name at the top corner of the bottom dish, including the plate number. The up-down orientation of the label decides the sample orientation throughout the sample preparation workflow (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4862/bioprotoc-13-21-4862-g001.jpgFigure 1. Maintaining a constant up-down orientation of the sample slide throughout the sample preparation workflow.",
    "Up-down orientation of the target plate should be equal to the up-down orientation of (A) Petri dish when transferring colonies, (B) flatbed scanner glass when imaging, (C) the image of the target plate, and (D) MALDI target adapter when mounting the target plate.Incubate the Petri dishes in the cell culture incubator without water bath. Do not stack the plates in the incubator and set the plates facing upside down.In ~12–18 h, collect the plates when the colonies are ~1–2 mm.Imprinting coloniesImmediately after the completion of the cell culture step, seal the plates by an additional layer of parafilm and put the plates into a sealed plastic bag. To prevent drying of the colonies, all subsequent steps until the imprinting step should be completed in 2 h.Attach two layers of tape on the left and right edge of the MALDI target plate, while avoiding covering the fiducial marks at the corner edges. This step, step B1b, and step D6z are not necessary if the HTS MALDI plates are used. Write the sample name on the tape.Label the sample name on the backside of the MALDI target plate and on the tape at the frontside. The up-down orientation of the labels should be used for preventing placing the slide upside down in the scanner and on the MALDI target adapter (Figure 1).Get an equal number of A4 papers as the Petri dishes and tightly fold individual papers into half.Using your hand, remove particulate matter on the frontside of the protective steel plate (0.012″ thickness) and on the backside of the MALDI target plate.Set the MALDI target on the protective steel plate, with the mirror polished side facing up. Check the rotational orientation of the labeling letters of the target plate (Figure 1).",
    "Place the Petri dish next to the MALDI target, with the colonies facing up (Figure 2). Orient the Petri dish so that the labels are placed on top. The subsequent steps until the end of step A2m should be completed rapidly to minimize drying of colonies.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4862/bioprotoc-13-21-4862-g002.jpgFigure 2. Setup for colony transfer. The Petri dish with colonies (left) and the MALDI plate sitting on the protective steel plate (right). The filter paper for colony transfer (top) is placed next to the plate.Open the cover of the Petri dish.Immediately set the sterile filter paper onto the colonies and close the cover of the Petri dish. Wait at least 30 s for the complete attachment of the colonies onto the paper.Using a tweezer, grab the bottom side of the filter paper and gently pull off the filter paper from the agar plate at roughly 10 cm/s speed while avoiding lateral movement of the filter paper on the agar surface. Immediately lay the top, middle, and then the bottom side of the filter paper onto the MALDI target, having the colonies directly touch the target plate. It is important not to change the rotational orientation of the filter paper, meaning the tweezer should still be grabbing the bottom side of the filter paper when the filter paper is placed onto the MALDI target.Quickly move the steel protector (with the MALDI target plate and the filter paper) onto the bottom surface of the floor.Quickly set an unused folded A4 paper onto the filter paper, set the sponge on top of the paper, and set the 3/8″ thick steel plate on top of the sponge (Figure 3). Avoid lateral movement of the filter paper while placing the paper, the sponge, and the plate. The center of these items should be roughly aligned as they are placed.",

The imprinting tool consists of a 3/8″ steel plate, flat sponge, folded A4 paper, filter paper with colonies, MALDI target plate, and protective steel plate, from top to bottom.Immediately step onto the 3/8″ steel plate using your full body weight (> 50 kg). Set the center of the foot roughly near the center of the plate and press using both upside and downside of the foot; avoid pressing only one area at the periphery of the plate. Add extra weight by pushing up the edge of the table or hood using hands (> 1 s).Remove the steel plate, the sponge, and the paper sequentially.Place the MALDI target plate on the table and wait 30 s for drying.Using the tweezer, remove the filter paper from the MALDI target plate (Figure 4).

Example of a MALDI target plate with imprinted E. coli colonies Store the target plates in the vacuum desiccator from step D5 for 5 min and remove weakly attached colonies by gentle airflow using the air tube (Note 7).If no visible biomass is left on the agar dish after removing the colonies, incubate the plates in the cell culture incubator until a visible amount of biomass reappears. If the cells do not regrow, try reducing the initial cell culture time (step A1k).Seal the agar plates with parafilm-M and store them in a 4 °C refrigerator.Imaging using flatbed scannerOpen the cover of the scanner and leave the cover lifted.Clean up the scanner glass with ethanol wipe, removing dust and particulate matter.Set the target sample slides onto the scanner glass with the sample side facing down.",
    "Check the rotational orientation of the letters on the back of the target plate to avoid rotationally flipping the plate upside down (Figure 1).Orient the target plate so that the top and bottom edge of the target plate are perpendicular to the side edges of the frame of the scanner glass.If the target plate is an ITO slide, turn off the room light. If the target plate is a nontransparent metal plate, close the cover.Open the control software for the scanner.Set the resolution to 800 dpi.Set the scanned area so that the target plate(s) is included while minimizing the off-target area. Up to four target plates can be imaged together.Obtain the width and the height of the scan area in pixel number. Calculate the total pixel count by multiplying these values and check if the total pixel is smaller than the max pixels allowable by the macroMS software, which is 30,000,000. In other words, macroMS does not accept an image larger than ~300 cm2 at 800 dpi.Check if all the fiducial points are visible in the image (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231017/20231017012245_3750.jpgFigure 5. Example of a fiducial mark. The point highlighted by the yellow arrow is a laser etch mark that is created during building the custom MALDI target plate. This point should be visible both in the image and in the video feed of the MALDI-MS instrument. This etch mark is ~200 μm.Optionally, the image thresholds can be adjusted to increase the contrast between the colonies and the background. The background should be either clearly darker or clearly brighter than the colonies. The background should have uniform darkness.Perform scanning. For mirror polished steel plates, if white vertical stripes appear due to the LED light bulbs, rotate the plates 90° and scan again.",
    "Confirm that the total pixel count for the image is less than 30,000,000. For this, right-click the image file and click properties. Find the vertical and horizonal dimension in pixel counts and obtain the total count by multiplying the two values (i.e., 4,000,000 for a 2,000 × 2,000 image). If the number is larger than the limit, use lower dpi resolution.Confirm that the fiducial points for each of the plates are visible in the image.Confirm that the up-down orientation of the sample plate is correct (Figure 1).Name the filename informatively.Clean up the scanner glass with ethanol wipe.macroMS for image analysis and target recognitionConfirm that the total pixel count for the image is less than 30,000,000.

An option for addressing high false negative rate is screening more colonies from additional agar plates.Select the target plate type and download the geometry file. Rename the geometry file informatively.Move the file to the folder containing the geometry files for the flexControl software (i.e., D:\\Methods\\GeometryFiles). Never edit the content of the geometry file manually.Spraying MALDI matrixSpray approximately 0.1–0.3 mg/cm2 of PNA matrix onto samples using the sprayer owned by the lab. If the lab does not have a sprayer, an option is to build a sprayer device and perform the steps as described in section D. For peak alignment, putting one or two internal mass calibrants into the solution is recommended (Note 8).Remove the tapes on the target plate from step A2b.",

Remove particulate matters on the MALDI target adapter and on the backside of the target plate.ii. Soak a paper towel with ethanol and thoroughly wipe the area on the adapter and the MALDI target where copper tapes will attach to. Pressing down with some force while wiping is recommended.iii. Mount the MALDI target onto adapter. The up-down orientation of the target plate should be the same as the orientation of the MALDI adapter, so that the letters behind the target plate are not flipped upside down (Figure 1).iv. Tape the plate onto the MALDI adapter using the one-sided copper tape (Figure 7). Flatten the tape as much as possible; there is little tolerance for the height differences within the instrument. The copper tape should not touch more than one surface of the adapter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231017/20231017012342_4331.jpgFigure 7.

The origin is where the two pink lines cross (Figure 19).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4862/bioprotoc-13-21-4862-g019.jpgFigure 19. Spray path loaded into the CNC control software. The spray path indicated in red is the path drawn by the Inkscape software.Without liquid or gas, press the start button of Bachin Draw to complete the full path defined by the SVG file. During the mock spraying process, find and remove obstacles blocking the path of the spray head, the capillary, and the gas tube. Also, check if the gas tube touches the aluminum foil or creates too much strain on the 1/16″ × .020″ tubing of the sprayer head. Avoid these by adjusting the length of the nylon tube or the location of the lab stand or by creating rotational strain on the tube by twisting. For creating the rotational strain, unscrew the hex nut holding the nylon tube, twist the tube, and tightly screw the hex nut again while holding the twisted tube by hand.Setting up vacuum desiccatorCut the 5′ polyurethane rubber tubing into half.Set the vacuum desiccator inside the hood.Using the polyurethane rubber tubing, connect the barbed connector on the desiccator to the barbed connector for the vacuum outlet of the safety hood.Connect the barbed connector for the airflow outlet of the safety hood to polyurethane rubber tubing.Spraying MALDI matrixWear a cuffed sleeve lab coat that fully covers the wrist.Prepare 20 mL of PNA matrix solution at 5 mg/mL in acetonitrile (Note 2) and put into the 60 mL syringe. For peak alignment, putting one or two internal mass calibrants into the solution is recommended. See Notes 8, 17, and 21.",
    "Put 50 mL of methanol into another 60 mL syringe. Put ~3 mL of air into the syringe.Prepare a 50 mL tube containing acetonitrile.Check if the PC communicates to the CNC by pressing the down button of the Bachin Draw software. The CNC should respond by moving the sprayer head (Note 22). Then, press the home button.Place a plastic cap of a 50 mL tube under the nozzle of the sprayer head.Input the width of the syringe and the flowrate into the syringe pump (i.e., 24.5 mm and 25 mL/h for the 60 mL syringe).Connect the methanol wash syringe to the sprayer head through the capillary.Purge the capillary with ~1 mL of the wash solution by manually pushing the plunger.Empty the capillary by putting air from the wash syringe.Remove the Luer adapter and the capillary from the wash syringe (non-syringe components of Figure 14) and connect them to the syringe holding the matrix solution.Mount the syringe for the matrix solution onto the syringe pump.Disconnect the gas line from the 1/4″ to 1/16″ connector by unscrewing the hex nut of the gas line. Purge the gas circuit of the sprayer head by pipetting 2 mL of the acetone solution into the opening of the 1/4″ to 1/16″ connector (Figure 20). Remove the solvent in the tube by pipetting air through the tube. Connect the gas line back into the connector again. Avoid bending the 1/16″ tube in the process.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4862/bioprotoc-13-21-4862-g020.jpgFigure 20. Cleaning of the sprayer head for removing solid residue in the sprayer In Bachin draw, open the appropriate SVG file defining the spray area for the target plate(s). At 25 mL/h flow rate, files with 4 sweeps should be selected. Make sure the top-left corner edge of the draw path is placed at the origin point.",
    "Place the target plate(s) inside the spray area on the aluminum foil.Close the stash of the chemical safety hood as much as possible.Turn on the nitrogen gas line for the sprayer head.Turn on the syringe pump.Wait 30 s.Check if the spray is started by appearance of the spray under the spray nozzle (Note 23). Completely shut the stash of the safety hood.Press the start button on the CNC control software. After checking for 1 min, evacuate from the room.After spraying, open the safety hood minimally and stop the syringe pump first.Wait 30 s and close the nitrogen gas line.Wait 10 min for the target plate to dry and for the aerosols from the spray to fully disappear.Connect the capillary to the wash syringe and purge the capillary with ~1 mL of methanol.Using methanol-soaked Kimwipes, remove the matrix from the fiducial marks on the plates.Spot 0.5 μL mass calibrant at the fiducial mark near the top left corner of the plates.Dry the calibrant solution.Remove the tapes on the target plates and proceed to step B2.If the MALDI-MS screen is performed on a separate day and if a nitrogen cabinet is available, put the plates in a clean plastic container, seal the box using parafilm-M, and put the box into the cabinet. Wipe the outside of the box with ethanol before putting into the nitrogen cabinet."
