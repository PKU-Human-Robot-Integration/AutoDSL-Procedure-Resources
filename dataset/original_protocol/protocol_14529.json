    "All animals received humane care in compliance with the European Convention on Animal Care. Surgical procedures were performed in accordance with the Swiss Animal Protection Law after obtaining permission of the State Veterinary Office, Fribourg, approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, Switzerland.\n1. Heart Harvesting\nNOTE: All surgical interventions were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Efforts were made to diminish animal suffering. In particular, all animals received a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine pre-anesthesia. The surgical protocol for inducting myocardial infarction has been previously described elsewhere13.\nPerform a sternotomy on a myocardially infarcted animal under anesthesia (intubated animal, 2.5% isoflurane, proper anesthesia confirmed by paw pinch reflex).\n\t\nOpen the animal by cutting the skin and then the muscles with surgical scissors. Cut the ribs on the left and right, and then remove the chest.\nRemove the adhesions remaining after the previous surgery (LAD ligation). Cut the aorta and remove the heart. Put the tissue in 1 M KCl (in PBS), and then wash it with PBS.\n2. Tissue Preparation\nPut the infarcted heart longitudinally in an acrylic rat heart matrix. Keep it at -20 °C for 1 hr.\nCut the heart directly in the matrix using a razor blade with a transversal. Ensure each slice is 2 mm thick. Cut approximately 5 - 7 slides for each heart (based on the remodeling level); this is called systematic sampling.\nAt this step, performing the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is optional (keep the orientation of the heart slices base-to-apex).\n\t\nIncubate in 1% TTC in PBS for 50 min at 37 °C. Incubate it in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min to 1 hr. Put the sections between two glass plates with 2-mm spacers and take pictures with a stereological microscope coupled with a camera at 15X magnification.\nCAUTION! Paraformaldehyde is toxic.",
    "Slide freezing (1st option)\n\t\nPut each slide in a plastic mold (10 x 10 x 5 mm) with mounting medium for cryotomy (optimal cutting temperature, OCT), maintain the orientation (place the apex-oriented side of the section down on the bottom of the mold). Freeze the blocks with 2-methylbutane vapors under liquid nitrogen cooling for 10 - 15 min. Finally, store the tissue at -80 °C.\nParaffinization (2nd option)\n\t\nPlace each slide in embedding cassettes (maintain the orientation by placing the apex-oriented side of the section down on the bottom of the cassette) and then in 4% PFA for 24 hr. Put it in a tissue processor machine overnight.\n\t\t\nIncubate it in ethanol 70% for 2 hr. Incubate it in ethanol 95% for 2 hr. Incubate it in ethanol 100% for 3 hr. Incubate it in xylol for 4 hr. Incubate it in paraffin (molten at 60 °C in an oven) for 5 hr. Finally, make blocks by embedding each heart slide in paraffin.\n3. Masson-Goldner Trichrome Staining\nMake tissue sections from paraffin blocks with a manual microtome (thickness: 5 µm) or from OCT blocks with a cryostat set to -18 °C (thickness: 7 µm).\nStain one slide from each heart part for each rat (3 - 4 transversal sections per slide) with Masson-Goldner trichrome staining (see annex).\n\tNOTE: Start from this step for the paraffin sections.\n\t\nMelt the slides at 60 °C in an oven. Under a fume hood, deparaffinize them in xylol twice for 10 min each. Rehydrate them in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water for 3 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: Start from this step for the cryosections.",
    "Fix them in Bouin solution overnight. Then, rinse them in running tap water for 10 - 15 min. Rinse them in distilled water. Incubate them in Mayer's hematoxylin for 3 min.\nRemove the slides and leave them in distilled water for 5 min. Then, incubate them in acid Fuchsin-Ponceau for 5 min. Rinse them in 1% acetic acid for 1 min.\nNext, incubate them in phosphomolybdic acid Orange G for 1 min. Rinse them in 1% acetic acid for 1 min, incubate them in light green dye for 10 min, and rinse them in 1% acetic acid for 1 min.\nDehydrate them in 70% ethanol (30 sec), 95% ethanol (30 sec), and 100% ethanol (5 min). Put one drop of a resinous mounting medium on the tissue sections, cover them with coverslips, and let them dry.\n4. Infarct Size Analysis\nAcquire one image from each slide on a stereomicroscope (15X magnification) coupled with a camera. Photograph a ruler with the same settings.\nUse image analysis software to measure the scar thickness in the middle of the infarct, the septum thickness, the left ventricle (LV) cavity area, the infarct area, and the LV tissue area using.\n\t\nSet the scale with the ruler picture (Figure 1A).\n\t\t\nClick on Measurements then select Set Conversion Factor. Draw a line on the calibration bar. Right click on the picture and click on End calibration. Note the bar value, and then click OK.\nSelect the LV from the stained heart picture (Figure 1B). Use the Multiple segment tool. Select the LV point-by-point, and then right click  Copy/Paste anywhere.\nMeasure the scar and septum thickness using the single segment measurement tool (Figure 1C).\nAutomatically detect the LV cavity, infarct, and LV areas using the automatic area measurement tool in RGB mode (Figure 1D).",
    "Click on the tool. Activate Only Borders and  Contiguous in RGB mode. Finally, click inside the area of interest to detect it. If necessary, use precision tools.\nCalculate the infarct size as the ratio of the infarct area to the LV area.\nCalculate the expansion index as follows: [LV cavity area / whole LV area] / [infarct thickness / septum thickness], with the whole LV area including both the LV cavity and LV tissue areas.\nFinally, calculate an \"average\" for each heart as follows: [average of expansion index from the infarcted slides] * [Number of infarcted slides / Total number of slides].\nSubscription Required.
