    "1. Collecting Eggs to Generate Larvae for Dissection\nCross 30-40 virgin female Dpp-GAL4/TM6 Tb Hu flies to 10-15 male Sp/CyO-GFP; UAS-Dpp-GFP/TM6 Tb Hu.\nNOTE: Any two genotypes containing Dpp-GAL4 and UAS-Dpp-GFP may be used as long as the balancers have larval markers allowing for selection of the appropriate progeny during the larval stage.\nTo collect eggs, flip the crossed flies into a fresh vial of food and allow them to lay for 3–4 h before removing them from the vial. To encourage egg laying, a small amount of yeast paste made of granulated yeast mixed with a small amount of water can be added to the top of the food before the flies are introduced to the vial. The same set of crossed flies can be kept and used for up to 7 days of egg collections.\nNOTE: Any standard Drosophila cornmeal food recipe should be acceptable. Used here is the food recipe described by Hazegh and Reis20.\nKeep the egg collection vials at 25 °C for approximately 144 h until larvae are at the third instar (wandering) stage.\nTo select the appropriate larvae for dissection (those expressing both Dpp-GAL4 and UAS-Dpp-GFP) first choose larvae that are non-Tb. These larvae will be normal length rather than short and fat.\nAmong the non-Tb larvae there will be larvae expressing CyO-GFP and larvae expressing Dpp-GFP. To select the Dpp-GFP expressing larvae, view them under a fluorescence stereomicroscope. While both Dpp-GFP and CyO-GFP expressing larve will have some GFP fluorescence, the Dpp-GFP expressing larvae can be distinguished in that the GFP is restricted to the wing discs and the fluorescence is much less bright than the CyO-GFP expressing larvae. Select these less bright larvae for dissection.\n2. Preparing Solution for Larval Imaging and Dissection",
    "For live imaging of wing discs, prepare modified HL3 media21 (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2 dyhydrate, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose dyhydrate, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES). This media allows the wing disc to be kept alive for imaging21.\nAdjust pH to 7.1 using HEPES and filter with a 0.22 μm filter. Use this media for both the wing disc dissections and as the mounting media for live imaging.\n3. Preparing Slides for Wing Disc Mounting\nPlace two pieces of colorless double-sided tape widthwise across a microscope slide, leaving a space of about 5 mm between them. The pieces of tape should be long enough that the ends of the tape lie flush with the edges of the microscope slide.\nUse a flat edge (such as the handle end of a pair of dissecting forceps) to press the tape firmly to the slide so that no media can seep underneath it.\nPlace 25 μL of modified HL3 media between the two pieces of tape. The wing disc will be mounted in this drop of media between pieces of tape so that the tape prevents the coverslip from crushing the disc (Figure 1A).\n4. Dissecting and Mounting Wing Discs for Imaging\nDissect larvae in the prepared modified HL3 media26.\nGently tear larvae in half using two pairs of forceps and discard the posterior half of the larva.\nGrasp the middle of the anterior half of the larva with one pair of forceps and use another pair of closed forceps to push the mouth hooks back into the larva until the larva is completely inverted.",
    "The wing discs can be most easily found by looking for the sharp bends in the two darker colored primary branches of the tracheae that run down both sides of the larvae. The wing discs lie directly under these bends in the tracheae in an inverted larva.\nGently remove the wing discs and transfer them to the 25 μL of HL3 media on the prepared microscope slide. It is important to make sure that no pieces of trachea are left attached to the dissected wing discs as this can cause the discs to float, making imaging difficult.\nArrange the wing disc so that the peripodial side of the wing pouch is facing upward away from the microscope slide with the disc lying flat (see Figure 1A,B).\nCover the wing disc and tape with a coverslip and seal the coverslip using nail polish. Once the polish is dry, immediately proceed to the imaging steps below.\n5. Imaging Dpp Release\nImage the mounted wing disc using a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 40x oil objective and 488 nm laser. The Dpp-GFP should appear as a stripe of GFP fluorescence down the center of the wing disc with small puncta of Dpp-GFP being released from this center stripe of cells.\nCollect images at a speed of 2 Hz for 2 min to visualize Dpp release. For best results, set the laser at a setting just strong enough to get a clear image of the Dpp-releasing cells to avoid over-bleaching during image collection. The images can be collected as a time series which can then be exported as AVI files (no compression, 3 frames/s) to obtain video files of the Dpp release.\nSubscription Required.
