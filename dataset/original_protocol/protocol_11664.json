    "The Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) recommends that research on human blastoids is permissible only after review and approval through a specialized scientific and ethics review process3,4. All the experimental procedures were conducted by following the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Science (IMBA) under the approval Rivron_Stellungnahme_2020-04-22. Compliance with these guidelines is necessary for publishing research results in scientific journals.\n1. Culture of human naive embryonic stem cell in PXGL condition\nNOTE: Naive hPSCs can be obtained from relevant laboratories. Lines used here were obtained from the laboratories of Yasuhiro Takashima (currently at CiRA, Kyoto, Japan) and of Austin Smith (currently at Living Systems Institute, Exeter, UK). Alternatively, naive hPSCs can be resetted in house from lines of primed hPSCs as described previously13,14. Naive hPSCs appear stable for multiple passages (> 15) but the quality of the culture can vary over time. If the quality of naive hPSC decreases, thaw a new vial of cells or generate de novo naive hPSCs from primed PSCs. For all media compositions see Supplementary Table 1.\nPreparation of irradiated mouse embryonic feeder (MEFs) layer\n\t\nThe day before passaging of naive hPSCs, prepare a 6-well cell culture plate with irradiated MEF layers by following the steps described below.\nCoat a 6-well cell culture plate with 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin in PBS per well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min. Remove the gelatin solution.\nPrepare MEF medium at 37 °C.\nThaw MEFs in a water bath at 37 °C until only a small ice clump is left. Dissolve the volume of the vial with 1 mL of prepared MEF medium using a P1000 pipette.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube. Spin down the suspension at 200 x g for 4 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the MEF pellet by adding fresh MEF medium (sufficient for 1.5 mL per well).\nCount the cells using cell counting slides and add 300,000 cells per well and transfer the plate into a normoxy incubator at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If MEFs detach over time, fresh MEFs can be added into the PXGL medium during routine media change.\nPassaging of human naive pluripotent stem cells\n\t\nBefore passaging hPSCs, check their morphology under the microscope. Colonies typically have a dome-shaped morphology with bright, defined borders. If the individual colonies show a flatter morphology or if differentiated colonies start to emerge, follow the instructions of step 1.2.8.\nAspirate the medium and wash cells with PBS once. Add 500 µL of cell detachment solution per well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C. Use a P1000 pipette and pipette the cells several times to dissociate the colonies into single cells.\nCollect the cells and transfer them into a 15 mL tube containing washing buffer (1 mL per well of a 6-well plate ). Spin down the cells at 200 x g for 4 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh PXGL medium (sufficient for 1.5 mL per well). Consider a splitting ratio of 1:3-1:6 for routinely passaging.\n\t\tNOTE: After every 3-4 passages or if the quality of cell culture decreases based on the cell morphology (e.g., the emergence of flat colonies in the population), add 10 µM Y-27632 and growth factor basement membrane extract (5 µL / well) to the medium during the first 24 h after passaging.",
    "Before replating the hPSCs, prepare the plates with fresh MEFs by aspirating the MEF medium and washing the cells once with PBS. Then, use a P1000 pipette to transfer 1.5 mL of hPSCs cell suspension per well of a 6-well plate containing the MEFs.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that pipetting leads to a homogeneous seeding of the cells across the well area. This will ensure the growth of colonies with homogeneous sizes and relative synchrony of the cells.\nCulture hPSCs under hypoxic conditions at 37 °C in a humidified environment. After 24 h, hPSCs should be attached. A high number of non-adherent (or floating) cells reflect a problem of viability or of attachment upon passaging.\nChange medium with 1.5 mL of PXGL medium per well daily. Passage hPSCs every 3-4 days or use them for blastoid formation experiments.\n\t\t​NOTE: After thawing hPSCs, passage them for a minimum of three passages before starting a blastoid experiment.\n2. Formation of Blastoids\nFormation of naive PSC aggregates\n\t\nPrepare and pre-warm the PXGL media, N2B27 basal media, washing buffer, PBS, and aggregation media before starting the experiment. Exclude MEFs from the hPSCs suspension for forming blastoids by following the steps described below.\nFor MEF exclusion, prepare a gelatin-coated plate by adding 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin into the well of a 6-well plate and incubating at 37 °C for 30-90 min.\nTo harvest the cells, aspirate the medium and wash the cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nAdd 500 µL of cell detachment solution (per well of a 6-well plate) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nCheck the cells under the microscope to follow the dissociation of colonies into single cells (a few multicellular clumps can be dissociated later by gentle pipetting).",
    "Dilute the cell detachment solution with 1 mL of washing buffer. Collect the cells from the plate by gently pipetting 5 to 10 times. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube. Spin down the cells at 200 x g for 4 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1.5 mL of PXGL medium (per well of a 6-well plate) and seed the cells on the gelatin-coated plates for MEF exclusion and incubate at 37 °C for 60-90 min.\nOnce the naive cells are seeded for MEF exclusion, remove the PBS from microwells and equilibrate the wells with 200 µL of basal N2B27 medium (per 1 microwell chip) and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C.\nCollect the supernatant containing the unattached naive cells, transfer it to a 15 mL tube, and spin down the cells at 200 x g for 4 min.\nAspirate the media and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of N2B27 basal media. Count the cells using cell counting slides. Spin down the cells at 200 x g for 4 min.\nAspirate the medium and add an appropriate amount of 10 µM Y-27632 contained in N2B27 media to obtain a cell density of 30,000 cells per 50 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal initial seeding cell number can vary among the different cell lines. For example, to seed 50-60 cells/microwell, 30,000 cells (including surplus considering some cells fall outside of the microwell) are seeded in 1 well of 96 well plate which contains 430 microwells. An inappropriate starting cell number can result in the small aggregate formation without cavity or formation of cavitated structure reaching more than 250 µm.",
    "Aspirate the medium from equilibrated microwell arrays and add 25 µL of N2B27 media with 10 µM Y-27632. Add 50 µL of cell suspension and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min (until cells fall into the bottom of the microwell). Then, add 125 µL of N2B27 medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632.\nBlastoid development\n\t\nWithin 24 h, aggregates of naive hPSCs can be observed (day 0) on the microwell chip. To initiate blastoid formation, prepare PALLY medium and follow the steps outlined below.\nPre-warm PALLY medium at 37 °C for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: 1-Oleoyl Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and 10 µM Y-27632 need to be added just before use. The optimal concentration of LPA varies between 0.5-5 µM. This has to be titrated for individual hPSC lines used for blastoids.\nAspirate the aggregation medium. Add 200 µL of pre-warmed PALLY medium to the microwells. Place the cell culture plate back into a hypoxic incubator at 37 °C. Repeat the media change on day 1.\nOn day 2, remove PALLY medium and add 200 µL of N2B27 medium supplemented with LPA and 10 µM Y-27632.\n\t\tNOTE: On day 2 the majority of aggregates continue to grow. However, some aggregates form small cavities. Continuously culture blastoids in PALLY until day 4 or in in vitro culture medium (IVC1) from day 2 onwards. However, following this media change enhances the formation of PrE in mature blastoids.\nRepeat media change on day 3. Complete blastoid formation occurs by day 4.",
    "​NOTE: Blastoids are considered to have fully developed when they have undergone complete morphogenesis based on morphometrics of day 7 human blastocysts (e.g., a diameter range from 150 -250 µm; one inner cluster surrounded by an epithelium of trophectoderm-like cells) and have formed polar trophectoderm-like cells (NR2F2+/CDX2-) and PrE-like cells (GATA4+). This can be assessed using immunofluorescence staining or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n3. Formation of blastoids in 96-well ultra low attachment microplates\nPrepare naive hPSCs cell suspension for blastoid formation by following the steps described above from 2.1.1 - 2.1.11.\nAspirate the medium and add an appropriate amount of N2B27 media containing 10 µM Y-27632 to obtain the cell density of 70 cells per 100 µL of the medium.\n\tNOTE: Optimal initial seeding cell number can vary among different cell lines. For example, 70 cells/well can be the optimal cell number for most cell lines.\nCentrifuge the plate at 200 x g for 2 min at room temperature to cluster cells at the bottom of the wells.\nIncubate the plate in an incubator at 37 °C under hypoxic culture conditions. Within 24 h aggregates of naive hPSCs can be observed (day 0) on the wells.\nPrepare 2x PALLY medium. Add 100 µL of prewarmed 2x PALLY medium to the wells.\nPlace the cell culture plate back in a hypoxic incubator at 37 °C. After 24 h, aspirate half of the media (100 µL) and replace it with 100 µL of prewarmed PALLY medium. Repeat the step till day 4. Ensure not to aspirate the aggregates.\n\t​NOTE: On day 2, the majority of aggregates continue to grow. However, some aggregates have small liquid-filled cavities. On day 4, the majority of the cavitated structures undergo complete morphogenesis to form blastocyst-like structures.\n4. Formation of trophospheres",
    "For trophosphere formation, follow the blastoid formation protocol from step 2.1.1 (MEF exclusion) until step 2.1.12 (last step of the seeding protocol).\nOnce aggregates of naive hPSCs have formed after 24 h, exchange the aggregation medium with PALY (without LIF) supplemented with 3 µM SC-144 for the formation of trophospheres representing early trophectoderm and PALLY supplemented with 2 µM XMU-MP-1 for the formation of trophospheres representing mature trophectoderm.\nRefresh the medium daily. Complete trophosphere formation occurs by day 4.\n5. Analysis of the blastoid cells state and its reflected stage using scRNAseq\nTo pick up blastoids and perform dissociation, warm up the shaking incubator to 37 °C and set it to 100 rpm.\nCollect blastoids from the initial 96-well plate and transfer them to multiple wells of a U-bottom 96-well plate using a mouth pipet equipped with a glass capillary.\n\tNOTE: Blastoids (> 70%) should be selected based on the morphometric criteria (size = 150-250 µm with a unique inner cluster) in order to avoid contamination with non-blastoid structures (< 30%).\nWash once with 200 µL of PBS using a P200 by viewing under a stereomicroscope. Transfer to a well containing 50 µL of collagenase and incubate for 30 min in the shaking incubator.\nTransfer the blastoids to a well with 100 µL of 10x trypsin-EDTA and mix well. Incubate for 20 min in the shaking incubator.\nDissociate the blastoids into single cell by using P200 pipette. Transfer the cells into a 15 mL tube with FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS).\nTo capture specific ratios of the analogs of the three lineages, stain the TE and PrE analogs with TROP2 and PDGFRa antibodies respectively.",
    "NOTE: The number of PrE cells in human blastocysts is less as compared to mouse blastocysts, which might reflect developmental defects of blastocysts formed through in vitro fertilization (IVF) or a species difference. In blastoids, the PrE analogs are less abundant than the TE and EPI analogs and represent 7.4% of the cells upon counting of GATA4+ cells by immunofluorescence imaging. Also, the dissociation process might induce biases in the proportions of the different cell types as PrE analogs to represent 1%-2% of the cells upon blastoid dissociation, PDGFRa tagging and, FACS analysis.\nFACS-sort cells from all three lineage analogs into 384-plates containing a lysis buffer for smart-seq2 analysis. Exclude dead cells marked by DAPI staining (performed according to the manufacturer's instructions).\nTo evaluate the cell states (cell type and developmental stage), compare the transcriptomic data from blastoid with the appropriate controls.\n6. Extended culture to assess blastoid developmental progression\nCulture human blastoids on basement membrane matrix-coated plates (glass bottom).\n\t\nCoat the plate with basement membrane matrix.\nVisually inspect the blastoids to assess and record morphology.\n\t\tNOTE: Only blastoids that display the classic hollow-ball blastocyst morphology with compact ICM have the potential of growing and developing further.\nAdd 100 µL of CMRL medium-1 per one well of the 96-well plate, and place the plate in the incubator at least 2 h before blastoids transfer for equilibration.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, visually identify the blastoids with good morphology, transfer the selected blastoids in a well of 96-well plate containing 100 µl of CMRL medium-1 to remove the traces of blastoid media.\nTransfer the blastoids into the well containing pre-equilibrated CMRL media-1. Place the plate in the incubator and incubate at 37°C overnight.",
    "NOTE: Upto 5 blastoids can be cultured in one well of 96 well plates. Having too many blastoids in a single well may lead to the formation of aggregates of multiple blastoids.\nThe next day, visually inspect the blastoids under a microscope. If the blastoids are attached, add 100 µL of pre-equilibrated CMRL media-1 supplemented with 5% basement membrane matrix. Place the plate in the incubator and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nThe next day, monitor the blastoids under a microscope. Remove half of the media (100 µL) and replace it with 100 µL of pre-equilibrated CMRL media-2 supplemented with 5% basement membrane matrix.\nOn the following days, replace half of the media (100 µL) with pre-equilibrated CMRL media-3 supplemented with 5% basement membrane matrix. Place the plate in the incubator and incubate at 37 °C overnight. Repeat every day for up to 4-6 days of in vitro culture.\n\t\tNOTE: We have cultured blastoids for up to 6 days in extended culture conditions which corresponds to the time equivalent of day 13 of in vitro cultured human embryos.\n7. Immunostaining blastoids\nAspirate the medium. Wash samples 3x with PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 200 µL of cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and fix samples for 30 min at room temperature. Remove PFA solution and wash samples 3x with PBS for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: If blastoids were cultured on microwell chips, transfer the blastoids from the chip into 96-well U-bottom plates for the following steps.\nPermeabilize and block the blastoids in 100 µL of blocking solution per well (PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X 100 and 10% normal donkey serum) for 60 min.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the host species of the antibodies, adapt serum accordingly.",
    "Remove the blocking solution. Add 100 µL primary antibodies diluted in fresh blocking solution and incubate samples overnight at 4°C.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of primary antibodies must be determined based on the manufacturer's instructions.\nWash samples 3x with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS (washing solution) for 10 min. Add 100 µL of secondary antibodies in blocking solution together with 20 µg/mL Hoechst nuclear stain and incubate samples for 1 h at room temperature. Protect samples from light.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of secondary antibodies must be determined based on the manufacturer's instructions.\nWash samples 3x with washing solution for 10 min. For imaging, transfer the samples onto the glass bottom µ-slide in PBS.\n\tNOTE: The mounting medium should be selected based on the objective used for the imaging. For example, 80% glycerol in PBS is possible to use for mounting the samples while using oil objectives."
