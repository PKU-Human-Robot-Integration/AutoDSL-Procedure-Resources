The tab will allow the tape to be easily lifted from the slide later.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Removal of pupae from a vial\n(A) A piece of double-sided tape attached lengthwise on a microscope slide, with an overhang to easily remove later, but not completely covering the slide so there is sufficient space remaining to place pupae after they have been removed from the vial.\n(B and C) A dull flat-ended probe can gently pry a pupa away from its vial.\n(D and E) (D) When the pupa is pried from the vial, it will generally remain lightly adhered to the probe, allowing it to easily be moved to the empty region of the microscope slide (E).\nUse the dull flat-ended probe to very gently pry several staged pupae off the side of the vial. Note that the ventral side of the pupae is adhered to the vial, with the anterior side facing down and left. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] to orient dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior sides.\nVery gently maneuver the flattest part of the probe underneath the pupal case, then lift it away from the vial, as shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3D.",
    "Critical: The posterior end of the pupa is generally more resilient to being prodded than the anterior side, but the entire pupa is fragile. If the pupa is popped, it should be discarded.\nWhen the pupa lifts away from the vial, it should stick to the probe. Carry it to and the microscope slide and collect several pupae on in the region not covered with double-sided tape, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E.\nUse the fine-tipped forceps to gently grasp the pupa between the anterior spiracles, where the gap between the pupa’s head and its case has formed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The anterior spiracles can be identified as the wide “horns” extending out from the operculum (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]); the black larval mouth parts, visible in this gap between the pupa’s head and its case, can also be used to identify the anterior side and demarcate where to pinch with forceps. Then place the pupa ventral side down onto the double-sided tape near the center of the tape, leaving equal space anterior and posterior to the pupae, and enough space laterally to eventually grab and remove the tape from the microscope slide later (about one inch).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Anatomical diagram of a pupa\nDorsal and lateral views of a Drosophila pupa show the adult head, thorax, and abdominal body sections contained within the pupal case. The operculum (the flattened exit from which the adult emerges, indicated here as the darkest brown region) and the attached anterior spiracles (wide “horns” protruding from the operculum) can be used to easily identify the anterior of the pupa from the posterior. The pnr expression domain of the dorsal thorax (notum) is denoted in red.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparation of the pupae for dissection",
    "(A) Fine-tipped forceps are used to gently grasp each pupa between the anterior spiracles, in the small gap anterior to the pupa’s head (e.g., Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, brackets), and place the pupa down on the double-sided tape.\n(B) Gently pressing the posterior of the pupa down on the double-sided tape aids in keeping the pupa adhered during dissection.\n(C) This process is repeated, evenly spacing pupae next to each other, leaving enough room for the pupal case to be dissected off and unwrapped down onto the tape between pupae.\n(D and E) Multiple genotypes of pupae can be prepared together, labeling the distinct genotypes if they are visibly indistinguishable.\nWith the forceps closed, press down very gently on the posterior end of the pupa to adhere it to the tape as firmly as possible (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). If the pupae are not adhered, they will lift off the tape during dissection.\nPlace each pupa side-by-side with about two pupa-widths separating them (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nArrange the pupae so all the heads are approximately level with each other.\nIf possible, arrange them with the largest pupa in the center and the smallest pupae on the ends (See troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\n(Optional) To dissect pupae of different genotypes on the same slide, collect all the pupae of one genotype on the tape and label with a permanent marker, then repeat steps 1–5 with pupae of another genotype (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E).\nPause point: If needed, this is a pause point before the dissection step, but remember the pupae are still developing.\nDissecting the pupal case\nTiming: ∼20 min\nThis section will dissect away the pupal case, revealing the head and thorax.",
    "Under a dissection scope, rotate the entire slide 90° so that anterior faces right if dissecting right-handed (left if dissecting left-handed), and zoom in so the pupae are very large.\nUse the extra-sharpened forceps to grab the operculum, gently pull it away, and discard it. It should easily pull away from the rest of the case. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Dissecting the pupal case\n(A) Extra-sharp forceps grab the operculum and pull, lifting it away and exposing the pupal head.\n(B) The newly exposed area of the ventral case is pressed down against the tape.\n(C) One arm of the forceps is inserted inside the case parallel to the pupal body, lateral to the thorax and dorsal of the wing.\n(D) The pupal case is unwrapped over the pupa and adhered to the tape, exposing the notum.\n(E and F) The opposite side of the case is also pressed down onto the tape.\n(G and H) A puncture of the pupal body during dissection will cause the fragile epithelium to rupture, likely killing the pupa.\n(I and J) All pupae have had their cases dissected to expose the nota.\nPress down the newly exposed inside area of the ventral case to the double-sided tape, Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B. This will aid in the pupa remaining adhered to the tape when dissecting away the rest of the case.",
    "Gently insert one tip of the forceps between case and the pupa, and slowly slide the forceps posteriorly (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C). The forceps should be inserted lateral to the midline to prevent puncturing the thorax upon entry, but medial and dorsal enough not to risk puncturing the pupal wing upon forceps insertion. Maintain the forceps at an angle parallel to the pupa and try to keep the tip of the forceps hugging the underside of the case to prevent puncturing the pupa.\nOnce the tip of the forceps is inserted approximately one-third to one-half of the way down the pupal case, gently pinch the forceps together to perforate/snip the case. Gently unwrap that portion of the case over the pupa, and adhere the unwrapped portion of the case to the double-sided tape, revealing the dorsal thorax (notum) of the pupa (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nUnwrap the remaining portion of the case on the opposite side (on the left-right pupa axis), and adhere the unwrapped portion of the case to the double-sided tape (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E and 6F).\nAvoid puncturing the pupae during steps 10–12, as shown in Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G and 6H. If a pupa is punctured, hemolymph will bleed through the epithelium and make the sample unusable. Discard and remove this pupa and continue to the next one. Do not be discouraged if this occurs multiple times when first learning this technique (see Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nRepeat this process for all pupae on the slide, see Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]I and 6J.\nMounting the dissected pupae\nTiming: ∼10 min\nThis section will mount the dissected pupae dorsally on a cover glass to image the notum.",
    "Prepare a large cover glass (35 × 50 No. 1 used here in landscape orientation) by placing two pieces of double-sided tape on top of each other on the lower half of the cover glass (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A). The pupae will be placed so that the tape acts as a riser, lifting the abdomen and tilting the head downward onto the glass.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Mounting the dissected pupae\n(A) Two pieces of double-sided tape are placed on top of each other on the lower half of the cover glass to act as a riser/fulcrum for the pupae.\n(B) Overhangs are cut.\n(C–E) The double-sided tape with attached pupae (from Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]J) is removed from the microscope slide and placed on the cover glass such that the nota of the pupa touch the glass and the posterior pupal cases are laid on the riser.\n(F and G) The side of the tape anterior to the pupae is pressed against the cover glass using the handle of the forceps; the action of pressing down the tape anterior to the pupae combined with the fulcrum of the riser causes the notum to get pressed against the glass without harming the pupa.\n(H and H′) (H) A pupa with only the notum pressed against the glass (black outline, H′).\n(I) A semi-permeable membrane is draped over the pupae, preventing excess moisture loss while allowing gas exchange.\n(J) Schematic showing a lateral view of a properly mounted pupa.\nAny overhangs can be trimmed with scissors (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nCarefully remove the double-sided tape with the pupae from the microscope slide by pulling up on the tab previously overhanging the slide (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C). Ensure the pupae are not harmed, and the tape does not curl back and stick to itself.",
    "(CRITICAL) Gently lay the tape with pupae onto the cover glass with tape so that: a) the exposed nota of all the pupae are pressed against the cover glass and b) the posterior ends of the pupae are laid on the cover glass’ tape riser. The riser underneath the abdomen acts as a fulcrum, levering the head and thorax down just enough to be easily pressed directly against the glass. Do not press the tape down completely against the cover glass on the side nearest the posterior of the pupae; leave a small opening posterior to the pupae for air to enter and escape (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D and 7E). See Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nTo ensure the nota are pressed against the cover glass, use the handle of the forceps to gently press the pupa-containing tape against the cover glass nearest to the anterior side of the pupae (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F), as well as on the left and right sides of the pupae (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]G). As more of the tape is pressed, the head and thorax will gradually be pressed against the glass as well. The leverage gained by propping the abdomen up on the tape riser aids in tilting the head and thorax against the glass. Be careful not to press too close to the head of the thorax, for risk of popping the pupa and killing it (See Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nOccasionally flip the slide over to check how much of the notum has been pressed down, being careful not to drop the slide and crush the pupae. The notum will have a visible “pressed against glass” effect (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]H and 7H′).",
    "Drape a dialysis membrane over the opening posterior to the pupae, and seal the membrane against the pieces of tape that have already been pressed down. Sealing up the sample this way continues to allow gas exchange with minimal pupal desiccation.\nAny overhanging pupal tape or membrane can be carefully cut away (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]I and 7J). The final sample can be imaged immediately or transported in an empty cover glass box.\nWhen viewed under a microscope, the pupal notum should look flat and smooth. Occasionally wrinkles are observed, but these should become less prominent with practice, and generally do not interfere with imaging.\nPupae dissected and mounted in this manner will develop normally and about 90% survive to adulthood, even after being wounded (Antunes et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; O’Connor et al., 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). After eclosion, the pupae will attempt to crawl out and get stuck on the tape, demonstrating they survived to adulthood (See step 29).\nWounding and live imaging the pupae\nTiming: ∼1 h, varies by experiment\nThis section will wound the pupae by pulsed-laser ablation and simultaneously image the epithelial cells. A prerequisite is a laser ablation system attached to the microscope of choice, as described in (Kiehart et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The following steps will demonstrate how to wound on the border of pnr-Gal4 gene expression, as in (O’Connor et al., 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), using pupae of the following genotype:\nActinP-GCaMP6m / +; pnr-Gal4, UAS-mCherry.NLS, TubP-Gal80TS / +.\nMount the slide on an inverted microscope for imaging.\nIn the example shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, live imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM410 raster-scanning inverted confocal microscope with a 40×, 1.3 NA oil objective. A temperature-controlled stage may be used for long-term imaging, although we have been able to image for many hours at ambient room temperature (∼21°C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig8.jpg",
    "Figure 8. Live-imaging the pupae\n(A) Pupae mounted on cover glass are imaged via inverted confocal microscopy and wounded via pulsed laser ablation (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). In the case of these pupae expressing GCaMP, epithelial calcium signaling is monitored during and immediately following wounding (see Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\n(B) Approximately four days later, surviving pupae eclose as adults, crawl out of their cases, and become stuck on the double-sided tape, while dead pupae never emerge from their case. Therefore, monitoring adult eclosion is a simple and effective survival assay following wounding. In this experiment, 1/2 pupae survived of genotype 1, while 3/3 pupae survived of genotype 2.\nMove the stage to aim the laser to the desired region of the pupa. In this case, the laser ablates at the center of the frame, so the stage is aligned accordingly.\nHere the goal is to wound on the border of pnr-Gal4 expression domain (indicated in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A), which is visualized by red fluorescence in the nuclei (UAS-mCherry.NLS). Thus, we align the stage so the border of red fluorescence is in the center of the frame (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B). Set the camera settings accordingly and save this single-frame image.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1646-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Wound-induced calcium signaling observed in vivo\nCalcium signaling data obtained after wounding using this protocol.\n(A) The right side is an internal control domain; the left side shows UAS-mCherry.NLS driven by pnr-Gal4, delineating the domain of pnr expression, which can be used to drive a variety of UAS-transgenes. The yellow line demarcates the border.\n(B) Time lapse of the ubiquitously expressed calcium sensor GCaMP6m, used to monitor calcium signaling over time following wounding. The yellow line is copied from the placement in A. Red X marks the region of ablation. Scale bar = 50 μm.",
    "We ablate pupae with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (5 ns pulse-width, Continuum Minilite II, Santa Clara, CA), and it is focused to ablate in the same plane as imaging.\nTo image and wound simultaneously, begin taking a time series in the relevant fluorescent channel before wounding (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C, first panel).\nHere the goal is to visualize intracellular calcium via the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6m, expressed ubiquitously in the pupa. In this time series, we take a frame every ∼2 s allowing for the visualization of intracellular calcium before, during, and after wounding.\nOnce baseline images are taken, ablate the sample and continue imaging.\nHere, the GCaMP6m calcium sensor immediately fluoresces in the cells proximal to the wound as extracellular calcium rushes into damaged cells around the wound (Shannon et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) confirming ablation has occurred.\nLaser pulse energies on the order of 1 μJ give wound sizes with diameter of ∼50–100 μm, although systems may vary. If desired, laser energy can be increased or decreased to change wound size (Shannon et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Note that pulsed lasers directly kill cells at the center of the wound, and they indirectly damage cells several microns away through the laser-generated cavitation bubble (O’Connor et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Shannon et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nSee the Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] if the laser wound is not as large as expected, as the laser may not be in focus in the z-axis.\nContinue monitoring the sample after wounding until the relevant biological phenomenon has been observed.\nHere, we observe calcium expanding from the wound for approximately 5 min after wounding (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).\nSee the Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] for tips on imaging for hours.",
    "Compile the time series into a movie, using a program such as FIJI/ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Annotate using the red mCherry.NLS fluorescence image to delineate the Gal4-expression domain from the internal control domain (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B and 9C, yellow lines).\nThe slide of pupae can be removed and maintained for the duration of pupal development. The pupae will complete development, eclose as adults, attempt to crawl out of their case, and get stuck on the tape. Animals that attempt eclosion are scored as viable through the end of pupal development.\nIn Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, 1 of 2 pupae from genotype 1 (experimental) completely survived to adulthood while 3 of 3 pupae from genotype 2 (control) completely survived to adulthood."
