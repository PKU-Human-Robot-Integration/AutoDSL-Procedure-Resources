    "This protocol describes the fabrication of a hollow fiber using photoinitiated thiol-yne click chemistry. The microchannel has chevron grooves or “stripes” as shaping features in the bottom and top of the channel (Figure 1). Three fluids are introduced and are directed in concentric streams; from the inner to outer fluid streams, these are referred to as the core, cladding, and sheath fluid. Only the cladding flow is polymerized to form the hollow fiber. The materials selected are as follows:\nCore Fluid: PEG (M.W. = 400), ~100 mPa.sec (20 ºC)\nCladding Fluid: Thiol-yne Polymer (PETMP + ODY), Initiator (DMPA)\nSheath Fluid: PEG (M.W. = 400), ~100 mPa.sec (20 ºC)\nThe microchannel device was assembled from aluminum and plastic parts fabricated by CNC milling and PDMS casting. Flow through the microchannel was controlled by three syringe pumps.\n1. Design and Simulation of Microchannel\nWhen calculating both fluid velocity and convection/diffusion within the microchannel, it is critical to assign the proper viscosity to each incoming fluid.\nCreate a computer model of the desired microchannel to be imported into the computational fluid dynamics software (COMSOL). The example in Figure 1 was generated with Autodesk Inventor CAD software. The following steps are in reference to the use of COMSOL Multiphysics for calculation of fluid flow within a microchannel.\nAfter import of the designed microchannel into COMSOL, iterative fluid flow rates can be introduced into the Navier-Stokes solver.\n\t\nInitialize program setting and choose 3D Laminar Flow+Convection/Diffusion Equations. The low Reynolds numbers generated in the microchannels allow complete laminar flow within the device.",
    "Design a finite-element mesh on which to do the numerical calculations. The mesh should be more refined (have small divisions) in areas where properties change rapidly. It is suggested to refine the mesh at both the shaping feature and exit to <1 μm side-length. This provides for “crisp” visualization of the core-sheath fluid interface.\nInput material properties for fluid flow, i.e. viscosity, diffusion constant, and concentration. At this time, also set the boundary conditions for the exit flow. We suggest zero viscous stress to simulate an open outlet.\nCalculate fluid flow velocity studies by iteratively cycling through a series of input flow rates. For example, core fluid = 7.5 μl/min, sheath fluid = 30 μl/min.\nImport the velocity field solutions as the initial values to solve the convection/diffusion properties of the microchannel flow. The solution to the convection/diffusion problems will illustrate the core-sheath fluid interface and aid in predicting the shape of the final fluid flow and fiber produced.\nFrom the computational results, the required number and type of shaping features can be predicted to attain the desired fiber shape. The fluid flow rate inputs will also correlate to the required flow rates for generating the fibers. With these predictions, a microchannel device can be fabricated for the extrusion of polymer fibers.\n2. Fabrication of Sheath Flow Apparatus Components",
    "A combination of direct micromilling, hot-embossing, and/or polymer casting can be used to create the components of the sheath flow device. Depending on the resources, choose the strategy accordingly. The example presented is a direct milling process that uses a Computer Numerical Code (CNC). There are five layers to be made (from top to bottom), which are depicted in Figure 2: 1. Inlet chuck (aluminum), 2. Fastening plate (aluminum), 3. Microchannel top layer (cyclic olefin copolymer, COC or PDMS), 4. Microchannel bottom layer (COC or polyether ether ketone, PEEK), 5. Fastening plate (aluminum). (Example files for direct milling are available in *.stl format in the Supporting Information)\nUsing a design compatible with the COMSOL simulations, develop a 3D model of the system via computer aided drafting (CAD). Create a separate CAD file for each layer of the device.\nWhen a layer is to be fabricated via direct micromilling, import the CAD models into a computer aided machining application to generate numeric code (NC) that will be interpreted by computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill to produce the device.\nAcquire 5 sheets of 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm sacrificial layer materials that are a minimum of 3.2 mm thick.\nAcquire 1 sheet each of COC, PEEK, aluminum, and poly(methylmethacrylate) that are 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm and 3.2 mm thick.\nAcquire 1 sheet of aluminum that is 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm and 9.5 mm thick.",
    "Affix each of the sheets in steps 2.4-2.5 to a sheet of sacrificial stock from step 2.3 with double-sided adhesive. Ensure that at a maximum an outer un-taped border of 2.5 cm exists. The tape serves to hold the work material in place while being milled and to protect it once the milled part is cut away from the stock material at the end of the mill cycle.\nFasten the COC + sacrificial stock to the table of the CNC Mill, load the tools quoted in the numeric code (NC), and calibrate the tools and stock (work) materials in x, y, and z.\nLoad the NC code and mill the COC layer.\nRemove the sheet of material from the mill and carefully remove the machined part from the substrate. During this process, mill coolant will saturate the part and the stock. Rinse thoroughly before gently removing the part. Wash with a mild detergent, followed by washing with a 70% isopropyl alcohol. The mild detergent will remove oily residues, and the alcohol will remove residual adhesive. If burrs are trapped in the microarchitectures, sonication may be necessary to dislodge them.\nRepeat steps 2.7 and 2.9 for each of the other layers that will be used to create the sheath flow device.\nWith the exception of the PMMA layer, each of the layers that have been prepared to this point will be used in the device directly. The PMMA will be used to prepare a PDMS layer by combining 10 parts Sylgard 184 base with 1 part curing agent and mixing thoroughly by stirring. This information is provided in case one would rather replace one of the COC layers with the gasket-like PDMS material.",
    "Pour the Sylgard 184 into the PMMA mold cavity prepared earlier, ensuring that air bubbles are eliminated. If necessary, bubbles can be removed in a vacuum. The PDMS can be cured at room temperature for 48 hr, 45 min at 100 °C, 20 min at 125 °C, or 10 min at 150 °C.\n3. Sheath Flow Apparatus Assembly\nAssemble the sheath flow device from the bottom up by placing one fastening plate at the bottom, then the COC layer followed by the other COC layer, and the remaining fastening plate (Figure 2). Ensure that the shaping grooves align with each other along the edges of the channel and that the fluid shaping geometries in the COC layers perfectly overlap. A dissection microscope can be used to aid in the alignment.\nInsert bolts across the center of the device, and hand tighten the nuts and bolts to clamp the device together.\nAlternating from left to right of center, repeat step 3.2 from the center out to lock in the alignment and to prevent leaks. Add on the inlet chuck when its mounting holes are reached and continue mounting the screws in an alternating fashion.\nUse standard HPLC fittings to interface the sheath flow device to the tubing and syringes that contain sheath fluid and prepolymer solution. Hand tightening is sufficient for all connections.\nMount the device vertically using a ring stand and clamp. Ensure that the device is vertical using a level on the top-most portion. If the sheath flow device is not vertical, the fiber may touch the microchannel wall and cause clogging.\nPosition the UV source perpendicularly ~1 cm from the COC face of the sheath flow device such that the last 3-5 cm of the microchannel is irradiated. The UV source should be calibrated to deliver ~200 mW/cm2.",
    "4. Solution Preparation\nAs indicated earlier, many materials can be used to create microfibers using analogous protocols and sheath flow systems, but thiol-yne chemistry is used here. Prepare the prepolymer solution immediately before beginning the fiber extrusion process to avoid the increase in viscosity that may occur over time in storage.\nPrepare an aliquot of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) to serve as the sheath fluid.\nFill a 1 ml Luer-tipped syringe with PEG 400 to serve as a nonpolymerizable core fluid, and fill a 30 ml Luer-tipped syringe with PEG 400 to serve as the sheath fluid.\nPrepare a prepolymer solution that contains 0.01 mol pentaerythritol tetrakis 3-mercaptopropionate (PETMP) and 0.01 mol 1,7-octadiyne (ODY). Be sure that the two components are well mixed throughout the experiment, minimize exposure of all prepolymer reagents to sources of UV light, including ambient light (e.g. wrap syringes with foil).\nSupplement the PETMP/ODY solution with 4 x 10-4 mol 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) photoinitiator. Continue to ensure that the solutions are well mixed, and that they are not exposed to UV light by covering the containers with aluminum foil.\nLoad a 5 ml aluminum foil-wrapped, Luer-tipped syringe with the prepolymer solution.\n5. Microfiber Production (Focus of Video)\nEnsure that the outlet of the microfluidic channel is in contact with a solution in the collection bath (Figure 3). For complex structures, the solution in the collection bath should be viscosity-matched to the core and sheath fluids, but for the simple hollow fibers, water is sufficient.\nSet the core, cladding, and sheath fluid syringe pumps to infuse at 1, 30, and 120 µl/min, respectively. Ensure that the respective syringe diameters have been properly entered into the syringe pumps.",
    "Mount the syringes into their corresponding syringe pumps and connect them to the sheath flow device with UV protective Tygon tubing.\nStart the sheath fluid to prime the sheath flow device and eliminate air from the system. Visually inspect the microchannel, ensuring that no air bubbles remain in the microchannel before going on to the next step. Pay particular attention to the stripes. A dissection microscope may be used to aid in microchannel inspection. If air bubbles are present, agitate the device by rotating and/or tapping gently while under flow to flush air bubbles out of the device.\nStart the cladding fluid, also allowing the flow to stabilize. Ensure that no air bubbles remain in the microchannel before going on to the next step. Pay particular attention to the shaping grooves. If air bubbles exist, agitate the device while under flow to flush the air bubbles out of the device.\nFinally, start the core fluid; again, ensure that bubbles aren’t present in the system.\nTurn on the UV source and observe the collection bath for continuous production of the hollow microfiber (Figure 4A) as it is ejected with the sheath fluid. Retrieve the fiber from the collection bath using a modified spatula or an inoculating loop, and allow the continuous fiber to be collected on a motorized spool (Figure 3)."
