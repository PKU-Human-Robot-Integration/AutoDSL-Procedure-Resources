    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCaco-2-N cells seeding—Day 1\nTiming: 30 min\nTo obtain Caco-2-N cells for SARS-CoV-2 ΔN trVLP infection, cells are firstly collected from the cultured dish.\nRemove the cell culture media and add 5 mL of sterile PBS to wash the Caco-2-N cells, when Caco-2-N cells grows in a monolayer configuration and at 90% of confluence.\nAspirate the PBS and add 2 mL trypsin 0.25% EDTA solution.\nIncubate at 37°C in the cell culture incubator for 2–5 min.\nAdd 2 mL of complete DMEM media and resuspend the cells.\nNote: Pipette the media with cells up-and-down using a 10 mL pipette to better detach and dissociate the cells.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\nTake an aliquot of 10 μL of cell suspension in a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube to count the cell numbers.\nMix the 10 μL cell suspension aliquot with 10 μL trypan blue solution and transfer the 20 μL mixture into a cell counting slide.\nCount live cells manually with a hemocytometer or with an automated cell counter to determine the cell density.\nPrepare the proper volume of cells at the concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL with the cell culture media.",
    "Note: For example, in this experiment, we have 5 experiment groups and each group has three replicates so that we have to prepare 15 wells of cells. Considering the possible media loss, we are recommended to prepare total volume of 4.5 mL cells for 18 wells (each well needs 50,000 cells in the 250 μL of media). Therefore, we need 18 × 50,000=9 × 105 cells in total. Then, we need prepare 4.5 mL of cell media with cell concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL. If the cell density of the stock is 2 × 106 cells/mL, we need prepare and mix 450 μL of the stock and 4,050 μL of culture media.\nSeed 250 μL of cell suspension solution per well in a new 48-well plate.\nNote: The data points should be performed at least in triplicates and it should always include a positive control. As for our lab, we choose 2 mg/mL human breast milk sample (A17) which has been tested to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively (Fan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Remdesivir is also recommended. As for this test, we test four different concentrations of MUC1 (0.002, 0.0004, 0.00008 and 0 mg/mL).\nIncubate cells for 18–24 h at 37°C in a CO2 (5%) incubator to allow cells to recover and attach to the plate.\nViral infection—Day 2\nTiming: 3 h\nAt this section, we use SARS-CoV-2 ΔN trVLP to infect Caco-2-N cell. We expect to find different infection ratios by adding different concentrations of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1).\nPrepare the SARS-CoV-2 ΔN trVLP infection media by adding viral stocks into complete DMEM cell culture media.",
    "Note: In our lab, the viral stock's TCID50 exceeds 105. We use SARS-CoV-2 ΔN trVLP to infect Caco-2-N at MOI=1, which can establish stable viral infection in 2 days. The trVLP titration method is in another published protocol (Yu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nPrepare different concentrations of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) for treating trVLP as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_2.csv\nNote: We still need a positive control and a negative control as mentioned above and we recommend you add different volume of stock solution to replace a series of dilution from previous concentration in this experiment actually.\nAspirate the cell culture media and add 250 μL of different MUC1-trVLP mixtures respectively into each well as planned.\nCulture the cells at 37°C, in 5% CO2 and incubate for 96 h.\nNote: The time is set up depending on the viral replication time and protein stability. The reason why we choose 96 h as our infection endpoint is that we have done time-dependent infection experiment and found 96 h are good enough to extremely expand the inhibitory effects. The cells are going to die and detach from well when extend to 120 h further, which are not suitable to collect cell lysate for RNA extraction.\nCell collection, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR detection—Day 6\nTiming: 7 h\nAt this section, Caco-2-N cells are harvested for RNA extraction, and then cDNA is synthesized for subsequent qPCR detection.\nCollect the supernatant and add 250 μL of sterile PBS to wash the cells.\nAspirate the PBS and add 250 μL of Buffer RL1 (1% V/V β -mercaptoethanol added) to lyse the cells.\nCollect the cell lysate into 1.7 mL of RNase-free Microcentrifuge Tubes for RNA extraction.",
    "Add Buffer RL2, Buffer RW1, Buffer RW2 and 100 μL of RNase-free ddH2O to extract, purify and obtain RNA according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.vazyme.com/download.html?companfileCateId=3[href=https://www.vazyme.com/download.html?companfileCateId=3]).\nAlternatives: The protocol shown here is for the FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Vazyme, China). Other RNA isolation kits can be used and the respective manufacturer’s protocol should be followed.\nFirst Strand cDNA Synthesis using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\nAdd the following reagents into a sterile, nuclease-free 0.2 mL PCR Tube on ice in the indicated order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_3.csv\nMix gently, centrifuge briefly and incubate at 65°C for 5 min. Chill on ice, spin down and place the vial back on ice.\nMake a premix in the indicated order and add 8 μL premix into each tube containing respective RNA and primer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_4.csv\nNote: Prepare 1.2 times of premix volume needed to compensate for the liquid loss during pipetting.\nMix gently and centrifuge briefly.\nIncubate for 5 min at 25°C for random hexamer primed synthesis, followed by 60 min at 42°C and terminate the reaction by heating at 70°C for 5 min.\nSet up and load a 96-well plate using the 2× PowerUpTM SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.thermofisher.cn/cn/zh/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-reagents/sybr-green-real-time-master-mixes/powerup-sybr-green-master-mix.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/cn/zh/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-reagents/sybr-green-real-time-master-mixes/powerup-sybr-green-master-mix.html]). The qPCR primers for viral RNA are as follows: SARS-CoV-2-RNA-F: 5′-CGAAAGG TAAGATGGAGAGCC-3′. SARS-CoV-2-RNA-R: 5′-TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3′. RPS11-F: 5′-GCCGAGACTATCTGCACTAC-3′. RPS11-R: 5′-ATGTCCAGCCTCAGAACTTC-3′. RPS11 is used to normalize all the data.\nPrepare PCR mixture for each well of the 96-well plate:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_5.csv\nNote: You can make a premix of 2× PowerUpTM SYBR Green Master Mix, Primer-F and Primer-R. If you do so, you need to prepare the 1.2 times of premix volume needed because of the liquid loss during pipetting.",
    "Mix the components thoroughly, then centrifuge briefly to spin down the liquid and eliminate any air bubbles.\nTransfer the appropriate volume of each reaction to each well of an optical plate.\nSeal the plate with an MicroAmp™ Optical Adhesive Film, then centrifuge briefly to spin down the contents and eliminate any air bubbles.\nSet up and run the qRT-PCR instrument.\nPlace the reaction plate in the qRT-PCR instrument.\nSet the thermal cycling conditions using the default PCR thermal cycling conditions specified in the following tables according to the instrument cycling parameters and melting temperatures of the specific primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_6.csv\nAnalyze data and determine the infection ratio and inhibition effects. MUC1 showed high inhibitory activity to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2114-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative bar graph of an experiment testing the effect of MUC1 on SARS-CoV-2 inhibition\nMock means MUC1 is denatured by 100°C for 10 min. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Data is reproduced from (Lai et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: In our lab, we choose 2 mg/mL of human breast milk sample (A17) which has been tested to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively (Fan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The inhibition rate test of MUC1 was performed to calculate relative expression compared to the negative control.\nCharacterization of a protein of interest in different stages of viral infection process\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThe viral infection process can be separated roughly into 3 stages of attachment, entry and post-entry stage. Thus, we use different temperature sets to restrict the viral infection into certain stages. Details of temperature set are listed below at corresponding section.\nIdentification of the antiviral ability of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) at attachment stage.",
    "Note: The experiment is roughly similar, only the infection process changes. In order to emphasize the differences, the experiments below are focused on the different procedures and simplify the same procedures. The 48 well plate for infection is recommended. The data points should be performed in triplicates.\nPrepare three groups of culture media designed as follows:\ntrVLP infection stock (dilute 10 times).\ntrVLP infection stock (dilute 10 times) with 0.002 mg/mL of MUC1.\ntrVLP infection stock (dilute 10 times) with 2 mg/mL of A17.\nNote: Mix these 3 groups respectively and put at 4°C for 1 h.\nAdd the MUC1-trVLP mixtures mentioned above into the wells for infection and incubate at 4°C for 2 h to allow full viral attachment to cells.\nWash the cells with 300 μL PBS per well for 3 times to remove free MUC1, viral particles and reload 250 μL/well of culture media and culture for 96 h.\nHarvest the cells, extract the RNA and carry out qRT-PCR experiment as mentioned above.\nNote: To better wash away all the free trVLP in the culture media, shake the plates gently after adding the PBS into the wells.\nIdentification of the antiviral ability of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) at entry stage. At this section, we seed Caco-2-N cells one day prior to viral infection as mentioned above. Caco-2-N cells are kept with trVLP at 4°C for viral attachment, added with MUC1 and carried out to permit viral entry at 37°C. Detailed procedures are listed below:\nDilute the trVLP with complete DMEM cell culture media to MOI=1, then add the viral media into the wells.\nPut the plates into a refrigerator at 4°C for 2 h to allow viral attachment enough to cells.",
    "Wash the cells with PBS for 3 times to exclude free virus as mentioned above.\nPrepare three groups of media designed as follows:\nFresh media only.\nFresh media with 0.002 mg/mL of MUC1.\nFresh media with 2 mg/mL of A17.\nAdd these 3 groups of media respectively into the wells and transfer to an incubator at 37°C for 1 h to allow viral internalization into cells.\nWash the cells with PBS for 3 times to exclude free viral particles, MUC1 or A17 as mentioned above and reload fresh media and culture for 96 h.\nHarvest the cells and analyze the antiviral ability by detecting viral mRNA with qRT-PCR as mentioned above.\nIdentification of the antiviral ability of protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) at post-entry stage. At this section, we seed Caco-2-N cells one day prior to viral infection as mentioned above.\nDilute the trVLP with complete culture media to MOI=1, then add it into the wells and transfer into an incubator at 37°C for 2 h to allow trVLPs fully enter cells.\nWash the cells with PBS for 3 times to exclude free virus.\nPrepare fresh media designed as follows:\nFresh media only,\nFresh media with 0.002 mg/mL of MUC1.\nFresh media with 2 mg/mL of A17.\nAdd the prepared media above respectively into the wells and incubate at 37°C, in 5% CO2 for 96 h.\nHarvest the cells, extracted viral RNA and measure by qRT-PCR to calculate the antiviral ability.\nPossibility of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 attaching to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the attachment stage\nTiming: 4–5 days",
    "It is reported that SARS-CoV infection can be inhibited by targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (Lang et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) and then SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on both cellular heparan sulfate and ACE2(Clausen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To determine its potential involvement of a protein of interest (e.g., MUC1) in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 binding to HSPG, we treated the cells with MUC1 combined with different concentrations of heparin (Lai et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: Heparin is an analog of HSPG and can also inhibit viral infection by competitively binding to SARS-CoV-2 thereby preventing viral attachment to HSPG.\nIn this section, we test and identify whether MUC1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 attaching to HSPG by using the commercial HSPG analog of heparin. We seed Caco-2-N cells one day prior to viral infection as mentioned above.\nPrepare different concentrations of heparin mixed with trVLP and MUC1 designed as follows:\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) only.\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + MUC1 (0.002 mg/mL).\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + heparin (100 U/mL).\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + MUC1 (0.002 mg/mL) + heparin (0.1 U/mL).\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + MUC1 (0.002 mg/mL) + heparin (1 U/mL).\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + MUC1 (0.002 mg/mL) + heparin (10 U/mL).\ntrVLP stock (dilute 10 times) + MUC1 (0.002 mg/mL) + heparin (100 U/mL).\nNote: Make 4 serial dilutions of MUC1-heparin-trVLP infection media according to the dilution scheme in the table below. The heparin stock is 5,000 U/mL.\nThe MUC1-trVLP is made by adding 100 μL MUC1 stock (0.1 mg/mL) into 4,900 μL trVLP infection media.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2114_7.csv\nAdd the MUC1-heparin-trVLP mixtures respectively into the wells and incubate at 4°C for 2 h to allow fully viral attachment to cells.",
    "Discard the media, wash the cells with 300 μL of PBS per well for 3 times, replenish with fresh media and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 96 h.\nCollect the supernatant and harvest the cells to extract RNA for further viral RNA quantification by qRT-PCR as mentioned above."
