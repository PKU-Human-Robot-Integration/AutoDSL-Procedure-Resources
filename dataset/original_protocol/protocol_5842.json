    "Growing the fungal cellsDay 1: Inoculate 5 ml of YEPSL media (see Recipes) in a culture tube with the U. maydisSG200 strain from a PD-agar plate (take about a loopful of inoculum) and incubate overnight in a shaking incubator at 28 °C and 180 rpm. Note: U. maydis usually forms a uniform lawn of cells in the PD agar plate if inoculated in higher density. However, when plated at lower density U. maydis single colonies are quite easily spotted on a PD agar plate.Day 2: Inoculate 50 ml of YEPSL media in a 250 ml conical flask with the overnight grown culture at an OD600 of 0.2 and incubate at 28 °C and 180 rpm. Pellet down the cells by centrifugation in a 50 ml centrifuge tube at 4 °C, 1,070 x g for 5 min when the OD600 of the culture reaches 0.8 (it usually takes 2.5 to 3 h for the OD600 to reach 0.8).Induction of apoptosis (Day 2)Resuspend the pellet from the previous step in 50 ml YEPSL media supplemented with 10 mM H2O2 and incubate the resulting cell suspension in a shaking incubator for 1 h at 28 °C and 180 rpm.Induction of protoplast formation (Day 2)Pellet H2O2-treated U. maydis cells by transferring the fungal culture to a 50 ml centrifuge tube followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, 1,070 x g for 10 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the resulting cell pellet in 25 ml SCS buffer (see Recipes) and centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, 1,070 x g.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of SCS buffer supplemented with 12.5 mg/ml Lysing enzyme (see Recipes) and incubate on ice.Start monitoring the protoplast formation from approximately 10 min of incubation in the Lysing enzyme solution.",
    "Take an aliquot of the cells every 3 min to observe protoplast formation under a light microscope at 40x magnification (Figure 1). Stop the reaction by adding 10 ml of SCS buffer to the cell suspension as soon as about 50% of the cells show early stage protoplastation.Centrifuge the resulting suspension at 4 °C, 470 x g for 15 min.Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet that now contains the early stage protoplasts 3 times with 10 ml SCS buffer and 1 time with 10 ml STC buffer (see Recipes) 10 min after every wash by centrifugation at 4 °C, 470 x g, 10 min.Note: During the washing steps, resuspend cells well in SCS/STC buffer by gently rotating the cell suspension in 50 ml centrifuge tube by hand; use of pipette and microtip may damage the protoplasts.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719011156_5877.jpgFigure 1. Light microscopic image of U. maydis sporidia after incubation with lysing enzymes. Magnification used is 40x. The emerging protoplasts are indicated with black arrows.Staining with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide (Day 2)Resuspend the pellet from the previous step in 500 μl of Annexin V-FITC binding buffer. (Prepare 1x binding buffer by diluting the 10x binding buffer (see Recipe 6) provided with the kit with autoclaved water). At this point the cells tend to clump (Figures 2B and 2D). Cut the edge of a 1 ml tip with a sterile scalpel blade to increase the cross sectional diameter of the edge. Try to dissolve the clumps by pipetting up and down the protoplast suspension using this tip. Notes: It is important to break the clumps as much as possible to ensure even staining of the protoplasts.",
    "Clumping of protoplast is a common problem and the degree of clumping has been shown to be directly dependent on the density of the cell suspension from where the protoplastation is induced (Wallin et al., 1974). Possibly exposed plasma membrane following removal of cell wall exhibits a sticky nature and can therefore interact with other protoplasts leading thereby to the formation of the protoplast aggregates or clumps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719011706_0671.jpgFigure 2. Comparative view of U. maydis cell suspension before and after protoplastation. A. Cell suspension containing U. maydis sporidia before protoplastation; B. Protoplast suspension (Note the clumps that formed due to removal of the cell wall); C-D. Bright field images of the cell suspensions in (A) and (B) respectively. Scale bars for (C) and (D) are indicated within the figure. Yellow arrows point the visible cell clumps noticed following protoplastation. Add 0.5 μg/ml Annexin V-FITC conjugate and 2 μg/ml Propidium iodide to the cell suspension.Note: Direct contact with PI should be avoided as it may cause inflammation of skin, irritation of eyes and respiratory tract. Gloves and protective glasses should always be worn while handling PI solution. Incubate the cell suspension for 10 min in the dark at room temperature and then analyze the cells using a confocal microscope.Preparing the microscope slides (Day 2)Clean the slides by rubbing well with kimwipes to remove any dirt-particle on the glass surface.Drop 5-6 μl of cell suspension in the middle of the glass surface.Carefully place a cover-slip over the drop of the cell suspension and seal it to the slide using a suitable coverslip sealant.Observe under a confocal microscope."
