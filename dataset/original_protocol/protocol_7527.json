    "Plant material and growth conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and soq1-1 mutant were grown in a growth chamber with 120 μmol photons m-2·s-1 light intensity and 60% humidity at 20 °C during the day for 8 h and 18 °C during the night for 16 h. For cold and high light conditions (Cold HL), plants are illuminated in the cold room (4 °C) for 6 h at 1,600 μmol photons m-2·s-1 light intensity.Thylakoid lumen isolation by sonication Prepare extraction buffer [see Recipe 1 (Fristedt et al., 2009)], resuspension buffer (see Recipe 2), lysis buffer (see Recipe 3), and washing buffer (see Recipe 4). Keep at 4 °C.Harvest the Arabidopsis rosettes from intended conditions (e.g., growth light and cold and high light conditions) into plastic bags. After removing the air, seal the bags and put them in the dark in the cold room. We usually use four rosettes from plants grown under short-day (8:16 h day/night) conditions for seven weeks (~10 g of fresh weight).Blend the plant samples in 90 mL of extraction buffer three times for 5 s using a blender.Filtrate the homogenate through a glass funnel with four layers of Miracloth to a 250 mL flask on ice.Transfer the filtrated homogenate to 50 mL open-top thick-wall polycarbonate tubes (two tubes) and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min.Resuspend the chloroplast pellet in 35–40 mL of resuspension buffer using a soft paintbrush and centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min.Note: We initially use a small volume (~3 mL) to resuspend the chloroplast using a paintbrush, flash freeze one or two aliquots (100 μL) in liquid nitrogen, and store them at -70 °C until immunoblot analysis. Then, we add resuspension buffer to 35–40 mL. Resuspend the chloroplast in lysis buffer at a final chlorophyll concentration of 0.",
    "2 mg/mL and centrifuge at 6,000× g for 5 min.Note: We usually keep the chloroplast in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 10 min to break the chloroplast envelopes by osmotic shock before centrifugation. Concentrate approximately 2 mL of supernatant using Amicon ultra-0.5 centrifugal filters. Flash freeze the stromal aliquots (50 μL) in liquid nitrogen and store them at -70 °C until immunoblot analysis.Wash the thylakoid pellet with 35–40 mL of washing buffer and centrifuge at 6,000× g for 5 min.Note: We usually use a small volume (~3 mL) to resuspend the pellet using a paintbrush and then add washing buffer to 35–40 mL. Resuspend the thylakoids in washing buffer, usually ~4 mL, so that the chlorophyll concentration is approximately 0.5 mg/mL. The method to measure the chlorophyll concentration is from Porra et al. (1989). Flash freeze the thylakoid aliquots (100 μL) at -70 °C until immunoblot analysis.Transfer the thylakoid mixture to a 25 mL pre-cooled beaker and sonicate 10 times for 30 s ON (power: 130 watt) and 10 s OFF at 4 °C.Note: We usually put half of the beaker into ice to keep the samples cold during the sonication operation. Transfer the samples from the beaker to a 10.4 mL polycarbonate bottle, balance the samples with the washing buffer carefully, and ultracentrifuge at 200,000× g for 2 h at 4 °C to separate the thylakoid membranes in the pellet and the soluble lumenal proteins in the supernatant.Transfer the supernatant (~3 mL) carefully to a new 15 mL centrifuge tube using a disposable glass Pasteur pipette and concentrate the soluble lumen sample (final volume is ~150 μL) at 14,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C using Amicon ultra-0.5 centrifugal filters. Flash freeze the lumen aliquots (25 μL) and store them at -70 °C until immunoblot analysis.",
    "Resuspend the thylakoid membrane after isolation of lumen proteins in washing buffer (~4 mL) at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Flash freeze the thylakoid membranes aliquots (100 μL) and store them at -70 °C until immunoblot analysis.Sample preparation for SDS-PAGE Take out samples (thylakoids, thylakoid membrane after isolation of lumen proteins, and lumen fraction) from -70 °C on ice and thaw rapidly at 37 °C on a heat block (less than a minute).Wash the thylakoid and thylakoid membrane samples with 1 mL of 120 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and centrifuge at 20,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the pellets gently by adding 200 μL of 120 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8).Measure the samples concentration using the Bradford assay (Kruger, 1994) SDS-PAGE and immunoblot Prepare the polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE.Note: The optimal concentration of separating gel depends on the protein of interest. We usually use a 15% separating gel for lumenal plastocyanin protein (PC; PC1 runs closer to 14 kDa while PC2 runs closer to 19 kDa) and 12% separating gel for thylakoid membrane light-harvesting complex b4 protein (Lhcb4, 29 kDa), core subunit A of photosystem I (PsaA, 55–60 kDa), stromal ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase large subunit (RbcL, 53 kDa), beta subunit of ATP synthase (ATPb, 54 kDa), and suppressor of quenching 1 (SOQ1, 108 kDa). Load the samples (5 μg of protein and 5 µL PageRuler prestained protein ladder) and run the polyacrylamide gels.Note: We run the gels at a lower voltage (80 V) for 20 min and then increase to a higher voltage (120 V) until the dye front has reached the bottom of the gel. After running the gel, transfer the proteins to a PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (see Recipe 7) by wet transfer at 200 mA for 90 min at 4 °C.",
    "After transferring, incubate the PVDF membrane with blocking buffer (see Recipe 9) for 1 h at room temperature (20–25 °C).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the primary antibody diluted with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (20–25 °C).Note: Here, we used anti-PsaD, anti-Lhcb4, anti-RbcL, anti-PC, rabbit-specific antibodies against a C-terminal peptide of SOQ1 (TVTPRAPDAGGLQLQGTR) (1:200 dilution, produced and purified by peptide affinity by ThermoFisher), and anti-ATPb. Wash the PVDF membrane with TBST buffer (see Recipe 8) (10 min × three times)Note: We used the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Incubate the PVDF membrane with the secondary antibody diluted with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (20–25 °C).Wash the PVDF membrane with TBST buffer (10 min × three times).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the ECL bright kit for immunodetection."
