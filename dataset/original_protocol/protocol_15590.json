    "The general procedure used in this protocol was approved by the ethics board of the University of Oldenburg. The participant provided written informed consent prior to their participation.\nNOTE: The c-grids should only be used on undamaged skin and with participants that do not have an allergy to the adhesive used. It has two sides. There is black text on the outside. The conductive surfaces of the electrodes are on the inside, and they face the skin of the participant during the recording. Importantly, handle these grids with care. Do not touch the conductive surfaces, do not fold the grids, do not excessively bend them, and avoid pulling on them.\n1. Testing\nNOTE: If handled with care, c-grids can be reused several times. To ensure optimal functioning, check that all the electrodes are working properly before the next recording. Perform the same procedure for new grids to identify potential problems (e.g., due to problems in the manufacturing process) before the recording starts. There are several options to quickly check for problems (e.g., a broken electrode).\nOption 1: Multimeter.\n\t\nSet a multimeter to measure resistance.\nAttach one pin of the multimeter to the electrode and the other pin to the corresponding contact on the connector end.\nCheck if a low resistance (<10 kΩ) can be measured for each electrode.\nOption 2: Electrode gel\n\t\nUse electrode gel to bridge all the electrodes. Make sure that there are no gaps between the electrodes.\nAttach the grid to the connector of an amplifier. To see a signal, attach the grid to the side with the reference and ground electrodes according to the connector layout that is used.",
    "Use the impedance check of the amplifier. Check the impedance of the reference electrode and all eight recording electrodes (10 electrodes in total minus the ground and reference electrodes); they must all have a low impedance (<10 kΩ). Afterward, wipe off the gel.\nOption 3: Water\n\tNOTE: Use this option with caution in order to not cause any water damage to the equipment.\n\t\nSubmerge all the electrodes in a glass of water, but make sure to keep the tail of the grid dry. Alternatively, place the c-grid in a plate filled with water (with the electrodes facing the plate).\nAttach the grid to the connector of the amplifier.\nUse the impedance check of the amplifier. Check the impedance of the reference electrode and all eight recording electrodes (10 electrodes in total minus the ground and reference electrodes); they must all have a low impedance (<10 kΩ). Afterward, dry the c-grid with a tissue.\n2. Preparing the participant\nNOTE: For high-quality recordings, the participant should have clean and dry hair, should not have used any hair products (e.g., styling products) or skin products, and should not be wearing make-up. If possible, the participants should wash their hair directly before the recording with a mild and neutral shampoo and also wash the areas around the ears. Ask the participants to indicate if any of the preparatory steps are uncomfortable for them.\nTo prepare the participant, the experimenter needs access to the area behind and around the ear. For participants with longer hair, use hair clips for easier access.",
    "Place a c-grid around the participant's ear to see how it fits. Additionally, check if it can be positioned around the ear without touching the ear. Ensure it does not touch the back of the ear or the ear lobe, as this can be uncomfortable after some time. This pre-fitting also gives an indication of the area that will be covered and, thus, needs to be cleaned.\n\tNOTE: These grids come in one size and do not fit all ear sizes. For larger ears, cut some of the plastic around the electrodes on the inside of the C with a small pair of scissors. Pay special attention to not cut into the electrodes or the conductive path.\nApply a small drop of abrasive electrode gel onto a tissue. Use the gel to clean the skin around the participant's ear with some pressure, but make sure it remains comfortable for the participant. Make sure to generously clean the whole area that will be covered.\nDip a tissue in some alcohol, and clean the area behind the ear with this tissue.\nDry the cleaned area with a clean towel.\nFor higher levels of comfort, optionally place a small piece of tape on the back side of the ear.\nRepeat all of the above steps (steps 2.1-2.5) for the other ear.\n3. Preparing and fitting the grids\nNOTE: There are different ways of attaching the c-grid using double-sided tape. Presented here are two options: c-shaped stickers (provided by the manufacturer) that cover the whole surface and small circular stickers that are placed individually around the electrodes (e.g., when reusing).\nAttach double-sided adhesive stickers (either the c-shaped or individual stickers) around each electrode. Make sure that the stickers do not cover the conductive surface of the electrodes.",
    "Put small drops (lentil-sized) of electrode gel on each electrode. Avoid using too much gel, as this might spill onto the adhesive material and reduce the adhesion to the skin. Too much gel could also create bridges between the electrodes.\nRemove the cover of the adhesive sticker(s). Reapply the gel in case it was removed during this step. Alternatively, remove the first cover, and apply the gel then; however, this requires a very steady hand so the gel does not spill accidently onto the adhesive.\nAsk the participant to hold their hair away from the ear so that it does not obstruct the fitting. Move any hair out of the way as much as possible so that the stickers touch the skin directly. Depending on the hairline, this is not always possible (e.g., when there is hair directly above the ear).\nPosition the grid around the ear, and when in place, press it into the skin. Make sure to not place it too close to the ear, as this may become uncomfortable for the participant. Leave some space (1 mm to 2 mm) between the grid and the back side of the ear. Additionally, ask the participant to press onto the electrodes.\nRepeat all of the above steps (steps 3.1-3.5) for the other ear.\nRemove any hair clips. Carefully place glasses or the strips of facial masks on the ears if necessary.\n4. Connecting\nConnect the connector to the amplifier. During this step, avoid excessively bending or pulling on the c-grid.\nPlug the contacts into the connector. Make sure that the contacts are plugged in on the correct side. Ensure that the exposed contacts on the inside of the c-grid face the contacts in the connector.",
    "NOTE: It is important to know the layout of the connector being used (including the position of the ground and the reference electrodes). Depending on the system being used, the layout may differ. To build a connector, visit https://uol.de/psychologie/abteilungen/ceegrid. With the right connector, c-grids can be connected to any amplifier.\nTo hold the amplifier in place, use a headband, for example, to fixate it on the head.\n\t​NOTE: The Oldenburg lab uses an amplifier that is built into a neck speaker called nEEGlace. The nEEGlace makes the setup more comfortable and faster.\n5. Check the impedance and data\nConnect the amplifier to a smartphone (optionally: a laptop) via Bluetooth.\nCheck the impedance of the electrodes with the impedance check of the amplifier. The impedance usually improves over time (5 min to 10 min) and does not have to be below 10 kΩ for each electrode in the beginning. Do not try to put more gel underneath electrodes with a high impedance.\nCheck the EEG signal. Ask the participant to clench their jaws, to blink, and to close their eyes (alpha activity). Observe the corresponding artifacts and alpha activity in the signal. Make sure every electrode provides a good signal. If the resulting EEG signal is poor, remove the grid, wipe off any residual gel around the ear of the participant, and fit a new one.\nBegin recording.\n6. Removing and cleaning up\nAfter finishing the data recording, disconnect the phone (or laptop) from the amplifier. Detach the grids from the amplifier, and remove the amplifier from the participant. Gently remove the c-grids from the participant. Make sure to neither bend the c-grid too much nor to pull out the hair of the participant. Allow the participants to clean themselves with tissues or a towel.",
    "Soak the grids in water for some minutes. They can be submerged completely.\nCarefully detach the stickers to avoid damage. Rinse off any remaining gel. Air-dry the grids. Do not rub over the conductive surface of the electrodes.\nStore the c-grids safely in a dark and dry place."
