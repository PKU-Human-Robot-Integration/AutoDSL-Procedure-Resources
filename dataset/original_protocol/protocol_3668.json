    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSemiautomated detection of dendritic compartments and functional zones of an excitatory synapse\nTiming: several hours (depending on the number of images)\nThis is the first step of the image processing on confocal and STED images. This step describes a semiautomated segmentation procedure to perform micron-nanoscale morphometry analysis. We have employed an object-based strategy to segment images into several objects of interest. The protocol outlines the analysis on confocal images to detect pre/post/perisynapses and on their corresponding sub diffraction STED super resolution images to distinguish functional zones of an excitatory synapse (CAZ/PSD/EZ) from rest of the neuronal processes.\nSave each MSR image file into TIFF file format using ImageJ (Fiji) (https://imagej.net/[href=https://imagej.net/])(Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nLoad TIFF images into MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Subtract operation on an image opened in MetaMorph software using threshold and arithmetic function\n(A) Confocal PSD95 image opened in MetaMorph.\n(B) Threshold image function to find low and high limits of the image.\n(C) Using the arithmetic function to subtract a set gray level from confocal PSD95 image.\n(D) An output subtracted image.\nUse threshold image function to verify the dynamic range of the grayscale values in the image indicated as low and high limits of the image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Use the arithmetic function (process menu) to subtract a set gray value (lowest gray value as obtained in step 3) from the source image. Under the process menu, select arithmetic. An arithmetic dialog box will appear. In the arithmetic box, the source image 1 will be the image of interest, and under source 2, select constant value. Select operation as subtract and value as 32768 gray levels. 32768 is the lower limit of the threshold as determined in step 3. Apply and obtain the subtracted image (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Save the generated image for corrected background values as a new TIFF file.\nReload background corrected TIFF images into MetaMorph. Under the edit menu, select image info and check if the image is calibrated (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). If the image is not calibrated, X and Y calibration will be displayed in pixels (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). To calibrate distances, from the measure menu, use calibrate distances command. Input X and Y calibration in real units in accordance with the sampling of images during acquisition and then select apply (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Here, images were obtained with a sampling of 15 nm; therefore, X and Y calibration is taken as 0.015 μm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Calibrate distances command to calibrate distances in real units rather than pixels in MetaMorph software\n(A) Uncalibrated confocal PSD95 image revealed by image information in (B).\n(B) Image information command to perform a check on the calibration of the loaded image.\n(C) Calibrate distances command to calibrate the confocal PSD95 image.",
    "Note: To save time, all the images where analysis is to be performed could also be calibrated in a single step. To do this, open all the images at once in MetaMorph. Instead of selecting apply in the previous step, select apply to all open images from the calibrate distances dialog box (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). It will calibrate all the images in a single click.\nRepeat steps 1–5 for all the images.\nPerform semiautomated detection of synaptic puncta as follows:\nLoad background corrected and calibrated (steps 1–5) confocal image of the protein of interest in MetaMorph. In this case, a postsynaptic marker PSD95 confocal image is opened in MetaMorph. PSD95 is a marker for postsynaptic density, and PSD95 confocal image could be used to segment synaptic puncta from the rest of the dendrite.\nObject-based segmentation of synaptic puncta involves thresholding the image and segmenting objects based on the thresholding. In this context, from measure menu, select show region statistics command to measure the average intensity and the standard deviation of the intensity for the entire confocal PSD95 image. For instance, here, the average intensity is 7.13 gray levels, and the standard deviation of the intensity is 17.59 gray levels. Image calibration to 0.015 μm/pixel can also be observed in the show region statistics menu (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Image thresholding using inclusive threshold and show region statistics command in MetaMorph software\n(A) Show region statistics command to measure average and standard deviation of the intensity for the entire confocal PSD95 image. The set of objects meeting specified criteria are marked in green color.\n(B) Inclusive threshold function for thresholding confocal PSD95 image.\n(C) A thresholded confocal PSD95 image.\nCritical: Make sure in the show region statistics dialog box, the active region is not selected.",
    "Within this image, select objects with intensity higher than average intensity added to the standard deviation of the intensity of the entire image. Here, the average intensity plus standard deviation of the intensity is 25 gray levels (rounding off to the nearest integer) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nUsing the threshold image function, select the threshold state to be inclusive and input the low threshold value to 25 gray levels, which is the average intensity plus standard deviation of the intensity value for this image. The pixels which are above 25 gray levels are assigned pseudocolour as orange to identify selected puncta (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nFilter synaptic puncta using several morphological filters like length, breadth, and area which characterizes the synapse morphometry (Harris and Stevens, 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Harris and Weinberg, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). It is necessary for the image to be thresholded before performing this analysis. Make sure that your image is already thresholded (steps 1–4).\nUse measure menu to open Integrated Morphometry Analysis (IMA) dialog box (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Select the source image as confocal PSD95 and select specific object classifier filters like length >= 0.06 μm, breadth >= 0.045 μm and area as >= 0.006 μm2 as limit 1 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Select measure and then create an object mask (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). This step filters the set of objects which meet the specified quantitative criteria and are marked in green color (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). On the contrary, the objects which are excluded from the analysis maintain the thresholded image orange color (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Generate a binary IMA object mask as an output image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). In this binary image, objects of interest are set to white color (maximum) and the objects which are excluded during IMA filtering are set to black color (minimum) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig5.jpg",

Object-based segmentation of synaptic puncta using IMA in MetaMorph software\n(A) A source image as confocal PSD95 image selected for specific objects based on length, breadth, and area filters.\n(B) A display of filtering parameters in IMA.\n(C) Object data for the synaptic puncta obtained through IMA.\n(D) A binary IMA object mask created as an output image.\n(E and F) Dynamic data exchange command for exporting the object data on postsynaptic puncta to an excel file.\nCritical: Ensure that only the required parameters like length, breadth, and area are selected with a check mark in the filter menu from the IMA module dialog box. While all other parameters remain unchecked in the filter menu.\nOptional: Depending upon the kind of the research question being investigated, in cases where it is required to quantify the morphological and biophysical parameters of the synaptic puncta itself, the object data could also be exported and saved as an excel file. For this, select the object data tab from IMA module. For logging data into an excel file, select open log. This opens an object log dialog box, then log measurements to Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) on the object log dialog box. It will export the data to an excel file by logging the data to the file after pressing F9 (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, 5E, and 5F).\nNote: Apart from measuring individual synaptic puncta parameters through IMA as an object log, IMA can also quantify a summary of the information as a summary log. For the later, select the summary tab from the IMA module. The data could be similarly exported to an excel file, as described in the previous step.",
    "Note: IMA module can perform analysis of various types of morphological and biophysical parameters related to the area, dimension, and intensity. According to the user question and need; these parameters could be customised by opting select measurement tab from the IMA module. It will open the select measurements dialog box where the useful parameters could be selected as per the user requirement.\nCreate ROIs on the filtered objects (refer above to step f). Draw ROIs around all filtered objects or synaptic puncta. From the region menu, select create regions around objects and the source image selected should be the IMA objects mask created in step g (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). The boundary of the regions drawn around each object is marked with a yellow color (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Creating ROIs on the filtered objects in MetaMorph software\n(A) Region menu displaying several options like creating regions around objects or transferring regions from one image to another.\n(B) Creating ROIs around the objects filtered with IMA object mask as the source image. The ROIs are marked in yellow color.\nSave the ROIs drawn in the previous step to a region file. From regions menu, select save regions. This function will save all ROIs to a region (.rgn) file. The multiple ROIs saved to a region file can be reloaded to the image of interest, for instance, IMA object mask through load regions function of the region menu.\nNote: The ROIs can also be transferred from one image to a different image using transfer regions function of the region menu. ROIs can also be cleared from an image using clear all regions function from region menu (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).",
    "Note: Here, the detection of synaptic puncta is shown for the postsynaptic puncta filtered from the rest of the dendrite from confocal PSD95 images. Similar analysis (steps 1–7) can be performed on epifluorescence or confocal images of markers for different functional zones of an excitatory synapse like presynapse, postsynapse or perisynapse to identify pre/post/perisynaptic puncta.\nPerform semiautomated detection of functional zones of an excitatory synapse as follows:\nLoad background corrected and calibrated (steps 1–5) STED image of the protein of interest in MetaMorph. In this case, a postsynaptic marker PSD95 STED image is opened in MetaMorph. PSD95 is a marker for postsynaptic density, and PSD95 STED image could be used to segment PSD from the rest of the dendrite (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Semiautomated detection of functional zones (PSD) of an excitatory synapse using MetaMorph software\n(A and C) STED PSD95 image and a corresponding binary IMA object mask with regions created around objects segmented as PSD regions using IMA. The filtered PSDs are marked in green while the region boundaries are shown in yellow.\n(B and D) The IMA and thresholding parameters employed for filtering PSDs from STED PSD95 image as a source image.\nPerform object-based segmentation as described previously in steps 7b–7d. However, in contrast, to step 7d, select objects with intensity higher than average intensity added to two times the standard deviation of the intensity of the entire image. Here, average intensity plus two times the standard deviation of the intensity is 36 gray levels (rounding off to the nearest integer) (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B–7D).\nFilter objects through IMA similar to steps 7e and 7f and generate a binary IMA object mask as an output image (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B–7D).",
    "Note: As mentioned previously in step 7f (optional), if desired, the PSD quantitative data can also be exported to an excel file to reveal information about the morphological and biophysical traits of PSD.\nCreate ROIs and save all ROIs to a region file similar to steps 7g and 7h (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nNote: Here, the detection of synaptic functional zone is shown for the postsynaptic density filtered from STED PSD95 images. Similar analysis (step 8) can be performed on STED images of markers for different zones of the synapse to identify cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ), postsynaptic density (PSD) and endocytic zone (EZ) functional compartments of an excitatory pre/post/perisynapse from rest of the neuronal processes (Kedia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Venkatesan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nSuper-resolution cluster analysis\nTiming: several hours (depending on the number of images)\nDuring the first step of image analysis, the synapses (pre/post/peri) or the functional zones of the synapse (CAZ/PSD/EZ) are filtered. The region files saved in the previous step denotes the detected functional compartments from the confocal/STED synaptic marker image (reference image). In this second step, STED super-resolution images (subject image) of proteins of interest (APP in this protocol) are analyzed to quantify nano-clusters of molecular aggregation. It outlines a method to quantify nanodomains of any protein in different functional compartments of a synapse from super resolution images using PALMTracer (Izeddin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Kechkar et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Nair et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), a custom software integrated as a plugin of MetaMorph (Molecular Devices).\nLoad subject image, i.e., super resolved STED image of proteins of interest (STED APP here) in TIFF format into MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

Arrows indicate domains of APP clustering to indicate region with high fluorescence intensity.\nNote: Perform TIFF file conversion and subtract all the subject images similarly as described in steps 1–5 in the section semiautomated detection of dendritic compartments and functional zones of an excitatory synapse.\nInvert the contrast using CTRL + I command and select a pseudocolor display mode from look-up table (LUT). It will code the intensity with pseudocolor from white (minimum) to black (maximum) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nPerform super resolution cluster analysis of proteins of interest in functional zones of an excitatory synapse as follows:\nNotice domains of APP clustering to indicate regions where fluorescence intensity is higher (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nNote: It can be easily detected in contrast inverted pseudocolor mode where high fluorescence intensity regions are color coded.\nOpen file menu and select run user program to open the PALMTracer plugin running inside MetaMorph (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A and 9B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/593-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

    "In data tab of PALMTracer, check source image selected should be STED APP (subject image), tick high resolution destination, select zoom (XY sampling) as 1 and tick autosave to save data generated automatically (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C and 9D).\nIn options tab, input spatial calibration as 0.015 μm (sampling 15 nm during imaging). (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).\nIn filtering tab, tick filtering, ROI, all, and HR ROI. This step is to enable super resolution cluster analysis only in the selected ROIs (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E).\nIn special tab, tick watershed (algorithm inbuilt in the MetaMorph program to improve the separation of closely spaced objects in an image) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F). Select bi-dimensional Gaussian fitting for the cluster analysis as fitting XY sigma X sigma Y (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F). Select sigma for the Gaussian fit as 1, size for Gaussian fitting as 7 (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) pixels and theta (free angle in degrees) as 45 degrees (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F). Tick sort axes to extract both the principal (length) as well as auxiliary axes (width) for quantifying traits of nanodomains (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F). This step performs fitting on each APP cluster that is detected as a domain. Do not change other default settings.\nSet threshold as auto threshold (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). It is set to 27 gray levels for the STED APP image (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F).\nNote: The threshold should be empirically determined by the user for different categories of protein. Mostly, it should be either kept close to the auto threshold or to 80% of the auto threshold. However, once the threshold is fixed to either auto or 80% of auto threshold for a particular class of protein, it should be kept consistent across all the images for which cluster analysis is needed for that specific protein to avoid biasness in the results.",
    "From regions menu, select load regions tab and load STED PSD95 regions saved in step 8d on the STED APP image (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D). This step ensures that APP cluster analysis is performed only on the regions where PSD is detected.\nNote: In this protocol, as an example, we have shown the detection of APP nanodomains which are localized to the PSD. However, depending upon the markers for the functional zones of the synapse, the analysis can be extended to understand the subsynaptic compartmentalization of the proteins of interest in either synaptic puncta (pre/post/perisynapse) or different functional zones of the synapse (CAZ/PSD/EZ).\nSelect analyze clusters tab on special menu of the PALMTracer plugin (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F). This step performs bi-dimensional Gaussian fitting on each nanodomain segregated to the PSD. While the domains which are not fitted are automatically excluded from the final data generated."
