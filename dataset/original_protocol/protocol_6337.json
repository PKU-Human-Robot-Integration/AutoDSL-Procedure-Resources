    "Single-cell internalization assay using MG-B-TauDay 1: Prepare cellsPlate FAP-EGFR expressing cells at ~20% confluence in a 12-well plate with 18 mm diameter glass coverslips in 1 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS per well.Day 2: Serum-starve cells overnight to minimize the FAP-EGFR activityAspirate the media and wash each well with 0.5 ml of 37 °C prewarmed PBS.Add 1 ml of 37 °C prewarmed starvation media (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA) to each well.Day 3: Treat and perform fluorescence microscopy imagingIf inhibitors are to be tested, pretreat as required and then proceed as below:Prepare an aliquot of intermediate MG-B-Tau solution (1:3 dilution of 150 μM working stock in H2O) and add 1 μl to each well to a final MG-B-Tau concentration of 50 nM.Incubate at room temperature for 30-60 s protected from light.Treatment:For time course experiments, mount the coverslip into a 37 °C prewarmed microscope stage adaptor. Fill it with 0.9 ml of the same media. Place the adaptor on the microscope stage. Perform time-lapse imaging using spinning disk confocal system with 63x N.A. 1.4 oil immersion objective through the 640 nm channel (excitation 640 nm, emission 680 nm) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Acquire a Z-stack of two-dimensional (512 x 512 pixels) confocal images at 300 nm intervals for each time point. Acquire at least one Z-stack before adding 100 μl of the treatment to be tested prepared in starvation media (final volume is 1 ml). Acquire all images using the same parameters.Notes: If labeled ligand is used as treatment, imaging through an additional filter channel is performed. Different fluorescently labeled EGF conjugates are commercially available. We recommend EGF-rhodamine (EGF-Rh) as rhodamine is a bright and photostable fluorophore directly conjugated to EGF (Pinilla-Macua and Sorkin, 2015).",
    "EGF-Rh is detected through the 561 nm channel (excitation at 561 nm; emission at 580 nm). Because x-axis resolution in our system is ~600-700 nm, z-stack of images were acquired at 300-nm steps, which approximately corresponds to Nyquist sampling. The speed of image acquisition is limited by the minimal exposure time (typically hundreds of milliseconds) necessary to obtain an image with the high signal-to-noise ratio. The image acquisition parameters (laser power, exposure times, imaging times, etc.) are established using the experimental conditions of maximum FAP-EGFR endocytosis, e.g., maximal accumulation of FAP-EGFR in vesicular structures and minimal FAP-EGFR fluorescence at cell edges (plasma membrane). In our experiments, the EMCCD Evolve camera with the linear detection range is used. Images are acquired with the maximum fluorescence intensity of less than ~90% of the detection saturation. Typically, specific fluorescence intensity is more than 5-fold higher than the background at the plasma membrane and more than 30-fold in endosomal compartments. Certainly, other camera- or photomultiplier-based systems can be utilized in this protocol. Single-cell internalization assay using pH-sensitive MG-Bis-SADay 1: Prepare cellsPlate FAP-EGFR expressing cells at ~20% confluence in a 12-well plate with 18 mm diameter glass coverslips in 1 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS per well.Day 2: Serum-starve cells overnight to minimize the FAP-EGFR activityAspirate the media and wash each well with 0.5 ml of 37 °C prewarmed PBS.Add 1 ml of 37 °C prewarmed starvation media (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA) to each well.Day 3: Treat and perform fluorescence microscopy imagingIf inhibitors are to be used, pretreat as required and then proceed as below:Prepare an intermediate solution of MG-Bis-SA (1:3 dilution of the 300 μM working stock in H2O). Add 1 μl to each well to achieve the final concentration of 100 nM.Incubate at room temperature for 30-60 s protected from light.",
    "Treatment:For time course experiments, mount the coverslip into a prewarmed microscope stage adaptor. Fill it with 0.9 ml of the same media. Place the adaptor on the microscope stage. Perform time-lapse imaging using spinning disk confocal system with the 63x 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective through the FRET channel (excitation at 561 nm; emission at 680 nm) and 640 nm channel (excitation 640 nm, emission 680 nm) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Acquire z-stack of two-dimensional confocal images (512 x 512) at 300 nm intervals at each time point. Acquire at least one z-stack before adding 100 μl of treatment prepared in starvation media (final volume is 1 ml). Acquire all images with the same parameters.For single-time point imaging add 100 μl of treatment prepared in starvation media for a desired time (final volume 1.0 ml). Stop EGFR trafficking by placing the 12-well plate on ice. Wash cells with 0.5 ml of cold PBS per well and add 1 ml of cold Buffer pH 8; place the cells on ice (cells cannot be fixed otherwise pH difference between compartments disappears). Image immediately as described above for time course imaging.Note: The image acquisition parameters (laser power, exposure times, imaging times, etc.) are established using the experimental conditions of maximum FAP-EGFR endocytosis, e.g., maximal accumulation of FAP-EGFR in vesicular structures and minimal FAP-EGFR fluorescence at cell edges (plasma membrane). In our experiments, the EMCCD Evolve camera with the linear detection range is used. Images are acquired with the maximum fluorescence intensity of less than ~90% of the detection saturation. Typically, specific fluorescence intensity for both 640 nm and 561 nm channels can be more than 30-fold higher than background in endosomal structures.",
    "The specific fluorescence signal of cell-surface FAP-EGFR for the 640 nm channel is at least 5-fold higher than the background whereas the signal through the 561 nm channel typically does not exceed 2-fold over the background signal. Certainly, other camera- or photomultiplier-based systems can be used in this protocol. Internalization assay in 96-well platesDay 1: Prepare cellsPlate FAP-EGFR expressing cells in an optical 96-well plate at 30% confluency (~9,000 cells per well). Because the duplication time of HeLa cells is ~24 h, they typically reach 100% confluency (~30,000 cell/well–required for consistent results) after 2 days of growth including serum starvation overnight. Other cell lines with different growth rates can be plated at different initial confluency.Note: For siRNA studies instead of seeding cells on Day 1, perform reverse transfection of cells on Day 0 following manufacturer’s instructions. Day 2: Serum-starve cells overnightAspirate the media and wash with 100 μl of 37 °C prewarmed PBS.Replenish with 100 μl of 37 °C prewarmed starvation media (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA) to minimize basal FAP-EGFR activity.Day 3: EGFR internalization assayIf inhibitors are to be tested, pretreat as required and then proceed as below:Aspirate media with stainless steel manifold.For each 96-well plate, prepare 6 ml DMEM containing 2 μl MG-Bis-SA of 300 μM working stock solution (final concentration 100 nM).Add 50 μl per well of the 100 nM MG-Bis-SA solution using an eight-channel pipette in the dispense mode. Keep at least 2 wells without MG-Bis-SA for background measurements. Those wells are to be incubated with 50 μl DMEM alone.Incubate at room temperature for 30-60 s protected from light. Aspirate the medium with the stainless-steel manifold and wash each well once with 100 μl of 37 °C prewarmed PBS.",
    "Note: For pH calibration curve: Apply series of buffer solutions (100 μl per well) with pH ranging from 4.8 to 8.1 at room temperature (see Recipes below). Use at least 2 wells for each pH. Image immediately. See an example of the calibration curve in our recent paper (Larsen et al., 2019) and Figure 2. Apply 100 μl per well of starvation media containing EGF and/or other compounds using the 12-channel pipette.Note: If inhibitors are used, add them again in the “treatment” medium. Incubate at 37 °C for a desired time. A maximum accumulation of EGFR in endosomes is typically after 15-30 min of continuous internalization in EGF-stimulated cells, and thus such incubation times are most optimal for the measurements of internalization rates. At later times, contribution of the degradation and recycling of EGF:EGFR complexes into the relative amount of internalized EGFR is significant.Notes: For time-course assays, start incubations by adding EGF and/or other compounds to wells that are to be incubated for the longest times and finish with adding treatment media to the wells that are to be incubated for the shortest time. In this way, all incubations are finished at the same time, which allows simultaneous termination of endocytosis and imaging of all wells (see below). For dose-response assays, keep at least 2 wells (labeled with MG-Bis-SA) untreated by adding 100 μl of the starvation media without stimuli or inhibitors. These wells are used to measure basal internalization rates. Place the cells on ice to stop endocytosis.Aspirate the treatment media with the stainless-steel manifold and add 200 μl of cold Buffer pH 8 to each well (mild extracellular alkalization maximizes the pH difference between the plasma membrane and endosomal FAP-EGFR). Keep cells on ice until imaging.Image immediately by automated confocal imaging using 40x 1.",
    "15 NA water immersion objective. Capture and stich nine (3 x 3) image fields per well using both FRET channel (excitation 561 nm; emission 700/75 nm) and 640 nm channel (excitation 640 nm, emission 700/75 nm), and pinhole of 5.Notes: This assay is based on a single-plane confocal image (2-D) of the large area of cell monolayer. A large pinhole (5) ensures a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while reduced z-axis resolution, thus preventing small changes in the focal plane that might occur during automated multi-well imaging. Reduced x-y-axis resolution when using pinhole of 5 is not detrimental to these measurements. The image acquisition parameters (laser power, exposure times, etc.) are set using the experimental conditions of maximum FAP-EGFR endocytosis, e.g., maximum high 561/640 ratio (see data analysis below). The signal counts should be in the order of thousands.Adaptation for cells sensitive to medium and temperature changes: For each 96-well plate prepare 6 ml DMEM containing 6 μl MG-Bis-SA of 300 μM working stock solution.Add 50 μl per well of the MG-Bis-SA solution using an eight-channel pipette in the dispense mode (final volume 150 μl, final concentration 100 nM). Keep at least 2 wells without MG-Bis-SA for background measurements. Add 50 μl DMEM alone to those wells.Incubate at room temperature for 30-60 s protected from light.Aspirate the medium with the stainless-steel manifold.Proceed as indicated above in Step C3e."
