    "Procedural guidelinesNotes: Perform all steps at room temperature (20-25 °C) unless noted otherwise. Use solutions and equipment sterilized by autoclavation or filter sterilization. Always use microbiological aseptic techniques and work in a sterile facility when handling moss. Perform all centrifugation steps at 200 x g with slow acceleration and breaking speeds* unless noted otherwise.*Acceleration speed 2 and deceleration speed 4 when using the HeraeusTM MultifugeTM X1R (Thermo Fisher). Protoplasts generation Moss preparationNote: Blend the moss twice before use, with at least 7 days gap between each blend. Add 5 mM of ammonium tartrate to grow the moss. After the second blend, use the moss on either 4th or 5th day for transformation. Filter 5-day old protonemal moss tissue by straining through 70 µm cell strainer.Place the cell strainer on a 50 ml Falcon tube. Filter 40 ml of moss culture through the strainer to collect the moss on top (Figure 1). Transfer the cell strainer onto a new Falcon tube and repeat the filtration step multiple times to collect ~1.5 g of moss.Transfer the cell strainer with collected moss on a fresh 50 ml Falcon tube. Pass 50 ml of autoclaved demineralized water through the strainer to wash and remove the traces of BCD media from the moss. Repeat this washing step 4-5 times.Split the collected moss from the strainer into five 50 ml Falcon tubes using a sterile forcep. Each tube should contain approximately 200 to 300 mg of vegetal tissue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200922/20200922223632_0627.jpgFigure 1.

Passing moss culture through the strainer to collect the moss on top.Enzyme solution (prepare fresh)Prepare enzyme solution in a glass beaker by adding 750 mg of Cellulase Onozuka R-10 to 50 ml of PM media.",
    "Stir using magnetic bead to dissolve the salt, until the solution looks clear.Once the Cellulase completely dissolves, add 250 mg of Macerozyme R-10 and dissolve completely as before.Note: The systematic addition of both salts ensures their complete dissolution. The enzyme solution at this point should have a light brown color. Transfer the enzyme solution to a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 5,000 g for 2 min (set the acceleration and deceleration speed pf centrifuge to 9).Avoid the pellet and filter sterilize the supernatant by using 0.45 µm syringe filter into a new 50 ml Falcon tube, inside the LAF bench.Divide 10 ml of sterile enzyme solution to five Falcon tubes containing moss (from Step A4), shake to suspend and transfer the mixture to five sterile Petri-dishes.Incubate the protonemal tissue in the enzyme solution for at least 3 h at 30 °C in dark. After 1.5 h, microscopically assess the number of free-floating protoplasts in a drop of digested solution, followed by assessing after every 30 min. Proceed when most of the protonemal tissue has been digested.IMPORTANT! Moss protoplasts are very fragile and can easily be damaged by disturbances. When handling protoplasts, proceed with extreme caution and avoid physical disruption. Use pipette tips with a wide opening (cut the tip of regular pipette tips with a heated sterile scalpel) and draw up protoplast suspensions slowly to avoid disruption caused by suction. Never vortex protoplast suspensions. Perform all steps under sterile conditions inside a LAF Bench.Isolate protoplastsRecover the protoplasts by filtering the suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer. Wash the Petri-dishes with 2-3 ml of PM to dissolve any leftover moss sticking to the surface, and filter this as well through the mesh, to collect all protoplasts.",
    "Again, pass the digested solution through 40 μm mesh to further remove cell debris and undigested protonema.Collect the filtrate in 50 ml Falcon tubes and distribute to five 10 ml round bottomed glass tubes.Note: Use additional glass tube with 10 ml water to balance while centrifugation. Centrifuge the protoplast suspension for 10 min at 200 x g, 22 °C.Carefully decant the supernatant using a pipette rather than inverting the tube. This avoids the risk of losing the pellet as protoplasts pellet is not tightly adhered to walls of tube. While pipetting leave behind small volume of supernatant so that the protoplast pellet remains immersed.Resuspend the protoplast pellet in approximately 1 ml PW solution by gently shaking the tube. Collect the protoplast suspensions from all tubes into one and add PW to obtain a total volume of 10 ml.Repeat Steps C4 and C5.Resuspend the protoplast pellet in 3 ml PW solution by gently shaking the tube. Estimate the protoplast density with a Haemocytometer. Count the number of protoplasts on both grid areas (see Figure 2 for an image of protoplasts) and use the average to estimate the number of protoplasts.TOTAL VOLUME OF THE GRID AREA ON THE HEMOCYTOMETER:1 mm × 1 mm × 0.1 mm = 0.1 mm3ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PROTOPLASTS IN THE SOLUTION:Protoplasts on grid area × 104 × total volume in ml = number of protoplastsRepeat Step C4.Carefully decant most of the supernatant using a pipette and stop pipetting when the pellet starts to dissolve.Resuspend the protoplast pellet in required amount of MMM solution to obtain a final concentration of 1.6 x 106 protoplasts/ml.FINAL VOLUME MMM-PROTOPLASTS SUSPENTION:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200922/20200922224122_3141.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200922/20200922223653_4390.jpgFigure 2.

    "B is the ideal situation after the treatment. C. Undigested protonema tissue.Protoplast transformationFor each transformation, transfer 20 µg of DNA to the bottom of a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube.Note: Use 20 µg DNA in a volume not greater than 30-50 µl. STEPS 2-6 ARE TIME SENSITIVE Add 300 µl of protoplast suspension (from Step C11) and 300 µl of sterile PEG-MCT solution to the DNA and mix by gently tapping the tube.Incubate the mixture in a water bath at 45 °C for 5 min, followed by 5 min incubation at room temperature. Meanwhile melt PRMT medium using a microwave. Keep the melted PRMT in a water bath at 45 °C.Add 300 µl PW solution to the “protoplast-PEG-DNA suspension\" five times, with the interval of 1 min between each dilution.Now add 1 ml PW solution five times with the interval of 1 min between each dilution.Centrifuge the transformed protoplasts for 3 min at 200 x g. Carefully decant the supernatant using a pipette. At this point, the protoplast pellet may not be visible, so leave a little amount (~300 µl) of supernatant back while pipetting.Resuspend the protoplasts in 500 µl PW solution.Add 10 mM CaCl2 to the warm PRMT medium (maintained at 45 °C). Now add 2.5 ml of this CaCl2-PRMT mixture to the protoplast suspension and tap the Falcon tube to mix gently.Distribute 1 ml of this mixture among three PRMB plates covered with single sterile cellophane disc.Note: Slowly distribute the protoplast suspension on PRMT plate, while simultaneously and gently spreading the mixture with your pipette tip as you proceed. This assures a uniform distribution and avoids the dome shaped gel blotch on the plate (cut the end of the 1,000 µl tip with a heated scalpel for this step).",
    "Let the protoplasts recover overnight in the dark at 25 °C.Note: To mimic dark conditions, cover each plate with aluminum foil. Incubate the plates in continuous light at 25 °C for 5 days.Transfer the cellophane discs with protoplast containing PRMT-layer onto antibiotic containing BCD plates. Cultivate the moss under standard growth conditions (16 h day/8 h night cycle) at 25 °C and proceed with the selection of positive transformants."
