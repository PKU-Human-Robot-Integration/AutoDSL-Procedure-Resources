    "See Figure 1 for an illustration summarizing the protocol.\n1. Purification of Baculovirus Plasmid DNA\nGrow bacterial culture containing baculoviral plasmid DNA (bacmid)14 in 200 mL of LB broth with antibiotics; kanamycin (50 µg/mL), tetracycline (10 µg/mL), and gentamycin (7 µg/mL), for 16 h at 37 °C on an orbital shaker setting at 300 rpm.\nPurify the bacmid DNA from the bacterial culture using standard alkaline lysis protocol15, and dissolve the bacmid in TE buffer.\n2. Production of Baculovirus\nCulture Sf9 cells in an orbital shaker incubator at 135 rpm and 28 °C in a polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flask containing serum-free insect culture medium1,2,3.\nNote: If Sf9 cells are thawed from frozen stock, allow at least two weeks for the cells to recover and enter the exponential phase of growth.\nCount the Sf9 cells harvested at exponential phase of growth with a hemocytometer after staining with Trypan blue. Seed 1 x 106 viable Sf9 cells per well in a 6-well tissue culture-treated plate in 2 mL of medium. Allow the cell to attach for 1 h at 28 °C in an incubator.\nReplace the growth medium with 1 mL of serum-free unsupplemented Grace's insect culture medium.\nTransfect the bacmid DNA into the Sf9 cells using insect cell transfection reagent.\n\t\nMix 8 µL insect cell transfection reagent with 100 µL of Grace's Insect medium.\nDilute 2 µg of bacmid DNA into 100 µL of unsupplemented insect medium, and mix gently by vortexing.\nCombine the diluted DNA with the diluted insect cell transfection reagent, and mix gently. Incubate for 15 to 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd the DNA-lipid mixture dropwise onto the cells. Incubate at 28 °C in an incubator for approximately 5 h.\nRemove the transfection mixture from the cells and wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS.",
    "Add 2 mL of insect culture medium and continue to culture at 28 °C in an incubator without changing the media.\nNote: If the bacmid contains a fluorescent protein, its expression can be detected in cells 48 h post-transfection. Baculovirus is produced by transfected Sf9 cells and secreted into the culture medium which subsequently infects the untransfected cells. The entire cell population becomes infected with baculovirus in 5 days and shows signs of viral infection, also called cytopathic effect. These include increased cell diameter, vacuoles/granules in the cytoplasm, cessation of cell growth and dead or lysed cells are present in cell culture. However, if the transfection or infection efficiency is not optimal, the culture may not show an obvious cytopathic effect. The cytopathic effect can be visualized with an inverted phase microscope at 200 - 400X magnification. Baculovirus infected cell can be detected by staining with anti-gp64 antibody11.\nHarvest baculovirus supernatant 5 days after transfection and label as the P1 virus stock.\nStore the baculovirus supernatant, which is light sensitive, in the dark with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Store at 4 °C for the short-term (up to 90 days) or at -80 °C for the long-term.\nSeed 6 × 106 Sf9 cells in a 10-cm tissue culture-treated plate in 10 mL of insect culture medium. Add 1 mL of initial baculovirus supernatant (P1) to the cells.\nHarvest baculovirus supernatant (P2) at 5th day post-infection.\nSeed 50 mL of Sf9 cells (3 x 106 cells/mL) in suspension culture in insect culture medium in a 250-mL polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flask and place the flask in an orbital shaker incubator. Add 2 mL of P2 stock to the cells and shake at 135 rpm while maintaining a constant temperature of 28 °C.",
    "Note: Three or four days after infection, the entire Sf9 cell population will show cytopathic effect, which is an indication of high-titer baculovirus production.\nSequentially amplify the baculovirus supernatants until the desired volume is obtained (P3, P4, ….) by increasing 10 to 50-fold volume of cell culture in each subsequent infection.\nNote: P3 is the 3rd round of infection in which 500 mL to 1 L of Sf9 cell culture can be infected with 10 to 20 mL of P2 baculovirus supernatant; P4 is the 4th round of infection in which 5 to 10 L of Sf9 cell culture can be infected with 100 to 200 mL of P3 baculovirus supernatant, and so on. Typically, Sf9 cells are seeded at 3 × 106 cells/mL in serum-free insect culture media.\nCentrifuge the baculovirus supernatant at 1,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and treat the baculovirus supernatant with 50 units/mL nuclease (250 units/µL of stock) for 2 h at 37 °C to digest the genomic DNA and RNA. Filter the supernatants through a 0.45 μm filtration unit.\n3. Preparation of the Chromatography System\nPrepare the chromatography system by sequentially rinsing the sample and buffer lines each with sterile water, 1 N sodium hydroxide, water, and wash buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0) at a linear flow rate of 50 mL/min.\nPrepare a heparin 50 µm column (10 × 10 cm, 7.9 mL of column volume (CV)) by sequentially running column cleaning buffer (5 CV sterile 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 M sodium chloride, pH 7.0) and 5 CV wash buffer at a linear flow rate of 7 mL/min.\n4. Purification of Baculovirus Vector\nSet up the chromatography system as follows:",
    "Use the sample loading inlet port for loading the baculovirus supernatant.\nUse the buffer inlet port A1 for loading the wash buffer. Prepare a bottle with at least 500 mL of wash buffer and place the wash buffer line into the bottle.\nUse the buffer inlet port A2 for loading the elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate with 1.5 M sodium chloride, pH 8.0). Prepare a bottle with at least 500 mL of elution buffer and place the elution buffer line into the bottle.\nInsert several 50 mL conical tubes into the fraction collector to collect the column pass-through baculovirus supernatant, the wash buffer, and the eluted baculovirus.\nEquilibrate the heparin column with five 7.9 mL column volumes (CVs) of wash buffer (40 mL) at a linear flow rate of 7.0 mL/min.\nLoad 250 mL of baculovirus supernatant onto the heparin column using the sample pump (inlet sample port) of the chromatography system at a linear flow rate of 2.0 mL/min.\nRun 10 CVs (80 mL) of wash buffer through heparin column at a linear flow rate of 2.0 mL/min until the ultraviolet (UV) absorbance curve (280 nm) has returned to baseline and becomes stable.\nElute the baculovirus particles from the 7.9 mL heparin column with 5 CVs (40 mL) of elution buffer at a linear flow rate of 4.0 mL/min. Watch for a sharp elution peak of protein on the chromatogram when the baculovirus particles dissociate from the heparin column.\nPost-elution, immediately dilute the eluted baculovirus supernatant 10-fold using 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer in water to prevent inactivation of baculovirus particles from osmotic shock during subsequent centrifugation.",
    "Store 100 µL of each of the fractions, including the column flow-through collected during loading of the baculovirus supernatant, the wash buffer, and the eluate. Infect these baculovirus fractions to HT1080 to evaluate the purification process (See section 6).\nClean the column with column cleaning buffer and wash buffer. Finally, rinse the column with 5 CV sterile 20% ethanol in water at a linear flow rate of 7.0 mL/min and store at 4 °C.\nClean the chromatography system with water, 1 N sodium hydroxide, again with water, and 20% ethanol in water at a linear flow rate of 50.0 mL/min and store the system in 20% ethanol.\n5. Concentration of Baculovirus\nPre-sterilize centrifuge tubes using an autoclave. Add an equal volume of baculovirus supernatant to each ultracentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood. Measure the tube weight by a balance and adjust the weight of the contents of the ultracentrifuge tubes with sterile PBS.\nPlace each of the ultracentrifuge tubes in opposing bucket of the SW 32 Ti rotor.\nRun the ultracentrifuge at 80,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C.\nOpen the ultracentrifuge tubes in a tissue culture hood and aseptically aspirate the liquid without removing the baculovirus pellet.\nResuspend the pellet of each tube by vigorously pipetting up and down with 200 µL PBS containing 0.5% (w/vol) BSA.\nTransfer the concentrated baculovirus to cryovials (50 to 100 µL per vial) and store at -80 °C.\n6. Titration of Baculovirus",
    "The day before infection, count HT1080 cells using a hemocytometer after staining cells with Trypan blue. Seed 1 x 105 HT1080 cells per well in a 6-well plate in 2 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Seed several additional wells to be able to determine the exact number of cells present at the time of infection. Culture the cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nNote: HT1080 cells are used for titration as they express a higher level of heparan sulfate as compared to the other cell lines16. Since HT1080 cells are adherent, titration is simpler and less time consuming as compared to using the traditional Sf9-based titration.\nOn the day of infection, determine the number of cells per well by counting cells from wells. Infect the cells by adding the diluted original baculovirus which had been set aside prior to column purification, and with samples from the column flow-through, wash, and elution fractions. For each sample, determine the dilution and volume empirically based on infectious baculovirus particles, and infect each well in triplicate.\nTwo days after infection, analyze the cells for the expression of the gene of interest. Cells can be analyzed using a flow cytometer if they express a fluorescent protein (e.g. GFP)17.\nCalculate the titers (infectious unit per mL) based on the number of cells present at the time of infection, the dilution factor, and percentages of fluorescent protein in cells using the formula: (Number of cells during infection × percentage of fluorescent protein positive cells × dilution factor)/volume of baculovirus in mL.",
    "Note: For example, if total number of cells per well at the time of infection is 1.2 × 105, the percentage of fluorescent protein is 5%, the dilution factor is 100, and the volume of diluted baculovirus added is 10 µL, the titer is 6 × 107 infectious units (IU)/mL.\nSubscription Required.
