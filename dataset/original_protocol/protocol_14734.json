    "Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh frozen prostate cancer samples were obtained from the SFVAMC. Samples were from prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at SFVAMC. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Alternatively, prostate cancer tissues microarrays were procured from commercial sources and used for miRNA analyses by ISH. Clinicopathological and follow up information for analyzed prostate cancer patients was collected.\n1. Tissue Samples\nCut prostate cancer tissue samples into 10 µm sections using a microtome and stain with H & E following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nReview stained slides for the identification of prostate cancer foci as well as adjacent normal glandular epithelium.\n\tNote: A board certified pathologist should review the H & E stained slides and mark for tumor and normal areas. Use the marked slides as guides in the subsequent sections for miRNA analyses from tumor vs normal areas.\n2. miRNA Expression Analyses by Quantitative Real-time PCR\nNote: This workflow involves the following steps: Laser Capture microdissection, isolation of total RNA (including miRNA and mRNA), assaying of mature miRNAs using the TaqMan MicroRNA expression assays as detailed in the following sections.\nRNA Extraction\n\t\nIsolation of miRNA from Prostate Cancer FFPE Tissues\n\t\t\nLaser capture microdissection (LCM)\n\t\t\tNote: Perform steps 2.1.1.1.1- 2.1.1.1.4 in a chemical fume hood.\n\t\t\t\nPrepare tissue slides (10 µm sections) for LCM. Deparrafinize tissue sections by soaking in Xylene (2x), for 10 min each, then rehydrate the tissues by incubating the slides for 5 min each in graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%) followed by distilled water (5 min).\nFollowing rehydration, stain sections with hematoxylin for 30 sec followed by water.\nPlace tissues in graded ethanol (70%, 95% 90%, 80%, 70%) (5 min each) and xylene (5 min).",
    "Dry slides in a fume hood and then place in the LCM instrument for microdissection.\nPerform microdissections with the LCM System in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions24. Use pathologist marked up slides as guides for the identification of prostate cancer foci as well as adjacent normal tissue. Use the laser beam at a 10-20 µm diameter pulses with a power of 70-90 mW.\nCapture areas of interest with infrared laser pulses onto LCM caps. Combine cells from 2-5 caps for miRNA extraction per sample. To ensure integrity of extracted RNA, immediately process captured cells for miRNA extraction.\nAlternatively, lyse cells in the miRNA extraction buffer (according to manufacturer’s protocol) and store lysates at -80 ºC.\nmiRNA Extraction and Analyses from LCM Microdissected Tissues\n\t\t\t\nExtract total RNA from microdissected FFPE tissues using a commercial kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\t\t\tNote: The yield of RNA from laser capture miscrodissection is typically low. Therefore, RNA is eluted into low volumes (20-30 µl) and used for expression profiling using Taqman microRNA expression assays following manufacturer’s instructions (also described in section 2.2). Optimization of input RNA for real time PCR detection of mature miRNAs suggests that 5 µl of the eluted RNA is optimal for each miRNA-specific reverse transcription reaction. As an endogenous control, RNU48/RNU24 is used. For control reactions, 2 µl of the eluted RNA is used for the reverse transcription reaction.\nIsolation of miRNA from Prostate Cancer Frozen Tissues\n\t\t\nHomogenize frozen resected prostate tissues by grinding the tissues in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Transfer homogenized tissue to a microcentrifuge tube using a cooled spatula. Maintain the mortar/pestle and spatula at the same temperature by dipping in liquid nitrogen so homogenized tissue can be easily transferred.",
    "Add commercial guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol reagent (1 ml/0.1 g of tissue) to the homogenized tissue and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n\t\t\tNote: Homogenized tissues in the commercial guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol reagent can be stored at -80 ºC for several months.\nAdd chloroform to the homogenate (0.2 ml chloroform/ml) and shake vigorously for 30 sec. Incubate samples at RT for 3-5 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4 ºC.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a fresh sterile RNase-free 1.5 ml tube.\nAdd an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. Mix and incubate for 10 min at RT followed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 ºC to pellet the RNA.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant. Dry RNA pellets at RT for 5-10 min. Dissolve RNA in 50-100 µl nuclease-free water.\nPerform quantification of RNA using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and determine RNA integrity with a bioanalyzer. Adjust RNA concentrations to 10 ng/µl. Use 10-50 ng RNA for miRNA- specific cDNA reaction followed by real-time PCR analyses (Section 2.2).\nQuantitative Real-time PCR for miRNA Expression Analyses\n\tNote: Assay mature miRNAs using a two-step RT-PCR protocol as described below.\n\t\nReverse Transcription (RT)\n\t\t\nReverse transcribe cDNA from RNA using a miRNA reverse transcription kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Use 10-50 ng of total RNA with miRNA specific primer from the MicroRNA Assays and RT kit. Use RNU48/RNU24/RNU6B as controls. Dilute cDNA 1:5 to 1:10 (depending on the abundance of the analyzed miRNA) and use in Real-time PCR detection as described in the following step.\nReal-time PCR for Detection of Mature miRNA",
    "Amplify PCR products from cDNA samples using the MicroRNA assays with a Fast Universal master mix in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Normalize samples to RNU48/RNU24/RNU6B control. Use the comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method to calculate the relative changes in gene expression on the Fast Real Time PCR System. Analyze each sample in triplicate.\n3. miRNA Expression Analyses by In Situ Hybridization (ISH)\nPre-Treatment of Tissues\n\t\nCut 5 µm sections from FFPE prostate cancer tissue blocks using a microtome.\nFix tissue sections by incubating the slides at 56 °C for 1 hr.\n\t\tNote: Slides can be stored at RT for several weeks for miRNA analyses.\nDeparrafinize the tissues by soaking the slides with xylene (2x), for 15 min each.\nRehydrate the tissues by incubating the slides for 5 min each in graded ethanol (100% (2x), 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%) followed by distilled water (5 min).\nFix the slides with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min.\nWash the slides with PBS (2x) at room temperature for 5 min each.\nTreat the slides with 10 µg/ml Proteinase K at 37 ºC for 10 min in pre-warmed proteinase K buffer (5 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaCl).\nFollowing Proteinase-K treatment, rinse the slides with 0.2% glycine in PBS for 30 sec.\nWash slides in PBS (1x) at room temperature for 5 min.\nFix the slides with 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min.\nRinse slides with PBS for 5 min.\nHybridization\n\t\nPre-hybridize the slides with pre-hybridization solution for 3-4 hr at 55 ºC in a humidified chamber. Use tissue lab wipes soaked in 50% formamide/50% 5x SSC to keep the chamber humidified.",
    "Use 5’ digoxigenin labeled probes at a concentration of 20-50 nM in hybridization buffer. Dilute miRNA-specific probe (20-50 nM) and small nuclear RNA U6 control probe (20 nM), heat at 90 ºC for 4 min, place it on ice, and add to ice cold hybridization buffer (2-4 ng/µl).\nRemove pre-hybridization solution, add hybridization solution (probe + hybridization buffer, 100 µl per slide), incubate for 12-16 hr at probe-specific hybridization temperature (Hybridization temperature =Tm probe-21 ºC). Perform hybridizations in a humidified chamber (50% formamide/50% 5x SSC).\nWashing Steps\n\t\nWash the slides with 2x SSC for 10 min at 45 ºC.\nWash the slides with 1.5x SSC for 10 min at 45 ºC.\nWash the slides with 0.2x SSC (2x) at 37 ºC for 20 min each.\nIncubate slides with 1x blocking solution for 1-2 hr at room temperature\nDetection\n\t\nIncubate the slides with 1:100 PBS diluted AP-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody for 1-4 hr or overnight at 4 ºC.\nWash the slides with PBS (3x) at room temp for 10 min each.\nWash the slides (2x) with Alkaline Phosphatase buffer (100 mM Tris pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) at RT for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides in BM Purple AP substrate in the dark at RT for 1-20 hr.\nRinse the slides with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and wash (2x) in water.\nMount the slides using an aqueous mounting media and examine under a microscope.\nSubscription Required.
