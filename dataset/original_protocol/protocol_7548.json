    "Procedure to grow the seedlings for agar experiments and manually closed microfluidic chips Sterilize A. thaliana Col-0 (or line of interest) seeds with the method of your choice (e.g., chlorine gas; Lindsey et al., 2017).If the buffered solid 1/2 MS (see Recipes) is solidified, dissolve it completely in the microwave with the lid half unscrewed. If the medium has been kept at 60 °C after sterilization, proceed to the next step.Critical: The following steps have to be carried out under a sterile laminar flow hood.Pour 50 mL of buffered solid 1/2 MS into a square Petri dish and allow to solidify (approximately 15 min)Place approximately 10–20 sterilized Col-0 seeds (or line of interest) in a row (approximately 3 cm from the top) using a sterilized toothpick (or method of your choice).Close and seal the Petri dish with micropore tape.Transfer the plate to 4 °C for two days for stratification.Transfer the plate to the growth room for 4/5 days (primary root length between 2 and 4 cm). Note that seedlings need to fit the microscopy chamber.Note: Given the short-term aspect of the observations carried out, the experiments are performed in a non-sterile environment. Experiments with agar medium for the observation of stable membrane polarization states A video demonstrating these steps is available in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation of solid media in microscopy chambers for agar experiments Prepare an IAA 100 μM solution (see Recipes).Note: Steps are graphically represented in Figure 1 and demonstrated in Video 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4778/bioprotoc-13-14-4778-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of solid media in microscopy chambers for agar experiments Pour 40 mL of buffered 1/2 MS pH 5.8 agar medium (see Recipes) into a 50 mL tube.Wait a few minutes for the medium to cool down (until not burning in the hand).",
    "Add 60 μL of DISBAC2(3) from a 2 mM aliquot to make the final concentration 3 μM.Gently mix by inversion until the pink staining is uniform.Pour 20 mL of this solution into a Petri dish.Add 20 μL of IAA 100 μM into the leftover media in the tube to obtain a 100 nM final concentration (avoid agar temperature above 60 °C).Gently mix by inversion.Pour the IAA supplemented medium into another Petri dish.Let the medium solidify (approximately 15 min).In the small Petri dish, cut the agar to delimit a patch that would fit the microscopy chamber (using a thin spatula).Transfer your seedlings to the control and treatment patches using a toothpick or tweezers to gently lift the seedlings by their cotyledons.Transfer the patches with seedlings to the microscopy chamber (so that the seedlings are sandwiched between the agar and the chamber cover glass).Caution: Avoid contact between both media in the chamber to prevent diffusion of IAA into the control medium. Install the chamber on the microscope stage and let the plants recover from the transfer stress for at least 20 min (this minimum as been determined by the stage at which root elongation and fluorescence reach a stable plateau after the mechanical stress induced by the transfer).Note: Waiting longer than 20 min does not harm the assay. During this time, you can set your microscope stage positions on your microscope software.Once recovered, start imaging with a 515 nm excitation.Note: Imaging settings will depend on the microscope setup and will need to be adapted by the user pre-experiment; do not change them between experiments/replicates to be able to compare control and treated plants. We routinely image plants every 10 min for 40 min to quantify root elongation as well.",
    "Microfluidic experiments to observe fast depolarization/hyperpolarization events A video demonstrating these steps is available in Video 2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Preparation of liquid media for microfluidics experiments Prepare an IAA 100 μM solution (see Recipes).Note: Steps are graphically represented in Figure 2 and demonstrated in Video 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4778/bioprotoc-13-14-4778-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of liquid media for microfluidics experiments Filter liquid buffered 1/2 MS media pH 5.8 (see Recipes) using, for example, a 0.45 μm membrane in a siphon filter.Add 0.1 g of sucrose to an empty 15 mL tube.Add 10 mL of the filtered media (from step C2) to the same tube.Vortex and/or shake to fully dissolve the sucrose into the medium.Add 10 μL of DISBAC2(3) (from a 2 mM aliquot in DMSO) to obtain a final concentration of 2 μM.Vortex and/or shake to dissolve.Transfer 5 mL to another 15 mL tube.Critical: Steps C3–C8 ensure that the dye and sucrose are at the exact same concentrations in both tubes. DISBAC2(3) is used for relative measurements and thus every step counts to increase reproducibility.Add 5 μL of buffered 1/2 MS media pH 5.8 in one tube (control tube) and 5 μL of IAA 100 μM in a second tube (treatment tube).Continue with the procedure adapted to your microfluidic setup.If you are using a manually closable microfluidic chip in which you directly transfer 4–5-day-old seedlings, let the seedlings recover for at least 20 min with control media flow after closing the device.Note: During this time, you can set your microscope stage positions on your microscope software.Start imaging with a 515 nm excitation.After at least 5 min, switch the flow in the chip from control media to treatment media.Note: Imaging settings depend on the microscope setup and must be adjusted by the user prior to the experiment.",
    "They must not change between experiments/replicates, to allow comparison between control and treated plants. We routinely image the plants every 30 s to observe rapid responses. For example: 5 min control condition/12 min treatment condition."
