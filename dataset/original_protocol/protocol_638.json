    "1. Cell preparation\n  Harvest freshly sorted or cultured floating cells such as hematopoietic or immune cells.\n• Centrifuge, 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. \n• Remove the supernatant carefully and wash cells with 2% FBS PBS by centrifuge, 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. \n• Remove the supernatant and wash again with PBS by centrifuge, 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. \nAdherent cells such as dendritic cells or cancer cells are cultured on the coverslip in the culture dishes.\n2. Fixation and permeabilization\n  • Fix the cells \\(~2x10<sup>6</sup> cells) with fixation buffer \\(500 μl) for 15 min at RT. \n• Wash the cells twice with PBS \\(1 ml in microcentrifuge tubes volume 1.5 ml) by centrifuge, 1500 rpm for 10 min at RT.\n• Permeabilize the cells with permeabilization buffer \\(500 μl) for 15 min at RT. \n• Wash the cells twice with PBS by centrifuge, 1500 rpm for 10 min at RT. \n• Prepare thin-layers of the fixed cells on the Poly-L-Lysine coated slides by centrifugation using cytospin \\(1~2x10<sup>5</sup> cells/slide, 800 rpm for 10 min at RT). \n• After cytospin centrifugation, draw a circle around the samples by water-proof pen such as Dako Pen.\n3. PLA\n  Day 1\nBlocking\n• Block the slides by blocking solution for 30 min at 37° C in humidity chamber.\n• Tap off the blocking solution carefully from the slides without wash. \nIncubation with primary antibodies\n• Incubate the slides immediately with primary antibodies diluted by the antibody diluent \\(1:50, Table 1 or 2) overnight at 4° C in humidity chamber. \n\\(Cell surface marker staining if needed)",
    "• \\(Incubate the slides with the primary rat anti-mouse antibody to detect cell surface markers \\(e.g. rat anti-mouse CD8a antibody, Abcam ab22378) diluted by the antibody diluent \\(1:50) overnight at 4°C in humidity chamber.)\nDay 2\nIncubation with PLA probes\n• Tap off the primary antibody solution from the slides, and wash the slides twice carefully for 5 min by the wash solution. \n• Incubate the slides with the PLA probes diluted by the antibody diluent \\(Table 1 or 2) for 1 hr at 37° C in humidity chamber. \n• Wash the slides twice carefully for 5 min by the wash solution. \nLigation\n• Add the Ligation-Ligase solution diluted by high purity water and incubate the slides for 30 min at 37° C in humidity chamber. \n• Wash the slides twice carefully for 5 min by the wash solution. \nAmplification\n• Add the Amplification-Polymerase solution diluted by high purity water and incubate the slides for 100 min at 37° C in the dark humidity chamber. \n• Wash the slides twice carefully for 5 min by the wash solution and remove the remained wash solution completely using a pipette. \n\\(Cell surface marker staining if needed)\n• \\(Incubate the slides with the secondary goat anti-rat IgG \\(H+L) antibody Alexa Fluor® 488 \\(ThermoFisher SCIENTIFIC, A-11006) diluted by the antibody diluent \\(1:1000) for 1 hr at RT in the dark humidity chamber.)\n• \\(Wash the slides twice carefully for 5 min by the wash solution and remove the remained wash solution completely using a pipette.)\nNuclear staining and mounting\n• Add the minimal volume of the Duolink In Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI for nucleus staining and mounting, and cover the slides with cover slips. \n• Remove air bubbles from the slide by pushing the cover slips carefully.",
    "• Store the slide at 4° C in the dark before acquiring the images using a confocal microscope. \n• PLA signals are quantified using BlobFinder software \\(Centre for Image Analysis, Uppsala University, http://www.cb.uu.se/~amin/BlobFinder/)."
