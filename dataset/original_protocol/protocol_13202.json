    "All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (No. BUCM-4-2022010101-1097). In this protocol, 24 6-week-old male New Zealand rabbits were housed under a specific condition, namely, 20-25 °C, 50-60% humidity, and a 12 h light/12 h dark circadian cycle, with free access to a regular chow diet. The rabbits were anesthetized and sacrificed by combining deep anesthesia and air embolization.\n1. The KOA rabbit model\nAnesthetize rabbits with 3% pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) intravenously at the ear margin. To confirm the appropriate level of anesthesia, look for a significantly weakened or absent corneal reflex and the absence of pain upon clamping the skin with hemostatic forceps. During anesthesia, add 2-3 drops of lubricant to the rabbits' eyes every 15 min to prevent the rabbits' eyes from drying out.\nAfter anesthesia, fix each rabbit in the supine position, pulling the left hindlimb into a fully extended position.\nFix the left hind limb of each rabbit in the extended position.\n\t\nAs the first layer, use medical tape to cover the rabbit's skin from the groin to the ankle joint.\nAs the second layer, wrap 36 mm-wide, double-sided foam tape over the medical tape and then wrap a polymer bandage from the groin to the ankle joint. Ensure that the knee joint is 180° straight and the ankle joint is dorsiflexed by 60°.\nAs the third layer, immobilize the joints with small splints at the front and back of the knee and ankle joints, and wrap steel mesh around the outermost layer to protect against bites. Expose the rabbits' toes to observe if the blood circulation is normal.\nImmobilize the animals for 6 weeks to establish the KOA model (Figure 1).\n2. Acupotomy intervention\nDetermine the points of treatment.",
    "Shave off the fur of the knee joint of the rabbit's left hind limb.\nPalpate the rabbit knee joint medial femoral muscle tendon insertion, rectus femoral tendon insertion, biceps femoris tendon insertion, and goosefoot bursa. Mark pathological indurations of local muscles with a sterile skin marker. Use medical iodophor to disinfect the knee joint.\nOperation of acupotomy\n\t\nKeep the acupotomy blade parallel to the direction of travel parallel to the tendon and the longitudinal axis of the limb.\nUse the thumb of the left hand to press down on the skin entering the marker point and move laterally so that blood vessels and nerves are separated on the ventral side of the thumb.\nWith the acupotomy handle in the right hand, press down quickly with a small force so that the acupotomy blade instantly passes through the skin. Slowly advance the acupotomy blade to the local muscle indurations and make longitudinal cuts and swings laterally.\nAfter the acupotomy operation is complete, disinfect the knee joint again and apply a band-aid.\nPerform this operation once a week for 4 weeks (Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: If there is no induration or cord-like tissue touched at the tendon insertion of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, or the anserine bursa, the acupotomy needle should be used to release their tendon insertions directly.\n3. Elastic modulus of quadriceps femoris",
    "NOTE: 1) This experiment used the real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound diagnostic instrument to measure the elastic modulus of the quadriceps femoris in vivo in each group of rabbits. 2) The tester should be an experienced sonographer in ultrasound detection. When measuring, the ultrasound probe should be gently placed on the skin surface of the quadriceps to avoid local muscle tension. Measurements need to be taken when the animal is in a quiet state, without struggling or activity. If the animal is active, wait until it is calm before conducting the test.\nShave the fur to expose the skin in the quadriceps region of the left hindlimb.\nUse conventional two-dimensional ultrasound to locate the quadriceps musculo-abdomen and determine the region of interest (ROI), set to a depth of 1-2 cm.\nStart the SWE mode for inspection.\n\t\nSet the area of interest uniformly to a circular area with a diameter of 2 mm and the area of interest to ~0.5-1 cm deep from the surface of the skin.\nUse the ultrasonic diagnostic instrument to generate an acoustic radiation force impulse to stimulate the muscle tissue and obtain tissue elastography.\nWait for 2-3 s for the image to stabilize and then freeze the image. Activate the Q-BOX function of the instrument to measure the Young's modulus of the quadriceps muscle.\nWait for the system to automatically calculate the maximum, minimum, and average values (unit: KPa) of Young's modulus of the ROI. Select three ROIs at the same depth for three measurements and take the average value for statistical analysis.",
    "NOTE: The tester should be an experienced sonographer in ultrasound detection. When measuring, the ultrasound probe should be gently placed on the skin surface of the quadriceps to avoid local muscle tension. Measurements need to be taken when the animal is in a quiet state, without struggling or activity. If the animal is active, wait until it is calm before conducting the test.\n4. Measuring the contraction force of quadriceps femoris\nAnesthetize the rabbits with 3% pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) intravenously at the ear margin. To confirm that the appropriate level of anesthesia has been reached, look for a significantly weakened or absent corneal reflex and the absence of pain upon clamping the skin with hemostatic forceps. During anesthesia, add 2-3 drops of lubricant to the rabbits' eyes every 15 min to prevent the rabbits' eyes from drying out.\nExpose the quadriceps muscles and attach the tension transducer.\n\t\nCut the skin below the patella, along the longitudinal axis of the limb upwards to the base of the thigh, and continue to cut the skin upwards by 3-4 cm. Carefully peel off the skin and fascia, and expose the muscle. Cut the patellar ligament and carefully separate the quadriceps from the iliac junction, keeping the quadriceps in connection with the iliacium.\nLigate the surgical sutures at the tendon junction between the patella and the quadriceps muscle. Stretch the muscle to its full length in its natural state and then attach it to the tension transducer. Keep the ligation line on the muscle in a straight line with the ligation line on the force transducer.\nSecure the tension transducer to the bracket. Connect the signal acquisition line on the tension transducer to the biosignal acquisition system processor.\nMeasure the contractile performance of the quadriceps muscle.",
    "Insert the electrodes parallel to the quadriceps abdomen and avoid any contact between the electrodes.\nPress the oscilloscope button. Adjust the position of the force transducer on the bracket to maintain the baseline at zero. Select the stimulation parameters of the stimulator with a wave width of 5 ms and a delay of 10 ms.\nUse a single stimulus first and gradually adjust the stimulus intensity from zero with an increment of 0.1 V each time. Observe the changes in the muscle contraction curve and contraction amplitude until the maximum single contraction amplitude (Pt) of the quadriceps is determined. Record it for subsequent statistics.\nUse a cluster stimulus, and use the stimulus amplitude that induces the maximum single contraction amplitude as the baseline to continuously stimulate the muscle and gradually increase the stimulus frequency. Observe the changes in the muscle contraction curve until the maximum contraction amplitude (Pt) of the quadriceps is determined. Record it for subsequent statistics.\n\t\t​NOTE: After each muscle contraction, the muscle should be given 30 s to relax with the muscle buffer solution being dripped continuously on the muscle.\n5. The mechanical performance of the quadriceps tendon\nPreprocessing: On the day of testing, measure the length, width, and thickness of the quadriceps tendon with a vernier caliper, and install a special anti-slip clamp in the fatigue testing machine. Repeat loading and unloading 15x for preprocessing.\nStress relaxation test: Use the sensor ranging from 0 N to 100 N, stretch it at a speed of 5 mm/min until it reaches the required length, and then start collecting data. Set the computer data acquisition time from t (0), collecting data every 0.1 s, lasting for 1,800 s. After reaching the set time, record data and curves.",
    "Tensile test: Use the sensor ranging from 0 N to 100 N and stretch it at a speed of 5 mm/min to the maximum load until the specimen is pulled apart. After the test, calculate the maximum displacement, ultimate load, and stiffness of the specimen.\n6. Joint contact surface pressure and pressure per unit area of the cartilage\nFix the femur and tibia specimens on both sides in a straight position on the fixture and perform a preload test. Measure the approximate range of the knee joint, cut the pressure-sensitive paper into the same shape, and seal it with plastic wrap.\nPlace the sealed pressure-sensitive paper between the tibia and femur joints, and conduct a pressure test on the knee joint with a pressure of 5 mm/min and a maximum pressure of 50 N. Maintain the pressure for 2 min until it reaches 50 N when the pressure-sensitive paper is stably colored.\nAfter 2 min, remove the pressure-sensitive paper, fix the colored surface on an A4 size sheet of paper, and acquire images with the scale set aside.\nUpload the image to the computer. Use the referenced software for area measurement and multi-segment measurement for irregular figures. Measure the pressure on the inside and outside of the joints of the femur and tibia and record the results.\n7. Safranin O/Fast Green staining of the knee joint cartilage",
    "After the end of the acupotomy intervention, take the cartilage-subchondral bone complex tissues and embed them in paraffin. Slice the prepared tissue wax blocks and prepare slides. Deparaffinize the prepared tissue slides with environmental dewaxing solution(I) and environmental dewaxing solution (II) for 15 min each; then, dip them successively in xylene and anhydrous ethanol (1:1), anhydrous ethanol (I), 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol, and 75% ethanol, 2-5 min each step; and finally, soak them in distilled water for 15 min.\nPerform staining.\n\t\nStain the slides with Fast Green solution for 1 min. During this process, take the slides out of the solution and observe them under the microscope until the tissue is stained dark green.\nColor separation: Rinse the excess Fast Green solution with ultrapure water. Soak the slides quickly in 1% acetic acid solution for 5 - 10 seconds.  Again, rinse the slide with ultrapure water.\nStain the slides in Safranine O solution for 10-15 min until the cartilage is stained red.\nDehydrate and clarify the tissue, seal the glass slides, and observe them under the microscope.\n\t\nSoak the slides in 75% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol for 3 - 5 seconds successively.\nDip the slides in environmental dewaxing solution(I) and environmental dewaxing solution (II) for 10 min successively. Take out the slides and drop the neutral resinous medium on the front of the slides, avoiding the tissue. Place the edge of the coverglass on the slide and then, slowly put it down to cover the neutral balsam. Remove the air and avoid air bubbles. Wipe off the extra xylene and neutral balsam, and let it stand overnight at room temperature.",
    "Observe the slides under the microscope and acquire images. For each group, select six samples of rabbit knee cartilage and randomly select four different viewing fields for each sample for evaluation. Score the cartilage histology of each group according to the Mankin method (Table 1).\n8. Statistical analysis\nExpress data as mean ± standard deviation (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65584/65584eq01.jpg ± s).\nPerform one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and LSD's test for determining the statistical significance of multiple group comparisons.\nConsider differences statistically significant when P < 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
