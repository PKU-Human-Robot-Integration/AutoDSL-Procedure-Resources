    "Sample preparation: Weigh 10-50 mg of sample (see Figure 1).Plant tissue: Use tweezers and scalpel to cut the sample to approximately 5 × 5 × 1 mm pieces. Smaller and thinner pieces will result in better sample quality.Mycelium: Use scalpel/spatula to scrape mycelium from the surface of Petri plates, or use spatula to collect mycelium from liquid culture.Xylem tissue from mature trees: Place wood sample on cutting board. Use chisel and mallet to harvest pieces of xylem tissue. Cut to 5 × 5 × 1 mm pieces with scalpel and spatula.Note: For mycelium, minimize the amount of agar for higher DNA quality.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200602/20200602120037_5744.jpgFigure 1. Examples of sample sizes for DNA extraction. A. Fresh phloem from 8-week-old Populus trichocarpa trees. Weight 20 mg. B. Fresh phloem from mature P. trichocarpa trees. Weight 15 mg. C. Fresh Leptographium wagnerii mycelium harvested from liquid malt extract cultures. Weight 20 mg. Interval between vertical lines = 1 mm.Homogenize sample and add extraction bufferThree options are available depending on sample type. Complete homogenization is not necessary.Option 1: Mycelium and soft leaf tissuePlace sample in a 1.5 or 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 1 ml extraction buffer.Vortex rigorously for 20 s.Proceed to Procedure C.Option 2: Various plant tissue and mycelium ≥ 50 mg:Grind sample in mortar with pestle and liquid nitrogen.Transfer 10-50 mg of homogenized sample with a spatula or by decanting to a 1.5/2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 1 ml extraction buffer.Vortex rigorously for 20 s.Proceed to Procedure C.Option 3: Various plant tissue and mycelium ≤ 50 mg:Transfer the sample into a 2.0 ml beat beater tube.Add 1 ml extraction buffer.Process for 20 s in a bead beater.Proceed to Procedure C.Note: Use 1 ml of extraction buffer per 50 mg or less tissue. To allow sufficient vortexing, use only 1 ml of buffer per tube.",
    "DNA extractionHeat the wash buffer in a water bath or in a beaker with warm water (approximately 65 °C) to dissolve any precipitants. Temperature is not critical, as long as no precipitants remain. Mix by inversion.Lysis and debris elimination: Incubate the samples in extraction buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. Vortex once during incubation. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 10 min.Eliminate debris: After centrifugation, transfer ca. 0.5 volume of the supernatant into a new tube. Add 1 volume of pre-heated wash buffer, and vortex samples for 20 s. Centrifuge at 21,000 x g for 10 min.Note: Complete debris elimination is not critical when pipetting the supernatant. Precipitate: Transfer ca. 0.7 volume of supernatant into a new tube, add 0.85 volume of isopropanol (room temperature), and mix by inversion for 20 s. Centrifuge at 21,000 x g for 10 min.Note: Minimize transferring any debris while pipetting the supernatant. Wash the pellet: Pour out the supernatant, and remove remaining supernatant by tapping the tubes upside down on a paper towel. Add 200 µl of 70% ethanol, and centrifuge at 21,000 x g for 5 min.Note: Consider local regulations for correct handling of isopropanol waste. Dry the pellet: Pipet out the ethanol. Leave the caps open, and dry pellets in a heat block at 65 °C for 5 min.Note: For faster drying, remove as much of the ethanol as possible. Resuspension: Dissolve the pellet in 20-50 µl of TE buffer or nuclease free water. Vortex to dissolve if needed, and centrifuge briefly to collect any droplets to the bottom of the tube. Store DNA samples at -20 °C or -80 °C until used.",
    "Note: If the DNA pellet is not colorless or white post 70% ethanol wash, add 20-50 µl of TE buffer or nuclease-free water to resuspend the DNA without disturbing the pellet. Gently pipet the liquid a few times in the tube and collect the supernatant as DNA for downstream processes. Keep the pellet until DNA is quantified. Use the DNA for PCR-based detection, or store in freezer until used."
