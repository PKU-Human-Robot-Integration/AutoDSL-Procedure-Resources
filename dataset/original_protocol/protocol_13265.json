    "This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Dermatology Hospital, Southern Medical University (2020081). Informed patient consent was obtained before tissues were collectedfrom the individuals.\n1. Preparation\nNOTE: The following procedures should be performed in a sterile environment under a biological safety cabinet.\nPrepare complete culture medium by adding 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B solution (PSA) to high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM).\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with PSA by adding 1% PSA into 1x PBS. Prepare PBS with FBS by adding 1% FBS to 1x PBS.\nPrepare several sterilized scissors, forceps, and scalpels by autoclaving.\n2. Obtaining removed tissues\nObtain tissues from keloid patients through surgery. Collect the fresh keloid tissues in a sterile packing bag or sterile centrifuge tube, and transfer them to a biological safety cabinet in the laboratory as soon as possible.\n\t​NOTE: In this protocol, the size of the acquired keloid tissue was approximately ~20 x 20 x 10 mm3, and the size may vary depending on the surgery.\n3. Isolation\nTake out the keloid tissue using sterile tweezers, and place it in a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube containing 10-25 mL of PBS with 1% PSA for 10 min. Then, prepare a 6-well plate, and add 4 mL of PBS supplemented with 1% PSA to each well. Take out the tissue using sterilized tweezers, and wash it twice with PBS supplemented with 1% PSA. Using sterile forceps, transfer the tissue sequentially from one well to the next.",
    "Remove the adipose andepidermis layers using surgical scissors or a surgical scalpel, and leave the dermis layer untouched. Trim and dissect the dermis layer into 3-5 mm2 pieces with scissors, transfer these pieces using sterile forceps to the next well, and wash them in PBS with 1% PSA solution again.\n4. Culture\nPlace the dermis tissue pieces in Petri dishes using sterilized forceps; ensure that the number of pieces is between 10 and 30 and the distance between each piece is >5 mm. Put the Petri dishes upside down in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 30-60 min until the pieces of tissues dry a little and stick to the Petri dish. Then, add DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSA, and carefully place the Petri dishes into a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Fibroblasts are a morphologically and functionally heterogeneous cell population. Considering this complexity, the isolation and culture steps should be performed with care; select the keloid dermal tissue pieces evenly, and mix these pieces well before placing them in the Petri dish.\nAfter 3 days, replace half of the supernatant with a complete culture medium. Change the culture medium every 2-3 days. Observe the fibroblasts under a microscope at 40x magnification every day.\n\tNOTE: All the steps should be performed gently. Do not move the Petri dish for 2 days after isolating, as the tissue pieces take time to adhere to the Petri dishes.",
    "When the fibroblasts growing around the tissue pieces reach approximately 90% confluency, remove the tissue pieces and the culture medium. Wash the fibroblasts with sterile 1x PBS, and add 2 mL of sterile 1x trypsin-EDTA solution to the plates.Incubate the cells for approximately ~3-5 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.Gently tap the culture dish, and observe it under a microscope. When the majority of the cells detach from the plate, add 2 mL of complete medium to end the digestion process.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube, and centrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant carefully, and resuspend the cell pellet in complete medium.Seed the fibroblasts into a 9 cm cell culture dish, and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\n5. Maintenance and preservation\nApproximately 3-4 days later, when the fibroblasts have grown to 80% confluency, repeat steps 4.2-4.4, and passage the fibroblasts at a ratio of 1:3. Use the passaged fibroblasts for further experiments.\n\t​NOTE: The fibroblast culture should be stopped after 10 passages, because the cells may start to show changed characteristics compared to the original cells.\nCryopreserve the passaged cells of P1-P3 in liquid nitrogen for further usage.\n\t\nRepeat steps 4.2-4.3. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube, and centrifuge the tube for 3 min at 300 × g. Discard the supernatant carefully, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cell freezing medium containing 90% FBS and 10% DMSO, and transfer the suspension into cell cryotubes.\nMove the cells into a frozen box, and then put the frozen box in a −80 °C freezer. After 1 day, transfer the cells to liquid nitrogen for long-term preservation.",
    "6. Identification of fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining\nPlace round coverslips in a 24-well plate, and culture the passaged fibroblasts at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/well. When the fibroblasts reach 60% confluency, remove the culture medium. Add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the fibroblasts for 20 min at room temperature, and wash 3x with PBS for 1 min each time.\n\tNOTE: Count the number of cells by using a hemocytometer slide under a microscope or an automatic cell counter.\nRemove the PBS, incubate with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min for the permeabilization of cell membranes, and then wash 3x with PBS for 1 min each time. Add PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and soak for 30 min. Then, remove it, and add the PDGFR-α/vimentin antibody diluted in antibody diluent at 1:1,000. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nThe next day, remove the primary antibody, wash the cells 3x with PBS for 3 min, and add the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor-555 goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted with antibody diluent at 1:200 to soak for 1 h.\nRemove the secondary antibody, and wash the cells 3x with PBS. Take out the round coverslips using forceps, put them on glass slides, and add 50 µL of 5 µg/mL 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution to stain the cellular nuclei. Keep the samples in a wet, dark box, and observe them under a laser confocal fluorescence microscope.\n\t​NOTE: Add a negative control group without a primary antibody but with a secondary antibody to exclude nonspecific staining.\n7. Identification of fibroblasts by flow cytometry",
    "Collect the cell pellet into a 1.5 mL sterile centrifuge tube, and resuspend with 50 µL of PBS containing 1% FBS. Incubate with anti-CD90 for 30 min in the dark, and add an anti-IgG isotype control to the control group. Then, add 200 µL of PBS containing 1% FBS, and centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 300 × g at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, and add 200 µL of PBS containing 1% FBS. Resuspend and filter the suspension through a cell strainer (70 mesh). Add a 5 µg/mL stock solution of DAPI at 1:100 to the filtrate, and then acquire the results by flow cytometry. Set the forward scatter (FSC) as the abscissa and the side scatter (SSC) as the ordinate, and circle the main cell population. Select the cell population, and set the phycoerythrin as the abscissa and the count as the ordinate for analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
