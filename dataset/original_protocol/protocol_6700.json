    "Maintenance of hiPSCs culturesPrepare Matrigel-coated 6-well plate by adding 1 ml of coating solution (see recipe Table 4) to each well and leave the plate at room temperature for 1 h before use.Maintain hiPSCs in PeproGrow hESC medium (see recipe Table 5) and change medium every other day.Passage undifferentiated hiPSCs every 4-5 days.Aspirate old medium and add 2 ml fresh PeproGrow hESC medium to each well.Scrape undifferentiated hiPSC colonies into small pieces using 200 μl pipet tips under a stereomicroscope within an AirClean PCR Workstation. Depending on the size, a hiPSC colony can be broken up into 15-40 pieces.Aspirate the Matrigel coating solution from the freshly prepared plates and transfer the lifted hiPSC fragments to new Matrigel-coated plates.Mesoderm differentiation of hiPSC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) (Stage 1)Examine hiPSC cultures and ensure hiPSCs are undifferentiated. Lift and remove the differentiated hiPSCs, if any, using a 200 μl pipet tip under a microscope in the PCR Workstation.Prewarm an aliquot of Accutase solution in 37 °C water bath for 10 min.Aspirate hiPSC culture medium. Wash hiPSCs with pre-warmed PBS (2 ml per well) twice. Add 1 ml of Accutase solution to each well and incubate culture plates in 37 °C incubator for 10 min.Add 2 ml of DMEM/F12 medium to each well. Pipette the cell suspension with 10 ml pipette gently up and down to dislodge the hiPSCs. Transfer the contents to 50 mL conical tubes.Centrifuge the cells at 340 x g for 7 min at 4 °C. Resuspend cells in EB basal medium-1 (see recipe Table 6). Filter the cells using a 70 μm strainer. Count cells.Plate 15,000 cells to each well in 150 μl EB mesoderm differentiation medium-1 (see recipe Table 6) on a Nunclon Sphera 96-well plate.",
    "Keep the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 5% O2 incubator for 2 days. Each well forms one EB.Change half medium by pipetting out 75 μl of EB mesoderm differentiation medium-1 and adding 75 μl of EB mesoderm differentiation medium-2 (see recipe Table 7).Keep the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 5% O2 incubator for 2 more days.Analyze mesoderm differentiation by examining the expression levels of mesoderm marker genes in EBs cultured for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days by qPCR (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3854/bioprotoc-10-24-3854-g001.jpgFigure 1. Expression levels of mesoderm marker genes hCDX2, hCD34, hSCL, hT, hHand, in EBs cultured for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (d1, d2, d3 and d4).  * P < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA compared to day 1 samples. Data was relative quantification and presented as mean ± SEM.Expansion of myelomonocytic population released from EBs (Stage 2)Prepare gelatin-coated plate by adding 1 ml of 0.1% gelatin solution to each well of a 6-well plate and leave at room temperature for 1 h before use.Collect EBs from Nunclon Sphera 96-well plate by suctioning out the medium with EBs using a 1 ml pipet tip and transfer these EBs to a 50 ml conical tube.Let EBs sink down by gravity for 3-5 min.Aspirate medium with a glass Pasteur pipette carefully without removing EBs in the bottom.Resuspend EBs in myelomonocytic expansion medium (see recipe Table 8) according to numbers of EBs. Seed 40-50 EBs in one well of 6-well plate with 4 ml of myelomonocytic expansion medium. For example: EBs collected from a full 96-well plate can be resuspended in 8 ml medium and plated in 2 wells of a gelatin-coated 6-well plate.Keep the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 5% O2 incubator.EBs attach to the plates.",
    "Some cells are released from EBs. The floating non-adherent cells are the myelomonocytic population.Change expansion medium after 4 days with the same medium but increase hMCSF concentration from 50 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml.Continue culture for another 13 days (medium changes at days 4, 8, 12, and 16).Floating cells released from EBs at days 10, 13, 17, 21 are collected and stained with primary antibodies against CD14 (1:20), CD43 (1:50), and CD45 (1:50) in FACS buffer (see recipe Table 9) for 30 min on ice. Protect from light. Table 2 shows FACS analysis data.Table 2.

Data collected from 3 hiPSC lines. Each line had 3-4 technical repeats.Promotion of osteoclast maturation (Stage 3)Collect floating cells (17 days of Stage 2) to a 15 ml or 50 ml conical tube. Typically, 0.2-0.45 million cells can be expected from EBs grown on one well of a gelatin-coated 6-well plate.Centrifuge the cells at 340 x g for 7 min at 4 °C. Count cells.Plate cells at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and on bone chips.Culture osteoclast progenitors in osteoclast differentiation medium (see recipe Table 10). Change medium every 2-3 days.Multinucleated mature osteoclasts form in 7-10 days in osteoclast differentiation medium (Figure 2A).Fix hiPSC-OCs at day 10-12 for TRAP staining (Figures 2B-2C).Remove culture medium. Wash gently with PBS once.Fix cells in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (150 μl per well) at room temperature for 10 min.Prepare TRAP staining solution (see recipe Table 11).Add 100 μl of TRAP solution in each well of 96-well plate.Incubate culture plate at 37 °C for 45 min to 1 h.Remove the TRAP solution. Rinse plates with distilled water.",
    "Dry the plate before taking images.Fix TRAP stained cells on bone chips at day 14. Take images of resorption pits with TM1000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (Figure 2D).Confirm differentiation status of osteoclasts by examining expression levels of osteoclast marker genes by qPCR (Table 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3854/bioprotoc-10-24-3854-g002.jpgFigure 2. hiPSC-OC cultures.
