    "Viral nucleic acids are extracted from the specimen manually. The manual method is useful if few samples are analyzed. Specimens are lysed in lysis buffer and applied to spin columns containing a silica membrane. Viral nucleic acids bind the membrane, are washed to remove contaminants, and then eluted in buffer. This process takes about 45 min to extract 6-8 samples. At the end of the extraction process, isolated viral nucleic acid is ready for the multiplexed RT-qPCR reaction.\nMaterials\nQiaAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 52904)\nSpecimen:\n               \nNasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs are collected by trained personnel using standard operating procedures:\nNP/OP swabs (Puritan Rayon tipped applicators 25-800 R 50; Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 22-029-502) collected in viral transport medium (M4RT; Thermofisher, cat. no.

    "This protocol detects the S and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the cellular RNaseP gene in a multiplex one-step RT-qPCR reaction with primers and probes that bind the S and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. The S and E gene probes are labeled with HEX and FAM fluorochromes, respectively, and as such amplification of each target can be visualized separately. In addition, the reaction also contains primers and probe to amplify the RNaseP gene/mRNA. The RNaseP probe is labeled with Cy5. Amplification of the RNaseP gene indicates good sample quality, adequate nucleic acid extraction, and absence of PCR inhibitors in the sample, thus ruling out false negative results. If done properly, every specimen should show an amplification curve for RNaseP. Specimens that contain SARS-CoV-2 show PCR amplification curves for both S and E genes (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.145#cpz1145-fig-0002]). In an occasional positive specimen, only the S or the E amplification curve is present. This can occur if the viral load in the specimen is low (Ct value > 32) or if there are mutations in the primer/probe binding regions of one or the other gene. For example, if there are mutations or deletions in the primer/probe-binding regions of the S gene, then only the E gene will amplify, indicating the presence of a variant in the specimen.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/461a5df6-cc0d-49c3-b9bb-7dbc30b9b7ef/cpz1145-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nRT-qPCR amplification curves A, B, C: Y axis is log scale; D, E, F: Y axis is linear scale.

Probes must be purified by HPLC. The dual-labeled probes are labeled with a fluorochrome on the 5′ end and a quencher on the 3′ end. During the annealing/extension step of PCR, the probe binds the antisense strand of DNA. As the forward primer is extended, the probe is hydrolyzed by the 5′ exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase, separating the fluorochrome from the quencher. The emission from the fluorochrome is then captured by the detector.\nProbes must be protected from light by covering the tube with aluminum foil when kept outside the freezer.\nTable 1.\n                Primers and Probes\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0_level_0,Unnamed: 1_level_0,Sequence identity,Sequence identity,Sequence identity,Unnamed: 5_level_0\nPrimer/probe,\"Sequence, 5′>3′\",SARS-CoV-2,SARS-CoV,MERS,Amplicon\nSgene-F2,AACTCAATTACCCCCTGCATAC,22/22,14/22,0/22 22/22 deleted,167 bp\nSgene-R2,TAGTACCATTGGTCCCAGAGACA,23/23,2/23 18/23 deleted,15/23,\nSgeneProbe2 (HEX),HEX TCAGATCCTCAGTTTTACATTCAACTCAGGACTTG BHQ1,35/35,21/35,10/35,\nEgene-F2,TCATTCGTTTCGGAAGAGACAG,22/22,21/22,11/22,103 bp\nEgene-R2,GCGCAGTAAGGATGGCTAGT,20/20,20/20,12/20,\nEgeneProbe2 (FAM),FAM AGCGTACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGTATTCT BHQ1,34/34,34/34,10/34,\nRNaseP-F,AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG,,,,65 bp\nRNaseP-R,GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT,,,,\nRNaseP probe (Cy5),Cy5 TTCTGACCTGAAGGCTCTGCGCG BHQ1,,,,\naThe S and E gene primers and probe were designed using Oligo v6.64 software using the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, NC_045512.2.

    "The alternate protocol is exactly the same as Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.145#cpz1145-prot-0004], except that the S and E gene probes are labeled with the same fluorochrome, FAM.

The advantage over the Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.145#cpz1145-prot-0004] is that the signal is additive and more robust. The internal control RNaseP signal can still be differentiated because the probe is labeled with Cy5. This alternate protocol is useful if there is no need to differentiate between amplification of the S and E genes.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.145#cpz1145-prot-0004])\nAlternate SgeneProbe2 labeled with FAM,\nSgeneProbe2 (FAM): FAM TCAGATCCTCAGTTTTACATTCAACTCAGGACTTG BHQ1\nIn Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.145#cpz1145-prot-0004], under “Setting up the one step RT-qPCR program and run file and on the real-time PCR machine,” at step 10, select FAM/Cy5 detectors for each well.
