    "1. Preparation of Nematode Growth Medium (NGM)\nFor 1 L of media, combine 20 g agar, 2.5 g organic nitrogen source (e.g., bacto-peptone), and 3 g sodium chloride in a 2 L flask. Add 975 mL of sterile water.\nAdd in a sterile stir bar. If using an automatic media pourer, autoclave tubing and media for 15 min; media should be autoclaved for longer if a higher volume is made.\nSet media on stir plate, and allow to cool.\nOnce media is warm to touch (approximately 60 °C) aseptically add 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4● H2O, 1 mL of 1M CaCl2, 25 mL of KPO4, and 1 mL of 0.5% cholesterol in ethanol.\nPour media (by hand, or by automatic pump) under laminar flow into 35 mm x 10 mm sterile petri dishes. Allow to dry under hood for 1-2 days before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Plates should be stored at 4 °C to prevent contamination.\n2. Making a Worm Pick\nCut a 1.5 cm piece of aluminum wire. Carefully insert approximately 0.5 cm of this length into the tip of a Pasteur pipette.\nUsing a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp, melt the glass pipette tip by slowly rotating it in the flame until the wire is securely adhered to the pipette, without compromising the original shape of the pipette tip.\n3. Preparation of E. coli Culture\nUsing a sterile loop, inoculate single colony of E. coli strain OP50 in 200 mL of Luria Broth. Incubate overnight with shaking at 37 °C.\nThe liquid culture is ready for use the following day and may be stored at 4 °C when not in use.",
    "NOTE: The E. coli strain, OP50, is used as a food source for C. elegans. This culture may be used for up to several months when stored at 4 °C.\n4. Essential C. elegans Maintenance\nSeed prepared NGM agar plates with E. coli by spotting approximately 50 - 100 µL of prepared OP50 liquid culture onto the center of the plate.\nCover plates and allow them to dry at room temperature for 24 h. Once dry, place plates at 37 °C overnight for rapid growth or keep at room temperature, if slower growth is desired.\nAdd worms to the plate by either \"chunking,\" (see protocol step 5 \"Chunking and Picking Worms\"), picking worms individually, or placing worm eggs directly onto the plate (see protocol step 6 \"Egg Preparation\").\n5. Chunking and Picking Worms\nNOTE: \"Chunking,\" refers to a practice that is common in C. elegans maintenance. This involves cutting a section of the NGM agar plate that contains worms, and transferring this piece onto a new plate, thus also transferring a large number of worms in the process. Contamination may also be cut out of the plate in this manner. When picking worms, it is important to maintain the integrity of the agar because worms can be lost in holes in the agar. In addition, it is important to allow the pick to cool before touching the plate to prevent melting the agar or burning the worms.\nIn order to quickly transfer large amounts of worms onto new plates, cut a piece of NGM agar containing the selected worms using a spatula.Remove the cut piece and place it face down on the edge of the lawn of OP50 on a new plate.",
    "Transfer worms individually as described below in protocol step 8.2, \"Survival Assay,\" using a worm pick. Flame the wire in the worm pick until it is red. Remove it from the flame and allow it to cool for a few seconds.\nUsing the wire on the pick, gently scrape the lawn of the OP50 culture grown on the new plate, covering the wire on the pick.\nThe viscous culture covering the tip of the wire makes worms stick to the tip of the pick, thus gently pick up selected worms using a swiping motion.\nOnce selected worms are gathered, place them onto a new plate by gently swiping culture across the agar. Place the wire into the flame to remove remaining culture on the pick.\n6. Egg Preparation\nPlace approximately 20 adult animals (approximately 2 - 3 days after hatching when grown at 20 °C) by either picking or chunking as described in protocol step 5, \"Chunking and Picking Worms,\" onto a plate seeded with 50 µL of E. coli strain, OP50.\nTo collect the eggs, flood the plate with 10 mL of M9 buffer after 1-2 days. Using a glass serological pipette, swirl and gently agitate the contents on the agar plate to release eggs stuck to OP50 or adult animals. Collect all the liquid containing the eggs and adults.\nTransfer M9 and OP50 solution into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge 15 mL conical tube at 2,100 x g for 2 min.\nAspirate approximately 9 mL of supernatant without disturbing the OP50 pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of sterile water, 1 mL of bleach, and 1 mL of 0.25 M NaOH.",
    "Mix gently by inversion until the majority (approximately 70 percent) of adult animals appear lysed; typically, eggs remain intact during this short bleach treatment because of their shell. Centrifuge the conical tube at 990 x g for 2 min.\nAspirate supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Re-suspend the pellet in 10 mL of M9 buffer.\nCentrifuge the conical tube in 990 x g for 2 min. Aspirate supernatant without disturbing pellet. Re-suspend pellet with 200 µL of M9 buffer.\n\tNOTE: Egg preparation may require multiple trials. Eggs may be destroyed if they are exposed to bleach for too long. If eggs do not hatch, either decrease the concentration of bleach in solution or decrease the duration of exposure to bleach.\n7. Infection Plate Set-up\nDispense 3-5 mL of YPD into a sterile test tube and inoculate it with a single colony of Candida albicans using a sterile loop.\nPlace the tube on a rotatory drum for approximately 16-18 h at 30 °C.\nLabel one 1.5 mL microfuge tube to contain C. albicans, and another to contain OP50. Record the weight of each empty tube.\nPlace 500 µL of the overnight C. albicans culture into tube labeled C. albicans and 1,500 µL of the overnight OP50 culture (from step 3.1) into the tube labeled OP50.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 16,100 x g. Aspirate supernatant without disturbing pellet.\nRe-suspend each pellet with 500 µL of sterile water. Centrifuge for 5 min at 16,100 x g.\nAspirate supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Record the final weight of microfuge tubes.\nDetermine the weight of each pellet by subtracting the initial weight of the microfuge tubes from the final weight.",
    "Using sterile water, re-suspend the C. albicans pellet to 10 mg/mL, and the OP50 pellet to 200 mg/mL. Make a master infection mix by combining 10 µL of a 50 mg/mL solution of Streptomycin, 2.5 µL of OP50 culture, 0.5 µL of C. albicans culture, and 7 µL of sterile water.\nFor control plates, create a master mix by replacing the volume of C. albicans culture with sterile water. Seed 20 µL of infection mix or OP50 control solution onto the center of NGM plates using a micropipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Approximately 100 worms are needed to determine statistical significance during analysis. This assay is typically run in triplicate. Thus, a 3.2x infection mix as well as a 3.2x control solution is made. These mixes are made to be slightly over 3x the original to ensure that a full 20 µL is seeded onto each plate, allowing room for error. This master mix is created because the pharynx of the worm is too small during the initial larval stages (L1-L3) to consume C. albicans. For exposure to pharmacological agents such as fluconazole (Figure 3B), the agent is introduced to the infection mixture. The concentration of the agent is empirically determined. For example, in Figure 3B, 50 µM Fluconazole is represented, however 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 µM Fluconazole were also tested using the same protocol.\n8. Analysis of the Deformed Anal Region (Dar) Phenotype and Survival Assay\nVisualize the Dar phenotype\n\tNOTE: Dar is best visualized at the L3 stage and beyond. Dar presents as a small protrusion in the post anal region of the worm (Figure 2A), which becomes more prominent over time.",
    "Confirm if an animal has Dar by quickly tapping the plate on the stage of the dissection microscope; animals without Dar will move backwards immediately, while animals with Dar will either need repeated rounds of tapping to reverse their direction, or they will not do so at all.\nSurvival assay\nComplete egg preparation as previously described in protocol step 6, \"Egg Preparation\". Count the eggs under the dissection scope, and dilute the egg solution with M9 until a concentration of approximately 5-6 healthy eggs per µL is achieved. Using a pipette, dispense 20 µL sample containing approximately 30 eggs onto prepared NGM plate, in the area between the bacterial culture and the side of plate (eggs and worm food, OP50, are in two distinct spots).\nIncubate plates at 20 °C for 48 h. Under a dissection microscope, count the number of live and dead adult worms on each plate, as well as the number of worms with Dar. Record the percent with Dar.\nConsider an animal dead if it does not respond to being tapped on the head by an aluminum wire or tapping on the plate.\nEvery other day, transfer remaining adult worms by picking as described in protocol step 5, \"Chunking and Picking Worms,\" onto a new infection or control plate. At this point, if needed, perform a survival assay by tracking the number of live, dead, and missing worms each day.",
    "NOTE: This assay may run for two weeks, beginning with egg preparation. In addition, the egg solution should not be dispensed onto the bacterial culture, as the solution may contain traces of bleach which can kill the OP50. The solution should also be dispensed approximately 0.5 cm away from the edge of the plate, as eggs can become stuck in between the sides of the plate and the agar. Additionally, due to the rapid proliferation of worms, transferring adults onto new plates is critical to separate them from their progeny.\nAnalyze Survival\nAnalyze results using survival curve analysis software (refer to list of materials).\nCompare survival curves using the Grehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon method (assuming that the data from early survival times are more accurate than later times, weight the data accordingly) as well as Logrank statistical tools45.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, in Figure 4B-C, the survival of worms treated with mutant C. albicans is compared to those treated with isogenic wild-type controls or complementarystrains.\nSubscription Required.
