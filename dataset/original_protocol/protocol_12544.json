FISH on isolated individual ovarian cortex cells\nDissociation of ovarian cortex tissue to obtain individual cells\n\t\nCut the cryopreserved/thawed ovarian cortex tissue into small pieces of approximately 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm using a scalpel.\nEnzymatically digest the tissue fragments in 4 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) L15 medium containing 0.1 mg/mL tissue dissociation enzyme mix, 10 µg/mL DNase I, and 1 mg/mL collagenase I from C. histolyticum for a maximum of 75 min at 37 °C. Pipet the digestion mix up and down every 15 min.\nStop the enzymatic digestion by adding 4 mL of cold L15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Wash the dissociated tissue once with 8 mL of cold L15 medium by centrifugation at 500 x g and resuspend in 500 µL of L15 medium without vortexing to avoid damage to the cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension containing largely individual stromal cells and small follicles (oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells) to a plastic Petri dish and examine the cell suspension under a stereomicroscope (100x magnification).",
    "Pick up the small follicles (<50 µm) manually by using a 75 µm plastic pipette and transfer the follicles to a droplet of L15 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 4 °C to prevent the aggregation of follicles. Perform follicle pick-up for a maximum of 30 min. To improve follicular cell spreading prior to FISH analysis, transfer the purified follicles to a solution of 0.06% trypsin, 1 mg/mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1 mg/mL glucose and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nObtain ovarian stromal cells from the cortex cell suspension using a 75 µm plastic pipette, taking special care to avoid contamination with small follicles.\nFISH analysis of individual ovarian cell\n\t\nTransfer the treated ovarian follicles (recommended n = 5-20) with trypsin/EDTA/glucose or stromal cells (n > 1,000) to droplets of 5 µL of 0.15 mM KCl/15 µL of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) on a slide and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nDry and pre-fixate the slides in 300 µL of 0.05 mM KCl/7.5% acetic acid/22.5% methanol for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Cover the slides with methanol/acetic acid (3:1) for 2 min at RT to finalize fixation.\nMake 20x standard sodium citrate (SSC) by adding 876 g of sodium chloride and 441 g of tri-sodium citrate dihydrate in 5 L of distilled water. Next, add 100 mL of the 20x SSC to 900 mL of demineralized (demi) water to obtain 2x SSC. Wash the sample in 2x SSC at 73 °C, cover it with 100 µL of 2% proteinase K, and seal it with a coverslip. Incubate the slides for 10 min at 37 °C in the hybridization station.",
    "Remove the coverslip and wash the slides for 5 min in DPBS at RT. Fixate the sample for 5 min with 1% formaldehyde at RT. At this stage, the material is not yet fully attached to the glass slides and should therefore not be placed on a shaking platform.\nWash the slides for 5 min in DPBS at RT, followed by dehydration in subsequent 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 2 min each. Air-dry the dehydrated sample and hybridize it with fluorescently labeled probes.\nSelect a centromere-specific probe for chromosome X and another chromosome-specific centromeric probe as a control to determine the X chromosomal content of ovarian cells. In this case, centromere-specific probes for chromosome X (CEP X [DXZ1]) directly labeled with fluorochrome SpectrumGreen and chromosome 18 (CEP 18 [D18Z1]) directly labeled with fluorochrome SpectrumOrange are used.\nAdd 1 µL of CEP X, 1 µL of CEP 18, and 18 µL of the hybridization buffer to the sample and seal with a coverslip that is glued to the slides to prevent evaporation of the probe during hybridization. Transfer the slides to the hybridization station for denaturation at 73 °C for 3 min, followed by hybridization during an overnight incubation at 37 °C.\nRemove the coverslip and any remaining glue from the slide after hybridization. Wash the slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% Tween-20 at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by incubation for 1 min in 2x SSC/0.1% Tween-20 at RT.\nDehydrate the slides by subsequent 2 min incubations in 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol and air-dry in the dark. Cover the slides with a mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Keep at -20 °C for at least 10 min before analysis by fluorescence microscopy.\nImaging",
    "Examine the signal(s) for the X chromosome with a fluorescence microscope linked to an image processing software.\n\t\t\nFirst, select fluorochrome DAPI.\n\t\t\t\nAcquire an image by selecting New Cell > Live > Capture at 630x magnification. A new window with the threshold will appear. Set the blue bar of the threshold to 0 to minimize background and the red bar to maximum (255) to make the signals brighter. Click on Accept.\nA new window with enhancement will appear with a suggestion for darker/brighter (12), radius (3), and depth (1). Use the suggested values or adjust them if not satisfied.\nSecondly, select fluorochrome SpectrumOrange and click on Capture.\n\t\t\t\nSet the blue bar of the threshold to 0 to minimize background and the red bar to maximum (255) to make the signals brighter. Click on Accept.\nThe window with enhancement will appear with a suggestion for darker/brighter (-11), radius (2.7), and depth (0.6). Use the suggested values or adjust them if not satisfied.\nFinally, select fluorochrome SpectrumGreen and click on Capture.\n\t\t\t\nSet the blue bar of the threshold to 0 to minimize background and the red bar to maximum (255) to make the signals brighter. Click on Accept.\nThe window with enhancement will appear with a suggestion for darker/brighter (0), radius (3), and depth (0). Use the suggested values or adjust it if not satisfied. Save the image in a newly created file.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Somatic cells were only evaluated when two signals of the control chromosome 18 were visible. In most oocytes, only one signal could be detected for each chromosome.\nStore the slides in the dark at 4 °C after analysis to prevent loss of signals.\n2. FISH on paraffin sections of grafted ovarian cortex tissue",
    "NOTE: One fragment of cryopreserved/thawed ovarian cortex tissue of 18 females with TS was xenografted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice for 5 months. The procedure of xenografting has been described previously and was conducted at the Université Catholique de Louvain (Brussels, Belgium) following the local guidelines of the Committee on Animal Research regarding animal welfare (reference 2014/UCL/MD/007)18,19.\nSelecting sections of xenografted ovarian cortex tissue containing follicles\n\t\nFixate xenografted ovarian cortex tissue in 4% formaldehyde and embed the tissue in paraffin. Trim the blocks with a scalpel to remove extra paraffin and cut the paraffin block to 4 µm thickness on a rotation microtome.\nSelect every seventh section of the paraffin ribbon for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining to determine which sections contain follicles. Put the section in a water bath at 40-45 °C and mount them on immunohistochemistry microscope slides.\nDeparaffinization and HE staining\n\t\nPut the slides on a stove for 10 min at 60 °C, and thereafter immerse the slides in 100% xylene for 5 min. It is not necessary to place the slides directly on the stove. Hydrate the sections for 15 s in 100% ethanol, followed by 2 x 15 s in 96% ethanol. Rinse the slides in tap water for 2 min.\nStain the slides in hematoxylin for 10 min and thereafter rinse the slides briefly in tap water. Briefly immerse the slides in a bicarbonate solution (100 g of magnesium sulfate and 10 g of sodium bicarbonate in 5 L of distilled water). Rinse the slides in tap water for 5 min.",
    "Counterstain the slides with eosin for 4 min and dehydrate the slides three times with 100% ethanol, followed by xylene. Coverslip the HE stains on the slides and evaluate the HE sections under a light microscope to select the sections with follicles (100x magnification).\nPre-treatment and hybridization of paraffin sections for DNA FISH\n\t\nSelect new sections that lay before or after the section that contained follicles from the paraffin ribbon. Mount one section on a glass slide. Dry the paraffin sections for at least 45 min on a stove at 56 °C. It is not necessary to place the slides directly on the stove.\nDeparaffinize the sections in xylene for 10 min. Immerse the slides in 99.5% ethanol and rinse them for 5 min in tap water. Pre-treat the slides with target retrieval solution (low pH) for 10 min at 96 °C. After cooling down, rinse the slides in distilled water.\nTreat the slides for 5 min with 0.01 M hydrochloric acid, followed by pepsin digestion (200 U/mL) for 15 min at 37 °C. Rinse the slides again in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and subsequently in PBS.\nFixate the slides in 1% formaldehyde/PBS for 5 min. Rinse the slides briefly in PBS, and then again in demi water. Dehydrate the slides in 99.5% ethanol and let them air-dry.\nSelect a centromere-specific probe for chromosome X and another chromosome-specific centromeric probe as a control to determine the X chromosomal content of granulosa cells. Here, chromosome 18 is used as a control.",
    "Apply 5 µL of probe CEP 18 (D18Z1) directly labeled with fluorochrome SpectrumGreen and probe CEP X (DXZ1) directly labeled with fluorochrome SpectrumRed on the pre-treated slides. Apply a coverslip and seal the area with photo glue. Place the slides in a hybridizer for denaturation at 80 °C for 10 min and hybridization overnight at 37 °C.\nThe next day, rinse the slides for 5 min in 2x SSC at 42 °C, followed by a 2 min and a 1 min rinse in 0.3% Nonidet P40 at 73 °C. Refresh the 2x SSC and rinse the slides again for 5 min at room temperature. Cover the cuvette so that the sections are kept in the dark.\nRinse the slides briefly in distilled water. Dehydrate the slides in 99.5% ethanol and let them air-dry again. Finally, mount the slides with a solution containing DAPI and mounting medium.\nImaging\n\t\nAnalyze the results under a fluorescence microscope at 630x magnification. Open the image processing software on the computer. Select FISH as the profile.\nCheck if the DAPI emission is set at 431 nm and the excitation at 359 nm, Texas red emission at 613 nm and excitation at 595 nm, and FITC emission at 519 nm and excitation at 495 nm.\nAcquire an image by selecting Live > Capture Single Image. Optimize the image quality by adjusting the exposure and gain by moving the Exposure Slider and Gain Slider in the Image menu on the left (e.g., exposure: 212 ms, and gain: 7.9). The required exposure and gain can vary per image; observe the changes during this process to obtain an optimized image. Save the image in a newly created file.\nStore the slides in the dark at 4 °C after analysis to prevent loss of signals.",
