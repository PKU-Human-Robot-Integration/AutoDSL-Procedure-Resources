    "All studies were conducted with permission from the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (2013-15-2934-00833) and the local ethical committee, in accordance with the guidelines of Danish legislation governing animal experimentation (1987) and the National Institutes of Health (publication number 85-23).\n1. Experimental Animals\nObtain male Wistar rats (250 g) and house 2 per cage, with ad libitum access to standard chow and water, and maintain in­­­ a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. Our animals facilities uses non-treated water and Alrtromin rodent chow (1319 FORTI, Brogaarden, Lynge, Denmark). \n\tNote: Allow animals at least one week of acclimatization.\n2. Preoperative Preparations\nMake perfusion buffer: Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA (fraction V), 5% dextran T-70, 3.5 mmol/L glucose, and 5 mmol/L pyruvate, fumarate, and glutamate (if needed); pH 7.4.\nPrepare an adequate amount of perfusion buffer by filtering it through an appropriate size of filter and adjust pH to ~7.5 by dropwise addition of 5 M HCl.\nAdd 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (if needed) directly to the buffer on the day of the study to a final concentration of 10 µM.\nNOTE: IBMX is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases [cAMP]i and thereby restores the sensitivity and responsiveness of the gut in terms of secreting hormones to a secretory stimulus.\nPrepare test solution(s). Prepare vascular stimuli at a 20x higher concentration than the desired final concentration in filtered and pH-adjusted perfusion buffer. Prepare luminal test stimuli in isotonic saline in the final concentration.\nDissolve not readily soluble compounds in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dilute further in perfusion buffer or isotonic saline. For vascular stimuli, keep the final DMSO concentration at 1% or below, as concentrations above this damage the intestine and may lead to unspecific gut hormone secretion. Measure pH and adjust to ~7.5 if needed.\n3. Operation and Perfusion",
    "NOTE: An illustration of a perfusion setup is provided in Figure 1.\nAnesthetize the rats by use of an anesthetic regimen that can sustain surgical anesthesia and analgesia for 30-40 min by Hypnorm/Midazolam (0.3 ml/100 g body weight, per ml: Hypnorm: 0.08 mg fentanyl, 2.5 mg fluanisone, 0.45 mg Methyl Parahydroxybenzoate,  0.05 mg Propyl Parahydroxybenzoate, Midazolam: 1.25 mg, Matrix Pharmaceuticals, Hellerup, Denmark) \nCheck for lack of reflexes (toe pinch), place the rat on the heated operating table and perform an incision of the skin to expose the intestine.\nExpose the terminal part of the colon by moving the small intestine aside as much as possible. Tie of supplying vasculature to the colon and excise it gradually starting from the terminal part of the colon, moving towards the small intestine.\nIf only a certain part of the small intestine is required for perfusion (the upper half), excise non-required segments after tying off supplying vasculature. To minimize tissue damage, moisturize the intestine with isotonic saline and use swabs to remove connective tissue.\nInsert a plastic tube (length: ~15 cm, outer diameter: ~0.4 cm) into the intestinal lumen (in the proximal part) and tie it properly using sutures. Flush carefully with isotonic saline (room temperature) to empty the lumen of chyme.\nPerfuse the lumen with the isotonic saline at a flow of 0.25 mL/min, using a 10 mL syringe connected to a syringe pump.\nMove the intestine aside so the upper mesenteric artery is accessible and remove connective and fat tissue to expose the artery.",
    "Place two sutures under the mesenteric artery by using fine point forceps; one of the sutures is for lifting the artery to control bleeding once the artery has been cut and the other is for securing the catheter that is to be placed in the artery. Take caution not to perforate the artery.\nPlace two sutures under the portal vein for securing the metal catheter that is going to be placed in the vein for collection of perfusion effluent.\nBefore cutting the hole in the mesenteric artery, ensure that the catheter that is going to inserted into the artery is filled with perfusion buffer to prevent air embolus formation.\nCut a small hole in the mesenteric artery using a pair of surgical scissors and insert the plastic catheter immediately after.\nImmediately after the catheter has been secured, initiate perfusion of the gut by starting the roller pump (flow rate = 7.5 mL/min).\nConfirm that the blood vessels in the gut turn pale within few seconds, and the portal vein turns pale.\nImmediately after proper perfusion has been established, cut a hole in the portal vein, insert the metal catheter and secure it with the suture.\nNOTE: The catheter can be difficult to place but lifting the vein up by cautiously pulling the most proximal suture helps.\nOnce the catheters are in place and perfusion output is satisfactory, kill the rat by diaphragm perforation, being careful not to rip out the catheters.\nCollect perfusion output for 1 min and measure the volume. Start the perfusion pressure acquisition/recordings by click Execute Experiment in the pressure recording program.\nCover the gut with moistened tissue to prevent it from drying out during the experiment.",
    "Ensure that the distal end of the intestine is not blocked so that the luminal effluent can exit, otherwise the intestine will swell, edema will develop, perfusion pressure will increase, and perfusion output will drop.\nLeave the preparation for approximately 30 min before initiating the experiment.\nNOTE: The secretory outputs of gut hormones are very unsteady for the first 15 min of perfusion, so this equilibration step is needed to get a steady baseline.\n4. Experiment\nAfter approximately 30 min of perfusion, start the experiment by collecting the first baseline sample using a fraction collector. Collect samples at the desired time interval (e.g., every min, 6.5-7.5 mL is usually collected) and place them on ice within few min.\nInspect the bubble trap regularly and, if emptied, refill it with perfusion buffer.\nCollect the buffer through the three-way cock-valve immediately before it enters the organ and from the catheter inserted in the portal vein (after it has been perfused through the organ) to confirm that the organ is metabolically active. Collect samples at the start and end of experiment to assess viability throughout the experiment.\nMeasure samples quickly, with an automated blood-gas analyzer, as most plastic contains/syringes are not completely airtight, giving rise to exchange with the atmospheric air.\nAfter 10-15 min of baseline collection, stimulate with the first test substance. Administer intra-arterial stimulations with a syringe pump through a three-way stopcock (flow = 0.350 mL/min).\nPerform luminal stimulations by an initial bolus injection (2.5 mL/min over the first 5 min), to replace the isotonic saline that is already in the lumen, followed by administration of the test solution a lower flow rate (0.5 mL/min).",
    "To ensure that the lumen is quickly emptied of test substance once the luminal stimulation period is over, flush the intestinal lumen with isotonic saline by applying same flow rates as above.\nCollect baseline samples for 15-30 min before the next test substance is administered. Depending on the protocol, 2-3 test stimuli can usually be included per experiment. If the experimental protocol includes activation/inhibition of a given molecular site simultaneously with administration of a given secretagogue, always pre-stimulate with the activator/inhibitor 10-15 min before the administration of the secretagogue to ensure that the molecular site is inhibited at the very beginning of secretagogue infusion.\nAt the end of the protocol, administer (5-10 min) a suitable positive control to test for responsiveness of the preparation and collect 10-15 min baseline samples after the stimulation period.\nNOTE: Several test substances can be used as positive control, e.g., stimuli for increasing [cAMP]i (e.g., foskolin or IBMX), [Ca2+]i (e.g., bombesin or neuromedin C), depolarizing agents (e.g., 30-50 mM KCl) or more physiologically relevant stimuli such as macronutrients: glucose, peptones, amino acids, etc. However, the choice of positive control depends on the experimental outcome. Glucose is for instance a poor cholecystokinin (CCK) secretagogue whereas bombesin is not a robust secretagogue for glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) secretion30.\nAfter the end of experiment, excise the perfused gut, weigh it and measure its length. Put it in paraformaldehyde and store it (4 °C) for potential later histochemical analysis of tissue integrity/damage, for instance by H&E staining.\n5. Biochemical Measurements\nQuantify concentrations of secreted peptides in the venous effluent by use of an in-house or commercially available radioimmunoassays (RIA) or ELISA-assays. For studies that investigate intestinal absorption, quantify the molecule of interest, e.g., glucose or amino acids, in the venous effluent.",
    "NOTE: The perfusate is usually a good basal buffer for most analyses, including assays that relies on enzymatic reactions (such as quantification of glucose by the glucoseoxidase method).\n6. Data Analysis\nPresent data in different ways, for instance as a time-concentration graph showing the actual secretory output (flow x concentration) and as column plot depicting the total secretory output during baseline and response periods (usually 10-15 time points).\nPlot the actual measured concentration of the respective hormones as concentration units. (pmol/L),\nNOTE: It is preferable to instead express data as output (fmol/min) because with this model, in contrast to in vivo studies, the obtained values are the actual secretory output (because of the constant collection of perfusion effluent).\nDepending on the number of groups to be analyzed statistically, use two-tailed paired t-test (two groups) or one-way ANOVA for repeated measurements (more than two groups) followed by an appropriate post-hoc test for multiple comparisons.\nSubscription Required.
