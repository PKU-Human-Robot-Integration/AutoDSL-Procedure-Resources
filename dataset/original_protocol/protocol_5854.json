    "Wheat cultivationPlace 6-8 wheat seeds in the pot (25 cm in diameter) with 2/3 Wheatfield soil and cover with soil (1.5-2 cm in height). Add 0.5 L H2O into each pot to make the soil moist.Grow the plants in a growth chamber with a photoperiod of 16 h light (20 °C)/8 h dark (18 °C), a relative humidity of 50-65%.After approximately 10-12 days at the 2-leaf stage, cultivate the plants at 20 h light (13 °C)/4 h dark (11 °C), with 40-60% relative humidity for 3 weeks. Water once per week.Cover the root with additional soil at 4-leaf stage (approx. 5-week-old plants), add 1.2 g urea into each pot and watering. Cultivate the plants at a photoperiod of 20 h light (16 °C)/4 h dark (13 °C), and a humidity of 40-60% for 3 weeks. Water once per week.At the booting stages (approx. 8-week-old plants), cultivate the plant at a photoperiod of 18 h light (18 °C)/6 h dark (16 °C), a humidity of 40-60% for 2 weeks, and apply 1-1.5 g urea to each pot. Water once a week.At the flowering stages, cultivate the plant at a photoperiod of 18 h light (20 °C)/6 h dark (18 °C), a humidity of 45-55% for 2 weeks. Use approximately 11-week-old plants for inoculating wheat head with fungal conidia.One day before inoculation, adjust the plant growth conditions to a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark at 25 °C, and a humidity of 45-55%.Wheat head inoculation with F. graminearum Preparation of F. graminearum conidial suspensionPrepare the PDA plate (6 cm), then inoculate tested fungus F. graminearum PH-1 with sterile hole puncher (~2 mm in diameter) onto the PDA plate in a sterile bench, and culture at 25 °C for 2-3 days in the incubator.",
    "Transfer the 1/4th square inch of fungal plug from PDA plate into a 250 ml conical flask with 50 ml CMC liquid medium in the sterile bench, and culture with shaking at 220 rpm at 25 °C for 3 days.Use one layer of sterile miracloth to filter mycelium, collect the filtrate, and wash the mycelium several times. Then transfer the filtrate into a 50 ml tube and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 8 min at room temperature (if the volume of filtrate is over 50 ml, repeat this step).Discard the liquid supernatant carefully, and resuspend the conidia with sterilized water, count the number of conidia with a hemocytometer, and adjust the conidial concentration to 1.5-2.0 x 105/ml.Conidial inoculationTen microliter conidial suspension (1.5-2.0 x 105/ml) is inoculated to the floret in the middle of lemma and palea of fourth or fifth spikelet from the base of spike (Figure 1). The inoculation condition is at 25 °C, with a high relative humidity by covering the spikes with a plastic bag for conidia germination. Remove the plastic bags at 36 h post inoculation. At least ten wheat heads are inoculated for each strain. Cultivation lasts for 10-12 days before investigating the disease index.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730014416_8487.jpgFigure 1. The diagram of conidial inoculation in wheat spike. A. One droplet (~10 μl) of conidial suspension was injected into one floret of a wheat spikelet. B. The enlarged figure is shown the structure of one wheat spikelet in wheat spike: 1. Outer glume; 2. Inner glume; 3. Floret; 4. Lemma; 5. Palea; 6. Stamen; 7. Pistil.Wheat head inoculation by F. graminearum agar discsThis method is specially used for mutant strains which do not produce conidia although it can also be used as an alternative method for wheat head inoculation of normal strains.Preparation of F.",
    "graminearum agar discsInoculate the agar block (~2 mm in diameter) of a 3-days pathogen culture onto a PDA plate (6 cm) in a sterile bench and cultivate at 25 °C for 2-3 days. Use a sterile hole puncher (~2 mm in diameter) to cut the plate agar to get the fungus agar block for inoculation.Inoculation by fungus agar blockInoculate the fungus agar block (~2 mm in diameter) with a toothpick to the floret in the middle of lemma and palea of fourth or fifth spikelet from the bottom of the wheat at blooming stage (Figure 2). The greenhouse temperature is maintained at 25 °C, and appropriate high relative humidity of the spikes is kept by covering with a plastic bag for conidia germination. Remove plastic bags at 36 h after inoculation. Cultivation lasts for 10-12 days before investigating the block inoculation result. At least ten wheat heads are inoculated for each strain.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730014450_3739.jpgFigure 2. The diagram of fungus agar disc inoculation in wheat spike. A mycelial agar disc (~2 mm in diameter) was inoculated into one floret of a wheat spikelet. 1. Mycelial agar disc; 2. Toothpick.Inoculation resultAbout 10-12 days post-inoculation, the whole wheat head is generally diseased by inoculation of conidial suspension or agar block of F. graminearum PH-1, while only a part of the wheat head is diseased by inoculation of that of Fgkin1 mutant (Figure 3A). No obvious symptom is observed for the water control.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730014547_4796.jpgFigure 3. Disease symptom and statistical analysis of wheat head infection assay. A. Flowering wheat heads were drop inoculated with water (CK) or conidia of the wild type PH-1 and Fgkin1 mutant. Black arrows indicate the inoculated spikelet. Disease index was estimated as the number of diseased spikelets on each inoculated wheat heads. B.",
