    "1. Design of the 6 by 6 DNA Accordion Rack with caDNAno14\nDownload and install caDNAno 2.0 software14 to design a DNA accordion rack (caDNAno 2.5 is also available on https://github.com/cadnano/cadnano2.5). Open caDNAno14 and click the Square Tool to add a new part with a square lattice.\nNumber each beam of the accordion rack and draw on the left lattice panel of the caDNAno14 (Figure 2).\nClick the pencil tool and draw each beam on the right edit panel on the caDNAno14. Break beams every 32 bp, which is for joints between adjacent beams. Place staple crossovers in the same position as the joints. Use the Insert Tool and the Pencil Tool in caDNAno14 to let the joints have additional single-stranded crossovers.\nClick the Pencil Tool and connect the joints. Each beam has seven joints.\nGenerate scaffold crossovers to merge the scaffolds into the single loop by using the previously reported scaffold routing algorithm11. Do not let the minimum binding domain between scaffold and staple strands be less than 8 bp (Figure 3).\nPlace the scaffolds that are not used in the assembly at the vertices located on opposite sides of the accordion rack, as shown in Figure 3.\nClick the Break Tool. Break the strands where staple strands are circular or longer than 60 bp.\nDesign the DNA lock strands.\n\t\nClick the Break Tool. Break 8 bp of a staple DNA region to make a sticky part and delete 8 bp of a staple DNA region. There are 18 sticky parts (Figure 1) in the 6 by 6 accordion rack.\nPlace sequences that are reverse complementary to the sticky parts at both ends of lock strands and connect them by a bridging region, which consists of poly T strands of the desired length (Figure 1B).",
    "For the reconfiguration, add 8 bp of toehold sequences at the end of DNA locks for strand displacement. The toehold sequence used is in Table 2.\nPrepare poly A strands which are reverse complementary to the bridging region.\nDesign strands that are reverse complementary to the DNA locks for the reconfiguration experiment.\nClick the Sequence Tool and click scaffold DNA. Choose the scaffold as standard M13mp18. Click the Export Tool and save sequence in csv format (Table 1).\n2. Simulate the Structure with the oxDNA\nDownload and install the oxDNA16,17. The latest source code is available on https://sourceforge.net/projects/oxdna/files/.\nMake starting configuration files from the caDNAno14 file using python script 'cadnano_interface.py', which is provided in the oxDNA16,17 package. The usage is as follows: ‘python cadnano_interface.py cadnano_file.json sq’. The topology file and configuration file are now generated.\n\tNote: The topology file includes how many strands and nucleotides are in the structure and information regarding backbone-backbone bonds between nucleotides. The configuration file includes general information such as timestep, energy, and box size. Orientation information such as position vector, backbone-base vector, normal vector, velocity, and angular velocity of nucleotides is also included (Figure 4).\nChange the information in the topology and configuration file from caDNAno14 to make them reflect the real structural information of the accordion rack. All beams are arranged in parallel when the topology and configuration files from caDNAno14 are visualized. However, the accordion rack is a lattice structure so the distance between bonded nucleotides are far for simulation (Figure 5).",
    "Rotate and move each beam to the desired lattice structure. The nine columns on the left in the configuration file are the position vector, backbone-base vector, and normal vector (Figure 4). To rotate a beam, rotate all of position, backbone-base, and normal vectors using rotational transformation. Then move a beam by changing the position vector to locate it as shown in Figure 5.\nRelax the structure using the script provided in the oxDNA package (see example in $oxDNA/EXAMPLES/RELAX_INITIAL_CONFIGURATION for further information).\nRun molecular dynamics simulation for ten million steps using the relaxed configuration file. The usage is as follows: ‘./oxDNA <input>’ Save data every 5000 or 10000 steps.\nVisualization\n\tNote: The structures were visualized using cogli.\n\t\nDownload and install the latest version of the cogli (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cogli1/).\nRun the cogli with the topology and configuration files from the oxDNA simulation. The usage is as follows: ‘./cogli1 -t <topology file> <configuration file>’ .\nHide the box by pressing b.\n3. Synthesis of the Structure\nNote: The synthesis method is adapted from the previous protocol15,18.\nPurchase the designed DNA staples from an oligonucleotide provider.\nAdjust the concentration of these DNA staples to 100 μM using nuclease-free water.\n\t\nPool each DNA strand that constitutes a ‘free state’ structure into one tube and adjust the concentration to 2 μM for each strand.\nPool DNA lock strands by length and number of lock sites into tubes and adjust the concentration to 2 μM for each strand. 18, 9, and 4 lock sites are used. Add poly A strands which are complementary to the bridging region at the same concentration.\nPool strands that are reverse complementary to the DNA lock strands by length into tubes and adjust the concentration to 2 μM for each strand.",
    "Prepare MgCl2 solution of 300 nM by mixing 70 μL of nuclease-free water and 30 μL of the 1 μM MgCl2 solution. Prepare a 5x Tris EDTA solution by mixing 95 μL of nuclease-free water and 5 μL of the 100x Tris EDTA solution.\nAdd 2 μL of staple DNA, 1.1 μL of MgCl2 solution, 2 μL of Tris EDTA solution, 7.6 μL of nuclease-free water and 7.3 μL of scaffold DNA of which the concentration is 110 nM to make 20 μL of mixed stock. Set the final concentration of the scaffold DNA to 40 nM, staple DNA to 200 nM, MgCl2 to 16 mM and Tris EDTA solution to 0.5x.\nRapidly heat the mixed stock solution in a thermal cycler to 80 °C and cool to 60 °C at a rate of 4 min per °C and cool from 60 °C to 4 °C at a rate of 40 min per °C.\n4. Purification of the Structure\nNote: Samples of all structures were purified before analysis. In this section, we describe the protocol of PEG purification, which is adapted from previous literature19. The sample can also be purified by gel electrophoresis as described in previous literature15,18.\nPrepare 5 M of NaCl and 100x Tris-EDTA.\nPrepare precipitation-buffer by mixing 150 μL of PEG 8000, 500 μL of 100x Tris EDTA and 101 μL of 5 M NaCl and 249 μL of nuclease-free water.\nPrepare target-buffer by mixing 5.5 μL of 300 nM MgCl2 solution from Section 3.3, 10 μL of 5x Tris EDTA solution from Section 3.3 and 84.5 μL of nuclease-free water.",

Remove the supernatant and dissolve pellet in the target-buffer from Section 4.3.\n5. Reconfiguration of the Accordion Rack from a ‘Free State’ to a ‘Locked State’\nSynthesize the structure without DNA locks for the configuration experiment.\nPrepare DNA lock strands from Section 3.\nAdd 2 μL of DNA lock strands of the desired length into 20 μL of the synthesized structure. The DNA lock strands’ concentration is five times higher than the structure.\nIncubate the sample for 0, 10, 25, 50, or 100 minutes to see how fast reconfiguration occurs.\n\t\nFor the 100 minute incubation, incubate the sample at 50 °C for 30 minutes and slowly cool down to 25 °C at a rate of 0.33 °C/minute.\nFor the 50 minute incubation, incubate the sample at 50 °C for 15 minutes and slowly cool down to 25 °C at a rate of 0.66 °C/minute.\nFor the 25 minute incubation, incubate the sample at 50 °C for 7.5 minutes and slowly cool down to 25 °C at a rate of 1.32 °C/minute.\nFor the 10 minute incubation, incubate the sample at 50 °C for 3 minutes and slowly cool down to 25 °C at a rate of 3.3 °C/minute.\nFor the 0-minute incubation, store sample at 4 °C right after DNA locks strands are added.\nRight after the attaching step, rapidly cool down the sample to 4 °C to prevent unwanted denaturation.\n6. Reconfiguration of the Accordion Rack from a ‘Locked State’ to a ‘Free State’\nSynthesize the structure with DNA locks of the desired length for the configuration experiment.\nPrepare reverse complementary strands from Section 3.",

FRET Analysis\nUse Atto 550 and Atto 647N dye, for which the Förster distance is 6.5 nm. Replace Staple 58 and Staple 117 in Table 1 with fluorescently labelled strands. Then synthesize the structure with fluorescently labelled strands by the method described in Section 3.\nMeasure the concentration of the purified sample.\nNormalize the sample to 10 nM and load 50 μL to the 384 microplates well.",
