    "Establishing stable cell lines expressing the H4K20me1-mintbody (Figure 2)Note: When using primary cells, cell sorting can be used instead of establishing antibiotic resistant clones. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511020714_2752.jpgFigure 2. Scheme for preparing cells expressing H4K20me1-mintbody and Halo-SUV420H1Maintain HeLa cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere, according to a standard protocol (Freshney, 2015). Transfect the plasmid DNA encoding the H4K20me1-mintbody into cells using FuGENE HD, as per standard protocol. Typically, cells were plated onto 6 well plate (2 x 105 cells in 2 ml medium/well) on the day before transfection. Mix 2 μg plasmid and 6 μl FuGENE HD in 100 μl Opti-MEM, leave the mixture for 5 min at room temperature, and add the mixture to one well of a 6-well plate containing 2 ml medium. Put back the plate into a CO2 incubator.The next day, to obtain the stable cell line expressing the mintbody, harvest the cells, dilute at around 103 cells/ml, and plate cells on to a 6 well plate (2 ml per well) or a 10 cm dish (10 ml per dish) in DMEM with FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin, containing 1 mg/ml G-418. Approximately two weeks after addition of G-418, isolate and expand GFP-positive colonies. Isolation of cells expressing H4K20me1-mintbody can be done in several ways (Freshney, 2015).If fluorescent colonies are observed at a high frequency (> 10%), randomly pick up 24 colonies using a micropipette with a 200 μl tip, or using a cloning ring, and transfer into a 24-well glass-bottom plate containing 0.5 ml DMEM containing FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin (without G-418). If fluorescent colonies are rarely observed, pick up them after marking their position under an inverted fluorescence microscope.",
    "A few days later, investigate the level and distribution of fluorescence in each well under an inverted fluorescence microscope using a dry lens with a high numerical aperture and a short working distance (e.g., Plan Apo 40x DIC M N2 [NA 0.95]). Fluorescent cells can also be collected using a cell sorter, if available.Cell preparation for imagingTwo days before imaging, plate cells expressing mintbody in a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (2 ml medium; ~2 x 105 cells/dish). The next day, transfect the plasmid DNA encoding Halo-SUV420H1 into cells using FuGENE HD to convert monomethylated H4K20 to trimethylation. Transfection using 2 μg plasmid and 6 μl FuGENE HD is carried out as indicated above. The transaction efficiency typically yields ~30%.A day after transfection, replace the culture medium to FluoroBrite DMEM with 10% FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin, containing 0.1 μM Halo TMR ligand. Incubate the cells at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere.Image acquisitionOne hour after the addition of Halo TMR ligand, set the glass-bottom dish onto a heated stage. It is not essential to remove free TMR. However, if the expression level of HaloTag-tagged protein is low and background fluorescence hampers the detection, cells should be washed three times with FluoroBrite DMEM with 10% FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin, before setting the dish onto a heated stage.Acquire fluorescence images for the H4K20me1-mintbody (green channel) and TMR-labeled Halo-SUV420H1 (red channel) using a confocal microscope with laser lines at 488 and 561 nm, combined with a dichroic mirror DM405/488/561/640 and emission filters 520/30 and 617/73, respectively.Notes:  One hour staining with 0.1 μM Halo TMR ligand is usually sufficient to label HaloTag-tagged proteins. However, if the signal intensity is not high enough, samples can be incubated overnight with the TMR ligand. Washing with FluoroBrite DMEM with 10% FBS and L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin also improves the signal-to-noise ratio.",
    "To avoid the saturation of fluorescence intensity, we briefly scan multiple areas and set up the laser power and exposure time to cover all cells (except dead ones, which sometimes exhibit brightest fluorescence) are within the dynamic range of the camera for both green and red channels.Non-transfected cells in the captured images will be used for negative control cells.Empirically, at least 30 Halo-positive cells should be imaged for a good statistical analysis. Total 200 cells including non-transfected cells are typically imaged."
