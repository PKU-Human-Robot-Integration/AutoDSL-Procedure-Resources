    "This technique requires preparation of (A) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), (B) micropatterned polymer surface on a glass substrate, and (C) assembly of membrane arrays on the micropatterned substrate and protein functionalization (Figure 1). The SUVs can be prepared in advance and stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. Steps (B) and (C) take 2–3 days, depending on the flexible incubation times.Briefly, PLL-(g)-PEG scaffold polymers are first coated on a glass coverslip, followed by selective deep UV etching with a photomask and lipid vesicle deposition, to generate regions of immobile polymers and mobile lipid membranes. The ephrinA1 ligands are then functionalized to the substrate in mobile and immobile configurations, to probe EphA2 receptor clustering in cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4434/bioprotoc-12-11-4434-g001.jpgFigure 1. Procedures to Fabricate Micropatterned Substrate of Mobile and Immobile Ligands. Vesicle preparationFor this step, the audiences can refer to a more detailed protocol (Lin et al., 2009).Prepare lipid films, by mixing required amounts of various lipid molecules [96% DOPC + 4% DGS-NTA(Ni), with a total mass of 2 mg], which are dissolved in chloroform in a round bottom flask, followed by evaporation of chloroform using a rotary evaporator under vacuum pumping and 50°C water bath, leading to the formation of a thin lipid film in the flask. During this procedure, slowly lower the round bottom flask to the water bath, to avoid chloroform boiling.Resuspend the lipid film in 2 mL of deionized water by pipetting, allowing the formation of large and often multilamellar vesicles (1 mg/mL).Sonicate the vesicle suspensions in ice using a probe tip sonicator, to generate SUVs. Typically, use a program of '10 s on, and 5 s off’ for 8–10 cycles for sonication. Transfer the SUV suspension to a fresh tube, and centrifuge at 20,000 × g and 4°C for 2 h, to remove any debris.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, and store at 4°C until further use. The SUVs can be stored for up to 2 weeks, to form a good lipid bilayer.MicrofabricationMicropatterned surfaces are prepared on glass substrates, using the deep ultraviolet (UV) etching method.Clean glass coverslips by sonication in a 1:1 mixture of isopropanol and water for 15–30 min, followed by overnight (or longer) incubation in 50% H2SO4 solution. Before usage, take the coverslips out of H2SO4, rinse with water, and expose the glass coverslips to UV light in an enclosed UVO cleaner for 10 min. Rinse with water, and dry by N2 jet.Incubate the glass coverslips with PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(2)/PEG(3.4)-biotin(50%) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL at room temperature for 2 h, or overnight. To reduce the usage of reagents, drop ~30 μL of the incubating solution in parafilm, and lay the glass coverslips on top of it.Rinse the substrates with water to remove excess polymer, and dry by N2 jet.Drop ~1.5 μL of water on the micropatterned area (1 cm × 1 cm square) of a chromium-quartz photomask, and lay the polymer-coated glass substrate on its top, to ensure close contact. Expose the substrates to deep UV light for 9–12 min in a UVO cleaner. The UV light-exposed polymer will be degraded. Rinse the substrates with excess water to remove any degraded polymer.Incubate the same glass substrates with PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(3.4)-NTA at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL at room temperature for 2 h, and repeat the deep UV etching and washing procedures. After the second etching, the glass substrates should be used for lipid bilayer deposition immediately.Bilayer deposition and protein functionalizationBefore usage, mix SUVs with TBS buffer in 1:1 ratio.",
    "Incubate the micropatterned substrates with SUV solution for 5 min, to allow the self-assembly of lipid bilayers in regions of the substrates that were UV etched in the previous step.Rinse the substrates with excess TBS buffer, and assemble the glass coverslips into a cell culture imaging chamber, under the aqueous environment.Block the substrates with bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (0.05–0.1 mg/mL in TBS buffer) at room temperature for 2h, or at 4°C overnight.Wash the substrates with TBS buffer, and incubate with NeutrAvidin (1.5 µg/mL) for 15 min, to bind surface biotin groups.Wash excess NeutrAvidin with TBS buffer, and incubate with ephrinA1-His 10 (purified ephrinA1 protein with a 10-histidine tail in the C-terminus, labeled with Alexa FluorTM 680), and RGD-biotin, for an additional 60–90 min. The ephrinA1-His 10 will bind to both DGS-NTA(Ni) lipids on mobile regions, and PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(3.4)-NTA polymers on immobile regions, while RGD-biotin will bind to NeutrAvidin. The RGD peptides can bind integrins at the cell membrane, to allow cell spreading, during which cells dynamically interact with multiple ephrinA1-functionalized mobile or immobile regions.Remove unbound proteins by washing with imaging buffer.Check fluorescence intensity of mobile and immobile ephrinA1 under a microscope.The substrates are ready for use in a live cell experiment. Prepare cells in the imaging buffer, and seed a low density of cells into the substrate chamber at 37°C for live imaging. The cellular EphA2 receptors will form clusters only after binding with mobile ephrinA1 (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4434/bioprotoc-12-11-4434-g002.jpgFigure 2.
