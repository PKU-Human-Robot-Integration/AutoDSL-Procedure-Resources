    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is divided into three sections, each of which will offer a unique readout for evaluating the thermostability, protein folding, and transcriptional activity of p53.\nDifferential scanning fluorimetry\nTiming: 2 days\nDSF can be used to measure the thermostability of a protein based on the melting temperature (Tm) as readout (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Niesen et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This assay provided evidence that arsenic trioxide (ATO) stabilized five mutant p53 DBDs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In this assay we compared the stabilizing effect of ATO on five frequent DBD mutants, including four structural hotspot mutants and the V272M mutant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/874-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Calculated Tm values of the indicated p53 DBDs\nProtein was incubated with or without ATO treatment for 16–20 h at the indicated ratios in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl. Bars represent mean ± SD (n = 3) and p-values are shown.\nThaw the purified p53 DBD protein solution and place it on ice.\nDilute p53 DBD using 4°C storage buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM DTT, pH 7.6) to a final concentration of 10 μM (about 0.2 mg/mL). Exchange the buffer with HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) by dialysis for 16–20 h.\nNote: Because DTT competes with cysteines of p53 for ATO binding, it should be removed from the DSF system when evaluating ATO. To avoid precipitation, the DBD was maintained at low concentration during dialysis.\nDilute ATO with HEPES buffer to a final concentration of 1.25 mM.\nNote: Because of the thermodynamic instability of the p53 DBD, the HEPES buffer used throughout the protocol must be pre-cooled to 4°C.",
    "Note: A stock solution of 1 mg/mL ATO was prepared by diluting the ATO powder in 1 mol/L NaOH and then adjusting pH to 7.2 with HCl.\nAdd the purified p53 DBD, ATO, and HEPES buffer into a pre-cooled PCR tube as listed in the table below. The final molar ratio of p53 DBD to ATO is 1:20.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_874_7.csv\nMix gently and spin down the solution using refrigerated microcentrifuge (100 × g, 4°C, 5 s).\nIncubate the solution at 4°C for 16–20 h.\nCritical: For some compounds such as PK11007, incubation for shorter periods (e.g., 15 min) is sufficient to achieve the maximal change of Tm (indicated by the ΔTm value). However, for some covalently reacting compounds such as ATO, incubation for > 2–8 hrs is required to result in significant changes of ΔTm. Thus, this step is suggested to be performed for 16–20 h for ATO, see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nPrepare a 25× working solution of SYPRO Orange by diluting the 5000 × stock solution 1:200 with HEPES buffer.\nAdd 8 μL of 25× SYPRO Orange to the 32 μL solution and mix gently.\nPipette 30 μL of the resulting solution into three wells of a pre-cooled PCR plate, i.e., 10 μL for each replicate, and seal the plate with optical sealing foil.\nSpin the solution to the bottom of the plate using small benchtop centrifuge (64 × g, 4°C, 5 s).\nSet the detection format to the SYPRO® Orange format (FAM (492 nm) and ROX (610 nm), for excitation and emission, respectively).\nPlace the plate into an RT-PCR instrument and run a temperature gradient from 20°C to 85°C at 2°C per min, reading the SYPRO® Orange fluorescence intensity every 0.2°C.\nData analysis.\nClick the ‘Export’ button and export the .ixo file from LightCycler® 480 software.",
    "In Roche Protein Melting software, choose the ‘folder’ and open the exported .ixo file.\nChoose ‘Analyse’ tab and click ‘Add Analysis’ button. The calculated Tm values that analyzed by Boltzmann method can be obtained in the .csv file. A representative melting temperature curve of p53 DBD (R175H and G245S) with or without ATO treatment was shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/874-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The representative melting curves for p53 DBD without or with ATO\nRecombinant p53 DBD was mixed without or with ATO at a molar ratio of 1:20 in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl for 16–20 h. Melting curves were then measured in the DSF assay and the calculated Tm is shown.\nExport the calculated Tm in .csv file.\nPAb1620 immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 4 days\nFolded p53 can be recognized by the PAb1620 antibody (Wang et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). This IP protocol assesses the immunoreactivity of p53 mutants with the PAb1620 antibody, indicating level of folded p53 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/874-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. PAb1620 IP assay of p53 mutants\np53 mutants were expressed in transfected H1299 cells. The input and immunoprecipitated p53 was probed. Relative band intensity was measured by ImageJ and normalized for each immunoblotting. Bars represent mean ± SD derived from three PAb1620 immunoprecipitation experiments. Representative images from one immunoprecipitation experiment are shown.\nOne day before starting the protocol, seed H1299 cells into 6-well plates with 1.0 x 106 cells and 3 mL of complete DMEM medium per well, incubate the cells for 16–20 h . The cells should reach around 50% confluence the next day.\nOn day 1, transfect the cells with the p53 expression plasmid (2.5 μg plasmid per well) according to the manufacturer’s protocol of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.",
    "Alternatives: Other transfection reagents can also be used. No transfection is required if working with cell lines that carry endogenous p53 mutations.\nOn day 2, dilute ATO stock resolution with growth medium to a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and add diluted ATO to each well to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. After gentle shaking, incubate the cells for 16–20 h.\nNote: incubation for 2 h is also acceptable for ATO.\nOn day 3, wash the cells with cold PBS, lyse them with 1 mL of 4°C NP40 buffer, and collect the lysate into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPause point: at this point the sample can be directly used or stored at −80°C (stable for 1–3 weeks).\nSonicate the cell lysate on ice for 3 cycles with 2 s ON and 2 s OFF at 200 watts.\nShake the cell lysate on ice for 10 min.\nSpin the lysate in a pre-cooled refrigerated microcentrifuge (16,100 × g, 20 min, 4°C) and collect the supernatant in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube (20 μL supernatant should be taken out as an input sample).\nTo immunoprecipitate p53, add 20 μL protein G beads and 1–3 μg of PAb1620 antibody to 450 μL of supernatant, and rotate the mixture for 2 h at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 16,100 × g for 5 s using refrigerated microcentrifuge, and carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nWash the beads with 1 mL of 20°C–25°C NP40 buffer, centrifuge at 16,100 × g for 5 s using refrigerated microcentrifuge, and carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette. Repeat this step once.\nCritical: In this step, the NP40 buffer used for wash should be at 20°C–25°C, see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAdd 20 μL of 2× SDS loading buffer to the pellet.",
    "Heat the sample at 95°C–100°C for 5 min, followed by immunoblotting.\nNote: To probe the immunoprecipitated p53 on the PVDF membrane, incubate the membrane with anti-mouse kappa light chain (HRP) secondary antibody which does not recognize the heavy chain of PAb1620 on the membrane.\nLuciferase reporter assay\nTiming: 3 days\nThis luciferase reporter assay assesses the transcriptional activity of p53 on a defined response element in H1299 cells. The readout is relative luciferase units (RLU), indicating the transcriptional activity of p53.\nOne day before starting the protocol, seed H1299 cells into 96-well plates with 3.0 x 104 cells and 100 μL of medium per well, followed by incubation for 16–20 h. The cells should reach around 30% confluence the next day.\nNote: Before starting, make sure the H1299 cells used for seeding are in the rapid multiplication stage, typically corresponding to 80–90% confluence.\nOn day 1, co-transfect the cells with the p53-expression plasmid, luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla plasmid using FuGENE®6 transfection reagent (Promega, E1960). 3 replicates should be set for each sample. The instructions below list the reagents for 10 wells in a 96-well plate.\nPrepare the followed mixture of plasmids (total volume can be about 1–20 μL dependent on the plasmid concentration) in a 1.5 mL tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_874_8.csv\nMix 3 μL FuGENE®6 transfection reagent and 50 μL Opti-MEM in a 300 μL tube by gently pipetting and incubate for 5 min.\nAdd the 53 μL solution to the plasmid mixture, and mix by gently pipetting. Incubate the resulting transfection mixture for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 1 mL of 20°C–25°C DMEM medium to the transfection mixture and pipette the solution thoroughly. The resulting solution is then used to replace all the culture medium in the wells of the 96-well plate with pre-seeded cells (100 μL per well).",
    "Critical: Different from some protocols in which the small-volume transfection mixture is added into 96-wells plate directly, in this protocol, large-volume DMEM is firstly added to the transfection mixture, followed by pipetting to achieve thorough mixing. The thoroughly mixed solution is then used to replace the DMEM in the 96-well plate with the pre-cultured cells, see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nOn day 2, dilute ATO stock resolution with growth medium to a concentration of 3 μg/mL, and add 50 μL diluted ATO to each well to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL.\nOn day 3, detect luciferase signal using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Vazyme, DL101-01). In current protocol, 1 μg/mL ATO treatment killed about 10% H1299 cells (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nRemove growth medium from cultured cells.\nRinse cells using 1 x PBS twice.\nAdd 20 μL 1 x lysis buffer to each well of the 96-well plate.\nShake the plate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPause point: at this point the sample can be directly used or stored at −80°C (stable for 1 week).\nTransfer 4 μL lysates to a white 96-well plate, and place the plate into a luminometer (SpectraMax® L Microplate Reader) with injectors.\nAdd 20 μL Reaction Buffer II into each well and measure the firefly luciferase signal.\nAdd 20 μL Stop & Reaction Buffer to each well and measure the Renilla luciferase signal.\nAlternatives: Other dual luciferase reporter assay kits, such as the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1910), can also be used."
