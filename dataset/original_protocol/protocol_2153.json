    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step explains how to dissect wholemount retinal tissue.\nRetinal tissue dissection.\nIn dark conditions, euthanize a mouse with CO2 gas (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Start the CO2 at a flow rate that will displace 30%–70% of the cage volume of air per minute. Once the mouse stops moving, increase the CO2 flow rate to its maximum.\nOne minute after the mouse stops breathing, move the mouse body to a tray for the enucleation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Pinch the mouse tail to confirm its unresponsiveness to pain stimulation and perform a cervical dislocation using hemostats. Then, enucleate the eyes using the #5/45 Dumont forceps and place the eyes in a 35 mm dish filled with oxygenated HEPES solution.\nTransfer the dish with eyes into the oxygenated dark box (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C_2).\nCritical: Remove the eyes, place them in the oxygenated dark box, and start dissection directly after euthanasia.\nPlace one eye in the dissection chamber under a stereo microscope, filled with HEPES solution and is continuously oxygenated (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C_4 and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nMake a cut on the cornea using a small surgical knife. Then, cut the cornea down to the sclera using a pair of Vannas scissors (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1737-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The retinal dissection in the HEPES solution-filled chamber\n(A) An enucleated eye held in place with #5 forceps.\n(B) Initial corneal cut with a surgical knife.\n(C) Inserting a blade of scissors into the incision, cut the cornea toward the sclera.\n(D) Cut out the cornea and the edge of sclera by a circumferential cut.\n(E) Removing the lens with forceps.\n(F) A small transfer pipette blowing fresh solution into the eyecup.",
    "(G) Detach the retina from the sclera using two sets of forceps. One to hold the sclera of the eyeball and the other to carefully peel off the retina from the pigment epithelium.\n(H) A piece of isolated retina in the dissecting dish.\n(I) Cut the retinal tissue into quarters.\n(J) A piece of quarter retina.\n(K) A horseshoe net and a coverslip with two grease rails prior to mounting of the retina.\n(L) A wholemount retinal preparation is mounted between the coverslip and the horseshoe net, ready for patch clamp recordings. Scale bars for panels A-J represent 5 mm.\nMake a circumferential cut around the cornea to remove the iris and cornea (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: Cut should be made on the sclera just above the extraocular muscle attachment to separate the anterior segment from the posterior segment of the eye.\nRemove the lens from the eyecup using #55 forceps. Then, pour fresh oxygenated HEPES solution into the eyecup using a 1 mL transfer pipette (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nPlace this eye back in the dark box. Remove the other eye and complete steps e-f on the new eye. Carry out the rest of the dissection on this more recently removed eye.\nCritical: The previous step allows for the experimenter to have one eye that will be fully dissected, and the eyecup in the box will be a healthy retina if anything goes wrong in the rest of the dissection or after during experimentation.\nRemove the transparent vitreous humor from the surface of the retina using sharp forceps. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "The vitreous is sticky and tightly attached to the retina. Using the sharp forceps, remove the vitreous in one location at a time by carefully grabbing near the surface of the retina and pulling it away. In the mouse the vitreous humor is fiber-like and can be carefully removed through grabbing carefully with a set of 55 Dumont forceps and pulling it out of the eyecup. Do not poke the surface of the retina. The vitreous is typically attached to the eye cup near the ora serrata, which can be targeted initially to efficiently remove the vitreous.\nThe ventral and dorsal retinas can be distinguished by the orientation of the optic nerve head relative to the choroidal fissure (Wei et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Make a small cut on the edge of the retina to mark the side of the retina you would keep or discard for the experiment.\nDetach the retina from the sclera using two pairs of forceps; hold the sclera with one and scrape off the retinal tissue by the other (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nIsolate the retina from the eyecup by pinching the optic nerve head with forceps.\nCut and trim the retina into four sections that will be mounted for patch clamp electrophysiological recordings (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I and 3J).\nMounting the retinal tissue.\nUsing a large transfer pipette, transfer one piece of tissue on to a coverslip with grease rails in a 35 mm dish with HEPES solution.\nPosition the tissue between the rails with the ganglion cell side up (the ganglion cell side is the inside of the retinal slab curvature). Grab the horseshoe net using the #5 forceps and place the net over the tissue. The tissue is now immobilized.\nPlace the dish in the oxygenated dark box. Repeat same steps for other pieces of the tissue.",
    "Establishing the whole cell patch clamp\nTiming: 30 min\nThis major step displays how to achieve the whole cell recordings from bipolar cells in the wholemount retina.\nTake a wholemount retina from the dark box and place it in the recording chamber on the patch clamp microscope stage. Immediately, start the Ames’ solution perfusion at a rate of 3–5 mL per minute using a gravity fed perfusion setup (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Set the temperature to 33 degrees Celsius.\nNote: This should be performed in dim red light or dark conditions.\nPlace a 3 M KCl agar bridge onto a reference wire for the micro pipette before mounting the retinal tissue. Alternatively, you can use a permanent silver chloride wire.\nNote: Please see Hellmer and Ichinose (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for a full protocol on agar bridge formation.\nUsing the 10× objective, place the retinal tissue in the viewing area. Put a recording pipette in the pipette holder on a micromanipulator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdvance the tip of the pipette in the center of the viewing area.\nSlowly move it down into the Ames’ solution.\nNote: The tip of the pipette should be close to the tissue but stay above the focal plane of the retina; then, change the objective to 60×.\nUnder the 60× objective, slowly move the lens down until you find the pipette tip. Then, lower the objective focus and the pipette tip in a back and forth manner repeatedly, until the tip is approximately 200 μm above the tissue. Then, apply a positive pressure into the pipette.\nInflate with the 1 mL of air into the pipette for wholemount tissue recordings.\nCritical: Applying the positive pressure into the pipette prevents the tip of the pipette clogging from the tissue and any remaining vitreous.",
    "At this point, set the pipette current to zero by the Axoclamp 700B commander.\nStart the Membrane Test program on the Clampex to measure the pipette resistance. The initial position is the Bath mode.\nAdvance the pipette tip to the tissue. Penetrate the inner limiting membrane (ILM) by the pipette (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). You should see that the positive air separates the membrane and ganglion cells, and each cell shows defined edges (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1737-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Whole cell recordings of bipolar cells\n(A) The surface of the retina under a 60× objective DIC imaging prior to puncture with a microelectrode.\n(B) The ganglion cell layer is exposed after puncturing of the ILM with a microelectrode and applying positive pressure.\n(C) An image of the bipolar cells layer with a microelectrode.\n(D) After physiological recording, an image of the bipolar cell was viewed under sulforhodamine imaging. The image shows a soma with the electrode. The vasculature is sometimes labeled by sulforhodamine in the whole mount retina.\n(E) Example recordings of ChR2-evoked EPSC responses in a bipolar cell under control, HEX, and MLA solution. The recordings show a cell that had MLA sensitive ACh currents and were not sensitive to HEX. Scale bars for main panels A-D are 30 μm. The inset for panel C scale bar is 5 μm.\nCritical: If the pipette does not separate the membrane and ganglion cells, advance the pipette further horizontally and slightly deeper. If it is still not achieved, there should be an issue with either pipette pressure leak, or tissue tension due to a loose or older net not creating good tension on the surface of the tissue for penetration.\nAdvance the pipette by an oblique approach into the inner nuclear layer (INL) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).",
    "Note: This is identified as a planar region of somas located ∼50μm below the GCL. The distance between the GCL and INL may vary from retina to retina.\nAdvance through a large layer with no visible somas, which is IPL.\nFollowing the IPL, there is another region with visible somas, which is the INL.\nCritical: In the INL, the first layer is amacrine cells with medium sized somas, whereas deeper in the INL, smaller somas are evident. The latter is bipolar cells.\nIn the bipolar cell region, target a cell where clearly the edge is visible. Position the pipette on the cell soma and advance slowly until a slight dimple on the cell membrane is visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Release the positive pressure.\nCritical: If successful, you should see the pipette resistance on the Membrane Test slowly increase to 100 MΩ. If the resistance does not increase, apply a small amount of negative pressure to the pipette.\nOnce the pipette resistance has reached above 100 MΩ, switch the Membrane Test program from the Bath mode (Holding potential, 0 mV) to the Cell Attached mode (-70 mV), which applies the negative current to the pipette. Then, wait until the resistance becomes above 1 GΩ. This is the “giga-seal”.\nAfter the giga-seal is achieved, apply a small amount of negative pressure (less than 1 mL) to the pipette to rupture the membrane within the pipette.\nUse a 50–100 μs zap to rupture the membrane if negative pressure is not sufficient.\nNote: The cell can be safely zapped two or three times before the experimenter could try a new cell.\nWhen successful, the membrane current shows wider transient current at the onset of the pulse. This is the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Once the membrane ruptures, switch the Membrane Test to the Cell mode.\nWait for ∼3 min for your intracellular solution to replace the cytoplasm of the cell and stabilize the recording.\nCritical: The baseline current should be around -20 to -50 pA at the holding potential of -70 mV. If the baseline current becomes more negative than -100 pA, this is the sign of leak current due to a poor seal, and would cause inaccurate recordings. Apply a small negative pressure to the pipette. If it does not improve the baseline current, remove the pipette, and try recording another cell.\nAfter this, you are ready to start recordings from the bipolar cell with either a light or electrical stimulus.\nNote: Check the sulforhodamine image of your bipolar cell after whole cell configuration is established. The soma should be brightly labeled with the fluorescent dye after a successful break-in during step 9 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: In addition, use an area of the retina where you penetrated the tissue earlier to put in a second pipette. This decreases the chances of going through another cells or vasculature that clogs the pipette before reaching the bipolar cell layer.\nRecording ChR2 light responses from bipolar cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step demonstrates how to record light-evoked responses and apply the pharmacological agents of this experiment.\nRecord the light-evoked postsynaptic currents (L-EPSCs) in response to a step of light in control Ames’ solution. In voltage-clamp mode, the tissue is illuminated with background green light. Then, use a ∼150 μm spot of light and increase the light level for one second. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThe CoolLED was used for the light stimulus, using a 500 nm (green) LED. The light intensity is controlled by changing the current through the analog waveform function in Clampex.",
    "The light level we used was 1.0 × 105 photons/μm2/s for the background, 1.0 × 107 photons/μm2/s for the initial spot light stimulation, and 1.56 × 1010 photons/μm2/s for the ChR2 stimulation.\nThe bipolar cell would respond either ON, OFF, or no response.\nCritical: If no light response is present, examine the morphology of the cell and move on to recording another cell in the tissue.\nIf the cell responds to a step of light, record several L-EPSCs. Then, start perfusion of the second Ames’ solution containing the glutamate receptor blockers. Several minutes after the blocker perfusion, run the same stimulation protocol in Clampex to record L-EPSCs. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThis time you should see no L-EPSCs because glutamate receptors are blocked and the light level is not high enough to activate ChR2.\nIf light response remains, wait another few minutes and record L-EPSCs. The response should disappear at this light level.\nIncrease the stimulus light level to activate ChR2 and record L-EPSCs. The response should be evoked through the ChR2 activation.\nThe ChR2 requires a bright light stimulus. In our measurement, the threshold for ChR2 was 107 photons/μm2/s.\nFor the optogenetic recordings, use a 100 ms duration spot of light stimulus.\nRecord the ChR2-evoked EPSCs in the absence or presence of the nicotinic acetylcholine antagonists, MLA and HEX (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nAfter several L-EPSCs recordings in the control Ames’ solution, MLA or HEX is added to perfusing Ames’ solution with glutamate receptor blockers. The order of MLA and HEX is random, on a cell-to-cell basis. Perfuse the first cholinergic blocker solution for over 5 min, then record several L-EPSCs.\nIf the first blocker did not affect the L-EPSCs, apply the second cholinergic blocker in addition to the first drug.",
    "If there is a change in the response after the first blocker application, wash out the drug for 5 min with Ames’ solution, and then solely apply the second cholinergic blocker.\nAfter 5 min of the second cholinergic blocker perfusion, record the ChR2-evoked EPSCs.\nOnce this is complete, wash out the drug solution with regular Ames’ solution and see if normal photoreceptor light response is present.\nImaging terminals of recorded cell to determine bipolar cell type\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the method for identification of bipolar cell types in live tissue immediately after physiological recordings.\nImage your cell using epifluorescence for sulforhodamine and ChR2-EYFP fluorescence.\nVisualize the sulforhodamine in the recording pipette and the soma of the recorded cell. Use the rhodamine (red) fluorescence cube and the bright LED light (∼560 nm).\nIdentify bipolar cells. After viewing the pipette and the connected soma, view deeper into the tissue to find the dendrites of the cell. The dendrites should go down to the OPL and have some branches. If there are no dendrites, you are likely recording from an amacrine cell.\nIdentify bipolar cell axon terminals. View the terminals of the bipolar cell by searching toward the surface of the tissue. A single axon shaft emerges from the soma, which spreads out to the axon terminals in the IPL (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1737-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Identification of bipolar cell types\nRepresentative images of different bipolar cell types are shown under sulforhodamine and YFP fluorescence. The soma with dendrites verifies that the recorded cell was a bipolar cell. Axon terminal ramification in relation to ChAT band allows cell type identification. Panels are multiple cells from Type 1 or 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 7 cone bipolar cells.",
    "Refer to the ON and OFF ChAT bands to identify the bipolar cell type. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The Ai32 ChAT-Cre mouse contains ChR2 tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). Therefore, both ON and OFF SACs are labeled with YFP throughout the soma and processes (Hellmer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nObserve the YFP expression with a GFP filter cube via 500 nm LED light illumination with the CoolLED.\nNote: The ON ChAT band is closer to the GCL in the IPL. The OFF ChAT band is deeper in the IPL, closer to the INL.\nCompare the location of the axon terminals ramification and the ON and OFF ChAT bands (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThe terminal ramifies outer to OFF ChAT band: type 1 or 2.\nThe terminal ramifies slightly inner to OFF ChAT band: type 3.\nThe terminal ramifies both inner and outer of OFF ChAT band: type 4.\nThe terminal ramifies on the ON ChAT band: type 5.\nThe terminal ramifies slightly inner to ON ChAT band: type 7.\nThe terminal ramifies from outer to inner ON ChAT band: type 6.\nThe terminal ramifies completely inner to ON ChAT band: type 8 or 9.\nThe terminal ramifies inner to ON ChAT band with the beads shape: rod bipolar cells.\nCapture images of the YFP at the same depth as that of the terminals.\nHave a figure of the bipolar cell type morphology and stratifications at your recording station for easier identification (Wassle et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])."
