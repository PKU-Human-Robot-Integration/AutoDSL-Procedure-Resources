  "procedures": [
    "1. Thawing and Culturing Cells\nObtain stock of frozen immortalized N19-oligodendroglial cells from long term liquid nitrogen stores.\nImmerse vial containing cells at 37 °C water bath until the cell suspension is completely thawed.\nAdd 7 mL of DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) with high-glucose supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to a 10 cm culture plate.\nAdd the cell-suspension drop-wise to the plate, and gently agitate and rock the Petri plate to disperse the cells evenly.\nCulture cells at 34 °C/5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 4 hours, aspirate media from plates to remove any remaining DMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) that had been used as a cryoprotectant, and replace with fresh media (7 mL DMEM high-glucose media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin).\n2. Passaging Cells\nAt 70-80% confluence (4-7 days growth), aspirate media from cells.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin to plate. Pipette trypsin to detach cells (about 5 minutes).\nMake the appropriate dilutions for experimental conditions and passage an additional 10 cm plate for future experiments at a cell density no less that 0.1 x 106 cells / mL.\nNote: You should passage your cells at least twice after thawing before using them for experiments.\n3. Counting and Plating Cells\nTo plate cells for live-cell imaging, trypsinize as previously described.\nRemove approximately 30 μL of cells and count using a haemocytometer.\nPlace an uncoated glass coverslip in a 6 well plate. Add cells to the well at a density of 0.1 x 106 cells/mL in 2 mL phenol-free DMEM high-glucose media, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 34 °C/5% CO2.\nAllow cells to grow overnight (16-20 h) at 34 °C/5% CO2 before transfection.\n4. Transfection",
    "Combine 100 μL serum-free media, 0.5-4 μg purified plasmid DNA, and 4 μL FuGENE HD (Roche). Vortex gently to mix.\nVortex again briefly and allow the DNA to complex for 5 min at room temperature, and then add FuGENE HD DNA mixture directly to the cultured cells. Tilt the plate gently to mix.\nCulture the cells for an additional 48 h at 34 °C/5% CO2 prior to treatment or experimentation.\n5. Preparing Cells for Live-Cell Imaging (LCI)\nTurn on the LCI Chamlide live-cell instrument control box at least 1 h before you want to start your experiment. The control box also regulates the temperature and humidity within the LCI Chamlide, and regulates the flow of the premixed 5% CO2.\nNote: It is advisable to turn on the control box up to 3 h before beginning experiments to ensure that the entire stage reaches 34 °C. This step will reduce focal drift, which is caused by fluxulation and thermal expansion of the metal stage as it warms, during imaging.\nWorking in a flow-hood, spray the Chamlide magnetic-type culture chamber, and tweezers, with 70% ethanol and allow them to dry for 5 minutes.\nRemove cells from incubator and confirm that they are healthy. They should appear adherent and well-spread on the glass coverslip with numerous membrane processes. Cells that are stressed from transfection are not suitable for experimentation, and will have a reduced number of process extensions, and often have an irregularly-shaped nucleus.\nTilt the 6-well plate and remove the coverslip with tweezers. Quickly place the coverslip cell side up into the bottom plate of the culture chamber. Do not allow the coverslip to dry.",
    "Attach the magnetic main body of the culture chamber and add 500 μL of media from the original 6-well plate onto the top of the coverslip. Re-using this media will decrease the amount of stress placed on the cells caused by environmental changes, and can also be useful for assessing extracellular secreted factors.\nPlace the glass cover on the culture chamber.\nUse a KimWipe sprayed with 70% ethanol to remove any residual material from the bottom of the coverslip, which would interfere with microscopy.\nPlace the culture chamber in the 34 °C/5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. This step will ensure that the chamber itself warms to 34 °C to reduce shifting of the coverslip as the metal warms up.\n6. Microscope Settings\nImages were acquired here using a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope with a custom relay lens and emission filter wheel housing for cartridge loading of multiple wheels (Quorum Technologies Inc., Guelph, ON).\nBrightfield - Lamp set to 2.5 V and exposure time to 240 ms.\nRed Fluorescent Protein (RFP) - Gain set at 140 for 200 ms.\nGreen Fluorescent Protein (GFP) - Gain set at 140 for 500 ms.\nOur microscope has a dimmable lamp rather than a spinning disk to control the amount of light available to cells. We run our experiments with the light at 90% of maximum lamp intensity.\n7. Treatment of Cells with Apoptosis Inducers and NucView 488 Caspase-3 substrate\nIt is important to prepare large stocks of apoptosis inducers ahead of time and freeze them in aliquots, so that the concentrations will be consistent between experiments.",
    "The NucView 488 substrate is light sensitive. Prepare aliquots of 15 μL to reduce freeze/thawing, and store tubes at -20 °C covered in aluminum foil. Work with the ambient room lighting as low as possible to reduce exposure of the NucView 488 substrate to light, prior to its use.\nRetrieve the culture chamber quickly from the incubator so that the cells are not exposed to a reduction in temperature. Place the culture chamber onto the environmental chamber of the microscope, and use clamps to keep the culture chamber from moving. At this point you should also dim the room lights.\nTurn on the 5% premixed CO2 tank with dual regulator.\nUsing the 10x objective, focus to find cells on the computer monitor using bright-field microscopy. Note: you would want to use the largest numerical aperture on the objective with the desired magnification to reduce the exposure time.\nDeliver inducers of apoptosis to the cells (in our case 80 mM potassium, or 100 mM glutamate), one of the following methods can be used. We will use delivery of 80 mM potassium as an example, using KCl dissolved as a 10x concentrate in our typical culture media.\n \nMedia exchange by slow and local perfusion:\n  - Use a peristaltic pump to exchange media in the culture chamber with new media containing 80 mM potassium.\n  - One end of the tubing will deliver 10 mL of a stock of 80 mM potassium dissolved in phenol-free DMEM, and the other end of the tubing will remove media from the chamber.\n  - You want at least a 10x exchange of media to ensure that the media left in the chamber has the correct concentration of potassium.",
    "- After media is exchanged, add 3 μL of NucView 488 substrate to the media in the chamber. Pipette to mix.\nDirect addition of 80 mM K+ and NucView 488 substrate to media in culture chamber:\n  - Prepare a 10x stock solution of 80 mM potassium dissolved in phenol-free DMEM.\n  - Add 3 μL of NucView 488 substrate to 50 μL of 10x 80 mM potassium. Pipette to mix. Add to 500 μL phenol-free DMEM in culture chamber.\nNote: this method is preferred if you are interested in maintaining or assessing growth or other secreted factors that may be present in the original media. We have found that the NucView 488 substrate is stable in cell culture for experiments lasting as long as 36 h.\n8. Live-cell Imaging\nClick on the red channel to display transfected cells.\nSelect and save around a dozen frames where there are several transfected cells, and save these \"X-Y stage points\". Depending on the amount of computer memory, you may be limited to the number of stage points that you will be able to acquire.\nHave the microscope capture images (in bright-field, red channel, and green channel) at these saved stage points every 6 minutes.\nAny green staining that is visible during the early stages of the experiments likely indicates cells that are already undergoing apoptosis, due usually to transfection and/or environmental stress. Apoptosis due to the experimental treatments will be detected at a later timepoint in the experiment.\n9. Statistical Analysis",
    "For each experiment, we program the microscope to acquire multiple X-Y points to gather a large data set efficiently. Each experiment is performed in duplicate or triplicate, and data are compiled from separate experiments performed on different days. From each data set, we analyze up to 15 fields of view and compare the ratio of caspase-negative cells to caspase-positive cells (total number of cells in field of view/total number of caspase-positive cells).\nThe recorded measurements from each data set are grouped into a larger sample set, and are then compared to one another using an ANOVA table (p = 0.05). We show the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of each experiment, and then compare the difference in means by performing a Tukey means comparison test (p = 0.05) to determine which treatments are significantly different from each other.\n10. Representative Results",
    "We have described an experiment to illustrate how the NucView 488 substrate can indicate an increased rate of apoptosis of N19-OLG cell cultures following a treatment with a high extracellular potassium concentration. The N19-cells were transfected with RFP, and were either treated with 3 μL NucView 488 substrate (control), or 3 μL NucView 488 substrate and 80 mM [K+] (treatment). Cells were monitored and images were acquired over a 12 h time course, which is adequate for studies involving neurological insults (Figure 1A). In control conditions, we did not observe significant amounts of apoptosis compared to the 80 mM [K+] treated cultures (hashed box), which showed approximately 45% cell death after 12 h (Figure 1B). The background green signal observed in the control conditions indicates the cells that are undergoing apoptosis without the addition of extracellular potassium. Virtually none of the cells in the control experiment exhibit apoptosis by the 12 h time point, although in other situations the experiments may be required to run longer. Images were acquired using a 10x objective. Bar = 100 μm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3422/3422fig1.jpg",
