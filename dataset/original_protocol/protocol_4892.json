    "Tumor injectionCollect LLC-RFP tumor cells at about 70-80% confluency grown in a cell culture flask. Wash with DPBS two times and then gently trypsinize cells for approximately 3-5 min. We find that the greatest amount of reproducibility with tumors that are 70-80% confluent and highly viable (> 95%) when collected for injection. Note: If there is any question of tumor cell viability, test for viability by trypan blue staining or other method after tumor cell collection. Resuspend cells in DPBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g. Repeat DPBS wash.Count cells and confirm high viability (> 95%), then resuspend cells in DPBS at 3 x 106 cells/ml.Intravenously inject (in tail vein) 3 x 105 Lewis lung carcinoma cells expressing red fluorescent protein (LLC-RFP) or other fluorescent-tagged tumor cell line resuspended in 100 μl of DPBS into the tail vein using a 30 gauge syringe. Mouse imagingInject mouse intraperitoneally with an initial dose of 90 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 15 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride in 0.5 ml of PBS to anesthetize mouse. Maintain anesthesia during image acquisition with one-half dose subcutaneously boosting every 45 min for up to 3 h. Placed mouse in the supine position on a heated microscope stage to achieve a rectal temperature of 37 °C. Once adequate anesthesia is induced (tested by paw pinch), expose the trachea and separate from the surrounding connective tissue. Cut a small opening in the anterior trachea parallel to the cartilaginous rings, and insert PE-90 tubing trimmed at a 45 degree angle into the trachea toward the lungs. Secure the tubing and close the skin around the trachea with Vetbond glue and connect to the mechanical ventilator.",
    "Apply a tidal volume of 8 to 10 μl/g body weight (room air or higher fractions of oxygen) with respiratory rates of approximately 120 breaths per min. This is the approximate normal breathing rate of an average size adult mouse (25-30 g). Reassess depth of anesthesia with a paw pinch. Dab mouse lightly with 70% ethanol around left rib cage and remove skin to expose ribs. Gently insert scissors between the two lowest ribs and cut a 0.5 cm hole into the thoracic cavity. Pull up second rib above hole with tweezers and then pipette approximately 300 μl of PBS into hole to help drop left lobe of the lung from the rib cage. Continue applying upward pressure on the ribcage with tweezers in order to keep the lung away from the ribs and prevent lung damage while removing ribs. Carefully remove approximately 1.5 cm of the three anterior ribs overlying the left lung lobe as shown in Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012014056_5138.jpgFigure 1. Images of exposure of left lobe of lung as described in step B9Apply a thin layer of high vacuum grease around the inner edge of the vacuum ring and then apply a 12-mm glass coverslip sealed with high vacuum grease to the vacuum suction ring. Apply 20 to 25 mmHg vacuum suction to the ring using a dedicated vacuum line attached to pressure gauge and regulator to adjust pressure.  Carefully lower thoracic suction window onto the flat surface of the left lung lobe, which will then enter the thoracic window and be stabilized for imaging as shown in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012014158_1339.jpgFigure 2. Image of suction window on left lobe of the lung Add ~200 μl DPBS to slideglass, engage microscope lens on imaging ring as shown in Figure 3, and acquire imaging as necessary.",
    "Confirm normal blood flow in lung by imaging to ensure that the ring has not caused vascular damage/blocking. Focusing on imaging an area that is fairly stabilized by the vacuum ring to prevent motion artifact and distortion of the images by pulsing of the lung. Representative lung imaging is shown in Video 1 and Video 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012014344_5885.jpgFigure 3.
