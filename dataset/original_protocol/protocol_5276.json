    "CRISPR target selection for creating gene knock-outs of interestObtain the coding sequence (CDS) of the gene of interest from an appropriate database. We use Phytozome from JGI (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#[href=https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#]) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602025043_3556.jpgFigure 1. Main page of Phytozome: The plant genome database. The coding sequence information of each gene can be obtained from Phytozome database.For target design, we use CRISPR RGEN tools (http://www.rgenome.net/[href=http://www.rgenome.net/]), a web-based set of tools for CRISPR target design and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602025344_7187.jpgFigure 2. Main page of CRISPR RGEN Tools. A web-based set of tools which provides all required tools from CRISPR target design to NGS data analysis.In Cas-Designer, select the type of CRISPR endonuclease, such as SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, and the target genome, in this case that of the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Cas-Designer now contains the versions 4 and 5 of it at ‘Plants’ organism type on our website. Then insert the CDS of the gene of interest in the ‘Target Sequence’ box. We recommend choosing target sites within the first half of the full CDS to increase the probability of generating complete knock-out mutations (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602025729_4147.jpgFigure 3. Overview of Cas-Designer. Users can select various types of CRISPR endonucleases and the target genome including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (versions 4 or 5).Choose several targets among the candidates from Cas-Designer. You should avoid targets that are associated with potential off-target sites bearing 1-2 mismatches compared to the on-target. Targets with GC content ranging from 30 to 70% and higher out-of-frame scores are recommended (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602030446_1310.jpgFigure 4. An example data of an output table from Cas-Designer. Cas-Designer shows possible CRISPR target sites from input sequences along with useful information such as GC content, out-of-frame score, and off-target information. Note: N/A means ‘not applicable’ due to the lack of flanking DNA nucleotides.",
    "Purification of recombinant Cas9 proteinTransform 50 μl competent BL21-Pro cells with a pET28 vector containing 6xHis-SpCas9.Spread the cells on an agar plate containing kanamycin. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.Inoculate 10 ml LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin in a conical tube with a single colony from the plate. Grow to saturation overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.The next morning, inoculate 200 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin in a flask with 2 ml saturated overnight culture.Grow the cells at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm to mid-log phase (to an OD600 of approximately 0.4-0.5).Add 160 μl of 1 M IPTG (0.8 mM final concentration) and incubate the cells overnight at 18 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.Transfer the culture to a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and pellet the cells by centrifuging for 20 min at 3,000 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and repeat the harvest in the same tube.Re-suspend the cell pellets in 10 ml lysis buffer (see Recipes). Add 20 mg lysozyme and 100 μl of 100 mM PMSF (1 mM final concentration).Incubate 1 h on ice.Sonicate the cells in a conical tube on ice (amplitude 25%, 1 sec ON/1 sec OFF, pulse 30 times). Repeat the sonication process 5 times.Transfer the sonicated cells to a 1.5 ml microtube using micropipette and pellet debris by centrifuging at 4 °C, 11,000 x g for 30 min.Filter the supernatant through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and collect it in a 50 ml conical tube.Add 2 ml Ni-NTA agarose to the lysate. Swirl agarose beads before adding. Incubate for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C.Transfer the mixture to a chromatography column with pipette. Collect the flow-through in a conical tube.Wash the column with 10 ml wash buffer (see Recipes).",
    "Collect this first batch of wash buffer in a conical tube.Repeat the wash. Collect the second batch of wash buffer in a conical tube.Elute the bound protein with 10 ml elution buffer (see Recipes). Collect the eluate in 1 ml sequential aliquots in 10 microtubes.Using a Bradford assay, determine the protein concentration in each fraction.Apply the eluate that contains the fusion protein to a protein concentrator (100K MWCO).Centrifuge at 4 °C, 3,000 x g until the sample volume is reduced by 90%.Apply 4 ml protein storage buffer (see Recipes) and centrifuge at 4 °C, 3,000 x g, until the volume is reduced by 90%.Elute the protein on the filter with 300 μl protein storage buffer. Measure the protein concentration through Bradford assay with standard BSA in the spectrophotometer (the final concentration of SpCas9 should be approximately ~10 mg/ml).Notes: Identify which samples from each step contain the fusion protein by SDS-PAGE.You should verify the activity of Cas9 protein using an in vitro cleavage assay.In vitro transcription of sgRNATemplate extensionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170604/20170604192336_2537.jpgAfter template extension, purify DNA using a PCR purification kit.Note: Purified DNA template can be stored at -20 °C.Table 3.

Transfection of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to ChlamydomonasPreparation of cells and RNP complex for transformationCultivate the Chlamydomonas cells mixotrophically (in the light with acetate) in 50 ml liquid TAP medium at 25 °C under continuous light (50-70 μmol photons m-2 sec-1) in a 100 ml flask with shaking at 90 rpm until the cell density reaches an OD750 of 0.3-0.5 as measured by a spectrophotometer.Estimate the cell density with a hemocytometer and microscope.Harvest 5 x 105 cells by centrifugation in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (2,000 x g, 3 min, room temperature), discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 250 μl of TAP sucrose solution (see Recipes) by gently pipetting (prepare one aliquot of cells per transformation reaction).To prepare the RNP complex, premix purified Cas9 protein (200 μg) with in vitro transcribed sgRNA (140 μg) in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (prepare one aliquot of RNP complexes per transformation reaction).Add the RNP complex to the resuspended cells and gently tap the tube.Transfer 250 μl (+ volume of the RNP complex) of the transformation mixture to an electroporation cuvette.Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Electroporation of RNP complexSet parameters in the electroporation device (Bio-Rad Laboratories) (voltage: 600 V, capacity: 50 μF, resistance: infinity).",
    "Gently tap the cuvette to mix the contents and place the cuvette in the cuvette chamber.Electroporate the cells and then resuspend them by gently pipetting in 750 μl of TAP sucrose solution (total volume, 1 ml). Transfer all of the transformation mixture into a 15 ml conical tube.To obtain single mutant colonies, immediately transfer 2-4 x 103 cells (4-6 μl) from the transformation mixture to a new 15 ml conical tube and then plate them on a 1.5% TAP agar plate (see Recipes) using top agar (see Recipes). After transformation, 400-600 colonies generally appear (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170603/20170603000307_8298.jpgFigure 5. Visual coloration examination to investigate CpFTSY gene knockout. Red circles indicate the putative CpFTSY knockout mutant lines which have pale green colors grown on TAP agar medium.Incubate the rest of the cells for 12 h in dim light (5-10 μmol photons m-2 sec-1), after which they should be harvested for genomic DNA extraction for use in targeted deep-sequencing analysis.Preparation of NGS library using PCRDeep sequencing library preparation by PCR amplification(Optional) Target gene (~cleavage site ± 250 bp) amplification For successful library construction, we recommend amplifying the target gene, which should include the cleavage site ± 250 bp, first. We use Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo).Pre-indexing PCR (~25 cycles)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170604/20170604192435_4545.jpgFor paired-end sequencing, the DNA library must have two adapters that include the i5 and i7 indices. Amplify the target DNA using Phusion polymerase with the pre-index tailed primers.Note: We recommend that the length of the target DNA be ~250 bp for Miseq 300 cycles or ~450 bp for Miseq 500 cycles for optimal merging of the paired-end reads. Indexing PCR (~25 cycles)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170604/20170604192520_5165.jpgAfter the pre-indexed amplification, amplify the PCR products with universal index primers. Purify the amplicons using a PCR DNA purification kit and measure the concentration of library using a spectrophotometer.",
