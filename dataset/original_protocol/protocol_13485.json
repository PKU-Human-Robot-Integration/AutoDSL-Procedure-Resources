    "The experiments in this protocol were approved by the State and Institutional Animal Care Committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, Germany; approval no. G20-1-135). The experiments were conducted following the ARRIVE guidelines. Overall, 10 anesthetized male pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) with a mean weight of 30 kg ± 2 kg and 12-16 weeks in age were used for the present study.\n1. Animal preparation\nMaintain a normal environment for the animals to minimize stress. Withhold food 6 h before the scheduled experiment to lower the risk of aspiration, but allow access to water.\nSedate the pigs with a combined injection of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and azaperone (2-3 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials) in the gluteal muscle or neck with a needle (20 G) for intramuscular injection. Leave the animals undisturbed until sedation sets in (15-20 min).\n\tNOTE: Depending on national regulations, the administration of sedating agents may be subject to scrutiny and may or may not require the supervision of a trained veterinarian. Consult with the local authorities before planning the experiments.\nTransport the sedated animals from the stables to the laboratory. The transport time must not exceed adequate sedation time (here, 30-60 min). Ensure sufficient heat retention so that the animal does not get hypothermic (i.e., below 38 °C), such as by covering the body with a blanket depending on the outside temperature.\nUsing a sensor (see Table of Materials) clipped to the ear or tail, monitor the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2).\nDisinfect the skin with a disinfectant (alcoholic) before inserting a peripheral vein cannula (22 G) into an ear vein. Spray the area, wipe once, then spray again, and allow the disinfectant to dry. Secure the ear cannula with a band-aid (See Table of Materials).\n2. Anesthesia and mechanical ventilation",
    "Administer analgesia through an intravenous injection of 4 µg/kg of fentanyl. Induce anesthesia with an intravenous injection of 3 mg/kg of propofol (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Due to the bolus application, the drug quickly floods into the active compartment, providing a fast onset of deep anesthesia.\nPlace the pig on a stretcher in a supine position and fix it with bandages. Apply muscle relaxant through an intravenous injection of 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium (see Table of Materials).\nInstantaneously start noninvasive ventilation via a dog ventilation mask (see Table of Materials) or similar models. To ensure a tight fit of the mask, place the thenar eminence and the thumbs of both hands on top of the mask while performing jaw thrust with the remaining fingers.\n\tNOTE: Ventilation parameters: FiO2 (inspiratory oxygen fraction) = 100%, peak inspiratory pressure = <20 cmH20, respiratory rate = 18-20 breaths/min, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) = 5 cmH20.\nMaintain anesthesia through continuous infusion of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/h of fentanyl and 8-12 mg/kg/h of propofol. Start infusing with 5 mL/kg/h of balanced electrolyte solution (see Table of Materials) continuously. Constantly maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia.\n\t​NOTE: Surrogate parameters for this are the absence of movement, the lack of own respiratory efforts after intubation, and the absence of a sudden increase in heart rate. If possible, avoid permanent muscle relaxation to enable motor reactions as a sign of insufficient depth of anesthesia.\n3. Endotracheal intubation\nHave an assistant stand on the left side of the head. Have the assistant's left hand open the mouth and pinch the tongue outward and left with a compress. Ask the assistant to press down on the right upper lip with the right index finger to provide a better mouth opening.",
    "Perform direct laryngoscopy. To do this, insert the laryngoscope (see Table of Materials) into the right side of the mouth and push it forward while pushing the tongue to the left. Advance the tip of the laryngoscope until it rests in the epiglottic vallecula.\n\tNOTE: The epiglottis usually obscures the glottis by sticking to the soft palate.\nCarefully push the epiglottis aside with a tube guiding wire (see Table of Materials) with a gentle scooping motion from the right piriform recess to the left along the soft palate.\nPass the handle of the laryngoscope to the assistant to fix it in the current position.\nNow, take the flexible intubation endoscope onto which an endotracheal tube has already been mounted and that is connected to a video monitor. Insert the endoscope orally and advance it over the base of the tongue until the glottis is visualized.\n\tNOTE: To avoid fogging of the camera, the prior application of anti-fogging agents (see Table of Materials) is recommended.\nAdvance the endoscope between the vocal ligaments into the trachea. Confirm the anatomy of the trachea by visually identifying the cartilaginous rings and the pars membranacea. Advance the endoscope until it rests above the carina. Try not to touch the sensitive mucosa with the tip of the endoscope to avoid swelling and bleeding.\nWhile maintaining the position of the endoscope, advance the endotracheal tube until it becomes visible in the camera image.",
    "NOTE: If the endotracheal tube cannot be advanced through the glottic plane, there is a possibility that it has become caught on the arytenoid cartilage. In this case, the endotracheal tube must be withdrawn 1 cm and rotated by 90° before gently advancing again. If necessary, this maneuver can be repeated. Similar calibers of flexible intubation endoscope and endotracheal tube can minimize the risk of this issue occurring. If the endotracheal tube cannot be advanced despite this maneuver, it is likely that the subglottic narrowness-the narrowest part of the porcine larynx-cannot be passed. In this case, a smaller endotracheal tube size needs to be selected. Regular commercially available endotracheal tubes in sizes 6.5 cm or 7.0 cm ID should be able to pass the glottis as long as no anatomic abnormalities are present. Endotracheal tube size requirements vary depending on the piglet size and breed.\nWithdraw the flexible intubation endoscope while maintaining the position of the endotracheal tube.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe, inflate the cuff with 10 mL of air. Control the cuff pressure with a cuff manager (target value: 30 cmH2O, see Table of Materials).\nConfirm the correct placement of the endotracheal tube and adequate ventilation by periodic and regular exhalation of carbon dioxide via capnography24 and double-sided ventilation via auscultation15.\nStart mechanical ventilation after connecting the tube with a ventilator (PEEP = 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate = variable to achieve an end-tidal CO2 of <6 kPa, usually 30-50 min−1, FiO2 = 0.4, I:E (inspiration to expiration ratio) = 1:2, tidal volume = 6-8 mL/kg).\nExpand the monitoring (e.g., the establishment of an intra-arterial blood pressure measurement, the installation of a central venous or pulmonary arterial catheter27) or continue with the intervention.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the question of the further experiments, define limit values for the vital parameters and intervention options and establish the monitoring accordingly in the study protocol.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
