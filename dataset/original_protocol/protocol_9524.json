    "1. Transfection of Adherent HEK293S GnTI- Cells for Thermostability Screen\nPrepare Poly-D-Lysine (PDL)-coated 96-well plates. Perform all work in a sterile laminar flow hood.\n\t\nFilter a 25 µg/mL solution of (PDL), molecular weight 70,000-150,000 Da, using a 0.2 µm sterile filter. Add 50 µL of PDL to each well of a 96-well Tissue Culture (TC) plate, ensuring the bottom is evenly coated, and incubate at RT for 30 min.\nAspirate PDL solution and wash with 200 µL of sterile water.\nAllow plate to air dry for 2 h prior to storage at 4 °C. PDL coated plates can be stored at 4 °C for several weeks.\nTrypsinization of adherent HEK293S cells.\n\t\nGrow HEK293S to 80% confluency in a 10 cm dish maintained at 37 °C with 8% CO2. A single 10 cm dish should have approximately 10 million HEK293S cells. Do not use cells after 30 passages!\nAspirate media and wash with 5 mL of Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS). Add 1 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) to cells and incubate for 2 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and resuspend cells by repeatedly pipetting up and down using a serological pipette.\nPipette 10 µL of cells and mix with 10 µL of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%). Determine cell density using a hemocytometer and a light microscope. Do not count cells that are stained blue as they are dead. Ensure that cell viability is above 90%.",
    "Thoroughly resuspend trypsinized HEK293S GnTI- cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to a density of 0.5 x 106 cells/mL in a disposable pipette reservoir. Approximately 5 million HEK293S cells will be needed for each plate. A total of 24 constructs can be transfected on each plate using this protocol.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 100 µL of cells to each well of a PDL coated plate. Resuspend cells in the pipette reservoir after filling each plate to ensure an even distribution of cells. Incubate cells in a 37 °C incubator with 8% CO2. After 24 h, cells should reach approximately 80% confluency.\n1 h prior to transfection replace media. Prepare DNA-transfection reagent complexes for transfection.\n\t\nFor each construct in the SERTTC background to be screened, mix 450 ng DNA with 45 µL of serum-free DMEM and mix. Add 1.6 µL of the transfection reagent to 45 µL of serum-free DMEM and mix.\nImmediately add diluted transfection reagent solution to DNA solution and mix. Do not mix solutions in the reverse order. Wait 10 - 15 min and add 20 µL of transfection reagent/DNA mixture to 4 wells.\nOnce all wells have been transfected, mix plate by gently rocking back and forth and return to the 37 °C incubator.\nAfter 16 - 24 h replace media with DMEM containing serum and 10 mM sodium butyrate.\nApproximately 48 h post transfection remove media and either immediately proceed with thermostability screen or freeze cells at -80 °C to be used later. Cells can be stored at -80 °C for several weeks.\n2. Scintillation Proximity-based Thermostability Screen with S-citalopram\nIncubate cells with 200 nM S-citalopram in 25 µL of TBS (Tris-Buffered Saline — 20 mM Tris, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl) for 5 min at RT.",
    "Solubilize cells by adding 25 µL of 8 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (C12M), 1 mM cholesteryl hemmisuccinate (CHS), protease inhibitor cocktail (2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mg/mL aprotinin, 4 g/mL pepstatin A, and 4 µg/mL leupeptin) in TBS, and incubating for 1 h at RT.\nAdd 50 µL of TBS with 20 nM [3H]citalopram (81.7 Ci/mmol), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mg/mL His-tag affinity scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads to three wells for each construct. For the last well add the same solution listed but supplement with 100 µM sertraline to determine nonspecific binding. Ensure that His-tag affinity SPA beads are thoroughly mixed when adding to the 96-well plate.\nMeasure [3H]citalopram binding using a 96-well scintillation counter at RT with a 1 min count time per well. Continue counting plates until total counts plateau (approximately after 36 h).\nHeat plates for 15 min in a heating block with a heated lid at 33 °C. Measure [3H]citalopram binding again after heating as described in 2.4.\nRepeat step 2.4 - 2.5 and change the heating step to 36 °C, 39 °C, 45 °C, 48 °C, and 51 °C. Adjust heating temperatures depending on the apparent melting temperature (Tm) of the target protein and the thermostability of the most stable construct. Continue to heat plates until all constructs have low specific counts.\nAnalyze data to determine Tm values.\n\t\nDetermine the average total counts per min (CPM) of each construct for wells that do not contain sertraline by averaging the 3 replicate wells. Determine the nonspecific CPM by averaging the CPM of each well containing sertraline in a single plate.\nCalculate specific CPM by subtracting the nonspecific CPM from the total CPM.",
    "Calculate the Tm by a non-linear fit to a Boltzmann sigmoidal function. Constructs with low specific CPM at RT (<10% of WT) generally do not have accurate Tm values. Mutations from the most thermostable constructs can be combined together and screened for additive increases in thermostability.\n3. Expression of the Human Serotonin Transporter in HEK293S GnTI- Cells\nTransform chemically competent DH10Bac cells with 1 ng of plasmid.\n\t\nAdd plasmid to 50 µL of DH10Bac cells and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock DH10Bac cells at 42 °C for 30 sec. Add 200 µL of SOC medium and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h with shaking.\nPlate all of the bacteria onto a Luria Broth (LB) plate containing 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 7 µg/mL gentamicin, 10 µg/mL tetracycline, 100 µg/mL 5-bromo-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside, and 40 µg/mL isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).\nIsolate lacZ- colonies (white colonies) grown at 37 °C for 2 d on LB agar plates.\nGrow several colonies O/N at 37 °C in 5 mL of LB containing antibiotics and isolate bacmid DNA.\n\t\nSpin down bacteria at 1,000 x g in a centrifuge for 5 min.

Discard cell pellet. Determine viral density using a viral plaque assay or a virus counter. The virus density should be >1 x 108 virus particles per milliliter. P2 virus can be stored at 4 °C in the dark and used for several months.",

Sf9 media is more acidic than the 293 expression media.\n12 - 16 h post-infection, add sodium butyrate to a concentration of 10 mM from a 1 M stock. 48 - 60 h post-infection, harvest cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 15 min. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 150 mL of TBS, 2 µM S-citalopram or other SERT inhibitors and store at -80 °C until ready for purification.\n4.

Incubate in buffer for 10 min.\nFreeze the lipid by placing the flask in liquid N2.",
    "Thaw. Immerse spherical bottom of the flask in a beaker filled with warm water, approximately 30 °C. Sonicate in a bath sonicator for 5 min.\nVortex and repeat steps 5.1.3 - 5.1.4 10 times or until the lipid is completely resuspended from the bottom and forms a cloudy suspension.\nExtrude the entire lipid mixture twice through 200 nm filters. The lipid will appear as a milky suspension prior to extrusion; afterward it will be translucent. Do not add the entire lipid mixture to the extruder at once as it can become clogged, resulting in loss of sample.\nSpin lipids at 100,000 x g for 20 min and resuspend in 0.5 - 1 mL of TBS at a concentration of 40 mg/mL.\nConcentrate purified SERTIC to 250 - 500 µL using a 100 kDa MWCO centrifuge protein concentrator to 2 - 4 mg/mL and saturate liposomes with 5 mM C12M.

Proteoliposomes can be stored at -80 °C in aliquots for long term storage and thawed on ice prior to each immunization.\n6. Screening for Antibodies Recognizing 3D Epitopes\nScreen hybridoma cell lines by western blot. Antibodies which recognize SERT by western blot likely bind linear epitopes and will likely not be useful for structural studies.\n\t\nMix 1 µg of purified SERTIC or SERTCC and run on a 4 - 15% SDS-PAGE gel at 200 V for 1 h.\nTransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane at 200 mA for 30 min using Towbin buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.1% SDS).

Antibodies which form complexes will cause the GFP-fusion protein to elute earlier than the free transporter from the size-exclusion column.\nDilute complexes to 10, 1, 0.1 nM in 200 µL TBS with 1 mM C12M, 0.2 mM CHS, and 1 µM S-citalopram and rerun FSEC. Antibodies which can still shift the transporter peak at low nanomolar concentrations are high affinity binders and good candidates for structural studies.\nRetest binding by FSEC in the presence of 1 mM serotonin. Antibodies which specifically recognize the SSRI bound conformation will not bind in the presence of the substrate. Antibodies which recognize a 3D epitope which does not change as a result of conformation will bind regardless of the ligand present.\nMix pairwise different combinations of antibodies and test binding by FSEC. Antibodies which recognize distinct epitopes will cause SERT to elute earlier when combined together compared to binding of a single antibody.\nFor initial structural studies, select the highest affinity antibodies which recognize 3D epitopes.\n7.
