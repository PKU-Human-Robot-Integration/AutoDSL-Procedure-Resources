    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: The steps below are only for the protocols we modified from the manufacturer's suggestion.\nCulturing patient-derived fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines\nThe acquisition of patient samples is not always easy, particularly in the case of children who have already been subjected to multiple stressful tests. The patient’s clinician is in the best position to speak to the patient to see if they are willing to provide biological samples. Even so, we were able to procure fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cell lines from only three unrelated patients carrying a single de novo variant in PUM1 in addition to three age- and sex-matched healthy controls.\nNote: The informed consent from the patient is always needed. If the sample derives from a third party such as a biobank and the subject is de-identified, it is likely that the consent form was already acquired by the third party. Regulations can differ between countries and institutions, so we recommend that you procure Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval before attempting to work with human specimens or clinical data.\nCulturing patient-derived cell lines from frozen vials\nTiming: 1 h\nNote: Primary patient-derived cell lines can arrive either in frozen vials or in their culturing medium. To increase the chances of cell survival, we strongly suggest you re-culture the cells, as soon as you receive them, with fresh culturing medium.\nNote: Fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells are cultured at 37°C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2.\nThaw the cells by placing the vial in a water bath set at 37°C for 2–5 min.\nTransfer the contents of the vial to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of warm (∼37°C) complete culturing medium.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min to obtain a pellet of cells.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nAdd 10 mL of warm (∼37°C) complete medium and gently resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer 10 mL of complete medium containing the cells to a T25 flask or 10 cm cell culture- treated dish.\nNote: Since lymphoblastoid cells grow as suspension, we recommend using T25 flasks.\nThe next day replace the medium with fresh complete medium.\nCulturing patient-derived cell lines from cells in culture\nAspirate the medium and add 10 mL of warm (∼37°C) fresh complete medium.\nReplace the medium the next day with fresh medium.\nCritical: Primary patient-derived cell lines are a precious resource and asking for new cells is usually not feasible. Therefore, before using the cells for any experiments, we recommend you expand the cells to have good number of vials as backup in liquid nitrogen for long storage. Having a backup will enable you to maintain the cells in low passage number (many experiments in human cells work better this way).\nExpanding fibroblast cell lines\nTiming: 15 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1503_9.csv\nOnce the fibroblasts are at 85%–90% of plate confluency: Aspirate the medium from the plate, trying to avoid disturbing the cells.\nAdd 5 mL of phosphate buffer (PBS) 1× to rinse the remaining medium from the plate.\nAdd 1 mL of warm (∼37°C) Trypsin-EDTA 1× to the center of the plate.\nNote: make sure the Trypsin-EDTA 1× contacts the entire plate surface.\nPlace the plate in the incubator for 5 min.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, mechanically detach the cells.\nAdd 4 mL of fibroblast culturing medium.\nTransfer the volume in a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio to a new 10 cm cell culture treated dish.",
    "Critical: Fibroblasts grow as a monolayer and should be re-fed with fresh medium or split every 3–4 days at a ratio of 1:4 or 1:5, depending on how fast the lineage grows.\nExpanding lymphoblastoid cell lines\nTiming: 15 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1503_10.csv\nNote: After 3–4 days from the thawing, the cells should be sub-cultured. The culturing plateau level for lymphoblastoid cells is 1 × 106 cells/mL; at this confluency the medium will be acidic and the phenol red used as pH indicator will turn yellow.\nPipette up and down for 5 times using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nTransfer the cells in a new 50 mL conical.\nTake 10 μl of the volume and count the cells.\nSeed 200,000–300,000 cells/mL in a new T25 flask.\nCritical: Lymphoblastoid cells grow in suspension with cells clumped in aggregates. They should be seeded at a concentration of 200,000–300,000 cells/mL and need subculture every 3–4 days.\nmRNA extraction and quantification from patient-derived cell lines\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTo extract total RNA from human patient or control fibroblast cell lines, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and harvested at 80% confluency (1 × 106 cells), whereas lymphoblastoid cell suspension cultures were collected at 6 × 106 confluence before proceeding for RNA extraction. Total RNA was obtained using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).\nCritical: RNA is subject to degradation; even our hands contain RNase. It is therefore imperative to work in a clean environment: clean the work surface and the pipettes with RNase decontamination solutions such as RNaseZap, use only filtered pipette tips, clean your gloves with 70% alcohol after you put them on.",
    "Critical: QIAzol Lysis Reagent is a monophasic solution that consists of phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. Since phenol is toxic, the QIAzol solution should be handled with caution and always under a chemical fume hood. Laboratories working with phenol should use polyethylene glycol 300 or 400 (PEG-300 or PEG-400), rather than water, for immediate first aid treatment of dermal exposures. In addition, anyone using phenol should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including lab coat and nitrile gloves. If QIAzol contacts the gloves, it will penetrate the material within a couple of minutes, so immediately change your gloves. Similar precautions should be followed when working with chloroform.\nAdd 700 μL QIAzol Lysis Reagent to the cell pellet in a 1.7 mL tube and lyse the cells by pipetting rather vigorously, around 20 times up and down using a p200 pipette set at 200 μL.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 140 μL of chloroform (for each 700 μL of QIAzol) to the mix and shake vigorously for 15 s.\nIncubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate for 15 min, 12,000 g at 4°C. It is not necessary to use low brake for this step.\nCarefully transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new collection tube and add 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. The phases should not be mixed.\nNote: If you accidentally mix or disturb the phases, you must repeat from step 25.\nCritical: Perform steps 21–26 under chemical fume hood.\nLoad up to 700 μL of sample into a RNeasy Mini column placed in a 2 mL collection tube.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 15 s at room temperature, discarding the flow-through.\nAdd 350 μL buffer RWT to the RNAeasy Mini column and spin for 15 s at 11,000 rpm.\nDiscard the flow-through.",
    "Add 10 μL DNAseI stock solution to 70 μL buffer RDD for each sample, mix gently by inverting the tube and spin briefly.\nAdd 80 μL of DNAseI reaction directly on the RNAeasy Mini column filter.\nIncubate 15 min at RT.\nAdd 350 μL buffer RWT to the RNeasy spin column and centrifuge 15 s at 11,000 rpm.\nNote: The DNAseI treatment purifies the RNA solution from genomic DNA contaminants. This treatment is optional, but we strongly recommend it if you plan to do qPCR; if you do not perform qPCR, you can skip steps 31–33.\nAdd 700 μL of RWT buffer to wash the column.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 30 s, discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μL of RPE wash buffer into the RNAeasy Mini column.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 30 s, discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μL of RPE wash buffer into the RNAeasy Mini column.\nCentrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 2 min.\nPlace the RNeasy Mini column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube and centrifuge at full speed for 1 min.\nTransfer the RNeasy Mini column to a new 1.5 mL collection tube.\nAdd pre-warmed (60°C) 30–50 μL RNease free water, directly into the column membrane.\nAfter 5 min of incubation centrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 1 min.\nQuantify RNA using NanoDrop 1000.\nRNA can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for a longer preservation.\nNote: Freezing and thawing the RNA could cause degradation. We recommend dividing the extracted RNA into small aliquots that can be thawed when needed.\nRNA quality assessment",
    "Note: RNA quality can be assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE running buffer. The RNA quality assessment through the electrophoresis gives a different information compared to the information given by the 260/280 and 260/230 absorbance ratios. From the electrophoresis the operator will be able to see an overall RNA degradation. This information cannot be obtained from the 260/280 or 260/230 ratio since these analyses will measure protein and DNA contamination, respectively, regardless if the RNA is degraded or not.\nCritical: Prepare a 3× bromophenol blue loading dye by diluting the commercial 6× loading dye 1:1 in formamide. Rinse the gel chamber and the comb once with NaOH 0.4N and four to five times with abundant deionized water; let them dry before using them.\nNote: 150 ng to 1 μg of total RNA can be loaded on the agarose gel. 1 μg of RNA, when possible, will give you a better resolution.\nMix 3 μL of 3× formamide bromophenol blue loading dye with 1 μg of the extracted RNA and bring the mix volume up to 9 μL with nuclease-free water in order to obtain a 1× loading dye solution.\nMix gently without vortexing.\nSpin down quickly and incubate at 60°C for 10 min.\nPlace on ice for 2 min.\nLoad 9 μL of RNA/dye solution on the 1% agarose TAE gel.\nRun the gel at low speed until the loading blue runs over half of the gel.\nImage the gel in a UV transilluminator. If the RNA quality is optimal, three bands will be visible corresponding to rRNA 28S, 18S, and 5-5.8S. If the RNA degrades, you will see a smear between those three bands (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1503-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Agarose gel for RNA quality assessment\nRepresentative image of agarose gel showing two RNA samples.",
    "The three bands are the rRNA 28S, 18S and 5/5.8S.\nNote: Alternatively, the quality of the RNA can be assessed using the Bioanalyzer System which performs a microfluidic-based resolution automated electrophoresis. This system can provide information on both RNA integrity and quality.\ncDNA synthesis\nTiming: 1 h\nThaw gDNA wipeout buffer, Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, Quantiscript RT Buffer, RT Primer Mix, and RNase-free water on ice. Mix each solution by flicking the tubes. Centrifuge briefly to collect residual liquid from the sides of the tubes, and then store on ice.\nNote: The QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit can retrotranscribe up to 1 μg of RNA (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nThaw previously frozen RNA on ice.\nPrepare the genomic DNA elimination reaction on ice, adding 2 μL of gDNA wipeout buffer to a tube containing 1 μg of RNA. Bring the volume up to 12 μL with nuclease-free water.\nIncubate for 8 min at 42°C. Then place immediately on ice.\nCritical: Do not incubate at 42°C for longer than 10 min.\nAdd to each reaction tube 1 μL of RT Primer Mix, 4 μL of Quantiscript RT Buffer and 1 μL of Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase.\nIncubate for 30 min at 42°C.\nIncubate for 3 min at 95°C to inactivate Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase.\nStore the cDNA at 4°C for short term storage or at −20°C for long term storage.\nQuantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)",
    "In order to quantify mRNA level changes between the patient-derived cells and the control cell lines, perform quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In our original study (Gennarino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we used the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System with PowerUP SYBR Green Master Mix to analyze PUM1, ATXN1 and E2F3 (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Results were analyzed using the comparative Ct method normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Vandesompele et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To ensure the efficacy of genomic DNA elimination, we ran negative control samples in the qRT-PCR that did not have reverse transcriptase (minus-RT) in the cDNA synthesis reaction.\nProtein extraction and quantification in patient-derived cell lines\nTiming: 2 days\nTo measure PUM1 quantities in patient-derived cells lines, we first tested different antibodies to find the one that gave the best signal with the lowest background. Since patient-derived cell lines are highly variable, we recommend repeating the experiment no less than 6–9 times after proper optimization.\nCritical: Patient-derived cell lines need to be compared with healthy donor cell lines that must be matched according to cell type, sex, and age. Again, given the variability of primary human cells, we suggest using at least 2 to 3 healthy donors as control comparisons for each patient-derived cell line.\nAspirate the medium from the plate without disturbing the cells.\nAdd 5 mL of phosphate buffer (PBS) 1× to rinse the plate from the remaining medium.\nAdd 1 mL of warm (∼37°C) Trypsin-EDTA 1×.\nPlace the plate in the incubator for 5 min.\nUsing a P-1000 pipette, mechanically detach the cells by pipetting up and down.\nAdd 4 mL of fibroblast culturing medium.\nTransfer the cells in a 15 mL conical and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the medium without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Add 300 μL of cold RIPA buffer completed with phosphatase and protease inhibitors 1×.\nUsing a P-1000 pipette dissolve the pellet pipetting up and down for 10–15 times.\nTransfer the 300 μL of lysate in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPlace the tube in ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge for 20 min at 21,000 g at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant in a new 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube and place it in ice.\nQuantify the protein concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nNote: To evaluate the protein concentration with this method, prepare a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve with 2 μg/μL, 1 μg/μL, 0.5 μg/μL and a sample only containing the BCA mix.\nmix reagent A and B in a ratio of 50:1 for a total volume of 40 μL per sample.\nadd 38 μL of BCA mix to a new 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube.\nadd 2 μL of protein extract.\nadd 2 μL of the BSA curve for each standard point.\nvortex and spin the tubes briefly.\nincubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nanalyze the absorbance at 562 nm using the NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Scientific) and based on the standard curve calculate the protein concentration (mg/mL).\nMix the extracted protein with NuPAGE Reducing Agent 10× (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer 4×.\nNote: Consider a final volume of 30 μL–40 μL per well if using the 1.5 mm 10-wells gel or 20 μL–30 μL per well if using the 1.5 mm 15-wells gel.\nDenature the proteins at 95°C for 10 min.\nPour 100–150 mL of running buffer to cover the bottom of the mini cell (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1503-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

KDa: Kilodaltons; Ctrl1 and Ctrl2: age and sex match controls; S11: patient carrying the PUM1 de novo missense mutation (R1147W).\nPlace a NuPAGE 4%–14% Bis-Tris Gel (10 wells 1.5 mm) in a mini gel cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The wells of NuPAGE 4%–14% Bis-Tris Gel can sometimes contain residual part of gel, make sure of cleaning them by pipetting up and down 100–150 μL of running buffer into the wells.\nLoad the samples and run until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\nNote: Run at 70 V until the dye front surpasses the stacking gel (upper part of the gel), then increase to 120 V. To have well-shaped bands in the western blot, we do not recommend running the gel any faster than 120 V, particularly for proteins with a high molecular weight.\nPrepare 1 L of transfer solution to transfer the proteins from the acrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose membrane.\nPrepare the transfer sandwich (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C):\nCritical: Activate the nitrocellulose membrane in methanol or in transfer solution for 20–30 s.\nPour 500 mL of transfer buffer in the wide-set glass container and the remaining 500 mL in the transfer apparatus.\nPlace the sandwich with the black side facing down (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nImmerse for 10 s a sponge into the transfer buffer and place it over the black side of the sandwich (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Open the gel support and with the help of a filter paper carefully detach the acrylamide gel from the plastic support (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nPlace the filter paper and the acrylamide gel over the sponge with the gel facing up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nGently put the nitrocellulose membrane over the acrylamide gel.\nImmerse a filter paper for 5 s in the transfer buffer and put it over the nitrocellulose membrane.\nImmerse the roller in the transfer buffer and gently roll over the chromatography paper to make sure no air-bubble between the acrylamide gel and the nitrocellulose membrane will remain.\nImmerse for 10 s the sponge into the running buffer.\nPut it on top of the chromatography paper and close the sandwich.\nPlace it into the apparatus with the black side facing the black side of the apparatus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nTransfer the 500 mL from the wide-set glass container to the transfer apparatus.\nNote: If transferring only one acrylamide gel, put two sponges wet of running buffer in the other sandwich.\nRun the transfer applying a constant current of 340 mA for 90 min in cold room (4°C).\nPrepare blocking solution dissolving 2.5 g of nonfat milk in 50 mL of TBS-T 1× to obtain a solution of milk at 5%.\nRemove the nitrocellulose membrane, with the transferred proteins, from the transfer apparatus and incubate (blocking) with milk 5% in TBS-T 1× for at least 30 min at room temperature.\nRinse the membrane 1–2 times with TBS-T 1× to remove the excess of milk.\nIncubate the membrane with the antibody of interest dissolved in TBS-T 1× with 3% BSA and 0.02% of Sodium Azide to a final concentration indicated in the manufacturer’s data sheet overnight at 4°C.\nWash membranes with TBS-T 1× for 10 min each for three times.",
    "Incubate the membrane with secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase, HRP-conjugated, dissolved in milk 5× at a final concentration of 1:10,000 for at least 1 h at room temperature.\nTo image the blot use ECL solution to reveal the images. All the blots are acquired on the G:BOX Chemi XX9 machine (Syngene; Frederick, MD) using GeneSys software 1.6.5.0. Gel exposures are determined by the software. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).",
    "Note: To appreciate modest differences in protein expression, we found that several steps required optimization: i) dilution rates for the primary and secondary antibodies can vary according to your antibody, protein of interest, cell lines, and tissue. Run a few western blots starting from the highest dilution ratio (as recommended by the manufacturer) to the lowest ratio until you will be able to visualize a clear band in your gel; ii) while primary antibodies can be diluted in TBS-T 1×-BSA 3%, other antibodies will work better in TBS-T 1× in 5% non-fat milk. Because antibodies in milk cannot be re-used more than twice, and therefore can become rather expensive, run a western with the primary antibody diluted in both solutions to see which will give you a better resolution; iii) to minimize smearing, avoid running the gel faster than 120 V for proteins weighing more than 90 kDa; iv) to transfer as much protein as possible from your gel to your membrane to ensure a correct quantification, be aware of the influence of protein size. Many labs use a fast transfer technique, but proteins >90 kDa should be transferred at a power no greater than 340 mA for no less than 90 min but not more than 120 min; v) if your protein is highly expressed, use larger wells such as the 10-well gel at 1.5 mm. However, if you want to increase the signal for a protein that is expressed at low levels, use 15 wells at 1.5 mm. In the case of PUM1, 15-well gels did not show as clear a band as the10-well gels.\nStudy the single gene variant in human cell lines",
    "HEK293T cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2. These are fast-growing cells that require high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) medium to survive. Culturing media should contain broad-spectrum antibiotics such as 1% penicillin/streptomycin to reduce the chances of bacterial contamination. We also add 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to supplement the basal medium with nutrients derived from the serum (vitamins, amino acids, growth factors, etc.) and 1% L-Glutamine.\nThe purpose of this section is to guide the reader testing the effect of one or more mutations of the disease-driving gene. In the specific case of PUM1, the readout of the overexpression using PUM1 mutants was to address the protein and mRNA levels of the PUM1 targets ATXN1 and E2F3.\nTransfection of mammalian gene expression vectors into HEK293T cells\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: To transfect HEK293T cells we used jetPRIME Transfection Reagent (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nSeed HEK293T cells in 12 well-plates at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells/well.\nOn day two, cells should be at 70% confluence, ready to be transfected with either full or mutant cDNA of PUM1 (3567 nt) cloned into a mammalian expression vector OmickLinkTMExpression Vector pEZ-M02.\nDilute the desired amount of DNA in 75 μL of jetPRIME buffer, vortex for 10 s and quickly spin down.\nAdd 1.6 μL of jetPRIME reagent, vortex briefly, spin down and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd the transfection mix to each well and place the plate in the incubator for 48 h.\nThe day after transfection, aspirate the medium containing the transfection mix and replace with fresh complete culture medium.\nAfter 48 h post-transfection, collect the cells and process for RNA or protein extraction.",
    "Note: In our study, we transfected 0.5 μg, 1 μg and 2 μg of DNA to test the effect of different protein dosages on PUM1 targets.\nMutagenesis\nWe created three PUM1 mutants (R1139W, R1147W and T1035S) to insert into HEK293T cells by using the QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. We designed the primers for mutagenesis using QuikChange software (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nPrepare the sample reaction mix as follow:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1503_11.csv\nRun the PCR as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1503_12.csv\nAdd 1 μL of the DpnI restriction enzyme (10 U/μL) directly to each reaction tube once the PCR is completed.\nGently but thoroughly mix each reaction mixture by pipetting the solution up and down several times. Spin down the reaction mixtures in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, then immediately incubate the reactions at 37°C for 1 h to digest the parental (i.e., the nonmutated) supercoiled dsDNA.\nNote: It is important to adhere to the 18-cycle limit when cycling the mutagenesis reactions. More than 18 cycles can impair reaction efficiency.\nGently thaw the XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells on ice. For each control and sample reaction to be transformed, aliquot 45 μL of the ultracompetent cells to a prechilled 14-mL BD Falcon polypropylene round-bottom tube.\nAdd 2 μL of the β-ME mix.\nGently swirl the contents of the tube. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min, swirling gently every 2 min.\nTransfer 2 μL of the Dpn I-treated DNA from each control and sample reaction to separate aliquots of the ultracompetent cells. Swirl the transformation reactions gently to mix and incubate the reactions on ice for 30 min.\nPreheat NZY+ broth in a 42°C water bath.\nHeat-pulse the tubes in a 42°C water bath for 30 s. The duration of the heat pulse is critical for obtaining the highest efficiencies. Do not exceed 42°C.",
    "Incubate the tubes on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 0.5 mL of preheated (42°C) NZY+ broth to each tube, then incubate the tubes at 37°C for 1 h with shaking at 225–250 rpm.\nPlate the appropriate volume of each transformation reaction, as indicated in the table below, on agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic for the plasmid vector.\nIncubate the transformation plates at 37°C for >16 h.\nScreen the positive colonies by enzymatic digestions and sequencing."
