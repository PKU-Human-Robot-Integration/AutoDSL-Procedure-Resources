    "This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University.\n1. Preparation of Solutions, Materials, and Animal\nPrepare a 300 µg/ml solution of phenylephrine (PE) and 300 µg/ml solution of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 0.9% saline. Prepare a separate heparin-saline solution by mixing 1 ml of 1,000 U/ml heparin into 10 ml of 0.9% saline.\n\tNOTE: Drugs should be at room temperature before use.\nMake the catheter for intravenous drug infusion from two 30 G x ½” hypodermic needles and PE 10 polyethylene tubing. To make the catheter, insert one needle into one end of the tubing. Remove the needle portion of the other hypodermic needle and insert the blunt end into the other end of the tubing. Attach the catheter to a 1 ml syringe and fill the catheter with the heparin-saline solution.\nPlace mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber containing 2-2.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Leave the mouse in the induction chamber until it is unresponsive to external stimuli.\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber and place it on the heated electrocardiogram (ECG) pad. Maintain the animal at 2% isoflurane.\nApply vet ointment or saline solution to the animal’s eyes to prevent dryness during the procedure.\n2. Insertion of Catheter into Tail Vein\nSince the tail veins are located laterally on both sides of the tail, place the animal on its side for better access. Secure the mouse onto the ECG pad with tape. Make sure the animal is kept warm to promote vasodilation of the tail veins.",
    "Using a piece of silastic tubing as a tourniquet, tie the tourniquet around the base of the tail. Tie the tourniquet tight enough to collapse the veins but not enough to cut off the arterial circulation. After 2-3 min, the vein should bulge out and become more visible.\nGently pull the tail taut. Bend the tail at an angle with one hand and hold the needle parallel to the tail with the other. Pierce the needle where the tail is bent through the skin into the vein. Blood will push back into the catheter if the needle is inserted into the vein.\nPlace one drop of tissue glue where the needle is inserted to secure the catheter. Remove the tourniquet and confirm patency by injecting saline with little resistance.\n3. Insertion of Blood Pressure Catheter through Femoral Artery\nPlace the pressure catheter into a 30 ml syringe filled with distilled water and connect the catheter to the pressure control unit. Soak the catheter in water, plugged in, for 30-45 min during the set-up and surgery procedures.\nPlace the animal supine and tape its paws onto the ECG pad. Apply depilatory cream on the chest and area over the femoral artery.\n\t\nWait 3-5 min and remove cream and hair. Thoroughly remove hair from the chest to prevent artifacts during the ultrasound. Wipe both the chest and hind limb regions with a moistened pad to remove excess depilatory cream.",
    "Using fine scissors, make an incision in the skin above the location of the femoral artery. Dissect through the subcutaneous fat tissue to reveal the femoral artery. The femoral artery is partially covered by the abdomen. Use hemostats to move the abdomen away. Keep the tissues moist by covering it with moist gauze or alternatively dripping saline over it periodically to prevent tissues from drying out. \nUsing fine forceps, separate the nerve away from the artery-vein bundle. Gently pierce through the sheath around the artery-vein bundle to separate the artery from the vein. Pass one suture around the artery at the proximal end and place two sutures at the distal end.\nSecurely knot the most distal suture to stop distal blood flow. Use hemostats to pull the proximal suture to temporarily stop blood flow into the femoral artery. Use microscissors to make a small incision into the femoral artery. Make the incision near the distal knot.\nCalibrate the data acquisition software to the catheter using the calibration settings on the pressure control unit. Switch the pressure control unit back to reading the transducer and balance the pressure catheter so that the catheter outputs 0 mm Hg in the water filled syringe.\nInsert the catheter into the femoral artery. Open the incision with fine forceps with one hand and insert the catheter head into the artery with the other hand.\n\t\nKnot the middle suture around the catheter wire to secure the catheter into the artery. Relax the proximal suture and advance the catheter forward into the abdominal aorta. Knot the proximal suture to further secure the catheter and to prevent bleeding.",
    "Carefully move the ECG pad with mouse, pressure catheter and saline syringe to the ultrasound imaging stage. Connect the blood pressure catheter to the pressure control unit. Place the saline syringe in the syringe pump. Allow the animal and the catheter to equilibrate for 20 min.\n4. Measuring Aortic Diameter Over a Range of Blood Pressures\nReduce isoflurane to 1.5%. Visualize the ascending aorta longitudinally on B-mode using a long axis view. Mount the transducer onto the rail system so that the same view is maintained for the duration of the experiment.\nOn the ultrasound mainframe, place the M-mode cursor over the section of aorta to be tracked. Track the aortic diameter change over the cardiac cycle using M-mode.\nChange the saline in the syringe to the PE solution and place the syringe into the syringe pump.\n\t\nRecord M-mode at baseline aortic pressure. Begin infusion at 360 µg/kg/min and infuse for 1 min for aortic pressure to reach a plateau. For a 25 g mouse, this dose equates to 30 µl/min.\nRecord the M-mode, then stop the infusion, and wait 2 min for blood pressure to return to baseline.\nLower infusion rate to 240 µg/kg/min. For a 25 g mouse, this dose equates to 20 µl/min. Start infusion, infuse for 1 min for blood pressure to plateau, and record M-mode. Stop the infusion, and wait 2 min for blood pressure to return to baseline.\nRepeat step 4.4 for 120 µg/kg/min PE (10 µl/min for a 25 g mouse).",
    "Replace PE with saline and infuse the saline at the rate used for the 360 µg/kg/min infusion (30 µl/min for a 25 g mouse). Infuse for 2-3 min, until further infusion does not produce an increase in aortic pressure and pressure is returning to baseline. Wait 5 min for the blood pressure to stabilize at baseline.\nReplace saline with SNP.\n\t\nRecord M-mode at baseline aortic pressure. Begin infusion at 240 µg/kg/min (20 µl/min for 25 g mouse)and infuse for 1 min. When aortic pressure reaches a plateau, record the M-mode. Stop the infusion and wait 2 min for blood pressure to return to baseline.\nLower infusion rate to 120 µg/kg/min (10 µl/min for 25 g mouse). Start infusion, infuse for 1 min for blood pressure to plateau, and record M-mode. Stop infusion and wait 2 min for blood pressure to return to baseline.\nRepeat step 4.8 for 60 µg/kg/min SNP (5 µl/min for 25 g mouse).\n5. Terminating the Experiment\nTo euthanize the animal, increase isoflurane to 4%. When breathing has slowed, usually in 1-2 min, cut through the sternum with scissors to open the thoracic cavity and expose the heart.\nGrasp the heart with medium forceps and excise it from the body by cutting at the ascending aorta with scissors."
