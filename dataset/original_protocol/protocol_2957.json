    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Lentiviral transduction of H460 cells\nTiming: 9 days\nThis step details the procedures of lentivirus production, titration and the transduction of H460 cells with gRNA lentivirus targeting IPO11 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 60. No more than half a million cells are required in each well of 6-well plate. The cells should be incubated with lentivirus for 48 h before selection.\nPlasmid transfection and lentivirus harvesting.\n24 h before transfection, trypsinize and resuspend 293T cells in exponential phase in medium containing 10% FBS.\nSeed 5 × 106 293T cells in 15 mL medium in a 10-cm cell culture dish.\nCulture at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nNote: The cells are ready for transfection when they reach 70–80% confluency.\nChange to serum-free medium 2 h before transfection.\nPrepare transfection mixture.\nAdd the prepared DNA solutions (20 μg pLenti-U6-spgRNA (NC/IPO11)-CMV plasmid, 15 μg psPAX2 vector plasmid, 10 μg pMD2.G vector plasmid) to a sterilized centrifuge tube.\nMix well with 24 μL of transfection reagent.\nAdjust the total volume to 1 mL.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: The volume of transfection reagent is decided based on reagent instruction and the size of cell culture dish.\nSlowly add the mixture drop by drop to 293T cell culture, mix well, and incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 6 h of incubation, discard the medium containing the transfection mixture and wash once with 10 mL of PBS.\nSlowly add 15 mL of cell medium containing 10% FBS.\nContinue to incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h.\nLentivirus concentration and purification.",
    "Collect the culture medium of 293T cells 48 h after transfection, and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris.\nFilter the supernatant with a 0.45 μm filter in a 40 mL ultracentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 30,000 ×g for 2 h at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant, remove as much liquid as possible from the inner wall of the tube.\nAdd the virus preservation solution.\nAfter sufficient dissolution, centrifuge at 20,000 ×g for 5 min and collect the supernatant.\nTiter assay.\nSeed 4 × 104 293T cells in 100 μL medium per well in a 96-well plate.\nAfter 24 h, perform 10-fold serial dilution of the virus by adding 10 μL of virus to 90 μL of serum-free culture medium.\nAspirate off the culture medium from 96-well plate, add the diluted virus suspensions, and incubate in an incubator.\nAfter 24 h, add 100 μL of complete culture medium to each well.\nObserve the cells under a fluorescence microscope after 4 days.\nNote: The number of fluorescent cells decreases with the increase of the number of dilutions.\nCalculate the transduction units per mL (TU/mL): TU/mL = the number of fluorescent cells/the volume of virus suspension. The number of fluorescent cells can be determined by the number of cells transduced × the percentage of fluorescent cells.\nSeed cells for lentiviral transduction.\nPlate H460 cells in complete RPMI1640 medium in 10 cm dish.\nChange medium every two days until the cells reach 80% confluency.\nSeed half a million cells in 2 mL complete RPMI1640 medium in each well of 6-well plate.\nCulture at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nTransduction of cells.",
    "Aspirate off the complete medium, refeed cells with 1 mL/well basal RPMI1640 medium (without any supplements) before transduction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] left image).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2700-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of H460 cells before (left) and 48 h after (right) lentiviral transduction\nScale bar: 50 μm.\nAdd lentivirus according to the “lentiviral transduction mixture” table in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd 1 mL/well fresh complete medium.\nIncubate at 37°C for 48 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] right image).\nNote: For suspension cells, seed 1/3 of the number of cells usually grown in a container the day before transduction.\nStep 2: Single clone selection using puromycin\nTiming: ∼7 days\nTreat the cells with 8 μg/mL puromycin after transduction to kill those non-transduced cells. Single clone selection from the transduced cells is necessary and critical to the enrichment of cells with genomic modification.\nReseed transduced cells.\nRemove the medium containing lentivirus and wash cells once with PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL/well 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and shake plate gently to make trypsin solution fully cover the cells.\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 2 mL/well fresh complete medium to neutralize trypsin, pipette cells gently.\nTransfer cell suspension into a 10 cm culture dish, add medium to give a final volume of 10 mL.\nCulture at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nPuromycin selection.\nRemove the medium.\nAdd 10 mL selection RPMI1640 medium (refer to the “selection RPMI1640 medium” table in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nContinue to culture cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] left image).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2700-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images of transduced (left) and non-transduced (right) H460 cells after puromycin treatment for 4 days\nScale bar: 50 μm.\nChange medium every 2 days until cells reach 80% confluency.",
    "Note: Before puromycin selection process, optimize the concentration of puromycin by using non-transduced cells. Specifically, culture non-transduced cells in medium containing puromycin at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 ,8 μg/mL). Observe cells under microscope every day. Non-transduced cells are completely killed by puromycin within 4–7 days depending on cell type and concentration of puromycin. Then use the lowest concentration of puromycin that kills all non-transduced cells for the selection of transduced cells. Moreover, during selection, use non-transduced cells as control, treat non-transduced cells with selection medium in the same way as transduced cells. When all non-transduced cells are killed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] right image), transduced cells are ready for single-cell colony selection. Besides, refeeding cells with fresh selection medium in time is necessary to remove dead cells and maintain puromycin concentration. For suspension cells, after selected by puromycin, start single-cell colony picking when cells reach its regular optimal concentration in that container.\nSingle-cell colony selection.\nRemove the medium, wash cells once with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 2 mL selection medium, pipette cells gently.\nTransfer the single cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 ×g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nAdd 4 mL selection medium and resuspend the cell pellets.\nCount cells using hemocytometer, calculate the concentration of cell suspension.\nPerform 10-fold serial dilution to adjust the cell concentration to 10 cells/mL.\nAdd 100 μL cell suspension using multichannel pipet to each well of a 96-well plate to get one cell per well on average for single-cell colony picking.\nCulture cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nObserve the cells under microscope 5–7 days after seeding and every other day thereafter.",
    "Note: The efficiency of single-cell colony formation for H460 cells in 96-well plate is about 40%. Freeze all the remaining cells for subsequent single-cell colony picking if necessary. For single-cell colony picking of suspension cells, prepare a cell suspension at 5 cells/mL, then add 100 μL cell suspension to each well of a 96-well plate to get 0.5 cells per well on average.\nStep 3: Expansion and validation of cell colonies\nTiming: ∼20 days\nThis step presents expansion and validation of the selected single-cell colonies. After about 14 days, single cells form large colonies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] left image), do not pick from wells containing 2 or more colonies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] right image).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2700-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative images of selected H460 single-cell clone (left, 50 μm) and two clones (right, 200 μm) in a well after puromycin selection\nExpansion of single-cell colonies.\nRemove the medium and wash cells once with PBS.\nAdd 0.1 mL/well 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 0.1 mL/well selection medium, pipette cells gently.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 24-well plate.\nAdd the medium to give a final volume of 0.5 mL/well.\nContinue to culture until cells reach 80% confluence.\nRepeat step 6a-c, expand cells gradually from 24-well plate to 60 mm culture dish, and culture cells in maintenance medium (refer to the “maintenance RPMI1640 medium” table in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section).\nValidation of colonies.\nRemove the medium and wash cells once with PBS.\nOnce cells are about 80% confluent, trypsinize cells.\nTake one million cells for western blotting.\nNote: Keep the rest of the cells in culture until the completion of validation.\nProtein extraction.\nAdd 40 μL RIPA to one million cells, incubate on ice for 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nProtein concentration is determined according to the BCA protein assay kit protocol (https://www.beyotime.com/product/P0012.htm[href=https://www.beyotime.com/product/P0012.htm]).\nWestern blotting.\nTake 20 μg protein extracts, mixed with a quarter of loading volume of 4× loading buffer, and boil for 5 min.\nSeparate proteins on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel by electrophoresis at 120 V for about 2 h.\nTransfer proteins to PVDF membrane using a wet system at 350 mA for 1 h at 4°C.\nBlock the membrane with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membrane 3 times with TBS, 5 min each time.\nIncubate the membrane with primary antibodies diluted in Primary Antibody Dilution Buffer (IPO11: 1:500; GAPDH: 1:1000) 12 h at 4°C.\nWash the membrane 5 times with TBS, 5 min each time.\nIncubate the membrane with secondary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk in TBS for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membrane 3 times with TBS, 10 min each time.\nDetect the signal of IPO11 and GAPDH on a FluorChem™ M system after treatment with ECL (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2700-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Confirmation of IPO11 deletion\nThe expression level of IPO11 protein in different single-cell colonies of transduced H460 cells.\nNote: The optimization of the concentration of puromycin in maintenance medium can start with half its concentration in selective medium. Test different concentrations of puromycin. The general rule is to choose the lowest concentration of puromycin that maintains high knockout efficiency but little cytotoxicity. The optimized concentration of selective antibiotics varies by cell type. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the concentration of antibiotics in selection and maintenance medium for cells of interest.\nStep 4: Plasmid transfection of H460-ΔIPO11 cells\nTiming: 3 days",
    "In this part, we respectively re-express WT and N-terminal mutant IPO11 in the generated IPO11-deleted H460 (H460-ΔIPO11) cells as described above.\nSeed cells for transfection.\nExpand H460-ΔIPO11 cells in 10 cm culture dish to get the required number of cells for transfection.\nOnce cells are about 80% confluent, seed 8 × 105 cells/well into a 6-well plate, culture for 24 h.\nPlasmid transfection.\nChange medium before transfection.\nAdd plasmids to cells according to the “plasmid transfection mixture” table.\nCulture in an incubator for 72 h.\nCollect cells for validation.\nNote: Observe the cells for any change in cell morphology and viability 6–24 h after transfection. If there are many dead cells, replace the medium with fresh medium in time. Otherwise, cells can be cultured with transfection mixture for 72 h.\nStep 5: Validation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe purpose of this step is to validate the transfection efficiency using western blotting. The process is the same as 10c–f in Step 3."
