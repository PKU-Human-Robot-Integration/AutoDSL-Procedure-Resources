    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConjugation and purification of protein-oligonucleotide conjugates\nTiming: approx. 8 h\nTo generate DPC model substrates, we repurposed a commercially available solution, which was originally developed for the conjugation of protein ligands to DNA-based biosensors. Protein and oligonucleotide are conjugated using the proFIRE Amine Coupling Kit. Subsequently, conjugates are purified using the proFIRE chromatography system. Purification of the conjugate is in principle also possible using other chromatography systems (e.g., ÄKTA (Cytiva) or NGC (Bio-Rad)). However, other systems may require additional optimization to reliably separate proteins and oligonucleotides from conjugates.\nNote: First, it is important to determine the elution profile of unconjugated DNA in anion exchange chromatography. The following steps can be performed at 20°C–25°C unless indicated otherwise.\nResuspend one aliquot of thio-dT-modified oligonucleotide (3 nmol) in 40 μL dilution buffer (proFIRE Amine Coupling Kit). Resuspend the solution thoroughly by pipetting up-and-down or mild vortexing. Centrifuge the tube and place on ice. Always make sure to protect fluorescently labeled DNA from light.\nEquilibrate the proFIRE anion exchange column first with water and perform a test run using buffer A and B according to the proFIRE manual to ensure that the system is free of leaks and that pump and column pressures are correct.\nTake 20 μL of the resuspended oligonucleotide and dilute with 140 μL dilution buffer. Keep leftover oligonucleotide (20 μL) on ice, in case the equilibration has to be repeated. Store at −20°C after successful equilibration.\nInject 160 μL diluted DNA and run it using default settings that correspond to the DNA length (e.g., 30 nucleotides).",
    "Analyze elution profile. Different oligonucleotides interact with varying strength with the anion exchange resin. By increasing the salt concentration during chromatography from 150 mM NaCl (proFIRE buffer A) to 1 M NaCl (proFIRE buffer B), the specific salt concentration at which a particular unconjugated DNA elutes is determined.\nThe protein-oligonucleotide conjugate will elute at lower salt concentrations than unconjugated DNA. Set up a chromatography protocol so that 12 fractions of 0.6 CVs each are collected prior to elution of unconjugated DNA.\nNote: Once a calibration for one specific oligonucleotide sequence is performed, the same chromatography program can be applied for other conjugation reactions using the same DNA. Different oligonucleotide lengths or sequences will lead to different elution profiles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If oligonucleotide length or sequence are altered, another calibration has to be performed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/729-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Oligonucleotide size and sequence influence elution properties\nTwo unconjugated 30-mer oligonucleotides with different sequences (oligo A and B) elute differently in anion exchange chromatography.\nPause Point: It is possible to pause at this point.\nNote: During this step the protein is conjugated to the oligonucleotide and the conjugate is separated from unconjugated protein and DNA using anion exchange chromatography. The conjugation reaction requires incubation for at least 12 h at 4°C. We recommend to start the protocol in the afternoon (4 pm) and continue with the purification the next morning (10 am). The oligonucleotide needs to be protected from light during all steps using aluminium foil or using black plastic tubes. The following steps can be performed at 20°C–25°C.\nThaw dilution and conjugation buffer (proFIRE Amine Coupling Kit) until they are completely dissolved.",
    "Equilibrate two purification spin columns per coupling reaction. Add 400 μL of conjugation buffer and subsequently centrifuge at 1500 × g for 1 minute. Discard flow through and add another 400 μL of conjugation buffer. Centrifuge again and discard flow through.\nDissolve 3 nmol modified oligonucleotide in 40 μL dilution buffer and vortex mildly until completely dissolved.\nDissolve the bifunctional crosslinker (proFIRE Amine Coupling Kit) in 100 μL H2O and vortex.\nAdd 10 μL of the dissolved crosslinker to the diluted oligonucleotide.\nMix reaction by flicking the tube, spin down, and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPurify sample by adding the oligonucleotide from step 12 on top of the first purification spin column. Centrifuge at 1500 × g for 2 min and collect flow through. Discard spin column after use.\nAdd flow through on top of the second column and centrifuge again at 1500 × g for 2 min. Collect flow through in a fresh 1.5 mL tube. The flow through contains the oligonucleotide.\nAdd 50 μL of your aliquoted protein (250 μg) to the oligonucleotide and pipette up and down.\nIncubate the conjugation between 12–15 h on ice while protected from light.\nOptional: Reactions can also be incubated for 1 h at 20°C–25°C which has the advantage of performing crosslinking reaction and conjugate purification in a single day. However, the shorter incubation time may lead to decreased crosslinking efficiency. Therefore, we recommend to incubate the reaction for at least 12 h at 4°C. Incubation for up to 15 h is well tolerated by protein G, but we recommend to test the stability of other proteins before using them in conjugation reactions.",
    "On the next day, equilibrate the proFIRE anion exchange column with water and subsequently with buffer B followed by buffer A. Conduct a test run by injecting 160 μL dilution buffer using the chromatography program you generated during calibration.\nFollowing the test run, inject at least 160 μL (a) of the conjugation reaction and start the run (b).\nThe volume of the conjugation reaction is approximately 90 μL. Take the entire reaction into a syringe and fill it up with buffer A to a total volume of 160 μL. Avoid air bubbles inside the syringe to not harm the purification column.\nDuring the run, a salt gradient is applied to the column starting from 150 mM NaCl to 865 mM NaCl in 16 CV (1 CV = 1 mL), followed by 2 CV of 1 M NaCl and 6 CV 150 mM NaCl.\nCollect fractions containing the protein-oligonucleotide conjugate (0.6 CV/fraction) in 1.5 mL tubes.\nCritical: The purity of the conjugate is more important than its yield. Fractions overlapping with the elution of unconjugated DNA (judged by the absorbance profile, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) should not be selected as this might interfere with results of conjugate cleavage and binding assays (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/729-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Conjugate purification\nFollowing the crosslinking reaction, the conjugate is separated from unconjugated protein and oligonucleotide using anion exchange chromatography. The conjugate is collected in fractions of 0.6 column volumes (gray-shaded area).\nEquilibrate centrifugal filters (3 kDa cut-off buffer exchange columns, proFIRE Amine Coupling Kit) with conjugate desalting buffer.",
    "Add 500 μL of the first conjugate fraction on top of the filter and centrifuge at 4°C and 12000 × g for 15 min. Discard flow through and repeat until all fractions are collected in one filter. After adding the final 500 μL of conjugate, centrifuge until 100 μL of sample remain on top of the filter.\nAdd 300 μL conjugate desalting buffer and centrifuge at 4°C and 12000 × g for 15 min.\nRepeat previous step three times and discard flow through each time.\nCentrifuge until 150 μL of sample remains on top of the filter. Transfer the concentrated conjugate to a fresh tube.\nPrepare a standard curve of unconjugated fluorescently labeled DNA with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM and measure Cy5 (649 nm) or 6-FAM (495 nm) absorbance using a SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode Detection platform. Determine Cy5 or 6-FAM absorbance of the purified and concentrated conjugate and calculate the concentration based on the standard.\nOptional: Conjugate concentration can also be determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop photometer.\nAfter determining the conjugate concentration, add BSA to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL. BSA is important to stabilize the conjugate. Without BSA, conjugates tend to aggregate over time (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nAliquot sample in 3 μL aliquots in 0.2 mL thin-wall PCR tubes. Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store protected from light at −80°C.\nNote: Cy5-labelled DNA tends to adhere to plastic tubes. Therefore, we recommend to aliquot and store conjugates in low-binding PCR tubes.\nPause Point: Conjugates are stable at −80°C for > 1 year. Ensure that they are protected from light.\nProtein-oligonucleotide conjugate cleavage assay\nTiming: 8 h",
    "In this step, cleavage of protein-oligonucleotide conjugates by the DPC protease SPRTN is analyzed using native 1 × TBE gels and a fluorescent imaging system. Three model substrates with different DNA structures are generated during the annealing reaction: a ssDPC, a junction-DPC, and a dsDPC (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The same DNA structures are also generated without a conjugated protein as controls. Substrates are then tested for cleavage by wild-type (WT) SPRTN with a catalytic inactive E112Q (EQ) variant serving as control.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/729-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Protein-oligonucleotide conjugate cleavage assay\nSchematic depiction of the fluorescently labeled protein G-oligonucleotide conjugates used to probe SPRTN specificity (left panel). Recombinant SPRTN (5 nM, WT or the catalytically inactive EQ variant) is incubated with the indicated model substrates (25 nM) for 2 h at 25°C prior to separation on native TBE gels (right panel).\nNote: Ideally, native TBE gels should be casted on the day of the experiment. If necessary, gels can be casted in advance and stored at 4°C after wrapping in tissues soaked with TBE running buffer. Gels should not be stored for more than 3 days. A separating and a stacking part are required for 1 × TBE gels used in conjugate cleavage assays. To achieve reproducible results, we recommend to always cast identically sized separating parts. Therefore, label the intended top position of the separating gel on the gel casting cassettes.\nAlternatives: We have good experience using disposable gel casting cassettes (Thermo Fisher). Alternatively, other gel systems can be used to cast TBE gels. 1 × and 0.5 × TBE gels are also commercially available as pre-cast gels. However, native pre-cast gels have the disadvantage of a short shelf-life (< 6 weeks).",
    "Cast 1 × native TBE gel (8 × 8 cm Mini gel size) for protein-oligonucleotide conjugate cleavage assays according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] (separating gel: 20% polyacrylamide, stacking gel: 4% polyacrylamide).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_6.csv\nPipette stock solutions for the separating gel into a 15 mL conical tube. Add APS and TEMED last. Close the tube and invert 2–3 times.\nPour the separating gel immediately into the casting cassette until it reaches the intended level. This level should be beneath the comb which will be inserted later on.\nImmediately cover the gel with 500 μL isopropanol and let it polymerize for 45 min.\nInvert cassette and collect isopropanol with a tissue.\nPipette stock solutions for the stacking gel into a 15 mL conical tube, add APS and TEMED last and invert 2–3 times.\nCast stacking gel and immediately insert comb. Let gel polymerize for 45 min.\nPlace the polymerized gels into a running chamber filled with 1 × TBE running buffer. Buffers should be pre-cooled to 4°C.\nFlush the wells carefully using a 200 μL pipette.\nPre-run gel (preferably at 4°C) at 100 V for 30 min\nCritical: Acrylamide is a toxic chemical. Cast gel in a flow hood and take appropriate caution when handling hazardous substances (wear gloves and goggles). Provide enough time for the gel to polymerize to completion. If the comb is taken out too early, the pockets will not form properly. However, do not polymerize the gel for more than 2 h, because the gels tend to crack, if dried out.\nCritical: The DPC protease SPRTN tends to precipitate at elevated temperatures. Thus, all running buffers have to be pre-cooled prior to running the gel. Additionally, running gel electrophoreses at 4°C will improve results.",
    "Note: All steps containing Cy5-labelled DNA are carried out in PCR or low-binding tubes. When using standard tubes, Cy5 adheres to the plastic, which may result in differences between samples. Prepare all dilutions on ice and turn off the light to avoid photobleaching. Protect tubes from light with aluminium foil.\nNote: Steps 32–36 are also used for the binding assays and will be referred to below.\nPrepare conjugate storage buffer containing 0.4 mg/mL BSA, 500 mM KCl, 50 mM TCEP and high-salt SPRTN buffer as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. Add TCEP and BSA to the buffers as indicated.\nDilute the protein-oligonucleotide conjugate and the forward control oligo to 100 nM in conjugate storage buffer (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], DNA 1 and 2).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_7.csv\nDilute reverse oligos in H2O to 120 nM (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], DNA 3 and 4).\nNote: The excess of reverse oligo ensures that conjugates anneal to completion.\nMix DNAs from Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] with a volume ratio of 1:1 in PCR tubes to generate substrates with different DNA structures according to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_8.csv\nNote: The required amount of annealed substrates depends on the number of conditions to be tested in the assay. 5 μL of annealed substrate is needed for one cleavage/binding reaction. As an example, testing cleavage of SPRTN-WT, SPRTN-EQ and a negative control without protease requires at least 15 μL of annealed substrate (3 × 5 μL). Thus, 10 μL forward DNA are annealed with 10 μL reverse DNA to generate a small excess.\nAnneal reactions in a thermal cycler using the following settings (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_9.csv\nNote: The temperature of the initial denaturation step is limited by the stability of the conjugated protein. High temperatures will result in protein denaturation and precipitation. In our experience, denaturing at 37°C is sufficient to allow annealing of most sequences.",
    "Prepare master mix (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]). Prepare a small excess of the master mix (e.g., a 15 × master mix for 12 cleavage reactions).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_10.csv\nDistribute 4 μL of master mix into 0.2 mL PCR tubes. Keep on ice (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_729_11.csv\nAdd 5 μL of the substrates a-f (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) to PCR tubes (Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\nFlick the tube, spin down, and place on ice. Cover samples with aluminum foil.\nThaw the DPC protease (e.g., SPRTN WT and EQ) on ice and prepare the desired stock concentration in high-salt SPRTN buffer.\nSPRTN precipitates at elevated temperatures. Thaw enzyme aliquots on ice. Once SPRTN is diluted in high salt SPRTN buffer, add immediately to reactions.\nA 50 nM stock concentration of SPRTN will result in a final assay concentration of 5 nM, which should be sufficient for efficient conjugate cleavage. High SPRTN concentrations (> 50 nM assay concentration) will interfere with interpretation of the result due to complex formation between SPRTN and the cleaved conjugate (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nAdd 1 μL of the respective protease or high-salt SPRTN buffer as negative control to the reactions.\nThe final reaction volume is 10 μL containing 25 nM DPC or DNA in 80 mM KCl, 17.5 mM HEPEs (pH 7.5), 3.5% Glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM TCEP.\nIncubate reactions at 25°C for 2 h in a thermal cycler.\nIn the meantime, pre-run 1 × TBE gel (ideally at 4°C).

Three different DNA structures are generated during the annealing reaction: a ssDPC, a junction-DPC and a dsDPC (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). We recommend to titrate the amount of protease by testing a series of concentrations. Therefore at least two different concentrations are used to assess binding to different substrates.
