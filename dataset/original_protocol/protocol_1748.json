    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInitial calculations and assay setup for fluorescence microplate reading\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step defines the initial set-up for the plate reader assay, including the layout of wells in a 96-well plate, the total cell numbers, and the amount of transfection reagent to be used. Readers can passage cells according to the experimental design and the corresponding calculation.\nPrior to the assay, determine the number of experimental conditions (e.g., compounds to be tested), X.\nInclude positive and negative controls: Fsk/IBMX treatment and no-treatment conditions. This brings the total number of conditions to X + 2.\nNote: For every plate reader assay, we recommend including wells treated with Fsk (50 μM)/IBMX (100 μM) as a positive control condition. Fsk directly activates transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, which produce cAMP, and IBMX inhibits cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase, thus maximally elevating cellular cAMP levels and PKA activity. Fsk/IBMX-treated wells can be used to confirm whether the sensor is working properly and to assess the dynamic range of ExRai-AKAR2 under different conditions (e.g., cell type, transfection rate, etc.). We also recommend including a set of non-treated wells as a negative control to make sure that there is no significant baseline drifting during the assay.\nAlso include a non-transfected condition to correct for background fluorescence.\nNote: The fluorescence from non-transfected wells will reflect cellular autofluorescence, and it will be subtracted from the fluorescence readings obtained from transfected cells.\nEach condition should be performed in triplicate (e.g., 3 wells per condition). Thus, the total number of wells to be seeded will be N = 3(X + 2 + 1).\nNote: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] provides an exemplary layout for one reading plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1337-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Left: A single 96-well plate is seeded with ExRai-AKAR2-transfected HEK293T cells, setting aside 3 wells to be seeded with non-transfected cells for background correction. One set of triplicate transfected wells is treated with Fsk/IBMX as a positive control for maximal PKA activation and ExRai-AKAR2 response. Another triplicate set of transfected wells should be left untreated as a negative control for baseline recording. Each experimental condition is similarly performed in triplicate. Right: Example time course recordings illustrating the response of ExRai-AKAR2 to various stimuli, including positive and negative controls (upper curves), as well as Gαs-coupled agonist vs agonist + antagonist (lower left), different doses of a Gαs-coupled receptor agonist, (lower middle), and Gαi-coupled receptor agonist treatment following Fsk induced-PKA activation (lower right).\nCalculate the total cell number for seeding. For HEK293T cells, the seeding density is 5 × 104 cells/well, thus the total cell number is 5 × 104 × N.\nDetermine the quantity of plasmid DNA and PolyJet to be used for transfection (8 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/3 μL PolyJet/1 μg DNA ).\nNote: For example, to seed one 96-well plate, we use 5 × 104 × 96 = 4.8 × 106 cells. The ratio of cell number/transfection reagent/DNA amount is: 4.8 × 106 cells/18 μL PolyJet/6 μg DNA\nAlternatives: Other transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine may suffice as well, and longer incubations times might be required for protein expression depending on the specific cell type. For difficulties with transfection, we refer readers to problem 1 in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nPassage HEK293T cells for seeding and transfection.\nPlate coating with poly-D-lysine\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes the procedure for coating the 96 well plate with poly-D-lysine to enhance cell attachment, which is helpful to avoid artifacts from cell detachment after drug addition.",
    "Prepare boric acid buffer: 50 mM boric acid, 25 mM sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5.\nDissolve poly-D-lysine (PDL) in boric acid buffer to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.\nAdd 50 μL of 0.1 mg/mL PDL solution to N wells (calculated above) of a black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well assay plate (CellVis) and incubate for 24 h at 20°C–25°C in a biosafety cabinet. Afterwards, wash all wells once with HBSS.\nAlternatives: Other coating reagents such as lamin, fibronectin, collagen, etc., may also be used as appropriate depending on the specific cell type chosen for the experiments. Pre-coated plates may be purchased commercially as well.\nCell seeding and transfection\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes preparation of a 96-well plate to obtain sufficient cell density and ExRai-AKAR2 expression for the following screening assay.\nDilute calculated amount of ExRai-AKAR2 plasmid DNA into high-glucose DMEM to a concentration of 1μg DNA/50 μL high-glucose DMEM (e.g., 6 μg DNA/300 μL high-glucose DMEM for one plate).\nDilute calculated amount of PolyJet reagent into high-glucose DMEM to a concentration of 3 μL PolyJet/50 μL high-glucose DMEM (e.g., 18 μL PolyJet/300 μL high-glucose DMEM for one plate).\nMix and incubate the DNA/lipid complex for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nHarvest cultured HEK293T cells, collecting at least 5 × 104 × N cells (see step 5 above).\nResuspend the harvested HEK293T cells in culture media to a final concentration of 5 × 104 cells/100 μL.\nPrepare 3(X + 2) × 100 μL of cell suspension for transfection; prepare another 300 μL of cell suspension for the non-transfected control wells.\nTransfect the cells by mixing 3(X + 2) × 100 μL of cell suspension with the DNA/lipid complex.\nSeed both transfected and non-transfected cells by adding 100 μL of cell suspension into the corresponding wells of a PDL-coated 96-well plate.",
    "Incubate the seeded cells for 24 h at 37°C to express the biosensor.\nCritical: Check the fluorescence signal for the experimental groups and non-transfected controls 24 h after transfection. A transfection efficiency of approximately 50%–70% should be observed in the wells for the experimental groups to achieve a good SNR, and little or no fluorescence should be detected in the non-transfected wells. If the transfection rate is low, we refer readers to problem 1 in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nFluorescence microplate reading of ExRai-AKAR2-expressing cells\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section provides a step-by-step walkthrough for performing fluorescence microplate reading with acute drug addition. The resulting data reveal the dynamics of PKA activity changes in response to various GPCR modulators.\nPrepare 10× solutions of all drugs by diluting drug stocks with HBSS imaging buffer.\nSet up the fluorescence microplate reader to perform dual-excitation measurements of ExRai-AKAR2 fluorescence intensity.\nCritical: Appropriate excitation and emission, Z position, flashes number, camera gain and time lapse settings are required to collect enough fluorescence and achieve good SNR. For example, on our TECAN SPARK 20M, we use 480 nm and 400 nm excitation with 10 nm bandwidth, and 520 emission with a 20 nm bandwidth, and both channels use 30 flashes and 180 gain. The read applies bottom-read mode, and the optimal Z position is automatically determined from a transfected well. A 2-min time lapse is required for our protocol to read an entire plate, though this value can be modified depending on the hardware and the read settings. We recommend performing a pilot read to test how long it takes to complete one round and then set an appropriate interval between each round of reading.",
    "Carefully remove the culture media from each well, wash the wells once with HBSS Imaging Buffer, and refill each well with 45 μL of HBSS Imaging Buffer.\nAcquire a baseline recording (cycle 0) by reading the plate for a single cycle.\nRemove the plate from the reader and carefully add 5 μL of 10× drug solution to each well.\nNote: Although adding 5 μL of drug solution will increase the total assay volume from 45 μL to 50 μL, this should have little impact on the fluorescence intensity and excitation ratio of the sensor, as these measurements are recorded from cells adhered to the bottom of each well, rather than from the assay solution.\nNote: Adding drug to each well individually may lead to a significant lag in the responses from different wells, potentially making kinetic comparisons between wells more difficult. To avoid this, we recommend performing drug addition using a multichannel pipette if possible. Before plate reading, pipette all of the 10× drug stocks into a separate 96-well plate, arraying the drugs to match the arrangement of the experimental conditions in the test plate. For drug addition, transfer the drugs row by row using a P10 multi-channel pipette.",
    "Critical: Some drugs may exhibit strong fluorescence that overlaps with the spectrum of ExRai-AKAR2, leading to false-positive responses. Therefore, the fluorescence of any new drug should be assessed before inclusion in the assay. To examine the intrinsic fluorescence of a given drug, we recommend testing it using a plate of cells transfected by ExRai-AKAR2 (T/A), which is a negative-control mutant that cannot be phosphorylated. Similar to the ExRai-AKAR2 plate reader assay, add 45 μL of Imaging Buffer to perform a baseline read, and then 5 μL of 10× drug solution or Imaging Buffer to read the fluorescence under 480-nm excitation/520-nm emission and 400-nm excitation/520-nm emission. Special attention should be given to any drug that shows significantly stronger fluorescence than a control well with no drug added under either 480-nm or 400-nm excitation. Corrections can be made using drug fluorescence readings, though compounds with very strong fluorescence may need to be excluded from the experiment.\nRe-insert the plate and resume reading for the desired number of cycles to obtain a time-course recording.\nRepeat steps 24 and 25 for any subsequent drug additions.\nCell culture and transfection for epifluorescence imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the seeding and transfection of cells for epifluorescence imaging of ExRai-AKAR2.\nPassage HEK293T cells into 35-mm glass-bottom dishes at approximately 30% confluency.\nThe following day, determine the amount of ExRai-AKAR2 plasmid DNA and PolyJet to be used for transfection (500 ng DNA/1.5 μL PolyJet/35-mm dish).\nDilute the calculated amount of ExRai-AKAR2 plasmid DNA into high-glucose DMEM to a concentration of 500 ng DNA/50 μL high-glucose DMEM.\nDilute the calculated amount of PolyJet reagent into high-glucose DMEM to a concentration of 1.5 μL PolyJet/50 μL high-glucose DMEM.\nMix and incubate the DNA/lipid complex for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Transfect the cells by adding 100 μL of DNA/lipid complex into each 35-mm glass-bottom dish. Incubate the cells for 24 h at 37°C to allow for protein expression.\nValidating screening hits using live-cell epifluorescence imaging of ExRai-AKAR2\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes a step-by-step walkthrough of live-cell epifluorescence imaging of ExRai-AKAR2, and all screening hits will be validated by testing PKA responses from single cells with enhanced sensitivity and temporal resolution.\nPrepare drugs at 1000× stock concentration. Aliquot 2 μL of 1000× drug stocks into separate 1.5-mL tubes.\nNote: Store drug aliquots properly during imaging. Most drugs are best kept on ice, but this will depend on the specific compound.\nPerform real-time imaging with acute stimulation.\nCritical: Multiple factors need to be considered when performing real-time imaging with ExRai-AKAR2. Appropriate excitation and emission filters for dual-excitation imaging, exposure times, ND filters and acquisition intervals are required to obtain enough fluorescence signal and avoid photobleaching. For example, we use a 480DF20 excitation filter and 535DF50 emission filter for the 488-nm excitation channel (GFP480) and a 405DF20 excitation filter and 535DF50 emission filter for the 400-nm excitation channel (GFP400), along with 500 ms exposure time for both channels, a 0.6 ND filter, and a 15–30 s acquisition interval. In addition, higher-magnification objectives (≥40×) are recommended to achieve greater spatial resolution during imaging.\nCarefully aspirate the culture media from the imaging dish and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of HBSS Imaging Buffer. Add 2 mL of Imaging Buffer for imaging.\nMount the prepared imaging dish on the microscope stage.\nFocus the cells and begin acquiring images in both the GFP480 and GFP400 channels.\nImage the cells for at least 5 min prior to any stimulation to acquire a baseline signal.",
    "Note: A minimum baseline recording of 5 min is required to see the effect from drug addition. Longer times may be required if a drifting baseline is observed initially. For issues with drifting baseline, we refer readers to the Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] of the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nPause the image acquisition to perform the first drug addition: Leaving the dish fixed on the microscope stage, use a P1000 pipette to transfer ∼0.5 mL of Imaging Buffer from the imaging dish into a 1.5 mL tube containing an aliquot of 1000× drug stock. Mix well by pipetting up and down, and then carefully add the mixture back to the imaging dish. GENTLY mix within the imaging dish by pipetting at least 3 more times to ensure homogeneous distribution of the drug.\nCritical: Drug addition and mixing may cause significant shear stress on the cell surface. When pipetting the drug and Imaging Buffer, keep the pipette tip away from the center of the dish to avoid strong turbulence on the cells being recorded. For cells with relatively weak attachment to the imaging dish, such as HEK293T cells, using imaging dishes coated with PDL (or another substrate) can help reduce the risk of cell detachment. Diluting the drug aliquot into a smaller volume of Imaging Buffer (i.e., using a P200 pipette) may also help reduce turbulence during mixing. In addition, avoid touching the imaging dish and the microscope stage with the pipette tip, as this may cause the imaging field to shift and/or go out of focus.\nResume imaging and continue acquisitions until the fluorescence signal reaches a plateau. Repeat for any subsequent drug additions.",
    "Note: ExRai-AKAR2 has been used to report changes in PKA activity induced by various stimuli. We recommend performing Fsk/IBMX stimulation at the end of each imaging experiment as a positive control. Including Fsk/IBMX addition is helpful for verifying biosensor function, normalizing observed ratio changes caused by test compounds against the maximum sensor response, thus facilitating quantitative comparisons across different compounds and experimental replicates, and also verifying that the selected drug concentrations are not saturating the biosensor response. For any compounds whose responses are close to the Fsk/IBMX-induced maximum, we recommend that readers test a range of drug concentrations to identify an appropriate, sub-saturating dose.\nNote: To verify that ratio changes observed in cells expressing ExRai AKAR2 are due to phosphorylation of the sensor, we recommend testing any new and unknown compounds identified from plate-reader experiments via epifluorescence imaging using the non-phosphorylatable ExRai-AKAR2 (T/A) mutant as a negative control. Cells expressing ExRai-AKAR2 (T/A) should exhibit no ratio change in response to stimulation. For any excitation ratio changes observed using ExRai-AKAR2 (T/A), please refer to problem 5 in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section."
