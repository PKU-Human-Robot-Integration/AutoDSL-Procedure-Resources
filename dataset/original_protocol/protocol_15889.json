    "This protocol aims to establish colon organoid cultures from patient biopsies. The tumor and healthy tissues are processed in parallel, with a separate set of sterile material, and in a BSC to work under aseptic culture conditions. Once extracted from patients, the biopsies are put in ice-cold DMEM/F-12 supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotic and kept at 4°C for transport. Then, in a BSC, the biopsies are extensively washed and minced into small pieces in a solution of gentle cell dissociation reagent (GCDR). Biopsies are incubated at 37°C on a shaker to induce tissue dissociation resulting in a turbid solution containing small chunks and isolated intestinal crypts. This solution is filtered to mechanically fragment the chunks and obtain a higher yield of isolated intestinal crypts, which will enable the growth and the maturation of colon organoids. The intestinal crypt solution is centrifuged, and the pellet is resuspended in Cultrex, which is basement membrane extract (BME). Then, domes containing Cultrex-intestinal crypts are seeded in a 24-well plate and dried before the incubation in IntestiCult to establish and propagate colon organoids derived from patients. An overview of this workflow is presented in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eaff3ef4-4d25-4b64-a38d-79aeb6f4900b/cpz1943-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nWorkflow of PDCO generation. (A) Material preparation. (B) Workflow describing how biopsies (healthy and tumor tissues) are processed to be seeded into Cultrex-domes to generate PDCO cultures. In brief, once the biopsies are extracted from the patient, tumor and healthy tissues are weighed and processed separately. The biopsies are washed, minced successively into small pieces, and crypts are isolated by tissue dissociation. Finally, crypts are resuspended in Cultrex for subsequent dome formation. Intesticult medium is then added with the apoptosis inhibitor (Y-27632).\nMaterials\nIntestiCult organoid growth medium (human) (StemCell Technologies, cat. no. 06010)\nAntibiotic-antimycotic (100×) (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 15240062)\nDMEM/F-12 (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 11320033)",

Prepare complete IntestiCult organoid growth medium (human) following the supplier guidelines, and warm it up to room temperature (15° to 25°C).",
    "To prevent any bacterial and fungi contamination, due to the extraction of the biopsies in non-aseptic conditions once removed from the patient, an antibiotic-antimycotic (1×) is added to complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium.\nFor the remainder of this article, this complete medium with antibiotics will be referred to as “IntestiCult” for ease of reading.\n3. Prepare 12 ml of sterile DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% (w/v) BSA (or a larger volume for storage at 4°C for up to 3 months) and keep it on ice.\nBSA is crucial to prevent the biopsy pieces to stick to the plastics and consequently lose material.\n4. Thaw Cultrex UltiMatrix RGF BME on ice and keep it on ice during all the following steps of the protocol.\nFor each well of a 24-well plate, 50 µl will be required. A ∼300 mg biopsy allows the seeding of 4 to 6 wells.\nThe yield of intestinal crypts per tissue (and subsequently number of domes) is dependent on the patient and the nature of the tissue.\nIn the rest of this article, Cultrex UltiMatrix RGF BME will be referred to as “Cultrex” for ease of reading.\nCultrex is stored at −20°C and can be aliquoted to be stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks.\nBudget-friendly note: Alternatively, Cultrex can be replaced by Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix.\nBiopsy mechanical processing\n5. Weigh the biopsies that are in 10 ml DMEM/F-12 supplemented with antimycotic. Keep the biopsies on ice. Process the two biopsies (tumor tissue and healthy tissue) side-by-side and at the same time. Make sure to either rinse or change the scalpel set between each tissue to prevent cross-contamination.",
    "Biopsies are collected on the same day as the tumor resection, ideally within a few hours after resection. Between resection and collection, biopsies are stored in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with antimycotic at 4°C.\n6. Wash the biopsy 3 times with 5 ml of cold DPBS. Between each washing step, aspirate the supernatant carefully and discard it.\nEnsure to leave a minimal volume of supernatant to prevent accidental aspiration and subsequent loss of material during washing steps.\n7. Add 3 ml of fresh DPBS and transfer the biopsy into a 10-cm Petri dish.\n8. Using 2 sterile scalpels to create a neat scission, split the biopsy into 2 pieces accounting for 1/3 and 2/3 in size of the original biopsy, respectively. The smallest part can be cut into 2 pieces, placed in cryogenic vials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80°C for future downstream experiments (protein or RNA extraction for example). The larger piece is processed as follows.\nAs mentioned earlier, please make sure to use separate pairs of scalpels for the tumor tissue and healthy tissue. You may use the same scalpels throughout the entire protocol.\nIf liquid nitrogen is unavailable, you can snap-freeze the smaller pieces by immersing them in a bath of dry ice and isopentane at −80°C. Be cautious, as isopentane is highly volatile.\nAdditionally, for immunohistochemistry purposes, a third piece can be cut and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature and then transferred into a 15-ml centrifuge tube with a 30% sucrose solution for 48 hr. Then the piece of tissue can be embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, snap frozen, and kept at –80°C for long-term storage.",
    "9. Use the scalpels to mince tissues into the smallest pieces you can generate. Add 5 ml of GCDR to start the dissociation of the tissue pieces and transfer the solution into a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n10. Rinse the 10-cm dish with 5 ml of fresh GCDR and transfer the solution with the remaining tissue chunks to the 15-ml tube.\nBiopsy disruption to isolate intestinal crypts\n11. Incubate the GCDR solution with the tissue pieces for 45 to 60 min at 37°C, on a tube rotator at 140 rpm.\nEvery biopsy is different from one patient to another, and from healthy tissue to tumor tissue. Consequently, the time required for tissue dissociation will vary. It is crucial to troubleshoot the incubation time of the biopsy since over-incubation, as well as under-incubation, will lead to the loss of intestinal crypts. Therefore, double-check the turbidity of the solution every 15 min. Once the tissue is dissociated, chunks of small sizes will appear leading to a very turbid solution.\n12. Transfer the GCDR solution, containing chunks and isolated intestinal crypts, with a 10-ml pipette onto a 70-μm cell strainer placed on a 50-ml centrifuge tube. In the event of a hindered filtration, pipette-mediated scratching of the top of the strainer should help to resume the process.\nPre-coat the 10-ml pipet with GCDR to prevent the tissue pieces to stick onto the plastic.\n13. To maximize material collection, rinse the strainer with 3 ml of DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA. The collected medium is then transferred to the 50-ml tube containing the rest of the filtered solution (total of ∼13 ml).\n14. Transfer the filtrated solution of intestinal crypts into a 15-ml tube.",
    "Replacing the 50-ml tube with a 15-ml tube is crucial to achieve a well-defined pellet after centrifugation and avoid losing material.\n15. Centrifuge once for 4 min at 500 × g, 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant. If a red coloration of the pellet is observed due to the presence of blood cells, proceed to step 16, otherwise go to step 17.\n16. Resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Then, add 5 ml of DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA medium to filtrated solution. Centrifuge 4 min at 500 × g, 4°C, and aspirate the supernatant.\n17. Wash the pellet 2 times with 3 ml of DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA. Each time, spin 4 min at 500 × g, 4°C, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nDome-organoid seeding in 24-well plate\n18. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA and transfer the solution containing intestinal crypts into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Spin for 4 min at 500 × g, room temperature.\nBudget-friendly note: For economic reasons, DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA has been extensively tested to replace IntestiCult in this step.\nDo not aspirate the totality of the supernatant. Leave a thin layer of DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA (∼30 μl). Then, resuspend carefully the pellet in it, avoiding bubbles.\n19. Resuspend the final pellet (+ thin layer of DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA) in undiluted Cultrex. Avoiding bubble formation. A dome of 50 μl of Cultrex-intestinal crypt solution is plated per well of a warmed 24-well plate.",
    "The volume of Cultrex depends on the pellet size obtained from the biopsy. Usually, a pellet coming from ∼300 mg of biopsy is plated into 4 to 6 domes. Consequently, a volume of 4 × 50 μl = 200 μl Cultrex or 6 × 50 μl = 300 μl Cultrex can be used.\nWith this density, a notable growth of the organoid cultures is achieved. Of important note, when seeded at a very high density, cells in the center of the dome will die. Conversely, seeding cells too sparsely can hinder cell growth due to the lack of neighboring cell signals. The standard growth timeline is shown in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0002].\nBudget-friendly note: Alternatively, Cultrex can be replaced by Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd63f8ce-101f-4b16-8451-c62ba879d92c/cpz1943-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nLong-term culture of PDCOs.

Scale bars, 150 μm. (C) Experimental workflow of PDCO passage. In brief, PDCO-domes are disrupted to fragment organoids. Fragments are seeded back in BME domes to achieve PDCO expansion.\n20. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO2 to allow dome solidification.\n21. Once dome solidification is achieved, remove the 24-well plate from the incubator and add 500 μl of IntestiCult medium supplemented with 10 μM of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to each single well, as well as 50 ng/ml of Wnt3a for healthy tissue exclusively.\nFreshly prepare a mix of IntestiCult + Y-27632 for the total amount of wells containing domes.",
    "ROCK inhibitor improves the survival rates of cells by preventing dissociation-induced apoptosis. Therefore, it is exclusively added when domes are seeded after biopsy processing or after a passage, but not for routine maintenance of the dome-organoid cultures.\nWnt3a must be supplemented in the medium of healthy colon organoids, because IntestiCult has been developed to propagate and maintain tumor colon organoids, in which Wnt/β-catenin pathway is over-activated. This pathway is known to be crucial for intestinal organoid growth. Hence the necessity to add Wnt3a in healthy colon organoids to activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway, but not in the tumor ones.\nBudget-friendly note: Murine Wnt3a (muWnt3a) is preferred to the human Wnt3a (huWnt3a) from the same supplier, because in our hands (1) muWnt3a led to a higher yield of organoid propagation than the huWnt3a, and (2) muWnt3a is cheaper than the huWnt3a.\n22. Incubate the plate at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 2 weeks until the first passage. Refresh the medium every two days with 500 μl of IntestiCult only for tumor organoids and of IntestiCult supplemented with Wtn3a for healthy organoids.\nBudget-friendly note: Alternatively, when dealing with a newly established organoid culture (<2 weeks), IntestiCult solution can be replaced as follows: 750 μl for 5 days, and 500 μl for the following three days from Friday to Sunday. This workflow will allow notable savings on the budget without impairing organoid growth. Days and cognate volumes have been extensively tested to allow both optimal growth of the organoid cultures and to deal with a tight budget.",
    "This protocol aims to maintain and expand PDCO cultures in BME domes, here Cultrex-domes. The goal is to perform different downstream assays, such as lentiviral transduction, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, or RT-qPCR. Cultrex-organoid dome cultures are passaged every 1 to 2 weeks depending on the confluency and the morphology of the organoids. Indeed, large doughnut-like organoids and budding ones have been observed to produce robust and fertile fragments leading to a sustained expansion of PDCOs (Fig. 2A and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0002]). On the contrary, small organoid (<50 µm) structures or mature ones (>250 µm) are hardly expandable due to their lack of intestinal crypts containing Lgr5+ stem cells. Briefly, domes to be passaged are mechanically disrupted by flushing them with GCDR and then filtered to obtain a solution rich in small fragments containing intestinal crypts that will self-assemble to generate novel organoids. IntestiCult is used for the maintenance and expansion of PDCOs.

    "To identify which domes need to be passaged, it is important to examine the size and shape of the organoids in the dome using phase-contrast optical microscopy. The ideal organoid shape and size for passage is illustrated in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0002] between day 10 and weeks 2 to 3.\n6. Gently wash the exposed domes with DPBS at room temperature and then discard the DPBS.\n7. Add 1 ml of GCDR on top of each dome and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\n8.

    "The final dilution is dependent on the organoid growth speed. If the organoids are growing fast, a dilution of 1:4 is recommended. Otherwise, the standard dilution is 1:2. For instance, if four domes need to be passaged according to a standard dilution of 1:2, the final number of domes will be 8. As 50 µl of Cultrex per dome are needed, the total necessary volume of Cultrex will be 400 µl. The dilution ratio will proportionally impact the number of seeded wells.\n19.

    "Cryopreservation of PDCOs is essential for biobanking, which is crucial in any pre-clinical study. The first step of this protocol is to select domes featuring most of the organoids in a doughnut-like shape (shown in Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0002]).

Then, newly passaged Cultrex-dome organoid cultures are mechanically disrupted by flushing and incubating them with GCDR. The solution containing organoid fragments from 2 domes pooled together is then washed at 4°C, centrifuged, and the corresponding pellet is resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold CryoStor CS10 and transferred into a cryovial.

Organoid domes selected for freezing are passaged 4 days prior to this step (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-prot-0002]) to maximize post-thaw recovery. This ensures that the organoids are in the logarithmic growth phase at the time of cryopreservation. The shape and size of the organoids at this stage are illustrated in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0002].\n3. Gently wash the domes once with DPBS at room temperature and then discard the DPBS.\n4. Add 1 ml of GCDR on top of each dome and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\n5. Mechanically break down each dome using a P1000 pipette tip and pipet GCDR up and down above the dome to create a disruptive flow.\nAvoid touching the side and the bottom of the well with the tip.\n6. Transfer the resulting solution containing dome chunks in a 15-ml centrifuge tube.

Moreover, CryoStor CS10 being commercially available strengthens the repeatability of this protocol, which would have been harder to pursue with FBS known for its variability from batch to batch.\n12. Transfer the cryovials overnight in a freezing container at −80°C for controlled temperature decrease.\n13.

    "This protocol aims to generate tumor or healthy PDCOs in which genes are silenced using lentiviral transduction to investigate their function. It has been established with a GFP lentiviral vector but can be applicable with any shRNA plasmid. Lentivirus manipulation requires to work under aseptic culture conditions with adapted BSC (BSL2+) and PPE. This protocol is divided into several major steps, as depicted in the workflow presented in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0003]. The first step is the production of lentiviral particles containing the plasmid of interest by HEK293T cells. The concentration of lentiviral particles is quantified using the Lenti-X RT-qPCR Titration kit from Takara, which is a crucial step to determine the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Then, PDCOs are disrupted into a single-cell suspension solution by TrypLE, after which they are transduced with TransDux MAX reagent for 72 hr in InstestiCult (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0004]). A notable transduction has been achieved at an MOI of 4000 (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0004] for MOIs of 1000 and 4000; other MOIs are shown in supplementary Figure 1; lower magnification for MOIs 1000 to 6000 is shown in supplementary Figure 2; see Supporting Information). Finally, the single-cell suspension is pelleted and resuspended in Cultrex to enable the seeding of Cultrex-domes containing transduced intestinal crypts. After 8 days, the antibiotic selection starts as shown in Figure 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0004]. Given the length and complexity of Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-prot-0004], detailed time considerations are provided directly within the respective protocol sections.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/04852e6f-ccb7-47df-9c9e-b36cb6088a3e/cpz1943-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Workflow of lentiviral transduction of PDCOs. In brief, lentiviral particles containing the vector of interest, here a GFP expression plasmid, are first produced by transduction of HEK293T.

After 72 hr of incubation, cells are seeded back in domes to enable the formation of organoids.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4574ae37-a8b2-4538-a699-14213e3c51ff/cpz1943-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nLentiviral transduction of PDCOs.

Do not seed too many cells to avoid over-confluency and the impairment of lentiviral particle production at day 4 and day 5.",
    "Budget-friendly note: In-house production of lentiviruses, whenever allowed by adequate infrastructures, is a significant budget-saving approach. Besides, the use of a bigger material format (i.e., T150 flasks) can maximize the amount of obtained particles thereby minimizing batch variability.\nDay 2 (end of the day): Calcium phosphate transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids allowing the production of lentiviral particles (∼1 hr)\n2. Prepare the transfection mix in a 15-ml conical tube per condition (i.e., per T150 flask):\n         \n1100 μl milliQ H2O\n8 μg of plasmid of interest (shRNA or lentiviral GFP as a control)\n6 μg of pCMV-dR8.91(Delta 8.9) packaging expression vector for lentivirus production encoding the gag, pol, and rev genes\n4 μg of VSV-G plasmid expressing the viral envelope\n170 μl of 2 M CaCl2\n3. Add dropwise 1200 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (HeBS) to the mix; vortex immediately.\nVortexing immediately is important; therefore, process samples sequentially one at a time.\n4. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\n5. Add the mix dropwise to the T150 flask. Gently shake the flask to homogenize the solution.\n6. Incubate overnight in the incubator at 37°C under 5% CO2.\nBudget-friendly note: The authors’ choice to use the “traditional” transfection technique with calcium phosphate relies on 2 strong assets. (1) It is the cheapest approach to generate lentiviral particles. (2) It works very efficiently to transfect HEK293T cells, leading to an extremely cost-effective step.\nDay 3 (morning): Medium refresh (∼10 min)\nManipulation of lentivirus requires to perform experiments below a dedicated safety cabinet (BSL2+) and to be properly equipped and protected while handling lentivirus (days 3, 4 and 5).\n7. Change the medium of HEK293T cells, with 30 ml fresh complete DMEM medium complemented with 10% FBS and pen-strep, to prevent toxicity due to the transfection reagent.",
    "Day 4 (morning): Collection of lentiviral particles at ∼40 hr post-transfection (∼2 hr)\n8. Collect the supernatant of HEK293T containing the lentiviral particles and filter it using a 0.2-μm membrane.\n9. Divide the lentivirus-containing medium into 500 µl aliquots labeled beforehand and kept on ice.\n10. Freeze the cryovials at −80°C.\nThis will constitute your stock of lentiviral particles collected at ∼40 hr post-transfection.\n11. Add 30 ml of fresh medium to HEK293T cells (DMEM with 10% FBS and pen-strep)\nDay 5 (morning): Collection of lentiviral particles at 72 hr post-transfection (∼2 hr)\nLentiviral particles harvested at the different times post-transfection originate from the same HEK293T flask; only the medium is changed at step 11.\n12. Repeat the same steps on day 4 above (steps 8 to 10).\nThis will constitute your stock of lentiviral particles collected at 72 hr post-transfection.\nBudget-friendly note: (1) Collecting both at ∼40 hr- and 72 hr-post transfection, instead to only once, allows to increase at least by 2-fold the number of lentiviral particles that will be produced within a single experiment. It is a gain of time and money, since between the 2 collection days, the only requirement is to add the low-cost DMEM complete medium. (2) Because of their sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles, the lentiviral particles must be frozen and can be thawed only once to be able to perform all the experiments required, on the short-term and on the long-term, under the same conditions, meaning with the same potency of infection. That is the reason why lentiviral particles are frozen before the titration.\nTitration of lentiviral particles with the Lenti-X RT-qPCR titration kit (0.5 day)",
    "The titration of lentiviral particles is a prerequisite to the calculation of the MOI value, which is the number of particles that can potentially infect a single cell, essential to the transduction process. First, RNA will be extracted and purified from the lentiviral particles. Then, the subsequent lentiviral genomic RNA will be amplified and quantified by qRT-PCR.\nExtraction and purification of lentiviral genomic RNA\n13. Follow the guidelines of NucleoSpin RNA virus kit.\nThis kit is an additional purchase, it is not included in the Lenti-X RT-qPCR titration kit.\nPay attention to treat your RNA samples with DNaseI to remove residual plasmid DNA coming from the transient transfection of HEK293T cells. This step will dilute your RNA sample at 1:2 (important to keep in mind for the final calculation of the titration).\nTitration of lentiviral genomic RNA by RT-qPCR\n14. Follow the guidelines of Lenti-X RT-qPCR Titration kit.\nLentiviral transduction and culture of colon organoids\nDay 1: Generation of a single cell suspension of colon organoids (∼1.5 hr)\nThis step aims to gently break the maturing colon organoids (7 to 14 days old) into a single cell suspension in order to monitor with accuracy the number of cells/ml, leading to the establishment of an accurate MOI.\n15. Depending on your experimental design (i.e., the number of conditions), select the appropriate number of domes to be passaged.\nFor example, in our hands, we have dilution ratios ranging from 1:2 and 1:3 depending on the density of the organoids inside each dome, meaning that we need 3 or 2 domes, respectively, if we want to seed 6 domes with transduced cells.",
    "Do not forget to consider the killing control condition in the experimental design, in which cells will not be transduced. This is a crucial control for the antibiotic-based selection step (at day 12).\n16. Wash the selected domes twice with DPBS.\n17. Add 500 μl of TrypLE on top of the exposed dome in each well. Pipet the TrypLE in the well up and down 3 to 4 times to break up the dome and the organoids. Using the same pipette tip, transfer the organoid mixture to a 15-ml conical tube.\n18. Repeat the previous step with 150 μl of TrypLE to ensure all pieces of BME have been recovered from the plate.\n19. Incubate for 20 min at 37°C on an orbital tube rotator (∼400 rpm).\n20. Centrifuge the cells 4 min at 500 × g, room temperature. Gently pour off and discard the supernatant.\n21. Add 1 ml/dome passed of DMEM/F-12 + 15 mM HEPES + 1% BSA to each 15-ml conical tube and count the cells.\nOn average, we reach a suspension of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml.\n22. In a 24-well plate, seed in IntestiCult, 80,000 cells/well for a total volume of 200 μl in each condition (i.e., for each batch of lentiviral particles and/or MOI).\n23. Prepare the mix of transduction in an Eppendorf tube, or a 15-ml conical tube (depending on the final volume), as shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-tbl-0002].\nAlways prepare a larger volume of the mix preparation (e.g., corresponding to the desired number of wells + 1 well).\nIt is crucial to add the Y-27623 to the mix to increase the survival of the freshly seeded cells. We observed important cell death when it was not included.",
    "Budget-friendly note: Polybrene, which is a cheap transduction reagent, was first used to achieve the transduction of the colon single-cell suspension solution. However, each attempt failed. That is the reason why we have switched to the use of TransDux MAX lentivirus transduction reagent, which is more expensive, but it is worth the price (as designed here, with 1 kit you can perform 100 transductions).\nTable 2.\n                Details of the Transduction Mix Using TransDux MAX Technology in a 24-Well Plate Format (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-prot-0004])\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagents,1 well (ml),6 well (ml)\nTransDux MAX,2.5,15\nMAX enhancer,100,600\nY-27632 (10 mM),0.25,1.5\nIntestiCult,200,1200\nVolume of the mix/well,∼300 ml,\nTotal volume/well,∼500 ml,\n24. Add the proper number of lentiviral particles.\nUsing lentiviral particles (bearing a plasmid for GFP expression) ranging from a MOI of 100 to 6000, we have identified MOI 4000 as a relevant dose to achieve lentiviral transduction of the colon single cell suspension (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0004] for MOIs of 1000 and 4000; other MOIs are shown in supplementary Figure 1; lower magnification for MOIs 1000 to 6000 are shown in supplementary Figure 2).\n25.

Gently tap with your finger on the 24-well plate to homogenize the solution.\nDay 4: Back to 3D-dome culture (∼1 hr)\nAt this step, the single-cell suspension is very heterogeneous with some of the transduced cells in suspension and others adherent.

    "28. Prepare DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES and 1% BSA and keep it on ice.\nBSA is crucial to prevent the biopsy pieces to stick on the plastics and consequently lose material.\n29. Thaw on ice Cultrex, for each well of a 24-well plate.\nBudget-friendly note: Alternatively, Cultrex can be replaced by Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix.\nb. Dome seeding\n30. Transfer the supernatant of each well in a sterile Eppendorf tube, to collect the cells in suspension.\n31. Rinse each well with 200 μl of DPBS at room temperature and transfer the supernatant to the corresponding Eppendorf tube.\n32. Add 150 μl of Accutase in each well to detach gently the adherent cells. Incubate 5 min at 37°C. Under the microscope, double-check that all cells are detached and transfer the supernatant to the corresponding Eppendorf tubes.\nAt this step, Accutase is preferred over TrypLE, because Accutase has a milder action. It preserves cell clusters that appear 72 hr after transduction, which allows faster growth and regeneration of organoids. TrypLE has a stronger digestive activity, which would destroy cell clusters.\n33. Centrifuge the cells 4 min at 500 × g, room temperature. Gently pour off and discard the supernatant.\n34. Add 60 μl of Cultrex per condition. Gently homogenize the cell pellet by doing up and down with the pipette.\n35. Seed each dome in a well of 24-well plate.\n36. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO2 to allow dome solidification.\n37. Once dome solidification is achieved, remove the 24-well plate from the incubator and add 500 μl of IntestiCult medium supplemented with 10 μM of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to each single well, as well as 50 ng/ml of Wnt3a for healthy tissue exclusively.",

Start the selection by adding puromycin at 5 µg/ml in IntestiCult.\nThe selection process can last from 3 to 7 days, depending on the outcome of the killing control (organoids without plasmid). When all the cells in the killing control condition have died, the selection is considered effective.\nHere, puromycin was used because the plasmid we used displayed a resistance marker to this antibiotic. While using other antibiotics, their concentration will need to be optimized.\n40. Refresh the medium as described above with puromycin at 5 µg/ml:\n         \n750 μl of IntestiCult + puromycin from Monday to Friday.\n500 μl of IntestiCult + puromycin from Friday to Monday.",
    "Originally, this immunoblotting protocol was developed to be able to extract and detect proteins from a single Cultrex-organoid dome as shown in Figure 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0005]. However, our first experiments revealed that the abundance of clathrin (CHC) varies from one dome to another. Since clathrin is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in a canonic endocytic mechanism which ensures housekeeping cellular functions, its protein abundance generally correlates with the amount of cellular material present in a sample. In theory, CHC abundance should thus remain constant from dome to dome, given that the same volume of crypt solution has been seeded in each dome. Thus, the observed variations in the CHC abundance between domes likely reflect some variability in the number of organoids which effectively implanted in each dome and in their growth speed. Therefore, we eventually propose an alternative protocol in which 3 domes are pooled together to compensate this inter-dome variability and reach more homogeneous protein concentrations as shown in Figure 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0005]. This protocol can be applied to cancer biomarker discovery studies. Briefly, PDCO-domes are disrupted using TrypLE, washed and then incubated with a lysis buffer in reducing conditions to enable protein extraction. Then, proteins from the lysates are separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system. Finally, the proteins of interest are detected by western blot and revealed by chemiluminescence.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ffbef8ad-6669-4c7f-b220-27f3461afdc6/cpz1943-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

Transfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube.\nAt this step, you can stop and store the sample at −20°C for up to a year.\nElectrophoresis separation and semi-dry transfer\n12. Add the loading buffer (1× final) to each sample to denature the proteins in reductive conditions and heat at 95°C for 10 min.\n13. Fill up the electrophoresis tank with migration buffer (1×) containing SDS to allow proteins to migrate according to their molecular weight.\n14.

Allow the migration at 160 to 180 V for 35 to 50 min depending on the size of the proteins of interest.\n16. Perform semi-dry transfer using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system and following Bio-Rad guidelines (3 to 10 min).",
    "Budget-friendly notes: (1) Be aware that the transfer stacks and the transfer buffer sold in the kit are both reusable under the following conditions. The transfer buffer must be filtered to remove the remaining pieces of gel, and the transfer stacks must be extensively but cautiously washed under tap water and then rinsed once with deionized water. Following these recommendations, the transfer stacks can be used a dozen of times if their handling has been gentle. (2) As an alternative to the purchase of the kit and the Bio-Rad transfer buffer, a homemade transfer buffer can be prepared (see Reagents and Solutions). The homemade transfer buffer proposed is adapted to wet transfer systems. Wet transfer is much slower (2 hr) than Turbo transfer, but it can often give better results for proteins that are difficult to transfer (e.g., high molecular weight). In addition, instead of using the transfer stacks found in the kit, SureLock tandem midi sponge kit (reusable) or western blotting filter paper can be used for similar high efficiency of transfer on both PVDF and nitrocellulose membranes.\n17. Incubate the membranes in a blocking buffer containing 5% BSA with 0.05% of Tween 20 in DPBS (referred to DPBST 5% BSA), for at least 45 min at room temperature, on an orbital shaker.\nAlternatively, an overnight incubation at 4°C can be performed on a rocker.\n18. Dilute the primary antibody (anti-clathrin heavy chain, anti-VPS28 and anti-PTP1B) in DPBST 5% BSA at the concentration recommended by the company.\nA dilution of 1:1000 was used for each of the three primary antibodies that we used (CHC, VPS28, PTP1B). The dilution must be optimized for each new antibody.\n19. Incubate the primary antibody on the membrane overnight at 4°C.",
    "Alternatively, and for non-phosphorylated proteins only, DPBST with 5% milk can be used as a stronger blocking buffer to decrease non-specific antibody binding. But be aware that milk powder can sometimes go sour on your membrane, especially during summertime.\n20. Wash the membrane 3 times for 5 min, at room temperature in DPBST 5% BSA.\n21. Repeat steps 17 to 19 with a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) coupled to HRP and incubate the membrane for 30 min to 45 min at room temperature.\nA dilution of 1:5000 was used for HRP-coupled secondary antibodies that we used.\nChemiluminescence reaction and revelation\n22. Use Pierce ECL western blotting substrate for revelation in chemiluminescence, if your proteins are well expressed and you expect a strong signal, such as for clathrin or tubulin. Alternatively, use SuperSignal West Femto substrate for revelation if your proteins have a weaker expression or if you expect a weak signal. Follow the supplier guidelines.\n23. Monitor chemiluminescence signals with any western blot imager commercially available.",
    "This protocol aims to easily achieve high resolution confocal microscopy on PDCOs in order, for instance, to assess their maturation status or determine the localization of specific markers at the subcellular level (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006]-B). An important step in this protocol is to use the adapted devices developed for microscopy. Consequently, after passage, Cultrex-organoid dome cultures are seeded in Lab-Tek chambers (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006]), which have a glass bottom adapted to imaging by confocal and high-resolution microscopy devices displaying an inverted configuration. Once PDCOs grown in IntestiCult in the Lab-Tek containers have reached maturation, they are fixed with 4% PFA at 4°C, residues of PFA are quenched with NH4Cl, and cells are permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Then, primary and secondary antibodies are incubated with the Cultrex-domes to label the PDCOs. After extensive washing steps, PDCOs are ready for imaging.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1199d079-42c5-409a-87fe-bee16c2a49c4/cpz1943-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nPDCOs imaged by high resolution confocal microscopy after immunofluorescence labeling.

In addition, it will protect the Lab-Tek from scratches on the glass bottom, which is crucial for microscopy.",
    "2. Maintain the Cultrex-organoid domes from 2 to 4 weeks until you reach PDCO maturation, that can be assessed by monitoring organoid morphology (see Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006]-B). Refresh the medium every other day with 250 μl of complete IntestiCult.\nIt was noticed that Cultrex domes are less adherent on glass than on plastic. Consequently, carefully remove the medium to be discarded, using a Pasteur pipette with an elongated glass tip to ensure less disturbance of the dome. Moreover, perform smooth movements to avoid flushing the dome.\nPDCO fixation\n3. On the day of the experiment, carefully wash the dome cultures once with DPBS at room temperature.\n4. Carefully discard DPBS using a Pasteur pipette as mentioned above.\n5. Fix with 4% PFA 30 min at 4°C.\nDo not incubate with PFA longer than 30 min to avoid potential destruction of the Culrex-domes.\n6. Quench PFA remnants with a 15 min incubation in 50 mM NH4Cl solution at room temperature.\nAt this step, you can keep the plate at 4°C for up to 3 weeks on a flat and still shelf. Every other day, double-check on the volume present in each well. In case of evaporation, refill the wells with the same NH4Cl solution.\nTo keep on long-term storage and avoid potential contamination, it is also possible to add sodium azide.\nPDCO permeabilization and blocking\n7. Then, permeabilize the Cultrex-organoid domes with a solution of DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at room temperature.\n8. Carefully discard the Triton X-100 solution.\n9. Incubate the Cultrex-organoid domes with blocking buffer for 1.5 hr at room temperature. The blocking buffer is composed of 10% FBS, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS.\nAlternatively, if more convenient, the blocking step can be performed at 4°C for 4 hr.\nPDCO fluorescence labeling",
    "10. Carefully discard the blocking buffer solution without disturbing the domes.\n11. Incubate primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer on top of the Cultrex-organoid domes for 16 hr at 4°C on a flat and still shelf.\nIn Figure 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006], phalloidin was used at 1:500 to visualize microvilli brush borders of enterocytes. In addition, in Figure 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006], an anti-CDX2 antibody was used at 1:200 to reveal intestinal progenitor cells. Of note, you are free to use any other classical markers at this stage, such as MUC2 (goblet cell marker), Sox9 (crypt marker), CGA (enteroendocrine cell marker), ZO-1 (tight-junction marker), or EPCAM (basolateral epithelium marker).\n12. Carefully discard the primary antibody solution without disturbing the domes. Gently wash once with 350 μl per well of blocking buffer.\nThis step does not require extensive washing considering how fragile is the adherence of the domes on the Lab-Tek glass bottom.\n13. Incubate Cultrex-organoid domes with DAPI and the secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature on a flat and still shelf, protected from light.\nIn Figure 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0006], DAPI was used at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml to visualize the nucleus and secondary antibodies Alexa fluor were used at 1:1000.\nDAPI staining is included in all PDCO immunofluorescence labeling assays to visualize the nucleus of all the cells present in the PDCO. It is also used to set up the focus of the confocal microscope.\n14. Carefully discard the secondary antibody solution without disturbing the domes. Carefully, wash three times with 350 μl per well of blocking buffer.\nThis step requires extensive, but cautious washes to remove the free antibodies.\nAt this step, Cultrex-organoid domes can be stored in DPBS at 4°C, on the flat and still shelf up to 2 weeks, protected from light.",
    "PDCOs high-resolution imaging with Zeiss LSM900 Airyscan 2\n15. Perform the focus settings with DAPI staining through the objectives.\nSince PDCOs are embedded in a dome of Cultrex, long working-distance objectives are required. In our case, we imaged PDCOs with a dry plan apochromatic 20× objective with a numerical aperture of 0.8. Airyscan 2 module allows to reach lateral resolution beyond the diffraction limit, up to 120 nm. For the best resolution images, higher magnification objectives (e.g., 63×) can be used. Of note, alternative confocal microscopy devices can also be used.",
    "This protocol enables the extraction of mRNA from organoid-domes and the subsequent analysis of target gene expression through RT-qPCR. It allows for the comparison of gene expression under various conditions, such as tumor organoids vs healthy organoids after a specific treatment (Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-fig-0007]). In summary, PDCO-domes are disrupted using TrypLE, washed, and then incubated with a lysis buffer to facilitate mRNA extraction. Starting from mRNA, cDNA is generated using reverse transcriptase and specific primers. The cDNA is then analyzed using qPCR. For this type of analysis, it is recommended to pool at least three domes together and perform the extraction on the pooled sample. This approach ensures there is sufficient material and reduces variability between domes derived from the same donor, as previously mentioned in Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.943#cpz1943-prot-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b0490f10-cc86-42e1-a820-95af203a4287/cpz1943-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nEvaluation of mRNA expression in tumor and healthy PDCOs by RT-qPCR.
