This method consists of the following two procedures: 1) immunofluorescence microscopy combined with local UV irradiation (described above), and 2) quantitative image analysis.\nCell culture and local UVC irradiation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe following steps enable induction of UV-induced photolesions to local subnuclear area.\nTrypsinize U2OS cells stably expressing EGFP-XPC and measure the cell density with a hemocytometer.\nPlate 3.0 × 105 cells per 35 mm glass bottom dish and culture the cells for 16–20 h.\nOptional: If any protein of interest needs to be expressed transiently by plasmid transfection, 1.0 × 105 cells are usually seeded in a 35 mm glass bottom dish and cultured for 16–20 h. After transfection with 2 μg of the expression construct, cells are cultured for additional 2 days and subjected to the following UVC irradiation. For the details and an example of such experiments, refer to our previous paper.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nLocal UVC irradiation through polycarbonate isopore membrane filters (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIrradiate the cells with UVC through the filter as described above (refer to the section ‘confirmation of the functionality of EGFP-XPC by immunofluorescence staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]’).\nAdd 2 mL of the standard growth medium. Carefully remove the floating filter.\nCulture the cells at 37°C for the desired time period.\nImmunofluorescence staining and microscopic observation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe following steps are aimed at visualizing localization of the factors of interest at LUD sites.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nFixation.",
    "Optional: In some cases, it is worth considering that cells are first incubated on ice for 20 min with 1 mL of the pre-extraction buffer and then immediately subjected to paraformaldehyde fixation. This washes out proteins in the nucleoplasm or loosely bound to chromatin, so that relatively weak localization at LUD sites may become more evident.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min at 25°C with 1 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nPermeabilization.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min on ice with 1 mL of 0.5% Triton X-100.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 37°C with 1 mL of 20% FBS to block nonspecific antibody binding.\nPrimary antibody reaction.\nWash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS.\nDilute the primary antibody recognizing the target protein of interest with 5% FBS to an appropriate concentration.\nNote: In our previous study (Kusakabe et al., 2022), for instance, we used anti-acetyl histone H3 (Lys27) (Clone#: MABI0309) at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] We usually start with this antibody concentration, while it may need to be adjusted experimentally depending on the target protein and antibody used.\nIncubate the cells for 16–20 h at 4°C with an appropriate volume of primary antibody solution (e.g., 100 μL for a 14 mm glass bottom hole).\nWash the cells five times with 1 mL of PBS.\nSecondary antibody reaction.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 37°C with an appropriate volume of 5% FBS containing 4 μg/mL Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody (e.g., 100 μL for a 14 mm glass bottom hole).\nWash the cells five times with 1 mL of PBS.\nCounterstaining.",
    "Incubate the cells for 10 min at 25°C with 1 mL of PBS containing 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342.\nWash the cells five times with 1 mL of PBS.\nMount the cells under a round coverslip (11 mm diameter) with 5 μL of the Vectashield mounting medium.\nNote: After preparing the immunofluorescence samples, we usually proceed to the following microscopic observation immediately. If it is necessary to store the samples, refer to the Note in the section: ‘confirmation of the functionality of EGFP-XPC by immunofluorescence staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] step 19-r’.\nTurn on the confocal laser scanning microscope, excitation lasers (405, 488, and 594 nm), and image acquisition software.\nNote: For the image acquisition procedure described below, we use the FV-3000 confocal laser scanning microscope and accompanying FV31S-SW software (Evident). The detail of the microscopic system is described in ‘Materials and Equipment‘.\nSelect a 40× objective lens (UplanSApo ×40, numerical aperture: 0.95) and focus on the sample.\nFor acquisition of fluorescence images of Hoechst 33342, EGFP, and Alexa Fluor 594, set three channels with the parameters for excitation and emission as shown in the table below. Then, set the Airy Units to 1.00 AU in all channels.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2771_6.csv\nSet image resolution to 1024 × 1024-pixels with 1× digital zoom (pixel size: 0.31 μm) and scan speed to 10 μsec/pixel.\nSet LUT to Hi-Lo mode and click “Live“ to display the fluorescence signals.\nAdjust the laser powers to the appropriate values, such that all channels show substantial levels of fluorescence signals without saturation.\nNote: We usually tune up the laser powers only, while the sensitivity of PMT is fixed at 500 HV. Typically, starting points of the laser powers are 0.05% for Hoechst 33342 and EGFP, and 0.01% for Alexa Fluor 594.\nAcquire fluorescence images from a single focal plane (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2771-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Image analyses for assessing the localization of factors of interest at LUD sites\n(A) U2OSDDB2 KO cells stably expressing EGFP-XPC were irradiated with UVC (400 J/m2) through the isopore membrane filter. After incubation for 30 min, cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining with an anti-H3K27ac antibody. A representative image of EGFP fluorescence is shown. Based on the EGFP signals, UV-irradiated areas and the corresponding nuclei were demarcated and set as ROIs. The yellow arrowhead indicates a ROI used as background. Scale bar: 50 μm.\n(B) Enlarged fluorescence images of Cells 1 and 2 shown in (A). Scale bars: 10 μm.\n(C) Schematic representation of the image quantification with Fiji/ImageJ. As a model analysis, the immunofluorescence image shown in (A) was used. After the image was selected, ROI manager was opened (1). ROIs were determined and registered to ROI manager by clicking “add [t]” (bold circle) (2). After registering all ROIs, the information of ROIs was saved by clicking “More” (bold circle) and “Save…” (3). For choosing the fluorescence signal of factors of interest, the multichannel image was separated, and the signal of Alexa Fluor 594 was picked up (4). Then, the parameters used for image quantification were selected in “Set measurements” and obtained by clicking “Measure” (bold circle) (5–6).",
    "(D) Quantification of the relative fluorescence intensity (FI) of H3K27ac in Cells 1 and 2. The area and total FI were measured for each ROI, and the mean FI per pixel was calculated by dividing the total FI by the area. If there were multiple LUD sites like in Cell 2, the sums of the area and total FI were used to calculate the mean FI at LUD sites. The relative FI at LUD sites was calculated by the formula described in 27 of the section titled ‘step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]’.\nImage analysis with ImageJ\nTiming: 1 day\nThe following image analyses accomplish a quantitative assessment of localization of the factors upon local UVC irradiation.\nOpen the acquired multichannel image with Fiji/ImageJ.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nNote: We confirmed that the image quantification procedure described below works in Fiji which builds on ImageJ2 version 2.9.0/1.53t.\nDetermine three regions of interest (ROIs) as follows: 1) the UVC-irradiated area demarcated with fluorescence of EGFP-XPC (D), 2) the entire cell nucleus (N), and 3) the area outside of any cell as a background (BKG) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).\nFor opening ROI manager, click “analyze,” “tools,” and “ROI manager...” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIn ImageJ toolbar, choose “Rectangle” to determine a ROI for BKG, or “Polygon selections” to determine ROIs for D and N (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAfter creating a ROI, click “Add [t]” and register it in the ROI manager one by one (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAfter finishing registration of all ROIs, click “More” and “Save...” and then save the ROI data. Keep opening the data of ROIs until extracting fluorescence of Alexa Fluor 594 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAlternatives: Although we manually determine each ROI, an alternative method has been recently developed, which is based on ImageJ macro and automatically determines regions of LUD sites.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]",
    "Separate the multichannel image into individual fluorescence images by clicking “Image,” “Stacks,” and “Stack to Images” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nSelect the Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence image.\nTo register the parameters for measurement, click “Analyze” and “Set Measurements…” and select “Area” and “Integrated density,” which represents total fluorescence intensity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nFor acquiring the fluorescence intensity in each ROI, click “Measure” in ROI manager toolbar and save the results as a csv file (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nOpen the results file, and then copy and paste the data (Label, Area, and Integrated density) into a new Excel file.\nDetermine the mean fluorescence intensities per pixel by dividing the integrated density by the area in Excel software. Then, define the mean fluorescence intensity per pixel corresponding to D, N, and BKG as FD, FN, and FBKG, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCalculate the relative fluorescence intensities at the LUD site (FR) using the following formula:\nF\nR\n=\n(\nF\nD\n−\nF\nB\nK\nG\n)\n(\nF\nN\n−\nF\nB\nK\nG\n)\nNote: We usually analyze over 50 cells in each condition from a single experiment.\nNote: In this protocol, we define LUD sites by the areas with accumulating EGFP fluorescence. As with the description in the steps of Before you begin 12–20, monoclonal antibodies against UV-induced photolesions generated in mice have been widely used to demarcate UVC-irradiated regions by immunofluorescence staining.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] However, because many reliable monoclonal antibodies against histone modifications were also generated in mice,17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] the simultaneous use of these antibodies for immunofluorescence staining is difficult. To circumvent such a problem, we choose EGFP-XPC as a marker of LUD sites in this protocol.\nAssessing the repair kinetics of UV-induced 6-4PPs in cultured cells",
    "Here, we describe a method that is applicable for assessing the kinetics of removal of UV-induced 6-4PPs in cultured cells. This method mainly consists of the following three procedures: 1) global UVC irradiation of cells cultured in a 96-well plate, 2) immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) quantitative image analysis.\nCell culture and global UVC irradiation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe following steps enable global UVC irradiation to cultured cells in a 96-well glass bottom plate.\nTrypsinize U2OS cells and measure the cell density with a hemocytometer.\nPlate 3.0 × 104 cells per well of a sterile 96-well glass bottom plate (non-coated, glass thickness: 0.16–0.19 mm, GP96000, Matsunami Glass Industry). Then, culture the cells for 16–20 h.\nNote: Appropriate treatment of the glass bottom plate may be necessary depending on cell lines used.\nUVC irradiation to assess repair kinetics.\nNote: Cells seeded on the same plate may need to be treated with UVC at different doses and/or timings. To this end, we use a 96-strip-well microplate as a cover to protect cells in unintended wells from UVC. With this method, therefore, experiments should be designed such that cells in the same column of a plate are treated simultaneously with the same dose of UVC. It is also important to confirm that the two plates have the same well positions.\nUsing a multichannel micropipette, carefully remove the growth medium from a column of wells that are subjected to UVC irradiation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2771-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic procedure for UVC irradiation using a 96-well glass bottom plate\n(A) Before global UVC irradiation, the medium was removed from a column of wells subjected to UVC irradiation (indicated by the yellow square).",
    "(B) An 8-strip well corresponding to the column for UVC irradiation was removed from the strip-well plate. During UVC irradiation, the 96-well glass bottom plate was overlaid with the strip-well plate to protect unintended wells from UVC.\n(C) To align the finishing time of the recovery culture, the timing of UVC irradiation was shifted for different columns, as shown in this figure. For each column of wells, the medium was removed, and UVC was irradiated through the cover of the strip-well plate. After fresh growth medium was added, the cells were incubated at 37°C for the desired time period. At the end of the recovery culture, the 96-well glass bottom plate was transferred on ice. To prepare the standard curve, UVC irradiation (5 and 10 J/m2) was performed with the cells kept on ice, and then the whole plate underwent immunofluorescence staining. Columns subjected to UV irradiation are labeled by yellow squares.\nCorresponding to the intended column position, remove an 8-well strip from the strip-well plate. Overlay the strip-well plate on the glass bottom plate containing cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIrradiate the cells with UVC at a dose of 10 J/m2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAdd 150 μL of the fresh standard growth medium to each well and incubate the plate at 37°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAfter 60 and 90 min, treat the cells in different columns of the 96-well glass bottom plate according to the procedure described in a–d (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nFurther incubate the plate at 37°C so that the recovery times after UV irradiation for individual columns are set to 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively.",
    "Note: UV irradiation at the time points of 0, 60, and 90 min corresponds to the recovery time for 120, 60, and 30 min, respectively. By shifting the timing of UVC irradiation in this way, all wells in the plate can be subjected to the following procedures in parallel.\nTransfer the plate on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUVC irradiation to prepare a standard curve for lesion quantification (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nRemove the medium from three columns of wells containing unirradiated cells.\nKeep the plate on ice and irradiate the cells in individual columns with UVC at doses of 5 and 10 J/m2.\nAfter finishing the UVC irradiation, immediately proceed to the following immunofluorescence staining.\nImmunofluorescence staining with lesion-specific antibodies and microscopic observation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe procedures described below achieve acquiring fluorescence images of 6-4PPs and DNA for quantitative image analysis.\nFixation.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min at 25°C with 2% paraformaldehyde (150 μL per well).\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nPermeabilization.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min at 25°C with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (150 μL per well).\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nDenaturation of genomic DNA.\nIncubate the cells for 20 min at 25°C in 2 M HCl (150 μL per well).\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nFor blocking nonspecific antibody binding, add 20% FBS (150 μL per well) and incubate the cells for 30 min at 25°C.\nPrimary antibody reaction.\nDilute an anti-6-4PP mouse antibody to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL with 5% FBS and incubate the cells for 16–20 h at 4°C with the primary antibody solution (50 μL per well).",
    "Note: An appropriate volume of the antibody solution should be determined. To minimize evaporation and prevent the samples from drying out, a 96-well glass bottom plate should be wrapped appropriately and/or incubated in a tight container.\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nSecondary antibody reaction.\nDilute an Alexa Fluor 405-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL with 5% FBS and incubate the cells for 60 min at 25°C with the secondary antibody solution (50 μL per well).\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nCounterstaining.\nStain nuclear DNA for 20 min at 25°C with PBS containing 1 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) (50 μL per well).\nWash the cells three times with PBS (150 μL per well).\nFill each well with 100 μL of PBS to prevent the cells from drying out.\nTurn on the confocal laser scanning microscope, excitation lasers (405 and 561 nm), and image acquisition software.\nSelect a 20× objective lens (UplanSApo ×20, numerical aperture: 0.75) and focus on the sample.\nFor acquisition of fluorescence images of Alexa Fluor 405 and PI, set two channels with the parameters for excitation and emission as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2771_7.csv\nSet the image resolution to 1024 × 1024-pixels with 1× digital zoom (pixel size: 0.62 μm) and the scan speed to 20 μsec/pixel.\nSet the Airy Units to 7.67 AU for Alexa Fluor 405 and to 5.25 AU for PI.",
    "Note: The default setting of the Airy Unit is 1.00 AU. By changing the parameters like this, the thickness of a focal plane of Alexa Fluor 405 is increased from 1149 nm to 1440 nm, and that of PI is increased from 1592 nm to 1995 nm. This increases a fraction of fluorescence captured, thereby improving accuracy of the following quantitative analysis.\nSet LUT to Hi-Lo mode and click “Live” to display the fluorescence signals.\nBy checking the fluorescence images of cells which were irradiated with UVC at 10 J/m2 and fixed immediately, adjust the laser powers to the appropriate values, such that both channels show substantial levels of fluorescence signals without saturation.\nNote: We usually tune up the laser powers only, while the sensitivity of PMT is fixed at 500 HV. Typically, starting points of the laser powers are 3.0% for Alexa Fluor 405 and 0.01% for PI.\nSet a ROI for image acquisition such that it mainly covers the central part but excludes the edge in each field of view (with a 20× objective lens, we usually set a ROI of 695 × 695 pixels near the center).\nAcquire fluorescence images from a single focal plane. We acquire at least three fluorescence images of different positions from each well.\nNote: We usually select a position, in which over 50 cells are observed.\nImage analysis with MATLAB\nTiming: 1 day\nThe following image analysis enables semi-quantification of the amount of 6-4PPs in each cell and assessment of kinetics of removal of 6-4PPs.",

The binarized fluorescence image was subjected to noise removal and gap filling (3: the MATLAB code is described in 51). The cell nuclei were demarcated, and attached cell nuclei were subsequently distinguished by watershed conversion (4–5: the MATLAB code is described in 52 and 53, respectively).
