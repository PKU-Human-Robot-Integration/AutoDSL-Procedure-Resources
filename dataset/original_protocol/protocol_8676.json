    "Mouse post mortem tissue harvest must use approved ethical methods. In the UK, cervical dislocation is a government approved method for adult mice (a listed Schedule 1 method in the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and European Directive 2010/63/EU). This legislation is enforced locally at the University of Aberdeen by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board who reviewed and approved all procedures used in the following protocol.\nNote: These methods were used in the research reported in Banks et al.7\n1. Preparing Ears for Electrophysiology\nBefore dissection, prepare a standard physiological saline, such as Liley's (1956) and saturate it with 90% O2/5% CO2. Liley's saline (mM) is comprised of: NaHCO3 (12), KCl (4), KH2PO4 (1), NaCl (138.8), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (2) and glucose (11).\nHumanely euthanize an adult mouse without damaging the skull near the ears. Here we use C57/Bl6J and MF1 mice but any standard laboratory mouse strain can be used. Ideally, use mice that are <25 g if electrical recording is to be combined with styryl dye labeling, as labeling in larger mice is less reliable, often being found only in restricted circumscribed areas.\nRemove the head with large scissors or bone shears.\nPlace the head dorsal side up in gassed Liley's in a wide-bottomed dissection dish (50 cm is usually convenient) on the stage of a stereo dissection microscope. Regularly (~10 min) sluice or submerge the head with gassed saline.",
    "Carefully incise and separate the skin at the base of the external ear (pinna) with springbow scissors and #3 forceps, exposing the cartilage of the external auditory meatus (EAM). Identify the branches of the trigeminal (mandibular division, MDV) and great auricular nerves as they emerge from the skull in the cleft of the mandibular joint and project through the cartilage base to innervate the concave (anterior) and convex (posterior) aspects of pinna skin, respectively.\nNear the skull, identify where the two nerve branches exit in the groove between the jaw and the mastoid process. Maximize their length by gently pulling the pinna away from the skull and cut the nerves as close to the skull as possible.\nRemove the pinna from the head with springbow scissors, taking care to avoid the distal stumps of the divided nerves and minimizing the amount of dense pelage at base of the ear that is removed.\nTransfer the pinna to a flexible silicone rubber (PDMS)-lined dish filled with gassed Liley's fluid. Open the EAM by dividing it at its narrowest (anterior-most) point. Flatten the pinna, anterior skin (concave) side down and pin to the PDMS carefully at the edges with ~6-8 regularly spaced very fine (~0.2 mm diameter) insect pins.\nRemove the skin of the posterior aspect of the pinna completely and partially remove the pinna cartilage by blunt dissection with #3 forceps, ensuring the anterior skin is left intact.\nWith the point of a fine insect pin grasped with #3 forceps, gently extend the branches (usually 2) of the MDV that emerge posteriorly between the skin and EAM cartilages. Pin these to the PDMS with the finest possible insect pins, impaling the connective tissue adjoining their cut ends and not the nerve trunks themselves.",
    "Remove most of the surrounding connective tissue around them, carefully avoiding damage from excess pulling or cutting.\n2. Electrophysiological Recording Set Up \nPin the pinna skin to the PDMS-lined base of a recording chamber with fine insect pins around the edges (~6-8 per ear), placing the cleaned nerves at the base of the ear near two suction electrodes – one for recording (to take the nerve) and the other an indifferent electrode (to provide the neutral signal to a differential amplifier, see7).\nFor the recording electrode, carefully match the aperture and internal diameter of the opening to the combined thickness of the two nerves, so they fit as snugly as possible and for as great a length as possible.\nDraw the nerves into the electrode by gentle suction from a 2 ml syringe attached to the other end with silicone rubber tubing. Ensure the nerves are straight, not folded or doubled up.\nDevelop a high electrical resistance/impedance fit by using stronger suction to draw connective tissue or an adipose tissue to form a plug that tightly seals the aperture around the nerve.\nFill the other (indifferent) electrode with saline by suction if necessary (it may fill by capillary action).\nPlace identical recording wires (silver or platinum) into the internal bore of the recording electrodes to contact the saline and the nerve (recording) or narrowed, fire-polished end (indifferent) of the electrode. Each electrode is soldered individually to different cores of two-core screened cable. Place the bath (ground) electrode (Ag/AgCl pellet) into the bath, and ground it to the screen of the two core cable connected to the recording electrodes.",
    "Feed the electrical activity from the two electrodes into the separate channels of a differential amplifier, filter (band-passed 0.2-2 kHz), and view on an oscilloscope screen. Check that channel A (recording) and channel B (indifferent) electrical noise levels look similar. At this stage it may not be possible to see the normal spontaneous action potentials in channel A before the two electrodes are balanced.\nRedress any differences in background noise between electrodes by increasing the impedance of the recording (channel A) or indifferent (channel B) electrodes. Do this by sucking areolar (adipose) connective tissue further into either electrode, and/or applying greater suction force on the 50 ml syringe.\n\t\nOnce 'balanced' in this way, switch back to differential (A-B) recording and look for spontaneous action potentials (APs) in the trace or when stroking hairs at the margin of the pinna. If no activity (spiking) is seen, re-check the tight fit of the nerve in the recording electrode and the areolar connective tissue in the indifferent electrode – usually the tighter (higher resistance) the seal and the more equal the impedance in the two electrodes, the better. With practice, this will achieve a good quality (>2:1) signal:noise ratio.\nRecord the electroneurogram via a lab interface and electrophysiology software running on a computer. An audio output of spiking is very useful and can be achieved by feeding the neurogram through an audio amplifier and associated audio speaker. Adjust the threshold to be just above the baseline noise (identified by the absence of white-noise 'hiss').\nTo increase drug or fluorescent styryl dye access to the lanceolate endings, carefully peel away the sub-dermal adipose layer near the pinna margin, opening a window of ~5 mm x 5 mm exposing the dermis and base of the follicles (Figure 1A, B).",
    "Pin back a fold of ~1 mm of adipose-cleared ear skin at the leading margin (at level of the window just produced, if applicable), leaving a clear saline-filled gap between the apposed skin layers. Gently stroke the hairs protruding along the folded edge with a pin or grounded fine forceps, without touching the skin, to locate the area of maximal AP output on the oscilloscope and the distinctive 'clicks' and 'pops' in the audio output.\n3. Recording Stimulus-evoked Action Potentials\nPosition the mechanical stimulation probe – a fire-polished 10 cm borosilicate microelectrode glass attached to a ceramic piezo-electric actuator – so movement is parallel with the skin fold. Place the tip about 0.5-1 mm from skin fold, so it touches the hairs but not the skin. Verify effective stimulation by slowly moving the probe tip manually to deflect the hairs and observe/listen to the spiking.\nUse the software to drive mechanical stimulation of 1-3 hairs (e.g. 3 sec at 5 Hz sinusoids, every 10 sec. Probe displacement 200-500 µm), and record the stimulation-evoked responses in the nerves.\nGive several identical mechanical stimulation trains at 10 sec intervals. Optimize the probe position for repeatability, then reduce frequency of stimulation according to experimental protocol (e.g. drop repeat rate from 10 sec to 30 sec).\nUse the software to discriminate AP-like activity e.g. using a simple threshold set to ~2x the high-frequency noise amplitude and ~25% of the largest APs.\nCount the APs crossing the threshold as 'events', quantifying the frequency and characteristics of the APs produced.\n4. Recording Stimulus-evoked Firing Combined with N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino) styryl) Pyridinium Dibromide Labeling\nTo examine the effects of styryl dyes on stimulus-evoked afferent firing and terminal labeling, add the appropriate concentration of a styryl dye of choice, to the bathing solution and continue with the electrical recording.",
    "After the required exposure time (usually at least 30 min), prepare the preparation for viewing the follicles. Unfold the skin flap by removing the retaining pins, and expose the cleared dermal area to reveal the terminal labeling.\nWash away external dye with dye-free saline, making 3 complete changes of saline.\nIncubate in the final change of gassed dye-free saline for 10-15 min to allow the most persistent dye contamination to leach from exposed/external membranes.\nRemove non-internalized dye remaining on membranes with a sequestering agent (sulfobutylated beta-cyclodextrin, 1 mM, 5 min) in saline.\nTransfer the recording chamber to the stage of an upright epifluorescence microscope and engage the chamber with the stage/slide movement mechanism.\nIlluminate the preparation with excitation light appropriate for the styryl dye. Use a 10X or 25X fluorescence microscope objective to observe the follicle labeling (Figure 1)."
