    "All in vivo procedures outlined below were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources at the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.\n1. Preparation\nUsing 32G intracranial catheter tubing with wire inset, cut 3 cm of the tubing to form a beveled end, approximately 45° to the long axis. Confirm that the wire is at least 1 cm longer than the tubing.\nLoad 50 µL of PSMA nanoparticle solution (Figure 1), or other injection material, into a Hamilton syringe. To reduce the probability of barotrauma during injection, attach the catheter tubing, with the stylet removed, to the syringe and expel dead volume.\nInspect the injection solution to ensure the nanoparticle is fully solvated to prevent ductal obstruction following the administration.\nPrepare atropine solution at 0.1 mg/mL.\n\tNOTE: Because atropine is light sensitive and degrades over time, this solution should be made the day of injection, and protected from light until administered.\n2. Accessing and Visualizing Ductal Entry Point\nWeigh C57/BL6 mice using an analytical balance.\nUsing a 0.5 mL syringe with 29G x ½\" needle, anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneally injected sterile saline solution of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Proceed to the following step when the mouse no longer responds to stimuli, which generally occurs within 5 to 10 min following the injection.\n\tNOTE: This procedure may also be performed under isoflurane, but will require a custom nose cone that permits access to the oral cavity.\nTo prevent dryness during the procedure, apply lubricant to eyes and place the mouse in a prone position on a custom stage.\n\tNOTE: To maintain appropriate conditions for intra-oral procedure, tools should be disinfected or sterilized prior to each use.",
    "Open the oral cavity by securing the maxillary incisors over a metal beam, and use an elastic band to apply downward tension behind the mandibular incisors (Figure 2A).\nAlign the mouse beneath the dissecting microscope such that the base of the jaw is visualized.\nTo widen the mouth, use a custom, curved steel retractor to apply tension bilaterally to the buccal mucosa.\nTo visualize the submandibular papillae, grasp and gently lift the tongue from the floor of the mouth using blunt forceps.\n\tNOTE: The papillae will appear as two pale protrusions beneath the tongue (Figure 2B).\nTo ease the visualization and further manipulation within the oral cavity, place cotton between the tongue and the buccal mucosa.\n3. Ductal Cannulation and Line Placement\nUsing fine, curved forceps, grasp catheter tubing with the wire inset. For optimum manual control during cannulation, align the tubing with the curvature of the forceps (Figure 3A).\nUsing the dissecting microscope, move the forceps and wire into the field of view.\n\tNOTE: The wire should be protruding from the tubing.\nGently apply pressure into the base of one submandibular papilla using the wire inset to produce a small, superficial, mucosal puncture (0.076 mm diameter) that will facilitate later entry of the catheter tubing (0.25 mm diameter). If resistance is encountered, cut fresh beveled tips on both the tubing and wire inset with sharp dissecting scissors.\nFollowing the entry, withdraw the stylet and, using the dissecting microscope, confirm the presence of saliva at the puncture site. Avoid forceful or sudden movement (either withdrawal or insertion) of the stylet that may cause bleeding or compromise ductal integrity.\nRetract the stylet within the tubing (Figure 3B).",
    "To ensure that injection tubing will fit into Wharton's duct opening, insert tubing containing the stylet as a rigid guide into the previously made puncture (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: If not performed quickly, local swelling may prevent re-insertion.\nTo prevent back pressure from prolonged ductal obstruction, withdraw the tubing. Inspect to verify that an opening, visible under microscopy, can be seen in the submandibular papilla. If visible bleeding occurs, remove the stylet and reattempt from step 3.2 on the opposing submandibular papillae.\nWithout moving the mouse, administer intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg atropine solution, to reduce salivation during the procedure. Wait 5 - 10 min.\nGrasp the end of the syringe tubing, and insert into the orifice using the dissecting microscope (Figure 3C). If resistance is encountered, cut a fresh beveled end to the tubing and reattempt.\nOnce the tubing is in place within the submandibular papilla, slowly advance 3 - 5 mm into the duct. Release the tubing from the forceps.\nTo improve the seal between the tubing and the submandibular papilla, dry the interface by gently blotting with gauze for 1 min.\nInspect to confirm that the position of the tubing has not shifted during drying.\n4. Injection\nInject material at a rate of 10 µL/min. Inspect to confirm that the mouse remains sedated and is not showing signs of distress (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: Injections of 15 - 50 µL are well tolerated. Injection of larger volumes can result in barotrauma.\nFollowing the injection, maintain syringe pressure for 5 min to improve the retention of material within Wharton's duct and SMG (Figure 4). Inspect the submandibular papilla periodically to ensure that tubing does not exit the ductal orifice.\nUsing fine forceps, grasp and gently withdraw the tubing from the submandibular papillae.",
    "NOTE: It is normal to observe some fluid egress from the papillae.\nRemove the retractor and cotton from the oral cavity before moving the mouse from the stage.\n\tNOTE: The animal should not be left unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Furthermore, ensure that the mouse is not housed with other mice until fully recovered.\n5. Verification and Analysis\nNote: An in vivo Imaging System (IVIS) can be used to assess retention of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles following injection (as shown 1 h and 24 h after injection in Figure 5).\nTo better visualize fluorescent signal within the SMG through the skin, remove the ventral fur overlying the SMGs either by shaving or using a chemical depilatory.\n\tNote: Following euthanasia, SMG tissue can also be harvested, fixed (overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde), and stained using immunohistochemistry to confirm persistence of fluorescently labeled NP one day following injection (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required.
