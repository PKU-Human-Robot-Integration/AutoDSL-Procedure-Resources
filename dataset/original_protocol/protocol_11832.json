    "The experiment was performed on primary ocular cells/stem cells derived from the Swiss albino mouse eye. The use of animals for harvesting the eyes for this experiment was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University) (IEAC approval number, 6a/19.10.2016).\n1. Preparations of reagents\nNOTE: The derivation of primary cells/stem cells from the mouse ocular surface is beyond the scope of this protocol. Hence, we demonstrate the UV-C exposure doses, reagent preparation for assessing ROS, live and dead cells and their quantification. Please refer to Table 1 for the respective volumes of the reagents (10% fetal bovine serum, DCFDA, Hoechst and propidium iodide stock solutions to be added for obtaining the final staining solution).\nPrepare a stock solution of 10 mM DCFDA by dissolving 25 mg of DCFDA powder in 5.13 mL of DMSO. Aliquot 250 µL each in amber colored 1.5 mL tubes and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare a stock solution of 10 mg/mL (16.23 mM solution) Hoechst 33342 by dissolving the entire contents of the 25 mg vial in 2.5 mL of deionized water. Make aliquots of 100 µL in amber colored microcentrifuge tubes and store at 2-6 °C for up to 6 months. For longer term storage, store at -20 °C.\nPrepare a stock solution of 1 mg/mL propidium iodide in deionized water, aliquot 1 mL each in amber colored 1.5 mL tubes, and store at 4 °C.\n2. Cell plating and UV-C radiation treatment\nBefore plating, dissociate the mouse primary ocular surface cells isolated in our laboratory (unpublished results; such cells are a mixture of corneal epithelial, stromal cells and keratocytes) using a gentle cell dissociation agent (Table of Materials).",
    "Plate 0.2 x 106 mouse primary ocular surface cells in 35 mm 0.2% basement membrane matrix coated cell culture dishes in 2.5 mL of complete media. Incubate overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and humidified incubator.\n\tNOTE: Complete media for culturing primary cells from the mouse ocular surface is comprised of DMEM high glucose containing 20% FBS, 1% Pen-strep, 1% Glutamax, 1% non-essential amino acid (NEAA), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol.\nBefore exposing the cells to various doses of UV-C, discard the maximum volume of media and allow only a thin layer of media (~500 µL) to remain in contact with the cells, just enough to cover them.\nTake the dishes, one at a time to the UV-C source/chamber (the lower chamber of a hybridization oven/UV cross linker; Table of Materials). Place the dish into the chamber and remove the lid of the dish. The open lid position of the dish ensures that the cells receive the maximum UV-C dose during the UV-C exposure.\nExpose the cells to different grades/doses of UV-C: 1 J/m2, 100J/m2, 1,000 J/m2 and 10,000 J/m2.\nAfter the UV-C exposure, replace the lid of each of the dishes immediately and remove them from the UV-C source chamber.\nBring each of the dishes to the laminar air flow hood and top up each of the dishes with 2 mL of fresh complete media.\nIncubate the cells for 3 h in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Three hours of incubation post UV-C exposure is optimal to visualize and quantify the early effects.\n3. Preparation of live-cell staining media\nPrepare the staining media fresh during the last 15 min of the 3 h cell incubation post UV-C exposure.\nPre-warm 10 mL of the staining media containing 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with 1% Pen-Strep to 37 °C.",
    "Add 5 μL of 10 mM DCFDA; 5 μL of 10 mg/mL Hoechst solution and 200 μL of 1 mg/mL propidium iodide. The final concentrations of DCFDA, Hoechst and PI are 5 μM, 5 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL, respectively, in the 10 mL of staining media.\n4. DCFDA staining of UV-C exposed mouse primary ocular cells\nAfter 3 h of incubation of UV-C exposed mouse primary ocular cells at various doses, aspirate the media from the 35 mm dishes.\nReplenish with 2 mL of freshly prepared DCFDA staining media to each of the dishes gently from the sides.\nIncubate the cells with the staining media for 15 min in the dark in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for live-cell staining.\n5. Viewing of DCFDA (ROS), Hoechst and PI stained cells\nAfter the completion of incubation, discard the staining media.\nAdd fresh complete media to the cells and observe the cells under an inverted fluorescent microscope/cell imager (Table of Materials). Photograph the desired fields: bright-field, blue fluorescence, red fluorescence, green fluorescence.\n\tNOTE: The blue fluorescently stained cells are the nuclei, the green fluorescence is for ROS generating cells and the red fluorescence indicates the PI positive dead cells.\n6. Quantification of stained cells (Hoechst-Blue, PI-Dead and Green-ROS) using imaging techniques\nExport the images captured under the inverted fluorescent microscope/cell imager to ImageJ for quantification.\nOpen each of the images one at a time, using each channel (i.e., blue (Nuclei/Hoechst), green (ROS), red (Dead/PI positive)) sequentially, for counting. Start from the unexposed control and sequentially move to 1, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 J/m-2.",
    "Count the cells using the cell counting tool marked as a cross in the software menu for each of the fields [blue positive (Hoechst positive; nuclei), red positive (PI positive; dead cells); green positive (ROS)] in each of the images corresponding to each of the treatments.\nCount by clicking on each of the specific signals in each of the fields. For example, clicking on the blue/Hoechst stained nuclei will give the total number of nuclei in a given field.\nCalculate the results as the percentage of cell death by UV damage (number of PI positive cells x 100 divided by the number of Hoechst positive cells) and the percentage of ROS production by UV damage (number of DCFDA positive cells x 100 divided by the number of Hoechst positive cells).\nSubscription Required.
