    "Mouse lungs were donated by researchers using other organ systems in an effort to uphold the 3Rs. All procedures in pigs were carried out in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by Malmö-Lund Ethical Committee on Animal Research (Dnr 5.8.18-05527/2019) and conducted according to the CODEX guidelines of the Swedish Research Council. Approval for the use of human samples was granted by the Swedish National Ethics Committee (Dnr 2020-07115 and Dnr 2020-01864). See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of solutions and materials\nFix the lung tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 48 h. Subsequently, transfer the lung tissue to a 50 mL conical tube filled with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% sodium azide.\nPrepare a 3% (w/v) agarose solution by dissolving 1.5 g of low-melting-point agarose in 50 mL of sterile PBS. Ready a plastic cup, fine forceps, and sterile scissors.\nHeat the agarose in a microwave until it boils, then cool it down to 42 °C in a water bath. Keep the agarose in its liquid form by storing it in the water bath until ready to use.\n\tNOTE: While heating the agarose, watch the microwave until it begins to boil so it does not overflow. This usually takes around 1.5 min.\n2. Lung tissue embedded in agarose\nLift the lung biopsy from the PBS-azide and carefully dissect the lung lobes using fine forceps and sterile scissors. Cut the lung lobe into smaller blocks.\n\tNOTE: While sectioning with pleura is possible, its thick elastin bundles can impede cutting with the vibratome blade. Thus, we recommend its removal if it is not necessary.",
    "Cut a plastic cup through the middle and add a small amount of agarose to its bottom. Place the lid from a 50 mL conical tube (rim removed) on the surface of the agarose and store the cup at 4 °C for 5 min to allow the agarose to solidify for later use.\nRetrieve the plastic cup from the 4 °C refrigerator, add approximately 1 mL of liquid agarose onto the lid, then gently place the lung tissue block onto the lid. Leave the agarose for 2-3 min to semi-solidify at room temperature. Then, slowly pour the liquid agarose onto the lung tissue until it is fully submerged.\nRefrigerate at 4 °C for approximately 15 min until the agarose solidifies. Next, carefully use a sharp blade to remove extra agarose surrounding the lung tissue, leaving a uniform layer of approximately 5 mm thickness around the tissue (Figure 1).\n3. Cutting lung tissue sections\nTo prepare the lung tissue for sectioning, attach each tissue block onto the specimen disk of the vibratome using super glue. Next, fill the vibratome buffer tray with PBS and place ice in the surrounding ice bath. Finally, carefully install the specimen disk into the buffer tray.\nSlice the lung tissue with the vibratome with the following settings: thickness: 200 µm, frequency: 100 Hz, amplitude of the blade: 1.3 mm, and forward speed of the blade of 0.02-0.03 mm/s, which depends on tissue stiffness.\n\tNOTE: Cutting is possible down to a thickness of 70 µm if the blade speed is reduced to 0.01 mm/s. Certain vibratomes (e.g., Leica V1200s) allow automation of sectioning by setting a cutting window.",
    "To collect sections, gently transfer the tissue slice by scooping it with a brush from the vibratome tray into a 24-well plate filled with 0.01% azide in PBS. Finally, preserve the lung slices at 4 °C.\n4. Immunostaining of elastin, CD31, HTII-280, and SMA\nPermeabilize and block (1% bovine serum albumin + 0.5% Triton + 5% normal goat serum) the tissue at 4 °C under gentle shaking for 45 min.\nDilute the primary antibodies (SMA 1:500; elastin 1:250; CD31 1:250; HTII-280 1:250) in PBS, add 300 µL in per well, and incubate overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking.\nWithout touching the slice and removing the primary antibodies with a pipette tip, wash 3 x 20 min (400 µL) with PBS.\nDilute the secondary antibodies (1:1000) in PBS, add 300 µL in per well, and incubate at 4 °C under gentle shaking for 90 min.\nRemove the secondary antibodies with a pipette tip, add 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)(1:1000) and tomato lectin-488 (1:500) for a 30 min incubation, and wash for 3 x 10 min with PBS.\nPlace three drops of mounting medium on the slide, mount a coverslip, and proceed to imaging."
