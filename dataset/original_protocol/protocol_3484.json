    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vivo labeling of amyloid plaques\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes how to label amyloid plaques with methoxy-X04 (MeX04), a blood–brain barrier-penetrating amyloid-beta (Aβ) dye. After MeX04 is intraperitoneally injected into Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mice, it enters the brain and binds to the surface of Aβ plaques. If microglia are actively phagocytosing amyloid plaques, MeX04 will be internalized together with Aβ. Thus, subsequent flow cytometry analysis enables the quantification of the capacity of microglia to phagocytose Aβ within the 3 h interval between MeX04 injection and sacrifice.\nIntraperitoneal injection of MeX04 into 6–18-month-old AD transgenic mice\nWarm the MeX04 working solution (2 mg/mL) in a 37°C water bath for 5 min before injection.\nWeigh the AD transgenic mice and intraperitoneally inject MeX04 working solution at 10 mg/kg.\nNote: Also include non-transgenic wild-type (WT) mice (i.e., without amyloid plaques) to control for MeX04 signal baseline in flow cytometry analysis.\nBrain dissociation and microglia isolation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis section describes a modified protocol to maximize the number of microglia isolated.\nCritical: To achieve a high yield of viable microglia, freshly prepared aCSF with pH 7.2–7.4 and gentle mechanical dissociation are essential. It is also recommended that each experimenter handle fewer than 3 samples to minimize differences in digestion time.\nBrain dissection\nEuthanize mice using isoflurane 3 h after MeX04 injection and perfuse mice with 20 mL ice-cold PBS.\nDissect the region(s) of interest in ice-cold PBS.\nBrain dissociation by papain\nPrepare enzyme dissociation solution by adding 0.004 g l-cysteine, 100 U papain, and 700 U DNaseI into 20 mL working aCSF solution (refer to “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for detailed recipe).\nPrewarm the enzyme dissociation solution in a 37°C water bath for 5 min.",
    "Mince the brain tissue into small pieces on a petri dish and transfer to a 50-mL falcon tube with 20 mL enzyme dissociation solution.\nIncubate in a 37°C water bath with constant shaking for 10 min.\nRemove the tube from the water bath and let the undigested tissue sink to the bottom.\nVery gently pass the tissue through a 20-gauge needles 3 times and return the tubes to the 37°C water bath for an additional 30 min of digestion.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and subject it to a Percoll gradient.\nPercoll gradient\nPrepare isotonic Percoll by adding 9 parts Percoll into 1 part 10× HBSS.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 7 mL working aCSF solution.\nAdd 3 mL isotonic Percoll and mix well by inverting 10 times; the resultant solution contains 30% Percoll.\nGently add 2 mL working aCSF on top.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g at 4°C for 15 min with the slowest acceleration and zero deceleration.\nUse a P1000 pipette to gently remove the myelin debris layer trapped between the aCSF and 30% Percoll, and subsequently aspirate all supernatant (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/372-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Photograph of the myelin layer and cell pellet after Percoll gradient centrifugation\nThe myelin layer is trapped between the 30% Percoll layer and artificial cerebrospinal fluid layer.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS.\nCell staining\nBefore cell staining, aliquot 5 μL cell suspension and inspect cell viability, number, and singlet by hemocytometer.\nNote: Number of viable cell number ranges from 1.5–3.0 × 106 per forebrain depending on age of AD transgenic mice.",
    "To label microglia, stain the cell suspension (200 μL) with CD11b-APC (1:200) and CD45-FITC (1:200) for 45 min at 4°C with rotation. In addition, prepare unstained controls using AD transgenic model mice and non-transgenic wild-type mice to serve as fluorescence-minus-one controls.\nNote: The emission spectrum of MeX04 overlaps with that of DAPI/Pacific blue.\nAfter 45 min, wash the cells with 1 mL DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS and centrifuge at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 500 μL DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS.\nFlow cytometry\nSwitch on the flow cytometer and perform machine start-up.\nCreate the following plots in the template (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/372-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
