    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTo achieve a tissue-specific ko in parallel with cDNA expression, four genetic components are required, including a tissue-specific Gal4, a dU6:3-sgRNAgene of interest, UAS-Cas9.P2, and UAS-cDNAgene of interest (WT or mutant). We suggest you generate two fly lines – one carrying a Gal4 driver and sgRNA gene of interest, and another carrying UAS-Cas9.P2 and UAS-cDNA (your gene of interest). These parental lines are genetically stable as they lack at least one component for Cas9 or sgRNA expression. Progenies arising from crosses of the parental lines have all four components, which permit tissue-specific knockout in the genome, as well as cDNA expression from the UAS transgene by Gal4 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Any Gal4 driver can be used for this system. In this protocol, we describe a method regarding a neuronal Gal4 (elavC155-Gal4) to determine the functional effects of human OGDHL variants in neurons as human OGDHL is mainly expressed in the human brains (Bunik et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Consortium, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nGeneration of flies carrying sgRNAdOgdh and neuronal Gal4 driver\nTiming: 6 weeks\nTo establish a Drosophila line with a neuronal Gal4 driver on the 1st chromosome and sgRNAdOgdh on the 2nd chromosome, a series of crosses will be performed. Genetic balancers and markers will be used to track the presence of the desired genes and transgenes in the progeny (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Crossing scheme for the generation of files carrying neuronal Gal4 driver and sgRNAdOgdh\nCross 3 male flies carrying sgRNA (y,w/Y chromosome; U6:3-sgRNAdOgdh) with 3–6 virgin female flies having a neuronal Gal4 driver as well as a balancer and a maker on the 2nd chromosome (elavC155-Gal4; Bl1/CyO, Tub>Gal80). Two crosses will provide enough progenies for downstream experiments.",
    "Select 3 male progeny with CyO, Tub>Gal80, making sure to exclude those with Bl1. Cross these males (elavC155-Gal4/Y chromosome; U6:3-sgRNAdOgdh/CyO, Tub>Gal80) with 3–6 virgin female flies having a neuronal Gal4 driver and 2nd chromosome balancer and maker (elavC155-Gal4; Bl1/CyO, Tub>Gal80).\nSelect 3 male and 3–6 virgin female progenies with CyO, Tub>Gal80, making sure to exclude those with Bl1. Make a cross to produce a genetic line containing CyO, Tub>Gal4 and sgRNAdOgdh on the 2nd chromosome (elavC155-Gal4; U6:3-sgRNAdOgdh/CyO, Tub>Gal80).\nSelect and cross 3 male and 3–6 virgin female progenies that are homozygous for sgRNAdOgdh on the 2nd chromosome (elavC155-Gal4; U6:3-sgRNAdOgdh/CyO, Tub>Gal80).\nCritical: It is important to use the correct combination of male and female genotypes in crosses. For example, you should use female virgin flies having elavC155-Gal4; Bl1/CyO, tub-Gal80, and male flies of yw/Y chromosome; dU6:3-sgRNAdOgdh for the first cross. As elavC155-Gal4 is located on the X chromosome, the Y chromosome in males will be used to track the presence of the neuronal Gal4 on X chromosome. In this instance, the Y chromosome acts as a balancer.\nPause point: Once a line is established, it can be maintained indefinitely.\nGeneration of flies carrying UAS-dOgdh (WT or mutant) and UAS-Cas9.P2\nTiming: 6–8 weeks\nCross 3 male flies carrying UAS-dOgdh (WT or mutant) on 2nd chromosome with 3–6 virgin female flies having balancers and makers in the 2nd and 3rd chromosomes (yw; sp, if/CyO; TM2/TM6B) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). Two crosses will provide enough progenies for downstream experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Crossing scheme for the generation of flies carrying UAS-dOgdh (WT) and UAS-Cas9.P2 line",
    "Select 3 male progeny having CyO on the 2nd chromosome and TM6B on the 3rd chromosome, Making sure to exclude sp,if from the 2nd chromosome and TM2 from the 3rd chromosome. Cross with 3–6 virgin female flies selected to have CyO on the 2nd chromosome and TM2 on the 3rd chromosome, Making sure to exclude sp,if from the 2nd chromosome and TM6B from the 3rd chromosome.\nCollect male progeny having CyO on the 2nd chromosome and both TM6B and TM2 on the 3rd chromosome (y, w/Y; UAS-dOgdh (WT or mutant)/CyO; TM2/TM6B). The 3rd chromosome balancers (TM2 and TM6B) have a recessive marker ebony (e - black body color). Cross these 3 males with 3–6 virgin female flies having balancers and makers on the 2nd chromosome as well as UAS-Cas9.P2 on the 3rd chromosome (y, w; sp, if/CyO; UAS-Cas9.P2).\nCollect 3 male and 3–6 virgin female progeny with CyO and TM6B, excluding sp,if and TM2 and cross to establish the line (y,w; UAS-dOgdh (WT or mutant)/CyO; UAS-Cas9.P2/TM6B).\nNote: The male and female genotypes in step 6 can be switched and still produce the same results.\nNote: Once a line is established, it is possible that after several generations, balancers such as CyO and TM6B will no longer be present in every fly as they become homozygous for the inserted transgenes.\nNote: We also generated a control fly line carrying UAS-empty; UAS-Cas9.P2 to equalize the number of UAS in flies.\nPause point: Once a line is established, it can be maintained indefinitely.\nFunctional studies of disease candidate variants in Drosophila\nTiming: 1 month",
    "To perform the functional studies of disease candidate variants from patients, conduct the following experiments. First, determine phenotypes of tissue-specific ko of your gene of interest. Second, determine whether WT cDNA expression rescues the phenotypes caused by ko of your gene of interest. Third, determine whether the expression of cDNA carrying disease candidate variants can rescue or fails to rescue the tissue-specific ko phenotypes (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]). The genomic DNA analysis by Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) will show the efficiency of ko in the samples (described in the next section – ICE analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]). As an example, here, we describe how to perform functional analysis for disease candidate variants in OGDHL by using neuronal-specific dOgdh ko flies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. A schematic of functional studies of disease candidate variants in Drosophila\nIn order to determine phenotypes of tissue-specific loss of your gene, cross flies carrying tissue-specific-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAgene of interest with flies carrying UAS-empty; UAS-Cas9.P2/TM6B. By counting flies with and without balancers (e.g., TM6B), you could determine if the loss of your gene in given tissues leads to lethality. For example,\nCross virgin female with elavC155-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAdOgdh with males carrying UAS-empty; UAS-Cas9.P2/TM6B.\nAfter 10–14 days of incubation at a 25°C, progenies will begin to arrive. Count and sort the progenies according to the presence of balancers (e.g., TM6B).\nFrom the numbers of flies with or without balancers, determine whether progenies are born as Mendelian ratio or not. For example, we found that no flies with neuronal ko of dOgdh can reach to the adult stage as all flies have the TM6B balancer. Careful examination revealed that neuronal loss of dOgdh results in developmental lethality at 3rd instar larval and pupal stages (elavC155-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAdOgdh / UAS-empty; UAS-Cas9.P2/+) (Yap et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "Note: If tissue-specific ko of your gene does not cause lethality, examine and find phenotypes associated with loss of your gene by performing additional assays such as life-span, climbing, or flight assays.\nTo determine whether wild-type (WT) cDNA expression rescues the phenotype caused by tissue-specific loss of your gene,\nCross flies carrying UAS- WT cDNA; UAS-Cas9.P2 with flies having tissue-specific-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAgene of interest.\nAfter 10–14 days of incubation at a 25°C fly incubator, progenies will begin to arrive. Count and sort the progenies according to the presence of balancers (e.g., TM6B).\nFrom the numbers of flies with or without balancers, determine whether progenies are born as Mendelian ratio or not.\nNote: Complete rescue of the phenotypes by expressing WT cDNA indicates that the phenotype is caused by the loss of your gene, and the off-target effects of sgRNA/Cas9 are negligible. For example, dOgdh (WT) expression fully rescued the developmental lethality caused by neuronal loss of dOgdh (elavC155-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAdOgdh / UAS-empty; UAS-Cas9.P2/UAS-dOgdh (WT)) (Yap et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: If tissue-specific loss of your gene leads to phenotypes in the later life of flies (e.g., neurodegeneration in photoreceptor neurons), examine the phenotype in appropriate time points.\nTo determine whether disease-associated mutations affect gene function in vivo,\nCross flies carrying UAS-(mutant) cDNA; UAS-Cas9.P2 with flies having tissue-specific-Gal4; dU6:3sgRNAgene of interest.\nAfter 10–14 days of incubation at a 25°C fly incubator, progenies will begin to arrive. Count and sort the progenies according to the presence of balancers (e.g., TM6B).\nFrom the numbers of flies with or without balancers, determine whether progenies are born as Mendelian ratio or not.",
    "Note: Results will enable you to determine whether tested mutations affect gene function or not. If expression of mutant cDNA fails to rescue the phenotypes caused by loss of your gene, we can conclude that the mutation is a severe loss of function allele. Partial rescue indicates that mutants are benign alleles, and complete rescue indicates that mutants do not affect gene function (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nICE analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nThis section explains how to use Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) analysis on in vivo samples to test the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ko of the genomic locus of your gene of interest. Here we provide detailed protocols of ICE analysis for dOgdh case as an example. The protocol includes how to use ICE analysis to determine the ko efficiency of dOgdh as well as determine whether the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP targets UAS-dOgdh cDNA transgene or not.\nCollect the progeny from the lethality assay as well as control flies:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1725_21.csv\nNote: Collected F1 flies carrying wild-type or mutant cDNA will be the experiment, and flies carrying UAS-empty(VK37) and no UAS-Cas9.P2 will serve as the control.\nChop and collect 10–20 heads of the flies, keeping the collected sample on ice.\nPause point: Fly heads can be stored in −30°C for 3 months.\nPurify genomic DNA from the fly heads using PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Cat# K1820-02) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPause point: Purified genomic DNA can be stored in −30°C.\nSet up the following reaction for genomic PCR on ice or in a cooler (−20°C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1725_22.csv\nNote: The OneTaq Hot Start 2× Master Mix and PCR primers should be stored at −30°C to −20°C.\nSet the PCR cycling conditions as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1725_23.csv",
    "Note: The genomic PCR reaction will need to be completed for two different sets of primers for each sample. One set is for targeting the genomic locus and the second set is for targeting the UAS-cDNA transgene locus. For example, the sgRNA/Cas9-tageting site of the dOgdh in the genome was amplified by a primer pair (dOgdh-gF-1 and dOgdh-gR-1, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Amplification for UAS-dOgdh cDNA transgenes in the genome was done by a primer pair (pUAST-F2 and dOgdh-cDNA-R1, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nRun the PCR products in 1% agarose gel to confirm the bands are the correct size.\nPurify the PCR product with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Cat# 28106) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAlternatives: You can also use the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Cat# 28706) if there are any non-specific bands.\nSend the purified PCR products to a sequencing service for Sanger sequencing.\nFill in the blanks from Synthego website as described below to complete ICE analysis for the genomic locus (Synthego Performance Analysis, ICE Analysis. 2019. V2.0. Synthego; [9.22.2021].).\nWrite the sample name in the ‘Label’ and gRNA sequence in the ‘Guide Sequences.’ (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]).\nTo verify that the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP complex targets at the genomic locus, use the gRNA that you designed in “generation of DNA construct carrying sgRNA that targets gene of interest[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]”, excluding the PAM sequence. For example, we used the sequence derived from dOgdh-gRNA-F (step 2 in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. Sanger sequencing chromatograms for the junction of Exon2 (coding exon) and intron of dOgdh and UAS-dOgdh (WT) cDNA transgene",
    "The orange box of the top image depicts the sequence of the exon-intron junction in the dOgdh genome that is targeted by the gRNAdOgdh. The yellow box of the bottom image shows the sequence of the UAS-dOgdh cDNA transgene that the artificial gRNA targets. The purple boxes indicate the PAM sequence. Note that the last 8 nucleotides of the artificial gRNA (red dashed lines) are the same as the last 8 nucleotides of the gRNA. The two gRNAs differ in the first 12 nucleotides.\nTo perform ICE analysis for the UAS-cDNA locus that is not targeted by the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP complex, use an artificial gRNA sequence that targets the cDNA. For example, we used an artificial gRNA that is reverse complementary to the end of Exon 2 and beginning of Exon 3 (yellow box in Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nSkip ‘Donor Sequence (optional).’\nNote: You do not need to include the donor sequence for ko analysis. You will need to provide donor sequences for gene edition by exogenous templates.\nUpload an .abi file of Sanger sequencing results of control flies to ‘Control File,’ and upload an .abi file of Sanger sequencing results of WT rescue or viable mutants to the ‘Experiment File’ (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Snapshot of the ICE analysis webpage from Synthego\nClick ‘Add Sample to Analysis’ (red arrow in Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). Repeat steps a – d for each sample that you want to analyze. Once you have added all of the samples, click ‘Analyze.’",
    "Then the web will show your results, including: ko score, indel %, R2 value, the relative contribution of each sequence, indel plot, discordance plot, and the trace for the experimental and control samples (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]). To determine if the ICE program was able to analyze your data, look at the status on your results page. There are three different levels of status: green, yellow, and red. A green means that there were no problems. Yellow indicates that the ICE program was able to analyze the data, but it sensed issues of quality of Sanger sequencing. Lastly, the red status means that the Sanger sequences were poor quality and that the program could not analyze the data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1725-Fig15.jpg\nFigure 15. Snapshot of the ICE analysis results for dOgdh ko from the Synthego webpage\n(A) Contributions include Status, Indel %, Model Fit (R2), Knockout-Score, and relative contribution of each sequence from ICE analysis for dOgdh ko sample.\n(B) Indel distribution includes a histogram illustrating the percent of edited sequences and a discordance plot.\n(C) Traces show Sanger chromatograms for control and experimental samples.\nIndel % or ICE score refers to the overall editing efficiency of the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP. This value indicates the percent of the sample with insertions or deletions (indels) that make the sequence different from the wild-type. This information describes how well the Cas9 can cleave the target site. An increase in ICE score indicates that more cells are targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 complex; however, it doesn’t tell us if these indels result in the ko of the protein.\nThe R2 value measures how well the dependent variable’s variation fits the independent variable’s linear regression model. A higher R2 value signifies that you can be more confident in the ICE score.",
    "The ko score refers to the proportion of sequences edited by the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP complex resulting in the protein ko. The program determines if the protein has been knocked out by detecting if the sequence has a frameshift-inducing indel or 21 bp or longer indel in the protein-coding region.\nThe relative contribution of each sequence also shows the percent of the different indel sizes present in your edited sequences. However, it also displays the inferred sequence for each indel size when lined up with the control sequence (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A).\nThe indel plot uses a bar graph to illustrate the percent of the edited sequences with a specific indel size (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B).\nThe discordance plot shows how much the edited samples deviate from the control sample by measuring the discordance at each base pair. The black dashed line indicates where the Cas9 is expected to cut (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B).\nThe trace plot gives a Sanger sequencing chromatogram of your control and experimental samples. The black dashed line on the plot distinguishes where the Cas9 is expected to cut, so by looking at the peaks before and after this dashed line you can determine the success of the editing. For the genomic locus that the sgRNA/Cas9-RNP targets, the peaks after the cut should decrease in height (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]C).\nClick ‘Download Analysis Data’ (red arrow in Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A) to receive your analysis through email."
