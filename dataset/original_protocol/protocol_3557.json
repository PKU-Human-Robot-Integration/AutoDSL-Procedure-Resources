    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImplantation of head plate\nTiming: 1 h\nThe aim of this step is to implant a headplate for head fixation in a manner which minimizes brain movement. Note that strict sterile procedures must be adhered to in order to prevent infections. Mice should ideally be 5–6 weeks old at the start of the protocol for optimal recording success. Both male and female mice have been used successfully. The age of the mouse at the time of patching should be no greater than 12 weeks. In older animals, the chances of obtaining a recording drop, and access resistances of successful recordings tend to be higher, likely due to changes in the properties of the tissue and increases in bone thickness making the craniotomy more difficult to achieve cleanly.\nSee Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for a graphical demonstration of this stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Headplate implantation surgery\nLeft diagram shows the surgical area in which skin and periosteum is removed (dotted line represents the edge of surgical area), as well as relevant landmarks and bones of the skull. Below shows an example headplate design, which can be stabilized via two screws. Right boxes (1–5) show diagrams for key steps of the surgery. Blue shading indicates areas with tissue adhesive application, and pink shows areas with dental cement application (darker indicates a deeper layer).\nPrepare mouse for surgery.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (3% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance).\nEnsure the mouse is adequately anesthetized by monitoring breathing rate and assessing the toe pinch reflex.\nApply ophthalmic gel to the eyes.\nPlace the mouse on a heated pad to ensure body temperature is maintained.\nFix the mouse’s head securely in a stereotax.\nPrepare the surgical area.\nShave the fur off from the entire dorsal surface of the head.",
    "Disinfect the shaved area.\nInject a local analgesic (e.g., lidocaine and ropivacain) subcutaneously around the site of the implant, prior to incision.\nRemove a circular piece of skin overlying the skull using surgical scissors.\nRemove all periosteal soft tissue overlying the parietal and interparietal bones by scraping it away using a scalpel.\nCritical: Pay careful attention to remove all soft tissue overlying the sutures of the skull. Failure to remove all soft tissue can lead to destabilization of the implant.\nNote: Moistening the skull with sterile saline allows clearer visualization of soft tissue.\nSeal the edges of the skin with tissue adhesive.\nWhen the bone is dry, use the dental drill to lightly roughen the bone surface, omitting the area where you want to record.\nAdhere the skull bones together to optimize stability of the brain:\nApply tissue adhesive along the sutures between parietal and interparietal bones to adhere the bones together.\nOnce the glue is dry, repeat until 3–4 layers of glue have been applied, and no relative movement of the parietal and interparietal bones occurs when gentle forces are applied.\nApply a thin layer of tissue adhesive to the remaining skull surface.\nAffix the headplate to the skull.\nGlue the headplate to the bone with tissue adhesive.\nApply ample dental cement to affix the headplate to the skull. Ensure all exposed skull is covered in cement, except the area overlying the brain region of interest.\nBuild 1–2 mm high recording chamber walls around the craniotomy site out of dental cement. (This is to allow space for later immersion of a 1 × 3 mm AgCl ground electrode pellet, alongside space for descent of the microelectrode).",
    "Critical: If the headplate is made of metal, ensure that all parts within the recording chamber are covered by dental cement to ensure electrical isolation of the recording chamber.\nCover the craniotomy area with Kwik-cast silicone sealant.\nInject the animal with a general analgesic (e.g., Metacam, buprenorphine).\nProvide general analgesia for 48 h following surgery, as well as wet food on the cage floor.\nBehavioral training and habituation to head fixation\nTiming: 3–7 days\nThis step allows the animal to acclimatize to head fixation and perform smooth locomotion by the time of recording, such that disruptive movements do not occur during the recording. This time can also be used to train the animal on any specific behavioral paradigms being studied. Make sure to handle the mice regularly prior to this step, to habituate them to the experimenter.\nHabituate the mouse to head fixation: Head fix the mouse at the setup for up to 1 h each day, until the mouse shows regular locomotion, and shows a comfortable posture (e.g., a lowered tail, and no contortions of the body).\nOptional: train the mouse on the relevant head-fixed task.\nCraniotomy and durectomy\nTiming: 20 min\nThe goal of this step is to make a small clean craniotomy with part of the dura removed to ensure clean insertion of the micropipette. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a graphical demonstration of this stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Craniotomy and durectomy\nBoxes 1–6 show key steps of the procedure. Note that all stages take place submerged in bath recording solution (Cortex buffer), aside from the initial drilling in box 1.\nPrepare enough micropipettes for the recording session (around 10–12), as well as a means of filling them (e.g., a syringe with a thin tapered tip filled with 250 μL intracellular solution, kept on ice).",
    "Prepare 4% low melting point agar (dissolved in bath recording solution) and maintain in a heat bath at 60°C.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane, as before (3% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance), and head fix the mouse at the surgery station on a heated pad to maintain body temperature.\nInject a general analgesic (e.g., Metacam, buprenorphine).\nPerform a small circular craniotomy, around 1 mm in diameter over the site of interest.\nRemove the silicone covering the bone.\nDrill the edge of the circle slowly, regularly pausing to irrigate the bone with cold bath recording solution. Dry the bone thoroughly before resuming drilling, and clear away bone particles to prevent contamination of the craniotomy.\nOnce the bone is thin enough, you will see the bone circle move when lightly pressed with forceps (check this while the bone is damp).\nUse a 20-gauge needle, or fine forceps, to lift and remove the bone circle from the skull, while immersed in recording solution. Make sure that at no point the brain is touched by your instrument, and that the brain does not contact air (this can cause sticking of the dura to the brain surface, making it hard to remove cleanly).\nUse a syringe to lightly wash the brain with recording solution until any small bleeds have stopped.\nPerform the durectomy:\nAbruptly tap a 30-gauge needle tip perpendicularly downwards onto a hard, clean surface. This should bend the needle tip to create a very small hook.\nWith the hook side facing down toward the brain, carefully attempt to catch onto the dura using a shallow angle (<30°).",
    "Once attached carefully tear and pull the dura to the side of the craniotomy with the hook, without touching the underlying brain surface directly. Remove as much dura as possible from the center of the craniotomy to provide ample space for electrode descent.\nUse a Pasteur pipette to lightly wash the brain with bath recording solution until any small bleeds have stopped.\nNote: A light source at a shallow angle (<30°) is helpful for visualizing the dura.\nRemove the recording solution and place a drop of warm melted 4% agar onto the craniotomy.\nCritical: You are aiming for an 0.5–1 mm agar layer overlying the brain and surrounding bone, allowing clear visualization of the underlying brain surface for later electrode targeting. If this is too thin, brain movement will still occur, while if it is too thick, microelectrode clogging is more likely, and the brain will be less easy to target.\nNote: Make sure this is not too hot by first allowing it to cool in the pipette tip for as long as possible without it solidifying (gelling point of the suggested agar is 36°C). Applying hot agar, exceeding 40°C, could damage the brain surface, however cooling/gelling will be very rapid (on the order of seconds) given the small volume of agar and the thinness of the layer.\nOnce the agar solidifies, re-immerse in bath recording solution.\nTransfer the mouse to head fixation on the recording setup to recover from anesthesia for at least 20 min, and until the mouse shows regular locomotion, or (if performing a task) licking for reward.\nWhole-cell recordings\nTiming: up to 2 h\nSee Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for a graphical demonstration of this stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Electrode resistance monitoring and obtaining of whole-cell recording",
    "Boxes 1–7 show the stages of gaining a whole-cell recording via monitoring electrode resistance with a test pulse in voltage clamp. Green traces in the dark boxes are diagrams of the current trace as would be seen on an oscilloscope at various stages of the process. Dashed gray line shows 0 nA. Note that electrode offset is re-zeroed between “brain entry” and “neuron hunting.” The pressure range applied to the micropipette is shown in red for each stage (note: arrows between pressure values indicate a rapid transition between pressures). Diagrams below each oscilloscope diagram depict what is happening at the micropipette tip for each stage (see also Margrie et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Rancz et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPlace the AgCl ground electrode into the recording chamber. Make sure this cannot move and is immersed when the chamber is full.\nBackfill a micropipette with intracellular solution (make sure there are no trapped bubbles), load into the micropipette holder, and apply 500 mbar pressure using the high-pressure line. Apply a 10 mV voltage step at 20 Hz in voltage clamp for monitoring electrode resistance (display step-triggered electrode current on an oscilloscope).\nDescend the electrode into the recording solution. Note down the electrode resistance, which should be between 5 and 7 MΩ (Box 1, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCritical: Do not allow the micropipette pressure to drop to 0 mbar or below while in the bath or tissue, until attempting to seal. This creates an opportunity for contamination of the electrode tip.\nRemove the bath recording solution, and visually guide the micropipette down until it touches the surface of the agar overlying the craniotomy (identified visually or through electrode current). Re-immerse the recording chamber.",
    "Slowly descend the micropipette into the agar at a slow speed (e.g., 30 μm/s) targeted at the craniotomy center (Box 2, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). As you move through the agar, you should see gradual increases in resistance of the micropipette which periodically decreases back to the starting resistance (i.e., a sawtooth profile of electrode resistance).\nNote: If the resistance does not reduce periodically, the pipette is getting clogged on the way down. Retract the electrode to unclog the tip and descend again if this occurs (if this recurs, it may be due to too low microelectrode resistance, too low pressure, or too low agar concentration).\nIdentify brain tissue entry: Watch out for a sudden change in current offset coinciding with a transient increase in resistance (Box 3, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Zero the manipulator descent axis at this point.\nNote: Do not move the micropipette laterally while in the tissue.\nDrive the micropipette down to around 100 μm above the depth of interest, switch the micropipette pressure line from high to low pressure, and apply 20 mbar pressure.\nWait for 60 s, to allow the ejected internal solution to clear, and to allow the pressure and pipette offset to stabilize.\nCritical: Make sure electrode resistance is comparable to its initial resistance (when recorded in the bath). If this has increased or decreased, this indicates a clogged or broken pipette tip, respectively.\nNeuron hunting (Box 4, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]): with 20 mbar pressure applied, start descending the micropipette in 2 μm steps.\nNote: If possible, only perform neuron hunting while the animal is stationary. Small brain movements during locomotion can make hitting a neuron harder to detect.",
    "When electrode resistance increases consistently and substantially (a doubling) across 2–3 steps, this indicates collision with a neuron (Box 5, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). A mild oscillation on top of the current trace, caused by heart rate driven brain motion, is another good indicator of proximity to a neuron.\nAbruptly reduce pressure to 0 mbar (i.e., open the low-pressure line) to seal onto the cell membrane (Box 6, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). This is indicated by a rapid increase in electrode resistance toward the GΩ range. Applying gentle negative pressure (up to −10 mbar) can aid this.\nSlowly bring the command voltage down to −70 mV. This aids in sealing and prevents depolarization when breaking in.\nCarefully retract the micropipette 2–4 μm after GΩ resistance seal formation. If attempting cell filling for morphological reconstruction, see optional steps 41–45 below.\nBreaking in (Box 7, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]): Using the low-pressure line, apply a brief and gentle suction pulse (up to −50 mbar, for 1 s) to break into whole-cell mode.\nNote: Applying a small positive pressure (+3 mbar) in whole-cell mode can help prevent resealing.\nSwitch to current clamp and record membrane potential as required by the experiment.\nOnce finished, slowly retract the micropipette until outside of the tissue/agar.\nBetween every 1–2 micropipette descents, very carefully remove the agar layer with fine forceps, and replace it with a fresh layer. This is to prevent agar layer break down and subsequent brain movement.\nNeuronal filling and morphology recovery (optional)\nTiming: 1 h",
    "If neuronal morphology is desired, the following steps should also be followed during whole-cell recordings. Note that this will further limit the number of recordings obtained to one per mouse, to be sure of matching the morphology to the recording. In my experience, morphological recovery has particularly low success rates in the awake mouse, with only partial morphological recoveries most likely. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for a graphical depiction of this stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Retraction after neuronal filling for morphological reconstruction\nBoxes 1–3 show electrode current signatures for a good chance of morphological recovery. After filling the neuron in whole-cell mode for 5–10 min, the pipette is slowly retracted before access resistance deteriorates. This evokes membrane resealing and formation of an outside-out patch on the electrode tip that is indicated by a high electrode resistance. Green coloration of the neuron in the diagram indicates intracellular solution that has diffused into the cytoplasm from the micropipette tip.\nPerform recordings as outlined in steps 24–38 (Whole-cell recordings), with an intracellular solution additionally containing 10 mM biocytin or neurobiotin. For a good neuronal fill, recording duration should be between 5 and 10 min, with an electrode resistance on the lower end of the workable range (5–6 MΩ), and an access resistance below 80 MΩ.\nRetract the microelectrode slowly after 5–10 min of recording, while the recording quality is still high, and monitor the electrode current with a 10-mV test pulse in voltage clamp, as before. For a successful fill, microelectrode resistance should gradually increase as the microelectrode is retracted (at 5–10 μm/s, until resealing), reflecting the formation of an outside-out patch.",
    "Once outside of the tissue and in the bath, applying a strong positive pressure to the micropipette should return the electrode resistance to close to its original value. This is an indicator of a good retraction that has retained minimal cellular material in/on the micropipette.\nFix the brain with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) within an hour of recording via transcardial perfusion and store the brain for 24 h in 4% PFA.\nFor a detailed procedure for biocytin/neurobiotin staining for morphological reconstruction, see Marx et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]."
