    "Protoplast isolationUsing tweezers, 5-6 mature leaves of Arabidopsis, petioles removed, were harvested. Adaxial surface of leaves was put on a piece of tape and leaves were flattened (Figure 1A-B).Second piece of tape was applied with limited pressure, trapping leaves between them (Figure 1C). To much pressure will result in damaging leaves, too little pressure will lead to poor epidermis removal effectiveness. Sandwich was placed with adaxial surface on top and pieces of tape were split by pulling away tape on top side, started at the tip of leaf (Figure 1D-E) (see Note 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150215/20150215175054_2430.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of Arabidopsis leaf for protoplast isolation. A. 3-weeks old Aradodopsis thaliana; B-E. Step by step procedure of leaf epidermis removal with tape.Tape was cut around leaves and put at room temperature enzyme solution in Petri dish, exposed mesophyll down. Tape should not be immersed in solution, but float on top of it. Mesophyll cells were digested for 60 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking (55 rpm) (see Note 3).After digestion pieces of tape were removed and cells were left for another 5 min in same conditions (see Note 4). Using 10 ml pipette protoplasts were transported to 50 ml tubes and put on ice.Protoplast were centrifuged for 3 min (150 x g, 4 °C) and washed twice with W5 buffer. Be careful not to resuspend protoplast to abruptly. After second wash step protoplast were resuspended in 1 ml of MMg solution. Protoplasts were calculated with help of hemocythometer and diluted to optimal concentration of 2 x 104 cells in 100 μl with MMg solution (see Notes 5-7).5-10 μg plasmid DNA coding a tag-protein fusion was alequoted to 2 ml eppendorf tube (see Note 8).",
    "100 μl of isolated protoplasts in MMg medium were transferred to the tube using a pipette tip with the tip of the tip cut off.Using a pipette tip with the tip of the tip cut off 110 μl of PEG solution was added. Solution was gently mixed and left for 15 min at RT in horizontal position (see Note 9).After incubation, 450 μl of W1 buffer was added to the tubes to dilute PEG solution, mixed and centrifuged for 3 min, 300 x g.Supernatant was removed and harvested protoplasts were resuspended in 300 μl of W1 solution.Transfected protoplasts were incubated overnight at 22 °C in horizontal position in the dark for protein expression. It is important not to disturb protoplasts at this stage.From this point protoplasts can be used in various protein analysis techniques (kinase assay, in vivo protein degradation assay, protein subcellular localization, BiFC and FRET analyses) (Ludwikow et al., 2014). Here we show in vivo degradation assay for plant proteins. In vivo degradation assay in protoplastsAfter overnight incubation (as indicated in step A14) in the dark protoplasts were treated with 50 μM MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) or mock treated with 0.1% DMSO for 6 h.After brief centrifugation (300 x g, RT) supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended and disrupted in 100 μl of protein isolation buffer. Protein concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Prepared samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blotting."
