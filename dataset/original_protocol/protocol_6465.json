    "Assay Reagent Formulation (Figure 2)The coupled enzyme mix contains 25 µg/ml ADP-HK, 10 mM Glucose, 400 µM NAD+ and 4 units/ml G6PDH.Notes: Glucose, G6PDH and NAD+ are available commercially. Individual components are stored as stock solutions at -80 °C and mixed on the day.For each measurement, an assay reagent containing ADP-HK, G6PDH, glucose and NAD+ is prepared at 2x concentration (50 µg/ml ADP-HK, 20 mM Glucose, 800 µM NAD+ and 8 units/ml G6PDH) and mixed in the cuvette with an equal volume of 2x concentration substrate. By mixing equal volumes i.e., 100 µl + 100 µl, fast mixing conditions are obtained and concentrations of the assay reagent and substrate are halved.The detectable absorbance signal is produced by NADH which has an absorbance peak at 340 nm (A340) that is not present for NAD+. The extinction coefficient for NADH at 340 nm is 6,220 M-1cm-1. Clone ADP-HK from T. litoralis gDNA into an E. coli expression plasmid and purified by Ni-affinity purification via an N-terminal hexa-Histidine tag followed by size-exclusion chromatography.Produce the ADP-hexokinase in-house by purifying a recombinantly expressed with an N-terminal His-tagged construct.Produce the plasmid by cloning the ADP-hexokinase from Thermococcocus litoralis gDNA (DSM-5473, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) gene into a pRSET-A expression plasmid (Thermo Fisher).For expression, transform the plasmid into chemically competent E. coli KRX (Promega) and grow in 1 L Terrific Broth until OD600 ~0.6-0.8 and then induced with 0.1% (w/v) rhamnose for 15 h at 18 °C.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 2,700 x g for 15 min, resuspend in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.9.Cells are lysed by sonication (Bandelin Sonopuls Sonication) with 2 s on/off pulses for 5 min, followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 80,000 x g (Beckman  Ti 45  rotor in an Allegra J2-21).",
    "Mix the supernatant with 3 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and left on a turning rotor overnight at 4 °C.Wash the resin three times by resuspending in 15 ml of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH 7.9 followed by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min.Elute the protein by washing three times with 15 ml of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 7.9.Concentrate the eluted protein to 1 ml and further purify using size-exclusion chromatography using a Proteosec 6-600 column (Generon) and FPLC on an Äkta Purifier (GE Healthcare).Concentrate the protein to 5 mg/ml with 20% (v/v) glycerol, dispense into 50 µl aliquots and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423235742_7697.jpgFigure 2. ADP-HK expression plasmid map. The expression plasmid for ADP-HK is a modified prSET-A plasmid. The ADP-HK gene from Thermococcocus litoralis (DSM5473) was cloned into the plasmid with a thrombin cleavable hexa-Histidine tag. The insert is under the control of an inducible T7 promoter and a strong ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno RBS).Assay ProcedureNote: The volumes stated are for twenty-five 200 µl reactions, enough to perform controls and produce a 5-point Michaelis-Menten curve in triplicate. Prepare 2.5 ml of assay reagent containing 50 µg/ml ADP-HK, 20 mM Glucose, 800 µM NAD+ and 8 Units G6PDH in reaction buffer.Divide the assay reagent into two unequal parts:2 ml in which the kinase/ATPase being measured is added. It is recommended that the final concentration of enzyme is 1 µM in the first instance. If steady-state conditions are not met, i.e., the reaction is too fast or if the reaction is too slow to be measured, then the concentration of enzyme can be adjusted.0.5 ml in which assay reaction buffer 5 µl of assay buffer is added.",
    "Prepare ATP over the range of concentrations to be measured in reaction buffer. For each concentration prepare ATP at 2x concentration, e.g., for a 10 µM ATP measurement prepare the solution at 20 µM. A recommended concentration range is from 0 mM ATP to 10 times above the expected enzyme KM. For kinases with a second substrate, ensure this is present in large excess to achieve pseudo-Michaelis-Menten conditions (100-fold greater than KM).For each measurement, quickly mix 100 µl of assay reagent with 100 µl of substrate within the quartz cuvette, aspirate 3 times to mix and start measuring the absorbance at A340 for 200 s. Note: Adjust measurement time in accordance with the speed of the reaction so that curve fitting is accurate. Slower kinases may require longer measurement times. Perform positive and negative controls for each assay. Positive control; mixing 100 µM ADP and assay reaction reagent and ensuring the increase at A340 is as expected, corresponding to a stoichiometric amount of NADH. Negative control; mixing 100 µM ATP and assay reagent without the kinase/ATPtase and ensuring there is no increase in A340.Measure activity starting at 0 µM ATP then at increasing ATP concentrations. It is recommended to measure activity at at least 5 different ATP concentrations with the highest concentration at 10-fold above the expected KM."
