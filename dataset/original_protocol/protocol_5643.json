    "Part I: Protocol for resource localization assay (the entire procedure is carried out on the bench)Preparation of synchronized wormsPlace 10 adult hermaphrodites on an OP50-seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plate (see Recipe 2), 6 cm in diameter near the Bunsen burner flame, and incubate for 4 h at 20 °C. Remove adults from the NGM plates near the Bunsen burner flame, and incubate the plates for 4 days at 20 °C (Note 1).Preparation of resource localization assay platesPrepare agar with or without KCl (see Recipe 7).Pour agar without KCl, 13 ml each, into two diagonally located compartments in a quadrant dish.After solidifying, pour agar with KCl, 13 ml each, to each of two remaining compartments (Figures 1A and 1B) (Note 2). Leave the plate without lid at room temperature for 1 h to dry up the agar surface on the bench.Connect the compartments by placing a thin layer of 2.0% molten agar (see Recipe 8), using a P1000 pipetman with a blunted tip. Molten agar at 60 °C is poured along plastic separators from the center to the edge of a tilted plate (Figure 1C). Leave the plate at room temperature for 5 min before use to solidify the molten agar.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211014510_0423.jpgFigure 1.

Note that the agar surface is higher than the top of the plastic separator. C. Pouring of 2.0% molten agar on top of the plastic separator from the center to the edge along the separator.Resource localization assayCollect worms from an NGM culture plate, 6 cm in diameter, to a 1.5 ml tube by washing them off with 1.5 ml of 0.25% aqueous gelatin solution (see Recipe 9).",
    "After worms have settled at the bottom of the tube (< 1.0 min), remove most of the gelatin solution. Wash worms three times with 1.0 ml of 0.25% gelatin solution in the same way as above. Resuspend worms at the concentration of 50-100 worms in ~20 µl of gelatin solution.Place ~20 µl worm suspension at the center of a quadrant plate, using a P100 Pipetman with a blunted tip.Remove as much gelatin solution as possible with a Kimwipes wick.Put the lid on the plate, and incubate the plate for 30 min at room temperature.Place ~100 µl of chloroform on the lid, and then cover the chloroform with the agar plate to sacrifice worms (Video 1).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. How to stop worm chemotaxis. At the end of chemotaxis assay, ~100 µl of chloroform was spread on the lid, and then the agar plate was placed upside down on the lid. The same procedure was used for the termination of chemotaxis in Part II.                                                      Count worms in each of the quadrants to calculate a performance index (PI) using the following equation (worms lying against the side of the plate and on the plastic separators are not counted):PI = [(# of worms in KCl compartments) - (# of worms in reference compartments)]/(# of total worms)Part II: Protocol for chemotaxis assay using a square agar plate Preparation of synchronized worms as described in Part I.Chemotaxis assay on a square plateDraw lines on a square assay plate (see Recipe 11), 10 x 10 cm, as shown in Figure 2A. Prepare worm suspension, which contains ~50 worms per 10 µl, as described above in resource localization assay.Place ~10 µl each of the worm suspension at two places as shown in Figure 2A, using a P100 Pipetman with a blunted tip.",
    "Remove as much gelatin solution as possible with a Kimwipes wick.Wait for ~30 sec until worms start moving.Spot 3 µl each of 1.0% 1-nonanol diluted with ethanol at two places marked with ‘X’ as shown in Figure 2A, and immediately cover it with a lid. Incubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature, and then sacrifice worms with chloroform vapor as described above in resource localization assay.Count the number of worms in two areas with and without 1-nonanol to calculate a chemotaxis index (CI) using the following equation (worms lying against the side of the plate and on the lines are not counted): CI = [(# of worms in odor section) - (# of worms in reference)]/[(# of worms in odor section) + (# of worms in reference)]imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211014854_8281.jpgFigure 2. Chemotaxis away from 1-nonanol on a square agar plate. A. A square chemotaxis assay plate marked with red circles showing places where ~10 µl each of worm suspension was spotted, and with ‘X’ indicating positions where 1-nonanol was spotted. B. A typical example of chemotaxis assay after sacrificing worms with chloroform vapor. Note that most of worms (white dots) were repelled from 1-nonanol odor, and mainly located in the reference area on the assay plate."
