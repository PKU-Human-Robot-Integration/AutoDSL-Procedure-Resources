    "In accordance with Dutch law, approval by the animal welfare committee was not required for this research.\n1. Preparing hiPSC-derived kidney organoids for transplantation\nDifferentiate hiPSCs to kidney organoids using the protocol developed by Takasato et al.4,18,31. Culture the organoids following this protocol on polyester cell culture inserts with 0.4 µm pores (cell culture inserts) until day 7 + 12 of differentiation. Each cell culture insert will contain three organoids.\nRemove the organoids from the cell culture insert.\n\t\nMake a hole in the middle of the membrane of the cell culture insert with a pair of dissecting forceps. Using dissecting scissors, make three cuts in the membrane from the hole in the middle to the edge of the cell culture insert, cutting between the organoids. This will result in three pieces of membrane, each with one organoid attached, which are still connected to the cell culture insert at their outer edge.\nTake hold of one of the pieces of membrane close to its outer edge with a pair of forceps and tear it loose from the cell culture insert. Place the piece of membrane with the attached organoid in a Petri dish. Add a few drops of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without calcium and magnesium (DPBS-/-) to the organoid to avoid dehydration. Repeat for the other two organoids.\nBisect the organoids by holding their membrane in place with forceps and cutting them in half with a double-edge stainless steel razor blade (a whole organoid is too large for the celom to accommodate at this stage of development). Gently push the two organoid halves off the membrane with a dura dissector. Discard the membrane and leave the organoids in DPBS-/- until transplantation.",
    "NOTE: Prepare a maximum of three organoids at a time for transplantation to avoid stress to the organoids prior to transplantation. Ideally, one person prepares the organoids while another performs the transplantation.\n2. Preparing chicken embryos for transplantation\nIncubate fertilized white leghorn eggs. Start the incubation of the eggs on kidney organoid differentiation day 7 + 8 to ensure the correct timing of the transplantation.\n\t\nPlace the fertilized white leghorn eggs (Gallus domesticus) horizontally on a holder (Figure 1A; day 0), marking the middle of the upward-facing side with a pencil.\n\t\tNOTE: Either custom-made plastic holders or egg cartons can be used as holders to incubate the eggs.\nPlace the holder with the eggs in a humidified incubator at 38 ± 1 ºC (Figure 1A; day 0).\nIncubate the eggs for 3 days, keeping the water basin in the incubator filled.\nCreate a window in the eggshell on day 3 of incubation.\n\t\nOn day 3 of incubation, place a small piece (~1 cm x 0.5 cm) of transparent tape on the pointed tip of the egg (small end). Make a small hole in the eggshell in the middle of the transparent tape by tapping it with the sharp end of a pair of dissecting scissors.\nInsert a 19 G needle on a 5 mL syringe into the hole at a 45° angle, avoiding damage to the yolk sac, and aspirate 2-3 mL of albumen from the egg to lower the embryo inside the egg. Seal the hole with a second piece (~1 cm x 0.5 cm) of transparent tape.",
    "Place a large piece (~5 cm x 5 cm) of transparent tape on the pencil-marked, upward-facing side of the egg. Make a hole in the eggshell in the middle of the transparent tape by tapping it with the sharp end of a pair of dissecting scissors (Figure 1A; day 3).\nStarting from this hole, cut a small circular window in the eggshell using curved dissecting scissors. Look through this window to locate the embryo, then enlarge the window to optimize access to the embryo (Figure 1A; day 3).\nRemove any large pieces of eggshell that may have fallen on top of the embryo using forceps. Remove smaller pieces by placing a few drops of DPBS with calcium and magnesium (DPBS+/+) on the embryo with a plastic transfer pipette, then aspirating the DPBS+/+ with the eggshell into the pipette.\nAdd three drops of DPBS+/+ supplemented with 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin to the egg using a plastic transfer pipette.\nCarefully seal the window with a large piece (~5 cm x 5 cm) of transparent tape before placing the egg back in the incubator until day 4 of incubation, when the embryo is in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 23-24 (HH 23-24)32.\n\t\tNOTE: Sealing the window is very important to avoid dehydration and death of the embryo.\nCheck the embryos daily for viability by looking at them through the tape (do not remove the tape to avoid dehydration). During these first days of incubation, the egg yolk color changes from bright to matte yellow upon embryo death. Discard deceased embryos.\nKeep the water basin in the incubator filled.\n3. Intracelomic transplantation on day 4 of incubation\nGaining access to the celomic cavity\n\t\nCut the tape from the window with curved dissecting scissors.\nPlace the egg under a dissecting microscope on a rubber holder or egg carton.",
    "The chicken embryo is now in HH 23-24 and lying on its left side, with its right side facing the viewer (Figure 1A; day 4). Locate the right wing and leg bud of the embryo, as the celom will be accessed between these two limb buds. In the area between the right wing and leg bud, create an opening consecutively in the vitelline membrane, the chorion, and the amnion, by holding them with two pairs of dissecting forceps and gently pulling them in opposite directions.\n\t\tNOTE: The vitelline membrane is the first membrane that is encountered after opening the egg, and in some cases, is already damaged after making the window on day 3. If the embryo is rotated, lying on its right side with its left side facing the viewer (Figure 1A; day 4), it is necessary to turn it around to enable transplantation. To do this, make a large opening in the vitelline and chorion membrane, then carefully turn the embryo around using forceps.\nCheck whether there is unobstructed access to the celomic cavity: gently take hold of the edge of the body wall between the wing and limb bud with a pair of dissecting forceps and pull it slightly toward the viewer. The celomic cavity must be clearly visible. Carefully insert a blunt but slim instrument (e.g., a blunt tungsten wire in a microscalpel holder) into the celomic cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: If insertion of the blunt instrument into the celomic cavity is not possible, it means one or more of the membranes have not been properly opened.\nTransplantation\n\t\nPlace half an organoid inside the egg on top of the allantois using a dura dissector.",
    "Using dissecting forceps, carefully take hold of the edge of the body wall and pull it slightly toward the viewer to make the opening to the celom visible.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid damaging the blood vessels in the body wall.\nGently move the organoid toward and through the opening in the body wall into the celom with a blunt Tungsten wire in a microscalpel holder. Push the organoid slightly cranially to lodge it inside the celom. It is now visible just behind the wing bud (Figure 1A; day 4).\nAdd three drops of DPBS+/+ to the egg using a plastic transfer pipette.\nCarefully seal the window with a large piece (~5 cm x 5 cm) of transparent tape before placing the egg back in the incubator until day 12 of incubation (8 days after transplantation).\nKeep checking the embryos daily for viability by looking at them through the tape (do not remove the tape to avoid dehydration). Discard deceased embryos.\n\t\tNOTE: As the embryos and their chorioallantoic membranes grow, they become more clearly visible through the tape. A lack of movement by the embryo and collapsed or sparse blood vessels are a sign of embryo death.\nCheck the water basin in the incubator daily and keep it filled.\n4. Injection of fluorescently labeled lectin\nPreparing for injection\n\t\nMake glass microinjection needles by pulling glass microcapillaries in a micropipette puller with the following settings: Heat 533, Pull 60, Velocity 150, Time 200. While looking through the dissecting microscope, carefully break the tips off the microinjection needles using dissecting forceps to create an opening.\n\t\tNOTE: The required settings for the micropipette puller may differ depending on the machine.",
    "Assemble the injection system. Take two pieces of 38 cm silicone tubing and connect them to each other by placing a 0.2 µm filter between them. Insert a mouthpiece into the end of the tube that is connected with the filter outlet (silicone tube 1), and a connector to the end of the tube that is connected with the filter inlet (silicone tube 2). Finally, insert the microinjection needle into the connector (Figure 1B).\nDilute fluorescently labeled lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) with DPBS-/- to a concentration of 2.5 mg mL-1 in a 0.5 mL tube and spin down for ~30 s in a microcentrifuge to move the aggregates to the bottom of the tube.\nPipette 20 µL of LCA onto a piece of parafilm.\nAspirate the 20 µL of LCA from the parafilm into the microcapillary needle of the assembled injection system.\nInjection\n\t\nCut the tape from the window with curved dissecting scissors. Place the egg under a dissecting microscope in a rubber holder.\nEvaluate the vasculature and locate the veins, which can be distinguished from the arteries by their slightly brighter red color (Figure 1A; day 12). To improve access to the vasculature, carefully enlarge the window by cutting with curved dissecting scissors. Select a vein for injection based on accessibility and size.\nInsert the tip of the microcapillary needle into the selected vein at a 0°-20º angle. Ensure the needle is in the vein by gently moving the tip from side to side. Gently and steadily blow into the injection system to inject the LCA (Figure 1A; day 12).\n\t\tNOTE: If the needle in the vein is in the correct position, it should stay within the boundaries of the vein.\nPlace the egg back in the incubator for 10 min to let the LCA circulate.",
    "​NOTE: It is not necessary to seal the egg with tape during this time.\n5. Collecting transplanted organoids on day 12 of incubation\nSacrificing the chicken embryo\n\t\nPlace the egg in a rubber holder on the bench. Cut the tape from the window with curved dissecting scissors. Then, cut through the membranes surrounding the embryo with curved dissecting scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: A dissecting microscope is not required for this step.\nScoop the embryo up from the egg with a perforated spoon and immediately decapitate the embryo using scissors. Place the body of the embryo in a Petri dish under the dissection microscope.\nLocating and collecting organoids\n\t\nPlace the embryo on its back in the Petri dish and spread its limbs.\nCarefully open the abdominal wall of the embryo along the longitudinal axis using forceps.\nLocate the organoid inside the embryo. The organoid most frequently becomes attached to the right liver lobe, either at the caudal tip or cranially just below the rib cage (Figure 1A; day 12). It is therefore recommended to start by looking in these locations.\nOnce the organoid is located, remove it from the embryo by cutting around it with micro scissors. Place the organoid and the chicken tissue that is inevitably attached to it in a Petri dish under the dissecting microscope. Remove as much chicken tissue as possible with a double-edge stainless steel razor blade.\nProcess the organoid depending on the desired analysis.\n6. Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining\nPlace a transplanted organoid in a 24-well plate and fix in 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C for 24 h. Wash 3x with DPBS-/-.\nPermeabilize and block the organoid in 300 µL of blocking solution (0.3% Triton-X in DPBS-/- containing 10% donkey serum) for 2 h at room temperature.",
    "Prepare the primary antibody mix: for one organoid, dilute primary antibodies NPHS1 (sheep-α-human, dilution of 1:100), CD31 (mouse-α-human, dilution of 1:100), and LTL (biotin-conjugated, dilution of 1:300) in 300 µL of blocking solution. Add the antibody mix to the organoid and incubate for 72 h at 4 °C.\nWash 3x with 0.3% TritonX in DPBS-/-.\nPrepare the secondary antibody mix: for one organoid, dilute secondary antibodies donkey-α-sheep Alexa Fluor 647 (dilution of 1:500), donkey-α-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (dilution of 1:500), and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 405 (dilution of 1:200) in 300 µL of blocking solution. Add the secondary antibody mix to the organoid and incubate for 2-4 h at room temperature. Cover with aluminum foil to avoid exposure of the secondary antibodies to light.\nWash 3x with DPBS-/-.\nEmbed the organoid in ~30 µL of mounting medium in a 35 mm glass bottom dish and allow to dry overnight at room temperature, covered with aluminum foil. Store at 4 °C.\nImage using a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
