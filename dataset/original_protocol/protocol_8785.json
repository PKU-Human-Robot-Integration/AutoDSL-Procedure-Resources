    "NOTE: All procedures involving living animals were carried out in accordance with the EC directive 86/609/EEC guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the local ethics committee (Thüringer Landesamt für Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz).\n1. Intraperitoneal Injection of Thymidine Analogs\nWeigh animals the day before injection. Calculate the amount of thymidine analog required for all injections planned on the next day as well as individual weight-adjusted injection volumes of a 10 mg/ml stock solution.\nPrepare 10 mg/ml thymidine stock solution. (CAUTION! Thymidine analogs are toxic. Follow the specific Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provided by the suppliers, i.e., wear lab coat and gloves, use a chemical fume hood).\n\t\nTake thymidine analog from the freezer and bring it to RT, approx. 21 °C. Weigh 10 mg and add sterile saline (for BrdU and CldU) or 0.04 N NaOH (in sterile saline; for IdU), vortex. Place for at least 10 - 15 min in a 50 °C water bath and vortex every 2 - 3 min to dissolve the powder.\n\t\tNOTE: Use solutions for up to 24 hr when stored at RT and for several weeks at -20 °C. Protect solutions from light (cover with aluminum foil). Always check for precipitates and re-dissolve if necessary.\nRestrain the mouse by the scruff and intraperitoneally inject an appropriate, weight-adjusted volume of stock solution (at RT) using a fine dosage syringe with a 30 G needle.\n\tNOTE: In case CldU and IdU have to be administered sequentially within the same animal, consider to inject equimolar concentrations (e.g., 42.5 mg/kg CldU and 57.5 mg/kg IdU, which correspond to 50 mg/kg BrdU). Therefore, adjust the injection volumes of the 10 mg/ml stock solutions accordingly.\n2. Tissue Preparation",
    "Prepare 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 on the day before perfusion. Store at 4 °C.\nTranscardially perfuse the deeply anesthetized mice (3.5% isoflurane) via the left ventricle with 10 ml ice-cold PBS, then with 40 ml ice-cold formaldehyde (flow rate 5 ml/min). Dissect the brain and post-fix in the same fixative for 24 hr at 4°C.\nTransfer the brains consecutively into 10% (24 hr at 4°C) and 30% sucrose (until the brain sinks, approx. 48 hr). For freezing, slowly submerge the cryoprotected brains into -25 °C isopentane until no bubbles emerge from the tissue. Store at -80 °C.\nCut coronal sections of 40 µm thickness on a freezing microtome (block temperature at -25 to -16 °C). Sequentially transfer sections into antifreeze solution containing wells of a 24-well cell culture plate (see Figure 1). Store at -20 °C.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52551/52551fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of transferring microtome slices into a 24-well plate. Start at A1 and place subsequent slices into row A, after A6 go to the next row B and so forth. When reaching D6, go back to A1 and continue. This arrangement of slices allows for quantification of every nth section of an entire brain. For quantification of newborn cells take every 6th brain section (equivalent to the content of one column), for immunofluorescence phenotyping take every 12th section (equivalent to the content of 2 alternating rows of one column).\n3. Immunostaining",
    "NOTE: Sections are processed free floating, usually in 6-well plates equipped with a carrier plate and mesh inserts. As an exception, blocking, antibody incubations and ABC reaction are done in 12- or 24-well plates without mesh inserts (0.5 to 1 ml per well is sufficient, depending on the number of slices that have to be stained). During these steps, transfer sections with the help of a fine brush (rinse with each new solution). All incubations are done with continuous agitation (max 150 rpm).\nImmunohistochemistry (ABC method)\nTransfer sections from antifreeze into TBS and rinse thoroughly (once O/N at 4 °C, 5 times at RT for 10 min each) to completely remove antifreeze.\nIncubate for 30 min in 1.5% H2O2 in TBS-T to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Pay attention to bubbling and re-submerge sections if necessary. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nOptional: Meanwhile preheat a heating cabinet and 2 N HCl to 37 °C. Incubate sections for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 N HCl to denature DNA. Gently separate sections with the help of a brush.\nOptional: Neutralize sections for 10 min in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8.5, RT. While transferring, briefly swab the mesh inserts containing the sections on a paper towel to remove HCl leavings. Rinse 2 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nIncubate in TBSplus to permeabilize the tissue and to block unspecific antibody binding sites, 1 hr at RT.\nIncubate in primary antibody diluted in TBSplus, O/N at 4 °C. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nIncubate in biotinylated secondary antibody diluted in TBSplus, 3 hr at RT. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each. Meanwhile...",

Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nPrepare 50 ml 0.5 mg/ml DAB in TBS-T per 6- or 12-well plate, split into two halves and pipette 4 ml or 2 ml per well, respectively. Transfer sections into DAB solution (CAUTION! DAB is toxic. Follow the specific MSDS provided by the supplier, i.e., wear lab coat and gloves, use a chemical fume hood).\nAdd 0.5 ml 1% H2O2 to the remaining 25 ml DAB solution, mix and pipette equivalent volumes as above to each well to start peroxidase reaction. Incubate for 12 min. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nMount sections to slides in gelatin, air dry O/N. Coverslip with permanent mounting medium.\nOptional: Counterstain before placing the coverslip (see section 3.5).\n\t\tNOTE: If the signal-to-noise ratio is low because of high background, repeat H2O2 treatment after the incubation with AB reagent (step 3.1.8).\nMultiple-immunofluorescence\nSingle or simultaneous multiple immunofluorescence\nTransfer sections from antifreeze into TBS and rinse thoroughly (once O/N at 4 °C, 5 times at RT for 10 min each) to completely remove antifreeze.\nOptional: as steps 3.1.3 - 3.1.4.\nIncubate in TBSplus to permeabilize the tissue and block unspecific antibody binding sites, 1 hr at RT.\nIncubate in primary antibody cocktail (e.g., rat α-BrdU, guinea pig α-DCX, goat α-GFP) diluted in TBSplus, O/N at 4°C. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.",
    "Incubate in cocktail of fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (e.g., Rhodamine Red α-rat, Alexa-647 α-guinea pig, Alexa-488 α-goat; all derived in donkey) diluted in TBSplus, 3 hr at RT or O/N at 4 °C. From now on protect sections from light. Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each.\nMount sections to slides in gelatin, air dry O/N.

From now on protect sections from light. Rinse 3 times in TBS and once in TBS-T for 10 min each.\nIncubate in 10% normal serum from same host as the primary antibodies (e.g., rabbit serum) for 3 hr RT to saturate open paratopes on the first secondary antibody. Rinse 3 times in TBS and once in TBS-T for 10 min each.\nIncubate in TBSplus with 50 µg/ml unconjugated monovalent Fab fragments directed against the host of the primary antibodies (e.g., α-rabbit IgG (H+L)) to cover epitopes that could be recognized by the second secondary antibody, O/N at 4 °C.\nRinse at least 3 times in TBS and once in TBS-T for 10 min each. While transferring, briefly swab the mesh inserts containing the sections on a paper towel to remove any Fab leavings.\nIncubate in second primary antibody (e.g., rabbit α-antigen B), O/N at 4 °C. Rinse 3 times in TBS and once in TBS-T for 10 min each.",

Rinse 3 times in TBS for 15 min each, mount and coverslip as above.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To label antigens with antibodies from different host species add them to step 3.2.2.2 and the respective secondary antibodies to step 3.2.2.3.\nOne of the secondary antibodies from same species as one of the primary antibodies\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol is suitable for quadruple-staining against BrdU or Ki67 together with GFAP, nestin-GFP and DCX.\n\t\t\nFollow strictly protocol steps 3.2.1.1 - 3.2.1.5. Until this point use only donkey serum in TBSplus.\nIncubate in TBSplus containing 3% goat serum for 1 hr at RT. This covers open paratopes on the α-goat secondary antibody.

    "Add goat α-GFP to the primary antibody cocktail.\nAdd a fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibody with spectral properties similar to GFP (such as Alexa 488 conj. donkey α-goat) to the secondary antibody cocktail.\nEpitope retrieval\nCarry out epitope retrieval after rinsing out antifreeze. Preheat steamer with 6- or 12-well plates containing 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 6.0 to 95 - 99 °C (approximately 25 min).\nTransfer the sections into the hot citrate buffer and steam for 30 min (cover the plates with aluminum foil as plastic lids are not heat-resistant).\nImmediately place the plates in an ice bath to cool down.
