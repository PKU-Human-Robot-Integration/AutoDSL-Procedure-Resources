    "Genetic crossCollect en-Gal4 virgin female flies from bottles.Collect UAS-X male flies from bottles or vials.Collect virgins and males under anesthesia using a carbon dioxide pad.Note: Do not leave flies on carbon dioxide pad for over 5 min, as this could decrease the viability and fecundity of flies. Place anesthetized flies together in a vial (for a small scale experiment, 5 virgin females + 3-5 males) or bottle (for large scale, 30 virgin females + 10-20 males) for mating as shown in step 1 of Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4241/bioprotoc-11-23-4241-g001.jpgFigure 1. Fly cross scheme. Incubate mating vial/bottle at room temperature (RT) for a day.Move vial/bottle to an incubator set at 29°C (Gal4 activity increases in correlation with temperature. A temperature of 29°C provides a maximal Gal4 activity and robust overexpression of target gene ‘X,’ but could be harmful to fertility and viability depending on the Gal4 driver and UAS-X strains. Hence, temperature may be adjusted to achieve optimal expression of gene X).Wait until 3rd instar larval progeny carrying en-Gal4 and UAS-X are found (step 2 in Figure 1) (It normally takes 5 to 6 days).Demecolcine stock solution preparationTo a demecolcine glass vial (5 mg), add 1.35 ml of pure ethanol to make a 10 mM stock solution.Note: You can also make a 1 mM stock solution to minimize pipetting error. But, if your target cells/tissues are sensitive to ethanol, you can use a more concentrated form (100 mM stock) or use DMSO as a solvent. Aliquot and store the solution at -20°C.Tissue dissectionAcclimate aliquoted Express Five SFM medium to RT if it was stored in the fridge.Add the insulin supplement to Express Five SFM medium for a concentration of 6.2 μg/ml to make the dissection medium.Note: To prevent contamination, it is recommended to add insulin in the lab hood.",
    "Collect wandering 3rd instar larvae with forceps.Note: Do not grab larvae strongly with the forceps. It could tear or crush tissues. Collect at least 5-10 larvae per genotype.Put larvae in a 9 well glass dish and wash with 200 μl of PBS at least two times to remove any residual substances from the larvae surface.After thorough washing, transfer larvae to 200 μl of dissection medium made at Step C2.Note: Do not leave larvae in dissection medium for more than 30 min. Put a single larva in each well of a new 9 well glass dish that contains 200 μl of dissection medium (Do not put the dish on ice).(Critical step) Dissect larva with forceps [For a detailed video protocol, please see Purves and Brachmann (2007)].Gently grab the mouth hook of the larva with one forceps and use the other forceps to hold the larva gently at 1/3 body length from the mouth hook (Figure 2B).Gently pull the mouth hook while holding the body (You can also pull the body instead of the mouth hook).When the larva is torn apart, get rid of the body part and keep the imaginal discs attached to the mouth hook. Imaginal discs can be identified by their transparent sac-like morphology. Eye-antenna discs are attached to the larval brain. Wing discs are the largest among the imaginal discs and have a characteristic shape, as shown in the graphic summaryRevert the remaining part inside-out using both forceps.Note: This step needs to be done with caution. Sharp tips of forceps may tear or harm the imaginal discs. Dissection speed should be fast enough to minimize tissue damage or over-incubation, especially for labeling unfixed samples. If it is hard to speed up, try to keep the incubation time the same for all samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4241/bioprotoc-11-23-4241-g002.jpgFigure 2. Graphical scheme of larval dissection.",
    "(A) Schematic diagram of larval organs. (B) Graphical explanation of the imaginal disc dissection. Two forceps are used to grab a larva. The body is torn apart by pulling the forceps. The imaginal discs and the brain are attached to the mouth hook in the anterior portion of the larva. The imaginal discs can be exposed by reverting the anterior part inside-out.When the dissection step is finished, transfer the dissected tissues to a new well containing 200 μl of fresh dissection medium.Sample preparation and imaging for live unfixed tissues (Protocol 1)Add SiR500-tubulin (1:500) and verapamil (final concentration: 10 μM) to the dissected tissues.Note: Dilution of SiR-tubulin and verapamil may vary depending on tissues. Optimal dilution should be determined experimentally for different tissue types. Incubate tissues with agitation (100 rpm) for 30 min at RT. Note: Minimize light exposure during incubation by using aluminum foil, as shown in Figure 3.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4241/bioprotoc-11-23-4241-g003.jpgFigure 3. Light shielding chamber with 9 well glass plate. The 150 mm Petri dish is wrapped with aluminum foil and black paper to make a light shielding chamber.Briefly wash the tissues at least twice with 200 μl of dissection medium.(Critical step) Further incubate tissues in 200 μl of dissection medium containing 50 μM demecolcine for 15 min at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Note: For a control without demecolcine, dissected tissues are incubated in the same way but without demecolcine. Precise timing of demecolcine treatment is critical to get consistent and meaningful results. The length of incubation can be varied according to the target gene or application, so some preliminary tests are needed to determine the optimal incubation time. After incubation, mount the wing discs as follows.Transfer the tissues to 200 μl of dissection medium containing 50 μM demecolcine without any washing step.",
    "Note: The following dissection steps should be completed within 15 min for best results. Place 10 μl of dissection medium on a glass slide.(Critical step) Separate the wing discs using forceps and mount them on the glass slide.After mounting 3-5 discs, cover the samples using a coverslip.Gently wipe excess media with Kimwipes and seal with coverslip sealant.Note: Nail polish can be used instead of commercial sealant. Perform live imaging using a confocal microscope.Carefully select wing discs prior to imaging.Damaged or folded imaginal discs should be excluded to avoid misinterpretation.Check whether microtubules are evenly labeled with SiR-Tub, as shown in Figure 4.Use a Cy5 filter set, as the optical property of SiR-Tub is as follows: absorption wavelength (λabs) - 652 nm, and fluorescence wavelength (λfl) - 674 nm.To find optimal imaging conditions (laser intensity, imaging speed, averaging numbers), considering that slow imaging or high laser intensity should be avoided to minimize photobleaching. With the LSM710, set the laser to less than 10% of the maximum intensity with imaging speed 1.(Optional) For more detailed analysis, a time-series image acquisition may be used. In this case, the total imaging time should not exceed 30 min per wing disc.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4241/bioprotoc-11-23-4241-g004.jpgFigure 4. Optimal example of SiR-Tub wing imaginal disc staining. (A-A’’) Undamaged and unfolded wing disc with even SiR-Tub labeling. A: Anterior. P: Posterior. Scale bar: 50 μm. GFP: green. SiR-Tub: white.Sample preparation and imaging for fixed tissues (Protocol 2)(Critical step) Incubate dissected tissues (from Procedure C) in dissection media with or without 50 μM demecolcine for 75 min at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Note: For control without demecolcine, dissected tissues are incubated in the same way but without demecolcine. The precise timing of demecolcine treatment is critical to get consistent and meaningful results.",
    "The length of incubation can be varied according to the target gene or application, so some preliminary tests are needed to determine the optimal incubation time. After incubation, wash out residual demecolcine from tissues with gentle pipetting at least twice using 200 μl of dissection media.Note: Each wash should not exceed 1 min. After removing the wash buffer, fix tissues with 100 μl of fixative (EGS 10 mM in PBS) for 10 min with agitation (100 rpm) at RT.Note: EGS fixative is strongly recommended. Other fixatives like 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) work poorly in this application. Fixing time and temperature should be optimized prior to the experiment. Remove the fixative.Note: EGS incubation at RT may cause precipitation of white aggregates. However, such precipitation has no significant negative effect and can be cleared by several washing steps. Wash briefly with 200 μl of PBS twice for 5 min total with agitation (100 rpm).After removing the PBS, incubate tissues with 200 μl 0.5% PBT solution (see Recipes) for 30 min at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Note: This step is for tissue permeabilization. The concentration of Triton X-100 can be modified for different applications. After removing the 0.5% PBT solution, incubate the tissues with 200 μl of blocking buffer (see Recipes) for 30 min at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Note: If you are not going to use antibodies for immunostaining, skip steps from E8 to E11. During the blocking step, prepare the primary antibody sets in 100 μl of blocking buffer at the desired concentration.After blocking, remove the blocking buffer and add the primary antibody to the tissues. Incubate for 1 h at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Note: You can also incubate overnight at 4°C.",
    "After incubation, remove the primary antibody solution and rinse with 200 μl of washing buffer (see Recipes) for 1 min. Then, remove the washing buffer.Add 200 μl of washing buffer for 10 min at RT with agitation (100 rpm).Remove the washing buffer. Repeat this washing step at least three times.During the washing step, prepare the secondary antibody sets in 100 μl of blocking buffer at the desired dilutions.After the washing step, remove the washing buffer and add the prepared secondary antibody sets to the tissues.Add SiR-Tub (1:500) to the tissues and incubate for 1 h at RT with agitation (100 rpm). Note: Minimize light exposure during incubation using aluminum foil, as shown in Figure 3.  Add 200 μl of washing buffer and incubate for 10 min at RT with agitation.Remove the washing buffer. Repeat this washing step at least three times.After the washing step, replace the washing buffer with 200 μl of PBS.(Critical step) After incubation, perform further dissection and mounting.Drop 10 μl of mounting solution (Vectashield) on the glass slide.Dissect wing discs using forceps and mount them on the glass slide.After mounting 3-5 discs, cover the samples using a coverslip.Gently wipe excess media with Kimwipes and seal with a coverslip sealant.Note: Nail polish can be used instead of commercial sealant. Perform imaging using a confocal microscope.Carefully select imaginal discs prior to confocal imaging.Damaged or folded imaginal discs should be excluded to avoid potential misinterpretation.Check whether microtubules are evenly stained with SiR-Tub as shown in Figure 4.Use a Cy5 filter-set as per SiR-Tub’s optical property: λabs, 652 nm, and λfl, 674 nm.Find optimal imaging conditions (laser intensity, averaging number, and imaging speed) considering that slow imaging or high laser intensity should be avoided to minimize photobleaching. With the LSM710, set the laser to less than 10% of the maximum intensity.",
