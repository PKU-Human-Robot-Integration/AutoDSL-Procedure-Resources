    "Ethics statement: The following protocol meets the requirements of the Ethical Committee of the Department of Psychology at the University of Amsterdam for testing human participants.\n1. Screening\nThe characteristics of the sample have an influence on the results. Screen subjects for possible covariate traits, such as color blindness, literacy, synesthesia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder (ADD), neurological and psychological trauma. Age and gender have an influence on learning and memory, as well as the neurobiology of the brain34,35. These factors matter when choosing experimental groups, although these factors have not yet been systematically tested in terms of specific effects on learning letter-color associations.\nQuestion participants about how motivated they are to participate in the study. The motivation of the participants is essential for the quality of the results because participants must be willing to read outside of the lab. The great thing about this method is that they are able to read what they choose.\nTo test for the presence of synesthesia, use a consistency test, either a questionnaire or computer based test-retest paradigm2,25,36 or an existing verified online testing service37. Dutch participants may use our testing website: www.synesthesie.net.\nIf the experimental protocol includes MRI measurements, make sure to additionally screen for health risks associated with MRI scanning.\n2. Stimuli\nReading material - It is important that participants are motivated to read, therefore provide interesting reading material. Importantly, do not violate copyright laws. It is unlawful to copy and reprint copyright-protected books without explicit permission from the copyright holder. There are sources of copyright-free books, e.g. Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org) or ask a publisher permission to use their copyrighted material. Ensure that the books are relatively long (we recommend a minimum of 40,000 words).",
    "Ask each participant which books he or she would like to read based on the reading material offered. Ideally, participants should continue reading for an extended period of time and read each day, which may eventually lead to reading several books. Tell the participants that reading more books is encouraged. This is a good procedure to follow because it helps to ensure that participants are trained over longer periods of time.\nLetters and colors - Choose four relatively frequent letters (we will use: a, e, n, and r) and four frequent colors (e.g. red, orange, green, and blue). It is important to know the relative letter frequencies of the letters chosen because letter frequency determines how often the participants see a particular letter in color. In addition, letter frequency may interact with letter-color preference. Although it is not necessary to use relative letter frequency as an independent variable in the analysis, it is important to estimate how often a participant will view a letter in a specific color. Choosing low-frequency letters will result in very infrequent letter-color presentations and may decrease the possibilities of acquiring learned letter-color associations. Estimated relative frequencies of the above four letters in the Dutch language are: e = 19%, n = 10%, a = 7.5%, and r = 6%.",
    "Match the colors in the book to the colors on the computer screen (that will be used for the testing sessions). Adjust the RGB values in the stimulus computer to match the colored ink on the paper. We recommend asking several people to verify that the colors on screen match the colors in the book. Ask if the colors of the letters match the colors in the book for all letters in all colors (to cover all possible congruent and incongruent combinations). Furthermore, use a testing room where the lighting conditions can be controlled in order to prevent changes in lighting during different testing sessions (e.g. use a room with no windows and always use the same setting on the lights).\nIn order to balance letter frequency with pre-existing letter-color pair preferences, we recommend that the letters be split into 'high-' and 'low-frequency' groups: for example, 'e' and 'n' are the high-frequency letters (average frequency = 14.5%), while 'a' and 'r' are the low-frequency letters (average frequency = 6.8%).\nEvaluate the presence of existing letter-color pair preferences. Most people have implicit preferences for letters in certain colors, and this preference may have an effect on the association that will be trained. Using a 5-point Likert scale, ask participants to rate their preferences for the 16 combinations of four letters with four colors. Instruct participants to “Please indicate to what extent you like the following letter-color pairs. (1 = strongly dislike, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly preferred).\" Preferred letter-color pairs are defined as a rating of 3 to 5. Nonpreferred letter-color pairs are defined as a rating of 1 to 3. The rating '3' is included in both groups because some subjects may rate all pairs as 3, indicating that they have no preferences.",
    "Randomly assign participants to two preference groups in order to test and control for an interaction between letter frequency and letter-color pair preference. For participants in preference group 1, assign letters 'e' and 'n' the preferred colors based on the questionnaire ratings (ratings 3-5). Assign letters 'a' and 'r' the nonpreferred colors based on the questionnaire ratings (ratings 1-3). For participants in preference group 2, assign letters 'e' and 'n' the nonpreferred colors based on the questionnaire ratings (ratings 1-3). Assign letters 'a' and 'r' the preferred colors based on the questionnaire ratings (ratings 3-5).\nChange the font in each book to Arial Black 10 pt. This font is used because it is bold and the colors stand out of the page more than they would if a thin-style font were used.\nBased on the letter-color assignments per participant, prepare the colored books in Microsoft Office Word. A customized Visual Basic Macro can be programmed that replaces each instance of a certain letter in black into a different color. A copy of this code can be found in Appendix A.\nPrint and bind the books. Do not hand out any books until all prereading testing has been completed, including scanning.\nInstruct participants not to read in bad lighting conditions. It is important that all colors are vivid and clearly visible while reading.",
    "Instruct participants to keep track of how much they have read between testing sessions. Consider asking participants to also record how much they read per a unit of time by recording the number of pages read per hours or minutes. (e.g. pages/day can be converted to words/day or words/week). We note that not all of our participants have been diligent about recording the amount of reading they did each day. Therefore, we recommend that participants be as motivated as possible to do so; it helps to have participants write directly in the books. Obtaining an accurate representation of how much each participant read is important. After the participants finish reading, record the number of words and characters that each participant has read for the analyses.\nDecide before the experiment starts if participants will be excluded if they do not read a certain number of words by the time of the second testing session or if they stop reading a certain number of days before the second testing session will take place.\n3. Testing Learned Letter-color Associations in the Behavioral Lab\nSoftware is needed for the visual presentation of stimuli and the recording of response times and accuracy. Our lab uses the software Presentation (www.neurobs.com). However, software such as E-prime or MATLAB can also be used.\nTest participants both before and after reading the colored books. Use the following protocol during both the pre- and post-reading testing sessions. Make an appointment to test each participant. The appointment for the second testing session can be made at the same time or afterward. Make sure to give each participant the exact same protocol each time he or she is tested.",
    "Decide which keyboard keys to use. It is best to avoid keys that correspond to letters in the experiment. In this experiment, the following keyboard keys will be used: M, <, >, and /.\nCounterbalance the letter-key assignments by randomly assigning participants to different keyboard conditions in order to ensure that the same letter is not always paired with the same finger for all participants. Make sure that the keyboard conditions are balanced within the preference groups. In the current experiment, two keyboard conditions are used: For participants in keyboard condition 1, the keys M, <, >, and / correspond to letters e, n, a, and r, respectively. For participants in keyboard condition 2, the keys M, <, >, and / correspond to letters r, a, n, and e, respectively.\nA color-key training phase is necessary before the Stroop task is administered in order for participants to be able to react as fast as possible to the colors. Assign each key the congruent color for the letter that it corresponds to. The color assigned to each key will vary between participants because each participant is assigned a personalized set of letter-color pairs (see Stimuli), and each letter is assigned to a certain key (see step 3.3). We recommend putting colored stickers on the keys per participant.\nInstruct participants to use only one hand when responding and make sure that all participants use the same hand (this is because participants use only one hand in the MRI scanner).\nAdminister the color-key training. Present the four colors on screen (colored squares with visual angle = 3°) one at a time in random order and instruct participants to respond with the correct key as fast and as accurately as possible.",
    "Give feedback after each trial for accuracy. Present 192 trials (48 times/color), giving participants a short break half way through the training.\nMonitor participants to make sure that by the end of the training, they respond quickly and accurately (>95% correct) without looking at their fingers. If this is not the case, readminister the training session. After the participant is properly trained on the color-key mappings, administer the Stroop task.\nUse a modified version of the classic Stroop task in order to test for automatic associations between the letters and colors18.\nCompare the following letter conditions with each other: congruent (the same letter-color pairings that each participant read in his or her books), and incongruent (all letter-color pairings that each participant did not read in his or her books).\nMake sure that the experiment has an equal number of congruent and incongruent stimuli in each condition. In the current experiment, 96 trials/condition are given (per testing session). Give participants at least one break during the Stroop task.\nPresent letters on screen one at a time (average visual angle = 2°). Present all stimuli in the center of the screen on a white background.\nA single trial consists of one of four letters presented for 200 msec in black, followed by that same letter presented in one of four colors until a response is made (reaction time) or 2,000 msec (missed trial). Do not give feedback on accuracy.\nJitter the inter-trial interval (a fixation cross) with a random integer between 1,000-2,000 msec.\nRandomize the presentation of the congruent and incongruent stimuli (not a blocked design).\nInstruct participants to indicate the color that the letter is presented in as fast and as accurately as possible (using the keys they were just trained to associate with each color).",
    "Measure the participants' reaction time and accuracy on each trial.\n4. Testing Learned Letter-color Associations in the MRI Scanner\nTest participants in the scanner both before and after reading the colored books. The following protocol should be followed during both the pre- and post-reading testing sessions. Make an appointment to test each participant on the same day as the behavioral testing session. Make sure to give each participant the exact same protocol each time he or she is tested. When possible, maintain the same order of behavioral testing and MRI scanning during both the pre- and post-testing sessions for each participant.\nConsult with the MRI specialist at your location to determine the appropriate scan settings and scan sequences for that particular MRI scanner. We recommend acquiring whole-brain volumes for all functional and structural scans. We suggest simultaneously recording respiration and heart rate while collecting functional MRI data to be used as possible confound regressors.\nTrain the color-key response mappings: follow steps 3.5-3.8 when participants are going to be scanned before they are tested in the computer lab or if a significant amount of time has passed between the behavioral testing and the scan session. Administer the color-key training before participants go into the scanner.\nUse a four-button response box in order for participants to respond to the task while they are in the scanner. Ensure that the color-key response mappings in the scanner are identical to the mappings that the participants have practiced on the keyboard.\nAdminister a similar Stroop task in the scanner as the one administered in the behavioral lab (see steps 3.9-3.17). Take the following into account when designing the Stroop task for the MRI protocol:\n\t\nDesign the Stroop task as an event-related paradigm (not a blocked design).",
    "Split the Stroop task into at least two separate runs to avoid fatigue-related performance decline. It is recommended to use the same number of total trials in both the MRI and behavioral sessions.\nEnsure that each run has an equal number of congruent and incongruent stimuli (e.g. 48 trials/congruency condition).\nEnsure that the colored letters remain on screen for the same amount of time during each trial (e.g. 2 sec). Ensure that the letters are not removed from the screen upon the event of a button-press. Instruct participants that this is the case. Inform them that they should not expect the letters to immediately disappear upon a response as they do in the behavioral lab and that they may assume that their responses are recorded so long as they push the buttons. Make sure to independently verify that the responses are being logged properly.\nJitter the inter-trial interval (ITI) as the following: 50% of ITIs = 2 sec, 33.3% of ITIs = 4 sec, 5.6% of ITIs = 6 sec, 5.6% of ITIs = 7 sec, 5.6% of ITIs = 8 sec.\nRandomize the presentation of the congruent and incongruent stimuli (not a blocked design).\nInstruct participants to indicate the color that the letter is presented in as fast and as accurately as possible (using the keys they were just trained to associate with each color).\nMeasure the participants' reaction time and accuracy on each trial while acquiring functional MRI images.",
    "In addition to functional imaging, structural images may also be acquired before and after reading during the scan sessions. For example, T1-weighted images that can be used in voxel-based morphometry38 and cortical-surface area analyses39, and diffusion-weighted images that can be used in fractional anisotropy40 or tractography analyses41. We recommend acquiring two T1-weighted volumes and four diffusion-weighted runs per testing session.\n5. Subjective Experience of the Participants\nEvaluate the participants' experiences of reading in color. An example questionnaire is given in Appendix B."
