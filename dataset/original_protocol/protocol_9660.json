    "1. Design and construction of the sgRNA/crRNA expression cassette\nNOTE: There are two kinds of sgRNA/crRNA expression cassettes: one-termed SNR5210-is composed of the RNA polymerase III-dependent SNR52 promoter, the sgRNA/crRNA sequence, and the SUP4 terminator; another-abbreviated as RGR11-consists of the RNA polymerase II-dependent ADH1 promoter, the RGR (ribozyme-guide RNA-ribozyme) structure that contains two ribozymes (a hammerhead ribozyme-HH, and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme-HDV) and the sequence of the sgRNA/crRNA in-between, and the ADH1 terminator. The sgRNA guiding Cas9 homologs are made of a spacer sequence and the characteristic direct repeat12, whereas the crRNA for Cas12a proteins comprises the direct repeat followed by the spacer sequence13,14 (see Supplementary Table 1 for all DNA sequences used in this study).\nDesign the spacer sequence for Cas9/Cas12a-mediated transcriptional activation.\n\t\nHarness the bacterial lex operator sequence (named lexOp) to be the target site15,16 and insert it into the CYC1 promoter that drives the expression of the yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP)17. Hence, the spacer sequence is defined by and complementary to the inserted lexOp.\nCheck the orthogonality of the spacer sequence via the CRISPRDIRECT tool18.\n\t\nPaste the lexOp sequence flanked by the PAM sequence in the text field, define the PAM sequence as NRG for dCas9 and TTTV for dCas12a, and specify the species from the drop-down list as Budding Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) S288C Genome. Click on Design. Make sure there is no matching target site in 20mer+PAM nor in 12mer+PAM search.\nConstruct the sgRNA/crRNA expression cassette.\n\t\nUse touchdown PCR to amplify the DNA sequences of standard biological parts, like promoters, coding sequences, and terminators.",
    "Prepare a reaction mixture containing: 20-40 ng of DNA template, 1 µL of 10 µM forward primer (i.e., ot25, sgRNA/crRNA expression plasmid construction), 1 µL of 10 µM reverse primer (i.e., ot26, sgRNA/crRNA expression plasmid construction), 5 µL of 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 µL of DNA polymerase, 10 µL of 5x DNA polymerase reaction buffer, and double distilled water (ddH2O) up to a total volume of 50 µL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Refer to Supplementary Table 2 for a list of primers used in this study.\nRun the touchdown PCR program on a thermocycler:\n\t\t\tStage 1: 98 °C for 30 s.\n\t\t\tStage 2 with 10 cycles: 98 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s.\n\t\t\tStage 3 with 25 cycles: 98 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s.\n\t\t\tStage 4: 72 °C for 2 min.\n\t\t\tFinally, hold at 4 °C until starting the follow-up experiments.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The 68 °C in stage 2 and 59 °C in stage 3 depend on the melting temperatures of both forward and reverse primers, varying from different pairs of primers. The time at 72 °C in stages 2 and 3 is determined by the PCR product's length and the DNA polymerase's speed.\nIsolate the PCR products via gel electrophoresis (100 V, 30 min). Elute the DNA sequences from the agarose gel via a DNA gel extraction kit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: A 0.8% agarose gel is required for fragments longer than 500 nt, a 1.5% agarose gel for fragments between 100 nt and 500 nt, and a 2% agarose gel for fragments shorter than 100 nt.\nInsert the TU expressing sgRNA/crRNA into a pRSII404/424 shuttle vector19, which contains the ampicillin resistance gene and the yeast-selectable auxotrophic marker gene-TRP1.",
    "Digest the shuttle vector at 37 °C for 1 h with the two restriction enzymes SacI and Acc65I. Prepare the reaction mixture by adding 5 µg of the shuttle vector, the recommended amounts of enzymes, digestion buffer (according to the enzyme instructions), and ddH2O up to a total volume of 30 µL.\nVerify the shuttle vector digestion via gel electrophoresis (see substep 1.3.2). Then, inactivate the two enzymes at 65 °C for 20 min.\nUse the Gibson assembly method20 to insert the purified PCR products into the cut-open shuttle vector by letting in the equimolar DNA mixture at 50 °C for 1 h.\nTransform Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells with the above Gibson reaction mixture via the heat shock transformation method21. Transfer the transformed E. coli cells onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing ampicillin (0.1 g/L). Put the plates into the incubator at 37 °C and let the cells grow overnight.\nPick four colonies from the LB agar plate and culture them separately overnight at 37 °C in LB solution containing ampicillin (0.1 g/L). Then, use the mini-preparation procedure to extract plasmids from the E. coli cells22.\nUse the primers ot18 and ot19 (see Supplementary Table 2 for oligo sequences) to sequence and confirm the inserted transcription unit via the Sanger method23.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: In later experiments, the constructed and confirmed plasmids will be inserted into the yeast genome via the PEG/LiAc protocol24.\n2. Design and construction of the scaffold RNA expression cassette\nNOTE: The scaffold guide RNA (scRNA) is composed of the sgRNA sequence and the MS2 hairpin structures25. Two kinds of MS2 hairpin structures are used in this work: wild-type MS2 hairpin-wt, and f6 MS2 coat protein (MCP) aptamer-f6.\nSynthesize an scRNA template that is able to accommodate different spacer sequences (i.e., pSNR52-spacer_DR(SpCas9)-2×MS2(wt+f6)-SUP4t).",
    "​NOTE: In this study, the scRNA template was synthesized by a gene synthesis company (see Table of Materials).\nDesign proper primers (see Supplementary Table 2) to run PCR on the necessary spacer sequences.\nFollow the procedures in step 1.3 to construct an scRNA expression cassette.\n3. dSpCas9 engineering and expression plasmid construction\nObtain the plasmid pTPGI_dSpCas9_VP64 (see Table of Materials).\nConstruct the acceptor vector pRSII406-pGPD-ATG-XbaI-XhoI-CYC1t, based on the pRSII406 shuttle vector, via touchdown PCR and the Gibson assembly method (refer to step 1.3). The plasmid provides a strong constitutive promoter-pGPD, and a terminator-CYC1t.\nDigest the pTPGI_dCas9_VP64 plasmid and the newly constructed acceptor vector (5 µg for 1 h or 10 µg for overnight-see step 1.3.3.1 as a reference) with XbaI and XhoI at 37 °C. Separate and purify the insert fragment and acceptor vector as in step 1.3.2.\nLigate the purified insert fragment and the acceptor vector with T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C for 8 h. Prepare the ligation solution by adding 50-100 ng of the purified acceptor vector, purified target fragments in equimolar amount with the acceptor vector, 1.5 µL of T4 buffer, 0.5 µL of T4 ligase, and ddH2O up to a total volume of 15 µL.\nFollow steps 1.3.3.3 and 1.3.3.4. Then, confirm that the newly constructed plasmid is correct by digestion with XbaI and Xhol (37 °C, 1 h) and gel electrophoresis (see step 1.3.2).\n4. dCas12a engineering and plasmid construction\nConstruct the plasmids expressing dCas12a-AD.\n\t\nSynthesize two yeast codon-optimized dCas12a proteins (denAsCas12a and dLbCas12a) flanked by BamHI and Xhol restriction enzyme sites.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, the two yeast codon-optimized dCas12a proteins were synthesized by a gene synthesis company (see Table of Materials).",
    "Construct the acceptor vector pRSII406-promoter-ATG-NLS-GS-HIStag-GS-BamHI-sp-XhoI-AD-NLS-TAA-mTGUO1 via touchdown PCR and the Gibson assembly method (see step 1.3), where the \"promoter\" is either pGPD or pGAL1, \"sp\" represents a short random sequence, and \"AD\" is either VPR or VP64.\nInsert each dCas12a protein into the two newly constructed acceptor vectors via digestion with BamHI and XhoI and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (refer to steps 3.3 and 3.4).\nConstruct the plasmids expressing a bare dCas12a.\n\t\nConstruct an acceptor vector for the galactose-inducible expression cassettes of dCas12a as pRSII406-Acc651-pGAL1-ATG-NLS-GS-HIStag-GS-BamHI-sp-XhoI-GS-NLS-TAA-CYC1t using touchdown PCR and the Gibson assembly method (see step 1.3).\nDigest the plasmids containing the dCas12a proteins and the above acceptor vector with BamHI and Xhol, then ligate them with T4 DNA ligase to get the plasmid pRSII406-pGAL1-Acc651-ATG-NLS-GS-HIStag-GS-BamHI-dCas12a-XhoI-GS-NLS-TAA-CYC1t (refer to steps 3.3 and 3.4).\nDigest the plasmid obtained in step 4.2.2 with Acc65I and BamHI, and then replace pGAL1 with pGPD via touchdown PCR and the Gibson assembly method to construct pRSII406-pGPD-ATG-NLS-GS-HIStag-GS-BamHI-dCas12a-XhoI-GS-NLS-TAA-CYC1t.\n5. Anti-CRISPR protein engineering and plasmid construction\nNOTE: Three kinds of promoters have been employed to drive Acrs expression: an inducible promoter-pGAL1, four yeast constitutive promoters-pGPD, pACT1, pTEF1, and pTEF2, and a synthetic constitutive promoter-genCYC1t_pCYC1noTATA26.\nObtain the plasmids containing the sequences of type II Acrs (AcrIIA2, AcrIIA427, and AcrIIA528) and type V-A Acrs (AcrVA1, AcrVA4, and AcrVA529) from a gene synthesis company.\nConstruct the plasmids based on the pRSII403 shuttle vector to express Acrs.\n\t\nConstruct AcrIIA expression cassettes.\n\t\tNOTE: Use touchdown PCR to amplify four different promoters (i.e., pGPD, pACT1, pTEF2, and genCYC1t_pCYC1noTATA), the three kinds of AcrIIA, and two terminators (ADH1t and CYC1t). Build a series of TUs expressing AcrIIAs, under different promoters, via the Gibson assembly method (refer to step 1.3).\nConstruct AcrVA expression cassettes.",
    "Synthesize the acceptor sequence: ATG-FLAGtag-GS-BamHI-sp-XhoI-NLS-GS-NLS-TAA-Tsynth6, where \"sp\" is a random sequence that will be replaced by AcrVAs later.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In this study, the acceptor sequences were synthesized by a gene synthesis company (Table of Materials).\nAssemble the acceptor vectors pRSII403-promoter-ATG-FLAGtag-GS-BamHI-sp-XhoI-NLS-GS-NLS-TAA-Tsynth6, where the \"promoter\" is: pGAL1, pTEF1, and genCYC1t_pCYC1noTATA. Use the Gibson assembly method (refer to step 1.3).\nInsert each of the three AcrVAs into the acceptor vector described in step 5.2.2.2 (via touchdown PCR and the Gibson assembly method [see step 1.3]) to build a set of plasmids producing AcrVAs.\nFurther engineer AcrIIA4 by extending its sequence with the sequences of the GS linker and HBD(hER). This permits the building of a β-estradiol-responsive circuit.\n\t\nUse touchdown PCR to obtain GS-HBD and AcrIIA4 parts separately (see step 1.3.1).\nPut AcrIIA4, GS-HBD, and the shuttle vector into the Gibson mixture and construct the complete plasmid via the Gibson method (see step 1.3.3).\n6. crRNA detection: RT-qPCR and primers' design\nNOTE: crRNA detection was achieved via RT-qPCR, which is organized in three steps.\nPerform the RNA extraction and purification from yeast cells via an RNA kit.\n\t\nCulture yeast cells overnight in 2 mL of synthetic defined complete medium (SDC, 1 L volume: 20 g of Glucose, 2 g of AA mix, 6.7 g of YNB, 396 mg of Leucine, 79.2 mg of Tryptophan, 79.2 mg of Histidine, and 79.2 mg of Uracil) by using a 24-well plate (240 rpm, 30 °C).\nIn the morning, dilute the cell culture (1:100) into 2 mL of fresh SDC and keep growing the yeast cells at 30 °C, 240 rpm, for another 4 h.\nHarvest the whole 2 mL of the cell solution and centrifuge at 20,238 x g for 2 min. Remove the supernatant carefully since the cell pellet is small.",
    "Extract the RNA from yeast cells using an RNA kit.\nCheck the RNA quality.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 1% agarose gel. Mix 5 µL of each RNA sample with 1 µL of DNA loading dye. Then load the mixture on the gel and run it.\nEnsure that two clear bands at ~4,000 nt and ~2,000 nt, corresponding to ribosomal RNA (25S/18S), are present on the gel. A further blurred band can be seen at ~80 nt for tRNA.\nUse the RNA samples immediately for cDNA synthesis or store them at -80 °C for future use.\nReverse transcription: Use the stem-loop method30 to form the first strand of cDNA corresponding to the crRNA (40 nt). For the reverse transcription of the sgRNA (almost 100 nt), the procedure is the same as that for the cDNA synthesis of the reference gene ACT1.\n\tNOTE: The method for the reverse transcription of the crRNA is different from that used with the sgRNA and the ACT1 mRNA. Since the crRNA is very short, it was treated as a microRNA and used the microRNA reverse transcription method (stem-loop approach) to obtain the corresponding cDNA. Two cDNA synthesis kits (a stem-loop kit for the crRNA and a usual reverse transcription kit for the ACT1 gene) were used in crRNA quantification. The same amount of RNA was used in the two kits (see Table of Materials) to make the experiment results comparable. The primer used with the stem-loop kit was designed according to the stem-loop sequence and the last six nucleotides at the 3' end of the crRNA (for the stem-loop and primer sequence, see Supplementary Table 2).\n\t\nStem-loop method for crRNA reverse transcription\n\t\t\nTake the RNA template, primer, and buffers out of the freezer and let them melt on ice.",
    "Genomic DNA removal: First, prepare 10 µL of the reaction mixture according to the kit instructions. Put the mixture in a thermal cycler at 42 °C for 2 min. Finally, transfer it onto ice.\nSynthesis of the first cDNA strand: Prepare 20 µL of the reaction mixture by adding 10 µL of the mixture from step 6.2.1.2, 1 µL of stem-loop primer (2 µM concentration), 2 µL of 10x RT reaction buffer, 2 µL of reverse transcription enzyme mix (containing the reverse transcriptase), and 5 µL of RNase-free H2O.\nPlace the reaction mixture in a thermal cycler and run the following program: 25 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 15 min, and 85 °C for 5 min. Use the product for the qPCR reaction immediately or store it at -80 °C.\nsgRNA and ACT1 mRNA reverse transcription\n\t\t\nFirst reaction: Prepare a 13 µL mixture consisting of the primer mix, dNTP mix, RNA template (50 pg-5 µg), and RNase-free water (apart from the RNA template, all provided by the kit), according to the kit instructions. Use 1 µg of RNA template. Put the mixture into a thermal cycler at 70 °C for 10 min.\nSecond reaction (cDNA synthesis): Prepare the reaction mixture by adding the reagents (as described in the kit instructions) to the 13 µL of the first reaction solution up to a final volume of 20 µL. Place the mixture in a thermal cycler for 15 min at 50 °C and then for an additional 5 min at 85 °C. Use the product for the qPCR reaction immediately or store it at -80 °C.\nSYBR kit for qPCR: Ct value detection",
    "NOTE: The reverse primer used in the qPCR of the crRNA is fixed because it corresponds to the reverse complement of the stem-loop sequence (see Supplementary Table 2). The forward primer, in contrast, is variable and depends on the sequence of the crRNA. The forward and reverse primers for the sgRNA and ACT1 mRNA qPCR are designed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/. Two primers are selected when the difference between their melting temperatures is no greater than 2 °C (see Supplementary Table 2). Each sample is measured in three replicates.\n\t\nPrepare the qPCR reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions for the SYBR kit.\nSet the following qPCR program in a real-time PCR machine.\n\t\tPreincubation: 10 min at 95 °C.\n\t\tPCR stage: 15 s at 95 °C, followed by 34 s at 55 °C. Set the cycle of the PCR stage to 45 times. Melting stage: 10 s at 95 °C, followed by 60 s at 65 °C, and finally 1 s at 97 °C.\nCalculate the relative mRNA expression values via the Pfaffl formula31.\n7. Immunofluorescence to detect Cas proteins\nNOTE: Cas proteins (CasP) are fused to a His_tag.\nYeast cell preparation\n\t\nPick some yeast cells using a sterile loop and culture them in 5 mL of YPD-rich medium overnight at 240 rpm at 30 °C. In the morning, add 500 µL of the cell solution to 20 mL of fresh YPD and grow them at 240 rpm at 30 °C until OD600 reaches 0.6.\nTake 5 mL of the culture and mix it with 500 µL of 37% formaldehyde. Let the mixture stay at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 5 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 1 mL of fixation buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4, 0.5 M MgCl2, 3.7% formaldehyde, pH = 6.5). Keep the cell solution at RT for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 1,500 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of washing buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4, 1.2 M sorbitol, pH = 6.5) supplemented with 4 µL of beta-mercaptoethanol and 4 µL of lysate solution (5 mg/mL). Put the cell solution into an incubator at 37 °C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 1,500 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Wash the cell pellet twice with 1 mL of PBS by centrifugation (1,500 x g for 5 min).\nResuspend the cells in 100 µL of PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 and add 4 µL of BSA solution (10 mg/mL). Keep the cell solution at RT for 20 min.\nIncubation with primary antibody\n\t\nAdd the Anti-His tag primary antibody to the mixture in step 7.1.6 at a 1:400 dilution. Keep the solution at RT for 2 h.\nCentrifuge the mixture in step 7.2.1 at 1,500 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Add 1 mL of PBST and centrifuge (1,500 x g) for 5 min to wash the cell pellet. Repeat this operation twice. Finally, discard the supernatant and suspend the cells in 100 µL of 1x PBST.\nMicroscopy cell detection\n\t\nMount the cells on a slide; take 2 µL of the cell solution from step 7.2.2 and place it on a glass slide. Cover it with a coverslip.\nObserve the cells under a fluorescence microscope. Turn on the fluorescent light source, microscope, and computer. Write down the fluorescent light source number and open the microscope software on the computer.",
    "Put the slide on the microscope stage. Choose the 40x objective lens and observe the cells under the green light (550 nm). Move the coarse focus knob until the contour of yeast cells appears. Move the fine focus knob to focus the cells.\nDetect the cells with the microscope software. Close the microscope field of view and switch to the computer screen. Click on Live, wait for 3-5 s, and click on Capture to take a picture. Save the picture.\nTurn off the computer, microscope, and fluorescent light source.\n8. Data acquisition: FACS\nNOTE: Green fluorescence is detected via flow cytometry (i.e., fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS] measurements). Yeast cells are cultured, in general, at 30 °C and 240 rpm to run FACS experiments. However, cells might demand some precautions depending on their genetic content. Cells that contain the dCas12a-VPR gene (controlled by the GPD constitutive promoter) must be grown for 24 h in the SDC solution. Afterward, cells are diluted at a ratio of 1:100 in fresh SDC and grown for another 12 h before measuring the fluorescence intensity. Cells modified with the AcrIIA4-HBD(hER) gene demand dilution as well. Moreover, OD600 needs to be controlled. First, the cells are allowed to grow in SDC overnight (over 14 h). In the morning, OD600 is measured. Then the culture is diluted in SDC, supplied with a diverse concentration of β-estradiol, down to OD600 = 0.1. Before FACS experiments, the cells are grown for another 7 h such that OD600 reaches 0.8-1.0. Cells expressing dCas9-VP64 or dCas12a-VP64 are grown in SDC for 20-24 h without dilution and further growth before the measurements at the FACS machine.\nSwitch on the FACS machine 20 min before the measurements to warm up the laser.",
    "Prepare the samples (dilution): mix 20 µL of the cell culture with 300 µL of ddH2O.\nRun the FACS software on the computer connected to the FACS machine and create a new experiment. Set the measurement parameters (i.e., FSC(SSC)-A/H/W and histogram).\nSelect the filter according to the excitation and emission wavelengths of the samples. For example, the target protein here is yEGFP, whose excitation and emission wavelengths are 488 nm and 507 nm, respectively. So, select the FITC or GFP filter (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission wavelength: 527/32 nm). Set the acquisition cell number to 10,000.\nAdjust the FITC filter voltage by measuring the intensity of fluorescent beads. Ensure that the relative difference in the intensity of the beads between two consecutive experiments does not exceed 5%.\nWash the machine with ddH2O for a few seconds to remove any possible excess beads.\nMeasure the sample fluorescence intensity. Click on Preview and wait for 3-5 s for sample injection stability. Finally, click on Acquire.\nMeasure the beads again at the end of the experiment. The voltage is the one that was used during the initial beads' measurement (see step 8.4, 438-441 V). Check whether the relative difference between the two beads' measurements exceeds 5%.\nExport the FACS data as FCS files.\nAnalyze the FCS files with R Studio software.\n9. Data analysis\nNOTE: Use the Flowcore R Bioconductor package32 within R studio. The FCS files were analyzed using a script written in R language.\nOpen R studio and load the script Bdverse analysis.R to analyze the FCS files.\nSet the experiment name (ename), the directory (path) where the FCS files are\n\tStored (dir_d), and where the result files will be created (dir_r).\nSet the fluorescence channel. For instance, select_ch = \"GPA-A\" if green fluorescence was measured.",
    "Set the number of samples that were measured (s_num).\nSet the dimensions of each dot plot (sxlim, sylim). Set the maximal length of the x and y axis for bar plots and box plots (xlimit, ylimit). xlimit must be greater than or equal to s_num.\nChoose the gating method by removing the # from the corresponding lines.\n\tNOTE: morphGate is an automatic gating method carried out by the script (i.e., the region of the dot plots where the cells are denser is recognized and selected by the program). polygonGate and rectangleGate demand to look at the dot plots and define either the vertices of a polygon or the side of a rectangle that embraces the zone where most of the cells lie.\nSelect the flowSet object gated, corresponding to the chosen gating method. Select the dot plot resolution (res; should be at least equal to 256).\nUncomment flt_low <- filter_low(sp) to remove measurements where fluorescence is negative. Uncomment flt_sp <- filter(flt_lw) to remove outliers due to other experiments.\nPress Source and run the script. All the files containing the results from the analysis are created in dir_r.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
