    "**Extraction of total RNA ● TIMING 2-3 h**\n**1**|  Grind  50-100 mg of tissue in a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen and transfer to a 2-ml tube. \n**PAUSE POINT** After grinding, tissue samples can be stored in liquid nitrogen or –80 °C until used for RNA extraction. \n**2**| Extract total RNAs using Plant RNA reagent \\(for plant tissue) or TRIzol \\(for animal tissues) following the manufacture’s instruction. For staring material of 50-100 mg of tissue, follow the small scale option. Dissolve RNA in DEPC-treated water. \n**PAUSE POINT RNA** solution can be stored at –80 °C at least for several months. \n**DNase I treatment \\(Optional) ● TIMING 2-3 h**\n**3**| Remove any possible DNA contamination in total RNA using RNase-free DNase \\(Promega) following the product manual instructions. \n**4**| Purify treated RNAs by extraction using phenol-chloroform and chloroform. \n\\(i) An equal volume of phenol-chloroform is added to RNA sample and mixed thoroughly, and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into a new tube, and extracted again with equal volume of chloroform. \n\\(ii) Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol to supernatant. After thorough mixing, precipitate RNA pellet by keeping the tube at –80 °C for at least 1 hour. \n\\(iii)  The precipitated RNA is collected by centrifugation at maximum speed \\(≥16000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C, then wash RNA pellet using 75% pre-cooled ethanol and briefly air dried. Purified RNA is dissolved in RNase-free water.\n**PAUSE POINT** RNA solution can be stored at –80 °C at least for several months. \n**Evaluation of purified RNA ● TIMING 2-3 hour**\n**5**| Check RNA quality by electrophoresis of RNA through agarose gel containing formaldehyde<sup>15</sup>.",
    "**6**| Measure RNA concentration by using nano-drop or UV-spectrum. Dilute RNA to appropriate concentration \\(such as 100 ng/ul) using DEPC-treated water and kept at -80 °C.\n**PAUSE POINT** RNA solution can be stored at –80 °C for several months. \n**RNA poly\\(A) tailing and reverse transcription ● TIIMEING 1.5 h**\n**7**| Assemble the reaction mixture in a nuclease-free tube on ice: \n\\(i) Components from TaqMan® Reverse Transcription Kit \\(Applied Biosystems): 1 µl 10 x RT buffer, 2.5 µl 25 mM MgCl2, 2 µl 10mM \\(2.5 mM each) dNTPs, 0.2 µl RNase inhibitor and 0.625 µl MultiScribe reverse transcriptase. \n\\(ii) Components from Poly\\(A) Tailing Kit \\(Ambion): 0.25 µl 10 µM ATP  and 0.5 µl E. coli poly\\(A) polymerase \\(E-PAP).\n\\(iii) 200 ng of total RNA, 25 pmol of poly\\(T) adapter \\(Table 1), then add nuclease-free water to a final volume of 10 µL. \n**8**| The reaction mixture is incubated at 37 ºC for 1 hour, and then diluted into 1ng/ µl with water and stored at –20 ºC. \n**PAUSE POINT** The diluted cDNA solution can be stored at –20 ºC for several months.\n**Real-time PCR ● TIMING 3 h**\n**9**| Prepare PCR reaction mixture by adding 1 µl \\(diluted) template cDNA \\(equivalent to 0.1~1 ng total RNA), 5 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, 10 µl 2×SYBR Green PCR Master Mix \\(Roche, Applied Biosystems or other equvilent SYBR Green PCR Master Mix)  and added water to a final volume of 20 µl. \n**10**| PCR protocol using either standard protocol of the Applied Biosystems’ 7900HT system \\(option A) or low stringency protocol \\(option B):",
    "**\\(A)** Standard real time PCR protocol is: 10 min preheating followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C, followed by thermal denaturation to generate dissociation curves for verifying amplification specificity. \n**\\(B)** Low stringency protocol is: 10 min preheating followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30s as low as 55 °C and 1 min at 60 °C, followed by thermal denaturation as above.\n**Evaluation of expression of amiRNA and related genes by real time RT-PCR● TIMING 1 h**\n**11**| Dissociation curve analysis. Peak of product was examined following the protocol in the manual of the ABI 7900HT \\(Fig. 2).\n**12**| Quantitation. In most cases, amplification efficiencies for amiRNA and related transcripts are near to the maximum \\(2). Thus, the quantity of amiRNA relative to a reference gene, can be calculated using the formula 2-<sup>ΔCT</sup>, where ΔCT = \\(CT miRNA – CT reference RNA)16. To compare gene expression, such as the amiRNA target among different samples, gene expression can be calculated using a comparative CT method<sup>17</sup> \\(ΔΔ CT), and the relative gene expression can be quantified by using the formula of 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup>, where ΔΔCT = \\(CT miRNA – CT reference RNA) – \\(CT calibrator – CT reference RNA)<sup>12,17</sup>. The wild type sample was usually selected as reference sample, or named as “calibrator”, and its expression level represents 100% for normalization in each comparison \\(Fig. 3). \n**Analysis of amiRNA RT-PCR products ● TIMING at least 2d **\n**13**| PCR products for amiRNA are purified using a QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit \\(Qiagen) following manufacturer’s manual.  \n**14**| Purified PCR product DNAs are cloned into TA-vectors using a TOPO TA Cloning® Kit \\(Invitrogen) and transformed into competent E.coli cells as described in the product manual.",
    "**15**| Inoculation and culture of a transformed bacterial clone and purification of plasmid DNAs from the bacterial culture is done using a QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit following the product manual.\n**16**| Sequencing of plasmid uses universal primers derived from the cloning vectors, and the sequence of the primer unpaired region of the amiRNA PCR product is compared with designed amiRNA \\( \"Fig. 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/2061/original/Figure-1_Chiang_s.jpg?132811087 )."
