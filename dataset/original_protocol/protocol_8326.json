    "All the experimental procedures presented here have been approved by our Local Ethical Committee following guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Head Registration for Neuronavigated TMS — EEG\nObtain a high resolution whole head T1-weighted structural MRI for each participant. Scan according to the neuronavigation manufacturer guidelines.\nUpload the images on the navigation system. Check if MRIs are correctly scanned. Choose the cardinal points (pre-auricular points, the nasion and the tip of the nose). Insert the stimulation targets (based on anatomy or based on the head coordinates, MNI, or Talairach coordinates).\nPlace the head tracker in such a way so that it will not move during the stimulation session and allow free moving of the TMS coil. Have the participant insert the earplugs before the registration starts.\nAlign the participant's head to the 3-D MRI model. Touch on the participant's head with the digitizing pen at the cardinal points that were selected on the images of the MRI stack. Select and mark additional points over the parietal, temporal and occipital areas of the head to reduce the registration error over those areas.\nValidate the registration. Place the digitizing pen on the participant's head. Check its representation on the computer. If it is not on the corresponding point in the MR, repeat step 1.4.\nCalibrate the TMS coil in use (in some systems this step is not needed).\nAttach the trackers to the coil.\nPlace the coil on the calibration block so all trackers are visible from the camera.\nPress the calibration button on the computer screen and keep the coil in the calibration position for 5 s.\n2. TMS-EEG Experiment\nPlace the EEG cap on the head and prepare the electrodes",
    "Choose a cap that fits the head well. Ensure that all electrodes are tightly touching the scalp and are functional. If more than 2 electrodes do not work, then use another cap of the same or smaller size.\nPlace the Cz electrode at vertex, half way between the line connecting the nasion and inion and the Iz electrode over the inion.\n\t\t​NOTE: Place the vertical (above and under the eye contralateral to the stimulation eye) and/or horizontal electrodes (left from the left eye and right from the right, a little above each zygomatic bone) for electrooculography (EOG).\nAdjust the blunt tip of the syringe and fill it with electroconductive gel. Place the tip inside the hole of the electrode, and then lightly press the plunger flange until there is some paste on the skin. Scrub the scalp lightly using cross-like moves with the blunt tip. Ensure that the paste is not spilling out over the top to avoid bridging (short-circuit between the electrodes).\nPlace the EMG electrodes. Place two disposable disc electrodes (diameter of about 30 mm) over the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) for a belly tendon montage. Place the ground according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nStart the head registration. Follow steps 1.3–1.6. Use the MNI or Talairach coordinates of the DLPFC.\nHot spot and motor threshold.\nAdd a sponge (artificial fiber made from polyutherane) under the coil in order to minimize the coil vibration over the electrodes during the TMS pulses. Note that the foam should be about 10 mm thick.\nInstruct the participant to be at rest — comfortable and with relaxed hands, legs and spinal column.",
    "Find the hot spot. Target the motor knob24 as the initial landmark of cortical representation of APB in M1 and move the coil until there is corresponding APB movement. Use TMS intensities evoking MEPs of around 500 µV over APB. Optimize the coil orientation by changing its angle and tilt to evoke the biggest response over the hot spot.\nSave the coil positioning in the neuronavigator software and reduce the output intensity in steps of 2–3%. Give 10 pulses and if more than 5 out of 10 MEP responses over 50 µV are obtained, then continue reducing the intensity.\nWhen less than 5 out of 10 responses are evoked, increase the intensity by steps of 1–2%. MT is represented as the intensity that produces MEPs larger than 50 µV 5 out of 10 times25. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) for MT should be longer than 1 s, usually set at 3, 4 or 5 s.\nAdjust the intensity using the following steps:\nStart at 120% of MT intensity to produce MEPs over M1 from 500 to 1,500 µV. Record 10 pulses with this stimulator's output so the average response is 1 mV. Increase or decrease the intensity in steps of 1–2% until reaching an average of 1 mV.\nFor stimulation intensity, choose the intensity as a percentage of stimulator's output, e.g., 110%, 120%, etc.\nFind the corresponding induced field in V/m (if the system allows). Place the coil over DLPFC; adjust the stimulator's output until the calculation of the induced field becomes the same as the one over M1 for the same cortical depth.\nDigitize the EEG electrodes, so that their position is registered to the brain anatomy.",
    "NOTE: This is a very important step for locating the distribution of neuronal activation and for accurate repositioning of the electrodes in the follow-up session.\nRecord the TMS-EEG\nReplace the earplugs with the earplugs with air tubes to connect to audio masking (e.g., white noise) if available and add headphones over them. Play the audio masking only during TMS pulse delivery.\n\t\tNOTE: This step can be applied to step 2.4.2 without playing the audio masking and with care so the head trackers are not moved.\nMount the coil on the coil holder and make sure that the coil does not move or press the electrodes under it. Make sure that the sponge is between the electrodes and the coil.\nRemove all active screens out of the sight of the participant. Give instructions to the participant to stare on a fixed point, not to change his/her head position during TMS delivery and not to blink between the TMS pulses.\nSwitch off any fluorescent lights. Run single pulse TMS, SICI, ICF and LICI in a random order for each participant. Give 100 single and paired pulses. Use various ISI's of 3–4 s (±20%) or a constant of 3–5 s (see Note). Give a break of 3–5 min between each condition so the participant can relax and stretch.",
    "NOTE: SICI and ICF involve a paired-pulse TMS paradigm with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) and a suprathreshold test stimulus (TS). The CS used in this protocol is 80% of MT and the TS at the intensity evoking a 1 mV MEP peak-to-peak26. The inter-pulse interval used for optimal SICI is at 2 ms and for ICF at 12–1327. The LICI paradigm involves the pairing of a supra-threshold CS at the intensity evoking the 1 mV MEP peak-to-peak followed by another suprathreshold TS again using the intensity that evoked a 1 mV MEP peak-to-peak and at an inter-pulse interval of 100 ms. The ISI for both single and paired pulse paradigms is determined by the stimulator's charging time (our system can allow paired pulses every 4 s), the amount of sessions (longer experiments would require smaller ISI to not overburden the participants) and the analysis that is going to take place. In this study, we used a constant ISI of 5 s due to our stimulator's restrictions and also because we would need several cycles of low frequency band (theta rhythm) for the time-frequency and power spectrum analysis.\nSubscription Required.
