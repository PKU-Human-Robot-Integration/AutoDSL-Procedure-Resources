    "This protocol was developed as a standard of care. The retrospective use of data gathered during the course of care was approved through a waiver of informed consent by the University of Cincinnati’s Institutional Review Board.\n1. Patient Selection\nIdentify patient with acute brain injury (traumatic brain injury, stroke).\n\tNOTE: Collaborative discussion between surgical and intensive care teams is critical to ensure that there is consensus on which acute brain injury processes warrant monitoring.\n\t\nRule out confounders that may cloud clinical examination including elevated alcohol level or toxic exposures.\nRule out contraindications to neurosurgical procedures, including but not limited to platelets <100 g/dL, international normalized ratio >1.5, recent administration of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants; caution is warranted in those on dual antiplatelets (e.g., both aspirin and clopidogrel).\nPerform Glasgow Coma Scale score. Patients are excluded if they exhibit command following or if they cannot follow commands due to aphasia and have eye opening spontaneously or to voice.\nOnce a patient is considered eligible for advanced neuromonitoring, obtain operative consent after discussion of risks and benefits of the procedure.\nNOTE: Risks include an overall risk of significant hemorrhage 1.9% and a theoretical risk of infection. Benefits include ability to monitor intracranial parameters for targeted therapies, although there is no class I evidence for the use of any intracranial monitoring modality.\n2. Preparation of Site and Skin\nIdentify the correct location for placement of the bolt. This will be 11 cm from the nasion or 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture and 2–3 cm laterally at about the mid-pupillary line.\nClip hair in the region of the scalp through which the bolt will be placed as identified in step 2.1. Then re-identify the correct location once more and mark with a pen or a marker.",
    "Immobilize the head by using tape or other securing strategy to ensure that the head does not move during the burr hole placement.\nSterilize the area using betadine solution, allowing the prepared area to dry fully.\nNOTE: Commercial chlorhexidine solutions may contain indications that they are not for use when in contact with cerebrospinal fluid due to neurotoxicity.\nUsing 10 cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, provide adequate analgesia to the location marked in step 2.2. Begin with the skin, creating a large wheal, then advance the needle to the periosteal surface and inject several cc as the needle is retracted slowly to the surface of the skin.\n3. Preparation of Equipment\nSet up a sterile table with the following equipment.\nPrepare a cranial access kit or comparable set of instruments that include a scalpel blade, hemostat, forceps, gauze, and a hand-held twist drill.\nOpen intracranial monitors onto the sterile field (Table 1 and Table of Materials), including (i) quad lumen bolt kit and locking nuts (up to 4); this kit will also include a 5.3 mm cranial drill bit to be used with the hand-held twist drill (step 3.1.1); (ii) the ICP/PbtO2 probe; (iii) the rCBF probe; (iv) the depth electrode with stylet; (v) optionally (not shown), 70 microdialysis bolt catheter or other intracranial probe.\nThread each probe through a locking nut and subsequent insert through one of the lumens of the bolt. The ICP/PbtO2 probe, the thickest probe, is placed preferentially in the tallest lumen, whereas the other probes can fit through any remaining lumens.\nMeasure the distance from the end of the bolt to the tip of each probe at 2.5–3 cm. Advance the depth electrode until the most proximal electrode is just outside the end of the bolt.",
    "Once the probe is placed the appropriate distance from the end of the bolt, tighten the locking nut on the lumen of the bolt and then the probe itself, locking in place on the probe.\nOnce the locking nut is tight, loosen the nut from the lumen and remove each probe with its locking nut in place. Place on the sterile table next to the bolt.\n4. Drilling a Burr Hole\nUse scalpel to create a 1–2 cm incision in the anesthetized region (step 2.5). Use blunt tip instrument to separate subgaleal tissues, exposing periosteum.\nInsert and use hex bit to tighten 5.3 mm drill bit to the cranial drill.\nPlace the cranial drill perpendicular to the skull. Use continuous pressure while rotating the drill. Continue to drill until there is a tactile change in pressure. Once it becomes harder to drill, the inner table of the skull has been reached. Continue drilling with counter upward support to avoid plunging the drill into the cortex.\nRemove the drill and clear the burr hole of any bone chips or debris using a curet or hemostat.\nUse a scalpel blade to incise the dura in a cruciate fashion. Confirm that the dura is completely open.\nNOTE: Some practitioners may use alternative approaches, such as using an 18 G needle to perforate the dura using tactile feedback until the dura is sufficiently opened. Adequate durotomy is critical regardless of the technique, and incomplete durotomy may lead to difficulty passing thin, flexible catheters or malpositioning of the catheters.\n5. Inserting the Cranial Bolt\nHolding the bolt by the plastic wings, thread through the burr hole using a firm, clockwise twisting motion. Be careful not to overtighten, which can compress the adjacent skin and soft tissues.",
    "NOTE: Cerebrospinal fluid may rise from the lumens of the bolt, particularly if there is increased intracranial pressure.\nInsert each pre-measured probe until the locking nut meets the lumen.\nThe dura may provide resistance, particularly to thinner probes. Insert the thinnest probe first, which may help avoid pass resistance.\nInsert the depth electrode with the stylet in place. Once placed and tightened on the lumen, gently loosen the locking nut from the probe just enough to remove the stylet, then re-tighten.\nNOTE: Once all probes are locked onto the lumens through which they pass, the sterile part of the procedure is complete.\n6. Securing the Probes\nHave available personnel connect the ICP/PbtO2 probe to the bedside monitor to assess the intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen.\nUsing silk or other durable tape, gently loop each probe and tape it to its lumen. This creates strain resistance. Use caution not to create a “kink” in the probes, as they have thin components that can break.\nOptionally, use a large 6” x 2” tegaderm or a thin strip of occlusive petrolatum gauze to wrap the base of the bolt, reducing the exposure of the skin-to-burr-hole interface. The occlusive petrolatum gauze also provides bacteriostatic function.\nPrior to transport, use a woven gauze to wrap the entire bolt, encompassing each of the unplugged probes within the roll, and tape the end with silk tape. This ensures that the loose ends of unplugged probes are not accidentally pulled during movement to and from operative or radiological beds.\n7. Verifying Probe Data",
    "Once an initial ICP is recorded, if it is clinically appropriate, order a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) to verify the position of the bolt and the probes, which should sit within the frontal subcortical white matter. This will also expose any adverse events such as subdural or intraparenchymal hemorrhage that rarely occur during placement.\nAfter verifying the position of the probes, plug all probes into local data recording system (equipment will vary). Perform some simple data verification steps that can be used for each modality to ensure the signal is recording as planned:\nFor intracranial pressure, verify that a pulsatile waveform is present. The ICP data measured by the ICP/PbtO2 probe generates a waveform visible on the local recording system.\nFor brain tissue oxygen, first examine the temperature of the brain and verify that the temperature is similar to what would be expected for core body temperature measured at another site (bladder, esophageal). Second, verify the responsiveness of the monitor by transiently increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of the patient to 1.0 (100%).\nNOTE: Within 15 min, the PbtO2 should increase by at least 10 mmHg. If not, the diffusion of dissolved oxygen is being impeded either by a small hematoma (check CT scan from step 7.1) or local microtrauma induced by placement of the probe itself. Consider loosening the locking nut slightly and turning the probe clockwise 90° and re-tightening the locking nut in case there is a small amount of clotted blood accumulated on the oxygen entry surface of the probe.\nFor cerebral blood flow, first wait for the initial measurement, which may take up to 6 min for the probe to establish a stable thermal field.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the blood flow probe temperature is within 0.7 °C of the brain tissue temperature.",
    "NOTE: If lower, the blood flow probe is likely too shallow and will need to be advanced.\nEnsure that the probe placement assistant (PPA) number, which is simultaneously generated with blood flow probe temperature in 7.2.3.1, reads <2.\nNOTE: This measurement is performed by a mechanical probe which senses displacement of the probe related to pulsatility, and values range from 0.0 (stable thermal field) to 10.0 (nearby pulsatile blood vessel render the thermal field too unstable to generate rCBF). If the PPA is >2, consider pulling the probe back by 0.25–0.5 cm.\nFor depth electroencephalography (EEG), visually inspect the signal.\nNOTE: The depth electrodes require a ground electrode and reference electrode. A local electrodiagnostic technologist will be able to assist in placing these electrodes. Correctly recorded EEG should demonstrate a mixture of frequencies at a 15 µV/mm scale with a dynamic range ± 200–400 µV at a high-pass filter of 0.5 Hz and a low-pass filter of 50 Hz. If this is not seen, it may be worth verifying the placement of the reference or the ground.\n8. Patient Care\nNOTE: Following the procedure, no further pain control is necessary and no prophylactic antibiotics are required.\nAt the end of the clinical monitoring period, remove the bolt by first removing each of the probes individually. Then, twist the bolt counterclockwise until it comes loose from the skull and can be removed.\nUse sterile technique to suture the skin opening and monitor for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, bleeding, or swelling at the site.\nSubscription Required.
