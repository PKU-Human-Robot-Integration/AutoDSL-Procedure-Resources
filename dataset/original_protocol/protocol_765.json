  "procedures": [
    "**1. Single cell preparation**:\n1) Isolate single cells \\(multiple single cell isolation methods are available, for example, the CellRaft system, which was used here) and deposit into 0.2-ml PCR tubes containing 2.5 µl PBS. \n2) Immediately place the tubes on dry ice and store at -80°C.\n**2. Whole genome amplification**:\nCarry out the following Step 1) to 4) in a PCR workstation.\n1) Add 1 µl exo-resistant random primers and 3 µl lysis buffer containing 400 mM KOH, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA solution, into the PCR tube containing a single cell.\n2) Flick the mixture several times, spin down quickly and keep it on ice for 10 min.\n3) Add 3 µl stop buffer containing 400 mM HCl and 600 mM Tris-HCl solution \\(1 M, pH7.5) to neutralize the lysis buffer. Keep it on ice for 2 min. \n4) Add 32 µl of master mix containing 30 µl MDA reaction buffer and 2 µl Phi29 polymerase. Mix by pipetting gently.\n5) Incubate at 30°C for 1.5 hr and 65°C for 3 min.\n**3. Amplified product purification**:\n1) Purify amplified product with 75.6 µl AMPureXP-beads and mix it by pipetting.\n2) Leave the mixture at room temperature for 5 min and put it on a magnetic separator until the solution is clear. \n3) Remove the clear liquid by pipetting and wash beads twice with fresh 80% ethanol. \n4) Open lid of the tube to air-dry beads for about 5 min. \\(Avoid beads cracking)\n5) Take out the tube from magnetic separator and elute beads using 32 µl nuclease-free water. \n6) Put back the tube to magnetic separator and keep it at room temperature for 5 min until the solution is clear and a pellet is formed again.",
    "7) Transfer 30 µl clear liquid from the tube to a clean tube.\n8) Store the purified product at 4°C for short-term storage or -20°C for long-term storage.\n**4. Concentration and size measurement**:\n1) Dilute the purified product 10-20 times and quantify the samples using Qubit. Usually, the yield of the purified product is 10-12 µg. \n2) Check the product size by agarose gel electrophoresis. The following conditions are recommended: 1.0% agarose gel; 1.0% TBE solution; 100V for 40 min. A bright band \\(with a little smear) over 10 kb in a gel picture is desirable. \n**5. Estimation of amplification uniformity**: \n1) Dilute the purified product and unamplified genomic DNA as a control to 1 ng/µl using nuclease-free water.\n2) Prepare 96-well plate and the PCR mixture for each well including 5 µl Fast Sybr green master mix, 1 µl locus-specific primers, 2 µl nuclease-free water and 2 µl diluted DNA.\n3) Seal the plate and spin down.\n4) Incubate under the following qPCR program: 95°C for 20s, thermocycling \\(40 cycles) at 95°C for 3 s, and 60°C for 30 s.\n5) Calculate the relative uniformity values \\(RUVs) for 8 loci \\(equation \\(1) in Supplementary Notes, Dong et al., Nature Methods in press).\n6) Select the samples with RUV values for at least 6 of the 8 loci of between 0.25-4 for library construction."
