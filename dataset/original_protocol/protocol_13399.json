    "hASCs were isolated from the abdominal adipose tissue of a healthy woman who underwent breast reconstruction using abdominal autologous flaps (deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps, [DIEP]) at the University Hospital of Lausanne, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland. The discarded part of the flap and the adipose tissue was obtained after the patient signed informed consent. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the hospital's Biobank Department DAL (number 314 GGC) and ethics committees in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nNOTE: All steps must be performed under a laminar flow hood and with aseptic conditions. Gloves and lab coats for personal protection should always be worn, and all surfaces should be washed with appropriate biocides. Excess tissue should be disposed of properly as biomedical waste.\n1. Materials needed and preparation of the culture solutions\nFor cell isolation, expansion, and cryopreservation, obtain the following instruments: sterile scissors; sterile scalpels; sterile tweezers; a 10 cm Petri dish; 15 mL tubes; T25 flasks; a Burker chamber; cryovials; a cell freezing container; an optical microscope with 4x and 10x magnification objectives; and a swinging bucket centrifuge.\nFor immunophenotyping, obtain the following instruments and reagents: FACS tubes, sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM); hPL; dimethyl sulfide; and animal-free trypsin.\nPrepare the complete culture medium by supplementing DMEM with 5% heparin-free hPL. Store the medium at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks, and always use warm (between room temperature and 37 °C). Following GMP guidelines for the production of cell medicines intended for human therapy, do not add any antibiotics to the culture medium.\nPrepare freezing medium containing 20% hPL and 10% dimethyl sulfide in DMEM.\n2. Isolation of hASCs from the adipose tissue sample",
    "Process the adipose tissue sample within 6 h of obtaining it. Before proceeding to the established mechanical xenogeneic-free isolation method, wash the tissue 2x with PBS for 10 min until connective tissue and blood are released.\nStore the obtained adipose tissue sample from abdominoplastic surgery in PBS at 4° C until processing and, in any case, no longer than 24 h, in order to not damage the hASC viability.\nCut the adipose tissue into smaller pieces of approximately 1 cm2 with sterile scissors.\nWith a scalpel, micro-dissect each piece into little fragments with diameters <5 mm, and disperse five of them in a 10 cm Petri dish (Figure 2A).\nIn order to attach each fragment, use the scalpel to create incisions on the plastic surface, dragging each fragment until it is firmly stuck to the Petri dish. Use tweezers to help handle the fragment (Figure 2B).\nGently add 10 mL of complete culture medium in order to cover all the fragments without detaching them.\nIncubate the Petri dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The hASCs will migrate out of the tissue and be selected due to their plastic adherence without enzymatic digestion.\nUntil cell confluence, monitor the hASC expansion under an optical microscope at 4x magnification once per day. As the hASCs begin to exit from the tissue, they appear as small clusters around the tissue pieces with a typical fibroblast-like morphology. The hASCs are selected due to their ability to adhere to the plastic surface. Every 72 h, remove as much medium as possible, and replace it with fresh complete medium in order to remove cell debris.\nLeave the fragments of tissue in place until the first passage of cells, which is usually after 7 days.\n3. hASC culture after the isolation phase",
    "When the hASC culture reaches 70%-80% confluency, the hASCs are ready to be detached and further expanded to be either used for other experiments or long-term storage.\nWith sterile tweezers, remove and discard all the pieces of tissue from the Petri dish. Remove and discard the exhausted medium, being careful not to touch the hASCs in order not to detach them.\nCarefully wash the cells once with 10 mL of PBS. Add 1 mL of 1x animal-free trypsin, and leave the Petri dish in the incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.\nCheck under an optical microscope at 4x magnification if all the cells have detached; otherwise, leave the Petri dish for an additional 2 min in the incubator, and eventually gently tap the plastic surface to support cell detachment.\nStop the trypsin action by adding 2 mL of complete medium, and collect all the cells in a 15 mL tube.\nIn order to remove any remaining trypsin, centrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, suspend the cells with 5 mL of complete medium, and transfer the cell suspension into a new T25 flask. Keep the hASCs in culture, and expand them until needed.\n4. Immunophenotype investigation by flow cytometry\nWhen the hASC culture reaches 70%-80% confluency, detach the hASCs as previously described in section 3.\nAfter collecting the cells, suspend them in 1 mL of complete medium, and count an aliquot with the cell counter under an optical microscope at 10x magnification.\nCentrifuge the hASCs at 300 x g for 5 min, and suspend them at 1 x 106 cells/mL of FACS buffer. Transfer 100 µL of the suspension containing 1 x 105 cells into one FACS tube. Use one FACS tube for each investigated antigen, plus one more for each isotypic control.",
    "Stain the cells with 100 µL of the following antibodies diluted in FACS buffer: anti-CD73 (1:1,000, IgG1, FITC-labeled), anti-CD105 (1:200, IgG1, PE-labeled); anti-CD34 (1:66, IgG1, FITC-labeled); anti-CD45 (1:66, IgG1, FITC-labeled); and isotypic controls for each fluorophore, IgG1 FITC-labeled (1:1,000) and IgG1 PE-labeled (1:50).\nIncubate the samples for 1 h in the dark with agitation at 4 °C. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and suspend the cells in 500 µL of FACS buffer.\nAssess the cell immunophenotype with a flow cytometry instrument, recording 50,000 events for each tube inside the gate selected to exclude cell debris. Calculate the percentage of expressing cells as the difference from the specific isotypic control.\n5. Proliferation assay of hASC\nWhen the hASC culture reaches 70%-80% confluency, detach the hASCs as described in section 3.\nAfter collecting the cells, suspend them in 1 mL of complete medium, and count an aliquot with the cell counter under an optical microscope at 10x magnification.\nSeed 5 x 102 hASCs in 200 µL of complete medium in 96-well transparent plates. Seed the cells in technical replicates, with one well for each time point.\nAt 3 days after seeding, start detecting the cell proliferation using a proliferation assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, replace the culture medium with 100 µL of fresh medium added to 20 µL of assay reagent per well. Incubate the hASCs for 2.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for reagent development, and then detect absorbance at 490 nm with a spectrophotometer.\nExpress the hASC proliferation as the percentage absorbance after removing the blank absorbance.\n6. Cryopreservation and storage of the hASCs\nDetach the cells as described in section 3, and count an aliquot with the cell counter under an optical microscope at 10x magnification.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant. Suspend the cells with freezing mix at a density of 1 x 106 hASCs/mL, and transfer 1 mL of the cell solution into one cryovial.\nPut the cryovials at −80 °C in a freezing container that decreases the temperature by 1 °C/min, and then move the cryovials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nSubscription Required.
