    "1. Preparation of Polymeric Aqueous Two Phase System (ATPS)\nWeigh 0.5 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (MW: 35,000) and add it to 9.5 ml of complete growth medium in a sterile 15 ml conical to prepare 10 ml of 5% (w/v) aqueous PEG phase.\n\tNote: Adding half of the medium to the conical first followed by adding the polymer and then the remaining amount of medium minimizes adhesion of the polymer to the conical walls and helps the polymer dissolve faster.\nWeigh 0.128 g of dextran (DEX) (MW: 500,000) and add it to 0.872 ml of complete growth medium in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to prepare 1 ml of 12.8% (w/v) aqueous DEX phase.\nVortex both solutions for about 1 min to dissolve the polymers in the medium.\nKeep both solutions in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 hr to ensure dissolution and homogenous mixtures. Keep the caps above the water level to avoid the possibility of contamination of solutions from the bath water.\nLoad the PEG phase solution into a sterile, plastic syringe and pass it through a syringe filter of 0.2 µm pore size to remove impurities.\n\tNote: Fill the syringe with the PEG solution, place it in the insert of the filter on top of a conical tube and using force, slowly push the solution through the filter. It is normal to experience resistance against movement of the syringe plunger. Minor loss of the polymer solution occurs as some of the solution will remain in the filter, but the polymer concentration will not change.",
    "Pipette 10 µl of the DEX phase solution and dilute it in 10 µl of medium in a separate tube to result in 6.4% (w/v) DEX phase solution. Aspirate 100 µl of the PEG phase solution and dispense it into a Petri dish.\n\t\nDispense 0.5 µl of the 6.4% (w/v) DEX phase solution into the PEG phase solution. Visually confirm successful ATPS formation by observing a DEX drop under a microscope. The drop boundary should remain visible, indicating presence of two stable, separate aqueous phases.\nStore the stock aqueous PEG and DEX phase solutions in 4 °C until use.\n\tNote: It is recommended that polymer solutions are prepared fresh prior to each experiment and used within 24 hr of storage.\n2. Preparation for Printing of Cancer Cell Spheroids\nGrow cancer cells of interest (e.g., MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cells) to a 90%-100% confluent monolayer. For MDA-MB-157 cells, use a medium composed of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 1% antibiotic.\n\t\nHarvest cells using a cell dissociation buffer (according to manufacturer’s protocol) and load the suspension into a 15 ml conical. Centrifuge it for 5 min at 173.3 x g, remove supernatant, and resuspend cells in 1 ml of complete growth medium.\nLoad cells onto a hemocytometer and count them to calculate the required number of cells for a desired spheroid cell density. A confluent monolayer of MDA-MB-157 cells grown in a T75 flask usually gives ~7 x 106 cells.\n\tNote: Required cell density for a drop volume to generate a single spheroid will depend on the cell type.22 For example, a density of 1.5 x 104 or larger for MDA-MB-157 cells is recommended per 0.3 µl DEX phase drop to ensure formation of a single spheroid.",
    "Centrifuge cells for a second time for 5 min at 173.3 x g and resuspend them in an appropriate volume of growth medium to concentrate the suspension to a desired cell density.\n\tNote: For example if 7 x 106 cancer cells were harvested, the total volume of cell suspension required to form a spheroid of 1.5 x 104 cell density in a 0.3 µl DEX phase drop will be 140 µl. However due to dilution with the DEX phase solution in the next step, only use 70 µl of cell culture medium to resuspend cells.\nAdd to the resulting cell suspension an equal volume of the 12.8% (w/v) aqueous DEX phase solution prepared in 1.2. For the example of 1.5 x 104 cell density spheroid, 70 µl of the DEX phase solution is added to 70 µl of cell suspension.\nThoroughly mix the cell suspension to ensure uniform distribution of cells and mixing of DEX solution. Pipetting up and down should be done gently to prevent bubble formation.\n3. Preparation for Printing of Co-cultured Spheroids\nGrow cancer cells (e.g., MDA-MB-157 human breast cancer cells) and support cells (e.g., human fibroblasts) to a 90%-100% confluent monolayer. Harvest each cell type using a cell dissociation buffer (according to manufacturer’s protocol).\n\t\nLoad each suspension into a 15 ml conical, centrifuge them for 5 min at 173.3 x g, and aspirate supernatant from each conical. Resuspend cells of each conical in 1 ml of complete growth medium.\n\t\tNote: Fluorescent dyes such as Calcein AM (live cell stain) and nuclear dyes (Hoechst) can be used to distinguish the two cell types.",
    "Load each cell type separately onto a hemocytometer and count them to calculate the required number of each cell type for a desired ratio of cancer cells to supporting cells in co-cultured spheroids. Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB-157 cells and fibroblasts grown in T75 flasks usually give ~7 x 106 and ~6 x 106 cells, respectively.\nAdd the correct volume from the suspension of supporting cells to cancer cells suspension to give a desired ratio of the number of two cell types. For example, use a ratio of 50 cancer cells to 1 fibroblast cell.\nCentrifuge the conical containing the mixed cell suspension for 5 min at 173.3 x g and resuspend cells in an appropriate volume to result in final density comprising of equal volumes of growth medium and the 12.8% (w/v) aqueous DEX phase solution (prepared in 1.2).\nGently pipette the resulting cell suspension up and down to ensure homogeneity of the suspension.\n4. Printing of Tumor Spheroids into a 96-well Plate\nOne day prior to experiments, coat non-treated, round-bottom 96-well plates with 1% (w/v) Pluronic at 37 °C for 24 hr. This coating prevents cell attachment over the culture period.\nDispense 50 µl of the filtered 5% (w/v) aqueous PEG phase into each well of a 96-well plate (destination plate).\nUsing a pipette, mix the cell suspension (prepared in step 2 or step 3 for mono- and co-culture, respectively) and add 20 µl of the suspension to every other well from one column of a 384-well plate (source plate).\nTurn on the liquid handler and “home” the pipetting head to register coordinates. Then compile a previously defined protocol (below in 4.6) to ensure labware and parameters are defined correctly. This “homing” step may be different for different liquid handlers.",
    "Note: The flow of the protocol, shown step-by-step below in 4.6, will be similar regardless of the robotic liquid handler used; however, the programming interface may look different due to the use of different software.\nPlace the source plate, the destination plate, and pipette tip boxes at defined positions on the workstation of the liquid handler as shown in Figure 1.\nExecute the protocol that includes the following steps:\n\t\nLoad one column of barrels from the pipetting head of the liquid handler with mixing pipette tips (8 tips) from the workstation (Figure 1).\nMix the cell suspension in wells of the source plate (Figure 1). Select a mixing volume smaller than the cell suspension volume in wells to avoid bubble formation.\nEject tips into an empty waste tips box (Figure 1).\nLoad one column of barrels from the pipetting head with 10 µl dispensing pipette tips (Figure 1).\nAspirate 0.3 µl of the cell suspension from the source plate (Figure 1) into each pipette tip.\nDispense the cell suspension into wells of one column of the destination plate (Figure 1). Use a dispense height of 0.5 mm and a dispense flow rate of smaller than 1 µl/sec.\nRepeat steps 4.6.1 through 4.6.6 until the column-by-column printing into the entire destination plate is complete.\nCarefully remove the destination plate from the workstation surface and place it in a humid incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Maintain the plate horizontal when carrying it into the incubator to avoid disrupting of DEX phase drops containing cells.\nIncubate the plate for 24 hr to allow aggregation of cells into a spheroid within the DEX phase drop.\n5. Drug Treatment of Cancer Cell Spheroids",
    "Note that the following protocol is for a 4-day drug treatment and includes a renewal with fresh drug after day 2. It can be modified for other treatment periods.\nVisually confirm spheroid formation in 96-well plates after 24 hr. If needed, image wells for measurement of size of spheroids by averaging the smallest and largest diameters of each spheroid.\nPrepare the stock solution of a desired drug by dissolving it in a solvent recommended by the manufacturer at a predetermined solubility concentration. For example, dissolve cisplatin in water at 2 mg/ml.\n\tNote: Protect the stock solution of the drug from light if the drug is light-sensitive.\nUsing the serial dilution technique, prepare diluted drug concentrations with cell culture medium from the stock solution prepared in the previous step. Each dilution should be made twice the desired concentration. Dilution ratios will vary depending on the starting stock concentration and desired working concentrations.\nAdd 50 µl of drug solution prepared in the previous step to each well. This can be done robotically or by manual pipetting.\n\tNote: Each drug concentration will be diluted in half to the desired concentration by the 50 µl aqueous PEG phase already in each well.\n\t\nUse spheroids from two columns of a 96-well plate (n=16) for each concentration.\nIn control wells, add only 50 µl of fresh culture medium to the existing 50 µl of the aqueous PEG phase.\nIncubate spheroids with the drug for 48 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2, protected from light.\nAfter 48 hr of incubation, prepare fresh dilutions of the drug at desired concentrations and renew drug by adding 50 µl of fresh drug solution to each well.",
    "Note: The wells already contain the desired drug concentration from the first drug treatment. Therefore in this renewal phase, each concentration is prepared at the desired concentration since no dilution will occur.\nIncubate spheroids with the drug for another 48 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2, protected from light.\n6. Analysis of Cellular Viability in Spheroids\nAfter 48 hr of incubation with renewed drug (i.e., total time of treatment of spheroids with a drug is 4 days), measure the total volume of medium in one well by manual pipetting.\n\tNote: Typical volume in one well is ~140 µl (a small decrease occurs due to evaporation).\nCalculate the volume of cell viability reagent (e.g., PrestoBlue) as 10% concentration of the total well volume. Add this volume of cell viability reagent to each well.\n\tNote: With an existing media volume of 140 µl in a well, a volume of 15.6 µl is required to give a 10% concentration of the total well. This is calculated by dividing the existing media volume by 9 (140 µl / 9 = 15.6 µl).\nIncubate the plate with the cell viability reagent added to each well for 6 hr at 37 °C, protected from light.\nPlace the plate in a micro-plate reader and read the fluorescence signal at 560 nm and 590 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively.\nCalculate the percent viability of cells in spheroids by normalizing the fluorescent signal from treated wells to that of control wells after averaging the values from the same treatment conditions.\nSubscription Required.
