    "1. Cell Preparation\nDay 1\nWarm cell culture media (DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, and Pen Strep) in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min.\nPrepare the tissue culture hood by spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping down the surfaces with paper towels.\nSpray and wipe tissue culture flasks and media, PBS, and trypsin bottles with 70% ethanol and bring them into the tissue culture hood.\nAspirate the media from the cell culture flask and wash the cells with 12 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAspirate the PBS and add 1 mL of trypsin to the cells. Incubate at RT for 10-20 min, until the cells detach.\nAdd 11 mL of cell culture media to the trypsin and mix by pipetting up and down 3-5 times.\nInvert a 24-well cell culture dish containing 5 μm pore inserts and gently pipette 100 μL of the cell suspension to the underside of the insert (Figure 1).\nPlace the inverted plate in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n\tDay 2\nWarm cell culture media in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min.\nPrepare the tissue culture hood by spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping down the surfaces with paper towels.\nSpray and wipe tissue culture flasks and media, PBS, and trypsin bottles with 70% ethanol and bring them into the tissue culture hood.\nRight the tissue culture plate and gently add 1 mL of media to the basal compartment and 180 μL to the apical compartment.\nPlace the plate in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n\tDay 3-7:\nMonitor the transepithelial resistance (TER) daily, using a epithelial volt/Ohm meter, until the TER have stabilized and the cells have formed a confluent monolayer.\n2. PMN Isolation",
    "Room temperature gradient solutions, 50 mM K2EDTA, and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium/magnesium (HBSS-) to room temperature.\nPrepare double density gradients in 50 mL conical tubes.\nCoat a 60 mL syringe with 6 mL of 50 mM K2EDTA and collect 54 mL of blood from donor.\nOverlay 15 mL of blood to the double density gradients prepared above.\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 30 min at room temperature, with the brake off.\nAspirate the serum, peripheral blood monocyte, interphases and transfer the layer containing PMN to a new 50 mL conical tube and resuspend to 50 mL in HBSS-.\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 40 mL of cold red blood cell lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge at 700 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and combine the pellets from all tubes into 3 mL of HBSS-.\nDetermine the concentration of PMN and dilute to 5x104 using the appropriate about of HBSS-.\n3. In Vitro pH Monitoring Assay\nWarm HBSS with calcium/magnesium (HBSS+) in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min.\nPrepare the tissue culture hood by spraying it with 70% ethanol and wiping down the surfaces with paper towels.\nSpray and wipe HBSS+ with 70% ethanol and bring them into the tissue culture hood.\nh before the assay is performed, equilibrate the pH sensing plates by adding 1 mL of HBSS+ to each well and placing in a 37 °C incubator.\nmin before the assay remove the pH sensing plates from the incubator and add 1 μM fMLP to each well.\nPlace the pH sensing plate on the SDS reader at 37 °C and record the pH to establish a baseline for the experiment.",
    "Once the pH reading has stabilized remove media from inserts and add 180 μL HBSS+ to the top well.\nAdd 20 μL HBSS+ to control wells or 20 μL PMN.\nRemove the HBSS+ and transfer the inserts to the pH sensing plate.\nTo the bottom well, add 1 mL of HBSS+ with and without 1 μM fMLP.\nTo the top well, add 180 μL ofHBSS+.\nTo the top well, add 20 μl of HBSS- containing 0 or 1 x 106 PMN.\nPlace the pH sensing plate on the SDS reader at 37 °C (Figure 2).\nOn the attached computer, open the pH monitoring software and set up the software to record the pH at designated time intervals (every 1-10 min).\nSubscription Required.
