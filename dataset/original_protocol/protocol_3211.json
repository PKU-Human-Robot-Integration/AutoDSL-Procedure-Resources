    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest cells\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes how to prepare samples to extract cell nuclei.\n        Trypsinize adherent cells and harvest in PBS (50-mL centrifuge\n        tube/condition). No trypsin is needed for cells in suspension.\n      \nCount cells.\n        Centrifuge (5 min at 0.1 RCF, 4°C) and resuspend cells in PBS\n        (1 × 106 cells/mL). Keep your samples on ice.\n      \n        Centrifuge (5 min at 0.1 RCF, 4°C), remove all the supernatant and keep\n        samples on ice.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2980-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Sample preparation for extraction\n            \n              Each condition and staining tube contain 2 × 106 cells.\n              Total number of cells per condition is 4 × 106.\n              12 × 106 cells (untreated or mock treated) are split in\n              6 control tubes. Image created with\n              BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\n            \nCritical: Each tube should contain the\n      same number of cells in order to ensure similar extraction for all\n      conditions.\n    \nNote: In this particular example, 2 double\n      stainings of 4 conditions multiplexed in a barcoded sample will require 6\n      single control colors. Total number of tubes: 14 (2 stainings x 4\n      conditions = 8, plus 6 single stainings as control samples. See\n      Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\n    \nNote: Cell confluency is very important.\n      Asynchronous cell cycle analyses require no more than 70% confluency.\n      Fully confluent plates will probably enrich the cell cycle profile in G1\n      phase.\n    \nNuclear extraction\nTiming: 1.5 h\n      This step explains how to treat cells in order to remove the soluble\n      components and leave chromatin-associated proteins.\n    \n        Add 1 mL of extraction buffer to each 2 × 106 cell pellet.\n        Pipet up and down to resuspend cells without making bubbles. See\n        Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2980-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nuclear extraction\n              Each centrifuge tube containing 2 × 106 cells is\n              treated with 1 mL extraction buffer for 5 min in order to extract\n              soluble nuclear components. Image created with\n              BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].",
    "Place samples back on ice for 5 min.\n        Add 27 μL of 37% formaldehyde solution to the cell suspension (1% final\n        concentration) and incubate for 1 h on ice.\n      \nFill the tube with PBS-1% FBS to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge (5 min at 0.2 RCF, 4°C) and pour off the supernatant.\n        Resuspend the extracted nuclei in the remaining PBS-1% FBS. See\n        troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nTransfer nuclei into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube.\n        Centrifuge (5 min at 0.8 RCF, 25°C) and strictly remove all supernatant\n        using a micropipettor.\n      \nCritical: Extraction has to be\n      strictly timed (5 min incubation with extraction buffer). If you have more\n      than 4 tubes (equal to one final barcoded sample), perform several rounds\n      of extraction with no more than 4 tubes per round.\n    \nCritical: One must be very careful in\n      order not to lose nuclei when transferring them from falcon to eppendorf\n      tubes (steps 10–12).\n    \nCritical: The proportion of 1 mL of\n      extraction buffer for 2 × 106 cells is very important.\n      Otherwise, extraction may fail.\n    \nNote: For control samples (single\n      staining) skip steps 13–19.\n    \nNote: Extraction buffer is prepared fresh\n      for each experiment and it must be stored on ice.\n    \nOptional: Steps 5–7 are required to\n      analyze chromatin-associated proteins. To analyze total protein content,\n      skip steps 5–7 and instead fix each 2 × 106 cell pellet with\n      1 mL cold EtOH-70% dropwise. Incubate for 2 h at -20°C and continue to\n      step 8. In case of proteins tightly bound to chromatin, a more\n      stringent extraction can be performed. After step 6 and before fixation,\n      add 20 μL of 5 M NaCl to each tube. This will increase NaCl concentration\n      in 100 mM. Incubate for 5 more minutes on ice and proceed to step 7.\n    \nBarcode the samples\nTiming: 45 min",
    "This step will dye the nuclei/cells from each condition with a different\n      concentration of Pacific Blue in order to multiplex the different\n      conditions of your experiment in one single tube.\n    \nResuspend the fixed pellets in 195 μL PBS (FBS free).\n        Transfer exactly 5 μL of the corresponding dye solution (L1, L2, L3, L4;\n        see working solutions-Pacific Blue) into each tube (condition)\n        and mix by pipetting up and down. See\n        troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nIncubate samples in the dark for 30 min at 25°C (RT).\nFill eppendorf tubes with PBS-1% FBS.\n        Centrifuge (5 min at 0.8 RCF, 25°C) and remove supernatant leaving\n        around 200 μL.\n      \n        Resuspend nuclei/cells in the remaining supernatant and mix samples in\n        one final barcoded tube (L1+L2+L3+L4). From the initial 8 15-mL tubes,\n        you will end up with only 2 eppendorf tubes: one barcoded sample for\n        each staining to be performed in this particular example.

    "Represent DNA content-A (ToPro3-A) vs. your antibody of interest-H\n        (Cy3/AF488-H) and adjust voltages on a linear scale.\n      \n        Record at least 10,000 events for each condition in barcoded samples.\n      \n        Acquire and record 20,000–30,000 events for control samples in order to\n        compensate fluorescence spillover. See step 44 in\n        data analyses[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6].\nExport the Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data files.\nNote: Voltages for FSC and SCC will depend\n      on the cell line and cell treatment.\n    \nNote: Although the fluorophore of\n      secondary antibodies defines the laser to be used, cytometer detector\n      voltages can be different depending on the primary antibody. In this\n      particular example, both Cy3 anti-rb and\n      AF488 anti-ms control samples have been recorded 2 times, each one\n      with the corresponding voltage of its primary antibody (MCM3 and STAG1 _\n      Cy3 / RAD21 and STAG2 _ AF488). That makes 8 compensation samples (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n    \nNote: Transient transfection of a POI\n      before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] (e.g., GFP-POI excited by\n      B_525/20 laser) will require extra-gating. After step 33, gate positive\n      cells from SSC-A vs B_525/20-H in order to make sure that 10,000\n      events are recorded for the population of interest.\n    \nData analyses\nTiming: 2.5 h\n      Flow cytometry data can be analyzed in multiple ways depending on the\n      question. Quantitative analyses comparing the amounts of chromatin-bound\n      proteins between different conditions (control and KD) and at specific\n      cell cycle phases can be easily performed. For the example described here,\n      we have used FlowJo software for analysis. However, alternative software\n      such as FCS express or ModFit can be considered as well.\n    \n        Drag and drop the FSC files and repeat gating strategy (steps 30–32).\n      \n        Export single FSC files for each population of barcoded samples. Make\n        sure exports contain the same number of events (10,000 cells).
