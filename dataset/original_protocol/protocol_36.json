    "**Harvest of mouse spleens and preparation of splenic sections**\n**1** Harvest mouse spleens, embed them in OCT compound embedding medium and freeze in liquid nitrogen. \n**2** Cut 7 &#xB5;m sections and mount them on Superfrost Plus slides. \n**3** Incubate slides in humidified chambers overnight at 4 &#x2DA;C and dry them, then fix them in acetone at 4 &#x2DA;C for 10 min and block them with PBS + 5% fetal calf serum at 25 &#x2DA;C for 1 h.\n**Antibody staining and microscopy**\n**4** Stain blocked sections overnight at 4 &#x2DA;C with a combination of anti-CD3-phycoerythrin, anti-B220-FITC, and peanut-agglutinin-biotin, all diluted in blocking buffer \\(all the antibodies need to be titrated for optimal results; dilution 1:200 &#x2013; 1:1000) \\(1). \n**5** Wash the slides 3x with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Stain sections with streptavidin-cyanin 5.5 \\(dilution 1:100) at 25 &#x2DA;C for 1 h. \n**6** Wash the slides 3x with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, dry them and mount them with Gelmount. \n**7** Capture images at x10 magnification with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope."
