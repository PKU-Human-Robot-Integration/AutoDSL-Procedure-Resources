    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstruction of primary and abscopal tumor model in mice\nTiming: 4 days\nCut off the hair of the left and right flanks of mice to expose the skin.\nPreparation of cell suspension.\nTake the LLC cells seeded in 10-cm dishes from the cell incubator to the biosafety cabinet gently and discard the culture medium.\nAdd 1 mL PBS buffer and wash for 1–2 times gently.\nDiscard the PBS buffer.\nAdd 1 mL trypsin and put it in cell incubator for 1 min to digest cells.\nAdd 1 mL complete DMEM medium to stop the process of digestion when the cells shrink and become round observed under a microscope.\nCollect the dissociated cells into 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge at 100 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL PBS buffer to resuspend the cells and take out 100 μL cell suspension to count cells with cell counter.\nAdjust the cell concentration to 2 × 107 cells/mL with PBS buffer in a 5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPut the tube on the ice immediately.\nNote: Enough cells need to be prepared in advance according to the requirement of tumorigenesis.\nMix the cells evenly.\nTake 100 μL of the cell suspension with 1 mL syringe,\nInject this cell suspension into the right flank of the mouse subcutaneously.\nNote: make sure that the amount of cells injected into each mouse is 2 × 106 cells.\nLabel the formed xenograft as the primary tumor. This day is recorded as day 0.\nNote: The cells should be injected subcutaneously within 30 min after suspension.",
    "Critical: The number of tumor cells inoculated to mice should be adjusted according to the immune character of mice and the type of tumor cell line. If the tumorigenicity of cells is poor, the number of tumor cells can be appropriately increased, but not more than 1 × 107 cells/mouse. The number of mice in each group can also be increased to exclude individual differences.\nOn the day 3,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] prepare LLC cells with a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL as the step 2.\nInject 100 μL cell suspension subcutaneously into the left flank of above mouse to generate the abscopal xenograft tumor.\nAfter the completion of tumor inoculation, the mice are fed normally, and the tumor volumes on both flanks are recorded every two days with a digital caliper until the mice are killed.\nNote: For tumor measurements, the tumor volume is calculated with a formula V = (width2×length)/2.\nDrug administration\nTiming: 30 min\nWhen the primary tumor volume reaches to about 50 mm3, the PD-L1 wt and PD-L1−/− mice are divided into 7 groups including control, anti-IFNAR-1, HCQ, IR, IR+ anti-IFNAR-1, IR+ HCQ, and IR+ HCQ+ anti-IFNAR-1. Six mice each group.\nNote: In this experiment, the mice were grouped on the day 9 after the injection of primary tumor.\nLabel the mice genotypes, mice number, and treatment methods on an information card of each cage.\nOne day before irradiation, administer anti-IFNAR-1 (500 μg per mouse)7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] into mice by intraperitoneal injection.\nCritical: The anti-IFNAR-1 should be administered quickly to ensure the valence of antibody, and the antibody should be injected within 30 min.\nTumor fractional irradiation and drug administration model\nTiming: 3 days",
    "On the day 10 after cell injection, the primary tumor with a volume of about 50 mm3 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) is irradiated with a total dose of 24 Gy X-rays in 3 fractions in 3 consecutive days (8 Gy × 3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2179-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of local irradiation of tumor in mice\n(A) The images of xenograft tumors on both flanks of mice on the day of irradiation.\n(B) Tumor irradiation mode. The xenograft tumor is gently clamp out for irradiation, and the rest of mouse body is shielded by lead plates with a total thickness greater than 1 cm.\nCalculate the average weight of mice administrated with HCQ solution.\nNote: The experimental mice are weighed and M (g) is set as the mass of each mouse, the number of mice requiring HCQ administration is represented as n, the value of average weight is recorded as     M ¯   ,    M ¯  =     ∑   i = 0  n  M  n    ( g )   .\nCalculate the amount of the corresponding reagent.\nNote: The dosage of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) in this protocol is 50 mg/kg and the required total mass of HCQ powder (m) is calculated as the formula, m = 0.05    n  M ¯    ( m g )   , 100 μL HCQ solution needs to be given at the weight of mice is    M ¯   , hence, the total mass of HCQ powder needs to be dissolved in 100 × n μL saline.\nWeigh the calculated mass of HCQ powder with electronic balance.\nDissolve the HCQ powder with saline in the 5 mL EP tube.\nNote: Prepare the HCQ solution fresh and used it after fully dissolution.\nCalculate the volume of HCQ solution injected into each mouse.",
    "Note: The volume of HCQ solution injected into each mouse is calculated by using the formula, Vn =    M  M ¯   × 100   ( μL )  ,   and record the value of HCQ solution injected into each mouse. The other mice are given saline as control.\nSuction off HCQ solution or saline with 1 mL syringe.\nInject 100 μL HCQ solution or saline intraperitoneally into mice.\nIrradiate mice with X ray two hours after drug administration.\nInject 1% pentobarbital sodium intraperitoneally into mice with a dose of 50 mg/100 g for anesthesia.\nPut the mouse into a lead mold after the anesthetic takes effect (about 5–10 min).\nClamp out the tumor with tweezers gently, and shield the rest with lead plates (the thickness of lead plate is greater than 1 cm), as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nIrradiate the tumor of mice with 8 Gy X ray.\nObserve the state of mice closely after irradiation, until all mice wake up.\nCarry out the same administration of HCQ and irradiation protocols as above in the next two days.\nNote: During these three days, to keep the same time point of daily administration, the HCQ administration are all conducted 2 h before irradiation.\nPreparation of single cell suspension from tumor tissue\nTiming: 5–6 h\nKill the mice and strip out the transplanted tumor after 21 days of the first tumor cell injection,\nSacrifice the mice by neck breaking as quick as possible to alleviate the pain of mice.\nPin down mouse on its back using needles.\nSpray the mouse body with 75% ethanol.\nCut the mouse skin from the area near the bottom of abdomen to neck with scissors.\nStrip out the tumor capsule with a tweezer and dissect out the tumor gently.",
    "Clean the tumor and put it into the marked 50 mL conical tube containing PBS buffer.\nNote: All the surgical tools should be autoclaved before use. 50 mL centrifuge tubes have been marked in advance according to the different treatment methods of mice and tumor tissue should be immersed in PBS buffer.\nWeigh tumor, then cut it into small pieces less than 1 mm and transfer the tumor tissues into a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd RPMI medium supplemented with 2% FBS to the 50 mL conical tube, 1 mL medium per 1 mg tissue.\nAdd an appropriate amount of collagenase IV into the 50 mL conical tube to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nPut the conical tube into a shaking bath at 37°C until the tissue is digested.\nNote: The time required varies with the type of tumor, but should not exceed 1.5 h to limit the cell viability.\nPass the tissue homogenate through a 70 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube, and clean the strainer several times with serum-free RPMI.\nAdd DNase into the homogenate and incubate at 37°C for 15 min if the tissue homogenate appears to be caked.\nNote: The final concentration of DNase is 10 μg /mL.\nCollect the cells from tissue homogenate after centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min and resuspend with PBS buffer.\nTake a small portion of cells for counting and add PBS buffer to adjust the cell density to 1 × 107 cells/mL.\nPreparation of cells for immunostaining.\nFor the staining of cell surface antigen, add 100 μL of cell suspension to 1.5 mL EP tubes, 106 cells per tube.",
    "For the staining of intracellular cytokine, the 2 × 106 cells are resuspended with 500 μL RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, add 1 μL cell stimulation cocktail (containing protein transport inhibitors) in the cell suspension.\nPlate the cell suspension in a 12-well plate and culture cells in an incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 16 h.\nCritical: For the cells that need to be used for subsequent culture, the process of preparing single cells from tissues need to be carried out in a biosafety cabinet.\nCell surface antigen staining\nTiming: about 1 h\nResuspend cells with 100 μL FACS buffer.\nPre-incubate with Fc receptor blocker (TruStain FcX™ PLUS) for 5–10 min on ice, 0.25 μg/106 cells in 100 μL FACS buffer.\nAdd fluorescence-labeled antibodies to stain the cells and keep away from light. The reference antibody concentrations are: Anti-CD3 (2 μg/mL), anti-CD4 (1 μg/mL), anti-CD8 (1 μg/mL), anti-NK1.1 (1 μg/mL), anti-CD44 (1 μg/mL), anti-CD62L (1 μg/mL), and anti-PD-1 (1 μg/mL).\nFor the samples of the experimental group, due to the overlapping fluorescence labeling and wavelength of antibodies, the mixing scheme of antibodies is divided into the following two groups:\nAnti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-NK1.1.\nAnti-CD3, anti-CD8, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L, anti-PD-1.\nFor the samples of single staining group, we add the sample cells of specific group to 7 EP tubes, respectively, 50 μL cell suspension per tube. Add one antibody (anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-NK1.1, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L, or anti-PD-1) to each EP tube, and the amount of antibody is half of the amount of corresponding antibody in the experimental group.\nNote: The whole process of staining should be kept away from light to avoid the loss of fluorescence.",
    "Critical: Antibodies with intersecting fluorescence wavelengths can’t be used to stain cells in the same tube. Each antibody needs to be set with a single staining tube to adjust the fluorescence compensation. In the single staining group, the specific group refers to the experimental group with the highest antigen expression inferred from the pre-experiment, which can ensure that there is a fluorescence signal during fluorescence modulation compensation.\nStain the sample at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL FACS buffer to wash cells, centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL FACS buffer to resuspend cells in preparation for flow cytometry analysis.\nIntracellular cytokine staining\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCollect the cells and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant after 16 h of cell stimulation.\nAdd 500 μL FACS buffer to wash cells, centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells with 100 μL FACS buffer.\nPre-incubate with Fc receptor blocker (TruStain FcX™ PLUS) for 5–10 min on ice, 0.25 μg/106 cells in 100 μL FACS buffer.\nAdd CD8 fluorescent antibody (1 μg/mL) to stain cells in dark condition for 30 min at 4°C. This step is the same as that of staining cell surface antigen.\nNote: The whole process of staining should be kept away from light to avoid the loss of fluorescence.\nCritical: If the cells are not sorted, cells need to be stained with antibodies of cell surface marker in advance.\nAdd 1 mL FACS buffer to each tube to wash the cells, and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.",
    "Add 100 μL fixation buffer to fix the cells at 4°C for 20 min.\nNote: The purpose of this step is to stabilize the binding of antibodies and antigens on the surface of cell membrane.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells with 100 μL 1× perm/wash buffer.\nNote: The main function of perm buffer is to break the cell membrane and clean cells.\nAdd fluorescence-labeled antibody to stain the cell cytokines in dark condition. The reference antibody concentration is 2 μg/mL for IFN-γ.\nAfter adding the antibody, stain the sample at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nAdd 500 μL 1× perm/wash buffer to wash cells, centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL FACS buffer into the cells for flow cytometry analysis.\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTiming: about 30 min\nFilter the single cell suspension with a 200-mesh filter membrane and place them in the flow tubes.\nAdjust the fluorescence compensation with single staining tube. The operation of adjusting fluorescence compensation is as follows, taking the detection of CD3, CD4 and CD8 indicators as an example.\nAccording to the required staining indicators, make a pair combination and set the X-Y plot on the computer in advance. When the number of indicators is n, the total number of plots is 3×(n-2).\nCollect the cells of the single staining tube respectively, and adjust the compensation value, so that there is a detection signal on the staining channel and no signal on other non-staining channels. The compensation plots of each single staining tube are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2179-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Adjustment of the fluorescent compensation by single staining tube",
    "(A–C) Set CD3 vs CD4, CD3 vs CD8, CD4 vs CD8 gate respectively, adjust fluorescent compensation with single staining tubes of CD3 (A), CD4 (B) and CD8 (C).\nNote: Fluorescence of all detected single staining samples cannot be in the same fluorescent channel.\nAnalyze cell samples with a flow cytometry. For samples stained only on the cell surface, collect 1 × 105 cells. For the cell samples for detecting intracellular factors, collect 5 × 104 cells.\nNote: The number of cells used for flow cytometric analysis is not fixed. In tumor cells, due to the small proportion of some infiltrating immune cells, the number of collected samples should be expanded in order to be able to detect certain populations.\nThe detailed gating strategy shown as Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nSet the initial FSC vs SSC gate to circle the lymphocyte population (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: In this step, we have carefully circled the main cell cluster, largely excluding the stray cells and dead cells.\nSet FSC-H vs FSC-W gate (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and SSC-H vs SSC-W gate (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) to remove adherent cells.\nCritical: The cell population with constant height (H) and increased width (W) are adherent cells.\nSet CD3 vs SSC gate to circle the CD3+ T lymphocytes (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nSet CD4 vs CD8 gate to circle the CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E); Set CD8 vs SSC gate to circle the CD8+ T lymphocytes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nGated CD8+ T lymphocytes. Set CD8 vs PD-1 gate to circle CD8+PD-1+ T lymphocytes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F); Set CD62L vs CD44 gate to circle CD44+CD62L- T lymphocytes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G); Set CD8 vs IFN-γ to circle CD8+PD-1+ T lymphocytes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nNote: In the process of flow cytometric detection, operate under dark condition.",
