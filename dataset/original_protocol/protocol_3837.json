    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions from Drosophila tissues\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of samples)\nWestern blots of detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions can be obtained substantially as described previously (Demontis and Perrimon, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) with the following procedures.\nHomogenize Drosophila tissues in Triton X-100 lysis buffer with the aid of a tissue homogenizer.\nThoraces, heads, or specific fly tissues are dissected from 30 or more flies (corresponding to around >3 mg of tissue) and homogenized in 90 μL (3 μL/tissue) of ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer, i.e., 1% Triton X-100 in PBS that contains EDTA and that is MgCl2- and CaCl2-free (Gibco #10010023) with protease inhibitors (1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail mix in 10 mL of buffer; Roche #11836153001) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 μL of phosphatase inhibitor cocktail mix in 10 mL of buffer, Sigma #P5726).\nThe homogenization is done in a tissue homogenizer (NextAdvance) with 0.5-mm zirconium oxide beads at 4°C at maximum speed for 5 min.\nAll samples should be homogenized in safe-lock microcentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: Homogenization is a crucial step. If the tissue is not homogenized well, tissue fragments (and hence some Triton X-100 soluble proteins) will be pulled into the insoluble fraction, resulting in unreliable experimental results. The use of white-colored beads for the homogenization of dark tissues (like Drosophila thoraces and heads) allows visual determination of the completeness of tissue homogenization. If tissue fragments are still present, the sample should be homogenized again for 1–2 minutes (or more if needed). The sample should be visually inspected to ensure that homogenization is complete (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). No unneeded homogenization should be done as this increase foaming and the sample temperature and hence the chance for protein degradation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/753-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Impact of speed and time on homogenization",
    "Representative images of samples each consisting of 5 whole Drosophila homogenized at different speeds and for different time intervals in 150 μL PBS. After homogenization, the samples were briefly centrifuged for 15 s to bring down debris. In the upper panel, the samples are homogenized at maximum speed (10) but for a variable homogenization time (0 s, 10 s, 1 min, 3 min, 5 min). Note the presence of floating, unhomogenized tissues when the homogenization is run for only 10 s. Samples appear to be well homogenized after 3 and 5 min. In the lower panel, the samples are homogenized for a maximum time (5 min) but at variable speeds (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Note the presence of unhomogenized tissues (such as red fly eyes) at speed 2 and 4. Samples appear to be well homogenized at speed 6, 8, and 10. Homogenize at the maximum speed (10) and time (5 min) for best results.\nRecover Triton X-100 soluble fractions following centrifugation of homogenate from step 1.\nHomogenates are then centrifuged at 21,000 × g (in a Thermo Scientific Sorvall Legend Micro 21 refrigerated microcentrifuge and rotor #75772446, or equivalent) at 4°C for 10 min to pellet down detergent-insoluble fractions.\nThe supernatant is then collected as Triton X-100 soluble fraction.\nWash the pellet with Triton X-100 lysis buffer.\nThe remaining pellet, which consists of detergent-insoluble fractions (together with beads), is washed 2–3 times. For each wash, 400 μL to 1 mL Triton X-100 buffer are added to the pellet and the samples centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant is then discarded.\nCritical: Washing is an important step to make sure that the soluble proteins are completely removed before solubilizing the insoluble protein pellet.",
    "Solubilize the insoluble pellet proteins in 8M urea and 5% SDS buffer to collect Triton X-100 insoluble fraction.\nThe pellet is resuspended at 4°C by homogenization for 5 min at highest speed in a tissue homogenizer (0.5-mm zirconium oxide beads are present from the previous step to aid homogenization) with 90 μL RIPA buffer containing 8M urea, 5% SDS, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors.\nSubsequently, the sample is centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nThe supernatant, which consists of the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, is then collected, and used for subsequent analysis.\nCritical: Both urea and SDS are toxic chemicals. All personal protective equipment should be used while making solutions.\nNote: 20% SDS solution can be made in water and later adjusted to final concentration as per the requirement. Urea buffer should be made fresh and kept at 22°C–25°C. A 30°C incubator can be used to aid urea dissolution in water. While collecting the insoluble protein fractions, the samples can be kept at 22°C–25°C to ease collection as urea precipitates at lower temperatures.\nNote: Purity of soluble and insoluble protein fractions can be assessed by using antibodies against proteins present exclusively in the soluble fraction like GAPDH (glyceraldehye 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or in the insoluble fraction like Histone H3.\nNote: Since equal quantities of tissues are used as starting point for homogenization, equal volumes of detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions are used for subsequent analyses. The amount of protein is further validated by using antibodies against α-tubulin or β-actin.\nPreparation of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions from human brain organoids\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of samples)",
    "Detergent-soluble and insoluble protein fractions from human brain organoids (obtained as described in (Rai et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) were prepared as described above for Drosophila tissues with a few notable changes. The protocol is described below.\nHomogenize brain organoids in Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer with the aid of a tissue homogenizer.\nHuman brain organoids are briefly washed with PBS at 22°C–25°C to remove culture medium, removed from the cultured wells by using pipette tips with trimmed tips, and gently pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. Because of their dimensions, organoids are visible by naked eye and consequently a similar number of organoids (e.g., 2–3) can be pooled into each eppendorf tube.\n50 μL of Triton X-100 lysis buffer is used for homogenization of pools of 2–3 organoids per sample. Homogenization is done for 30 s at maximum speed by using a tissue homogenizer (NextAdvance) and zirconium 0.5-mm beads at 4°C.\nCritical: Do not homogenize for more than 30 seconds as excessive homogenization can lead to protein denaturation and poor yields of protein fractions.\nRecover Triton X-100 soluble fractions following centrifugation of homogenate from step 5.\nHomogenates from step 5 are centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet down detergent-insoluble fractions.\nThe supernatant is then collected as Triton X-100 soluble fraction.\nWash the pellet with Triton X-100 lysis buffer.\nThe remaining pellet from step 6 is washed with 400 μL to 1 mL of Triton X-100 buffer and the samples centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant is then discarded. The washing is repeated 1–2 times.\nRecover Triton X-100 insoluble proteins by solubilizing the pellet in 8M urea and 5% SDS buffer.",
    "The pellet (along with the beads) from step 7 is homogenized in 50 μL RIPA buffer containing 8M urea, 5% SDS, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors.\nSubsequently, the sample is centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nThe supernatant, which consists of the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, is then collected, and used for subsequent analysis.\nNote: Protein concentration in Triton X-100 soluble fractions is quantitated using the BCA assay with BSA (bovine serum albumin) as protein standard. The amount of detergent-soluble protein loaded on SDS-PAGE gels is determined based on the amount of protein quantified in detergent-soluble fractions. However, protein quantitation is not possible from insoluble fractions as the BCA assay reagents are not compatible with urea/SDS. On this basis, the volume of detergent-insoluble protein loaded on SDS-PAGE gels is determined based on the amount of protein quantified in the corresponding detergent-soluble fractions. The amount of protein loaded is further normalized by using antibodies against α-tubulin or β-actin.\nNote: Typically, ~15–50 μg of protein can be obtained from 3–4 organoids. If the homogenization is done in 50 μL, this results in ~0.3–1 μg/μL. The sizes of organoids differ and can significantly change the amount of protein retrieved, which makes it imperative to quantify the protein concentration.\nPreparation of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions from HEK293 cells\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of samples)\nDetergent-soluble and insoluble fractions from human HEK293 cells are obtained following the procedures described before for mammalian cells (Holden and Horton, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), i.e., with some changes compared to the main protocol described above for Drosophila tissues.\nResuspend HEK 293 cells in Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer.",
    "Remove excess media from cell culture wells and leave only 500 μL–1 mL of media. Scrape cells by using a cell scraper (no additional trypsin required) and collect in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells. Discard any media present in the tube carefully without disturbing the cell pellet.\nHEK293 cell lysis is not done with a tissue homogenizer but rather by resuspending the cells by gentle pipetting in ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors).\nCollect Triton X-100 soluble fractions following centrifugation of homogenate from step 9.\nHomogenates from step 9 are centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet down detergent-insoluble fractions.\nThe supernatant is collected as Triton X-100 soluble fraction.\nWash the pellet with Triton X-100 lysis buffer.\nThe pellet from step 10 is washed with 400 μL to 1 mL of Triton X-100 buffer and the samples centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant is then discarded. The washing is repeated 1–2 times.\nRecover Triton X-100 insoluble proteins by solubilizing the pellet in 7M urea and 1% SDS buffer.\nThe pellet from step 11 is resuspended in RIPA buffer with 7M Urea and 100 U/mL Benzonase and incubated at 22°C–25°C for 15–20 min to allow digestion of genomic DNA.\nAfter which, SDS is added to a final concentration of 1%. The detergent-insoluble fraction is further extracted by resuspending the pellet using a tissue homogenizer (without beads) at maximum speed for 30 s. The samples are then centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nThe supernatant, which consists of the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, is then collected, and used for subsequent analysis.",
    "Critical: Benzonase concentration depends on the density of cells used. If there is a bigger pellet corresponding to more cells, a higher concentration of Benzonase should be used to ensure sufficient DNA degradation. As a reference, the above protocol is based on experiments with ~200,000 cells/well (of a 6-well plate) and cultured for ~4 days before harvest.\nCritical: Do not add SDS before or during Benzonase treatment as SDS can denature the enzyme. Add SDS only 15–20 minutes after Benzonase treatment.\nNote concerning estimation of protein concentrations: As described in the protocols above, protein concentration is quantitated for the detergent-soluble protein fractions and equivalent volumes of the corresponding detergent-insoluble fractions are then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of protein loaded is further normalized by using antibodies against α-tubulin or β-actin. A typical protein concentration for detergent-soluble fractions is 1–2 μg/μL (100–200 μg in 100 μL) for ~200,000 cells/well (of a 6-well plate) cultured for ~4 days before harvest.\nPreparation of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble protein fractions from mouse skeletal muscle\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of samples)\nHomogenize dissected mouse skeletal muscles in NP-40 lysis buffer using a tissue homogenizer\nMouse muscles are dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nSubsequently, muscle tissues are homogenized in ice-cold NP40 cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen #FNN0021; 200 μL per ~5 mg of mouse muscle tissue), containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, by using a tissue homogenizer (NextAdvance) with zirconium 0.5-mm beads at 4°C at maximum speed for 5 min.\nRecover NP-40 soluble fractions following centrifugation of homogenate from step 13.\nThe tissue homogenates are subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4oC to pellet insoluble material.\nSubsequently, the supernatant (NP-40 detergent-soluble protein fraction) is collected.\nWash the pellet with NP-40 buffer",
    "The remaining pellet from step 14, which consists of NP-40 detergent-insoluble fractions, is washed three times. For each wash, 400 μL to 1 mL ice-cold NP40 cell lysis buffer is added to the pellet and the samples centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant is discarded.\nRecover NP-40 detergent-insoluble fractions by resuspending the pellet in 8M Urea and 1% SDS buffer.\n8M urea and 1% SDS in PBS (insoluble buffer) is added to solubilize the detergent-insoluble pellet.\nThe specific volume added is determined based on the concentration of the corresponding detergent-soluble fraction. For example, if the detergent-soluble fractions of sample A and sample B are 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL respectively, then 100 μL of insoluble buffer is added to sample A and 200 μL to sample B.\nNote: 8M urea dissolved in RIPA buffer can be used in step 16 rather than 8M urea and 1% SDS in PBS.\nNote: The protein concentration of detergent-soluble fractions is determined by using standard assays, such as the Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA as a standard (1 mg/mL at highest concentration and ½ serial dilutions); samples are usually diluted 1/10 in water to ensure they are in the range of the BSA standard. The sample concentrations are interpolated into the linear curve for the BSA standard, and the final concentration is determined by factoring in the 1/10 dilution. Detergent-soluble protein fractions are then diluted to matching concentrations using NP40 buffer as diluent. For example, if sample A was 1 mg/mL protein in 100 μL and sample B was 2 mg/mL in 100 μL then 100 μL of NP40 buffer should be added to sample B, such that both samples now have a matching concentration of 1 mg/mL.",
    "Note: Utilization of NP40 cell lysis buffer is more amenable to certain follow-up applications such as immunoprecipitation.\nNote: Certain tissues such as heart, spleen, and bone, are more difficult to homogenize. While the procedure described above works optimally for skeletal muscle, a modification of the protocol could include the utilization of a different set of beads, such as the NAVY bead lysis kit (NextAdvance), which consists of microcentrifuge tubes pre-filled with a mix of stainless-steel beads of different sizes.\nNote: Typically, ~1 mg of protein can be obtained from the detergent-soluble fraction from 10 mg of muscle tissue (mouse tibialis anterior muscle).\nSDS-PAGE of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions\nTiming: 2–3 h of work (depending on the number of blots) distributed over several days.\nSample preparation for SDS-PAGE\nProtein samples are combined with SDS blue loading buffer containing DTT (Cell signaling #7722, as per user’s manual) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min.\nThe samples are centrifuged briefly to collect the sample to the bottom of the tube and then loaded into 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) with a protein weight marker in one well.\nSubsequently, standard procedures for SDS-PAGE and western blotting are used. Typically, the gels run for 1.5–2 h at 100 V and transfer is done at 100 V for 1 h.\nBlotting conditions are done following standard protocols, including typical dilutions of 1:1000 for primary antibodies and 1:5000 for secondary antibodies.\nNote: Typically, 5 μg of proteins for detergent-soluble fractions and an equal volume of detergent-insoluble fraction (corresponding to the detergent-soluble fraction) are examined by SDS-PAGE.\nData collection and analysis\nTiming: <1 h of work (depending on the number of blots)",
    "Once the western blots are developed, the intensity of the bands can be estimated with a number of software programs, including the Histogram function of Photoshop, NIH ImageJ, and others. Multiple independent experiments with the same or related experimental interventions and/or side comparison of biological replicates is recommended.\nStatistical analysis is done with appropriate standard tests. For example, the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups to each other whereas one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test is used for multiple comparisons of more than two groups of normally distributed data."
