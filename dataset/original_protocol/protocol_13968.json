    "The protocol followed the ethical guidelines of Southampton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Informed consent was obtained for the use of the tissue for teaching and research purposes.\nNOTE: The relevant steps are summarized in Table 2 and the relevant materials in Table of Materials.\n1. Specimen orientation\nNOTE: In order to aid the histopathologist in accurate specimen orientation, ensure that the operating surgeon places orientation sutures to mark the posterior dissection plane, the splenic vessel margins, and the pancreatic transection margin.\nUpon receipt, fix the specimen in formalin, at room temperature, for 24−48 h.\n\tNOTE: Fixation may cause distortion of the specimen which makes accurate orientation difficult as the anterior peritoneal surface and retroperitoneal (posterior dissection) margin may have similar appearances. Furthermore, some centers take fresh tumor samples for research purposes. In this situation, care should be given to minimize distortion by inking, before fixation, one or more margins, if these are to be incised while the specimen is fresh.\nIdentify posterior dissection plane by orientation suture (placed by the operating surgeon) or by the presence of the spleen, which is lateral, and the splenic vessels on the postero-superior border, the suture marking the posterior dissection margin, and staples marking the (medial) transection margin. Identify also other margins/surfaces. Finally identify the spleen.\n\tNOTE: In this specimen the anterior surface, transection margin, posterior margin, superior border, inferior border, and additional gastric wedge can be identified.\nEnsure that the peripancreatic fat remains intact and attached to the specimen.\n2. Measurements\nMeasure all dimensions in millimeters.\nMeasure the pancreas from medial to lateral (95 mm for this specimen), cranial to caudal (30 mm), and anterior to posterior (20 mm).",
    "Measure the spleen also from cranial to caudal (110 mm for this specimen), anterior to posterior (60 mm), and medial to lateral (20 mm). In addition, weigh the spleen if possible (see the note below).\n\tNOTE: If the tumor is in close proximity to the splenic hilum, the spleen should not be separated from the pancreas and weighing of spleen should be done en bloc with the pancreas.\nMeasure any potential additional organs, including the adrenal gland.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, the gastric wall was resected and measured. The wedge stomach measures 35 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm.\n3. Inking\nHaving measured the pancreas and spleen in three dimensions, ink the posterior dissection margin, transection margin, anterior peritonealized surface, and additional organ margins using different colors. If the splenic vessel margins appear grossly involved, ink these in order to identify the true margin with 'en face' sections.\nThough, not a requirement for margin assessment, ink the superior and inferior border of the pancreas for improved specimen orientation and to microscopically group lymph nodes into the relevant anatomical stations in single transverse sections on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides.\nFurthermore, ink any additional margin (e.g., the gastric wall margin) with a different color.\n\tNOTE: The specimen is inked in the following manner: the anteriorperitonealized surface is inked in yellow, the gastric wall margin is inked in blue, the transection margin is inked in red, the superior border of the pancreas is inked in green in order to identify station 11 lymph nodes, the inferior border is inked in orange to identify station 18 nodes, and the posterior dissection margin is inked in black.\n4. Dissection",
    "Following measurement and inking of the specimen, use a blade to cut blocks from the transection and splenic vessel margins. Remove with the blade the staples in order to take an 'en face' section of the transection margin. Cut closely to the staple line to preserve as much of the proximity to the true margin.\n\tNOTE: The staple line of the transection margin must be removed as metal staples cannot be cut by the microtome blades.\nCut with the blade a single 'en face' section of 3−5 mm of the transection margin of the splenic artery and vein. Alternatively, cut bread slices of 3−5 mm of the transection margin perpendicular to the stapled margin.\n\tNOTE: The splenic artery and vein are in close proximity to the transection margin and are usually marked with clips. This can be used to give accurate distances of tumor to the margin.\nRemove any additional margins using the blade.\n\tNOTE: In the accompanying video, the staple line from the gastric wedge resection is removed.\nUsing a long knife slice the specimen from medial to lateral (transection margin to spleen) in 3−5 mm intervals, and number the slices (for example 1−15, with 15 slices). Do not remove any of the posterior pancreatic fat.\nWith the transverse sections of the specimen laid out from medial to lateral, record the number of tumors, including their location (body, and/or tail), appearance(s), and maximum tumor size(s).",
    "NOTE: Unlike tumors of the pancreatic head where the significance of named vessel involvement is reflected in TNM staging, with superior mesenteric artery and/or coeliac axis involvement corresponding to pT4 disease, the clinical significance of splenic artery invasion remains under investigation11. For the purpose of future investigation, it is recommended to record the splenic artery and vein involvement within the macroscopic description, and to confirm it microscopically. The splenic artery lies in the superior border of the pancreas, while the vein runs along the posterior border of the pancreas.\n5. Tumor assessment\nAssess the tumor and its involvement of margins and/or (splenic) vessels.\n\tNOTE: Here, the tumor is present in slices 9−14. The cut surface of the tumor is pale and homogeneous.\nMeasure the macroscopic tumor size in three dimensions (cranial to caudal, medial to lateral, and anterior to posterior).\n\tNOTE: Here, the tumor measures 30 mm cranial to caudal plane, 25 mm anterior to posterior, and 13 mm medial to lateral. The measurement is based on slice thickness. Most commonly maximum tumor size is in the medial to lateral plane. This measurement is assessed adding up the slice thickness of each slide containing tumor. Distances to margins can be difficult to assess macroscopically as ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have a highly dispersed growth8,12. On this basis, while an estimation of the distances to the margins can be recorded in the macroscopic description, corroboration of these findings microscopically based on adequate tumor sampling is important.\nSlice the spleen with perpendicular section with 3−5 mm intervals starting from its outer convexity and proceed inwards towards the splenic hilum. In cases where the tumor is in close proximity to the spleen, keep the spleen intact with the specimen and take section in continuity between the tumor and spleen.\n6. Tissue sampling",
    "As is done for pancreatoduodenectomy specimens, rationalize block selection to demonstrate tumor type, size, large vessel and other organ involvement, nodal staging, margin status, and tumor regression in cases where neo-adjuvant therapy has been given. Make close-up photographs of the specimen slices.\n\tNOTE: The block selection includes the transection margin, (splenic) vascular resection margins, gastric wall margins, blocks of tumor demonstrating maximum size and distance to margins, background pancreas, representative section of spleen, and lymph nodes.\nTake tissue samples from the tumor en-bloc with the peripancreatic fat from the superior and inferior borders that harbors lymph nodes from stations 11 and 18. Dissect out individual lymph nodes from the peripancreatic fat in parts of the specimen that are well away from the tumor site.\n\tNOTE: Especially take additional samples from what macroscopically seems to be the periphery of the tumor and the adjacent tissues that appear tumor-free. It is in the latter that microscopically invasive tumor is most often found to be present. The same rationale for thorough block taking applies to the assessment of the margins. In contrast to colorectal carcinomas that typically have a more well-circumscribed tumor front, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas have an infiltrative, discontinuous pattern of growth. The interface of tumor with normal pancreas is often obscured by the presence of chronic pancreatitis, placing further onus on margin sampling3. It is strongly recommended not to remove the posterior peripancreatic fat, as this will compromise assessment of the posterior margin.\nFor tumors 20 mm or less, sample the entire tumor to allow for accurate pT staging. For larger tumors, sample sufficient tissue. When sampling tumor, include the peripancreatic fat, lymph nodes and the relationship with margins and adjacent structures.",
    "NOTE: In the accompanying video, the relationship between tumor and gastric wall is highlighted. Regional lymph nodes for the distal pancreas are station 11 along the superior border of the pancreas, station 18 along the inferior border, and station 10 within the splenic hilar fat13. For tumors located in the pancreatic body the surgeon will additionally resect lymph node stations 8a and 9, which are submitted in separate pots.\nTake perpendicular sections of the spleen at 3−5 mm intervals, followed by sampling of splenic hilum (station 10) lymph nodes.\n\tNOTE: There is no recommendation on whether to remove the spleen from the specimen or not. In case the tumor is located in the tip of the pancreas, do not remove the spleen and extent the sagittal slicing into the spleen.\nTake blocks from additional organs.\nSubscription Required.
