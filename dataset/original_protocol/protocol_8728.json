    "Ethics Statement: Procedures involving animal subjects have been handled under protocols approved by the Valladolid University animal housing facility in agreement with the European Convention 123/Council of Europe and Directive 86/609/EEC.\n1. Short and Long-term Culture of Rat Hippocampal Neurons\nPreparation of poly-D-lysine coated, 12 mm glass coverslips.\n\t\nSterilize 12 mm diameter glass coverslips in ethanol for at least 24 hr. Allow them to dry under sterile conditions.\nDistribute the coverslips on a strip of parafilm in a Petri dish. Cover the surface of each coverslip with 200 µl of 1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine. Allow treating O/N.\nThe next day wash the coverslips with double distilled sterile water every 15 min for 90 min under sterile conditions.\nFill a four-well multidish plate with 500 µl of Neurobasal Culture Medium per well. Neurobasal Culture Medium should be supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 % B27, 1 µg/ml gentamicin and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nPlace the coverslips in the multidish plate. Maintain them in a humidified 37 ºC and 5% CO2 incubator until use.\nIsolation of hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats.\n\t\nPrepare 1.8 ml papain solution (directly purchased) in a vial (20 µl/ml) under sterile conditions: To obtain a final concentration of 20 µl/ml add around 40 µl papain in 1.8 ml Hank's plus 0.6% BSA (µl should be calculated depending on the supplier conditions). Hank's 0.6% BSA is prepared by mixing 85 ml of HBSS medium with 15 ml of 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, prepared solving 4 g of BSA in 100 ml HBSS). Prepare it in a sterile hood.\nIncubate the papain in Hank's plus 0.6% BSA for 30 min at 37 ºC before use. Filter the solution using a 0.22 µm filter prior to use.",
    "Prepare Ham's F-12 medium by adding Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium powder (13.5 g per L) in 900 ml of double distilled sterile water. Then add 6 g HEPES and 336 mg NaHCO3 and adjust the pH to 7.42 using NaOH 4 N. Add sterile water in order to obtain a 1 L solution and filter it using a 0.20 µm polyethersulfone (PES) bottle top filter. Carry this process in a sterile hood. Finally saturate the solution with CO2 under sterile conditions before use. Store solutions at 4 ºC and use them chilled.\nEuthanize newborn (P0) rat pups by decapitation and wash the head in sterile HBS medium. Open the skull with the help of sterile scissors. Extract the brain with a spatula and wash it quickly in Ham's F-12 medium.\nMake a diagonal cut with the aid of a scalpel in each hemisphere (Figure 1B), and carry it to a Petri dish containing Ham's F-12 medium.\nDiscard meninges carefully with the help of dissection forceps and under a magnifying glass.\nIdentify the hippocampus in a characteristic concave location over the cortex using magnifying glass. Then, separate the hippocampus from the cortex by pulling carefully from one border and removing it from its position using eye scissors.\nTransfer the hippocampal tissue to a 4-well plate filled with sterile Hank's medium lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+ plus 0.6% BSA and wash hippocampal tissue. Without removing the media cut the tissue in small pieces (around 2 x 2 mm) using the same eye scissors.\nTransfer hippocampal pieces to a vial containing 1.8 ml pre-filtered papain solution. Then incubate them at 37 ºC with occasional, gentle shaking. 15 min later, add 90 µl of DNase I solution (50 µg/ml final) and incubate for 15 additional min.",
    "Transfer the tissue to a 10 ml centrifuge tube and wash the fragments with fresh Neurobasal Culture Medium. Obtain cell suspension by passing tissue fragments through a 5 ml plastic pipette.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 160 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant using a plastic sterile Pasteur pipette and suspend pellet carefully with a 1 ml automated pipette in 1 ml of Neurobasal Culture Medium.\nMeasure cell density using a Neubauer counting chamber. Put the glass coverslip over the Neubauer chamber. Add 10 µl of cell suspension. Make sure the cell suspension enters the chamber uniformly and making no bubbles. Count the number of cells under the microscope and perform corresponding calculations to obtain a suitable drop of 40-80 µl containing 30 x 103 cells. The total number of cells will depend on the number of animals used.\nShort-term and long-term culture of rat hippocampal neurons.\n\t\nOver the four-well multidish plate containing 500 µl of Neurobasal Culture Medium prepared before and kept in the incubator, plate around 30 x 103 cells in a drop of about 50 µl to each well of the multidish plate containing one poly-D-lysine-coated, 12 mm diameter glass coverslip.\nMaintain primary hippocampal cells in a humidified 37 ºC and 5% CO2 incubator for 2-5 days in vitro (DIV, short-term, young cultures) or >15 DIV (Long-term, aged cultures) before experiments without changing the culture media.\n2. Fluorescence Imaging of Cytosolic Ca 2+ Concentration\nPreparation of test solutions for fluorescence imaging.\n\t\nPrepare an external HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) solution containing, in mM: NaCl 145, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, glucose 10, sodium-HEPES 10 (pH 7.42).\nPrepare an external, Mg2+-free, HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) solution containing, in mM: NaCl 146, KCl 5, CaCl2 1, glucose 10 and HEPES 10 (pH 7.42).",

Bioluminescence Imaging of Mitochondrial Ca 2+ Concentration\nTransfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with the mitGAmut plasmid.\n\tNOTE: Cells are first transfected with the mitGAmut plasmid containing a mitochondria-targeted sequence and a mutated aequorin lacking a Ca2+ binding site fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). This construction detects large rises in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and allows the identification of transfected cells by the GFP fluorescence. The plasmid was developed and kindly provided by P. Brûlet and co-workers 18 (CNRS, Paris).\n\t\nPrepare Neurobasal TF, containing Neurobasal Culture Medium, lacking fetal bovine serum, B27, gentamicin and 2 mM L-glutamine.",

Photonic emissions can be converted to mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]mit) using the algorithm described by Brini et al. 15.\nOpen the experiment and the GFP fluorescence image. Select regions of interest (ROIs) with the help of specific software by drawing the shape of the transfected cells according to the fluorescence images captured at the beginning of the experiment.\nPaste the same ROIs on every image. Total photonic emissions in each ROI are computed with specific software to obtain the luminescence emission value (L) for each cell at each point in time.",
    "Add up all the photonic emissions in the bioluminescence images, including the ones obtained after digitonin permeabilization, using the specific software, to obtain a bioluminescence image containing all the photonic emissions.\nExport values of photonic emissions for every region of interest to a specific software for calculations. To do this, click on 'Graph' in order to compute the bioluminescence values for every ROI at each time. Select 'total value' and 'use current ROI to all images. Press 'calculate'. Save the 'txt.file' and export data to a worksheet. For every ROI, [Ca2+]mit is calculated using the following algorithm:\n\t\t[Ca2+](M) = [R + (R · KTR) - 1] / [KR - (R · KR)];\n\t\twhere,\n\t\tR = [L/(Ltotalλ)]1/n\n\t\tL is the luminescence emitted at the time of measurement in each region of interest.\n\t\tLtotal is the total luminescence remaining after addition of the counts present in the tissue at that time at the time of measurement for each region of interest. λ, KTR, KR and n are constants whose values depend on combination of aequorin (wild type or mutated) and coelenterazin used (wild type or n type) as well as the recording temperature 16. For the combination used here (mutated AEQ and coelenterzine n), at 37 ºC, we used the following values: KR = 8.47 x 107, KTR = 165.6 x 103, n = 1,204 and λ = 0,138.\nMake the corresponding calculations for estimating the size of the rises in bioluminescence in response to each stimulus using a suitable data analysis and graphing software.\nSubscription Required.
