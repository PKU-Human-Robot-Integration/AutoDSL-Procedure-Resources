    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Lewis & Clark College.\n1. Microinjection of Zebrafish Embryos\nSet up wild type, adult zebrafish in sex-segregated mating tanks the afternoon prior to performing microinjections39,40.\nPrepare the DNA solution in the morning of the microinjections. Dilute hsp:Zebrabow11 plasmid DNA to a concentration of ~10 ng/μL in 0.1 mM KCl, along with 2.5% phenol red and 3.75U Cre recombinase enzyme.\nPerform microinjections of DNA solution into one-cell zebrafish embryos within 45 min of fertilization39,41. Inject approximately 4.2 nL of this solution into each embryo, equivalent to ~42 pg of plasmid DNA.\nNOTE: The microinjection step can be omitted if a transgenic, Brainbow-expressing zebrafish line is mated instead, such as Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)15 and Tg(neurod:Zebrabow)18. Performing microinjections can be advantageous because it allows researchers to titrate the copy number and labeling density. Furthermore, a second DNA construct that tags or manipulates a specific gene product can be injected alongside Brainbow if desired (e.g., a far-red fluorescent protein that complements Brainbow18).\nMaintain injected embryos in Petri dishes of E3 medium39 in a 28 °C incubator for 24 h.\n2. Heat Shock to Induce Brainbow Expression\nNOTE: If the plasmid DNA injected or the transgene expressed does not utilize the hsp70 promoter to drive the expression, the heat shock step can be skipped, and healthy embryos should be immediately transferred to phenylthiourea (PTU) at 24 h post fertilization (hpf).\nAt 24 hpf, cull dead and deformed embryos from the group of injected embryos. Then, transfer the healthy embryos to a 50 mL tube, with up to 20 embryos/tube.\nFill the tubes with 10 mL of E3. Place a cap on top of each tube but do not close tightly.",
    "Place the tube rack containing the 50 mL tubes upright in a 37 °C water bath. Ensure that the water level in the bath is higher than the level of the E3 in the tubes and leave them for 80 to 90 min.\nRemove the tube rack with the embryos from the water bath and return to the 28 °C incubator upright. Allow up to 1 h for the E3 to cool and the embryos to gradually re-acclimate to the temperature. Then, transfer the embryos to Petri dishes of 0.2 mM PTU in E3 warmed in the incubator to prevent pigmentation of embryos.\nCAUTION: PTU is a toxic chemical that should be handled with care and disposed of appropriately. Wearing gloves is suggested.\n3. Screening Embryos for Brainbow Expression\nAt 2 to 4 h after the heat shock, examine the embryos under a standard fluorescence dissection microscope for expression of CFP or YFP, which indicates successful Brainbow recombination (from default expression of dTomato).\nNOTE: If multiple fluorescence filter options are available, screening for CFP is the most efficient way to identify well-recombined fish. If CFP and YFP filters are not available, YFP can also be dimly visualized under green fluorescent protein (GFP) filters due to the overlap in their spectral profiles.\nSelect embryos with robust FP expression throughout and transfer to a separate dish with PTU. Image embryos at 1 day post fertilization (dpf; 28 hpf or later) or maintain embryos in PTU and image at 2 or 3 dpf.\n4. Mounting Embryos for In Vivo Imaging\nPrior to the day of the experiment, prepare the imaging chamber and embryo manipulation tool.\nPrepare the imaging chamber by carefully supergluing a plastic ring to the center of a 60 mm Petri dish.",
    "Optionally, prepare a custom-made embryo manipulator to move embryos within the dish and orient embryos while mounting. Construct the manipulator by supergluing a small length of nylon fishing line (~1/2 in, ~6 lb) to the end of a wooden cotton swab stick that has been cut to a ~4 in length.\nIf necessary (i.e., imaging at 2 dpf or earlier), before mounting the embryos dechorionate using syringes under a dissection microscope.\nAnesthetize zebrafish embryos.\nFill a 60 mm Petri dish halfway with E3 and add 5–6 drops of 4 mg/mL MS-222 Tricaine-S to a final concentration of ~0.2 mM. Swirl to mix.\nCAUTION: Tricaine should be handled with care and disposed of appropriately.\nTransfer embryos from the PTU to the tricaine solution, ensuring as little PTU is transferred as possible. While fish reflexes should cease after 1–2 min, leave the embryos in tricaine for up to 10 min to ensure thorough anesthetization for time-lapse imaging experiments.\nConfirm that the embryos are properly anesthetized. Assess the startle reflex by touching the embryo tails gently with the embryo manipulator. If a reflex movement is observed, add an additional drop of tricaine to the dish as far from the embryos as possible and swirl to mix. Observe the embryo heart rate under a dissection scope. If it is abnormally slow, add additional drops of E3 to the dish to reduce the tricaine concentration.\nMount anesthetized embryos in agarose.\nTransfer the fish to the center of plastic ring within the imaging chamber and remove as much excess E3 as possible using a fine-tipped transfer pipette.",
    "Using a clean transfer pipette, cover the fish with 1.0% low-melt agarose (LMA) in E3 stored at 42 °C and fill the entire plastic ring with a thin layer of agarose. Use a transfer pipette to gently pull the embryos up into the pipette tip and back into the agarose without introducing air bubbles.\nBefore the agarose hardens, quickly use an embryo manipulator to orient the fish appropriately. If imaging with an upright microscope, position the embryos as close to the upper surface of the agarose as possible. Position the embryos parallel to the bottom of the imaging chamber with the tail straight.\nNOTE: For hindbrain imaging, the embryos can be positioned in a dorsal or sagittal view. Care should be taken to ensure that the heads of the embryos do not sink while the agarose is still liquid. Other orientations may be appropriate to target other developing tissues for imaging. For inverted microscopes, mounting would be done differently, typically positioning the fish close to the bottom of a glass-bottomed Petri dish.\nWait for the agarose to harden, then fill the imaging chamber with E3. Add as much E3 as possible to account for the evaporation over the course of imaging.\n5. Time-lapse Confocal Imaging of Developing Zebrafish Hindbrain\nPlace the imaging chamber on the confocal microscope in preparation for the imaging.\nPlace the imaging chamber with the fish and E3 on the confocal microscope.\nSelect an objective with a high numerical aperture and a long working distance, such as a 20x water immersion objective (1.0 NA).\nFind a region with appropriately dense and bright labeling of the cell type(s) of interest.\nNOTE: A temperature-controlled stage/apparatus on the microscope may also be used to regulate temperature and humidity during long imaging sessions. This can decrease evaporation.",
    "Set up the acquisition parameters for Brainbow imaging.\nImage each FP channel sequentially. If using a commercial software (e.g., Zen software), this is done by preparing three “tracks”. Use an Argon laser to excite CFP at 458 nm and YFP at 514 nm. Use a DPSS 561 nm laser to excite dTomato. Collect emissions between 463–509 nm for CFP, 519–555 nm for YFP, and 566–691 nm for dTomato.\nFor on-screen display, code CFP as blue, YFP as yellow, and dTomato as red.\nNOTE: These settings will vary depending upon which laser lines and other features are available on the confocal microscope. To increase the speed of imaging, CFP and dTomato channels can be imaged simultaneously without appreciable bleed-through. If a separate FP is also being imaged, such as a far-red FP, this can be imaged sequentially or simultaneously with YFP.\nSet up the general imaging parameters to take 16-bit images with a resolution of at least 1024 x 1024 and averaging twice. Adjust the zoom depending on the region and cell type of interest (i.e., for hindbrain imaging with a 20x objective the zoom will range from 1.0–2.5). Maximize the field of view to allow for growth of the fish over time.\nViewing one track at a time (and turning off other lasers to prevent photobleaching), optimize the acquisition settings for each FP individually (e.g., laser power, pinhole size, photomultiplier tube gain, etc.).\nSelect Z-stack range to image.",
    "NOTE: For long imaging sessions (>2 h), take into consideration that the fish will continue to grow throughout the course of imaging, thus both the XY field and the Z-stack range should account for this with extra room. If imaging the hindbrain, include space in the field for the tissue to move rostrally during the imaging period. Space also needs to be included for growth in the Z dimension. Include in the image approximately 10–20 μm above the region of interest, whether the fish is positioned for sagittal or dorsal view.\nSet up parameters for time-lapse imaging.\nSelect a time interval. Interval length ranges between 10–30 min to track mitotic and apoptotic events in the developing hindbrain. Interval length will vary depending on the speed of the events of interest and the total time it takes to capture a single Z-stack.\nSelect the length of the imaging session. Time-lapse imaging sessions generally occur overnight and can last at least 16 h.\nRun the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The fish can be euthanized immediately following imaging or carefully dissected from the agarose using syringes and returned to E3 to recover. Recovered fish can then be imaged again at a later time point, though cell position and depth will shift during this period due to overall growth.\n6. Time-lapse File Management\nImport the image file into the analysis software.\nIf using Zen software, save the file in .czi format once image acquisition is completed. Make sure to save raw data in a format compatible with Fiji42 and/or other software.\nImport into Fiji software using BioFormats Importer.",
    "NOTE: Time-lapse files will be large and can require significant amounts of time and memory to open for analysis. Thus, it is helpful to be strategic in how they are saved and opened. It can be useful to save a lower-quality version that can be opened more easily to search for events of interest by eye.\nIf using Fiji, create smaller, more manageable subsets of time-lapse files. Generate subsets either by time (e.g., viewing full Z-stack at the first time point) or by depth (e.g., viewing the first 50 Z-sections at each time point) by clicking Image|Stacks|Tools|Make Substack.\n7. Quantitative Clonal Color Analysis of Brainbow Images\nMeasure the mean red, green, and blue (RGB) intensity values for the cells of interest in Fiji.\n\tNOTE: These instructions are specific to image analysis in Fiji. However, researchers may prefer to obtain mean RGB intensity values in an alternative software program.\n\t\nEnsure that the file is correctly cropped so that there is no black space around the edges of the image. Black space will artificially lower the minimal intensity measurements needed for the analysis. If the file does need to be cropped, select the Rectangle Selection Button and draw a region of interest (ROI) around the field of view, excluding all black space. Click Image|Crop.\nSet the measurement tool to take mean, minimum, and maximum gray value measurements. Click Analyze|Set Measurements. Ensure the checkboxes for Min & Max Gray Value and Mean Gray Value are both selected.",
    "Viewing the raw data files or subsetted Z-stacks in Fiji, find cells of interest for clonal color analysis. In the hindbrain, putative clones can be visually identified by their shared hue as well as their radial orientation. Do not select cells that are in close contact with, and thus difficult to resolve from, neighboring cells of another color. It may be difficult to quantify their hue.\nFind the center Z-plane of the cell of interest using the Z-scrollbar. Right-click the Oval Selection Button and select the Elliptical Selection Button. Other selection tools will be appropriate for different cell types. Draw an elliptical ROI around the central ~2/3 of the cell body.\nUsing the C-scrollbar, select the red (dTomato) channel. Take the mean intensity measurement for this channel by selecting Analyze|Measure. Repeat with the same ROI and focal plane for the green (YFP) and blue (CFP) channels and save all mean intensity values.\nClick anywhere on the image to remove the elliptical ROI in the cell of interest.\nTo measure background levels for normalization, use the C-scrollbar and select the red (dTomato) channel. Take the minimum intensity measurement for the whole field in this channel by selecting Analyze|Measure. Repeat with the same focal plane for the green (YFP) and blue (CFP) channels and save all minimum intensity values.\nCalculate relative RGB channel weights for the cells of interest.\n\tNOTE: Calculation of relative RGB channel weights from these intensity values can be performed in a variety of software programs, such as Microsoft Excel or R43.\n\t\nNormalize the mean intensity measurement of the cell ROI for each channel by subtracting the minimal intensity from the entire field in that channel and focal plane.\nSum the normalized mean RGB intensity values from each channel to find the total normalized RGB intensity for the cell.",
    "Calculate the relative channel weight for each channel by dividing the normalized mean intensity value for that channel by the total normalized RGB intensity.\nDisplay relative RGB channel weights as ternary plots using the Ternary package for R43,44. Ternary plots are useful to visualize the clustering of similar colors in 3D RGB space.\nCalculate the color spread coefficient to quantify the difference between cell colors.\nCalculate the Euclidean distance between the two colors in 3D RGB space using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60593/60593equ01.jpg\n\t\twhere R, G, and B are the relative RGB channel weights calculated in 7.2.\nFor ease of comprehension, normalize the color distance by dividing by √2, the maximum possible distance between colors, to obtain a color spread coefficient between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates exactly the same color and 1 indicates completely different colors (e.g., pure red and pure blue).\nSubscription Required.
