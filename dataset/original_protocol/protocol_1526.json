    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThe procedures described in this protocol can be conducted in a typical Class II biological hood using standard aseptic technique. Given their high clonogenicity and rapid proliferation, a single stem cell will yield more than 1 billion stem cells with 60–80 days in this system, which enables downstream applications in a timely manner (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Importantly, the intrinsic “immortality” of lung stem cell variants that renders their unlimited proliferative potential is not due to mutations of pRB, CDKN2A, p53, or any of a host of tumor suppressor or proto-oncogenes. Moreover, lung stem cell variants in this system retain their capacity of multipotent, lineage-specified differentiation despite continuous cultivation of more than one year.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/108-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of Lung Stem Cell Isolation and Characterization Protocol\nReviving 3T3-J2 Cells from Frozen Stock\nTiming: 4–5 days\nRetrieve cryovials from cell storage deep freezer and thaw the vial containing 106 cells/1 mL in 37°C water bath.\nGently transfer cells with 1 mL pipette into a 50 mL Falcon tube and add 30 mL culture medium drop by drop while swirling the tube slowly.\nAfter re-suspension, seed cells into a 150 mm tissue culture plate.\nGently shake the plates with cells in the hood to evenly distribute the cells and transfer the cells in an incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2.\nChange the medium the next day after thawing the frozen vial and then change medium every 2 days. In general, cells will be ready for passaging and expansion 3 days after thawing.",
    "Critical: Do not centrifuge to wash away DMSO. Change the medium the day after thawing the vial because the freezing medium contains DMSO that is harmful to cells. Passage the cells when they become 70∼80% confluent. If 3T3-J2 cells have grown past confluence, abandon them and thaw a new vial.\nExpanding 3T3-J2 Cells\nTiming: 1 day\nTransfer plates from the incubator and check the confluency and morphology of the 3T3-J2 cells under a microscope.\nMove the plate gently into a cleaned hood, remove the medium, wash the plate with 20 mL of DPBS to remove any serum, and add evenly 5 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the plate.\nIncubate the cells with trypsin in an incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2 for 5–6 min.\nAdd 10 mL of warmed 3T3-J2 culture medium to neutralize the trypsin. Pipette up and down 10 times to make a single-cell suspension.\nSpin down the cells at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet into 5 mL of fresh 3T3-J2 culture medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue.\nSeed 600,000–800,000 cells per plate in the amount of 20 mL 3T3-J2 culture medium, shake the plates to distribute the cells evenly and transfer the plates in the incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2.\nCritical: It is important to strictly follow the seeding cell numbers recommended here; either higher or lower seeding density will affect the quality of the 3T3-J2 cells.\nEvery 2–3 days after passaging change the medium by removing the medium from the plate and adding 20 mL of fresh, pre-warmed medium.\nIrradiating and Freezing Down 3T3-J2 Feeder Cells\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Repeat cell passaging procedure steps based on the need of cell number. Collect the cell pellets, resuspend the cells in 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 40 mL 3T3-J2 culture medium at the density less than 107 cells/mL and leave on ice before irradiation.\nIrradiate 3T3-J2 cells at 2,000 rad. We use X-ray irradiation machine (RadSource, RS1800, Cat No. 1087). 2,000 rad is calculated based on the irradiation standard to the machine.\nCritical: Although the irradiation and mitomycin-C (MC) treatment seem to be qualitatively equivalent, some studies suggest that irradiation is more suitable and efficient than MC treatment for the preparation of nonreplicating feeder cells. (Roy et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Fleischmann et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Llames et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). However, we have not directly compared these treatments in our laboratory so it remains unclear whether MC treatment is suitable to prepare feeder cells for lung stem cell cloning.\nAfter irradiation, put the container on the ice and immediately count viable cell numbers with a hemocytometer and Trypan blue.\nSpin down cells at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspend in freezing medium very gently to freeze down 1 × 107 cells/vial. Use 0.6 mL freezing medium per vial.\nCritical: 3T3-J2 cells are extremely fragile after irradiation. Thus, cells need to be handled with extreme care. Do not pipet up and down to mix the cells. Swirl the container of cells very gently for mixing.\nPut the cells in a Cool Cell Freezer box at −80°C for at least 24 hrs for gradual freezing. Transfer the frozen vials to a liquid nitrogen tank or deep freezer next day for long-term storage.\nPreparing Feeder for Stem Cell Culturing\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Revive and seed irradiated 3T3-J2 cells in the presence of 3T3 culture medium and shake the plates with cells to evenly distribute the cells (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for recommended cell numbers and culture medium volume) and transfer the plates in an incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_108_5.csv\nChange with 3T3-J2 culture medium next day.\nCloning Stem Cell Variants from Human Lung\nTiming: 10 days\nCritical: Fresh human normal or diseased lung tissue should be preserved in cold tissue processing buffer for short-term storage or shipping and be processed within 48 hrs for optimal yield. If lung tissues are properly minced and frozen in the presence of stem cell freezing medium, the lung stem cells can be derived from these frozen tissues at a later time. We have successfully derived cells from tissues that have been frozen for 2 years. There is no obvious difference in the yield of clonogenic cells among different sections of the lung. In this protocol we used distal lung tissue, but this protocol is also applicable to proximal lung tissue. The improper storage or insufficient digestion will lead to unsatisfying yield of healthy and clonogenic human cells in this system.\nWash 1 cm3 of distal lung tissue with 30 mL cold tissue processing buffer in 50 mL Falcon tube, centrifuge at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then carefully remove the medium without disturbing the tissue. Repeat the washing procedure three times.\nCarefully remove the tissue and put it into a 150 mm tissue culture dish. Mince the tissue between two feather scalpels until the tissue resembles a paste. The whole cutting process takes about 10–15 min.",
    "Critical: This mincing step is critical and will determine cloning efficiency. Thus, try to mince the tissue as thoroughly as possible. To keep the tissue from drying, add a few drops of tissue processing buffer during the process.\nDigest minced tissue in digestion buffer (10 mL digestion buffer per 1 cm3 lung tissue) for approximately 60 - 90 min in a 37°C rocker set to 150 rpm. Every 10 min, pipette the mixture up and down to break up any aggregated clumps.\nAfter digestion, add 20 mL cold tissue processing buffer to the tubes containing digested tissue. Then mix the contents by inverting the tubes ten times.\nAfter mixing, pipet the solutions through a 100 μm cell strainer and collect the pass-through suspension in a new 50 mL Falcon tube.\nAdd tissue processing buffer to this filtered cell suspension until the total volume is 45 mL, centrifuge at 300 g for 20 min at 4°C, remove the buffer carefully and repeat washing steps 6 more times at 300 g for 10 min.\nAfter the final wash, lyse the erythrocytes in the cell pellets by adding 5 mL ACK lysing buffer and incubating for 5 min at 20–22°C. Add 35 mL of tissue processing buffer and spin down at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C. Wash one more time with 10 mL cold neutralization medium.\nFollowing the last centrifugation, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of stem cell growth medium completely by pipetting up and down for ten times. Count the primary cells using hemocytometer. Seed the cells into the tissue culture dish pre-seeded with irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder cells (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for the seeding density of primary cells).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_108_6.csv\nChange stem cell growth medium every 2 days.",
    "Critical: Plates seeded with irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder cells need to be used within 5 days. Using the aged feeder plates will lead to the loss of stemness in these lung stem cell variants.\nPassaging Human Lung Stem Cell Variants\nTiming: 2–4 h\nWhen small and round lung stem cell colonies with relatively large nucleus and high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio are visible under the microscope (takes about 7–10 days, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), wash the plate with DPBS twice, add 1 mL TrypLE and incubate at 37°C in the incubator with 7.5% CO2 for 15 min. Check the cells once or twice and, if they are not totally dissociated, incubate another 5–10 min until cells are fully detached from the plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/108-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cloned Lung Stem Cells Are p63 Positive\nLeft: A representative bright field image of the lung stem cell clones generated from resected human distal lung tissue. The image was taken 7 days after dissociated lung epithelial cells were plated on 3T3-J2 feeder cells before being passaged, and p63+ stem cells were selectively formed colonies in this culture system. Scale bar, 100 μm. Right: A representative immunofluorescence image of the lung stem cell libraries stained with antibody to p63 showing uniform nuclear staining within each p63+ stem cell colony. These are dissociated lung epithelial stem cells after 7 days growth before being passaged. Scale bar, 100 μm. The p63 negative cells are the 3T3-J2 feeder cells.\nPipet the cells gently up and down 5–10 times to further dissociate them into single cells.\nAdd 2 mL warmed neutralizing medium quickly into the well-trypsinized cells and pipet up and down 20 times. Pipet the cells through a 30 μm pre-separation filter, centrifuge them at 300 g for 6 min at 4°C and then discard the supernatant.",
    "Critical: Do not add neutralization medium dropwise as cells will aggregate. Pipet vigorously to break down cell clusters into single cells.\nResuspend the cell pellets into 6 mL stem cell growth medium, count the cells, and seed them onto a plate that was pre-seeded with irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder cells (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for recommended seeding density).\nChange the medium every 2 days. In about 2–3 days, individual lung stem cell colonies will be observed. In about 4–6 days, the stem cell culture plate should be ready for passaging, freezing down, single-cell cloning or single-cell RNA sequencing.\nCritical: This system can support lung stem cell immaturity for at least 25 passages (250 days continuous propagation). We recommend performing single-cell cloning and single-cell RNA sequencing as early as possible, preferably at passage 2.\nEstablishing Single Stem Cell-Derived Pedigrees\nTiming: 6–8 weeks\nAfter 2 days post seeding at a density of 100,000 cells per well of 6-well plate, the stem cell clone library culture is approximately 60% confluent and each colony has about 50 cells. Trypsinize the stem cell clones following steps mentioned above, pipette the neutralized cells up and down to achieve a single-cell suspension, and pass them through a 30 μm pre-separation filter.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min and remove the 3T3-J2 feeder cells using QuadroMACS Starting Kit (LS) following manufacturer’s protocol. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL stem cell growth medium.\nUse a cell sorter to sort single cells to individual wells of a 384-well plate previously seeded with feeder cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/108-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of Generating Single-Cell-Derived Pedigrees of Lung Stem Cells\nSingle cells are sorted into each well of 384-well plate and majority of them can be expanded to unique pedigrees.",
    "Change medium every 3–5 days. It will take around 7–10 days to observe colonies in many wells of the plate.\nTwo weeks after plating, gently wash the wells having colonies with 75 μL DPBS twice, add 30 μL TrypLE, incubate for 15 min or even longer in the incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2.\nCritical: Check each well during trypsinization and make sure that all colonies are completely dissociated before neutralizing.\nGently pipet up and down 5 times for each well. Neutralize the TrypLE by adding 50 μL warmed stem cell growth medium quickly into each well and pipet up and down another 10 times to dissociate colonies.\nCritical: Change tips for each well and pipet carefully to avoid aerosols and cross-contamination.\nFor each well of dissociated cells, transfer the cell suspension into one well of 24-well plate each that has been seeded with feeder cells. Each well will be marked as a single-cell-derived clone and can be expanded into billions of cells in a few weeks.\nCharacterization of Individual Clones In Vitro\nTiming: 4–5 weeks\nExpansion of individual stem cell clones for molecular genetics and functional analyses in vitro (air-liquid interface, ALI) and in vivo (xenografts) is essential to deconstruct the heterogeneity among the epithelial stem cells of the lung and airways. Growing individual clones at ALI allows assessment of the in vitro differentiation potential of each clone.\nExpand individual clones in one well of a 6-well plate pre-seeded with feeder cells. Aspirate the culture medium, rinse with DPBS thoroughly, and add 1 mL TrypLETM Express Enzyme (1×) for 10–20 min in the incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2.",
    "Pipette up and down 5–10 times. Neutralize with 2 mL stem cell neutralizing medium, vigorously pipette up and down and pass through a 30 μm pre-separation filter to achieve a single-cell suspension. Remove mouse feeder cells using QuadroMACS Starting Kit.\nCount the cells and seed 200,000–300,000 cells in 200 μL complete Stem Cell growth medium per well of a 24-well Transwell insert. Add 700 μL complete stem cell growth medium into the lower chamber of the insert.\nIncubate the Transwell insert in a 37°C incubator with 7.5% CO2 for 3–4 days until confluency, and change medium of both upper and lower chambers every other day.\nAt confluency, remove the medium of the upper chamber of the insert by carefully pipetting to create ALI culture. Change the medium of the lower chamber into PneumaCult-ALI Media, and keep for an additional 21 days in the incubator at 37°C with 7.5% CO2 to induce complete differentiation.\nCharacterization of Individual Clones In Vivo\nTiming: 4–5 weeks\nTo assess the pathogenic potential of the lung epithelial clones, such as neutrophilic inflammation and fibrosis, subcutaneous transplantation of them into highly immunodeficient NSG (NODscidIL2ranull) is performed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). A detailed phenotypic and molecular characterization of the stem cell variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for instance, has been presented (Rao et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/108-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Work Flow of Subcutaneous Transplantation of Lung Stem Cells in NSG Mice\nLung stem cells in colonies (scale bar, 100 μm) are trypsinized to single cells, mixed with Matrigel and subcutaneously transplanted into appropriately anesthetized 8-week-old male or female NSG mice. At 3 weeks post-transplant, mice are euthanized by CO2 and the xenograft nodules harvested (scale bar, 1 cm), embedded, and analyzed by H&E staining (scale bar, 100 μm).",
    "Expand individual clone in three wells of a 6-well plate pre-seeded with feeder cells.\nAt 4 to 5 days post seeding, the stem cells in each well should reach 90% confluency in a 6-well plate. Trypsinize and collect the cell pellets following the same procedure as described above.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 50 μL serum-free F12 medium and keep the suspension on ice.\nMix approximately 1 × 106 lung stem cells with 50 μL (1:1) growth factor-reduced Matrigel, and subcutaneously inject the cells into the back of 8- to 10-week-old NSG mice of either sex following inhalation anesthetic using isoflurane gas (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: In this step, both cell suspensions and GFR Matrigel should be kept on ice before injection. It is absolutely essential to use growth factor-reduced Matrigel as non-reduced contains factors that might affect complete differentiation of the cells. The differentiation fates of these clones in xenografts have been proved to be remarkably stable to 250 days of continuous propagation in vitro, suggesting that the passages of these clones will unlikely affect the outcome of the xenograft experiment.\nClearly label the exact spots where cells were injected with a permanent marker.\n3 weeks after the injection, euthanize the mice, collect nodules, and fix them in 4% PFA for 24 hrs at 4°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nProcess the nodules as a small tissue sample in a tissue processor, embed in paraffin blocks, cut sections, and characterize the histology using recommended antibodies.\nCritical: It is important to keep the xenografts in the mice for at least 3 weeks before collecting to allow the stem cells to differentiate properly.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1.
