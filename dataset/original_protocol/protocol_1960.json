    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse cardiomyocyte isolation and preparation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nNote: Preheat the water bath (Model 9105, Fisher Scientific, USA) of the Langendorff apparatus to 37°C. Start the Perfusion solution flow to be sure the perfusion system of the Langendorff apparatus is prefilled by Perfusion solution, and avoid any air trapped in the perfusion system.\nMouse anesthesia. Inject 80 mg/kg of ketamine and 5 mg/kg of xylazine to adult mice (both male and female, 12–16 weeks) intraperitoneally. Assess level of anesthesia by firm toe pinch, and proceed when the surgical anesthesia plane is reached.\nInject 300 USP unit sodium heparin intraperitoneally.\nPerform a midline thoracotomy and heart excision.\nTransfer the heart to a petri dish containing Perfusion solution.\nTrim the connective tissues using a fine scissor.\nCannulate the heart through aorta (approximately 5 mm length) onto a Langendorff apparatus prefilled with Perfusion solution, and avoid aortic valve damage during cannulation.\nStart the electrical perfusion pump (Peri-Star Pro, World Precision Instruments, USA) with lower flow rate to start the perfusion with the Perfusion solution at 37°C.\nRead the pressure value on the pressure monitor (BP-1, World Precision Instruments, USA) which is connected with the Langendorff apparatus. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A shows the experimental setup.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1558-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Langendorff perfusion system for cardiomyocyte isolation and the perfused heart\n(A) Langendorff apparatus and experimental setup used for heart perfusion and digestion.\n(B) The heart images before digestion (Initial) and after digestion (Final). Scale bar: 2 mm.\nMonitor the perfusion pressure increasing to a steady value. At the same time, monitor the dripping of the Perfusion solution from the apex of the heart. If the pressure keeps increasing and no dripping of the solution from the heart, there must be aortic valve damages suggesting the failure of the retrograde perfusion.",
    "Washout the blood by perfusion for 3 min, adjust the perfusion speed at a flow rate about 4–6 mL/min and control the initial pressure at ≈60 mmHg using pressure monitor. Switch the perfusion solution to Perfusion solution containing collagenase type II (1 mg/mL) for digestion of the tissue.\nContinuous monitoring of the declining perfusion pressure for 15–20 min during tissue digestion by collagenase type II, until the pressure is below 30 mmHg. Check the color of the heart surface, and the softness of heart tissue to determine the digestion level. The digested heart becomes soft and dilated (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]-Before digestion and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]-After digestion), and the surface color tone changes to yellowish as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nRemove the heart from the perfusion apparatus and transfer to a petri dish containing Stop solution. Dissect and separate ventricles and atria, mince and pipette in the solution to mechanically dissociate the tissue and liberate individual ventricular and atrial myocytes.\nHarvest single isolated cardiomyocytes.\nFilter the solution with cells through nylon mesh cell strainer (100 μm), and collect the cells in 15 mL tubes waiting for the settling of the cells to the bottom of tubes (5–10 min).\nRemove the supernatant carefully not disturbing the cell pellets.\nRestore concentration of Ca2+ stepwise by adding 5 mL Ca2+ restoration solution containing 0.2, 0.5, or 1 mM Ca2+.\nResuspend the cell pellet after adding the restoration solution, and incubate the cell at 37°C water bath for 10–15 min.\nRepeat step c followed by removing of the supernatant.\nStore the cell in Ca2+ restoration solution containing 1 mM Ca2+ at a temperature between 21°C and 22°C for recording.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1558-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The unhealthy and dead ventricular myocytes in the left panel were indicated, and the right panel showed the healthy ventricular myocytes.\n(B) Representative images of a single ventricular myocyte selected for experiment with rod shape, sharp edges, and clear striations.\nNote: The cardiomyocytes in the solution can be stored for 4–6 h. Assess the cell viability by the morphological changes and the contractility of the cell in response to electrical stimulations. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] showed the images of isolated cells. The healthy cells show clear striations with rod shape, sharp-edged instead of blunt-edged, and contract with normal fractional shortening (6%–12% at a temperature between 21°C and 22°C with a pacing rate of 0.5 Hz) in response to electrical stimulations.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. The softness and the surface of the mouse heart before the collagenase digestion, related to step 8\nA flat board tip forceps was used to touch the heart surface to test the softness of the heart tissue. The surface color tone of the heart is pinkish before digestion, and the heart tissue is intact with higher tension.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. The softness and the surface of the mouse heart after the collagenase digestion, related to step 8\nA flat board tip forceps was used to touch the heart surface to test the softness of the heart tissue. The surface color tone of the heart turned to yellowish after digestion, and the heart tissue became soft and dilated with lower tension.\nIntracellular pH and sarcomere length measurement in cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 4–6 h\nRecording system setup. A diagram of the recording system is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1558-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Diagram of the IonOptix recording system configured for measuring the sarcomere contraction and intracellular pH\nCreated with Biorender.com[href=http://Biorender.com].\nInstall a piece of 25 × 25 mm No. 1 micro cover glass (VWR International, PA, USA) to the FHD Microscope Chamber (IonOptix, MA, USA), and place and clip the chamber on the stage of the inverted microscope. Glass-bottom dishes are not appropriate for the recording because of the lack of the stimulation electrodes, and the large solution volume in the dish which reduces solution exchange speed.\nConnect the temperature-controlled gravity-driven perfusion system and the Myopacer Cell Stimulator (IonOptix, MA, USA) to the recording chamber. Set and test the solution flow rate at 4–5 mL/min. Test and monitor the temperature of the recording solution in the chamber (36°C–37°C for physiological temperature or 21°C–22°C for room temperature) during the perfusion by pre-setting the temperature for the in-line solution heater.\nInstall the emission filter cube for pHrodo Green or SNARF-1 imaging on the Cell Framing Adapter, and choose the excitation filters by rotating and positioning the filter wheel on the microscope.\nTurn on the power of the microscope, the IonOptix system, Myopacer Cell Stimulator and the computer. Run IonWizard software (IonOptix, MA, USA).\nDye loading into cardiomyocytes.\nMethod A: Incubate cardiomyocytes in a 1.5 or 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing HEPES-buffered Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution with addition of either 5 μM SNARF-1 AM or 5 μM pHrodo Green for 5 min at a temperature between 21°C and 22°C. After removing the loading solution, cardiomyocytes are washed twice using HEPES-buffered Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution and resuspended the cells.",
    "Method B: Seed cardiomyocytes in the recording chamber with an appropriate density to identify single cells, and wait for 5 min for the cells to settle and attach to the cover glass. The cell yield from each isolation may vary depending on the isolation. Add the cells to recording chamber by an incremental step for achieving the appropriate density as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A right panel. Wash-in Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution containing either 5 μM SNARF-1 AM or 5 μM pHrodo Green, and incubate for 2–3 min, and wash-out the remaining solution using HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution gassed by 5% CO2 and 95% O2. Method A and Method B both work well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1558-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Time-dependent pHrodo Green loading into cardiomyocytes\nFor labeling of mitochondria, incubate cardiomyocytes in Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) solution (5 nM) for 30 min at 37°C, and the TMRM solution is made by HEPES-buffered Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution. TMRM (red color) accumulates in active mitochondria with intact membrane potentials. After washout of TMRM loading solution by HEPES-buffered Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution, incubate the cells in pHrodo Green (green color) loading solution for 5, 10 and 30 min. The images were taken by using Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope at the time point as indicated on the top of the images.\n(A) pHrodo Green images from a TMRM- and pHrodo Green-loaded cardiomyocyte. The strong background green color results from the pHrodo Green dye in the loading solution. For testing the time-dependent dye loading on the same cardiomyocyte, we did not washout the dye solution during the imaging, which generated strong background green dye signals.\n(B) Merged images of TMRM and pHrodo Green from the cardiomyocyte loaded with both dyes.",
    "At 5 min, pHrodo Green dye is loaded into cytosol (A) indicated by the relatively weaker green signal (comparing to strong background signal from pHrodo dye loading solution and the green signal from 30 min loading), but the integrated weak pHrodo Green signal from the whole cell can be easily detected and recorded using PMT of IonOptix system in the recording solutions without any dyes. The merged image (B) at 5 min shows strong red TMRM signal further demonstrating the pHrodo Green dye is loaded into cytosol instead of mitochondria. With time going, more pHrodo Green dye is loaded into the cytosol and mitochondria. The yellow color regions in merged image at 30 min indicate the significant loading of pHrodo Green into the mitochondria.\nNote: Timings of dye loading by Method A need to be well controlled due to removing and wash-out of the dye solution may take some extra time, but this method needs less volume of dye loading solution which is cost-effective. Dye loading by Method B takes less time, but needs large amount of dye solution which is costly, and the perfusion tube of the dye solution needs to be washed very well to keep the tube clean for next usage.",
    "Critical: The loading time should be carefully controlled to ensure the dye is loaded in the cytosol without overloading into the intracellular organelles. The loading time should be brief, usually, 5 min are enough. Reduction of the dye concentrations could also help to limit dye loading into the intracellular organelles. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows the time-dependent dye loading process. Because mitochondria occupy at least 30% of cell volume, we compare the dye loading to the cytosol and mitochondria. 5 min loading of pHrodo Green shows the dye signal mostly in cytosol, while 30 min loading of pHrodo Green shows both cytosol and mitochondrial dye distribution. To quantitatively estimate the cytosol dye loading, use saponin solution (50 μg/mL) to perfuse the cell for monitoring the dye intensity changes and evaluating the percentage of the dye loaded in the cytosol. Cardiomyocytes’ attachment to the cover glass is difficult to achieve depending on the quality control of the cardiomyocyte isolation and post-isolation incubation time as we showed in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. If cardiomyocytes do not adhere well to the cover glass surface due to the cover glass surface quality alterations from different brands, the cover glass will be pre-treated with 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-Lysine solution for 30 min. Poly-D-Lysine could also be used for cover glass coating, and the difference is that poly-L-Lysine is the biologically active form of lysine, and can be degraded by protease in cell culture. Other reagents such as laminin and fibronectin could also be used for coating the cover glass.",
    "If the cells are loaded by Method A, seed the dye-loaded cardiomyocytes on the cover glass of the recording chamber, and be sure the cell density is appropriate to identify individual cells as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A right panel. If the cells are loaded by Method B, skip the cell seeding procedure. Perfuse the cells with a gravity-driven solution perfusion system. The perfusion speed is kept at 4–5 mL/min.\nCritical: To control the temperature and solution exchange, the perfusion tube diameters and the flow speed need to be well controlled and pre-tested.\nCell selection. Illuminate the cells using bright field light, and check the cell quality under the microscope. Select 63× oil or 40× oil lens for imaging. Apply a continuous square bipolar pulse stimulation with a 2 ms pulse-width and 10 V amplitude at a frequency of 0.5 Hz using Myopacer Cell Stimulator, check the beating status of cardiomyocytes and identify beating and healthy cardiomyocytes for pH recording. Stop the stimulation and pacing.\nCell positioning. Select a single cardiomyocyte, move to the center of the illumination field and rotate the handle on the Cell Framing Adapter to align the cell in a horizontal position. Move the cell to the imaging frame. Adjust the four edge positions of the frame to include the whole relaxed cell completely in the frame for imaging. Switch the bright field illumination filter to the red filter position, and switch the light path to the camera, via the side port of the microscope.",
    "Recording using the IonWizard software by starting a new experiment. Choose the experimental setting for pH measurement which uses the hardware configured in the task manager of the software including the excitation wavelength and the calibration parameters for the lens. Finely adjust the focus on the microscope to see clearly the striation structure of the cardiomyocyte on the screen as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\npH calibration. Perfuse the cardiomyocyte by pH calibration solutions with pH 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 or 8.5 sequentially. For each step, recording the fluorescence signal of pHrodo green or SNARF-1 for 3–5 min till the signal reaches steady state. Repeat the calibration by reversing the solution sequence, i.e., perfuse the cardiomyocyte by pH calibration solutions with pH 8.5, 7.5, 6.5 or 5.5 sequentially. Repeat the calibration process by randomly choosing the sequence of calibration solutions. At the final step, move the cell out of the imaging frame and record the background fluorescent signal. Combined and average all the data from different cells.\nTest the photobleaching and dye leakage. Record fluorescent signals of pHrodo Green or SNARF-1 continuously from single cardiomyocyte without any interventions for ∼10 min with pacing and without pacing. At the final step, move the cell out of the imaging frame and record the background fluorescent signal.\nTest the dye loading efficiency and specificity. Record fluorescent signals of pHrodo Green or SNARF-1 continuously from single cardiomyocyte for 2–3 min with continuous perfusion of HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution, and switch the perfusion solution to HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution containing 50 μg/mL saponin. Monitor the fluorescent signal changes after saponin treatment.",
    "Measurement of the intrinsic fluorescent signal of cardiomyocytes. Seed the non-loaded dye-free cardiomyocytes on the cover glass and choose single live cardiomyocyte for 3 min recording using the optics for pHrodo Green and SNARF-1. Repeat the measurement across cardiomyocytes with different sizes and shapes. At the final step, move the cell out of the imaging frame and record the background fluorescent signal. For dye-loaded cells, repeat this step to obtain the dye-induced fluorescent signal. The measurement will be repeated on 30–50 cells for calculation of the averaged values.\nDynamic pHi recording.\nChoose single healthy dye-loaded cardiomyocyte for pHi imaging and measurement. Repeat steps 15–17. Finely adjust the focus on the microscope to see clear striation structures of the cardiomyocyte on the screen.\nAdjust the size of the sarcomere selection window to cover at least 10 sarcomeres and move the window to the center of the cell. Set the solution temperature control, start pacing the cell, and record the fluorescent signals of pHrodo Green or SNARF-1 and the sarcomere length simultaneously. For each pHrodo Green loaded cardiomyocyte, complete pHi recordings by perfusion using pH 5.5 calibration solution to acquire the peak fluorescence intensity value for normalization and proper calibration.\nChange the pacing rates if necessary using Myopacer Cell Stimulator.\nFor each recording, at the final step, move the cell out of the imaging frame and record the background fluorescent signal.",
    "Pharmacological interventions. To test the effects of drugs and chemicals on the pHi, we use bath solutions containing different drugs or chemicals to perfuse the cardiomyocyte for 3–5 min, record the pHi till steady state is achieved and switch to control solution. For example, we test the effects of blebbistatin by switching the perfusion solution from HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution to HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution containing 25 μM blebbistatin, and we test the FCCP effects by switching the perfusion solution from HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution to HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution containing 4 μM FCCP. After the recordings achieve steady state, we switch the perfusion solution back to HCO3--buffered Tyrode’s solution to observe the washout effects. After the drug test, remove the cells which have been exposed to the drug in the recording chamber and add fresh cells for loading and start another new test.\nAnalyses of data with proper calibrations and corrections\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nUse IonWizard, Origin Pro 2021 (OriginLab, Northampton MA, USA) and GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) to analyze the pHi data.\nEstimate and eliminate the intrinsic fluorescent signal of cardiomyocytes.\nObtain the intrinsic fluorescent signal from each cell by subtracting the background fluorescent signal from the recorded raw intrinsic fluorescence signal. Average the intrinsic fluorescent signals from 30-50 different cells as an index of the intrinsic fluorescence intensity.\nObtain the dye-induced fluorescent signal from 30-50 dye-loaded cells by subtracting the background fluorescent signal from the raw fluorescent signal. Average the fluorescent signals from dye-loaded cells as an index of the dye-induced fluorescence intensity.",
    "Calculate the ratios between the intrinsic fluorescence intensity and the dye-induced fluorescence intensity. Use the ratios to calculate the component of the intrinsic fluorescent signal in the total fluorescent signal recorded in dye-loaded cells and subtract this component from the total fluorescent signal in dye-loaded cells in all other experiments.\nCorrections of the photobleaching and dye leakage.\nSubtract the background fluorescent signal and eliminate the intrinsic fluorescent signal.\nFit the photobleaching and dye leakage process of the fluorescent signal using a linear equation.\nUsing the slope resulting from the linear fitting to correct all the pH measurements to minimize the effects of photobleaching and dye leakage by subtracting the slope factor.\nNote: For cardiomyocytes with pacing and without pacing, perform the analysis independently. Compare the slope factors to rule out the effects of electrical and mechanical activities of cardiomyocytes on the photobleaching and dye leakage process. Temperature is another important factor in photobleaching and dye leakage, therefore, correct the experimental data at 21°C–22°C and 36°C using the slope factors from 21°C–22°C and 36°C, respectively.\npH calibrations.\nSubtract the background fluorescent signal, eliminate the intrinsic fluorescent signal, and correct the photobleaching and dye leakage.\nConvert the SNARF-1 emission ratio (F580/F640) to a pHi value using the standard calibration method (Blank et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Buckler and Vaughan-Jones, 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Niederer et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Sirish et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) to obtain the calibration curve.\nFor pHrodo Green, normalize the fluorescence intensity signals by the peak intensity at pH 5.5, and fit the normalized intensities using a sigmoidal function to obtain the standard calibration curve for pHrodo Green.\nConvert the fluorescent signals to pH values.\nSubtract the background fluorescent signal, eliminate the intrinsic fluorescent signal, and correct the photobleaching and dye leakage.",
    "Perform the curve fitting to obtain the kinetic parameters using the “Operations/Monotonic Transient Analysis…” menu in IonWizard software.\nAverage 10 cycles of the signals and convert the fluorescent signals to pH using the calibration curves obtained in step 27.
