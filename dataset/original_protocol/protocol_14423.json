    "All experimental protocols presented below were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Tokyo Women's Medical University School of Medicine and abided by all requirements of the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments.\n1. Preparation of Animals, Instruments, Culture Media, and Dishes\nPrepare complete culture medium using minimum essential medium alpha containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Store this for several months at 4 °C until use.\nUse adult male ZDF rats as a type 2 diabetic obesity model. Use the fat pad of male Lewis rats to isolate adipose tissue to prepare the cell sheets.\n2. Isolation and Culture of rASCs\nObtain adipose tissue from Lewis rats (8 - 33 weeks old, male) under general anesthesia using isoflurane.\nPrepare a rodent mechanical ventilator and 4% isoflurane. Prepare several sterile cotton tips, clean gauzes, a scalpel, a needle holder, operating scissors, a pair of forceps, and a 5-0 nylon suture. Sterilize the surgical instruments and supplies.\nPrepare a 100-mm Petri dish with 10 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to temporarily preserve the obtained adipose tissue. Weigh the Petri dish with PBS using a balance before starting surgery to measure the collected adipose tissue. Lay out the surgical instruments and supplies on a sterile drape.\nAnesthetize the rats by using isoflurane at 3 - 4% via a rodent mechanical ventilator and maintain the rats at 2 - 3% isoflurane during surgery. Monitor the depth of anesthesia by observing the depth and rate of respiration of each rat.\nWhile wearing sterile gloves, position the rat in a supine position on a sterile drape. Shave the operative area with an electric razor and clean the abdominal section of the rat using sterile gauze soaked in 70% ethanol.",
    "Create an approximately 5 cm-long skin incision with a scalpel in the lateral lower abdomen of the rat. Expose and dissect the external oblique muscle. Then, expose the epididymal adipose tissue surrounding the epididymis. Gently pull the epididymal adipose tissue out.\n\t\tNOTE: The adipose tissue can be obtained on either side of the rat's abdomen.\nExcise only the epididymal adipose tissue, avoiding damage to the epididymis, testis, and epididymal blood vessels (Figure S1). Soak the excised adipose tissue in the PBS in the Petri dish to prevent dryness and weigh the tissue.\nClose the abdominal muscle with 5-0 VICRYL and the skin with a 5-0 nylon suture. Then, return each rat that has undergone surgery to a separate cage (one rat per cage).\n\t\tNOTE: Monitor the rats until they fully recover.\nIsolate rASCs from 2 - 3 g of adipose tissue (excised from a Lewis rat and processed according to a previously-reported method)27. Briefly, enzymatically digest the excised adipose tissue with 0.1% type A collagenase at 37 °C for 1 h to obtain the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF; Figure S2).\nPrepare several 100-µm cell strainers, several 50-mL tubes, several 15 mL tubes, and two scalpels on a biological clean bench. Turn on a centrifuge and warm up a water bath to 37 °C. In addition, prepare approximately 50 mL of sterile PBS in a 50 mL tube with 0.1% (final concentration) of type A collagenase.\nMince the adipose tissue into small pieces using two scalpels.\nMove all minced adipose tissue to a 50-mL tube and add PBS to bring the total volume to 15 mL.\nRest the 50-mL tube upright for 5 min. Discard the upper layer and collect the lower layer except for the debris.",
    "Add 0.1% of type A collagenase solution to the 50-mL tube with PBS containing the upper layer in order to enzymatically digest the adipose tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: Warm approximately 20 mL of PBS per 2 - 3 g of adipose tissue in a 37 °C water bath.\nTilt and shake the 50 mL tube gently at 120 - 130 rpm for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath.\nRest the 50 mL tube upright for 5 min after shaking.\nFilter the solution using a 100 µm cell strainer and pour the solution into a new 50 mL tube. Dispense the filtered solution into two 15 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the solution in the 15 mL tubes for 5 min at 700 x g. Carefully remove the upper layer of supernatant and leave 5 mL of the lower layer of the solution. Do not aspirate the pellet.\nAdd approximately 5 mL of complete culture medium to each 15 mL tube, up to 10 mL per 15 mL tube, and carefully re-suspend the pellet.\nRepeat steps 2.2.8 - 2.2.9. Then, obtain the SVF.\nPrepare two 60 cm2 culture dishes. Collect the SVF after two centrifugations at 700 × g for 5 min. Suspend the SVF and plate 10 mL of SVF solution on each 60-cm2 culture dish.\nCulture the dishes for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nPrepare PBS and 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), storable for several months at 4 °C until use.\nAfter initial plating (24 h), wash the cells with PBS 3 times to remove unattached cells and debris. Add fresh complete medium.\nPassage the cells that are nearly sub-confluent on day 3. Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3 - 5 min.",
    "NOTE: Complete the trypsinization step within 10 min to prevent cell damage.\nObserve the cells under a light microscope after trypsinization to confirm that all the cells have thoroughly detached from the dishes. Then, add 9 mL of complete culture medium to the dishes.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer.\nSubculture the cells at a density of 1.7 x 103 cells/cm2 every 3 days until passage 3. Culture the subcultured cells at 37 °C in the humidified atmosphere of a 5% CO2 incubator.\n3. Creation of rASC Sheets\nPrepare several 35-mm diameter temperature-responsive culture dishes. Pre-coat the dishes with FBS (or complete medium containing FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for more than 1 h.\n\tNOTE: A 35 mm diameter temperature-responsive culture dish is a commercially available product.\nPrepare a thermo-plate and incubate at 37 °C for the following experimental procedures.\n\tNOTE: Perform every procedure using temperature-responsive culture dishes on a 37 °C thermo-plate to prevent the cells from spontaneously detaching from the dish.\n\t\nWarm the complete culture medium used in the procedures to 37 °C prior to experimentation.\nSeed passage 3 rASCs derived from Lewis rats onto a 35 mm diameter temperature-responsive culture dish at a density of 1.5 x 105 cells/dish for 3 days using a 2 mL total volume of complete culture medium.\n\t\tNOTE: When rASCs are plated onto a new culture dish, the dish should be slowly rocked back and forth and left and right in an incubator to achieve uniform rASC seeding and a uniformly thick rASC sheet.\nChange 2 mL of the medium to 2 mL of complete culture medium containing 16.4 µg/mL L-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt n-hydrate (AA) on day 3 after seeding to the temperature-responsive culture dishes incubated on a 37 °C thermo-plate.",
    "NOTE: Dissolved AA can be stored at -30 °C for months.\nCulture the cells for an additional 4 - 5 days and replace the medium every 2 days with fresh medium containing AA.\nConfirm the proliferation and generation of ASCs under a light microscope to determine whether gaps occurred between the cells in a contiguous cell sheet.\nTransfer the cell sheets from the incubator to the benchtop for 15 - 20 min to cool them to room temperature.; observe the cells spontaneously detach as a contiguous cell sheet. Harvest the rASC sheet from the dish surface with a pair of forceps.\n\tNOTE: Usually, rASC sheets can be handled with a pair of forceps. If necessary, a transfer membrane can be used to transfer a cell sheet from the culture dish to the wound site if the cell sheet is brittle and fragile.\n4. Preparation of the Full-thickness Skin Defect Wound Model and Transplantation of rASC Sheets\nPrepare a rodent mechanical ventilator and 4% isoflurane. Prepare several sterile cotton tips, clean gauze, 5-0 nylon suture, a scalpel, a periosteal raspatory, a needle holder, operating scissors, and a pair of forceps. Sterilize the surgical instruments and supplies. Lay out the surgical instruments and supplies on a sterile drape.\nPrepare PBS and maintain it at room temperature, along with some artificial skin and a non-adhesive dressing. Precut the artificial skin (15 x 10 mm) and non-adhesive dressing (20 × 15 mm). Soak the inner collagen sponge layer of the artificial skin in saline before using the artificial skin.\n\tNOTE: The artificial skin is made of two layers: an outer silicone sheet layer and an inner collagen sponge.\nUse ZDF rats (16 - 18 weeks old, male, 500 - 600 g) as a wound-healing model for type 2 diabetes and obesity.",
    "Anesthetize the ZDF rats by inhalation of 4% isoflurane using a rodent mechanical ventilator. Induce anesthesia by using isoflurane at 4 - 5% via a rodent mechanical ventilator and maintain it at 3 - 4% during surgery. Monitor the depth of anesthesia by observing the depth and rate of respiration of each rat via a toe pinch.\nWhile wearing sterile gloves, position the rat in the prone position on a sterile drape. Clean the head of the rat using sterile gauze soaked in 70% ethanol, shave the operative area with an electric razor, and clean the skin after shaving using sterile gauze soaked in 70% ethanol.\nCreate a squared full-thickness skin defect (15 x 10 mm2) on the head of the anesthetized ZDF rats by removing the cutaneous tissue from the epidermis to the periosteum. Excise the skin and cutaneous tissue with a scalpel and remove the periosteum with a periosteal raspatory.\nMove the rASCs on the 35 mm temperature-responsive culture dish from the incubator to a room-temperature environment immediately prior to transplantation.\nObserve the rASCs on the 35 mm temperature-responsive culture dish spontaneously detach as a sheet from the dish surface after the formation of a wound. Harvest the rASC sheets after 7 days of culturing on temperature-responsive culture dishes. Remove the cultured medium and wash the rASC sheet with PBS three times. Soak the rASC sheet in PBS until transplantation to prevent desiccation.\nPlace the rASC sheet immediately over the skull defect using a pair of forceps. If the cell sheet is brittle and fragile, a membrane can be used as a scaffold for transferring the cell sheet from the culture dish to the wound site.",
    "Cover the rASC sheet and defect with the artificial skin (15 x 10 mm2) and close the wound with approximately 10 stiches using the 5-0 nylon suture. To protect the wound, place a non-adhesive dressing (20 x 15 mm2) over the artificial skin, using 5-0 nylon sutures to keep the wound environment moist and to absorb exudates.\n\tNOTE: The non-adhesive dressings will be removed by the ZDF rats within a few days after application. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly monitor the rats after transplantation. Usually, the non-adhesive dressing is replaced every 2 days under general anesthesia.\nReturn each rat that has undergone surgery to a separate cage until they have fully recovered (one rat per cage). After an observation period, euthanize the rats using the approved method of isoflurane overdose.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
