    "1. Set up in vitro panel of constructs\nNOTE: This step will vary depending on the specific protein to be analyzed.\nPrepare aliquots of virus for depletion and expression constructs as necessary.\n\t\nSeed a 10 cm tissue culture dish with 3-5 x 106 HEK293-EBNA or HEK293T cells for each construct needed for viral transduction. Let cells adhere overnight in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (P/S/Q), and 0.3 mg/mL G418.\n\t\tNOTE: HEK293-EBNA and HEK293T cells are recommended for viral production because they are easy to grow, have high transfection efficiency, and efficiently express recombinant proteins from episomal plasmids. The cells should be between 50-70% confluent the day of transfection.\nPrepare a transfection mix for each viral transduction construct. Combine 2 mL of reduced serum media with 90 µL of transfection reagent.\n\t\tNOTE: Pre-warming reduced serum media is recommended.\nAdd 10 µg each of a viral packaging plasmid (e.g., gag-pol), viral envelope plasmid (e.g., VSV-G), and one of either CRISPR-based depletion, shRNA-based depletion, or cDNA expression construct (e.g., pMKO or pMSCV) to the transfection mix. Mix well by gentle pipetting.\nLet the transfection mix sit for 20 min at room temperature. Remove HEK293-EBNA growth media from tissue culture dishes and add 3 mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, P/S/Q, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate. To each dish, add 2 mL of transfection mix dropwise. Let cells sit in transfection media overnight in an incubator at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2.\nThe following morning add 20 mL of DMEM media with 10% FBS, P/S/Q supplementation, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate. Incubate the cells in it at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2 for overnight.",
    "The next morning, replace media with 5 mL viral collection media (VCM) (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, P/S/Q, and 20 mM HEPES).\nAfter 4 h, collect VCM from plates and store in a 50 mL conical tube on ice at 4 °C. Replace with 5 mL of fresh VCM.\nAfter 4 h, collect VCM from plates in same 50 mL conical tube and store on ice at 4 °C. Replace with 8 mL of fresh VCM for overnight collection.\nIn the morning collect VCM from plates and store in the 50 mL conical tube on ice at 4 °C. Replace with 5 mL of fresh VCM.\nAfter 4 h, collect VCM from plates and store in the 50 mL conical tube on ice at 4°C. Replace with 5 mL of fresh VCM. After 4 h, collect VCM from plates and add to the 50 mL conical tube.\nAliquot collections from 50 mL tube into cryotubes (2 mL per aliquot) after filtration through a 0.45 µm filter. Store viral aliquots at -80 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here, and the viral aliquots can be stored until ready for use.\nSeed cells at the appropriate density in a 10 cm tissue culture dish. Target 50% confluence. Let cells adhere overnight by placing in the incubator at 37 ˚C containing 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: For A673 cells this is 5 x 106 cells in 10 mL of DMEM media with 10% FBS, P/S/Q supplementation, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate. These conditions may vary depending on the growth rate of the cells used.\nDeplete endogenous factor of interest. If cells do not need to have the endogenous protein of interest depleted, skip ahead to step 1.4.",
    "Thaw viral aliquot for transduction of shRNA or CRISPR construct targeting the protein of interest. Thaw frozen aliquots quickly in a 37 °C water bath.\nAdd 2.5 µL of 8 mg/mL polybrene to each viral aliquot and mix by gentle pipetting. Remove media from plates of cells and gently add viral aliquot to 10 cm plate by pipetting along the side of the plate. Rock the plate to spread the 2 mL of viral aliquot.\nIncubate at 37 °C in the tissue culture incubator for 2 h. Rock the plate every 30 min to prevent any areas of the plate drying out.\nAdd 5 mL of DMEM media with 10% FBS, P/S/Q supplementation, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate, with 5 µL of 8 mg/mL polybrene. Let cells incubate overnight.\nIn the morning remove media from cells and passage cells into media supplemented with a selection reagent. When passaging cells, seed them in a manner to allow them to grow for 48-72 h and reach 50% confluency.\n\t\tNOTE: For A673 cells with pSRP-iEF-2, cells are seeded in a 1:5 split and selected for 72 h with 2 µg/mL puromycin.\nTransduce cDNA expression constructs.\n\t\nCheck cells to confirm 50-70% confluency.\nThaw viral aliquot(s) for transduction of cDNA construct(s) of interest. Thaw frozen aliquots quickly in a 37 °C water bath. Add 2.5 µL of 8 mg/mL polybrene to each viral aliquot and mix by gently pipetting.\nRemove media from plated cells and gently add viral aliquot to 10 cm plate by pipetting along the side of the plate. Rock the plate to spread the 2 mL of viral aliquot.\nIncubate at 37 °C in the tissue culture incubator for 2 h. Rock the plate every 30 min to prevent any areas of the plate drying out.",
    "Add 5 mL of DMEM media with 10% FBS, P/S/Q supplementation, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate, with 5 µL of 8 mg/mL polybrene. Let cells incubate overnight.\nIn the morning remove media from cells and passage cells into double selection media. Grow and passage cells as needed for 7-10 days to allow for double selection and expression of the cDNA construct.\n\t\tNOTE: This split of this passage may require optimization for different cell lines. For A673 cells with pSRP-iEF-2 and a pMSCV-hygro construct, cells are passed without splitting into 2 µg/mL puromycin and 100 µg/mL hygromycin.\n2. Collect cells, validate expression of constructs, and set up correlative phenotypic assays\nAfter 7-10 days of double selection collect cells in a 15 mL conical tube. Count collected cells with a hemocytometer. Aliquot collected cells for RNA-sequencing and to validate expression of cDNA constructs.\n\tNOTE: Set up any correlative phenotypic assays required by the research question under investigation. Colony forming assays are an example of a correlative phenotypic assay that are used here.\n\t\nCollect between 5 x 105 and 1 x 106 cells for RNA-sequencing and 2 x 106 cells for protein extraction. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 1 mL cold PBS. Pellet by centrifugation at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove supernatant. Flash freeze pellets in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\nSet up any correlative assays with the remaining cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here with collected samples stored in the -80 °C freezer.\nValidate the knockdown of protein of interest (if used) and expression of the panel of constructs.",
    "Thaw cell pellets for protein extraction on ice. Resuspend cells in ice cold 500 µL nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% IGEPAL) with protease inhibitor. Let it sit for 5 min on ice.\nPellet nuclei by centrifugation at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove supernatant. Wash nuclei in 500 µL ice cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% IGEPAL) with protease inhibitor.\nPellet nuclei by centrifugation at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend nuclei in 200 µL cold RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor (adjust the volume of RIPA buffer according to pellet size.) Let it sit on ice for 45-60 min with vigorous vortexing every 15 min.\nPellet cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 45-60 min. Keep the supernatant and transfer to a fresh cold tube\nPrepare samples for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis by boiling 5-10 µg of protein with 1x loading buffer for 5 min. Run an SDS-PAGE gel as required for the protein of interest.\nTransfer to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane as needed for the protein of interest. Block, and blot with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies to confirm the knockdown of the endogenous protein (if used) and ectopic expression of the cDNA construct.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nExtract RNA. Assess RNA quality and quantity.\n\t\nThaw cell pellets on ice. Extract total RNA using a silica spin-column based extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Briefly, lyse the cells using the lysis buffer from the kit. Either apply the lysate to a silica spin-column with a brief spin at >13000 rpm for 30-60 seconds or remove gDNA by applying the lysate to a gDNA removal column with a brief spin at >13000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.\nPerform an on-column DNA digestion if lysate was directly applied to a silica spin-column. If using a gDNA removal column, apply the eluate to a silica-spin column with a brief spin at >13000 rpm for 30-60 s.\nWash RNA on the column per the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute RNA in 30 µL of elution buffer.\nAssess RNA quality and quantity using a fluorometer, or any other comparable instrument. Make sure the 260/280 ratio is close to 2 and that there are at least 2.5 µg of RNA to submit for sequencing.\n\t\tNOTE: As replicates are gathered, each replicate must be processed with the same RNA extraction protocol.\nUse a small aliquot of RNA to confirm the stable knockdown of the protein of interest, if required, by qRT-PCR. Store the remaining RNA sample at -80 °C.\nCollect biological replicates by repeating steps 1-2 until 3-4 complete sets of RNA have been collected. Ensure that each replicate displays adequate expression of cDNA constructs and stable knockdown of the endogenous protein (if used).\n3. Next-Generation Sequencing\nSubmit extracted RNA to be sequenced using a next generation sequencing platform with a target of 50 million 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads. Follow the instructions of the facility processing the samples. Select for poly-adenylated RNAs and strand-specific sequencing.\n4. Alignment and Transcript Counting Pipeline",
    "NOTE: This protocol assumes that following sample submission and processing, a set of paired FASTQ files are returned for each sample. These files are frequently compressed with a suffix of “fastq.gz”. Further analysis of these FASTQ files will require access to a high-performance computing (HPC) facility running a Linux operating system.\nTransfer files\n\t\nOpen a terminal to the HPC environment with PuTTY. Make a directory for the analysis called “project”.\nNavigate to the “path_to/project” directory and make a new directory for the compressed raw fastq.gz files called “fastq”. Also make a directory called “trimmed”. This is shown in Figure S1A-C.\nTransfer the compressed raw fastq.gz files from local storage to the “path_to/project/fastq/” directory using WinSCP or a similar program. Check that there is a “R1” and an “R2” file for each sample as shown in Figure S1B.\nOptional: If required, install TrimGalore. Set the directory containing the trim_galore executable file in the PATH environment variable in Linux.\n\t\tNOTE: Low quality reads and adapters are trimmed with TrimGalore. TrimGalore is available at https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore.\nOptional: Navigate to the directory for downloaded software packages (i.e “path_to/software”). Download the latest TrimGalore package using the command “curl -fsSL https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/archive/[version].tar.gz -o trim_galore-[version].tar.gz.”\nOptional: Unpack the tar.gz file. Use the command “tar -xvzf trim_galore-[version_number].tar.gz”.\nOptional: Make TrimGalore executable. Use the command “chmod a+x path_to/software/TrimGalore-[version]/trim_galore”. Make sure this new directory is in the PATH. Use the command “export PATH=path_to/software/TrimGalore-[version]:$PATH”.\nNavigate to path_to/project/fastq/. Use TrimGalore to trim the low quality reads from the fastq.gz files using the command shown in Figure S1C.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional flags for this command may be relevant and can be found here: https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/\n\t\tTrim_Galore_User_Guide.md\nCheck for the trimmed fastq.gz files in the path_to/project/trimmed directory. Ensure they are called sample1_R1_val_1.fq.gz and sample1_R2_val_2.fq.gz\nAlign trimmed FASTQ files with STAR and generate transcript counts.",
    "NOTE: STAR is available at https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)\n\t\nOptional: Install STAR version 2.6 or later. Set the STAR executable in the path.\nOptional: Navigate to the directory for downloaded software packages (i.e “path_to/software”).\nOptional: Download the STAR package using the command “curl -SLO https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/archive/[version].tar.gz”. Unpack the tar.gz file.\nOptional: Use the command “tar -xzf [version].tar.gz”. Make STAR executable. Use the command “chmod a+x path_to/software/STAR-[version]/bin”.\nOptional: Make sure this new directory is in the path. Use the command “export PATH=path_to/software/STAR-[version_number]/bin/linux_x86_64_static:$PATH”.\n\t\tNOTE: The STAR manual is available at: (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf).\nEnsure there is genome index to use with STAR. Place this in a directory separate from the path_to/project/ directory. If an index was previously generated for prior experiments use that. Alternatively use an appropriate pre-generated index if available here: http://refgenomes.databio.org/. Otherwise, construct a new index using the “STAR--runMode genomeGenerate” command using the instructions in the STAR manual.\n\t\tNOTE: For the remainder of this protocol the path to the STAR index will be referred to as “path_to/STAR_index”.\nNavigate to the path_to/project/ directory. Make a new directory called “STAR_output” as shown in Figure S1D.\nNavigate to the path_to/project/trimmed/ directory. Use the command shown in Figure S1D to run STAR to align the trimmed fastq.gz files.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is the most computationally intensive and it is recommended to perform this on a HPC cluster with multiple threads (i.e. >16) designated for the task of alignment. Depending on the number of samples and available computational resources this step may take many hours to days.\nFind the required output for the next steps which contain the counts per transcript at the following location: path_to/project/STAR_output/sampleN_ReadsPerGene.out.tab.",
    "NOTE: In the ReadsPerGene.out.tab file column 1 holds information about the feature being counted. Column 2 holds the unstranded read counts, column 3 holds the forward stranded read counts, and column 4 holds the reverse stranded read counts. The first four rows of this file will have information about the aligned reads that did not align to a single gene. This protocol requires the unstranded read counts.\nUse RStudio (preferable) or R in the HPC environment to compile the data from row 5 and below for columns 1 and 2 for each sample. Set the working directory to “project” in R.\nRead in each ReadsPerGene.out.tab file using the command in Figure S2A. For the first column, take only the characters before the “.” in the “Ensembl gene ID” column for the ease of downstream processing.\nCompile counts from all samples into a dataframe called “totcts” using the commands in Figure S2B. Save this new table of raw count data as a tab delimited .txt file, i.e. sample_counts.txt, if desired, using the “write.table” command.\n\t\tNOTE: The order of the Ensembl gene ID is the same for every ReadsPerGene.out.tab file across samples.\n5. Differential expression and downstream analysis\nNormalize for batch effects between samples with ComBat.\n\tNOTE: There are two possible variables that explain changes in gene expression, the first being the construct used (i.e. the sample) and the second being external factors associated with the passage of cells through time (i.e. the batch). A step to normalize samples for batch-to-batch variation with the R-package ComBat is recommended.\n\t\nInstall if needed and load the libraries for sva, DESeq2, AnnotationDBI, org.Hs.eg.db, pheatmap, RColorBrewer, genefilter, Cairo, ggplot2, ggbiplot, rgl, and reshape2 as shown in Figure S2C. For installation, use the “install.packages” command or Bioconductor per the documentation for each package.",
    "First filter the data to only those genes that have at least one count per read. Save this new table to denote filtering as seen in Figure S2D.\n\t\tNOTE: Frequently, many genes will have very low or no read counts.\nPrepare a second table for batch normalization called “vars” as shown in Figure S2E. Set the row names to the unique names of each sample. Set the column names to “sample”, “batch”, and “construct”.\nAssign all samples a unique number in the “sample” column from 1 to n, with n being the number of samples. Assign batch numbers to all samples in the “batch” column such that condition-a_1 and condition-b_1 are both assigned 1, and condition-a_2 and condition-b_2 are both assigned 2. Assign all condition designations to all samples in the “construct” column such that condition-a samples are all “A” and condition-b samples are all “B”.\nDefine the batch variable as well, and a specific null model matrix for ComBat as shown in Figure S2F. Run ComBat with the command defined in Figure S2F.\nFurther curate the data by rounding to the nearest integer. Also remove genes with a negative value. Use the commands shown in Figure S3A.\n\tNOTE: The output of batch normalization will have non-integer read counts and some genes with negative values. This step is required because the downstream differential expression analysis doesn’t support negative read counts.\nDefine the differential expression profile for each construct using DESeq2.\n\t\nInput the experiment design for DESeq2 as shown in Figure S3B. Construct a DESeqDataSet (dds) using the DESeqDataSetFromMatrix function, estimate the size factors, and run DESEq2, as shown in Figure S3B.\n\t\tNOTE: It is imperative that the column data entered for “condition” is in the same order as the column in the count matrix.",
    "In order to evaluate the quality of the analysis, extract the rlog-normalized counts used by DESeq2 as shown in Figure S3B.\n\t\tNOTE: During analysis, DESeq2 transforms counts with a “regularized log,” rlog, transformation to shrink the sample-to-sample differences for genes with low counts (low information) in order to preserve differences in genes with higher counts across samples (high information).\nWhen extracting the results for each transcriptional profile from the results of DESeq2, perform pairwise comparisons in reference to either the knockdown condition or baseline empty vector as shown in Figure S3C. Further amend these results with the HGNC gene symbols as shown in Figure S3D.\nAs seen in Figure S3E, extract data from DESeq2 results. Export as a single file with the Ensembl gene ID, HGNC symbol, base mean expression, and differential expression data for all constructs with log2FoldChange and raw and adjusted p-values.\n\t\tNOTE: Using an adjusted p-value < 0.05 is the recommended cutoff for differential expression.\nAssess successful batch normalization and intra-sample similarity. Check sample clustering with PCA and sample-to-sample distance plots using the rlog normalized counts using athe code shown in Figures S4A-B.\nUse the differential expression profiles to generate volcano plots using the code in Figure S4C. Evaluate changes in gene expression across constructs.\nUse the rlog normalized counts and hierarchical clustering to identify gene signatures unique to the different constructs. Use the code shown in Figure S4D.\n\t\nExtract the 1000 most variable genes across all constructs in a matrix. Use pheatmap to perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering of your samples based on these genes.",
    "Extract the clusters of interest from the dendrogram by deciding at what level of the dendrogram clusters of interest appear. Set “k” equal to the number of clusters at that level. Replot the heatmap ordered by cluster to determine which clusters are of interest as shown in Figure S5.\nExport the list of genes associated with each cluster as demonstrated in Table S1. Use this information to determine the genes in clusters of interest.\nIdentify the biological roles for different clusters of genes identified and compare between the classes. This can be performed using a variety of bioinformatics tools. ToppGene24 is used here and is freely available online.\n\tNOTE: There are many free tools which require just a list of genes to copy and paste into a field on a website. Choose the analytical tools most appropriate for the research questions under investigation.\nOptionally, if there are data available about genomic binding that drives transcriptional output for transcription factor of interest, compare the transcriptional response at genes associated with different binding elements to further evaluate mutant function.\n6. Comparison with Relevant Phenotypes\nCompare the correlative phenotypes with the transcriptomic profile data generated and interpret as appropriate."
