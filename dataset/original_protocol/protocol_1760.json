    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOmental tissue processing\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThis first step of the protocol will allow the isolation of mesothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes from fresh omental tissue, as also described by other authors (Carswell et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Toda et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Sonoda et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Tissue and culture media should be warmed in a 37°C water bath until use.\nNote: Fresh tissue should be covered in 0.9% saline solution and left at 4°C until processing. After the surgical resection, all the steps of this protocol should be performed under a laminar flow hood.\nIsolation of mesothelial cells\nNote: To obtain the best yield of mesothelial cells, it is recommended to process the tissue as soon as possible and no longer than 24 h from resection.\nAdd 10 cm3 (10 mL measured in a 50 mL falcon tube) of tissue to a 20 mL 1:1 solution of 10× trypsin and 1× DPBS in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nPlace the tube in a 37°C water bath for 20 min. Gently invert the tube twice after 10 min and at the end of the incubation period.\nNeutralize the solution by adding 20 mL of warm tissue medium.\nRemove the tissue and place it into a 10 cm petri dish.\nSpin down the solution in the falcon tube at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet consists of the mesothelial cells, which can be resuspended in culture medium and plated in a flask or petri dish.",
    "Note: The mesothelial cell pellet will appear bloody and cloudy. Do not aspirate off all the supernatant, leave 2–3 mL of supernatant in the falcon tube. Resuspend the pellet with culture medium and plate everything in a T75 flask or 10 cm petri dish. Leave the mesothelial cells in this medium for at least 2–3 days to allow the cells to attach to the plate. After 2–3 days, remove the spent medium, wash with 1× DPBS to remove any debris and add new fresh medium.\nNote: To check the quality and purity of the isolation, leave the cells growing for at least a week. Mesothelial cells have a cobblestone morphology and are positive for cell surface marker calretinin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1349-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Stages of cell isolation from omental tissue\n(A) Mesothelial cell line image taken at 10×.\n(B) Different phases after filtration of the digested tissue.\nUse two scalpels (or scissors) to mince the tissue from step 1d in small pieces (no bigger than 1 mm3).\nAdd the minced tissue to a 20 mL 1 mg/mL collagenase solution prepared in warm tissue medium to digest the tissue. Use a 50 mL falcon tube to obtain an appropriate digestion.\nIncubate the minced tissue and collagenase solution in a shaker at 37°C, 65 g for 30–60 min, until the solution is cloudy and the tissue digested.\nNote: The incubation time will depend on the tissue density. If the tissue is very fatty and soft, incubate for only 30 min. In case of a very fibrotic and stiff tissue, incubate up to 60 min to allow proper tissue digestion.\nIsolation of the stromal vascular fraction\nAfter 1 h incubation, mix gently the digested tissue using a plastic Pasteur pipette with the end cut off until complete dissociation of all the tissue clumps.",
    "Note: Using the Pasteur pipette, you can try to break down some clumps of tissue, which will form during the digestion.\nFilter the digested tissue using 250 μm strainers that fit into a 15 mL falcon tube. Using the plunger of a 1 mL syringe, gently press the tissue on the filter to help the filtration process.\nThe filtered solution will present four phases which starting from the bottom of the falcon tube are: 1) the pellet that contains the stromal vascular components; 2) pink/red spent digestion medium; 3) a yellow/white layer of adipocytes and 4) a top oily layer containing released lipids and adipocyte debris (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOnce you have 2–3 mL of the filtered solution in the 15 mL falcon tube, gently pipette the filtered solution (both fractions) into a new 50 mL falcon tube containing 20 mL of warm tissue medium to wash inactivate any residual of collagenase. You can then continue to filter the digested tissue using the same 250 μm strainer.\nNote: It is very important not to leave the filtered solution for too long in the 15 mL falcon tube, as the remaining collagenase can affect the viability of the adipocyte fraction. Over-digested tissue will appear slimy/almost liquid.\nAfter filtering all the digested tissue, spin down the 50 mL falcon tube containing the four fractions and the fresh tissue medium at 200 g for 3 min at room temperature. Dispose appropriately all the tissue left after the digestion.\nAfter the centrifugation, do not aspirate off the supernatant, but move carefully (using a plastic Pasteur pipette) the fraction containing the adipocytes (second fraction from the top) to a new 50 mL falcon tube with 20 mL of warm fresh tissue medium, without disturbing the pellet present in the below pink/red fraction.",
    "Once the adipocyte fraction has been moved to the new 50 mL falcon tube, aspirate the remaining supernatant without disturbing the pellet. This pellet contains the stromal vascular fraction, which consists mainly of fibroblasts.\nResuspend the pellet in fresh culture medium and plate the cells in a flask/petri dish.\nNote: The stromal vascular fraction solution will appear bloody and cloudy. Once the cells are plated in a 10 cm petri dish/T75 flask, incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 the cells in this medium for at least 2–3 days to allow the cells to attach to the plate. After 2–3 days, remove the spent medium, wash with 1× DPBS to remove any debris and add new fresh medium.\nNote: To check the quality and purity of the isolation, leave the cells growing for at least a couple of days. You can test their phenotype by staining them with any of the common markers used for fibroblast, such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), FAP (fibroblast activation protein alpha) and others.\nAdipocyte isolation\nSpin down the falcon tube containing the adipocyte fraction from step 2f at 200 g for 2 min at room temperature.\nTo separate properly the adipocyte fraction from the residual medium/red fraction, use a plastic Pasteur pipette and try to collect only the adipocyte fraction which is the second fraction from the top, avoiding the oily top fraction and the spent bottom medium as much as possible. Place the adipocyte fraction in a new 15 mL falcon tube.\nNote: It is very important to minimize the uptake of excess medium. It is also very critical to avoid the oily fraction, which will be present just above the adipocyte (yellow) fraction. Failing to do so will affect the proper polymerization of the gel.",
    "Repeat step 3b until the adipocyte fraction is the only fraction present within the tube.\nNote: To easily separate the remaining medium from the adipocyte fraction, leave the tube in a rack for a couple of minutes, until the phases will separate.\nMeasure the volume of the adipocyte fraction and prepare the adipocyte gel mixture as indicated in the Methods.\nNote: While preparing the adipocyte gel mixture, all the components, excluding the adipocyte fraction, will need to stay in ice, until adipocyte addition.\nOnce the adipocyte gel mixture is prepared, pipette gently 100 μL of solution in 96-well plate. Invert the tube every 30 s (or roughly every 4 gels plated) to mix the solution. Incubate immediately at 37°C, 5% CO2 to facilitate gel polymerization.\nNote: Step 3e has to be done quickly with care. It is important that gels set quickly to avoid different components separating within the mixture.\nIncubate for at least 30 min. Once solidified, the gels will look yellow/white. Using a very small spoon or spatula, carefully transfer each gel to a 24-well Corning plate containing 1 mL of adipocyte gel medium. Gels will float in the medium. Medium change is required every second day. The adipocyte gels are viable and usable for further experiments up to 24–30 days.\nTri- or tetra-culture preparation\nTiming: 2–5 days\nThis part of the protocol will allow the set-up of two different 3D human multicellular models (tri- and tetra-culture i.e., three and four cell type cultures). All the steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood.",
    "Tri-culture set up The tri-culture model is made of three different cell lines: HGSOC malignant cell lines, omental fibroblasts (isolated following point 2 of this protocol) and adipocyte gels (prepared in point 3 of this protocol). This model consists of a collagen gel made up of malignant and fibroblast cells that is then embedded within an adipocyte gel.\nTo set up the collagen gel, follow the recipe of the collagen mixture listed in the methods. The ratio between fibroblast and cancer cells used is 1:1 (for our model we used 1 × 105 to 2.5 × 105 cells)\nNote: The cell ratio within the collagen gel might vary according to the type of cancer studied, the aggressiveness of the malignant cells and their duplication time.\nOnce the collagen gel mixture is ready, pipette 100 μL of the solution in a 96-well plate. Incubate the collagen gels for at least 1 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: Once solidified, the collagen gels will appear white/transparent. The collagen gels are fragile, take extra care when moving them.\nAfter the incubation, use a small spatula or spoon to detach the gels from the 96-well plate and to move them in a 24-well plate with 1 mL of culture medium. Medium needs to be changed every second day.\nOptional: To increase extracellular matrix (ECM) production by both fibroblasts and malignant cells, it is possible to add a 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid solution in the medium every second day.\nCollagen gels can be incorporated in the adipocyte gels after 5–7 days of incubation.\nTo incorporate the collagen gel within the adipocyte gel, gently move an adipocyte gel from the culture plate to the bottom of a 24-well plate (no medium required).",
    "Quickly take a collagen gel from the culture plate and place it on top of the adipocyte gel.\nGently press the collagen gel within the adipocyte gel using the plunger of a 1 mL syringe.\nOnce the gels are embedded together, add 1 mL of culture medium to the well and use the tri-culture for further experiments.\nNote: After 21 days, the adipocyte gel viability starts to decrease to values below 50%–60%, so plan to use the adipocyte gels accordingly.\nTetra-culture set up The tetra-culture includes four different cell types: HGSOC malignant cell lines, primary fibroblasts, mesothelial and adipocyte cells. In this model, the different cell types are layered on top of the adipocyte gel.\nFibroblasts and mesothelial cell addition\nTo start layering cells on top of the adipocyte gel, prepare a collagen “adhesive” solution following the recipe outlined in the above “Materials and equipment” section. This is used to stick the adipocyte gel to the bottom of a 96-well plate prior to addition of cells.\nCarefully move the adipocyte gels from 24-well plate to a 96-well plate on a layer (20 μL) of “adhesive” solution.\nIncubate the plate for at least 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nDuring this time, take an 80%–90% confluent flask of fibroblast, aspirate the spent medium, wash with 1× DPBS followed by trypsin and count the fibroblasts.\nPlate the appropriate number of fibroblasts in 100 μL of culture medium on top of the adipocyte gel. (For our model we used 4×104 cells).\nIncubate for 2 h after which wash with 1× DPBS, trypsinize and count the mesothelial cells.\nPlate the appropriate number of mesothelial cells in 100 μL on top of the adipocyte gels with fibroblasts. (For our model we used 2×105 mesothelial cells).",
    "Incubate for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 before proceeding to the next step.\nHGSOC cells addition\nAfter 24 h, fibroblasts and mesothelial cells will have attached to the adipocyte gel and formed a nice “mat”.\nAspirate off the spent medium, wash with 1× DPBS and then de-attach and count the malignant cells.\nCarefully remove the supernatant on the adipocyte gels and replace it with 200 μL of HGSOC cells in culture medium.\nIncubate the gels for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nGently dislodge the tetra-culture and move to a new 24-well plate with 1 mL of culture medium."
