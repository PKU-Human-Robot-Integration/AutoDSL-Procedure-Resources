    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nYeast cell culture\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step describes the culturing of yeast cells prior to the day of imaging.\nRevive yeast strain(s) of interest from a glycerol stock by streaking out the strain on a YPD plate.\nIncubate the plate upside down at 30°C for 2–3 days.\nNote: YPD is a rich medium that allows for optimal yeast growth but should be avoided for liquid cultures used for microscopy due to high levels of autofluorescence.\nNote: Once single colonies with a 1–2 mm diameter are present, store plates upside down and covered in parafilm for up to 1 month at 4°C.\nNote: This step is unnecessary for newly created strains already plated and stored at 4°C.\nThe day prior to imaging, prepare a starter culture by inoculating a single colony into a culture tube containing 3 mL SC medium.\nIncubate in culture tube rotator at 30°C for 12–16 h.\nNote: Alternatively, incubation can be performed at 20°C–22°C, resulting in slightly slower growth rates. In either case, ensure the incubation takes place in a dark location and has a constant source of agitation (shaking or rotating).\nNote: For culture volumes under 5 mL, we commonly use disposable culture tubes with a capacity of 14 mL. For culture volumes between 5 and 10 mL, we prefer to use culture tubes with a capacity of 20 mL to prevent problems with culture aeration.\nCell dilution and chemical dimerization\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis step describes the dilution of the starter culture, culturing cells to early logarithmic phase, and inducing chemical dimerization of the FKBP domain through addition of AP20187 to the culture.\nThe following day dilute the overnight starter culture to an OD600 of 0.1–0.2 in a total volume of 10 mL fresh SC medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1573-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Timeline of drug treatment and live cell imaging for either one or two strains\nNote: 5 mL of total yeast culture will be needed for drug treatment. An initial volume of 10 mL will allow for numerous OD600 measurements, while not running the risk of running low on culture.\nNote: We typically dilute overnight cultures 20-fold in fresh SC medium (500 μL overnight culture, 9,500 μL SC medium), resulting in an OD600 ∼0.15.\nNote: If multiple strains are being imaged, staggering the dilution times by an hour will allow for minimal overlap between each step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIncubate the diluted culture in rotator at 30°C for 3–5 h, allowing cells to grow to early logarithmic phase (OD600 0.2–0.3).\nTransfer 2.5 mL of early log phase cells to two new culture tubes labeled for drug (AP20187) or vehicle (ethanol) treatment, respectively.\nReturn the ethanol treatment tube to 30°C incubator.\nNote: We purchase AP20187 as a 0.5 mM solution in 100% ethanol, however it can also be purchased as a solid chemical. If purchased as a solid, dissolve in 100% ethanol to a concentration of 0.5 mM, and store at −20°C.\nCritical: Including the vehicle (ethanol) treatment cells will be crucial for proper analysis.\nAdd 25 μL of 0.5 mM AP20187 (5 μM final) to the AP20187 treatment tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1573-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pilot experiment for determining optimal AP20187 treatment duration\nAim21-FKBP-GFP recruitment to endocytic sites increases over the 60 min following AP20187 treatment, then remains constant from 60 min to 120 min. Scale bar, 1 μM. Error bars, mean with 95% CI.\nReturn to the incubator and rotate at 30°C for 90 min.",
    "Note: The concentration of ethanol following drug or vehicle treatment using the outlined volumes is less than 1% (v/v), posing no threat to the health of budding yeast cells.\nOptional: The optimal incubation time of cultures with AP20187 may vary depending on the protein of interest. To determine the optimal incubation time of cultures with AP20187, it may be beneficial to perform a pilot experiment with multiple drug treatment times (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n30 min after AP20187 treatment, remove the ethanol treatment tube from the incubator and add 25 μL of 100% ethanol.\nReturn to the incubator and rotate at 30°C for 90 min.\nNote: Each treatment should take about 20 min to prepare slides and image. Staggering the drug and vehicle treatments by 30 min allows for ample time to image while keeping the treatment period constant at 90 min.\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step outlines the processes of concentrating cultures, preparing slides, and imaging slides on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Each slide will take about 20 min to prepare and image.\nFollowing the 90 min incubation, transfer 1 mL of AP20187 treated cells to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 × g for 1 min.\nAspirate ∼970 μL of the supernatant, leaving behind ∼30 μL of liquid and the yeast cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer 3 μL of the cell suspension to the center of a microscopy slide.\nCover the cell suspension with a glass coverslip.\nNote: Debris on the slide or coverslip can cause some of the yeast cells to be improperly immobilized. Gently wipe slide and coverslip with a kimwipe immediately prior to slide preparation to remove any debris that may prevent the coverslip from lying flat along with the slide.",
    "Note: The coverslips used in this protocol have dimensions of 22 mm length × 22 mm width. If coverslips with different dimensions are used, the volume of cell suspension used for slide preparation may need to be adjusted.\nMount the prepared slide on a 100× oil immersion objective.\nNote: A spinning disk confocal microscope is our imaging system of choice given its acquisition speed and gentle imaging. However, alternate imaging systems may be utilized.\nUsing brightfield illumination, focus on a medial focal plane at the cross-section of a group of cells, and center the cells in the field of view.\nNote: For analysis of images, five cells will be analyzed per time-lapse image. To account for these, ensure that ∼10 budding cells are centered in the field of view.\nCapture time-lapse images at 1 s intervals for 90 s with the following parameters:\n488 nm laser line: 250 ms exposure.\n561 nm laser line: 250 ms exposure.\n50% laser power.\nCritical: Exposure and laser power must be optimized for your imaging system and protein(s) of interest to ensure adequate signal while minimizing photobleaching. These parameters should be determined prior to the experiment.\nNote: Excitation wavelength must be matched to the FP that is used. For this example, the 488 nm and 561 nm laser lines are used to excite GFP and mCherry fusion proteins, respectively.\nNote: A 90 s time-lapse duration is well suited for proteins involved in the late stages of endocytosis, such as the actin polymerization and scission machinery. For proteins with longer patch lifetimes, such as adaptor or coat proteins, time-lapse images will need to be collected over a longer duration and may require a longer interval between images to prevent photobleaching.\nCapture 2–3 additional time-lapse images using identical parameters.",
    "90 min following ethanol treatment, repeat steps 8–14 with the ethanol-treated cells.\nImage analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h per slide\nThis step outlines the analysis of individual endocytic patches from time-lapse images.\nUsing SlideBook 6, open a time-lapse image and identify an actively budding mother cell to analyze. Endocytic proteins will appear in the cell as punctate structures along the cell membrane, persist for a period, then disappear (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1573-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of endocytic patches from time-lapse images\n(A) An example live-cell microscopy image from cells expressing Aim21-FKBP-GFP. An individual endocytic patch from a mother cell (yellow box) is tracked over time in the kymograph to the right.\n(B) (B, top) A cell expressing Aim21-FKBP-GFP is annotated to display the cell periphery (white) and the nucleus/vacuole (yellow). (B, bottom) The background, cytosol and patch regions used for measuring fluorescence intensity during image analysis are displayed in blue. Ensure that the cytosol region does not include area from the dimmer nucleus and vacuole, if present. Scale bars, 1 μM.\nNote: Alternatively, image analysis can be performed using a multitude of different image analysis programs.\nNote: We prefer to only analyze mother cells as it is difficult to differentiate between individual endocytic patches in daughter cells, which are rich in endocytic patches (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Additionally, it is difficult to determine a reliable fluorescence intensity of the cytosol in patch-rich daughter cells.\nFor the first five endocytic patches to appear within the cell, determine the following metrics:\nPeak patch/cytosol fluorescence intensity ratio: peak patch/cytosol ratio is a metric used to assess the recruitment of a protein to endocytic patches.\nCreate a mask within the time-lapse image (select Analyze > Create Mask).",
    "Generate regions within the mask that cover the endocytic patch of interest, the cytosol of the mother cell, and the background outside of the cell (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Tools for generating regions are found under Analyze > Mask Generation.\nTrack the patch over time and record the average fluorescence intensity values of each mask for the frame in which the average patch intensity is at its maximum.\nCorrect the patch and cytosol fluorescence intensities by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity.\nDivide the corrected patch intensity by the corrected cytosol intensity.\n    p e a k  p a t c h   c y t o s o l    r a t i o =   p a t c h  i n t e n s i t  y  p e a k    −  b a c k g r o u n  d  p e a k     c y t o s o l  i n t e n s i t  y  p e a k    −  b a c k g r o u n  d  p e a k      \nNote: Ensure that the mask in the cytosolic region of the cell excludes the vacuole and nucleus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Adjusting the contrast of the fluorescence image or taking a differential interference contrast (DIC) image can make identification of the vacuole and nucleus easier.\nPatch lifetime: patch lifetime is a measure of the duration that an endocytic protein is present at an endocytic patch, measured in seconds.\nVisually identify the starting point of the patch.\nCount the number of frames in which the protein is present at the patch.\nMultiply the number of frames by the time-lapse image frame interval (e.g., 15 frames × 1 s interval = 15 s patch lifetime).",
    "Note: Mutations that cause defects in recruitment of endocytic proteins to patches often result in an underestimation of the patch lifetime of the protein, as the protein may be present at levels below detection for much of its lifetime.\nRepeat the analysis on 5 total cells in the time-lapse image.\nRepeat the same analysis of 5 cells in a second time-lapse image, resulting in the analysis of 50 endocytic patches in total.\nComplete the analysis in steps 16–20 for both AP20187 and ethanol-treated cells.\nCompare the average peak patch/cytosol ratio and patch lifetime of AP20187 and ethanol-treated cells to determine the effect of homodimerization."
