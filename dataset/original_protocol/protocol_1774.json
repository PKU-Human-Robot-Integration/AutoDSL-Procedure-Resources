Make sure you have the same pellet volume in each condition. If not, calculate each pellet volume and add the equivalent volume to each pellet (Example: For 100 μL of cell pellet, add 900 μL of lysis buffer). In our conditions, we had 100 μL pellet for each condition.\nDissociate the pellet using the pipette or by vortexing.\nIncubate on ice for 20–30 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate for 20 min at 15000 RPM/21400 g at 4°C to separate the chromatin fraction (in the pellet) from the soluble fraction (supernatant).\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and add 1:1 volume of low salt lysis buffer to have a final concentration of 150 mM of NaCl.\nKeep a small fraction of the supernatant as an input (about 1/20) and mix it with 1:1 Laemmli sample buffer 2X (see composition in the table).\nSplit the rest of the cell lysate from each condition into two different tubes. One fraction will be used to immunoprecipitate endogenous HCF-1 protein using a specific antibody. The second fraction will serve as a control immunoprecipitation by using an unrelated antibody (anti-GAL4 in our case).\nNote: GAL4 protein is a transcription factor, which is not expressed in human cells. Using an unrelated antibody, as a control for protein immunoprecipitation, will insure specificity of the bait.",
    "Add 5 μg of HCF-1 antibody to each IP condition from GFP shRNA, OGT shRNA, PUGNAc, Thiamet G, HBSS and DMSO lysates. Add 5 μg of GAL4 antibody to the immunoprecipitation control fractions.\nSeal the tubes containing the cell lysate-antibody mix with Parafilm to prevent leakage. Place on a tube rotator overnight at 4°C.\nThe next day, prepare 25 μL of protein G-Sepharose beads for each condition in new tubes. The bead suspension should be blocked for at least 1 h in 1% BSA dissolved in the lysis buffer for an optimal immunoprecipitation.\nAdd the cell lysate-antibody mix to 25 μL of packed beads prepared in separate tubes.\nIncubate for 4–6 h at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate-antibody-beads mix for 5 min at 4°C at 3000 RPM/900 g.\nDiscard the supernatant. At this step, HCF-1 protein should be coupled to the beads.\nWash the beads 5 times by adding 1 mL of wash buffer (same composition as the lysis buffer except for the anti-protease concentration that is reduced from 1:100 to 1:500). Invert the tube delicately after each wash and centrifuge 2 min at 4°C at 3000 RPM/900 g to pellet the beads.\nGently aspirate the last wash buffer and resuspend the beads in 60 μL Laemmli sample buffer 2×.\nPause point: At this step, samples can be stored at −20°C for several weeks until the day of Western Blot.\nImmunoprecipitation of exogenous HCF-1 protein:\nTake pellets from step 2.e. (V5-tagged HCF-1 overexpression in HEK293T)\nRepeat steps 1-a to 1-f (from ‘immunoprecipitation of exogenous and endogenous HCF-1’ protocol) to lyse the cell pellets. In our case, we used 50 μL pellet for each condition.\nAdd 30 μL of anti-V5-coupled beads to the cell lysates, seal the Eppendorf tubes with Parafilm and incubate overnight on a tube rotator at 4°C.",
    "The next day, centrifuge the beads for 5 min at 4°C at 3000 RPM /900 g and carefully discard the supernatant without touching the beads pellet.\nWash the beads at least 5 times with 1 mL of wash buffer (same composition as the lysis buffer except for the anti-protease mix concentration that is reduced from 1:100 to 1:500). Invert the tube delicately after each wash and centrifuge 2 min at 4°C at 3000 RPM/900 g to pellet the beads.\nGently aspirate wash buffer and resuspend the beads in 60 μL Laemmli sample buffer 2× by vortexing.\nPause point: At this step, samples can be stored at −20°C for several weeks until the day of Western Blot.\nCritical: If the volumes of cell pellets are variable between conditions, we recommend performing a protein quantification using the Bradford method, right after step 1-e. (from ‘immunoprecipitation of exogenous and endogenous HCF-1’ protocol). After quantification, follow the immunoprecipitation steps with equivalent amounts of total proteins for each condition. Final lysate volumes can be adjusted using lysis buffer containing all inhibitors.\nTo increase precision, prepare a master mix by diluting the beads in the lysis buffer. Thus, you can aliquot the 25 μL beads in the new tubes in 1 mL volume using p1000 pipette.\nWhen aliquoting, cut the extremity of the pipette tip to facilitate beads pipetting.\nDo not vortex the beads until the final step of beads resuspension in sample buffer 2×. In addition, be careful when using the vacuum during the wash step, as the beads can be partially or totally lost. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for a simplified visualization of these steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1363-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Detailed steps for immunoprecipitation\nProtein O-GlcNAc level detection by Western Blotting\nTiming: 2 days",
    "At this step, we perform Western Blotting on immunoprecipitated proteins from step 2 (from ‘immunoprecipitation of exogenous and endogenous HCF-1’ protocol) or on total cell lysates quantified using the BCA or Bradford protein quantification methods to determine the amount of proteins to be loaded in the polyacrylamide gel, as previously described in (Daou et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nProtein separation by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel:\nPrepare or purchase a pre-made polyacrylamide gels of appropriate percentage according to the molecular weight of the protein of interest (here we use homemade gels at 8 or 10% polyacrylamide concentration).\nBuild your gel in the running electrophoresis apparatus and fill with 1× running buffer, as instructed by the manufacturer.\nCarefully load your samples containing equal amounts of proteins from quantified cell lysates or from immunopurified protein samples. Include a molecular weight marker.\nRun the gel at 100–150 V until protein marker reaches the bottom of the gel.\nProtein transfer on PVDF membranes:\nWet your PVDF membranes in methanol for few seconds.\nSoak sponges and Whatman paper in transfer buffer.\nGently remove the gel from the running apparatus and prepare the transfer sandwich by building the following layers in the transfer cassette without making bubbles (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]): sponge ==» Whatman paper ==» gel ==»PVDF ==» Whatman paper ==» sponge.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1363-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Specific protein O-GlcNAcylation detection by Western Blotting\nPlace the sandwich into a transfer apparatus and perform semi-dry or wet transfer at 0.5 A for 2 h or overnight at 35 V at 4°C. Proteins will migrate from the cathode (-) to the anode (+).\nProtein detection or immunoblotting:\nAfter transfer, briefly rinse the membrane with distilled water and stain it with Ponceau S to make sure proteins were transferred from the gel to the PVDF membrane.",
    "Rinse the membrane with distilled water and then with the PBS-tween buffer.\nIncubate the membrane in the blocking solution for 1 h at 22°C–25°C or overnight at 4°C.\nNote: We use 5% of skim milk powder in PBS-tween as the blocking solution.\nWash 3 times with PBS-tween for 15 min each.\nIncubate for at least 2 h at 4°C with primary antibody against HCF-1 protein or anti-O-GlcNAc. To make sure the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody used is specific, incubate a parallel membrane with the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody in the presence of 0.5–1 M of N-acetylglucosamine compound (see Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: Primary antibodies are prepared at 1:1000 dilution in PBS–tween buffer supplemented with 1% BSA and 1 mM sodium azide for long-term conservation.\nWash 3 times with PBS-tween for 15 min each.\nIncubate with the secondary peroxidase-coupled antibody for 1 h.\nNote: Secondary antibodies are prepared at 1:1000 dilution in PBS-tween 5% skim milk powder.\nWash 3 times with PBS-tween for 15 min each.\nDetect protein bands with ECL substrate using a chemiluminescence imager (we use Azure c600 machine from Azure Biosystems).\nCritical: Washing steps are important to minimize non-specific background. Do not let the membrane dry at any step during the process. Antibody concentration and incubation time may vary depending on the protein of interest. Use multiple exposure times with the machine to identify the optimal exposure for the best signal, making sure to avoid overexposure. When incubating with the ECL, make sure it is homogeneously spread over the membrane to avoid artifacts.\nSee Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for a simplified visualization of these steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1363-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
