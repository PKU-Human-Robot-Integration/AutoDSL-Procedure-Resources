    "Fly preparation Raise flies in standard cornmeal media in plastic 250 mL bottles containing 15–20 mL of media at 25 °C temperature, 60% relative humidity, and 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Transfer adult flies every 2–3 days to prevent crowding and sogging of media.Collect freshly eclosed flies of either sex, which may be 3–4 days old, in fresh media bottles such that each bottle has 20–30 flies. Age flies for 3–4 days at 25 °C, 60% humidity, and 12:12 h light/dark cycle.Note: The media is not considered fresh if it is dry and starts separating from the walls of the bottle or has low levels of bacterial or fungal growth. Starve flies in an empty glass vial containing wet filter paper for 20–24 h at 25 °C, 60% humidity, and 12:12 h light/dark cycle (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4891/bioprotoc-13-05-4891-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of flies for proboscis extension reflex assay. (A) Flies are starved in a vial overnight with a wet filter paper. (B) Flies are anesthetized on ice for not more than 1 min. (C) Anesthetized flies in the vial. (D) Anesthetized flies are transferred on a metal plate kept on ice. (E) Single anesthetized fly on the metal plate turned dorsal side up in order to stick to the coverslip using nail polish. (F), (G) Fly stuck on the coverslip with ventral side up. (H) Size of the drop of nail polish on the syringe used to immobilize flies on the coverslip. (I) Flies are kept in a humidified chamber for 1–2 h for recovery. (J) Syringe containing 10% sucrose for habituation, mounted on a micromanipulator.To anesthetize the starved flies, first cool an empty glass vial by placing it in a Styrofoam box filled with ice. After 5 min, transfer the starved flies into the now cold vial.",
    "To transfer the flies, tap the vial containing the flies such that they come to the bottom of the vial and quickly invert this vial over the cold empty vial. Tap both the vials together such that all flies are transferred to the cold vial.Gently tap the cold vial on a rubber pad to bring the flies down to the bottom of the vial and place the vial back in ice for one more minute until all flies are anesthetized (Figure 1B, 1C).Place a metal plate on a Styrofoam tray filled with ice and wipe it with filter paper to remove condensed water. Gently transfer the anesthetized flies onto the metal plate kept on ice. Make sure the plate is dry by wiping it repeatedly before or after transferring flies onto it, whenever water condenses over it. Keep only the female flies and discard all male flies. Male and female flies are distinguished based on the standard sexually dimorphic traits like male leg sex combs, male genitalia, and female abdomen pigmentation. Using a fine synthetic hairbrush, turn the flies’ dorsal side up (Figure 1D, 1E). It is important to note that the total amount of time flies spend on ice, including both in the vial and on the metal plate, should not be more than 5 min, as it can affect their response.Take a small amount of transparent nail polish (~1 μL) using the needle of a 1 mL syringe (Figure 1H) and place the drop on the coverslip. Gently place the coverslip on the fly such that the nail polish touches the posterior part of the head and anterior part of the thorax. This is done so that the head does not move while performing PER.",
    "It is also important to use only a small drop of nail polish on the coverslip so that it does not reach the proboscis or the legs while fixing the fly (Figure 1F, 1G). Small bubbles may appear occasionally in the nail polish but that does not affect the immobilization of the fly on the coverslip. Note that all these steps requiring flies to be anesthetized are performed on the metal plate.Place the fly fixed on the coverslip (in a ventral side up direction so that the proboscis and legs are exposed for stimulation) in a box for 1–2 h for recovery at 25 °C. The box is lined with wet filter paper as the coverslips with flies are at the base, to maintain humidity inside (Figure 1I). Flies are transferred manually by gently placing the coverslip with the immobilized flies in the box. The number of flies placed in the box depends on its size. A box with the dimensions mentioned in the current study allows a maximum of 15–20 flies so that crowding and therefore overlap can be avoided. The minimum number of flies can be determined by the user.Habituation of the sucrose-induced PER Fill three 1 mL syringes: one with 2% sucrose solution, one with 10% sucrose solution, and the third with double-distilled water. Fix the 1 mL syringe with 10% sucrose solution on a micromanipulator in the slot provided (Figure 1I).Gently pick the coverslip with the immobilized fly and place it under the stereoscope. Using the syringe containing double-distilled water, touch the proboscis or tarsus of the fly with water, as shown in Video 1. Allow the fly to drink water through proboscis until it stops and is sated. Flies are sated after being presented with water 1–2 times.",
    "If the fly does not respond to water, consider the fly for the experiment and test the naïve response to sucrose as explained in step B3.Note: The occasional fly may not stop drinking water even after being presented with water three or more times; discard such flies. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Water satiation. Initially, the fly is presented with water. If the fly extends its proboscis, water is offered to satiate it until there is no further response to water.Immediately after feeding water to the fly, carefully touch the distal tips of the foreleg tarsi with a sucrose drop with the syringe containing 2% sucrose, while preventing any contact with the proboscis. Record whether there is a proboscis extension in response or not. Repeat this step five times with a gap of 10 s between each two trials (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Proboscis extension reflex (PER) in response to 2% sucrose. Video in real time showing the tarsi of the forelegs being stimulated with 2% sucrose five times, with 10 s of inter-trial interval, to quantify the PER response before and after exposure to habituating stimulus.Using the knobs attached to the micromanipulator to move the syringe in XY and Z plane, adjust the angle and height of the syringe containing 10% sucrose fixed on the micromanipulator, such that the sucrose drop hanging from the syringe is out of reach from the extended proboscis and touches only the distal tips of the forelegs (Video 3). Keep the syringe in this position, touching the tarsi, for 10 min, set on a timer. If the size of the sucrose drop becomes smaller due to evaporation, carefully press the plunger of the syringe and readjust the size. Flies are exposed to 10% sucrose immediately after step B3.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Exposure to habituating stimulus.",
    "The tarsi of the fly are exposed to 10% sucrose for 10 min in order to habituate the PER response. The video is representative, showing 12 s from the 10 min exposure. The syringe containing 10% sucrose is fixed on a micromanipulator such that only tarsi are stimulated whereas the proboscis cannot reach the stimulus.After 10 min, move aside the 10% sucrose syringe and wash the tarsal tips with double-distilled water immediately after sucrose exposure (Video 4).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Leg wash after exposure to 10% sucrose. The tarsi are washed with double-distilled water to clear 10% sucrose that may be sticking to the legs.Repeat step B3 immediately after leg wash to record the habituated response. Record all data. In a habituated fly, the number of times the proboscis is extended in response to 2% sucrose should decrease (Video 5).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 5. Response after sucrose exposure. After exposure to 10% sucrose for 10 min, tarsal stimulation with 2% sucrose does not lead to PER response, thus exhibiting habituation.Dishabituation using yeast Touch the proboscis of the habituated fly with 10% yeast solution using a 1 mL syringe and quickly remove the syringe in order to prevent or minimize potential consumption of yeast (Video 6). Repeat this over a period of 1 min, set on a timer, with a gap of approximately 10 s such that the proboscis is stimulated 5–6 times with yeast.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 6. Dishabituation/habituation override induced by 10% yeast. 10% yeast is presented five times to the proboscis in order to dishabituate the fly. Yeast is quickly removed in order to prevent ingestion.Leave the fly for 1 min without any stimulus so that it gets time to groom itself in order to remove any sticking yeast.Record the proboscis extension response to 2% sucrose as described previously, in yeast-exposed flies.",
    "The flies should show increased (dishabituated) response.The procedure to induce habituation to sucrose and its override using 10% yeast is summarized in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4891/bioprotoc-13-05-4891-g002.jpgFigure 2. Line diagram representing the protocol. Figure shows the various key steps in the protocol to habituate flies to sucrose and override it by presenting 10% yeast to proboscis. The figure also shows the time period of the time-bound steps."
