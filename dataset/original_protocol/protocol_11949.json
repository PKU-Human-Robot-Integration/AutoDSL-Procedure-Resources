    "This experiment was performed with the ovaries of four mongrel female dogs donated after elective surgery at a canine sterilization program. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee on the use of animals of UNESP-FCAV (protocol no. 026991/13).\n1. Experimental Preparation\nPrepare or purchase 500 mL of sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without calcium or magnesium.\nPrepare a collagenase I stock solution by mixing 40 µg of the enzyme in 1 mL of DPBS. Filter using a 0.2 µm syringe filter, and store 2 mL aliquots at -20 °C.\nPrepare the culture media from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) low glucose with 10% fetal serum and 1% of antibiotics.\nCollect sterile materials: scissors and forceps, a tissue culture flask, dishes, tubes, and 10 mL and 5 mL pipettes.\nUse standard cell culture laboratory equipment: a biological safety cabinet (BSC), a cell culture incubator set at 5% CO2 and 38 °C, and a centrifuge.\nClean the BSC: with gloved hands, sterilize it with 70% EtOH, using UV lights.\n2. Isolation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from the Ovary\nAfter surgery, keep the ovaries in PBS on ice in a conical tube, until their arrival at the lab.\nFill two 100 mm Petri dishes with 10 mL of PBS.\nRemove the ovaries from the tube and transfer them to the first Petri dish with PBS. Wash them with mixing movements.\nGently retrieve the ovary and place it into another dish. With sterile tweezers and scissors, mince the tissue into very small pieces, approximately 1 mm in size.\nTransfer the ovarian tissue to a 35 mm Petri dish and add 2 mL of collagenase. Mince the tissue a little more.",
    "Place the Petri dish in the incubator at 38 °C for 3 h and gently shake the Petri dish with circular movements every 20 min.\nAfter 3 h, remove the Petri dish from the incubator.\nTransfer the contents of the dish to a 15 mL tube. Add 5 mL of expansion media.\nGently invert the tube before centrifugation. Centrifuge the tube at 2100 x g for 7 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 3 mL of expansion media.\nTransfer the pellet to a T25 bottle. Place the bottle in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 38 °C for 3 h.\n\tNOTE: The most important part of the procedure is to change the media after 3 h of incubation.\nRemove the bottle from the incubator and remove the media with the remaining tissue. Add 3 mL of fresh expansion media to the bottle.\nChange the media every 48 h and observe the bottle for cellular confluence.\n\tNOTE: The main steps of the procedure can be observed in Figure 1.\n3. Expansion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from the Ovary\nCell passage\nWhen the cells reach confluence, remove the media from the bottle.\nWash the bottle with 3 mL of PBS. Remove the PBS.\nAdd 1.5 mL of trypsin and put the bottle in the incubator at 38 °C for 3 min. Gently tap the bottle to help the cells to detach.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells should reach confluence approximately 5 - 7 d after the initial plating.\nAdd 3 mL of expansion media and transfer the contents to a conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 2100 x g for 7 min. Remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of expansion media.\nGently homogenize the contents of the tube.",
    "Take an aliquot of 10 µL of the sample to perform cell counting and put the tube with the cells back in the incubator.\nPlace 10 µL of the mix into the hemocytometer.\nCounting the cells\nUse the microscope's 10X objective and focus on the grid lines of the hemocytometer.\nCount the cells in five small squares (Figure 2).\nMultiply the counted number by 50,000 to estimate the number of cells per milliliter.\n4. Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from the Ovary\nNOTE: Differentiation assays were performed according to the guidelines established in Hill et al.9.\nSeed 1.0 x 104 cells per well, in triplicate, using a 4-well culture dish.\nAdd 1 mL of expansion media.\nGently agitate the dish with circular movements.\nAfter 24 h, replace the culture media with the desirable differentiation media.\nFor osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, incubate the cells with the induction media for 30 d, with media replacement every 3 d. Specific differentiation kits were used for each of these assays.\nFor neurogenic lineage differentiation, incubate the cells for 10 d in the induction media, with media replacement every 3 d. The media used here contained DMEM low glucose, 2 mM valproic acid, 1 µM hydrocortisone, 10 µM forskolin, 5 mM potassium chloride, 5 µg/mL insulin, and 200 µM butylated hydroxyanisole.\nFor endoderm precursors, incubate for 5 d in endoderm media as per the reagent manufacturer's instructions.",
    "For primordial germ cell lineage differentiation, incubate the cells in the induction media for 14 d, with media replacement every 3 d. The media used here contained DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 ng/mL LIF, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 µg/mL insulin, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 60 µM putrescine, 20 µg/mL transferrin, 10 ng/mL mouse epidermal growth factor, 1 ng/mL human basic fibroblast growth factor, 40 ng/mL human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and 15 mg/L penicillin.\nSubscription Required.
