    "All cell handling procedures should be performed in a BSC. The Finia system does not require the use of a BSC. The following procedures outline cell preparation practices for MSCs and PBMCs as the starting material for subsequent processing and cryopreservation using automated systems. More specifically, the procedures include thawing, cell culture, and harvest of cryopreserved MSCs as well as isolation of PBMCs from a fresh (i.e., not cryopreserved) one-tenth leukopak.Note: It is not advisable to follow the procedures for processing and cryopreservation of PBMCs directly thawed and isolated from a cryopreserved leukopak. If a cryopreserved leukopak is used, allow for a 24–48 h culture rescue period prior to processing and cryopreservation. Cell thawing (cryopreserved cells, MSCs) Thaw XSFM media at 4 °C overnight prior to the day of use.Prepare fresh media by adding 1% P/S to XSFM.Add 8 mL of fresh media to a 50 mL conical tube.Retrieve a vial of frozen cells from the LN2 storage.Thaw the vial in a water bath set at 37 °C for 2 min or until 90% of the ice has melted.Note: This may depend on the size of the vial and content volume. Record the thawing time.Gently transfer the cells from the cryovial to a 50 mL conical tube using a 1,000 μL micropipette with tip.Wash the vial with 1 mL of fresh media and add this to the conical tube. The final volume of the thawing media and cells should be approximately 10 mL.Gently resuspend the cells with a 10 mL serological pipette.Perform a cell count #1 (“Thawed Pre-Spin Count”) by adding 100 μL of cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.Insert the Via-1-Cassette tip into the microcentrifuge tube to uptake approximately 60 μL of cell suspension.Load the cassette into the NucleoCounter and record the cell count and diameter.",
    "Note: Please complete reading within 1 min after loading cells into cassette. Centrifuge the remaining cell suspension at 500× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant using a 10 mL serological pipette and add enough media to give an approximate cell concentration between 1 and 2.5 × 106 cells/mL (optimal concentration for accurate determination of cell count).Thoroughly resuspend the cells.Perform and record cell count #2 (“Thawed Post-Spin Count”) by adding 100 μL of cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.Note: Measurement of cells post spin can give an adjusted measure of viability due to dead cells being eliminated in the spin and can also be more accurate as the cells are usually less dilute. Insert the Via-1-Cassette tip to uptake approximately 60 μL of cell suspension.Load into the NucleoCounter and record the cell count and diameter.Calculate the volume needed of cell suspension to give 1.72 × 106 cells (number of cells needed for each HYPERFlask).Add 560 mL of media (XSFM + 1% P/S) into a storage bottle. Add 1.72 × 106 cells (1,000 cells/cm2) to the storage bottle and rock to ensure that the cells are evenly distributed in media.Gently pour the cell suspension into the HYPERFlask tilted at a 30° angle to the horizontal.Place the cap and distribute the cell suspension among all layers of the flask by placing on its long side and then its short side; then, place it lying flat and repeat these movements for even distribution of cells on all layers.Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the body of the flask by adding more media if needed. Small bubbles are acceptable near the neck of the flask.Incubate for five to seven days in an incubator set at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.",
    "Cell expansion and harvest Take daily microscopy images of the lowest layer of the flask to gauge confluence. Do not allow the MSCs to become overcrowded. Harvest MSCs when 80% confluence is achieved.Carefully pour 50 mL of media from the flask into a 50 mL conical tube. Label and set aside. This is used later to wash the flask.Remove all remaining media from the flask by pouring gently into a waste container.Add 50 mL of PBS 1× Ca2+, Mg2+ free to the HYPERFlask and tilt the flask on its long end, short end, and flat side multiple times for an even distribution of the reagent.Remove the PBS by pouring it gently into a waste container.Add 50 mL of TrypLE 1× to the flask and distribute evenly by rotating the flask along each end to detach cells.Incubate the flask for 5 min at 37 °C.Check the cells under a microscope. Tap the flask lightly against the microscope base to dislodge cells. If incomplete detachment of the cells from the flask is observed, re-incubate for at least another 5 min.Once the cells are completely detached, add 50 mL of XSFM to the flask and distribute evenly by rotating the flask along each end to subdue the activity of TrypLE.Note: Unlike TrypLE, other dissociation reagents may require neutralization with media containing serum. Gently pour the contents of the flask (i.e., cells in solution) into two 50 mL tubes.Centrifuge the tubes at 500× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Carefully remove the supernatant from the tubes and combine the pellets into a single tube by adding 5 mL of fresh media to one of the tubes, resuspending the cells, and transferring the cells in suspension to the second tube with the cell pellet.Thoroughly resuspend the cells.",
    "Perform and record cell count #3 (“Harvested Cell Count”) by adding 10 μL of cell suspension and 90 μL of XSFM to a microcentrifuge tube.Note: Given an expected high number of cells, it is recommended to perform cell counting with a dilution of the cell suspension to obtain an accurate cell count that is within the range of the instrument’s capabilities. Make sure to factor the dilution into the final cell count. Uptake the diluted sample into a Via-1-Cassette and load it into the NucleoCounter.Record the cell count and diameter.Keep the cells in media at room temperature (RT) until the Finia system is ready.Note: It is advisable to prepare the cells once the Finia system has been prepared for processing to minimize the time cells are kept at RT. Cell preparation (fresh cells, PBMCs) Bring PBS Ca2+, Mg2+ free, hPL, and Lymphoprep to RT.Bring the centrifuge to RT by switching off the cooling function and remove the brake by setting the deceleration to 0.Note: Removing the brake is necessary for density separation. Prepare 100 mL of dilution buffer (see Recipes).Transfer the contents of the one-tenth leukopak into a 50 mL conical tube.Note: The volume is between 10 and 30 mL for one-tenth leukopak. Record the total volume and add 2× volume of dilution buffer (i.e., 7 mL leukopak + 14 mL dilution buffer = 21 mL total volume).Perform and record cell count #1 (“Pre-Separation Cell Count”) by adding 10 μL of cell suspension and 90 μL of thawing buffer to a microcentrifuge tube.Note: Given an expected high number of cells, it is recommended to perform cell counting with a dilution of the cell suspension to obtain an accurate cell count that is within the range of the instrument’s capabilities. Make sure to factor the dilution into the final cell count.",
    "Prepare a 50 mL tube with an equal volume of Lymphoprep to the total volume of diluted blood preparation.Carefully layer the diluted blood preparation over the Lymphoprep by holding the tube at a 45° angle and slowly adding the blood approximately an inch above the Lymphoprep using a 1,000 μL micropipette with tip (see Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4900/bioprotoc-13-24-4900-g001.jpgFigure 1. Images of leukopak processing before (A) and after separation (B) using Lymphoprep by density centrifugation to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) Centrifuge the tube at 800× g for 20 min with the brake off and temperature set to RT.Carefully remove and discard the upper plasma layer.Collect the buffy coat containing the PBMCs in a 50 mL tube (see Figure 1B).Add 10 mL of dilution buffer to the tube to wash the PBMCs.Centrifuge at 300× g for 5 min at 4 °C with brake on by setting deceleration to 9.Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and add 10 mL of dilution buffer to wash.Retain and set aside the cell pellet.Centrifuge the tube with supernatant at 300× g for 5 min at 4 °C to retrieve the remaining cells.Remove the supernatant and combine the cell pellets from both centrifugations into a single one adding 5 mL to 10 mL of dilution buffer to one of the tubes, resuspending the cells, and transferring the cells in suspension to the second tube with cell pellet.Perform count #2 (“Post-Separation Cell Count”). Take a 10 μL sample of the cell suspension and dilute 1:10 in a microcentrifuge tube.Uptake the diluted sample into Via-1-Cassette and load it into the NucleoCounter.Record the cell count and diameter.Keep the cells in dilution buffer at RT until the Finia system is ready.",
    "Preparation of the Finia system Log into the Cell Processing Application (CPA) software, and under Configure Devices (see Figure 2), create a custom protocol to set up the material, product bag, and QC bag volume targets and temperature set point. Save the protocol.Notes:  The temperature selected for MSCs and PBMCs was 8 °C. Temperature settings will affect the total process time. For example, setting the temperature of the protocol to 8 °C will reduce the time compared to setting to 4 °C. For the FINIA 50 tubing set, the product bags hold 10–28 mL and the QC bag holds 10–40 mL, so the maximum product volume is 124 mL + 6 mL (retained in tubing). For the FINIA 250 tubing set, the product bags hold 29–70 mL, the QC bag holds 10–40 mL, and the maximum product volume is 250 mL + 6 mL (retained in tubing), including the QC volume. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4900/bioprotoc-13-24-4900-g002.jpgFigure 2. Image of the Cell Processing Application (CPA) in the Finia system Click Configure Materials and define material IDs and specific gravity of each material. Touch Save.Create barcodes for each material.Note: It is important to ensure the material ID on the barcode matches the material ID in the CPA. Barcodes are created using the following schema: for Material 1 (cells): [Material ID]|[Material Batch ID]|Batch ID, e.g., MSCs|20230207|BatchID. For Material 2 (solution): [Material Type]|[Lot_ID], e.g., CS10|Lot 123. Remember to create a unique batch ID for each experiment to be able to recover the data stored in the CPA. “BatchID” is used by the system to identify that Material batch ID as the batch ID for the procedure report in the CPA.",
    "Optionally, mark the sterile PVC section of the transfer bag every 3 inches from its opening with a marker to aid in welding of the transfer bag to the tubing set.Note: To ensure you have sufficient length of tubing, tube welding at intervals of 3 inches is recommended. Turn on the welder.Note: It will take 5 min for the welder to warm up. Turn on the Finia device and log in to the system. Touch Start Procedure to advance to the protocol selection screen.Note: If the device was previously on, turn the device off for 60 s and then power it back on. The device receives configuration and material updates from the CPA each time it is powered on and the user logs in. The list of custom protocols is displayed. Touch the protocol that was created to use for the procedure and then touch Confirm.Check the function of the load sensor by first checking the 0-gram setting. With no weight on the load sensor, touch Check 0 g.Place the 500 g test weight on the load sensor. Once the test weight is at rest, touch Check 500 g.Remove the test weight from the load sensor and close the doors.The custom protocol values for material, volume, and QC bag targets and temperature set point appear on the screen. Visually confirm the values and touch Confirm.Notes:  This step refers to a protocol generated by following step D1. To change a target or the temperature set point, touch any field on the screen and enter the new values. Touch Next to advance to the next screen. Continue until the procedure targets are correct and touch Confirm.Scan the barcode of the tubing set and place the mixing bag on the load sensor.",
    "Note: Wipe the plate behind the mixing bag to remove any condensation that may cause the mixing bag to stick to the plate. Connect all tubing via the pumps, tubing holders, and fluid sensor, and close the pump covers.Slide the product bags and QC bag into the bag holders and load the bag lines into the valves. Pull the bag lines up through the valve until the port touches the bottom of the slide holder (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4900/bioprotoc-13-24-4900-g003.jpgFigure 3. The Finia Fill and Finish System. A. The Finia system with general user interface and barcode scanner underneath the equipment manifold. B. Finia system setup with FINIA 50 tubing set.Separation of the cells into bags and starting the Finia procedure Use the Harvested Cell Count (MSCs) or Post-Separation Cell Count (PBMCs) to calculate the amount of CryoStor CS-10 required.Note: For MSCs, the total volume placed into the transfer bag was 30 mL (10 mL product bag + 10 mL QC bag + 6 mL tubing + 15% extra). For PBMCs, the total volume was 41 mL (20 mL product bag + 10 mL QC bag + 6 mL tubing + 15% extra.) Confirm that the transfer bag (materials) contains enough volume for the Finia system to prepare in the mixing bag. Print cryolabels with donor information, cell concentration, operator initials, date, and any additional information desired (e.g., PDL/passage #).Retrieve the tube containing the cells from step B17 or C21.Centrifuge the cells to obtain the cell pellet.Note: Centrifugation for MSCs was 500× g for 5 min and for PBMCs was 300× g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.Add an appropriate amount of Cryostor CS-10 to the cell pellet at a desired cell concentration.Notes:  Record the duration for which the cells were exposed to the cryopreservation solution.",
    "Perform the following procedures quickly to minimize the duration for which cells are in cryopreservation solution, because cryopreservation solutions contain chemicals that may compromise cell viability. The Finia system is designed to add cryoprotectant solutions to a cell suspension. Prepare the transfer bag by puncturing the sample port with the spike (on the transfer bag) to open it and release pressure.Thoroughly resuspend the cells and transfer them into a syringe with an 18-gauge needle.Situate the needle in the sample port and fill the bag with the cell suspension.Plug the sample port with the spike and twist it until tight to secure closure of sample port.Use the T-SEAL Mobile to seal the tubing shut by the sample ports. This leaves the tubing available for welding to the tubing set.Place the transfer bag on the hook outside the Finia system.Connect the transfer bag to the Finia disposable set by placing the ends of the tubing into the welding device.Note: The transfer bag line can be welded only onto the supply line/PVC portion of the Finia disposable set. Close the welder and start the welding process.Open the welder and open the weld.Scan the barcode for the material and touch Confirm.Confirm that the weld from the transfer bag to the disposable set is open and touch Continue to start the Finia procedure.Note: The Finia system mixes and cools the cell suspension to the temperature set point. The system pumps three boluses of cell suspension into the mixing bag, after each bolus weighing the bag and reporting the measurement. Then, the system primes each product bag with cell suspension before extracting all air from the product bags. Once the product bags are filled, the bags are automatically sealed and the Finia process is complete.",
    "Carefully remove the product bags and QC bag separately by pulling down the tubing at the top of each bag. Remove and process all product bags before removing any other material from the system. After the bags have been removed, touch Confirm on the screen to store all details of the process on the CPA.In a BSC, open the QC bag and aliquot the contents into cryovials for downstream analysis of the cells.Note: Air is not removed from the QC bag. The contents of the QC bag can be analyzed before or after cryopreservation. On the Finia device, select View Procedure Summary to view the procedure details on the screen.Remove the rest of the disposable set from the system.Use the batch ID to retrieve the batch report from the CPA.Cryopreservation of cells Label and place the product bags into the stainless-steel canisters.Place the canisters into the adjustable freezing rack.Label and place QC cryovials in tube racks.Perform freezing operations using the controlled-rate freezer set to a desired freezing program.Note: The CryoMed program cools at a freezing rate of 1 °C/min from 4 to -40 °C, then at 10 °C per minute cooling rate, until reaching -90 °C end temperature. Transfer the canisters to the accompanying frame.Transfer the QC cryovials into storage boxes and place them in the storage rack.Store the frame and rack into the LN2 vapor phase maintained at -140 °C to -180 °C.Cell phenotype analysis by flow cytometry Follow steps A1–A18 to thaw and record pre-and post-spin cell counts on MSCs and PBMCs.Note: XSFM + 1% P/S was used to thaw MSCs or PBMCs. Add 1 × 105 cells per well into a 96-well V-bottom plate [four technical replicates per sample and fluorescence minus one (FMO) control samples].",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 500× g for 5 min and decant the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL of viability stain solution (see Recipes) or PBS for controls (Zombie FMO and unstained control samples).Incubate for 15 min at RT in the dark.Perform a wash by resuspending the cells in 150 μL of FC buffer (see Recipes).Centrifuge the plate at 500× g for 5 min and decant the supernatant.For PBMC staining only, add 50 μL of Fc block solution (see Recipes) per well to all wells and incubate for 5 min at RT in the dark.Resuspend cell pellets in surface marker stain mixture (see Table 1) or FMO mixture for controls and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark.Table 1.
