    "1. Preparation of Fully Reduced and Fully Oxidized Proteins\nPreparation of a fully reduced protein\n\tNote: Here, we describe the reduction of a zinc-containing protein, and use a ZnCl2 solution to restore the Zn-incorporated, reduced protein state. The ZnCl2 solution can be replaced or discarded. Note that the time and temperature of the reduction process depends on the protein stability and function, and is thus specific per protein.\n\t\nThaw the protein sample on ice and spin it down to remove aggregates. Incubate the sample for at least 1.5 h at 37 °C with 5 mM DTT and 20 µM ZnCl2 (up to 70% of protein concentration).\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature at this step is protein-dependent and should be adjusted to the protein stability.\nRemove DTT using desalting columns.\n\t\tNOTE: There are different desalting columns available. The protocol below describes the procedure using specific desalting columns (see Table of Materials). Before using other desalting columns, we recommend examining their efficiency of DTT removal and protein recovery, since some desalting columns may partially absorb the protein of interest.\n\t\t\nEquilibrate the column with a potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer (40 mM, pH 7.5) by filling the column completely with the buffer and letting the buffer drip out. Repeat this process 2x.\nRemove the white disk filter in the column by gently pushing it down with tweezers and removing it; it is easiest to remove while the column is filled with the KPi buffer. Refill the column with KPi buffer and centrifuge it at 1,000 x g for 3 min.\nTransfer the column into a clean tube, add the protein sample slowly to the middle of the column and centrifuge it at 1,000 x g for 2 min. The DTT-free protein is now in the flow-through.",
    "Check its concentrations (e.g., use a UV/Vis spectrometer) and measure its absorbance at 280 nm. Calculate the protein concentration using Beer's law.\nDistribute half of the protein samples into aliquots. Incubate the aliquots in anaerobic conditions (e.g., using an anaerobic chamber) for 20 min for a complete removal of oxygen. Seal the tubes with plastic film and store the samples at -20 °C or -80 °C, depending on the protein.\n\t\tNOTE: Instead of using the anaerobic chamber, the tubes can also be flashed with argon gas to remove oxygen.\nPreparation of a fully oxidized protein\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to prepare oxidized protein samples from fully reduced proteins (described previously). This will reduce the heterogeneity in oxidation states of cysteines. It is possible to use different oxidizing reagents; here, we are focusing on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).\n\tCAUTION: Avoid over-oxidation as it can lead to undesirable intramolecular disulfide bonds and irreversible oxidation of different amino acids, including cysteine, methionine, tyrosine, and others.\n\t\nTo the remaining protein sample, add 5 mM H2O2 (freshly diluted) and incubate it for 3 h at 40 °C while shaking.\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature at this step is protein-dependent and should be adjusted to the protein stability.\nEquilibrate the column with KPi buffer (40 mM, pH 7.5) by filling the column completely with the buffer and letting the buffer drip out. Repeat this process 2x.\nRemove the white disk filter in the column by gently pushing it down with tweezers and removing it; it is easiest to remove while the column is filled with the KPi buffer.\nRefill the column with KPi buffer and centrifuge it at 1,000 x g for 3 min.",
    "Transfer the column into a clean tube, add the oxidized protein sample slowly to the middle of the column and centrifuge it at 1,000 x g for 2 min; the oxidized protein is now in the flow-through.\nCheck the protein concentrations as in step 1.2.5, divide the oxidized proteins into aliquots, and store them at -20 °C or -80 °C, protein-dependent.\n2. Light Scattering Aggregation Assay\nNote: All concentrations in this assay are chaperone- and substrate-specific, and should be calibrated. All buffers should be 0.22 µm-filtered, as it is extremely important that the buffers are free of any particles or air bubbles and the cuvettes are clean and dust-free. It is very important to use a stirrer placed in the quartz cuvette. Check different stirrer sizes and shapes in order to ensure an efficient mixing of the entire solution without producing undesirable air bubbles. Moreover, there are different flouorospectrometers available in laboratories and facilities. Here, a specific fluorospectrometer (see Table of Materials) was used. Different instruments have a diverse sensitivity, measurement speed, and sampler parameters. Therefore, the exact measurement parameters (e.g., emission and excitation bandwidth, sensitivity, and others) should be optimized using a known aggregation-prone protein and its corresponding conditions. Using citrate synthase (CS) and/or luciferase as initial substrates in nanomolar concentrations is recommended.\nChemical aggregation assay\nPrepare the denatured substrate by incubating 12 µM CS overnight in 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 4.5 M GdnCl. In order to preserve the pH, dissolve the GdnCl in the 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5).\nOpen the fluorospectrometer software and go to Time course measurement. Set the parameters to: Temperature: 25 °C; λem: 360; Em bandwidth: 5 nm; λex: 360; Ex bandwidth: 2.5 nm; and Data interval: 0.5 s.",
    "Prepare the sample by adding 1,600 µL of 40 mM HEPES to a quartz cuvette. Insert the cuvette into the sample holder and let the sample reach the desired temperature.\nSet the stirring to 600 rpm and begin the measurement until a baseline is established. Keep the stirring on for the entire measurement.\nTo measure the CS aggregation in the absence of a chaperone, at 120 s into the measurement, add (gently, but quickly) 10 µL of denatured CS (final concentration of 75 nM). Continue the measurement for 1,200 s.\nTo measure the CS aggregation in the presence of Hsp33, at 60 s into the measurement, add Hsp33 (final concentration of 300 nM). After an additional 60 s, add 10 µL of denatured CS (final concentration of 75 nM). Continue the measurement for 1,200 s.\n\t\tNOTE: When adding the substrate or chaperone, in order to avoid insertion of bubbles, use a 10-µL pipette.\nThermal aggregation assay\n\tNOTE: The temperature for the thermal aggregation assay depends on the protein stability and should be adjusted to each protein independently.\n\t\nOpen the fluorospectrometer software and go to Time course measurement. Set the parameters as follows: Temperature: 43 °C; λem: 360; Emission bandwidth: 5 nm; λex: 360; Excitation bandwidth: 2.5 nm; and Data interval: 0.5 s.\nPrepare the sample by adding 1,600 µL of pre-warmed 40 mM HEPES to a quartz cuvette. Insert the cuvette into the sample holder and let the sample reach 43 °C.\nSet the stirring to 600 rpm and begin the measurement until a baseline is established. Keep the stirring on for the entire measurement.\nTo measure the CS aggregation in the absence of a chaperone, at 120 s into the measurement, gently add CS (final concentration of 125 nM) and continue measuring for 1,200 s.",
    "To measure the CS aggregation in the presence of Hsp33, at 60 s into the measurement, add Hsp33 (final concentration of 600 nM). After an additional 60 s, add CS (final concentration of 125 nM). Continue the measurement for 1,200 s.\n\t\tNOTE: When adding the substrate or chaperone, avoid the insertion of bubbles.\nData analysis and noise removal by Kfits\n\tNote: Kfits is available at use of Kfits has previously been described in Rimon et al.45\nUpload the data file.\n\t\tNOTE: The input is the raw results from light scattering measurements in a textual comma-separated or tab-delimited format.\nTo remove any noise, choose analysis parameters. Use Automatic best model (recommended), mark the Noise is always above signal flag.\nManually remove obvious outliers using the green and red adjustable lines; this step will filter the noise above the green line and below the red line.\nSet the baseline and the fit curve. After applying the noise threshold, download the processed data.\n3. Hydrogen-deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry\nPreparation of buffers and protein samples (Hsp33 and Hsp33-CS complex)\nDilute the protein samples to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 and transfer them to 1.5-mL vials.\nPrepare protein-substrate complex samples by incubating Hsp33 with CS at a ratio of 1:1.5 at 43 °C.\n\t\t\nAdd CS in a step-wise manner to avoid any rapid aggregation and ensure a fruitful binding between the Hsp33 and the thermally unfolded CS.\nUse at least four steps (i.e., each time add a quarter of the final volume) and incubate the samples for 15 min after every addition to allow CS protection by Hsp33.\nRemove any aggregates using a 30-min centrifugation at 16,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: New protein-substrate complexes must be prepared fresh. Substrate addition should be made gradually; otherwise, aggregation will occur. Temperature, substrate, and substrate concentrations are protein-specific.\nPrepare a buffer H (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), which serves as deuteration control, and a buffer D (25 mM Tris-DCl, pH 7.09), which is the deuteration buffer. Also prepare a fresh quenching buffer (150 mM TCEP, 3 M GdnCl, 0.1% formic acid).\n\t\tNOTE: The quenching buffer should be optimized for the protein of interest in order to obtain its maximal sequence coverage after the pepsin digestion.\nTransfer all buffers and samples into vials, and place them in proper trays. Hold buffers H and D at 25 °C (tray 25 °C); on the other hand, hold the samples and quenching buffer at 0 - 2 °C (tray 0 °C). Place the samples in 150-µL glass inserts (see the Table of Materials) first, and then transfer them into vials.\nPreparation of the instrument\n\tNOTE: The mass spectrometer comes with two accompanying software programs: one controls the pumps, and the other controls the mass spectrometer (refer to the Table of Materials). The next steps will be described using these two software programs.\n\t\nManually turn on all cooling units. Once all cooling systems reach their target temperatures, manually switch on both the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and loading pumps.\n\t\tNOTE: In our case, these consist of two cooling baths and a cooling box (which contains the trap and analytical columns). One cooling unit cools the tray at 0 °C, while the other keeps the tray at 25 °C; the temperature of the cooling box is 1 - 2 °C.\nOpen the software which controls both pumps, as well as the software which controls the mass spectrometer; make sure that MS is on Standby.",
    "Disconnect the HPLC outlet valve from the MS source and wash the system first with a \"triple cleaner\" solution (1% formic acid, 33% acetonitrile, 33% isopropanol, 33% methanol), then with buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), and finally with buffer A (0.1% formic acid, pH 2.25), and then insert the pepsin column into the system. If changing buffers, make sure to purge both pumps before proceeding.\nEnsure that the flow-rate for both pumps is 0.1 mL/min and the pressure is stable.\nAfter washing the system with a steady flow and steady pressure, insert the HPLC outlet into the MS source and turn the MS on.\nMass spectrometer parameters\nSet the peptide ionization to electrospray ionization (ESI) at 175 °C, the sheath gas flow at 17, the aux gas glow at 2, and the spray voltage at 4.5 kV (Supplementary Figure 1).\nSet up the parameters as follows for the non-deuterated samples.\n\t\t\nSet the parameters: Scan Range m/z to 300 - 1500; Resolution to 70,000; Automatic gain control target (AGC) to 106; and the Maximum injection time (IT) at 100 ms.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The 5 most intense ions with charge states between +2 and +6 (their intensity higher than 1.3 x 104) and a dynamic window of 30 in will be isolated.\nPerform the ion fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) in the multiple-collision cell with normalized collision energy (NCE) equal to 28. Detect fragment ions by tandem MS at a resolution of 35,000, AGC target of 105, maximum IT at 60 ms, and an isolation window of 2.0 m/z.\nFor the deuterated samples, employ MS1 only with a higher resolution of 140,000 and with otherwise similar parameters.\nRunning the experiment\nSet the trays in the following manner.",
    "Place buffer H and D in Tray 25 °C, then place the samples and quenching buffer in the 0 °C tray.\nPlace X empty vials, aligned in both trays, where X = the number of samples x the number of time points.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the 25 °C tray, the empty vials serve as reaction vials, and in the tray 0 °C, they serve as quenching vials.\nEach of the empty vials contains an empty glass insert; discard and replace said insert between experiments.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In order to run the HDX experiment in the most efficient and least time-consuming way, a software which allows samples to be run simultaneously (Supplementary Figure 2) was used. The next steps will be described using this software.\nOpen the software. Set up the program parameters to perform the following.\n\t\t\nIncubate each sample (5 µL) with 45 µL of buffer D for several minutes, depending on the time points selected (e.g., 1, 3, 18, 40, and 100 min) at 25 °C. Incubate the non-deuterated sample with 45 µL of buffer H instead.\nImmediately after the incubation, mix 50 µL of deuterated protein into 50 µL of ice-cold quenching buffer and inject them into an immobilized pepsin column (20 mm in length, 2.0 mm in diameter).\nElute any peptides from the pepsin column into the pre-column by washing it with buffer A for 6 min at a rate of 50 µL/min. Keep buffer A in the cooling box at 0 °C.",
    "Elute the peptides out of the pre-column into the C18 analytical column (C18 Column, 130 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm x 50 mm, kept at 0 °C) and separate them by applying a linear gradient of acetonitrile at 100 µL/min. Run the acetonitrile gradient using acetonitrile 100% as buffer B: 7 min at 2%, 7 min at 10 - 30%, 2.5 min at 30 - 90%, 1.5 min at 90%, rapid gradient for 1 min at 90 - 8%, and finally equilibrate the column for 4 min at 2%.\nBuild a running sequence (see Supplementary Figure 2): enter all time points, sample names, and locations in the trays, as well as the buffer names and locations.\n\t\tNOTE: The software allows the alignment of all the different running times into a program that runs several samples at once, efficiently decreasing running times.\nData analysis\n\tNOTE: We work with several software programs in the process of data analysis, including Proteome Discoverer and MaxQuant (free software) for the peptide identification and analysis of sequence coverage, as well as HDX workbench, a free software that allows the analysis of the deuterium incorporation in proteins, and a comparison of the HDX rates between different sets of experiments. The next steps will be described using these software programs.\n\t\nAnalyze the peptide coverage of the sample by running the non-deuterated control samples through the software (Supplementary Figure 3). Set up the software using the following parameters.\n\t\t\nUse the Sequest HT method with a No-enzyme (unspecific) cleave. Search for peptides of 4 - 144 amino acids with a mass tolerance of 7 ppm and 0.5 Da for the precursor's ion and fragment. Allow for a dynamic methionine oxidation.",
    "Create a database for the protein, through which the software can determine the peptide coverage. Export the identified peptides in textual format.\nAnalyze the deuterated results using the HDX workbench free software58.\n\t\t\nOpen the protein editor and define the protein by inserting the protein sequence and peptide coverage file.\nNext, open the Setup experiment wizard editor and enter all the inputs requested.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The program requires the number of samples, the number of time points, the number of replicates, the pH value of the buffers, and the temperature.\nFinally, input the parameters regarding the mass spectrometer used, after which the program generates a list of detected peptides.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The software detects the \"HDX\" peptides, inspects isotope clusters, and demonstrates a clear visualization of deuteration in the samples.\nData presentation\nLabel the regions with a deferential deuteration uptake on the structure using the PyMol software or any other visualization software.\nIntroduce the deuterium uptake levels instead of the B-factor values.\n\t\tNote: A basic tutorial can be found at https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Practical_Pymol_for_Beginners.\nSubscription Required.
