    "1. Generation of telencephalic glutamatergic neurons from iPSCs\nNOTE: The detailed protocol for maintaining iPSCs and their differentiation into telencephalic glutamatergic neurons are similar to those described previously18. Here, the critical process during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells is introduced and highlighted.\nCulture iPSCs on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 4 ng/mL).\nAfter incubation with dispase (1 mg/mL) for 3 min, dissociate the iPSCs into small clumps. Then, culture the iPSC aggregates in suspension in the hESC medium for 4 days. Refer to this timepoint, when the iPSCs are starting as the suspension culture, as day 1 (D1). Change the medium daily for 4 days.\nAt D5, collect the iPSC aggregates after centrifugation at 200 x g for 2 min and culture in neural induction media (NIM) for 3 days. Culture the cell aggregates in suspension for 3 days by changing half of the media every 2 days. Add DMH-1 (2 μM) and SB431542 (2 μM) to NIM medium to increase neural induction efficiency.\nAt D8, collect the iPSC aggregates after centrifugation at 200 x g for 2 min and let them adhere to 6 well plates (around 20–30 aggregates per well of the plate) by culturing in NIM with 10% FBS (or with laminin-coated plates) overnight. On the following day, remove the old medium and change to NIM every 2 days until D17.\n\tNOTE: The generation of neuroepithelial cells, which is indicated by the formation of columnar cells with rosette structures, is observed in this period.",
    "At D17, mechanically isolate the neuroepithelial cells in the center of colonies (lifting off directly by applying a small pressure to the center of the colonies) or enzymatically (treated with dispase). Transfer the isolated neuroepithelial cells to non-treated tissue culture T25 flask containing 8 mL of NIM with addition of B27 (1x), cAMP (1 µM), and IGF (10 ng/mL).\n\tNOTE: The suspension culture allows cells to form neurospheres that are enriched with cortical projection neural progenitors.\nAfter D35, plate the neurospheres on the poly-ornithine and LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (Table of Materials)-coated 35 mm glass bottom dishes to generate telencephalic glutamatergic neurons (cortical projection neurons). Before plating, dissociate the neurospheres to small clusters by incubating with 1 mg/mL cell detachment solution for 2 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the cell detachment solution by centrifugation and resuspend in 1 mL of neural differentiation medium (NDM). Plate cells on the glass bottom dish (around five clusters in 100 µL of medium per dish) to let them attach. Then, add NDM (1 mL per dish) and culture the cells in NDM containing B27 (1x), cAMP (1 µM), IGF (10 ng/mL), hBDNF (10 ng/mL), and GDNF (10 ng/mL).\n\tNOTE: Small clusters are plated because they survive well and give rise to long projection neurons. Alternatively, cells can be dissociated and plated at a density around 20,000 cells per dish for better separation.\nCharacterize the telencephalic glutamatergic neurons by immunostaining the Tbr1 and βIII-tubulin markers.\n2. Examination of mitochondrial transport along axons of telencephalic glutamatergic neurons\nWarm up the NDM and turn on the incubator for the fluorescence microscope set at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "To visualize mitochondria along the axons of forebrain neurons, incubate the neurons with 50 nM red fluorescent dye to stain mitochondria in live cells (e.g., MitoTracker CMXRos) in NDM for 3 min at 37 °C. Next, wash cells 2x with warmed NDM. The neurons are incubated in NDM.\nIn order to record the mitochondrial transport along the axons, take time-lapse images of mitochondrial movement using the 40x objective with a fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: To stabilize the culture, perform the live cell imaging when the cells are incubated in the incubator for 20 min following mitochondrial staining.\nUnder phase field, identify the axons based on morphological characteristics (directly emerge from neuronal cell body, constant thin long neurites with no branching). Mitochondria move in anterograde (from cell body to distal axon) and retrograde directions (from axonal terminal to cell body). To distinguish the direction of mitochondrial movement along axons, clearly identify the cell bodies of neurons. In this step, focus axons under phase field to reduce photobleaching.\nAfter distinguishing the cell body and axon, adjust the exposure time and focus of mitochondria in axons. Then, capture the transport of mitochondria within axons every 5 s for a total duration of 5 min, yielding 60 frames. Randomly capture at least five locations for each dish and repeat 3x for each group.\n3. Data analysis of mitochondrial transport and morphology in cortical neurons\nNOTE: Analyze the collected data on mitochondrial transport using an image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ or MetaMorph19). Since ImageJ is readily available, perform the analysis of mitochondrial transport and morphology using ImageJ with the MultiKymograph, Macros, and Analyze particles plugins.\nAnalyzing mitochondrial transport using ImageJ",
    "After capturing the time-lapse images of mitochondrial motility, analyze the velocity and movement of mitochondria using the MultiKymograph plugin. The images are saved as .tiff format files, which are analyzed by Fiji software following a previously reported method20.\nDownload the Fiji software. Download plugins that will be needed for analyzing mitochondrial moving velocity from kymographs. Download the Bio-formats Package and Kymograph Plugin along with these four .class plugins, including: MultipleKymograph.class, MultipleOverlay.class, StackDifference.class, and WalkingAverage.class (Table of Materials). Move these files to the Fiji plugins folder. Download \"tsp050706.txt\" plugins to the plugins folder. Restart the Fiji software when the files are moved to the plugins folder.\nOpen Fiji software. Choose plugins, then import images of the .tiff series through Bio-Formats Importer under Bio-Formats. Make sure to choose Standard ImageJ in Stack viewing, choose Open all series, check Autoscale, then click OK. Take note of the frame number and size of images in pixels, which are displayed on the top of the image.\n\t\tNOTE: Take 60 frames per image.\nConsider making the images clearer by adjusting brightness/contrast under the Image menu for all 60 frames.\nRight-click the line tool to choose segmented line and draw a segmented line starting from the cell body and ending at the terminal axon. Generate the kymograph by choosing MultipleKymograph under Plugins. The selection of line width is prompted after choosing the MultipleKymograph. Ensure that this is an odd number. Choose 1 for the line width. A kymograph is generated after this step.\n\t\tNOTE: Several important pieces of information can be read from the kymograph. The y-axis of kymograph is the time of duration (5 min) for the 60 frames. The x-axis represents the position of the selected axons.",
    "Use a diagonal line in the kymograph to determine the movement direction of mitochondria (anterograde, retrograde, or stable). For example, a line going down to the right along the y-axis indicates anterograde movement, and a line going down to the left along the y-axis indicates retrograde movement. A vertical line indicates that there was no movement in the mitochondrion.\nMeasure the distance, time values, and velocity for the moving mitochondria using the Macros plugin in Fiji software. Go to Plugins | Macros | Install | tsp050607.txt. Draw a segmented line over the trace of mitochondrial movement on the kymograph, and always draw the line from the superior to inferior region (y-axis).\nAfter drawing the line, go to Plugins | Macros | read velocities from tsp. Since a segmented line along the trace is drawn, the plugin reads segmented velocities corresponding to the line.\n\t\tNOTE: The unit for all data is pixels. dy sum is the time consumed from the starting point, and dx sum indicates the distance of the mitochondrion moving in the x-axis. dy now and dx now shows the period time and movement distance for every segment, respectively. actual speed shows the speed for every segment (dx now/dy now). average speed indicates the average speed for the mitochondrial moving (dx sum/dy sum).\nChange the unit of dx now from pixel to µm as the ratio of pixel in µm by measuring the scale bar. Convert the unit for distance from pixel to µm by measuring scale bars in images. Use the line tool to draw a line along the scale bar and measure the length of the line by choose Measure' under \"Analyze. Change the time from pixel to seconds, as 1 pixel = 5 seconds in this experiment.",
    "In the spreadsheet file, calculate the average velocity and correspondingly label retrograde or anterograde movement. Average the anterograde or retrograde movement velocity.\nDetermine the percentage of stationary and motile mitochondria from the kymograph. The anterograde or retrograde moving mitochondria are defined as moving 5 µm forward or backward from the origin during the entire period21. Mitochondria are considered stationary if they did not move more than 5 µm during the 5 min.\nAnalysis of mitochondrial morphology using ImageJ\n\tNOTE: Determine mitochondrial morphology by measuring mitochondrial length, area, and aspect ratio using ImageJ. To do so, follow the steps below.\n\t\nIn order to analyze the mitochondrial length and area within axons, download the Straighten_.jar plugin from ImageJ website (see Table of Materials) and move it to the folder of plugins. Restart ImageJ software.\nOpen the picture through the open function under File and convert the 32 bit image to 8 bit using Type under Image.\nDraw a segmented line along the axons. Choose Straighten under Plugins and set 50 pixels for Width of Filament/Wide Line. This will generate a straightened axon.\nAdjust the threshold under Image and set the measurement under Analyze by choosing \"Area | Perimeter | Fit ellipse | Shape descriptors.\nMeasure the scale bar using the line function and set the scale under Analyze by filling the distance in pixel, know distance, and the unit of length. Then, choose Global to set this scale setting.\nUse Analyze Particles under Analyze to determine the area. The prompt parameters are size (pixel^2) = 0.20–infinity, circularity = 0.00–1.00, and show = ellipses. Choose Display results.\n\t\tNOTE: The measurement will yield the results of multiple mitochondrial morphology parameters including area, perimeters, length (major), width (minor), and aspect ratio (AR). The corresponding mitochondrial number is also listed.",
