    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCase 1: Co-crystallization\nTiming: 3 days to several weeks\nNote: Co-crystallization is the most popular crystallization method. This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 6KBA (with Wy14643); 6LX4 (with fenofibric acid); 6LX5 (with ciprofibrate); 6KYP (with GW9662 + clofibric acid); 6L36 (with GW9662 + fenofibric acid); 6L37 (with GW9662 + ciprofibrate); and 6L38 (with GW9662 + gemfibrozil).\nDilute ligand stock solution with Buffer A.\nNote: A 2-mM ligand solution should be used in the first trial.\nMix 25 μL each of hPPARα-LBD solution (20 mg/mL in Buffer A, either delipidized or not) and the ligand solution in a 1.5-mL plastic tube on ice.\nNote: Concentrations of hPPARα-LBD and the ligand are estimated to be 320 μM (determined by Bradford method-based Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard) and 1 mM, respectively.\nDispense 200 μL of Crystallization Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each well of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4°C.\nMix 1 μL of Crystallization Buffer and 1 μL hPPARα-LBD-ligand mixed solution on the backside of the screw cap at 4°C.\nFasten the screw cap.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Steps 3–6 above should be performed in the cold room (4°C). Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: When crystals (such as Wy14643-bound PPARα-LBD crystals) are used for seeds in cross-seeding, tiny crystals obtained within 1–2 weeks are fine.",
    "Optional: To prepare PPARα-LBD/ligand/coactivator (peptide) crystals, use 0.25 μL ligand solution and 0.25 μL peptide solution (4 mM in water) instead of the 0.5 μL ligand solution. This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 7BPY (with clofibric acid + SRC1); 7BQ0 (with fenofibric acid + SRC1); 7BQ1 (with iFA + SRC1); 7BQ3 (with GW7647 + SRC1); and 7BQ4 (with eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + SRC1).\nNote: To obtain co-crystals with PPARα ligands whose binding affinities are lower than iFAs, the use of delipidized hPPARα-LBD was necessary. Clofibric acid-SRC1 (peptide)-bound delipidized hPPARα-LBD crystals that gave high (2.09 Å) resolution in X-ray crystallography were obtained after a 2-week incubation at 4°C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 30% (w/v) PEG 3350 Crystallization Buffer (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Clofibric acid-SRC1 (peptide)-bound delipidized hPPARα-LBD crystals (PDB: 7BPY)\nClofibric acid is a relatively low-affinity PPARα ligand (the EC50 value for clofibric acid in coactivator recruitment assay is 574 μM, which is slightly higher than iFAs (428 μM for stearic acids and 471 μM for palmitic acid) (Kamata et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])). Clofibric acid-bound hPPARα-LBD co-crystals were only obtained in the presence of SRC1 or GW9662 (PDB: 6KYP) using delipidized proteins. These crystals were used for soaking in bezafibrate (another low-affinity PPARα ligand)-rich buffer to obtain bezafibrate-SRC1-bound crystals (PDB: 7BPZ). Bar, 200 μm.\nCase 2: Cross-seeding\nTiming: 3 days to several weeks",
    "Note: Cross-seeding is generally applied when new protein-ligand co-crystals have not been obtained. Micro-seeds derived from previously obtained crystals of closely related complexes can be used for cross-seeding (Benvenuti and Mangani, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hassell et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; McPherson, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 6KAX (with iFA); 6KB3 and 6KB8 (with GW7647); 6KB4 and 6KB9 (with pemafibrate); 6KB5 (with 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid [ETYA]); 6KB6 (with tetradecylthioacetic acid [TTA]); 6KB7 (with Wy14643); 6LX6 (with palmitic acid); 6LX7 (with stearic acid); 6LX8 (with oleic acid); 6LX9 (with arachidonic acid); 6LXA (with EPA); and 6LXC (with saroglitazar).\nDilute ligand stock solution with Buffer A.\nMix 25 μL each of hPPARα-LBD solution (20 mg/mL in Buffer A, either delipidized or not) and ligand solution in a 1.5-mL plastic tube on ice.\nDispense 200 μL Crystallization Buffer to each well of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4°C.\nMix 1 μL of Crystallization Buffer and 1 μL PPAR-ligand mixed solution on the backside of the screw cap at 4°C.\nFasten the screw cap.\nCrush the seed crystals (Wy14643 or iFA-bound crystals) in 10 μL of Crystallization Buffer (crystal nuclei solution) using a needle tip (Dual-Thickness MicroMounts) at 4°C (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Crush of crystals to prepare crystal nuclei\nScale bars, 200 μm\nNote: Crushing the crystals may produce too many crystal nuclei. Only small numbers of nuclei (obtained by serial dilutions with Crystallization Buffer) are needed. As a rough estimate, the nuclei obtained from the crush of a 10 x 10 x 50 μm crystal could provide 40–80 diffraction quality crystals.\nTransfer the crystal nuclei via a single streak with a human hair to 2 μL mixture of hPPARα-LBD/ligand in Crystallization Buffer (as used in step 10) at 4°C (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig8.jpg",
    "Figure 8. Crystal nuclei transfer to another hPPARα-LBD/other ligand solution using a human hair\n(A) A single streak with a human hair is used for crystal nuclei transfer.\n(B) In some (bad) cases (such as iFA-bound hPPARα-LBD crystals in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5)/25% PEG 3350 buffer), many small crystals form along the lines streaked by the hair.\n(C) In some (good) cases (such as iFA-bound hPPARα-LBD crystals in 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5)/25% PEG 3350 buffer), small numbers of large diffraction quality crystals form independent of the streaked lines. Scale bars, 2 mm (A) or 200 μm (B and C).\nNote: We use our own (young adult males') hairs and have not compared those with commercially available hairs/whiskers of the other animal species such as horses and cats.\nFasten the screw cap.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Steps 9–15 above should be performed in the cold room (4°C). Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: When only small crystals are obtained, repeat the procedure or try other conditions (different buffers) (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B and C) or lower protein concentrations (McPherson and Gavira, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to obtain larger crystals.\nNote: The iFA-bound hPPARα-LBD crystals that gave very high (1.23 Å) resolution in X-ray crystallography were obtained after a 2-week incubation at 4°C in 0.1 M HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 Crystallization Buffer (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. The intrinsic fatty acid (iFA)-bound hPPARα-LBD crystals that gave the highest (1.23 Å) resolution among our 34 crystals\nReported in Kamata et al. (2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (PDB: 6KAX). Scale bar, 200 μm.\nOptional: To prepare hPPARα-LBD/ligand/coactivator (peptide) crystals, use 0.25 μL ligand solution and 0.25 μL peptide solution (4 mM in water) instead of the 0.5 μL ligand solution.\nCase 3: Soaking",
    "Timing: 1 day to 2 weeks\nNote: The resolution of iFA-bound hPPARα-LBD crystals was the highest in our experience (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Therefore, ligand replacement by soaking in iFA-bound crystal solution may produce high-resolution crystals with ligands that have higher affinities than iFAs (such as palmitic and stearic acid). This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 6KAY (with GW7647); 6KAZ (with pemafibrate); 6KB0 (with ETYA); 6KB1 (with TTA); 6KB2 (with Wy14643); and 6LXB (with saroglitazar).\nNote: Obtaining crystals with ligands that are only slightly soluble may be difficult (Hassell et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare iFA-bound crystals by cross-seeding.\nDilute ligand stock solution with Soaking Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Try 1 mM initially.\nDispense 200 μL Soaking Buffer to each well of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4°C.\nPlace 5 μL ligand solution (in Soaking Buffer) on the backside of the screw cap at 4°C.\nPick up the iFA-bound crystals with a CryoLoop, wash the crystals with Soaking Buffer, and soak in 5 μL ligand solution at 4°C (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Transfer of crystals with a CryoLoop for soaking in other ligand solutions\nScale bar, 5 mm.\nNote: The wash step may remove precipitates around crystal surfaces. Some crystals may be cracked in this transfer step, but such fragile crystals do not finally provide high-resolution profiles.\nFasten the screw cap.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nOptional: The iFA-SRC1-bound and clofibric acid-SRC1-bound crystals (PDB: 7BQ1 and 7BPY) were used for soaking to obtain other SRC1-bound crystals; the former was used to prepare co-crystals with pemafibrate + SRC1 (PDB: 7BQ2) and the latter was used to prepare co-crystals with bezafibrate + SRC1 (PDB: 7BPZ).",
    "Critical: Steps 17–22 should be performed in the cold room (4°C). Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: Ligand concentration and incubation time should be optimized for each ligand.\nCryoprotection of crystals for X-ray crystallography\nTiming: 1 h\nMix 400 μL of Crystallization Buffer and 100 μL of 100% (v/v) glycerol (Cryoprotection Buffer) in a 1.5 mL plastic tube.\nMake 5 μL drops of Cryoprotection Buffer on the backside of the screw cap of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4°C.\nPick up the crystals with a CryoLoop, and soak into Cryoprotection Buffer at 4°C.\nFreeze under liquid nitrogen until X-ray diffraction data collection.\nNote: Lowering PEG 3350 concentration (from 25% to 20%) by 100% glycerol dilution could damage crystals or even dissolve them in some cases but not in our case on hPPARα-LBD crystals.\nCritical: The use of liquid nitrogen in a walk-in cold room demands great attention. Only small volumes of liquid nitrogen should be brought into a large well-ventilated room by two or more researchers; oxygen concentrations in this room should be monitored during these procedures. Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20°C–25°C)."
