    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of tumor tissue samples\nTiming: 10 min\nAcquisition of good-quality tissue samples is one of the most important steps to establishing spheroid cells. In this step, we describe the points to which attention should be paid in collecting samples.\nCollect tumor tissue for cell cultivation, and extract DNA or RNA as soon as possible after surgical resection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/484-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of isolation of cancer cells from clinical tissue samples\nThe images correspond to the indicated procedural step. White scale bar, 1 cm; yellow scale bar, 100 μm.\nTumor samples for cultivation are placed on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and transported to the laboratory. Samples for DNA or RNA extraction are washed with PBS, cut into small pieces, placed in cryopreserved tubes, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.\nCritical: Cancer tissues always contain necrotic tissues. It is important to collect fresh and viable tissue samples for efficient cultivation and further analyses. To obtain high-quality samples, contact well-versed gynecologic oncologists or pathologists.\nNote: Because failure of spheroid cultivation can result from insufficient sample size, more than 1 cm3 sample size, if available, is preferable for cell culture.\nIsolation of cancer cells from tissue samples\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, the procedure performed aims to make the collected tissue samples suitable for initial cultivation.\nCritical: This procedure should be started immediately after the surgical resection.\nAlternatives: When unable to immediately perform the procedure after the resection, store the sample at 4°C or on ice in DMEM/F12 and penicillin-streptomycin. Over-storage is not recommended, although viable cells can be obtained from tissue samples after 14–17 h storage.\nWarm a bioshaker to 37°C.\nNote: The bioshaker for cell isolation should be discriminated from that for bacterial cultivation.",
    "Wash the samples with PBS 2 to 3 times for a few seconds.\nCritical: Uterine endometrial cancer tumor samples are sometimes contaminated with bacteria because of pyometra. In such cases, wash samples intensively with PBS to remove surface fragile tissue and liquid to prevent contamination.\nMechanically cut the tumor into small pieces (approximately ~0.5 cm in size) and mince with a disposable sterile scalpel or razor blade.\nTransfer the all tumor to a 50-mL tube and add 10 mL tissue processing buffer, 500 μL collagenase/hyaluronidase (finally 0.5×), 100 μL penicillin/streptomycin (finally 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and 200 μL amphotericin B (finally 5.0 μg/mL).\nOptional: When a large sample can be obtained, the digestion solution should be proportionally increased.\nWe checked the adequate concentration of collagenase/hyaluronidase to dissociate ovarian and endometrial tumor samples, and similar effects were obtained with collagenase/hyaluronidase concentrations ranging from 0.25× to 1×.\nWrap the tube to prevent bacterial contamination.\nShake the tube in the bioshaker at 37°C at 200 rpm for 60 to 120 min\nCritical: To avoid over dissociation, check the sample conditions at 60, 90, and 120 min after the commencement of shaking. Over dissociation is one of the causes of failure of spheroid cultivation. Therefore, when the over-dissociated sample solution appears more turbid and the tumor volume is decreased to approximately one-third of the initial volume, dissociation should be stopped.\nSequentially filter the sample through 100-μm and 70-μm cell strainers, rinse the tube with tissue processing buffer, and filter the rinses through the same cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 267 × g for 10 min at 15°C–25°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in DMEM/F12 medium to a total of 1 mL.\nAdd 4 mL density gradient centrifugation buffer and vortex for a few seconds.",
    "Gently overlay 2 mL DMEM/F12 medium on the solution.\nCentrifuge at 267 × g for 10 min.\nDuring this period, add 5 mL DMEM/F12 medium in a new 15-mL tube.\nCheck the white layer between upper and lower solutions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This layer contains viable cancer cells.\nCarefully transfer the upper solution and the white layer (approximately 2.5 mL) to the new 15 mL tube prepared in step 15 by pipetting with a 1,000 μL tip not to collect the lower density gradient centrifugation buffer layer.\nCentrifuge at 267 × g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\nOptional: Check the cells, and repeat steps 10–18 when many dead cells remain.\nOptional: When many red blood cells form red pellets, add 1 mL ACK lysing buffer into the cell pellet and pipette several times for 10 min. Following this, add 5 mL PBS, and repeat step 18.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL spheroid culture medium and count viable cells with trypan blue staining under a light microscope.\nAdjust concentration at 1 × 104–106 cells/mL in the spheroid culture medium and seed cells to the adequately sized dish.\nIncubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nCritical: Y-27632 can drastically improve the expansion of colon cancer spheroids (Ohata et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Like colon cancer spheroid cells, it is important to add Y-27632 (final concentration of 20 μM) and insulin (10 μg/mL) to the cultivation medium for ovarian cancer spheroid cells (Ishiguro et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In most cases, Y-27632 and insulin are not required for proliferation and maintenance of endometrial cancer spheroid cells (Mori et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: Low cell density (i.e., <1 × 104 cells/mL) is one of the causes of failure of spheroid cultivation. The appropriate size of culture dishes should be selected to maintain cellular concentration.",
    "Cultivation of spheroid cells\nTiming: at least 1 month\nAfter the above initial cultivation, cells should be carefully cultivated until a continuous spheroid cell growth is achieved. This step describes the important points to be noted for continuous cultivation.\nTip the dish for 30 s, remove one-third of the volume of the medium, and add an equal volume of fresh medium every 2–3 days. Fresh medium containing Y-27632 and insulin should be used for ovarian cancer cells.\nAlternatives: Transfer all cells and medium to a 10-mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × g for 5 min, remove one-third of the medium, and add an equal volume of fresh medium. We recommend step 22 rather than this alternative method to avoid stress to cells.\nNote: In most cases, all dissociated cells formed sphere-like structures within the first 1–2 weeks.\nIn cases where sphere-like structures are not formed within 2 weeks, cells generally cannot form spheroid structures even after extended cultivation.\nWhen large sphere-like structures are formed, mechanically dissociate them by gently pipetting up and down with a 1-mL pipette tip.\nCritical: In most cases, the formation and expansion of spheroids should be carefully observed for 1–3 months to confirm stable cell growth. Cell density should be maintained at approximately 1 × 104–1 × 106 cell/mL. Enzymatic dissociation to single cells, which applies significant stress to cells, is not recommended at this initial stage of the spheroid expansion.\nPassage of spheroid cells with enzymatic dissociation\nTiming: 30 min to 2 h\nTo maintain the spheroid cells, regular passaging is critical. In this step, the process for passaging the spheroid cells is described.",
    "Note: When cells achieve continuous growth, test the possibility of passage with enzyme using some of the growing cells. For initial some passages, cells should be diluted at a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. Verify the established spheroid cell lines when cells stably grow after enzymatic dissociation multiple times. Once cultivation is stable, change the medium every 2–3 days described as above (step 22) and passage the spheroid cells every 10–14 days. The dilution rate (1:2 to 1:5) is selected according to the cell condition.\nCollect cells in 15 mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd adequate dissociation reagent solution (approximately 1 mL per 1 × 105–1 × 106 cells).\nNote: Because conditions required for cellular dissociation are different among spheroid cells, dissociation conditions (we use Accumax (Innovative cell technologies) and Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and only pipetting) should be determined for each spheroid at the initial passage. Accumax and Accutase are the most efficient reagents we have tried for our endometrial and ovarian cancer spheroid cells.\nPipette cells up and down 10–20 times with a 200-μL tip and incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min. Repeat this procedure until the cells are mostly dissociated.\nAlternatives: When the cell aliquot is over 200 μL, a 1000-μL or 5-mL pipette combined with a 200-μL tip is useful.\nOptional: Density gradient centrifugation (steps 10–18) is useful to remove non-viable cells after dissociation.\nAdd 3–5 volumes of PBS, centrifuge at 267 × g for 10 min, discard the supernatant, resuspend with new spheroid culture medium, and seed in a new cultivation dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/484-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Images of uterine endometrial cancer spheroid cells\n(Left) After dissociation.\n(Right) At day 7. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nCryopreservation of spheroid cells\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Spheroid cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen. This step describes the process for cryopreservation of spheroid cells.\nCollect cells in a 15-mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the pellet in STEM-CELL BANKER.\nDispense the cell suspension to cryopreservation vials.\nStore at −80°C freezer for 14–17 h, following to transfer in liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: We generally used small-sized spheroid cells (i.e., spheroids formed 3 to 5 days after passage). Storage at low density (less than 1 × 104 cells/mL) may cause recovery failure after thawing. Supplementation with Y-27632 (20 μM) in STEM-CELL BANKER seems beneficial for ovarian cancer cell viability. Cells can be stored for over 1 year in liquid nitrogen.\nRevival of spheroid cells\nTiming: 10 min\nCryopreserved spheroid cells can be easily revived according to the below process.\nRemove the frozen vials from liquid nitrogen and thaw quickly in a 37°C water bath for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 267 × g for 10 min and gently remove the supernatant.\nGently suspend the cell pellets in 1 mL spheroid culture medium and plate in a new culture dish.\nContinue further cultivation according to the Cultivation and Passage of spheroid cells (steps 22, 24–27).\nAlternatives: To remove enough STEM-CELL BANKER, the below-mentioned procedure can be performed before step 33.\n∗Transfer the dissolved cell solution into a new 15-mL tube containing 5 mL of spheroid culture medium.\nNote: The first passage with enzymatic dissociation after the revival of spheroid cells should be performed with the longer interval (2–3 weeks) than that for the regular passage.\nPreparation of spheroid cell block\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Histological examination, including hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunostaining, can show the characteristics of spheroid cells. For this purpose, a spheroid cell block can be prepared using the protocol below.\nNote: The paraffin-embedded cell blocks with standard procedures are a useful strategy to stain spheroid cells. The cells can be evaluated by hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunostaining with the standard protocol for paraffin-embedded sections. See Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 in our original report (Ishiguro et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCollect cells in a 15-mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 to 3 h.\nCentrifuge at 267 × g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\nEmbed the cell pellet into paraffin blocks according to the standard protocol for paraffin embedding of tissue samples."
