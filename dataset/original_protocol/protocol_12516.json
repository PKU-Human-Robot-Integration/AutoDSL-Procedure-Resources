    "Below, a detailed protocol for the construction of the different parts of the setup is described considering a system of 18 columns.\n1. Constructing the frame holding the columns\nPrepare acrylic plates to hold the irrigation system, the columns, the funnels, and the pipes to collect the leachate.\n\t\nCut three acrylic plates (acrylic plates 1-3) with dimensions of 63 cm x 67 cm and one acrylic plate (acrylic plate 4) with dimensions of 45 cm x 56 cm.\nOn each acrylic plate, cut 18 holes following the instructions in the steps below.\n\t\t\nAcrylic plate 1 - top plate: cut holes of diameter 0.7 cm to insert the tubes of the irrigation system later.\nAcrylic plate 2 - second from the top plate: cut holes of diameter 8 cm to insert the columns later (Figure 2).\nAcrylic plate 3 - second from the bottom plate: cut holes of diameter 1.2 cm to insert the funnels later.\nAcrylic plate 4 - bottom plate: cut holes of diameter 1.2 cm to insert later the plastic pipes that bring the leachate to the jerrycans.\nAdditionally, cut one hole of diameter 1.1 cm at every corner and one hole of diameter 1.1 cm on the sides of acrylic plates 1-3 to insert the stainless-steel screws.\nFor each acrylic plate, print plastic labels with the numbers of the columns (1-18) using a label printer and stick them below the respective hole.\n\t\tNOTE: Sticking labels on acrylic plates 2, 3, and 4 according to the number of the 18 columns aids in placing the different parts of the setup at their respective location during its installation.\nUse stainless steel plates and screws to hold the acrylic plates.",
    "Take the tailored-made stainless steel plates, which have been made following the design shown in Figure 3 with dimensions 63.6 cm x 67.3 cm x 4 cm and a thickness of 1.5 mm.\nDrill holes of diameter 1.1 cm at every corner and on the sides of each stainless-steel plate.\nTake stainless steel screws (50 cm in length).\nInsert acrylic plates following the order from top to bottom for acrylic plates 1 (irrigation tubes), 2 (columns), and 3 (funnels) on the stainless-steel screws. Use two hexagon nuts and two washer carriers for each corner to keep the acrylic plate in place.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep enough distance between each acrylic plate to insert the different components later. Maintain a distance of ~19.5 cm from acrylic plate 1 to acrylic plate 2, ~10.5 cm from acrylic plate 2 to acrylic plate 3, and ~16.5 cm from acrylic plate 3 to acrylic plate 4.\nInstall top and bottom stainless-steel plates on the stainless-steel screws using two hexagon nuts and two washer carriers for each corner.\nPlace the whole system on top of the fridge after the construction of the refrigerator system is completed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic top view of the design of acrylic plate 2 where the columns are placed.

Constructing the refrigerator system for the leachate collection\nSet up the fridge to place the jerrycans.\n\t\nRemove both lids from the fridge and replace the back lid with acrylic plate 4.",
    "NOTE: Once installed, this acrylic plate is not supposed to be removed. To work inside the fridge, remove the front lid by lifting it.\nPlace the fridge in the climate chamber and plug it in.\nSet the fridge temperature to 4 °C and place a datalogger inside of the fridge.\nClose the fridge with the front lid.\nMonitor the data recorded by the datalogger overnight. If the temperature deviates from the desired value, remove the lattice at the bottom of the fridge and adjust the temperature. Repeat this procedure until the desired temperature is reached.\nUse polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes to connect the funnels to the jerrycans.\n\t\nCut 18 PVC pipes (internal diameter 0.8 cm) with an appropriate length to reach each jerrycan from the different funnels according to the respective numbers.\n\t\tNOTE: Length varies from a minimum of 38 cm for the shortest tube to a maximum of 81 cm for the longest tube.\nRinse the pipes in demi-water before their first use; in any other case, soak them for 4 days in 50 L of water where 30 g of the citric acid product was diluted to remove carbonate precipitates. Afterward, rinse the pipes again with demi-water.\n\t\tCAUTION: even if the product for citric acid is safe to use, avoid contact with eyes and prolonged contact with skin by using proper protective measures.\n\t\tNOTE: if ultrapure water is available, it is preferable to use it instead of demi-water.\nLet the pipes air-dry for 24 h.\nInsert the pipes in acrylic plate 4 according to their respective numbers.\nInstall funnels to direct the leachate to the jerrycans.\n\t\nWipe 18 funnels with ethanol before their first usage; in any other case, follow the same procedure stated for the PVC pipes.",
    "CAUTION: Ethanol is inflammable and can cause irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract, dizziness, and shallow respiration. Ethanol is harmful by ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption.\nInsert the funnels in acrylic plate 3 and connect them to the respective pipes according to their numbers.\nInstall jerrycans to collect the leachate.\n\t\nTake 10 high-density polyethylene (HDPE) jerrycans with a capacity of 10 L and 8 HDPE jerrycans with a capacity of 5 L.\n\t\tNOTE: Jerrycans of 5 L are used for low irrigation rates, while jerrycans of 10 L are used for high irrigation rates (see Table 1). Jerrycans in HDPE are chosen as this material is chemically inert.\nDilute 50 mL of dishwasher soap in 10 L tap water. Rinse the jerrycans once with this solution, once with tap water, and once with demi-water. Repeat this cleaning procedure before any other usage.\n\t\tNOTE: if ultrapure water is available, it is preferable to use it instead of demi-water.\nLet the jerrycans air-dry for 24 h.\nDrill a hole in the lid of each jerrycan of diameter 1.2 cm to insert the plastic tube to collect the leachate.\nClose the jerrycans with the respective lid.\nPlace the jerrycans in the fridge into two layers following the scheme shown in Figure 4 while simultaneously connecting the tubes to the jerrycans.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Schematic overview of the jerrycans inside of the fridge into two stacked layers, bottom (left side) and top layer (right side).

Constructing the columns and the mesh system\nUse PVC columns as mesocosms to incubate rock powder and soil organisms",
    "Cut the PVC tubes into 18 columns with a length of 15 cm.\nClean the columns following procedure 1 if it is for their first usage and procedure 2 in any other case.\n\t\t\nProcedure 1:\n\t\t\t\nSoak the columns in demi-water for 48 h.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: if ultrapure water is available, it is preferable to use it instead of demi-water.\nRinse the columns with demi-water. Dry and wipe the columns with ethanol.\nNumber the columns using labels or directly with a marker on the tube.\nProcedure 2:\n\t\t\t\nSoak the columns in water for 1 day.\nUse the brush to scrub away any experimental remnants.\nDry and wipe the columns with ethanol.\nUse middle rings to hold columns above the funnels.\n\t\nWith a 3D printer, design a ring (diameter of 8.5 cm and thickness of 0.5 cm). Make sure to draw another ring at the bottom that fits in the holes of acrylic plate 2 for more stability of the columns (Figure 5).\nPrint 18 rings with the 3D printer using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) 95A material.\nPlace the rings on the columns in a position that maintains the columns 2-3 cm above the funnels.\nUse a mesh system at the bottom of the columns to filter the leachate and minimize losses of particles.\n\t\nCut the mesh (10 µm and 20 µm pore size) into squares of 12 cm x 12 cm.\nSoak the mesh in ultrapure water for 2 days. Leave the mesh to air-dry.\nAt the bottom of the column, place the first mesh of 20 µm. Place a 1 cm layer of plastic beads over the 20 µm mesh.\nPlace the second mesh of 10 µm on top of the 20 µm mesh and the layer of plastic beads.",
    "Place two cable ties to keep the mesh system in place. Tighten the cable ties and cut their edges.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 6 shows how the mesh system should be assembled at the bottom of the column.\nUse a top mesh to avoid earthworms' escape.\n\t\nCut the mesh of 1 mm pore size into squares of 12 cm x 12 cm.\nOnce the columns are filled with rock powder, and earthworms are introduced (section 7), place the mesh on top of the columns.\n\t\tNOTE: This mesh should be placed on top of the columns to prevent earthworms from escaping the columns. In case earthworms are not introduced, it is still recommended to use this mesh to maintain the same conditions for all the columns.\nPlace a rubber band around the mesh to keep it in place.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Model of the ring to hold the columns for the 3D printer.

Constructing the irrigation system\nDesign and create sprinklers to spread water evenly over the columns\n\t\nWith a 3D printer, make a design for a sprinkler following the model and relative dimensions shown in Figure 7.\nPrint 18 sprinklers with the 3D printer using TPU 95A material.\n\t\tNOTE: After printing, let the sprinklers dry for at least 24 h before inserting them into the PE micro hoses to avoid breaking them.\nInstall the irrigation system: valves and tubes.\n\t\nScrew two nose pieces on the front of two solenoid valves, and screw two T-piece plug-in fittings at the back of the solenoid valves.",
    "NOTE: If one wants the water hose to end with this system and not to continue to other systems, screw on the back of the valve that will be placed towards the end of the fridge a plug-in fitting with two connections instead of the T-piece plug-in fitting. In this way, the water connection ends here.\nInstall the two solenoid valves on one side of the top stainless-steel plate.\n\t\tNOTE: One valve controls one irrigation tube, which in turn irrigates 8 or 10 columns of the total 18 columns.\nCut the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) irrigation pipe into two tubes of 53 cm.\nClose one side of each tube with an end cap.\nWrap the other end of the tubes in polytetrafluoroethylene (PFTE) tape and connect it to the solenoid valves.\nMake 8 holes in the first irrigation tube closer to the front of the fridge and make 10 holes in the second irrigation tube farther from the front of the fridge.\n\t\tNOTE: it is very important to make the holes using a hand punch, as this is necessary for the correct positioning and functioning of the pressure regulators. Using other tools as a drill is discouraged.\nInsert the pressure regulators into the holes of the two tubes.\nCut the polyethylene (PE) micro hose into 18 small tubes of a length of 20 cm to reach the columns from the irrigation pipe and attach them to the pressure regulators.\nInsert the small tubes into the holes of acrylic plate 1.\nInsert the sprinklers into the small tubes horizontally to the surface of the columns.",
    "NOTE: If one runs into issues with the irrigation system (e.g., blockages in the water flow or uncontrollable water flow), this can be because of: (a) malfunctioning of the valves, (b) particles remaining in the tube; (c) PFTE tape not wrapped properly around the end of the tube. For point a, replace the valve. For points b and c, be sure that the tubes are cleaned before starting the watering of the columns and that no residues of the PFTE tape hang from the tube respectively. It is important to avoid any transfer of particles that could prevent the valve from functioning correctly.\nSet up the connection for the transport of water.\n\t\nCut the polyurethane (PU) hose into three different hoses for the water connection. The exact lengths of the hoses vary depending on the design of the system and the chamber. Use the first hose to connect the T-piece of the first valve to the tap, the second hose to connect the T-pieces of each valve, and the third hose to connect the T-piece of the second valve to the next system.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is no need for a connection to the next system, cutting the third hose is unnecessary.\nConnect the PU hoses to the T-piece plug-in fittings on the back of the solenoid valves.\nConnect the PU hose of the first valve with the tap by screwing a plug-in fitting with two connections on the adapter ring.\nOpen the tap to allow water to flow into the tubes.\nInstall the control system and set up the connection to the irrigation system.\n\t\nConnect the web-enabled controller, the eight-relay expansion module, and the rail power supply. Place them into the polycarbonate enclosure following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.",
    "NOTE: One modular controller corresponds to one device, which in turn controls eight relays. One relay controls the opening and closing of one specific valve.\nConnect the two valves with each other using the electrical cables, and connect the power cable to each valve.\nConnect the other end of the power cable to the web-enabled controller.\nConnect everything to an electrical plug and make an internet connection for the web-enabled controller.\nSet up the online control of irrigation settings to set the irrigation rates.\n\t\nFollow the instructions provided by the manufacturer for configuration and setup. For programming and testing, use the web browser.\nGo to http://10.73.10.250/setup.html.\nUse a username and password to log in.\nOn the left menu, go to Control/Logic and then to Tasks/Functions.\nOne relay controls the opening and closing of one valve. For each relay, there are two tasks, one turns the relay on (valve open), and the other turns the relay off (valve closed). To change the setting of each task, click on Edit.\n\t\t\nWhen the task of the relay is to be set on, set the date and time at which the relay must start working by clicking on Start Date and Start Time (e.g., 4th May 2022 at 7:45:00; see Figure 8). To set the watering frequency, click on Set Repeat and Repeat Every (e.g., daily every 1 day(s) for a watering frequency of once a day; see Figure 8). To set the date at which the relay stops working, click on End Repeat Date (e.g., 20th May 2022 at 23:59:59; see Figure 8).",
    "When the task for the relay is to be set off, set the time at which the relay must stop working. This depends on the water irrigation rate required and the watering frequency, e.g., set the time at 7:46:30 for a daily repeat. This means the relay works for 1 min 30 s, for the amount of water of 50 mL·day-1 at the watering frequency of once a day (see Table 1). The start and end dates are the same as the task for setting the relay on, as well as the watering frequency.\nWhen the setup of each relay is done, remember to click on Save Changes.\n\t\tNOTE: Not all relays must be working simultaneously, to prevent overloading the system. Always leave at least 30 s in between the tasks of different relays (e.g., relay 1 of device 1 ends its task at 07:46:30, relay 2 of device 1 starts its task at 07:47:00).\nCheck that the settings of each relay have the same Start Date and End Date. Table 1 shows an example of the time needed for different water irrigation rates at different watering frequencies.\n\t\t​NOTE: The irrigation system allows for more water irrigation rates and watering frequencies besides the ones listed, but it needs to be tested for how long the valves need to stay open for different amounts of water. For the irrigation rates listed in Table 1, it is still good to check with a first test whether this is valid, as it might change according to water pressure and the design of the system.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563fig07.jpg\nFigure 7: Model of the sprinkler for the irrigation system with relative dimensions.

Selecting rock powders, organic materials, and soil biota\nNOTE: For this experiment, rock powders, organic materials, and soil organisms are selected based on availability, local occurrence, and literature review. Additionally, microbes are selected based on their non-pathogenicity, determined by the classification of the technical rules for biological agents (TRBA)26,27,28. Depending on the exact research question, these factors may be adjusted.\nSelect rock powders for the experiments.\n\tNOTE: The rock powders that are selected for these experiments are both ultramafic and mafic rocks of various mineralogical compositions, such as dunite and diabase. Each rock has two main classes of grain sizes, fine (micrometer range) and coarse (millimeter range).\nSelect organic materials for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The organic materials that are selected for these experiments as a food source for soil biota are wheat straw and digestate from manure and animal feed residues.\nSelect the bacteria for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The bacteria that are selected for these experiments are Bacillus subtilis and Cupriavidus metallidurans. Bacteria are sourced from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ (Germany).\n\t\nGrow bacteria in nutrient broth, consisting of bacto peptone (10 g·L-1), meat extract (3 g·L-1), and sodium chloride (10 g·L-1) dissolved in ultrapure water (18.2 mΩ), following the supplier's instructions.\nAutoclave all culture media at 121 °C for 20 min prior to inoculation with the old culture (volume = 1% of new culture).",
    "Determine the cell densities via cell counting with a hemacytometer and verify the cell counts via flow cytometry.\n\t\tNOTE: This study used a flow cytometer equipped with violet (405 nm) and blue (488 nm) lasers, with a flow rate of 10 µL/min, and detected in the FL1 channel (EX 488, EM 525/40).\nSelect the fungi for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The fungi that are selected for these experiments are Knufia petricola, Suillus variegatus, and Aerobasidium pullulans. Fungi are sourced from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ (Germany), except K. petricola, which is sourced from the Westerdijk Institute (The Netherlands).\n\t\nGrow the fungi cultures in malt extract broth, consisting of malt extract (20 g·L-1), D-(+)-glucose (20 g·L-1), and casein hydrolysate (3 g·L-1) dissolved in ultrapure water (18.2 mΩ), following the suppliers' instructions.\nAutoclave all culture media at 121 °C for 20 min prior to inoculation with the old culture (volume = 1% of new culture). Determine the cell densities via cell counting with a hemacytometer.\nSelect earthworms for the experiment.\n\t​NOTE: The earthworms that are selected for these experiments are the endogeic species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica. Earthworms are collected from the park De Blauwe Bergen near Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands (51°58'51.8\"N 5°39'38.0\"E) before the experiment.\n6. Filling the columns\nDetermine the water holding capacity (WHC) of the rock powders and of the organic materials by first drying each material at 105 °C. Then, place the dry material in a bowl and record the weight. Add water little by little until the materials are wet enough and record the final weight. The WHC is then given by Equation 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563eq01.jpg (1)\nGrind the straw through a 6 mm grinder.\nOven-dry the minerals and organic materials at 40 °C for 2 consecutive days.",
    "Weigh 400 g of minerals and 10 g of organic materials in a bowl.\n\tNOTE: Amounts can be adapted according to experimental needs, but the material mixture should fit inside the column.\nAdjust the WHC to 80% according to mineral type, mineral grain size, and organic source present.\nMix everything carefully with a metal spoon.\nFill the columns with the mixture.\nPlace the filled columns in the climate chamber at their respective location, as demonstrated in Figure 2. If the columns cannot be placed immediately in the climate chamber, store them at 15 °C, and cover them with a plastic sheet to prevent water losses and to limit changes in the initial conditions.\n\tNOTE: Hold columns at the bottom and insert them with care in the acrylic plates to avoid loss of their contents. Figure 9 illustrates schematically the steps that should be followed to fill the columns.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65563/65563fig09.jpg\nFigure 9: Schematic overview of the different steps for filling the columns.

Soil biota inoculation\nInoculate bacteria and fungi at two moments while filling the columns (Method 1) or just before earthworm addition (Method 2).\n\t\nMethod 1\n\t\t\nDepending on the desired inoculation density (a range of cell densities between 1.5 x 109 and 4.8 x 1010 cells per column for bacteria and between 5.5 x 107 and 5.5 x 108 cells per column for fungi), inoculate the different microbial species to the mixture of minerals and organic materials once the water has been added according to treatment by using a pipette.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The added water needs to be adjusted accordingly in a way that the amount (milliliters) that is added through inoculation is subtracted from the total amount of water that is added to reach 80% of the WHC.",
    "Mix everything carefully with a metal spoon.\nFill the columns with the mixture.\nWipe the bowl and the spoon used to mix the materials with ethanol for successive use.\nCover the columns with the top mesh.\nMethod 2:\n\t\t\nDepending on the desired inoculation density, inoculate the different microbial species on the surface of the columns according to treatment by using a pipette.\nCover the columns with the top mesh.\nDepending on the desired density (either 4, 8, or 10 earthworms per column), introduce earthworms in the columns according to treatment by gently depositing them on the surface of the columns. Afterward, cover the column with the top mesh.\n\t​NOTE: Both microbes and earthworms should be inoculated 1 day before the watering starts to allow them to adapt to the system. Inoculation density can be changed according to experimental needs. Be aware that this is not a sterile environment, and there can be potential contamination with microorganisms transported by air, water, or input material. To prevent bacterial contamination from ventilation, add a 0.2 µm filter on top of the columns.\n8. Samples collection and analyses\nRemove the columns from the chamber at the end of the experimental period.\n\t\nCollect earthworms and count them to determine their survival rate and assess their activity.\nHomogenize the mixture of rock powder and organic materials and take subsamples for microbial analyses to further characterize the presence and activity of the microorganisms of interest.\nDry the content of the columns at 40 °C for 5-7 days for subsequent solid phase analyses for solid inorganic carbon (SIC).\nWeigh the jerrycans to determine the final leachate volume and collect leachate samples for further analyses, such as TA, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, EC, and ions.",
    "The experimental endpoint is to determine whether soil organisms can enhance weathering rates in this system and to find the optimal combination of the variables considered, which leads to the highest carbon sequestration potential. Determine this by comparing results for the analyzed parameters according to the different combinations.\n\tNOTE: The sampling strategy and further analyses can be adjusted according to experimental settings and research needs."
