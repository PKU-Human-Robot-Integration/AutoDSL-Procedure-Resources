    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExtraction of supernatant containing the sex-inducing substance from flatworms (Day 1)\nTiming: 1 day\nThe flatworm of interest is homogenized, and the supernatant is collected by centrifugation. The sex-inducing activity is mainly present in the supernatant. A schematic flow of this step is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Summary of how to prepare Frs. M0-M100\nUnless specified, all steps should be performed at 4°C or on ice.\nPrepare 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3085_2.csv\nHomogenize 8 g of the flatworm. We used, for example, a Potter-type 10 mL homogenizer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Homogenization is done 1 g at a time and repeated eight times.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

When no fragments are visible, repeat the strokes 20 more times (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: Work while cooling with ice as heat is generated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Note: The intensity of homogenization should be varied depending on the hardness of the flatworms used; for example, the intensity should be adjusted so that flatworms of any hardness are homogenized at an average of about 3,000 rpm. In the case of C. calicophorum, for example, it takes approximately 4–5 s per stroke (round trip) and approximately 25 strokes before the worm fragments are no longer visible.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. How to homogenize, related to step 2\n    \nTransfer the sample to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube labeled \"Homogenized\" by decantation. Also, rinse the homogenizer (including the rod) with Milli-Q water and collect the remaining sample (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nAdd Milli-Q water and fill up to 30 mL.\nKeep the samples on ice until the next step (step 3).\nSonicate the homogenized sample.\nSonicate continuously for 2 min 30 s, while moving the sample tube evenly (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D; Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: For ultrasonic intensity, about 30% of the maximum output of a typical ultrasonic device would be appropriate. For example, in our device (Ultrasonic disruptor Model UR-200P, TOMY Seiko, Japan), we set the output dial to 3.5 out of 11 levels (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: Work while cooling with ice as heat is generated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCritical: The tube will be damaged by prolonged contact with the ultrasonic device in the same place, leaking fluid.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. How to sonicate, related to step 3\n    \nKeep the samples on ice until the next step (step 4).\nCentrifugation and supernatant collection.\nCool the centrifuge and rotor to 4°C prior to centrifugation.\nBalance the weight of tubes.\nNote: Add Milli-Q water little by little to balance the tubes.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 g (4°C) for 30 min (at speed).",
    "Transfer the supernatant to 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes.\nIf it is the first round (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), transfer to the tubes labeled with \"Supernatant: 1st round\" by decantation.\nIf it is the second round (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), transfer to the tubes labeled with \"Supernatant: 2nd round\" by decantation; after decanting, collect the remaining sample using a P1000 micropipette.\nKeep the samples on ice until the next step (step 5).\nTo increase the efficiency of the extraction of the sex-inducing substance, the substance remaining in the precipitate that is not recovered in the supernatant is extracted by a second-round extraction.\nRepeat steps 2–4 with the precipitate instead of 1 g of flatworms.\nAdd about 3 mL of Milli-Q water to the precipitate in the 50 mL tube and float the precipitate with a spatula.\nQuickly decant the floating precipitate into a homogenizer.\nNote: Transfer the precipitate to the homogenization tube with a slight shaking motion. Without some momentum, only water will be transferred, and the precipitate will remain in the 50 mL tube.\nAdd an additional 2 mL of Milli-Q water to the 50 mL tube and collect as much of the remaining precipitate as possible.\nPerform homogenization (see step 2) on the precipitate collected in a total of 5 mL of Milli-Q water.\nReturn the homogenized sample to the same 50 mL tube and repeat sonication and centrifugation (see steps 3 and 4).\nKeep the samples on ice until the next step (step 6).\nNote: Using the planarian Bdellocephala brunnea, we confirmed that the second-round extracts also have sufficient sex-inducing activity (Kobayashi, unpublished data). The third-round extracts still have some activity, but we do not perform a third extraction to improve the working efficiency.\nSample filtration.",
    "Set up NALGENE Rapid-Flow 0.2 μm PES Filters (Nalge Nunc International) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F) using, for example, a clean glass bottle.\nPerform filtration on all samples (total 480 mL). Both first- and second-round extracts can be mixed.\nKeep the samples on ice until the next step (step 7).\nNote: When the filter becomes clogged, replace it with a new one. We often use two for the fluke C. calicophorum.\nOptional: If the above described filtration system is not available, a syringe (e.g., TERUMO Disposable 10 mL syringe, TERUMO, Japan) and filter (e.g., Millex-GV Syringe-driven 0.22 μm PVDF Filter Unit, Merck Millipore, USA) can be used. However, this is not recommended for the following reasons: (1) it requires a lot of force, (2) the solution passes through the filter very slowly, (3) the filter is easily clogged, resulting in a lot of labor and sample loss due to frequent filter changes, and (4) many filters need to be consumed, which is costly.\nUltracentrifugation and supernatant collection.\nCool the rotor at 4°C, for example, by using a cold room or refrigerator, prior to ultracentrifugation.\nNote: The ultracentrifuge itself does not need to be specifically pre-cooled, since condensation caused by cooling would take extra time to depressurize.\nTransfer 15 mL of the filtered supernatant into each tube for ultracentrifugation.\nNote: The amount of sample that can be ultracentrifuged at one time depends on the centrifuge model available and should be adjusted accordingly.\nBalance the weight of the tubes.\nNote: Add Milli-Q water little by little to balance the tubes.\nCentrifuge at 120,000 g (4°C) for 40 min (at start).\nCritical: Carefully handle the large ultracentrifuge. It can be very dangerous if used incorrectly. The balanced pair of the tubes must be placed on the diagonal of the rotor.",
    "Collect every last drop of supernatant carefully with a P1000 micropipette and transfer to 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes labeled \"Ultra-supernatant\".\nNote: Our ultracentrifuge is capable of running 15 mL × 12 tubes at a time, so the entire sample is ultracentrifuged three times, resulting in approximately 14 ″Ultra-supernatant\" tubes.\nWhen about 30–40 mL of the sample has accumulated in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube, freeze the samples at −80°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Freeze-drying of the flatworm extract\n(A) Freezing with tubes tilted to increase the surface area of the frozen sample.\n(B) Bad example: use of tube stands made of insulating material during freezing.\n(C) Freeze-drying.\n(D) Example of a sample tube with a lid made of medicinal powder paper with multiple needle holes.\n(E) Cock in the \"ventilation\" state.\n(F) Cock in the \"vacuum\" state.\n(G) Lyophilization bottle shielded from light by aluminium foil.\nCritical: To increase the efficiency of freeze-drying in the later step, the tubes should be tilted slightly while freezing so that the surface area of the frozen sample becomes larger (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). However, it should be done in a stable place in a deep freezer.\nCritical: Do not use tube stands with insulation materials such as Styrofoam during freezing (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), as the temperature difference inside the tube will delay the timing of freezing at the bottom, resulting in tube breakage.\nPause point: The sample has a sufficient sex-inducing activity for 6 months when stored at −80°C. Longer periods may be acceptable but have not been tested.\nFreeze-drying of the extracted supernatants (Day 2–5)\nTiming: 4 days\nFreeze-dry the extracted supernatant. Follow the instructions for the use of the available lyophilizer.\nPreparation for freeze-drying.\nTurn on a lyophilizer and set it to low temperature and low pressure.",
    "Chill the lyophilization bottle (the part of the glass bottle in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) at −20°C.\nTake off the lid of the 50 mL tubes containing the sample.\nCover it with a sheet of medicinal powder paper.\nSecure it with a rubber band, and puncture about 10 holes with a needle (e.g., TERUMO syringe needle 18G, TERUMO, Japan) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nKeep it at −80°C until set in the lyophilizer.\nNote: The rubber part (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) of the lyophilization bottle will harden when cooled, making it difficult to fit, so cool the glass part (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) only.\nNote: Any freeze-dried sample powder that may get on the medicinal powder paper lid can be flicked off with a finger and dropped into the tube.\nPerform freeze-drying.\nPlace the sample tube upright in the lyophilization bottle and quickly place it in the lyophilizer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: Wear gloves (1) to prevent the sample from melting at your body temperature and (2) to protect your hands since the bottles are very cold, but be aware that the tubes and bottles become slippery.\nImmediately open the cock (from the state “ventilation” shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E to the state “vacuum” shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F) and start freeze-drying.\nCritical: Do this quickly before the sample thaws. If it thaws even slightly, freeze again. However, the sample freshly removed from −80°C will not thaw immediately, so set it calmly.\nCritical: Be aware of the sunlight and UV light throughout the entire protocol, since the sex-inducing substance is an unknown compound, and the possibility of degradation by UV cannot be ruled out. Use aluminum foil as appropriate (e.g., Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).\nAllow 3–4 days to complete freeze-drying.",
    "Pause point: The freeze-dried powder can be stored at −80°C with the tubes upright. The sample has sufficient sex-inducing activity for 6 months when stored at −80°C. Longer periods may be acceptable but have not been tested.\nFractionation by open-column chromatography (Day 6–7)\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, the extracted supernatant is fractionated by open-column chromatography to Fr. M0, M10, M30, M50, and M100 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The sex-inducing substance is eluted in Fr. M30.\nThe reason for fractionating into five fractions is as follows. Since the sex-inducing substance is an unknown compound, it cannot be ruled out that the elution time may shift due to, for example, the differences in the pH of the extract, which might vary depending on the type of flatworm used (e.g., species difference and dietary conditions). Therefore, Frs. M10 and M50, which elute before and after the elution time of Fr. M30, should also be prepared just in case Fr. M30 does not have sex-inducing activity. Extremely hydrophilic or hydrophobic substances elute in Frs. M0 and M100 and will be removed from the analysis.\nUnless specified, all steps should be performed at 4°C or on ice.\nNote: The time required for chromatography will vary depending on the type and batch of flatworms used. Including preparation, it takes an average of 7–8 h for the terrestrial planarian B. nobile and 10–11 h for the fluke C. calicophorum.\nPrepare and wash ODS gel (column packing material) at 20°C–23°C.\nNote: We recommend washing ODS gels the day before chromatography.\nCritical: MeOH should be handled in a fume hood, and appropriate safety gloves and goggles should be worn. Collect and dispose the waste liquid appropriately.\nWeigh 50 g of the ODS gel, Cosmosil 75C18-OPN (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), and place it in a 500 mL beaker.",
    "Add at least three column volumes (i.e., 300 mL in this case) of 100% MeOH.\nNote: HPLC grade MeOH is not required ONLY for step 10. For example, EP (Extra Pure Reagent) grade MeOH (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) can be used.\nWash the ODS gel for 30 min, stirring once every 5 min, for example, with a clean spatula.\nAllow to stand for 5 min.\nCritical: During the 5 min, the ODS gel floating in MeOH will fall to the bottom of the beaker.\nSlowly discard the MeOH for about 1 min to prevent the ODS gel from floating and flowing away.\nRepeat steps b–e two more times for a total of three washes with 100% MeOH.\nAfter the final wash, add 300 mL of 100% MeOH and store it at 20°C–23°C.\nNote: When adding new 100% MeOH, rinse off any ODS gel adhering to the beaker wall with a glass pipette after discarding the MeOH.\nNote: Be careful not to let the ODS gel dry out.\nPrepare the following MeOH solutions to be used in step 17 and keep them on ice.\n100% MeOH:300 mL.\n50% aqueous MeOH:300 mL.\nMilli-Q water:300 mL.\nPrepare six different containers for fraction collection in step 18 (e.g., wide-mouth 500 mL PP bottle Eyeboy, AS ONE, Japan).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3085_3.csv\nCritical: Use bottles that will not break at −80°C.\nNote: It may be a good idea to draw a line at the bottle for each liquid volume.\nPrepare three column volumes (i.e., 300 mL) of 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, and 100% MeOH solutions to be used in step 18 as follows and keep them on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3085_4.csv\nNote: Prepare them on the same day because MeOH volatilization changes the concentration.\nPrepare the sample solution for chromatography (the flatworm extract).",
    "Keep the freeze-dried supernatant powder in 14 tubes on ice.\nDissolve the powder in 100 mL of Milli-Q water.\nAdd 50 mL of Milli-Q water to the first and second tubes containing the powder and dissolve the solution by gently pipetting it on ice using a long Pasteur pipette.\nTransfer the solution in each tube to the other two tubes containing the powder using a long Pasteur pipette and dissolve the sample in the same manner on ice (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Open-column chromatography\n(A) Schematic diagram showing how to dissolve the sample powder in 100 ml of Milli-Q water.\n(B) Open-column chromatography system.\n(C) View of the column and collection bottle (arrow) just before adding the next solution. Wait for the previous solution to drop just above the ODS gel (arrowhead) before adding the next solution.\nRepeat this process and finally centrifuge all the tubes shortly to collect all the samples, obtaining 100 mL of sample solution for the two 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes.\nNote: Do not refreeze the sample solution once it is dissolved.\nFiltrate the sample solution in multiple small volumes using a 10 mL syringe (e.g., TERUMO Disposable 10 mL syringe, TERUMO, Japan) and a 0.45 μm filter (e.g., Millex-HV Syringe-driven 0.45 μm PVDF Filter Unit, Merck Millipore, USA).\nNote: Filtration must be performed because in the process of freezing, drying, and dissolving in water, micelles in the ultracentrifuged supernatant may appear as small insoluble particles.\nNote: Perform filtration slowly in small portions. Applying too much pressure when the filter becomes clogged would result in the filter coming off vigorously and scattering of the sample.",
    "Optional: Filtration requires a lot of force and filters, so if it seems impossible, Rapid-Flow 0.2 μm PES Filters (Nalge Nunc International, USA) can be used. However, using Rapid-Flow filters are not recommended because it will cause additional sample loss.\nNote: When the filter becomes clogged, replace it with a new one. To reduce sample loss, point the mouth of the syringe upward before removing the filter, pull the plunger back slightly to let air in, and collect the remaining sample in the filter into the syringe.\nKeep the samples on ice until step 18.\nSet up an open column Econo-Column (50 φ × 500 mm) (Bio-Rad, USA) and a peristaltic pump (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: The liquid outlet should be positioned above the ODS gel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, arrowhead), because the momentum of the liquid flow delivered by the peristaltic pump may gouge the ODS gel layer.\nPack the ODS gel to the column (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nOpen the column faucet.\nPack the ODS gel to the column and collect the drained MeOH as appropriate (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nCollect and pack any remaining ODS gel adhering to the beaker and the wall of the column by rinsing with MeOH.\nReplace MeOH in the ODS gel with Milli-Q water and prepare for chromatography. Use the solution prepared in step 11.\nDiscard the original MeOH.\nFlow 300 mL of 100% MeOH using a peristaltic pump (flow rate: 10 mL/min).\nFlow 300 mL of 50% aqueous MeOH using a peristaltic pump (flow rate: 10 mL/min).\nFlow 300 mL of Milli-Q water using a peristaltic pump (flow rate: 10 mL/min).\nCritical: Wait for the previous solution to drop just above the ODS gel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, arrowhead) before adding the next solution.\nCritical: Do not expose the ODS gel to air.",
    "Note: The flow rate is set at 10 mL/min, but if the ODS gel is gouged, it should be slowed down accordingly. Moreover, it may take some time for the solution to pass through the column. When using a column as the one used in this study (5 cm i.d.), make sure that the volume of the solution does not exceed a height of 4 cm above the ODS gel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, indicated in red line) by adjusting the flow rate of the peristaltic pump accordingly. This keeps the flow rate at the optimum level for reproducible fractionation.\nNote: All solutions passing through the peristaltic pump should be ice-cooled (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, white arrow). It would be ideal to perform the chromatographic work in a cold room when purifying an unknown compound such as the sex-inducing substance, because the sample still contains various components such as digestive enzymes. However, since this was not possible for us due to space limitations, we opted the protocol described above and were able to recover the sex-inducing substance.\nNote: Room temperature should be kept constant at 20°C.\nPerform chromatography to produce Frs. M0-M100.\nElution of flow-through and Fr. M0.\nWhen the water in step 17-d flows through and the liquid level is just above the ODS gel, start flowing 100 mL of the sample solution (flatworm extract) with a peristaltic pump.\nSimultaneously with step (i), place the bottle labeled \"Flow-through\" under the column with ice (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, arrow) and collect the eluate.\nWhen the liquid level is just above the ODS gel, start flowing 300 mL of 0% MeOH (M0) with a peristaltic pump.",
    "Note: The volume of liquid that the ODS gel in the column can hold is approximately 60 mL. Thus, the \"flow-through\" here is defined as the 160 mL eluate, consisting of 60 mL of the water initially contained in the column before the sample flowed through and 100 mL of the sample. The end of the \"flow-through\" collection is marked when 60 mL of liquid elutes after the 0% MeOH solution is begun to be added.\nWhen the eluate has accumulated to the 160 mL line of the \"flow-through\" bottle (i.e., when 60 mL has eluted since 0% MeOH began flowing), switch to the collection bottle labeled \"Fr. M0\".\nCollect the eluate until the liquid level is just above the ODS gel (i.e., 240 mL of Fr. M0 in the bottle).\nNote: From the next step, Fr. M10 is defined as the liquid eluted from the point when 10% aqueous MeOH (M10) begins to flow. Thereafter, Fr. M30 to M100 are defined in the same manner.\nElution of Fr. M10 (i.e., the fraction eluted from when 10% aqueous MeOH began to flow).\nWhen the liquid level from the previous step is just above the ODS gel, start flowing 300 mL of 10% aqueous MeOH (M10) with a peristaltic pump.\nSimultaneously with step (i), switch to the collection bottle labeled \"Fr. M10\".\nCollect the eluate until the liquid level is above the ODS gel (i.e., 300 mL of Fr. M10 in the bottle).\nElution of Fr. M30 (i.e., the fraction eluted from when 30% aqueous MeOH began to flow).\nWhen the liquid level from the previous step is just above the ODS gel, start flowing 300 mL of 30% aqueous MeOH (M30) with a peristaltic pump.\nSimultaneously with step (i), switch to the collection bottle labeled \"Fr. M30\".",
    "Collect the eluate until the liquid level is above the ODS gel (i.e., 300 mL of Fr. M30 in the bottle).\nElution of Fr. M50 (i.e., the fraction eluted from when 50% aqueous MeOH began to flow).\nWhen the liquid level from the previous step is just above the ODS gel, start flowing 300 mL of 50% aqueous MeOH (M50) with a peristaltic pump.\nSimultaneously with step (i), switch to the collection bottle labeled \"Fr.

M100 in the bottle).\nFinally, close the faucet of the column.\nNote: The obtained fractions should be stored at 4°C, if the next step (sample concentration) is to be performed the next day, otherwise at −80°C.\nNote: ODS gels can be reused after washing as described in step 10 and should be stored in 100% MeOH. However, reuse is not recommended if the gel is heavily contaminated with mucus or dye. If reuse is still necessary, wash three times with 100% chloroform (increase the waiting time from 5 min to about 7.5 min because the gels do not sink easily to the bottom of the beaker in chloroform), three times with 100% EtOH, and then three times with 100% MeOH. Nevertheless, limiting the reuse to 2–3 times would be best.",

    "The dissolved sample is injected into the preparative HPLC column with solvent (e.g., MeCN) called the mobile phase and moves through the column while interacting with the stationary phase (e.g., C30-UG-5, 20 φ × 250 mm). If the interaction with the mobile phase is strong, the sample component moves faster through the column in the flow of the mobile phase. On the other hand, if the interaction with the stationary phase is strong, the component moves slower. This difference in migration speed results in the separation of sample components, which is sequentially detected by the UV detector (290 nm) at the exit.\nThe sex-inducing substance is eluted immediately after the tryptophan retention time. Therefore, this protocol requires that the retention time of tryptophan be recorded prior to sample injection and the fractions containing sex-inducing substances be collected accordingly.\nHPLC must be performed in a temperature-stable environment (e.g., using a column oven or a small, air-conditioned temperature-controlled room at 20°C) for better reproducibility, since the interaction between sample components and mobile and stationary phases is strongly affected by temperature.\nUnless specified, all steps should be performed at 20°C.\nConfigure the settings on the available system accordingly, prior to the experiment. We used the ChromNav version 2 software.\nNote: This is the control method to be used in step 47-b-v.\nThe conditions of the reversed-phase HPLC to be used in this study are as follows.\nUV detect: 290 nm.\nPumping system.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3085_5.csv\nTime program (analysis time: 75 min).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3085_6.csv\nPrepare a tryptophan solution to be used as an indicator for collecting fractions; add 20 mg tryptophan to 15 mL Milli-Q water (final 1.33 mg/mL).\nPreparation of solvent for the mobile phase.",

Since the bubbles result in detection noise, degassing should be done thoroughly.\nNote: Be careful not to splash solvent on the rubber stopper when rotating the bottle.\nSet the bottle containing 10% aqueous MeCN in line A, the bottle containing 100% MeCN in line B, and the bottle containing 100% MeOH in line C of the HPLC system (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A and 9B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Ignore those adhering to the tube wall that still do not fall off.\nFreeze-dry it as described in steps 8–9 for 6–12 h.\nPrepare the food for 28 days of feeding bioassay.\nPlace the freeze-dried food in a clean 90 mm plastic petri dish and cut into 28 pieces using a sharp razor blade (e.g., ultrathin carbon steel blade FA-10, FEATHER Safety Razor, Japan).\nNote: Small crumbs are produced, but continue cutting. To prevent small scraps, the tip is to insert the blade halfway through the food, tilt the blade slightly, and let the food break naturally.",
    "Note: It is not necessary to make the feed exactly even. Worms at the start of the bioassay are small and eat little, but they will grow and eat more during the bioassay. Feeding in the order of smallest to largest pieces ensures that the amount of food provided is appropriate for the body size of the worms.\nPlace the pieces one by one into 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (total 28 tubes).\nNote: Ignore the powdery stuff (probably planarians will not eat it), but collect any fragments that can be picked up with tweezers. If the pieces are too small, two pieces are combined for one day.\nArrange the pieces in order of decreasing size and assign numbers so that the smallest pieces will be fed first.\nStore at −80°C.\nPerform feeding bioassay at 20°C. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nRemove one tube with food from −80°C and bring it to 20°C (about 5 min).\nCollect 15 worms in a 35 mm plastic petri dish (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]C).\nDrain enough rearing water with a glass pipette (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]D) to prevent the food from floating (do not suck the worms) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]E).\nPlace the food directly from the tube in the center of the petri dish (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]C, arrow) by lightly popping the tube with your finger.\nNote: After a short time (2–3 min) after the rearing water is drained, the planarians settle down and begin circling around the petri dish. It is better to place the food in the center of the petri dish in this state to ensure equal access to the food.\nThe worms will finish feeding in 10–20 min. Transfer the worms to a 90 mm plastic petri dish and change the rearing water several times to wash out food scraps.",
    "Transfer and maintain the planarians at a density of 5 worms per 90 mm plastic petri dish.\nNote: Daily feeding gradually increases body size, but the OH strain of D. ryukyuensis seldom does transverse fission at this density.\nPerform steps a–f once daily for 4 weeks (28 days).\nCritical: The feeding should be performed at fixed times (±2 h) daily, maintaining a 24-h feeding interval to keep the worms' appetite.\nAfter the last feed of the 4-week feeding bioassay, observe the worms under a microscope the next day.\nGently place a worm in, for example, a plastic petri dish with a paintbrush. Rearing water should be limited to just keep the worm from drying out. At this point, the worm should settle into a position such that its ventral side adheres to the petri dish.\nTurn the petri dish over and observe the worm from the ventral side under a microscope. It is recommended to use a black background and illuminate from above at an angle with an external flexible arm light.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3085-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12.

    "(B) Six stages of sexualization in the planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis. The worm begins to develop hermaphroditic reproductive organs upon switching from the asexual to the sexual state. The asexual worm possesses the ovarian primordia (op); during stage 1, the number of oogonia increases in the ovary (ov); during stage 2, the ovary begins to mature and develop oocytes; during stage 3, the copulatory organ (co) begins to form; during stage 4, the primordial testis (te) and primordial vitellaria (vt)17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] begin to form; during stage 5, the genital pore (gp) becomes externally apparent; during stage 6, the worm becomes sexually mature with well-developed seminal vesicles (sv), ready for mating and egg-laying. Between stages 2 and 3, there is a point of no return, marking the developmental phase from which the sexualization process proceeds without further administration of sex-inducing substances. The sex-inducing effects were evaluated based on whether the OH strain of the planarian D. ryukyuensis changed beyond the point of no return in a feeding bioassay. Note that the increase in planarian body size is due to the feeding bioassay procedure: if a food does not contain sex-inducing substances, asexual worms become bigger without gonadal development. ph, pharynx. This figure is part of figures from Sekii et al. (2023).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: The criteria to distinguish the ventral from dorsal sides are as follows. On the ventral side, the mouth (i.e., the pore from which the pharynx comes out) is observed, and the genital pore is also observed below it in sexual individuals (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A). On the dorsal side, however, these pores cannot be observed, and instead the eyes are more clearly visible (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A).",
    "Note: No anesthetic solutions are used. If the worms move violently and are difficult to observe, cool the petri dish on ice to slow their movement (so that the ice does not directly touch the worms).\nSexualization progresses through six stages (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B).\nThere is a point of no return between stages 2 and 3, beyond which sexualization proceeds irreversibly.\nThe sex-inducing substance can make worms cross the point of no return. To confirm the presence of sex-inducing activity, the copulatory organ formed after stage 3 should be observed, besides the ovary.\nIf \"only\" ovaries are visible, sex-inducing activity cannot be determined to be present. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: If sex-inducing activity is strong, the ovaries (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A, arrowhead) become visible about 2 weeks, and the copulatory organ (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A, indicated in a line) about 3 weeks after the start of the assay. However, it is difficult to observe immediately after feeding.\nNote: The observation of the copulatory organ is used as the criteria for being sexualized (i.e., beyond the point of no return) because testes and yolk glands cannot be observed externally under the microscope. To assess the formation of testes and yolk glands, histological observations using HE staining or quantitative RT-PCR for increased expression of marker genes should be performed.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCritical: If sexual maturity cannot be determined after the bioassay, the worms should be fed normal chicken liver once a week for another 4 weeks. If the fed fraction has sex-inducing activity, the worms have exceeded the point of no return13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B) during the feeding bioassay, and their sexualization will autonomously progress during the additional 4 weeks. The genital pore (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A, arrow) will be visible, which is another small pore below the mouth that is easier to observe."
