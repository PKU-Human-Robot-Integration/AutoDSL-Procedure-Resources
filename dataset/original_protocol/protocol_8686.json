    "These methods were used in the research reported in Banks, R.W. et al.2 Mice were humanely euthanised by cervical dislocation. In the UK, this is a legally approved Schedule 1 method listed in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and European Directive 2010/63/EU. This federal legislation is enforced locally at the University of Aberdeen by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board who have approved all procedures.\n1. Preparing Ears for Labeling\nPrepare a standard physiological saline, such as Liley's (1956)5 and saturate it with 90% O2/5% CO2 (carbogen). Liley's saline is (mM): NaHCO3 (12), KCl (4), KH2PO4 (1), NaCl (138.8), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (2) and glucose (11). NOTE: Throughout the remainder of this manuscript, 'saline' will refer to saline that is fully saturated with carbogen. During dissection, refresh the saline covering the preparation every 15 - 20 min.\nHumanely euthanize an adult mouse without damaging the skull. NOTE: We have used C57/Bl6J and MF1 mice but any mouse strain can be used. The most important aspect is not to use large adults (>25 g). Labeling in larger mice is less reliable, often being confined to small and scattered groups of follicles.\nRemove the external ears (pinnae) near the base with ~25 cm scissors, just above the dense hair line, and submerge in saline in a silicone rubber-lined culture/petri dish (50 mm is usually convenient) .\nPosition the pinna anterior (concave) side down and pin the margins to the silicone at regular intervals with fine insect pins (~6 - 8 per ear, ~0.2 mm diameter pins). Refresh saline every 15 - 20 min, or use a constantly perfused bath.",
    "Carefully peel away the posterior skin from the anterior skin by blunt dissection, initially accessing from the cut base of the pinna over the thick central cartilage and systematically working towards the thin, cartilage-free external margins.\n\t\nTo do this, hold the center of the cut edge of the posterior skin with a pair of no. 3 forceps. Then, with the jaws closed, place the points of another set of no. 3 forceps in the gap between the skin and the underlying cartilage.\nGently work the points of the closed forceps from side-to-side within the gap, using the minimum required force, carefully loosen adhesions while peeling back the posterior skin to separate the layers.\nWith the posterior skin removed, leave the anterior skin in position. Pin the posterior skin, dermal side up, beside the anterior skin (as per 1.5, above).\nNext, carefully and completely remove the pinna cartilage that was sandwiched between the skin layers from the anterior skin by the same blunt dissection technique as in 1.6. Avoid making puncture holes with the forceps.\nThen, for both pinna skin preparations gently peel, pluck and rub away the thin layer of connective tissue, resembling expanded polystyrene foam, that covers the hair follicle bases. NOTE: Obtaining optimal clearing can take a little practice; insufficient tissue removal obstructs access, both for dye solution and for imaging, while scraping too vigorously removes the neural networks which are at the base of the follicles.\nRefresh the saline.\n2. Lanceolate Terminal Labeling",
    "NOTE: The following protocol is optimized for styryl pyridinium dye. Other, chemically similar, styryl pyridinium dyes should work, perhaps after some adjustment in concentration and incubation time. Wear gloves and a lab coat when handling dye solutions. Either buy 10 mM stock dye solution directly from the manufacturer or prepare stock by dissolving the dye powder in saline without glucose. Aliquot (10 µl is usually convenient, but adjust this for large scale experiments) and store frozen for up to 6 months at -20 °C or ~1 year at -80 °C. Powder will store for at least 2 years. Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles of dye solutions; this rapidly denatures the dye. Once defrosted, store at 4 °C and use within 1 week.\nPre-heat a water bath to 30 °C, with a platform ~3 - 5 mm below the surface of the water.\nFreshly prepare 10 µM styryl pyridinium dye solution (10 µl of freshly defrosted 10 mM styryl pyridinium dye in 10 ml saline) and equilibrate in water bath.\nPin each preparation in a silicone-rubber lined 35 mm culture dishes submerged in 1 - 2 mm of saline (typical volume, ~2 ml). Each pinna skin preparation will yield two preparations if cut in half from apex to base with small scissors (10 - 15 cm length), to minimize animal use.\nPlace the 35 mm dishes containing the saline-covered pinna preparations on the submerged platform in the 30 °C waterbath. Ensure the water depth is sufficient for adequate warming but does not contaminate the saline in the open dish.",
    "Pin fine (0.5 - 1 mm outer diameter) tubing with flowing O2/CO2 into the silicone base of each dish to continuously gas the preparations. Also place into the water bath 100 ml of dye-free saline for washing/dish refreshing. Use a tightly stoppered-bottle to maintain carbogen saturation and prevent water contamination.\nEquilibrate everything at 30 °C for 30 min then replace the saline over the pinna preparations from the 100 ml stoppered bottle. Incubate a further 30 min. NOTE: This replacement compensates for saline evaporation and any bulk volume losses resulting from gas-line bubbling.\nPour away dye-free saline into a 100 ml waste beaker, then quickly and carefully blot away any liquid remaining around the preparation with tissue paper to minimize dilution effects on the dye solution to be added next. Take care not to touch (i.e., damage) the exposed deep dermal surfaces directly.\nIncubate pinna preparations in 2 - 3 ml of 10 µM styryl pyridinium dye for 40 min at 30 °C then return to R/T for the rest of the procedure.\nRemove non-internalized dye in three stages, using solutions at R/T. NOTE: These steps are best performed in minimal ambient light (blackout blinds, red/orange low intensity lighting) to begin eye dark-adaption for imaging.\n\t\nPour away the labeling solution from the dishes into a waste beaker and quickly rinse in three changes of dye-free saline in rapid succession. This removes the residual styryl pyridinium dye solution adhering to the preparations and any dye that easily departitions from exposed membranes.\nIncubate in a final change of dye-free saline for a further 30 min to departition most remaining dye from surface membranes, i.e., dye not internalized by the terminals.",
    "Remove persistent dye stuck to the external leaflet of exposed membranes by chelating with sulfonated b-cyclodextrin derivative (Advasep-7, 1 mM, 5 min - see Table 1). Thus, all remaining dye will be within the tissues.\nPlace in fresh dye-free saline for imaging and dry the outside of the dish thoroughly with tissue paper.\n\tNOTE: The terminals are now ready for imaging. It is important to be aware that the lanceolate endings are alive and, therefore, slowly releasing the endocytosed styryl pyridinium dye again. Although this will be slower at R/T, it is important to minimize delays before/during imaging. If the experiment requires labeling of multiple preparations, initially maintain them all unlabeled at 30 °C. They will be viable for several hours. Then label sequentially at intervals, by labeling the second preparation (steps 2.7 - 2.8.3) while imaging the first.\n3. Imaging Labeled Lanceolate Endings.\nNOTE: The observer should be dark-adapted for the following imaging steps. The increased visual acuity this affords means lower excitation light levels are required to find the follicles for imaging. This is most important for minimising phototoxicity rather than reducing the inconvenience of photobleaching. Free radicals generated by full intensity illumination can rapidly (within 60 sec) kill living nerve terminals (G.S. Bewick, S. Fadul and W.J. Betz, unpublished observations).\nBefore imaging, check the preparation under a dissection stereomicroscope and carefully remove any surface debris. This prevents auto-fluorescence contaminating the images.\n\t\nMount the dish on the stage of an upright epifluorescence microscope with a standard fluorescein filter set (480 - 488 nm excitation, 500 - 520 nm emission for styryl pyridinium dye).\nAttenuate the excitation light intensity with neutral density filters until just sufficient to comfortably locate the terminals.",
    "Locate labeled follicles by observing with low (3.5x - 4x dry objective), then progressively higher (10x and 20x water immersion objective) magnification objectives.\nCapture images of labeled lanceolate terminals through 10x dry objective for low power and 20x water immersion objectives for higher magnification. Minimize the light intensity and exposure time (a camera integration time of 0.5 - 1 sec is suggested).\nCapture images on a standard digital camera and save images on computer hard drive using proprietary software. NOTE: A typical example is shown in Figure 1.\nImage ~20 lanceolate endings from each preparation. Start at the margin furthest from the cut edge at the base of the pinna skin and work along this margin imaging each follicle in turn. Work across in slightly overlapping fields parallel to the cut edge, taking care not to image the same follicle twice and any that are obviously damaged. NOTE: There are typically too many lanceolate terminals to image them all before significant spontaneous de-staining occurs. Thus, we suggest systematically sampling the population using the following protocol.\nAfter completing the marginal strip, move one field-width towards the base of the pinna, and repeat the process in the reverse direction.\nImage all terminals encountered, except occasional ones clearly oriented very much more obliquely to the optical plane and unlikely to fit entirely within the standard annular analysis ROI (see section 4). Do not exclude unusually brighter or dimmer lanceolates compared to the surrounding terminals, unless they are obviously damaged or background intensity is particularly high, indicating localized tissue damage.\nDiscard the preparation if more than 10% of the skin area/terminals are damaged/unusable. NOTE: As lanceolates destain with time, complete imaging each preparation within 20 min of the end of the wash.",
    "If using more than one preparation, ensure intensity comparisons are valid by time-matching preparations. To do this, offset timings of staining each preparation by ~30 min, to ensure comparability of de-stain times.\nTo monitor de-stain (exocytosis), image the same terminal at 5 or 10 min intervals. With practice, it is possible to image up to 3 separate terminals at each time point in any one preparation.\n4. Analyzing Labeled Lanceolate Endings.\nNote: The following procedure is a rapid method for analyzing terminal intensity.\nMake an annular region of interest (ROI) centered on the tip of the hair shaft at the base of the follicle (Figure 2). Set the inner circumference of the annular ROI large enough to avoid the hair shaft auto-fluorescence in any follicle to be analyzed but still encompass all the terminal fluorescence. Ensure that the outer circumference is big enough to enclose the largest terminal likely to be encountered that is oriented close to the main optical/follicle axis.\nMake a background ROI approximately equal in area to the target annulus (square or circle, typically ~400 µm2) to determine the local staining intensity in the vicinity of the terminal under analysis.\n\tNote: The sizes of these two ROIs are set at the beginning of the analysis and used to analyze all subsequent follicles/lanceolate terminals across all the preparations in any one experiment. So, it is important to set their parameters with care at the beginning.\nPlace the background ROI close enough to the follicle to represent local background in the sebaceous glands that underlie the terminals, not the lower intensity skin between the follicles, but be careful not to include any terminal regions.\nRecord the mean intensity of the two ROIs using the 'measure' or 'analyze ROI' function of the software and transfer data to a spreadsheet.",
    "In the spreadsheet, for each individual follicle subtract the mean local background intensity from that in the annulus to give a net intensity. This adjustment for localized background greatly reduces between-follicle variability."
