    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nFresh Tissue Sample Preparation for Sectioning\nTiming: 1.5 h\nNote: As patient derived samples are precious we suggest novice users practice on mouse samples.\nFresh tissue keeps on degrading, so measurements have to be performed within 8 h after surgical resection. Once validated for tissue of interest (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) frozen samples can also be used.\nCollect fresh tissue samples from the pTU or LM from the OR in D-PBS.\nCut 3 × 3 × 3 mm tissue blocks with razor blade or scalpel.\nFor each tissue block prepare 1.5 mL of 2% low melting point agarose in D-PBS and warm it to 37°C for 10 min.\nNote: 3%–4% agarose might be used to further stabilize very soft tissues prior to cutting (Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: In tissues with large pores such as lung or bone the agarose can infiltrates the tissue block and one risks measuring the mechanical properties of agarose instead of those of the tissue of interest. Such samples will require an optimization of the sectioning protocol. For example, by pre-inflating mouse lungs before embedding in agarose (Liu and Tschumperlin, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nRemove D-PBS from the tissue block with cotton pad.\nEmbed tissue block into pre-warmed agarose within a disposable cryomold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fresh Tissue Embedding on Agarose\n(A) Schematic of the protocol.\n(B–E) Side and top pictures of the different steps.\nPlace cryomold into bath of D-PBS at 4°C for 15–30 min, keeping the liquid below the edge of the mold so it does not touch the sample directly. The agarose will gently stabilize the tumor tissue structures. If needed, the agarose-stabilized tissue can be stored at 4°C in a fridge till cutting (steps 7–20) and measuring on the same day (steps 28–39).",
    "Fresh Tissue Sectioning Using a Vibratome and Placement on AFM-Compatible Dishes\nTiming: 2 h\nFresh tissue blocks in cryomolds are cut in a vibratome. Sections are collected on AFM-compatible dishes, where they can be stained without prior fixation to evaluate orientation and identify areas of interest.\nTransport fresh tissue blocks embedded in solidified agarose (appears opaque) to a vibratome.\nWarm sample to 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nLiberate the agarose-stabilized tissue block from the cryomold and trim the surrounding agarose using a disposable razor blade. Trim around the specimen leaving 3 mm of agarose on the top and side and 5 mm on the bottom to assure that the sample is not touching the vibratome plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Coordinate axes on the bottom-left corner indicate the axis and plane.",
    "Orient the agarose-stabilized tissue block so area of interest is facing up using forceps and gently place it on a couple of drops of superglue on the vibratome base. Allow it to bind for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: To orient the tissue pay attention to the tissue color and texture. Healthy liver is much more pink than colorectal metastasis, which has more of a white tone.\nFill the chamber of the vibratome with cold D-PBS and ice.\nFill as many 12-wells plate wells with 1 mL ice-cold D-PBS as needed. Place on ice bucket.\nCut 100 μm sections using the vibratome. In short, lock the metal base with the agarose-stabilized tissue in the cold D-PBS-filled chamber. Secure a double-edge razor blade on the holder, with a sharpened edge facing upward. Carefully cut off the excess agarose from the block by advancing the vibratome (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: If the tissue is soft, once the blade touches the tissue it could push and deform it instead of cutting. To avoid that hold the tissue against the cutting-edge using a brush (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSpread the section evenly in the cold D-PBS. Due to surface tension, most tissue sections will spread. If that is not the case gently help using the forceps.\nPick up the floating sections by lifting them with a 10 mm round coverslip held by the forceps (end of Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nWash and remove excess agarose by transferring each section into a 6-well well with 2.5 mL of D-PBS at 37°C for 5 min. To transfer the slices pick them up with a round coverslip as done in step 15.\nTransfer slices to pre-prepared 12-well plates on ice bucket. Upon submersion of the forceps the slice will float and thus can be deposited in the well.",
    "Critical: This step is very important to remove any left-over agarose that could cover the sample. This could lead to the measurement of the enveloping agarose instead of the tissue sample. Repeat if any agarose remains on the tissue (appears opaque).\nTransfer the fresh section (as done in step 15) from the 12-well into a poly-L-lysine-coated AFM-compatible glass bottom dishes with 1 mL 50% FBS in D-PBS (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Fresh Tissue Sectioning Using a Vibratome, Steps 13–15\nRemove most of the liquid gently by pipetting on the dish wall and let the tissue section settle down and spread evenly. Sandwich the section with a second clean, uncoated coverslip and apply very mild pressure to help the attachment to the poly-L-lysine-coated AFM-compatible glass bottom dish.\nOnce the tissue section is firmly attached, carefully fill the AFM-compatible dish with 1 mL of D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA (1 pill in 10 mL, according to the manufacturer), remove the coverslip and store till measurements within the same day at 4°C. The proteinase inhibitor together with the 4°C storage will slow down sample degradation.\nCritical: It is important to use proteinase inhibitors without EDTA as we have shown that EDTA is sufficient to alter the mechanical properties of tissues (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Fresh Tissue Section Placement on AFM-Compatible Dishes, Step 18\nTissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on AFM-Compatible Dishes and Slides for Imaging",
    "Timing: 30 min\nFrozen tissue blocks in cryomolds are cut in a cryostat. Two sets of sections are collected, a first set for imaging-based assessments (quality control, evaluation of necrosis and immunochemistry) (steps 23–25) and a second set for AFS measurements (steps 26 and 27).\nTransport frozen tissue blocks in cryomolds on top of dry ice to a cryostat.\nCut 30 μm sections using a cryostat at −20°C.\nNote: A brush is useful to help guide the emerging sections from the knife blade. To prevent sections from melting some practice will be required. Try to cut each section in less than 30 s (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: A smooth surface of the frozen section is key to guarantee adhesion to the glass bottom AFM-compatible dish. Adjust the cutting temperature (± 5°C) to avoid broken or melting and sticky sections. Tissue type and quality will determine the exact temperature needed.\nFor imaging transfer the sections directly to a 20°C–25°C microscope slide by touching the frozen tissue with the slide (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: Silanized and poly-L-lysine-coated slides improve the adherence.\nTo evaluate tissue preservation and orientation, stain the first slide of each set with H&E (Mendoza and Bishop, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor sections that will be immunostained immerse the slide immediately into a fixative (i.e., 4% PFA).\nFor AFS measurements transfer the section to a RT AFM-compatible glass bottom dish with the help of a brush and immediately fill with 1 mL of D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA till AFS measurements (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3. Tissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on Slides for Imaging, Steps 22 S3\nStore at 4°C till measurement on the same day.",
    "Critical: Do not allow the section to air-dry at RT. It will lead to a loss of high-resolution mechanical details and can also change immunostaining results.\nNote: Left-over tissue can be stored back into disposable cryomold with a layer of OCT on top to prevent freeze-drying during storage at −80°C.\nNote: For long-term storage, a moistened tissue can be placed next to the sample in a paper box to prevent desiccation (particularly in a frost-free freezer).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S4. Tissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on AFM-Compatible Dishes, Step 26\nAtomic Force Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Imaging of Tissue Sections\nTiming: 3 h\nIn order to identify the relevant areas for AFS, tissue sections can be inspected by phase contrast microscopy, or immunostained without prior fixation and visualized by fluorescence microscopy on the AFM (steps 28–32). If live immunostaining is performed, coat the cantilever with Pluronic (step 33) in parallel to save time.\nFor live immunostaining, instead of filling dishes with D-PBS on steps 20 (for fresh slices) or 26 (for frozen slices), block tissue section with 5% serum (from the source of the desired secondary antibody) in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 2 h at RT.\nIncubate the tissue section with primary antibody (e.g., rabbit anti-collagen I to visualize interstitial collagen (1:100 dilution), rabbit anti-αSMA (1:100 dilution) to visualize fibroblasts) in 5% serum, 0.2% Triton in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 1 h at RT.\nNote: Triton can be present in the staining buffers as we have shown that it does not have an effect on tissue mechanics (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Comparison of Tissue Elasticity without (w/o) and with Triton X-100 (n = 25/25; p = 0.7112; t = 0.3725, df = 48)",
    "Measurements performed on same tissue grid before and after addition of media with Triton X-100. Figure modified from Shen et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nWash sample three times for 5 min each with D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA.\nIncubate with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore (e.g., Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200 dilution)) in 5% serum, 0.2% Triton in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 1 h at RT.\nNote: When available we recommend using conjugated antibodies as this reduces the risk of slice detachment.\nWash tissue slices several times with D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA.\nCoat the bead-attached cantilever with 1% Pluronic for 30 min – 1 h to avoid adhesion to the sample. For this, mount the cantilever to the glassblock and either hang it into a dish or mount it to the AFM head. Lower it into a dish with Pluronic, so that the cantilever is freely submerged in liquid without touching surfaces.\nRinse cantilever by submerging it several times in dish with PBS and calibrate the cantilever in liquid.\nWipe the bottom surface of the AFM-compatible dishes with the tissue slice with tissue paper and mount on the AFM sample stage.\nAlign the cantilever to the center of the dish. Switch to phase contrast and/or fluorescence imaging to choose an area of interest on the tissue.\nTo ensure the fastest rate of elastic measurement without viscoelastic deformation the optimal indentation speed needs to be experimentally determined for each sample type as done in (Rosenbluth et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). In short, test a whole range and identify the maximum speed (to maximize throughput) with consistent Young’s modulus. We found that for colorectal cancer a velocity of 0.4 μm/s was ideal (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Approaching Speed and Sampling Frequency Optimization",
    "(A) Pearson comparison analysis of the correlation between 0.4 μm/s and 5 μm/s (n = 100; r = 0.7001).\n(B) Pearson comparison analysis of the correlation between0.4 μm/s and 20 μm/s (n = 100; r = 0.1642).\n(C) Pearson comparison analysis of the correlation between 0.4 μm/s and 2 μm/s (n = 25; r = 0.6534).\n(D) Quantification of tissue stiffness with different sampling frequency on the same 20 × 20 μm2 human tissue area (n = 25/100; p = 0.8491; t = 0.1906, df = 123). Displayed dots are the average of three measurements. Figure modified from Shen et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nNote: More sampling points will provide higher spatial resolution but lengthen the time required for mapping. We suggest to use a 5 × 5 sample grid to map a 20 × 20 μm2 area at an indentation velocity of 0.4 μm/s, which can be completed in ~30 min.\nFor a single measurement, move the cantilever to the area of interest and perform a standard force-curve. Repeat three times on the same location.\nNote: We performed our indentation curves with a force of 2 nN as it provided enough depth to fit the Hertz model to the top 200 nm upon contact but at the same time did not damage the tissue upon repeated measurements.\nCritical: To use the Hertz model to determine the elastic properties of the tissue the flat area before contact with the sample is critical. For data fitting purposes make sure you collect data 2–4 μm above the surface of the tissue with the contact speed.\nFor automated mapping of the region of interest, switch to Force-Map mode, where the cantilever collects individual force-displacement curves at each point within a defined sample grid.\nNote: Avoid drying of the cantilever between switching samples."
