    "The protocol was approved by the Mayo Institutional Review Board and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before participating in the testing described.\n1. Calibration and Setup of Metabolic Cart\nFlow and volume (pneumotach) calibration\n\tNOTE: Specific materials and equipment are listed in the Materials Table.\n\t\nOpen the pulmonary function and gas exchange software to calibrate for the test.\nClick the “calibrate” button to open the calibration window. At the bottom of the calibration window, note the room temperature, barometric pressure, and the humidity — ensure that these values are accurate using a barometer.\nInsert the umbilical and sample line into the pneumotach and then insert the pneumotach into the 3 L syringe.\nBefore starting calibration, click the “zero flow” button to ensure that there is no flow going through the syringe.\nClick “start” to begin the calibration. Withdraw first, then inject. Repeat 4 more times (5 total), except at different flow rates each time. Maintain constant flow rate for each respective withdrawal/injection, then vary flow rate for the next iteration.\nGas calibration\n\t\nAttach sample line from respiratory mass spectrometer/gas analyzer/metabolic cart to the calibration/home port on the system.\nIn the pulmonary function software, select the O2/CO2 analyzers tab in the calibrate window. Open the reference (room air 21% O2, 0.04% CO2) and calibration (12% O2 and 5% CO2) gas tanks.\nSelect the calibrate button.\n\t\tNOTE: The software will operate the solenoid valves in the metabolic cart system to switch between the reference and calibration gases being sampled at the calibration port. From this, the software will evaluate for any offset, sampling the delay due to sample line length and the 2–90% response time. A green “Calibration Successful” message will appear when calibration is complete.\nFinal Setup",
    "Remove the sample line from the gas calibration port and insert it back into the pneumotach. Then attach a mouthpiece onto the pneumotach.\nWait for the subject to arrive for exercise test.\nUpon arrival of the subject, inform them about the study and what their involvement will be, review the consent form with them and have him/her sign it, and as the visit proceeds continually discuss with them what (s)he will be doing next and provide explanation of the procedures before doing them.\n\t\tNOTE: Inclusion and exclusion criteria will vary based on the purpose of the exercise testing, for this study those recruited were healthy, non-smokers, with no known cardiopulmonary or immune disease and not taking any steroids or immune modulating drugs.\n2. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)\nNOTE: The pulmonary function test methods described are a brief summary of those published by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society, for additional details please refer to their publications16,17.\nSlow vital capacity (SVC) maneuver\n\t\nInstruct the subject to be seated with straight back and feet flat on the floor with legs uncrossed.\nInstruct the subject to put his/her mouth around the mouthpiece, and bite down; also fit the subject with a nose clip to seal off the nasal cavity.\nStart the maneuver on the software. When beginning the maneuver, instruct the subject to continue to breathe normally.\nObserve the subject’s tidal breathing and have him/her continue to breathe while waiting for him/her to reach a stable breathing pattern.\nInstruct the subject to inhale maximally and then exhale slowly. The subject will keep emptying his/her lungs until they can no longer exhale. This point will be apparent by a plateau in the flow tracing. At this point, instruct the subject to take a maximal breath in.",
    "Stop the measurement and instruct the subject to release the mouthpiece and remove the nose clip to take a break if needed.\n\t\tNOTE: A minimum of three SVCs are performed. To meet American Thoracic Society standards, they must agree within 5% or 150 mL of each other for both the largest VC and inspiratory capacity (IC) values. Up to 4 maneuvers can be performed in order to obtain three that agree16,17.\nForced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver\n\t\nInstruct the subject to grasp the mouthpiece and attach the nose clip while remaining in the same seated position.\nStart the maneuver on the software and instruct the subject to continue to breathe normally. Ensure the subject has established a stable breathing pattern with a minimum of four tidal breaths.\nInstruct the subject to inhale fully and rapidly, and then to immediately exhale (pause of < 1 s) as quickly and forcefully as possible.\nTell the subject/patient to continue to try and blast/push all the air out of his/her lungs reaching a full exhalation while remaining in an upright posture. This is seen as a plateau in the volume-time curve. Ask them to continue trying to exhale for as long as they can; ideally for 6 s.\nOnce this is achieved, instruct the subject to take a maximal breath in and stop the maneuver on the software.\n\t\tNOTE: The test should be repeated at least two more times — ensuring that they agree within 5% or 150 mL of each other for both the two largest FVC and FEV1 values. Up to 8 maneuvers can be performed in order to get two that agree.\nMaximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) maneuver",
    "NOTE: The goal of this maneuver is to have the subject move as much air as rapidly as they can. They will be coached to try to take as large breaths as possible while still breathing rapidly.\n\t\nInstruct the subject to grasp the mouthpiece and attach the nose clip while maintaining the same seated position.\nStart the maneuver on the software.\n\t\tNOTE: A countdown bar at the top will indicate the number of breaths required (usually three) before data collection/measurements begin.\nWith one breath to go in the countdown, direct the patient to start breathing deeply and rapidly through the mouthpiece. They will continue this for 12 s.\nEncourage the patient throughout the procedure to breathe deeply and fast. If the subject is unable to continue, stop the test.\nAt the end of 12 s, instruct the patient to resume normal breathing. They may feel light headed, so encourage them to sit back and take slow deep breaths.\n\t\tNOTE: For repeatability the test should be performed a minimum of two times and the suggested variability should be less than 20%.\n3. Exercise Tests\nElectrode placement\n\t\nPrepare the skin for the electrodes by shaving hair away from electrode placement site if present. Rub the site with an alcohol pad and then with an abrasive pad to remove any dead skin cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Electrode can be placed once this is completed, but be sure that the electrode has adequate gel and is not dry.\nEquip the subject with electrodes for a 12-lead electrocardiogram using the following electrodes placement.\n\t\t\nPosition limb lead electrodes as follows: RA: right side subclavicular fossa; LA: left side subclavicular fossa; RL: right back just above posterior superior iliac spine; LL: left back just above posterior superior iliac spine",
    "Position precordial leads as follows: V1: right of sternum in the 4th intercostal space; V2: left of sternum in the 4th intercostal space (in line with V1); V3: left side directly between V2 and V4; V4: left side in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line (typically under breast/nipple); V5: place horizontally with V4 on anterior axillary line (down from the edge of the armpit (anterior axillary fold of the upper arm); V6: place horizontally with V4 and V5 on the middle auxiliary line.\nIncremental maximal cycling test — Visit 1",
    "NOTE: Performing a maximal exercise test comes with risks. The American College of Sports Medicine outlines how to identify individuals who are at higher risk for an adverse event during the test13. Those who would be considered to have significant risk have: known cardiovascular, pulmonary and/or metabolic disease; major symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath (SOB) at rest or with mild exertion, dizziness or syncope, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations or tachycardia, intermittent claudication, known heart murmur, unusual fatigue or SOB with usual activities; or at least two of the cardiovascular disease risks factors: family history of myocardial infarction or sudden death, age (males ≥ 45, women ≥ 55), current smoker, sedentary lifestyle ( < 30 min of moderate intensity physical activity 3 days a week for at least 3 months), obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), hypertension (Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg), dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL; LDL ≥ 130 mg/dL; HDL < 40 mg/dL, or on lipid lowering medication), prediabetes (fasting blood glucose > 100 mg/dL). All maximal exercise testing should be performed under the supervision of a health care professional trained in clinical exercise testing, with at least two people present, one to monitor the ECG and the other to be taking blood pressures and monitoring the patient. For those who are higher risk, a physician should also be present during the test, whereas in those that are at lower risk the test can be performed without a physician present; it is preferred to have the physician nearby and available immediately if needed. The personnel performing the test should have basic life support with an automated external defibrillator (AED) in the room and at least one or more performing personnel should have advance cardiac life support training.",
    "Those performing the test should know the plan for responding to a medical emergency and have the appropriate contact numbers.",
    "Fit the subject to the bike making sure the seat and handlebars are positioned comfortably.\n\t\tNOTE: The general suggestion for seat height is such that the leg has a slight bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke and the seat should be adjusted horizontally so that when the crank arm is parallel to the ground the knee should fall over the metatarsals which should be over the pedal spindle. The handlebars should be at the same height as the seat or slightly higher and close enough so that the subject has a slight bend in their elbows. The handlebar position will depend on the experience of the rider, more experienced cyclists will want to be more bent over, where are those who do not bike often will prefer a more upright position.\nPlace a pulse oximeter on the subject’s forehead. Wipe the placement location with an alcohol wipe to remove any makeup or dirt, etc. and secure it to the forehead with a headband.\nReview the exercise test procedure with the subject. Inform the subject that they will need to stay breathing through the mouthpiece for the entire duration of the test, and breathe only through his/her mouth as the nose will be plugged with the nose clip.",
    "NOTE: Using a mouthpiece and nose clip is not the only option; masks are available which cover the nose and mouth allowing the participant to breathe through either their mouth or nose18. Gas exchange metrics are continuously measured and recorded through the pulmonary function software. Heart rate (HR) and rhythm will be continuously monitored by the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be continuously monitored with the pulse oximeter. These external signals (HR, SpO2) can be linked to the metabolic cart so that all measurements are documented together. If this isn’t possible, HR and SpO2 should be recorded on a worksheet every minute.\nDraw a 5 mL blood sample from the antecubital vein (baseline exercise blood draw).\nAfter 2 min of rest, begin data collection. Then, start the exercise protocol and instruct the participant to start pedaling. Ask them to reach a pedal rate between 60 and 80 rpms.\n\t\tNOTE: For this study, the maximal exercise test protocol used was an initial workload of 50 W with 30 W increments every 2 min. The protocol used can vary depending upon the population and the goals of the test. For older individuals or patient populations, the first stage can be performed unloaded to allow the individuals to get their legs moving before resistance is added. In younger healthy individuals, this is usually not necessary as 50 W is a low enough workload to warm up. Pedaling at 0 W while maintaining the desired pedal rate is actually more challenging than starting with resistance from the beginning.",
    "Have an assisting technician measure blood pressure (BP) 1 min into each stage while a second technician assists with the test. Then ask the subject to rate his/her exertion level on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale where 6 indicates that the exertion is perceived as easy (like (s)he is sitting/standing doing nothing) and 20 indicates that the perceived exertion is at the hardest work they can imagine doing18. Take a 12-lead ECG printout within the last 30 seconds of each stage.\nContinue the test until exhaustion of subject which is designated by having at least two of the following occur: when 60-80 rpm on the bike can no longer be maintained, the subject’s VO2 plateaus and does not increase with an increase in workload, his/her respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is equal to or greater than 1.1–1.2, and/or the subjects rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18.\nStop the test if any of the following occur13: onset of angina or chest pain symptoms; drop in SBP of ≥ 10 mmHg with an increase in work; excessive rise in BP: SBP > 250 mmHg and/or DBP > 115 mmHg; shortness of breath, wheezing, leg cramps, or claudication; signs of poor perfusion: light-headedness, confusion, nausea, cyanosis, cold or clammy skin; failure of HR to increase with increasing exercise intensity; change in heart rhythm with symptoms; subject requests to stop; subject vocalizes or severe fatigue is observed; testing equipment not functioning properly.\nUpon reaching exhaustion, proceed to the recovery phase: drop the resistance to the initial workload and instruct the subject to continue to cycle for another 2 min.\nDraw another 5 mL of blood from the patient (post exercise blood draw) via antecubital venipuncture.",
    "Direct the subject to return in 3 h, and 24 h following the completion of the test for the additional 5 mL blood draws. Instruct the subject to not partake in further exercise until completion of the 3rd post exercise blood draw at 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: These were the time points chosen for this study to evaluate the time line of changes in immune cells. The questions and parameters of interest will dictate when sampling should occur.\nEndurance steady-state submaximal cycling test — Visit 2\n\t\nComplete steps 1 for calibration, 3.1 for ECG preparation, 3.2.1 for bike fitting and 3.2.2 for forehead pulse oximeter installation.\nReview the exercise test procedure with the subject. Inform the subject that they will be biking for 45 min, but unlike the maximal exercise test, they will only be asked to breathe through the mouthpiece with the nose clip for sections of test and not continuously.\n\t\tNOTE: As with the maximal exercise test, HR and rhythm will be continuously monitored by the 12-lead ECG. SpO2 will be continuously monitored with the pulse oximeter.\nDraw 5 mL of venous blood sample from the antecubital vein (baseline endurance submaximal exercise blood draw) before starting the test.\nInstruct the subject to grasp the mouthpiece by mouth and attach the nose clip.\nBegin data collection, and then start the exercise protocol. Instruct the participant to start pedaling, and ask them to reach a pedal rate between 60 and 80 rpms.",
    "NOTE: For this study the endurance steady-state protocol is 45 min with a 3–5 min warm up at 50 W. Following warmup, the wattage is increased to 60% of the subject’s maximal workload determined from visit 1. This is different from visit 1 in that the workload is constant and the bout is set for a specific duration, rather than increasing the workload until peak VO2 is reached.\nMeasure BP (use the same technician as before) and ask the subject to report exertion level intermittently (every 3–5 min) throughout the exercise.\nInstruct the subject to release the mouthpiece from the 10th min to 25th min, and re-grasp the mouthpiece from the 25th min to 30th min and during last 5 min of 45 min bout (40th min to 45th min).\n\t\tNOTE: Gas exchange metrics are being intermittently monitored only when the subject is on the mouthpiece; intermittent monitoring is done as the mouthpiece can be dry and uncomfortable for the subject when used for longer periods of time. Since the goal of this type of exercise test is to have the subject reach specified exercise intensity and then hold that as a steady-state, the subject’s gas exchange does not need to be continuously monitored unless it is a primary outcome measure. In the case of this study it was the stimulus, and not the outcome of interest.\nEnsure that the test remains at a steady-state by monitoring the following metrics:\n\t\t\nCheck that the VO2 hasn’t increased significantly (+/- 5 mL/min/kg) when the subject is back on the mouthpiece.\nCheck that the subject’s HR doesn’t increase by more than 5 bpm.\nObserve for the subject appearing tired or that his/her RPE rating is rising.",
    "Drop the workload by ~5–10% to ensure completion of 45 min of cycling, if any of the above occurs.\nFollowing 45 min, instruct the participant to complete a 2 min recovery period of easy pedaling, and then draw 5 mL of venous blood (post exercise blood draw).\nGive the same post exercise instructions as in visit 1 i.e., do not engage in exercise until after the 24 h time point and return to the lab for blood draws 3 h and 24 h post exercise.\n4. Blood Analysis\nProcess blood samples for analysis.\n\tNOTE: Potential methods may include, but are not limited to, flow cytometry of circulating leukocytes, cytokine analysis of plasma samples, and/or leukocyte gene expression analysis. Additionally, optimal time points may need to be empirically determined.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
