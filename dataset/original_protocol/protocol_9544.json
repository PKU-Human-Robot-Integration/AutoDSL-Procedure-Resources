    "NOTE: The protocol described here for the use of sheathless CE-MS for metabolic profiling studies is for laboratory use only. The procedures outlined below are based on recently published work4,5. Further experimental details can be found in these papers. Prior to using this protocol, consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS). Please use all appropriate laboratory safety procedures, including safety glasses, lab coat and gloves, when conducting the experiments outlined in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of Reagents Solutions and Samples\nPreparation of the background electrolyte (BGE)\nPrepare a new BGE solution (10% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 2.2) every day.\nAdd 9.0 ml of water into a 10 ml glass vial and add 1.0 ml of acetic acid to the water in a fume hood. Mix the solution thoroughly using a vortex.\nPreparation of metabolite standard mixture\nDissolve 50 µl of a 50 µM cation standard mixture containing 60 cationic metabolites into 50 µl of water and mix the solution thoroughly. Store at -80 °C when not in use.\nDissolve 50 µl of a 50 µM anion standard mixture containing 30 anionic metabolites into 50 µl of water and mix the solution thoroughly. Store this solution, in aliquots to prevent freeze/thaw cycles of the same standard mixture, at -80 °C when not in use.\n\t\tNOTE: The metabolite standard mixtures are stable for 3 months when stored properly at -80 °C.\nPreparation of extracts from the glioblastoma cell line\nWash the adherent human U-87 MG glioblastoma cells three times with 1 ml ice-cold 0.9% sodium chloride solution21.\nAdd 2 ml ice-cold methanol/water solution (8/2, v/v) to the adherent cells and scrape using a rubber tipped cell scraper21.\nCollect the methanol/water solution in a tube and ultrasonicate for 2 min.",
    "Add chloroform to the methanol/water fraction (final ratio 8/8/2, v/v/v) and centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 16,100 x g and 4 °C.\nCollect the methanol/water layer and evaporate this fraction using a vacuum concentrator. Reconstitute the dried material in 50 µl water for analysis by sheathless CE-MS. When not in use store the sample at -80 °C.\n2. Setting up the Sheathless CE-MS System\nInstallation of the bare fused-silica cartridge with the porous tip emitter\nPlace a new bare fused-silica cartridge with a porous tip emitter (30 µm inner diameter x 90 cm total length) in the CE instrument.\nApply a forward rinse at 50 psi for 15 min with the software controlling the CE instrument using 100% methanol and visually check whether liquid is flowing out from the capillary outlet during this rinsing step. Also perform a rinse in the opposite direction at 50 psi for 5 min using the BGE solution to visually examine whether liquid is flowing out from the conductive capillary.\nRepeat step 2.1.2 at a pressure of 100 psi in case no liquid drop formation has been observed at the capillary outlet. Install a new bare fused-silica cartridge if no liquid drop formation was observed during this step.\nRinse the separation capillary with water at 50 psi for 10 min, followed by 0.1 M NaOH at 50 psi for 10 min, then by water at 50 psi for 10 min and finally with BGE at 50 psi for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 2.1.1 until 2.1.4 are only required for the installation of a new capillary cartridge.\nCoupling of the capillary porous tip emitter to ESI-MS",
    "NOTE: Prior to coupling the CE capillary to MS, ensure that the MS instrument has been calibrated and connected to the CE system. Set the ESI voltage to 0. Fit the MS instrument with a nanospray source. Gas 1, gas 2 and interface heater temperature were not applied as ESI at very low flow rates occurs by just applying the ion spray voltage set at 1500 V. Set the curtain at 5 psi.\n\t\nRemove the sprayer tip of the fused-silica cartridge from the water tube and install it in the nanospray source adapter for coupling to the MS instrument. Ensure that the height of the BGE vials in the CE instrument match the height of the sprayer tip.\nCheck for flow of liquid through the conductive capillary by rinsing with BGE at 50 psi for 5 min. During this rinsing step a drop formation at the base of the ESI sprayer needle should be observed.\nFlush the separation capillary with BGE at 50 psi for 10 min in the forward direction. Drop formation should be observed at the tip of the porous tip emitter (sprayer tip) during this step.\nPosition the porous tip emitter to the entrance of the MS inlet at a distance of circa 2 to 3 mm.\nApply a voltage of 30 kV using a ramp time of 1 min and start acquiring MS data in the m/z range from 65 to 1,000 m/z for metabolic profiling studies using first an ESI voltage of 0.\n\t\tNOTE: The mass spectrum should be void of signal as there should be no electrospray.\nSet the ESI voltage to 1,000 V while carry on measuring data. Increase the ESI voltage with increments of 200 V until a constant background signal is observed for at least 15 min.",
    "Optimize the porous tip emitter position with respect to the center of the MS inlet by moving it in the x, y, or z-direction in order to see which position provides the maximal and most stable MS signal (total ion electropherogram).\nAfter optimizing the position of the porous tip emitter and determining the optimal ESI voltage, set the ESI voltage to 0 V and decrease the CE voltage from 30 kV to 1 kV using a ramp time of 5 min.\nCreate a MS method using the optimal ESI voltage and a CE method on the CE instrument for the analysis of metabolite standards and biological samples.\n3. Analysis of Metabolite Standards and Biological Samples\nPerformance evaluation of the sheathless CE-MS system\nTransfer 20 µl of the anionic metabolite standard mixture into an empty 100 µl microvial (PCR vial) which fits into a CE vial and put this vial in the inlet sample tray.\n\t\tNOTE: The minimum volume required in the microvial for a reliable injection is 2 µl.\n\t\t\nStart the MS acquisition negative ion mode method created during step 2.2.9 and subsequently start the CE sequence using the software controlling the CE instrument.\nRinse the separation capillary with BGE at 50 psi for 3 min followed by injection at 2.0 psi for 60 sec (20 nl corresponding to 3% of the capillary volume) and then by BGE injection at 1.0 psi for 10 sec.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Subsequently, MS data acquisition is triggered.",
    "Apply a voltage of -30 kV with a ramp time of 1.0 min with a pressure of 0.5 psi for 30 min at the inlet. After a 30 min electrophoretic separation, stop MS data acquisition and decrease the CE voltage to -1 kV using a ramp time of 5 min (a gradual decrease of the CE voltage after the electrophoretic separation improves the durability of the porous tip capillary emitter).\nBetween sample injections, rinse the capillary with water, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, water and BGE each at 30 psi for 3 min.\nAnalyze the recorded data by determining the migration times and the signal intensity of the analyzed anionic metabolite mixture.\nAssess whether the anionic metabolite standards appear in the region between 10 and 28 min.\nCheck whether three structurally related isomers, i.e., D-Glucose-1-phosphate, D-Glucose-6-phosphate and D-Fructose-6-phosphate are partially separated, i.e., the resolution between the first two peaks is circa 0.75 and of the last two peaks is circa 0.50 (see Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: A resolution of 1.5 indicates a baseline separation of two adjacent peaks.\nRepeat steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 for the cationic metabolite mixture. Ensure that MS detection is now in positive ion mode and CE voltage is +30 kV.\nAnalyze the recorded data by determining the migration times and the signal intensity of the analyzed cationic metabolite mixture.\nAssess whether the cationic metabolite standards appear in the region between 8 and 22 min. Check whether isoleucine and leucine are migrating between 15 and 15.5 min and determine if the resolution is circa 0.5.\nAnalysis of biological samples\nRepeat steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 for anionic metabolic profiling of the extract of the glioblastoma cell line.",
    "NOTE: The metabolic content obtained after sample pretreatment corresponds to a cell density of circa 20 cells/nl, therefore, a 20 nl injection is the equivalent of 400 cells per analysis. .\nCreate an extracted ion electropherogram for the metabolite lactic acid (m/z 89.0243) using 5 mDa mass accuracy and check whether the signal intensity is above 100,000 counts.\nRepeat steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 for cationic metabolic profiling of the extract of the glioblastoma cell line.\n\t\tNOTE: A highly information-rich total ion electropherogram should be observed for a 20 nl injection in this mode.\nAfter the analyses or when not in use, rinse the capillary with water at 50 psi for 15 min and store the inlet part of the capillary in a vial containing water and the porous section (outlet part) in a tube also containing water."
