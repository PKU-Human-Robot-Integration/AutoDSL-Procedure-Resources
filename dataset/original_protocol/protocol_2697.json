It is difficult to make 0.1% Triton X-100 directly from Triton X-100 because it is very viscous.\nCritical: Make sure cells do not dry out during any step. If cells become dry, it will compromise the experimental efficiency and increase background autofluorescence.\nRinse cells twice with PBST.\nNote: To make PBST, add 1 mL of Tween-20 to 1 L of PBS. Make PBST one day prior to the experiment in order to prevent excess bubble formation.\nAdd 1 mL of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST and incubate cells for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.",

When suspension cells and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are used for mt-dsRNA visualization, users must test and optimize the conditions appropriately.

The last Amp (Amp 4-FL) has several alternatives to determine the final fluorescence per channel as summarized below.

Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOption 3: RNA extraction and strand-specific RT-qPCR\nThis option covers the steps of extracting RNA from cultured cells and quantitatively analyzing the expression of mtRNAs from both heavy and light strands.\nOption 3-1: RNA extraction\nTiming: 3 days\nNote: It is essential to remove all RNases and fine dust before starting the experiment by wiping the bench with 10% bleach (sodium hypochlorite) followed by 70% EtOH. RNases, especially those in the RNase A family, contain multiple cysteine residues that form intramolecular disulfide bonds.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] In particular, RNase A acts as an endonuclease by specifically cleaving the P-O5′ bond of RNA after pyrimidine residues.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Bleach eliminates the universally present RNase A by inducing the cleavage of disulfide bonds.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Commercial systems, such as RNaseZap, can be used instead.\nSeed cells in an appropriate dish.\nAfter trypsinization, transfer 3 × 105 cells in 1 mL of the culture medium to a 6-well plate.\nIncubate cells in a humid 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nAspirate the culture medium.\nAdd 1 mL/well of TRIzol directly onto cells grown in a 6-well plate.\nSuspend the solution by pipetting up and down until all cells are dissolved in TRIzol and transfer the solution into a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 200 μL of chloroform and vortex the solution thoroughly for 30 s.",
    "Centrifuge the sample at 13,523 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to a 1.5 mL G-Tube.\nCritical: Avoid touching the middle layer to prevent contamination that may compromise the RNA quality.\nNote: It is better to use a 200 μL rather than 1,000 μL tip to carefully and thoroughly remove the aqueous layer.\nAdd 600 μL of an isopropanol mixture solution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_10.csv\nFor multiple samples, multiply each volume by the number of samples.\nVortex for 5 s and incubate the sample at −20°C for 18 h.\nCentrifuge the sample at 21,130 × g for at least 1 h at 4°C. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 75% ethanol at 13,523 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and repeat the wash step.\nAir-dry for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: To minimize the time required to dry the pellets, spin down the tube and remove the remaining ethanol with 200 μL and 10 μL tips combined. Residual ethanol will lower the RNA quality. Overdried pellets may not dissolve well in RNase-free water.\nNote: While air-drying, protect the RNA pellet by covering the microtubes with plastic wrap.\nAdd 42 μL of RNase-free water to the sample and dissolve the pellet thoroughly by pipetting.\nAdd 8 μL of a DNase I mixture solution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_11.csv\nFor multiple samples, multiply each volume by the number of samples.\nMix the solution by tapping and spin down the sample.\nIncubate the sample in a 37°C heat block for 30 min.\nAdd 150 μL of RNase-free water and 200 μL of acid-phenol.\nVortex vigorously for 30 s.\nCentrifuge the sample at 13,523 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.",

Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: After dissolving the RNA pellet, measure the concentration and analyze RNA quality. The ratio of 28S:18S rRNA observed by gel electrophoresis should be greater than 2.0 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The ratio of A260/A280 and A260/A230 should be 1.8–2.0 and higher than 2.0, respectively, when analyzed by a spectrophotometer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2352-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analyzing RNA quality using gel electrophoresis\n1 μg of intact and degraded total RNAs extracted from HEK-293T cells were run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bands were detected by EtBr staining and the intensity ratio (28S rRNA/18S rRNA) was determined, which was 2.0 for the intact RNA sample. In the case of partially degraded sample, the rRNA ratio was 1.7, and for the completely degraded sample, we could not calculate the ratio.\nPause point: RNA samples can be stored at −80°C for a year.\nOption 3-2: Strand-specific RT-qPCR\nTiming: ∼2 h",
    "Critical: While optimizing strand-specific RT-qPCR, we compared various types of reverse transcription primer (RTP) tags. RTP tags were designed based on sequences from SP6 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2352-Mmc1.extension]). The Cq values of the abundant housekeeping gene Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used to verify the reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification efficiency. The sample using CMV tag resulted in significantly lower Cq values with more reliable and reproducible results (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Therefore, we used CMV sequences for strand-specific RTP to analyze mt-dsRNAs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2352-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Comparison of GAPDH Cq values for three different RTP tags on the same amount of RNAs extracted from HEK-293T cells\nEach Cq value is the average of three biological replicates.\nPrepare 4 μM RTP stock.\nTo make an RTP stock, mix 100 μM of primer stocks to make a total concentration of 4 μM.\nNote: For example, if you have four 100 μM primers, add 1 μL of each primer and 96 μL of triple distilled water (TDW).\nMake a strand-specific RT pre-mixture solution in a PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_12.csv\nHeat the pre-mixture solution at 65°C for 5 min and cool the sample at 4°C.\nAdd 7 μL of a strand-specific RT second mixture solution. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_13.csv\nFor multiple samples, multiply each volume by the number of samples.\nAlternatives: For reverse transcription, other reverse transcriptases such as RevertAid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) can be used.\nIncubate the sample in a PCR machine with the following procedure.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_14.csv\nPause point: cDNA samples can be stored at −20°C for a year.\nTo prepare a 3 μM of qPCR primer mix, add 3 μL of the target (sense or antisense) and tag-only qPCR primer stock (100 μM) to 94 μL of TDW.\nPrepare a strand-specific qPCR pre-mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2352_15.csv",
    "For multiple samples, multiply each volume by the number of samples.\nNote: For accurate analysis, a technical triplicate is highly recommended.\nCritical: Make sure to use a target sequence (sense or antisense) and a tag-only sequence as the forward and reverse primer, respectively. If you use sense and antisense of mtRNA sequences, for example, ND1 sense as a forward and ND1 antisense as a reverse primer, you will amplify both strands of mt-dsRNAs, which is the same as the conventional qPCR method.\nAdd 14 μL of the strand-specific qPCR pre-mixture in each well of a 96-well PCR plate.\nCarefully add 1 μL of cDNA and seal the plate with an optical adhesive film.\nNote: Be careful not to generate bubbles as they can cause inaccurate fluorescent readings. To remove bubbles, spin down the plate for 30 s using a centrifuge.\nCentrifuge the plate for 5 s.\nRun qPCR using the following procedure.
