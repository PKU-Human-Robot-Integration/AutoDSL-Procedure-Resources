  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the Le Moyne College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All use of animals was in agreement with the policies described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals8.\nNOTE: (Critical) Prior to experimentation, obtain all necessary approvals and training required for animal use. It is important the experimenters are familiarized with the mouse behaviors and activity levels, including signs of sleep, distress, and/or movement artifact vs. normal sniffing and breathing.\n1. Whole-body Barometric Plethysmography Chamber\nRead the appropriate user manuals for the barometric plethysmography chamber, including connectors, O-rings, etc., and create a standard protocol file to define analyzers (e.g., metabolic) and parameters specific to the software.\nMake sure all hoses and tubes are connected to the chamber. Connect a gas flow tube (flow-in) and a vacuum tube (flow-out) directly to the barometric plethysmography chamber.\nNOTE: The inflow must be attached to the opening marked bias flow.\nAttach CO2, O2, and N2 gas tanks to the gas mixer. Make sure all gas tanks are in the open position prior to experimentation.\n2. Calibration of the Barometric Plethysmograph Chamber\nCalibrate a high and a low flow of gas by selecting the 7700-Amplifier Setup under the Hardware tab of the barometric plethysmography software.\nSet a vacuum (flow out of the chamber) appropriate for the experimental design and gas analyzers (~0.1 L/min).\nNOTE: The outflow rate must remain the same throughout the calibrations and experiment for accurate metabolic recordings.\nSet a low flow of air by removing the flow tube from the chamber and turning off the vacuum.\nRecord the zero flow by entering a 0 into the Low Unit cell for the corresponding chamber. Double-click the Low Cal cell, change the time to 3 s, and hit Measure.",
    "Reattach the flow tube and allow gas (20.93% O2, balanced N2) to flow through the barometric plethysmography chamber from the gas mixer.\nConvert the inflow from liters/minutes into milliliters/second. Click the High Unit cell for the corresponding chamber and enter the value in milliliters/second. Double-click High Cal, change the time to 3 s, and click Measure.\nLeave the 7700-Amplifier Setup tab open to calibrate the metabolic analyzers to the barometric plethysmography software.\n3. Metabolic Analyzer Calibration\nIn the gas mixer program, set the gas mixer to release a flow of gas containing 20.93% O2 and 79.07% N2.\nOn the metabolic analyzers, set the O2 calibration level to 20.93% and the CO2 to read 0%. Turn the dial back to Sample once the appropriate values are entered.\nSet the high O2 percentage. Click on the ABCD-4 tab of the barometric plethysmography software and then enter 20.93 under High Unit of the C2 line. Under High Cal, change the time to 3 s and hit Measure.\nSet the low CO2 percentage. Enter 0 under Low Cal of the C3 line, and then change the time to 3 s and click Measure under Low Cal.\nIn the gas mixer program, change the O2 value to 10% and the CO2 value to 5%. Wait several minutes for the gas flow to adjust to these values. On the metabolic analyzers, turn the adjustment knobs to calibrate CO2 equal to 5%. Be sure to turn the dial back to Sample once the values are calibrated.\nSet the high CO2 percentage. Ensure the analyzer readings are stable before inserting appropriate values into the O2 and CO2 on the barometric plethysmography software. Click High Unit under C3 and enter 5. Change High Cal to 3 s and hit Measure.",
    "Set the low O2 percentage. Click Low Unit under the C2 option and enter 10. Click Low Cal, input 3 s, and click Measure.\nChange the gas values on the gas mixer back to 20.93% O2 and 79.07% N2. Wait several minutes for the chamber to adjust to these values. Repeat the steps 3.1‒3.7 if the metabolic analyzers do not automatically read 20.93% O2 and 0% CO2, to ensure proper calibration. Routinely confirm proper calibration with certified gas tanks.\nRecheck the flow meters connected to the barometric plethysmography chamber. Adjust the air flow into and out of the chamber to rates appropriate for the experiment (typically, 0.1–0.3 L/min).\nOnce all settings have been applied to the barometric plethysmography software, click OK to begin recording.\n4. Unrestrained Barometric Plethysmography\nRecord the mouse’s weight and initial body temperature. Wait 10 min before placing the mouse in the chamber, to collect O2 and CO2 data from an empty chamber. Work in a quiet area familiar to the mice so noise and smells do not interfere with the data collection. Avoid any possible disruptions, including the opening and closing of doors or personnel moving in/out of the data collection room.\nNOTE: This specific protocol employed 22 month-old male C57BL/6J mouse.\nDuring the first hour, document the behaviors of the mouse and take detailed notes, including specific values of the flow in/out of the chamber.\nAfter 60 min of chamber habituation, watch for segments of quiet breathing for the following 60 min. List any segments lasting at least 15 s in length without sniffing and grooming. Take body temperature measures every 10 min when using an implantable device.",
    "At the end of the experiment, remove the mouse from the chamber and place it back in its cage. All equipment should be cleaned and wiped down thoroughly. If droplets of water remain, use pressurized air to remove them.\n5. Analysis of Pattern of Breathing and Metabolism\nOpen the barometric plethysmography review file and consult the recorded notes for the animal of interest.\nOpen the Metabolic panel in the software and take the average of the first 10 min of O2 and CO2, when the chamber was empty. Record these values as the FiO2 and FiCO2.\nView the Flow panel of the barometric plethysmography software. Right-click Analyze Attributes and set appropriate parameters. Under the Meta 1 tab, enter the FiO2 and FiCO2 from step 5.2, as well as the flow into the chamber under Meta 2, to calculate VO2 and VCO2.\nFor pattern of breathing analysis, confirm the times for the 15 seconds of quiet breathing using notes about animal behavior as well as the flow panel tracing. Enter the times for the 15 s intervals of quiet breathing under Open Data Parser Dialogue from the Data Parser tab. Click Parser View Mode to only show the specific 15 s segments of interest.\nClick Save Parsed Derived Data. Open the data file in a spreadsheet to obtain the binned data.\n6. Analysis of Apneas and Augmented Breaths\nIn the open review file, exit Parser View Mode. Go into the Graph Setup option under Setup > P3 Setup and select Page View under Type. Select 5 for the number of panes. Enter -2 into the box labeled Low and 2 into the box labeled High for flow measures in milliliters/second. Apply the changes.\nScroll to the 30 min mark on the flow tracings panel.",
    "Count apneas and augmented breaths for the 30–60 min after the mouse was placed in the chamber. Quantify periods of suspended breathing lasting longer than or equal to 0.5 s, indicative of an apnea. Augmented breaths are indicated by a sharp rise in the breathing trace above 1.25 mL/s followed by a sharp decrease below -0.75 mL/s.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
