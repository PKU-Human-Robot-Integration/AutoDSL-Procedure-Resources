    "The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Honghui Hospital Xi'an Jiaotong University. Informed consent was obtained from the patients.\n1. Diagnosis of femoral neck fracture by X-ray fluoroscopy\nIdentify patients who have a femoral neck fracture with tenderness or percussed pain around the hip joint, shortening of the lower extremity, limitation of the hip joint, etc.\nUse an antero-posterior (AP) view and a lateral view of an X-ray fluoroscopy or CT scan to diagnose the femoral neck fracture.\nOrder FNS treatment for patients who are less than 60 years old and diagnosed with femoral neck fracture. Use these additional criteria for inclusion: fracture with a clear history of trauma; no history or evidence of metabolic diseases or pathological fractures; well-developed hip joint, with no manifestations of FHN and no deformity; a diagnosis of femoral neck fracture by an X-ray or CT scan.\n2. Fracture close reduction, X-ray examination, and preparation of the robot-assisted orthopedic surgery system\nAfter general anesthesia, conduct closed reduction of fracture by manual traction and adjustment.\n\t\nRestore the length of the affected limb by longitudinal traction with the surgeon holding the limb for traction, and restore the alignment of the fracture gap through limb rotation.\nFix the limb to the traction bed (a kind of operation table that provides continuous limb traction) for continuous traction during the operation.\nExamine the quality of the closed reduction by X-ray fluoroscopy. Restore the neck-shaft angle and alignment of the cortex in the AP and lateral views, and ensure that no angular deformities occur.\nBefore the operation, connect the components of the robot-assisted orthopedic surgery system-the workstation, the optical tracking system, and the robotic arm-with the C-arm X-ray machine. Log into the system, and record the patient's medical records.\n3. Disinfection, image collection, and surgical path planning",
    "After routine surgical disinfection, place a Schanz pin on the ipsilateral iliac wing, and fix the patient's tracer on the pin.\nPut sterile protective sleeves on the robotic arm and C-arm. Assemble the positioning ruler (with the 10 identification points on the positioning ruler for the robot positioning system) with the robotic arm.\nPosition the C-arm X-ray machine centrally to the femoral neck, and put the robotic arm with the positioning ruler between the C-arm and the patient. Ensure that there is no obstruction of the optical tracking system, including the patient tracer and the robotic arm.\nCollect AP view (the X-ray image intensifier is perpendicular to the plane of the patient) and lateral view (the X-ray image intensifier is perpendicular to the femoral neck channel plane) X-ray images containing the 10 identification points of the positioning ruler.\nImport the AP and lateral view images into the workstation; the images must clearly contain 10 identification points and the entire proximal femur.\nPerform surgical screw path planning on the software of the workstation.\n\t\nLocate the screw channel in the center of the femoral neck, with a neck-shaft angle of 130Â° and parallel to the long axis of the femoral neck on the AP and lateral views.\nLocate the tip of the screw 5 mm under the cartilage of the femoral head.\n4. FNS placement and verification\nReplace the positioning ruler to the sleeve on the robotic arm. Run the robotic arm to the position of the entry point according to the planned path. Make a 3 cm incision on the skin along the long axis of the femur with a knife, blunt separate the subcutaneous tissue, and insert the sleeve to contact the bone cortex.",
    "Confirm the entry point and direction of the sleeve in accordance with the planned path. Fine-tune the path if necessary.\nDrill the guide wire into the bone through the sleeve until it is 5 mm from the subchondral bone. Remove the robotic arm, and check the position of the guide wire by X-ray.\nReam the hole along the guide wire using a hollow drill bit, and insert the bolt and plate into the femoral head. Place the anti-rotation screw and locking screw.\nApply dynamic compression using the compression design of the FNS. The fluoroscopy verifies the FNS placement, with the bolt in the center of the femoral neck both on the AP and lateral views and 5 mm from the subchondral bone, and with the plate fitting the bone.\nSuggest assisted passive hip flexion activities and active exercise of the knee and ankle joints post-operation. Perform follow-ups at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 48 weeks postoperatively, with the weight-bearing time depending on the follow-up.\nSubscription Required.
