The culture has few weeks of finite life at 4°C, thus, a glycerol stock should be prepared for long term storage (described below). The addition of glycerol stabilizes the frozen bacteria, preventing cell membrane damage keeping the cells alive. A glycerol stock of bacteria can be stored stably at −80°C for many years. To recover the bacteria from the glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop to scrape the frozen bacteria off from the top, and grow the bacteria from 12–16 h using the appropriate medium. Importantly, do not let the glycerol stock unthaw.\nThe protocol below describes a rapid alkaline lysis miniprep method. The method works very well producing high quality DNA in terms of concentration and purity. However, commercial alternatives such as Nucleobond Xtra BAC kit (Macherey-Nagel), BACMAX purification kit (Cambio) or QIAGEN Large-construct kit (QIAGEN) are also available.\nStreak a small amount of E. coli onto a selective plate and incubate from 12–16 h at 37°C to obtain single colonies.\nPick a single colony and inoculate into 10 mL of lysogeny broth (LB) medium containing the selective antibiotic in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nCritical: Culture poor aeration may contribute to produce a low DNA yield. The optimal culture volume to air volume ratio is 1:4 or less.\nGrow with vigorous shaking at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 12–16 h.\nNote: Freeze each plasmid mixing 800 μl of bacteria culture and 200 μl of sterile glycerol. Store at −80°C.",
    "Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifuging at 1792 g (4,000 rpm) for 10 min. The temperature or the spin is not critical at this stage. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 300 μL of GTE buffer and transfer it to a 2.2 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 600 μL of freshly made lysis solution, mix gently by inverting, and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCritical: From this step onwards, the DNA is already suspended in the solution, improper handling by incomplete mixing of buffer, excessive mechanical treatment or by prolonged incubation during the lysis step may contribute to genomic DNA contamination or DNA shearing, thus, avoid vigorous shaking and repetitive pipetting. Mix gently by inverting the tube four to six times.\nSlowly add 500 μL of neutralization buffer drop by drop, mix by inverting the tube four to six times (do not vortex), and incubate on ice for 10 min. A thick white precipitate of bacterial DNA and protein will form.\nCentrifuge at 11200 g (10,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant using a P1000 pipette to a new 2.2 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 11200 g (10,000 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant using a P1000 pipette to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 700 μL of ice-cold isopropanol trying to avoid any white precipitate material.\nMix by inverting the tube a few times.\nCentrifuge at 21952 g (14,000 rpm) for 20 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the DNA pellet with 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol.\nMix by inverting the tube several times\nCentrifuge at 21,952 g (14,000 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove as much supernatant as possible with a pipette and air-dry the pellet at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.",
    "Once the pellet turns from white to translucent in appearance, dissolve the DNA into 100 μL of nuclease-free water by gentle occasional tapping of the tube.\nAdd 1 μL of RNAse (100 ug/mL) and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nPrecipitate the DNA in a mix of 1/10 vol 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 vol of 100% ethanol for 60 min at −80°C.\nCentrifuge at 21,952 g (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the DNA pellet with 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol\nCentrifuge at 21,952 g (14,000 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and dissolve the DNA into 100 μL of nuclease-free water.\nCheck the DNA integrity by running a 1% agarose gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/757-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Exemplary analytical check of DNA integrity after miniprep BAC clones purification\n(A) Representative images of 5 ul of each precipitated BAC analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The red square represents the sheared and DNA smear low yield DNA extractions. (B) Suitable DNA for labeling protocol. Arrows indicate not sheared BAC DNA.\nNote: The agarose gel electrophoresis allows us to confirm the efficiency of the Nick translation reaction by analyzing the product size distribution.\nNote: The quality of the probe is vital for a successful FISH, and this is in turn strictly related to the quality of the DNA template. Make sure to use good quality, purified DNA, free of RNA, protein or other contaminants. The purity of the preparation should be determined using classical gel electrophoresis.\nStore at −20°C.",
    "Note: The average yield of the DNA should be approximately 4–8 μg. Commercial alkaline lysis/column purifications kits can be used as an alternative. However, in our hands the alkaline lysis miniprep method described above produces high yields of high-quality DNA needed for the Nick translation protocol.\nCritical: Multiple freeze-thraw cycles or storage at 4°C during extended periods (1–2 months) may produce extensive nicks and breakages. It is important to use freshly prepared BACs, or store the DNA in alcohol in precipitated form, for a maximum of 4–6 months.\nFish probe preparation: DNA labeling\nTiming: 2–3 h and 8–16 h of incubation\nNote: Probes can be labeled by direct incorporation of nucleotides conjugated to fluorochromes (i.e., fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethyl rhodamine). Generally, deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (dUTP) is conjugated directly to the fluorochrome and used in the place of dTTP in a labeling reaction. Labeling approximately 1 μg of extracted DNA is enough for ten FISH experiments when using a commercially available kit for labeling DNA with modified dNTPs (i.e., Roche or ThermoFisher Nick Translation Kit).\nSet-up the Nick translation reaction in a final volume of 50 μL in a tube on ice.\nVortex and centrifuge the tube for 10 s.\nIncubate the tube for 90 min at 16°C.\nPlace the reaction on ice and determine the product size distribution by running 5 μL of the mix in a 1% agarose gel.\nCritical: Successful Nick translation will result in a smear with the bulk of the fragments running between 150 bp and 700 bp (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). When labeled DNA fragments are too small (>150 bp), they might not hybridize efficiently to DNA; hence, FISH signals would not be visible. Incubation time will vary according to the amount and quality of BAC DNA and the effectiveness of the Nick translation enzyme.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/757-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Exemplary Analytical Check of Probe Size Determination by 1% Agarose Electrophoresis\nAs the incubation time increases the size distribution shifts to smaller probe fragments ((A) 60 min digestion; (B) 120 min digestion). Image A represents an optimal digestion experiment whereas image B is over-digested. Red squares indicate the bulk of the fragments.\nNote: The structure and net charge of the different fluorophores affect the migration pattern on the gel. The unincorporated dUTP appears on the gel as brighter areas. Unincorporated Green_dUTP appears at the bottom of the run and Orange_dUTP appears around the 500 bp region overlapping with the probe DNA smear.\nIf the size of the bulk of the fragments is larger than 500 bp incubate the mix for another 30 min at 16°C, if not, inactivate DNaseI by incubating the mix at 75°C for 10 min.\nPurify the DNA with a PCR purification kit (i.e., QIAGEN), and elute in 60 μL of nuclease-free water.\nPrecipitate the DNA in a mix of 1/10 vol 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 2.5 vol of 100% ethanol, and 1 μg of Cot-1 DNA.\nNote: Mouse or human Cot-1 DNA is a mixture of highly repetitive DNA sequences, use to block non-specific hybridization of FISH probes.\nIncubate from 12-16 h at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 21,952 g (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash pellet with 500 μL 70% ethanol and allow to air dry.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 μL of nuclease free-water.\nStore at −20°C.\nNote: The DNA is stable in water for long periods (up to 1–2 years) if stored at −20°C until use.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue section preparation\nTiming: 1 h to cut 5 blocks with 5 slides each\nNote: Time dependents on the number of blocks and the number of cuts required.",
    "In Brandt et al., FFPE of intestinal tissues obtained from MCRS1(lox/lox)Int, mTOR(lox/lox)Int and p55(lox/lox)Int mice were used (Brandt et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Importantly, these steps describe a general protocol for FFPE mouse and human tissue preparation. Thus any FFPE tissue derived from any organism (human/mouse/etc) can be used.\nCut FFPE tissue sections of 4–6 μm and mounted them on a poly-L-lysine-coated or positively-charged glass slide.\nNote: Use gloves at all times when handling specimens. All reagents should be handled as if hazardous.\nPretreatment of FFPE tissue sections\nTiming: 3 h and 8–16 h of incubation\nNote: This step describes the protocol to pre-treat FFPE tissue sections. Formalin fixation introduces a macromolecular network which significantly reduces the access of FISH probes to target DNA. For that reason, the slides need to be pre-treated to diminish the extracellular matrix of proteins which potentially limit the accessibility of the probe to the cells, preventing tissue autofluorescence. Only tissues preserved in neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded are suitable for use. Other fixatives are not suitable. The use of tissue exposed to acid decalcification is not recommended. EDTA as decalcifier has been reported to preserve the DNA better for FISH techniques.\nMelt the paraffin by incubating the slides at 65°C for 12–16 h.\nDeparaffinize the tissue slides in a xylene bath and incubate for 3 min at 65°C.\nCritical: Xylene can affect a person’s nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system. When handling xylene, work in a well-ventilated area, preferably a fume hood with downdraft fume extraction wearing protective clothing. Xylene must be properly stored in a well-ventilated area, that maintains a consistent temperature (15°C–25°C).\nChange the xylene bath and repeat once.\nTap gently on a paper towel to draw off the excess of liquid.\nPlace the slides in 100% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Change the ethanol bath and repeat once.\nTap off the excess of liquid.\nPlace the slides in 80% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nTap off the excess of liquid.\nPlace the slides in 70% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nHeat the water bath and the Pre-Treatment (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0) solution at 95°C–99°C in a plastic Coplin jar.\nNote: The Pre-Treatment Solution is designed for single use application only.\nImmerse the deparaffinized sections into 0.2 N HCL for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate the slides into the pre-heated Pre-Treatment solution for 20 min at 95°C–99°C.\nAllow the slides to cool in the Pre-Treatment Solution for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the slides in a Coplin jar with 1× PBS and soak the slides for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nReplace 1× PBS and soak the sections for another 3 min.\nDry the slides by touching gently the bottom edge and wiping the underside with a paper towel.\nAlternatives: Commercially available kits include Dako’s Histology FISH Accessory Kit, or Vysis IntelliFISH Universal FFPE Tissue Pretreatment and Wash Reagents, and can be used for the pre-treatment protocol.\nCritical: Breaking of peptide bonds by protease digestion is the key step of this protocol, affecting directly the signal quality since it allows the access of the FISH probes to the target DNA and reduces autofluorescence.\nDigest the pre-treated tissue by covering it with 40 μL of ready to use pepsin.\nIncubate samples for 30 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Digestion for shorter time that needed can led to background autofluorescence and incomplete hybridization; while over-digestion of tissue sections may result in the loss of signal, loss of tissue morphology, and can cause sections to detach from the slides.\nPlace the slides in 70% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Change ethanol bath and repeat once.\nTap off the excess of liquid.\nPlace the slides in 80% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–-25°C.\nTap off the excess of liquid.\nPlace the slides in 96% ethanol for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAir-dry the slides from 2 to 5 min.\nPlace the slide on a 45°C–50°C slide warmer to allow the remaining ethanol to evaporate.\nProbe hybridization\nTiming: 0.5 h and 8–16 h of incubation\nNote: This step describes the protocol to perform the FISH assay using a ThermoBrite instrument that automates the denaturation and hybridization steps in the FISH protocol. Refer to the ThermoBrite Operations Manual for instructions on instrument use.\nAlternatives: A heated plate can be used for the denaturation steps, and a humidified chamber or a plastic slide storage box containing moist tissue paper, incubated at 37°C can be used for the hybridization steps.\nMoisten humidity cards with water and place in the card slots of the ThermoBrite instrument. Ensure that the surface of the ThermoBrite instrument is clean and free of debris.\nSet the following conditions:\nDenaturation temperature (Melt Temp): 75°C Denaturation time (Melt Time): 3 min\nHybridization temperature (Hyb Temp): 37°C Hybridization time (Hyb Time): 16 h\nThaw labeled probe and Vysis IntelliFISH hybridization buffer (08N87-001) at 20°C–25°C.\nPrepare the probe mixture with 1 μL of labeled probe, 3 μL of nuclease-free water and 7 μL of hybridization buffer.\nVortex the mix and centrifuge using a micro-centrifuge for 2–3 s at maximum speed.\nApply 10 μL of the probe mixture to the center of each tissue section, and immediately apply a coverslip. Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the probe mixture prior to applying the coverslip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/757-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative images of step-by-step coverslip mounting for FISH probe hybridization",
    "From left to right, 10 μL of probe mixture is applied to the slide with the mounted tissue, immediately, an appropriated size coverslip is applied. Once no bubbles are present, the coverslip is sealed with rubber cement. Ensuring a proper sealing is key to avoid evaporation. After hybridization using the ThermoBrite denaturation-hybridization program (not shown), the rubber cement seal is carefully removed by pulling one of the corners of the seal with forceps.\nNote: The volume of the probe mixture, and the size of the coverslip can be changed according to the tissue size. An easy way to get rid of bubbles is to gently roll the tip of a pencil on the coverslip.\nSeal the coverslip with rubber cement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: Make sure that the rubber cement straddles the edge of the coverslip.\nCritical: No proper coverslip sealing can produce probe evaporation, this could interfered in the hybridization reaction of probe to DNA.\nPlace the slides on the ThermoBrite instrument and begin the denaturation-hybridization program.\nHybridize the slides incubating them from 12–16 h.\nSlide washes\nTiming: 0.5 h and 8–16 h of incubation\nNote: This step describes the protocol to perform the slide washes. Importantly the post-hybridization washes can significantly affect the intensity and stability of the FISH signal. When the conditions are inappropriate, for instance by using inadequate temperature or time of washing, background autofluorescence, unspecific signals or loss of the signals can appear.\nNote: 30 min before you start the slide washes pre-warm the wash solution\nPre-warm the wash solution (0.4× SSC/0.3% NP-40) in a Coplin jar at 75°C in a water bath for at least 30 min prior to use.\nPrepare a second container of 2× SSC/0.1% NP-40 at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: The wash solutions are for single use application only.",
    "Remove the rubber cement seal with forceps by gently pulling one of the corners of the seal (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the coverslip by soaking the slides in a Coplin jar with 2× SSC at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: If the cover slip does not come out, it can be removed by tapping gently the slide in the Coplin jar. If the coverslip is still stuck to the slide, slide the blade of a scalpel under one corner of the slide and lift it gently before immersing the slide into the Coplin jar. This may need to be repeated several times if the coverslip remains stuck.\nImmediately place the slide into the 0.4× SSC/0.3% NP-40 wash solution at 73 ± 1°C.\nAgitate the slide for 5 s.\nRepeat with each slide.\nNote: Do not wash more than four slides in each Coplin jar.\nWash the slide/s for 2 min into the 0.4× SSC/0.3% NP-40 wash solution at 73 ± 1°C.\nPlace the slide/s in the 2× SSC/0.1% NP-40 wash solution at 20°C–25°C.\nAgitate the slide for 5 s and let them stand for 5 min.\nAir dry slide in the dark.\nApply to every slide 10 μL of counterstain dye (0.5 vol 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI II/0.5 vol antifade) and mount the slides with a 25×50 mm coverslip.\nSelecting and enumerating cells for FISH analysis\nTiming: 5 h\nNote: This step describes how to select and enumerate cells within the selected target area, for fish quantification and analysis.\nAnalyze the FISH signals at 1000× magnification using the appropriate filters.\nSelect a representative area of the tissue with of good nuclear distribution (i.e., where individual nuclei can be distinguished (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/757-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Nuclei recognition by FISH: Selecting and enumerating cells within the selected target area",
    "(A–C) Exemplary of three representative areas of tissue with a good nuclear distribution. Individual nuclei can be distinguished and show a strong FISH signal together with weak or no fluorescence background. Only the tumor nuclei with intact nuclear membrane, that do not overlap are used for the analysis. Images were captured using a Leica DM5500B fluorescence microscope with a 100× objective running the Cytovision v7.4 software. (A–C) White dashed line highlights single nuclei that meet the described criteria; scale bars, 10 μm.\nUsing a 100× objective and prescribed filters enumerate and record the number of signals within each nucleus. Focus up and down to find all of the signal’s present in the nucleus.\nMove to another representative area for enumeration until 200–300 tumor cells have been enumerated.\nWe performed FISH imaging on a Leica DM 5500B fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100× oil-immersion objective, Leica DM DAPI, Aqua, Green and Orange fluorescence filter cubes and a CCD camera (Photometrics SenSys camera) connected to a PC running the Zytovision image analysis system (Applied Imaging Ltd., UK) with focus motor and Z stack software.\nNote: The background should not contain particles that interfere with enumeration. In some cases, fluorescent haze or glow may be noticeable outside of the nuclei, but it is acceptable as long as the fluorescent haze/glow does not cover the nuclei and interfere with the enumeration.\nNote: Probe signal intensity: Analyze signal intensity on single color filters. The signals should be bright, distinct, and easily evaluable. Signals should be compact, round or oval shapes. Rubbish generally appears to be brighter and shinier compared to real signals, and background appear fuzzy and indistinct compared to real signal. Overly diffuse signals should be avoided.",
    "Note: FISH signal analysis can be done manually or automatized by fluorescence image acquisition scanning systems. For manual analysis two experienced scientists or technicians should count the signals of each individual nucleus from 200–300 cells directly on the microscope using the appropriate filters. As an alternative, if the scientists or technicians have not enough expertise in microscopy analysis, then representative images can be captured to complete 200–300 cells. In this case, FISH signals can be counted based on the captured images.\nCIN analysis\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nNote: average time for an experienced observer to visualize one FISH probe slide.\nThe CIN score (CS) is a metric devised to quantify the alterations (copy number changes) detected in a sample, that would lead to chromosomal heterogeneity and could drive different cancer patterns from initiation, progression, evolution and drug resistance patterns. Depending on the size of the genomic alteration it can be classified as: structural CIN if it involves translocations, inversions, deletions and amplifications that range from genes to complete chromosome arms (Geigl et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]); or as numerical CIN if it involves whole chromosomes gain or losses.\nIn order to quantify these alterations, there are many available techniques, with their own pros and cons (Lepage et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Based in our research paper (Brandt et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we have detailed here how to measure the CS by FISH.\nTo perform manual FISH analysis, visualize, count and annotate every FISH signal of each nucleus under the microscope using its specific filter. Computes a summary index of the FISH signals based on all examined cells. Alternative FISH analysis can be done counting signals on captured images. Different capture platforms are available; some examples are Cytovision (Leica) or Metafer (MetaSystems). This step describes the protocol to perform the FISH analysis on captured images.",
    "Take representative images from several tissue areas that account for at least 200–300 nuclei signals. Select only intact nuclei that are not folded, overlapped or obstructed by debris (as described in the FISH protocol section) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/757-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Pepsin treatment calibration\nRepresentative pictures were serial sections of FFPE tissues were incubated at different time points with ready to use pepsin to test the correct time for digestion. Incubations were performed at (A) 30 min, (B) 45 min, (C) 60 min and (D) 120 min (only Dapi channel are shown) before probe hybridization. The total time of wash buffer incubation and hybridization was equal for all conditions. Images were captured using a Leica DM5500B fluorescence microscope with a 100× objective running the Cytovision v7.4 software. (A–D) scale bars, 10 μm.\nEvaluate and annotate the total number of signals of each nucleus for any of the probes designed before to start with the following one to determine the final 200–300 nuclei count.\nNote: CS is used to describe the aneuploidies within a given sample. When calculated for a single chromosome is known as CS, and for several stained chromosomes as CSC (CIN score combined).\nCalculate the   C S   value for each chromosome probe [e.g., CS for chromosomes 1, 2, or 3 (CS1, CS2, or CS3, respectively)] of a given sample, applying the following formula:\n  CSChrp = 1 / n  ∑  [  ( eChrp − oChrp )  ]   \nWhere:\n  n :   accounts for the number of nuclei analyzed.\n  oChrp  : are the observed signals for a specific chromosome (  p  ).\n  eChrp  : are the value that corresponds to the expected signals for the given chromosome (  p  ). The ep value is usually equal to 2, that is the number of signals for a wild type cell (2n).",
    "Sum each of the individual   C S   values to obtain the corresponding   C S C   for a given sample, as follows:\n   CSC =   ( CSChrp  +  CSChrq  +  CSChrr )   \nNote: Alternatively, an overall mean   C S   can be calculated for each sample by summing the CSC for each nucleus analyzed withing a sample and dividing by the total number of nuclei evaluated:\n   CSc = 1 / n  ∑  [  ( ep − op )  +  ( eq − oq )  ]   \nNote: As a reference,   C S c  =  0   indicates a wild type nucleus has been analyzed. By the contrary, a value higher than 0   ( C S c  >  0 )   indicates gains/losses of chromosomes and hence, a specific degree of chromosomal instability. The higher the value, the greater the instability."
