    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInitial acclimatization\nTiming: 7 days\nThis section describes how to acclimatize the animals to the experimental conditions.\nPlace the mice in individual cages and keep them under a reverse 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. Left them undisturbed for a week. The contact of the experimenter and the mice should be kept at a minimum to provide the mice with food and water ad libitum. It is best if all mice are housed in the same room until the CUS protocol is started.\nNote: In order to receive reproducibility, mice ordered from not breeding in–house should be acclimatized for up to 2 weeks in the dedicated experimental room with reversed light/dark cycle.\nHandling\nTiming: 7 days\nThis section describes the handling procedure which aims to accustom the mice to the experimenter and to avoid additional stress during the CUS protocol and behavioral tests.\nAfter acclimatization to the experimental room, apply daily handling for 7 consecutive days in the dark phase of the dark/light cycle under red light. Handling should be performed by all persons who will carry out further procedures on the animals. To achieve the most consistent results, it is best the number of experimenters will be limited to 2–3.\nWear nitrile gloves and a lab coat that was contaminated with a mouse scent. Use the same lab coat during the whole handling procedure.\nOn the first day, grasp the mice by the base of the tail with your thumb and forefinger and then place them on top of the cage for 2 min.\nOn the second and third days, place the mice on the sleeve of the laboratory coat for 2 min.",
    "From the fourth day to the seventh day, put animals directly into your open hands for 2 min before being returned to their home cages.\nNote: Only C57BL/6 mice (not CD1 mice and Wistar rats) require handling.\nDetermination of baseline parameters and assignment of animals to experimental groups\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes how to measure baseline parameters and assign animals to experimental groups.\nMeasure baseline sucrose preference and weight before starting the chronic stress protocol. Based on the obtained results, mice will be assigned to 2 groups: the control and stressed groups.\nOne day after the seventh day of handling provide a 2.5% sucrose solution (dissolved in standard drinking water) for 2 h to prevent the possible confounding effects of taste neophobia. Do not give the mice access to standard water during this time.\nGive animals fresh food directly into the cage (not only in the feeder).\nCritical: Do not change the location of cages in the room before the test.\nCritical: Do not change the bedding immediately prior to testing. It is best to do this for the last time 5–6 days before the test.\nThe next day, perform the sucrose preference test as previously described (Bijata et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Krzystyniak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Strekalova and Steinbusch, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Strekalova et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Perform all procedures during the dark phase of the dark/light cycle. Briefly turn on the red light while inserting the bottles.\nCritical: If more than one room is used for the test, the humidity in both rooms should be the same. This affects both fluid viscosity and total fluid intake in mice.",
    "Critical: Place the water for the preparation of the sucrose solution into the experimental room at least one day beforehand to bring the solutions to room temperature. Prepare the sucrose solution from the same batch of water that will be placed in the water bottles. Make the sucrose solution fresh immediately before the test.\nCritical: Fill the bottles with water and the same volume of sucrose solution. This has an effect on the weight of the water droplets. When using Tecniplast 280 mL bottles and caps, filling them to 150 mL, results in the drop of water usually being approx. 0.1 g. If you notice that a drop has fallen while inserting or switching the bottles, note it and include it in your final results.\nPour into bottles 1% sucrose solution and water (1 bottle with water and 1 bottle with sucrose solution per cage) and then weigh bottles. This measurement will later be referred to as “sucrose_t0” and “water_t0”.\nLabel the bottles with the mouse number and type of solutions.\nGive the mice a free choice to drink 1% sucrose solution and water provided in identical transparent bottles for 8 h.\nTo eliminate the possible effects of side preference, switch the positions of the bottles after 4 h of testing.\nWeigh the bottles after 8 h to estimate the consumption of water and sucrose solution. This measurement will later be referred to as “sucrose_t1” and “water_t1”.\nCalculate sucrose preference as follows: sucrose preference = [”sucrose_t1”-“sucrose_t0” / (”sucrose_t1”-“sucrose_t0” + ”water_t1”-“water_t0”)] × 100%.",
    "Note: It is better to use the volume of fluids consumed by the animals when calculating sucrose preferences. However, accurate measurement of such a small volume (approx. 0.5–10 mL) in bottles can be problematic. Therefore, due to the small difference in densities (0.4%, water density 998 kg / m³, 1% sucrose solution density 1,002 kg/m3 at 20°C), the weight of the drunk liquids is a sufficient parameter and the most optimal approach.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]: Baseline sucrose preference below 70%.\nWeigh each mouse.\nCritical: Do not weigh the mice before performing the sucrose preference test. Weighing is an additional stress for the mice and may disturb the sucrose preference test results.\nBased on the results of sucrose preference and body weight measurements, assign the animals to the control and stressed groups (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1947-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Experiments named 1–4 represent four independent CUS experiments performed in the same animal facility.\nThe data are presented as the mean ± SD; ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.\nNote: In the stressed group, approximately 50% of the animals develop anhedonic behavior and approximately 50% display resilient behavior. If the size of the groups at the end of the experiment is the same, assign twice as many mice to the stress group (e.g., 10 control animals and 20 stressed mice).",
    "Critical: Select mice in the control and stressed groups in such a manner that both groups have similar means (confirmed by Student t-test) and standard deviations (confirmed by Fisher's F test) of sucrose preference and body weight measurements (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nChronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol\nTiming: 14 days\nThis section describes how to implement a chronic unpredictable stress protocol to induce anhedonic and resilient behaviors.\nTo induce anhedonic and resilient behaviors, animals assigned to the stressed group are subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The CUS protocol involves 2 weeks of daily exposure to two out of three different stressors selected in a semi-random manner. Stressors are applied during the dark phase of the dark/light cycle under red light in the following order: social defeat for 30 min, restraint stress for 2 h, and tail suspension for 40 min with an intersession interval of at least 3 h. During the light phase of the dark/light cycle, the mice are exposed to predator stress by being placed in the vicinity of a rat for 12 h (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1947_1.csv\nSPT – sucrose preference test, SPT BS - bottles switch sides after 4 h of testing, SS – social defeat stress, RS - restraint stress, RAT - exposure to a predator (rat), TS - tail suspension stress, FST – forced swim test, BW - body weight measurement.\nMove the animals that will be subjected to stress to a separate room. The control animals remain in the current room.\nNote: If it is not possible to provide a separate room for the stressed mice, the mice may be kept in the same room as the CD1 mice and rats used for predator stress.",
    "Critical: Keep the control C57BL/6 mice in a separate room. During the stress protocol performed on the stressed group, handle the control mice on average once every four days. If handling control mice, do so before any contact with stressed mice and rats.\nThe stress protocol begins with exposure to a predator.\nPlace the mice individually in transparent, well-ventilated cylinders (as described in “Preparation of cylinders for predator stress”) with standard food and bedding.\nNote: We don't provide water source to mice during their exposure to a predator.\nPlace the cylinders in the home cage of a male Wistar rat for 12 h.\nNote: Label the cylinder with the mouse number. This way you will avoid confusing the mice and will be able to compare the measurement results after the CUS protocol with the baseline results.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, subject the mice to social defeat stress.\nFor each 30-min social defeat session, place one aggressive CD1 mouse into each home cage of the C57BL/6J mouse.\nObserve if the C57BL/6J mice exhibit signs of social defeat stress, such as a fight response, submissive posture, and vocalization.\nCritical: Prevent the mice from fighting, which may lead to injury. Every time that social defeat stress is applied, carefully check the mice for any injuries. This is best done during the light phase when placing the mice in the cylinder (point 11). Unnoticed injury may lead to infection and additional stress in mice.\nCritical: Social defeat stress is also exhausting for the aggressor. One CD1 mouse should participate in a maximum of two 30 min consecutive social stressing sessions in one day. If another stress session is necessary on the same day, allow the mice to rest for at least one hour.",
    "Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3] Mice do not display signs of social defeat stress.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5] Interactions between mice are too aggressive.\nTroubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7] Injury in mice.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, subject the mice to restraint stress.\nPlace the mice inside a transparent plastic tube (as described in “Preparation of transparent plastic tube for the restraint stress”) for 2 h.\nAfter the mice are removed, thoroughly wash each tube, disinfect with 70% ethanol, and allow to dry.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, repeat the exposure to a predator as described in point 11.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, subject the mice to tail suspension stress. Hang the mice by their tails using adhesive tape 50 cm above the floor for 40 min (standard stable low desk may be used).\nNote: To prevent the mice from climbing their tails, place plastic cylinders at the base of their tails (as described in “Preparation of climbstoppers”).\nNote: When suspending the mouse, attach the identifier of the mouse next to it. This way you will avoid confusing the mice and will be able to compare the measurement results (i.e., body weight and sucrose preference) after the CUS protocol with the baseline results.\nCritical: Always ensure that the mouse is suspended correctly and will not fall. At the same time, check that the tail is not strongly bent because this may lead to tail ischemia and necrosis.\nAfter a minimum of 3 h, subject the mice to the next stressors according to the sequence described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nNote: During the first days of the protocol, stressed animals may need more frequent changes in bedding.",
    "Note: During the CUS protocol, cages with mice are often opened. Always be sure that the water bottles are not leaking and are placed in the correct position when closing the cage. A leak from the bottle may cause additional stress due to wet bedding.\nCritical: Start the last stressor (i.e., restraint stress) at the latest at 3 pm to stabilize blood levels of stress hormones prior to behavioral evaluation.\nTroubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9] Atypical apathetic behavior in mice.\nMove CD1 mice and Wistar rats to a separate room.\nBehavioral evaluation\nTiming: 1 day\nBehavioral evaluation aims to identify anhedonic and resilient animals. Two tests are performed: the sucrose preference test and the forced swim test. Based on the results of the sucrose preference test after CUS protocol, animals are assigned to the group of anhedonic or resilient phenotypes. The cut off value for anhedonia is defined by the mean value minus 2×SD of the sucrose preference found in the control mice. In our experiments, this value is between 68% and 72%. However, we recommend to establish the threshold de novo for each set of experiments. The forced swim test is intended to provide additional confirmation of depressive phenotype (Can et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Porsolt et al., 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nApproximately 16 h after the last stressor in CUS protocol, perform an 8-h sucrose preference test in the same way as described in point 7 but be aware of the additional critical points below.",
    "Critical: Perform procedures first on control mice and then on stressed mice. This is of particular importance, especially when the stressed mice were placed in the same room as the Wistar rats. It is important to change clothes and take a shower before recontact with the control mice (during switching or weighing bottles) due to possible odorant communication in mice (Arakawa et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Puścian et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This can also be done by another person participating in the CUS experiment.\nAfter completion of the SPT, subject the animals to the forced swim test (FST).\nKeep animals for 1 h in the room where FST will be performed.\nFill cylindrical glass containers (approximately 40 cm high, 20 cm in diameter) with warm water (25°C–27°C) to a depth of minimum 15 cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPlace each mouse in the water for 6 min for a single swim session. Record a video of each swimming session for offline analysis.\nWipe each mouse with a paper towel after the swimming session.\nWeigh each mouse when it is dry.\nOffline analysis of FST: manually assess recorded video for the total amount of time spent immobile during the last 4 min. We recommend noting all time points at which the mouse changes its activity.\nNote: In order to determine body weight gain or loss, weigh the mice after the CUS procedure. The changes in body weight measurements are the physiological parameter resulting from exposure to chronic stress. Avoid to measure weight before the FST performance because in particular for control mice is a stressor that might affect FST results.\nTroubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11] Inconsistent results between behavioral tests (SPT and FST)."
