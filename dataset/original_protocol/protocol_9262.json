    "Embryonic motoneurons can be obtained from mouse embryos at E12 to E14. 2-3% of the total cell population of the lumbar spinal cord consists of motoneurons and as the dorsal root ganglionic neurons are p75NTR-positive as well, it is important to get rid of these cells before starting the lectin-based preplating procedure (For overview see Figure 1 and Figure 2). Secondly, the meninges include strongly dividing cells that should be excluded as well, as they cannot be properly removed by the lectin-based preplating procedure (Figure 2 and Figure 3). In worse cases, these cells can overgrow the culture plates. The representative pictures in Figure 3B and 3D also give an impression about the lower cell density after washing procedures have been performed (see step 5.9 of the protocol). Cultures of embryonic mouse motoneurons are usually maintained for up to five or seven days. During this time period the cells establish their neurites up to a maximum length (Figure 4). Neurite lengths strongly depend on the substrate on the plates8. The typical substrate is laminin which is coated on PORN-H covered culture dishes. Motoneurons can also grow out on other or less defined substrates, like extracellular matrices generated by water lysis8. In cases of suboptimal coating, neurite length and growth cone area are decreased and cell death usually increases. Trophic support plays a crucial role for survival of embryonic mouse motoneurons in culture. Survival of initially plated cells on day seven drop to 10% to 20% without trophic support6. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) are the most commonly used factors but others can promote survival as well [Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)9].\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3200/3200fig1.jpg",

For the next step, the head and the tail are removed and the body is placed in a dorsal-up position B: Embryo in a dorsal-up position. Forceps at the left and right of the spinal cord are fixing the embryo body in its position. One of the forceps is subsequently used to cut the skin and to cut underneath the spinal cord the other is used to fix the embryo in its position. C: Isolated spinal cord from E12.5 mouse embryo. The parts of the spinal cord (cervical, thoracic, lumbar) are indicated. The spinal cord is surrounded by the meninges and part of the dorsal root ganglia still attach to them. D: The spinal cord is longitudinally cut on the dorsal side to open it towards the central canal. E: The meninges on the ventral side are now taken off from the flattened spinal cord. Note: While taken off, the lumbar part is marked by a small cut. F: Only the lumbar part of the spinal cord is then taken for further procedures.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3200/3200fig3.jpg",

A: The Islet-1/2 antibody labels motoneuron columns within the embryonic lumbar spinal cord (red, arrow) and Hoechst labels all nuclei within the section. Cross section of an E12.5 lumar spinal cord. E12.5 mouse embryos were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 h, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with sucrose according to standard procedures. Cryosections of 20 μm were taken with a cryostat and the sections were handled for immunhistochemical staining according to standard procedures11. The sections ware subsequently labeled with Hoechst for localization of the cell nuclei. Note that the dorsal root ganglionic neurons are Islet-1/2-positive as well and that the preparation procedure excludes this tissue parts from the isolation procedure. B: Islet-1/2 labeled (red, arrow) dissociated lumbar spinal cord cells from E12.5 embryos, left - before and right - after lectin-based preplating. The cells were counterstained with Hoechst to visualize all cell nuclei. C: Quantification of Islet-1/2-positive cells before and after lectin-based preplating. D: Nkx6.1 labeled motoneurons from E12.5 embryos after one day in culture. The cells were counterstained with Hoechst to cisualieze all nuclei. Note that 90% of all cells are Nkx6.1 positive.
