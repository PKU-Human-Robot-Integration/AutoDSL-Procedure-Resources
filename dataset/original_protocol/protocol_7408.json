    "Denaturing the protein samples Prepare 4× loading buffer.Mix the loading buffer (4×) and NuPAGETM LDS sample buffer (4×) in 1:1 volume.Apply the mix to the purified protein of mouse IRS1 (0.2–0.4 μg/μL) and IRS2 (0.2–0.5 μg/μL) (final 1×) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, at 95 °C for 10 min, and put on ice right after.Notes:  The mixture of loading buffer and NuPAGETM LDS sample buffer (final 1×) can be used as a negative control. During the heating process, pay close attention to prevent the sample from volatilizing due to the tubes’ caps opening. Before loading the sample, collect the water vapor on the cap by completing a short spin. Separating protein samples by electrophoresis Load the denatured IRS1 and IRS2 protein samples onto the NovexTM mini protein gel along with the protein ladder. Run at 80 V in the stacking gel and then turn to 120–150 V in the resolving gel, until your target protein migrates to the middle of the resolving gel.Notes:  Sample volume should not be >50 μL for a 1.5 mm 10-well gel. In our experiment, we load 5–10 μg of IRS1 (180 kD) protein and 5–12 μg of IRS2 (185 kD) protein. When the protein samples run into the resolving gel, transfer the electrophoresis tank into the refrigerator set at 4 °C. Based on the migration of the protein ladder, the position of the target protein in the gel can be estimated. Transferring the protein to the membrane Membrane preparation: pre wet the PVDF membrane first in methanol for 20 s, then place in ultrapure water for one quick rinse, followed by sitting in ultrapure water for 5 min, and finally in the wet transfer buffer (for at least 15 min).",
    "After electrophoresis is complete, wash the electrophoresis plates with pure water, place the gel over the blotting paper, carefully place the pre wet PVDF membrane onto the gel, place a second blotting paper onto the PVDF membrane, and place a sponge support pad.In this assay, we use wet transfer [100 V/gel, 2 h (for 1.5 mm gel), room temperature (RT)] or 10 mA/gel, overnight at 4 °C.Caution:  To open and remove gel(s) from the pre-cast gel cassettes, please refer to the “NuPAGE Technical Guide” at https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/EA0375PK2[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/EA0375PK2].Make sure that there are no air bubbles present in the transfer sandwich. Denaturing/renaturing of proteins on the membrane After the transfer is complete, take the membrane out of the sandwich and rinse with ultrapure water twice.Incubate the membrane in the denaturing and renaturing buffers (freshly prepared) from high to low concentrations of guanidine-HCl as shown in Table 1. Finally, incubate the membrane in the denaturing and renaturing buffer without guanidine-HCl overnight at 4 °C.Table 1.

Incubate the blot with the chemiluminescent substrate for 2 min. Remove the blot from the substrate and place it in the ChemiDoc XRS+ gel imaging system to get image.Caution: Use a sufficient volume to ensure that the blot is completely wet with the chemiluminescent substrate and does not become dry (0.1 mL/cm2)."
