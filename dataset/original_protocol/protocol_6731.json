    "The following procedure can be adapted for use with cells grown under a variety of c-di-GMP inducing conditions prior to FACS analysis. The methods described below were previously used in a study to examine heterogeneity in c-di-GMP production during surface sensing and early biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa (Armbruster et al., 2019).Prepare control and experimental bacterial strains for inoculation into the experimental condition (Figure 2)Streak P. aeruginosa reporter strains from a -80 °C glycerol freezer stock onto LB agar with 100 µg/ml of gentamicin. Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.Prepare an overnight liquid culture by resuspending a single colony into 3 ml LB broth with 100 µg/ml of gentamicin. Grow the liquid culture shaking, overnight, at 37 °C.Generate an inoculum of P. aeruginosa cells grown to mid-log in planktonic culture. Back dilute overnight, stationary phase cells 1:1000 in a final volume of 3 ml LB with 100 µg/ml gentamicin. Continue to incubate the back-diluted culture at 37 °C with shaking for 2 h. The purpose of generating a mid-log planktonic culture of cells is to start the experiment under conditions where c-di-GMP levels (and GFP fluorescence) should be lowest in the cells.After 2 h, begin checking the optical density of your culture at 600 nanometers (OD600) until cultures have reached mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3891/bioprotoc-11-02-3891-g002.jpgFigure 2. Graphical representation of Steps in Part A. Inocula of reporter and control strains are prepared to mid-logarithmic phase prior to inoculating into the experimental conditions in Part B.Grow reporter and control strains under c-di-GMP inducing experimental condition. Set up an additional culture growing to mid-log as a control for single cellsCentrifuge 3 ml of mid-log cells for 1 min at > 6,800 x g at room temperature (15-25 °C).",
    "Resuspend concentrated cells in a final volume of 1 ml LB with 100 µg/ml gentamicin, to achieve a final OD600 of 0.8.Incubate resuspended cells statically in a sterile, glass culture tube for 4 h at 37 °C. The glass culture tube acts as the substratum for P. aeruginosa to attach to and initiate c-di-GMP signaling over 4 h.Set up the single-cell control by further back diluting one of the strains from Step A4 to OD600 0.05 in LB and growing shaking at 37 °C for 4 h.Harvest surface-attached cells and fix with paraformaldehyde (PFA)Prepare the single-cell control sample from Step B4 by centrifuging 1 ml of mid-log cells for 1 min at > 6,800 x g at room temperature (15-25 °C). Rinse twice with PBS, then resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold 6% PFA. Store this control tube on wet ice.Use a 1 ml serological pipette to gently remove LB containing the planktonic fraction of each experimental culture from Step B3.Rinse the inside of the tube with 2 ml of ice cold PBS. Perform 3 rinses. Store tubes on wet ice between washes.Use a 1 ml serological pipette to transfer 1 ml of ice cold, 6% PFA into each tube. Use the pipette to scrape the sides of the tube and vortex thoroughly to resuspend surface-attached cells.Incubate resuspended samples on ice for 20 min for PFA fixation.Note: We used PFA to fix the bacterial cells instead of RNAlater because RNAlater is known to reduce the fluorescence intensity of GFP (Zaitoun et al., 2010). Within an hour of harvesting samples and immediately prior to FACS analysis, centrifuge to pellet PFA-fixed cells, wash once in ice cold PBS, and resuspend in 1 ml ice cold PBS. Temporarily store samples on wet ice until they are used for FACS.",
    "Analyze populations by flow cytometry and draw gates for sortingWe used a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer with a 70 µm nozzle to sort P. aeruginosa cells harboring the c-di-GMP reporter into high and low c-di-GMP populations for downstream qRT-PCR. The FACSAriaII was cleaned with 10% bleach followed by PBS for 90 min before and after all runs.Use the following controls to draw gates for high and low GFP levels (Figure 3):Single cell control: Wild type PAO1 cells grown planktonically to mid-log. Use this sample first to draw a gate around single cells, using forward and side scatter. This will allow you to avoid counting cell debris or large aggregates of cells as single events when sorting.GFP fluorescence controls: Use these to draw gates where you expect to see high and low GFP fluorescence from the PcdrA reporter (i.e., cells with high or low c-di-GMP levels, respectively).If using the regular half-life GFP reporter (pPcdrA::gfp):Constitutively high GFP controls:PAO1 ΔwspF ΔpelC ΔpslBCD pPcdrA::gfp PAO1 Tn7::P(A1/04/03)::GFPmutLow GFP control:PAO1 ΔwspR pPcdrA::gfp Constitutively “off” reporter controls:PAO1 pMH487Wild type PAO1If using the short half-life GFP reporter (pPcdrA::gfpASV):Constitutively high GFP control:PAO1 ΔwspF ΔpelC ΔpslBCD pPcdrA::gfpASV Low GFP control:PAO1 ΔwspR pPcdrA::gfpASV Constitutively “off” reporter control:PAO1 pMH489Wild type PAO1imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3891/bioprotoc-11-02-3891-g003.jpgFigure 3. Controls for setting up GFP gates for flow cytometry with the c-di-GMP reporter. Brackets indicate gates for ‘on’ (GFP above 1.7 × 102 RFU) or ‘off’ (GFP below 1.7 × 102 RFU) reporter cells and the number above the bracket indicates the percentage of cells that fall within that gate. (A) Wild type PAO1 cells were used to determine the background level of fluorescence on the BD Aria III for GFP measurements. This population of cells falls below 103 RFU. (B) A P.",
    "aeruginosa strain constitutively expressing stable GFP (PAO1 Tn7::P(A1/04/03)::GFPmut) was used to determine gating for cells with the highest amount of GFP, with the population ranging from 103 to 105 RFU. (C) Surface grown PAO1 ΔwspF Δpel Δpsl harboring the pPcdrA::gfpASV was used to validate the gate for collection of cells with high reporter activity (103 to 105 RFU; 91.6% of the population). (D) Example of gating for reporter ‘on’ cells from wild type PAO1 pPcdrA::gfpASV cells that had been attached to glass in LB medium for 4 h. Approximately 56.6% of the population falls into the reporter ‘on’ population. (E) Example of gating for ‘on’ cells from wild type PA14 pPcdrA::gfpASV cells that had been attached to glass in LB medium for 4 h prior to FACS sorting. Approximately 12.8% of the population falls into the reporter ‘on’ population. (F) Example of gating for ‘on’ cells from wild type PA14 pPcdrA::gfpASV cells that had been attached to glass in Jensen’s media (a condition in which Pel is more abundantly produced than in LB) for 4 h. Approximately 31.9% of the population falls into the reporter ‘on’ population. This figure was reproduced from Figure 1-figure supplement 5 in Armbruster et al. (2019).Sort cells directly into TRIzol LSPrepare tubes to sort cells into by adding 750 µl of Trizol LS for every 250 µl of volume that you plan to sort into that tube (i.e., sorted bacterial cells suspended in PBS sheath fluid). Pre-chill tubes with Trizol LS at 4 °C.Sort cells at 4 °C by flow assisted cell sorting (FACS) to collect 100,000 events (single cells) into TRIzol LS. Monitor the final volume to maintain a 3:1 ratio of Trizol LS to sorted cell volume and add additional Trizol LS as needed.",
    "After sorting is completed on each tube, vortex the samples for 10 s and store on wet ice.Extract RNA and test for gDNA contaminationExtract RNA immediately following FACS-sorting.Incubate samples for 4 min at 90 °C. Invert to mix.Transfer samples to ice.Add 200 µl of ice cold chloroform and shake vigorously.Centrifuge at 6,800 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Remove 500 µl of the colorless aqueous layer and transfer to a clean 2 ml tube.Add the following to the tube:1 µl glycogen40 µl of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.01,200 µl of 100% ethanolVortex to mix and store at -20 °C for 2 h or overnight.Centrifuge RNA samples for 30 min at 14,000 x g, 4 °C.Remove supernatant and wash RNA pellet with 800 µl 70% ethanol.Centrifuge for 30 min, remove the supernatant, and briefly air dry the pellet at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet in 20 µl RNase-free water.Heat at 65 °C for 5 min and vortex to fully resuspent the pellet.Proceed with RQ1 DNase I digestion.Digest any contaminating DNA present in the RNA samples with RQ1 DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s protocol.Check for genomic DNA contamination by PCR to detect the rplU gene. Include PAO1 genomic DNA as a positive control.Primers (amplifies a 307 bp product):rplU-F: 5’-CGCAGTGATTGTTACCGGTG-3’rplU-R: 5’-AGGCCTGAATGCCGGTGATC-3’Set up PCR reactions using your preferred Polymerase following manufacturer’s instructions (Table 1):Table 1.Example PCR recipe using Phusion polymerase imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210118/20210118215655_6086.jpg Program your thermocycler appropriately to allow for amplification of an approximately 300 bp amplicon with the polymerase you are using (Table 2).Table 2.

Include a DNA ladder and the positive control sample.",
    "Contaminated RNA samples will have a band around 300 bp in length, the same length as the positive control (PAO1 gDNA)’s amplicon. For any samples with gDNA contamination, repeat the treatment with Promega RQ1 DNase.Assess expression of target genes by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)The following steps describe how to measure expression of 2 target genes (pelA and pslA) and one control gene (ampR) by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Conditions will vary depending on the target genes, qPCR kit, and the thermalcycler used.Determine total RNA concentration and purity. Use a NanoDrop or other spectrophotometer to measure optical density of each RNA sample at 260 nm, 230 nm, and 280 nm. Dilute samples 1:50 in 100 µl H2O and repeat the measurement.To estimate concentration, an OD260 of 1 unit equals approximately 40 µg/ml RNA.A sufficiently pure RNA sample will have 260/280 and 260/230 ratios above 1.8.Prepare genomic DNA standards from 20ng to 0.02pg using PAO1 gDNA diluted in TE buffer.Set up qRT-PCR reactions using the manufacturer’s instructions. Use 2 or 3 µl of RNA per reaction, depending on the final concentration of RNA you measured above (add no more than 500 ng of RNA to each reaction).Control primers:ampR-F-qPCR: 5’-GCGCCATCCCTTCATCG-3’ampR-R-qPCR: 5’-GATGTCGACGCGGTTGTTG-3’Experimental primers:pslA-F-qPCR: 5’-AAGATCAAGAAACGCGTGGAAT-3’pslA-R-qPCR: 5’-TGTAGAGGTCGAACCACACCG-3’pelA-F-qPCR: 5’-CCTTCAGCCATCCGTTCTTCT-3’pelA-R-qPCR: 5’-TCGCGTACGAAGTCGACCTT-3’Record information regarding your qPCR run according to the Minimal Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) Guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009 and 2010)."
