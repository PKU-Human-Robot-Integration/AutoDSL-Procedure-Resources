    "This protocol is adapted and optimized from previously published methodologies to be an efficient method for the preparation of electrocompetent K. pneumoniae cells (Bachman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-bib-0001]). Competent cells are essential for genetic manipulation and transformation procedures (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0003]). Electrocompetent cells can take up foreign DNA through electroporation, allowing the introduction of plasmids, gene knockouts, or other genetic modifications. In brief, this protocol provides step-by-step instructions for the growth of K. pneumoniae to mid-exponential phase, preparation of competent cells, and storage of the electrocompetent cells. The resulting electrocompetent K. pneumoniae cells can be used in various molecular biology applications.\nMaterials\nFrozen glycerol stock of K. pneumoniae reference strains ATCC 43816 (KPPR1) or other strain(s) of interest\nLow-salt LB agar (see recipe)\nLow-salt LB broth (see recipe)\n0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8 (see recipe)\n1 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (see recipe), ice cold, sterile\nSterile ultrapure water, ice cold\n10% (v/v) glycerol, ice cold, sterile\nLiquid nitrogen\nStatic incubator (e.g., Thermo Scientific, Heratherm), 30°C\n17 × 100-mm aeration culture tubes (Genesee Scientific, cat. no. 21-131)\nShaking incubator (e.g., New Brunswick Innova 44), 37°C\n125-ml Erlenmeyer flask (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10-040D)\n1.7-ml disposable cuvettes (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14-955-127)\nSpectrophotometer (e.g., Thermo Fisher GENESYS 30)\nIce bucket with ice\n50-ml conical tubes (USA Scientific, cat. no. 5622-7261)\nRefrigerated centrifuge (e.g., Eppendorf centrifuge 5425R)\n1.7-ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes (Genesee Scientific, cat.

Streak K. pneumoniae strain KPPR1 from the −80°C glycerol stock onto a low-salt LB agar plate and incubate overnight at 30°C.\n2. Select a single colony of KPPR1 and inoculate into two culture tubes containing 3 ml of low-salt LB broth and 0.5 µM EDTA. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm).",
    "For other strains of interest requiring antibiotics for growth, add the appropriate antibiotics to the culture tubes.\n3. Prepare a sterile 125-ml flask for the next day by adding 50 ml low-salt LB broth and place it in the 37°C incubator overnight.\nPrewarming the low-salt LB broth expedites reaching mid-log phase compared to using room-temperature broth.\n4. Aseptically remove 1 ml from the flask of low-salt LB broth and pipet it into a cuvette to serve as a blank for step 6.\n5. Inoculate the sterile 125-ml flask containing 50 ml low-salt LB broth with 0.5 µM EDTA and antibiotics, if required. Swirl to mix, add 0.5 ml of the overnight culture, and place the flask in the 37°C incubator with shaking (200 rpm).\nThe addition of 0.5 µM EDTA improves K. pneumoniae pelleting.\n6. Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) by spectrophotometry starting at 2 hr and then at intervals of 0.5 to 1 hr until the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5-0.6. Bacterial growth can be measured by aseptically removing 1 ml of culture, pipetting it into a cuvette, and reading the absorbance at 600 nm.\nNote that the OD600 may quickly exceed 0.6 once it reaches ∼0.4, so measuring the OD600 of the culture every 20 min at that point is necessary.\nK. pneumoniae strain KPPR1 typically reaches an OD600 of 0.5-0.6 within 2-3 hr at 37°C.\nPreparation of electrocompetent cells\n7. Remove the flask from the incubator and place it on ice for a minimum of 30 min.\nPrechill a sterile 50-ml conical tube on ice alongside the culture to maintain cold conditions throughout the process and ensure efficient competent cells.\n8. Transfer the chilled culture to the sterile, cold 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C.",
    "9. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a total volume of 20 ml of ice-cold sterile 1 mM HEPES pH 7.4.\nBe cautious when decanting, as K. pneumoniae strains tend to form loose pellets (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-fig-0001]). Err on keeping some of the supernatant to avoid losing the pellet.\nAllow a 10- to 15-min incubation on ice at each step after decanting and adding solutions to enhance the efficiency of the competent cells.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/11604f49-2c38-4da5-8116-94d1053f16f2/cpz1912-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nAn image capturing the pelleting process of KPPR1 bacterial cells, illustrating the impact of the addition of 0.5 µM EDTA (left) compared to the absence of EDTA (right). The KPPR1 strain, which is hypermucoid, typically forms a loosely packed pellet. However, the inclusion of EDTA enhances the pelleting efficiency. The left image demonstrates the tighter pellet achieved with EDTA present, showcasing its ability to improve the pelleting process during the preparation of competent cells.\n10. Centrifuge the 50-ml conical tube(s) for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 20 ml of ice-cold sterile ultrapure water.\n11. Centrifuge the tube(s) for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 4 ml of ice-cold sterile 10% glycerol.\n12. Centrifuge the for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the liquid carefully and resuspend cells with ice-cold sterile 10% glycerol to a final volume of 0.5 ml, including any residual glycerol from the previous spin.\n13. At this point, the competent cells may be electroporated by proceeding to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0003], step 2, or may be saved for later use by following steps 14 and 15 below.\n14. Label and then aliquot 50- to 300-μl cell suspensions into sterile 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes kept on ice.",
    "Work swiftly during aliquoting to keep the cells cold.\n15. Flash-freeze the microcentrifuge tubes using liquid nitrogen and store the cells at −80°C.\nAlternatively, a dry ice/ethanol bath can be used for flash freezing. Add 95%-100% ethanol to a Styrofoam box, add dry ice until the temperature is below −70°C, and then add the tubes for flash freezing. Immediately store them in the −80°C freezer. Electrocompetent cells can remain stored at −80°C for ∼3-6 months for high efficiency transformations, but we have had electrocompetent cells work after 3 years.",
    "This protocol has been optimized from previously published methodologies and details the preparation of electrocompetent cells from KPPR1 containing pKD46-spr for efficient electroporation followed by λ Red recombineering (Bachman et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-bib-0001]; Datsenko & Wanner, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-bib-0005]). Unlike Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0001], the preparation of KPPR1 containing pKD46-spr involves a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and an arabinose-inducible promoter, essential for generating isogenic mutants using the λ Red recombination system. The procedure includes overnight culture growth, cell centrifugation, resuspension in HEPES buffer and glycerol, and final storage at −80°C. Following this method ensures that the electroporation efficiency is optimized for subsequent genetic manipulation studies.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0001])\nK. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 (KPPR1) containing pKD46-spr\nLow-salt LB agar plates (see recipe) with 50 µg/ml spectinomycin (see recipe)\n50 mg/ml spectinomycin (see recipe)\n50 mM L-arabinose, sterile filtered (see recipe)\nShaking incubator (e.g., USA Scientific, New Brunswick Innova 44), 30°C\n250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10-040F)\n250-ml Nalgene bottles, sterile (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 02-923-7), prechilled on ice\nCulture and growth conditions\n1. Streak K. pneumoniae strain KPPR1 containing pKD46-spr from the −80°C glycerol stock onto a low-salt LB-spectinomycin (50 µg/ml) agar plate and incubate overnight at 30°C.\nThe pKD46-spr plasmid has a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and must be grown at 30°C. If cells are grown at >30°C, the plasmid can be lost from the cells.\n2. Inoculate a single colony of KPPR1 containing pKD46-spr into two culture tubes each containing 3 ml of low-salt LB broth, 0.5 µM EDTA, and 50 µg/ml spectinomycin. Incubate the culture overnight at 30°C with continuous shaking (200 rpm).\nK. pneumoniae forms loose pellets and EDTA aids in pelleting to minimize loss when decanting (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-fig-0001]).",
    "3. Prepare two sterile 250-ml flasks with 125 ml low-salt LB broth for each flask and incubate at 37°C overnight.\n4. Aseptically remove 1 ml from both 250-ml flasks containing low-salt LB broth and pipet it into a cuvette to serve as a blank for step 6.\n5. Inoculate the sterile 250-ml flasks containing 125 ml of low-salt LB broth with 0.5 µM EDTA, spectinomycin (50 µg/ml), and 50 mM sterile-filtered L-arabinose. Swirl to mix, and then add 1 ml of the overnight culture and place the flask in the 30°C incubator with shaking (200 rpm).\n6. Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) starting 3 hr and then at intervals of 0.5-1 hr until the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5-0.6. Bacterial growth can be measured by aseptically removing 1 ml of culture, pipetting it into a cuvette, and reading the absorbance at 600 nm.\nFor the KPPR1 containing pKD46-spr to reach 0.5-0.6 typically takes ∼4 hr.\nPreparing and storing competent cells\n7. Place the culture on ice for a minimum of 30 min.\n8. Transfer the chilled culture to a prechilled sterile 250-ml Nalgene bottle and centrifuge 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C.\n9. Decant the supernatant and resuspend cells in a total volume of 100 ml of ice-cold sterile 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.4.\nBe cautious when decanting, as K. pneumoniae strains tend to form loose pellets.\nAllowing a 10- to 15-min incubation on ice at each step after decanting and resuspending the pellets will enhance the efficiency of the competent cells for electroporation.\n10. Centrifuge the 50-ml conical tube(s) for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a total volume of 100 ml of ice-cold sterile ultra-pure water.",
    "11. Centrifuge the tube(s) for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a total volume of 20 ml of ice-cold sterile 10% glycerol.\n12. Centrifuge the tube(s) for 15 min at 14,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the liquid carefully and resuspend cells with ice-cold sterile 10% glycerol to a final volume of 2 ml, including any residual glycerol from the previous spin.\n13. Aliquot 50-300 μl of cell suspensions into sterile 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes; keep on ice for immediate use or proceed to the next step for storage.\nWork swiftly during aliquoting to keep the cells cold.\n14. Flash-freeze the microcentrifuge tubes using liquid nitrogen or dry ice and ethanol and store the cells at −80°C for 3-6 months.",
    "This protocol describes a method for introducing DNA into competent K. pneumoniae cells using electroporation. Electroporation is a widely employed technique that enables the efficient and precise delivery of foreign DNA into bacterial cells. By utilizing this method, researchers can genetically manipulate K. pneumoniae for various applications, such as gene expression studies and the generation of recombinant strains. Briefly, plasmid DNA is added to competent K. pneumoniae cells, which are pulsed with an electroporator and allowed to recover at 30°C for 1-2 hr. The recovered cells are then plated on a low-salt LB-antibiotic plate and incubated overnight for the identification of colonies that have successfully taken up the plasmid. Throughout the procedure, stringent aseptic techniques are followed to prevent contamination. By following this protocol, researchers can achieve efficient and reliable transformation of K. pneumoniae using electroporation, facilitating various genetic studies and applications.\nMaterials\nElectrocompetent K. pneumoniae cells (KPPR1 or other strain of interest; Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0002])\n10% (v/v) glycerol, sterile\n1-5 μl (10 pg-100 ng) plasmid DNA (e.g., pACYC184)\nLow-salt LB broth (see recipe)\nLow-salt LB agar (see recipe) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics\n25-mm-diameter mixed cellulose esters (MCE) membrane (Millipore Sigma, cat. no.

Thaw three vials each containing 50 μl of electrocompetent cells from the −80°C freezer on ice for 5-10 min.\nIMPORTANT: From this step on, carry out all steps on ice to ensure efficient transformation. Alternatively, freshly made electrocompetent cells may be used immediately and usually have a higher transformation efficiency.",
    "2. Label 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes: a negative control tube (NC), a positive control tube (PC), and the tube receiving the plasmid DNA (PD).\n3. Add 100-200 ng of purified plasmid DNA suspended in sterile water to the 50 μl of competent K. pneumoniae cells, usually 5 μl. For the negative control (no DNA), add an equal volume of 10% glycerol and for the positive control, add 1 μl of a plasmid that has been established to transform efficiently (e.g., pCR2.1, pBAD18, or pACYC184) to one vial of competent cells.\nWhen adding the DNA to the electrocompetent cells, mix by gently flicking the tube. The DNA volume added should not exceed 10% of the volume of cells.\n4. Incubate the samples on ice for 30 min and place the 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes on ice.\nEach transformation requires one electroporation cuvette, so at least three cuvettes are typically needed (a positive control, a negative control, and the sample).\nThe best practice is to incubate the cells on ice for 30 min, but we've had success with as little as a 5-min incubation.\n5. Transfer the competent cells/DNA mixture to the 0.1-cm electroporation cuvette and electroporate at 1.8 kV, 400 Ω, 25 μF.\n6. Immediately add 500 μl low-salt LB broth to the 0.1-cm electroporation cuvette and then transfer the entire sample to the corresponding 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube labeled in step 2.\nRecovering and plating of transformed cells\n7. Place the tubes in the 30°C shaking incubator for 1-2 hr.\n8. Plate 100 μl and 10 μl of the sample onto low-salt LB agar plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics for selection purposes.\nLeave the remaining recovered cells on the benchtop overnight, and if transformation efficiency is low, plate the remaining cells again the next morning per step 9.",
    "9. Plate 200 μl of each of the positive and negative control onto two low-salt LB-2% agar plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.\nTo calculate the transformation efficiency, divide the number of colonies on the transformed plate by the amount of plasmid used (in µg) and then multiply by the final volume used to recover the competent cells divided by the volume of cells plated. For example, 35 colonies were counted on the transformed plate and 0.01 µg of plasmid was used for the transformation. The resuspended volume was 500 μl and 100 μl was plated, and therefore the transformation efficiency is 1.75 × 104 transformants/µg DNA.\n10. Incubate the plates overnight at 30°C.\n11. Remove the plates from the incubator. Cells transformed with the plasmid DNA will have colony-forming units (CFUs) on the LB-antibiotic plates, whereas the negative controls should not have any CFUs.",

Prepare a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel by dissolving 0.24 g agarose in 30 ml of 1× TAE buffer. Microwave on high until fully dissolved.\nTypical agarose concentrations range from 0.8% to 1.2%, with higher percentages enhancing the resolution of lower-molecular-weight bands and lower percentages providing better resolution for higher-molecular-weight bands.\n6. Add 1.2 μl GelRed into the slightly cooled 1% agarose gel. Pour the gel into a gel apparatus, add the gel combs, and allow it to fully polymerize.\nThe gel will be fully polymerized in ∼15 min.\n7. Pipet 5 μl of each PCR reaction and the DNA ladder into the polymerized 1% agarose gel. Run at 130 V for ∼25 min.\nAdjust the voltage to run the gel more slowly, if desired.

If the transformation plates from step 18 fail to yield colonies, plate the overnight samples on the following day. It has been observed that allowing cells to recover on the bench overnight can increase colony yield.",
    "The next day, if colonies appear, the transformation was successful, and then steps 19-23 are not necessary.\nRecovery and concentration of cells\n19. Examine the agar plates the next day. If no colonies appear on the agar plates, recover the remaining cells by centrifugation and remove the supernatant.

    "This protocol has been optimized from previously published methodologies and presents a comprehensive method for generating unmarked knockout mutants in K. pneumoniae using the pFLP-hyg plasmid (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-bib-0003]; Huang et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-bib-0008]). The pFLP-hyg plasmid harbors FLP recombinase, which facilitates the precise excision of the kanamycin selection marker flanked by FRT sites. However, for the FLP recombinase to work, the antibiotic cassette must contain the FRT sites. By employing the pFLP system, this protocol enables the removal of the antibiotic cassette introduced in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0004]. Note that the induction of the FLP recombinase and then subsequent curing of the pFLP plasmid are done at 42°C, whereas checking for hygromycin-sensitive patches is done at 30°C. Furthermore, safety considerations are crucial throughout the procedure. It is important to maintain sterility when handling bacterial cultures and follow dedicated safety protocols for high-voltage electroporation. The protocol includes the preparation of electrocompetent cells, transformation via electroporation, induction of FLP recombinase, multi-day screening for kanamycin and hygromycin sensitivity, and confirmation of clean knockout in the mutants via colony PCR and sequencing.

Check the low-salt LB-hygromycin agar plate for growth. If there is no growth, the pFLP-hyg plasmid has been lost; proceed to step 12. If there is growth, the pFLP-hyg plasmid remains; repeat step 11 until the strain becomes hygromycin sensitive.\n11. Patch the colony replicates daily onto a low-salt LB agar plate and a low-salt LB-hygromycin agar plate (100 µg/ml) to monitor for hygromycin sensitivity until the plasmid is lost (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-fig-0004]).\nLoss of the pFLP-hyg plasmid typically takes 4-10 days.

Carefully pipet up and down to ensure DNA recovery.\n11. Combine ∼5 μl of dialyzed DNA with 50 μl of electrocompetent TOP10 E. coli cells. Appropriate controls include 5 μl of glycerol only as a negative control and 1 μl of 1:10 miniprepped pACYC184 (empty vector) as a positive control.\nA negative control that shows growth indicates there was contamination, and the positive control indicates that the cells are efficient and competent.\n12. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min, and then perform electroporation using 0.1-cm-gap cuvettes with settings of 1.8 kV, 400 Ω, and 25 μF.\nThe incubation on ice is shorter for E. coli, at 10 min, than for K. pneumoniae, which shows increased transformation efficiency with 20-30 min of incubation with DNA.",
    "13. Recover the transformed cells by adding 500 μl of low-salt LB medium and then shaking at 30°C for 2-3 hr. Plate 20 μl and 200 μl of the controls, as well as pACYC184 with gene of interest, on separate low-salt LB-chloramphenicol (20 µg/ml) agar plates. Incubate at 30°C overnight.\nSave the excess transformed cells on the benchtop. If transformation yield is low, plate the remainder on low- salt LB-chloramphenicol (20 µg/ml) agar plates.\n14. Select four single colonies and patch them onto a low-salt LB-chloramphenicol (20 µg/ml) agar plate. Use the same four colonies to inoculate four culture tubes containing 3 ml of low-salt LB broth and chloramphenicol (20 µg/ml).\nPatching the colonies onto a plate allows strain preservation until the sequences are validated.\n15. Perform a miniprep on the pACYC184 complementation vector as described above. Elute in 35 μl of nuclease-free water and store the DNA at −20°C.\nRestriction digestion and validation of a complementation vector\n16. Prepare a restriction digest by combining 5 μl of the miniprepped plasmid, 1 μl of 10× rCutSmart Buffer, 0.5 μl of the appropriate restriction enzyme(s), and enough nuclease-free water to adjust the volume to 10 μl.\n17. Incubate the reaction mixture at the optimal temperature and time recommended for the specific restriction enzyme(s) being used.\nTypical restriction digest conditions are 37°C for 2 hr.\n18. Visualize the restriction-digested plasmid by following the steps outlined in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0004], steps 5-8. If the digested plasmid is cut as expected, send off the plasmid for sequencing.\n19. Perform the transformation of the pACYC184 complementation vector into electrocompetent KPPR1 cells with the corresponding mutant gene, following the steps outlined in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.912#cpz1912-prot-0003], steps 4-14. Store strains at −80°C as described in Basic Support Protocol 3, steps 24 and 25.",
    "To maintain the pACYC184 plasmid in K. pneumoniae and E. coli, add chloramphenicol at 80 µg/ml or 20 µg/ml, respectively.\n20. Validate the complementation vector with appropriate phenotypic assay(s) to assess effects of the gene of interest on the phenotype(s) of interest."
