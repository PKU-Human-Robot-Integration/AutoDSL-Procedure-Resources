    "All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines of Kindai University for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Preparation of Culture Media\nPrepare the modified KSOM (mKSOM) medium for embryo culture, consisting of 95 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.35 mM KH2PO4, 0.2 mM MgSO4 · 7H2O, 1.71 mM CaCl2 · 2H2O, 0.2 mM D(+)-Glucose, 0.2 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 1.0 mM L-Glutamine, 1.0 g/L Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 25.07 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM Sodium DL-Lactate, 0.05 g/L Penicillin, and 0.05 g/L Streptomycin in sterile water.\nPrepare the Hepes-buffered CZB (HCZB) medium for embryo manipulation, consisting of 81.5 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.7 mM CaCl2 · 2H2O, 1.18 mM MgSO4 · 7H2O, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 0.11 mM EDTA · 2Na, 36.1 mM Sodium DL-Lactate, 5.55 mM D(+)-Glucose, 0.025 g/mL Penicillin, 0.035 g/L Streptomycin, 0.014 mM Phenol Red, 1.0 g/L Polyvinyl alcohol, 5.0 mM NaHCO3, and 20.0 mM Hepes sodium salt in sterile water.\nPrepare the activation medium for oocyte activation: mKSOM medium supplemented with 50 nM TSA, 2 mM EGTA, 5 µg/mL cytochalasin B (CB), and 5 mM SrCl2.\n2. Preparation of Deionized Bovine Serum Albumin (dBSA)\nDissolve 1.2 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mL of sterile water at room temperature (a final concentration of 12%).\nAdd approximately 0.12 g of mixed ion-exchange resin beads to the above prepared 12% of BSA in sterile water at room temperature with gentle stirring.\nWhen the beads change color from blue-green to gold, recover the supernatant solution using a pipette. Then replace the beads with the fresh ones (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The replacement of beads is normally performed only once. It possibly requires a few replacements to complete deionization. Only as a guide, if the color of beads remains unchanged from blue-green to gold, it indicates that ion exchange is complete.",
    "Recover the solution after confirming that there is no color change in the beads.\n\tNOTE: If the recovered solution becomes cloudy, centrifuge it to prevent clogging the filter (175 x g, 5 min).\nSupplement the recovered the solution with 250 µL of 10.5% NaHCO3.\n\tNOTE: This process is intended for the dBSA solution to neutralize pH condition. However, NaHCO3 can be dispensable.\nSterilize the supernatant using a 0.45-µm filter, and store at -20 °C as dBSA stock solution.\n3. Oocyte Collection\nNOTE: All mice were maintained in light-controlled and air-conditioned rooms.\nSuper-ovulate each female B6D2F1 mouse (aged 8 - 10 weeks) by intraperitoneal injection of 7.5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 7.5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 48 h after the PMSG injection.\nPerform euthanasia by cervical dislocation 14 - 16 h after hCG injection. Incise the abdomen to access the reproductive tract using standard dissection techniques13. Briefly, pinch the skin and make a small lateral incision at the midline with scissors. Hold the skin firmly above and below the incision and pull the skin toward the head and tail. Cut the peritoneum using scissors, push the coils of the gut out of the way and confirm the presence of the two horns of the uterus, the oviducts, and the ovaries.\nExtirpate oviducts with small straight scissors and tweezers, place on a sheet of filter paper to wipe the blood off of the surface. Set the oviducts in mineral oil. Then, cut up the ampulla of the oviduct using dissection needles, and move the cumulus-oocyte complexes coming from the ampulla of the oviduct into 200 µL drops of HCZB medium with 0.1% hyaluronidase. Incubate for 5 min on a warming plate.",
    "Caution: An exposure of longer than 10 min in HCZB medium with 0.1% hyaluronidase would be detrimental for the oocytes.\nConfirm that the cumulus cells are released from the cumulus-oocyte complexes under a stereomicroscope, transfer second meiotic metaphase (MII) stage oocytes with some remaining cumulus cells to mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA. Then, wash the MII stage oocytes four times by pipetting up and down (using a pipette of <100 µm inner diameter) in mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA for detaching the remaining cumulus cells.\n\tNOTE: The use of a small pipette facilitates detachment of the cumulus cells.\nIncubate Mll stage oocytes in mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA at 37 °C under 5% CO2 incubator until enucleation.\n\tNOTE: A small pipette with a diameter that is slightly larger than that of the oocyte is recommended.\n4. Preparation of Donor Cells for Nuclear Transfer\nAfter steps 3.3 - 3.5, denuded oocytes are isolated from the cumulus-oocyte complexes. Transfer a small amount (approximately 2 µL) of the remaining cumulus cells dispersed from the cumulus-oocyte complexes in HCZB medium with 0.1% hyaluronidase to HCZB medium with 6% dBSA by using a pipette under a stereomicroscope.\nPlace the cumulus cells in HCZB medium with 6% dBSA on the warming plate at 37 °C until needed for SCNT.\n\tNOTE: When fibroblast cells (e.g., murine fetal fibroblast cells) are used as donor cells, detach the cells from a tissue culture dish and centrifuge them into a pellet. Resuspend the pellet of cells in HCZB medium containing 6% dBSA.\n5. Enucleation of Oocytes\nPrepare 9% PVP medium by adding 0.9 g PVP to 10 mL HCZB medium, keep in the refrigerator overnight (4 °C), and then sterilize it using a 0.45 µm filter.",
    "Prepare CB stock solutions (concentration of 1 mg/mL) by adding 5 mg of CB to 5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dilute the CB stock solution with HCZB medium (a final concentration of 5 µg/mL) and use as enucleation solution.\nWash the Mll stage oocytes in 20 µL of HCZB medium containing 5 µg/mL CB (enucleation solution) by inhaling and exhaling through the sterilized pipette (inside diameter: 150 µm to 200 µm). Repeat the washing procedure five times. Wait approximately 10 min on the warming plate in enucleation solution before starting the enucleation process.\nPrepare the enucleation chamber as shown in Figure 2A. Transfer the Mll oocytes to the enucleation chamber by inhaling and exhaling using the pipette (inside diameter: 150 µm to 200 µm); place 4 µL of enucleation solution and cover the chamber with mineral oil.\n\tNOTE: Instead of a chamber, a cover of a 60 mm Petri dish can be used.\nIdentify the spindles and chromosomes of the MII stage oocyte under a microscope (400X) at room temperature. Orient the Mll stage oocyte with the pronounced first polar body, so that the positioning of the spindle and chromosome is at the 3 or 9 o'clock (Figure 2B) position using a holding pipette and micropipette.\n\tNOTE: The microscope used has lenses of 400X magnification in total. Also, the objective lens N.A is 5X/0.12 and 40X/0.55. The piezo pulse driving of the pipette permits rapid drilling of the zona pellucida. In addition, a laser system (e.g., XYClone) is also usable for the drilling of the zona pellucida in place of the piezo driving system.",
    "Set the piezo pulse intensity to 3 - 6, and drill to the zona pellucida using a micromanipulation pipette (7 - 8 µm inner diameter flat-ended tip) with the piezo pulse driving. After opening a hole in zona pellucida, completely enucleate the spindles and chromosomes with a minimal amount of cytoplasm (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: During this process, oocytes tend to tightly attach to the dish bottom or pipette due to the medium without BSA14. Within 10 min, the enucleation process must be completed, and the enucleated oocytes need to be returned to the incubator. The appropriate number of oocytes that can be manipulated in one enucleation is between 10 and 20. For larger batches of oocytes, the enucleation procedure is repeated.\nConfirm the absence of chromosomes in cytoplasm under visible light (Figure 2C, middle), then wash the enucleated oocytes thoroughly in mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA lacking CB. Introduce the dish to the incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 until cell fusion.\n\tNOTE: After enucleation, the cytoplasm removed from ooplasm contains the spindles and chromosomes.\n6. Fusion of a Donor Cell and an Enucleated Oocyte\nPreparation of HVJ-E\nAdd 260 µL of ice-cold HVJ-E suspension solution to lyophilized HVJ-E (from the kit, see the Table of Materials) and pipette up and down until fully suspended.\n\t\tNOTE: The appropriate amount of lyophilized HVJ-E is prepared in a bottle, and 260 µL HVJ-E suspension solution is included in the kit.\nPrepare 5 µL aliquots of the HVJ-E solution, and then store at -80 °C until cell fusion.\n\t\tCaution: Carefully treat the HVJ-E on ice, since it is temperature-sensitive. After completion of the experiment, appropriately autoclave HVJ-E materials and containers to completely inactivate virus components.\nCell Fusion",
    "Dilute the 5 µL of HVJ-E solution with 20 µL of the cell fusion buffer immediately before use. Place the diluted HVJ-E solution on ice until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell fusion buffer is included in the HVJ-E kit.\nPrepare the cell fusion chamber as shown in Figure 3A. Transfer the enucleated oocytes to HCZB medium on the cell fusion chamber using the pipette (inside diameter: 150 µm to 200 µm); place 4 µL of each solution (HCZB medium containing 6% -BSA for donor cells, HVJ-E solution,HCZB medium,9% PVP in HCZB medium) and cover the chamber with approximately 1 mL of mineral oil.\n\t\tNOTE: The appropriate number of enucleated oocytes that are transferred to the chamber for manipulation during one cell fusion procedure is from 5 to 30. For larger batches of oocytes, the cell fusion procedure is repeated. Instead of chamber, a 60-mm Petri dish cover can be used, if available.\nPlace the enucleated oocytes in HCZB medium under a microscope at 400X magnificationat room temperature. Aspirate the donor cells using the micromanipulation pipette (6-7 µm inner diameter flat-ended tip), and expel cells into HVJ-E suspension solution.\nThen aspirate cumulus cells one by one with the HVJ-E suspension solution to be equally separated from each other, enabling serial cell fusion. Keep the enucleated oocytes in HCZB medium using a holding pipette. Drill the zona pellucida with the micromanipulation pipette with the piezo pulse (Intensity of 3 - 6, Speed of 2 - 3).\nAfter opening the hole in the zona pellucida, place a cumulus cell tightly to the oocyte membrane, along with HVJ-E suspension solution with a volume 5 times the volume of a cumulus cell, without going through the oocyte membrane.",
    "NOTE: Prepare 6 - 7 µm inner diameter flat-ended tips of micromanipulation pipettes for cumulus cells. Pipettes must be washed regularly using 9% PVP medium for maintaining smooth cell release. Steps 6.2.3 - 6.2.5 must be finished within 10 min, or the efficiency of cell fusion will be lower. Membrane fusion activity of HVJ-E is inactivated by autoclaving, treatment with detergent, or 70% ethanol. After the experiment, the HVJ-E solution must be appropriately disposed of.\nAfter manipulation of cell fusion, promptly transfer the oocytes to mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA, and move to an incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 1 h.\n7. Activation of the Reconstructed Oocytes and Treatment with Trichostatin A and Vitamin C\nPreparation of TSA\nDispense 5 mM TSA solution into 3 µL aliquots, and store the solution at -20 °C.\nAdd 2.5 µL of 5 mM TSA stock solution to 1 mL of DMSO (a concentration of 12.5 µM).\nDilute 8 µL of 12.5 µM TSA stock solution in 2 mL of the activation medium and mKSOM medium (a final concentration of 50 nM).\nPreparation of VC\nAdd 1 mg of VC into 1 mL of sterile endotoxin-free water, and store at -20 °C.\nAdd the VC stock solution to mKSOM medium (a final concentration of 10 µg/mL).\nActivation of the Reconstructed Oocytes\nOne hour after cell fusion, check the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) in the reconstructed oocytes (Figure 3B) using a microscope (400X).\nTransfer the reconstructed oocytes to the activation medium (see the step 1.3) containing TSA, and incubate for 6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air (Figure 3C). Observe the formation of pro-nuclei in the SCNT embryos, then apply 2 more hours of TSA treatment in mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA (Figure 2C).",
    "Transfer the TSA-treated embryos to mKSOM medium supplemented with VC and incubate for 7 h, as shown in Figure 3D.\nAfter 7 h of the VC treatment, transfer the VC-treated embryos to mKSOM medium containing 0.3% dBSA, and incubate for 4 days at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air.\n\tNOTE: To produce cloned mice, transfer morphologically normal 2-cell stage embryos into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant female mice (MCH(ICR)) on the day when a vaginal plug is found (Day 0.5 of pseudopregnancy)15. After 19.5 days, the number of implantation sites and newborns are recorded after cesarean section."
