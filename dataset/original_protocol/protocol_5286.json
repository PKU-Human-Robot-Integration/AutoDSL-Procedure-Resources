    "Note: All experimental procedures followed the guidelines by the National Institute of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine. 3-6 month-old male Long Evans rats, weighted between 450 g to 550 g, are housed 2-3 per cage and handled daily for ~7 days.After the acclimation period, demonstrator rats are food restricted to 85-90% of their baseline body weight before experiment. In the meantime, they are trained to run the linear track back and forth for milk reward for at least one week. Training session takes place once a day and lasted about 20 min. An adult rat can achieve satisfactory behavioral performance (continuous run back and forth without prolonged pause) within 2-3 days.While demonstrator rats are being trained, non-trained naïve rats are implanted with hyperdrive that contains 15 independently movable tetrodes and one reference electrode. Tetrodes target the right dorsal hippocampal CA1 region (coordinates: anteroposterior -3.8 mm, mediolateral 2.4 mm relative to bregma). During surgery, all tetrodes are placed right above the surface of exposed brain tissue without touching it. Then tetrodes are advanced individually to reach dorsal CA1 area. Since the dorsal CA1 area is not flat, the final depths vary among individual tetrodes, but approximately 2 mm below the dura. The reference tetrode is placed in white matter above dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell layer, approximately 1.7 mm below the dura.After having fully recovered from surgery (typically within 3 days), the implanted rats are food deprived to 85-90% of their baseline weight. During the following 3-4 weeks after implantation, tetrodes are slowly advanced to the CA1 pyramidal layer until sharp-wave ripples signal were observed (Figure 2). The reference tetrode is placed in the white matter above the CA1. Recordings are not conducted within 24 h after tetrodes movement.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170625/20170625235357_0853.",
    "jpgFigure 2. A representative LFP sharp-wave ripplePre-recording training phase: Each rat is placed in the observation box for 2 or 3 days, 15-30 min each day. For a group of implanted rats, there is a well-trained demonstrator running on the track in this pre-recording phase. For the other group of implanted rats, the track is left empty without a demonstrator.Recording procedure: The recording starts and lasts for 6-12 consecutive days after pre-recording training. The recording procedure is depicted in Figure 3. A typical recording took ~2 h. Each recording consists of three sessions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170625/20170625235443_6718.jpgFigure 3. Schematic of daily recording procedure. The Pre- and Post-box sessions were configured with various conditions.For the group of rats that have watched a well-trained demonstrator in the pre-recording training phase, on the first recording day:The implanted rats first stay in the observation box while a well-trained demonstrator is running the linear track for 15 min (Pre-box session).Then the implanted rat runs the linear track for the first time (Track session).Then the implanted rat stays in the observation box again while the well-trained demonstrator is running the track (Post-box session).Note: The recorded rats have never been exposed to the track before the first recording day.In each of the following days, the Pre-box and Post-box session is set up in various ways as the following, while the Track session remains the same. Each condition is recorded for 1-3 days.Empty-track: removing the demonstrator from the track.No-track: removing both the track and demonstrator.Naïve-demo: replacing the demonstrator with a naïve demonstrator that have never been exposed to the track.Toy-car: replacing the demonstrator with a toy car remotely controlled by the experimenter behind the curtain. The car is maneuvered to move at a speed comparable to a rat’s.",
    "The toy car stops when it reaches the end of the track then reverses its direction.Blocked-view: implanted rats stay in the box but with the view blocked while a well-trained demonstrator is running on the track. In this condition, the observation box is rotated 180° such that the opening side now is facing a nearby wall of the room 20 cm away. The implanted rat in the box can not see either the track or the demonstrator, but has access to the auditory and olfactory information associated with the demonstrator.For the other group of rats that have seen only the empty track in the pre-recording training, the Pre-box and Post-box sessions on the first day are under Empty-track condition. In the following days, the Pre-box and Post-box sessions are replaced by Trained-demo and other conditions as described above."
