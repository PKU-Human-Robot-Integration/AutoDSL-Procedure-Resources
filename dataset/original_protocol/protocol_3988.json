    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal housing and ethics statements\nAll mice were housed in individually ventilated cages maintained at 22°C–26°C, 30%–70% relative humidity, and a 12 h light-dark cycle. Sterilized corncob was used as bedding, with sterilized toilet rolls, tissues, and parts of cardboard boxes being provided as environmental enrichment. All mice used were within the age range of 8–12 weeks. For breast cancer studies, only female mice were used, while mice from both sexes were used for imaging melanoma tumors. All experimental techniques, methodology, and experiments were approved by the relevant ethics committee.\nMonitoring mice under anesthesia\nPost-administration of anesthetics, the mice need to be monitored throughout the duration of imaging. For this purpose, physiological monitoring using PhysioSuite (Kent Scientific Corporation) can be used. Alternatively, the depth of anesthesia can also be monitored by checking for hind limb and palpebral reflex. For testing the palpebral reflex, a sterile cotton tip is used to gently touch the periocular skin to generate a reflex. The absence of reflex indicates deep anesthesia. Similarly, the hind limb can also be gently pinched; if no reflex (hindlimb jerk or withdrawal) is observed, the mouse is under anesthesia.\nDuring the anesthetic period, special attention should be paid to the breathing of the mouse, which should neither be too fast nor labored. Breathing under anesthesia should be deep, rhythmic, and distress-free. Moreover, the testing for palpebral and hindlimb reflexes should not affect the breathing rate. Wherever possible, we suggest that researchers utilize the help of more experienced researchers or veterinary staff to ensure that proper monitoring of anesthesia is being performed and the mice are not in any kind of distress.\nPreparation prior to surgery for intravital imaging\nTiming: 15 min",
    "The below-detailed steps allow the researchers to prepare mice for cannulation, surgery, and imaging.\nAssess the tumor-bearing mouse for any visible signs of distress.\nAnesthetize the mouse according to its body weight.\nWe administer injectable anesthesia, ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) combined dose to provide deep surgical-plane anesthesia.\nAdminister repeated half doses upon monitoring during imaging session to enable extended periods of anesthesia. See detailed above.\nOnce the mouse is completely under anesthesia (as assessed via palpebral reflex and hindlimb withdrawal), carefully remove the abdominal hair using an electric shaver. We remove 80%–90% of hair by shaving until very little hair remains around the poorly accessible regions such as the hindlimbs.\nCritical: While using the electric shaver, take care to avoid damaging the skin overlying the tumor to avoid any accidental incision or injury. The shape of the underlying tumor may necessitate multiple attempts to remove the hair.\nPost-shaving, apply a depilatory cream such as Nair (Church and Dwight) or Veet (Reckitt Benckiser) to the whole abdomen to remove the remaining hair.\nAfter about 1–2 min (depending on the depilatory cream), clean the hair removal cream with a wet tissue. Thoroughly clean the skin and tap-dry with dry tissues. We recommend using soft tissues so as to not cause any abrasions on the skin. Lastly, swab the tissue with moist, lint-free paper. This step prevents the transfer of auto-fluorescent hair to the tumor region during surgical preparation.\nPost-depilation, quickly place the mouse on its back on a thermal heating pad to maintain its core body temperature.\nNext, proceed with cannulation as described below. If no cannulation is required, please proceed directly to the section on surgical preparation for intravital imaging[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.4].",
    "Critical: Do not leave the hair removal creams in contact with the skin for too long as this may irritate and inflame the skin. These steps should be carried out as quickly as possible to minimize the reduction in core body temperature. Alternatively, perform the procedure on a temperature-regulated heat pad or 24 h prior to surgery.\nCannulation\nEmploy this procedure when repeat injections need to be performed to administer drugs, dyes, or cells. If cannulation is not required, proceed to the surgical preparation for intravital imaging.\nFor cannulation, we use tail vein, jugular vein, or carotid artery cannulation, depending on the experimental requirements. Both tail vein and jugular vein cannulations transfer the administered agents into the venous circulation and can be used in most scenarios. Carotid artery cannulation is useful for administering cells into the aorta, a methodology utilized when the pulmonary vascular bed needs to be bypassed to avoid sequestration of the adoptively transferred cells in the lungs immediately after administration. As cells are injected into the aorta, they pass through organs (including the tumor mass) before entering the pulmonary vascular bed.\nTail vein cannulation\nTiming: 10 min\nThis procedure can be performed by a researcher with routine mouse-handling experience. It is the method of choice for administering dyes and drugs.\nUsing an artery/toothed-forceps, move the needle of an insulin syringe side-to-side till it breaks from the syringe.\nInsert the broken/blunt end of the needle into PE10 tubing to create a cannula.\nInsert a needle connected to a 3-way stopcock on the other end of the PE10 tubing for administering drugs, dyes, or cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Commercially available intravenous cannula can also be used for this purpose.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/952-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cannulation of blood vessels\n(A) Illustration of the methodology used to generate the tail vein cannula.",
    "(B) Schematic representation highlighting the methodology for cannulation of tail vein, adapted from The Laboratory Mouse (Shimizu, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51]).\nAnesthetize the mouse (if not previously anesthetized).\nDisinfect the tail by swabbing with 70% w/v ethanol before placing it on its side.\nWarm the tail under a heat lamp for 1–2 min. Lateral veins are the best for cannulation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Panel 1).\nNote: Care should be taken while heating the tail of the mouse. Radiant heat should be applied as per the best working practices within the facility. Wherever possible, the mouse should be covered with paper towels (Teri Wipers, Halyard[href=https://store.independenceaustralia.com/halyard-teri-wiper-small-100-wipes-small-24230101?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6tmRzvC-8QIViQVyCh2k_QRtEAQYASABEgK_7PD_BwE]), and only the tail should be exposed to the radiant heat directly. This methodology prevents damage to sensitive tissues such as the eyes and ears. After 1–2 min, researchers can clearly observe the lateral veins within the tail.\nOnce the blood vessel appears to be dilated (increased diameter and redness), perform the following steps:\nLift the tail firmly, reorient and position the needle of the cannula on top of the distal end of the tail parallel to the vessel.\nGently tilt the needle to an angle of 10°–15° and insert the bevel (facing up) into the blood vessel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Panel 2).\nDraw the syringe attached to the cannula to see if blood enters the tubing. If yes, then the needle is placed correctly; if not, then repeat the process carefully in another region of the tail.\nNote: Hold the needle attached to the cannula with artery/toothed forceps using the dominant hand.\nImmobilize the needle and tubing on the tail using surgical tape. Flush 50–100 μL of saline to prevent blood coagulation within the needle.\nIf required, inject drugs and cells now via the cannula using the 3-way stopcock.",
    "Take care so that no more than 10% of the blood volume (approximately 100 μL) is injected at any given time. We usually wait 30–40 min between any two intravenous administrations to avoid fluid overload.\nNote: In all of our cannulation procedures, we prefer to use a 3-way stopcock to allow for the availability of multiple injection ports for simultaneous injection of dyes and cells. Additionally, this methodology provides surrogate ports in case a port is blocked.\nJugular vein cannulation\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis procedure requires expertise and is best suited for researchers with experience in small animal surgery. It is most useful for injecting large number of cells in a relatively small volume (to avoid fluid overload/hypervolemia). It is best used for the adoptive transfer of immune cell populations such as neutrophils, monocytes, and effector T cells.\nRemove hair from approximately 1–2 cm region of skin on the ventral side of the neck using depilatory creams. Perform all the subsequent steps under a surgical microscope.\nMake a superficial skin incision (approximately 1 cm) using a pair of fine-tipped surgical scissors right of the midline of the neck (left to the trachea).\nGently tease the skin apart to highlight the underlying tissue (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/952-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cannulation of blood vessels\n(A) Schematic representation depicting the stepwise methodology used for cannulating jugular vein.\n(B) Illustration depicting the stepwise methodology used for cannulating carotid artery.\nUsing fine forceps, gently tease the underlying fascia and the surrounding tissue whilst avoiding injury. At this point, the jugular vein becomes visible as a large blood vessel, and care should be taken to avoid any injury.\nImmobilize the skin tissue using a surgical suture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 1).",
    "Tape the other end of the suture onto the heating pad or the metal base plate of the imaging stage.\nCritical: It is crucial at this stage to make sure that the fascia is well separated to provide access to the jugular vein, but precaution should be taken to avoid any injury to the fascia and the surrounding tissue which have deep-seated veins and may lead to bleeding.\nGently tease the tissue between the common carotid artery, vagus nerve, and jugular vein.\nUsing ultrafine forceps (preferably Dumont #7 forceps), separate the jugular vein and the vagus nerve from the underlying tissue.\nGently lift the vein using forceps. At this point, no underlying tissue should be displaced, indicating a proper surgical preparation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 2).\nCritical: It is crucial that the vagus nerve and the carotid artery are well separated to avoid any nerve damage when the vein is ligated, but it should be done with utmost care to avoid any injury to the vein, which could lead to extensive bleeding.\nLigate the anterior region of the vein using the instrument tie methodology[href=https://www.animatedknots.com/surgical-tie-knot-instrument-technique] (with two opposing throws) using a surgical silk suture (Dynek Dysilk 4/0 suture) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 3, Ligation 1).\nClamp the distal end using a microvascular clamp attached to the S&T clamp applying forceps (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 3). Leave a single suture untied at the distal end.\nCritical: To ligate the vein, cut appropriately sized sutures (approximately 10 cm in length) and pass under the vein which has been gently lifted by inserting forceps underneath (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 3). Take care to avoid excessive abrasion with the sutures or forceps to prevent any tear or bleeding.",
    "Using a pair of Vannas scissors, make a small incision on the vein. A small amount of blood retained in the lumen of the clamped vein will leak from the incision site (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 4).\nCritical: To make a precise incision on the vein, we recommend lifting the vein from the top using Dumont#7 forceps, positioning the Vannas scissors 30° to 45° to the forceps so that just a small part of the vein comes in contact with the scissors. Make a single, sharp cut to avoid excessive damage to the vein.\nInsert a cannula (without the needle) (PE10®, BD) connected to a 3-way stopcock containing saline into the vein via the incision (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 5).\nImmobilize the cannula in the vein by ligating with a surgical suture employing instrument tie methodology with two opposing throws (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 6, Ligation 2).\nIf needed, use a second suture at the distal end of the blood vessel to stabilize the cannula further (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 6, Ligation 3) Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: This part of the procedure requires gentle manipulations and dexterity. The tip of the cannula should be cut with a scalpel blade to provide a sharp 45° bevel. Before inserting the cannula, confirm that the cannula or the connecting stopcock has no air entrapped and the stopcock is in a locked position.\nRemove the microvascular clamp using the S&T clamp forceps.\nTrim the excess suture thread.\nPlacing the skin flap on the underlying tissue, seal the incision site using surgical glue.\nThe researchers can also attach the cannula onto the skin surface using surgical glue followed by an adhesive bandage. These additional steps prevent the accidental removal of cannula either during the surgical preparation of the tumor or during the transfer of the stage to the microscope.",
    "Flush 50–100 μL of saline to prevent blood coagulation within the cannula.\nInject drugs and cells as required via the cannula using the 3-way stopcock, taking care that no more than 10% of the blood volume is injected at any given time to avoid any changes in the hemodynamic parameters (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, step 7).\nNote: We usually lightly tape the syringe, 3-way stopcock, and the tubing to the stage or heat pad so as to prevent any accidental damage, bending, or removal. This further helps during the surgical preparation of the tumor as the tubing is securely placed away from the surgical setup (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/952-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Surgical preparation of tumors for intravital imaging\nSchematic representation of the methodology used to surgically prepare the tumors in mice for intravital imaging. The secure placement of cannula and tubing is also been depicted.\nPause point: Take brief pauses (<30 sec) between steps 10 to 17 to prepare for the upcoming step, change surgical instruments, and check ligations or cannula.\nCarotid artery cannulation\nTiming: 30–45 min\nThis procedure is best suited for researchers with extensive experience in small animal surgery. It is very useful for injecting large number of cells in experiments wherein the pulmonary vascular bed needs to be bypassed to avoid sequestration of cells immediately post-transfer.\nPerform steps 10 and 11 as described for jugular vein cannulation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 1).\nGently tease the tissue between the trachea and the jugular vein to reveal the presence of the common carotid artery which is easily detected by rhythmic pulsation and the vagus nerve which runs parallel to the common carotid artery.\nUsing ultrafine forceps (preferably Dumont #7 forceps), separate the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. Isolate the carotid artery from the underlying tissue.",
    "Gently lift the artery using the forceps. At this point, no underlying tissue should be displaced, thus indicating a good surgical preparation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 2).\nCritical: It is crucial that the vagus nerve and carotid artery are well separated to avoid any nerve damage when the artery is ligated, but it should be done with utmost care to avoid any injury to the artery, which would lead to excessive bleeding.\nLigate the anterior region of the common carotid artery prior to the partition into internal and external carotid arteries using the instrument tie methodology (with two opposing throws) employing a silk surgical suture (Dynek Dysilk 4/0 suture) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 3, Ligation 1).\nClamp the distal end using microvascular clamps attached to the S&T clamp applying forceps.\nCritical: To ligate the artery, cut appropriately sized sutures (approximately 10 cm in length) and pass under the artery which has been gently lifted by inserting forceps underneath. Care should be taken to avoid excessive abrasion with the sutures or forceps that may lead to bleeding.\nUsing Vannas scissors, make a small incision in the carotid artery. Small amounts of blood retained in the lumen of the clamped artery will leak from the incision site, and the artery will collapse (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 4). Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nCritical: To make a precise incision on the artery, we recommend lifting the artery from the top using Dumont#7 forceps, positioning the Vannas scissors 45° to the forceps so that just a small part of the artery comes in contact with the scissors. Make a single, sharp cut to avoid excessive damage to the artery.\nInsert a cannula (without the needle) (PE10®, BD) connected to a 3-way stopcock containing saline into the artery via the incision (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 5).",
    "Immobilize the cannula in the artery by ligation with a surgical suture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 6, Ligation 2).\nIf required, use a second suture at the distal end of the blood vessel to stabilize the cannula further (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, step 6, Ligation 3).Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nCritical: This part of the procedure requires gentle manipulation and dexterity. We advise pulling the cannula tube at the tip to make it as thin as possible without generating any kinks in the cannula. The tip of the cannula should then be cut with a scalpel blade to provide a sharp 30° to 45° bevel. Before inserting the cannula, confirm that the cannula or the connecting stopcock has no air entrapped and the stopcock is in a locked position.\nRemove the microvascular clamp using the S&T clamp forceps.\nTrim the excess suture thread.\nPlacing the skin flap on the underlying tissue, seal the incision site using a surgical glue.\nThe researchers can also attach the cannula onto the skin surface using surgical glue followed by an adhesive bandage.

This further helps during the tumor surgery as the tubing is securely placed away from the surgical setup (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).",
    "Pause point: Take brief pauses (<30 sec) between steps 18–24 to prepare for the upcoming step, change surgical instruments, and check the ligations or cannula.\nSurgical preparation for intravital imaging\nTiming: 30 min\nThis procedure requires expertise and is best suited for researchers with experience in small animal surgery. These steps allow for access to the underlying mammary or melanoma tumor for intravital imaging.\nPlace the mouse on its back (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 2), on the thermal-controlled surgical board. Gently restrain the limbs using surgical tape to avoid excessive movement during surgery.\nInsert a rectal probe into the mouse to continuously monitor the core body temperature using a thermal regulator set at maintaining the core body temperature at 37°C (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 2).\nMake a lateral incision from the lower abdomen to the neck area. Exercise appropriate caution so as to not puncture the peritoneum (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 3).\nUsing blunt dissection, lift the skin from the underlying peritoneal wall (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 3).\nMake angled incisions pointing towards the limbs (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 4).\nGently pull the skin back. Using blunt dissection, separate the skin from the underlying peritoneal wall to create a skin flap, thus exposing the tumor.\nCritical: The tumor is vascularized by newly formed angiogenic blood vessels originating from both cranial and caudal superficial epigastric artery and vein. Take utmost care to avoid injury to these blood vessels.\nRemove the fascia connecting the skin to the peritoneal wall very carefully and with a lot of precision using the curved edge of the Dumont #7 forceps and a pair of surgical scissors if required (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 4).",
    "Gently stretch the ends of the skin flap and immobilize them by suturing (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5). Cut the ends of the suture and hold in place by surgical tape. It is crucial to use good quality surgical tape to ensure the stability of the skin flap (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5).\nFurthermore, remove any non-vascularized fascia, connective or adipose tissue from the surface of the tumor to improve the quality of imaging.\nCritical: If the fascia connecting the skin flap to the peritoneal wall is not adequately removed, these connections may result in lateral movement observed during tumor imaging caused due to breathing, with the inhalation and exhalation of the breath changing the tension within the skin flap.\nCritical: Remove any residual fat (for mammary tumor) or fascia (for melanoma) from the tumor surface as this may hamper the imaging. Gently lift the non-vascularized fascia or adipose tissue and cut from the underlying tumor. The presence of excess fascia, connective tissue, or mammary fat is occasionally observed, especially in smaller tumors wherein the surrounding tissue has not yet been replaced by the tumor mass.\nOnce the tumor has been surgically prepared, apply hydrophobic ointment (such as vacuum grease) to the base of an appropriately sized stage insert and gently place it onto the stage to generate a watertight seal.\nSuperfuse the tumor with saline solution at 37°C.\nPlace a coverslip on top of the stage insert. Alternatively, image the tumor in the superfused chamber using a water-dipping objective. Troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]\nCover the exposed tissue with a sterile cotton-gauze sheet. Keep the tissue warm and perfused with saline at 37°C.\nTo prevent the drying of the animal’s eyes during the imaging session, apply a lubricating ophthalmic ointment before imaging is commenced.",
    "Remove or relax the temporary restraint on the limbs to allow for a normal posture.\nScan the large exposed tumor to find a suitable region for imaging.\nWhile the tumor is being imaged, inject vascular dyes, drugs, or cells to study the real-time dynamics of immune cells in vivo.\nClean the microscope stage by wiping it down with 70% ethanol.\nNote: All steps should be carried out using sterile surgical instruments. Sterile, surgical-grade cotton-gauze should be used in this procedure. Consider administration of analgesics during the surgical procedure as per the institutional ethics protocols and experimental design.\nIntravital imaging\nTiming: 1–5 h\nFor operating the intravital microscope, please follow the specific guidelines of the manufacturer. We suggest turning the microscope on, including all the laser components, and detectors to allow sufficient time for the lasers and optics to warm up and stabilize. This should be done before the researcher starts preparing the mouse for surgery.\nClean the microscope stage by wiping it down with 70% ethanol.\nFollowing the surgical preparation of the tumor, transfer the imaging stage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 6) onto the microscope stage.\nOnce the mouse is placed under the microscope, scan the tissue using the eyepiece for the region of interest.\nUse the endogenous fluorescence of transgenic immune cells or tumor cells to determine an appropriate region of interest (ROI).\nUsually, regions with blood vessels are chosen to study leukocyte trafficking. However, the choice of the region to be imaged depends on the scientific query being pursued.\nTake care to image regions that reflect the overall biology of the tissue and to avoid any biases being introduced based on selective imaging.\nOnce an ROI is selected, switch the imaging to the multiphoton mode.",
    "At this point, imaging is controlled by computer-assisted software. The authors of this article employ IMSpector (LaVision). The imaging is performed as described previously (Li et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).
