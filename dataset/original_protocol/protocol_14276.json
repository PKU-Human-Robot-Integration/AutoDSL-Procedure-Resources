    "The experimental procedures of this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Animal care conformed to the institutional guidelines and The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Animals were treated according to the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. Male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbour, ME, USA) aged 3-4 months were used for the experiments. Animals were housed under standard conditions (temperature 23 ± 2 °C, humidity range 55 ± 10% and 12 h light/dark cycles), and had access to standard mouse chow and water ad libitum.\n1. Isolation of Mouse Retina\nPlace the dissection instruments on the preparation table and check if all instruments are complete to enable a quick preparation.\nSacrifice the mouse by CO2 inhalation.\nDecapitate the mouse with steel scissors, cut the skull sagitally into two halves using the same pair of scissors and remove the skin and brain using eye scissors (Figure 1).\nCut off the skull bone to leave only the orbital bone by using eye scissors.\nTransfer the orbit into a dissection dish containing ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer.\nKeep the dissection dish on ice or change the buffer every 10 min.\nCut the orbital bone using eye scissors and gently remove the eye globe together with the orbital tissue using type 4 precision tweezers and Student Vannas spring scissors (Figure 2).\nGently remove the Harderian gland, connective tissue, and the extraocular muscles using type 5 precision tweezers and Vannas capsulotomy scissors, taking care not to damage the main branch of the ophthalmic artery.\nLigate orbital branches of the ophthalmic artery and eventually the proximal end of the main branch of the ophthalmic artery using 10-0 Nylon sutures (Figure 3).",
    "Transfer the eye globe into a Petri dish containing 70% ethanol for 10 s using type 4 precision tweezers. Place the eye globe back into the dissection dish and replace the buffer with fresh Krebs solution. The cornea will appear whitish after ethanol exposure .\nPuncture the peripheral cornea with a 30 gauge needle and dissect the cornea using Vannas capsulotomy scissors. Gently cut off the iris tissue, place one sharp point of the Vannas capsulotomy scissors between the choroid and retina, and cut off the choroid and sclera. Leave some scleral tissue around the optic nerve (Figure 4).\n2. Mounting the Retina in the Perfusion Chamber\nNOTE: The perfusion chamber used for retinal arteriole experiments is home-made. It consists of a transparent reservoir with an in- and outflow tube (Figure 5).One end of a silicone tube is glued to the bottom of the chamber with histoacryl adhesive and the other end attached to a three-way stopcock. Connect a syringe containing fresh Krebs buffer to the three-way stopcock and fill the tube with buffer.\nTake a glass micropipette with a needle holder and push it into the end of the tube at the bottom of the perfusion chamber. Then break the tip of the micropipette with type 4 scissors to obtain a tip of 100 µm diameter.\nFocus on the tip of the micropipette and flush it via the syringe connected to the tube. Take care that the capillary is not occluded by debris. In case of occlusion, remove it, flush the tubing and insert another micropipette.\nFill the perfusion chamber with cold Krebs buffer and put the chamber under a stereo microscope.",
    "Place a transparent plastic platform into the perfusion chamber. This platform has an indentation of 1.8 mm width for the optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery and is placed on two steel wires of 1.6 mm diameter. Then, place a stainless-steel ring of 2.8 mm inner diameter and 4.0 mm outer diameter onto the platform.\nTransfer the retina with the optic nerve and attached ophthalmic artery from the dissection chamber into the perfusion chamber with extreme care using a spoon. This step is important to prevent potential stretching of the tissues as it may be detrimental to the experiment.\nCut off the sutured part of the proximal end of the ophthalmic artery, place two preformed loops of 10-0 nylon suture onto the micropipette, and cannulate the ophthalmic artery with the micropipette. Tie the artery to the micropipette (Figure 6) and place the retina onto the transparent platform using fine-point-tweezers.\nGently tear open the anterior lens capsula with two fine point tweezers, pull out the lens, and cut off the whole lens capsula using microscissors.\nSubsequently, make four radial incisions into the retina half the distance from the pars plana to the optic nerve and place a stainless-steel ring onto the retina to fix it to the bottom. The retina is now ready for the experiment (Figure 7).\n3. Preparation of Retinal Arterioles for the Experiment\nPlace the perfusion chamber under a light microscope. The objective is a 100X water-immersion objective lens.\nConnect the two tubings for in- and out-flow to a pericyclic pump and circulate the chamber with Krebs buffer oxygenated with 95% O2 and carbonated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Use a flow rate between 100 and 120 mL/min.",
    "Connect the silicone tube, which is connected to the micropipette, to a reservoir silicone hose via a three-way stopcock. Then, fill the reservoir with Krebs buffer to a height corresponding to 50 mm Hg but do not open the three-way stopcock yet.\nLook through the objectives of the microscope and focus on the retinal surface. Search for blood vessels or red blood cells. It is possible that the blood vessels are completely collapsed, so sometimes only some red blood cells are visible.\nWhen a blood vessel is found, focus on it and open the three-way stopcock. The diameter of the vessel should increase immediately and the red blood cells move either centrifugally, if it is an arteriole, or centripetally in case of a venule. The arterioles are smaller in diameter compared to venules of the same order.\nOnce a blood vessel with a well visible wall is found, it can be employed for experiments following an equilibration period of 30 min (Figure 8). During the equilibration period, the arterioles develop only weak intrinsic tone resulting in less than 10% of luminal diameter reduction.\n4. Performing the Experiment\nTest the viability of vessels with the thromboxane mimetic 9,11-dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F2α (U46619) by adding it to the bath solution. This agent constricts mouse retinal arterioles by about 50% from resting diameter at concentrations of ≥ 10-6 M.\nOnce the vessel is confirmed viable, wash the agonist out of the bath by circulating the pump and supply fresh Krebs buffer into the bath.\nSubscription Required.
