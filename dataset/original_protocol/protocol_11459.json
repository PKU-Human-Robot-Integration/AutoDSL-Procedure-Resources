    "NOTE: This protocol has been specifically adjusted for the analysis of the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to trastuzumab of HER-positive gastric cancer cell lines. All laboratory instruments needed are reported in the Table of Materials.\n1. Generation of Targeted Therapy Resistant Subclones\nNOTE: This is the most critical and difficult to standardize step in the protocol due to the fact that different cell lines may exhibit different sensitivities to the targeted therapeutic inhibitor independently from their tumor histotype or drug concentration used.\nCulture NCI-N87 cell line in RPMI medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and glutamine (2 mM, 1%), as a monolayer at 37 °C, and seed it onto 25 cm2 culture flasks.\nAdd to the culture medium in each flask 10 µg/mL of trastuzumab as the starting dose. Expose the cells to the starting dose until they resume growing.\n\tNOTE: The starting dose of the targeted therapy inhibitor should be 10-fold lower than its plasma peak concentration. Plasma peak concentration is the highest level of drug concentration detected in patient blood usually following multiple doses of standard therapy. This value can be retrieved from studies on pharmacokinetics.\nMonitor cell growth with the trypan blue exclusion method; when cell growth is resumed (typically after a period of two to three weeks), expose cells to a 10-fold higher dose concentration of trastuzumab.\nExpose cells to a gradually increasing dose of trastuzumab (from 100 µg/mL to 400 µg/mL) until cells keep growing (after about 2 weeks) despite the presence of a high drug concentration (at least 2.5 - 4-fold higher than the plasma peak).",
    "Perform a clonogenic assay to evaluate the level of resistance to targeted therapy at every change in the concentration of the target therapy inhibitor in the culture medium, and define relative resistance IC50 index (RR IC50) as follows.\nSeed 500 cells in 24 multi-well culture plates.\n\t\tNOTE: 5 wells must be prepared for each condition set.\nExpose cells to increasing target therapy inhibitor (trastuzumab) concentrations from 100 µg/mL up to 400 µg/mL.\nIncubate cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 days.\nAfter incubation, fix and stain samples as follows.\n\t\t\nRemove medium and rinse cells with 10 mL 1x PBS. Remove 1x PBS and add 2 - 3 mL of fixation solution (acetic acid:methanol, 1:7, (vol/vol)). Remove the fixation solution and add 0.5% crystal violet solution. Incubate at room temperature for 2 h\nRemove the crystal violet solution carefully by aspirating with a pipette and immerse plates in tap water to rinse off any crystal violet solution residues. Air-dry at room temperature for up to 2 days.\nCount colonies of more than 50 cells using an inverted microscope (4X magnification).\n\t\tNOTE: Two independent observers are needed for this.\nCalculate RR IC50 as the ratio between the IC50 value of target-therapy-resistant subclone cells and the value of the original/naïve cells.\n2. Validation Protocol for the Candidate Targeted Therapy Resistance Gene (R-gene)\nNOTE: After the characterization of gene expression, signatures associated with the acquired resistance to target therapy and any candidate gene as driver of resistance will be investigated through: a) RT-PCR, and b) Western blot analysis.\nReal-time RT-PCR\nExtract total RNA from cell lines using acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture (see Table of Materials).",
    "Perform reverse transcription (RT) reactions using random hexamer primers and set the thermal cycler as follows: priming at 25 °C for 5 min, RT at 46 °C for 20 min, and RT inactivation at 95 °C for 1 min.\nUse 400 ng of total RNA for a 20 µL reaction. Prepare the reaction mixture for sample as follows: 7 µL RNase free H2O, 2 µL cDNA (10 ng/µL), 1 µL 20x fluorescent-labeled target-specific probe, and 10 µL 2x Mix containing buffer, dNTPs, and DNA polymerase (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 20 µL of the reaction mixture to each well plate and run the following program: holding stage at 50 °C for 2 min, at 95 °C for 10 min (1 cycle); then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min.\nWestern blot\nRecover cell suspensions by adding 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution and allowing 2 - 3 min for trypsin to work.\nAdd 2 volumes of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to neutralize trypsin (e.g., 2 mL of medium for each 1 mL of trypsin) and centrifuge at 1,200 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant and wash cells with cold 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 x g for 5 min and discard supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet with lysis buffer and incubate on a rocker at 4 °C for 30 min.\n\t\t\nThe amount of lysis buffer depends on the number of cells (e.g., 100 µL for 1 x 106 cells); make sure to prepare fresh lysis buffer each time. For 1 mL of lysis buffer preparation (leave on ice): use 975 µL M-PER Mammalian lysate buffer, 15 µL protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 10 µL 100 µM PMSF inhibitors.",
    "Recover the supernatant protein by cell lysate centrifugation at 13,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.\nDetermine the protein concentrations by using a BCA protein assay.\nAdd 4x LaemmLi Sample Buffer to protein samples (at least 20 - 30 µg of protein) and heat at 100 °C for 3 min.\nUse precast 4 - 20% gels and load 20 - 30 µg of LaemmLi protein solution and 5 - 10 µL of protein standard per sample.\nFill the Western blot ring with TRIS/GLICYNE /SDS 1x buffer and run gel at 110 V for 30 - 60 min (when time stops check that the dye has reached the end of the gel, otherwise run for a few additional minutes)\nElectroblot to transfer protein into a PVDF membrane (see Table of Materials) by using a semi-dry system.\nBlock the membrane by soaking in the appropriate protein solution (milk/BSA 5%) on the shaker at room temperature for 1 h.\nMake a 1:400 solution with anti-IQGAP1 primary antibody in a 5% milk solution (see Table of Materials).\nPlace the membrane in primary antibody solution on a shaker in a cold room overnight.\nThe following day, discard the antibody solution and soak in T-TBS 1x solution (1x T-TBS: 1x Tris Saline Buffer added by Tween20 0.1%) on a shaker at room temperature for 7 min.\nDiscard T-TBS 1x solution and replace. Repeat 3 times.\nMake a 1:10,000 secondary mouse-antibody solution by adding antibody for standard Western blot detection (see Table of Materials) and place the membrane on a shaker; leave at room temperature for 2 h.\nDiscard the antibody solution and soak in T-TBS 1x solution on a shaker at room temperature for 7 min.\nDiscard T-TBS 1x solution and replace. Repeat 3 times.",
    "Soak membrane for 5 min in a chemiluminescent solution, and image the membrane on a chemiluminescence imager.\n3. Restoring Target-therapy Inhibitor Sensitivity by Candidate R-gene Knock-down\nCell preparation\nPrepare single cell suspension by trypsinization. Perform transfection on the day that the cells are plated.\n\t\t\nWash NCI-N87 cells with PBS and incubate at 37 °C with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution for 5 - 10 min. Add 2 volume of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to neutralize trypsin (e.g., 2 mL of medium for each 1 mL of trypsin).\nCount cells with a hemocytometer using trypan blue staining. Seed 2.5 x 105 cells (60% confluence) onto a T25 cm2 flask for each condition.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The appropriate number of cells for seeding is determined by the doubling time of the cell line and the duration of the experiment. The aim is to achieve the target gene knock-down for the entire duration of the experiment. Nine T25 cm2 flasks are ideal for transfection conditions and the clonogenic assay (3 flasks for controls, 3 flasks for negative transfection controls, 3 flasks for gene-target transfection).\nReverse transfection\nPrepare gene-target and negative control transfection mix for each T25 cm2 flask as follows.\n\t\t\nDilute 12.5 µL of each gene-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides or Negative Control siRNA oligonucleotides in minimal essential transfection medium (ratio 1:55; see Table of Materials).\nAdd a cationic liposome transfection reagent (1:1 ratio with gene-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides; see Table of Materials). Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The total volume of the transfection mix is 700 µL.\nAdd 700 µL of the transfection mix to each T25 cm2 flask. Incubate cells at 37 °C for 1 - 3 days.",
