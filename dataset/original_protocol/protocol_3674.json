    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCarry box training\nTiming: 2 weeks\nMarmosets must be ‘box trained’ to enter a carry box in which they can be transported to and from the behavioral testing apparatus. We use a Perspex carry box (dimensions: 24 × 23 × 20 cm). One face of the carry box can be removed and acts as a door, which can be secured with a latch. The latch can also be used to secure the box in the testing chamber. The door and opposite surface have a circular window (diameter 3.5 cm) for food box access together with eight smaller air holes (diameter 1.5 cm).\nWipe down the carry box with a scentless cleaning spray and a clean cloth. Allow time to dry.\nBring the carry box to the cage, checking against the relevant identification to ensure you are training the correct marmoset.\nCritical: always confirm the identity of the animal you are training/collecting against the identification cards affixed to the cage.\nOpen the cage hatch and place the carry box at the opening. Open the box door and attracting the marmoset into the carry box by using small pieces of marshmallow through one of the carry box’s circular windows.\nNote: Some marmosets are distracted by the transparent floor of the Perspex carry box – in this case, you can rest the carry box on an opaque surface on your knee.\nNote: Now is also a good time to familiarize the marmosets with the sound of your voice.\nOnce marmosets enter the carry box, feed them small pieces of marshmallow to familiarize them with the carry box. Spend the first few days simply familiarizing marmosets with the box.",
    "When marmosets readily enter the carry box, transport them to the testing room. You should initially familiarize them with the room itself (by resting the box on a surface in the room) and then only after this with the testing apparatus specifically.\nFamiliarization with the testing apparatus and “door training”\nTiming: 2 weeks\nUltimately, marmosets need to be familiar with being in the testing apparatus for at least 15 min.\nEnsure the testing chamber has been wiped down with cleaning spray. Allow time to dry.\nCollect the marmoset in the carry box as described above and place the carry box into the testing chamber (secured using a latch; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C-l).\nFor the first two to three sessions, leave the main testing chamber door open so the marmoset can see you.\nCritical: Place marshmallow in the carry box at the same time to make the marmosets comfortable in the testing apparatus.\nMarmosets should be relatively comfortable after 2–3 sessions, indicated by them sitting still, eating marshmallow, and looking around the chamber.\nFor the next few sessions, close the testing chamber door and leave the houselight on. We would typically start by doing this for 5 min, gradually extending the duration to ∼20 min.\nFor these sessions, start the CyberLink video recording software. Indicate the name, date, and trial type ('habituation') in the file name.\nCarefully monitor the marmoset for any signs of agitation or distress (including stereotyped behaviors such as excessive turning, gnawing and grooming).\nOnce the time has elapsed, open the testing chamber door and return the marmoset to its home cage.\nWatch the video and for 20 s at the onset of every minute measure:\nLocomotion duration (seconds).\nScanning behaviors (either a count of ‘bouts’ or duration in seconds).\nA count of stereotyped behaviors including turning, gnawing, and grooming.",
    "Keep a running log of the day-by-day extent of these behaviors and determine if the marmoset is habituating to the test apparatus. Locomotion levels/scanning levels should decrease, and stereotyped behaviors should be minimal.\nNext, familiarize marmosets with the operation of the testing apparatus (this is called ‘door training’). The rationale for this step is to familiarize marmosets with the noises made by the opening of the food box doors during the US period.\nProgram the behavioral task to run with an initial wait period of 120 s, after which the door will open (‘US’) with no preceding CS, to reveal marshmallow for 120 s.\nWeigh approximately 6 g of marshmallow (US+) and place it in one of the food boxes. You should also count the number of marshmallow pieces this weight is equivalent to. During door training, alternate between filling the left and right food box pseudo-randomly to ensure marshmallow is present for 2–3 days on the left and 2–3 days on the right per week, so marmosets are familiar with the operation of both food boxes.\nCritical: Always use fresh marshmallow – old marshmallow becomes dehydrated meaning the weight will change and the reward will be less appetizing for the marmosets.\nCollect the marmoset as before and secure the carry box in the testing chamber. Once the chamber door is closed start the video recording software and the behavioral task.\nMonitor the marmoset carefully. They should look very calm and relatively still during the first 120 s (as this period is similar to previous habituation sessions). They may initially be hesitant to reach for the marshmallow.",
    "When animals start consuming marshmallow within 40 s of the door opening over two consecutive sessions, the marmosets are ‘door trained.’ This took our marmosets on average 10 sessions but varied between 4 and 16 sessions depending on how ‘timid’ the marmoset was.\nOnce marmosets are door trained, they are ready to undergo surgical procedures. Note that on testing sessions after door training, the marshmallow reward will be present on one side (varied across animals).\nSurgical procedures\nTiming: 4 weeks to complete all surgical procedures\nAnimals will undergo at least two aseptic surgical procedures: one to implant a telemetric blood pressure monitor (HD-S10 Implant, Data Sciences International [DSI], St. Paul, MN, USA) into the descending aorta, and one to implant intracerebral cannulae targeting the brain region of interest. Telemetric blood pressure monitors are always implanted first, followed by intracerebral cannulae. Both can be implanted sequentially provided there is adequate recovery time between operations of at least ten days. Alternatively, intracerebral cannulae can be implanted further on in the protocol when marmosets have learnt the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task.\nIn advance of the day of surgery:\nWeigh marmosets the day before surgery. Surgery should not take place if there is a 10% or greater reduction in weight compared to the previous week.\nAdditionally, 24 h before telemetry surgery, give marmosets prophylactic antibiotic treatment with oral enrofloxacin (Baytril; 0.2 mL of a 25 mg/mL oral solution; Elanco, IN, USA) mixed with 0.4 mL diluted blackcurrant squash (Tesco, UK).\nIt is also important to check the to-be-implanted telemetry probe is functioning properly and document the relevant settings on the DSI software as per the manufacturer’s guidance.\nEnsure marmosets are nil-by-mouth at least 12 h prior to surgery to minimize the risk of aspiration during general anesthetic.",
    "Ensure you have everything you need – in particular, double check that you have enough isoflurane and oxygen cylinders.\nOn the day of surgery:\nPre-medicate the marmoset with i.m. ketamine hydrochloride (Ketavet; 0.1 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution; Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA) by cleaning an area of the lateral thigh with alcohol and injecting at a 90° angle. Place the marmoset in an incubator (warmed to 34°C) until fully sedated.\nOnce sedated, we administer meloxicam s.c. (Metacam; 0.075 mL of a 2 mg/mL solution; Boehringer Ingelheim) for all surgeries. For telemetry surgery, we additionally administer enrofloxacin s.c. (Baytril; 0.2 mL of a 25 mg/mL injectable solution). Administer s.c. medications by cleaning the skin, lifting a small area of skin and injecting at a shallow angle.\nShave the relevant incision sites.\nFor telemetry surgery, shave the abdomen from the inguinal ligament to the xiphoid process of the sternum.\nFor intracerebral cannulation surgery, shave the scalp taking care to avoid the ear tufts as these act as important social signals.\nWeigh and record the marmoset’s weight.\nOnce sedated, shaved, and weighed, transfer the animal to the surgical suite. Our surgical suite consists of an operating table with a heat mat, an anesthetic machine (Compact Anesthesia Systems; VetTech Solutions Ltd., Cheshire, UK) and a scavenger system.\nInduce anesthesia using a facemask covering the mouth and nose which delivers the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane (4% in 0.6–0.8 L/min O2; Baxter International, IL, USA).\nAssess the depth of anesthesia using deep-tendon reflexes: when there is no reflex in the ankle extensors, the animal is sufficiently anesthetized.",
    "Intubate the marmoset. This requires at least two people. A third person should ideally be available to prepare the anesthetic circuit after intubation. A good description of small non-human primate intubation is provided in the reference Morris et al. (1997)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11].\nOne person uses one hand to hold the marmoset at the angle of the jaw. The index finger of the other hand is hooked onto the marmoset’s canine, opening the marmoset’s mouth.\nNote: ensure that you have good lighting shining into the marmoset’s pharynx – you should be able to see the epiglottis beyond the root of the tongue and the opening into the larynx.\nA second person prepares the endotracheal (ET) tube and a Q-tip sprayed with the anesthetic lidocaine (IntuBeaze 20 mg/mL oromucosal spray; Dechra, Shrewsbury, UK).\nApply the Q-tip with lidocaine onto the epiglottis to relax it for at least 15 s.\nInsert the ET tube into the trachea. The ET tube is in the right position if the marmoset has an effective cough upon insertion.\nThe gas supply is then switched from the facemask to the ET tube. The anesthetic flow is modified for the new circuit (2.25%–2.75% isoflurane in 0.3–0.4 L/min O2). The marmoset is laid down on a heat mat.\nAttach the monitoring equipment (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Monitoring equipment for surgical procedures\nAdapted from Jackson (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12].\n(A) Capnograph/pulse oximeter, showing clockwise from top left: expired CO2 partial pressure (EtCO2), oxygen saturation (SpO2%), pulse rate, breathing profile, and respiratory rate.

    "Attach a pulse-oximeter (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) to the marmoset’s paw (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) to monitor O2 saturations (>95%) and pulse rate (200–250 beats per minute) and a capnograph to monitor end-tidal CO2 (35–55 mmHg) and respiratory rate (20–45 breaths per minute; Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). We use a combined pulse-oximeter and capnograph (MicroCap Handheld Capnograph; Oridion Capnography Inc., MA, USA).\nMonitor core body temperature (36°C–38°C) using a lubricated rectal thermometer (TES-1319 K-type digital thermometer; TES Electrical Electronic Corp., Taiwan; Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nIn telemetry surgery (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), marmosets undergo a laparotomy to implant an HD-S10 transmitter probe which continuously detects and transmits an arterial blood pressure trace via radio-frequency signals. This telemetry implant is suitable for small animals including marmosets, rats, ferrets, guinea pigs and others. This procedure needs three people: a surgeon, an anesthetist, and an assistant. The anesthetist should record observations every 5 min from the onset of anesthesia.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. The telemetry probe and insertion of the probe during telemetry surgery\n(A) Telemetry probe. The probe body contains a battery, signal emitter and sensor. The catheter is filled with a non-compressible fluid and bio-compatible gel at the catheter tip. The tip is coated with an anti-thrombogenic film.\n(B) Implantation procedure. Blood flow in the descending (abdominal) aorta is briefly occluded and a small incision is made in the arterial wall. A catheter introducer with a grooved tip is used to lift a flap at the incision site. The catheter is introduced using forceps and is guided into the vessel through a groove in the catheter introducer. Once the catheter was in place and an adequate signal is detected, the catheter is secured in place with glue and a cellulose patch.",
    "Once the animal is intubated and under stable anesthesia with monitoring in place, place a sterile drape on the heat mat (lifting the marmoset up) and rest the marmoset back down in a supine position.\nSecure the upper and lower limbs using small pieces of measuring tape.\nCritical: the surgery should be carried out under aseptic conditions. The surgeon and their assistant must now wash their hands using iodine or chlorhexidine and must don sterile gloves, a sterile gown and a surgical mask.\nClean the abdomen using chlorhexidine (Chloraprep SEPP applicators; BD, Berkshire, UK) and cover the abdomen with an Ioban-2 antimicrobial incision drape (3M, St. Paul, MN).\nThe initial stage of the laparotomy to isolate the abdominal aorta is performed as follows:\nCut the skin and rectus sheath using a scalpel, with a single vertical incision extending from the xiphoid process to an imaginary horizontal line at the level of the anterior superior iliac spines.\nCut through the linea alba using sterile scissors and make an incision into the peritoneal cavity.\nThe intestines are exposed using blunt dissection and positioned to the sides of the peritoneal cavity, held in place using metal retractors. The abdominal aorta should be visible as a large vessel in the retroperitoneum. Ensure it is exposed from the level of the coeliac trunk to its bifurcation in the common iliac arteries.\nNote: in some cases, the intestines are particularly voluminous and will need to be exteriorized to visualize the abdominal aorta – if this is necessary, keep them moist by placing the bowel loops in between swabs soaked in sterile saline.\nSeparate this portion of the aorta from the surrounding viscera, fat, and connective tissue using blunt dissection with soft pressure swabs.",
    "Once separated, pass an 8 cm piece of thread under the aorta approximately 1 cm superior to its bifurcation. Use a hemostat to clamp the thread and apply gentle tension to the aorta in preparation for implantation.\nIn parallel an assistant should be preparing the insertion needle used to insert the telemetry probe catheter into the aorta, and the telemetry probe.\nThe needle used to insert the telemetry probe catheter is a 23-gauge needle bent at 60° and needs to be sealed with 10 μL of Vetbond tissue adhesive (3M Animal Care Products, St. Paul, MN, USA) pipetted into the needle chamber (to prevent blood leakage once the aorta is punctured).\nBefore insertion, the telemetry probe catheter is examined for any bubbles using a surgical microscope. If there are bubbles, these can be removed by flushing the catheter probe with pre-supplied catheter gel (pressure implant pre-gel syringe, DSI, St. Paul, MN, USA). The telemetry probe signal should be rechecked by switching the probe on using a magnet and using a radio to test the signal. The probe can remain on for the remainder of the surgery.\nTo insert the telemetry probe:\nThe assistant should use their index finger to apply pressure to the aorta immediately superior to the coeliac trunk.\nThe anesthetist should begin a timer to ensure pressure is maintained for no more than three minutes (with a two-minute warning) to minimize the risk of lower limb ischemia.\nPuncture the aorta approximately 1 cm above the bifurcation using the 23-gauge bent insertion needle.\nInsert the catheter of the telemetry probe into the vessel using a grooved introducer (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) until a small length of tubing (approximately 1.25 cm) is inserted into the vessel.\nOnce inserted, the assistant’s index finger is gradually released over ten seconds.",
    "Apply 10 μL of Vetbond adhesive to the puncture site. Leave the glue to dry for 30 s and check for any bleeding around the insertion site.\nUse the radio to check for correct placement of the catheter.\nCritical: A clear fluctuating tone (corresponding to the cardiac cycle) indicates correct placement. See the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]) if the signal is weak or absent.\nApply a small 0.25 cm2 cellulose patch onto the puncture site together with a further 10 μL of Vetbond adhesive to ensure integrity of the seal.\nFollowing insertion, remove the thread and retractors, gently move the intestines back into position and gently rest the probe on top with the catheter directed as rostrally as possible to minimize any kinks.\nSuture the tabs on the probe body into the abdominal wall using non-absorbable sutures (Ethilon 3-0W; Ethicon Inc., Puerto-Rico, USA).\nClose the muscular abdominal wall using non-absorbable sutures.\nCheck the signal of the probe again using the radio; if the signal remains strong and fluctuant, the probe is working. It can be switched off using the magnet and it is not turned on again until behavioral testing after recovery.\nClose the skin using an absorbable suture (Vicryl 3-0 W9444; Ethicon Inc., Puerto-Rico, USA) and glue the skin by opposing the wound edges either side of the suture using Vetbond.\nStop the anesthetic by turning off the isoflurane (but leave the oxygen on).\nInject 1.0–2.5 mL of sterile saline subcutaneously to replace fluid loss.\nOnce the animal starts to rouse with a cough, remove the ET tube and supply the animal with wafted O2 until it can maintain saturations of 95%–100% independently (usually after 3–5 min).\nPlace the animal in the incubator and monitor regularly during recovery.",
    "Once the animal has recovered, return them to their home cage with food and water.\nAdminister 0.1 mL meloxicam (Metacam; 1.5 mg/mL solution; Boehringer Ingelheim) each morning for three days following surgery.\nAnimals will need a minimum of ten days recovery following surgery.\nIn cannulation surgery, marmosets are implanted using 26-gauge double-pronged guide cannulae (Plastics One; Roanoke, Virginia, USA) targeting bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/Brodmann Area 25) alone (7.0 mm long, 1.0–1.4 mm apart) or both bilateral sgACC/25 and bilateral perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC/Brodmann Area 32; 2.0–3.5 mm long, 1.0–1.2 mm apart).\nOnce the marmoset is under stable anesthesia, it is secured into a stereotaxic frame modified for the marmoset (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]; David Kopf Instruments; Los Angeles, CA, USA).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Stereotaxic frame for cannulation surgery\nThe stereotaxic frame was specially modified for the marmoset. The marmoset was secured on the frame using ear bars (e), eye bars (i) and a mouth bar (m).\nCarefully position the ear bars into each ear canal to prevent lateral movements and adjust their position in the lateromedial (LM) direction until the marmoset is centered in the frame.\nPlace the mouth bar on the hard palate of the marmoset.\nPosition the eye bars in the supraorbital notches of the eye sockets.\nCritical: Apply Lacrilube ointment (Allergan, Bucks, UK) around the eyes and eye bars to prevent the eyes from drying out during surgery.\nEnsure the marmoset’s head is fixed rigidly in place in the stereotaxic frame by applying gentle pressure to the lateral area of the skull and checking for the absence of movement.\nClean the shaved area of the marmoset’s scalp using chlorhexidine as above and place an Ioban-2 antimicrobial drape onto the scalp.",
    "Using a sterile scalpel blade, create a longitudinal incision on the scalp and use retractors to create a clear field of view of the skull surface.\nThe coordinate system (in mm) uses the inter-aural line as the anteroposterior (AP) zero coordinate (positive anteriorly) and the superior sagittal sinus at AP +17.5 as the LM zero coordinate (positive to the animal’s right).\nPositioning of the guide cannulae to target sgACC/25 and/or pgACC/32 needs to be adjusted in-situ according to cortical depth to account for variation in brain size between marmosets.\nWe achieve this by measuring a cortical depth at a standard coordinate (AP +17.5 LM −1.5) called a depth-check. The depth-check is done using a very fine, smooth dental broach (Micro-Mega, Besancon, France) lowered vertically through the brain.\nAt this coordinate, create a burr hole in the skull (approximately 4 mm in diameter) using a dental drill (Dental Micro Motor, Eickemeyer, UK) to expose the dura mater adherent to the brain surface.\nRemove the dura gently using a small needle, bent to a 45° angle, which you can use to hook and remove pieces of dura.\nUsing the broach, take measurements at the cortical surface and at the base of the skull (detected as the broach is lowered and then deflects slightly). The depth is the difference between the surface and the base, and our accepted depth is 5.8–6.8 mm (based on the expected depth from the atlas (Paxinos et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and previous depth checks in our colony).",
    "If the depth at this position falls outside of the range of 5.8–6.8 mm, adjust the AP measurement in steps of 0.5 mm (anteriorly if the depth was >6.8 mm, and posteriorly if the depth was <5.8 mm), and reassess the depth until it falls within the 5.8–6.8 mm range. The burr hole can be extended using the dental drill.\nNote all AP alterations and adjust subsequent coordinates for guide cannulae insertion accordingly.\nTo target pgACC/32, we combine any adjustment from the depth-check together with the co-ordinate from the atlas. For sgACC/25, we use an additional depth-check performed at AP +14.0 LM -1.0 (location according to the atlas, ± any correction from the 'general' depth-check), 0.3 mm lateral to where the injection will be made, because of previous variability in cannula positioning in this region. This allows us to more accurately determine the depth around sgACC/25. We consider a depth of 8.9–9.3 mm to be acceptable, and in a similar fashion we adjust the AP measurement in steps of 0.5 mm until the depth is in this range.\nA burr hole is created at the correct target locations, bilaterally. If the target region is close to the midline, as is the case with these prefrontal regions, then a single burr hole is created that spans the midline to accommodate a bilateral cannula.\nFasten steel screws (0.80 mm, 1/16”; Plastics One) to the skull surrounding the guide cannulae to facilitate adhesion of cement to the skull.\nPaint a layer of Super-Bond dental adhesive (Sun Medical, Shiga, Japan) onto the skull surface, to provide an optimal bonding surface for the dental acrylic mount used to fashion the cannula implant.\nOnce the coordinate with the correct depth has been determined, remove the dura mater with a bent 23-gauge needle.",
    "Insert the double guide cannula.\nUsing the guide prongs of the double lumen cannulae, take another cortical surface measurement.\nFor sgACC/25: lower the cannula vertically downwards until the surrounding skull obstructs you from lowering them further. An ‘estimated’ appropriate length of guide cannula is approximately two-thirds of the depth of the brain at the sgACC/25 co-ordinate, minus 1.0 mm (which is the typical length the injector must protrude beyond the end of the guide cannula).\nFor pgACC/32: angle the cannula to 25° with the tips facing posteriorly and lower them in the same way.\nCritical: you must record the depth you reached with the guide cannulae: the projection of the injectors depends on how much deeper they have to go to reach the target area.\nOnce the guide cannula is in position, apply a small amount of Vetbond adhesive into the hole of the skull containing the cannulae. This is to create a barrier between the brain and the dental acrylic mount.\nInsert cannula blockers, used to maintain patency of the guide cannulae (they do not project beyond the end of the guide cannulae).\nApply dental acrylic (Paladur, Kulzer GmbH, Germany) onto the Super-Bond ensuring to go underneath skull screws and around the guide cannulae.\nNote: use a small spatula to smoothen the acrylic cement as it dries to avoid any sharp edges.\nOnce the cement has cured, suture the loose skin in front and behind the implant using absorbable sutures (Vicryl 3-0 W9444; Ethicon Inc., Puerto Rico, USA).\nAt the end of surgery, give marmosets 0.7 mg intramuscular dexamethasone (0.18 mL of a 3.8 mg/mL solution; Hameln pharma GmbH, Hameln, Germany) to reduce any cerebral edema.",
    "Place stainless steel ‘dummy’ cannulae blockers into the guide cannulae to maintain patency, and screw on brass/aluminum protective caps using the thread on the guide cannulae.\nOnce surgery is completed, switch off the anesthetic, remove the ET tube and recover the animal as above.\nInjectors (for subsequent intracerebral infusions) extend beyond the ends of the guide cannulae. Record the injector lengths for the brain regions that were cannulated. We typically aimed for a depth 2/3 down from the cortical surface for sgACC/25 injectors, whereas we used a fixed projection of +1.5 mm beyond the end of the guide cannula for pgACC/32.\nAdminister oral meloxicam (Metacam; 0.1 mL of 1.5 mg/mL solution; Boehringer Ingelheim) for three days after surgery.\nMarmosets will need at least ten days of recovery after each surgical procedure.\nCritical: caps and cannula blockers should be changed at least once per week, to ensure guide cannula patency. The implant should be cleaned with chlorhexidine and inspected for any signs of infection.\nCritical: Following surgery and recovery, you should check that the marmosets are still comfortable with the Pavlovian apparatus by repeating ‘door training’ (see familiarization with the testing apparatus and ‘door training’[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]).\nOnce the marmosets have re-stabilized, the next step is to counterbalance the auditory cues (‘to-be-CS+’ and ‘to-be-CS-,’ such that the cue with the least intrinsic arousal becomes the CS+ and vice versa) and then commence appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. The next sections describe how to set up and carry out both the one-off counterbalancing session and the subsequent Pavlovian conditioning sessions.\nTraining on the appetitive Pavlovian discrimination task\nTiming: several weeks\nPrepare the testing chamber and software for appetitive Pavlovian conditioning sessions\nTiming: 30 min per day with 10 min to reset the apparatus in between animals.\nPrepare the testing chamber.",
    "Wipe down the testing chamber with cleaning spray and clean out the food boxes using a damp cloth, ensuring that you dry them afterward.\nBefore testing any marmosets, use the Whisker software (Cardinal and Aitken, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to check that all the components of the testing chamber are working, in particular the house light, food box lights, doors, and sounds.\nPlace approximately 6 g of fresh marshmallow in the rewarded food box. You should also count the number of marshmallow pieces you place in the food box. There should be marshmallow in this food box regardless of whether or not there is a rewarding trial scheduled that day. This is to ensure that the marmosets cannot use the smell of the marshmallow to predict whether they will receive marshmallow on that session or not. In so doing, you are ensuring the onset of the CS+ is the only predictor. You can skip this step for the 'counterbalancing auditory cues' session, described below.\nAt least twice per week, place a decibel meter in a carry box and play the auditory cues through the speaker system. Ensure that the auditory cues for the CS+ and CS- measure 70 ± 2dB.\nPrepare the testing software.\nUsing your behavioral task software, prepare the session for the marmoset according to your testing schedule.\nWe name the files ‘marmosetname_sessionnumber-sessiontype_date’ where ‘sessiontype’ is either n, nn, p, np (n = CS-/US- and p = CS+/US+).\nThe key variables for Pavlovian conditioning sessions are the number of trials, the types of trial and the ITI, CS and US duration.",
    "For a CS-/US- (unrewarded) trial, there should be an ITI of 70–110 s; a 20 s auditory cue (CS-) played through the speaker; a 120 s period of the food box light switching on and the opaque door opening revealing an empty food box (US-); and finally closure of the opaque door at the end of the US-.\nFor a CS+/US+ (rewarded trial), there should be an ITI of 70–110 s; a 20 s auditory cue (CS+, distinct) played through the speaker; a 120 s period of the food box light switching on and both the opaque and transparent door opening revealing a full food box (US+); and then termination of the session (the CS+/US+ trial is always the final trial).\nFor the single session to counterbalance auditory cues, name the file ‘marmosetname_counterbalance_date’. Program the task to present each auditory cue three times in a random order, with an ITI of 70–110 s and a duration of 20 s each.\nUsing the Spike2 software, load the telemetry acquisition software which will record the telemetry trace.\nNote: include a textbox where you can name the animal, date, and session number so it is visible on the video when you record.\nLoad the CyberLink software for video recording. We typically have a single screen split into four: three camera views (left food box, right food box and top-down) and one with a screen view of the Spike2 telemetry trace and textbox (as seen in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "The video has been shortened to include only the two trials, without the inter-trial interval (ITI) period. The lower right panel of the video shows the Spike2 telemetry trace and the Spike2 session timer. The CS- trial consists of the baseline period (00:10 to 00:30 on the video; 40 s to 60 s on the Spike2 timer), the CS- cue (00:30 to 00:50 on the video; 60 s to 80 s on the Spike2 timer) and the US- (00:50 to 02:50 on the video; 80 s to 200 s). During the US- period, the non-rewarded food box light is switched on and the opaque door opens to reveal no food reward. The CS+/US+ trial consists of the baseline period (283 s to 303 s), the CS+ period (303 s to 323 s) and the US+ period (323 s to 443 s). During the US+ period, the rewarded food box light is switched on and both the opaque and transparent doors are opened to enable access to marshmallow reward. 443 s marks the end of the session; typically, a two-trial session lasts just over 7 min.\nPrepare the telemetry system.\nUse the DSI software to select the telemetry probe settings of the animal you are going to test.\nGathering the marmoset for testing\nTiming: 5–10 min per day\nCollect the marmoset from the cage, checking the identity card.

    "Calculate the change for each auditory cue using a (CS – baseline) difference measure – we call this ‘CS directed’ (although, technically speaking, the auditory cues are not CSs yet). This will give you six CS directed MAP/heart rate responses; three for each cue type.\nUse a paired t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the MAP response between the two cues.\nIf there is, counterbalance the cues such that the cue provoking the smallest MAP response becomes the CS+ and the cue provoking the largest MAP response becomes the CS-.\nIf there is not, check whether there is a significant difference in the heart rate response and counterbalance the cues in the same way.\nIf there is no difference in MAP or heart rate response, randomly allocate the CS+ and CS- cue taking into account the remainder of your cohort.

The second-by-second mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated using the formula: diastolic blood pressure + ⅓(systolic blood pressure – diastolic blood pressure).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Output from pre-processing of the raw telemetry trace",
    "The tab-separated text file contains seven columns: time of the local maximum of the cardiac cycle used for RR interval/heart rate measurement; RR interval as the time between the local maximum and the previous cardiac cycle maximum (s); heart rate (beats per minute); a second time column corresponding to the local maximum of the cardiac cycle used for systolic blood pressure measurement (identical to the first column); systolic blood pressure (mmHg); a third time column corresponding to local minimum of the cardiac cycle used for diastolic blood pressure measurement; and the diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). Note that the first row of data in the output is ignored during further analysis as the RR interval is calculated using t=0 as the reference point for the previous cardiac cycle maximum (because there is no cardiac cycle preceding the first cycle) generating an erroneous result. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) values for each cycle were calculated later in the analysis.\nOutliers (systolic blood pressure values >200 mmHg or <0 mmHg) are removed.\nRecording failures <0.4 s are replaced using cubic spline interpolation. Failures ≥ 0.4 s are treated as missing values, although data collection is highly reliable overall.\nCritical: Movement of the animal should not cause noise in the telemetry signal, other than in the rare event that the catheter briefly kinks with abdominal flexion. This causes a brief signal drop-out, which is treated as a recording failure (37b).\nThe onset times and durations of the events in the task, including CS onset and US onset, should be outputted from the behavioral testing program controlling the apparatus.",
    "We developed our own simple in-house software to ‘read’ the onset time file and ‘read’ the corresponding Spike2 tab-separated result file of the same name and calculate average absolute systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, MAP and heart rate for:\nThe 20 s baseline period (before CS- or CS+)\nThe 20 s CS period\nThe 120 s US period (additionally separated into 20 s windows) The software also calculated the difference between:\nCS and baseline (CS directed)\nUS and CS (US directed) Additional measures may include:\nThe maximum heart rate and/or blood pressure during the CS-/CS+/US-/US+ periods\nThe heart rate and/or blood pressure values during 10 s windows of the CS and US periods\nCreate a file with a running summary of each animal’s heart rate and blood pressure data day-by-day. The main data points you will be using are the CS directed and US directed values for MAP and heart rate.\nNote: record absolute blood pressure values too, to see if there are any baseline differences in cardiovascular function from day-to-day (or following an infusion).\nTo determine whether the marmosets have successfully acquired conditioned cardiovascular discrimination between the CS- and the CS+, perform a paired t test over the previous four consecutive sessions containing both CS-/US- and CS+/US+ (np).\nIf there is a significant difference between the CS directed MAP responses to the CS+ and CS- with increased CS directed responses to the CS+, the marmosets are deemed to have successfully discriminated. In our cohort of marmosets, cardiovascular conditioning was most reliably evidenced on MAP measures, although there was also a significant difference in heart rate responses.",
    "Continue to analyze data in this way, including on your run sheet a column where you can signify which days marmosets had a mock infusion, control infusion or drug infusion (see mock infusion sessions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.7] and intracerebral infusions and testing following infusions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]).\nCritical: It is also important to check that the marmosets are also showing US directed cardiovascular responses. We found marmosets would show increases in MAP over-and-above the CS+ during the US+ period, resulting in a positive US directed response.\nNote: Generally speaking, discrimination should be stable once acquired, but make sure you are aware of any ‘blips’ in marmosets arousal response. There’s usually a reason for this, like disruption in the home cage or in the home room. If a marmoset does have an ‘off day,’ we necessitated two more CS+ sessions with stable performance (including the CS+/US+ single trial sessions) before re-commencing infusions.\nAnalyzing your behavioral data\nTiming: 1 h per day\nWatch the video recording of the day’s session and score the behaviors. The same time windows are important as mentioned above in Analyzing your cardiovascular data. The behaviors to be scored include:\nLocomotion (duration in seconds) during the baseline and CS periods.\nHead-jerks (rapid side to side flicks of the head, best visualized from the top-down view with blurring of the ear tufts – the head moves very fast indeed) during the baseline and CS periods.\nNote: Head-jerks vary considerably between animals. Whilst some animals make very fast orienting movements, others show a slower head orienting response to sound cues which nevertheless distinguish the CS+ from the CS-. It is important to carefully compare the CS+ and the CS- during training to determine the behavior the animal makes to the CS+ vs. CS-.",
    "The latency to grab the food reward during the US+ period if you haven’t already recorded this. Along with the mass of marshmallow consumed.\nAlongside the animal’s running summary of cardiovascular data, create a running log of their behavioral performance too.\nDetermine whether marmosets show significant behavioral discrimination using head-jerk data, in a similar way to determining cardiovascular discrimination described above. Record behaviors as a running summary alongside your cardiovascular data.\nNote: Generally, behavioral measures displayed by the marmosets tend to discriminate between the CS+ and CS- before cardiovascular ones, but successful discrimination requires both significant behavioral and cardiovascular discrimination.\nMock infusion sessions\nTiming: 30 min per day on 4–5 days over the course of 2 weeks\nOnce marmosets are discriminating based on behavioral and cardiovascular measures, you can carry out mock infusions before testing sessions. This acclimatizes marmosets to the infusion procedure, ensuring that it does not disrupt their subsequent performance or confound interpretation of intracerebral infusions. Mock infusions should be carried out in a separate minor procedures room, in the same place where you will carry out the intracerebral infusions. You will need two people for this.\nUsing plastic laminate dividers, divide the marmoset into a quadrant of its home cage. Try and remove as much equipment from this quadrant as possible to make it easier for another researcher to catch the marmoset.\nIn the infusion room, all you will need is a drape, an infusion pump, non-sterile gloves and a timer. Place the drape on the table and ensure the infusion pump is on – no Hamilton syringes need to be in situ; the pump is only there to make a noise.\nAsk your colleague to catch the marmoset and bring it to the infusion room.",
    "Note: It is better if someone other than the experimenter catches the marmoset, so the experimenter maintains as good a relationship with the marmoset as possible.\nUsing non-sterile gloves, handle the marmoset’s caps mimicking their removal. Marmosets will likely already be accustomed to this, because their caps and cannulae blockers will have been changed in a similar way.\nPress the infusion pump and start a timer for two minutes, the duration over which infusions run. In so doing, you are acclimatizing marmosets to the sounds of an infusion procedure.\nOnce the timer has finished, handle the marmoset’s caps again, mimicking their reinsertion, and ask the researcher to return the marmoset to the home cage, pulling out the dividers so it can move freely around the entire home cage.\nLeave the marmoset in the home cage for a time period equivalent to the action time of the drug (usually between 10–30 min).\nTest the marmoset in the usual way and analyze the data from the session to see if the mock infusion has affected their performance in any way. We would wait for 2–3 sessions of stable performance following mock infusions before commencing real infusions.\nIntracerebral infusions and testing following infusions\nTiming: Intracerebral infusions typically take 20 min to set up and 15 min to perform. Each drug will have its own ‘wait time’ for pharmacological action before you should test the animals. Typically, the procedure will take approximately 45 min.\nOnce marmosets have maintained stable discrimination following mock infusions, they can undergo intracerebral infusions prior to testing sessions. A single experimenter can set up the infusion equipment, but for actual infusions two experimenters are needed.",
    "Check the wait time of your drug. If the wait time is less than 10 min, set up the testing apparatus in advance as described in Prepare the testing chamber and software for Pavlovian conditioning sessions. If the wait time is greater than 10 min, you can set up during the wait time.\nFirst, spray down the area in the infusion room with cleaning spray and wipe with a cloth. Spray the infusion pump and an Eppendorf holder and wipe these down, too.\nRemove an Eppendorf containing the drug solution from the −20°C freezer and place it in the Eppendorf holder, allowing it to defrost and equilibrate to room temperature whilst the rest of the infusion system is being set up.\nCritical: leave the Eppendorf closed as the drug solution contained within it is sterile and should be exposed to air for the minimal amount of time possible.\nLay down a sterile drape, ensuring only to handle the very edges of the drape to maintain the rest of the field as sterile. Make sure there is a sharps bin next to the drape to dispose of sharps. Empty the following onto the sterile drape:\nTwo sterile Hamilton syringes (gas-tight 10 μL Model 701RN syringes; Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA).\nThe relevant injector (these will be different lengths depending on the surgical coordinates of the animal the brain region being infused). The injectors for sgACC/25 and pgACC/32 are double lumen injectors to infuse into the left and right brain region simultaneously. Each lumen is attached to a separate Hamilton syringe via a separate infusion line.\nTwo loops of approximately 70 cm long sterile 0.3 mm plastic tubing (VWR International Ltd., UK).",
    "Two pairs of sterile 1 cm long yellow bung tubing to attach the plastic tubing to the Hamilton syringes at one end and the injector at the other end.\nA sterile 1 mL syringe and a small 23-gauge needle, for filling the Hamilton syringes and plastic tubing.\nSterile gauze.\nSterile gloves.\nSterile caps and cannulae blockers to replace the caps and blockers that will be removed during the infusion. Have a tube filled with detergent nearby, into which the old caps and cannulae blockers can be placed during the infusion for subsequent sterilization.\nHave a marker pen that has been wiped down to the side of the sterile drape. This will be used to mark air bubbles at the end of the set-up.\nYou will also need a vial of sterile saline to fill the 1 mL syringe used to fill the Hamilton syringes and infusion lines. The vial itself is not sterile so do not place it on the drape; place it to the side within easy reach. It will need to be handled with sterile gauze.\nFill the 1 mL syringe with sterile saline, using gauze to open and handle the vial.\nSet up the infusion pump, syringes, and tubing on top of the drape. See Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] for the complete set up.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

The Hamilton syringes are mounted onto a syringe pump with an adjustable rate.\n(B) Hamilton syringe.",
    "(C) Infusion line after an infusion. Prior to an infusion, the syringes and lines are filled with 0.9% sterile saline. A bubble is manually drawn up, and then drug (or saline control) is drawn up so that the fluid after the bubble is the substance to be infused. The bubble is marked with permanent marker. This is used to assess fluid movement – as can be seen, the bubble has moved beyond the initial markings.\nCritical: Infusions are aseptic procedures. Experimenters must wash their hands and don sterile gloves.\nWe use an infusion pump (Kd Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) set to a diameter for the 10 μL Hamilton syringe (0.485 mm) and a rate between 0.25 μL/min and 0.5 μL/min depending on the drug infused. The pump is positioned to the left-hand side of the sterile drape.\nSet up the Hamilton syringes.\nRemove the plunger of the Hamilton syringe and insert the saline filled syringe.\nInject saline into the Hamilton syringe, withdrawing the needle tip out of the syringe at the same time to fill the Hamilton with saline without any bubbles.\nPlace the plunger into the Hamilton syringe. Gently push the plunger in, tapping with your thumb. You should feel a gentle impulse with resistance and a droplet of saline will appear from the end of the Hamilton syringe.\nNote: If there is no resistance and the plunger moves too easily, try refilling the Hamilton syringe with saline as there is most likely an air bubble.\nUse a piece of sterile gauze to handle the infusion pump and place the syringe in the infusion pump. We find that two syringes placed symmetrically apart from the center works best.",
    "Note: try to leave a droplet of saline at the end of each Hamilton syringe (by pushing on the plungers slightly when the syringes are mounted in the pump) as this helps establish an airtight seal when the infusion lines are attached.\nSet up the infusion lines.\nAttach the yellow bung tubing to either end of the plastic tubing.\nAttach the relevant injector to one end of the infusion tubing using the yellow bung tubing.\nUsing the sterile saline-filled syringe, inject saline into the two free ends of the infusion tubing and withdraw as you do so, creating an airtight saline-filled line in the same way the Hamilton syringes were prepared. A jet of saline should be visualized from the two prongs (left and right) of the injector.\nNote: if there is resistance as you fill the lines with saline, or no jet emerges, the injector could be blocked. Try a new sterile injector.\nAttach the free end of the tubing onto the Hamilton syringes, and lie the injector onto the sterile drape.\nWithdraw both Hamilton syringes very slightly, one at a time, to create an approximately 0.25 μL air bubble visualized in the tubing near the injector.\nNow, place the free end of the injector into the defrosted drug solution (or defrosted 0.9% saline solution in the case of a control session). Take care not to touch the injector tips to anything other than the sterile drape or drug solution.\nWithdraw the Hamilton syringe plungers to draw up drug solution into the line. From Hamilton syringe to injector, the lines now contain saline → air bubble → drug (or saline) solution.",
    "Mark the air bubble in each infusion line with a permanent marker. This will allow you to verify that the infusion set up is working during the infusion by seeing the bubble move.\nCritical: you should test the system is working by pressing RUN on the infusion pump for a few seconds and see that (1) the bubble in each infusion line moves and (2) fluid comes out from the tips of the injector. Remark the bubble after this and wipe away excess solution with sterile gauze, ready for the infusion.\nOnce you are satisfied the infusion system is working, ask another person (to whom the marmoset is accustomed to being held by) to catch the marmoset from the cage and bring the marmoset into the infusion room.\nUnscrew the marmoset’s cap and remove the cannulae blockers, placing them into a detergent solution.\nUse an alcohol or chlorhexidine wipe to wipe the top of the exposed guide cannulae.\nCheck that the infusion pump settings are correct for the drug you are infusing.\nChange into sterile gloves and hold the injector ensuring that the prongs do not touch anything. Ask the holder to gently secure the marmoset’s head.\nNote: a bib can be worn by the holder which the marmoset can chew as a distraction during the infusion.\nInsert the injector tip into the lumen of the guide cannulae.\nPress RUN on the infusion pump, and simultaneously start the timer for 2 min.\nCheck that the bubble is moving against the mark. If you have drawn up a bubble of approximately 0.25 μL, it should move two lengths per minute if the infusion rate is 0.5 μL/min.",
    "Critical: if the bubbles do not move (or move less than expected), you may have a partial or complete blockage in the line. See the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]) for advice.\nOnce the 2 min timer has finished, stop the pump and time for an additional 1 min to allow the drug to diffuse.\nOnce the 1 min timer has finished, remove the injector from the guide cannulae lumen, detach it from the tubing and place it into a tube of detergent solution for subsequent sterilization.\nCritical: now start a timer for the ‘wait time’ of your drug.\nReplace the guide cannulae and caps and ask the holder to return the animal to its home cage, withdrawing the plastic dividers so the animal can roam freely.\nPause Point: (10–15 min) In the wait time, set up the testing apparatus if needed and check that the apparatus is working. If you are infusing a new drug or infusing a drug for the first time, check in on the marmoset during the wait time to ensure there are no obvious side-effects.\nApproximately two minutes before the wait time is over, gather the marmoset from its home cage as described in Gathering the marmoset for testing.\nCarry out the testing session as described in Carrying out standard testing sessions. Infusion sessions will always be carried out on a session with both a CS-/US- and CS+/US+ trial.\nAfter the infusion and testing session is complete, ensure you document the date of the infusion and the drug that was infused.\nAnalyze the cardiovascular and behavioral data as described in Analyzing your cardiovascular data and Analyzing your behavioral data. Remember that all behavioral data must be scored by a blinded observer.",
    "We would recommend stable performance on at least one session with a CS-/US- and CS+/US+ trial before doing another drug infusion.\nMeasuring the efficacy of antidepressants\nTiming: variable.\nIn Alexander et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], we use this paradigm coupled with intracerebral infusions of the drug dihydrokainic acid (DHK, which reduces glutamate reuptake in astrocytes) into sgACC/25 to show that over-activity in this area is sufficient to blunt the anticipatory (CS directed) arousal to reward. This provided causal evidence for the correlative findings in humans that over-activity in this region (identified using functional neuroimaging) was associated with blunted reward responsivity seen in anhedonia and depression. This blunting of anticipatory appetitive responses allowed us to test the ability of different antidepressants to reverse this effect. We describe this below.\nSelect the antidepressant you wish to test. We tested both racemic ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and citalopram, an SSRI.\nDetermine the dose of drug to use. For ketamine, we used an i.m. dose of 0.5 mg/kg akin to that used in i.v. humans (Berman et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For citalopram, we were guided by a previous study in our laboratory showing an acute dose of 10 mg/kg i.m. citalopram can reduce anxiety-like behavior displayed by marmosets to a human intruder (Santangelo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "Determine the timepoint to test therapeutic efficacy. For ketamine, we chose 4 h, 1 day, 7 days and 21 days (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). These were chosen to coincide with work in humans showing a rapid (4 h) and sustained (1 day and 7 day) effect of ketamine to improve depression scores (Abdallah et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Berman et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For citalopram we chose 30 min to match with the previous study in our laboratory mentioned above. In humans, citalopram is known to have rapid effects on brain reactivity to fearful faces (Murphy et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/599-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Testing the efficacy of ketamine to ameliorate blunted reward processing\nAdapted from (Alexander et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Marmosets receive a single i.m. injection of 0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine at t = 0, followed by over-activation of sgACC/25 using DHK 4 h, 1 day and 7 days later. Marmosets also received an infusion of DHK 21 days later to determine if the effect of ketamine had abrogated (not shown). 10 min before each timepoint, DHK was infused into sgACC/25 and marmosets were tested on the appetitive Pavlovian discrimination paradigm (CS-/US-, CS+/US+ session which lasts approximately 7 min).\nIdeally, we would have liked to administer citalopram chronically to achieve greater face validity with its use as a first-line antidepressant in humans, although this is logistically challenging. Options would include using an osmotic minipump system (more invasive but more precise dosing) or dissolving citalopram in drinking water (less invasive but imprecise dosing).\nAdminister the antidepressant. In the case of i.m. administration, two people are needed – one holder and one injector. We recommend carrying out i.m. injections in a separate room to intracerebral infusions, and acclimatizing marmosets to this procedure with mock injections prior to injections of saline control/antidepressant.",
    "Divide the marmoset off in the same way described in point 37 of mock infusion sessions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.7].\nPrepare your equipment: a 0.5 mL insulin syringe; the antidepressant to be injected; a sharps bin and alcohol spray.\nDraw up the required volume in the insulin syringe, ensuring there are no bubbles.\nCritical: Ketamine is a controlled substance and may require special documentation prior to its administration.\nAsk the holder to collect the marmoset from the home cage, holding the leg to be injected between the fourth and fifth finger to expose the lateral aspect of the quadriceps muscle.\nSpray a small amount of alcohol onto the lateral quadriceps where you will inject.\nUse the insulin syringe to inject at a 45° angle to the surface of the skin, into the body of the quadriceps muscle.\nCritical: do not inject large volumes of fluid via the i.m. route; we used a maximum volume of 0.1 mL. If multiple i.m. injections are required, use alternate legs.\nReturn the marmoset to the home cage. If this is the first time injecting a drug, monitor carefully for side effects.\nIn the wait time between administration and the onset of therapeutic efficacy, prepare the testing chamber and software as described in Prepare the testing chamber and software for appetitive Pavlovian conditioning sessions, and prepare the infusion system as described in intracerebral infusions and testing following infusions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5].",
    "Approximately 10 min before the timepoint to test therapeutic efficacy, infuse either saline or DHK into sgACC/25 as described in intracerebral infusions and testing following infusions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]. For example, after the one-off i.m. ketamine injection, we infused DHK 10 min before the 4 h, 1-day, 7-day and 28-day timepoints post-injection as described above. Ketamine successfully reversed the anticipatory blunting at the 1-day and 7-day timepoints, but not at 4 h (no rapid effect of ketamine) or 21 days (chosen to establish that ketamine’s effect had worn off).\nAfter 10 min – the wait time for DHK – test the marmoset on the Pavlovian conditioning test. Analyze the cardiovascular and behavioral data and determine whether the antidepressant successfully reverses the blunted CS+ induced arousal expected from sgACC/25 over-activation.\nCritical: before further testing, it is critical to establish that the antidepressant’s effect has worn off by re-testing the effect of DHK – particularly relevant to ketamine, which is known to have sustained efficacy."
