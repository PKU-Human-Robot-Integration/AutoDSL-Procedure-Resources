    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFor culture of white adipose tissue explants, please follow steps 1–6. For mature adipocyte isolation and culture, proceed with steps 7–27.\nCulture of white adipose tissue explants\nTiming: 4 h\nThe culture of WAT explants is an essential procedure that allows us to mimic and study the tissue’s natural environment. This method helps preserve the cellular structure and functions, providing valuable insights into adipose tissue biology.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Sterile techniques must be upheld throughout the entire process to reduce the risk of contamination and its potential adverse effects on cell viability.\nWith sterile scissors, dissect the adipose tissue into small, uniformly sized pieces of approximately 40 mg each.\nGently place two of the pre-cut adipose tissue pieces into each well of a 24-well plate containing 350 μL of DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 0.2% of BSA. Ensure that the explants are fully immersed in the medium.\nPlace the culture dishes with the adipose tissue explants in a cell culture incubator set to 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1–2 h.\nNote: Tissue should rest for at least 1 h before proceeding, but not longer than 2 h.\nCheck the culture under a microscope to assess the integrity of the adipose tissue explants.\nPerform any necessary experiments or treatments based on your experimental design.\nNote: Cell culture incubations or treatments should be performed in a cell culture incubator.\nNote: The viability of adipose tissue explants can exhibit variability, typically spanning from several hours up to approximately 24 h under experimental conditions. During this time, various metabolic processes can be studied such as the uptake and release of nutrients or the response to hormones, as well as gene expression analysis.",
    "After the treatment, you may collect the conditioned medium from the adipose tissue explants. This medium can be utilized in experiments like ELISAs to analyze secreted proteins. Alternatively, you can also collect the adipose tissue itself for further studies, such as RNA expression or Western Blot analyses.\nNote: Your decision to collect either the conditioned medium or the adipose tissue depends on your research objectives and experimental requirements.\nNote: Performing experiments involving adipose tissue explants are conducted within an incubator, as it provides a controlled environment that mimics the physiological conditions necessary for maintaining the viability and functionality of the tissue explants.\nAdipose tissue digestion\nTiming: 2 h\nIn addition to studying WAT explants, isolating mature adipocytes, which are key in fat storage, release, and hormonal regulation,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] can be a focal point of your study. The digestion of adipose tissue allows you to isolate these cells for subsequent investigation. This procedure entails the disruption of the extracellular matrix and connective tissue, resulting in the liberation of individual cells for further investigation.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Using a cell culture hood throughout the entire process is essential to ensure sterility. After euthanizing the animal and harvesting the adipose tissue, the following are the steps for adipose tissue digestion:\nWeigh each adipose tissue separately.\nPlace the excised tissue in a sterile petri dish containing PBS with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCut the adipose tissue into small pieces using sterile scissors and forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer the minced tissue to a new sterile petri dish containing PBS. Repeat this step twice for a total of three consecutive washes.\nNote: This step helps eliminate impurities and contaminants, thereby creating a suitable environment for experimentation.",
    "Adjust the collagenase concentration based on the tissue weight. For 2 g of collected WAT adipose tissue, we use 10 mL of PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% collagenase.\nNote: The collagenase solution plays a crucial role in enzymatically dissociating cells from tissue fragments, enabling the isolation of target cells.\nTransfer the minced tissue into a sterile 50 mL Falcon tube containing the collagenase solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nIncubate the tube for 30 min–1 h at 37°C on an orbital shaker set at 200 rpm. This allows for the collagenase enzyme to digest the tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: In the context of this particular protocol, subcutaneous WAT may undergo incubation for a maximum duration of 1 h during the digestion process. Conversely, visceral WAT is incubated with collagenase solution for a period not exceeding 30 min. This shorter digestion time for visceral WAT aims to mitigate the risk of excessive adipocyte breakdown.\nCritical: Be sure to optimize the digestion time for your specific adipose tissue and experimental needs. Extended digestion may lead to increased adipocyte death, whereas inadequate digestion could result in incomplete tissue dissociation.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Consider running pilot experiments to determine the optimal digestion time for your tissue type.\nAdipocyte separation\nTiming: 30 min\nUpon completion of the digestion process (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), the subsequent steps focus on segregating the mature adipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and tissue remnants.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3099-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Separation of mature adipocytes\n(A) Adipose tissue after incubation with the collagenase solution.\n(B) Digested samples after the first centrifugation.\n(C) Inverted tube to facilitate complete mixing of phases.\n(D) Separation of mature adipocytes (arrow) from SVF and tissue remnants after centrifugation.\nCentrifuge the digested samples at 300 g for 5 min at 22°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nInvert the tube to facilitate thorough phase mixing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Repeat the centrifugation step under the same conditions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: This centrifugation step will separate the different components of the tissue suspension based on their sedimentation rates.\nCollect the mature adipocytes from the top portion of the centrifuge tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and carefully transfer them into a new 15 mL Falcon tube with a Pasteur pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3099-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Process of cultivation of mature adipocytes\n(A and B) Mature adipocytes seeded in culture dishes.",
    "(C) Culture medium and mature adipocytes collected in Eppendorf tubes.\nNote: Owing to the heterogeneous size distribution of mature adipocytes, precise cell counting, and seeding densities become challenging to determine. The number of seeded wells is based on the total weight of the adipose tissue instead. In this specific protocol, using a 12-well plate, we recommend placing the adipocytes isolated from 1 g of tissue into each individual well.\nCritical: To achieve uniform dispersion of mature adipocytes across the culture plate, it is imperative to thoroughly homogenize them with the medium before seeding. Adipocytes have a tendency to float, and without adequate mixing, they might not distribute evenly within the plate, potentially affecting the success of the culture establishment.\nPlace the adipocytes in a cell culture incubator for 18 h, maintaining an environment of 37°C and 5% CO2.\nIn line with the experimental schedule, continue with the planned assays, treatments, or experiments.\nCollect the mature adipocytes with the medium and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 22°C.\nPost-centrifugation, cautiously collect the adipocytes that have floated to the top (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nRinse these with PBS and repeat the centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at 22°C.\nRecover the mature adipocytes from the uppermost layer using a micropipette to perform the subsequent analysis or freeze at −80°C in an Eppendorf for preservation.\nCritical: It is important to note that the viability and functionality of the adipocytes might decrease as the duration of the culture extends. As such, it is standard practice to use mature adipocytes in experiments within the first 48 h post-isolation to ensure optimal functionality and responsiveness of the cells.",
    "Note: While not a mandatory step in the protocol, the visual examination of adipocytes under a microscope can be enriched by investigating the maturity of adipocytes through analyzing typical markers like PPARG, FASN, and GLUT4, among others. The analysis of mature adipocytes can take place either immediately before or after freezing. In this scenario, frozen adipocytes can maintain RNA and protein quality for several months to a year when preserved at −80°C. As a result, RNA and/or protein extraction can be conducted during this timeframe."
