    "This research was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (NO. 174A01) and the Animal Ethical Committee of the Guangzhou Forevergen Biosciences Laboratory Animal Center (IACUC-G160100). All animals were bred in the same room in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment, and experiments were carried out in a conventional environment. The mice used for breeding were 7-8 weeks old; the mice for inducing NEC (n = 72) were separated from the dam on Day 4, and the dams(n=14) were kept in the original cage and nursed the control (Cont.) group mice(n=24).\n1. Preparation of reagents and devices\nPrepare the milk substitute for the BALB/c mice in the corresponding ratio (premature baby milk powder: goat milk powder = 2:1).\n\tNOTE: The final nutritional compositions of formula milk12 are shown in Table 1.\nLPS solution (2.5 mg/mL)\n\t\nDissolve a total of 10 mg of LPS powder in 4 mL of sterilized double-distilled water, mix well, and store in a refrigerator at -20 °C after aliquoting.\n\t\tNOTE: The LPS solution is stored in the dark at 2-8 °C for immediate use or at -20 °C for long-term storage.\n2. Induce necrotizing enterocolitis in neonatal BALB/c mice\nFeed the neonatal mice.\n\t\nKeep the neonatal mice in the same cage with the dam, nursed by the dam on Days 0-4.\nOn the night of Day 4 (when the neonatal mice weigh 2.5-3 g), separate the neonatal mice in the NEC group from the dam to induce NEC, keep them in an animal incubator, and feed them with formula. However, the Cont. group is allowed to stay with and be fed by the dam.\n\t\tNOTE: Neonatal mice that are separated from the dam must be raised in an incubator because of their weak body temperature regulation.",
    "Prepare the gavage tube by soaking it in 75% alcohol containers for 1-2 min and wash them twice in clean, double-distilled water.\n\tNOTE: To avoid cross-contamination among the mice, the above process must be performed after feeding each mouse.\nInduce the NEC model.\n\t\nTake the neonatal mice from the dam on Day 4 and fast them for one night.\nGavage the mice with LPS (20-30 µL at a time) and feed them with formula on Day 5 (40-50 µL at a time).\nFrom Day 5 onwards, subject the mice to a hypoxia-reoxygenation-cold-shock cycle twice a day for 5 days. Place the mice in a hypoxia device at 5% O2 for 90 s and reoxygenate them for 3 min; repeat this process five times. Next, place the mice in a 4 °C environment for 15 min and then transfer them to an incubator. See Figure 1A,B for the induction process.\n\t\tNOTE: A cycle of hypoxia-reoxygenation-cold stimulation was performed once in the morning and once in the afternoon. A mixture of 5% O2 with 95% N2 was prepared in the container, and the concentration was measured with an oxygen detector.\nClosely observe all the mice, weigh them every day, record the survival of the mice during the induction period, and record the stool characteristics (with or without sticky stools/bloody stools).\n\tNOTE: The established NEC model lasts for 5 days.\nOn Day 10 or earlier, when the mice show NEC symptoms (ileus, hematochezia, diarrhea)13, euthanize the mice by inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane, then immediately collect the intestinal tissue. Do not collect tissues from the mice that died spontaneously.\n\t​NOTE: In this study, the end-point of mouse euthenasia was adapted when the mouse displayed hematochezia and cyanosis of the whole body.\n3. Gavage the mouse",
    "Fix the mouse head, holding the gastric tube in the right hand. Insert the gastric tube from the left corner of the mouth of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: The head was fixed with the index finger on the mouse's head and gently pressed backward and downwards to prevent the mouse from bending forwards during the operation and affecting the insertion of the gastric tube.\nSlowly move the tube to the center of the mouth. After inserting the tube approximately 2-3 cm, push 40-50 µL of formula or 20-30 µL of LPS into the digestive tract. See Figure 2A,B for the gavage.\n\tNOTE: Under normal circumstances, the gastric tube is inserted into the digestive tract smoothly. If the mouse has a strong vomiting reflex, the gastric tube has been inserted into the trachea by mistake. The gastric tube must be pulled out gently and the mouse allowed to rest for a while before attempting gavage again. In addition, the gavage procedure is used to induce the model of NEC prior to euthanasia of mice.\n4. Collect fresh intestinal tissue specimens for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\nImmerse the fresh ileum tissue from the mouse in 10% formalin for 24 h.\nEmbed the tissues in paraffin and slice them into 4 µm sections.\nDeparaffinize the sections in xylene and rehydrate them successively in absolute ethanol, 95% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water, soaking for 5 min in each step. Stain the sections with hematoxylin solution for 5 min and differentiate them in 1% hydrochloric acid in 75% alcohol for 5 s. Finally, stain them with eosin solution for 1 min.",
    "NOTE: After staining with hematoxylin solution, it must be differentiated with 1% hydrochloric acid in ethanol to remove excessively bound hematoxylin solution and cytoplasmic hematoxylin dye. The concentration of 1% hydrochloric acid is suitable for intestinal tissue.\nExamine the histopathology of the intestinal tissue at 40x magnification.\nSubscription Required.
