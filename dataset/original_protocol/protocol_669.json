    "**Day 1: _In vivo_ formaldehyde cross-linking of samples**\n1. Place 2 grams of leaves in a 50 ml Falcon tube.\n  2. Rinse the leaves twice with 40 ml of nanopure water.\n  3. Add 37 ml of 1% formaldehyde solution \\(note: make sure leaves are submerged).\n  4. Put tube inside a desiccator and apply vacuum for 10 minutes \\(note: air bubbles should start forming on the leaf surface; gently tap the desiccator to occasionally remove air bubbles).\n  5. Slowly release vacuum after 10 minutes \\(note: leaves should appear translucent).\n  6. Add 2.5 ml of 2 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M glycine to stop cross-linking.\n  7. Apply vacuum for another 5 minutes and slowly release vacuum.\n  8. Rinse the leaves twice with 40 ml nanopure water.\n  9. Dry the leaves with paper towel to remove excess water.\n  10. Freeze cross-linked leaves in liquid nitrogen.\n  \n**Nuclei and chromatin isolation**\n\\(Note: keep samples cold all the time on ice)\n11. Grind leaves \\(~2 grams) into fine powder with liquid nitrogen in mortar and pestle.\n  12. Transfer ground powder into a 50 ml falcon tube and add 30 ml of extraction buffer 1 \\(note: add at least 10-fold volume of extraction buffer relative to the amount of ground samples) and vortex.\n  13. Filter through a layer of Miracloth into a new 50 ml falcon tube.\n  14. Centrifuge extract at 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4&#xB0;C.\n  15. Gently remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of extraction buffer 2 by pipetting up and down \\(note: the pellet should be completely resuspended).\n  16. Transfer the solution into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\n  17. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#xB0;C.",
    "18. Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 400 &#x3BC;l of extraction buffer 3 by pipetting up and down.\n  19. Add 400 &#x3BC;l of extraction buffer in a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and carefully layer the extract \\(400 &#x3BC;l) on the top of the buffer.\n  20. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4&#xB0;C.\n  21. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 500 &#x3BC;l of cold nuclei lysis buffer \\(note: include 10 mM sodium butyrate in the lysis buffer when analyzing histone acetylation).\n  22. Carefully resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down \\(note: keep the chromatin solution cold on ice).\n  23. Keep an aliquot \\(10 &#x3BC;l) of the chromatin solution for agarose gel electrophoresis in step 27 \\(note: examine the quality of the isolated chromatin before sonication).\n  Sonication\n24. Sonicate chromatin solution 4 times for 10 seconds \\(continuous) with power output setting at 10 using Fisher sonic 60 dismembrator \\(notes: to prevent from overheating the chromatin solution during sonication, return the solution on ice for at least 1 minute between each sonication; avoid foaming during sonication; chromatin solution can be stored at -20&#xB0;C after this step).\n  25. Centrifuge chromatin solution at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4&#xB0;C to remove debris.\n  26. Transfer supernatant into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\n  27. Take an aliquot \\(10 &#x3BC;l) of the sonicated chromatin solution for agarose gel electrophoresis with the aliquot from step 23 \\(notes: to determine sonication efficiency; DNA sizes should appear smear at a range of 200-bp to 1-kb range).\n  28. Keep another aliquot \\(30 &#x3BC;l) of sonicated chromatin for input DNA control \\(note: add 470 &#x3BC;l of TE buffer to this aliquot and continue with reverse crosslink in step 55). \n  \n**Immunoprecipitation**",
    "29. Split the remaining chromatin solution \\(450 &#x3BC;l) into 3 tubes with 150 &#x3BC;l each. Add 1,350 &#x3BC;l ChIP dilution buffer to each tube \\(note: to dilute SDS from 1% to 0.1% in the buffer).\n  30. For each tube from step 29, prepare a 40 &#x3BC;l of 50% salmon sperm DNA/ protein A agarose beads by rinsing three times with 1 ml of ChIP dilution buffer \\(without protease inhibitor or sodium butyrate) and resuspend the beads in 40 &#x3BC;l of ChIP dilution buffer \\(note: after each wash, spin down beads at 6,000 rpm for 2 minutes at 4&#xB0;C).\n  31. Incubate the chromatin solution \\(1.5 ml) with 40 &#x3BC;l of protein A agarose beads for 1 hour at 4&#xB0;C in a rotisserie shaker.\n  32. Centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 2 minutes at 4&#xB0;C to pellet beads from the chromatin solution.\n  33. Combine 3 aliquots of chromatin solution into a 14 ml falcon tube \\(note: avoid pipetting pellet protein A agarose beads).\n  34. For each chromatin IP, mix 600 &#x3BC;l pre-cleared chromatin solution with antibody in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube \\(notes: the amount of antibodies used varies among different sources and should be determined empirically; we used 10 &#x3BC;l anti-H3K9Ac, 5 &#x3BC;l anti-H3K9Me2, 5 &#x3BC;g anti-H3K4Me2 or 10 &#x3BC;l anti-CCA1 per IP).\n  35. Set up another chromatin solution \\(600 &#x3BC;l) without antibodies as a control for ChIP.\n  36. Incubate chromatin and antibodies overnight at 4&#xB0;C in a rotisserie shaker.\n  \n**Day 2: IP complexes pull down and washing**\n37. Prepare 40 &#x3BC;l of 50% salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose beads as in step 30.\n  38. Add 40 &#x3BC;l of protein A agarose beads to the ChIP tube and incubate for 1.5 hours at 4&#xB0;C in a rotisserie shaker \\(note: pull down the ChIP-complexes formed).",
    "39. Centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4&#xB0;C to collect ChIP-beads complexes, discard supernatant.\n  40. Add 1 ml of low salt buffer to ChIP-beads complexes.\n  41.

Add 1 ml of TE buffer to IP-beads complexes\n  48. Repeat steps 41 and 42\n  49. Repeat washing with TE buffer \\(steps 47 and 48), collect ChIP-beads complexes and discard supernatant.\n  50. Add 250 &#x3BC;l of elution buffer to elute ChIP complexes \\(note: prepare elution buffer prior washing steps and store it at 65&#xB0;C).\n  51. Vortex briefly and incubate the samples at 65&#xB0;C for 15 minutes.\n  52. Centrifuge the samples at 13,000 rpm for 2 minutes at room temperature.\n  53. Carefully transfer the supernatant \\(eluate) to a new 1.5 ml screw cap tube.\n  54. Repeat elution \\(steps 50 to 53) and combine the two eluates in a single tube.\n  \n**Reverse crosslink and DNA purification**\n55. Add 20 &#x3BC;l of 5 M NaCl to the eluate and reverse cross-link at 65&#xB0;C for at least 6 hours to overnight \\(note: also perform reverse-crosslink for input DNA control from step 28). \n  56. Add 10 &#x3BC;l of 0.5 M EDTA, 20 &#x3BC;l of 1 M Tris-HCl \\(pH6.5) and 1 &#x3BC;l of 20 mg/ml proteinase K.\n  57. Incubate at 45&#xB0;C for 1-3 hours.\n  58. Add 1 volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol \\(25:24:1).\n  59. Mix and centrifuge the samples at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.",
    "60. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol \\(24:1).\n  61. Mix and centrifuge the samples at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.\n  62. Carefully transfer supernatant to a new 2 ml microcentrifuge tube \\(note: avoid residue chloroform as it may affect PCR).\n  63. Add 0.1 of volume 3 M NaoAC \\(pH5.2) and 2 &#x3BC;l of glycoblue \\(15 mg/ml; Ambion) \\(note: the use of glycoblue increases the visibility and recovery of DNA precipitates).\n  64. Add 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol and precipitate DNA at -80&#xB0;C for 2 hours \\(note: alternatively, precipitate DNA at -20&#xB0;C overnight).\n  65. Centrifuge DNA at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4&#xB0;C.\n  66. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 ml of 75% ethanol \\(note: DNA pellet should appear blue with the use of glycoblue).\n  67. Centrifuge DNA at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4&#xB0;C.\n  68. Air-dry DNA pellet for 10 minutes \\(note: alternatively, dry DNA under vacuum for 3 minutes).\n  69.
