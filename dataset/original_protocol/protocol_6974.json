    "For this protocol, we used purified 6×His-tagged PII protein as the bait protein (ligand) and a Strep-tagged PirC protein (analyte), as described previously (Orthwein et al., 2021). It is recommended to use 5-25 µg/ml of ligand per well of a 96-well plate when loading the proteins onto the Ni-NTA biosensors. A purified ligand concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 500 µl at a minimum is needed to perform 50 measurements if 25 µg/ml is used in the assay. This provides an acceptable dilution of the kinetics buffer with a sufficient amount of protein. A minimum analyte molar concentration that is 5-times higher is needed.Note: It is possible to store your proteins in a buffer containing glycerol. An overview of the method: The ligand is loaded specifically onto the Ni-NTA sensor tips via the 6× His-tag tail (loading) followed by a washing step in kinetics buffer. The loaded tips are then dipped into the analyte solution to measure the complex formation (association), indicated by an increasing signal. Afterward, the sensors with the complex are dipped back into the kinetic buffer (decreased signal dissociation). Before and after the procedure, the sensors are washed and regenerated with an acidic 10 mM glycine solution (pH 1.7) and a 10 mM NiCl2 solution. The software calculates the response in equilibrium (Req) using the association and dissociation signal. The values of Req for each analyte concentration are plotted in a graph (Req against the analyte concentration), which is used for the determination of the kinetics parameters. For this purpose, the measurement is performed with different concentrations of the analyte to determine the KD and with different concentrations of the effector to determine the EC50. The Req values are then plotted against the related analyte concentrations.",
    "For EC50 determination, the values are transformed and the relative response is plotted against the log10 of the analyte. Afterward, kinetic analysis with a statistical software (e.g., GraphPad Prism) is performed for the calculation of the kinetic parameters.Bio-layer interferometry kinetic binding assayThe assay was performed using the FortéBio® Octet K2 System (Sartorius).Note: Make sure that other tags used for the analyte do not interact with poly histidine (possibly metalloproteins) or bind non-specifically to Ni-NTA. It is possible to use a His-tagged protein as an analyte after the cleavage removal of the tag; however, it is not recommended. Test this via trial loading experiments of the analyte onto the biosensor. If there is a signal, there is unspecific binding of the analyte. If there is non-specific binding of the analyte, it is recommended to load the remaining loading positions with a His-tagged protein that does not interact with the analyte. For triplicates, measure three times with newly prepared 96-well plates.Switch on the machine and prewarm the sample holder for a minimum of 30 min. Adjust the working temperature of choice.Note: We used 30 °C because of the growth temperature of cyanobacteria. Prepare the kinetics buffer, the sensor washing solution, i.e., 10 mM glycine pH 1.7 (adjust pH with HCl), and the regeneration solution, i.e., 10 mM NiCl2.Note: The optimal conditions for interaction depend on the proteins under study. A preliminary buffer screening test (e.g., different pH and salts) may be required to determine the optimal conditions for protein-protein interaction. We used the kinetics buffer described in the recipes section. Dilute the ligand in the kinetics buffer for the Ni-NTA sensor tip loading.Note: The optimal concentration of the ligand should be tested before the start of the kinetic protein-protein interaction assay. For this, perform a trial loading experiment with different ligand concentrations.",
    "The manufacturer protocol recommends a ligand concentration between 5-25 µg/ml. We used concentrations that did not exceed a binding signal of Δλ = 5 nm. Prepare a dilution series of 7 different concentrations of the analyte. Note: We recommend starting the dilution with ~10x the expected KD, as described in the manufacturer protocol.  Fill the vials of the 96-well plate with 200 µl of solutions as shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4152/bioprotoc-11-17-4152-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Define the assay as shown in Figure 3.Note: The time of the association and dissociation steps depends on the proteins under study. For kinetic investigation, we suggest determining the optimal association and dissociation times by performing preliminary assays using different association/dissociation times ranging between 2-10 min and using saturating concentrations of the analyte (~ 10× the expected KD).

Do this also if you did not prewarm your plates previous to the experiment. Determination of the EC50 of a small effector molecule (effector) that interferes in the protein-protein complexPrepare a dilution series of the investigated effector. Note: In the example, we used the 2-OG metabolite as it inhibits the PII-PirC complex. Prepare a dilution series of the effector without the analyte for the pre-washing step (to be used to fill the wells in column 3) and a dilution series that contains the analyte (constant amount of analyte in each dilution of the effector) for analyte binding (to be used to fill the wells in column 4). The analyte should be used in amounts enabling saturation of the ligand as determined from the previous kinetic data.  Fill the vials of the 96-well plate with 200 µl of solutions as shown in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4152/bioprotoc-11-17-4152-g004.jpgFigure 4.
