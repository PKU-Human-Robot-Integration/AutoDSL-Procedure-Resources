    "1. In vitro HAT assay\nBuffer preparation\n\tNOTE: See Table 1 for buffer recipes.\n\t\nPrepare 5x assay buffer and 6x Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and store at -20 °C. Aliquot SDS in 1 mL aliquots.\nPrepare 10x SDS gel running buffer and 10x TBST and store at room temperature.\nPrepare 1x transfer buffer and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: Check safety data sheet for all chemicals used in this protocol. SDS, DTT, and bromophenol blue are toxic and should not be ingested, inhaled, or exposed to the skin or eyes. Please see safety data sheet for proper handling procedures. Please use a chemical fume hood for handling dangerous chemicals.\nHAT reaction\n\tNOTE: Anacardic acid is a known p300 inhibitor3 and is used as an example to demonstrate how the HAT assay can identify novel p300 inhibitors. See Supplementary Protocol (Schematic 1) for a schematic of step 1.2.1.\n\t\nPrepare the following enzymatic reaction in a 0.2 mL PCR tube: 2 μL of 5x assay buffer, 1 μL of purified p300 (0.19 μg/μL ), 1 μL of anacardic acid (HATi) or DMSO control diluted in 1x assay buffer and 2 μL of autoclaved ddH2O. Pre-incubate this mixture for 10 min at room temperature. Then add 3 μL of 100 μM Acetyl-CoA and 1 μL of purified H3.1 (0.2 μg/μL) to the reaction.\nIncubate the complete reaction mixture at 30 °C for 1 h in a PCR thermal cycler.\nAdd 2-mercaptoethanol at a 1:10 ratio to the 6x SDS sample buffer.\nRemove samples from the PCR thermal cycler and add 2 µL of 6x SDS (with 2-mercaptoethanol added) to the reaction mix.\n\t\tCAUTION: 2-mercaptoethanol is toxic and should be used inside a chemical fume hood. Please see safety data sheet for proper handling.",
    "Heat samples at 95 °C for 5 min on a heat block and cool on ice. Store the samples at -20 or -80 °C or perform gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as detailed below.\nGel electrophoresis and immunoblotting\n\tNOTE: If unfamiliar with gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, see this standard procedure27 for additional details on how to perform steps 1.3.1-1.3.17. Additional information can be found here28,29,30,31,32,33.\n\t\nPipette 10 μL of samples (from step 1.2.5.) into the wells of a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Pipette 5 μL of protein ladder into one of the wells as a molecular weight reference. Run the gel at 120 V for 90 min using a gel tank.\nTransfer the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 V for 70 min using a transfer tank.\nRemove the membrane from the transfer apparatus and place it in a plastic container. Block the membrane by adding 1x TBST (containing 5% milk) to the container and gently shake for 1 h at room temperature.\nRemove the 1x TBST from step 1.3.3. Incubate the membrane overnight with selected site-specific acetyl antibodies (e.g., H3K18ac or H3K27ac primary antibodies at a 1:5,000 dilution in 1x TBST containing 5% milk) at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nRemove the primary antibody solution. Wash the membrane 2x with 1x TBST (no milk) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 15 min each wash.\nDilute the secondary antibody at 1:20,000 in 1x TBST (containing 5% milk) and incubate the membrane for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution. Wash the membrane 2x with 1x TBST (no milk) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 15 min each wash.",
    "Drain the 1x TBST from the membrane. Mix HRP substrate peroxide solution and HRP substrate luminol solution in a 1:1 ratio (1 mL of each) and pipette 2 mL of the combined solution to the membrane surface.\nIncubate the solution with the membrane for 5 min at room temperature.\nDrain excess chemiluminescent substrate from the membrane onto a paper towel and place the membrane in plastic wrap inside an x-ray cassette holder.\nMove to a dark room dedicated to x-ray film processing. Expose the membrane to an x-ray film by placing the film on top of the membrane and closing the cassette for 30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Time of contact between the film and membrane must be determined experimentally. Strong signals will need short exposures (seconds) and weaker signals may need longer exposures.\nRemove the x-ray film from the cassette and process the film by running it through an x-ray film processor. See the manufacturer manuals for specific instructions on how to process the x-ray film.\nRemove the membrane from the plastic wrap and wash it with ddH2O for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nIncubate the membrane with 0.2 M NaOH for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nWash the membrane with ddH2O for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nBlock the membrane by adding 1x TBST (containing 5% milk) to the container and gently shake for 1 h at room temperature.\nAdd the next primary antibody dilution (e.g., probe for H3K27ac if first antibody used was H3K18ac) and shake overnight at 4 °C. Repeat steps 1.3.4-1.3.17 until all antibody probes are completed.\n2. ChHAI assay\nIn vitro drug treatments and analysis of acetylated histones",
    "NOTE: A-485 is a potent and well characterized p300 HATi2,4 . This inhibitor will be utilized in the remaining assays due to its efficacy and specificity in cell culture. MS-275 (Entinostat)24 is an HDACi that markedly increases histone acetylation levels and is used to facilitate easier detection of acetylation probes with standard immunoblotting. See Supplementary Protocol (Schematic 2) for a schematic of the drug dilutions used in step 2.1.\n\t\nSeed 100,000 MCF-7 cells in a 12 well plate and allow cells to grow to 80-90% confluency in 1 mL of cell culture medium. Mark the wells for the following experimental design: well 1: DMSO control (reference point); well 2: A-485 (3 μM); well 3: A-485 (10 μM); well 4: MS-275 (3 μM); well 5: MS-275 (3 μM) + A-485 (3 μM); well 6: MS-275 (3 μM) + A-485 (10 μM).\n\t\tNOTE: For culturing MCF-7 cells, use complete DMEM media and allow cells to grow at 37 °C with 5% CO2. See Table 1 for complete DMEM recipe.\nAt 24 h after seeding, pipette 4 mL of complete DMEM media to a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Pipette 2 μL of MS-275 (6 mM in DMSO) to the 4 mL of medium for a final concentration of 3 μM MS-275.\nPipette 2 μL of DMSO to 4 mL of medium in a separate sterile 15 mL conical tube.\n\t\tCAUTION: Please check safety data sheet for proper handling of DMSO. Some glove types are not rated for handling DMSO.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from wells 4-6 and pipette 1 mL of 3 μM MS-275 in medium (step 2.1.2) to each well. Discard unused diluted MS-275.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from wells 1-3 and pipette 1 mL of diluted DMSO (step 2.1.3) to each well. Discard unused diluted DMSO.",
    "Return the cells to the incubator and incubate for 4 h to allow accumulation of acetylated histones in cells exposed to MS-275 (wells 4-6).\n\t\tNOTE: MS-275 is an HDACi and will cause histone hyperacetylation24. This 4 h pre-incubation is necessary to allow MS-275 to induce hyperacetylation before the addition of A-485, which reduces histone acetylation2,4.\nAfter 4 h of incubation with MS-275, prepare the following dilutions in separate sterile 1.5 mL tubes by pipetting: 1.0 μL of DMSO to 1 mL of DMEM media; 0.5 μL of DMSO and 0.5 μL A-485 (6 mM) to 1 mL of DMEM media; 0.5 μL of DMSO and 0.5 μL of A-485 (20 mM) to 1 mL of DMEM media; 0.5 μL of DMSO and 0.5 μL of MS-275 (6 mM) to 1 mL of DMEM media; 0.5 μL of A-485 (6 mM) and 0.5 μL of MS-275 (6 mM) to 1 mL of DMEM media; 0.5 μL of A-485 (20 mM) and 0.5 μL of MS-275 (6 mM) to 1 mL of DMEM media.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from wells 1-6 and pipette 1 mL of dilution 1 to well 1, dilution 2 to well 2, dilution 3 to well 3, dilution 4 to well 4, dilution 5 to well 5, and dilution 6 to well 6.\n\t\tNOTE: A general rule is to balance DMSO (solvent) content between experimental groups and not to exceed 0.1% DMSO content in cell culture to avoid cellular toxicity and changes in proliferation.\nReturn the cells to the incubator and culture for 20 h.\nAfter 20 h, aspirate the cell culture medium from wells 1-6.\nWash the cells by pipetting 1 mL of PBS to wells 1-6. Aspirate the PBS.",
    "Add 100 μL of 1x passive lysis buffer (see Table 1) to wells 1-6. Store cell culture plate (with samples in passive lysis buffer) at −80 °C overnight for freeze-thaw and lysis of cells.\n\t\tCAUTION: Please check safety data sheet for all chemicals before making buffers. CDTA can cause serious eye damage and irritation.\nThaw samples at room temperature with gentle shaking for 10 min. Transfer samples to separate 1.5 mL tubes and immediately place on ice.\nMeasure protein concentration of each sample. Protein concentration can be determined using several well-established protocols34.\nEquilibrate protein concentration between samples 1-6 (in an equal volume) using 1x passive lysis buffer to dilute, as necessary.\nAdd 2-mercaptoethanol at a 1:10 ratio to 6x SDS sample buffer.\nAdd 6x SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol to samples 1-6 to a final concentration of 1x SDS sample buffer.\nHeat samples at 95 °C for 5 min on a heat block and cool on ice. Samples can be stored at -20 °C or -80 °C until step 2.1.19.\nPipette a volume containing 30 μg of protein for samples 1-6 to the wells in a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Perform immunoblotting procedure according to protocol described in Protocol 1.\n3. ChIP-qPCR\nNOTE: The protocol below is described for inhibitors of p300 as an example.\nBuffer preparation\n\tNOTE: See Table 1 for buffer recipes. The general steps of the ChIP protocol (e.g. buffer recipes, wash times and centrifugation times) below are modified and adapted from the manufacturer’s recommendations of a commercially available kit (see Table of Materials) and from the literature35,36.\n\t\nPrepare ChIP dilution buffer, nuclei swelling buffer, low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer and TE buffer. Store at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare SDS lysis buffer, 10x glycine buffer and ChIP elution buffer. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tCAUTION: Please check safety data sheet for all chemicals before making buffers to ensure proper handling.\nDrug treatment\n\tNOTE: See Supplementary Protocol (Schematic 3) for a schematic of the drug dilutions used in step 3.2.\n\t\nSeed MCF-7 cells in two 15 cm culture dishes and grow cells to 90% confluency in 12 mL of the complete DMEM medium. Mark the dishes for the following experimental design: Dish 1: DMSO control (reference point); Dish 2: A-485 (3 μM).\n\t\tNOTE: For culturing MCF-7 cells, use complete DMEM media and grow at 37 °C with 5% CO2. See Table 1 for complete DMEM recipe.\nIn a sterile 15 mL conical tube, pipette 12 mL of DMEM media and pipette 6 μL of DMSO.
