    "Add 5 mL liquid LB media to a tube and add the appropriate antibiotic to the correct concentration (Ampicillin: 100 μg/mL).\nUse a sterile pipette tip, and select a single colony from the LB agar plate.\nDrop the pipette tip into the tube. Loosely cover the tube with the cap, and make sure it is not airtight.\nIncubate bacterial culture at 37°C in the shaking incubator.\nCheck the OD600 to measure the density of the culture until the OD600 value reaches 0.5.\nAdd 500 μL of the cell culture to 500 μL of 50% glycerol in a 2 mL screw-cap tube. Freeze the glycerol stock tube at −80°C.\nTake 500 μL of the cell culture to a new microcentrifuge tube, and label it as “-” and store in a 4 °C fridge.\nInduce the rest of the cell culture with the IPTG with a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Adjust the temperature to 16°C and incubate overnight (∼16 h).\nTake 500 μL of the cell culture to a new microcentrifuge tube, label it as “+”. Then analyze the sample before inducing (“-”) and after inducing (“+”) by SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPause Point: The glycerol stock can be stored at −80°C for up to 2–3 years.\nScale up the cell culture – day 3\nTiming: 1 day\nInoculate the glycerol stock of M2-1 with GFP tag into 500 mL LB media with antibiotics (Ampicillin: 100 μg/mL).

    "Cooldown the cell media to 16 °C for 1 h. Then induce the cells with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.5 mM at 16 °C overnight (∼16 h).\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,557 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nPurification of His-GFP tagged M2-1 using affinity column – day 4\nTiming: 3 h\nResuspend the cell pellets with the lysis buffer (20 mL lysis buffer per 1 L cell culture).\nLyse the cell using the Misonix Sonicator 3000. Process time: 15 min; time on: 3 s, time off: 3 s, amplitude: 30%.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 42,625 × g for 40 min at 4°C, and keep the supernatant.\nPrepare the gravity-based column with an appropriate amount of cobalt resin. Allow the storage buffer to drain.\nWash the beads with 2 CVs DI H2O.\nEquilibrate the beads with 2 CVs of lysis buffer, and allow the buffer to drain.\nAdd the supernatant sample to the column, mix, and incubate with mechanical rotation for 60 min at 4°C. Remember to save 50 μL supernatant for analysis by SDS-PAGE gel.\nCollect the sample lysate by gravity flow and save 50 μL flow-through samples for analysis by SDS-PAGE gel.\nWash the beads with 5 CVs of the wash buffer. Collect all the flow-through and save 50 μL samples for SDS-PAGE gel.\nRepeat the wash step with the high salt wash buffer. Collect all the flow-through, and save 50 μL samples for SDS-PAGE gel.\nAdd 3 CVs of elution buffer. Collect all the flow-through and save 50 μL samples for SDS-PAGE gel.\nDetect the flow-through samples from each step with SDS-PAGE gel. Pool together the samples containing target protein M2-1.",
    "Note: (For steps 28–31) After loading the lysate to the column, collect all the flow-through of each step, including washing and elution. Take 5∼10 μL from each flow-through sample for SDS-PAGE gel analysis.\nTEV cleavage of the His-GFP tag – day 5\nTiming: 16 h\nMake the fresh dialysis buffer. Ensure that in the dialysis buffer, the target protein is stable and soluble. Evaluate the compatibility of the dialysis buffer by mixing the purified proteins with the buffer (check whether white aggregates form).\nMix the TEV protease with the protease: target protein at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w), and seal the sample in the dialysis bag.\nDialyze against the dialysis buffer at 4°C overnight (∼16 h).\nAnalyze by the SDS-PAGE gel to check the TEV cleavage result.\nCritical: The TEV protease has activity in the pH range of 6–9. At pH lower than 5, the TEV protease is inactive.\nProtein purification with heparin column and size exclusion chromatography - day 6\nTiming: 1 h\nDilute the TEV cleavage target sample with heparin wash buffer A. Make sure that the final concentration of NaCl is lower than 150 mM.\nEquilibrate the column with 5–10 CVs of heparin wash buffer A.\nApply the sample to the heparin column.\nElute with 10–20 CVs using a step gradient from 5%–100% heparin wash buffer B buffer (monitored by UV absorption at A280 and A260).\nProtein purification with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) - day 6\nTiming: 2 h\nTest the buffer compatibility with the protein sample. Mix 10 μL gel filtration buffer with 10 μL protein sample, and centrifuge with 12,000 × g for 15 min. Check the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube to check if there are any precipitations.\nIf there is no precipitation, do the next step.",
    "If precipitation occurs, optimize the buffer components to make them compatible with the protein (i.e., change the pH, increase the concentration of salt).\nNote: We typically repeat step 41 by mixing a small volume (10 μL) of protein sample with an equal volume (10 μL) of different buffer solutions to identify a suitable buffer for the further purification step.\nUse Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL. Equilibrate the column with 1.5 CV of the Gel Filtration buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.4 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol).\nCentrifuge the sample with 12,000 × g for 15 min. Collect the supernatant and inject it into the column.\nRun the SEC program.\nTurn on the UV monitor at the wavelengths of 260 nm, 280 nm, and 488 nm (which can monitor the residual GFP tag).\nFlow rate: 0.5 mL/min.\nElute the column with 1.2 CV Gel Filtration buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol).\nSet up the 96-deep-well plate for collecting the flow-through with 0.5 mL for each well.\nCollect the fractions from the peak and run the SDS-PAGE gel to check the sample purity.\nCritical: The sample should be tested to see whether it is compatible with the gel filtration buffer as described in step 41.\nOptional: Several alternative assessment methods could provide more in-depth tests, such as (1) Prometheus (NanoTemper) monitors the intrinsic fluorescence signal of proteins as a measure of their folding states (https://nanotempertech.com/prometheus/[href=https://nanotempertech.com/prometheus/]) and (2) the solubility and stability screen of the sample using the crystallographic hanging or sitting drops methods. An example of a screen kit can be found here: https://hamptonresearch.com/product-Solubility-Stability-Screen-620.html[href=https://hamptonresearch.com/product-Solubility-Stability-Screen-620.html].\nCritical: The sample should be fully dissolved. Centrifuge or filter to remove the precipitations before loading it to the column.\nMicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) assay – day 7\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "The instrument we used is Monolith NT.115 Blue/Red. The NT.115 instrument has two detectors:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_453_12.csv\nNote: Before performing the MST assays, it is crucial to determine the specific equipment model to be used. The specific NT.115 model will determine which fluorophore label to use. Here, the model we used is NT.115 Blue/Red. Because we use the GFP as the fusion tag, and we noticed that even after the TEV cleavage, it has a trace amount of GFP left in the solution. To avoid the unwanted fluorescent signal of the trace mount free GFP in the sample, we limit the fluorophore labeling choices to cy5, NT-647(RED), or Alexa647. We chose to use the cy5 labeled RNA and operated in the red mode in this protocol but not the blue mode.\nNote: Sample preparation: The MST experiments are set up with one fluorescently labeled molecule, which is called the target. The target will be at a fixed concentration and mixed with various concentrations of the other non-fluorescent molecule called the ligand. Reaction buffers in which the target and ligand should be well behaved. The addition of 0.05% Tween 20 or other detergent is usually required to prevent sticking to the capillaries.\nPretest: The Pretest examines the fluorescence intensity, adsorption on the capillaries, variation, and sample aggregation of the fluorescent molecule.\nPlan Your Experiment\nName the Target (the fluorescent molecule): Cy5_SH13\nEnter the concentration of the stock solution of Target: 40 nM\nDescribe the assay buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20\nChoose Capillary: Monolith NT.115 capillary\nSystem settings, Excitation power: Auto-detect, MST Power: Medium\nTemperature Control: 22 °C\nInstructions\nFollow the on-screen instructions to prepare the samples Cy5_SH13\nFill 2 capillaries, and load the capillary tray, put the higher concentration in position1",

Make sure there are no aggregates that can be visualized.\nBinding Affinity Experiment: Setting up the concentration of the fluorescent-labeled target sample (e.g., Cy5 labeled single-strand RNA SH13), the ligand sample (e.g., M2-1 protein), the assay buffer, and the system settings, which including Excitation Power (Auto-detect) and MST Power (Medium).\nPlan your experiment\nName the Target (the fluorescent molecule): Cy5_SH13\nEnter the concentration of the stock solution of Target: 40 nM\nDescribe the assay buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20\nChoose Capillary: Monolith NT.115 capillary\nSystem settings, Excitation power: Auto-detect, MST Power: Medium\nName the Ligand: M2-1\nEnter the concentration of the stock solution of Ligand: 100 μM\nTemperature Control: 22 °C\nInstruments\nFollow the on-screen instructions to prepare your samples\nPrepare a serial dilution of the diluted ligand using the assay buffer\nMix the Target to each tube of ligand by pipetting\nFill the capillaries and load the capillary tray, put the higher concentration in position 1\nInsert the capillaries tray into the instrument, and click the button “Start Measurement”\nExamples\nPrepare the PCR tubes and label them from #1 to #16.\nPrepare 25 μL of the M2-1 at 2× concentration (e.g., for a final concentration of 1 mM, prepare the sample at a concentration of 2 mM)",
    "Note: At the first time of the test, the suitable concentration range of the ratio of M2-1: RNA is unknown. The range of the molar ratio for M2-1:RNA can be initially set up to 0.05–20. If too few or too many dose-response points are in a bound or unbound state, consider adjusting the M2-1 and RNA concentrations accordingly.\nAdd 10 μL of PBS-T into the PCR tubes #2–16.\nAdd 20 μL of M2-1 into PCR tube #1.\nGradient dilution from the PCR tube from #1 to #16. Transfer 10 μL of the sample M2-1 from tube #1 to tube #2 with low retention pipette tips and mix by pipetting up-and-down multiple times. Make sure no bubbles and transfer 10 μL to tube #3, and mix. Repeat the procedure for PCR tube #4-#16. Discard the extra 10 μL from the last tube #16\nAdd 10 μL of Cy5 labeled RNA to each tube (#1-#16) and mix by pipetting.\nPut the capillaries to each PCR tube, load the capillaries, and measure the samples. The recommended instrument setting is 40% LED/excitation power and 40% MST power (Medium setting).\nNote: It is recommended that MST is performed at “low,” “medium,” or “high” settings. The lowest setting that produces the expected thermophoresis signals should be chosen as the default setting for a specific sample.\nResults\nExamine the capillary scans for fluorescence intensity, adsorption, and variation\nExamine the MST trace for signs of aggregation\nClick the “Review” buttons for more details\nData analysis\nStart Affinity Analysis software.\nLoad raw data.\nChoose Fluorescence intensity, No fluorescence variation, No absorption, and No aggregates, No ligand-induced photobleaching rate changes. Make the signal/noise ratio is large enough to conclude binding.\nThe Kd can be determined using the Kd fit with the default setting.",
    "Generate Full Report will create a PDF report.\nUse the export menu to export the curves images.\nNote: Usually, at the first test, the concentration of M2-1 is 20 folds higher than the cy5-labeled RNA. Check the does response. If too few dose-response points are in a bound or unbound state, consider adjusting the M2-1 concentration range.\nGaMD simulations\nTiming: ∼8–10 days\nGaMD simulations were performed using the GPU version of AMBER18 (Case et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Miao et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). The simulation speed depends on various factors, including the system size, GPU power, etc. For the SH7 RNA binding to the M2-1 protein system with 187,013 atoms, the simulation speed obtained was ∼35–40 ns/day on NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. It took about a week to complete 300 ns simulations.\nSystem equilibration for GaMD production simulations\nRunning conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) using AMBER\nThe first step is to run energy minimization to relax the system and eliminate any steric clashes in the system using files downloaded from CHARMM-GUI.\nNext would be to run the equilibration for a minimum of 1 ns timescale to bring the system to an equilibrium using the default parameters provided by CHARMM-GUI.\nFinally, run cMD for at least 10 ns timescale to further equilibrate the system.\nRunning short cMD and GaMD equilibration using AMBER\nA template GaMD equilibration input file as provided here http://miao.compbio.ku.edu/GaMD/tutorial.html[href=http://miao.compbio.ku.edu/GaMD/tutorial.html] was used to run short cMD of 4 ns and GaMD equilibration of 40 ns with 2 fs timestep using GaMD implemented in GPU version of AMBER18 (Case et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nThe parameters were set as the following:\nnstlim = 22000000,\nirest = 0,\nntx = 1,\nigamd = 3, iE = 1, irest_gamd = 0,\nntcmd = 2000000, nteb = 20000000, ntave = 400000,\nntcmdprep = 800000, ntebprep = 800000,",
