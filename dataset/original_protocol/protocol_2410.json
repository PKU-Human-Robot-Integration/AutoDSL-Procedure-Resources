    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection, fixation, and de-vitellinization of syncytial Drosophila embryos\nTiming: 3–4 h\nPlace a fresh sucrose-agar plate smeared with fresh yeast paste on the mouth of a cage containing Canton-S flies.\nReplace the cage at 25°C and collect the sucrose-agar plate after 2.5 h.\nNote: The plate now contains embryos, the majority of which are in the syncytial blastoderm stages.\nPour deionized water into the plate and carefully with the help of a paint brush, dissolve the yeast, taking care not to break the sucrose-agar layer (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: This dislodges embryos and suspends them in the water-yeast solution.\nCarefully pour the contents of the plate into a cell strainer (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The water-yeast mixture passes through the strainer and the embryos remain in the strainer.\nWash the embryos multiple times with deionized water to get rid of any debris.\nPour 5–6 mL of 4% bleach into an empty 60 mm Petri plate. Immerse the cell strainer in bleach for 1–1.5 min such that the embryos are submerged, to remove the chorion, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D.\nNote: Fly embryos are encased in two semi-transparent membranes - an outer chorion and an inner vitelline envelope, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. These membranes need to be removed for this protocol.\nCritical: Avoid increased exposure to bleach as this may damage the embryos. Ensure that the bleach is fresh and unexposed to air and sunlight. Bleach loses its efficiency with time and exposure to air.",
    "To ensure the chorion has been removed, observe the embryos under a stereomicroscope, once before adding bleach and once after the embryos have been soaked in bleach for 1 min. Each embryo possesses a pair of protrusions on the anterior end called the dorsal appendages which are part of the chorion. Before bleaching, the dorsal appendages are intact, whereas after bleaching, they are shed off along with the chorion.\nWash the embryos thrice with deionized water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nDry them by placing the cell strainer on a piece of soft tissue.\nAdd 1 mL of n-heptane to a scintillation vial.\nCarefully, using a fine paint brush, swipe the embryos up from the walls of the strainer.\nTransfer them into the scintillation vial containing n-heptane.\nNote: The embryos sink to the bottom of the scintillation vial.\nAdd a 1: 1 mixture of 4% PFA and n-heptane (1 mL each) to the scintillation vial. 4% PFA and n-heptane are immiscible and separate into two phases - 4% PFA below and n-heptane above.\nCritical: The 4% PFA solution should be brought to room temperature before it is added to the scintillation vial to ensure efficient fixation.\nThe embryos come to rest at the interface of the two liquids, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F.\nPlace the scintillation vial on a rocker at room temperature for 25 min.\nCarefully remove and discard the 4% PFA (bottom) layer of the solution in the scintillation vial.\nRemove the n-heptane.\nAdd fresh n-heptane and incubate the embryos at 4°C for a minimum of 40 min.\nCut rectangular pieces of double-sided tape (∼ 6 cm long) and Whatman filter paper (∼ 6 cm long, and as wide as the double-sided tape).",
    "Remove the plastic covering from one side of the tape and stick the tape to a 60 mm Petri plate along its diameter, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G.\nTransfer the embryos and the n-heptane using a 200 μL pipette onto the filter paper rectangle.\nAllow the n-heptane to evaporate, leaving the embryos on the filter paper.\nRemove the plastic covering on the exposed surface of the tape.\nInvert the filter paper rectangle such that the embryos face downwards, and touch it lightly on the sticky surface of the tape. The embryos will get immobilized on the tape.\nPour enough 1× PBS into the Petri plate containing the immobilized embryos so as to submerge the embryos.\nPlace the Petri plate under a stereomicroscope.\nUsing a 1 mL insulin syringe needle, poke each embryo at one end of its long axis to rupture its vitelline envelope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nGive a slight push to each embryo with the needle to release it from its vitelline envelope as shown in the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: The vitelline envelope remains stuck to the tape and the embryo floats in the 1× PBS. Embryos still encased in the vitelline envelope glisten under the light of the stereomicroscope, and are easily distinguished from de-vitellinized embryos. In Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G, in the inset image, an asterisk marks the embryo that has been de-vitellinized whereas the others are not. If the embryos are soft and disintegrate when touched with the needle, please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] step 2.\nTransfer the de-vitellinized embryos in 1× PBS solution into a 0.6 mL microcentrifuge tube. Let the embryos settle at the bottom of the tube.\nWithout disturbing the embryos, remove the 1× PBS and add 300 μL 0.3% PBST to the tube.",

    "Add 300 μL of fresh 0.3% PBST to the tube.\nPlace the tube on a rocker at room temperature for 5 min. Repeat the wash step twice more for a total of 3 washes.\nDilute Alexa 488 phalloidin (1:100) and Alexa 568-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000) in 300 μL of 0.3% PBST.\nAllow the tube to stand so that the embryos settle at the bottom. Using a 200 μL pipette, remove the 0.3% PBST carefully without disturbing the embryos.\nAdd the secondary antibody/dye solution to the tube.\nWrap the microcentrifuge tube in aluminum foil to protect the fluorophores (conjugated to the antibody/dye) from photobleaching.\nIncubate the tube on a rocker at room temperature for 1 h.\nDuring the incubation step, thaw an aliquot of Mowiol-DABCO on ice.\nAllow the tube containing the embryos to stand so that the embryos settle at the bottom.

Using a 200 μL pipette, remove the 0.3% PBST carefully without disturbing the embryos.\nRepeat this wash step twice more for a total of 3 washes.\nAfter removing the 0.3% PBST from the final wash, add 100 μL of fresh 0.3% PBST to the tube.\nTransfer the solution with embryos onto a glass slide.\nDrain the excess 0.3% PBST by standing the slide on its side.\nSpace the embryos on the slide by gently pushing them apart from each other using a fine brush.",
    "Excess liquid can be drained out using a thin piece of Whatman filter paper by dabbing the paper lightly at the edges of each of the embryo(s).\nUsing a cut 1 mL pipette tip, add 2 drops of Mowiol-DABCO solution to the slide.\nCarefully place a 22 × 40 mm, #1.5 coverslip on the slide, while avoiding formation of air bubbles and ensuring that the Mowiol-DABCO solution covers the embryos.\nSeal the edges of the coverslip with transparent nail polish.\nProtect the slide from light by covering it with aluminum foil and allow the nail polish to set for 15 min at room temperature.\nStore the slide in an opaque box at 4°C and image them within 1–2 days of preparation to minimize the degradation of fluorophore signal.\nConfocal and super-resolution STED imaging to obtain high-resolution images of microvilli\nTiming: 3–4 h\nMount the slide on the stage of an inverted TCS SP8 3× microscope containing the super-resolution STED module (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) operated by the Leica LAS X software (version 3.5.3).\nLoad the 100×/1.4 NA oil immersion (refractive index 1.518) objective (Leica HC PL APO CS2-STED WHITE).\nSwitch to fluorescence mode and toggle to the rhodamine/RHOD (red) filter while looking through the eyepiece.\nMove the stage until an embryo becomes visible as an orange glow.\nUse the coarse and fine focus knobs to bring the surface of the embryo in focus.\nIdentify the mitotic stage of the syncytial division cycle based on the phospho-histone H3 label as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2047-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A) Syncytial Drosophila embryos imaged using an inverted confocal and STED microscope (left). The schematic of the syncytial nuclear cycle (right, magnified inset), showing an apical view and a sagittal view (rotated by 180° to show the apical side on top) at interphase and metaphase. Interphase embryos possess short furrows between cortical nuclei (blue) and long apical microvilli (black) whereas metaphase embryos have long furrows and fewer and shorter microvilli. The dashed line indicates the plane of the membrane shown in the top panel.\n(B) Grazing sections of confocal images showing the nuclei, labeled using both phospho-histone H3 (green) and Hoechst 33258 (blue), for each of the mitotic stages (interphase, prophase and metaphase). Cortical F-actin (red) is labeled using Alexa 568 phalloidin at different mitotic stages of a single nuclear division cycle 12. Scale bar: 5 μm.\nCritical: Hoechst 33258 cannot be used for labeling samples for super-resolution STED imaging as it might have a negative influence on image quality (background), especially with the 592 nm STED laser. Thus, for super-resolution STED imaging we have used phospho-histone H3 (green) only. We have shown nuclei co-labeled with phospho-histone H3 (green) and Hoechst 33258 (blue) using confocal microscopy in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, for each of the mitotic stages (interphase, prophase and metaphase). Interphase nuclei appear as rounded and smooth with non-punctate chromatin in Hoechst, however phospho-histone H3 does not label interphase nuclei at all. Prophase nuclei in both appear as round structures with partially condensed chromatin resembling puncta. Metaphase nuclei in both cease to be rounded and have fully condensed chromatin that appears as thick coiled strands.\nUse the laser settings shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for exciting fluorophores and detecting emitted light for confocal imaging to identify the nuclear staining at different cell cycle stages.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2047_8.csv",
