    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRetrovirus production\nTiming: 6 days\nThis section describes transfection of HEK293T cells to produce the retrovirus particles that contain the TCRα-SM construct or the control GFP construct. Sterile reagents and aseptic technique should be used throughout the procedure.\nNote: In vitro screening of TCRα-SM from the generated cDNA libraries revealed 5 variants of dominant-active salmonella-specific TCRα-SM: TCRα-SM1, TCRα-SM14, TCRα-SM16, TCRα-SM20, and TCRα-SM21 (Kalinina et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). All these five TCRα-SM variants were used for transduction of activated T cells for adoptive transfer experiments. This section describes production of retroviruses, individually containing these TCRα-SM constructs.\nThree days prior to transfection, thaw one vial of cryopreserved HEK293T cells in 37°C water bath.\nCritical: Use low-passage HEK293T cells (up to the 10th passage) to ensure the high transfection efficacy. Avoid passing HEK293T cells prior to transfection.\nSeed 1.0 × 106 HEK293T cells per a flask in 6 T25 flasks in 5 mL DMEM, supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. Grow cells in incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 to 60%–80% confluence.\nNote: Use only freshly cultured cells for transfection, avoiding cell passing.\nNote: One T25 flask of HEK293T cells is sufficient to produce 5 mL of control GFP virus or TCRα-SM virus, enough to transduce 3.0–18.0 × 106 activated mouse T cells. If more virus is required, this can be scaled up to T75 or T225.\nIn the day of transfection:",
    "In a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube mix 6 μg of pCL-Eco plasmid and 6 μg of MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM, add sterile ddH2O to the final volume 225 μL, and thoroughly mix by vortexing. Then add 25 μL of 2 M CaCL2 and mix by pipetting. Add 250 μL 2× HBS in a drop-wise manner by gentle agitation. Incubate the resulting mixture for 5 min at 20–22°C. Similarly, prepare the transfection mix of pCL-eco+ MigR1-PGK-GFP.\nCritical: Add 2× HBS buffer slowly by drops, gently but thoroughly mixing after each drop.\nNote: In this case, prepare 5 plasmids mixes of pCL-Eco with MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM1, MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM14, MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM16, MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM20, or MigR1-PGK-TCRa-SM21 and one plasmid mix of pCL-Eco + MigR1-PGK-GFP.\nNote: If more virus is required, transfect T75 or T225 HEK293T flasks, increasing proportionally the amount of plasmids, CaCL2, and 2× HBS to the final volume of the transfection mix 1.35 mL and 4.5 mL, respectively.\nRemove the growth medium from T25 flasks, add 5 mL of fresh DMEM for HEK293T (see step 2). Place the flask into a horizontal position to ensure all cells are covered with the medium.\nAdd one transfection mix (see step 3a) to an individual HEK293T flask in a drop-wise manner, gently agitate the medium to uniformly disturb the transfection mix.\nPlace HEK293T flasks into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n24 h post-transfection:\nCheck the transfection efficiency in the HEK293T flask, transfected with pCL-eco + MigR1-PGK-GFP (see step 3a) in a fluorescent microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/511-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Place HEK293T flasks into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n48 h post-transfection:\nCollect the growth medium from HEK293T flasks in individual 15 mL centrifuge tubes, and centrifuge 200 × g for 5 min to precipitate any residual cells. Filter the supernatant, containing viral particles into new sterile 15 mL tubes to obtain 5 mL of virus batch 1.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh DMEM (see step 2) to HEK293T flasks, place flasks into incubator for another 24 h.\n72 h post -transfection, repeat the step 5a to collect 5 mL of virus batch 2.\nCritical: In each step, working with HEK293T handle cells with care, avoiding rough medium flow or agitating to ensure cells remain adherent to a flask.\nPause Point: Supernatants with viral particles, collected in 48 and 72 h post-transfection (see steps 5a and 6; virus batch 1 and virus batch 2, respectively), can be frozen and stored at −70°C for at least 1 month without losing the transduction efficacy. Wrap the tube cap with parafilm before freezing.\nNote: When producing retroviruses from T75 or T225, aliquot virus batch 1 and virus batch 2 to 4 mL. Use one aliquot (4 mL) of virus batch 1 and virus batch 2 to transduce up to 18.0 × 106 activated mouse T cells. Store virus aliquots at −70°C, avoiding repeated freeze/thaw cycles.\nPreparation of cell suspensions\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes preparation of single-cell suspensions from the spleen and lymph nodes (LNs) of B10.D2(R101) mice. Sterile reagents and aseptic technique should be used throughout the procedure.\nNote: Prepare suspensions of the spleen and LNs cells 24 h prior to transduction, when using freshly collected virus batches (see steps 5 and 6), i.e., 24 h post-transfection of HEK293T cells.\nPreparation of cell suspensions:",
    "Isolate spleen, mesenteric, both inguinal and axillary LNs of a euthanized mouse. Place spleen and LNs in two individual Potter homogenizers, containing 3 mL 1× PBS.\nUsing conic pestle, gently squeeze cells from the organ stroma.\nFilter the resulting cell suspensions into individual 15 mL centrifuge tubes through a nylon filter (50 μm) to remove cell debris.\nCentrifuge cell suspensions 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant, resuspend LNs cell pellet in 3 mL 1× PBS.\nResuspend splenocytes pellet in 1× RBC Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen) and remove erythrocytes, following the manufacturer`s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-4333.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IDFYIFJCQyBMeXNpcyBCdWZmZXI=[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F00-4333.pdf&title=VGVjaG5pY2FsIERhdGEgU2hlZXQ6IDFYIFJCQyBMeXNpcyBCdWZmZXI=]).\nAfter erythrocytes lysis, resuspend splenocytes pellet in 3 mL 1× PBS.\nCombine resulting suspensions of LNs cells and splenocytes in one 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cells suspension 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 15 mL RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5×10−5 M 2- mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, and 10 μg/mL Ciprofloxacin.\nOptional: Homogenize the spleen and LNs in individual 40 mm Petri dishes in 3 mL 1× PBS, using a 2 mL syringe plunger. Resuspend the cell suspension by pipetting with a 1 mL pipette (5–10 times). Transfer the resulting cell suspension into 15 mL centrifuge tube through a nylon filter and proceed to the steps 7d–g.\nCaution: Gently squeeze cells from the spleen and LNs to avoid cell death.\nActivation of mouse T cells\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes generation of activated T cells by stimulation of the spleen and LNs cells of B10.D2(R101) mice with Concanavalin A (ConA) and recombinant mouse Interleukin-2 (IL-2).\nTransfer the entire cell suspension (see step 9) into a T75 flask.\nAdd 45 μL ConA (1.0 mg/mL) to the final concentration 3.0 μg/mL.",
    "Add 15 μL IL-2 (10,000 U/mL) to the final concentration 10.0 U/mL.\nGently agitate the flask to mix and uniformly disturb ConA and IL-2.\nPlace the flask into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nTransduction of activated mouse T cells\nTiming: 2 days + 3 days for transduced T cells expansion\nThis section describes retroviral transduction of activated T cells of B10.D2(R101) mice by two rounds of spinoculation with the virus, containing the target TCRα-SM construct or the GFP construct.\n24 h post-activation of mouse T cells, collect cells from the T75 flask into sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cell suspension 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 3 mL complete RPMI medium (see step 9).\nCount cells in Goryaev chamber or hemocytometer after trypan blue-eosin staining.\nNote: Trypan blue without eosin can be used as well. Use trypan blue-eosin staining to improve dead cells visualization in a light microscope.\nResuspend cells in complete RPMI medium (see step 9) to the final concentration 3.0 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 1 mL of cell suspension, containing 3.0 × 106 activated T cells in one well of a 6-well plate.",
    "Note: To generate control non-transduced T cells, transfer 3.0 × 106 activated T cells into a T75 flask in 10 mL complete RPMI medium. Add 15 μL ConA (1.0 mg/mL) to the final concentration 1.5 μg/mL and 10 μL IL-2 (10,000 U/mL) to the final concentration 10.0 U/mL, mix gently. Place the flask into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. Then add 5 mL complete RPMI medium, 7.5 μL ConA (1.0 mg/mL) to the final concentration 1.5 μg/mL and 5 μL IL-2 (10,000 U/mL) to the final concentration 10.0 U/mL, mix gently. Place the flask into incubator for 3 days. Use these non-transduced activated T cells as the negative control for in vivo adoptive transfer experiments.\nAdd 4 mL of virus batch 1 TCRα-SM or GFP (see step 5a) and 3 mL of complete RPMI medium (see step 9) to the final volume of 8 mL per well.\nNote: In this case, plate 1 mL of cell suspension (3.0 × 106 cells/well) into 6 wells. Add virus batch 1 TCRα-SM1, TCRα-SM14, TCRα-SM16, TCRα-SM20, TCRα-SM21, and GFP to each individual well.\nNote: When using frozen virus, thaw one aliquot of virus batch 1 (4 mL) and warm up on a water bath at 37°C before adding to activated T cells.\nIn each well, add 8 μL IL-2 (10,000 U/mL) to the final concentration 10.0 U/mL and 6.4 μL polybrene (10.0 mg/mL) to the final concentration 8.0 μg/mL. Mix gently but thoroughly by pipetting with a 1 mL pipette (2- 3 times).\nWrap the plate lid with parafilm and spinoculate plates 2,000 × g for 2 h at 22°C.\nNote: Ensure that plates are well-balanced. When using the second plate for balancing, fill the corresponding number of wells with 8 mL sterile PBS per a well.",
    "Resuspend cells with a 5 mL pipette (5–10 times) in each well.\nCritical: Thoroughly resuspend cells to avoid cell aggregation that increases cell death. Look through each well in a light microscope to ensure cells are well resuspended.\nPut the plate into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16–20 h.\nCollect all cells from each well in an individual 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube, using a 5 mL pipette.\nCentrifuge cells suspension 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 4 mL complete RPMI medium (see step 9) and seed all cells back into the corresponding well of the plate.\nAdd 4 mL of virus batch 2 TCRα-SM or GFP (see step 6) to each corresponding well to the final volume of 8 mL per well.\nNote: When using frozen virus, thaw one aliquot of virus batch 2 (see step 6) and warm up on a water bath at 37°C before adding to a well.\nRepeat steps 22–24.\nPut the plate into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2–4 h.\nRepeat steps 26 and 27.\nResuspend cells in 10 mL complete RPMI medium (see step 9).\nAdd 22.5 μL ConA (1.0 mg/mL) and 15 μL IL-2 (10,000 U/mL), mix gently but thoroughly by pipetting with a 5 mL pipette (2–3 times).\nTransfer all cell suspensions in individual T75 flasks, add 5 mL complete RPMI medium (see step 9) to the final volume 15 mL in each flask.\nNote: the final concentration of ConA and IL-2 is 1.5 μg/mL and 10.0 U/mL, respectively.\nPut the flasks into incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days.",
    "Critical: Control cell growth in a daily manner to avoid overgrowth. If required, add extra complete RPMI medium, supplemented with 1.5 μg/mL ConA and 10.0 U/mL IL-2. For possible issues concerning viability of transduced T cells, refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nEvaluation of transduction efficacy\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to evaluate the transduction efficacy using flow cytometry.\nCollect transduced T cells and non-transduced T cells into individual 15 mL centrifuge tubes (or 50 mL tubes, if extra medium were added to cultured T cells).\nCentrifuge cells suspension 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nGently resuspend transduced T cells in 5 mL sterile 1× PBS.\nCritical: Keep transduced T cells on ice before adoptive transfer to avoid cell death.\nCount cells in Goryaev chamber or hemocytometer after trypan blue-eosin staining.\nAliquot approximately 3.0 × 105 cells from each tube and transfer to round-bottom flow cytometry tubes.\nAdd 1 mL 1× PBS and centrifuge 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant, gently resuspend cells in 100 mL 1× PBS.\nAdd Fc block antibodies (0.1 μg per 105 cells), incubate cells for 10 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge tubes 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant, and gently resuspend cells in 100 mL 1× PBS.\nAdd anti-CD3 and anti-Va fluorescent antibodies, incubate cells 30–40 min at 4°C in dark.\nNote: Prior to the flow cytometry analysis, identify Va families, to which each TCRα belongs. Use the corresponding anti-Va antibodies to stain TCRα transduced T cells. In this case, stain TCRα-SM1 transduced T cells with anti-Va2 antibodies (TCRα-SM1 belongs to the Va2 family).\nNote: Use antibodies dilutions, recommended by the manufacturer. It is also possible to preliminary titrate each batch of antibodies to determine the working dilution.",
    "Critical: If TCRα belongs to the Va family, to which there are no commercially available antibodies, use the level of GFP expression in the GFP-transduced T cells as the reference to identify the transduction efficacy for TCRα-transduced T cells. In these case, TCRα-SM14 belongs to the Va3 family, TCRα-SM20 to the Va5 family, TCRα-SM16 and TCRα-SM21 to the Va16 family, for all of which there are no commercial antibodies.\nAdd 1 mL 1× PBS and centrifuge 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in 500 μL 1× PBS, add 10 μL PI (10.0 μg/mL) to all tubes.\nAnalyze on a flow cytometer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/511-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy for analysis of the transduction efficacy\n(A) Set 3 subsequent gates: gate lymphocytes by parameters SSC-A versus FSC-A (lymphocytes), then gate singlet cells by parameters FSC-H versus FSC-A (single cells), and gate live cells as Percp-Cy5.5neg on Percp-Cy5.5_Log histogram.\n(B) Set a dotplot CD3 versus Va2 for live singlet cells, gate CD3+ cells.\n(C) Set Va2_Log histogram for CD3+ live singlet cells, gate Va2+ cells.\n(D) Set FITC_Log histogram for CD3+ live singlet cells, gate FITC+ cells as GFP+ cells\nSet three subsequent gates as follows: side (SSC) versus forward (FSC) scatter to gate lymphocytes, then FSC-H versus FSC-A to gate singlets, and Percp-Cy5.5 negative cells to gate live cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The Percp-Cy5.5-A channel of BD FacsCanto II is used to detect PI fluorescence. Use log sales for SSC and fluorochromes. Collect 105 cells from the lymphocyte gate to analyze the transduction efficacy.\nset CD3 versus Va2 dotplot for non-transduced T cells and TCRα-SM1 transduced T cells and gate CD3+ cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "set Va2 histogram for CD3+ cells and gate Va2+ cells to evaluate percent of Va2+ T cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Subtract the percentage of Va2+ cells in the population of non-transduced T cells from the percentage of Va2+ cells in the population of TCRα -SM1 transduced T cells to evaluate the transduction efficacy. In this case, the transduction efficacy for TCRa-SM1 transduced T cells is 81.4–11.0 = 71.4% (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nTo evaluate the transduction efficacy in the population of GFP-transduced T cells, set FITC histogram for CD3+ live singlet cells and gate FITC+ cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). In this case, the transduction efficacy for GFP-transduced T cells is 70.1%.\nNote: The transduction efficacy for TCRa-SM1 and GFP correlate well, thus, GFP transduction efficacy can be correctly used to assess the transduction efficacy for T cells modified with TCRα, for which there are no available antibodies. The transduction efficacy can vary from 40% to 70%.\nAdoptive transfer of transduced T cells\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of animals used in the adoptive transfer experiment)\nThis section describes how to perform intravenous adoptive transfer (via the retro-orbital sinus) of transduced and control (non-transduced) activated T cells to mice.\nNote: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of transduced T cells, perform adoptive transfer on day 3 post-infection of mice with virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. To evaluate the prophylactic potential of transduced T cells, perform adoptive transfer 3 days prior to infection of mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/511-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schemes of the adoptive transfer experiments\nCalculate concentration of TCRa-SM transduced T cells as follows:\nCtransduced cells = Ctotal × Transduction coefficient,",
    "where Ctransduced cells is the concentration of transduced T cells (×106/mL); Ctotal is the total concentration of cells in the corresponding tube (×106/mL) as counted in step 40; transduction coefficient is the transduction efficacy as measured in step 49c,d, divided by 100.\nExample: Calculation of TCRa-SM1 transduced T cells concentration\nConcentration of cells in the corresponding tube (Ctotal), 5.0 × 106/mL (counted in step 40)\nTransduction efficacy for TCRa-SM1, 71.4% (see step 498c)\nTransduction coefficient, 71.4/100 = 0.714\nConcentration of TCRa-SM1 transduced T cells (Ctransduced cells) = 5.0 × 0.714 = 3.57 × 106/mL\nPrepare the mix of TCRa-SM transduced T cells to the final dose 3.0 × 105 transduced cells per mouse in 200 μL 1× PBS. In this case, aliquot and mix 1.5 × 105 transduced TCRa-SM16 cells and 1.5 × 105 transduced TCRa-SM21 cells to the final volume 200 μL per mouse for therapeutic adoptive transfer. Aliquot and mix 1.0 × 105 transduced TCRa-SM1, TCRa-SM14, and TCRa-SM20 each to the final volume 200 μL per mouse for prophylactic adoptive transfer.\nNote: The total dose of adoptively transferred T cells will amount 3.0 × 105/Transduction coefficient per mouse (see step 50). In this case, the total dose of T cells will be 3.0 × 105/0.714 = 4.2 × 105 cell per mouse.",
    "Critical: 2 or more types of TCRa-SM transduced T cells must be used simultaneously for adoptive transfer to achieve therapeutic (or prophylactic) effect. Never exceed the total dose of adoptively transferred transduced T cells (all types together) above 3.0 × 105 cells/mouse to avoid toxic side-effects of activated T cells in vivo (cytokine storm, immunosuppression). Our data showed that adoptive transfer of 3.0 × 107 transduced T cells/mouse, followed by infection on day 7 post-adoptive transfer resulted by day 9 post-infection in increased mice mortality, 2–3 log increase in salmonella burden, and splenomegaly with destructive changes in mice injected with either non-transduced or transduced T lymphocytes comparing to mice without the adoptive transfer.\nAliquot non-transduced T cells to the final dose of 3.0 × 105/Transduction coefficient per mouse in 200 μL 1× PBS. In this case, the total dose of non-transduced T cells will be 3.0 × 105/0.7 = 4.2 × 105 cell per mouse.\nNote: Prepare the master mix of non-transduced T cells or TCRa-SM transduced T cells for an intended number of mice (N). In this case, for 5 mice mix 10.7 × 105 of total TCRa-SM16 cells and 10.7 × 105 of total TCRa-SM21 cells (i.e., 1.5 × 105 transduced TCRa cells × 5/Transduction coefficient) in 1.0 mL 1× PBS for therapeutic adoptive transfer. For prophylactic adoptive transfer to 5 mice, mix 7.1 × 105 of total TCRa-SM1, TCRa-SM14, TCRa-SM20 cells each (i.e., 1.0 × 105 transduced TCRa cells × 5/Transduction coefficient) in 1.0 mL 1× PBS.\nCritical: Prepare master mix for N+2 mice to consider any technical losses during the adoptive transfer procedure.",
    "Critical: Do not use TCRa-SM transduced T cells for adoptive transfer if the transduction efficacy is below 50% to reduce non-transduced cells burden. This will ensure the high specific therapeutic effect of TCRa-SM transduced T cells while reducing non-specific action of non-transduced T cells.\nUsing an insulin syringe, transfer 200 μL of cell suspension into a mouse through the retro-orbital sinus (Hedrich et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nNote: Thoroughly mix cells before sampling an aliquot. Keep cell suspensions on ice throughout the adoptive transfer procedure to ensure cells viability.\nOptional: Cells can be injected via a tail vein without affecting the overall efficacy of adoptive transfer therapy.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles in a syringe while injecting cells into mice. Large air bubbles can cause air embolism and occasionally mouse death.\nPreparation of fresh cultures of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes preparation of freshly grown cultures of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulent strain IE 147, subsequently used for infection of mice.\nThaw one vial of cryopreserved S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain IE 147 in 37°C water bath.\nTransfer bacterial cells in 5 mL LB broth and incubate in a thermostatic shaker at 185 rpm at 37°C for 18 h.\nPrepare 7 serial 10x dilutions of bacterial culture in sterile 1× PBS as follows: 900 μL PBS + 100 μL of bacterial cells.\nNote: Keep freshly grown bacterial cells in LB broth at 4°C prior to infecting mice.\nSeed 500 μL of bacterial cells from 10−6 and 10−7 dilutions onto individual Petri dishes with SS agar.\nPut Petri dishes into incubator at 37°C for 12 h.\nCount a number of colonies on each Petri dish and calculate the concentration of salmonella in LB broth (CFU/mL).",
    "Aliquot 4–6 × 106 CFU of bacterial cells and dilute in sterile 1× PBS to the final volume 200 μL per mouse.\nNote: Prepare the master mix of bacterial cells for N+2 mice to consider any technical losses during infection procedure.\nCritical: 4–6 × 106 CFU/mouse corresponds to LD27 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain IE 147 for B10.D2(R101) mice. When using other virulent strains and/or other mice lines, determine LD50 for each concrete experimental model and use LD20–LD30 to infect mice for adoptive transfer experiments.\nInfection of mice with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\nTiming: 1–1.5 h (depending on the number of animals used in the adoptive transfer experiment)\nThis section describes how to perform per os (intragastric) infection of mice with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulent strain IE 147 (Hedrich et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nUsing a syringe with a blunt 22G gavage needle, slowly administer per os 200 μL suspension of bacterial cells to a mouse.\nNote: For a therapeutic adoptive transfer experiment, infect mice 3 days prior to adoptive transfer of T cells. For a prophylactic adoptive transfer experiment, infect mice 3 days post-adoptive transfer of T cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: Similarly, infect mice without the adoptive transfer of either transduced or non-transduced T cells. Use this group of mice as the background control.\nEvaluation of bacterial loads in infected mice\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes how to evaluate the number of bacterial colony forming units (CFU) in the spleen of mice, infected with salmonella.\nEuthanize mice on day 7 post-infection and aseptically isolate the spleen.\nNote: The therapeutic adoptive transfer experiment lasts for 7 days, the prophylactic adoptive transfer for 10 days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPrepare homogenates from each spleen individually using the SilentCrusher M homogenizer in 1 mL sterile 1× PBS.",
    "Prepare one 10× dilution of the resulted spleen homogenate in 1 mL sterile 1× PBS as follows: 900 μL PBS + 100 μL of cell suspension.\nSeed 500 μL of the diluted spleen homogenates onto individual Petri dishes with SS agar.\nNote: Keep the rest of undiluted spleen homogenates at 4°C.\nPut Petri dishes into incubator at 37°C for 18–24 h.\nCount a number of bacterial colonies on each Petri dish, calculate bacterial CFU per spleen.\nNote: For possible issues concerning the evaluation of bacterial loads, refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7])."
