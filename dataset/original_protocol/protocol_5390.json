    "Prior to Day of Experimentation Carbon fiber electrode preparation (Figure 1)Using a house vacuum line, suction a single carbon fiber (approximately 12 cm long) into a capillary tube (Figures 1A-1D). Hold one end of the carbon fiber down with a finger to prevent it from being suctioned into the vacuum line (Figure 1C).Note: Separating carbon fibers over a piece of white paper can assist in visualizing individual fibers, as it is important to aspirate only a single carbon fiber into the capillary tube. Load the carbon fiber-filled capillary tube into a vertical microelectrode puller, with the midpoint positioned in the center of the heating element (Figure 1E). Once the two electrodes have been pulled from the single capillary tube, use scissors to cut the carbon fiber connecting the two halves (Figure 1F).Notes:It may be helpful to mark the glass capillary tube at its midpoint with a permanent marker prior to pulling. The marked midpoint is placed in the center of the heating element, thus creating two carbon fiber electrodes of equivalent length. Settings for the microelectrode puller vary from lab to lab. Our laboratory uses the following settings: 89.1 main-magnet; 20.9 sub-magnet; 54.2 heater. Ideal settings allow the pulled glass to fuse tightly with the carbon fiber at the tip while being sturdy enough to resist cracking near the glass-carbon fiber interface (typically settings that yield a taper length of approximately 0.75 cm are optimal). Trial and error testing may be necessary to determine the best settings for individual pullers. Under a light microscope with a reticle at 10x magnification (Figures 1G-1K), use a scalpel to trim the carbon fiber at the tip of the carbon fiber electrode to a desired length.Note: Our laboratory uses a carbon fiber tip length of approximately 30-100 μm.",
    "Optimal length may vary between labs depending on the sensitivity of individual setups.Apply a layer of Silver Print II to a stainless steel conductive wire and thread it into the carbon fiber electrode (Figures 1L-1N). Allow the paint to dry in an open, ventilated area (such as a fume hood) for at least 12 h before use (Figure 1O).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232606_7568.jpgFigure 1. Production of carbon fiber electrodes (CFEs). A. Cut a bundle of carbon fiber to a slightly longer length than a capillary tube. B. Marking the center point of a capillary tube is helpful for placement into the gravity electrode puller (see Figure 1E). C. While wearing gloves, isolate a single carbon fiber, and gently restrain one end of the fiber with a finger. D. Affix a capillary tube in the house vacuum line (blue arrow), and, while holding one end of the carbon fiber, suction the other end of the carbon fiber (black arrow) into the capillary tube. E. Load the capillary tube containing a single carbon fiber into the gravity electrode puller, and position the center point of the capillary tube in the heating element (red arrow). F. Upon completion of electrode pulling, cut the carbon fiber (black arrow) connecting the two electrodes (blue arrows) with scissors, to create two CFEs. G. Using a light microscope with a reticle and a 10x objective, position the CFE on a slide with the tip touching the glass slide (a small piece of putty may be used to prop the CFE in the correct position). H. Use a scalpel blade to cut the carbon fiber to the appropriate length. I. The uncut CFE is shown under the 10x objective. The interface between the glass and the carbon fiber is shown at the green arrow. J.",
    "Use a scalpel blade to cut the CFE to appropriate length (30-100 μm). It is very helpful to make sure the tip of the razor blade is against the slide glass and visible in the microscope for more accurate cutting (pink arrow indicates blade tip). K. CFE shown after cutting the carbon fiber, shown with glass interface indicated by the green arrow. L-N. Insertion of a stainless steel conductive wire coated with Silver Print II into CFE. L.

Completed CFEs should be left in a fume hood to dry for at least 12 h prior to use; store in a plastic box with foam to hold the CFE, as shown. Other preparationsPreparation of ACSF and Krebs solutionsPrepare 10x Krebs solution (see Recipes) and stir on a stir plate (with a stir bar) until all the solutes are dissolved (at least 1 h).Note: Our laboratory makes a 1 L stock solution of Krebs, which is kept at 4 °C for a maximum of 1 month. Prior to the day of experimentation, prepare 500 ml of ACSF. Pour 75 ml of ACSF into a 150 ml plastic beaker, and 250 ml of ASCF into a 500 ml plastic bottle. Place the plastic beaker and bottle into a -20 °C freezer. This frozen portion of ACSF will maintain ACSF used on the day of experiment at an ice-cold temperature (slicing at a cold temperature improves the health of tissue).Note: On the day of slicing, fresh ACSF will be prepared and added to the plastic bottle containing frozen ACSF to be oxygenated and used for slicing (described below).",
    "After slicing, return the bottle and beaker half filled with to the freezer for subsequent experiments. Day of Experimentation Setting upPrepare fresh ACSF solution and aliquot to the approximate volumes noted below: 200 ml into the bottle containing frozen ACSF (described above), to be used for slice preparation (referred to as bottle 1a).500 ml into a cylinder for each FSCV rig, to be used during experiment (additional ACSF may be needed for longer experiments) (referred to as cylinder 1b).200 ml into a storage beaker with netted wells to retain extra slices, to be oxygenated and maintained at room temperature (referred to as storage beaker).Oxygenate prepared ACSF (a-c listed above) by turning on the gas regulator of the carbogen tank, and place a gas dispersion tube into each container. Oxygen should flow continuously, and a steady stream of bubbles should be observed.Note: Take care not to over-oxygenate, which has the appearance of vigorous or rolling bubbles. Place the vibratome stage and brain matrix (Figure 1A) in the freezer at -20 °C, and add a fresh blade to the vibratome; set the thickness and slicing speed (mouse–speed 0.46 mm/sec and thickness 300 μm; rat–speed 0.60 mm/sec and thickness 400 μm).Prepare the FSCV rigs by adding deionized water to fill the bottom portion of the recording dish.Note: Ensure that water is covering the heater coil to prevent melting of tubing. Flow oxygenated ACSF from cylinder 1b into the slice well at 1 ml/min by using a peristaltic pump or gravity flow with a Control-A-Flo Regulator.Turn on the following equipment: (1) temperature controller TC-344C, set to 32 °C in the recording dish; (2) Current Stimulus Isolator, output set to 1 mA; (3) Chem-Clamp; (4) light source, and (5) microscope (visualized in Figures 3A-3B).",
    "Draw fluid from the recording dish’s outflow tubing using a syringe, which will allow fluid to start flowing out of the dish and into the waste bottle.Note: Throughout experimentation, outflow needs to be maintained. This can be particularly troublesome with new tubing, which may require the outflow to be reestablished several times throughout the day. Before brain extraction, add ~50 ml of the cold, oxygenated ACSF from bottle 1a to cylinder 1b containing frozen ACSF. This will be used for transporting the brain to the vibratome.Brain extraction (refer to Papouin and Haydon [2018] for further details)Add isoflurane to an induction chamber, and allow the gas to disburse throughout the chamber (2-3 min for mice; 5-10 min for rats.).Deeply anesthetize the rodent in the induction chamber, followed by immediate decapitation.Note: It is important to make sure the animal is still breathing (at a depressed rate) prior to decapitation. In our laboratory, rat and mouse decapitation occurs via guillotine. Expose the skull by making a midline incision (caudal to rostral) with scissors; pull the skin laterally to visualize the suture lines of the skull.Use rongeurs (for rats) or small scissors (for mice) to carefully remove the skull to expose the dorsal surface of the brain.Peel away surface blood vessels and meninges.Carefully run a spatula under the brain to free it from any cranial nerves.Once free, completely submerge the brain in cylinder 1b containing frozen and fresh ACSF.Brain slicingUse forceps to transfer the brain from cylinder 1b to the brain matrix, arranging the brain ventral side up. Use a plastic pipette to transfer chilled, oxygenated ACSF (approximately 2 ml) to the brain matrix. Note: The brain does not have to be fully submerged at this step.",
    "Addition of ACSF onto the brain while it is in the matrix will help straighten the brain and prevent it from sticking to the surface of the matrix.  While still covered in paper, snap a Personna double-edged blade into two single edge blades. Place a single edge blade at the desired location(s) in the matrix to remove excess brain tissue (referred to below as blocking) (Figure 2A). Note: When our group isolates slices containing the nucleus accumbens, we block caudally at the level of the hindbrain to remove the cerebellum, and block rostrally to remove the olfactory bulb and early prefrontal cortex. Take care not to block off too much tissue, preserving the desired area of interest.  Place a small amount (approximately one drop) of Loctite® 404TM glue onto the stage, and use forceps to transfer the brain from the matrix to the stage. Quickly position the caudal side of the brain onto the glue (Figure 2B).Note: Be careful not to use too much glue. Overuse of glue can cause the brain to detach from the stage when ACSF is added, which will result in poor slicing conditions. Carefully push a single edge blade down the midline (dorsal to ventral) to hemisect the brain.Place the stage onto the vibratome, and fill the stage with ice-cold, oxygenated ACSF (from bottle 1a) to submerge the brain.Note: Avoid pouring ACSF directly onto the brain, as this could cause the brain to detach from the stage. Lower the blade into the ACSF solution, and set the slicing window to at least 1 mm beyond the dorsal and ventral ends of the brain; slice the brain at the suggested settings listed above.Using a transfer pipette or a spatula, transfer slices to slice wells of the recording dish (Figure 2C).",
    "Note: Extra slices can be stored in the storage beaker (Figure 2F), for up to 6 h. This storage beaker should be filled with ACSF, with continuous oxygen flow via gas dispersion tube. If needing to transfer a slice from the storage beaker to a slice well (in a recording dish), use Step C8 as noted above. Please refer to Papouin and Haydon (2018) to create the storage beaker (nest beaker).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232632_3152.jpgFigure 2. Brain slicing (mouse shown). A. Using a brain matrix, block the brain at the appropriate rostral (red arrow) and caudal (blue arrow) locations using single edge blades. B. Adhere the brain rostral side up onto the stage, hemisect, and submerge the brain in cold, oxygenated ACSF. C. Using spatula or transfer pipette (not shown), carefully transfer brain slice to recording dish (nucleus accumbens (NAc) shown in purple). D. Secure the brain slice using platinum weights, placed distally from region of interest. E. Place bipolar stimulating electrode and carbon fiber electrode in the region of interest (NAc shown). F. Diagram of storage beaker containing oxygenated ACSF with netted wells to retain slices (O2 refers to carbogen that is flowed into the beaker via a gas dispersion tube). Setup of FSCV equipmentTo weigh down the brain slice, place platinum wires at the edges of the slice distant from the recording location (Figure 2D).Note: Typical equipment setup for FSCV is shown in Figure 3. Place the cover onto the recording dish, and fully submerge the Ag/AgCl reference electrode pellet into ACSF solution. Use alligator clips to connect the reference electrode and the carbon fiber electrode to the headstage (Figure 3D).Prior to beginning experimentation, use an insulin syringe 28 Gauge to carefully remove any bubbles that have formed under the netting of the slice well.",
    "Note: It may be necessary to remove bubbles during experimentation if they affect the signal (see Note 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232658_4582.jpgFigure 3.

Standard settings are shown in (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232715_3177.jpgFigure 4. Demon Voltammetry setup for dopamine detection. A. User Interface showing typical experimental settings with ideal current-voltage plot from an electrode (red box). For carbon fiber electrode conditioning, the CV freq (blue box) may be increased from 10 Hz to 60 Hz. B. Command Voltage settings. Switching potential can be adjusted as needed (red box; see Note 4). C. Stimulation settings for single pulse experiments (frequency is not used for single pulses). Frequency and pulse number (red box) can be adjusted as needed for multipulse experiments (see Note 5).Electrode conditioning (for new electrodes only)Using a micromanipulator, lower the carbon fiber electrode to submerge the carbon fiber tip into ACSF (do not lower the carbon fiber electrode into the brain). Turn on the CV, and repeatedly scan at a frequency of 60 Hz for at least 20 min. After the above conditioning step, turn off the CV and change the frequency to 10 Hz (the working cyclic voltammetry frequency for FSCV).",
    "Note: Electrodes can be used 2-4 times, and this conditioning step is only required for the first use. If the electrode is not new, start at the working cyclic voltammetry frequency of 10 Hz and skip to collecting dopamine signals. The conditioning step allows stabilization of new electrodes to occur quicker. Collecting dopamine signalsUsing a micromanipulator, lower the carbon fiber electrode approximately 75 µm (visual estimation) into the brain region of interest.Lower the bipolar stimulating electrode (using a micromanipulator) onto the surface of the slice, 100-200 µm from the carbon fiber electrode (Figure 1E).Note: A common early mistake is puncturing the surface of the slice when lowering the stimulating electrode. It is helpful to slowly lower the stimulating electrode until the surface of the slice dimples. When the dimpling effect occurs, slightly elevate the stimulating electrode to ensure it rests on top of the slice surface. Name the collection files and set the save folder.Set the number of collection files to 1, and uncheck the “Wait” button. The file name can be set to “default” for this step, or renamed. A few electrode placements may be needed in order to achieve an optimal signal (depicted in Figure 4).When trying to achieve an optimal signal, it is better for slice health to move the carbon fiber electrode rather than the stimulating electrode (which, due to size, can damage the tissue).Once a reasonable dopamine signal is obtained (optimally greater than 3 nA for rat slices and greater than 7 nA for mouse slices; Figure 5), set the desired number of collection files. Set the collection interval to either 180 sec (for single pulse experiments) or 300 sec (for multi-pulse experiments). Click the Collect button to begin collecting dopamine signals.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232742_7326.jpgFigure 5. Ideal dopamine signal. A.",
    "An ideal signal of stimulated dopamine as observed in the Demon collection window. B and C. The same signal in the Demon Analysis window, showing (B) the dopamine signal (cyclic voltammogram inset showing oxidation and reduction peaks), and (C) associated color plot, showing the oxidation peak (blue arrow) and reduction peak (black arrow) of dopamine.Stop the collection after 30-40 min of collecting baseline signals (at least 10 collections with a 180 sec interstimulus interval or at least 8 collections with a 300 sec interstimulus interval). Click the Analyze button, and check the last three signals to see if collections have stabilized (amplitude varying less than 10% between collections, and not all increasing or decreasing. For example, if the last three collections have amplitudes of 9.8 nA, 10.2 nA, and 10.5 nA, the dopamine signal is not stable. If the collections were 9.8 nA, 10.2 nA, and 9.7 nA, the signal is stable, and the experimenter can move on to Step G7).Note: Do not let the slice sit without regular stimulation at the selected interstimulus interval, or else the signal will need to be restabilized. After stability, a pharmacological agent of interest can be added to the ACSF cylinder. Change the collection name, and collect for a minimal of 30 min to allow the pharmacological agent to reach maximal effect.Note: A pharmacological agent can be added at cumulative doses to create a concentration-response curve. Once the curve is complete at the desired concentrations, the experiment has ended, and the slice is no longer usable for other experimentation. Upon completion of experimentation, turn off the CV button. Disconnect the carbon fiber electrode and the stimulating electrode from the headstage.Move the carbon fiber electrode to the calibration system to determine the electrode’s sensitivity to dopamine.",
    "Note: It is best practice to perform calibration at the end of each experiment, or prior to using the electrode for another experiment. Even if the same electrode is used for two experiments, sensitivity to dopamine can change due to fouling of the electrode. Calibration of carbon fiber electrode (Figure 6)Dilute dopamine in ACSF to a known concentration of dopamine (our laboratory uses 3 μM), and fill a 5 ml syringe with the diluted dopamine solution. Fill a 30 ml syringe with ACSF solution, and place it on a single syringe infusion pump. Open the Demon Voltammetry software and use the same settings as listed above, except change the collection interval to 0 sec and number of files to 5.Reconnect the carbon fiber electrode and reference electrode to the same headstage as the performed experiment. Run ACSF through the calibration system using the single syringe infusion pump, and lower the carbon fiber electrode into the ACSF solution (Figure 6A).Turn on the CV button (electrode signal shape should appear the same as during experimentation), and start the collection. Allow ACSF to flow for 5 sec, and then apply a consistent flow of the diluted dopamine solution for the next 5 sec, followed by ACSF solution. Continue for each additional collection.Note: Dopamine signal should have an approximately square-shaped peak (Figure 6B). Analyze calibration collections to ensure the dopamine signals are stable (not trending in one direction). If the dopamine current continued to increase or decrease, repeat Step H6 to collect additional calibration data. Once the dopamine signals are stable, average all of the dopamine currents (nA) collected. Divide the average current by the concentration of the dopamine solution used for calibration (3 μM) in order to determine the calibration factor (nA/μM).",
    "Note: If any collection amplitudes vary drastically from other collections, exclude it and average accordingly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180926/20180926232817_2696.jpgFigure 6. Electrode Calibration. A. Electrode calibration system. A pump is used to drive ACSF through a T connector with stopcock (blue arrow). Electrodes are lowered into the ACSF droplet (red arrow), and electrodes and reference wire (black arrow) are connected to the headstage. B. Ideal calibration curve showing a square shape with fast kinetics. C. Non-ideal calibration curve obtained from a “slow” electrode that has been overused. Lipids and proteins can adhere to and foul the surface of the carbon fiber following repeated usages. This slows the kinetics of dopamine detection, resulting in sloping–rather than square–calibration curves (red arrows indicate regions of slowed kinetics).Clean upFlow a 70% Ethanol solution through each recording dish for 10 min at an increased flow rate (e.g., 2 ml/min). Repeat with 3% hydrogen peroxide, then distilled water.If using a peristaltic pump, allow air to flow through the line until all liquid has been displaced from the tubing. If using a gravity flow system, set the Control-A-Flo Regulator to the “prime” function, and use a syringe to push air through the tubing to clear out any residual liquid.Empty used ACSF into an appropriate waste container."
