    "The presentation of this protocol follows ethical guidelines at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and written authorization was obtained from the patient.\n1. Application of the Second Generation TTFields Device\nNOTE: The system consists of the portable electric field generator, transducer arrays, a connection cable and box, a rechargeable battery, charger for portable batteries, and a plug in power supply.\nTreatment planning procedure\nAcquire MRI images of the patient’s brain. The MRI scan includes the margins of the scalp for treatment planning. Incomplete delineation of the full thickness of the scalp interferes with the electric field calculations.\nUsing axial T1 sequence MRI scans and the tools on the DICOM image viewer, take baseline measurements of the front to back, right to left, and right to midline based on axial view head size (mm). Measure the superior to tentorium, right to left, and right to midline based on coronal view head size (mm).\nFocusing on the primary lesion, measure the front to back without nose, right to left, right to midline, right to close tumor margin, right to far tumor margin, front to close tumor margin, and front to far tumor margin based on axial view tumor size (mm). Measure the superior to tentorium, right to left, right to midline, right to close tumor margin, right to far tumor margin, superior to close tumor margin, and superior to far tumor margin based on coronal view tumor size (mm).\nOpen treatment planning software, enter username and password, and select new patient transducer array.\nEnter in the measurements taken above, and click Generate Transducer Array Placement. Save the transducer array layout for future use on patient visit.\nApplying transducer arrays to scalp",
    "Prepare the scalp for transducer array placement by cutting hair and shaving hair stubbles with an electric razor down to the surface of the scalp until no hair remains. Avoid using a razor with blade(s) to prevent cuts on the scalp.\nWipe the scalp with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nRemove the transducer arrays from plastic packaging and begin planning placement upon the scalp according to the predetermined specific array layout scheme (see section 1.1). Locate the surgical scar and avoid placing transducer arrays upon scar.\nIf the scar is located under a predetermined transducer array, then shift the four array placements 2 cm clockwise or counterclockwise.\nDetermine the desired location of the connection wires as preferred by the patient (either right or left side of the body). Apply the transducer array that is nearest to the surgical scar first, while positioning the connection wire to the preferred side.\nApply the next transducer array to either the right lateral or the left lateral in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion, keeping the location of the connection wire consistent. Apply the third and fourth transducer arrays in the same clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.\nPlace gauze strips underneath the metallic interface in between the array and the connection wire. Use silk tape to hold the gauze strip in place.\nBraid the four connection wires together and fasten with silk tape. Place fishnet retainer over the head in order to hold the arrays in place.\nAssembling the TTFields device system\nConnect each of the four white and black color-coded connection wires to a corresponding white or black port on the connection box, making sure each audibly snaps into place.\nIf using the portable battery, connect the battery charger to a wall outlet and switch the power button on in order to initially charge the battery.",
    "Insert charged battery into the electric field generator by plugging it in through its connector to a socket labeled DC IN on the front panel of the device. Make sure the arrows on the battery connector face up towards the DC IN label.\nIf not using the portable battery, plug the electric field generator into a wall outlet.\nTurn on the power button located at the bottom of electric field generator to start the device. Switch on the TTFields button located at the top of the electric field generator. The patient may experience a warm sensation.\nTo achieve an optimal response, Have patient use TTFields therapy on a continuous basis for a minimum compliance of 75%, or 18 h a day. Treatment duration of less than 18 hour per day has been associated with suboptimal results.\nExchange of transducer arrays \nNOTE: Array exchange procedures in this section are repeated every 3 to 4 days.\n\t\nUse baby oil to remove adhesive from skin. Pull off arrays by applying slow and even tension with both hands.\nWash scalp with gentle shampoo. Check scalp for dermatitis, erosions, ulcers, or infection. Apply anti-septic ointment as needed.\n\t\t\nIf ulcers or infections are present, discontinue treatment until ulcer heals or infection clears.\nShave off regrown hair.\nClean scalp with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Reapply the transducer arrays (see section 1.2).\n2. Removal of Systemic Agents that May Interfere with Anti-tumor Iimmunity\nLowering or discontinuation of dexamethasone\nNOTE: Dexamethasone is a synthetic fluorinated glucocorticoid that has anti-inflammatory effects in humans by impairing cell-mediated immunity.\n\t\nWean dexamethasone in a stepwise fashion due to its hysteresis effect.\nApply trimethopreme-sulfamethaxazole (400–80 mg single-strength tablet daily or 800–160 mg double-strength tablets three times per week) to prevent the development of pneumocystic pneumonia during the weaning process.",
    "Cut the dose half quickly every 7–10 days to achieve a daily dose of 4 mg/day. If the patient is already at 4 mg/day or lower the dose, cut the dosage slower, at a rate of every 10 to 14 days until discontinuation.\nLook for signs of adrenal suppression (i.e., lethargy, cold intolerance, weakness and hypersomnia). If signs of unacceptable neurologic deficits and/or adrenal suppression appear, the previous dose of dexamethasone is re-applied.\nNOTE: Other means for reduction of dexamethasone are being sought (see concurrent bevacizumab administration).\nConcurrent bevacizumab administration\nNOTE: Bevacizumab is a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal IgG1 antibody. The antibody has a potent antiangiogenic effect by sequestering VEGF, rendering it unable to bind to the cognate receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and to exert its proangiogenic effect. Immature blood vessels also have high permeability and elimination of these newly generated vasculature within the glioblastoma microenvironment also helps to reduce cerebral edema. Bevacizumab has a long half-life of about 20 days28 and therefore it can be administered to patients every 2 to 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. The indication for bevacizumab is to obviate the prolonged use of dexamethasone.\n\t\nExclude bevacizumab from patient who had recent hemorrhage (either intracranial or extracranial), myocardial infarction or stroke, major surgery (including craniotomy) within 4 weeks, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy or lactation. Exercise caution in patients with chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, bleeding disorder, uncontrolled angina, cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, prior chest wall irradiation, prior anthracycline exposure or other concurrent illness deemed unfit by the treating physician.\nBefore treatment, make sure the patient has acceptable blood counts, kidney function, normal blood pressure and urine dipstick protein <100 mg/dL.",
    "Once the patient is deemed to be an acceptable candidate, administer bevacizumab at a dose of 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg. There is class 2 evidence that bevacizumab at doses of <10 mg/kg work as well as 10 mg/kg29,30. Start TTFields treatment either before or after initiation of bevacizumab.\nInfuse the initial dose of bevacizumab over 60 min in 100 cc of normal saline. If there is no adverse event, administer subsequent doses over 30 min.\nOther systemic immunosuppressive agents to avoid\nNOTE: There are a number of anti-cancer drugs that also have significant immunosuppressive properties. They are listed below.\nTo avoid everolimus, which is an mTOR inhibitor.\nNOTE: Everolimus is approved to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, advanced hormone-receptor-positive, Her2-negative breast cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and renal cell carcinoma. However, the addition of everolimus has been shown definitively in a randomized study to hasten the death of glioblastoma patients, most likely by impairing their anti-tumor cell-mediated immunity31. It is also used to prevent rejection of transplant organ recipients.\nAvoid Sirolimus, which is also known as rapamycin.\nNOTE: Temsirolimus is a pro-drug that can be metabolized to sirolimus. It is an mTOR inhibitor with immunologic interference properties similar to everolimus. It is also used to prevent rejection of transplant organ recipients."
