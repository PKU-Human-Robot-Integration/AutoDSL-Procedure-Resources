    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of mPDAC cells for orthotopic transplantation\nTiming: 1 h\nAll cell culture procedures should be done in sterile conditions.\nOne day before orthotopic transplantation, seed the mPDAC luciferase expressing cells at a density of 5 × 106 cells in a T-75 tissue culture flask and add 15 mL PDAC culture medium. This will ensure that the cells are in the log phase of their growth and are critical for successful transplantation. Grow cells in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nOn the day of surgery, harvest the PDAC cells by adding 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution to T-75 tissue culture flask and incubate for 5 min at 37°C. Make sure the culture media containing 10% FBS is completely removed, and the cells are washed twice with PBS before adding trypsin-EDTA solution.\nStop the trypsin activity by adding 8 mL of cell culture media containing 10% FBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the residual media by gentle tapping. Wash the cells three times with 15 mL sterile PBS to remove any residual FBS.\nNote: Any FBS contamination in cells can initiate an immune response in mice and can reduce the efficiency of orthotopic transplantation.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C after every PBS wash.\nCount the cells using hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nAfter cell counting, resuspend the cells at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/mL and aliquot 50 μL in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes.\nThaw the Matrigel overnight at 4°C.",
    "Note: Matrigel takes at least 4–5 h to thaw. Keeping it at 4°C overnight is a preferred method to save some critical time on the day of surgery. Matrigel should always be kept on ice until used for injection.\nMix the cells and Matrigel at 1:1 ratio (50 μL cells and 50 μL Matrigel) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic presentation of major steps of orthotopic transplantation of PDAC cell lines into mouse pancreas\nOn the day of the transplantation, mouse PDAC cells are harvested, washed, counted, and resuspended to obtain a desirable concentration. Cells are mixed with Matrigel in equal ratios and 20 μL of the mix is injected into the pancreas of the recipient mouse.\nNote: Mix cells and Matrigel just before the surgery to avoid solidification of Matrigel in the syringe. If the mix is solidified, do not attempt to forcefully inject the mix.\nSurgery\nTiming: 1 h\nSet up the surgical table with all the surgical instruments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Picture showing the setup of the surgical area required for orthotopic PDAC cell transplantation in mice\nSurgery table is equipped with a heating pad, light source, isoflurane delivery system, ventilation tubes, gas scavenger, Hamilton syringe for injection, and surgical instruments. Surgical instruments include a needle holder, a scalpel, scissors, forceps, and skin clamps.\nPerform the surgery in a sterile location such as bio-bubble (bioBUBBLE Inc., custom made soft-wall containment environment) to avoid any potential infection in mice.\nStart by cleaning the work area with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nPrepare the surgery area by placing a heating pad which is covered with a clean drape.\nAnaesthetize either male or female C57BL/6 mouse (aged 4–6 weeks) in an induction chamber of an isoflurane vaporizer set at 2%–3% flow rate of 0.8–1.0 liter/min.\nBefore starting the surgery:",
    "Apply eye ointment to prevent the animal’s eyes from drying out during surgery and recovery.\nCheck for the absence of the withdrawal reflex on a foot pinch to ensure successful anesthetization of mice.\nClean the surgical area with betadine.\nMake sure to use sterilized surgery tools.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad to maintain a constant body temperature of 37°C during the surgery.\nShave a 4 × 4-cm2 portion of the left side of the abdomen. Alternatively, the mice can be shaved a day earlier to expedite the surgery (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Steps followed for successful surgery and orthotopic transplantation of PDAC cells into the pancreas of mice\n(A) Shave a 4 × 4-cm2 portion of the left side of the mouse abdomen. (B) Cleaning of surgical area. (C) Expose the pancreas along with the spleen using a blunt end tweezer. (D) Inject mPDAC-luc cells slowly into the tail of the pancreas using a Hamilton syringe. (E) Suture the peritoneal membrane using sterile 6-0 (polyglactin 910) absorbable suture. (F) Close the the outer skin with 2–3 surgical clips.\nSterilize the shaved region by applying betadine solution and then followed by 70% ethanol wipes to remove the betadine stain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nMake an incision at splenic silhouette, located just below the rib cage and gently expose the pancreas along with the spleen using a blunt end tweezer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInject twenty microliters of mPDAC-luc cells (5 × 105 cells) mixed with Matrigel (refer to step 10 for mixing of cells and Matrigel) using a Hamilton syringe.\nInject mPDAC-luc cells slowly into the tail of the pancreas using a Hamilton syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "After injecting, wait for approximately 30 sec to let the Matrigel to solidify to avoid any leakage before pulling out the syringe. Then gently push the spleen and pancreas into the peritoneal cavity with the help of a surgical probe.\nSuture the peritoneal membrane using sterile 6-0 (polyglactin 910) absorbable suture (Vicryl) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nClip the outer skin with 2–3 surgical clips (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nCritical: It is important that the animals be closely monitored by the researchers while induction of anesthesia, to allow for appropriate removal of the animals from the induction chamber to prevent over-anesthetization and death.\nInject mice subcutaneously with buprenorphine at a concentration of 0.05 mg/kg weight subcutaneously.\nNote: if the animal looks dehydrated, inject 100 μL saline solution subcutaneously.\nImage animals by bioluminescence (IVIS Spectrum, PerkinElmer) 2 days after surgery to assess proper implantation of the tumors (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Bioluminescence image showing presence of PDAC cells in the mouse pancreas on day 2 after orthotopic transplantation\nTumor digestion and ILC2 enrichment\nTiming: 2 days\nThis part of the protocol describes the isolation of ILC2s from the orthotopic PDAC tumors.\nTwenty-six days after tumor transplantation, euthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation, isolate the pancreas, and dissect the tumor (Figure 1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nNote: keep the dissected tumor in RPMI or MEM media with 10% FBS on ice before the digestion.\nDigesting the tumor:\nPlace the PDAC tumor measuring up to 10 cm in diameter in a Petri dish and add 1 mL of prepared digestion buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nUse a surgical blade to mince and homogenize the tumor.\nNote: We found it works best to hold the surgical blade with hemostat scissors.\nAdd more digestion buffer (according to the size of the tumor) and collect into a 50 mL tube.\nNotes:",
    "We add at least 2.862 mL of digestion buffer to tumor weighing less than 1 g and add 5-10 mL digestion buffer if the tumor is more than 1 g.\nWe recommend bevel cutting the end of a 1 mL pipette tip for easier collection of the minced tumor.\nIncubate the digested cell suspension at 37°C in water bath for 30 min.\nNote: You could also incubate it at 37°C in a rotor at a speed of 6 rpm for 30 min to further enhance the digestion.\nAfter incubation, add 15 mL RPMI media and keep the tube on ice for 10 min to stop the digestion.\nFilter the digested tumor with 70 μm cell strainer:\nUsing the back end of the plunger of a 10 cc syringe (BD) gently grind the digested tumor in a circular motion.\nKeep adding culture media (RPMI + 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL Streptomycin) while doing this step to increase the cell viability and avoiding over digestion.\nWash the cell suspension with 5 mL wash buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL Streptomycin + 1 mM EDTA) three times followed by centrifugation at 300 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nResuspend cells after washing in 10 mL of wash buffer.\nAlternatives: Prepare single-cell suspension using the mouse tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat No. 130-096-730) according to manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/tumor-dissociation-kit-mouse.html].\nIsolate immune cells using a Ficoll-PaqueTM column:\nPrepare the Ficoll column by adding 4 mL of Ficoll plaque (density 1.077 g/mL) to 15 mL tubes, followed by the PDAC tumor cell suspension in the ratio of 1:2 (Ficoll: Cell suspension) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: To avoid mixing of Ficoll and tumor cell suspension, gently add cells to the Ficoll column at a 45-degree angle.",
    "Note: Two separate layers can be visualized if there is good transfer of tumor cell suspension to the Ficoll Column.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 400 × g at 4°C.\nCollect the interface between 2–6 mL of graduated tubes, consisting of tumor infiltrating leucocytes.\nWash the cells 3 times with wash buffer (see step 24g) by centrifugation at 300 × g, 4°C for 5 min.\nCritical: Avoid mixing of Ficoll and tumor cell suspension, otherwise the immune cell fraction will not be separated. Washing after Ficoll column separation is critical to avoid any residual Ficoll which can reduce the efficiency of ILC2 enrichment. Count the cells and prepare the adequate concentration which is equivalent to 1 × 108 Cells/ mL for ILC2 enrichment as per manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.stemcell.com/products/easyseptm-mouse-ilc2-enrichment-kit.html].\nEnrich ILC2s using an enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Cat No. 19842) as follows.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic showing Ficoll column preparation and separation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from PDAC\nApproximately 1 × 108 cells/mL are taken in a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube (Cat. No. 38007).\nAdd 50 μL/mL of the ILC2 enrichment cocktail to the tube. Mix and incubate the mixture for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nMeanwhile, vortex the Streptavidin Rapidspheres for 30 s. The Rapidspheres particle should appear evenly dispersed. Then add 75 μL /mL of the Rapidspheres to the sample and incubate for 5 min.\nAfter incubation add 2.5 mL of the RPMI 1640 media to the sample and mix by pipetting up and down 2–3 times.\nPlace the sample mix into the magnet and incubate for 3 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPick up the magnet, and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube, pouring the enriched cell suspension into a new 14 mL tube.\nRepeat steps d-f. Then combine with poured-off fraction from step f.",
    "Isolated cells are ready for use.\nCulture the enriched ILC2s in 10 cm culture plate in 10 mL ILC2 culture media (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) containing 10 ng/mL IL-2 and IL-7 overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNext day, transfer the cells to 15 mL conical tube and collect the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Wash the ILC2 cells with PBS three times with centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The ILC2 are now ready for DiD dye labeling for adoptive transfer.\nAdoptive transfer and characterization of ILC2s\nTiming: ∼17 days\nThis part of the protocol describes the adoptive transfer of the tumor- derived ILC2s to PDAC-bearing syngeneic recipient mice.\nEstablish orthotopically transplanted tumors as described above (see sections preparation of mPDAC cells for orthotopic transplantation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] and surgery[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]) in a new group of mice. These mice will be the recipients of the adoptive transfer. We wait a period of 10 days after injecting the tumor cells before we initiate the adoptive transfer of ILC2.\nBefore the adoptive transfer, label the ILC2 cells with a lipid binding DiD′ solid (1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-Tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-Chlorobenzene sulfonate Salt (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) [Invitrogen, Cat No. D7757] other source is specified in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) dye:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1844-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Histogram showing DiD labeled ILC2 compared to unlabeled cells via flow cytometry analysis\nThe plot is overlay plot of control vs DiD stained ILC2 cells. The red pick indicates the unstained and the blue indicate stained ILC2 cells.\nPrepare 20 mM DiD stock solution by dissolving DiD dye in DMSO and store at −20°C.\nLabel 1 × 106 ILC2 cells with DiD dye at a concentration of 5 μM working solution for 10 min in 1 mL PBS at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Wash DiD labeled ILC2 with wash buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL Streptomycin+ 1 mM EDTA) and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat the washing step two times for a total of three washings.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL PBS and wash cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend DiD labeled ILC2 cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in 1 mL PBS.\nDeliver 100 μL/1 × 105 of labeled ILC2 cells in PBS via retro – orbital injection into recipient mice.\nAfter 7 days, harvest the tumor and repeat steps (24–29) from Section: tumor digestion and ILC2 enrichment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], to digest the tumor and isolate ILC2s.\nAnalyze ILC2 by flow cytometry using the APC channel to detect DiD-labeled ILC2."
