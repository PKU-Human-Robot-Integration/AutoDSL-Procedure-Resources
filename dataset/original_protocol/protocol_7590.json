    "Gene cloning β-glucuronidase (Bgus) from Thermotoga maritima and α-xylosidase (Xyls) from Sulfolobus solfataricus were cloned into pET-28a(+) vector between NheI/XhoI sites in frame with the N-terminal 6x-His tag by GenScript (see supplemental file S1).Cell transformation Thaw BL21DE3 competent cells on ice (50 μL aliquot for each plasmid).Add 20 ng of each plasmid to the competent cells (mix by swirling the pipette tip three times).Incubate cells in ice for 30 min.Heat shock the cells at 42 °C for 30 s.Incubate on ice again for 5 min. Critical:  This step is required to obtain high efficiency of transformation.Add 950 μL of SOC medium (at room temperature) and incubate at 37 °C for 60 min with shaking at 350 rpm in a thermomixer.For each sample, spread 50 μL from each tube onto LB agar plates with Kanamycin (use plating beads or spreader).Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 16 h.Purification of Bgus and Xyls Pick a single colony from each plate and inoculate 20 mL of LB medium (with Kanamycin, 50 μg/mL). Incubate at 37 °C for 16 h with shaking at 200 rpm.Use 10 mL of the overnight culture to inoculate 1 L of LB medium (with Kanamycin, 50 μg/mL). Incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Keep checking the OD600.Once the OD600 reaches 0.6, add 1 mM IPTG (1.6 mL from a 600 mM stock solution) to the culture to induce gene expression and incubate at 16 °C for 16 h with shaking at 200 rpm.Centrifuge the cells at 5,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Store the cell pellets at -80 °C until ready for the purification step. Pause point:  Cell pellets can be stored long term if necessary.Dissolve the cell pellets in lysis buffer (20 mL of buffer per liter of starting culture).",
    "Store the cells at -80 °C overnight to allow ice crystals to form; this step aids in cell lysis.Thaw the cells at room temperature for purification.Add nuclease at 6.25 kU (5 μL) concentration and sonicate cells for 5 s (power 4–5) four times with 10 s intervals at 4 °C.Centrifuge cells at 15,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Place supernatant into a new tube.Place the supernatant into a 75 °C water bath for 10 min. Critical:  This step is essential to enrich the thermophilic enzymes.Spin cells at 15,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. Transfer supernatant to fresh tube. This is the cell extract.Note: Perform steps C13–C17 in a cold room. Prepare 2 TALON superflow metal affinity columns, one for each enzyme, by packing 3 mL of resin into a Econo-Column chromatography column and equilibrating with 10 mL of wash buffer 1.Apply the cell extract obtained in step C12 to the column three times. Each time, incubate the column with the extract for 15–20 min on a gentle rocking platform. Save all flowthroughs.Wash the column with 10 mL of wash buffer 1 three times. Save all washes.Wash the column with high salt wash buffer to remove nonspecific interactions. Save the wash.Elute the bound proteins with 3 mL elution buffer in five fractions.Run 100 μL of each saved wash, flowthrough, and elution on an SDS-PAGE gel and visualize with Coomassie blue.Combine the relevant fractions (usually 1 and 2, see Figure 1) and buffer exchange with PBS pH 7.4 using a 30 kD Amicon concentrator. Use a total dilution factor of 200 and bring the total volume down to 1 mL. Confirm pH is approximately 7.4 with strips.Aliquot the combined fractions into PCR tubes (50 μL per tube) and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.",
    "Transfer aliquots to a -80 °C freezer for long-term storage.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4827/bioprotoc-13-18-4827-g001.jpgFigure 1. Purification of Bgus and Xyls. A. Column-purified Bgus is shown here in Eluates 1 and 2 and runs at ~66 kD in a 3%–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue. B. Column-purified Xyls is shown here in Eluates 1 and 2 and runs at ~80 kD in a 3%–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue.Digestion of α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) Use wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) agarose to enrich α-DG from animal tissues, as follows:Harvest 1 g of skeletal muscle from C57BL/6J mice. Pour liquid nitrogen into a mortar and pestle and crush the muscle in it.Note: Take muscles from the legs after euthanizing mice by cervical dislocation. Briefly, remove the skin by making a small cut in the mid-dorsal or ventral region and peel it off the mouse; then, using scissors and forceps, take all muscles from the legs including quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and soleus, until bone is visible. Transfer powdered muscle into a vial and allow to warm for 3–5 min, either on ice or in a cold room.Note: Vial should be able to withstand cold liquid nitrogen. We use plastic liquid scintillation vials. Add 10 mL of solubilization buffer and mince the tissue in a polytron homogenizer for 15 s at speed 4. Repeat this three times.Transfer solution to a 50 mL glass homogenizer and macerate tissue by moving the plunger in and out of the solution at least 10 times.Note: For macerating tissue with an automated overhead stirrer (instead of doing it by hand), use speed 4. Transfer homogenized material to a 50 mL Falcon tube and incubate on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C.Spin the material for 30 min at 20,000× g at 4 °C. Transfer supernatant to new tube.",
    "Equilibrate 500 μL of WGA beads with 5 mL of solubilization buffer. Spin down beads at 1,500× g for 5 min. Remove buffer.Combine material obtained in step D1e with the equilibrated WGA beads and incubate for 16 h on rotator at 4 °C.Spin down beads at 1,500× g for 5 min at 4 °C and save the supernatant as WGA-void fraction.Wash WGA beads with 5 mL of WGA wash buffer by incubating for 5 min on a rotator and then spinning beads at 1,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. Repeat this wash step four times.α-DG is now on the WGA beads. Add 1 mL of WGA elution buffer to elute α-DG from 500 μL of WGA beads and incubate at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator.Spin down beads at 1,500× g for 5 min at 4 °C. α-DG is now in the supernatant or eluate.Buffer exchange 500 μL of the WGA eluate with sodium acetate (pH 5.5) using a 30 kD Amicon concentrator. Use a total dilution factor (DF) of 80 for successfully changing the pH. Critical:  This step is essential for obtaining the pH (5.5) at which both enzymes work.Note: For buffer exchange, follow these steps:  Add 1.5 mL of sodium acetate buffer to 500 μL of WGA eluate in the upper reservoir and spin at 2,000× g for 4 min at 4 °C (DF1 = 4). Approximately 700 μL remains in the upper reservoir. Discard the solution collected in the centrifuge tube.Add 2.1 mL of sodium acetate buffer to the 700 μL solution from the previous step (DF2 = 4). Spin at 2,000× g for 4 min at 4 °C. Approximately 500 μL remains in the upper reservoir.",
    "Add 2 mL of sodium acetate buffer to the 500 μL solution obtained in the previous step (DF3 =5). Spin at 2,000× g for 4 min at 4 °C. The solution in the upper reservoir (~ 500 μL) is now at pH 5.5 and the total dilution factor used is 80 (DF1 × DF2 × DF3 = 4 × 4 × 5 = 80)Add 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (~ 0.7 μL from 12.8 M stock) to the buffer-exchanged eluate and heat for 5 min at 99 °C. Critical:  This step is essential to remove disulfide bridges and unfold the protein to make matriglycan accessible for digestion.Add all protease inhibitors (at final concentrations given in the Recipes) after the solution is cooled down.Thaw the 50 μL of enzyme aliquots on ice and add them to the above mixture.Aliquot 100 μL as the initial timepoint (To) and incubate the rest of the mixture at 75 °C for 16 h with shaking at 600 rpm in a thermomixer.Note: Aliquots from other timepoints can also be taken (e.g., at 4, 6, and 10 h, for T4, T6, and T10, respectively) to check the rate of progression of the digestion. However, for complete digestion of matriglycan on DG, we recommend incubating the samples for 16–23 h (Figure 2E). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4827/bioprotoc-13-18-4827-g002.jpgFigure 2. Digestion of matriglycan by Bgus and Xyls. A, B. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) eluate from mouse skeletal muscle digested with Bgus and Xyls at 65 °C and 75 °C. TON indicates overnight digestion of 16 h. The digestion products are immunoblotted with (A) core DG antibody AF6868 1:200 and (B) anti-matriglycan antibody, IIH6, 1:100. C, D.

    "Progress of digestion over time, as monitored at 2 (T2), 4 (T4), 6 (T6), and 20 h (T20); immunoblotting is with antibody against matriglycan IIH6 (1:100).SDS-PAGE and western blotting We analyze the progression and effectiveness of digestion by running the samples in 3%–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels and performing immunoblotting on PVDF membranes, using antibodies against matriglycan (IIH6, 1:100), against core α-DG (AF6868 1:200) (Figure 2), and/or laminin overlay and solid phase laminin binding assay (Walimbe et al., 2020)."
