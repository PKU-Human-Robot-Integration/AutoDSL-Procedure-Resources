    "1. in vivo injury Model and measurement of isometric torque.\n These procedures can be used for rats or mice7,17,18. To  begin, place the animal supine under inhalation anesthesia (~ 4-5% isoflurane \n  for induction in an induction  chamber,then ~ 2% isoflurane via a nosecone for maintenance) using  a precision vaporizer (cat # 91103, Vet Equip, Inc, \n  Pleasanton, CA).  Apply sterile ophthalmic cream (Paralube Vet  Ointment, PharmaDerm, Floham Park, NJ) to each eye to protect the corneas from  drying.  \n  During the procedure, the animal is kept warm by use of a heat lamp placed outside the cage and kept at least 6 inches from the animal at all times. \n Prep the skin by removing hair and by cleaning  with alternating scrubs of betadine and 70% alcohol to prevent seeding skin  bacteria into the soft tissue or bone.  Confirm  proper anesthesia by lack of a deep tendon reflex (no foot withdrawal in  response to pinching the foot).  A needle  is manually placed through the proximal tibia in order to stabilize the limb  onto the rig (25G or 27G for mouse).  The  needle should not enter the anterior compartment of the leg. \n Lock the needle into a fixed position, such that  the animal is supine and the toes are facing straight up.  A custom-made device is used to secure the  needle and thereby stabilize the leg. \n Place  the foot of the limb onto a custom-machined footplate (Figure 1).  The axis of the footplate is attached to a  stepper motor (model T8904, NMB Technologies, Chatsworth, CA) and a torque  sensor (model QWFK-8M, Sensotec, Columbus, OH).   The foot should initially be aligned so that it is orthogonal to the  tibia, as in Figure 1. \n Use  transcutaneous electrodes (723742, Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, MA) or subcutaneous  electrodes (J05 Needle Electrode Needles, 36BTP, Jari Electrode",
    "Supply, Gilroy,  CA) to stimulate the fibular nerve near the neck of the fibula, where the nerve  lies in a superficial position.  Visually  confirm isolated \n  dorsiflexion by performing a series of twitches (0.1 ms pulse  for the mouse and 1 ms pulse for the rat) before the foot is secured.  Once the foot is secured \n  to the footplate with  adhesive tape, an increase in twitch amplitude in response to an increase in  voltage confirms that opposing muscles (plantarflexors) are not \n  being  simultaneously stimulated. \n Before injury, and at selected time  points after an injury, the maximal force producing capacity of the  dorsiflexors is recorded as the \n  \"maximal isometric torque\" (torque without a change in muscle length).  Torque measurements are performed on  the same rig that is used to induce injury.   Before recording maximal isometric torque, the pulse amplitude is  adjusted to optimize twitch tension and the optimal position of the ankle is  determined by giving twitches at different lengths of the dorsiflexors.  After obtaining a torque-angle curve to determine the optimal length of  the dorsiflexors (resting length, aka Lo), a torque frequency  plot is obtained by progressively increasing the frequency of pulses during a  200 ms pulse train.  A maximal fused  tetanic contraction is obtained usually at 90-100 Hz.  Three separate twitches and tetanic  contractions are recorded and saved for further analysis.",
    "Use commercial software to (Labview version 8.5, National Instruments, Austin,  TX) to synchronize contractile activation, onset of ankle rotation, and torque  data collection.  Stimulation of the  dorsiflexor muscles occurs while the computer-controlled motor simultaneously  moves the footplate into plantar flexion, thus leading to a lengthening  contraction (also called \"eccentric\" contraction, which causes injury of the  muscle).  The specific protocol depends  on the desired magnitude of injury desired by the investigator.  The magnitude of injury, or tissue damage,  can be regulated by manipulation of variables such as angular velocity, timing  of muscle activation, range of motion, and the number of lengthening  contractions. \n To induce injury, superimpose a lengthening contraction onto a maximal  isometric contraction, varying the range of motion, velocity of lengthening, and  timing of stimulation as needed.  For example,  a maximal isometric contraction is obtained in the dorsiflexors and after 200  ms they are lengthened at a selected velocity to approximate normal movement  (900°/sec).  We have  previously shown that activation before the movement and the degree of  lengthening are important factors in obtaining an injury14.  The majority of torque produced by the dorsiflexors  is from the TA11 and we have shown  previously that this model results in injury to this muscle5,13-15.  The TA remains stimulated throughout  lengthening. \n After injury, the animal is removed from the apparatus.  The tibial pin is removed, the leg is cleaned  again, and the animal is returned to the cage",
    "(placed on a  temperature-controlled heating block at 37°C) and monitored until  recovery. This includes waiting until the animal is awake and mobile.  The animals suffer no observable pain during the procedure and there are no visible changes in gait (e.g. lameness) after injury induced by lengthening contractions.  However, appropriate anti-pain treatment is administered subsequently (buprenorphine 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 48 hr after surgery). \n2. In situ measurement of whole muscle  tension.\n The  animal is prepared and the tibia is stabilized as described above in section  1.1 through 1.3.  All instrumentation is turned on  at least 30 min prior to testing for proper calibration and to minimize thermal  drift of the force transducer. \n Incise the skin anterior to the ankle and sever the tendon of the tibialis  anterior muscle (TA).  Carefully tie 4.0 Ethicon  silk non-absorbable suture to the tendon and attach the vicryl suture to the  load cell via the provided S-hook (weight = 0.1g), model FT03, Grass  Instruments, Warwick, RI).   Alternatively, a custom clamp (weight = 0.5g) can be used to attach the  tendon to the vicryl suture (Figure 2). \n The  load cell is mounted  to a micromanipulator (Kite Manipulator, World Precision Instruments Inc,  Sarasota, FL) so that the TA could be adjusted to resting length and aligned  properly (a straight line of pull between the origin and insertion).  The TA is protected from cooling by a heat  lamp and from dehydration by mineral oil. The signals from the load cell  (calibrated before each test) are fed via a DC amplifier (model P122, Grass Instruments,  Warwick, RI) to an A/D board to be collected and stored by acquisition software  (PolyVIEW version 2.1, Grass Instruments, Warwick, RI).",
    "Attach the TA to the load  cell and apply single twitches (rectangular pulse of 1 ms) at different muscle  lengths in order to determine L0.  Muscle resting length, measured using  calipers, is defined as the distance between the tibial tuberosity and the  myotendinous junction.  At this length,  gradually increase the pulse amplitude and then the pulse frequency to  establish a force-frequency relationship.   A maximally fused tetanic contraction is obtained at approximately 90-100Hz  (300 ms train duration comprised of 0.1 ms or 1 ms pulses).  Use 150% of the maximum stimulation intensity  to activate the TA in order to induce maximal contractile activation (P0).   Maximal tetanic contractions can be  performed repeatedly and expressed as percentage of P0, providing an  index of fatigue at any desired point in time. \n3. in vivo MR imaging and/or spectroscopy  of rodent skeletal muscles.\n All  MRI and MRS is performed on a Bruker Biospin (Billerica, MA) 7.0 Tesla MR  system equipped with a 12 cm gradient insert (660 mT/m maximum gradient, 4570  T/m/s maximum slew rate) running Paravision 5.0 software.\n The animal is anesthetized with vaporized isoflurane as described above in  1.1.  An MR-compatible small-animal  monitoring and gating system (SA Instruments, Inc.)  is used to monitor respiration rate and body temperature.  Mouse body temperature is maintained at 36-37°C  using a warm water circulator.  A custom-made  holder is used to position the mouse in the supine position with both legs  parallel to the bore of the magnet from knee to foot.  A four-channel receive-only surface coil is  placed within a 72 mm linear 1H resonator. The resonator coil is tuned and  matched to the sample.",
    "MR Imaging: After localizers, the following MR scans are performed: T1-weighted  rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) with the following  parameters: TE = 9.52 ms, TR = 1800, echo train length = 4, in-plane resolution  100x100 μm, and slice thickness = 750 μm. Dual-echo PD/T2 RARE: TE=19.0/57.1  ms, TR=5000 ms, echo train length = 4, in-plane resolution 100x100 μm, and  slice thickness = 750 μm. Spin echo (SE) diffusion tensor image data using 12  non-colinear directions: b-value = 350 s/mm–2, TE = 26 ms, TR = 4500  ms, in-plane resolution 150x150 μm, and slice thickness = 750 μm. Multi-slice  multi-echo (MSME) T2 parametric mapping data using 16 TEs = 11.4 ms to 182.5 ms  with ΔTE = 11.4 ms, TR = 10000 ms, in-plane resolution 150x150 μm, and slice  thickness = 750 μm. \n Image processing: Diffusion tensor reconstruction and tractography is performed  using TrackVis (Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging; Massachusetts General  Hospital; Boston, MA) to create mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy  (FA) images as well as tractography maps.   T2 mapping is performed using custom software written in MATLAB (The  Mathworks; Natick, MA) using non-linear least squares to fit the measured data  at each pixel to the canonical T2 signal equation. Regions of interest  measurements are performed to assess parameter values within the TA. \n 1H spectroscopy: Automated shimming is performed on a 1 x 1 x 4 mm3 voxel in the TA. A point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) pulse sequence (TR/TE=2000/18  ms) is used to acquire spectra from the same voxel with 1024 averages. Data  acquisition is 34 minutes on each leg. Spectral data are processed using the  LCModel package16.  31P spectroscopy: A dual-tuned (1H, 31P)  surface coil is used to perform non-localized (using a single-pulse experiment)  or localized spectroscopy using the image selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS) pulse sequence.",
    "4. Harvesting and  storing muscles.\n TAs are harvested after at the end of  experiments, weighed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80°C.  This can be performed at any point in  time after the in vivo experiments.  Muscles are harvested  immediately after the in situ experiments, as this is a terminal procedure.   For detailed morphological studies, the animal is fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde  via perfusion through the left ventricle. \n5. Representative  results.\n Figure 3  shows representative data from a rat in the in  vivo apparatus.  The in vivo apparatus is used to obtain maximal torque generated by  the dorsiflexor muscles; it is also used to induce injury to these same muscles.  Due to the length-tension relationship of muscle,  maximal isometric torque typically occurs when the ankle joint is positioned at  approximately 20° of plantarflexion (with the foot positioned  orthogonal to the tibia considered 0°).  After maximal isometric torque is obtained,  the foot can then be placed into any position to begin the injury  protocol.  Figure 3 represents an injury  protocol of 30 repetitions with an arc of motion from 0° - 70°.  Note the steady decline in torque generated  from the isometric phase (filled arrow) and lengthening phase (open arrow) during  the contraction-induced injury protocol.   Torque is recorded in units of Nmm, but the absolute value depends on  the size of the animal and its condition (e.g., injured muscle, fatigued  muscle, or muscle lacking a certain protein due to homologous recombination).",
    "Figure  4 shows representative data from a rat in the in situ apparatus.  Our in situ apparatus does not involve  lengthening contractions; rather, it allows us to isolate, properly align, and measure  maximal tension produced by an individual muscle at a known length.  Figure 4 shows the gradual loss of force that  occurs during a fatigue test in a tibialis anterior muscle of a rat.  In this particular example, titanic  contractions were performed once every second for 5 minutes.  Tension (force) is typically recorded in Newtons  (or grams), but like torque, the absolute value depends on the size and  condition of the animal.  Because muscle  weight is obtained immediately after this procedure, the force can be  normalized (called \"specific force\") to muscle cross sectional area.  \n Figure 5 shows representative data from in vivo imaging of a mouse, such as T1-weighted  and T2 parametric mapping (A), 3D tractography from diffusion tensor imaging  (B), 1H spectroscopy (C), and 31P spectroscopy.

    "Figure 2: In situ apparatus The load  cell is mounted  to a micromanipulator so that the TA could be adjusted to resting length and aligned  properly in the X, Y, and Z directions.   The distal tendon of the TA is attached to the load cell and single  twitches are induced at different muscle lengths in order to determine L0.  A maximal tetanic contraction is obtained to  determine maximal contractile activation (P0).  Maximal tetanic tension can be performed  repeatedly and expressed as percentage of P0, providing an index of  fatigue at a desired point in time.  \n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2782/2782fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Torque data from in vivo apparatus Representative trace recordings  of torque from lengthening contractions in the rat.
