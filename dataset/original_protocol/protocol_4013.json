    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDifferentiation of T. cruzi epimastigotes\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nIn this step, metacyclogenesis is achieved incubating E forms in a biphasic medium formed by liquid LIT medium and solid blood-agar slant.\nDispose of as many screw-cap tubes containing blood-agar slants as E cultures to be differentiated already tempered at 28°C.\nDilute ∼ 2×106 E forms from a culture at the early logarithmic growth phase (day 5 after the weekly dilution) in 3–4 mL complete LIT medium.\nPlace the diluted E forms in the tube containing the blood-agar slant.\nIncubate the tube with the biphasic medium containing E forms at 28°C.\nCritical: In this point, the volume of complete LIT medium used to dilute the E forms should be enough to be in contact with the whole area formed by the agar slant (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/975-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Disposition of LIT medium containing the E forms overlaying the blood-agar slant\nNote the level of liquid medium matching the top of the slant formed by the solid phase.\nCheck the presence of differentiated MT forms since day 12–14 post-incubation of the E forms on biphasic medium.\nLoad 10 μL of culture from the liquid phase into a Neubauer chamber.\nCount E and MT forms using a microscope equipped with a 40× objective.\nCalculate the percentage of MT forms in the sample (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section).\nHarvest the culture for downstream applications when the number of MT forms in the liquid phase of the biphasic medium reaches its maximum (see problem x in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).",
    "Note: Along the incubation on biphasic medium, the metacyclogenesis rate increases over time until it reaches a maximum. For convenience, an initial metacyclogenesis procedure should be carried out to monitor the differentiation kinetics for each strain, which allows setting up the time to yield the maximal percentage of the MT forms (See expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nIsolation of metacyclic trypomastigotes\nTiming: 1 day\nMT can be isolated from non-differentiated E forms for downstream applications, such as cell invasion assays or further differentiation to axenic amastigotes (the in vitro representative form of the T. cruzi intracellular amastigote). This can be achieved by the clearance of the remaining E forms in the differentiated culture by complement-mediated parasite lysis, following the steps detailed here. E forms are highly susceptible to complement mediated-lysis, meanwhile MT are resistant (Lidani et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTransfer the liquid phase of the biphasic medium containing the MT and the non-differentiated E forms into a new centrifugal tube.\nCentrifuge the culture at 3000 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 μL of RPMI.\nAdd 800 μL of FBS and mix thoroughly up and down with a pipette tip.\nCritical: Do not use heat-inactivated nor irradiated FBS because it will not lyse the E forms\nIncubate the mixture at 37°C for 40 min to allow the lysis of E forms by the complement system contained in the FBS.\nLoad 10 μL of the mixture into a Neubauer chamber to check the absence of E forms in the sample.\nNote: At this point, the mixture is composed of cellular debris and highly motile MT forms (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Nevertheless, if motile E forms are still observed in the sample, incubate the mixture at 37°C for an additional 15 min or as long as it is necessary.",
    "Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 × g for 10 min at 20°C–22°C and discard the supernatant, after the complete lysis of E forms.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL of the complete RPMI medium supplemented with 5% FBS (heat-inactivated).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 3000 × g for 10 min to pellet both the MT forms as well as the cellular debris generated by the E lysis.\nIncubate the pelleted cells and debris at 37°C for at least 3 h to allow the motile MT forms swim back again to the supernatant.\nTransfer the supernatant carefully to a new tube with a pipette tip, avoiding disturbing the pellet which contains the lysed debris.\nOptional: Alternatively to the protocol based on E lysis, the MT forms can be purified by ion exchange chromatography based on DEAE matrix (Cruz-Saavedra et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Morphology of MT being incubated with FBS observed on the microscope, related to steps 11 and 12\nNote the cellular debris and the twisted swimming of viable MT versus the flat, non-motile epimastigote that has not yet been lysed."
