    "1. Equipment Setup\nStep 1.1. Imaging setup",
    "The key to recording voltage sensitive dye signals is appropriate setup design. We use an upright microscope (BX51WI Olympus or Zeiss AxioExaminer) equipped with three cameras. The setup is designed for illuminating individual neurons in brain slices by excitation light in epi-fluorescence, wide-field microscopy mode using either Nikon 60X/1.0 NA or Zeiss 63X/1.0 NA water dipping objectives. Our microscopes are bolted to a vibration isolation table and equipped with motorized movable stages. Each microscope is equipped with three camera ports. One camera port has a standard high spatial resolution CCD camera for infrared DIC video-microscopy (IR-1000, Dage MTI, USA). The second camera port has a fast data acquisition camera (up to 20 kHz frame rate) with relatively low spatial resolution (80 x 80 pixels) but outstanding dynamic range (14 bits) and exceptionally low read noise (NeuroCCD-SM, RedShirtImaging LLC, Decatur, GA). The third camera port has a CCD camera with high spatial resolution (PixelFly, 1392x1024 pixels; PCO AG, Germany) mounted on a spinning-disc confocal scanner (CSU-10, Yokogawa, Japan) used to collect z-stacks of confocal images for detailed morphological reconstruction of the stained cell. A frequency-doubled diode-pumped Nd:YVO4 continuous wave laser (400 mW) emitting at 532 nm (MLL-III/400 mW; CNI, Changchun, China) is the source of excitation light. The 2 mm diameter laser beam gated by a shutter (LS6; Vincent Associates) is directed to a light guide coupled to the microscope via a single-port epifluorescence condenser (TILL Photonics GmbH, Gräfelfing, Germany) designed to overfill the back aperture of the objective and provide near uniform illumination of the object plane.",
    "The laser light is used in place of a conventional Xenon arc-lamp to maximize the sensitivity of Vm-imaging by: (1) using a monochromatic excitation light at the red wing of the absorption spectrum to maximize Vm sensitivity of the dye  9, 10 and (2) increasing the intensity of the excitation light beyond the level that can be achieved by an arc-lamp. The excitation light was reflected to the preparation by a dichroic mirror with a central wavelength of 560 nm and the recorded fluorescence light was passed through a 610 nm barrier filter (a Schott RG610). The combined effect of an increase in light intensity and the use of near optimal monochromatic excitation wavelengths was a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity of voltage imaging by a factor of about 50 compared to previous measurements 6.",
    "Step 1.2. Adjust for uniform illumination\nUse a fluorescence slide standard (green excitation/red emission). Insert appropriate neutral density filters in the laser beam path so that the CCD is not saturated. Focus the objective on the surface of the slide. Adjust the position of the receiving end of the quartz light guide in front of the laser launcher objective, and adjust the position of the output end of the light guide attached to the microscope using appropriate actuators on the epi-fluorescence condenser to achieve centered and uniform illumination of the field of view.\nStep 1.3. Determine vibrational noise\nPlace a small black ink mark on the surface of the fluorescence slide. Record light intensity with NeuroCCD in the continuous recording mode. Focus the objective on a dark edge of the black ink mark. Record the light intensity for about 100 msec at 2 kHz frame rate. Display the spatial average of the fractional light intensity traces (ΔF/F) from ~ 20 pixels receiving light from the uniformly illuminated area and from ~20 pixels along the edge of the ink mark. The excess noise in recordings from pixels with high contrast edges reflects the vibrational noise in the system.\nStep 1.4. Vibration isolation\nIt is mandatory to reduce vibrations by using a vibration-isolation table to a level below the shot noise at light intensities comparable to experimental recording conditions. Adjust the vibration isolation table until the vibration noise in the light intensity from pixels covering the sharp edge of the image is negligible. None of the equipment with moving parts (mechanical shutters, fans) can be mounted on the table. The cables from the equipment on the table attached to other components that are not isolated from vibration must be loose so that they do not transmit mechanical vibrations to the microscope.",
    "2. Selection of an Appropriate Neuron for Vm-Imaging\nStep 2.1. Selection of neurons\nMake brain slices according to standard procedures. Use a mouse line expressing EGFP in individual nerve cells of interest. With a spinning disc confocal system, visualize EGFP labeled neurons in the slice. Select neurons for Vm-imaging with intact dendritic/axonal trees, and with processes running parallel and close to the surface of the slice. This cannot be accomplished in wild-type mice because axons and thin dendrites, for the most part, are not visible in DIC microscopy mode.\n3. Loading Neurons with Voltage-sensitive Dye\nStep 3.1. Filling of the patch pipette\nFill glass patch pipettes from the tip with dye-free intracellular solution by applying negative pressure for about 15 s up to 2/3 of the electrode taper. The dye free solution in the tip is necessary to prevent the spill of dye onto the slice which increases the background fluorescence and dramatically reduces signal to noise ratio. Back-fill the electrode with the solution containing the membrane impermeant voltage sensitive dye JPW3028 dissolved in intracellular solution (0.8 mM).",
    "JPW3028, the most successful voltage probe for intracellular application, is a doubly positively charged analogue of the ANEP series of lipophilic styryl dyes that is still sufficiently water soluble to be used for microinjection. The di-ethyl analog of this dye has practically identical characteristics (including voltage-sensitivity) and is commercially available as JPW1114 (see Table 1). We prepare 20 mM stock solution in distilled H2O. 50 μl aliquots of the stock solution are kept frozen at -20 °C. For the final dye concentration of 0.8 mM, 2 μl of the stock solution is dissolved in 50 μl of intracellular solution on the day of the experiment. The stock dye solution is stable and can be kept at room temperature for several months. Thus, we keep one 50 μl aliquot at room temperature until it is used up.\nStep 3.2. Establish a giga-seal quickly\nPatch a previously selected neuron and allow free diffusion of the dye from a somatic patch pipette to the soma in the whole-cell configuration for 20-45 min. It is essential to obtain a seal as fast as possible so that the amount of dye-free solution in the tip can be kept small. Start by practicing fast patching without the dye in the electrode. Next, practice patching and loading neurons with the dye with the goal of using a minimal amount of dye-free solution in the tip without contaminating the surrounding tissue. With practice, it is possible to establish a seal within 1-2 min.\nStep 3.3. Monitor the level of staining",
    "During dye diffusion in the whole-cell configuration, monitor the physiological state of the neuron by recording evoked action potentials in the current-clamp mode. Additionally, monitor the amount of staining by recording the resting light intensity (RLI) from the cell soma at a frame rate of 2 kHz and at a fraction of full light intensity adjusted with neutral density filters (we use 0.04% of the laser light intensity from a 400 mW laser). Continue the dye loading process until the action potential starts to broaden, usually after 20-40 minutes, depending on the electrode size and resistance.\nThe broadening of the spike is completely reversible and most likely due to capacitive load effect of the saturated concentration of the dye in the somatic membrane. The waveform of the spike is fully restored after the dye concentration is equilibrated throughout the neuron.\nStep 3.4. Remove the dye electrode\nAt the end of staining period, carefully pull the patch pipette away from the soma in voltage clamp configuration ensuring that the transition from whole-cell to outside-out patch configuration is attained in the process.\nStep 3.5. Wait for dye diffusion\nIncubate the slice for an additional 1.5-2 hr at room temperature to allow for the voltage-sensitive dye to spread into neuronal processes. After a significant amount of dye diffuses away from the soma into dendritic and axonal processes, the waveform of the AP is completely restored.\n4. Optical Recording\nStep 4.1. Select a cellular compartment for imaging",
    "Locate the soma of the stained neuron under low light level fluorescence and re-patch the neuron with a standard (no dye) patch electrode under DIC. Visualize neuronal processes under low light level at a frame rate of 10-40 Hz in the continuous recording mode of the CCD for voltage-imaging. Reduce the light level with neutral density filters to the minimum required to visualize the object of interest. We use 0.01% of the 400 mW laser intensity during positioning of the stained neuron. Using an X-Y stage, position the neuronal process of interest in the middle of the imaging area. Protect the soma from the excitation light using the partially closed field stop iris of the microscope. Shielding the soma from high intensity excitation light will significantly reduce the photodynamic damage during recording.\nStep 4.2 Record optical signals related to membrane potential transients",
    "Record optical signals related to backpropagated APs in individual dendritic branches. Record optical signals related to APs in the axon. Record optical signals related to backpropagating APs in dendritic spines. Use frame rates appropriate for accurate reconstruction of signal waveform and keep the recording periods and exposure to high intensity excitation light as short as possible to minimize dye bleaching and photodynamic damage. For example, examining the sequence of initiation and propagation of single action potentials in the axon requires recording periods of 5-10 msec. The excitation light intensity during recording is a compromise between the signal-to-noise ratio on the one hand and the degree of dye bleaching and photodynamic damage on the other hand. We use 100% of intensity of the 400 mW laser in recording from long sections of axons when an area of 300 μm in diameter is illuminated. When the excitation light is focused to a 30 μm diameter area for dendritic spine imaging, we use 10-25% of the laser light intensity. The required duration of recording is an important determinant of the optimal excitation light intensity; shorter recording periods allow higher light intensities. The optimal illumination intensity is best determined empirically for each preparation and measurement settings.\n5. Data Analysis\nStep 5.1. Correct the raw data for known errors",
    "The analysis and display of data were carried out using the NeuroPlex program (RedShirtImaging) written in IDL (ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, Colorado) and custom Visual Basic routines. Under the conditions of low light levels, the background fluorescence becomes a significant determinant of the ΔF/F signal size. The raw data were first corrected for this effect by subtracting the average background fluorescence intensity determined from an unstained area on the slice. Subsequently, the signal alignment software was used to correct for temporal jitter in AP initiation as well as for possible small movements of the preparation during averaging. In the temporal domain, AP signals were aligned by cross correlation of the electrically recorded APs in each trial to the reference signal acquired at the start of averaging (Figure 1B). In the spatial domain, images were aligned in two dimensions offline by image cross-correlation to compensate for possible small lateral movements of the preparation. The correct focus of the image in the z-dimension was verified before each individual trial; small adjustments were often necessary. The spatially and temporally aligned signals were averaged as shown in Figure 1B. Slow changes in light intensity due to bleaching of the dye were corrected by dividing the data by an appropriate dual exponential function derived from the recording trials with no stimulation (Figure 1B). The waveform of the AP signal was reconstructed from a set of data points using Cubic Spline Interpolation, a piecewise continuous curve passing through each data point. To confirm that the voltage-sensitive dye signal tracks membrane potential without significant distortion at the millisecond time scale, the electrical AP signal from the soma was compared to the optical AP signal from the adjacent axon hillock as shown in Figure 3B.",
    "The two signals superimpose very closely, allowing for the shot noise in optical recording.",
