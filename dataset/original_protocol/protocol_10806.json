    "1. Transfection of Plasmid DNA\nAdd plasmid DNAs, 0.5 μg membrane-tethered FRB (hereafter referred to as LDR) and 0.5 μg FKBP-Tiam1 (T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1: Rac activator) tagged with fluorescent protein to 37.5 μl dH2O. Add 1 μl FuGENE HD.\nVortex and incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, proceed to steps 1.3-1.8.\nWash each well of an 8-well chamber with 50 μl poly-D-Lysine.\nWash the center of each well with dH2O.\nTrypsinize 80-85% confluent NIH-3T3 cells and dilute to 10 ml culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS).\nRemove 375 μl of suspension and centrifuge at 1750 rpm for 3 minutes.\nAspirate the media, being careful not to disturb the pellet.\nAdd 750 μl of DMEM w/ 10% FBS and resuspend.\nAdd cell suspension to dH2O/DNA/FuGENE HD solution and mix gently.\nAdd 250 μl of cell/DNA suspension to each well (will fill up to 3 wells).\nIncubate the transfected cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 15-18 hr.\n2. Preparation of cRb-A Solution\nSynthesize caged rapamycin-biotin adduct (cRb). See \"Synthetic scheme of cRb\" for details. Briefly, caging and biotin moieties are prepared separately. The caging moiety is then conjugated to rapamycin (LC lab), the product subsequently coupled to the biotin moiety by a means of click reaction7 to afford cRb.\nPrepare a 1 μM stock solution of cRb in DMSO.\nDissolve 1mg avidin in 250 μl of PBS in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 μl of cRb stock solution to dissolved avidin. Mix by inverting several times.\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min to yield cRb-avidin conjugate (cRb-A) solution.\nExclude unbound small molecules and purify cRb-A using a size-exclusion column.\n3. Microscopy and Light Illumination at Subcellular Level\nSerum starve transfected cells in DMEM without FBS for 12 hours.",
    "Gently aspirate the media off the cells and add 250 μl of the prepared 400 nM cRb-A solution (from step 2.6).\nTo visualize protein dynamics in living cells at subcellular resolution before and after light treatment, spinning disk microscopy was used (Figure 2a). UV illumination was achieved by coupling optics for UV LED light (365 nm) with epi-fluorescence light (Figure 2b).\nMetaMorph software was used to capture fluorescence images of transfected cells every 15 seconds.\nDefine the coordinates and size of an illumination spot by using a glass plate coated with fluorescent dyes excited by UV light. The size can be varied by applying objective lens with different magnifications and by selecting optical fibers with different core size.\nAfter determining background levels of membrane ruffling, irradiate UV light at the periphery of cells. The following two steps are to contrast preceding localized effects.\nGlobally irradiate cells with 365 nm light provided by a mercury lamp.\nDissolve uncaged, thus original rapamycin in DMSO and then in PBS (400 nM final), and add the solution to the imaging chamber to induce global effects.\n4. Representative Results",
    "An example of representative results is shown in Figure 3. UV light irradiation at a small region near a cellular edge rapidly induced formation of localized ruffles only in and near the irradiated area. To confirm that this was indeed local activity, we then globally irradiated cells with UV, or added rapamycin to the bulk media, both of which induced global ruffle formation throughout the membrane. For a quantitative analysis, we divided target cells into four quadrants, and counted the frequency of ruffle formation in each quadrant upon local as well as following global stimulation under various conditions including controls (Figure 4). It is only this combination of UV irradiation, cRb-A, and appropriate FKBP-FRB constructs that induces local ruffling.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3794/3794fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Schematic of spatially confined protein dimerization using caged rapamycin-avidin conjugate (cRb-A) and UV light. UV irradiation cleaves the linker between rapamycin and biotin, resulting in the release of chemical dimerizer (HE-Rapa, C40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) rapamycin) and its by-product. The released dimerizer then diffuses into cells and induces dimerization between FKBP-POI (protein of interest) and plasma membrane anchored FRB only in the proximity of the irradiated region (blue circle). Without the UV irradiation, FKBP and FRB do not associate (red cross), hence producing no effect. (Copyright@ACS2011) 6\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3794/3794fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Figure 3.  Spatially confined ruffle formation in a transfected NIH3T3 cell induced by localized UV irradiation. Confocal fluorescence images of a NIH3T3 fibroblast cell that is transfected with YFP-tagged FKBP-Tiam1 (Rac activator) and LDR (membrane-anchored FRB) underwent irradiation in a confined area near its edge with LED light at 365 nm for 15 sec starting at 210 sec in the presence of cRb-A conjugate in the bulk media. This treatment was followed by global illumination with mercury lamp for 1 sec at 1063 sec and global addition of rapamycin final 400 nM at 1560 sec. The cell showed almost no ruffling activity at the beginning (a) but showed spatially confined ruffling after localized illumination (yellow circle) (b). The cell showed global ruffle formation after global illumination and addition of rapamycin(c-d), indicating that the local ruffle formation was caused by spatially confined activation of Rac. Scale bar: 10 μm. (Copyright@ACS2011) 6\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3794/3794fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.  Frequency of ruffle formation in quadrants of transfected NIH3T3 cells. Local UV irradiation with cRb-A and following global UV irradiation were performed on 13 cells. cRb-A addition (no UV irradiation), local UV irradiation with or without avidin were implemented on 13, 5 and 6 cells, respectively. None of the observed cells showed ruffle formation with cRb-A without UV irradiation, or local UV irradiation with or without avidin in bulk media. We collected data from cells with low background ruffle formation but which had the capacity of rapamycin-induced ruffle formation, which we checked after each experiment by confirming global ruffle formation as a result of addition of rapamycin (final 400 nM). These results showed that cRb-A and local UV irradiation are necessary for local ruffle formation in the cells.
