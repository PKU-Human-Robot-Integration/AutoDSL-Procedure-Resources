    "_**1) Initiating field experiment:**_\nOne can either choose to perform disturbance-recovery experiments on the key habitat forming organisms in the ecosystems along stress gradients as is, or transplant them first to manipulate the stress levels the organisms are exposed to. In our case of tidal-marsh vegetation, we applied a transplantation to control the level of inundation stress beyond the level of natural occurrence by transplanting them to different elevations along the tidal flat-marsh inundation gradient or by using mesocosms of different elevations \\(i.e. ‘marsh organ’).\n_1.1) Transplantation procedure_:\n1. Stick out enough vegetation tussocks using the spade and square frame. The number of transplantation units \\(i.e. vegetation tussocks) required is the number of stress levels \\(i.e. inundation levels) times two \\(disturbance and control) times the number of replicates. _Note_: For the transplantations of vegetation tussocks along the stress gradients we used a total of 60 tussocks: 6 inundation \\(i.e. stress) levels; 2 tussocks per level; and 5 replicates per level. For the transplantations of vegetation to the ‘marsh organ’ mesocosms we used a total of 108 units: 9 inundation levels; 2 marsh organs; and 6 replicates per level.\n  2. Randomize the collected tussocks\n  3. Transplant the units to either the _a_) location along the stress gradient or _b_) the ‘marsh organ’ mesocosm:\n  a. _Transplantion along stress gradient_: Transplant two units per level, by digging a hole of the same dimensions as the sticked out units. Put the units deep enough making sure the sediment level of the transplanted unit is level with the surrounding bed level. Repeat the procedure for the number of replicate gradients.",
    "b. _‘Marsh organ’ mesocosm structures_: Setup two ‘marsh organ’ mesocosm structures<sup>7</sup> with various stress \\(i.e. inundation) levels and replicates thereof. One ‘marsh organ’ serves as disturbance treatment and one as control. More detailed description of the experimental design, and basic patterns of vegetation response to inundation in ‘marsh organ’ mesocosm structures can be found in ref \\[7].\n4. To make sure the transplantation was successfully executed, the units are not directly disturbed, but allowed to recover and acclimate from the transplantation. In case of the vegetation transplanted along the stress gradient we returned after a week \\(that is 14 inundations). In case of the ‘marsh organ’ we returned after 10 weeks before disturbing.\n  \n_1.2) Disturbance-recovery procedure_:\n1. The above ground biomass of one of the plots \\(or, alternatively, one of the two ‘marsh organs’) is clipped just above the soil surface, while leaving the vegetation of the other intact as control until the end of the experiment.\n  2. The clipped biomass is collected in separate bags per plot \\(or mesocosm) and measured in the lab \\(following 3) to establish biomass levels at the start of the disturbance-recovery experiment.\n  \n_**2) Running and terminating field experiment:**_\n1. _Before termination of the experiment_: During the course of the experiment the experimental plots need to be visited to check the conditions of the experimental plots. Damaged sticks that demark the plots need to be repaired, to make sure the plots can be found when the experiment is terminated.\n  2. _Termination of the field experiment_:\n  a. The experiment should be terminated before the disturbed plots have fully recovered. In our case, we disturbed the vegetation early in the growing season and finished the experiment late in the growing season before senescence commenced.",
    "b. At termination of the experiment, the aboveground biomass is harvested of both the disturbed and control plots by clipping plant stems at the soil surface.\n_**3) Measuring recovered biomass:**_\n1. After harvesting, plant material is sorted in the laboratory and number of shoots are counted. Additionally, e.g. the shoot length, stem diameter, and number of leaves, or flowers can be measured, and plant materials can be sorted in live and dead fraction.\n  2. Plant material is washed to remove sediment, dirt and animals from the leaves and stems.\n  3. Plant material is dried in an oven at 70℃ to a constant weight \\(minimum 72 hours).\n  4. Dry weight is measured after drying.\n  \n_**4) Estimating recovery rates:**_\nBecause the actual disturbance magnitude _D_ is often unknown a variation on equation \\[3] is used to calculate the recovery rate from the collected data:\n_λ = -log\\(1 - f)/Δt_  \\(4)\nIn case the disturbance and control plot can be treated as pairs than:\n_f = V<sub>dist</sub> / V<sub>cont</sub>_  \\(5)\nHere, _V<sub>dist</sub>_  is the biomass recovered in the disturbed plot and _V<sub>cont</sub>_  the biomass in the paired control plot.\nHowever, an alternative to the paired control is required to estimate the recovery rate reliably if recovery was too swift \\(i.e. _f>1_ for some/all plots) and/or the site is heterogeneous and stochastic \\(see **Troubleshooting**)."
