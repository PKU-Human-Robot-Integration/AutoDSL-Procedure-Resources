    "5 ml of YPD + uridine culture in a 15 ml conical tube is inoculated with a single colony of Candida albicans growing on a plate that is between 2 and 10 days old (age of colony may vary based on growth rate of particular strain). Most Candida strains and species should grow well in this medium, but if another medium is commonly used for a specific strain, that can be used instead.Inoculum is incubated overnight at 30 °C and 200 rpm.Cell concentration of overnight culture is determined by cell counting on a hemocytometer.Inoculum diluted to 1 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI + MOPS.1 ml of diluted incolulum added to each well of a 6 well plate.Note: Inoculum spread to cover the entire bottom of the well.6 well plate incubated at 30 °C for 60 min without shaking.Inoculum is then removed from each well gently, so as not to scratch away the newly forming biofilm.1 ml of fresh RPMI + MOPS media is added gently to each well.6 well plates are wrapped in parafilm and aluminum foil and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 50 rpm.Note: It is very important that the biofilms not be shaken above 50 rpm, as this will dislodge the growing biofilm from the plate bottom.After 24 h, media is gently removed so as not to disturb the biofilm and replaced with 1 ml of fresh RPMI + MOPS.Note: Tilting the 6 well plates and gently placing your pipet tip in the corner of the well helps to prevent too much disruption of the fragile biofilm.6 well plates are re-wrapped as before and incubated another 24 h at 37 °C and 50 rpm.",
    "After the second 24 h incubation, the media is removed from the wells and the biofilms are gently washed 1x in 1 ml of 1x PBS. It is important to slowly pipet in the PBS so as not to disturb the delicate biofilms. The PBS wash can be removed immediately after adding it to the biofilm.Harvest each biofilm in 2 ml of 1x PBS and store in a 15 ml conical tube.Note: Harvesting is best done by adding 1 ml of PBS into the well and scraping away the biofilm with a plastic spatula, and adding the biofilm to the conical tube. Then repeat this process with the second 1 ml of PBS to collect any remnants.  Conical tubes are gently centrifuged at 720 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in 2 ml of Fixative.Tubes can be stored at 4 °C until ready for imaging by a trained transmission electron microscopist. It is recommended that the tubes not be stored more than a few days.The following steps are a summary of those performed by a trained transmission electron microscopist.Cells are postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide.Samples are then dehydrated by soaking for 10 min each in increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%).Next, samples are rinsed 3 x 10 min in 100% propylene oxide then embedded in Spurr’s resin.70 nm sections are cut and placed on copper grids and poststained for 5 min with 8% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol and for 5 min in Reynold’s lead citrate stain.Samples can now be analyzed by TEM. A sample picture of a reference strain Candida albicans biofilm is shown below (Figure 1).",
    "Most pictures will only show one or two cells at a time, and usually cross-sectioned so that you can see inside the cells.
