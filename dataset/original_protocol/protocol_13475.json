    "Study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consents were obtained from patients.\n1. Inclusion-exclusion criteria\nInclude adult acute pancreatitis patients with evidence of infected necrosis that required an indication for invasive intervention.\n\tNOTE: Acute pancreatitis is defined when at least two of the three following features are observed in patients 1) typical upper abdominal pain, 2) level of serum amylase or lipase above three times the upper level than normal, 3) typical findings of cross-sectional abdominal CT or MRI imaging10,11,12. Infected necrosis is defined as a positive culture obtained by fine needle aspiration or PCD of necrotic collections, or the presence of gas configurations within necrotic collections on contrast enhanced CT image.\nExclude patients with previous invasive interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis, acute episode of chronic pancreatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis and with indications for emergency laparotomy (i.e., abdominal compartment syndrome, perforation or bleeding of a visceral organ, and gastrointestinal or biliary obstruction).\n2. VARD procedure\nFirstly, in acute necrotizing pancreatitis patients with above criteria, place ultrasound-guided percutaneous pigtail catheters (14 Fr or 16 Fr) into the left or right retroperitoneum to drain peripancreatic or necrotic collections, that can be located on the contrast enhanced CT image. (If condition permitted, duration of PCD placement should be maintained within about 4 weeks after the onset of AP for necrotic collections to demarcate and wall-off.\nIf infected collections persisted and patients' clinical situation deteriorates (progressive elevation of body temperature, elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, new onset of progressive organ dysfunction), be sure to provide surgical intervention and apply VARD in these patients1,2.",
    "Place the patient in supine position or in supine position with the left side 30-40Â° elevated, and under general anesthesia.\nMake a skin incision (12 mm) at the site of previous pigtail catheter and gently dilate the tract with forceps.\nInsert a 12 mm laparoscopic trocar along the tract to the retroperitoneal necrotic collections followed by the removal of the pigtail catheter.\nApply carbon dioxide pneumoretroperitoneum (11 mmHg to 12 mmHg) if a wider debridement space is needed by insufflating carbon dioxide through this 12 mm trocar.\nPlace a near-infrared fluorescence laparoscopy via the observing trocar and make one additional incision (10 mm) subcostal in the left (or right) flank at the mid-axillary line, under laparoscopy monitoring (the incision can be close to the exit point of the percutaneous drain if another drainage pigtail catheter existed). The incision should be at least at a 8 cm distance from the observing trocar.\nInsert a 10 mm laparoscopic trocar from above the incision and remove necrotic debris using laparoscopic graspers. Necrotic debris turn out to be a retroperitoneal mass with grayish yellow under white light image or low contrasted under fluorescence image. Aspirate the collections by laparoscopic aspirator via the operative trocar. Extend the above incision to 5 cm with electrotome under laparoscopy monitoring if removal of the larger pieces of necrosis is needed.\n3. ICG-guided intraoperative fluorescence imaging\nAfter insertion of a 10 mm operative trocar and before beginning to separate necrotic debris from adjacent normal tissue using laparoscopic forceps, switch the display mode of the laparoscopy to multi-display mode (white light image and fluorescence image are displayed separately in Picture-in-Picture mode).",
    "Inject the first bolus of ICG (0.1 mg/kg body weight) intravenously in a peripheral vein. Then, follow with a flush of 10 mL of saline. After 10 to 20 s, visualize peak perfusion of adjacent normal tissues or vessels in the fluorescence field. A clearer separating surface can be distinguished from the debris.\nOnly remove poorly perfused and loosely adherent necrotic debris using laparoscopic graspers. Avoid tearing the underlying bowel or vessel.\nInject another bolus of ICG (0.1 mg/kg body weight) intravenously if ICG fluorescence decay.\nAfter the removal of the bulk of necrotic debris, irrigate the cavity of the retroperitoneum with saline and aspirate with laparoscopic aspirator until the lavage fluid becomes clear.\nPlace at least one pair of drainage tubes at the deepest region of the cavity after debridement. Suture the fascia and skin and close.\n4. Postoperative management\nPerform continuous lavage with sterile saline and repeat CT scan 1 week after the VARD procedure.\nSubscription Required.
