    "Note: Please be sure to optimize your conditions. Empirical tests are required to optimize RIP conditions and to obtain the optimal signal-to-noise ratio results, meaning that target RNAs are enriched in the specific RBP IP compared to the IgG IP control while nonspecific, non-target RNAs are equally present in both the IgG and RBP IP samples.Day 1 Antibody coating of Protein A Sepharose (PAS) beadsUse 60 μl of PAS beads for each reaction.Wash the beads 1 time with 1 ml of ice-cold of NT2 by inverting the tube a few times, centrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g, 4 °C and resuspend the beads in 60 μl NT2 buffer.Add 5 μg of the antibody of interest (anti-NF90 in this case) or control IgG (normal mouse IgG in this case) to 60 μl of PAS beads.Notes: Be sure to match the antibody of interest with a species-compatible control IgG. The isotype control is used to determine the specific versus the non-specific signals (RNAs) which are immunoprecipitated due to the immunoglobulin isotype rather than the specific RBP. The amount of antibody required for IP will depend on the antibody quality and the RBP analyzed. The optimal amount of antibody should be tested beforehand by doing IP with this protocol using 2, 5, 10 and 20 μg Ab. Add 200 μl NT2 buffer.Bind overnight on rotator at 4 °C.Preparation of cultured cellsPrepare cells as needed. For THP-1, the day before RIP, the cells should be plated at a concentration of 0.5 x 106/ml. For two IP reactions (IgG control IP and RBP IP), a total of 1 x 107 cells is needed.Note: For adherent cells, one 10-cm culture dish is typically enough for two IP.",
    "Day 2 Preparation of the Antibody coated PAS beadsAdd 1 ml of ice-cold NT2 and wash the beads by inverting the tube a few times, centrifuge for 2 min at 2,000 x g, 4 °C, and repeat once.After the last spin, remove excess NT2 buffer and resuspend the beads in 50 μl NT2 buffer. The PAS/Ab beads are now ready to be used, keep on ice.Preparation of Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) lysate from cultured cellsCollect the volume of THP-1 cells necessary to have 1 x 107 cells for the two IP reactions and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 25 °C.Wash with PBS and centrifuge again for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 25 °C.Note: It is best to use fresh lysate immediately. Loosen the final cell pellet by gently flicking the tube and add 1 ml of ice-cold PEB buffer supplemented with RNase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.Mix by pipetting a few times (do not vortex), place on ice for 10 min.Spin for 15 min at 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Transfer supernatant (RNP lysate) to fresh microfuge tubes.(Optional step) Preclearing (not necessary for RIP followed by RT-PCR).Preclear the supernatant with 10 μg of IgG1 antibody control for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation.Add 50 μl PAS, incubate for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation.Spin down at 2,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Save supernatant in a fresh tube. This is your pre-cleared lysate.Measure protein concentration of the lysate by the Bradford assay. A typical concentration when using these cells is ~5 μg/μl. You will need 500-1,000 μg of lysate for each RIP.Immunoprecipitation of RNPsAliquot the precoated PAS/Ab (around 50 μl) into microfuge tubes.Prepare a master mix using the following additives for each reaction:300 μl NT2 buffer10 μl 0.",
    "1 M DTT (do not add the DTT to the pellet directly as this will reduce the antibody and the IP will not work)10 μl RiboLock33 μl 0.5 M EDTAAdd 500 μg RNP lysates.Note: The amount of lysate required for IP will depend on the RBP, the cell type, and the antibody used. Optimal amounts of lysates should be determined beforehand by testing IP with 250, 500, and 1,000 μg of material. Add NT2 buffer to 1 ml.Incubate for 1-2 h at 4 °C with rotation.Spin down at 2,000 x g, 2 min, 4 °C. Discard supernatant.Wash pellet 5 times* each with 1 ml of ice-cold NT2 buffer. Spin between washes: 2,000 x g, 2 min, 4 °C.Note: (Optional) Take 100 μl of beads during the last wash to verify the IP by Western blot analysis (more details below in Notes). After the last wash, gently add 100 μl of NT2 buffer containing 5 μl DNase I (2 U/μl). Keep at 37 °C for 10 min.Note: It is critical not to resuspend the beads harshly–simply eject the contents of the pipettor and place at 37 °C swirling delicately. It is important not to shake at this step! Add 1 ml of NT2 buffer and spin at 2,000 x g, 2 min, discard supernatant.Make a master mix using the following reagents for each reaction: 100 μl NT2, 2.5 μl of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml), 1 μl 10% SDS. Add 100 μl of this master mix to each PAS pellet.Incubate at 55 °C for 20 min, with gentle mixing.Spin at 2,000 x g, 2 min, collect the supernatant (~100 μl) to a fresh tube.To the beads, add 200 μl NT2 buffer, spin at 2,000 x g, 2 min, collect the supernatant (~200 μl) and combine with the supernatant above. Discard beads.",
    "To the combined supernatants (100 μl plus 200 μl), add 700 μl of Trizol reagent.Vortex for 1 min at 25 °C.Extract the RNA according to Trizol manufacturer’s instruction.RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysisAdd 200 μl chloroform to each sample.Shake the tubes vigorously by hand for 10 s then centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the upper aqueous layer to a fresh microfuge tube containing 1 ml isopropanol and 1 μl of Glycoblue.Note: The upper aqueous layer is generally 70% of the initial volume of Trizol. Precipitate the RNA by incubating for 10 min at 25 °C followed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet once with 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Air dry RNA pellet for 5-10 min at 25 °C.Dissolve RNA in 20 μl nuclease-free water.Note: Do not measure OD260, as the concentration is very low and this will probably waste most of your sample. Just use 5-10 μl directly to prepare your cDNA. Use 5 μl of the RNA solution for reverse transcription by preparing a 20-μl reaction in a 0.2 ml PCR tube containing 5 μl of prepared RNA, 1 μl random primers, 4 μl 5x RT buffer, 1 μl RiboLock, 1 μl dNTP mix and 1 μl Maxima reverse transcriptase. Bring to 20 μl with Nuclease-free water.Mix and centrifuge for a few seconds.For the cDNA synthesis, use these thermal cycler parameters: 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 30 min and 5 min at 85 °C (the manufacturer’s instructions for Maxima reverse transcriptase).Dilute the cDNAs with nuclease-free water to 100 μl final volume (1:5 dilution).",
    "Prepare 10 μl qPCR reactions in a 384-well plate, using the following mix: 5 μl 2x SYBR Green PCR mix, 1 μl cDNA, and 4 μl primer mix (forward and reverse primers). Use specific primers for mRNAs of interest as well as for 1 or 2 mRNAs encoding housekeeping proteins (e.g., HSP90, ACTB, UBC or GAPDH mRNAs).Cover the plate with optical adhesive film and centrifuge the plate for 10 s using Plate Spinner to settle the reactions at the bottom of the wells.Use a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System for qPCR with a cycle set up of 3 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C plus 20 s at 60 °C. When using a primer set for the first time, analyze the dissociation curves to verify that the primer set is optimal in these conditions."
