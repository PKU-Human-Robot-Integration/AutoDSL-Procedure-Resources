    "1. Protocol text\nSelect a room with little electrical interference.  A sink is convenient to wash your hands and to clean electrodes.  An internet connection is also preferable to share data and for manufacturer of your system to update software or help solve problems.\n Organize your dilating drops, balanced salt solution, topical anesthetic and cleaning products so that they are readily accessible.    \nAlways place subjects in the same position and use the same room lighting for every subject. \nAfter introducing yourself and the procedure, dilate the subject's eyes.  Only mydriatic dilation is necessary.  Once eyes dilate to about 7 mm testing can begin.    \nThere are several types of recording electrodes.  Popular electrodes include the ERG Jet, DTL silver wire, gold foil and speculum contact lens.  If using reusable electrodes follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sterilization.    \nThe convention is for recording electrode touching cornea or sclera to be positive pole, which produces signal with b-wave up.  If using a monopolar recording electrode choose a location on head for the negative pole such as forehead, mastoid or earlobe.  Ground electrode may be placed any location on body.    \n Clean the skin electrode locations well with alcohol and/or a skin preparation product.    \nIf the recording electrode contacts the eye numb the eye with several drops of a topical anesthetic. If using contact lens or speculum contacts be very careful not to scratch the cornea.    \nIf your mfERG system displays stimulus on video monitor place all subjects same distance from stimulus monitor.  Make testing situation the same for every subject.    \nPay attention that the subject is comfortable and emphasize importance of maintaining fixation and being relaxed.  Choose fixation target that subject can maintain fixation.  Verbally coach patients during testing to maintain fixation and stay relaxed.",
    "Multifocal electroretinograms are useful to diagnose and quantify progress of most retinal diseases, ocular trauma, and retinal drug toxicity.    \nBack up your data at the end of each recording session in addition to saving in system's computer memory. \nI recommend one consults the ISCEV mfERG recording procedure guidelines2 and that all procedures including research subjects be approved by an Institutional Review Board. \n2. Representative Results\nAn example of an mfERG measurement taken from a patient with significant upper left visual field loss is shown in figure 1 superimposed onto the Humphrey 24-2 visual field.\nFigure 2 shows a color scale transformation for a patient with pockets of retinal toxicity between 5 and 15 degrees away from the fovea. This result is consistent with Plaquenil and chloropromazine toxicity 3, 4 which usually begins with small areas of a few square millimeters affected in region 5-15 degrees from fovea. By contrast, Stargardt's disease and cone dystrophies show conspicuous reduction in mfERGs in the central macular, where cones dominate. This result illustrates the power of mfERG in differential diagnosis. Birdshot chorioretinopathy (Figure 3), is an uncommon retinal disorder that is peculiar in that the first electrophysiological anomaly is a slowing of cone physiological response. The progression of this slowing can be followed using mfERG, as the effect progresses from a small area in the nasal retina region to the complete coverage of the retina (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3176/3176fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
