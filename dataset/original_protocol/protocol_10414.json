    "All experiments were completed in accordance and compliance with all relevant guidelines outlined by the University of Waterloo's animal research ethics committee. The bovine eyes are generously donated from a local abattoir.\n1. Eye Model\nDesign and Production of Molds13\nDesign the eye models according to the average physiological dimensions of human adult eyes.13\nLeave a gap of 250 µm between the eyeball and the eyelid pieces of the eye model. Design the respective molds using computer-aided design (CAD) software.\nCreate new .cad file or .sldprt file with AutoCAD or Solidworks. Create 3D models of the human eyeball/eyelid. Create molds of the models and save the molds as .stl files.\nImport .stl files into 3D printer software (e.g., makeware for replicator2). Specify parameters of the print (location, sparseness, scale, orientation, smoothness, etc.)13.\nSave the file as G-code file for 3D printers to read. Select materials such as PLA (polylactic acid), ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), PC (polycarbonate), or a combination thereof, to print the molds13.\nInstall desired filament of the material of choice. Import the G-code file into the 3D printer to read. Print the mold.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, produce the eye molds using a computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine, if a smoother surface on the eye model is desired. For CNC mold production, materials for molds are no longer limited to thermal plastics, but extend to metal, ceramics, and chemically resistive polymers such as Polytetrafluoroethylene.\nOpen the CNC software interface that is connected to a cutting drill. Construct 3D molds according to front, top, side, and perspective views of the previously-constructed eyeball/eyelid model molds in control software interface. Select appropriate parameters for the machining (bit size, substrate material, material thickness) and proceed to cut the mold.\nSynthesis of Eyepieces Using PDMS",
    "Using a syringe, measure 10 ml volume of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) base and fill it into a 15-50 ml centrifuge tube. Add 10% w/v of the elastomer solution by total weight of PDMS. Using a stirring rod, mix the solutions well.\nPour the PDMS solution into the eyeball and eyelid molds. Allow the PDMS to settle at RT O/N (or for at least 12 hr) to start the polymerization and to allow bubbles to dissolve out of the polymer.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that there are no bubbles left in the PDMS that might rise or expand.\nSubsequently, put the molds into a 75 °C (167 °F) oven for 1 hr, or 150 °C (302 °F) for 5 min. For a softer gel, let the PDMS sit at RT for at least 48 hr to completely polymerize.\nPut the samples in a freezer for a few min; this will shrink the PDMS and simplify the removal of the samples from the molds. Extract the eyepieces from the molds using a thin spatula.\nFor the delivery of solution into the space between the eyeball and eyelid pieces, connect a 1/16\" x 1/8\" polytetrafluoroethylene tube with a 1/16\" equal leg coupler tube connector and attach it to the eyelid piece at the tubing hole.\nSynthesis of Eyeball Piece Using Agarose\n\tNOTE: The eyeball piece can be synthesized using other polymers such as agarose. The following procedure can also be modified to produce eye pieces from a variety of agar types, such as PDA (potato dextrose agar) or SDA (sabouraud dextrose agar).\n\t\nTo produce a 2% (2 g/100 ml) gel, measure 2 g of agarose and mix with 100 ml of ultrapure water. Bring the solution to a boil (100 ºC) such that the agarose dissolves completely. Let the solution cool down for 5 min.",
    "Pour the solution into the eyeball mold and allow the solution to cool for 30 min at RT. Remove the eyeball pieces with a spatula. Store the eyeball agar in a -20 °C freezer for later use. For microbiology studies, sterilize the eyeball molds by autoclaving and/or UV-irradiation.\nIncorporation of Bovine Cornea on PDMS Eyeball\n\tNOTE: This protocol has been adapted from Parekh et al.14\nPerform the dissection and incorporation of the bovine corneas in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood. Acquire the eyes and dissect them on the same day.\nTurn the flow hood on for 10 min prior to use and sanitize with 70% ethanol alcohol. Ensure that all materials and instruments are sterile by autoclaving at 273 °F/133 °C for 45 min, and positioned no less than 4 inches from the flow hood entrance.\nImmerse the bovine eye in a beaker containing a diluted povidone-iodine solution for 2 min. Rinse the eye in a beaker containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Using forceps gently place the eye on a glass petri dish, corneal face up.\nRemove the excess muscle and fatty tissue by cutting at the scleral attachment points with blunt end dissection scissors. Dispose of the excess tissue into a sterile beaker designated for animal waste.\nUsing micro-scissors, remove the conjunctiva from the eye. Wrap the eye with sterile gauze, maintaining a distance of at least 1 cm from the limbus.\nUsing a scalpel, incise the sclera approximately 2 mm from the limbus region and superficially so as to avoid penetration of the underlying choroid and vitreous body. Carefully extend the incision by 360° using a scalpel or dissection scissors without deforming the cornea from its natural curvature.",
    "With fine forceps, remove the cornea from the eye. Using forceps, carefully remove any adhering uveal tissue and rinse cornea with PBS.\nStore the cornea at 31ºC in a sterile container with culture medium (such as Medium 199) containing 3% Fetal Bovine Serum to maintain tissue moisture and cell nourishment.\nPrior to experimentation, rest the excised cornea on the PDMS eyeball, and clamp the two pieces together with a specialized clip-on.\n2. Blink-platform\nDesign and Production of the Blink-platform\n\tNOTE: The blink-platform is composed of three functional parts: eye model (described in section 1), gear system, and electronic system.\n\t\nDesign and manufacture the blink platform using CAD and 3D printing, similar to that described for the eye model (section 1.1). Design the gear system such that it translates simple rotation of motors into the lateral and rotational motions of the eyepieces.15\nUsing the pinion and gear mechanism, translate rotational motion of a stepper motor into the lateral motion of a pinion, which is connected to the eyelid pieces.\nUsing the conjugate gear system, amplify one rotational motion from a stepper motor into three (or more) rotational motions for three different eyeball pieces.\nAlign the two gear systems, one for the eyelid and one for eyeball, so that the distance between the two are constant. Assemble the electronic system with a microcontroller, motor shield, and two motors.\n\t\tNOTE: Use two stepper motors to provide rotational motors, which is translated by the gear system into a blinking motion.\nConnect the two stepper motors with a system consisting of a motor shield stacked on the microcontroller. Connect and configure the electronic components to work with open source software products.\nProgram the system to control motor parameters such as rounds per minute (RPM), number of rounds forward, number of rounds backward, and turning style.",
    "NOTE: Refer to the supplementary \"Arduino code file\" for details.\nDownload the system software from the manufacturers' website.\nInstall the software and open it. Write the code to control stepper motors in the desired configuration. Connect the system with a source to power the electronic system so that the motors move in the desired manner as defined by the researcher.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the supplementary \"Arduino code file\".\nAssembly with Microfluidics (Artificial Tear Solution)\n\t\nTake the synthesized eyeball and eyelid pieces and slip them onto their corresponding clip-ons for the eye-model. Connect the tubing that is joined with a syringe and positioned on the microfluidic pump with the eyelid piece (section 1.2.5). Test run the platform and check for consistent movement.\nPrime the tubing and check for a steady flow of artificial tear solution (ATS). The recipe for ATS has been previously reported.16\nManually move the eye-model parts together on a level plane, such that the eyeball and the eyelid are in contact. Set the flow rate of the microfluidic pump to desired values. Set physiological flow rates to 1-1.5 µl/min.17\nStart the pump and the actuators to begin experiment. For drug delivery experiments, place the drug-containing contact lens on the eyeball piece.\nAllow the flow-through fluid to drip into a 12-well plate. At the desired set time intervals, quantify the analyte or drug concentration using common detection methods such as UV-Vis spectroscopy or fluorescence.1,4,18\nFor studies evaluating deposition of tear components on contact lenses, place the contact lens on the \"eyeball\" piece. Collect the flow-through fluid, which can be discarded.\nAfter the desired time intervals, remove the contact lens from the eyeball piece and prepare the lens for further analysis such as confocal microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
