    "1. Chip Fabrication12\nMake  two plaques from Zeonex 690R pellets: distribute 8-9 grams Zeonex pellets  evenly in the center of a metal plate, preheat on the heated press at 198 °C for  5 min, and then apply pressure slowly to 2,500 psi for another 5 min. To  complete this step, we used a Carver hot press.\nEmboss the microfluidic channel in the plaque with an epoxy mold. Details on the mold  fabrication are outlined elsewhere12 (channel design in Figure 2b): put one plaque onto the  epoxy mold; preheat them on the heated press at 157 °C for 10 min and then apply  pressure slowly to 1,000 psi for another 10 min. Remove the plaque from the  mold by hand or using a tongs before it cools down. (Note: wear thermal gloves during this step.)\nDrill  holes in the embossed chip at the inlet, waste port, and the outlet of the microfluidic  channel. We used a 1.25 mm diameter drill bit to make the three holes.\nBond  the embossed chip with another plaque (on top): Wash the chips with IPA, RNAse Away  and deionized water in sequence; Air dry and preheat them on the heated press at  131 °C for 10 min and then press at 350 psi for another 10 min.\nAttach  Nanoports at the inlet, waste, and the outlet ports separately using J-B Weld Epoxy;  cure for 15 to 24 hr as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nRinse  the SPE channel with 50 μl RNAse Away, followed with 100 μl nuclease free water.",
    "Load  the SPE channel with 4 μl of the grafting solution (methyl methacrylate with 3%  w/v benzophenone) and then crosslink the methacrylate by incubating for 10 min  in a UV oven under 365 nm UV wavelength and 2,000 mJ/cm2. Remove the  residual grafting solution with vacuum.  We used the wall vacuum. For the best results, a fresh solution should  be used. It is usually acceptable, however, to store a prepared solution at 4   °C for up to one week.\nMake  the SPE column solution (all v/v %): 16%  ethylene dimethacrylate, 24% butyl methacrylate, 42% 1-dodecanol, 18%  cyclohexanol, and add 1% 2-dimethylamino-4-(methyl-phenylamino)-phenol as the  photo-initiator.\nTake  out the same volume of silica microspheres solution as the SPE column solution  (to make a 1:1 mixture), and completely dry it at 70  °C overnight in a vacuum  oven. Break up the pellet by tapping on the tube with the lid closed. Add the  SPE column solution into the dried silica microsphere tube and vortex to mix.\nLoad  4 μl of the SPE solution into  the same channel and then crosslink it by UV irradiation for 2.5 min. Then, flip the chip over and irradiate for  another 2.5 min. The polymerized SPE column  should be an opaque white solid.\nWash  the channel with 500 μl of 100% methanol to rinse away excess reactants. This wash also removes intra-polymer porogenic  solvents, thereby creating the open pore structure of the SPE column when dried  in ambient conditions.\nAttach  two thin-film heaters to the bottom of the chip with thermally conductive tape.  The sides of the heaters need to be aligned with the edge of the wide channels  for denaturation and annealing separately (see Figure 1).",
    "Place  five thermocouples into the chip through the dead ended open side channels of  each chip (see Figure 2b). The thermocouples stay in these channels via press fit. Tape was used to further fix the location of  thermocouples.\n2. Solid Phase Extraction Method\nPrepare  96 μl of 70% ethanol with DEPC-treated and autoclaved water (deionized or  Millipore-filtered).\nAdd  4 μl of 25X RNA Secure to 96 μl of 70% ethanol in one tube, and duplicate the  same mixture with 100% ethanol in a separate tube.\nPrepare  300 μl of channel buffer by mixing the following: 75 μl of 6 M guanidine  thiocyanate (GuSCN),150 μl of 2-propanol, 63 μl of nuclease free water, and 12  μl of 25X RNA Secure.\nPrepare  312 μl of lysis buffer by mixing: 100 μl of 6 M GuSCN, 200 μl of 2-propanol, and  12 μl 25X RNA Secure.\nHeat  the 70% ethanol, 100% ethanol, channel buffer and lysis buffers at 60 °C for 10-20 min to activate the RNA Secure.\nTo  equilibrate the microfluidic channel, run the channel buffer through the SPE channel at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/hr.\nQuick-thaw  the test sample in VTM at 37 °C in water bath, and remove the sample immediately  from water bath as soon as it is thawed.\nCentrifuge  sample at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and transfer 100 μl of the supernatant into 300 μl of the lysis buffer. Complete the  mixture by adding 6 μl of 1 μg/μl carrier RNA.\nVortex  to mix, and after spin for 5 sec, load the entire lysate into a Luer-lok 1 cc  syringe.\nRun  lysate through the SPE channel at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/hr .",
    "Wash  the SPE channel with 100 μl of 70% ethanol , followed by 100 μl of100% ethanol at  1 ml/hr. (There is a 50 μl dead volume in the syringe tip that will not get  pushed out, so actually only 50 μl is going through the channel.)\nPosition  an empty syringe at the 0.5 ml mark and push air through the channel to dry it  at 1 ml/hr.\nRun  67.5 μl of nuclease-free water through the channel to elute the bound nucleic  acids at 0.5 ml/hr, and collect 13.5 μl from the nanoport at the waste port. (The  fluid loss is due to the 54 μl dead volume in the syringe tip and the SPE  channel.)\n3. RT-PCR\nPrepare  36.5 μl of the RT-PCR master mix during the air dry step (2.12) using the  reagents in a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kits.\nLoad  RT-PCR reagent in the nanoport at the waste port, and mix with RNA to get the  following 50 μl RT-PCR reaction: 13.5 μl  eluted RNA in nuclease free water, 4 μl RT-PCR enzyme mix, 10 μl Q solution, 10 μl1X one step buffer, 2 μl  25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl 50 μM  forward primer 5'-GAC CRA TCC TGT CAC CTC TGA C-3', 1 μl 50 μM reverse primer  5'-AGG GCA TTY TGG ACA AAK CGT CTA-3', 2 μl dNTP, 0.75 μl 1.0% w/v BSA, 0.73 μl PEG8000 and 5.02 μl nuclease free  water.\nLoad  the RT-PCR mixture into the RT channel by gentle vacuum (we used the wall  vacuum) and seal the Nanoport with a closed fitting.",
    "Apply  35 V to heater 1. Keep the reagents in the RT channel for 30 min after the  heater 1 equilibrates at 50 °C.  Keep the reagents in the RT channel for 15 min after the heater 1 equilibrates at 95 °C.\nApply  27 V to heater 1 and 50 V to heater 2, wait about three minutes or until heater 1 equilibrates at 60 °C and heater 2 equilibrates  at 95 °C.\nPush  the reagents into the PCR channel at 0.5 μl /min. It should take about 20 min for the reagents to flow through the serpentine channel.\nAs  the sample makes it to the end of the serpentine channel, collect the PCR  products at the outlet using an appropriately sized pipettor and tip.\n4.  PCR Products Detection\nWe  use an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA test to detect the products. To run this  test take out the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit from refrigerator 30 min  before testing.\nTurn  on the Bioanalyzer and open the 2100 Expert software.\nLoad  the 1 μl of the PCR products into the testing and follow the Agilent protocol (http://gcf.pbrc.edu/docs/Agilent/Agilent%20Manual.pdf[href=http://gcf.pbrc.edu/docs/Agilent/Agilent%20Manual.pdf]).\nAnalyze  and record the data.\nSubscription Required.
