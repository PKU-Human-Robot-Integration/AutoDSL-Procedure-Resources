Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\n          \nPlace females into a fresh vial of food.\n            Collect virgins and pool until an optimal number of flies is\n            reached.\n          \nNote: for best results keep the vial of\n      enclosing flies at 25°C during the day and at 18°C during the night.\n    \nCritical: Drosophila males can\n      mate with females as soon as their cuticle hardens, therefore it is\n      important to make sure that all males are removed from the vials soon\n      after emergence. In our experiments,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] the\n      conditions for virgin collection that we used for the 14 different species\n      was to maintain the vials with enclosing flies at 18°C for maximum of 16 h\n      and at 25°C for a maximum of 8 h.\n    \nNote: In our experiments, we minimized\n      substantial age variation in the females being pooled. We noted the\n      collection date as the day the last female was added. Since we expanded\n      our stocks extensively prior to starting virgin collection most were\n      collected and pooled within short time intervals (less than 16 h), the\n      largest age difference between the offspring per pool was 1 calendar day\n      (<48 h difference in age).\n    \nCritical: It is important to not\n      overpopulate your vials. The flies should all be able to stand at the\n      bottom of the vial, therefore the number depends upon the size of the fly\n      and the size of the vial. In our experiments, we placed 50\n      D. melanogaster females in each vial and 25\n      D. mercatorum females in each vial.\n    \nNote: If the flies are highly",
    "parthenogenetic then fewer flies should be kept in each vial, we only\n      added 1 female per vial when screening a fully parthenogenetic strain.\n    \nNote: It may take several weeks to collect\n      sufficient virgins for an experiment. We recommend collecting 500–1000\n      females per experiment.\n    \nVirgin maintenance\nTiming: 1–4 h once a week for 6–22 weeks\n    \n      Virgin maintenance for the duration of the life of the flies. For the\n      species of Drosophila tested by Sperling et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n      facultative parthenogenesis occurs midway through the life of the fly.\n      Therefore, the flies need to be maintained for several months. The\n      temperature, humidity, and food all need to be controlled during this\n      time.\n    \nPlace the vials of virgin female flies at 18°C or at 25°C.\n        Weekly - transfer the virgin females into a new vial with fresh food.\n        Note: the food needs to be changed before it hardens and\n        separates from the side of the vial.\n        Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\n        \n            Keep the old food vial at the temperature the flies were maintained\n            at until two days longer than the time required for normal maximum\n            embryo development at that temperature.\n          \nNote: For D. melanogaster, the\n      incidence of parthenogenesis decreased with increased temperature1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n      and therefore, an optimal virgin maintenance temperature needs to be\n      selected.\n    \nCritical: If using a fly incubator,\n      the humidity needs to be maintained to prevent the animals from becoming\n      dehydrated and to prevent the food from drying and hardening.\n    \nCritical: The fly food needs to be\n      fresh. Many Drosophilae will diapause if they have not mated and\n      this effect is exacerbated by not having fresh food.\n    \nNote: There is evidence that there is\n      limited variation in the timing of embryogenesis in different\n      Drosophila species and for D. melanogaster where\n      embryogenesis takes approximately 1 day (24 h).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]",
    "We suggest adding 2 days to account for differences between species and\n      potential developmental delays that may arise (therefore, 3 days minimum).\n      In practice, we saved the old food vials for 5 days after the virgins were\n      transferred to their new food vial before screening for offspring.\n    \nParthenogenesis screening\nTiming: 1–4 h once a week for 6–22 weeks\n    \n      Screening for the incidence of parthenogenesis in food vials that were\n      used by the virgin females.\n    \n        Screen for offspring after the used food vials have been given\n        sufficient time to allow parthenogenesis to occur.\n        \n            Examine each vial closely with a dissecting microscope for dead\n            embryos or dead or living larvae.\n            Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\n          \n            Keep vials that show evidence of development to ensure that the\n            parthenogens have reached their final stage of development.\n            Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and\n            Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\n          \nNote: Screening for offspring should be\n      carried out before the vial is more than 7 days post virgin transfer to\n      prevent bacterial or fungal growth from compromising the interpretation of\n      the results.\n    \nNote: Dead embryos turn dark brown after\n      cuticle formation during embryonic development (stage 16 of\n      embryogenesis)."
