    "TMs designing.The TM molecules were designed empirically by adding 3-4 nucleotides into the complementary sequences between sites opposite to the 10th and 11th nt of the targeted miRNA. Keep the other position with base-paring to the miRNA.Note: Figure 1 shows an example for TM design.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160118/20160118003029_3137.pngFigure 1. Example for TM design. A. DNA sequence of TM for miRNA319 (TM319). B. Base paring of TM319 and Nbe-miR319.Red letters are nucleotides inserted in to the complementary sequences between sites opposite to the 10th and 11th nt (denoted by “-“).Cloning.The miRNA TM fragment was inserted into pTRV2e at LIC cassette as described in the previous study (Sha et al., 2014). Correct constructs were screened by PCR and must be confirmed by DNA sequencing.Plasmid extraction.Correct clones were grown in 2~5 ml liquid LB medium (containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin) at 37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h. Collect the bacteria and extract plasmids using Alkaline Lysis Method (Sambrook, 2001).Agrobacterium transformation.Transform pTRV1, pTRV2e or its derivatives into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (or GV2260) respectively. Grown for 2 days on solid LB media (containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin, 50 µg/ml Rifampicin) at 28 °C. Confirm that the Agrobacteria contain desired plasmid by PCR using specific primers and streak the correct transformants on LB plate.Preparation of Agro-infiltrates.Grow correct transformants containing pTRV1, pTRV2e or pTRV2e derivatives (Sha et al., 2014, Figure 1) in 5 ml liquid LB media respectively (containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin, 50 µg/ml Rifampicin) in 28 °C incubator shaking at 200 rpm overnight. Collect the culture media and adjust each Agrobacterium culture to OD600=1.0. Mix equal volume of Agrobacterium culture (OD600=1.0) of pTRV1 and that of pTRV2e or pTRV2e derivatives together. Pellet the mixed agrobacteria by centrifuging at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet with equal volume of infiltration buffer (to keep OD600 ≈1.0). Incubate the re-suspended agrobacteria at room temperature for 2.5-6 h.Note: Inoculating agrobacteria into media for culturing should be done on clean bench and all equipment used needs to be sterile. Plant infiltration.Select 6-leaf-stage plants for VbMS assay. Infiltrate the re-suspended agrobacteria into the abaxial side of 3-4 expanded leaves (avoid the midvein) with 1 ml needless syringe.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160118/20160118003130_7466.pngFigure 2. Schematic diagram of Agrobacterium infiltrationPlant growth and evaluation of miRNA silencing effects.Grow the infiltrated plants at 24 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod and the light intensity is 200 μmol m-2 s-1. In 2-3 weeks post inoculation the target miRNA will be silenced at the whole plant level. The newly developed organs will show phenotypes of strong silencing of the corresponding miRNA. These tissues can be used for appropriate experiments.Note: Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of infiltration procedure. Each leaf is often injected at 2-4 sites throughout the leaf lamina, each injection site has a diameter >1 cm."
