  "procedures": [
    "This protocol was conducted in accordance with the guiding principles of the Physiological Society of Japan and received approval from the Animal Care Committee of Kanazawa Medical University (2021-32). All procedures were conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Adult male C57BL/6J mice (3-6 months old) were utilized for the study, and it was previously confirmed that these mice exhibited the flight behaviors described in this manuscript15.\n1. Animal preparation\nGroup-house mice (3-4 per cage; maintained at 23-27 °C; under a 12 h light/dark cycle; provided ad libitum access to food and water) until the start of the experiments.\nIndividually house each mouse in a plexiglass cage (14 cm × 21 cm × 12 cm) for at least 3 days before undergoing this modified fear conditioning.\n2. Setting up the tools/equipment\nFear conditioning box (Figure 1A)\n\t\nUtilize a fear conditioning chamber (25 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm) enclosed in a sound-attenuating box (67 cm × 53 cm × 55 cm) (see Table of Materials).\nTwo contexts (A and B) are required. For context A, create black and white stripes on the walls by attaching white plastic cardboard with black tapes (3 cm width, 4 on a board). Use a white smooth plastic board for the floor.\nWipe the walls and floor with Heptanol (1%) before each session.\n\t\tNOTE: No active ventilation system is used. Cleaning with alcohol at the end of the session diminishes the Heptanol odor.\nFor context B, make the appearance of walls entirely black by removing the board used in context A. The floor is a grid floor.\n\t\tNOTE: No specific odor is presented other than a slight alcohol odor for cleaning.\nIlluminate the experimental box using an overhead white light-emitting diode (LED, 240 lux) (see Table of Materials).\nShocker",
    "Connect a scramble shocker (see Table of Materials) to a grid floor composed of stainless-steel rods. This is used to provide foot shocks.\nAudio generator\n\t\nPlace a speaker (see Table of Materials) on the ceiling. All acoustic stimuli are amplified.\nDigitally modify and calibrate the overall amplitudes of each stimulus to yield sound pressure levels (SPL, re: 20 µ Pa) at the 5 cm front of the speaker with a ¼ inch microphone. Present a continuous tone burst through this speaker.\n\t\tNOTE: Calibrating the sound speaker is crucial to examine the fine impact of sound stimulus on defensive behaviors during this modified fear conditioning.\nTransducer\n\t\nPlace the floor of the test chamber on a transducer (see Table of Materials) for the detection of vibration.The signal from the transducer is transmitted to a sound card with an 8 kHz sampling frequency to record the behavioral vibrations.\nVideo camera\n\t\nPosition a CMOS camera (see Table of Materials) on the ceiling to track the subject's motions and record the sound in the conditioning box.\nTriggering system\n\t\nUse sound software (see Table of Materials) for triggering tones or foot-shocks at scheduled timings.\n\t\tNOTE: Any commercially available stimulator will work for this.\n3. Behavioral experiment\nPlan for four days of fear conditioning procedures: habituation (1 day, 5 trials), conditioning (2 days, 5 trials each), and test/extinction sessions (1 day, 5 or 15 trials). The intertrial intervals varied between 60-75 s (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Preferably, include ten or more subjects in a group to obtain reliable behavioral tendencies. Two or three groups are required depending on the study's purpose.",
    "During the conditioning session, present the unconditioned stimulus (US) (1 s, 0.9 mA) immediately after the termination of the conditioned stimulus (CS) (continuous tone burst, 8 kHz, 20 s, 95 dB SPL) as shown in Figure 1B. Deliver five CS-US pairs in a conditioning day.\nAfter the termination of the 5th foot-shock, leave the subject in the context for 1 min before returning it to the home cage. Wipe the chamber with 70% alcohol for cleaning following each behavioral test.\n\t\tNOTE: CS and US intensity can be modified depending on the study's purpose. Previous reports have shown that stronger CS intensity triggers more active defensive behaviors than softer ones15. Conditioning days can also be extended.\nInduce flight behaviors during CS presentations following the schedule mentioned below.\n\tNOTE: A CS (95 dB SPL) and a US (0.9 mA) are used in this experiment.\n\t\nOn day 1, expose subjects to 5 CS alone trials in context A.\nOn days 2 and 3, condition subjects with 5 CS-US association trials in context B.\nOn day 4, expose subjects to 5 CS alone trials for the recall session in context B. In case of testing memory extinction, expose subjects to 15 CS alone trials.\n\t\t​NOTE: To test memory stability, extending extinction sessions for 2-3 days will help. Also, testing memory one week later instead of on day 4 can provide additional confirmation of memory stability.\n4. Analysis of defensive behaviors\nNOTE: Motion, percentage of freezing, and the number of jumps during CS presentations are analyzed. Details are described below. If possible, analyzing in a double-blind manner would be better.\nSynchronize the timings of events in the video and the timings of stimuli (CS and US) by using the tone onset recorded in the video.",
    "Utilize a custom-made code to calculate both the averaged and total motions of mice based on the difference in the center of mass of the subject silhouette across frames.\n\tNOTE: An arbitrary unit is used for this measurement since the speed of motion depends on the sampling rate of the movie.\nTo measure the percentage of freezing, use the transducer signal in time.\n\t\nPreprocess transducer signals using a 20-500 Hz band pass filter.\nCalculate the root mean square amplitude of the transducer signal in time for each 50 ms bin.\nSet a threshold for the signal amplitude to detect the immobility period. The duration of immobility is the signal period lower than the threshold for more than 1 s.\nManually measure the duration of freezing by watching the video.\nAdjust the threshold of signal amplitude for freezing by comparing the manually measured percentage of freezing and the percentage calculated from the transducer signal.\nCount the number of jumps manually from video files.\n\t​NOTE: Counting the number of darts will also be useful in assessing the flight response.\n5. Statistical analysis\nSet the statistical significance at p < 0.05.\nFor comparisons between multiple groups and multiple factors, conduct a multiway ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests. If a specific day of the conditioning schedule is tested, perform multiple comparison tests or permutation tests.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
