    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining\nTiming: [4–5 h]\nThis is a standard immunocytochemistry workflow for labeling proteins in fixed cells on glass coverslips with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores.\nSeed cells on coverslips and transfect if desired\nOn day one, passage cells according to standard protocol and seed at 30–50% confluency on 18 × 18 mm glass coverslips, No. 1.5. We maintain U2OS cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin and passage every 2–3 days.\nOn day two, cells should be 50–70% confluent. At this point they can be fixed for immunostaining of endogenous proteins, or transfected for transient overexpression of a fluorophore-tagged protein prior to fixation on day three.\nFor transfection of U2OS cells in a 6 cm dish, combine 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 12.5 μL of PEI solution (1 mg/mL) and 300 μL of serum-free DMEM. Vortex and leave at room temperature for 15 min.\nDrip the transfection solution onto the 5 mL of media in the dish and swirl to mix. Leave in incubator at 37°C for 18–20 h.\nFix cells\nRemove media and rinse cells 2× with 5 mL of warm PBS.\nAdd 5 mL of warm, freshly-prepared PFA Fixation Solution (4% PFA in PBS or buffer of choice) to the dish and let sit at 20°C–22°C for 10 min.\nRemove fixation buffer and rinse cells 2× with 5 mL of PBS.\nPermeabilize cells and block non-specific binding sites\nRemove PBS and add 5 mL of Permeabilization Solution (1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Let sit at 20°C–22°C for 10 min. This solution can be stored at 20°C–22°C for up to 3 months.\nRinse cells 2× with 5 mL of PBS.",
    "Using fine forceps, transfer coverslips to a Humidified Chamber (box lined with parafilm and containing damp paper towels to maintain humidity when lid is closed). Touch each coverslip carefully against a Kimwipe to remove excess liquid before placing cell side-up on the parafilm.\nGently pipette 50–100 μL freshly-prepared Blocking Buffer (PBS containing 1% goat serum and 0.1% Tween-20) on top of the cells, ensuring that the entire surface of the coverslip is covered.\nPlace lid on box and let sit at 20°C–22°C for 10 min.\nDuring the blocking step, prepare the primary and secondary antibody dilutions in Blocking Buffer. Clear by centrifuging at full speed (~21,000 × g) in a refrigerated microcentrifuge for 10 min to pellet any aggregates and store on ice.\nImmunostain cells (all steps are done sequentially)\nPick up each coverslip and gently touch the edge to a Kimwipe to drain off excess blocking buffer, then pipette 50–100 μL of primary antibody solution (prepared in Blocking Buffer) on top, ensuring that the entire surface is covered. Place lid on box and leave for 1 h at 20°C–22°C. Note that if the volume of antibody solution is limited, the coverslips can instead be inverted (placed cell side-down) on top of a 20–50 μL drop of antibody solution.\nUse forceps to transfer each coverslip to a well in a 6-well plate. Rinse 3 × 5 min with 2 mL PBS.\nRemove coverslip from well using forceps, touch edge to Kimwipe to drain off excess PBS and set cell side-up on parafilm inside humidified chamber. Gently pipette 50–100 μL of secondary antibody solution (prepared in Blocking Buffer) on top, ensuring that the entire coverslip is covered. Place lid on box and leave for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nTransfer coverslips back to 6-well plate and repeat PBS wash steps.",
    "Repeat these primary and secondary antibody incubation steps (with washes) for additional targets, if desired, ensuring that there is no potential species cross-reactivity.\nTo stain endogenous proteins, we use the relevant primary antibodies at the same concentration that we use for standard immunofluorescence analysis. We detect them using species-specific Alexa Fluor® Plus 488 or 555-conjugated secondary antibodies at a higher concentration than normal (1:250 dilution, which is 8 μg/mL). If a Far red fluorophore is required, we use CF633-conjugated secondary antibodies, as this dye is compatible with ExM.\nTo amplify the signal of GFP-tagged proteins, we use a chicken anti-GFP polyclonal primary antibody (1:500 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody (1:500 dilution).\nTo amplify the signal of RFP-tagged proteins, we use a rat anti-RFP monoclonal primary antibody (1:500 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor® Plus 555-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution).\nNote: Genetically encoded fluorophores can be imaged directly, provided a sufficiently strong signal is retained following anchoring/gelation/digestion. Another option is the ProExM (protein-retention expansion) technique, which employs a less robust homogenization step that better preserves direct fluorescent signals and achieves ~4.5-fold expansion (Tillberg et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: Although formaldehyde is used here, ExM is also compatible with workflows that utilize alternate fixatives such as methanol and glutaraldehyde (Truckenbrodt et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPause Point: Cells can be stored for 1–3 days after fixation (in PBS at 4°C) prior to permeabilization and immunostaining.\nAnchoring\nTiming: [10 min setup, overnight incubation]\nIn this step, the succinimidyl ester of Acryloyl-X reacts with proteins in the fixed/stained cells, adding an acrylate group that integrates into the polylacrylamide matrix to anchor the proteins to the gel.",
    "Prepare (or thaw) Anchoring Reagent Stock (10 mg/mL Acryloyl-X in anhydrous DMSO) and dilute to 0.1 mg/mL in PBS pH7.4. This is the Anchoring Solution.\nDrain excess PBS from coverslips and place cell side-up on the parafilm in the humidified chamber. Gently pipette an 80 μL drop of Anchoring Solution on top, ensuring that the entire surface is covered.\nPlace lid on humidified chamber and incubate 18–20 h at 20°C–22°C.\nTransfer coverslips back to 6-well plate and wash 3 × 5 min with PBS.\nCritical: Anchoring Reagent Stock should be stored in a dessicator at −20°C and can be kept for up to 3 months. We store it in 0.1 mL aliquots to avoid freeze-thawing cycles.\nGelation\nTiming: [4 hrs]\nIn this step, a gelation solution of monomers is poured across the fixed/stained/anchored cells and allowed to polymerize into a swellable hydrogel.\nPrepare the Gelation Solution in a fume hood, weighing all components using a micro-balance and adding them in this order:\nWeigh out 1.335 g of DMAA and place in a 50 mL conical bottom tube.\nWeigh out 0.32 g of Sodium Acrylate, add to the tube and vortex.\nWeigh out 2.85 g of ddH2O, add to the tube and vortex. The solution may be slightly turbid, but there should be no visible granules.\nPurge the O2 in the Gelation Solution by bubbling with N2 for 40 min at 20°C–22°C. This is most easily done using a nitrogen evaporator, as it offers a controlled bubbling rate (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Purging O2 from the gelation solution",
    "We use a nitrogen evaporator for this step, as it offers a controlled rate of bubbling (A). First, the gel solution in a 50 mL conical tube is purged at 20°C–22°C for 40 min. For purging of the smaller aliquot with added KPS in a 15 mL conical tube for 15 min, the tube is kept on ice throughout (B). In both cases, the top of the tube is sealed with parafilm to minimize re-oxygenation. When setting up the evaporator, adjust the flow rate carefully using a tube of ddH2O before transferring to the gel solution (C). The needles should be carefully cleaned before and after use.\nPrepare Potassium Persulfate (KPS) Solution by weighing out 0.036 g KPS and placing it in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Immediately before use, add 1 mL of ddH2O and vortex for 1–2 min.\nTransfer 2.7 mL of purged Gelation Solution to a 15 mL conical bottom tube. Add 0.3 mL of KPS Solution and quickly vortex for 1–3 s.\nPurge the O2 in the Gelation Solution by bubbling with N2 for 15 min ON ICE. Keep on ice from this step onwards.\nDuring this 2nd purging step, prepare the Gelation Chambers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setting up the gelation chamber\nSteps 1–8 walk through the set-up of a gelation chamber for a single 18 × 18 mm coverslip containing fixed/stained/anchored cells.\nPlace a glass slide on a sheet of paper towel. This will be the base of the chamber.\nPlace 2 blank coverslips (18 × 18 mm, No 1.5) on the slide, a coverslip-width apart (with a drop of water under each to secure it to the slide).",
    "Pick up one of the stained/anchored coverslips, touching it carefully against a Kimwipe to remove excess liquid before placing it cell-side up between the 2 blank coverslips on the slide (moving them inwards to ensure that the cell-containing coverslip is secured tightly between them).\nCarefully place another blank coverslip (18 × 18 mm, No 1.5) on the left side of the cell-containing coverslip, securing it with a drop of water and allowing it to overlap the cells by ~3 mm. Repeat on the right side. These coverslips act as spacers.\nTransfer 500 μL of the Gelation Solution to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 2 μL of TEMED, vortex 1–3 s, pipette 75 μL on top of the cell-containing coverslip and carefully lower a 22 × 22 mm, No 2 coverslip on top, pushing gently to force out any air bubbles.\nAllow gels to polymerize for 2–3 h by incubating the Gelation Chambers at 20°C–22°C in a Humidified Chamber. For issues with gelation, see Troubleshooting section.",
    "To remove the gel from the Gelation Chamber, use fine forceps to gently pry up the top coverslip. We use a larger (22 × 22) and thicker (No 2) coverslip on top, as it is easier to handle and less prone to cracking. Sliding a scalpel blade lengthwise under the edge and gently levering the coverslip upwards can also help to avoid breakage. The gel usually remains attached to the top coverslip (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Transfer the coverslip to a 35 mm dish, with the gel facing up. In the event that the gel remains attached to the original coverslip, carefully prise that coverslip off the slide and put it in the 35 mm dish with the gel facing up. Note that in either case, the gel will separate from the coverslip during the subsequent digestion step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Digestion and expansion of the gel following removal from the gelation chamber",
    "(A). When the top coverslip is removed from the Gelation Chamber following polymerization, the gel usually remains attached to it (A). Place the coverslip gel side-up in a 35 mm dish. If the gel stays on the original coverslip, transfer that coverslip gel side-up to a 35 mm dish. Once the digestion buffer is added, the lid should be secured to the dish using parafilm to prevent evaporation and the dish transferred to a humidified chamber containing a damp tissue. Seal the chamber and place it in a water bath set to 50°C (B). Close the lid and leave 18–20 h. Transfer the digested gel to a 10 cm Petri dish (C). At this point we normally observe some initial expansion (D). Add ddH2O with Hoechst dye to start expansion/DNA staining. After ~1 h (and at least 3 changes of ddH2O), the gel will be significantly larger than the original coverslip, which is shown on top of it for comparison (E).\nCritical: Once KPS is added to the Gelation Solution, the solution needs to be kept on ice at all times to prevent premature polymerization. We keep a box of pipette tips at 4°C, to use for step 15 (addition of TEMED and gel pouring).\nDigestion\nTiming: [10 min setup, overnight incubation]\nIn this step, the proteolytic enzyme proteinase K is used to digest structural proteins in the hydrogel-embedded cells to remove any resistance to expansion that could lead to distortion or rupture of the sample.\nPrepare (or thaw) Digestion Buffer (50 mM Tris, 800 mM guanidine HCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in ddH2O, pH 8.0) and add Proteinase K at 8 U/mL. This is the Digestion Solution.",
    "Add 2 mL of Digestion Solution to each 35 mm dish containing a gel. Use a strip of parafilm to seal the lid to the dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlace the dishes in a Humidified Chamber for 18–20 h incubation at 50°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). We use a glass container with an air-lock lid and carefully place it in a 50°C water bath so that the lower third of the container is submerged (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The digestion step may need to be optimized if ruptures or distortions are observed in the gels or if the retained fluorescent signal is weak (see Troubleshooting section).\nNote: Digestion Buffer can be stored at −20°C for up to 6 months. Proteinase K can be stored at 2°C–8°C for up to 2 years.\nExpansion and DNA staining\nTiming: [10 min setup, overnight incubation]\nIn this step, immersion in ddH2O washes out the ions in the gel matrix that have kept it constricted through ionic interactions, allowing up to 10-fold isotropic expansion. Inclusion of the intercalating dye Hoechst 33342 stains nuclear DNA during expansion.\nRemove gel from Digestion Solution by inverting the 35 mm dish onto a 100 mm dish (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nPrepare sufficient Expansion/Staining Buffer (2 μL of 25 mg/mL Hoechst 33342 stock in 30 mL ddH2O) for the number of gels to be processed (10 mL per dish).\nAdd the Expansion/Staining Buffer to the 100 mm dish with the gel and incubate for 20 min at 20°C–22°C (can monitor nuclear staining and expansion using an inverted fluorescence microscope).\nCarefully remove the Expansion/Staining Buffer from the dish and replace with ddH2O.\nContinue to incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30–40 min, with at least 3 changes of water, until no further expansion is observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).",
    "Note: For solution changes, a pipette can be used to carefully remove liquid from the dish. Tilt the dish to keep the gel away from the tip while suctioning. The gel is fairly resilient, so if it is partially suctioned into the tip, just expel it slowly.\nPause Point: Expanded gels can be transferred to PBS for storage at 4°C for up to a week (re-swell before imaging by washing 3× with ddH2O for at least 30 min).\nGel excision\nTiming: [5 min setup]\nIn this step, a custom 3D-printed gel cutter is used to excise gel segments that fit snugly into a glass-bottom chambered slide to prevent movement during imaging.\nTo excise gel segments for imaging, first remove all of the ddH2O from the 100 mm dish.\nWe use a 3D-printed custom Gel Cutter (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) to excise segments that are the internal dimensions of an ibidi 8-well μ-Slide (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The cutter was designed using Freecad (.FCStd and .stl files provided as Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Mmc1.zip]) and took 4 h to print using a fine tip nozzle (see Note below). A less robust cutter can be printed in 40 min using a normal nozzle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Excision of gel segments for imaging",
    "(A). Diagram of the custom 3D printed gel cutter and pusher. Press the gel cutter firmly down on the gel until it touches the bottom of the plate, and then use a scalpel to slice from the cutter to the edge of the gel so that it can be moved carefully to a clear section of the dish for removal (B). If the segment remains in the cutter when it is lifted from the dish, the pusher can be used to eject it. Using a bent metal spatula to handle the gel segment (C), transfer it carefully to an ibidi μ-Slide 8 Well Chambered Coverslip (D). If a gel cutter is not available, another option is to use the top of a P1000 pipette tip as a gel punch (E), transferring the round segment to the ibidi chambered coverslip (F and G). Although not as snug a fit as the segments excised using the custom cutter (which match the internal dimensions of the well), movement of the gel segment during imaging can be minimized by removing any excess liquid from the well (H and I).\nLower the Gel Cutter onto the expanded gel and push down firmly until it touches the bottom of the dish. Use a scalpel blade to cut from the Gel Cutter to the edge of the gel so that the segment can be removed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). If the segment remains in the cutter, it can be gently pushed out using the 3D-printed Gel Pusher (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). After use, we clean and store the Gel Cutter with the Gel Pusher inserted in it, to protect the cutting edge from damage.\nSlide a bent metal spatula blade under the gel segment and lift it out of the dish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).",
    "Lower the gel segment into a well of the ibidi 8-well μ-Slide (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) and adjust so that it is aligned and fills the well (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H–4I).\nRepeat for a second well, but this time invert the gel segment. This ensures that one of the 2 wells that you set up will have the gel segment in the correct orientation (cell-side down) for imaging with a high resolution/short working distance objective.\nUsing the microscope system of your choice, identify which well has the gel segment in the correct orientation. If you cannot bring the Hoechst-stained nuclei into focus using a high resolution/short working distance objective, the gel is upside-down (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Note that this is not an issue when using a lower resolution/longer working distance objective.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/756-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Imaging expansion gels",
    "When using a lower magnification objective with a longer working distance, the orientation of the cells embedded in the gel with respect to the bottom of the well is not critical (A). The increase in size and observable detail is demonstrated here by imaging U2OS cells pre- and post-expansion using a Zeiss AxioObserver D1 widefield system with a 20×/0.8 NA air objective. In addition to the Hoechst-stained DNA (blue), the cells express GFP-G3BP2, boosted by staining with anti-GFP and AlexaFluor488 secondary antibodies (green), which has accumulated in cytoplasmic stress granules due to sodium arsenite treatment. Nucleoli have been stained using anti-fibrillarin (1:50 dilution) and AlexaFluor555 secondary antibodies (red). When using a higher magnification objective with a much shorter working distance, the cells embedded in the gel can only be brought into focus if they are lying directly on the bottom of the well (B). More detail can be observed for smaller structures (in this case, nuclear stress foci at which GFP-tagged RepoMan accumulates in response to sodium arsenite treatment) following expansion when a 60×/1.4 NA oil objective is used on a DeltaVision Core restoration deconvolution system. The white boxes mark the regions that have been enlarged to demonstrate the increased detail. Although this is already super-resolution imaging, we routinely combine ExM with Airyscan imaging on a Zeiss LSM880 laser confocal scanning system, which provides a further increase in resolution (C). Volume rendering of the 3D z-stacks using Imaris helps to visualize the nuclear substructure (D), confirming that nuclear stress foci (containing GFP-RepoMan, green) overlap and are surrounded by localized accumulations of the heterochromatic epigenetic histone marker H3K9me3 (1:50 dilution; red; E).",
    "Note: If you do not have access to a 3D printer, the top opening of a P1000 pipette tip can also be used to excise gel segments that fit in an ibidi 8-well μ-Slide (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E–4G. The fit is not as snug (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H–4I), so be sure to remove excess liquid to minimize gel movement during imaging.\nNote: If imaging for a long time, add a small amount of ddH2O to the excised gel slice in the well to ensure that it does not dry out. Excised gel slices can be stored in PBS at 4°C for a week (re-swell before imaging by washing 3× with ddH2O for at least 30 min).",
    "Note: A Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)-based 3D printer was used to print the cutter and the pusher using 1.75 mm Polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The cutter STL model was sliced in the vertical orientation with the cutting end pointing upwards. For printing, the best results were obtained using a 0.2 mm printer nozzle, 0.05 mm layer height, 0.6 mm walls and 0.6 mm top and bottom thickness, and 15% infill. On our printer, print time was approximately 4 hours with these settings. The pusher STL model was also sliced vertically but printed using a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layer height (all other settings were the same). Print time for the pusher was approximately 30 minutes. As not all printers have the options to change nozzle and printing material, other common settings were also tested. Printing the cutter using a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.1 mm layer height will produce a workable cutter; however the cutting edge is not as sharp. With these printer settings, the cutter and the pusher can be printed together in approximately 3 hours. We also printed the cutter using Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) filament. Cutters printed with PETG were durable using 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm nozzles whereas the cutting edge of cutters printed with ABS was fragile and snapped easily with the 0.2 mm nozzle, and rigid enough for use but still brittle with the 0.4 mm nozzle.\nImaging\nTiming: [varies]\nHere we describe imaging of expansion gels using a standard widefield system, a restoration deconvolution system and a confocal system with a higher resolution imaging mode",
    "The expansion gels can be imaged using your fluorescence imaging system of choice, bearing in mind that the orientation of the gel (i.e. cell-side down) is critical when using high resolution/short working distance objectives. As shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, gels could be imaged in either orientation using a Zeiss AxioObserver D1 widefield system with a 20×/0.8 NA air objective. The combination of ExM with this relatively simple system already provides a significant increase in the amount of detail that can be observed.\nWhen using a shorter working distance oil objective (60×/1.4 NA) on a DeltaVision Core restoration deconvolution system, the embedded cells can only be brought into focus when oriented toward the bottom of the chambered slide (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). For the small nuclear foci that we wanted to resolve, expansion allowed us to observe a much higher level of detail.\nWe routinely acquire very high resolution images of our ExM samples using a Zeiss LSM880 AxioObserver Z1 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective in Airyscan mode. For the image shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, the multichannel Z-stack had a pixel size of 0.04 μm x 0.04 μm x 0.14 μm and the dwell time per pixel was 1.21 μs, with no averaging. The 405 nm, 488 nm and 561 nm lasers were used at 2% power.",
    "For 3D visualization of the Z-stacks (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D), we use Imaris 9.6.0 (Bitplane). The images are first processed by background subtraction to ease the rendering steps. A 3D surface rendering for each channel is then created, using a smoothing of 2× the pixel size (0.08 μm), a threshold for background subtraction of the diameter of the smallest nucSF (~0.35 μm in this case) and a surface filter to keep only the more specific regions of the image. This allowed us to confirm that the histone modification signal (anti-H3K9me3, red) spreads out and around the centers of the nuclear stress foci marked by accumulations of GFP-RepoMan (green), as shown in the enlarged inset (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E; (Do et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])).\nOptional: To assess distortion, the same region/structural component in a cell is compared directly in images taken pre- and post-expansion. To do this, it is necessary to excise a smaller segment of the gel, e.g. using a scalpel blade, so that it can be expanded directly in the same imaging chamber (we use a 35 mm glass-bottom dish). This should be done when testing the protocol for the first time, and whenever any deformations or cracks are observed."
