    "NOTE: Figure 1 provides a summary of key steps in the iterative selection-amplification (SELEX) process.\n1. Generation of a random library template\nSynthesize the forward primer 5’- GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGATCAGATTCTGATCCA-3’ and the reverse primer 5’- GCGACGGATCCAAGCTTCA-3’ by chemical synthesis on a DNA synthesizer.\n\tNOTE: The primers and the random library can be synthesized commercially.\nSynthesize a random library oligonucleotide template 5’- GGTGATCAGATTCTGATCCA(N1…N31)TGAAGCTTGGATCCGTCGC-3’ by chemical synthesis. Use an equimolar mixture of four phosphoramidites during synthesis for the 31 randomized positions shown above as N.\n\tNOTE: The sequence of the library template contains 31 random nucleotides (N1 to N31) and flanking sequences for the binding of the forward and reverse primers. The forward primer includes the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (underlined) for in vitro transcription and a restriction site Bcl1 (italicized) for cloning. The reverse primer contains restriction enzyme sites BamH1 and HindIII (italicized) to facilitate cloning.\n2. Generation of the DNA random library pool\nAttach the T7 RNA polymerase promoter to the library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing 1 µM DNA random library template, 1 µM of each primer, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 µg/µL acetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 200 µM each of dNTPs (deoxyguanosine, deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, and deoxythymidine triphosphate).\nUse five cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension steps (94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) of PCR followed by one cycle of extension (72 °C for 10 min).\n3. Synthesis of pool 0 RNA",
    "Set up a 100 µL transcription reaction12. Mix T7 transcription buffer, 1 µM random library pool DNA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 1 mM each of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and uridine triphosphate (UTP), and 2 units/µL T7 RNA polymerase.\n\tNOTE: RNA can be transcribed in vitro using commercially available kits with an option of the T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase.\nIncubate the above reaction mixture in a microcentrifuge tube for 2 h at 37 °C.\nGel purify RNA in a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\nIdentify location of the transcripts on the gel by staining it with methylene blue or autoradiography by including traces of radioactivity (0.5 µL or less of α-32P UTP) in the transcription reaction.\n\t\nPlace the gel slice in a centrifuge tube and break into smaller pieces, for example, with a homogenizer tip. Add proteinase K (PK) buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM EDTA, 1% Sodium dodecyl sulfate) to immerse the gel pieces. Leave the tube on a nutator from 2 h to overnight at room temperature.\nSpin in a high-speed microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm or 16,873 x g) for 5 min at room temperature to remove the gel debris and recover the buffer solution.\nVortex the sample two times with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform and one time with chloroform.\nMix the aqueous phase from above with one-tenth volume of sodium acetate (3.0 M, pH 5.2), 10 µg of tRNA or 20 µg of glycogen, and ethanol (2–3 volumes, stored at -20 °C). Leave the tubes at -80 °C for 1 h.",
    "Spin the tubes containing the solution for 5–10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm or 16,873 x g). Discard the supernatant carefully. Rinse the RNA pellet with 70% ethanol and spin for 2–5 min. Aspirate ethanol carefully. Air dry the RNA pellet.\nSolubilize the RNA pellet in 50 µL of water treated with of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). Leave the sample at -20 °C for storage.\n\tNOTE: Purify the RNA using commercially available spin columns, which are currently more commonly used to remove unincorporated radioactivity and serve as a quick and more convenient alternative for RNA purification.\n\tCAUTION: Use an acrylic glass shield, gloves, and other precautions to protect from radioactivity.\n4. Protein binding reaction and separation of bound RNA\nCarry out binding of protein and RNA in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 in a volume of 100 µL by adding the following ingredients to these final concentrations: 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.09 µg/µL bovine serum albumin, 0.5 units/µL RNasin, 0.15 µg/µL tRNA, 1 mM EDTA, and 30 µL of appropriate recombinant protein (PTB) concentration. Add RNA from the appropriate pool.\n\tNOTE: The splicing factor U2AF65 typically binds to the polypyrimidine-tract/3’ splice sites of model introns with a binding affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant or Kd) of approximately 1–10 nM. Therefore, the first two rounds of binding used protein concentration 10-fold above the Kd for U2AF65; for SXL and PTB proteins, the starting concentration in this range was only our best guess. This ensured that desired RNA species that could bind, although lower affinity sequences also potentially bound. In rounds 3 and 4 (transcription, binding, and amplification), the protein concentration was reduced three-fold (Step 4.1). This was done to successively eliminate low affinity RNA species.",
    "Place the tubes containing the binding reactions for about 30 min at 25 °C in a temperature block (or on ice).\nFractionate the bound RNA from the unbound RNA for the first 4 rounds of selection-amplification using the following steps.\n\t\nFilter the sample (100 µL) at room temperature through a nitrocellulose filter attached to a vacuum manifold.\n\t\tNOTE: The RNA-protein complex, but not the unbound RNA, remains on the filter.\nChop the filter with retained RNA into fragments with a sterile razor blade; insert these into a centrifuge tube. Recover RNA by tumbling the tube gently for a minimum of 3 h (or overnight) with filter pieces immersed in the proteinase K (PK) buffer.\nDeproteinize the RNA sample by vortexing it in the presence of an equal volume of phenol-chloroform (1:1) and then of chloroform. Recover the aqueous phase each time by centrifuging the sample at high speed for 5 min at room temperature.\nMix it with sodium acetate (0.1 volume of 3.0 M, pH 5.2) and ethanol (2–3 volumes of absolute ethanol, 200 proof). Leave the tube in a -80 °C freezer for 30 min, centrifuge it at high speed for 10 min, and, following the washing and drying steps (step 3.8), solubilize the RNA in water treated with DEPC. These steps are outlined above (steps 3.6 to 3.9).\nSeparate the protein-bound RNA fractions from the unbound fractions for the last 2 rounds (rounds 5 and 6; transcription, binding, and amplification) as follows. Reduce the protein concentration in the binding reaction (step 4.1) by further three-fold for additional selection pressure to enrich high-affinity binding sequences and preferentially remove low-affinity sequences.",
    "Pre-cast a native polyacrylamide gel (5% with 60:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio) in 0.5x TBE buffer (Tris-Borate-EDTA) prior to setting up the above RNA:protein-binding (step 4.1) reaction. Electrophorese this gel in a cold room (4 °C) by applying 250 V for 15 min.\nPipette the above RNA:protein binding reactions (step 4.1) into different wells of this gel.\n\t\tNOTE: The protein is stored at -80 °C and diluted prior to use in 20 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.05% NP-40, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Addition of 0.5–1.0 mM protease inhibitor phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) is optional. In the binding reaction, this buffer contributes about 6% glycerol, which allows direct loading of samples into the wells without the need for mixing them with a separate gel-loading buffer.\nFractionate the bound RNA from the unbound RNA using gel electrophoresis in a cold room (4 °C) at 250 V for 1 to 2 h. This process is also known as gel mobility shift assay.\n\t\tNOTE: Duration of electrophoresis varies depending on features of the RNA and protein used for binding.\nExpose the gel to an X-ray film and identify the location of the bound RNA using autoradiography. Cut out the gel slice with the bound RNA and insert it into a tube.\nIncubate the crushed gel slice in the PK buffer used for elution for 3 h or overnight.\nRepeat steps 3.5 to 3.9 outlined above. Briefly, vortex the eluted RNA sample vigorously first with phenol-chloroform and then with chloroform.",
    "Mix sodium acetate and ethanol with the aqueous phase after chloroform extraction. Following incubation in -80 °C freezer, spin at 4 °C for 5–10 min to collect the RNA pellet. Wash the RNA pellet with ethanol and air dry it by leaving the lid of the tube open. Dissolve the RNA in water treated with DEPC.\n\t\tNOTE: Switching to the gel mobility shift assay for fractionation allows elimination of unwanted RNA species that might have been enriched for binding, for example, to the nitrocellulose filter here (or any matrix) used in the initial rounds for fractionation.\n5. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification\nSynthesize cDNA from the dissolved RNA using reverse transcriptase and the reverse primer by incubating the 20 µL reaction (2 µL of 10x RT Buffer, 2 µL of AMV reverse transcriptase, 1 µM reverse primer, 10 µL of RNA, RNase inhibitor optional) at 42 °C for 60 min.\nAmplify the cDNA using 20–25 PCR cycles as described in step 2.1.\n6. Transcription and protein binding\nRepeat the process of RNA synthesis, protein binding, separation of protein bound and unbound fraction, as described in section 3–5 above.\n7. Analysis of RNA-protein interactions\nUse the gel mobility shift assay (step 4.4) or the filter binding assay (step 4.3) to determine binding affinity and specificity for selected pools or individual sequences within each pool (see step 8.3).\nUse autoradiography or a phosphor imager to detect and quantify bands in the bound fraction and unbound fraction.\n8. Cloning and sequencing\nDigest the final PCR DNA product with restriction enzymes Bcl1 and HindIII for 1–2 h, ligate with the appropriately digested pGEM3 or other plasmids carrying the restriction sites from 2 h to overnight, transform the ligation product into competent bacterial cells by heat shock or electroporation using standard molecular biology procedures13.",
    "Grow bacteria overnight by plating the transformed cells on agar plates with Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and ampicillin (50 µg/mL) at 37 °C. Pick colonies to inoculate culture tubes containing LB liquid medium with ampicillin and grow at 37 °C in a shaking incubator overnight. Purify plasmid DNAs containing DNA inserts using a standard plasmid isolation protocol13.\n\tNOTE: Commercial kits are available for plasmid purification.\nSequence the plasmids with DNA inserts using the dideoxy chain termination sequencing protocol, following manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing14.\n\tNOTE: Sequencing can be performed in house or done commercially.\n9.
