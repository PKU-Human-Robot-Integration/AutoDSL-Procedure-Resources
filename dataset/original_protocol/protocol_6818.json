    "SurgeryTo fix the plastic head holder (Figure 6) and recording chambers (Figure 3) to the monkey’s skull, surgery is performed under general anesthesia and sterile conditions.Monkeys are anesthetized by intravascular injection of ketamine HCI (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (1–2 mg/kg) with atropine sulfate hydrate (0.02 mg/kg), and are maintained under general anesthesia by intravascular injection of pentobarbital sodium (25 mg/kg). Buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg) is given as an analgesic.The head holder and recording chambers are embedded in dental acrylic resin, which covers the top of the skull and is firmly anchored to the skull by plastic cortical screws (Figure 5).A part of the skull inside the recording chamber is removed to introduce a microelectrode into the brain via the dura.After the surgery, the monkeys are administered cefazolin sodium (20 mg/kg/day) and buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.01 mg/kg) for one week to avoid infection and pain, respectively. The monkeys are allowed to recover for more than 14 days after surgery. Experiments are started only after the monkeys have completely recovered.The inside of the chamber is cleaned daily with povidone iodine solution and sterilized saline.The chamber is covered when single-unit recording or cleaning is not being conducted.Behavioral taskA monkey sits in a monkey chair (Figure 8) facing a computer monitor in a sound-attenuated and electrically shielded room.The monkey chair is placed inside a steel frame (Figure 9), and the monkey’s head is fixed to two bars attached to the top of the steel frame (see Figure 1 for the configurations of the monkey, monkey chair, steel frame, and computer monitor).A hot mirror is placed in front of the monkey’s eyes at an appropriate angle, such that an infrared camera attached above can capture a reflected image of the monkey’s pupils (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3987/bioprotoc-11-08-3987-g010.jpgFigure 10.

    "A hot mirror is placed in front of the monkey’s eyes at an appropriate angle, such that an infrared camera attached above can capture a reflected image of the monkey’s pupils. A liquid reward is delivered into the monkey’s mouth through a pipe.Eye position is detected using an infrared eye tracking system.A button is set in front of the monkey’s right or left hand (Figure 8).Events of behavioral tasks (Figure 2B and 2C), such as the presentation of visual object stimuli and the delivery of a liquid reward, are controlled by the TEMPO experimental control system (Figure 1).The TEMPO experimental control system generates visual stimuli and presents them on the computer monitor toward which the monkey is facing.The TEMPO experimental control system controls a reward system to deliver a liquid reward into the monkey’s mouth through a stainless-steel pipe (Figures 1 and 10).Monkey’s behavior, such as eye position and button press/release, are also monitored using the TEMPO experimental control system (Figure 1).Task training scheduleTo allow the monkeys to perform the economic decision-making task (Figure 2A), we first use two visual stimuli that have easily distinguishable visual features and are associated with different amounts of liquid reward. The two visual stimuli are sequentially presented in a random order. The monkey is required to learn the task structure, i.e., to choose the first stimulus by releasing the button during its presentation or the second stimulus by continuing to press the button during the presentation of the first stimulus, in addition to the associations between these two stimuli and the reward amounts. Once the monkey continuously chooses the stimulus associated with the larger reward in at least 90% of trials, we proceed to the next step. This training takes approximately 1 month.",
    "Once the monkey has learned the task structure, we replace the visual stimuli with two of the fractal images shown at the bottom of Figure 2A. After the monkey learns to continuously choose one of the fractal images associated with the larger reward in at least 90% of trials, we add a new fractal image to the visual stimuli set. Once the monkey’s choice rate of the new image becomes larger than the choice rate of the existing images associated with smaller rewards and becomes smaller than the choice rate of those associated with larger rewards, we add another new fractal image. This procedure is repeated until all of the six fractal images have been added. This training takes approximately 3 weeks.We continue to train the monkey using the six fractal images until the daily choice rate of each image does not largely fluctuate for at least 2 weeks. We do not set a specific criterion for the range in choice rate fluctuation, but it is approximately ±10%. This training takes approximately 2 months.Single-unit recordingBefore single-unit recording experiments, monkeys undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine the location of targeted brain areas (Figure 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3987/bioprotoc-11-08-3987-g011.jpgFigure 11. Coronal view of the brain and recording chambers obtained by MRI. The recording chambers are visualized by filling with ointment. Two of the recording chambers target the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in both hemispheres (red shows the location of the right SNc/VTA). The chambers are tilted laterally by 35°, which maximizes the passing distance of a recording electrode in the SNc/VTA, thereby enabling collection of a larger amount of single-unit recording data in these brain regions. Grid lines indicate the distance (millimeters) from (0, 0), the center of the chamber’s surface.",
    "A10, anteroposterior distances from the interaural line = 10 mm.Apparatuses for single-unit recording, such as microelectrodes, stainless-steel guide tubes (Figure 7), and recording grids (Figure 4), are sterilized with ethanol and/or chlorhexidine solution and washed with sterilized saline.The microelectrode is inserted into the guide tube, which come as a set attached to an oil-driven micromanipulator (see Figure 12 for the configurations of the microelectrode, guide tube, and oil-driven micromanipulator). The oil-driven micromanipulator is attached to a hand-driven micromanipulator fixed at one of the bars of the steel frame (Figure 13).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3987/bioprotoc-11-08-3987-g012.jpgFigure 12.

Hand-driven micromanipulator fixed at one of the bars of the steel frameRecording sites are determined using the recording grid, which is attached to the recording chamber and allows recordings at every 1 mm between penetrations (Figures 4 and 11).The microelectrode is introduced into the brain through the stainless-steel guide tube, which is inserted into one of the grid holes and then into the brain via the dura by the oil-driven micromanipulation (see Figure 13 for the configurations of all apparatuses).Single-unit potentials are amplified and band-pass filtered (100–8 kHz) using a multi-channel processor (MCP Plus 8), and isolated online using a voltage–time window discrimination system (ASD) (Figure 14). A 50/60 Hz electric noise is removed by a noise eliminator (HumBug). The time of occurrence of each spike recorded from a single-unit is stored at a 1-ms resolution in the TEMPO experimental control system (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3987/bioprotoc-11-08-3987-g014.jpgFigure 14. Single-unit spikes isolated by a voltage–time window discrimination system (ASD). ASD isolates single-unit spikes by window-discrimination and template-matching procedures.",
    "The two blue vertical lines indicate the windows that discriminate the spikes of a single-unit from those of other single-units and electric noises. The eight blue points define the template of the spike waveform. If the distance between the waveform of each spike and the template is smaller than the detection threshold, the waveform will be regarded as matching the template."
