  "procedures": [
    "All protocols using animals have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The tumor fragments, around 1−2 mm3 in size, are from viably frozen stock obtained from the Patient-Derived Xenograft and Advanced In Vivo Models Core at Baylor College of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of cryopreserved mammary tumor fragments for transplantation\nTransfer the cryovial with tumor fragments from liquid nitrogen to a 37 °C water bath.\nAgitate the cryovial with an occasional gentle flick during thawing.\nAfter the tissue is thawed, take the cryovial out of water bath and mix by gentle inversion.\nDry off the outside of the cryovial and spray with 70% ethanol. Transfer it to a biosafety hood.\nTransfer the thawed tumor tissues into a 15 mL conical tube filled with 10 mL of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Mix well by inverting the tube. Allow the tissue fragments to settle to the bottom of the tube.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of cold DMEM. Mix well by inverting the tube. Allow the tissue fragments to settle to the bottom of the tube.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of cold DMEM. Place the tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: The tissue is ready for transplantation.\n2. Collection and preparation of fresh mammary tumor for transplantation\nEuthanize the breast tumor-bearing mouse.\n\tNOTE: PDX host may be SCID/Beige, NSG or NRG female mice while in the current study female Balb/c mice aged 3−5 weeks are used.\nSpray the tumor region of the euthanized mouse with 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Try to avoid hair with the tumor sample which might cause contamination of tumor fragments for cryostorage or transplantation.\nWith serrated forceps to pinch and lift up the skin surrounding the tumor, use scissors to make a short incision.",
    "Separate the tumor from the skin with the scissors to dissect the whole tumor from the host mouse. Trim off any remaining mouse fat pad tissue from the outer surface of the tumor. Place the tumor in a 15 mL conical tube filled with 5 mL of cold DMEM.\n\tNOTE: Use tumors at a maximum size of 1 cm diameter since larger tumors are likely to contain necrotic cores.\nIn a biosafety hood, transfer the dissected tumor to a sterile 10 cm Petri dish containing enough DMEM to prevent drying.\nCut the tumor into 1 mm3 fragments with scalpel or blade under aseptic conditions.\n\tNOTE: The scalpel or blade should be exposed under UV in the biosafety hood for at least 20 min prior to use.\nTransfer the tumor fragments to a 15 mL conical tube filled with cold DMEM. Place the tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: The tissue is ready for transplantation. The dissected tumor fragments from step 2.4 can be, 1) snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein and RNA/DNA extraction, 2) fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, or 3) cryopreserved in 1.25 mL freezing medium (10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], 40% DMEM and 50% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) by slow freezing in a -80 °C freezer overnight and then transferring to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n3. Prepare animal for surgery\nFor animal pain management, subcutaneously inject buprenorphine sustained release 60 min prior to the surgery at a dose of 1 mg/kg or follow institution's guide for 72 h of analgesic coverage.\nSet up the surgical suite according to institutional guidelines for aseptic surgeries.",
    "Anesthetize a 4-week old female in an induction chamber of the isoflurane anesthesia machine at the rate of ~11.25 mL/h. Transfer the mouse to procedure area, onto the sterile (silicone rubber) surgery board, where it will receive anesthesia through a small facemask. Put the mouse on its back and tape the legs down in their natural positions.\n\tNOTE: SCID/Beige, NSG or NRG are used for PDX and Balb/c is used for GEMM transplant models.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness.\nConfirm the appropriate level of sedation by toe pinch.\n\tNOTE: No response/movement of the animal indicates that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized and ready for surgery.\nShave the mouse on the lower abdomen, especially the region around the fourth nipple where the surgery will take place.\nUsing a circular motion and starting in the center of the surgery site, work toward the outer edges with povidone-iodine surgical scrub, followed by removal of povidone-iodine with a 70% isopropyl ethanol pad. Repeat two additional times.\n4. Transplantation of tumor fragments into the fourth (inguinal) mammary fat pad\nUse a sterile surgical drape to cover the body of the animal except the incision site.\n\tNOTE: Confirm the appropriate level of sedation by toe pinch before making the incision.\nUsing serrated forceps pinch and lift up the skin at the #4 nipple.\nWith the blunt side down, use scissors to make a short (about 1 cm), parasagittal incision, from the #4 nipple towards the head.\nUsing a cotton tipped applicator, separate the skin from the peritoneum on the medial side of the incision.\nWhile holding the lateral side of the incision, gently peel the #4 mammary fat pad from the skin using the same swab.",
    "Once the fat pad is separated, pin down the skin with a 27 G needle close to the animal's body.\nIf it is experimentally necessary to clear the fat pad of endogenous mouse mammary epithelium perform the following steps.\n\t\nUsing the serrated forceps, gently extend the fat pad away from the body and locate the inguinal lymph node, which is beneath the intersection points of the major vessels in the gland (close to where the forceps will be holding the gland).\nCarefully cauterize the vessels medial to the lymph node and the fat joining the fourth and fifth fat pads which forms a triangular area.\n\t\tNOTE: Temporarily turn off the oxygen source for this step.\nUsing micro dissecting scissors, cut each cauterized vessel one at a time (to ensure there is no bleeding after each cut) until the section of the fat pad that contains the lymph node is removed.\nDiscard the \"cleared\" fat pad tissue.\nHold the fourth mammary fat pad using blunt separation forceps. With the other hand, insert the closed tip of the angled fine forceps into the middle of the fat pad above the remaining vessel and close to the wall of the peritoneum. Slowly open the forceps to make a small pocket. Remove the angled fine forceps from the fat pad.\nUsing the angled fine forceps, take a piece of tumor fragment and insert it into the pocket.\nSlowly open the forceps tips to release the tumor fragment into the fat pad pocket.\nWithdraw the angled fine forceps carefully.",
    "NOTE: Look at the pocket to confirm that the tumor fragment remains in the pocket of the mammary fat pad when withdrawing the forceps. Tumors may be implanted into both contralateral fat pads when excess tumor tissue is needed for experiments or banking. Animals with double-sided transplants are not recommended for treatment studies because of known interactions between contralateral tumors. Alternatively, a trocar device might be used for the implantation process.\nStarting from the base of the incision, collect the skin on each side using the claw and serrated forceps. Bring the two sides together and lift slightly to prepare the skin for wound clip application. Uncurl the edges of the incision with the claw forceps and pinch the edges together to form a continuous surface at the top.\nHolding the two sides together with serrated forceps, use the wound clip applicator to place a wound clip in the center of the incision. If necessary, apply tissue adhesive to the ends of the incision in order to keep them closed and secured.\nPlace the animal into a clean cage that is on a warming surface. Monitor for bleeding, signs of dehiscence, and pain during the postsurgical period. The animal should be up and moving within minutes postsurgery.\nPay close attention to the incision site and overall health of the animals for at least 3 days following surgery. Follow institutional guidelines for pain management.\nClean the surgical tools for 10 s in a glass beads sterilizer before continuing with the next transplant. Wait for the tools to cool down prior to use.\nRepeat steps 4.1−4.15 until all mice are transplanted.\n\tNOTE: Estrogen supplementation is required for ER+ tumors, which can be supplied through water or slow release pellets59.\n5. Monitoring tumor growth in response to drug treatment",
    "NOTE: Palpable tumors of established transplantable PDXs and p53-null tumors takes between 2 weeks and 8 weeks to develop after surgery, depending on intrinsic tumor growth rates.\nMeasure tumors in two dimensions using calipers twice a week. Calculate the volume using the formula:\n\tTumor volume (mm3) = W2 x L/2\n\twhere W is width and L is length of the tumor.\nStart drug treatment when the tumor volume reaches 150−300 mm3.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the property of the drugs, oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection may be used to deliver the drugs.\nCollect tumor samples and perform IHC staining60, protein and RNA/DNA isolation and immune phenotyping61 for various purposes. Collect blood and perform immune phenotyping or use it for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
