    "All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee and the Genetic Recombinant Experiment Safety Committee of Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, and performed according to their guidelines.\n1. Preparation\nSterilize all the instruments and apparatuses necessary for the surgery using autoclave or 70% ethanol.\nGlass pipette preparation.\n\t\nFirmly fix a 75 µL calibrated capillary to the holder of the micropipette puller. Set the puller to the program with the recommended parameters as P (pressure) = 500, HEAT = 680, PULL = 30, VEL = 60, TIME = 180.\nAfter finishing the program (usually 4.5 to 5 s), the capillary is divided into two glass pipettes with tapering tails. Then, break the distal part of the tails with tweezers to keep the tip diameter within 30-50 µm. For this, break the tails 1 cm distal to the end of the beveled part.\nFor craniotomy, prepare a cranial window by gluing a larger outer glass disc, 4 mm in diameter, 0.15 ± 0.02 mm in thickness, to a smaller inner glass disc, 2 mm in diameter, 0.525 ± 0.075 mm in thickness, using a UV light curing reagent (Figure 2A).\n2. AAV injection\nPreparation of injection apparatus\n\t\nPlace a glass pipette connected to a 26 G Hamilton syringe through a tube onto a pipette holder of a stereotaxic instrument, and then tilt the pipette holder 60° anteriorly from the vertical axis (Figure 1A,B).\nFill the glass pipette, the syringe, and the connecting tube with liquid paraffin. Place the syringe on a microinjector.\nSurgical procedure\n\tNOTE: The following surgery was performed in a sterilized booth. A stereomicroscope was used for the surgery if necessary.",
    "Anesthetize a male CX3CR1-EGFP mouse (detailed information in the Table of Materials) at 7 to 8 weeks old (bodyweight 22-26 g) with 3% isoflurane in a gas-tight chamber. After 3 min, take out the mouse from the chamber when it loses voluntary movement except breathing, and then switch to continuous anesthesia by a nasal tube with 2% isoflurane.\n\t\tNOTE: Isoflurane is known to activate microglia. However, because imaging is performed 4 weeks after the surgery, there is no effect of isoflurane on the mice during imaging. Although isoflurane anesthesia is used for a few minutes when mice are placed in the stereotaxic instrument before imaging (step 4.2.1), we found that the effect of this short anesthesia is negligible.\nDuring surgery, keep the mouse warm with a heating pad at 37 °C to prevent hypothermia. Apply eye ointment on both eyes to prevent corneal dryness and administer a meloxicam injection, subcutaneously (5 mg/kg). Attach the mouse to an auxiliary ear bar, and then fix the mouse on the stereotaxic instrument with its dorsal side up.\nAdjust the isoflurane concentration to an appropriate percentage (1%-2%) during the surgery while monitoring the breath and heart rate. Remove the hair using depilatory cream and disinfect the head several times in a circular motion with both an iodine-based or chlorhexidine-based scrub and alcohol. Then, inject 0.1 mL of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously and apply sterile drapes to secure the surgical site.\nIncise the scalp open along the midline with scissors and make the incision about 2 cm long, to ensure a good exposure of the skull above the right primary visual cortex. After the incision of the scalp, irrigate the head with saline throughout the whole procedure to prevent the exposed skull and brain from drying.",
    "Remove the periosteum on the exposed skull using forceps. Drill the skull on the stereotaxic coordinates: 3 mm lateral to the midline, 0.5 mm anterior to the lambda line, to create a small hole with approximately 0.5 mm diameter. Rinse off blood and tissue debris from the drill bit, if necessary.\nFill the glass pipette with 1 µL of rAAV2/1-hSyn-R-CaMP1.07 using the following procedure at a titer of 8.3 x 1012 vector genomes/mL22.\n\t\t\nAdvance the syringe to eject 1 µL of liquid paraffin from the glass pipette. Place a piece of transparent film, approximately 2 cm x 2cm, on the exposed skull of the mouse and expel a droplet of 1 µL of AAV solution on the film using a pipettor.\nPlace the glass pipette tip into the droplet of AAV solution on the film and gently pull the syringe to aspirate the AAV solution. After the ejection, turn the T-shape stopcock to release the pressure inside the tube and the glass pipette.\nInsert the glass pipette to a depth of 500 µm from the brain surface through the hole created in step 2.2.5, and then inject 0.5 µL of AAV solution using the microinjector (Figure 1C). Use the injection volume flow rate of 2.0 µL/h; an injection of 0.5 µL takes 15 min, and then subsequently wait for 5 min.\nAfter the injection, gently withdraw the glass pipette and rinse the brain surface with saline.\n3. Cranial window implantation\nNOTE: Cranial window implantation follows the AAV injection on the same day.",
    "Mark a 2.5 mm diameter circle on the skull, centered 3 mm laterally from the lambda. Create a circular groove along the mark on the skull by drilling. Clean the debris as it may adversely affect the visibility of the skull and apply saline during the drilling process to prevent heating up.\nTo check whether the drilling depth in the circular groove is sufficient to remove the central skull fragment, gently press the central skull with forceps. If it moves vertically with little resistance, the drilling depth is sufficient.\nWhen the groove reaches enough depth, insert the tip of the forceps into the bottom of the central skull fragment and gently lift and remove it to expose the brain surface (Figure 1D).\nUsing a 27 G needle, prick and tear the dura at the edge of the exposed brain surface. Insert the tip of the forceps through the hole made at the edge of the dura. Hold the dura and peel it off to expose the brain surface.\n\tNOTE: If bleeding occurs, rinse the brain surface with saline until the bleeding stops.\nUsing forceps, disperse hemostatic fibers one by one in saline in a 3.5 mm dish, and then place the hemostatic fibers along the margins of the hole in which the transected dura is present.\nPlace a cranial window prepared in step 1.3 on the exposed brain surface, and then adhere it to the skull with instant glue while gently pressing the window so that the window is in close contact with the skull.",
    "Afterward, apply instant glue to the whole exposed skull, and then carefully attach a head-plate onto the skull so that the window locates at the center of the square hole of the head-plate (Figure 2C). Ensure that the surface of the head plate is parallel to the surface of the glass window.\nAfter the glue has sufficiently hardened, apply dental cement to the exposed skull to reinforce the attachment between the head and the head-plate (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: If the experiments include the presentation of visual stimuli to mice, stray light to the imaging area should be avoided. It is advisable to blacken the cement by mixing it with the activated charcoal for the reduction of light reflection.\nWithdraw the mouse from the anesthesia after the cement has hardened sufficiently (about 20 min). Then, put the mouse into a new cage to recover alone.\nAfter confirming its consciousness and voluntary movement, indicating full recovery, put the mouse back in the home cage. During the recovery, administer a second, or more if necessary, meloxicam dose (once every 24 hours for 1-3 days) if obvious pain-indicating behaviors occur.\n4. In vivo two-photon imaging of microglia and neuronal calcium dynamics\nHabituation of mice to the microscope apparatus\n\t\nThree weeks after the surgery, induce anesthesia in the mouse with 3% isoflurane, and set the mouse under the 25x objective lens of a two-photon microscope using a custom-made stereotaxic instrument (Figure 3C). For the setup here, the mouse is set on the top of a treadmill and allowed to run freely.\nApproximately 10 min later, remove the mouse from the microscope stage and return it to the home cage. Repeat the habituation at least 3 times every alternate day before two-photon image acquisition.\nTwo-photon image acquisition",
    "NOTE: We recommend performing the image acquisition more than 4 weeks after surgery, as microglial activation gradually returns to the basal level.\n\t\nAs in step 4.1, induce anesthesia in the mouse with 3% isoflurane and set the mouse under the objective lens of the two-photon microscope using a custom-made stereotaxic instrument.\nInstall the custom-made shading device and an LCD monitor for visual stimulation as described below (Figure 3D).\n\t\t\nPosition the lens to focus on the brain surface, and then set this lens position as the original Z-position. Keep the x-y coordinates constant and elevate the objective lens; remove the mouse and stereotaxic instrument from the objective lens and treadmill.\nAttach a shading device on the top of the head plate using silicone, which is blackened by mixing with charcoal powder, and ensure the space between the head plate and the shading device is well-sealed.\nFill the shading device with distilled water, and then fix the mouse and the stereotaxic frame again under the objective and on the treadmill. Carefully reset the focal plane at the brain surface, checking the depth of the objective lens.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To avoid the risk of damaging the objective lens, set the xyz coordinates first, and then apply the shading device of the objective lens. It is also reasonable to install the cover first, and then adjust the coordinates, but cautious handling is necessary for this option.\nCover the objective lens with black aluminum foil to avoid light contamination from the LCD monitor used for visual stimulation through the objective lens (Figure 3D). Set a 10-inch LCD monitor at 12.5 cm in front of the mouse's eyes to present visual stimuli (Figure 3D).",
    "Configure the fluorescence emission collection filters to EGFP fluorescence (525/50 nm emission filter) and R-CaMP fluorescence (593/46 nm emission filter) and the excitation wavelength to 1,000 nm. Acquire images with the spatial resolution of 0.25 µm/pixel using a 25x 1.1 NA objective and GaAsP PMTs.\nFind the imaging region in which R-CaMP(+) neurons and EGFP(+) microglia can be simultaneously imaged in layer 2/3. For this setup, data obtained in Figure 4 and Video 1 were at a depth of 100 µm from the pial surface, using a live image preview. Keep the power of the excitation laser as low as possible to avoid photo-bleaching and damage caused by increased local temperature in the imaging region.\nAcquire images at the frame rate of 30 Hz. Simultaneously with the image acquisition, present a drifting-grating visual stimuli at 100% contrast, 1.5 Hz, 0.04 cycles per degree in 12 directions at 6 orientations from 0° to 150° in 30° steps to the mouse17.\nAfter the image acquisition, remove the mouse from the microscope stage, detach the shading device and the stereotaxic instrument from the mouse, and return the mouse to its home cage.\nData registration\n\t\nConvert and save the acquired image data (nd2 format in this case) as a series of tiff image files for each color channel, using Fiji or the software supplied with the microscope.\nApply Turboreg, a plugin of Fiji, to perform registration with mode = translation. Use averaged image as the reference image with the tiff image files of EGFP channel.\nPerform the following processing for each frame using MATLAB.\n\t\tNOTE: Although MATLAB is used in the following processing, the description mainly focuses on the intention of each step so that data can be analyzed by other programming software such as Python.",
    "Use the imread function to read two EGFP tiff images before and after registration of the same frame, respectively. Use the imread function to read the R-CaMP tiff image of the same frame.\nUse the normcorr2 function to calculate the correlation function between the vectorized variables of the two GFP images read in step 4.3.3.1.\nUse the max function to detect the linear index with the highest cross-correlation of the correlation function, and then use the ind2sub function to calculate the movement position of the registered image from its original image.\nUse the imwarp function to translate the R-CaMP image to the position calculated in step 4.3.3.3, and then use the imwrite function to save the registered image of R-CaMP.\nGeneration of calcium traces\n\t\nPerform the following processing using MATLAB. Use the imread function to read all the registered R-CaMP tiff images generated in step 4.3.3.4. If the registered images have been already loaded as a variable in workspace, omit this step.\nUse the mean function to generate a time-projection image. Use the imshow function to show the averaged image as a figure; use the roipoly function to generate a binary ROI mask of the target structure (dendritic spine in this data).\nUsing the mean function with the images obtained by multiplying the binary mask with images of each frame as input variables, calculate the averaged fluorescence intensity within the ROI for each frame.\nAs described previously17, to the variable obtained in step 4.4.3, apply the butter worth frequency filter at cutoff = 1.6 s, for cutting high-frequency noise, and then apply the sliding median filter at the time window = 200 s, for cutting low-frequency noise."
