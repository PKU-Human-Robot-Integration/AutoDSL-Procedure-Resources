    "1. Preparation of Tumor Cell Suspension\nNote: Appropriate institutional approvals for the use of patient material and animals are required to establish and maintain primary orthotopic glioma xenografts. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, resected tumor material that is in excess of that required for diagnostic purposes is collected with patient consent for a research tissue repository. Specimens are labeled with a randomized 5-digit REDcap database number and all patient-specific identifiers are removed. The REDcap database contains deidentified clinical data for each specimen in the tissue repository that includes gender, age (in years), race, survival status, pathology, cancer treatments, year of resection, and time to progression. To maintain sterility and optimize success of the primary xenograft method, all of the reagents, steam-autoclaved surgical instruments, and the surgical site should be assembled or prepared in advance.\nNote: Glioma specimens often contain large amounts of myelin and debris. Depending on specimen size, it may be necessary to use more than 4 discontinuous gradient tubes for adequate removal of myelin and debris.\nNote: The process is completed when there is no, or little, clearly visible undissociated tissue remaining. Avoid the introduction of bubbles during the trituration process.",
    "Note: Cell viability following dissociation is typically >90%. Lower viabilities may reflect many variables including suboptimal tissue handling or transport time from the operating room, cryopreservation method, or papain dissociation technique. Lower cellular viabilities may still be adequate, however, as long as a sufficient number of viable may be transplanted in the appropriate volume. For each mouse, 50,000-200,000 viable cells are implanted in volume of 2 µl. Due to the beveled tip of the syringe needle, an additional 5 µl of cell suspension should be included in the final volume to ensure that adequate material can be drawn into the syringe for each injection. For example, to inject 2 µl/mouse for 5 mice the final volume should be 15 µl (15 µl = (5 x 2 µl) + 5 µl).\nPlace freshly resected, deidentified patient material in a sterile, capped container on ice for transport to the laboratory. Process the specimen directly for transplantation or cryopreserve the specimen in liquid nitrogen (see below) for storage in liquid nitrogen and later use.\nPrepare the papain dissociation solutions (papain solution, wash/protease inhibitor solution and discontinuous gradient solution) in a sterile hood with the kit components and instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Label sterile 15 ml polystyrene conical tubes and distribute the solutions as follows:\n\t\t\nTube 1: 5 ml of papain solution\nTube 2: 3 ml of wash/protease inhibitor solution\nTubes 3-6: 5 ml each of discontinuous gradient solution\nPlace the glioma specimen in tube 1 with 5 ml of papain solution and triturate with a 5 ml pipette over a 10-20 min time period.\nPipette the material up and down 10 times and then incubate the material for 2-3 min at room temperature before initiating the next cycle of trituration.",
    "Position the tip of the 5 ml pipette closer to the bottom of the conical tube with each cycle of trituration such that the tip is touching the bottom of the tube for the last 2 cycles.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and pipette the pellet up and down 10x in 3 ml of the wash/protease inhibitor solution.\nCarefully layer an equal volume of the suspension over each of the 5 ml discontinuous gradient solutions (tubes 3-6), with a pipettor set at the “gravity” dispense speed.\nPlace the tubes in a centrifuge equipped with a swinging-bucket rotor, with the acceleration speed reduced to the lowest setting and the brake turned off. Centrifuge at 76 x g for 12 min at room temperature. With the brake turned off, centrifugation is generally completed after 20 min.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend and combine each pellet in 5 ml of sterile balanced salt solution and place the cells on ice.\nRemove a portion (10-100 µl) of the cell suspension and determine the density of viable cells by trypan blue exclusion with a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet at a density of 25,000-125,000 viable cells per µl.\nTransfer an adequate volume of the cell suspension to a 200 μl microcentrifuge tube (PCR tube) and place on ice.\n2. Preparation of Surgical Site and Instruments\nNote: Sterile surgical gloves are worn during the procedure. Depending upon requirements of each institution, surgical gowns, caps and face guards may be required.\nPrepare a disinfected benchtop for rodent surgery with separated adjoining areas for animal preparation, operating field and animal recovery.",
    "Sterilize surgical instruments in a steam autoclave. Subsequently, use a hot bead sterilizer to flash-sterilize instruments when transitioning from one animal subject to the next.\n3. Induction, Anesthesia, and Analgesia\nNote: Surgeries exceeding 15 min from the time the mice is anesthetized require a contact heat source. To prevent hypothermia, the mice are provided with a heat source (circulating hot water blanket) during the pre- and post-operative periods. \nPrepare ketamine/xylazine cocktail for induction anesthesia such that each mouse receives ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg by injecting 10 µl of the cocktail per gram of body weight.\nTable 1. Anesthesia cocktail.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,Stock concentration,Volume to prepare for,Volume to prepare for,Volume to prepare for\n,Stock concentration,one mouse,five mice,ten mice\nKetamine,100 mg/ml,25 µl,125 µl,250 µl\nXylazine,100 mg/ml,2.5 µl,12.5 µl,25 µl\nIsotonic saline,,223 µl,\"1,113 µl\",\"2,225 µl\"\nTotal,Total,250 ul,\"1,250 µl\",\"2,500 µl\"\nPrepare ketoprofen solution for analgesia by diluting the stock solution (10 mg/ml) 1:20 in sterile, pyogen-free water such that each mouse receives a dose of 5 mg/kg by injecting 10 µl of the solution per gram of body weight.\nWeigh and record presurgical weight. Individual mouse weights vary, but generally range from 18-22 g.\nInject 10 µl of the ketamine/xylazine cocktail per gram of mouse body weight into the intraperitoneal space with an insulin syringe. For example, inject 200 µl for a 20 g mouse.\nDetermine whether mouse is fully anesthetized by toe pinch of the hind leg. It generally takes 3-5 min for the mouse to no longer withdraw from the pinch.\nInject 10 µl of the ketoprofen solution per gram of mouse body weight subcutaneously in the loose skin of the flank with an insulin syringe. For example, inject 200 µl for a 20 g mouse.",
    "Shave hair over the skull with clippers, scrub the exposed scalp with povidone-iodine using a cotton tip applicator and then wipe an alcohol pad. Repeat these steps, povidone-iodine scrub and alcohol wipe, two more times.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse.\nMake a 1 cm midline incision extending from behind the ears to just in front of the eyes with a sterile scalpel blade.\nPlace the mouse under a dissecting scope and expose the skull to identify the suture lines. Using circular motions with a drill, center a burr hole 2.5 mm lateral to the bregma and 1 mm posterior to the coronal suture.\n4. Intracranial Transplantation\nNote: Injection volumes exceeding 2.5 µl may be lethal to mice.\nPosition the mouse on a stereotactic frame by hooking the upper incisors over the incisor bar and applying the nose clamp so that the skull is firmly held in a neutral position.\nDraw 5-10 µl of the cells in a microcentrifuge tube up and down several times into a 10 µl Hamilton syringe clamped in the probe holder of the stereotactic manipulator to mix the suspension and eliminate bubbles. Depress the plunger so that the syringe is loaded with 2 µl (the adequate volume to inject one animal).\nPull the lateral edge of the skin incision to expose the burr hole and, with the micromanipulator, introduce the needle into the burr hole so that the beveled portion is just below the skull surface.\n\t\t\nAdvance the needle 3 mm and then withdraw the needle 0.5 mm to create a space for injection.",
    "Advance the plunger slowly over 30 sec and then allow the needle to remain in the brain for an additional 2 min. Withdraw the needle gradually by ascending 0.5 mm and waiting for an additional 30 sec before removing the needle from the brain.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotactic frame and close the wound with an autoclip.\nPlace the mouse on a warming pad to maintain body temperature and monitor continuously the respiration pattern and color of mucous membranes and exposed tissues (soles of feet).\nPlace the mouse in a sterile microisolator cage once it recovers fully from anesthesia (sternal and ambulatory), and return it to the animal housing facility.\n5. Post-implantation Animal Care and Observation\nNote: The most reliable indication of tumor engraftment and infiltrative growth is gradual, sustained weight loss accompanied by development of hunched posture and rough hair coat. On rare occasions, neurological deficits are noted that include ataxia, paresis, and seizures. Orthotopic primary xenografts are highly invasive and develop over a long period of time. Mice typically manifest symptoms of tumor growth 3-6 months after transplantation.\nObserve mice with orthotopic xenografts daily for food and water intake, behavior, grooming, and signs of infection at the incision site.\nAdminister ketoprofen (5 mg/kg subcutaneously, 1-2x a day) if pain or distress is observed postoperatively.\nRemove autoclips 8-10 days after surgery.\nWeigh mice weekly.\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of tumor engraftment.\n6. Tumor Harvesting",
    "Note: By this method, the first coronal slice (#1) contains the posterior aspect of the olfactory bulbs and the anterior aspect of the frontal lobes. Engrafted tumor is most abundant in the right hemisphere of the subsequent 3 coronal slices (slice #2, #3, and #4) and the injection sight is routinely contained in coronal slice #3. Depending upon experimental needs, the material may be used for tumor passage, frozen tissue sections, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections, flow cytometry of dissociated tissue, cell culture or lysates for DNA, RNA, or protein analysis. Portions of the tumor may be cryopreserved for future needs with cell viability ranging from of 80-95%.\nEuthanize mice by prolonged exposure to carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation.\nDecapitate euthanized mice at the base of the brain (foramen magnum level) with a larger pair of surgical scissors, and pull the skin from incision forward to fully expose the skull.\nRemove the brain.\n\t\t\nInsert one tip of pair of fine surgical scissors into the lateral aspect of the foramen magnum to level of the left external auditory meatus to cut the occipital bone along the left side of the skull. Perform the same cut on the right side.\nCut the occipital bone along a coronal plane from one external auditory meatus to the other and remove the bone to expose the cerebellum.\nCut the nasal bone plates between the eyes.\nCut the sagittal suture by cutting posteriorly along the sagittal suture from the nasal bone plates to the bregma. Complete the midline incision along the sagittal suture by cutting anteriorly from the lambda to the bregma.",
    "Carefully insert the tip of a fine pair of forceps along the sagittal opening on each side to tear any dural adhesion of the skull to the brain and then peel the two skull halves laterally to expose the brain and olfactory bulbs dorsally.\nSlide the forceps between the ventral aspect of the olfactory bulbs and the skull to free any adhesions.\nTilt the skull back to allow the brain to be retracted so that the optic and other cranial nerves are exposed. Sever the cranial nerves to release the brain into a dish containing sterile PBS.\nTransfer the brain with a weighing spatula to a matrix slicer and generate 2 mm coronal slices with razor blades.\nArrange the coronal slices in a dish containing sterile PBS for further visual inspection and further tissue processing.\n7. Tumor Cryopreservation\nPrepare a stock solution of cryopreservation medium.\n\t\t\nAdd 50 ml of proliferation supplement, 5 ml of 100x penicillin and streptomycin solution, and 450 µl of 0.2% heparin to 450 ml of basal medium.\nStore stock solution at 4 °C protected from light.\nPrepare a working solution of cryopreservation medium.\n\t\t\nCombine 47.5 ml of cryopreservation medium and 2.5 ml of sterile DMSO in a 50 ml polypropylene conical tube and mix well.\nAliquot 1.0 ml of working solution to each cryovial and store at 4 °C protected from light.\nPlace one 2 mm coronal slice of xenografted brain into a cryovial containing cryopreservation medium on ice.\nTightly cap the vial and place it in a freezing container at -80 °C. Transfer the cryovial the following day to a liquid nitrogen tank for longer storage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
