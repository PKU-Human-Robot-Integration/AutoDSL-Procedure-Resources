    "1. HeLa Cell Culture on Carbon-coated, Gold EM Finder Grids\nGlow discharge the carbon-side of a 200-mesh R2/2 Quantifoil gold EM finder grid under 25 mA for 25 sec.\nCoat the EM grid with fibronectin, by floating it, carbon-side down, onto a 40 μl droplet of 50 μg/ml fibronectin solution, then disinfect it under UV light for 2 hr in a tissue culture hood.\nPlate HeLa cells onto the grid at a density of 2 x 104 cells/ml (total 2 ml culture) in a glass-bottom culture dish and grow the cells at 37 °C, with 5% CO2, in DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/L L-glutamine and glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, for approximately 18 hr. HeLa cells are infected after O/N culture.\n2. HIV-1 Infection and Live-cell Imaging\nAdd a fluorescent cell tracker (Red CMTPX, 1 μl/2 ml) into the glass-bottom culture dish (from step 1.3) and incubate the dish at 37 °C for 10 min, to allow up-take of the fluorescent dye.\nWash the cells with PBS and add 50 μl pre-warmed fresh medium.\nPlace the dish onto the live-cell chamber, at 37 °C, of a Swept Field Confocal scanner microscope. Select multiple fields (10-15 positions) that contain 1-3 cells/square, with the cells between two mitosis phases when they are most spread-out and flat (see Figures 2c and 2d), since cryoEM requires relatively thin regions of the sample. Store these positions for future imaging (step 2.5).\nInfect the cells with VSV-G pseudo-typed HIV-1 particles that contain GFP-Vpr (we use 40 μl of a sample containing 40 ng/ml of p24). When adding the virus particles into the bottom of the dish, be careful to not disturb the EM grid, since the positions for imaging have already been selected and stored.",
    "Immediately after addition of virions, collect time-lapse high-speed 3D confocal images, at the previously selected positions (from step 2.3) for 20-40 min.\nConfocal images were acquired using MetaMorph and analyzed by automated 3D particle tracking for single particle dynamics using Imaris software (See Figure 1). Since we are correlating the dynamic behavior of diffraction-limited HIV-1 particles with cellular ultrastructure, time-lapse live-cell imaging and 3D particle tracking are critical to the results. However, for a large and static structure, a simple fluorescence image (without live-cell) would be sufficient for correlative analysis.\n3. Frozen-hydrated EM Sample Preparation\nTo minimize the time delay between collection of the last confocal image and cryo-fixation of the sample, the FEI Vitrobot (or other vitrification device) should be initiated and prepared for plunge-freezing during collection of fluorescence confocal live-cell images.\nTurn on the vitrification device and set its climate temperature to 22 °C, the target humidity to 100%, the blotting time to 7 sec, and the wait and drain time to 1 sec.\nPlace the grid storage box in the plunger dewar and prepare cold liquid ethane. Mount the dewar onto the vitrification device.\nImmediately after confocal live-cell imaging (section 2), place the culture dish onto an ice-cooled copper block and transfer it to the cryoEM sample preparation room. Load the EM grid onto the specialized tweezers and quickly blot away any media on the grid. The blotting is done manually, with filter paper, after which 4 μl of 15 nm gold bead solution mixed with 0.2 μm fluorescent microspheres is immediately placed on the grid. The gold beads are used as fiducial markers to aid tomographic data collection and alignment. The fluorescent microspheres are used to aid correlation between fluorescent and cryoEM images (See Figures 2c-2f).",
    "Load the tweezers onto the vitrification device and instruct the device to blot and plunge freeze in liquid ethane16. The blotting parameters optimized to achieve best result are: blot time, 7 sec; blot offset, 0; drain time, 1 sec; temperature, 22 °C; and humidity, 100%.\nTransfer the frozen-hydrated grid to a cryoEM holder for immediate cryoET imaging, or to a liquid nitrogen storage dewar for later use.\n4. Cryo-fluorescence Light Microscopy\nA home-built, cryo-fluorescence sample chamber and stage system (Figure 3) is required to carry out steps 4.1- 4.10. The detailed specifications and description of the stage may be found in Jun et al.15.\nFill a self-pressurized liquid nitrogen dewar with liquid nitrogen at least 2 hr before starting cryo-fluorescence light microscopy (See Figure 3a).\nMount a homebuilt cryo-fluorescence sample stage15 (Figure 3) onto an inverted fluorescence light microscope, such as an Olympus IX 71.\nConnect the liquid nitrogen inlet of the cryo-sample stage to the self-pressurized dewar and place the liquid nitrogen overflow protection outlet into an appropriate container. Connect a dry nitrogen gas line to a sleeve placed over the objective lens to keep the lens warm and free of frost.\nPlace a copper block platform (black arrow in Figure 3b) into the cryo-stage chamber for loading the frozen-hydrated sample grid. Cool down and fill the copper chamber of the cryo-stage with liquid nitrogen through the inlet line from the self-pressurized filling dewar.\nWhen the cryo-stage reaches liquid nitrogen temperature (in ~4-6 min), transfer the grid storage box (from step 3.5) to the cryo-stage.",
    "Place the frozen-hydrated sample grid into the EM specimen cartridge on the copper block and clip the grid in place using a C-ring (if using a Polara microscope cartridge), or place a pre-cooled copper ring on top (black arrowhead in Figure 3d), to keep the grid in place and also for easy retrieval of the grid after cryo-fluorescence imaging (if for a non-Polara cryo-electron microscope).\nPlace the cartridge (from step 4.6) in the inner chamber of the cryo-stage (white arrowhead in Figure 3b).\nSearch and find the same virus particles from the live-cell imaging data. Since the EM grid has an index, it is straightforward to localize the same particle on the grid in both live-cell images and cryo-florescence images.\nAcquire cryo-DIC and GFP images at the identified positions under cryo-condition using a light microscope with a long working (2.7-4 mm) objective lens. During the cryo-fluorescence imaging, periodically check the liquid nitrogen level in the cryo-stage and refill it, as needed, to keep the sample stage below -170 °C.\nUpon completion of cryo-fluorescence imaging, carefully return the specimen cartridge to the copper block platform and store the cartridge in a liquid nitrogen dewar for future cryoET analysis with a Polara system. If using a non-Polara cryo-electron microscope, remove the copper ring, retrieve the sample grid, place it in a grid storage box, and store the specimen in a liquid nitrogen dewar until the specimen is examined by cryoET.\nFor data analysis, overlap the acquired cryo-DIC and GFP images (from step 4.9, see Figure 4b) and correlate the positions of the GFP signals in the cryo-fluorescence image with those obtained in the live-cell imaging series.\n5. Cryo-electron Tomography\nLoad the sample cartridge into the cryo-transfer station of an electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun, such as Polara G2 microscope.",
    "Under low-dose-search mode at a magnification of 140X, identify and save the associated grid squares (from step 4.11) into a stage file.\nUnder low-dose-search mode at a magnification of 3,500X, insert a 100 μm objective aperture, search and save all the positions correlated with GFP signals into a second stage file.\nUnder low-dose-exposure mode, find a blank area to adjust beam intensity to a dose of 1 or 2 e-/Å2 and refine the tilt axis, using the stage y function, by burning away the ice in an unimportant carbon region with several gold beads.\nUnder low-dose-focus mode, adjust the focus distance to ~3 μm and adjust the angle to align the direction of focus to be parallel to the tilt axis.\nUnder low-dose-search mode, recall saved positions (from step 5.3), adjust the specimen eucentric height and check the tilt range for the area of interest. Acquire a projection image with very low electron-dose (~1 e-/Å2) at 8 to 10 μm defocus, in exposure mode, to confirm the correlated virus particles for cryo-electron tomography.\nSwitch to the low-dose-focus mode. In TEM auto functions menu, precede the automated eucentric height and focus functions on the focus area.\nSet up the parameters for acquiring a tilt-series. For Figure 4 in this paper, tilt angles ranging ±70°, below and above 45°, at 3° and 2° tilt increments, respectively, were used, with a 6 μm defocus and approximately 70 e-/Å2 total dose.\nRepeat steps 5.7 and 5.8 for all the saved positions. Batch tomography software can be used for automated data collection at multiple positions to increase the throughput.\n6. Three-dimensional Reconstruction using IMOD17\nInspect the raw tilt series to adjust the minimum and maximum density values and determine if there is any view to be excluded due to large image shift.",
    "Start eTomo and setup tomogram panel using axis type, pixel size, fiducial diameter, etc. Then create com scripts.\nConfigure the main window such that several stages of the tomogram computation can be adjusted/followed simultaneously. Modify the necessary parameters and execute the specific programs that are required by each processing step (See eTomo tutorial, http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html[href=http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html]).\nAt the final stage, create a full aligned stack (with a mean residual error less than 0.6) and reconstruct tomograms using a weighted back-projection algorithm in IMOD.\nDenoise potential areas of interest using a 3D nonlinear anisotropic diffusion edge enhancing program implemented in IMOD with appropriate parameters to enhance the contrast and clarity.\nSubscription Required.
