    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSEAP reporter assay\nTiming: 2 days\nThe SEAP reporter gene is under the control of the IFN-β minimal promoter fused to five NF-κB and AP-1 binding site, thus, the activation of NF-κB will lead to expression of SEAP. In this way, activation of NF-κB can be measured easily by activation of SEAP. The method was used to monitor the inhibition effect of TLR8 antagonists in HEK-Blue TLR8 cells which were activated by TLR8 agonist (R848).\nCultured HEK-Blue TLR8 cells in 10 cm dishes were washed with 5 mL PBS 3 times gently.\n10 mL of DMEM medium was added to dish, then cells were harvested from dishes by aspirating. To separate cells, the medium was passed through 10 mL serological pipette for 10 times.\nCultured HEK-Blue TLR8 cells were spined at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded into bleach and the cell pellet was resuspended with DMEM medium.\nHEK-Blue TLR8 cells were seeded in tissue culture treated 96-well flat-bottom clear plates with a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in DMEM test media, see HEK-Blue cells test medium preparation for details.\nR848 was used to activate TLR8 in HEK-Blue TLR8 cells. DMSO (0.1%) treated cells were used as negative control (three replicates) and R848 (1 μg/mL) treated cells were used as positive control (three replicate). To test TLR8 antagonists, cells were treated with both R848 (1 μg/mL) and various concentration of appropriate TLR8 antagonists. For example, cells were treated with TLR8 antagonist (compound 4 in scheme 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch1]) starting at concentration of 10 μM and serial dilution of 1:4. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example of a plate map. SEAP assays for each sample were conducted with three biological replicates, each in triplicate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1320_4.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Picture of SEAP assay plate\nSecreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reacts with Quanti-Blue and produce optical density at 620–655 nm. Blue color indicated activation of NF-κB, TLR8 antagonists downregulated NF-κB activation and stayed as pink color. To avoid edge effect, wells around edges of 96-well plates were not used. Compound 4 (Scheme 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sch1]) was used as an example.\nPlates were then incubated in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h.\nCritical: after 24 h, 30 μL of culture media was transfer to a 96-well flat-bottom clear plate and 100 μL of Quanti-Blue (Invivogen, California, USA) was added, the plate was then incubated at 37°C until color changed to dark blue (30 min–1 h). See an example of SEAP results in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nReadout of absorbance at 620 nm was quantified using Beckman-Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector. Readout of only R848 treated cells were normalized as 100% activation, and untreated cells as 0% activation. See an example of SEAP results analysis of several representative compounds (CU-CPT9a-c) in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Figure was reproduced from previous research article (Hu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) with permission.\nNote: Wash HEK-Blue TLR8 cell with PBS very gently due to their weak adhesion to cell culture dishes. We recommend adding PBS slowly to the bottom of tilted cell culture dishes, then swirl the dishes carefully to wash cells. To avoid edge effect, we recommend that wells around edges of 96-well plates should not be used.\nWST-1 cell proliferation assay\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The WST-1 cell proliferation assay provides an easy and sensitive way to measure the viability of cells. In this assay, the tetrazolium salt is cleaved to formazan by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenase, thus, the number of living cells can be monitored by the amount of dye generated in WST-1 assay. The WST-1 reagent is more soluble and stable compared to others such as MTT and MTS, so it was chosen in our method to assess the toxicity of TLR8 antagonists.\nCultured HEK-Blue TLR8 cells in 10 cm dishes were washed with 5 mL PBS 3 times gently.\n10 mL of DMEM medium was added to dish, then cells were harvested from dishes by aspirating. To separate cells, the medium was passed through 10 mL serological pipette for 10 times.\nCells were centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C.

For examples, cells were treated with TLR8 antagonist starting at concentration of 10 μM and serial dilution of 1:4. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an example of a plate map. Each test was conducted with three biological replicates, each in triplicate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Plates were then incubated in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h.\nAfter incubation of 24 h, supernatant was removed and discarded, and 100 μL of 1:10 diluted WST-1 (Roche) in DMEM test medium was then added to each well as indicated by the manufacturer’s protocol. The plate was then incubated at 37°C until color changes (30 min-1 h).\nReadout of absorbance at 450 nm was quantified using Beckman-Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector. Readouts of untreated cells were normalized as 100% survival.

To separate cells, the medium was passed through 10 mL serological pipette for 10 times.\nCells were centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant into bleach and resuspend the cell pellet with DMEM medium.",
    "HEK-Blue TLR cells were seeded in tissue culture treated 96-well flat-bottom clear plates with a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in DMEM test media, see HEK-Blue cells test medium preparation for details.\nTo test the specificity of TLR8 antagonists, HEK-Blue cells overexpressing TLRs other than TLR8 were treated with both TLR8 antagonists and corresponding antagonist. For HEK-Blue hTLR2, hTLR3, hTLR4, hTLR5, hTLR7, and hTLR9 cells, Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/mL), poly(I:C) (5 μg/mL), LPS (lipopolysaccharide) (20 ng/mL), flagellin (50 ng/mL), R848 (1 μg/mL), ODN2006 (0.15 μM) were used as agonists respectively.\nPlates were then incubated in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h.\nAfter about 24 h, 30 μL of culture media was transferred to a new 96 well flat bottom clear plate and 100 μL of Quanti-Blue (Invivogen, California, USA) was added, the plate was then incubated at 37°C until color changes (30 min-1 h).\nReadout of absorbance at 620 nm was quantified using Beckman-Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector. Readout of only appropriate agonists treated cells were normalized as 100% activation, and untreated cells as 0% activation. SEAP assays for each sample were conducted with three biological replicates, each in triplicate. Please see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for an example of specificity assay, CU-CPT9a was tested in HEK-Blue cell lines overexpressing various TLRs, and it only showed inhibition toward TLR8.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Specificity test of CU-CPT9a in HEK-Blue cells overexpressing individual TLRs\nFor HEK-Blue hTLR2, hTLR3, hTLR4, hTLR5, hTLR7/8, and hTLR9 cells, Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/mL), poly(I:C) (5 μg/mL), LPS (lipopolysaccharide) (20 ng/mL), flagellin (50 ng/mL), R848 (1 μg/mL), ODN2006 (0.15 μM) were used as TLR-specific agonists, respectively.

    "Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nITC can directly measure the heat that is released during binding of TLR8 antagonists to TLR8. ITC was used in this protocol to confirm and measure the direct binding between TLR8 and antagonists.\nPrepare buffer composed of 25 mM MES pH 5.5, 0.20 M NaCl, and 2.5% DMSO at 25°C using a MicroCal iTC200 (GE Healthcare, Illinois, USA).\nTLR8 inhibitors were dissolved in buffer to a final concentration of 100 μM, TLR8 protein was dissolved in buffer to a final concentration of 10 μM.\nThe titration conditions were as follows: Fill the calorimeter syringe with ligand solution according to the instructions in the instrument manual. 100 μM inhibitors were injected into 10 μM hTLR8 as instructed in the instrument manual. The titration sequence included a single 0.4 μL injection followed by 18 injections, 2 μL each, with a spacing of 120 s between the injections.\nOriginLab software (GE Healthcare, Illinois, USA) was used to analyze the raw ITC data. Data points were fitted in OriginLab as instructed in the instrument manual. Example ITC result of CU-CPT9a (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) demonstrated that the antagonist was bound to TLR8 with high affinity (Kd=21 nM).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. ITC analysis of TLR8 titrated with CU-CPT9a\nHeat monitored in ITC correspond to direct binding between TLR8 and its antagonist.

    "Activation of TLR8 leads to upregulation of several downstream signaling proteins such as IRAK4 and TRAF6 (O'Neill et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]), which eventually leads to activation and translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit into nuclear to initial immune responses. To validate the inhibitory effect of TLR8 antagonists on NF-κB, we used immunoblotting to monitor downregulation of nucleus p65.\nImmunoblotting\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nTHP-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates with a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (PenStrep), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. THP-1 cells were treated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (100 ng/mL) to stimulate THP-1 cells’ transfer to macrophage-like phenotypes, which enable us to test TLR8 antagonists in a physiology relevant setting.\nThe cells were incubated in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h.\nAfter differentiation, the supernatant was removed and replaced with unsupplemented RPMI, these cells were then treated with R848 (1 μg/mL) along with 0, 5, 50, 500 nM of appropriate TLR8 antagonists (CUCPT9a in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) and incubated for 2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1320-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Quantitative data analyses of p65/Lamin A/C (bottom). Ratios were calculated using densitometric analysis with image J software. Lamin A/C was used for internal controls (n = 3 independent experiments. P-values were determined using one-way ANOVA, ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001).

    "After incubation of 2 h, THP-1 cells were collected, nuclear protein fraction was extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). To cell pellet was added 100 μL ice-cold CER I, and suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min.\n5.5 μL ice-cold CER II was then added and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 5 min. Supernatant was discardeded and pellet was collected and added with 50 μL ice-cold NER.\nThe sample was incubated on ice and vortexed for 15 s every 10 min, for a total of 40 min.\nThe sample was then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected for the following assay.\nPause point: Protein samples collected from step 34 can be stored at −80°C before further assay.\nProtein levels of samples collected from step 34 were measured with BCA assay according to the manufacturer’s manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).\nProtein samples (20 μg protein each lane) were loaded and run in 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto a nitro-cellulose membrane (BioRad, California, USA) using electroblotting.\nThe membrane was blocked with milk in TBST for 1 h at 25°C.
