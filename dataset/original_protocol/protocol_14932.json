    "Housing and all procedures carried out were in accordance with German Animal Welfare Legislation.\n1. Sensors Calibration (Follow Manufacturer's Instructions for Sensors Calibration)\n1.1) Millar catheter calibration. Pre-soak the tip of the catheter in sterile water or saline for 30 min prior to balance (zeroing) and calibration.\nConnect the millar sensor to the millar1 channel of bridge amplifier and insert the millar sensor tip into water column.\nSet the water column value to 0 cmH2O. In data analysis software window, choose bridge amplify and zero it. The baseline value 0 cmH2O can be set.\nSet the water column value to 20 cmH2O. Run data analysis software window progress, and stop. Choose “units” in the window of bridge amplify, set the baseline of 0 and 20 cmH2O accordingly. Adjust the “unit” to cmH2O.\nCalibrate the millar2 for measuring CAP in the same way (set two base line 90 and 110 cmH2O).\n1.2) Blood flow probe calibration\nPut the probe into deionized water. Connect the probe with transonic flow probe system.\nIn data analysis software window, choose Input amplify to zero the flow probe. Adjust the units.\nPress the button to “test channel” to collect the signal: if the signal has 3-4 bars, it means the signal is good. In case a good signal is acquired, the procedure can be continued.\nPress the button to “zero channel” and scale channel to see whether the value has been calibrated or not.\nPress the button to “measure channel” for later measuring.\n2. Prepare the Mouse for the Surgical Procedure\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber and anesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane and 0.3 ml/min oxygen. The operation can be performed if the toe-pinch withdrawal reflex of the mouse is absent.",
    "Shave the fur of surgical regions, which include the left neck and abdomen.\nPlace the mouse on the operation table and fix it using tapes. Use vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness during the operation period.\nPlace a gauze cushion under the neck for optimal exposure of the operation field of neck.\nDisinfect the operation field and place sterilized gauzes to cover the mouse only leaving the surgical field open.\n3. Vital Parameters Measurement\nInsert the ECG needles subcutaneously into the paws of mouse.\nPlace the respiratory sensor under the back of the mouse.\nPlace the temperature probe into the rectum of the mouse.\nRecord temperature, ECG and respiratory rate of the mouse in data analysis software.\n4. Neck Operation for Systemic Cardiovascular Monitoring\n4.1) Vessel dissection\nIdentify the middle line of the neck, middle point of clavicle, the angle of mandible.\nMake a 2cm longitudinal incision from the angle of mandible to the middle point of clavicle which is 0.5cm to the left side of the middle line.\nDissect the submandibular gland, turn it over and cover it with saline soaked gauze.\nIdentify the jugular vein, dissect it and place three 6-0 silk sutures under the vein for later ligation and fixation.\nIdentify the sternocleidomastoid muscle, separate it from the superior belly of omohyoid and posterior belly of digastric muscle, and pull it with a retractor for easy exposure of the carotid artery.\nDissect the carotid artery and place three 6-0 silk sutures under the artery for later ligation and fixation.\n4.2) Carotid artery blood flow measurement\nPlace the transonic probe around the carotid artery, keep it stable, and optimize the contact using ultrasound gel or saline.",
    "Record blood flow velocity of the carotid artery as indicated on the small screen of the transonic device using data analysis software\nRemove the probe after completing the measurement\n4.3) Carotid artery pressure measurement (CAP)\nLigate the distal end of the carotid artery and clamp its proximal end.\nPlace 2 fixing sutures around the carotid artery. Use 10-0 prolene for the stay suture.\nMake a small incision on the anterior wall of the vessel.\nInsert the millar catheter and fix it with pre-placed sutures.\nRecord the CAP in data analysis software.\n4.4) Jugular vein blood flow measurement\nLift the jugular vein and place the transonic flow probe to measure the flow rate.\nRecord the flow rate in data analysis software.\n4.5) Central venous pressure measurement (CVP)\nClamp the proximal end of the jugular vein and ligate the distal end.\nCut a small incision using microscissors on the anterior wall of the vessel.\nInsert the fluid-filled catheter and fix it with the pre-placed suture lines.\nRecord the CVP in data analysis software.\n5. Abdominal Operation for Acquisition of Hepatic Hemodynamics\n5.1) Vessel identification\nMake a transverse incision on the abdomen.\nEventerate the intestines to the left side and cover with wet gauze.\nIdentify the inferior vena cava, the portal vein, the common hepatic artery and the proper hepatic artery.\nDrop some warm saline in the abdomen and on the surface of the intestines every 5 min during the whole monitoring procedure.\n5.2) Measurement of portal blood flow\nDissect the portal vein.\nPlace 6-0 silk under the portal vein to facilitate lifting of the vessel when placing the flow probe.\nPlace the transonic flow probe around the portal vein and measure its blood flow rate.\nRecord the blood flow rate of the portal vein.\n5.3) Measurement of Common hepatic artery flow",
    "Dissect the common hepatic artery cautiously.\nPlace one 6-0 silk suture around the vessel to facilitate lifting of the vessel.\nPlace the flow probe around the artery.\nMeasure its blood flow and acquire the data.\n5.4) Measurement of portal vein pressure (PVP)\nChoose one branch of the mesenteric vein with few side branches, which drains straight into the portal vein.\nLigate the distal end of the selected mesenteric vein. Make sure that ligation is close to the intestinal tube. Ligate its small branches\nPlace 2 fixing sutures using 6-0 prolene around the vein. The key point of this procedure is to avoid touching the mesenteric artery when ligating the vein.\nClamp the proximal end of the portal vein.\nPlace 2 stay sutures using 10-0 prolene. Some bleeding will occur since the stay suture should penetrate the vascular wall of the fine mesenteric vein.\nMake a small incision on the vein using a microscissor obliquely at a 45 degrees angle.\nInsert the Millar catheter through the mesenteric vein into the portal vein and fix it\nRecord the portal vein pressure. At the end of the procedure, sacrifice the mice by exsanguination under anesthesia.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
