    "Isolate pASC-GFP particles from 107 HEK293 cells stably or transiently transfected with ASC-GFP as described previously (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Fernandes-Alnemri and Alnemri, 2008; Martín-Sánchez et al., 2015) or by flow cytometry.Remove media from cells, add DPBS and gently scrape cells. Spin down cells at 1,500 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant.Prepare total cell lysates by hypotonic lysis of cell pellets in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% CHAPS, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Use a syringe with 25 G needle to lyse the cells by syringing several times. Centrifuge cell lysates full speed to obtain cell lysates supernatant.Induce aggregation of ASC-GFP by incubation of cell lysates supernatant at 37 °C for 30 min as previously described (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Fernandes-Alnemri and Alnemri, 2008). The typical number of ASC-GFP particles recovered is between 2 x 105 and 4 x 105 per million cells.Add a small amount of supernatant to a microscope slide to confirm ASC polymerization into 1-3 μm aggregates by fluorescence microscopy using a standard GFP excitation/emission filter set (excitation: 484 nm; emission: 507 nm) (Figure 1).Sort ASC-GFP particles (1-2 μm) by flow cytometry by gating for small particles based on forward scatter versus side scatter. Next start by gating for FITC positive particles. Later confirm ASC-GFP particles by fluorescent microscopy (Figure 1). Particles can be stored at 4 °C for one year.Intraperitoneally inject mice with 1 x 105 pASC-GFP particles or the same volume DPBS for control mice (injection volume approximately 200 μl).4 h later sacrifice mice, cut the skin and expose the peritoneal wall (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Peritoneal lavage. The video shows how to wash peritoneal cavity after injection of pASC-GFP particles to measure IL-1β by ELISA.Inject 4 ml of DPBS into the peritoneal cavity.",
    "Shake the mouse to wash the peritoneal cavity.Use the syringe to recover DPBS injected by gradually pulling out the plunge.Remove the needle and add content to a conical tube.Spin down the cells at 1,200 x g for 5 min.Transfer supernatant to fresh conical tubes and measure IL-1β by ELISA. Typical IL-1β concentrations are up to 2 ng/ml and a representative result is shown in our previous publication (de Almeida et al., 2015)."
