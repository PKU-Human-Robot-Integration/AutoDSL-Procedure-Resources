    "1. Animal Culture and Handling\nNOTE: This protocol uses Schmidtea mediterranea, a diploid planarian species with a sequenced genome16,17 that is commonly used for regeneration research. However, the assay is equally successful with other species, such as Girardia tigrina and Girardia dorotocephala (which are commercially available).\nMaintain worms in \"worm water\" made from 0.5 g/L sea salts in ultrapure (or filtered deionized) water. Use sterile polypropylene or glass containers to hold the worm water. See Supplementary File 1[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55594/Supplementary_File_1.docx] for details on worm water preparation.\n\tNOTE: Never use soap to clean containers (or other supplies) as soap is toxic to worms; instead wipe with 70% ethanol and allow to air dry.\n\t\nWear gloves while working with planaria to protect them from contamination.\n\t\tNOTE: Worms are very sensitive to environmental toxins and chemicals, including soap, bleach, shampoo, conditioner, and hand lotion.\nHouse colonies in polypropylene food containers, with the lid left partially open for air exchange at ~20 °C (room temperature). Store experimental worms in either petri dishes (20 worms per 100 mm dish) or non-treated tissue-culture plates (1 worm per well, for 12-well plates). To reduce stress, keep both colonies and experiments in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Colonies should have no more than 500-1,000 worms per liter of worm water. For experiments, leave lids fully in place, since airflow is designed into these dishes.\nFeed non-experimental worms once a week with pureed organic beef or chicken liver by dropping puree from a transfer pipette, placing drops of food throughout the container. Allow worms 2 h to consume food in the dark before cleaning out container (see step 1.4). Prior to use, store puree at -20 °C for short term (weeks) or -80 °C for long term (months); do not refreeze puree for re-use (as bacteria may bloom and harm the worms).",
    "NOTE: Liver should contain no hormones or antibiotics and preferably not be previously frozen. Centrifuge puree prior to freezing (or prior to feeding) to remove air and prevent food from floating. Food should sink to the bottom of the container. 1 mL of puree is sufficient for 500-1,000 worms.\nExchange water once per week with fresh worm water for both colonies and experiments. Colony containers should also be wiped down with an unbleached paper towel (to remove mucus residues that trap wastes) once a week for starving worms, or twice a week for feeding worms (2 h after feeding and again 2 days later). In order to retain the biofilm, do not wipe more than 80% of the container.\nMove worms between containers (or surgery setup) using a transfer pipette. To free worms adhered to container surfaces, squirt water over/behind the worm to release it from the surface. Then suck up the worm into the pipette, while trying to keep the worm within the bottom inch (thinner) portion of the pipette.\nBackload pipettes with a small amount of worm water before sucking them up.\nTry to move the water around the worm, rather than the worm itself, to help prevent tearing soft-bodied worms by touching them with the pipette.\nKeep experimental dishes covered unless transferring worms or replacing water.\n2. Preparation\nStop feeding worms at least one week prior to experiments.\nSelect worms that have been not been fed for ≥1 week and are at least 5-7 mm in length. Transfer the worms to a Petri dish 2/3 full of worm water, and confirm worm length by sliding a ruler underneath the dish. Measure worms while fully extended and moving.",
    "NOTE: While smaller (5-7 mm) worms work better when performing subsequent immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization analyses, larger worms (8-10 mm) are easier to work with – especially when learning to ablate.\nEnsure that worms are whole, undamaged, and not recently regenerating.\n\t\tNOTE: Regenerating worms will have much lighter (or no) pigment in the head and/or tail region as compared to normal worms.\nIf performing RNAi or pharmacological treatments on worms, do so at this point. If worms were fed as part of the treatment (as for RNAi), wait at least 7 days after the last feeding before continuing to step 2.2.\nClean the work space and dissecting microscope base with 70% ethanol and allow it to dry completely. Place the dish of selected worms to the left of the scope. To the right of the scope, place a pair of #5 forceps, a 31 G 5/16-inch insulin needle with a 1 mL syringe, and a clean transfer pipette.\nEnsure that the instruments are kept from touching the bench (which could introduce contaminants). Use a rigid item (such as a chopstick rest) to keep the forceps, needle, and pipette clean. Alternatively, place instruments on top of a fresh brown (unbleached) paper towel.\n\t\tNOTE: These and subsequent instructions are written as they pertain to right-handed individuals. Left-handed individuals should reverse the right/left directions.\nNext to the work space, place a box of lint-free tissue wipes, a source of fresh worm water, and some extra transfer pipettes (protected from the bench top). Place worm water in a plastic wash bottle for ease of dispensing. Also place a labeled 12-well plate (or 100 mm Petri dish) to the right of the scope for collecting ablated animals.",
    "If using a custom-made Peltier plate to immobilize worms, position the Peltier plate into the depression in the base of the dissecting microscope and adjust the output on the DC power source until the working surface of the Peltier plate is sufficiently cool (typically ~5 V).Alternatively, make a cold plate by filling a 100 mm Petri dish ½ full with water and freeze for at least 24 h. Discard the lid and place the bottom of the 100 mm dish on the base of the dissecting scope, then place the lid of a 60 mm Petri dish upside down directly on the surface of the ice (Figure 1A).\nAfter the water has frozen in the 100 mm dish, a \"volcano\" of ice can appear in the center of the plate. If this happens, use a razor blade to scrape the ice flat, to remove any irregularities from the surface.\n\t\tNOTE: During surgeries the ice will melt, making ablations much more difficult. Prepare several ice dishes in advance, and replace frozen ones for melting ones during the assay as soon as the lid of the 60 mm dish starts floating.\nPrepare the surgery surface. Cut a 5 cm x 10 cm piece of plastic paraffin film (4 cm2 if using the petri dish cold plate) and place it on the center of the immobilization device. Fold a lint-free tissue wipe into a square roughly 2 cm2 and place it on top of the film. Cut a piece of white filter paper 1.5-2 cm2 and place it on top of the wipe. See Figure 1B-1E.\nHold the folded wipe in place with a gloved finger, and use worm water to lightly dampen the wipe to ensure that it remains folded. Use the side of a transfer pipette to roll the wipe flat.",
    "NOTE: Cold temperature helps to keep worms from moving. Working \"dry\" also helps in immobilization. The tissue wipe acts to wick water through the filter paper, keeping the worm moist during surgery without allowing worms to dry out completely (which is lethal).\n3. Surgical Ablation\nUse a transfer pipette to place one worm dorsal side up onto the filter paper. Turn the light source on and direct the goosenecks so that the light is focused on the worm. Adjust the dissecting scope focus and magnification so that the eyes are clearly visible (the entire worm does not need to be in view); 5X magnification is a good starting point. Orient the worm by rotating the paraffin film so that the head is pointed towards the researcher (towards the front of the microscope), angled 30-40 degrees to the right.\nAvoid use of bright light to prevent excess worm movement. Planarians display negative phototaxis and will attempt to evade bright light.\nIf the worm is positioned ventral side facing up (with pharyngeal opening visible), use the dull side of the forceps to gently reposition the worm dorsal side up (with eyes visible). Avoid approaching the animal with the sharp tip of the forceps to minimize the chance of tearing through soft tissues when repositioning the animal.\nAdjust the microscope focus so that the eyes are clearly in focus. Also ensure that both the eyes and surrounding head tissues are in view.",
    "Hold a fresh needle/syringe in the right hand as though it were a pen (between thumb and index finger). Brace the left thumb against the Peltier plate (or Petri dish cold plate), and use the left thumb as a fulcrum on which the bottom portion of the syringe will rest (Figure 2A). Look through the microscope, and make sure the bevel of the needle is visible.\n\tNOTE: Needles are very sharp. Be cautious when handling them. Wearing latex or nitrile gloves can offer some protection.\n\t\nUse the left thumb to help hold the needle/syringe steady throughout the procedure and avoid shaking hands.\nMake an angle of about 40° with the left thumb and left index finger (with the index finger on the surgery surface) to help hold the surgery surface stabile.\nWith the bevel of the needle facing upward (like a spoon), position the needle at right angles to the eye (Figure 2B). Use the tip of the needle to gently penetrate the thin layer of tissue overlying the optic cup (white, unpigmented region) of the eye, scooping from right to left. Very gently remove any pigmented tissue located within the optic cup, taking care not to puncture the bottom or destroy the borders of the optic cup.\n\t\nIf the worm has been on the filter paper for >1-2 min at any point during the procedure, add one drop of worm water to rehydrate the worm.\n\t\tNOTE: Dehydration will increase the worm's susceptibility to ripping injuries.",
    "Repeat step 3.3 until all of the black pigmented tissues (pigment cells), as well as all of the white tissues of the optic cup (dendrites of the photoreceptor cells), are removed. Remove excised tissues stuck to the end of the needle by carefully wiping with a tissue wipe. If double eye ablation is desired, ablate the second eye at this point.\n\tNOTE: To avoid injury, needles can be cleaned by grasping the needle with a clean tissue wipe held with the thumb and forefinger, then using the other hand to pull the needle through the wipe away from the thumb and forefinger. Alternatively, the needle can be wiped onto the surface of a wet tissue wipe and examined for cleanliness.\nWhen finished, use a transfer pipette to move the worm to a labeled dish containing fresh worm water. If analyzing group data, place up to 20 worms in a single 100 mm Petri dish. If tracking regeneration in the same individuals over time, place 1 worm into each well of a 12-well plate. Once all worms are transferred, rinse worms by removing all worm water from the dishes/wells and replacing with more fresh worm water.\nTo remove worms from the filter, backload the pipette with a small amount of worm water and release the water onto the worm. This should lift the worm off the filter paper, to be immediately sucked into the pipette for transfer.\nIncubate experiments at ~20 °C (room temperature) protected from light and follow the regenerative process.\n\tNOTE: Worms can be stored in a temperature-controlled incubator to maintain a constant temperature, but this is not strictly necessary. Most room temperatures vary only by +5 °C, which will not affect the worm's ability to regenerate.",
    "If desired, fix worms for immunohistochemistry (see Figures 3-4) and/or in situ hybridization analyses of gene expression. Different fixation methods exist for planarian immunohistochemistry18,19,20 and in situ hybridization21,22,23 protocols.\nWhen experiments are concluded, sacrifice live worms by removing worm water from the dish and replacing with 70% ethanol. Incubate worms for 3-5 min, checking for worms to lyse and turn grayish.\nPlace non-treated worms in the normal waste stream once sacrificed. Avoid introducing live worms into the environment, particularly non-native species.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
