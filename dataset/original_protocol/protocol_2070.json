    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing of TOs\nTiming: 1 h\nTOs of interest were thawed as follows:\nThaw Matrigel on ice at 4°C. Matrigel must be always maintained at 4°C.\nNote: Proper thawing of Matrigel can take several hours depending on volume. Be sure to plan and thaw an appropriate volume before beginning.\nPrepare 9 mL of Advanced DMEM/F12 in one low-binding 15-mL tube and keep it on ice.\nPre-warm one 24-well plate for each line by placing it inside the 37°C incubator for at least 15 min.\nPrepare a single use aliquot of TO growth media supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. Unused TO growth media without ROCK inhibitor can be stored for 1–2 weeks at 4°C. You will need 500 μL of media per well. ROCK inhibitor can be used to prevent apoptosis in TOs when passaging (Driehuis et al., 2019b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). In this protocol, ROCK inhibitor is only required when cells are newly plated. It is not required in subsequent media changes.\nIdentify the sample to be thawed and locate the cryovial from the LN2 tank.\nRemove the cryovial(s) from the LN2 tank and place on dry ice.\nThaw the cryovial content by incubating it in the water bath at 37°C. Keep the cryovial in the water bath until a little piece of ice is left (approximately 1–3 min).\nCritical: Do not use a dry bath to thaw cells/TOs.\nTake the cryovial from the water bath, spray it with 70% ethanol and transfer it to the biosafety cabinet.\nAdd the content of the cryovial (1 mL) to the prepared 9 mL of Advanced DMEM/F12 on ice.\nCentrifuge the TO-containing, 15-mL tube at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Check for the TO pellet and remove the supernatant. TO pellets and tubes should be kept on ice at this point to prevent premature crosslinking of Matrigel when resuspending the pellet.\nCritical: Be careful not to disturb the cell pellet or you may lose cells.\nResuspend thawed TOs in the requisite volume (50 μL per well) of Matrigel. It is critical to avoid adding bubbles to the Matrigel. Mix the TO pellet with Matrigel slowly and without fully compressing the plunger of the pipette to prevent bubbles. To avoid premature crosslinking of Matrigel, ensure the 15-mL tube is cooled to 4°C.\nNote: The number of cells per cryovial should be known at the time of cryopreservation and upon thawing the cell pellet should be resuspended in a volume of Matrigel to plate the cells at a density of 100,000 cells/well. If the number of cells per cryovial is unknown, count the cells to determine the volume of Matrigel needed.\nPipette 50 μL of the TO-Matrigel mix to the center of each well of the pre-warmed 24-well plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Avoid touching the bottom of the well with the pipette tip and do not dispense to the second stop of the pipette to help prevent bubbles in the dome.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1661-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Evaluating organoid proliferation by light microscopy\n(A) Matrigel domes should be positioned in the center of the well. This image shows a 50 μL dome of Matrigel in a 24-well plate.\n(B) Time-lapse brightfield imaging of TO growth in a Matrigel dome. Scale bar: 500 μm.\nCarefully place the 24-well plate with the TOs in the incubator for 15 min to let the Matrigel polymerize.\nOnce the Matrigel domes have polymerized, add 500 μL of TO growth media supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor to each well.",
    "If few wells are plated, add 500 μL of PBS to the wells surrounding those containing TOs to help reduce media evaporation.\nCulture and expansion of TOs\nTiming: 2 h\nRecently thawed TO lines may need to be expanded prior to drug screening. TO lines derived from different patients will recover and proliferate at varying rates. TO lines are expanded in culture media containing the necessary supplements for optimal growth based on TO cancer type. If TOs are healthy, abundant, and no cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present visually by brightfield microscopy, propagate the TOs by obtaining a single-cell suspension. If CAFs are present, refer to troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] for a strategy to reduce the number of CAFs in the culture. Sterilize the hood and equipment before beginning the following procedure. TOs should be seeded uniformly by making sure the cell/Matrigel mixture is mixed homogeneously before pipetting the Matrigel dome. Once TOs reach an appropriate density they should be passaged (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). TOs may need to be passaged before the dome is densely populated if the TOs grow too large and cells begin to die in the middle of the TO (evidenced by very dark centers), if cells adhere to the bottom of the well and the Matrigel dome begins to loosen from the well bottom, or if the TOs begin to grow out of the Matrigel and risk floating in the media.\nThaw Matrigel on ice at 4°C. Matrigel must be always maintained at 4°C.\nNote: Properly thawing Matrigel can take several hours depending on the volume. Be sure to plan and thaw an appropriate volume prior to beginning.\nPre-warm a 24-well plate in the incubator. If passaging multiple TO lines, warm one 24-well plate per line.\nGently remove the media from the TOs by pipetting it out or aspirating.",
    "Add 500 μL of TrypLE to each well.\nDisrupt the TO-containing Matrigel domes by pipetting the TrypLE up and down.\nNote: Be careful to only use the force of pipetting to disrupt the Matrigel dome rather than scraping the plate with the pipette tip.\nPipette the TOs into a 15-mL, low-binding centrifuge tube.\nRinse the wells of the 24-well plate with TrypLE to collect any remaining TOs and collect into the 15-mL tube.\nPlace the tube in the 37°C water bath for 10 min.\nPipette the supernatant up and down to further break up the TOs.\nSpin the cells at 200 g for 5 min in a 4°C centrifuge.\nNote: The TOs should form a compact pellet if all Matrigel has been dissolved and there is not excessive DNA causing cell clumps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If a loose pellet is observed, refer to the troubleshooting tips at the end of this article.\nCarefully pipette out and discard the supernatant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1661-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Evaluating dissociation of organoid cultures and cell pellets\nCell pellets after centrifugation of TrypLE dissociated TO cultures. Upon complete digestion of Matrigel (left) cell pellets are compact in nature with clear demarcation between pellet and supernatant as compared to incomplete digestion (right).\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL PBS.\nMix well and count cells using Countess II or an alternate instrument such as a hemocytometer.\nMix equal volumes of cell suspension and trypan blue to assess viability.\nUse viable cell numbers to determine plating density.\nNote: Each well should contain 20–30,000 fully dissociated cells.\nIf there are clumps of cells, DNase may be needed. Refer to troubleshooting problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCentrifuge the cell-containing tube at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant.",
    "Add the requisite volume (50 μL per well) of Matrigel to the single cell/TO pellet to be plated.\nGently pipette the Matrigel up-and-down to incorporate the pelleted cells/TOs until the mixture appears homogeneous. Take great care to prevent bubbles from forming in the mixture. Incorporation of air bubbles in the domes may lead to future detachment or rupturing of the Matrigel.\nRemove the pre-warmed plate from the incubator and use a 200 μL pipet, set to a 50 μL volume, to gently pipette the Matrigel/cell mixture up and down to re-homogenize.\nCarefully dispense 50 μL of Matrigel/cell mixture in the center of a desired well in the warmed 24-well plate, taking care not to touch the bottom of the plate with the tip-and more importantly-not to incorporate bubbles into the domes.\nNote: Utilize the most central wells in the plate to prevent media evaporation.\nRepeat until all desired wells are filled.\nCover the plate with the lid and return the plate to the 37°C incubator for at least 15 min to allow the domes to polymerize prior to adding media to the plate.\nAfter the incubation period, visually inspect the plate to ensure that the domes have polymerized.\nNote: Domes should not move or vibrate when the plate is moved.\nWhile the Matrigel domes are polymerizing, prepare TO growth media containing ROCK inhibitor at a final concentration of 10 μM. Once Matrigel domes have polymerized, gently pipette 500 μL of pre-warmed (37°C) TO growth media into each well.\nNote: To prevent detachment, take care not to dispense the media directly onto the domes. This can be achieved by directing the flow of media onto the wall of each well.\nReturn the plate to a 37°C incubator.\nPlating of the TOs in 384-well plates for drug screening\nTiming: 2.5 h",
    "This describes the process for plating a single cell suspension from TOs grown in 24-well plates to 384-well plates for drug screening.\nPrepare a single-cell suspension of cultured TOs as described in the previous section following steps 17–27.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL cold TO growth media.\nMix well and count cells using Countess II or an alternate instrument such as a hemocytometer.\nMix equal volumes of cell suspension and trypan blue to assess viability.\nUse viable cell numbers to determine plating density.\nNote: The following calculations are for plating 2,000 cells per well in all wells of columns 2–23 of a 384-well plate. Adjust cell numbers and media/Matrigel volumes as needed for alternate plate layouts. Final volume per well is 20 μL of a 70% media / 30% Matrigel mix with a concentration of 100 cells/μL.\nDetermine the volume needed for 790,000 cells and transfer cells to a new 15-mL, low-binding centrifuge tube.\nAliquot as many batches of cells as there are drug assays (plates) to set up.\nBring the volume of media to 5,530 μL using ice cold TO growth media. The growth media should be the same type as the TOs are cultured in normally.\nKeep the 15-mL tubes of cells on ice. This is important so that the Matrigel does not polymerize when added to the cell suspension.\nAdd 2,370 μL of Matrigel to each cell suspension and mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nNote: Matrigel is highly viscous. Pipette slowly and ensure the appropriate volume is transferred.\nPlate cells using a liquid handling machine, in this case we used the Integra Assist Plus Pipetting Robot with Integra Voyager electronic pipette. Diluting the Matrigel to 30% in cold media allows for repeat dispensing of the TOs to the plate.",
    "Note: If Matrigel is solidifying in the pipette tips, change tips as needed.\nAfter the Integra has finished loading the plate, check the plate to ensure that all wells have received cells. If any do not, manually add 20 μL of cell suspension to the well.\nNote: This should only be an issue if the target height of the pipette is incorrect. The dispensing pipette tip should be close enough to the well bottom that the cell suspension touches but the tip itself should not touch the well bottom. The target height for the Integra Assist Plus is 0.6 mm above the well bottom in this system. Settings may vary with different plate brands and pipette types. Adjust the target height as needed to ensure consistent and accurate pipetting.\nPipette 80 μL of PBS to each well of columns 1 and 24 so that there are no empty wells. If a different plate layout is used, add PBS to all wells immediately surrounding those with cells.\nCover the plate with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane, replace the plastic plate cover, and move the plate to the incubator. Breathe-Easy sealing membranes help to prevent evaporation and may mitigate some edge effects.\nPreparation of the drug library\nLocate the appropriate drug aliquots needed for the drug library. All drug aliquots should be stored as recommended by the manufacturer. Most will be stored at −80°C. Thaw the drug aliquots at room temperature.\nNote: Before thawing, make sure each drug is at the correct concentration needed.\nCritical: Check that drugs remain in solution once thawed. If particulate matter is observed after thawing, vortex/heat as necessary to resuspend.",
    "While the drugs are thawing, put a Bio-Rad Hard shell 96-well plate in the biosafety cabinet and label with the project name, date, expiration date (1 month after preparation date) and drug volume.\nNote: For a typical drug assay, 20 μL of drug in each well is sufficient.\nOnce the drugs are thawed, pipet the appropriate volume of drug in the correct well. Be sure to carefully match each drug location with the appropriate drug library plate map.\nNote: If the drug library is to be used more than once, mark the side of the plate with a tally to keep track of the freeze thaw count and expiration date.\nWhen all drugs are aliquoted in the correct wells, tightly seal an AlumaSeal II on the top of the plate.\nWhen done, store the drug library at −20°C or −80°C depending on vendor recommendation.\nPreparation of serial dilutions\nDetermine how much of each reagent is needed based on the number of 384-well assay plates that require compound addition.\nReagents needed:\nGrowth media.\nCaspase-3/7.\nDMSO.\nAppropriate drug aliquots at the correct concentration.\nStaurosporine.\nNote: 13.5 mL of growth media per 384-well assay plate will be needed.\nOne 384-well setup plate is enough for every two 384-well assay plates 50-mL conical tubes may be used to mix growth media with IncuCyte® Caspase-3/7 Green Apoptosis Assay Reagent (Essen BioScience #4440). Media of the same type can be added to the same 50-mL conical tube.\nPipette the appropriate amount of growth media into 50-mL conical tubes for all 384-well assay plates. Growth media should be the same media type in which the TO line is normally grown and should be consistent with the media used to plate the TO lines in the drug assay plate.",
    "Once the appropriate amounts of media aliquots are made, add Caspase-3/7 reagent to media at a 2× dilution of 2.5 μM (e.g., 6.75 μL / 13.5 mL growth media).\nAfter diluting Caspase-3/7 reagent in media, aliquot enough of the mixture to use for controls. For each assay plate, take 500 μL of Caspase-3/7 and media mixture for 0.1% DMSO vehicle control wells and 500 μL of the mixture for 10 μM staurosporine control wells. Controls will be diluted 2× in the final assay plate. Generate enough 2× concentration controls for all assay plates as described below.\nNote: 0.2% DMSO vehicle control: Add 1.0 μL of DMSO to 500 μL of Caspase-3/7 and media mix.\n20 μM staurosporine: Add 1.0 μL of 10 mM staurosporine to 500 μL of Caspase-3/7 and media mix.\nNote: High-quality controls are necessary to assess the reliability of the assay. Quality control metrics such as Z′-factor and coefficient of variance are important to determining the quality of each assay (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nAfter generating controls, use the remaining media / Caspase-3/7 mix for the generation of drug compound dilutions. Integra Assist Plus system distributes media to 384-well setup plates.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1661-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. High-content imaging controls and quality metrics\n(A) Brightfield and fluorescent images of experiment positive and negative controls. Hoechst is used to identify the nuclei of all cells, Caspase-3/7 activated reagent is used to identify apoptotic cells, and TO-PRO-3 is used to identify all dead cells. Scale bar: 200 μm.\n(B) Viability values from positive and negative control well replicates are used to assess assay quality by Z′-factor (left) and coefficient of variance (right). Each point represents the Z′-factor or coefficient of variance for each experiment plate from the 351-compound screen described in the companion publication (Larsen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).",
    "Add 25–30 mL of media/Caspase-3/7 mix to the reservoir (or whatever remains if only one assay plate is used/remains).\nChoose and run the Integra program depending on how many assay plates will have compounds added. Media for one assay plate will be distributed to columns 2–9 of the setup plate and media for the second assay plate will be distributed to columns 17–24 of the setup plate.\nNote: 90 μL of media/Caspase-3/7 mix will be pipetted into columns 2–8 and 17–23, and 98 μL of media/Caspase-3/7 mix will be pipetted into columns 9 and 24.\nPipette 2 μL of 10 mM drug stock to columns 9 and/or 24 to generate a 200 μM dilution of each compound.\nNote: These volumes assume that a high concentration of 10 μM is desired as the highest dose. Adjust as needed.\nOnce all drugs have been added, generate a serial dilution.\nUsing an 8-channel, 10-μL pipet, set pipet to 10 μL and pipet the media/drug mix, in column 9, up-and-down 10 times to mix the drug.\nTake 10 μL and transfer to column 8 to generate a 10-fold dilution.\nMix and again transfer 10 μL to column 7.\nRepeat for the next column until the drugs have been diluted throughout all columns.\nRepeat this process for columns 17–24 if needed.\nThe serial dilution can also be done using the Integra Assist Plus system.\nDistribute 50 μL of control mixes to columns 1 and 16. Be sure to use controls diluted in the correct media type if multiple media types are needed for multiple TO lines.\nAlternate 0.2% DMSO and 20 μL staurosporine controls every other row in rows A-H.",
    "Transfer 20 μl of controls and each drug dilution to the appropriate well in the 384-well cell plate using an Integra Assist Plus program or by hand.\nFluorescent dye addition to TOs\nTiming: 15 min\nFluorescent dyes are added 2 h prior to imaging. In this study we imaged the drug assay plates 72 h post-drug addition.\nPre-warm an aliquot of Advanced DMEM/F-12 to room temperature. Determine how much media is needed based on how many wells of the 384-well drug assay plate are to be treated.\nNote: If following the standard 384-well layout of all wells in columns 2–23, use 7,740 μL. For custom layouts use 20 μL per well + 700 μL dead volume.\nAdd Hoechst 33342 and TO-PRO-3 to each aliquot of media. A 3× concentration of fluorescent dye solution is made to compensate for the 40 μL volume from cell plating and drug addition currently in each well of the drug assay plate. The concentration of TO-PRO-3 is 900 nM for a final concentration of 300 nM. The concentration of Hoechst is 7.5 μg/mL for a final concentration of 2.5 μg/mL when added to the TO plate.\nNote: If following the standard 384-well layout of all wells in columns 2–23 with 7,740 μL media, use 7 μL of 1 mM stock of TO-PRO-3 and 5.8 μL of 10 mg/mL stock of Hoechst 33342.\nDispense the total volume of fluorescent dye-containing media to a reservoir and distribute 20 μL to each well using The Integra Assist Plus Pipetting Robot or by hand using a multi-channel pipette.\nReturn plate to incubator for 2 h before imaging.\nImaging the drug assay\nTiming: 1 h\nAn IXM Confocal microscope was used to image the 384-well plates. Alternative high-content automated imaging instruments may be used.",
    "Note: The default wavelengths to be acquired in these protocols are brightfield, DAPI, Cy5, and FITC.\nDesign an acquisition protocol suitable for imaging TOs in 3-dimensional space with the following considerations:\nZ-series that will encompass most TOs without excessively increasing imaging time by including too many steps.\nExposure times for each individual fluorophore that maximize signal to noise ratio without saturating the signal.\nInclude multiple sites per well to ensure enough TOs are imaged for analysis. A greater number of TOs can improve Z′-factor; however, experiments with as few as 20 TOs per well can consistently produce Z′-factor scores greater than 0.5.\nMagnification for individual cell clarity; a 10× objective is recommended for resolution and throughput.\nNote: Microscope environmental controls should be used if available for long imaging times to maintain 5% CO2 and 37°C.\nTest the acquisition settings in multiple wells. Once satisfied, save the acquisition settings to be used for all plates.\nRun the acquisition protocol on all plates, ensuring that the timing between dye addition and imaging is 2 h.\nDiscard completed plates properly by sealing and disposing in a biohazard waste appropriate for chemotherapy or other compounds used."
