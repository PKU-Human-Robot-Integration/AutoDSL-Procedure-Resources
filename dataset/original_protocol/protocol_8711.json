    "Animal experiments were performed with government approval (G1361/13, AZ84-02.04.2013.A192 and G1362/13, AZ84-02.04.2013.A194; Bezirksregierung Düsseldorf) based on NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Preparation of Miniosmotic Pumps\nIn a sterile environment (i.e., cell culture hood), obtain the pump, catheter, flow moderator, brain infusion cannula and the spacer discs to be used (Figure 1).\nFor delivery of drugs directly into the ventricles use one spacer disc so that only the tip of the cannula needle is in contact with the ventricle. Hold the cannula upside down with a forceps. Add two drops of cyanoacrylate adhesive (C.A.) and introduce one spacer disc.\nLeave the cannula on a flat surface facing upwards so that the glue between the spacer disc and the cannula dries.\nCut the catheter in sections of about 2.5 cm.\nFor each pump, prepare a minimal of 300-350 µl of the solution of interest as it will be needed to completely fill the pump thus extruding all air inside of it to prevent the formation of bubbles within the catheter. Bubbles will impede the flow of the solution into the brain.\nCarefully connect the catheter to the flow moderator.\nUsing a 2 ml syringe connected to the needle provided by the brain infusion kit, fill the pump until a little amount of solution escapes the pump, thus preventing air bubbles inside it.\nCarefully fill the flow moderator and catheter paying attention to prevent any bubbles remaining inside the catheter.\nIntroduce the flow moderator inside the pump.\nOnce filled, carefully connect the cannula to the end of the catheter. If it is observed that a bubble is formed remove the cannula and carefully refill the catheter with vehicle or drug solution and then reintroduce the cannula.",
    "Place the pump in a container with sterile saline solution and leave it at 37 °C O/N.\nBefore implantation recheck for bubble formation. If necessary (i.e., bubbles are observed) remove the cannula and refill the tube. Reconnect the cannula. This should take only a few microliters of solution.\n2. Implantation of Miniosmotic Pumps\nNote: For these experiments animals were anesthetized by 1% isoflurane (30% O2, 70% N2O). However if this is not available, the use of intraperitoneal injections of anesthesia is also possible11.\nLocate the animal in the stereotactic device under anesthesia and cover the eyes with a protective ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Confirm anesthesia by observing a lack of response in the hindpaw when pressed with the fingers or with a forceps. Do not proceed until the animal is completely asleep.\nCut the fur over the head either with scissors or a shaving machine. Cut as much as possible without damaging the skin.\nClean the skin with 70% ethanol and disinfectant with antibacterial and fungicide properties.\nWith a scalpel open a 1 cm incision slightly to the right of the midline and expose the skull.\nClean the skull with a cotton swab. Soak it with 70% ethanol and pass it over the skull. This will induce the skull to dry.\nIf the skull has light bleeding, use a cauterizer to eliminate any bleeding points. Blood prevents the C.A. from drying properly over the bone once the cannula is implanted.\nUse the stereotactic device to make a mark on the point of the skull where the cannula will be implanted. For ventricular infusions on the left hemisphere coordinates are -0.2 mm caudal, 0.9 mm lateral to bregma (Figure 2A).",
    "Gently drill over the skull making a 45° angle; this prevents the drill from accidentally going into the brain. Repeatedly drill for a few seconds and then check how deep the hole is. Stop drilling once the skull has been thinned but still not fully penetrated.\nBreak the meninges with the tip of a sterile needle until full access to the brain is achieved. Do so gently so as to not damage the brain.\nClean the skull with 70% ethanol using a cotton swab.\nIntroduce a straight forceps under the skin of the animal in an antero-caudal direction. Use the forceps to open the space under the skin in the back of the animal where the pump will be implanted. Introduce the pump into the back of the animal leaving the catheter and cannula outside (Figure 2B). The pump will remain in this position until it is removed and does not need any kind of fixation.\nCarefully place four little drops of glue next to the needle in the cannula.\nCarefully introduce the needle through the skull without moving it sideways. Hold it in position for 15-30 sec until the cannula is completely attached (Figure 2C.1). Once in place, the cannula will reach 2.5 mm in the dorso ventral direction if one spacer disc has been used. If properly attached, the cannula will remain attached to the bone until the end of the experiment.\nPlace one finger over the removable tab and then use the other hand to cut it off by its neck with a set of scissors (Figure 2C.2).\nClose the wound on the skin with a 5-0 suture and add a few drops of povidone-iodine solution (PVP-I) on top of the wound to prevent infection (Figure 2D).",
    "Move the animal into a new cage. Do not place operated animals with animals that have still not been operated. Keep animals that have been implanted with pumps alone in their cages during the time of drug administration.\nDo not leave mice unattended until they are awake and have regained sternal recumbency.\n3. Pump Removal\nNote: Usually the experiment will end at the end of the delivery time allowed by the pump, however it is possible to remove the pump in order to do secondary experiments as a follow up to the drug delivery. In order to do tract tracer injections it is thus necessary to remove the pump.\nPlace the animal in the seterotactic device under anesthesia and cover the eyes with protective ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Confirm anesthesia by observing a lack of response in the hindpaw when pressed with the fingers or with a forceps. Do not proceed until the animal is completely asleep.\nCarefully open the skin by cutting through the incision done on the day of the pump implantation.\nWith a surgical clamp hold the cannula and pull it out. It should be easily removed from the skull. As gentle bleeding is expected, stop it by placing a cotton swab and wait for 1-2 min.\nPull the pump out by the catheter. Help it come out by pushing it, creating pressure over the skin.\nClose the wound again with a 5-0 suture and add a few drops of PVP-I.\nMove the animal into a new cage. Do not put operated animals with animals that have still not been operated. Animals that have undergone surgery can be put together.\nDo not leave mice unattended until they are awake and have regained sternal recumbency.",
    "Allow the animal to recover for 10 days before proceeding to tract tracer injection.\n4. Pressure Tract Tracer Injection at 45° Angles on the Right Motor Cortex\nPlace the animal on the stereotactic device under anesthesia and cover the eyes with a protective ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Confirm anesthesia by observing a lack of response in the hindpaw when pressed with the fingers or with a forceps. Do not proceed until the animal is completely asleep.\nOpen the head wound.\nClean the skull with 70% Ethanol using a cotton swab.\nIntroduce a 5 µl glass syringe (26S ga) on the vertical holder of the device. Make sure the lower end of the glass holder is precisely at the holding piece. The syringe must not be too far below it as then it will be impossible to place it at 45° from the vertical position and perform the injection.\nOrient the syringe directly over bregma and then locate the desired coordinates. For an injection on the motor cortex coordinates are: Point #1: +0.5 mm rostral and 2.5 mm lateral with respect to bregma. Point #2: +1.34 mm rostral, 2.5 mm lateral with respect to bregma.\nOnce coordinates have been located, indicate their position over the skull with a marker with a thin tip. Make only one dot in the skull as excessive ink release might hide the correct coordinate.\nCarefully drill the skull holding the drill at 45°. As in step 2.8, check the skull frequently so that it is not fully perforated in order to avoid damage to the brain caused by the drill. Use the tip of a syringe to ensure that all bone has been removed.\nLoad 600 nl of tract tracer dilution into the syringe.",
    "Adjust the vertical position to 45° towards the right side of the animal. Under the microscope, place the tip of the syringe’s needle right in front of the hole.\nMove it in the vertical direction by 1.5 mm. Let the needle steady in this position for 30 sec to 1 min before doing pressure injections.\nInject 300 nl of tracer dilution in three steps of 100 nl separated from each other by 30 sec. After the last injection, leave the syringe steady for 30 sec to 1 min in order to avoid the tracer to flow out of the brain.\nSlowly pull out the syringe, relocate it over the second hole and repeat the same process with the remaining 300 nl that are inside the syringe.\nAfter the second injection, remove the syringe and proceed to close the wound with a 5-0 suture and add a few drops of PVP-I.\nMove the animal into a new cage. Do not put operated animals with animals that have still not been operated. Animals that have undergone surgery can be put together. Do not leave mice unattended until they are awake and have regained sternal recumbency.\nAllow the animal to recover for 10 days before sacrifice.\n5. Tract Tracer Observation\nAnesthetize the animal fully per institutional guidelines. Confirm anesthesia by observing a lack of response in the hindpaw when pressed with the fingers or with a forceps. Do not proceed until the animal is completely asleep.\nPerfuse the animals with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7) under standard protocols6.\nRemove the brain and post fix it by O/N immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde.",
    "Cryoprotect brains in sucrose at 30% until the brains sink. Then remove the brains and freeze them by 10 sec immersion in liquid nitrogen. Keep brains at -80 °C until sections are produced.\nProduce sections at 20 µm for retrograde tract tracer analysis and at 40 µm for anterograde tract tracer analysis by sectioning on a cryostate.\nNote: FG labelled neurons can be observed as white cells under ultraviolet light excitation. BDA is detected by O/N incubation with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and 3,3’ diaminobenzidine with addition of nickel at 0.4% to enhance contrast of the fibers6,7."
