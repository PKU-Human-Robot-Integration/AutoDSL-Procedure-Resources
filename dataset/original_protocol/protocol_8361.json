  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the University of Arizona Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Care was taken to minimize animal pain and discomfort. Euthanasia methods are according to an approved protocol and consist of cervical decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nNOTE: Carry out microglia morphology analysis on fixed, cryoprotected tissue samples to preserve cell morphology. The following is a standard protocol to prepare and directly slice fixed tissue for fluorescence IHC.\nRemove mouse or rat brains from a euthanized animal after the desired experiment and according to a standard laboratory protocol. Place the brain into a 10 mL vial containing 5 mL of a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h at 4 °C. Then rinse and place into 5-10 mL of a 30% sucrose phosphate buffered solution (PBS, 0.01 M) for 72 h at 4 °C. Store whole brains at -80 °C until tissue sectioning with a cryostat, or at 4 °C if sectioning with a microtome.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has not yet been tested using tissue sliced from paraffin-embedded tissue.\nSection the brain tissue to the desired section thickness and orientation using either a cryostat or microtome and store free-floating sections in a cryoprotection solution (50 mM PBS, ethylene glycol, glycerol) at -20 °C.",
    "NOTE: This protocol has been successfully carried out on coronal tissue sections ranging from 50 µm to 200 µm in thickness. Tissue sections less than 50 µm may not capture the full span of microglia processes, while in thick tissue sections, IHC staining may be imperfect due to antibody penetration into tissue. Tissue may be sectioned either in a coronal or sagittal orientation and this choice will depend on the experimental goal and brain region(s) to be studied.\n2. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: Skeleton and fractal analysis methods can be applied to either fluorescence or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) IHC. The following is a standard fluorescence IHC protocol and may be substituted as needed. Fluorescence IHC yields superior visualization of cell processes when compared to DAB IHC.\nPlace the tissue sections into a 4 mL glass vial (up to 15 mouse brain sections/vial) and incubate with 1 mL of solution containing up to 10% horse serum, PBS (0.01 M), 0.5% Triton, 0.04% NaN3 at room temperature (23 °C) for 1 h.\nWash for 5 min with PBS (0.01 M) three times at room temperature.\nIncubate with the primary antibody (Iba1, 1:1,000) at room temperature for 72 h in 1 mL of solution containing PBS (0.01 M), 0.5% Triton, 0.04% NaN3, and covered (to preserve the NaN3 effectiveness).\nWash for 5 min with PBS (0.01 M) three times at room temperature.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit 488, 1:250) covered at room temperature for 4 h in 1 mL of solution containing PBS (0.01 M), 0.5% Triton, 0.04% NaN3 \nWash for 5 min with PBS (0.01 M) three times at room temperature.",
    "Mount the brain tissue sections (number and orientation based on preference) to subbed slides, apply a soft-set mounting medium to the slide, and place the coverslip over the tissue. Store the slides at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: A 1.5 glass coverslip thickness is required for confocal imaging. Soft-set is a preferred mounting medium because the high viscosity does not compress the tissue and best retains the morphology when compared to hard-set mounting media.\n3. Imaging\nImage Iba1 positive cells in the brain tissue section using a bright-field or confocal microscope that has a z-stack acquisition capability using a 20X objective or greater.\n\tNOTE: Imaging parameters and software set-up should be constant for all photomicrograph acquisition in an experiment. Excellent process detail is obtained using a 40X or 63X objective. It is possible to apply the skeleton analysis protocol described herein to an entire photomicrograph or a multi-cell ROI within a larger photomicrograph.\n\t\nAcquire 8-bit images by using the appropriate software settings specific to the microscope software.\n\t\tNOTE: The conversion of files to 8-bit post-acquisition may distort the data collection.\nAcquire at least a 30 µm z-stack with no more than a 2 µm interval between images using the appropriate software settings specific to the microscope software.\n\t\tNOTE: The microscope and software should allow for image acquisition in an X, Y, and Z axis. A z-stack may be increased, and the interval may be decreased to provide additional microglia detail. In exchange, imaging time will increase. Use Nyquist sampling where possible for fluorescence microscopy.\nSave all files as Tif files or as required by the microscope software.",
    "Open the Tif files in ImageJ and use the toolbar to split channels by clicking Image | Color | Split Channels, and stack images by clicking Image | Stacks | X Project | Maximum Intensity Projection where appropriate. Save as .tif files.\n4. Skeleton Analysis\nDownload FIJI or ImageJ from <https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads>. For the individual plugins, download AnalyzeSkeleton(2D/3D) from <http://imagej.net/AnalyzeSkeleton>15 and download FracLac from <https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/fraclac.html>16.\n\tNOTE: The entire process of converting a photomicrograph to a binary skeletonized image takes less than 1 min.\nIf using a fluorescence photomicrograph, ensure the image is 8-bit and convert to grayscale to best visualize all positive staining. Use the toolbar and click Image | Lookup Tables | Greys. If using a DAB bright-field photograph, first use the FFT bandpass filter plugin (using the toolbar by clicking Process | FFT | bandpass filter) and then convert to grayscale.\n\tNOTE: For the purposes of this protocol, ImageJ default settings for an FFT Bandpass Filter are sufficient (filter up to 3 pixels, down to 40, no stripe suppression). Applying an FFT Bandpass filter removes noise (small features) while preserving the overall larger aspects of the image. This is particularly useful in bright field images, where splits and cracks in the tissue can appear as background and thus complicate the skeleton analysis18.\nAdjust the brightness and contrast if the image is too dim and the microglia process cannot be visualized. Use the toolbar and click Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast. Adjust the minimum or maximum sliders as needed, up to the edges of the histogram but no further.",
    "NOTE: In ImageJ, brightness and contrast are changed by updating the image's lookup table (LUT), so pixel values are unchanged. Max and min sliders control the lower and upper limits of the display range, with pixel values above 255 appearing white and pixel values below 0 appearing black18. In the case of fluorescence photomicrographs, the maximum slider should be used, whereas the minimum slider will be used for photomicrographs of DAB stained microglia.\nRun an Unsharp Mask filter to further increase contrast using the toolbar by clicking Process | Filters | Unsharp Mask. For the purposes of this protocol, ImageJ's default settings (a pixel radius of 3 and mask weight of 0.6) are used.\n\tNOTE: Unsharp Mask sharpens and enhances the edge features of an image by subtracting a blurred version of the image (the Unsharp Mask) from the original, and then merging the resulting image with a high-contrast version of the original image. Therefore, the Unsharp Mask filter does not create details, but rather clarifies the existing detail in an image. The radius setting changes how blurry the Unsharp Mask will be (and thus how much blur will be removed), and the mask weight setting changes the degree of contrast that the Unsharp Mask will be merged with (and thus adjusts the contrast of the final image).\nPerform a despeckle step to remove salt-and-pepper noise generated by the Unsharp Mask. Use the toolbar and click Process | Noise | Despeckle.\n\tNOTE: Despeckle removes salt-and-pepper noise by replacing each pixel with the median value in its 3 × 3 neighborhood. The effect is that outliers in intensity are replaced by the median pixel without affecting the sharpness of edges18.\nConvert the image to binary using the toolbar by clicking Image | Adjust | Threshold.",
    "NOTE: Thresholding stratifies the grayscale images into features of interest versus background and converts the image into binary18.\nApply the despeckle, close-, and remove outliers functions: In the resulting binary image, there may be single-pixel background noise and gaps between processes.\n\t\nApply the despeckle function using the toolbar by clicking Process | Noise | Despeckle.\n\t\tNOTE: Applying despeckle to the binary image removes any remaining single-pixel noise.\nApply the close function using the toolbar by clicking Process | Binary | Close.\n\t\tNOTE: This plugin connects two dark pixels if they are separated by up to 2 pixels.\nApply the remove outliers function using the toolbar by clicking Process | Noise | Remove Outliers.\n\t\tNOTE: For the purposes of this protocol, bright outliers are targeted with a pixel radius of 2 and a threshold of 50. This plugin replaces a bright or dark outlier pixel by the median pixels in the surrounding area if it deviates by more than a certain value (the threshold)18.\nSave the image as a separate file for future use and/or fractal analysis and skeletonize the image using the toolbar by clicking Process | Binary | Skeletonize.\nSelect the skeletonized image and run the plugin AnalyzeSkeleton(2D/3D) using the toolbar by clicking Plugins | Skeleton | Analyze Skeleton, and checking the Branch Information box.\n\tNOTE: It is likely that the image processing will require optimization with the addition or deletion of the above suggested steps. In this process, skeletonized images are assessed for accuracy by creating an overlay of the skeleton and the original image. Somas should be single origin points with processes emanating from the center; circular somas confound the data and should be avoided through protocol adjustment. An example of a single origin point versus circular somas is illustrated in Figure 1.",
    "Common problems resulting in non-representative skeletons and suggested solutions:\nImage too dim: convert to greyscale, adjust brightness/contrast sliders, and/or apply Unsharp Mask\nToo much background: adjust brightness/contrast sliders, apply Despeckle, and/or Remove outliers\nCircular somas in skeletonized image (particularly for fluorescence images): apply FFT Bandpass filter, and/or Unsharp Mask\nCracks in tissue (particularly for bright-field images): apply FFT Bandpass filter, and/or Despeckle\nCopy all of the data from the Results and Branch information outputs and paste the data into an Excel spreadsheet.\nIn Excel, trim the data to remove skeleton fragments that result from IHC and image acquisition.\n\t\nDuplicate the experiment workbook with the raw data output from skeleton analysis and add TRIM to the filename. All subsequent data trimming should occur in the duplicated workbook to preserve the raw data for future use and reference.\nDetermine which length of fragments will be trimmed from the dataset by opening the skeletonized image in ImageJ and selecting the Line tool. Measure several fragments, taking note of the average length, and decide on a cutoff value.\n\t\tNOTE: For the purposes of the data presented here, the cutoff length for undesired fragments is 0.5. This value should be consistent throughout a dataset.\nCustom sort the Excel spreadsheet by clicking Sort & Filter | Custom sort. Sort by \"endpoint voxels\" from largest to smallest and, in a new level, by \"Mx branch pt\" from largest to smallest.\nRemove every row that contains 2 endpoints with a maximum branch length of less than the cutoff value (i.e., 0.5). Sum the data in the endpoints column to calculate the total number of endpoints collected from the image.",
    "Repeat for Branch information data: sort by 'branch length' from largest to smallest. Scroll through the data and remove every row that has a branch length of less than the cutoff value(i.e., 0.5). Sum the values in the branch length column to calculate the summed length of all branches collected from the image.\nRepeat steps 4.11.3-4.11.5 for every image/sheet until all data have been trimmed and summed.\nDivide the data from each image (summed number of endpoints and summed branch length) by the number of microglia somas in the corresponding image. Enter the final data (endpoints/cell & branch length/cell) into statistical software.\n\t\tNOTE: The summed branch length/cell data may require conversion from length in pixels to microns.\n5. Fractal Analysis\nNOTE: FracLac is able to run a number of different shape analyses that are not covered in this protocol. For a more detailed explanation of FracLac's various functions, see the FracLac manual at <https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/Introduction.htm> and associated references 2,16,19. Fractal analysis utilizes the protocol steps 4.1-4.7 described above.\nDetermine the size of the ROI that will be used for all fractal analysis. Use the rectangle tool to draw the ROI. Ensure that the box is large enough to capture the entire cell and can remain consistent throughout the dataset.\n\tNOTE: Use the rectangle selection rather than the freehand selection to ensure that all ROIs are the same sized rectangle, and therefore, the cells have the same scale. This would not be the case if the freehand selection were used because ImageJ will auto-scale a square ROI to fit different sized rectangular windows resulting in cells with different scales. While fractal shapes are scale-independent, the fractal analysis process using FracLac for ImageJ is dependent on scale16. Thus, there is the need for a consistently sized ROI throughout data collection.",
    "Randomly select microglia for fractal analysis in each photomicrograph and corresponding binary image. In the ROI manager window, select Update to lock the ROI onto the cell's position. Use Ctrl + Shift + D to duplicate the area within the ROI as a new window, and then save the cropped cell. On the corresponding binary image (from the skeleton analysis), duplicate the area with the same cell using the ROI manager. Repeat until a sufficient number of cells have been randomly selected for fractal analysis and save all files.\n\tNOTE: A random number generator and a numbered grid can be used to randomly select cells.\nOpen the binary image with the individual cell. Double-click the paintbrush tool, set the color to black, and adjust the brush width as needed. Using the matching photomicrograph as a reference, use the paintbrush to remove adjacent cell processes, connect fragmented processes, and isolate the cell of interest. Once the binary cell has been isolated, save the binary file.\n\tNOTE: Holding 'alt' will switch the paintbrush from the foreground color (black) to the background color (white).\nConvert the binary cell to an outline using the toolbar via Process | Binary | Outline.\n\tNOTE: FracLac for Image J can be used on either solid shapes or shape outlines, however, current convention is to use shape outlines16.\nIn the toolbar, open FracLac using the toolbar by clicking Plugins | Fractal Analysis | FracLac and select BC (box counting). In the Grid Design settings, set Num G to 4. Under Graphics options, check the Metrics box to analyze the convex hull and bounding circle of the cell. When finished, select OK.",
    "NOTE: Num G is the number of box counting grid orientations used during the scan and the recommended range for Num G is 4-12. The Num G setting and the suggested range is thoroughly reviewed in the FracLac manual16. Increasing Num G can significantly slow calculation times. FracLac settings will only need to be set up once per session. Once the settings have been entered, the Scan button will become available.\nSelect the Scan button to run a box-counting scan on the selected image.\n\tNOTE: The scan will generate three windows with data outputs: Hull and Circle Results, Box Count Summary File, and Scan Types. The Scan Types window contains a log of the settings used, as well as standard deviations for certain measures. For the purposes of this protocol, the Scan Types window is not used and may be closed or saved for future reference.\nIn the Hull and Circle Results window, copy all desired data (i.e., density, span ratio, and circularity) results. In the Box Count Summary window, copy the desired data (i.e., fractal dimension and lacunarity) results. Transfer the copied data to an Excel file or statistical software.\n\tNOTE: A full listing of the FracLac output data are provided and thoroughly explained in the FracLac for ImageJ manual16."
