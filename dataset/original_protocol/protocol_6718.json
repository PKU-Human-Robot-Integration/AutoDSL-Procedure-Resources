    "Expression and purification of recombinant isoprenyl diphosphate synthase proteinTransform Escherichia coli rosetta-2 cells with plasmid harboring IDS of interest (Here, we have used pET28a:CrGPPS.LSU). The GeneBank loci IDs for nucleotide and protein sequences are JX417183 and AGL91645, respectively. For more information on enzyme characteristics of CrGPPS.LSU, please refer to Rai et al., 2013.Inoculate a single colony in 25 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 37 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 mg/ml kanamycin.Grow overnight (16 h) at 37 °C with 200 rpm and transfer 5 ml of overnight grown culture to 1,000 ml of LB medium with 37 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 mg/ml kanamycin.Place the culture flask in an incubator shaker set at 37 °C and 200 rpm and grow the cells until the OD600 reaches 0.5.Add isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM and continue growing cultures for an additional 18 h at 18 °C.Centrifuge cultures at 6,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain cell pellets.Proceed to the next step or store the pellet at -80 °C until further use.Resuspend cell pellet in lysis buffer with 2-5 ml per gram cell pellet.Add 1 mg/ml lysozyme to the cell suspension and keep on ice for 30 min.Sonicate the cell suspension using a sonicator equipped with microtip and give six 10 s bursts with a 10 s cooling period.Recover the lysate by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and transfer to a 50 ml tube.Take 1 ml of 50% Ni2+-NTA agarose slurry and remove the storage solution by brief centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 15 s and resuspend the Ni2+-NTA agarose in lysis buffer. Add 1 ml of resuspended Ni2+-NTA resin to the recovered lysate in the previous step and keep the tube on rotor shaker for 1 h at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer Ni2+-NTA resin (containing captured His-tagged protein) to the 0.8 x 4 cm Poly-Prep chromatography column and allow to settle by gravity.Equilibrate the column with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Imidazole.Wash the Ni2+-NTA resin with 5 column volumes of wash buffer containing 20 mM Imidazole to remove the unbound protein.Elute the bound protein and collect the fractions with 3 ml of elution buffer containing 250 mM Imidazole.Equilibrate PD-10 desalting column with 4 ml of storage solution and transfer protein eluant to the column.Add 2 ml storage buffer and collect eluant in 0.5 ml fractions (E1-E4).Load 30 µl protein sample on 10% SDS gel and perform electrophoresis in Tris-Glycine (TG) buffer.Determine the concentration of purified protein using the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976).Isoprenyl diphosphate synthase assayPerform IDS assay by adding equimolar concentrations (10 µM to 80 µM) of IPP and DMAPP, IPP and GPP, and IPP and FPP in a final volume of 200 µl of assay buffer in separate 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes.Add 5 µg of purified IDS enzyme (CrGPPS.LSU in this assay) to each tube to initiate the reaction.Take three separate 1.5 ml tubes and add 5 µg of heat inactivated (95 °C for 10 min) CrGPPS.LSU for negative controls in a final volume of 200 µl of assay buffer containing equimolar concentrations (40 µM) of IPP and DMAPP, IPP and GPP, and IPP and FPP.Incubate all tubes containing IDS assay reaction mixture at 30 °C in a circulating water bath or ThermoMixer for 6 h.Add 200 µl of dephosphorylation buffer and continue to incubate for 16 h at 30 °C in a ThermoMixer to hydrolyze all diphosphate esters (unreacted substrates as well as prenyl products).Add 1 ml n-hexane and vortex vigorously for 30 s to extract the hydrolyzed reaction products and substrates (prenyl alcohols).",
    "Centrifuge for 30 s at 12,000 x g, 25 °C.Carefully transfer the upper hexane fraction (approximately 800 µl) containing the prenyl alcohols to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube using a 1 ml pipette.Concentrate the collected hexane fraction containing the prenyl alcohols to 25 µl using a SpeedVac (at 30 °C for 30 min) and immediately use it for TLC analysis.Determination of IDS product profileTake a 500 ml beaker and add mobile phase solvent to a depth of about 0.5 cm. Seal the beaker with parafilm, swirl it gently and allow it to stand for 2 to 5 min for saturation of the chamber.Take a reverse phase TLC silica gel plate with a dimension of 5.0 x 7.5 cm. Draw a horizontal line with a pencil, 1 cm above from both edges of the bottom.Mark five spots along the line on TLC silica gel plates at equidistance (approximately 5-7 mm apart) for applying hexane fraction containing prenyl alcohols.Prepare prenyl alcohol standard solution in hexane containing 40 µM each of geraniol, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol.Use a 10 µl pipette to carefully spot the samples on the marked spots of TLC silica gel plate. After spotting each sample, blow gently on the TLC plate to evaporate the solvent.Spot the standard solution containing GOH, FOH, and GGOH in lane S.Spot 20 µl of the concentrated hexane fraction of negative control at lane number 1.Spot 20 µl hexane of the extracted prenyl alcohol products from different enzymatic reactions on the corresponding TLC plates (Figure 2).Use tweezers to place the prenyl alcohols spotted TLC silica gel plate in the beaker containing the mobile phase.Perform TLC chromatographic separation by sealing the beaker with parafilm and allow solvent front to rise upward.",
    "Take out the TLC silica gel plate from the beaker just before the solvent front reaches the top end (about 15 min), mark the solvent front with a pencil and allow the TLC silica gel plate to dry for 5-10 min.Stain the TLC plate by exposing it to iodine vapors for 3 to 5 min in a rectangular glass chamber containing iodine crystals (Figure 3b, Kumar et al., 2020).Visualize the prenyl alcohol spots corresponding to product and substrates by comparing with reference standards (Rai et al., 2013).Document the TLC image with prenyl alcohol spots using a digital camera or scanner.The documented product spots can be relatively quantified using ImageJ software.Verification of prenyl alcohol productsAfter documenting the TLC images, circle the spots and scrape the corresponding spots of prenyl diphosphate products parallel to the reference compounds using TLC scraper.Elute the prenyl diphosphate product and reference compound in methanol.Concentrate the eluted compounds under N2 gas stream.Perform standard liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) according to the protocol described in Kumar et al. (2020) in a positive mode to confirm prenyl diphosphate products and to rule out any possible contamination from acid hydrolysis reactions (Figure 3c, Kumar et al., 2020)."
