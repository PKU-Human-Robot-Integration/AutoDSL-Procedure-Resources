    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmunofluorescent labeling\nTiming: 5–9 days\nImmunofluorescent labeling of synaptic proteins allows for visualization and identification of synaptic loci based on measured separation distances between pre- and postsynaptic markers. This protocol demonstrates dual-antibody fluorescent labeling of 50 μm free-floating sections using antibodies against the presynaptic marker synapsin and the postsynaptic marker PSD-95. Below we present two possible anti-synapsin antibodies that can be used. Guinea pig anti-synapsin 1/2 is a convenient choice to avoid species cross-reactivity. Mouse anti-synapsin 1 is a suitable option as well that limits lot-to-lot variability. NOTE: SEQUIN has been validated in female and male mice 8 weeks-18 months of age.\nRinse sections three times in 1× PBS to remove cryoprotectant.\nFill 6 well plate with PBS (∼12 mL/well) and add netwell inserts.\nFill 1 L beaker with distilled water.\nUsing a clean paintbrush, carefully move sections to netwells. Ensure sections are fully submerged.\nRinse on shaker at low speed for 5 min.\nFill another 6 well plate with PBS and move netwells from first plate to second.\nRinse on shaker at low speed for 5 min.\nRepeat steps 1e and 1f for 3 washes total.\nBlock in 20% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) blocking buffer to prevent non-specific antibody binding (see “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nAdd blocking buffer to wells of a separate plate: ∼500 μL/well for a 24 well plate (up to 4 sections/well); ∼750 μL/well for a 12 well plate (up to 8 sections/well).\nUsing a clean paintbrush, carefully move sections from netwells with PBS to plates with blocking buffer.\nCover and incubate at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) on shaker at low speed for 1 h.\nPrepare primary antibody solutions while sections are incubating in blocking buffer.",
    "Critical: The steps below describe a method of preparing these solutions using “master mixes” of various primary antibodies to avoid well-to-well variation in antibody concentration resulting from pipetting error. Allow ∼500 μL/well for a 24 well plate (up to 4 sections/well) or ∼750 μL/well for a 12 well plate (up to 8 sections/well).\nPrepare appropriate volumes of antibody “master mixes”: Master mixes are separate, 2× working solutions of each primary antibody (anti-PSD-95 or anti-synapsin) prepared in antibody buffer (see “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”). When mixed 1:1 with a master mix of the other primary antibody (or with an equivalent volume of antibody buffer for the no-primary or channel alignment controls), the final working concentration is 1×. For experiments entailing >2 primary antibodies, master mixes will need to be further concentrated (e.g., 3× for 3 antibodies). Mix well.\nCentrifuge mixture at 10,000–17,000 × g for 5 min.\nAvoid pellet when pipetting antibody.\nCombine master mixes to create final experimental (anti-PSD-95 master mix + anti-synapsin master mix 1:1), channel alignment control (anti-PSD-95 master mix + antibody buffer 1:1), and no-primary control (either anti-PSD-95 master mix OR anti-synapsin master mix + antibody buffer 1:1) antibody solutions.\nIncubate sections for 16–24 h in these antibody labeling solutions at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) on a shaker.\nUsing a paintbrush, carefully transfer tissue from blocking buffer plate to primary antibody plate. Ensure sections are submerged and mobile.\nFill empty wells with distilled water, cover.\nIncubate for 16–24 h at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) on shaker at a low speed.\nRinse three times for 5 min each in 1× PBS to remove unbound primary antibody by repeating step 1.\nPrepare secondary antibodies.\nCalculate total volume of each antibody mixture to be used (same per-well volumes as for primary antibody labeling). Creation of master mixes is unnecessary for secondary antibodies.",
    "Prepare fresh antibody buffer (see “Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nAdd appropriate volumes of antibodies to buffer.\nMix well.\nCentrifuge mixture at 10,000–17,000 × g for 5 min.\nAvoid pellet when pipetting antibody.\nIncubate sections in secondary antibody (NOTE: although modern fluorophores are relatively photostable, it is advisable to protect solutions and tissue labeled with fluorophores from prolonged or bright illumination).\nPlate secondary antibodies.\nTransfer tissue from PBS to secondary antibody. Ensure sections are submerged and able to move freely.\nIncubate on shaker at slow speed for 4 h at 20°C–24°C (room temperature). Continue to steps 8 and 9 while incubating.\nPrepare mounting media.\nCalculate total volume required (150 μL/slide).\nMix AF300 and MWL-488 in 1:9 ratio.\nVortex well.\nCentrifuge until bubbles are gone.\nClean 1.5H coverslips with distilled water, then 100% ethanol, and allow to dry in a warmer at 60°C.\nCritical: It is paramount that coverslips are spotless. Repeat washes as necessary until clean.\nAfter incubation in secondary antibodies, rinse sections three times in 1× PBS per step 1\nMount tissue and coverslip.\nMount free-floating sections in 1× PBS. The maximum number of sections mounted per slide is dependent on the XY range of the available microscope stage.\nAllow to dry in flat, dark location.\nImmediately after tissue has completely dried and adheres to the slide (∼5–10 min), dunk slide in distilled water 5× quickly to remove salt residue.\nAllow to dry again in dark, flat location (∼2–10 min).\nApply 150 μL mountant prepared above per slide by distributing among each section on the slide. Larger mountant volumes may be necessary if working with large numbers of sections.\nSlowly apply coverslip to avoid bubbles and apply gentle pressure to expel excess mountant.\nStore in dark, flat place at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) for mountant to cure.",
    "Critical: allow at least 3 and ideally 7 days after coverslipping for refractive index to plateau as mountant cures.\nPause Point: coverslipped slides can be stored protected from light at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) for at least one month.\nOptional: Between steps 9 and 10, DAPI may be applied to visualize nuclei. To do so, rinse sections once for 5 min in PBS, incubate in 1:50,000 DAPI in PBS at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) in the same volume used for primary and secondary antibodies for 10–15 min, and then return sections to netwells and continue with step 10.\nOptional: label with other/alternate markers (for primary synaptic analysis or subset analysis).\nOptional: While above protocol is designed for free-float microtome-cut sections, a modified version of this protocol is also effective using 15 μm cryostat-cut sections. For this variation, tissue is mounted on slides prior to immunolabeling.\nImage acquisition\nTiming: 10 min to set up, 5 min for each image acquired (acquisition can be automated)\nThe below protocol describes a typical acquisition suitable for SEQUIN analysis. Other parameters may suffice or be necessary for certain experimental aims.\nSet up microscope.\nTurn on Zeiss Airyscan microscope.\nTurn on light source.\nSelect 63× 1.4 NA oil objective on the microscope display.\nClean objective with lens cleaner.\nMount Z-Piezo, a slide holder allowing for greater precision in Z translation.\nApply Zeiss 518F immersion oil to objective.\nConfigure software.\nOpen the Zen Black software, click “start system.”\nWhile software loads, ensure slide is clean. (Note: use distilled water and lens cleaner to clean the cover glass.)\nInsert slide in Z-Piezo and tighten knobs securing slide until finger-tight. Slide should be firmly immobilized. If performing long/unsupervised scans slide should be first loosely placed in the piezo and then firmly secured with dental wax.\nNavigate to “Maintain” tab.",
    "Confirm objective listed in the software matches objective shown in the freestanding microscope control box.\nIn the “System Options” box, navigate to the “Hardware” tab and ensure “Extended Z-Piezo” is unchecked.\nNavigate to the Airyscan menu within this tab and ensure “Adjust in continuous scans” and “Weak or sparse samples” are checked and “Adjust in slow time series” is unchecked.\nSet experimental parameters.\nMove to “Acquisitions” tab.\nChoose “8-bit” bit depth.\nChoose “bidirectional” scan mode.\nUse a zoom of greater or equal to 1.8× to facilitate post-acquisition Airyscan processing.\nChoose “Line” scan mode.\nDesign appropriate light paths to image the fluorophores being used.\nFor each light path, select the appropriate laser to be used. For the fluorophores applied in this protocol, the 488 and 561 nm laser lines are used.\nOpen pinhole to maximum size.\nSet gain to 800.\nConfigure the light path. For the above fluorophores on the Airyscan system, the 488/561 main beam splitter is one appropriate option. Set the secondary beam splitter to “Plate” and the emission filter to “BP 420–480 + BP 495–620” (these emission filters allow for line scan imaging of both fluorophores).\nClick “Optimal” to set XY pixel resolution of all channels selected. Note that all channels being imaged should be selected before clicking “Optimal.”\nNavigate to region of interest (ROI) using epifluorescence light source and oculars (“Locate” tab in Zen Black).\nSet up imaging Z-stack.\nEnsure “Z-stack” is enabled in the top left corner of the “Acquisitions” tab.\nIn the “Z-stack” window, Check “Use Piezo.”\nSet Z-stack configuration to “First-Last” mode.\nSelect one of the laser channels and click “Live” in the top left panel of the “Acquisitions” tab.",
    "Using Z-Piezo control knob, find the cut edge of the tissue at the cover glass. (NOTE: it may help to “Best fit” the display parameters to visualize signal.)\nFind the most superficial Z position that avoids irregularity at the cut surface (the first optical section in which the entire field is intact) and choose “set first” in the Z-stack control windows.\nRotate the piezo focus control to find the deepest tissue section that avoids surface irregularity and select “set last.”\nNavigate to the center of the stack (click “c” on the Z-stack diagram in the “Z-stack” window).\nWithin the Z-stack window, set the step size (“Interval”) to 120 nm to modestly oversample in Z, and set the number of optical sections (“Slices”) to 35. Note that other stack thicknesses (number of optical sections) or step sizes (Z intervals) may be appropriate for a given experiment, though increasing step size will lead to some reduction in Z-resolution and puncta detection (with the advantage of faster scan speeds).\nScroll through the entirety of the now shorter stack (4.08 μm centered in the section) and ensure qualitative suitability of all optical sections (NOTE: see “Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” section for examples of problematic optical sections).\nTurn off “Live” mode.\nAlign Airyscan detector.\nTurn on “Continuous mode.”\nWhile continuous mode is running, open the Airyscan view on the display window. A display of the 32 detectors is depicted. The brightest detector should be the central element. If not, give the scope several moments to auto-adjust. Do not proceed until the brightest detector is centered.\nSet up laser ramping.\nCheck the “Z-correction” box in the Z-stack window.\nSelect the first channel to laser ramp for and start “Continuous” mode.\nMove to the deepest position of the Z-stack.",
    "Change the laser intensity of the selected channel until the lower 1/3 of the dynamic range of pixel intensity is occupied, as represented by the histogram in the “Display” tab.\nMove to the first position in the Z-stack and find the laser intensity that best replicates the signal acquired at the deepest position.\nRepeat this for all channels.\nWhen desired laser ramp is set for all channels, move back to the most superficial position, select all channels, and enter the laser intensity for the first position for each. Then, click “Add position” in the Z-stack window.\nMove to the last position and repeat.\nEnsure acquisition speed is set to maximum.\nNow, select “begin experiment” to begin the scan (duration is approximately 5 min for above parameters).\nWhen image acquisition is complete, save image. Before proceeding with further imaging, Airyscan process the image (see Image Processing below) and check the orthogonal view to ensure consistent Z intensity (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). If brightness is not consistent, move to a different field and reset the laser ramp.\nOptional: Zoom can be varied to any value greater than 1.8×. Increasing zoom will decrease scan time but yield a smaller field and therefore smaller sample size.\nOptional: While this protocol discusses imaging synaptic markers that emit in the green and red portions of the visible light spectrum, SEQUIN can be completed with alternate or additional fluorophores. However, settings for lasers, filter sets, and scanning mode must be adjusted.\nOptional: Using microscope settings not discussed in this protocol, large automated scans can be set up to cover many contiguous or non-contiguous ROIs, as described in Sauerbeck et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nImage pre-processing\nTiming: 1–2 min/image (can be largely automated)",
    "SEQUIN analysis post-acquisition consists of image pre-processing, puncta detection, and pre-to-postsynaptic puncta separation analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Image pre-processing consists of Airyscan processing (pixel reassignment and hardware-enabled deconvolution) and channel alignment (channel shifting to correct for chromatic aberration) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/371-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. SEQUIN workflow\nOverview of the SEQUIN data analysis workflow. Software associated with each step is listed in blue. Figure adapted with permission from Sauerbeck et al.

Image pre-processing\n(A) Single detector (central detector) image prior to Airyscan processing (above) and the Airyscan processed result (below).\n(B) Channel alignment image shown with orthogonal views before (upper left) and after (lower left) adjustment. Panels to right depict process for determining and correcting chromatic aberration in Z, involving a temporary transposition in Y.\nAiryscan Processing.\nSelect “Processing” tab within Zen Black and choose “Airyscan Process” from dropdown menu.\nWith the image of interest open, choose “Select Image.”\nSet Airyscan strength to 6. Note: this value was determined by automatically determining the Airyscan strength for many images in Zeiss Zen. The lowest auto-determined Airyscan strength tended to hover near 6. It is reasonable to similarly empirically determine this value at the outset for a given system and experiment, then apply it to the entire dataset.\nChoose “3D” option.\nClick “Apply.”\nSave new image as CZI.\nChannel Alignment of Airyscan Processed images (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nFind channel alignment value\nSelect “Processing” tab within Zen Black.\nChoose “Channel Align” from dropdown menu in left sidebar.\nOpen previously acquired and Airyscan Processed channel alignment image and choose “Select Image” in the left sidebar.\nUnselect “Fit.”\nOffset one channel in Y such that channels are no longer overlapping to facilitate visualization of chromatic aberration.\nClick “Apply” to create a new image.",
    "View the orthogonal projection of this image and focus on one dual-labeled punctum. Manually shift the Z value for one of the channels until the channel images are fully aligned. Record the Z value offset.\nOnce image has been aligned, confirm suitability of adjustment value on multiple puncta throughout the image.\nWhile XY correction is generally unnecessary when using the recommended 63× oil objective and filter sets, other combinations may require XY channel alignment. It is advisable to empirically determine degree of shift for a given system and light path.\nChannel align experimental images.\nWhile in “Processing” tab, choose “Channel Alignment” and open and select experimental image to be channel aligned.\nUnselect “Fit.”\nInput the recorded Z offset and save the new CZI.\nOptional: Airyscan processing can be batched. To do so, click “Run Batch” in the bottom of the window and select the files to be processed. Ensure “Auto” is unselected, strength is set to 6.0, and “3D” is selected.\nPuncta detection\nTiming: 1–2 min/image (can be largely automated)\nUsing Imaris, puncta are detected in the three-dimensional Airyscan processed, channel-aligned image. This will yield X, Y, and Z coordinates of the centroid of each puncta as well as metadata such as average intensity of each punctum. Although a minimal amount of coding experience is required, a SEQUIN Python code that accomplishes the tasks below is also available (https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN[href=https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN]) if Imaris software is not.\nPlace all Airyscan processed and channel-aligned images in a single folder.\nNote all images must have the same Z dimensions.\nSelect images in Imaris (below steps describe spot creation using Imaris v9.5, but other versions are suitable with minor adaptations).\nOpen Imaris.\nClick “Observe Folder” and navigate to folder of CZI images.\nChoose “Select Folder;” folder will be added to list of “Observed Folders.”",
    "Open folder in Imaris (double-click).\nSelect all images in the folder, right click, and select “convert to IMS.”\nCreate spots (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/371-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Puncta detection in tissue\nThree-dimensional image taken in mouse cortex labeled with PSD-95 and Synapsin. Panels to right show puncta detection and rendering using Imaris, with appropriate filtering applied to remove puncta at the edges of the image.\nSelect “New Batch” in top menu.\nWhen a preview of the image appears, select “Next” to begin object creation.\nTo create spots, click “Spots” button. Create spots for each channel for analysis.\nSet parameters for channel, size, and boundaries of spot creation in the “Create” window.\n“Algorithm Settings”: leave all unchecked. Advance to next screen.\n“Source Channel”: choose the source channel for spots detection.\nUnder “Spot Detection” (same screen).\nCheck “Model PSF-elongation” along Z-axis and “Background Subtraction.”\n“Estimated XY Diameter” for punctum is generally set to 0.2 μM.\nIndicated X,Y, and Z puncta dimensions are appropriate for the indicated imaging parameters including the 63× 1.4 NA objective, but may require modification for alternate set-ups or objectives.\n“Estimated Z Diameter” for punctum is generally set to 0.6 μM.\nNavigate to the next screen.\n“Classify Spots”: perform edge filtering (exclude spots not entirely contained within image boundaries).\nCreate two filters by clicking the plus sign twice.\nHighlight one filter and change it to “Distance to Image Border XY Img=1” above automatic threshold.\nSet the leftmost value of this filter to 0.1 μm (half XY diameter from above) and ensure rightmost value is not activated.\nChange the second filter to “Position Z.”\nSet the left and right values so they are 0.3 μm (half Z diameter from above) from the extremes. (ex: an image that ranged from 0.06 to 4.14 in Z would be filtered to between 0.36 to 3.84).",
    "Click the green arrow to complete the setup process for this analysis.\nRepeat step 26 for all channels in need of puncta detection.\nWhen all spots have been created and edited, choose the “OK” button in the Objects window.\nName the batch.\nRight click the new batch and select “Run Batch” to run on all images in the folder. After the batch finishes, export the results in the CSV file format.\nCritical: Confirm identity of spots in output folders. Software conventions can cause confusion in the identity of datasets. Imaris renames spot statistics data (e.g., “Spot_1_Statistics,” “Spot_2_Statistics,” etc.) and output folders based on the alphabetical order of the user-defined spots names (assigned in step 28). It is important to confirm the identity of these datasets by checking the batch name listed in column H of any of the CSV files output by Imaris within a given output folder.\nPre-to-postsynaptic puncta separation analysis\nTiming: dependent on computational resources; <1 min/image (automated) on high-end workstations",
    "Using MATLAB, Euclidian distances between the centroids of pre- and postsynaptic puncta are measured for each pre- or postsynaptic punctum in 3 dimensions, yielding raw as well as binned separation data (sorted by separation distance). One marker, which can be pre- or postsynaptic, is used as the reference dataset, and the nearest neighbor from the other dataset will be matched to each puncta in the referenced set (while either pre- or postsynaptic puncta can serve as the reference dataset, all examples shown reference PSD-95). All needed code is available on GitHub (see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The Pre-to-Postsynaptic Puncta Separation Analysis utilizes two MATLAB codes (“SEQUINv3.m” and “compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m”), each with an associated txt file that specifies their parameters (“Analysis parameters.txt” and “Compile Excel Docs parameters.txt,” respectively). The general protocol involves specifying the parameters and running the analysis with SEQUINv3.m, then compiling the data with compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m with its user-specified parameters.\nIn many cases, only the top 20% brightest pre- and postsynaptic puncta are analyzed. Spots of lower intensity contain fewer puncta pairs consistent with synapses, though this is dependent on antibody and marker choice and should be experimentally determined (Sauerbeck et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We recommend puncta separation analysis is performed on a system containing at minimum a multicore processor and 8 GB RAM.\nDownload “SEQUINv3.m,” “Analysis parameters.txt,” “compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m,” and “Compile Excel Docs parameters.txt” from https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN[href=https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN]. The “.m” files contain the necessary MATLAB code, and the “.txt” file contains the user-specified parameters necessary to run each code.\nAnalyze separation distances.\nOpen MATLAB.\nWithin the MATLAB “Current Folder” window, navigate to the folder containing the SEQUINv3 code.\nEdit the “Analysis parameters.txt” file to reflect all needed parameters. Note that additional instructions are found within the txt file.",
    "Whichever spot data is listed as “Spot1” in the user-updated “Analysis parameters.txt” document will be used as the referenced dataset for nearest neighbor analysis.\nPaste all the text of the user-updated “Analysis parameter.txt” file into MATLAB’s command window and press “enter.” This will call the SEQUINv3 script to analyze the data, which will appear in a newly created “data output” folder.\nCompile Pre-to-Postsynaptic Puncta Separation Analysis data into one workbook.\nWithin the MATLAB “Current Folder” window, navigate to the folder containing the compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m code (if this differs from the location of the SEQUINv3.m code).\nEdit the “Compile Excel Docs parameters.txt” file to reflect all needed parameters. Note that additional instructions are found within the txt file.\nPaste all the text of the user-updated “Compile Excel Docs parameters.txt” file into MATLAB’s command window and press “enter.” This will call the compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3 script to compile all Pre-to-Postsynaptic Puncta Separation Analysis outputs of the SEQUINv3 code into a single file into the newly created “compileddata” folder.\nData representation (optional)\nTiming: 3 min\nRetrieve generated pre-to-postsynaptic separation distances.\nThe Nearest Neighbor code will create a “data output” folder where the input Imaris data was located. The “compile Excel docs” code will create a “compileddata” folder inside of “data output.”\nThe tab “Normal Frequency” within the Excel doc will contain frequency distributions of images sorted into bins of 20 nm. Each column represents a different image.\nGraph data.\nPlot the frequency distribution data found on the “Normal Frequency” tab in the Excel doc against a geometric series “10 nm, 30 nm, 50 nm, […]”. This series represents the center of the histogram bins. All graphs shown and subsequent quantifications were modeled using GraphPad Prism, but any statistical software package can be used."
