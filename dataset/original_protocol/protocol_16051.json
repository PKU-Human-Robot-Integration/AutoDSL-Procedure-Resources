    "This protocol describes the generation of MEFs from mouse embryos at E13.5. Mouse embryos are dissected from the pregnant female by removing the uterine horns under non-sterile conditions. The uterine horns are transferred to a laminar flow hood for further preparation under aseptic conditions. First, the uterine horns are rinsed twice in sterile DPBS-/- with antibiotic-antimycotic, followed by removing individual embryos from the uterine tissue. The yolk sac and placenta are then removed, and the exposed embryos are rinsed in sterile DPBS-/- with antibiotic-antimycotic. Before tissue dissociation, the embryo is decapitated, and fetal organs are dissected. The embryonic tissue is finely minced in trypsin-EDTA with DNAse, resuspended multiple times, and digested for 15 min at 37°C. Digestion is stopped by adding MEF harvest medium. If large tissue aggregates remain, the tissue suspension can be passed through a cell strainer or directly transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube, spun, and the supernatant aspirated. The tissue pellet is resuspended in MEF harvest medium and transferred to a T25 flask. The following day, the medium is refreshed to remove non-attached cells, tissue aggregates, and debris. The T25 flask should be between 70% to 90% confluent.\nNOTE: As mentioned above, all animal work must comply with national and institutional requirements for the use of animals in research.\nNOTE: Pregnant female mice are humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation. This procedure is performed according to approved standard operating procedures. The uterine horns are immediately placed on ice until the embryos have been decapitated according to the approved institutional protocols.\nNOTE: To minimize the risk of contamination, the female mouse is extensively sprayed with ethanol, and tissue harvest and dissociation are performed under aseptic conditions.\nNOTE: MEFs should be cultured in complete MEF medium without antibiotic-antimycotic after the first passage.",
    "NOTE: If MEFs are kept in long-term culture, i.e., for immortalization, testing the culture for mycoplasma is recommended.\nMaterials\nMice (female and male, 8-10 weeks of age)\nMEF harvest medium (see recipe)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), high glucose GibcoTM (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 11965092)\nFetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Prepare 3 (or more) additional 10-cm tissue culture plates by adding 2 ml sterile DPBS-/- 2% FBS using a 5-ml sterile serological pipette.",
    "These plates will be used to remove the yolk sac and placenta, head, and non-mesenchymal (red) organs. Two embryos should be processed per plate. The number of plates will depend on the number of embryos. If there are more than six embryos in the uterus, prepare additional plates after dissection of the uterine horns. To avoid cross-contamination when isolating MEFs from transgenic mouse strains and embryos with different genotypes, process one embryo per 10-cm tissue culture plate.\n5. Add 2 ml/well sterile DPBS-/- 2% FBS to two 12-well tissue culture plates and place on ice.\nThe two 12-well tissue culture plates are used to rinse the embryos in sterile DPBS-/- 2% FBS after removing the yolk sac and placenta and before tissue dissociation (1-2 wells/embryo).\n6. Add 1 ml/well sterile DPBS-/- 2% FBS to a 12-well tissue culture plate and place on ice.\nThe embryos will be stored on this plate on ice until they are processed.\n7. Prepare two 50-ml Falcon tubes by adding 40 ml DPBS-/- 2% FBS (see recipe) per tube. These will be used to immerse the uterine horns in succession.\n8.

If embryos are isolated from transgenic animals, and embryos with different genotypes are expected, change dissection forceps between embryos to avoid cross-contamination.\n19. Transfer the embryo to a fresh 10-cm tissue culture plate containing 2 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA with DNase I (final concentration: 15 kU/ml) at room temperature (RT).\nDepending on personal preference, 10- or 6-cm tissue culture plates can be used for tissue homogenization. Prepare an appropriate volume of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA with DNAse I (final concentration: 15 kU/ml) and add 2 ml to each 10-cm tissue culture plate.\n20. Mince embryo tissue finely with a sterile blade at RT until the tissue suspension becomes smooth and gloopy in consistency (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.921#cpz1921-fig-0001]).\n21. Tilt plate and resuspend the tissue suspension with a 1-ml filter pipette tip.\n22. Place a support (i.e., a 5- or 10-ml sterile serological pipette) under the plate to keep it at an angle and place in an incubator.\nAlternatively, transfer the tissue suspension to a 15-ml Falcon tube and place in a rack in the tissue culture incubator.\n23. Incubate the tissue suspension at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 15 min.\n24. Add 4 ml warm MEF harvest medium to inactivate the 0.25% trypsin-EDTA with DNase I.\n25. Pipette the tissue suspension up and down with a 5-ml sterile serological pipette until it is homogenous and transfer to a 15-ml Falcon tube. Keep at RT until all embryos are processed.",
    "Optional: If large tissue aggregates are visible, the suspension can be passed through a 100-μm cell strainer into a 50-ml Falcon tube to remove undigested tissue aggregates, then transfer to a 15-ml Falcon tube.\n26. Spin the tissue suspension at 500 × g and RT for 5 min using a benchtop centrifuge to pellet the cells.\n27. Carefully aspirate the supernatant using a sterile aspiration pipette and vacuum trap, or use a 10-ml sterile serological pipette if a vacuum trap is unavailable.\n28. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml prewarmed MEF harvest medium and transfer to a T25 flask.\n29. Incubate for approximately 24 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2 under humidified conditions.\nSome companies recommend 5% to 10% CO2 using DMEM with sodium bicarbonate buffer (3.7 g/L).\n30. Check cell confluency the following day using an inverted microscope. If cell confluency has reached 80% to 90%, passage MEFs into a T75 flask for expansion or process for cryopreservation (see Supporting Protocol) (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.921#cpz1921-fig-0002]).\nIf cells have not reached 80% confluency, change the MEF medium to remove debris and tissue aggregates by aspirating the medium using a vacuum trap and replacing it with fresh prewarmed (∼37°C) MEF harvest medium.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e9dad7d4-e677-4055-94ce-73cacbb82784/cpz1921-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMEFs in culture.

Aspirate DPBS-/- with a sterile aspiration pipette using a vacuum trap.\n35. Add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the monolayer to detach adhered MEFs.\nThe volume depends on flask size: T25 flask, 0.5 ml-1 ml; T75 flask, 2 ml.\n36. Incubate the flask at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for around 5 min or until cells have detached.\nCheck the level of cell detachment using the inverted microscope. Tapping the side of the flask facilitates cell lifting.\n37. Inactivate the 0.25% trypsin-EDTA digest by adding MEF culture medium and resuspending using a 5- or 10-ml sterile serological pipette.\nThe volume depends on flask size: T25 flask, 4 ml; T75 flask, 8 ml.\n38. Transfer an aliquot of the cell suspension to a Beckman Coulter Counter cup using a 300-μl filter pipette tip and perform a cell count using a Beckman Coulter Counter (according to manufacturer instructions: Beckman Coulter Z series User Manual 9914591-DA), an equivalent cell counter, or count manually using a hematocytometer (according to manufacturer instructions).\n39. Transfer cells within the optimal MEF density range of ∼2- to 4 × 104 cells/cm2 to a fresh T75 flask and add MEF culture medium to a volume of 20 ml.\n40. Incubate the T75 flask at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in a tissue culture incubator.\n41. Check cell confluency daily using an inverted microscope. Freeze (see Support Protocol 1) or passage the cells when they reach 80%-90% confluency.",
    "MEFs can be cryopreserved at P0 if >80% confluent or after expansion at P1-5. The cells can be frozen naïve or, if isolated for use as feeder cells, after mitotic inactivation (Conner, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.921#cpz1921-bib-0003]). When freezing mammalian cells, it is important to use a cryoprotective agent that prevents damage to the cell membrane by blocking ice crystal formation. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) is most routinely used in mammalian tissue culture. Another aspect important for cryopreservation is the controlled gradual decrease in temperature at approximately −1°C per minute down to −80°C. Optimal cell recovery post cryopreservation requires rapid thawing of the cryovial and optimal cell density. To maintain high-quality cryopreserved MEFs, cryovials should be transferred to liquid nitrogen or specialized ultralow freezers (−150°C) for long-term storage.\nMaterials\nMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)\n70% (v/v) EtOH (Labchem, 5 L, cat. no.
