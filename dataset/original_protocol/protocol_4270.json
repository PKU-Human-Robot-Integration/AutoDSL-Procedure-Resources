    "Note: Streak S. pyogenes strain MGAS 315 on a BHI agar plate (or other plates supporting the growth of your bacteria, including blood agar and THY agar plates) and allow to incubate overnight at 37 °C until single colonies are visible. Inoculate one colony of MGAS 315 in 5 ml BHI in a 15 ml tube. Incubate overnight at 37 °C.Preheat BHI by adding 45 ml BHI to a 50 ml tube, and incubate overnight at 37 °C.Transfer the 5 ml overnight culture of MGAS 315 into the preheated BHI (1:10 dilution), and incubate until OD600 ∼ 0.3. The time for the culture to reach this OD600 varies depending on what strain is used, but will in general take 3-4 h for S. pyogenes. Note: Cells can be taken at other OD600 values, but bacteria are generally more susceptible to the effect of endogenously added lysins when in mid log phase as compared to stationary phase cells. Therefore it is recommended to do a growth curve of your bacteria to determine the mid log phase before conducting any further experiments.Harvest cells by centrifugation (4,000 x g; 15 min; 4 °C).Discard supernatant, and wash cells three times in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) (4,000 x g; 15 min; 4 °C).Note: Other buffers might prove more efficient for other peptidoglycan degrading enzymes, but buffers in the pH-range 6-8 are usually a good starting point since bacteria generally tolerate this pH well, and most lysins are highly active within this pH range.Resuspend the washed cells in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) to an OD600 ∼ 1.4.Note: For best experimental resolution, a final OD600 of 0.5-1.0 is recommended. Washed cells will be diluted 1:1 in upcoming steps, yielding a final OD600 = 0.7.",
    "Add 100 μl washed cells to the wells of a sterile 96-well plate.Note: For consistency and statistical reliability, we recommend all samples to be run in at least triplicates.Add 100 μl buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)] containing divalent cations at varying concentrations.CaCl2: 0-100 mMMgCl2: 0-100 mMZnCl2: 0-5 mMNote: Since many endolysins rely on the presence of divalent cations for their activity, it is critical to optimize this condition before moving on to other optimizations. Several other divalent cations might affect the activity of lysins, including but not limited to Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+.Add 1 μg of your peptidoglycan hydrolyzing protein (PlyPy).Note: The amount of lysin needed to be added is dependent on the activity of the lysin and needs to be determined empirically. A few μg lysin is a good starting point.Insert the 96-well plate into the SpectraMax Plus Reader, and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 60 min. Shake the plate and measure the OD600 every 30 sec.Plot the data in an Excel sheet and analyze the results.Repeat steps 9-12, including the necessary divalent cations at an empirically determined concentration in the buffer, but now optimize the conditions for other factors, including but not limited to:NaCl: 0-1,000 mMDTT: 0-20 mM Temperature: 20-50 °CTo determine the optimal pH, exchange the 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) used in steps 6, 7 and 9 to buffers of your choice, including but not limited to:20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0)20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5)20 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.0)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.0)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.",
    "8)To finally determine the activity of your lysin:Wash and resuspend your cells in activity buffer (optimized buffer based on your empirical values) to an OD600 ∼ 1.4.Add 100 μl cells and 100 μl activity buffer to each well in a 96-well plate.Note: Take into account that the maximum volume in the wells will be 200 μl. Therefore, less than 100 μl activity buffer will be added to wells that will also contain lysin (diluted in activity buffer). The exact volume depends on your initial concentration of the lysin.Add your lysin in serial dilutions, ranging from 0.1-51.2 μg/ml.Note: It is important to run all samples in triplicates to account for any outliers. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C in a SpectraPlus Max Reader, shaking and measuring OD600 of the samples every 30 sec. Plot the data in an Excel sheet and analyze the results.The dilution closest corresponding to a 50% reduction of the starting OD corresponds to 1 Unit (Loeffler et al., 2001). Most characterized lysins have an activity of 0.5-1 U/μg."
