    "All procedures involving animals were performed according to the European Union (EU) Directive 2010/63/EU (transposed to Portuguese legislation by Decreto-Lei 113/2013). The experimental protocol (0421/000/000/2017) was approved by the ethics committee of both the Portuguese Official Authority on animal welfare and experimentation (Direção-Geral de Alimentação e Veterinária - DGAV) and of the host Institution.\n1. Preparation of Culture Media and Other Solutions\nNOTE: Freshly prepare the coating solutions on the day of its use. The unused coating solutions and culture media may be stored at -20 °C or 4 °C as detailed below.\n Prepare 10 mL of a 0.05% (v/v) Poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) working solution.\n\t\nPrepare 20 mL of 0.25% (w/v) PEI stock solution by dissolving purified PEI (see Table of Materials) in sterile water.\nDilute 2 mL of 0.25% (w/v) PEI stock solution in 8 mL of sterile distilled water. Mix well and use. Unused solution can be stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare 1 mL of a 5 µg/mL laminin solution.\n\t\nDilute 5 µL of 1 mg/mL laminin stock solution in 995 µL of basal medium (see Table of Materials).

    "Adjust pH to 0.2-0.3 units below the desired pH 7.4 using 1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH. Add ultrapure water to make up the final solution volume.\n\t\tNOTE pH tends to rise during filtration.\nSterilize by filtration using a 0.22 µm porosity poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane.\nPrepare 10 mL of H-HBSS containing 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (hiFBS).\n\t\nDilute 1 mL of hiFBS in 9 mL of H-HBSS.

Sterilize by filtration using a 0.22 µm porosity PES membrane.\nPrepare 50 mL of supplemented medium.\n\t\nIn a 50 mL conical tube, mix 48.5 mL of basal medium (see Table of Materials), 2% (v/v) B-27 supplement, 0.5 mM L-glutamine and 1% Pen/Strep (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin). Supplemented medium can be stored at 4 °C for 3-4 weeks.\n2. Microfluidic and MEA Devices Preparation\nNOTE: Perform steps 2.1-2.11 on the day before cell seeding.\nClean microfluidic devices to remove fabrication and other debris using vinyl tape. Gently press the tape against the device to reach all areas of the device.\nAir plasma-clean the MEA for 3 min (0.3 mbar) to clean the surface and make it more hydrophilic.\nBriefly submerge microfluidic devices in 70% ethanol and allow them to air-dry inside a laminar flow hood.\nPlace each MEA in a sterile 90 mm Petri dish and sterilize them by 15 min of ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.\nCoat the MEA central surface area by incubating with 500 µL of 0.05% (v/v) PEI solution for at least 1 h at 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: As described by others17, PEI coating of MEAs results in less cell clustering than using poly(lysine) coating.\nAspirate the PEI coating solution from the MEA surface and wash MEAs 4x with 1 mL of sterile distilled water. Be careful to not touch the MEA surface during washing steps as this can damage the electrodes.\nGuided by a stereomicroscope inside a laminar flow hood, center the MEA chip and add 1 mL of sterile water to the central area of MEA.\nPlace the microfluidic device on top of the MEA surface.\nCarefully align the microgrooves of microfluidic device with the microelectrode grid of the MEA.\nWhen correctly aligned, carefully aspirate the excess water without touching the MEA or the microfluidic device.\nIncubate the µEFs overnight at 37 °C to dry and allow complete attachment. To facilitate the attachment, gently press the microfluidic device against the MEA.\n\tNOTE: Perform step 2.12 on the day of cell seeding.\nOnce the µEFs have completely dried, load the microfluidic wells with 150 µL of 5 µg/mL laminin coating solution and incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h before cell seeding.\n\tNOTE: When loading µEF with laminin solution, ensure that the solution fills the microgrooves. use a vacuum to remove any air bubble that might be present within the microgrooves.\n3. Prefrontal Cortex Dissection\nPrepare the dissection area for embryo removal.\n\t\nDisinfect the working surface and the surgical instruments with 70% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: Though this dissection is not a sterile procedure, disinfection helps to reduce chances of contamination.\nUse a clean disposable diaper to confine the dissection area and lay out the surgical instruments for embryo removal.\nPrepare 4 90 mm Petri dishes filled with cold H-HBSS and place them on a tray with ice near the dissection area.",
    "Euthanize an E-18 time-pregnant Wistar rat by carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation.\nUpon completion of the procedure, remove the animal from the CO2 chamber and confirm death by a secondary method of euthanasia, such as exsanguination.\nPlace the animal ventral side up on the disposable diaper, spray the lower abdomen with 70% ethanol and, with the help of forceps and scissor, make a U-shape cut through the skin to expose the uterus.\nCarefully remove the embryos from the uterus by cutting away any connective tissue and place them in one of the Petri dishes with cold H-HBSS.\nRemove each embryo from its embryonic sac and, with the help of forceps and scissor, decapitate the embryo.\nTransfer the embryo´s head to a second Petri dish filled with cold H-HBSS.\nRepeat steps 3.6 - 3.7 for each embryo.\nDissect the prefrontal cortex.\n\t\nTransfer an embryo´s head to a third Petri dish.\nUse a pair of forceps to expose the brain.\nRemove the brain from its cavity and cover it with cold H-HBSS.\nIf present, remove and discard the olfactory bulbs. Dissect the prefrontal cortex and remove meninges.\nTransfer the prefrontal cortex fragments to a fourth Petri dish filled with cold H-HBSS.\nRepeat the steps 3.9.1 - 3.9.5 for each embryo.\n4. Cortical Neurons Dissociation and Culture on µEF\nNOTE: The following procedures were performed inside a laminar flow hood after a 15 min cycle of UV sterilization. Working surface area as well as all the materials placed inside the hood should be previously disinfected with 70% ethanol.\nAs described in step 1.5, dissolve the previously weighted trypsin in 5 mL of H-HBSS and filter the solution.\nCollect the cortex pieces previously dissected in a total of 5 mL of H-HBSS. Transfer them to a sterile 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Add 2.3 mL of freshly prepared 1.5 mg/mL trypsin solution to the tube containing the cortex fragments.\nMix the suspension and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min (briefly agitate every 5 min).\nStop tissue digestion and wash out trypsin.\n\t\nDiscard the supernatant containing the trypsin. Add 5 mL of H-HBSS containing 10% hiFBS to inactivate the remaining trypsin; gently agitate.\nLet cortex fragments settle down and then discard the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of H-HBSS to remove the hiFBS residues. Let cortex fragments settle down and discard the supernatant.\nWash again the cortex fragments with 5 mL of H-HBSS.\nLet cortex fragments settle down and discard the supernatant. Add 5 mL of supplemented neuronal medium.\nMechanically dissociate cortex fragments with a 5 mL serologic pipette by slowly pipetting up and down for 10-15 times. If necessary, repeat the procedure using a small caliber pipette until the cell suspension become homogenous.\nDiscard the remaining undissociated tissues by filtering the cell suspension trough a 40 µm cell strainer.\nCount viable cells and determine the cell density.\n\t\nIn a microtube, add 20 µL of 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue to a 20 µL cell suspension. Mix well to homogenate the solution and transfer 10 µL to a Neubauer counting chamber.\nCount viable cells and determine the cell density of viable cells.\nAdjust cell density to 3.6 x 107 cells/mL (if needed, centrifuge cell suspension).\nImmediately before cell seeding, remove laminin coating from all wells of the µEF. Pipette 50 µL of supplemented medium to each well of the µEF axonal compartment.\nSeed 5 µL of cell suspension in the µEF somal compartment. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, to allow cells attachment to the substrate.",
    "Gently fill each well of µEF with warmed supplemented medium. Transfer the µEF to a humidifier incubator at 37 °C supplied with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: To avoid quick culture medium evaporation, place an opened microtube filled with water inside the Petri dish carrying the µEF.\nMaintain cultures for the required period by replacing 50% of culture medium every second to third day of culture.\n\tNOTE: After the experiments, the microfluidics can be detached from MEAs by immersing the µEF in water overnight. If needed, gently peel the microfluidics with the help of forceps. MEAs can be cleaned by overnight incubation with a 1% (v/v) commercial enzymatic detergent (see Table of Materials).\n5. Recording Spontaneous Neuronal Activity\nNOTE: Embryonic cortical neuron cultures on MEAs typically exhibit spontaneous activity as soon as 7 days in vitro (DIV), but take 2-3 weeks (14-21 DIV) to mature and exhibit stable activity. It is up to the experimenter to decide when to start the electrophysiological measurements based on the objectives of the study. In this protocol, the recording of neuronal activity from µEF is demonstrated by using a commercial recording system (see Table of Materials for hardware details), with a heating module incorporated. For performing recordings, we used a freely available software (see Table of Materials for software details).\nTurn on the MEA recording system and the temperature controller and allow the heated base plate of the preamplifier to reach 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: For long-term recordings (>30 min at a time) one should also have a system that maintains a CO2 atmosphere.\nPlace the µEF on the preamplifier (headstage).",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the MEA chip is correctly aligned with the reference number in the upper left edge. The MEA chip we use is rotationally symmetrical, but this alignment matches the correct orientation of the pin layout of the electrodes and the hardware IDs.\nClose and latch the preamplifier lid.\nTo record, open the recording software and define the recording parameters and the path of the recorded data streams (see the software manual for details on how to set-up a recording scheme).\n\tNOTE: An acquisition with a sampling rate of 20 kHz is generally enough for most applications. A higher sampling frequency is advisable if more precision is required in spike timings. If one intends only to record spikes, set a high-pass filter at 300 Hz, which will attenuate the lower frequency components of the signal. If raw and filtered data are recorded simultaneously, this will significantly increase the data file size. It is always possible to do offline filtering of the raw data. To reduce data file size one can also limit microelectrodes from which to record (e.g., only microelectrodes within microgrooves).\nClick Start DAQ to start data acquisition. Check if the display shows running traces of activity and start recording.\n\tNOTE: The noise level is usually slightly higher in the microelectrodes corresponding to the microgrooves. If the noise level is too high (peak-to-peak amplitude >50 µV) or unsteady in several microelectrodes, it could be due to dirt hindering a good pin-pad contact. This problem is usually solved by gently cleaning the MEA contact pads and the preamplifier pins using a cotton swab moistened with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the recorded file in the analysis software (see Table of Materials) to quickly explore the data.\n6. Data Analysis",
    "NOTE: The following steps show how to use the µSpikeHunter software, a computational tool developed at Aguiar's lab (freely available upon email request to pauloaguiar@ineb.up.pt), to analyze data recorded with µEF. A graphical user interface (Figure 2) is used to load the data, identify propagating spike waves, determine their direction (anterograde or retrograde) and estimate propagation velocities. µSpikeHunter is compatible with HDF5 files generated from recordings obtained using MEA2100-family systems, which can be used in conjunction with 60-, 120-, and 256-electrode MEAs. The recordings obtained using the multi-channel experimenter can be easily converted to HDF5 files using freely available software (see Table of Materials).\nClick Browse to select the recording file. Then, click the File Info button to list the sampling rate, the recording duration as well as a list of the recorded data streams (e.g., raw data, filtered data).\n\tNOTE: For true propagation velocity estimations, it is recommended to select the raw data stream for analysis.\nSelect microelectrodes (single row or column associated with microgroove) for analysis and set the spike detection threshold value (positive or negative phase) at 6x the standard deviation (SD) of the signal noise. Click Read Data to apply the event detector and obtain the identified propagation sequences.\n\tNOTE: If the criteria are met, a list of detected propagation sequences will populate the analysis panel. The user can then view and interact with several analysis tools for the propagation sequence, including voltage traces, inter-microelectrode cross-correlations, single-sequence propagation velocities, a kymograph, and an audio playback tool. Although the propagation velocity estimation can be obtained for any pair of microelectrodes or as the average of the estimates for all pairs, this estimation is more reliable if the farthest pair is selected.",
    "Repeat the previous step for the microelectrode sets of interest. Each time click Save All Events to save the time and amplitude of the spikes (on each of the microelectrodes) for all identified propagation sequences to a CSV file.\nImport the CSV files to data analysis environments for further analysis of the patterns of activity of the culture (e.g., firing rate, inter-spike intervals).\nSubscription Required.
