    "1. Cloning Strategy to Tag PlexinA1 Receptor with pHluorin\nChoose an appropriate expression vector as a backbone (e.g. the mouse receptor plexinA1 expressing vector, a kind gift of Dr. Andreas Puschel11).\n\tNote: This plexinA1 vector was engineered to achieve efficient HA- or VSV-tagged receptor insertion in the plasma membrane.\nAmplify by PCR the ecliptic pHluorin coding sequence using the adequate plasmid as a template (e.g. pHluorin-tagged GABA A receptor, a kind gift of Dr. Jacob2). If necessary, add a restriction site to the 5’ end of the primer in order to facilitate the cloning step in the backbone.\nInsert the pHluorin sequence in frame between the signal peptide and the receptor coding sequence using restriction sites (e.g. NruI/Kpn2I restriction sites as described in Figure 1B).\n\tNote: Because the signal peptide that ensures the correct targeting of the receptors is cleaved, the pHluorin should be placed after it. This warrants the recognition of the signal peptide and prevents cleavage of the pHluorin from the receptor of interest.\nSequence the constructs obtained to ensure that no mutation was introduced by PCR.\n2. Characterization of pHluorin-tagged Receptor In vitro in COS7 Cells\nThe ability of the fusion protein to reach the plasma membrane and its reversible loss of fluorescence as pH is lowered can be confirmed using the following procedure.\nDay 1. Plate 1.5 x 105 COS7 cells in a glass-bottom 35 mm dish in 2 ml of complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM - 10% Fetal Bovine Serum - 1 mM sodium pyruvate - 25 U/ml penicillin/stretomycin - 2.5 µg/ml Amphotericin B - pH 7.4).\nDay 2. Transfect cells:\n\tNote: Cells should be 70-80% confluent.\n\t\nPrepare 200 µl NaCl 150 mM and add 3 µg DNA i.e. the vector encoding pHluorin-tagged receptor. Gently vortex and spin down briefly.",
    "Note: A map of the pHluorin-plexinA1 vector used in these experiments is shown in Figure 1B.\nAdd 10 µl of transfection reagent (or the appropriate amount of the reagent used). Vortex immediately.\nIncubate 10 min at RT.\nAdd 200 µl of the transfection reagent/DNA mix to the cells.\nMove the plate gently to achieve repartition of the mix and place the cells back to the 37 °C incubator.\nDay 3. Remove transfection medium and replace it by 2 ml of fresh complete DMEM.\nDay 4. Perform live cell imaging of COS7 pHluorin-plexinA1 transfected cells:\n\t\nPrepare two aliquots of DMEM complete medium and adjust pH to 3.5 and to 9.5, respectively.\n\t\tNote: For one 35 mm plate, 1.5 ml of each solution is needed to perform the experiment.\nRemove cell medium and replace it by 1 ml of DMEM complete medium pH 7.4.\nPrepare a 5 ml syringe with an appropriate type of tubing in order to inject various components directly into the cell culture medium without opening the microscope chamber.\nUse a module that allows maintenance of a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humid working atmosphere.\n\t\tNote: An alternate approach to the use of a CO2 chamber is to use HEPES-buffered medium (usually in the range of 10-25 mM according to the cell type).\nPlace cells in the chamber and adjust the tubing and the syringe.\n\t\tNote: The microscope should be equilibrated before starting to avoid mechanical drift during the recording.\nOpen the imaging software and select the multidimensional acquisition program.\nFind transfected COS7 cells with the 40X objective and mark position in the software for each of them.\nConfigure Z stack in order to have a 15 µm depth acquisition (the focus can change when adding media in the plate).\nSet up exposure for the GFP filter and the Phase.",
    "Configure acquisition timing.\n\t\tNote: For the whole experiment with 5 fields of interest, acquisition every 20 sec for 10 min should be sufficient.\nStart acquisition and take 5 control images in DMEM pH 7.4 medium.\nPause acquisition, inject 1.25 ml of pH 3.5 complete DMEM to achieve a pH of 5.5 in the culture medium, mark event in the software and resume acquisition for 5 more time points.\n\t\tNote: Green fluorescence should progressively disappear.\nPause acquisition, inject 1.2 ml of pH 9.5 complete DMEM to achieve a pH 7.4 in the culture medium, mark event in the software and resume acquisition for 5 more time points.\n\t\tNote: Green fluorescence should reappear at the plasma membrane.\nAnalyze images.\nFigure 2 shows representative images obtained with such a protocol with the pHluorin-plexinA1 construct.\n3. In ovo Electroporation of pHluorin-plexinA1 Construct\nHandling of eggs before electroporation:\n\t\nStore fertilized eggs in a fridge at 14 °C up to one week prior to incubation.\nIncubate eggs at 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) in an incubator with saturated humidity for 50-52 hr until the embryos reach stage HH1412.\n\t\tNote: The eggs must be placed horizontally during incubation so that the embryo is properly positioned for electroporation, floating on the top of the yolk. HH14 stage is suitable to obtain expression of the plasmids in differentiated neurons in the spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglion with an appropriate survival rate.\nElectroporate embryos8-10:\n\t\nPrepare electroporation:\n\t\t\nPrepare endotoxin-free DNA plasmids with a concentration superior to 2 µg/µl, to be able to dilute it as the desired concentration.\nPull enough glass capillaries to inject the different DNA solutions.\nPrepare sterile PBS (-Ca2+; -Mg2+) - 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and equilibrate at 38.5 °C.\nSterilize the hood, curved scissors and fine forceps.\nControl the electrode spacing.",
    "Note: A 4 mm space between the electrodes is generally used.\nWindow the egg13 (Figure 3A):\n\t\t\nUse curved scissors to pierce the shell on the blunt side of the egg.\nRemove 2 ml of albumen using a 0.9 mm x 25 mm needle and a 5 ml syringe. Orient the needle vertically in order to avoid damaging the yolk sac.\nCover the top of the egg with tape to maintain the integrity of the shell.\nUsing curved scissors, pierce the shell in the middle of the tape to equalize the pressure when removing 2 ml of albumen from the egg. Then, cut a window large enough to visualize the embryo and be able to work on it.\nAdd ~2 ml sterile warm PBS (-Ca2+; -Mg2+) - 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin to avoid dehydration of the embryo and make it more accessible to the manipulator.\nInject DNA and electroporate the embryo\n\t\t\nDilute plasmid in PBS (-Ca2+; -Mg2+) to a concentration between 0.5-2 µg/µl and add Fast green dye to reach a final 0.025% concentration. Load the DNA mix in a capillary. The use of an injector is recommended.\n\t\t\tNote: Check that the capillary resistance is neither too large (meaning there could be difficulties when injecting embryos) nor too small (meaning that the capillary could be too big and could damage the embryo). Also, concentration of nucleic acids higher than 2 µg/µl may cause unspecific effects and needs to be controlled.\nPuncture the yolk-sac and the neural tube at the caudal side with the loaded capillary. Enter the neural tube with a shallow angle and fill the lumen from the tail to the head with the DNA mix (Figure 3B).\n\t\t\tNote: Fast green allows controlling the accuracy of the injection.",
    "Quickly place the 4 mm platinum electrodes on either side of the neural tube at the level you wish to electroporate and apply 3 pulses at 31 V for 50 msec with 500 msec intervals (Figure 3C).\n\t\t\tNote: Avoid placing the electrodes on the heart or on big extra embryonic vessels to avoid damaging the developing embryo. Bubbles should form on the electrodes.\nWith the needle, remove 2 ml of albumen to decrease the level in the shell.\nSeal the window and the blunt side hermetically with tape.\nPut the eggs back at 38.5 °C in the incubator until they reach the desired stage.\n4. Embryos Embedding and Cryosectioning\n48 hr after electroporation, carefully harvest electroporated embryos (HH24 stage). Cut the tape and half of the chorioallantoid membrane. To prevent embryos from sinking into the yolk, position a colander under the embryo and cut the second half of the chorioallantoid membrane.\nTransfer the embryo to a dissection dish filled with ice cold PBS.\nCheck electroporation efficiency by looking for fluorescence in the neural tube with a fluorescence stereo microscope.\n\tNote : Coelectroporation of a control plasmid encoding the RFP may help to visualize the electroporated area.\nDissect embryos using a microscalpel in order to select the electroporated area of the spinal cord.\nTransfer dissected embryos to a 24-well plate and fix in pH 7.4 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) - Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS), O/N at 4 °C.",
    "Note: Fixation step is crucial to allow the stabilization of pHluorin in its “live” conformation and thus to be able to use pHluorin in fixed/permeabilized tissue. Although fixation slows drastically pH-dependent change of fluorescence, one must take into account that conformational/protonation changes can still occur after fixation. Thus, the following protocol (embedding, cryosections and observation) has to be performed within 3 days after the fixation step, with all buffers at pH 7. If fixation is not required, performing observation on live tissue sections is recommended.\nRemove 4% PFA and wash embryos in pH 7.4 PBS.\nIncubate embryos in PBS-15% sucrose and keep at 4 °C until the embryos sink.\nIncubate fixed embryos in pH 7.4 7.5% gelatin- 15% sucrose for 45 min at 37 °C so embryos are completely embedded.\nPlace embedding molds on ice and add 400 µl of pH 7.4 7.5% gelatin- 15% sucrose to achieve a solid 2 mm base.\nAspirate the embedded embryo with a cut tip and place the embryo on the solid gelatin base.\nCover with pH 7.4 7.5% gelatin- 15% sucrose and position the embryo with forceps before the gelatin solidifies.\nOnce the gelatin is solid, prepare a -40 °C isopropanol bath (use dry ice or liquid nitrogen) and freeze the gelatin block for 5 min.\nKeep the frozen blocks at -80 °C.\nPlace the frozen block at -20 °C for 1 hr.\nRemove the mold and fix the block on a chuck with a polyethylene glycol medium.\nOnce the block is tightly fixed, place the chuck in the cryostat system.\n\tNote: Use coated slides to avoid tissue loss during staining.\nPerform serial cryosections (20 µm cryosections are usually performed).\nLet the cryosections dry for 15 min at RT.",
    "Note: cryosections should be protected from unnecessary light exposure in order to avoid bleaching of the GFP fluorescence.\n5. Microscopic Analysis of Cryosections\nRehydrate cryosections in pH 7.4 PBS at RT for 10 min.\n\tNote: If needed, nuclei can be stained with Hoechst.\nUse a 0.5 µg/ml Hoechst solution in PBS and incubate cryosections for 15 min.\nRinse the slides 3x with pH 7.4 PBS for 5 min.\nProceed to slide mounting. A pH 7.4 (or more basic) polyvinyl alcohol mounting solution that hardens O/N can be used: carefully position the coverslip to avoid the formation of air bubbles between the slide and the coverslip.\nLet the mounting medium harden O/N at 4 °C in the dark.\nUse an inverted confocal microscope to precisely visualize the pHluorin-plexinA1 fusion protein: perform z-stack at the optimal pinhole and optical resolution and use a 20X (NA 0.75) or 40X (NA 1.3) lenses.\n\tNote: pHluorin is detectable with the same parameters used to detect GFP (i.e. emission peak at 509 nm). Wavelength excitation and detection filter settings are optimally defined by the imaging software. Hoechst is detected between 425-460 nm (excitation is at 405 nm), GFP or pHluorin is detected between 485-545 nm (excitation is at 473 nm) and RFP is detected between 575-675 nm (excitation is at 559 nm).\nRepresentative images of pHluorin-plexinA1 and eGFP expression in the chick embryo spinal cord are shown in Figure 4.Subscription Required.
