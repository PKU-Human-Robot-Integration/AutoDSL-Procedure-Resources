    "Coating Petri dishes with fibronectin followed by formaldehyde fixationNote: All procedures below should be performed under a laminar flow hood. Add 1 ml of the 50 µg/ml fibronectin solution (see Recipes) to each of the 3.5-cm Petri dishes. Make sure the entire dish surface is completely covered by gently swirling the solution or redistributing it over the surface using pipette tip.Note: The fibronectin layer is only about 1-mm deep for the indicated volume, thus it is recommended to perform this operation with Petri dishes placed on a strictly horizontal surface to ensure even coverage of all areas of the dish.Incubate dishes with the lid on for 1.5 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator.Aspirate carefully and save the fibronectin solution.Note: The saved fibronectin solution can be re-used at least once. Store it at 4 °C and use within one week.Add 1 ml of 0.4% formaldehyde solution (see Recipes). Incubate dishes with the lid on for 20 min under a sterile laminar flow hood.Carefully aspirate the formaldehyde solution, wash twice with 2 ml of sterile PBS and then 4 times with 4 ml of sterile PBS.Note: Formaldehyde solution should be disposed of as a hazardous waste.Dry dishes for 1 h under the laminar flow hood.Note: Fibronectin-covered dishes can be sealed with Parafilm and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week before use. Coating Petri dishes with vitronectin followed by formaldehyde fixationNote: All procedures below should be performed under a laminar flow hood. Add 0.5 ml of the 10 µg/ml vitronectin solution (see Recipes) to each of the 3.5-cm Petri dishes. Make sure the entire dish surface is completely covered by gently swirling the solution or redistributing it over the surface using pipette tip.Note: The vitronectin layer is only about 0.",

Add 0.5 ml of the 50 µg/ml collagen IV solution (see Recipes) to each of 3.5-cm Petri dishes. Make sure the entire dish surface is completely covered by gently swirling the solution or redistributing it over the surface using pipette tip. Immediately transfer the dishes to the refrigerator.Incubate dishes with the lid on overnight at 4 °C.Note: The collagen layer is only about 0.5-mm deep for the indicated volume, thus it is important to perform this operation with Petri dishes placed on a strictly horizontal surface to ensure even coverage of all areas of the dish.",
