    "The experiment was approved by the Hakuoh University Ethics Committee, Japan.\n1. Experimental Setup\nNOTE: The experimental environment consists of an LCD monitor and a response button box connected to a computer (PC for experiments). Each participant decides whether a presented pair of figures is the ‘same’ or ‘different’ by pressing one of the two buttons on a response box. There are three buttons on the box labeled ‘Enter’, ‘F6’, and ‘F5’ from left to right. By pressing the Enter button, the current screen proceeds to the next screen. The F6 button is for responses using the index finger and the F5 button is for responses using the middle finger of the participant’s right hand. The generation of figure pairs is done on a different computer (PC for stimulus preparation). This setup enables the examination of various hypotheses that concern the criticality of a certain feature in the recognition of figures in a fairly objective manner.\nInsert a floppy disk into the floppy disk unit connected to the PC for stimulus preparation. Start the pair generation program on the PC for stimulus preparation.\nInput a random number, using the keyboard, as an initial value to the random number generation function used in the program. Input either 1 or 2 using the keyboard as a digital specifier.\n\tNOTE: Digital specifier = 1 designates the index finger to ‘same’ decisions and the middle finger to ‘different’ decisions (digital state 1) in the first block of trials and vice versa (digital state 2) in the second block. Digital specifier = 2 designates digital state 2 in the first block and digital state 1 in the second block. This procedure counterbalances the speed of response by different fingers.\n2. Instructions within the pair generation program",
    "Open a stimulus set file (PRBLM2.DAT) as a new file on the floppy disk unit. Additionally, open the database file of (6, 4) figures on the main unit.\nSequentially examine each record of the database file from record number 1 to 1,365 to determine whether the record that has the value of the variable 28 (i.e., number of intersections of line segments, see Figure 2) is 0.\n\tNOTE: For the total numbers of (6, n) figures, see Corollary 15.1 (a)1.\n\t\nIf the value is not-0, discard the record and go to the next record, else examine whether the value of variable 1 (i.e., isomorphic set) is either 2 or 5.\nIf the value is neither 2 nor 5, discard the record and go to the next record, else accumulate the record number as a candidate figure in an isomorphic 2 pool or an isomorphic 5 pool.\nExhaustively combine each record with other records, including itself, of candidate figures that belong to the isomorphic 2 pool.\nConvert each pair of record numbers into their line specification formats in all candidate pairs.\nExamine whether a figure is paired with itself, and if it is, classify the pair as an Idr pair with a tag that indicates its angular distance 0° and accumulate it in a pool of Idr pairs.\nElse, add an integer from 1 to 5 to each vertex label number in the line specification format of one figure with modulo 6 residues. If the value is 0, convert it to 6. Then, standardize the format. Then, compare the standardized format of the figure with the line specification format of the other figure in the pair.",
    "NOTE: A line specification format of a (6, 4) figure consists of four sequences of pairs of point labels. It is expressed in accordance with the left label that is always smaller than the right label inside a pair, and the left label of a previous pair that is always smaller than or equal to the left label of the following pairs.\nIf the two formats match with integer i, classify the pair as an Idr pair with a tag of its angular distance I (i.e., unit of 60° counterclockwise) and accumulate it in the pool of Idr pairs.\nElse, sequentially examine whether the pair is an Ax pair with one of the axes of symmetry being 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, or 150° counterclockwise from the rightward horizontal.\n\t\tNOTE: The Ax transformation of a figure about an axis of symmetry 0° permutes point labels 1 for 6, 2 for 5, 3 for 4, and vice versa; about 30°, 1 for 1, 2 for 6, 3 for 5, 4 for 4, and vice versa; about 60°, 1 for 2, 3 for 6, 4 for 5, and vice versa; about 90°, 1 for 3, 2 for 2, 4 for 6, 5 for 5, and vice versa; about 120°, 1 for 4, 2 for 3, 5 for 6, and vice versa; and about 150°, 1 for 5, 2 for 4, 3 for 3, 6 for 6, and vice versa (Figure 5).\nIf the line specification format of one figure after the Ax transformation about the axis of symmetry j° matches the format of the other figure in the pair, then classify the pair as an Ax pair with a tag of the axis of symmetry j° and accumulate it in a pool of Ax pairs.",
    "Else, classify the pair as an Nd pair. Then, calculate the numbers of incident lines at respective vertices in the line specification formats of the two figures of an Nd pair (Figure 6).\nIf the number of incident lines is one at either end of a line segment of a figure, determine the segment as an endline of a figure. Then, determine the three remaining line segments as those constituting a cycle (i.e., a triangle).\nCalculate the total line lengths of the cycles of two figures of an Nd pair. If the total lengths of the cycles between the two figures differ, discard the pairs.\nElse, calculate the difference between line lengths of the endlines between two figures. If the length difference is 0, classify the pair as an Nd pair with a tag of 0 and accumulate it in the pool of Nd pairs.\nElse, if the length difference is 0.27, classify the pair as an Nd with a tag of 0.27 and accumulate it in the pool of Nd pairs.\nElse, if the length difference is 0.73, classify the pair as an Nd pair with a tag of 0.73 and accumulate it in the pool of Nd pairs.\nElse, classify the pair as an Nd pair with a tag of 1 and accumulate it with a tag of 1 in the pool of Nd pairs.\nReiterate the protocol steps 2.2.3 to 2.2.16 for the candidate figures that belong to isomorphic set 5.\nClose the database file.\nPreparation of a stimulus set for a participant\nRandomly sample three pairs from the Idr pool, two pairs from the Nd pool, and a pair from the Ax pool with tags as practice pairs.",
    "Concatenate Idr, Nd, and Ax practice pairs and randomize their presentation order for the first block of practice trials.\nRandomly sample 80 pairs from the Idr pool, 40 pairs from the Nd pool, and 40 pairs from the Ax pool with tags as test pairs.\nConcatenate Idr, Nd, and Ax test pairs and randomize their presentation order for the first block of test trials.\nReiterate the protocol steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.4 for preparing practice and test trials in the second block of trials.\nWrite a presentation number, digital state, pair type with a tag, number of line segments, and four pairs of vertex labels in the line specification format of the left figure and right figure of each trial to the floppy disk unit sequentially, and simultaneously echo these values on the screen.\nReiterate step 2.3.6 from the first practice trial in the first block to the last test trials in the second block.\nClose the floppy disk unit.\n3. Instruction by an experimenter and execution of an experiment by a participant\nAsk each participant to provide written informed consent to participate in the experiment.\nInstructions by an experimenter\n\t\nInstruct each participant to decide whether a presented pair of figures is identical in shape regardless of their orientations (‘Same’) or not (‘Different’) as quickly and accurately as possible and show example figure pairs.\nSpecifications before the experiment by an experimenter\n\t\nStart the stimulus presentation program on the PC for experiments.\nClick Identity decision task on the menu screen.\nClick Participant's information, then input name, sex, and age, and then click End of specification on the information screen.\nClick Read Stimulus data on the menu screen, click PRBLM2.DAT file in the floppy disk drive, and click OPEN on the file specification screen.\nExecution of the experiment",
    "As an experimenter, seat a participant in front of the monitor and put his/her head on the chinrest and measure a distance 60 cm from the forehead to the monitor.\nAs an experimenter, start an experiment by clicking Execution on the menu screen.\nAs an experimenter, if the instruction screen shows the digital state 1, instruct a participant to press F6 key (response with the index finger) for ‘same’ decisions and to press F5 key (response with the middle finger) for ‘different’ decisions. If the instruction screen shows the digital state 2, instruct to press F6 for ‘different’ decisions and F5 for ‘same’ decisions.\nAs a participant, after fully memorizing the digital state of the block, press Enter on the response box.\nAs a participant, in response to the ‘Ready’ prompt on the screen, press Enter to start a trial.\nAs a participant, upon the presentation of a pair of practice pairs on the stimulus screen, press the F6 or F5 key as soon as a decision is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: The six vertices of an invisible regular hexagon are stylized as small filled circles with diameters of 0.4 cm whose centers are shifted 0.2 cm outward from the locations of the vertices on a stimulus screen. The six vertices of a (6, 4) figure are projected in a 6.6 cm x 7.6 cm rectangular area. Two figures of a pair are located at horizontally parallel positions with a between-centers distance of 9.4 cm.\n(Previously) set up the stimulus presentation program to display ‘The decision was erroneous’ on the feedback message screen with a beep in a practice trial if a response is an error. If a response is correct, display ‘The decision was correct’ on the screen.",
    "As a participant, when confirming a feedback message, press Enter to proceed to the next ‘prompt’ screen.\n(As the stimulus presentation program), reiterate the steps 3.4.4 to 3.4.7 by the end of practice trials in the block.\nWhen all practice trials are complete, display ‘Start of the test trials’ on the screen.\nReiterate the steps 3.4.4 to 3.4.5 at the end of test trials in a block.\n\t\tNOTE: The feedback messages are presented only during practice trials.\nReiterate steps 3.4.3 to 3.4.8 to execute the practice and test trials in the second block.\nAs the stimulus presentation program, save the data to a file on the floppy disk unit.\n\t\tNOTE: A participant’s data for each trial consists of a serial trial number, number of line segments, digital state, code of the pair type with a tag, code of the button pressed, correctness of a response, and latency in ms.\nSubscription Required.
