    "1. Media preparation\nPrepare 10 mL of control and excess AAAs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 50% D2O.\n\t\nFor the control media, measure and mix 10 mg of DMEM powder with 4.7 mL of double distilled water (ddH2O) in a 15 mL conical tube. The DMEM powder contains all the amino acids at standard concentrations. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed. Add 4.7 mL of D2O, 0.5 mL of fetal bovine serum (5% FBS), and 0.1 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (1%). Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed.\nFor the 15x Phe treatment medium, measure and mix 10 mg of DMEM powder with 4.7 mL of ddH2O, 0.5 mL of FBS (5%), and 0.1 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (1%) in a 15 mL conical tube. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed. Add excess Phe powder at a concentration of 924 mg/L to the medium. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed.\nFor the 15x Tryp treatment medium, measure and mix 10 mg of DMEM powder with 4.7 mL of ddH2O, 0.5 mL of FBS (5%), and 0.1 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (1%) in a 15 mL conical tube. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed. Add excess Tryp powder at a concentration of 224 mg/L to the medium. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube to ensure the solution is well mixed.\nAdd methionine and threonine at 30.0 mg/mL and 95.0 mg/mL, respectively, to all conical tubes of the previous steps. Thoroughly vortex and invert the tube. Sodium pyruvate is not required to be added to the culture media.",
    "Filter the control and treatment media with a 25 mm syringe filter with 0.22 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters.\nSeal all the media-contained conical tubes with parafilm and store at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks.Prior to treating the cells with media, warm all the media to 37°C.\n\t\t​NOTE: The powder and liquid reagents should be measured and combined based on the total volume of treatment and control media.\n2. Cell sample preparation\nMaintain cervical cancer (HeLa) cells in a culture flask (i.e., T10, T25, etc.) using standard DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2).\nSub-culture the HeLa cells at a split ratio of 1:10 until reaching 80% or higher cell viability.\nOnce the cells achieve 80% or higher confluency, proceed to seed 2 x 105 cells per well onto a 24-well plate using DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\t\nPrior to cell seeding, prepare a 24-well plate with sterilized, poly-d-lysin, laminin-coated, round coverslips, 12 mm in diameter. Submerge the coverslips in 70% ethanol and dry gently using lint-free wipes. Place the clean coverslips in the appropriate wells of the plate.\nOnce the cells reach 80% confluency in step 2.2, wash the cells once with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without magnesium and calcium ions.\nAdd 0.25% trypsin to dissociate the adherent cells from the flask and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 min.\nAdd DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, gently pipette up and down, and collect the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g at room temperature (RT) for 3 min.\nResuspend the cells in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer, light microscope, and trypan blue, and seed a density of 2 x 105 cells per well of a 24-well plate. Alternatively, an automated cell counter can be used to count the cells.\nReturn the cells to the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and gently shake the plate to distribute the cells evenly.\nAfter 8 h, replace the old culture media with 50% D2O/excess Phe or 50% D2O/excess Tryp media. Return the cells to the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 36 h.\nAfter 36 h, fix the cells on microscope slides.\n\t\nPrior to fixing, prepare microscope slides with imaging spacers 9 mm in diameter and place 15 µL of 1x PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium ions.\nRinse the cells with 1x PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium ions.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and leave the plate under the biosafety hood for approximately 15 min.\nAspirate the PFA solution and rinse with 1x PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium ions twice.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 1x PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium ions in each well.\nUse sterile tweezers to gently grab the coverslips out of each well. Invert and place the cell-containing side of the coverslips onto the imaging spacers to contact the PBS prepared in step 2.5.1. Ensure that the non cell-containing side is exposed to air.\nUsing transparent nail polish, seal the outer layer of the coverslip with the imaging spacer.\nStore the microscope slides at 4 °C when not imaging.\n3. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy measurement (Figure 2)\nUse a confocal Raman microscope to obtain spontaneous Raman spectra (Figure 2A).\nTurn on the laser by turning the key to the ON position.",
    "Double-click on the LabSpec6 software icon to open the acquisition software.\nLoad the biological sample onto the sample holder directly underneath the objective lens.\nOn the software, click the Camera icon to turn on the video camera.\nAdjust the focus plane to identify a region of interest with the 50x objective lens. Move the joystick to control the planer translation of the XY stage and rotate the joystick to change the depth of focus.\nAfter choosing the position for measurement, switch to the 100x objective lens with 40 mW of excitation power. Click the red Stop icon to turn off the video camera.\nSelect a grating of 1800 lines/mm, and set the acquisition range from 400 cm-1 to 3,150 cm-1.\nSet the Acquisition Time to 90 s, the Accumulation to 3, and the Binning to 4 for the least noise and most accurate spectrum.\n\tNOTE: These imaging parameters can be optimized to fit the experiment.\nClick the Arrow icon to turn on the real-time display.\nTune the Raman shift (cm-1) to a value of choice to fine-tune the focus plane.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, the Raman laser was focused onto the lipid droplets, which contained a high concentration of CH2 bonds. Therefore, a Raman shift of 2,850 cm-1 that matched the stretching modes of the CH2 bond was selected for the purpose.\nAdjust the focus plane with the joystick to optimize the best signal-to-noise ratio.\nAfter choosing the focus plane, click the red Stop icon for a real-time display.\nSelect the Circle icon to start the spectrum acquisition.\nOnce the cellular region is taken, use the same focus plane to measure the background with PBS. Subtract the background spectrum from each subcellular target spectrum using a separate computer software application, such as Origin (Figure 1B).",
    "4. Imaging experiments with 2PEF and SRS\nNOTE: Detailed descriptions of SRS laser alignment can be found in a prior report28. This protocol focuses on the operation of a multimodal SRS and 2PEF imaging system (Figure 2C, D).\nClick on Start to warm up the laser.\nFollow the order to set the main switches of the control unit and the monitor on: 1) press the main switch of the control box IX3-CBH to On, 2) press the main switch of the touch panel controller to On, 3) press the main switch of the AC adapter of the power supply for LD OBIS 6 Laser Remote connected to the main laser combiner FV31-SCOMB to On, and 4) press the main switch of the AC adapter of the power supply for LD OBIS 6 Laser Remote connected to the sub laser combiner FV31-SCOMB to On.\nPress the main switches of the Si photodiode detector and lock-in amplifier On.\nSet the Stokes Beam at 1,031 nm, Pulse Width at 6 ps, and Repetition Rate at 80 MHz.\nCoupled into the microscope, set the picoEmerald system supplied with the synchronized pump beam with a Tunable Wavelength from 720-990 nm, a Pulse Width of 5-6 ps, and a Repetition Rate of 80 MHz. The average excitation power of both the pump and Stokes is 450 mW. Optimize the excitation power to minimize photodamage for the sample.\nUse a high-numerical aperture (NA) oil condenser (i.e., 1.4 NA) to collect the Stokes and pump beams where the sample is mounted by emitting a few drops on the condenser.\nMount the sample on the oil and place a large water droplet on top of the microscope slide where the sample is fixed. This is for the water-immersion objective lens.",
    "Set the lock-in amplifier to 20 MHz. Process the image now using the super-resolution software module.\nSelect 512 pixels x 512 pixels and 80 µs/pixel for the dwell time.\nOnce the desired cellular region is focused properly, acquire the image. Using the acquisition software of the microscope, save the images as an Olympus .oir graphic file.\nAcquire a background image at 1,900 cm-1 and subtract it from all cellular images.\nTo perform 2PEF imaging, use the same tunable picosecond laser, and set the label-free autofluorescence of Flavin and NADH to 800 nm and 780 nm, respectively.\nUse a 460 nm/515 nm filter cube to collect the Flavin and NADH autofluorescence backscattered emission.\nAdjust the dwell time to 8 µs/pixel and the pixel size to 512 pixels x 512 pixels. Set the laser shutter power parameter to 150 mW.\nFor 3D image reconstruction, tune the stimulated Raman loss to 2,850 cm-1 (797 nm).\nOnce the desired single cells have been identified, register the laser to scan from the top focus plane to detect the top and bottom layers of those cells.\n\t​NOTE: 3D models are generated and saved as .oir files.\n5. Spectra and image analysis\nSpectra analysis\n\t\nUse the Origin software or other relevant applications to subtract the background spectrum from all subcellular target spectra.\nUse MATLAB's mathematical modeling operations to process the Raman spectra with the software's built-in functions. Python can also be used for spectra processing.\n\t\t\nSpectral pre-processing begins with converting the files into an array. The spectra are interpolated at every reciprocal centimeter.",
    "For validation, graph the raw data. Perform the baseline correction on the raw spectra using the built-in function msbackadj in MATLAB. In brief, the built-in function estimates baseline points at separation-unit values identified by users and returns the distance between adjacent windows. From the baseline points, estimate and draw a regression line. Apply Smoothing to smooth the regression line to subtract the baseline from each individual raw spectrum.\nPerform min-max normalization by dividing the Raman intensity of the protein at 2,930 cm-1 by the intensity of each Raman shift. The 2,930 cm-1 signal is typically the highest intensity on the Raman spectrum. With this normalization, the maximum value gets transformed into a 1 while the minimum value gets transformed into a 0. Every other value gets transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1.\nAverage the individual spectra of the same condition into a single spectrum to reduce noise.\nOnce processed, use applications, such as Origin, to display all the spectra simultaneously. The peaks displayed in the spectra represent a specific chemical bond or functional group.\n3D image analysis of lipid droplets\n\t\nUse FIJI-ImageJ software to process all 3D images\nPerform the functions Bandpass Filters and Smoothing for the 3D image stacks.\nFor 3D image analysis, assign each lipid droplet to a spherical score calculated by measuring the distance between its center of mass to the surface. Compare each spherical score with a spherical score of a perfect sphere on the same Euclidean plan. Discard lipid droplets with low spherical scores and evaluate the remaining lipid droplets for their volume and counts.\nAnalyze the volume and counts of lipid droplets between different treatments for statistical significance on an appropriate statistical software application. Here, GraphPad Prism was used.\n2D hyperspectral image analysis",
    "Use FIJI-ImageJ software to process all the 2D hyperspectral images.\nSelect the 2,930 cm-1 channel to make a mask image that contains 0 and 1 values. Assign the background to 0 and the cellular region to 1.\nSubtract the deuterium-labeled protein channel (2,175 cm-1) to the background channel (1,900 cm-1) to remove the fluorescent effects.\nDivide the resulting deuterium-labeled protein channel by the protein channel (2,930 cm-1) to obtain protein turnover rate ratiometric images.\nThen, multiply the mask image made in step 5.3.2 by the ratiometric images to remove any remaining background noises. As a result, a dark background is generated in each ratiometric image.\nUse the Freehand Selection tool in FIJI-ImageJ to manually segment and calculate pixel intensities displayed on single cells. The pixel intensities correspond to the concentrations of the chemical bond that is being visualized.\nAnalyze the pixel intensities for statistical significance on an appropriate statistical software application. Here, GraphPad Prism was used. Repeat this analysis with the remaining ratiometric analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
