In our case, the plasmid expressing β-globin nonstop protein which is CAT-tailed by NEMF is co-transfected with the vectors expressing NEMF (Udagawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Two 500 cm2 plate cultures are used per sample. This culturing scale usually gives us approximately 100–200 ng of the RNA at the end of the purification which is sufficient for the detection of the tRNAs in the NEMF-60S RNC by RT-qPCR. Depending on the experiment, you may change the choice of tag attached to the protein of your interest. If you use the cells expressing tagged proteins or an antibody against the endogenous protein for immunoprecipitation, you may omit this step.\nFor each 500 cm2 plate, prepare the plasmid solution as below.\nAdd 150 μg of pcDNA-V5-TEV-NEMF wild type, the D96A mutant or the V5-NEMF wild type without a TEV protease recognition motif in a 50 mL tube.\nAdd 50 μg of p5FBG-Nonstop per tube.\nAdd 7 mL of Opti-MEM per tube and mix gently by pipetting.\nFor each 500 cm2 plate, prepare the PEI-Max solution as below.\nAdd 600 μL of PEI-Max transfection reagent in a 50 mL tube.\nAdd 7 mL or Opti-MEM per tube and mix gently by pipetting.\nStand at 20°C–24°C for 5 min.\nAfter the incubation of PEI-Max solution for 5 min, mix the plasmid solution and the PEI-Max solution by pipetting and stand at 20°C–24°C for 20 min.\nAdd the transfection complex prepared above to the cell cultures on 500 cm2 plates.",
    "Replace the medium with 75 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS 4 h after adding the transfection complex, and incubate for 24 h.\nNote: All plasmids should be prepared using the transfection-grade plasmid purification kit such as Nucleobond Xtra Midi (Takara) and stored at the concentration of 1 mg/mL at –20°C.\nPreparation of the anti-V5-Protein G Dynabeads\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe anti-V5-Protein G Dynabeads for the immunoprecipitation should be prepared prior to the cell lysis or during sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The protocol below is for two samples (experimental sample and control sample), two 500 cm2 cell cultures per sample.\nTransfer 300 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (75 μL per 500 cm2 plate) in a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic rack, let it stand for a minute, and discard the supernatant by pipetting.\nTake the tube away from a magnetic rack (BioRad, or its equivalent) and add 600 μL of Lysis buffer and 60 μL of anti-V5 antibody (15 μL per plate).\nRotate at 10 rpm at 4°C for 1 h.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic rack, let it stand for a minute, and discard the supernatant by pipetting.\nTake the tube away from a magnetic rack and wash the beads with 600 μL of Lysis buffer, twice\nAdd 250 μL of Lysis buffer and keep it on ice.\nPreparation of sucrose gradients\nTiming: 15 min\nPrior to the cell lysis, 10%–35% sucrose gradients for the fractionation of 60S ribosomal complexes should be prepared. We use Gradient Master (Biocomp) for making sucrose gradients. This machine allows us to make a variety of density gradients in a convenient and reproducible manner. However, a traditional hand-made method for making gradients can be used alternatively.\nPrepare one 10%–35% linear sucrose gradient per sample in open-top polyclear tubes (Seton).",
    "Mark a line on the side of the open-top polyclear tubes for SW28 using Marker Block (Biocomp).\nPlace the tubes on a tube holder (Biocomp).\nPour 10% sucrose until the marked line.\nLayer 35% sucrose from the bottom of the tube using a syringe.\nCap the tubes with Long caps for SW28 tubes (Biocomp).\nPlace the tubes on a tube rack on Gradient Master (Biocomp).\nRun a program for 10%–35% linear sucrose gradient.\nAfter the run program, the gradients on a tube holder are placed at 4°C until use.\nNote: The gradients can be kept at 4°C for several hours, but we recommend making them just before starting cell lysis.\nCell lysis\nTiming: 1 h\nBefore cell lysis, the cells may be treated with a drug such as cycloheximide in order to ‘freeze’ the ribosome complex. The cell lysis should be done on ice as quickly and carefully as possible to avoid the dissociation of the complexes and the degradation of proteins and RNAs.\nDecant the medium, pour 30 mL of prewarmed D-PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide per plate, put the plate back to the 5% CO2 incubator for 10 min.\nDecant the D-PBS, place the plate on ice, and add 15 mL of ice-cold D-PBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL cycloheximide.\nScrape the cells and transfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL tube.\nRepeat for all plates and collect the cells from same genotype in a same 50 mL tube.\nSpin down the cells at 5000 g for 1 min and aspirate the PBS carefully.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of Lysis buffer per sample (two 500 cm2 plates) supplemented with protease inhibitors, RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), and cycloheximide, transfer the lysate into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube per sample, and keep them on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 20000 g for 10 min at 4°C and collect the supernatant in a new 2 mL tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and collect the supernatant in a new 1.5 mL tube.\nKeep 20 μL of the lysate as input, add 280 μL of ddH2O and 300 μL of acidic phenol (pH 4.2), vortex vigorously, and keep on ice until RNA extraction step below.\nNote: When replacing the medium with D-PBS, just decant the medium and directly, but carefully, pour the D-PBS in a 50 mL tube to the plate. Do not use an aspirator and a pipettor, as it takes too much time and the cells can be stressed. When scraping the cells, use a scraper of appropriate size, which significantly shorten the time required for collecting the cells. We usually use a large plastic dough scraper for cooking (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for an example). The scraper should be kept on ice before use.\nSucrose density gradient fractionation of the 60S ribosome complexes\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step significantly enhances the specificity of the tRNA detection in the NEMF-60S RNC, possibly because NEMF is predominantly localized to the 60S ribosomes (Udagawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Besides, large amount of free tRNAs which are not bound to the ribosomes can be eliminated by this fractionation, and thus reduces non-specific detection of free tRNAs bound to the immunoprecipitation beads. However, depending on the experiment, you may omit this step and directly proceed to the immunoprecipitation.",
    "Layer the lysate from two 500 cm2 plates per sample on top of the 10%–35% sucrose gradient.\nCentrifuge at 27000 g for 2.5 h at 4°C with a SW28 rotor with maximum acceleration and deceleration.\nAfter the centrifugation, the sucrose gradients are fractionated by Piston Gradient Fractionator (Biocomp) according to the manufacture’s instruction.\nPool the 60S ribosome fractions and transfer to a 15 mL tube per sample (about 3 mL per sample).\nCritical: All lysate (normally approximately 1 mL), after keeping the input samples aside, should be loaded to the gradient. The sample tubes must be balanced before proceeding with centrifugation. If the amount of lysate between the samples varies by more than 100 μL, adjust the balance by carefully removing that amount of sucrose solution from the top of the gradient.\nNote: Other gradient fractionators can be used. However, we do not recommend correcting the 60S fractions manually using a syringe to avoid the contamination of other fractions.\nCritical: We use a UV detector to monitor the ribosomal fractions and correct the 60S ribosomal fractions, the third peak from the top, not to contaminate 40S, the second peak after the first highest peak, and 80S ribosomal fractions, the fourth peak which often overlaps with 60S ribosomal fractions. Since the 60S and 80S ribosomal fractions overlap, we do not include the boundary fraction between the third and fourth peaks.\nImmunoprecipitation of the NEMF-60S RNC\nTiming: 3 h",
    "The NEMF-60S RNC is purified by the immunoprecipitation of the V5-TEV-NEMF using anti-V5 antibody from the 60S ribosome fraction prepared above. The immunoprecipitated complexes are eluted by digesting V5-TEV-NEMF with AcTEV protease (Thermo) or the equivalent (Matsuo et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Udagawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). When this protocol is used for other purpose, you may use other tag or an antibody against endogenous protein of your interest. However, it is important that you elute the complexes from the beads at the end of this step, in order to detect the bound tRNAs specifically in the complexes. RNA extraction directly from the beads will increase non-specific detections of tRNAs.\nAdd 125 μL of the anti-V5-Protein G Dynabeads prepared above to the 60S fraction in a 15 mL tube per sample\nRotate the tubes at 10 rpm for 1 h at 4°C.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic rack, let it stand for a minute, and discard the supernatant carefully by pipetting.\nTake the tubes away from a magnetic rack, wash the beads with 700 μL of Lysis buffer supplemented with RNasin RNase inhibitor per sample by gentle pipetting, and transfer the beads into a new 1.5 mL tube per sample.\nSimilarly, wash the beads with 700 μL of Lysis buffer supplemented with RNasin RNase inhibitor three more times.\nWash the beads with 700 μL of Buffer TEV once.\nElute the NEMF-60S RNC by digesting V5-TEV-NEMF with 70 units of AcTEV protease (Thermo) or the equivalent in 300 μL of Buffer TEV per sample.\nRotate the tubes at 10 rpm for 2 h at 4°C.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic rack and collect the eluate in a new 1.5 mL tube per sample.",
    "Note: At the end of this step, you have the NEMF-60S RNC ready for RNA/protein analysis. For the first time of the experiments, you may confirm the purity of the complex by western blotting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). When performing western blotting, the eluted proteins may be concentrated by TCA precipitation.\nCritical: To avoid non-specific binding, the incubation period of the beads with the 60S fraction should not be longer than 1 h.\nPause Point: The eluted complexes can be stored at –20°C only after the addition of an equal volume of acidic phenol (pH 4.2) for RNA analysis and ice-cold 20% TCA for protein analysis.\nRNA extraction\nTiming: 2 h\nIn order to detect the tRNAs in the NEMF-60S RNC, RNA extraction is carried out by acidic phenol method. You may also use commercially available RNA purification kit such as TRIzol (Thermo) with Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo research). Input RNA prepared at step 9 of ‘Cell lysis’ above should be processed together with the eluted samples.\nAdd equal volume (300 μL) of acidic phenol (pH 4.2) to the eluted complexes above, vortex rigorously, centrifuge at 15000 g for 10 min at 4°C together with the input sample.\nCollect approximately 280 μL of the aqueous phase, add 300 μL of chloroform, vortex rigorously, centrifuge at 15000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect approximately 250 μL of the aqueous phase, add 0.5 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen, 30 μL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 750 μL of ethanol in order, mix well after each addition, vortex rigorously after adding ethanol, keep the tubes at –80°C for 1 h.",
    "Centrifuge at 15000 g for 10 min at 4°C, carefully aspirate the supernatant, add 1 mL of 75% ethanol to the pellet without vortexing, and centrifuge again at 15000 g for 10 min.\nAir dry and resuspend the pellet in 20 μL of ddH2O for the eluted sample and 200 μL for the input sample.\nQuantify the RNAs by Nanodrop.\nNote: Nuclease-free water, for example one from Ambion, instead of ddH2O might be used from this step and after.\nNote: With this scale of the purification, we usually obtain 200 μL of the input RNAs at the concentration of 200–250 ng/μL and 20 μL of the eluted RNAs at the concentration of 5–10 ng/μL. The concentration of the eluted RNA is the nearly lower limit of Nanodrop quantification, but is sufficient for tRNA detection by RT-qPCR below. The quantification can be performed more accurately by fluorescent-based methods or Bioanalyzer (Agilent), if needed.\nPause Point: The RNA samples can be stored at –80°C after the addition of 100% ethanol (step 3) or 75% ethanol (step 4). The resuspended RNAs can also be stored at –80°C for weeks.\nRT-qPCR for tRNAs\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Finally, measure the level of each tRNA in the NEMF-60S RNC by RT-qPCR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The protocol described below uses conventional RT-qPCR enzymes with custom primers for each human tRNA and we were able to detect most tRNA species by this protocol. tRNA sequences were obtained from GtRNAdb (Chan and Lowe, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). All primer pairs are designed to amplify the anticodon stem-loop, with the 3′ end of both forward and reverse primers positioned within the anticodon loop. We chose this region because of the relatively high sequence variation among tRNA species. However, note that we could not obtain specific amplification for some tRNA species, including tRNAiMet, although we have not tested all possible primer sequences. With the RNAs prepared above, you can examine up to 40 different tRNA species.\nDilute and denature the input and the eluted RNA samples.\nDilute 20 μL of the eluted RNA and 2 μL of the input RNA with ddH2O up to 100 μL.\nHeat at 75°C for 10 min and immediately chill on ice\nNote: Although the RNAs are denatured prior to the reverse transcription reactions below, this additional denaturing step often enhances the qPCR amplification of tRNAs, probably because it helps denature tRNA secondary structure and improves accessibility of the reverse transcriptase.\nPerform reverse transcription reactions as below.\nMix 2.5 μL of the diluted RNA with 2 μL of 10 μM reverse primer for each tRNA in a PCR tube, keep at 65°C for 5 min in a PCR machine and immediately chill on ice.\nPrepare the reaction mixtures containing 3 μL of 5× ReverTra Ace RT buffer (TOYOBO), 3 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.375 μL of RNasin RNase inhibitor, 0.375 μL of ReverTra Ace Reverse Transcriptase (TOYOBO), 3.75 μL of ddH2O per sample for the number of samples.",
    "Add 10.5 μL of the reaction mixture to the denatured RNA/primer mixture and start the reaction at 55°C for 30 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 4°C forever on a PCR machine.\nPause Point: Although not recommended, the cDNAs prepared above can be stored at 4°C for a week. Longer storage can affect the qPCR result.\nPerform qPCR reactions as below using KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR kit (Nippon Genetics) and BioRad CFX Connect system (BioRad) or the equivalent.\nPrepare the reaction mixtures for each tRNA containing 7.5 μL of 2× KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR mixture, 0.3 μL of 10 μM forward and reverse primers, and 4.9 μL of ddH2O per sample for the number of samples.\nAdd 2 μL of the cDNA for the number of tRNAs to be tested in a 96 well qPCR plate.\nMix 13 μL of the reaction mixture with the cDNA in the 96 well plate, place the plate in a qPCR machine (BioRad), and start the preinstalled 2 step protocol with a melt curve step below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/736-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: We recommend to perform qPCR reactions with technical replicates for each primer sets. At least three biological replicates are needed for proper quantification."
