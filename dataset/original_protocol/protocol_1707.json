    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nYeast protein extract\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step outlines how the yeast protein samples are extracted under denaturing conditions, which will maintain the palmitoylation status of the proteins.\nFirst, 600 μL of yeast lysis buffer is added to the yeast pellet, and 100 μL of 0.5 mm glass beads is added.\nThe yeast cells are broken by shaking with a high-throughput tissue grinder (shaking at 60 Hz for 60 s, then a 5 min interval on ice to keep cold, 6 rounds in total).\nCentrifuge at 5000 g for 5 min at 4°C and collect the supernatant in a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nQuantify the protein concentrations of the supernatant via a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit from Sigma. An expected typical concentration is 5 mg/mL.\nOne milligram of protein supernatant is placed into each 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. For each sample prepare, three centrifuge tubes are prepared.\nThe supernatant is placed in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and diluted with lysis buffer to reach a 600 μL total volume.\nTriton X-100 (6 μL 100% Triton X-100 into 600 μL volume of cell lysates) and final 25 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) are added to the samples.\nIncubate the protein samples at 4°C for 30 min with gentle full-angle rotation.\nOne of the two tubes of each sample is retained at –80°C for back up and another tube is subject to precipitation with chloroform-methanol (see the next step).\nPause point: The collected yeast samples can be stored at –80°C for 2 weeks.\nChloroform–methanol (CM) precipitation and NEM block of samples\nTiming: 7 h\nIn this step, a chloroform-methanol (CM) precipitation assay is used to remove the residual buffer in the protein samples.",
    "One milligram of protein, diluted with LB buffer (with PI) to a final volume of 1 mL, is transferred into larger polypropylene centrifuge tubes (at least 10 mL).\nA 4-fold volume (4 mL) of methanol is added to the tubes and vortexed thoroughly to mix the solution.\nA 1.5-fold volume (1.5 mL, use a glass pipette) of chloroform is added to the tubes and vortexed thoroughly to mix the solution.\nA 3-fold volume (3 mL) of distilled H2O is added to the tubes and vortexed thoroughly to mix the solution.\nPlace the tubes at 4°C for 20 min. Centrifuge (12,000×g, 10 min, and 4°C) to separate the phases. The samples will be separated into two phases, with protein precipitated at the interphase (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Discard the top phase (H2O and methanol) carefully using Pasteur pipettes. Add 3 mL methanol followed by gentle up and down mixing to maintain the protein interface. Centrifuge (3,000×g, 10 min, and 4°C) so that protein precipitates can be pelleted to the tube bottom. Discard the supernatant with a Pasteur pipette (remove all of the supernatant).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1294-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pictorial depiction of precipitated proteins in the interphase\nYeast cell lysates were precipitated by sequential adding of methanol, chloroform and H2O. After centrifuge, the proteins were separated in the interphase.\nThe precipitated proteins are resolubilized in 200 μL SB buffer and incubated at 37°C for enhanced dissolution.\nDilute with 800 μL LB buffer with 10 mM NEM and PI, incubate at 25°C for 1–2 h or 16 h at 4°C.",
    "Precipitate the protein by repeating the CM assay three times to remove the NEM: add a 4-fold volume (4 mL) of methanol to the tubes, and vortex thoroughly to mix the solution. A 1.5-fold volume (1.5 mL, use a glass pipette) of chloroform is added to the tubes and vortexed thoroughly to mix the solution. A 3-fold volume (3 mL) of distilled H2O is added to the tubes and vortexed thoroughly to mix the solution. Centrifuge (12,000×g, 10 min, and 4°C) to separate the phases. The samples will be separated into two phases, with the protein precipitated at the interphase. Discard the top phase (H2O and methanol) carefully using Pasteur pipettes. Add 3 mL methanol again followed by gentle up and down mixing to maintain the protein interface. Centrifuge (3,000×g, 10 min, and 4°C) so that the protein precipitates can be pelleted to the tube bottom. Discard the supernatant with a Pasteur pipette (remove all of the supernatant).\nThe protein is air dried, dissolved in 450 μL SB buffer, and incubated at 37°C for 20–30 min.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: Any methanol and chloroform remaining in the samples will make it difficult to redissolve the protein precipitates. The protein layer in the interphase should not be disrupted.\nPause point: The dried protein samples can be stored at –80°C for 1 week.\nNote: Any remaining NEM will reduce the acyl-biotin exchange reaction to a large extent. When the cysteine sites released by hydroxylamine are exposed, thiols would be modified by the residual NEM, which results in blocking of the subsequent reaction with the biotin reagent. To ensure that the NEM is removed cleanly, this CM precipitation assay may need to be repeated more than three times.\nAcyl-biotin exchange reactions",
    "In this step, the palmitoyl conjugated on cysteine will be removed and then replaced by biotin, which will generate affinity tag for followed recognition and precipitation.\nTiming: 2 h\nThe protein samples are divided into two equal aliquots, retaining 50 μL as input for western blotting.\nTroubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOne aliquot (200 μL) is mixed with 800 μL of With-HA (with hydroxylamine) buffer, and the other is mixed with 800 μL of Without-HA (without hydroxylamine) buffer. Both aliquots are incubated in the individual buffer for 1–2 h at 25°C by mixing gently.\nChloroform and methanol assays are used again to precipitate the proteins as described above in steps 4–5.\nThe protein precipitates obtained by the CM assay are dissolved in 100 μL TB buffer, incubated at 37°C for 10 min and diluted with 900 μL LB buffer.\nTroubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTo remove the unreacted biotin, the CM assay is used again to precipitate the protein, which can be precipitated three times continuously if any concern about the unreacted biotin being present is raised.\nNote: Any unreacted biotin will interfere with and compete with the streptavidin-agarose in the following steps.\nImmunoprecipitation with streptavidin-agarose\nIn this step, the biotin-cysteine integrated proteins will be recognized and captured by Streptavidin-Agarose.\nTiming: 2 h\nThirty microliters of streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the samples and incubated at 4°C for 1–2 h.\nThe beads were washed with washing buffer 5 times to remove any nonspecifically bound proteins.\nAdd 60–80 μL Elution buffer and then boil the beads for 5 min as pulldown samples. Load 10 μL of the input samples and Pulldown samples into SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels followed by western blotting with the anti-HA antibody.\nTroubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]"
