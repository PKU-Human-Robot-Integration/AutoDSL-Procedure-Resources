    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExogenous DNA stimulation\nTiming: 6 h\nISD transfection:\nReplace culture medium with 1 mL FBS-free DMEM 1 h before transfection.\n1 μg/dish ISD was diluted in 300 μL FBS-free DMEM medium, and 2 μL PEI (ISD/PEI for 1:2) was added in another 300 μL FBS-free DMEM medium. Keep two mixtures at 25°C for 5 min.\nMix them with pipette, and leave the reaction at 25°C for 20 min. ISD or plasmid/PEI 600 μL mixture was used to replace DMEM medium in dishes, cells were cultured for 4 h at 37°C.\nThe DNA mixture was replaced with 1 mL complete DMEM medium and cultured at 37°C.\nCritical: The PEI/DNA ratio is important for high transfection efficiency. Too much (above 3:1) PEI is cytotoxic.\nCritical: Replacing the medium or DNA/PEI mixture should be done quickly, to avoid cells getting dry.\nAlternatives: PEI was used for plasmid transfection. Elyra 7 Lattice SIM and Operetta High-Content Screen system were used to detect subcellular distribution of fluorescence signal. An equivalent transfection method (such as lipo2000 or lipo3000) and imaging system can be used (such as Leica STELLARIS 5).The nucleus and cytoplasm fractionation assay can also be performed using Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells sold by Thermofisher (Cat# 78840).\nVACV stimulation\nInactivated VACV (MOI=1) was added to HeLa cells with complete DMEM medium, and incubated for 4 h at 37°C in an incubator.\nDetection of the subcellular localization of cGAS in exogenous DNA stimulation\nTiming: 1 day for step 3\nTiming: 1 day for step 4\nTiming: 1 day for step 5\nDetection of cGAS subcellular localization by Immunofluorescence microscopy\nSeed cells in cell culture dish (ϕ20 mm) at approximately 30% confluency (1.5×10 5) post transfection or stimulation 18–20 h.",
    "After 4 h stimulation with 1 μg ISD or inactivated VACV (MOI=1) as described above, discard culture medium, wash cells with sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1 mL/dish), fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (in 1× PBS)for 10 min at 25°C.\nDiscard PFA, add 1 mL permeabilization buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 at 25°C for 10 min.\nCritical: Be precise on the time of permeabilization to avoid cell lysis.\nIncubate cells in blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at 25°C, shake gently to best block non-specific protein-protein interaction.\nCritical: Time of blocking should not be too long (above 2 h) at 25°C. Place the plate at 4°C if blocking is more than 2 h.\nDilute the anti-cGAS antibody in 1 mL blocking buffer in a 1:1000 dilution. Incubate cells with this primary antibody for 2 h at 25°C or more than 12 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Dilution of primary antibody needs to be optimized based on the source of the antibodies.\nDiscard antibody solution, and wash cells 5 min/time for three times with PBST buffer on a horizontal rotator.\nDilute secondary antibody (conjugated Alexa Fluor (488)) with PBS (1:1000), incubate 1 mL diluted secondary antibody with cells for 1 h in dark at 25°C.\nCritical: For secondary antibody incubation, keep samples in dark until the experiment is over to avoid fluorescence quenching.\nDiscard antibody solution, wash cells once with 1 mL PBST for 5 min on horizontal rotator.\nDilute DAPI in PBS at 5 μg/mL and incubate 1 mL/well with cells in dark for 10 min at 25°C.\nCritical: Incubate time of DAPI should not exceed 15 min, to avoid high background fluorescence.\nWash cells with PBST twice with 5 min each time on a horizontal rotator.",
    "Store the stained cells in 1 mL PBS at 4°C until examination with confocal microscope. Storage time should not exceed 48 h\nConfocal images were acquired at 25°Cusing Elyra 7 Lattice SIM (ZEISS) mounted on an inverted microscope with an oil immersion 63×/numerical aperture 1.4 objective lens.\nDetermine cGAS localization in different sub-cellular compartments. Six different microscopic fields were counted by eye respectively. Cell counts were normalized in term of percentage. Graph was showed mean±SEM (n=3 independent experiments) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1C ).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/769-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(D) The Operetta High-Content Screen system was used to calculate the ratios of fluorescence signals between the nucleus and cytoplasm for cGAS and its mutant NES6A. The results are summarized in the bar graphs (n=3 independent experiments).\n(E) Subcellular localization of cGAS and its mutant NES6A were examined by nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction experiment 24 h after transfection. P values of statistical significance are represented as ∗∗P <0.01,∗P<0.05. These data are from the original Figures 3B–3F in (Sun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])\nCritical: Avoid cell death in all the steps, which results in high fluorescence background.\nAlternatives: cGAS subcellular distribution can also be evaluated using Fiji, a popular open source software.\nDetection of cGAS subcellular localization by Operetta high-content screen (Dull et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nCell preparation Seed HeLa cells at 10,000 per well in a CellCarrier-96 plate (6005550, PerkinElmer). 20 h later, 20 ng/well ISD was transfected or inactivated VACV (MOI=1) was added for a 4-h stimulation.\nCritical: Before plating cells into CellCarrier-96 plates, make sure to trypsinize cells thoroughly to obtain single cell suspension.\nAfter exogenous DNA stimulation, fix cells with 100 μL/well 4% PFA with PBS at 25°C for 15 min.\nPermeabilize cells by 100 μL/well 0.3% Triton-X100 for 15 min at 25°C.\nBlocking cells with 100 μL/well 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at25°C on a horizontal rotator.\nIncubate cells with 50 μL/well anti-cGAS antibody diluted in 5% BSA/PBS (1:1000) on a horizontal rotator for 1 h at 25°C\nWash the cells with 100 μL/well PBST for 5 min, and repeat 3 times.\nIncubate cells with 50 μL/well goat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody at 1:1000 (in PBS) dilution for 1 h at 25°C on horizontal rotator.\nWash cells with 1×PBST for 5 min on horizontal rotator.",
    "Stain nuclei by DAPI (5 μg/mL) for 10 min in dark at 25°C.\nWash cells twice with 1× PBST 5 min/time on a horizontal rotator, store cells in 100 μL/well PBS.\nPlates were then scanned, and images were collected using the Operetta HTS imaging system (PerkinElmer) at 20 × magnification with 10 scattered fields of view.\nCritical: Because of uneven temperature and CO2 concentrations among wells in the same plate, try to avoid using the wells on each edge of the CellCarrier-96 plate.\nData analysis\nImages were analyzed with harmony software from Perkin Elmer. Nuclear areas were defined by DAPI staining, and GFP/cGAS intensity was measured in the defined region of interest. The cytoplasmic region of interest (ROI) for GFP/cGAS fluorescence was measured by a dilation from the nuclear boundary, and only thresholded GFP/cGAS was quantitated in the cytoplasmic region. The background fluorescence value was measured in no GFP/cGAS expression cells, and then setup 3 times of background mean fluorescence intensity as positive signal threshold fluorescence value. The nuclear/ (nuclear+cytoplasmic) ratios were calculated ( Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1D).\nDetection of cGAS subcellular localization by Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation (Rosner et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])\nTwo wells of stimulated cells in a 6-well plate (about 1×106 cells/well) were needed for fractionation as 1 sample.\n1 μg/well ISD was transfected with PEI(DNA/PEI=1:2)as described above.\nAfter stimulation, cells were washed with 1 mL sterile PBS, and trypsinized with 200 μL/well 2.5% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37°C.\n200 μL/well complete medium was used to neutralize trypsin. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS by centrifugation for 2 min, at 200×g and 4°C. Discard supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL cold sterile PBS, transfer one-third of the volume (about 330 μL) to a new 1.5 mL tube, and save this as samples of whole cells.\nCritical: Single cell suspension is critical to ensure data quality in the next steps.\nCentrifuge the whole cell sample (WCE) at 200×g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant. Add 80 μL ice-cold RIPA buffer to lyse the cells for subsequent immunoblotting (C+N).\nPellet the rest two-third cells at 200 ×g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and keep the tube on ice.\nAdd 5 pellet volume (about 250 μL) extraction buffer A to resuspend the cell pellet to single-cell solution with 1 mL tips and confirmed by microscopy.\nCritical: A sufficient volume (3–10 pellet volume) of extraction buffer A is important for isolation. Too small (less than 3 pellet volume) a volume is insufficient to break cytomembranes. Too much (more than 10 pellet volume) a volume will dilute the cytoplasmic protein concentration.\nKeep the lysed cell samples at 25°C for 2 min, then transfer them to ice rapidly for another 10 min incubation.\nAdd 10% NP40 (about 25 μL) to cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 1% NP40, and mix gently with 200 μL tips.\nCritical: Make sure to gently mix the cells to avoid breaking the nuclear envelope.\nCritical: Keep a consistent number of mixing aspirations between samples.\nPerform a low-speed centrifugation for 3 min at 500×g at 4°C to separate the cytoplasmic and nuclear components.\nSave 30% supernatant carefully to a new 1.5 mL tube as the cytoplasmic component (C), discard the supernatant and keep the pellet on ice.",
    "The pellet contains low-purity nuclei. Wash the pellet with 300 μL extraction buffer A which contains 1% NP40 at 500×g for 3 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, gently resuspend the pellet with another 300 μL extraction buffer A containing 1% NP40.\nRepeat step m and n 3 times.\nResuspend the nuclei pellet with 80 μL extraction buffer B and vortex the sample vigorously for 20 s.\nRepeatedly snap freeze-and-thaw samples two times in liquid nitrogen and incubate it on ice for 20 min.\nSoluble nuclear proteins were separated by high-speed centrifugation at 20000×g at 4°C for 20 min. Discard pellets and collect the supernatant (N).\nWestern blotting (Wang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) was carried out to analyze expression of the corresponding protein in the whole cell lysate (WCE) (in RIPA buffer), cytoplasmic (C), and nuclear (N) fractions with 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Load the same amounts of samples, run the gels at 120 V constant voltage for 20 min in running buffer, followed by 160 V for 40 min. Transfer proteins onto NC membrane at 80 V for 120 min in the transfer buffer. Tubulin and Lamin were detected as marker proteins to indicate the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNuclear export signal (NES) prediction and verification\nTiming: 2 h for step 6\nTiming: 1 week for step 7\nTiming: 1 week for step 8\nTiming: 5 days for transformation of the ligated mix into DH5α competent cells, plasmid DNA preparation, and sequencing to confirm the correct clones\nPrediction of cGAS NES\nThe human cGAS protein sequence was download from the database UniProtKB: Q8N884 (http://www.uniprot.org/[href=http://www.uniprot.org/]), and then the amino acid sequence was submitted to the LocNES ( http://prodata.swmed.edu/LocNES[href=http://prodata.swmed.edu/LocNES]). The software predicted a putative NES located at amino acid positions 169 to 174.",
    "Determine the nuclear export function of the putative cGAS NES\nClassical NLS (nuclear localization signal) of the SV40 large T antigen sequence (PKKKRKV) was fused to the N-terminus of EGFP to restrain EGFP expression in the nucleus. Then, the putative cGAS NES sequence was inserted to the N-terminus of SV40NLS-EGFP (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nVector construction details\nDigest 1 μg of pEGFP-N1 plasmid with EcoRI and BamH1 for 1.5 h at 37°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_769_9.csv\nGel purify digested pEGFP-N1 uisng Axygen Gel Extraction Kit.\nAnneal and phosphorylate each pair of oligos.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_769_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_769_11.csv\nThe annealing and phosphorylation reaction with the following thermocycler program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_769_12.csv\nDilute annealed and phosphorylated oligos at a 1:200 dilution with ddH2O.\nLigation reaction\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_769_13.csv\nIncubate at 16°C for 12 h.\nTransformation into DH5α bacteria, plasmid DNA preparation, sequencing to confirm the correct clones.\nPlasmids were transfected into HeLa cells with PEI.
