    "Treatment of elicitor and preparation of extracellular metabolites of N. benthamiana leavesTreat leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana with 150 nM INF1 elicitor solution by injecting the solution into the intracellular spaces of the abaxial sides of the leaves using a needleless syringe (Figure 1A). Apply gentle pressure during infiltration, in order to avoid damaging the leaf tissue. Inject the solution at 5-10 locations to ensure sufficient coverage of the leaf. Incubate for 9 h at 23 °C under light. Cut off treated leaves from the plant (Figure 1B) and measure the weight of each leaf using an electronic scale (generally, approx. 1 g for leaf of middle-sized).Note: Process Steps A2 to A4 one leaf at a time. Put each leaf into a 50 ml tube (Figure 1C). Avoid rupture of the central vein.Washing step: Add approx. 50 ml cyclohexane into each tube. Shake gently for approx. 30 sec at RT (Figure 1D) and then pour the cyclohexane into a 200 ml round-bottom flask (or a fresh 50 ml tube for storage in the freezer) to collect cyclohexane-soluble metabolites on the leaf surface. Freeze and keep the leaf tissue in the same 50 ml tube to extract intracellular (intra-tissue) metabolites later (see steps in Procedure B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719205216_1876.jpgFigure 1.

D. Add approx. 50 ml cyclohexane and shake gently for approx. 30 sec.Note: Time for shaking can be longer (e.g., a couple of minutes) but it is important to fix the time for all samples.",
    "Test leakage of chlorophyll into cyclohexane to make sure that there was no major damage to leaf cells by cyclohexane. See Shibata et al., 2016 for details.Evaporate the cyclohexane obtained in Step A4 using a rotary evaporator (at approx. 40 °C in a water bath). To collect the metabolites dried at the bottom of the round-bottom flask, wash the bottom twice with 1 ml of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) by pipetting and collect the solution (total 2 ml) into a 2 ml tube. Note: Let the flask cool down to room temperature before adding solvent.Evaporate the solvent in the 2 ml tube using a centrifugal concentrator (This step usually takes about 1 h).Re-dissolve the precipitate in 100 µl acetonitrile, mix thoroughly and add 50 µl ddH2O.Shake the 2 ml tubes well using a microtube mixer for 5 min.Sonicate the samples by floating the tubes in a sonicator bath for 5 min.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature and collect the supernatant.Note: Carefully collect 120 µl supernatant to avoid contamination with precipitates.Analyze the metabolite by HPLC. See Procedure C.Preparation of intracellular (intra-tissue) metabolites of N. benthamiana leavesGrind leaves of N. benthamiana from Step A4 in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, and suspend in 50% methanol (1 ml/300 mg leaf tissue). Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature and collect the supernatant.Add the same volume of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, vol/vol) and vortex.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and collect the upper phase (ethyl acetate layer). Evaporate solvent using a centrifugal concentrator. (This step usually takes ~1 h).Re-dissolve precipitate in 100 µl acetonitrile and add 50 μl ddH2O.Shake 2 ml well using microtube mixer for 5 min.",

See Procedure C.High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysisSamples from Procedure A and B are subjected to HPLC analysis under the following conditions. Note: Other conditions may be used though this will influence the elution times of the products.Column: ODS column (e.g., Develosil ODS-UG-3, Nomura Chemical, Japan).Solvent: 50% acetonitrile (0 to 3 min), linear increase from 50% to 80% acetonitrile (3 to 13 min), and from 80% to 100% acetonitrile (13 to 14 min).Injection volume: 5 µl. Flow rate: 1.0 ml/min. Detection at 205 nm. Capsidiol and capsidiol 3-acetate elute at 4.6 and 12.8 min, respectively (see Figure 2). Use peak areas for quantitative analysis.Note: For the method of capsidiol 3-acetate purification, see Matsukawa et al. (2013).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180719/20180719205749_5641.jpgFigure 2. Elution profile of extracellular metabolites of TRV-infected or Nb-ABCG1/2-silenced N. benthamiana. Leaves of TRV-infected (A) or NbABCG1/2-silenced plants (B) were treated with 150 nM INF1. Elution profiles of washing fluids were analyzed by HPLC (detection at 205 nm)."
