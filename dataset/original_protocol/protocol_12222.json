    "1. Circulating Hemocyte Concentration\nTo obtain larvae of roughly the same developmental stage for this assay, restrict egg collection by allowing females to lay eggs for a fixed time period of 2 - 6 hr.\nCollect larvae in dissecting dish wells filled with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Table 1).\nFor each larva, place 10 µl 1x PBS in a microcentrifuge tube on ice and 10 µl 1x PBS on a clean dissecting pad. Place the dissecting pad on an illuminated stereomicroscope base.\nDry an individual larva by placing it on a tissue wipe before transferring it to a PBS drop on the dissection pad.\nUsing a pair of forceps, gently tear open and carefully invert the cuticle to release the hemolymph.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to scrape or jab the cuticle as this could potentially release sessile hemocytes29.\nUsing a pipet, collect the hemolymph from the dissecting pad. Avoid collecting larval debris such as the fat body.\nAdd the hemolymph to a microcentrifuge tube and mix by pipetting up and down.\n\tNOTE: Several samples can be collected at once and kept on ice for up to an hour.\nOptional: Mix Trypan blue with the hemolymph sample in equal parts to dye and exclude dead cells. Count cells within 3 min of adding Trypan blue because it is toxic to cells.\nMix the sample by pipetting up and down before loading 10 µl into a hemocytometer chamber.",
    "If using an automated cell counter, set appropriate parameters for cell size and circularity. For example, set a minimum cell size of 2 µm, a maximum cell size of 22 µm, and a circularity of 75 - 80% roundness to detect normal, round hemocytes34. Experiment with different parameters to detect larger and spindle-shaped hemocytes, such as lamellocytes. Alternatively, use a hemocytometer to manually count hemocytes.\n2. Circulating Hemocyte Immunohistochemistry\nTo obtain larvae of roughly the same developmental stage for this assay, restrict egg collection by allowing females to lay eggs for a fixed time period of 2 - 6 hr.\nPlace one coverslip in each well of a 6- or 12-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Square coverslips (22 mm) fit in 6-well plates and round coverslips (18 mm diameter) fit in 12-well plates.\nCollect larvae in dissecting dish wells filled with 1x PBS.\nPlace 5 µl 1x PBS in the center of each coverslip.\nPlace the plate on an illuminated stereomicroscope base.\nDry an individual larva on a tissue wipe and then place in the PBS on the coverslip.\nUsing a pair of forceps, gently tear and carefully invert the cuticle. Before removing the larval carcass, use it to spread the hemolymph evenly.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to scrape or jab the cuticle as this could potentially release sessile hemocytes29.\nRepeat for all larvae, collecting the hemolymph of one larva per coverslip. Allow hemocytes to adhere to the coverslips for 5 - 8 min at room temperature RT. Do not exceed 30 min before fixation.\nFix hemocytes by adding 5 µl of 7.5% formaldehyde (Table 1) to each coverslip for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash coverslips three times with 1x PBS. Tip the plate and aspirate PBS after each wash. To prevent run-off of the permeabilization solution in the next step, use the aspirator to remove excess PBS from perimeter of the coverslips.\nAdd 100 µl permeabilization solution (Table 1) to each coverslip for 20 min at RT.\nTip and gently tap the plate to aspirate the permeabilization solution.\nDilute primary antibody with antibody solution (Table 1) according to provider's specifications. Add at least 500 µl primary antibody solution to coverslips in 12-well plates. Add at least 1.5 ml in 6-well plates. Incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nRemove the primary antibody solution and wash coverslips with 1x PBS for 10 min on an orbital shaker, three times.\nDilute secondary antibody with antibody solution according to provider's specifications. Add at least 500 µl secondary antibody solution to coverslips in 12-well plates. Add at least 1.5 ml for 6-well plates. Incubate for at least 2 hr at RT.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and wash coverslips with 1x PBS for 10 min on an orbital shaker as in Step 2.10, three times.\nDuring the wash steps, clean glass microscope slides with 70% ethanol (Table 1) using tissue wipes. For each coverslip, place 5 µl mounting buffer (Table 1) on the glass slide.\n\tNOTE: Two coverslips fit on one slide.\nAspirate the final PBS wash.\nUse forceps to carefully remove the coverslips from the plates and place, inverted, on top of the mounting buffer.\n\tNote: Microscope slides can be stored at 4 °C prior to imaging. Maximum storage time depends on the stability of the antibodies used. 6- and 12-well plates can be rinsed and reused.\n3. In Vivo Crystal Cell Melanization",
    "To obtain larvae of roughly the same developmental stage for this assay, restrict egg collection by allowing females to lay eggs for a fixed time period of 2-6 hours.\nBefore beginning, set a heating source at 60 °C.\n\tNOTE: A thermal cycler program of 60 °C for 10 min (followed by a 25 °C hold) works best, but a water bath or other heating source is sufficient as long as the heat is distributed consistently and evenly over each larva.\nCollect larvae in dissecting dish wells filled with 1x PBS (Table 1).\nOne at a time, dry a larva on a tissue wipe and place at the bottom of a PCR tube. Place each larva in a separate PCR tube. (See Figure 3A.)\nFor consistent results, ensure that larvae stay at the bottom of the PCR tubes by chilling larvae in the tubes at 4 °C for 10 - 15 min and/or gently tapping the tubes prior to heating.\nPlace the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler (or water bath). Heat at 60 °C for 10 min.\nCarefully remove larvae from the PCR tubes into dissecting dish wells filled with fresh 1x PBS.\nDry larvae on a tissue wipe and arrange on a flat surface for imaging under a stereomicroscope.\nScore images of larvae blindly by multiple individuals.\n4. Larval Lymph Gland Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: The lymph gland is located approximately one-third length from the anterior end of a larva slightly below the brain on the dorsal side. (See arrow in Figure 3B.) The lymph gland flanks the dorsal vessel and is most easily dissected attached to the mouth hooks or to the brain. Wild-type, third instar lymph glands are very small structures; the primary lobes are approximately 100 - 200 µm in length. (See Figure 4A.)",
    "To obtain larvae of roughly the same developmental stage for this assay, restrict egg collection by allowing females to lay eggs for a fixed time period of 2 - 6 hr.\nLymph gland dissection\n\t\nFor each experimental condition, add 1 ml 1x PBS (Table 1) to one well of a 24-well plate.\nAdd 1 drop of 0.1% PBST (Table 1) to each well using a disposable transfer pipet.\n\t\tNOTE: Detergent, such as Tween 20, is added to lower the surface tension, allowing the tissue to sink to the bottom of the well.\nPlace the plate flat on ice.\nCollect larvae in dissecting dish wells filled with 1x PBS.\nPlace a clean dissecting pad on an illuminated stereomicroscope base. Use a disposable transfer pipet to place small drops of 0.01% PBST (Table 1) on the pad. Transfer one larva to a PBST drop for dissection.\nHold the larva with one pair of forceps approximately one-quarter length from the posterior end, dorsal side up.\nUse another pair of forceps to grab the cuticle immediately anterior to the forceps that are holding the larva. Gently pull the cuticle toward the anterior end until the mouth hooks are exposed.\n\t\tNOTE: The aim is to peel the cuticle without disturbing any internal structures.\nRelease the cuticle and use both forceps to cut the larva in two. Remove the posterior end from the PBST drop.",
    "NOTE: If the cuticle does not peel all the way to the mouth hooks, cut the larva in two and remove the posterior end. Use one pair of forceps to hold the edge of the cuticle, and use the other pair of forceps to push the mouth hooks through the opening. This will invert the cuticle and expose the mouth hooks. This can be used as an alternate dissection method as well.\nUse one pair of forceps to pin down the cuticle (either the ventral cuticle, the dorsal cuticle flap, or both) for stability.\nUse another pair of forceps to grab the exposed mouth hooks and gently pull them out.\n\t\tNOTE: This will separate the cuticle from the internal structures. Ideally, the eye/antennal imaginal discs, brain, ring gland, and lymph gland flanking the dorsal vessel will remain attached to the mouth hooks.\nWhile still holding the mouth hooks, carefully remove unwanted structures such as the salivary glands, fat body, and intestine.\n\t\tNOTE: If the brain separates from the mouth hooks, the lymph gland might still be attached to and collected with the brain. In this case, hold the ventral nerve cord instead of the mouth hooks.\nUsing the mouth hooks or ventral nerve cord as a handle, transfer the dissected complex containing the lymph gland to the well on ice. Do not exceed 30 min before fixation.\nFixation and immunohistochemistry\n\t\nPlace the 24-well plate on the stereomicroscope base.\nUse a p200 pipette to carefully remove the PBST from the well.\n\t\tNOTE: Empty, neighboring wells are useful to temporarily deposit waste.\nGently add 200 µl 3.7% formaldehyde (Table 1) down the side of the well and swirl the plate to ensure that the dissected tissues are completely submerged.",
    "Return the plate to ice for 30 min. If the lymph glands express fluorescent protein(s), keep the plate covered to prevent photobleaching.\nUse a p200 pipette to carefully remove the fixative.\nWash by adding 200 µl 1x PBS to the well and placing the plate on an orbital shaker for 5 min at room temperature. Use a p200 pipette to carefully remove the PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixed lymph glands can be left on ice in PBS until lymph glands for all experimental conditions are dissected and fixed.\nRepeat the wash steps two more times.\nAdd 200 µl permeabilization solution (Table 1) to the well. Set the plate on an orbital shaker for 45 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: 45 min is the \"gold standard\" for lymph gland permeabilization but the authors have success after only 20 min.\nRemove the solution with a p200 pipette.\nDilute primary antibody with antibody solution (Table 1) according to provider's specifications. Add 300 µl primary antibody solution to the well and ensure that the dissected tissues are completely submerged. Incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nUse a p200 pipette to remove the primary antibody.\nWash by adding 200 µl 1x PBS to the well and placing the plate on an orbital shaker for 10 min at room temperature. Use a p200 pipette to carefully remove the PBS.\nRepeat the wash steps two more times.\nDilute secondary antibody with antibody solution according to provider's specifications. Add 300 µl secondary antibody solution to the well and ensure that the dissected tissues are completely submerged. Incubate on an orbital shaker for at least 2 hr at RT.\nUse a p200 pipette to remove the secondary antibody and wash as described in Steps 4.3.12 & 4.3.13. Do not remove the PBS after the final wash.\nLymph gland mounting",
    "Clean glass microscope slides using 70% ethanol (Table 1) and tissue wipes.\nFor each experimental condition, place one drop of mounting buffer (Table 1) on the glass slide.\n\t\tNOTE: Two conditions fit on one slide. Mounting buffer volume depends on the number of lymph glands to be mounted. Use 2 µl for approximately 18 - 20 lymph glands, 1 µl for 10 - 12, and 0.5 µl for 5 or less.\nPlace the microscope slide on an illuminated stereomicroscope base.\nFor up to two conditions at a time, transfer all of the lymph glands from the well to the mounting buffer with forceps, using the mouth hooks or ventral nerve cord as a handle.\nSpace the dissected tissues evenly in a circular or rectangular shape, spreading the mounting buffer in the process.\nFor each of the dissected tissues, individually, slide one tong of the forceps under the dorsal vessel and gently pull toward the periphery of the mounting buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: This will draw the lymph gland out from the rest of the dissected tissues and flatten the lymph gland on the glass.\nUsing one tong of the forceps and a sawing motion, cut the dorsal vessel between the lymph gland and the brain.\nMove the rest of the dissected tissues to the opposite side of the lymph gland, at the outermost edge of the buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The unwanted dissected tissues will eventually form a perimeter around the lymph glands and serve as a support upon which the coverslip will rest.\nRepeat until all of the lymph glands are separated from the dissected tissues, reserving one of the unwanted dissected tissues to place in the center.",
    "Take a coverslip between two fingers. Check that the coverslip is free of dust and fingerprints. If necessary, use a tissue wipe and 70% ethanol to clean the coverslip.\nEnsuring that the edge of the coverslip is parallel to the edge of the glass slide, carefully lower the coverslip over the mounting buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Microscope slides can be stored at 4 °C prior to imaging. Maximum storage time depends on the stability of the antibodies used. 24-well plates can be rinsed and reused.\n5. Imaging\nImage fixed hemocytes and mounted lymph glands on an appropriate standard fluorescence or confocal microscope at 20X or higher magnification according to manufacturer's operating manual. Image whole larvae on a standard stereomicroscope at 2X magnification according to manufacturer's operating manual.\nFollow software provider's instructions for deconvolution, if desired.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nSolution,Composition,Storage,Comments\n1x PBS,200 mg/L potassium chloride,room temperature,\n1x PBS,200 mg/L potassium phosphate monobasic,room temperature,\n1x PBS,\"8,000 mg/L sodium chloride\",room temperature,\n1x PBS,\"1,150 mg/L sodium phosphate dibasic\",room temperature,\n1x PBS,dH2O,room temperature,\nFixative,3.7% or 7.5% formaldehyde in 1x PBS,room temperature in the dark,Formaldehyde is toxic.\nPermeabilization solution/antibody diluent,0.4% Triton,4 °C,The standard formula uses 0.4% Triton but the authors use 0.1% Tween 20 with success.
