    "1. General Considerations\nSee the Table of Materials/Equipment for a list of necessary reagents. Perform all steps under strict aseptic conditions.\nUse heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (hiFBS) for all media preparations that include FBS. To heat-inactivate, warm a 50 ml aliquot of FBS at 56 °C for 30 min, inverting every 10 min (see also Table 1).\n\tNote: When FBS is used without heat-inactivation, the epithelial-like phenotype progresses more quickly throughout cultures of SH-SY5Y cells.\nPrior to use, allow media to warm and equilibrate in an incubator to establish a proper pH balance before every step. For example, 50 ml of media takes approximately one hour to fully equilibrate (pH 7, 37 °C, 5% CO2).\n\tNote: This protocol uses a two-step splitting procedure that requires partially differentiated SH-SY5Y cells to be trypsinized and re-plated. This is a stressful process for these exceptionally fragile cells. Therefore, it is important to incubate the cells in trypsin for a minimal amount of time. This will allow for the preferential lift-off of neurons, leaving epithelial-like cells still attached to the dish.\nPerform trituration of differentiated cells slowly with a 10 ml plastic pipet with the tip against the bottom of the conical tube containing the cells. Perform trituration at a slow speed, up and down no more than five times.\n2. Passage of SH-SY5Y Maintenance Cultures\nSplit maintenance cultures when cells have reached 70-80% confluency, and do not exceed 10 to 15 passages. Cultures typically need to be passaged every 3-5 days (assuming cultures are not diluted more than 5-fold during splitting).\nTo passage cells from a T-75 flask, aspirate off media, then rinse with approximately 10 ml 1x PBS.",
    "Note: We do not recommend splitting the SH-SY5Y maintenance cultures further than 1:5 during passaging because this can cause the cells to die due to low confluency.\nAspirate PBS, and then add 2.5 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (1x).\nIncubate in incubator 2-3 min and tip gently to release cells from the surface of the flask.\nAdd 10 ml Basic Growth Media (see Table 2) and triturate 1-2 times.\nSpin down for 2 min at 1,000 x g, aspirate media, then resuspend pellet in 5 ml Basic Growth Media.\nDilute cells from 1:3 to 1:5 in a total volume of 20 ml for normal plating in T-75 flask, or count and plate for differentiation (section 5).\n3. Freezing SH-SY5Y Cells\nFreeze early passages of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in Basic Growth Media supplemented with 5% (v/v) DMSO.\nInitially, freeze aliquots at -80 °C for 24 hr, then transfer to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n\tNote: For reference, a confluent (75-85%) T-75 flask will yield five 1 ml aliquots of SH-SY5Y cells for freezing. Each of these aliquots should contain anywhere from 2-5 million cells total.\n4. Thaw and Culture Undifferentiated SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells\nPrepare Basic Growth Media.\nRapidly thaw frozen cells in a 37 °C water bath (approximately 2 min).\nResuspend cells in 9 ml Basic Growth Media in a 15 ml conical tube, and then centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant while being careful not to disturb the pelleted cells, and gently resuspend cells in 10 ml Basic Growth Media.\nPlate cells onto a T-25 flask or 60 mm2 dish.\nThe next day, replace media to remove dead cells.\n5. Day 0: Plating Cells for Differentiation\nSee Figure 1 for the differentiation schedule.",
    "Rinse undifferentiated cells with 1x PBS, aspirate, and then trypsinize using 1-2 ml warmed 1x 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nWhen cells are in trypsin, incubate for approximately 3 min in an incubator.\nQuench the trypsin by adding 10 ml Basic Growth Media, rinse the sides of the flask or dish, and gently triturate 1-3 times. Transfer contents to a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g, and aspirate the media while being careful not to disturb the pellet.\nResuspend pellet in 5 ml Basic Growth Media and triturate 1-3 times.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer, then dilute using Basic Growth Media to 50,000 cells/ml.\nPlate 2 ml of cells per 35 mm2 dish for a total of 100,000 cells per dish and place back into incubator.\n6. Day 1: Change Media (Differentiation Media #1)\nAliquot 50 ml of Differentiation Media #1 (see Table 2)and incubate in a 37 °C water bath.\nWhen media is warmed, allow it to equilibrate in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for at least one hr to establish a proper pH balance prior to use.\nAdd Retinoic Acid (RA) (see Table 1) to warmed and equilibrated media immediately before adding media to dishes.\n\tNote: Retinoic acid is light sensitive and should be stored in dark bottles at 4 °C\nGently aspirate off old media and discard.\nAdd 2 ml Differentiation Media #1 with RA per 35 mm2 dish and return to incubator.\n7. Day 3: Change Media (Differentiation Media #1)\nRepeat Section 6 (steps 1-5)\n8. Day 5: Change Media (Differentiation Media #1)\nRepeat Section 6 (steps 1-5)\n9. Day 7: Split Cells 1:1\nAdd RA to warmed and equilibrated Differentiation Media #1 immediately before adding media to dishes.\nGently aspirate off old media and discard.",
    "Add 200 µl warmed 0.05% 1x Trypsin EDTA per 35 mm2 dish and warm in incubator approximately 2-3 min or until cells are visibly lifted from the plate as observed under a microscope.\nQuench the trypsin by adding 2 ml Differentiation Media #1 with RA per 35 mm2 dish and use the media to rinse remaining neuronal cells off the plate. Then transfer contents to a 50 ml conical tube.\n\tNote: During trypsinization steps, do not trypsinize too many dishes at once. This helps to ensure neuronal cultures are not incubated in trypsin for too long, which can be cytotoxic.\nCombine contents from up to 10 dishes in the 50 ml conical tube and gently triturate slowly up and down no more than five times with a 10 ml plastic pipet.\nAliquot 2 ml cell suspension into fresh 35 mm2 dishes and return to incubator.\n10. Day 8: Change Media (Differentiation Media #2)\nAdd RA (see Table 1) to warmed and equilibrated media immediately before adding media to dishes.\nGently aspirate off old media and discard.\nSlowly add 2 mL Differentiation Media #2 (see Table 2) with RA per 35 mm2 dish and return to incubator. Do not allow neurons to be exposed to air for an extended period of time as they can dry out quickly.\n11. Day 9: Prepare Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Coated Dishes\nThaw one vial of ECM solution on ice and dilute 1:100 into cold DMEM.\nDispense 2 ml of mixture into each 35 mm2 dish and ensure the entire base of the dish is covered.\nPlace in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 hr or overnight.\nAspirate mixture and allow to air dry for approximately 1 hr in a hood. Store at room temperature for up to 2 months.",
    "12. Day 10: Transfer Cells onto ECM Coated Plates 1:1\nAdd RA (see Table 1) to warmed and equilibrated media immediately before adding media to dishes.\nGently aspirate off media and discard.\nAdd 200 µl warmed trypsin to each 35 mm2 dish and allow to incubate at room temperature for approximately 1-2 min or until neurons are visibly lifted from the dish as observed under a microscope.\n\tNote: Execute this trypsinization step at room temperature so as not to over-incubate neurons with trypsin and cause damage. Neurons release from plates much faster than epithelial-like cells at this stage.\nQuench the trypsin by adding 2 ml Differentiation Media #2 per 35 mm2 dish and use the media to rinse remaining neuronal cells off the plate. Then transfer contents to a 50 ml conical tube.\nCombine contents from up to 10 dishes in the 50 ml conical tube and gently triturate slowly up and down no more than five times with a 10 ml plastic pipet.\nDispense 2 ml cell suspension into ECM-coated 35 mm2 dishes and return to incubator.\n13. Day 11: Change Media (Differentiation Media #3)\nAdd RA (see Table 1) to warmed and equilibrated media immediately before adding media to dishes.\nGently aspirate off old media and discard.\nSlowly add 2 ml Differentiation Media #3 (see Table 2) with RA per 35 mm2 dish and return to incubator. Do not allow neurons to be exposed to air for an extended period of time.\n14. Day 14: Change Media (Differentiation Media #3)\nRepeat Section 13 (steps 1-3)\n15. Day 17: Last Media Change (Differentiation Media #3)\nRepeat Section 13 (steps 1-3)\n16. Day 18: Neuronal Cultures Ready to Use\nChange media to fresh Differentiation Media #3 with RA every 3 days to maintain neuron health.",
    "Note: Cells should be differentiated into neurons and exhibit a neuronal phenotype. Cultures are typically stable for up to 14 days following terminal differentiation, however duration of neuron viability is dependent on passage number of the undifferentiated cells at the start of differentiation. Higher passage numbers yield differentiated neurons with a shorter useful lifetime.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
