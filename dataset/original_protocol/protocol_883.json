    "**Day 1**\nInoculate yeast cells from a solid culture \\(agar plate) into 5 ml of YPD medium or appropriate selective medium supplemented with 2% \\(w/v) D-glucose and incubate at 28°C overnight with shaking.\n**Day 2**\n**A) Cell pellet preparation**\n1. Transfer overnight culture into 100 ml of YPD and incubate at 28°C with shaking. OD<sub>600 nm</sub> should be 0.3-0.5 \\(=1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cell/ml)\n  2. Place cells in 50-ml tubes and centrifuge at 3,000g for 4 min at 4°C.\n  3. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets by vortexing in 25 ml of sterile H<sub>2</sub>O. Combine two cell pellets and centrifuge at 3,000g for 2 min at 4°C.\n  4. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 1X PBS. Transfer into 2-ml screw-cap eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 2,000g for 2 min at 4°C.\n  5. Discard the supernatant and store the pellet at -80°C.\n  \n**B) Resin and pre-saturated tube preparation**\n1. Pre-saturate Protein G Resin: place 20 &#x3BC;l of Protein G Resin per sample to be immunoprecipitated in one 1.5-ml eppendorf tube and add 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA. Mix well. \n  2. Centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4°C.\n  3. Gently remove supernatant and wash three times with 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA.\n  4. Resuspend resin with 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA and incubate overnight at 4°C under gentle shaking.\n  5.    Pre-saturate eppendorf tubes with BSA: aliquot 1 ml of 1X PBS/BSA into 1.5-ml eppendorf tubes \\(two tubes for each sample) and incubate overnight at 4°C under gentle shaking. Wash with 1 ml of 1X PBS just before use.\n  \n**Day 3**\n1. Thaw cell pellets \\(from step A5 of Day 2) on ice and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold Inhibitors Buffer.",
    "2. Centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 &#x3BC;l of Inhibitors Buffer.\n  3. Add 1 g of 425-600-&#x3BC;m glass beads.\n  4. Homogenize using the FastPrep® System \\(Qbiogene-MP Biomedicals): shake for 15 sec and then keep on ice for 1 min. Repeat 10 times.\n  5. Check cell breakage under a microscope.\n  6. Pierce the tube bottom with a needle.\n  7. Insert the tube into a new 2-ml eppendorf tube and spin at top speed to transfer the cell extract into the lower tube.\n  8. Centrifuge at 16,000g for 20 min at 4°C.\n  9. Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5-ml eppendorf tube and adjust the volume to 1 ml with Inhibitors Buffer. \n  10. Determine sample protein concentration.\n  11. Normalize samples for protein concentration \\(optimal concentration: 2.5-3 mg/ml). Transfer 1 ml of each sample into the pre-saturated eppendorf tubes washed with 1 ml of 1X PBS \\(see \"Day-2, B-5\").\n  12. Transfer 50 &#x3BC;l of each normalized cellular extract into a new eppendorf tube and add 10 &#x3BC;l of Loading Buffer. Heat samples at 95°C for 5 min. Store at -20°C \\(**INPUT** sample).\n  13.  Add primary antibody to normalized samples and incubate for 2 hr at 4°C under gentle shaking to allow formation of antigen-antibody complexes. \\(We use 10 &#x3BC;g of monoclonal anti-HA antibodies).\n  14. Centrifuge pre-saturated Protein G Resin at 800g for 2 min at 4°C. Gently remove supernatant with pipette.\n  15. Wash resin twice with Inhibitors Buffer \\(gently remove supernatant with pipette).\n  16. Following the second wash, resuspend Protein G Resin 1:1 with 1X PBS.\n  17. Wash a pre-saturated eppendorf tube with 1 ml of 1X PBS for each sample. In each tube, add 1 ml of 1X PBS and 40 &#x3BC;l of Protein G Resin suspension from previous step.",
    "18. Centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant with pipette.\n  19. Add 1 ml of antigen-antibody complex \\(from step 13) and incubate for 2 hr at 4°C under gentle shaking.\n  20. Centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4°C.\n  21. Transfer 50 &#x3BC;l of supernatant in a new eppendorf tube and add 10 &#x3BC;l of Loading Buffer. Heat samples at 95°C for 5 min. Store samples at -20°C \\(**IMMUNODEPLETED** sample).\n  22. Discard the remaining supernatant and wash resin with 1 ml of a freshly prepared Inhibitors Buffer. Shake gently for 2 min and centrifuge at 800g for 2 min at 4°C.\n  23. Repeat step 22 three times. Remove supernatant with pipette.\n  24. Add 20 &#x3BC;l of 1:3 diluted Loading Buffer. Heat samples at 95°C for 5 min.\n  25. Centrifuge at top speed for 5 min at room temperature.\n  26. Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5-ml eppendorf tube. Store samples at -20°C \\[**IMMUNOPRECIPITATED** \\(**IP**) sample].\n  27. Analyze samples by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting \\(**IB**) \\(Figure 1)."
