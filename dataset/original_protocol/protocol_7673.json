    "Reverse transcription-specific target amplification (RT-STA) master mix preparation.Thaw the CellsDirect 2x Reaction Mix from the CellsDirectTM One-Step qRT-PCR kit. All steps should be performed  on ice, and reagents  should be chilled and/or thawed immediately prior to use.Transfer 65 μl of the 2x Reaction Mix to each tube of the PCR-8-Tube Strip.Add 5 μl of 2x Reaction Mix from the PCR-8-Tube Strip to each well of the 96 well-plate with the multichannel pipette.Since the amount of RNA from a single cell is few pictograms, we don’t perform a traditional RNA isolation protocol. Instead, the sorted cells are directly introduced into the 2x Reaction Mix. To ensure optimal sample preservation,  this master mix contains CellDirect 2x reaction Mix (CellsDirect One-Step qRT-PCR kit) and SUPERase-In. This enzyme protects the RNA extracted from a lysed cell from any RNAases that could be present in the RT-STA master mix.Cell sortingDetach the mouse ES cells with TryPLE Express solution. Gently aspirate away cell media culture and wash the cells with 5-6 ml of fresh 1x DPBS to remove serum that could inhibit TryPLE Express solution activity.Aspirate away the 1x DPBS.Add 1 ml of pre-warmed TryPLE Express solution directly to the cell culture plate, and incubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3-5 min.Take the cell culture plate out, gently tap or shake it, and then add 10 ml of fresh cell culture medium with 10% (v/v) FBS to stop trypsin activity. Mix cells with a pipette and transfer 1 x 106 cells into a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate the cell supernatant and resuspend 1 x 106 cells in 1 ml of 1x DPBS supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS.",
    "Keep 1 x 106 cells on ice before sorting or label the cells with the suitable surface markers according to the cell population you are interested to study.Add 10 μl of DAPI (> 200 ng/ml) or 10 μl of PI (5 μg/ml) per 1 x 106 cells to the single-cell suspension that contains 1 x 106 cells suspended in 1 ml of 1x DPBS supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS just before cell sorting to distinguish the live cell population.Perform cell sorting in FACS Aria II and data analysis with FACS Diva software. When sorting cells gate for singlet’s in your sorting parameters.Sort single cells directly into the wells of a 96 well-plate containing a 5 μl mixture of CellsDirect 2x reaction mix (component CellsDirect One-Step qRT PCR Kits, Invitrogen). We estimate that the final volume of the reaction after cells are sorted into the wells will be 6 μl.Note: Sort the cells into the same plate that is used for the RT-STA PCR. Always keep the well-plate on ice.Centrifuge at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min the 96 well-plate to let the cells go into the CellsDirect 2x reaction mix.Seal the plate with the optical adhesive film.Store the plate at -80 °C. This overnight freezing step allows a better lysis efficiency.Preparation of the Specific Target Amplification (RT- STA) master mix.Make an excel file template for the 96 well-plate and label each cell with the specific 20x Taqman assay probe.Thaw the 20x Taqman assays and deposit them in the 96 well-plate according to the location establish in the excel file template for each 20x Taqman assay probe.Thaw the plate with the sorted cells in the CellsDirect 2x reaction mix on ice.Prepare the assay mix in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube.",
    "Pool all Taqman real-time assays that will be analyzed in the single-cell real-time PCR that you previously deposited on a 96 well-plate in step b. Final concentrations of the Taqman assays used in the mix will be 0.2x. Use TE buffer to dilute the Taqman assays. This is the 0.2x assay mix.table:",

Leave the plate on ice for 5 min meantime you program the thermal cycler.Before you run the Reverse transcription and specific target amplification verify that each well from the 96 well plate has the components and the volumes according to the table below.

    "Seal the plate with the optical adhesive film.Priming the 96.96 Dynamic ArrayTM in the Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC).Take a BioMark 96 x 96 Dynamic Array from its bag. Avoid touching the center of the chip.Control line fluid on the chip or in the inlets makes the chip unusable. This chip needs to be use within 24 h after opening the package.Take the 96.96 syringes with 150 μl of control line fluid and inject the 150 μl of control line fluid into each accumulator on the chip by introducing the syringe through the accumulators and pushing down the black O-ring. Use one syringe per accumulator. Avoid bending the pipette tip from the syringe.Place the chip into the Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) controller HX, then select the Prime (136x) script program to prime the control line fluid into the chip. This program takes (~20 min).Chip LoadingLoad the chip within 60 minutes of priming to reduce the loss of pressure within the chip.Vortex thoroughly and at 300 x g, 4 °C for 5 min all assay and sample solutions from the 96 well-plates before pipetting into the chip inlets.Important: It is crucial to avoid forming any bubbles inside the chip inlets when loading the 10x assay mixes (prepared in step 5) on the chip inlets located on the left side and the 10x sample mixes (prepared on step 6) on the chip inlets located on the right side of the chip. To avoid bubbles, press the pipette only until the first stop. If bubbles appeared, pop them with a fresh sterile tip. Take care of cross-contamination or loss of reaction volume. Place the chip back into the IFC Controller HX, select the Load mix (163x) program to load the samples and assays into the chip. Selecting OK starts the loading.",
    "This program takes (~1 h and 30 min).While the Load Mix (136x) program is running select the “BioMark data collection Fluidigm” program from the computer.Select “double-click to warm up the lamp” from the program. The lamp will be ready in 20 min and the lamp indicator on the software should be in green.When the Load Mix (136x) program has finished, remove loaded chip from the IFC Controller HX.Using the data collection software.Double-click the data collection software icon on the desktop to launch the software.
