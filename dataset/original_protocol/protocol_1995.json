    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: When performing this protocol for the first time, we recommend either using spiked swab material with a known positive control (e.g., commercially available or laboratory-grown virus) or using swabs that have previously been tested by conventional extraction methods. Every extraction should include a positive control (in our case we employed laboratory-grown virus) and a negative extraction control (H2O). All steps in the extraction are performed at ambient temperature (16°C–40°C) unless otherwise stated.\nWe have performed this protocol on swabs from various different sources that have been stored at various temperatures (16°C to 40°C or −80°C) before analysis. As far as we can attest, all different viral transport media that are currently in circulation allow for successful isolation of viral material. Viral transport medium can be prepared as per CDC recommendation (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Viral-Transport-Medium.pdf[href=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Viral-Transport-Medium.pdf]), i.e., 2% FBS 100 μg /mL Gentamicin 0.5 μg /mL Amphotericin B in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Please refer to Page et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] for a more complete characterization of the robustness of this method.\nInactivation and lysis of swab material (individual samples)\nTiming: 1 min\nThis step inactivates potential SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and aids disruption of enveloped viral particles and subsequent solubilization of genetic material.\nWe recommend heat inactivation using a dry bead bath (either 70°C or 90°C for 10–30 min) prior to addition of SDS as it allows safe handling of otherwise infectious samples while preserving sensitivity of detection (Lista et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Inactivated swabs must ALWAYS be opened in a microbiological safety cabinet class I when possible (class II when I not available) for the safety of the handler. Once swab material is non inactivated samples can be handled on a regular bench.\nCritical: If swab samples are not heat inactivated, add SDS in a microbiological safety cabinet.",
    "Add 100 μL of 4% SDS per 100 μL of swab sample. Scale up appropriately if more swab sample is used. Incubation with SDS is not required.\nCritical: Check that there are no SDS precipitates. If precipitates are observed, place SDS in a lukewarm bath until precipitates are dissolved.\nInactivation and lysis of swab material (pooled samples)\nIf using the pooled protocol, scale up the amount of 4% SDS accordingly. For example, for 20 samples of 100 μL each, add 20 × 100 μL (=2 mL) 4% SDS.\nCritical: If swab samples are not heat inactivated, add SDS in a microbiological safety cabinet.\nCritical: Check that there are no SDS precipitates. If precipitates are observed, place SDS in a lukewarm bath until precipitates are dissolved.\nMastermix addition and RNA binding (individual samples)\nTiming: 6 min\nIn this step, RNA from the lysed sample binds to glassmilk.\nGM_MB contains NaCl as chaotropic agent, isopropanol to increase binding to glassmilk and glassmilk as RNA-binding matrix.\nPrepare GM_MB buffer as per instructions above. Prepare enough for all samples and consider an extra 10% for pipetting errors.\nAdd 610 μL of GM_MB to 200 μL of lysed swab (100 μL 4% SDS + 100 μL swab sample).\nIncubate 5 min at 16°C–40°C to allow RNA binding.\nMastermix addition and RNA binding (pooled samples)\nTiming: 6 min\nPrepare GM_MB buffer as per instructions above. Prepare enough for all samples and consider an extra 10% for pipetting errors. This will contain 20 μL of glassmilk and a multiple per sample of 400 μL isopropanol and 200 μL 1.25 M NaCL. Due to the increased volume, pooled samples are mixed in a Falcon tube.\nMix well by vortexing.\nIncubate 5 min at 16°C–40°C to allow RNA binding.\nRNA cleaning\nTiming: 3 min",
    "In this step, RNA from the lysed samples binds to glassmilk.\nThe bound RNA is pelleted and washed with 70% ethanol twice to remove excess proteins in the sample and increase the sensitivity of the PCR.\nSpin the sample at 4,500 g for 15 s.\nDiscard the supernatant by decanting into a waste basin. The pellet will not detach (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Decanting).\nDisaggregate the pellet of GM by tapping the plastic tube against a rack or by vortexing (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Disaggregation by tapping).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1593-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Resuspension of GM pellet by tapping against a tube rack\nIf using the pooled protocol, resuspend the pellet from the Falcon tube and transfer with a pipette to a microcentrifuge tube. Continue processing as described for individual samples.\nAdd 500 μL of 70% ethanol and mix by flicking the tube.\nNote: Steps 11 and 12 can be inverted, i.e., add 500 μL of 70% ethanol to the GM pellet and then tap the plastic tube against a rack or vortexing to resuspend (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], GM resuspension with ethanol).\nSpin the sample at 4,500 g for 15 s.\nDiscard the supernatant by decanting (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], Decanting).\nRepeat steps 11–14.\nSpin the tube at 7,000 × g for 15 s to allow complete ethanol removal.\nRemove all remaining 70% ethanol with a pipette.\nAir dry at 65°C for 5 min in a heat block or equivalent to remove all ethanol from the pelleted GM with bound RNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1593-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

We routinely use qRT-PCR but other methods such as RT-LAMP (reverse transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification) or CRISPR-based methods can also be employed.\nNote: We employed 50 μL of nuclease-free water to resuspend the GM matrix. Higher volumes such as 70 μL may be employed but lower volumes will likely not resuspend the GM matrix and/or carry over matrix to the downstream reaction.\nPause point: Extracted RNA can be frozen at this step. Long term storage is recommended at −80°C but short-term storage (∼1 week) can be done at −20°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4.

    "Reverse transcription and PCR\nThis step allows the detection of specific genes from SARS-CoV-2 in the eluted RNA, utilizing an internal human gene (RNAse P) as control of extraction.\nPrepare the RT-PCR reaction master mix with the following format. Importantly, always include a non-template control, in which the RNA is replaced with H2O. When possible, prepare the PCR reaction and plate at a different location to that where swabs are handled to reduce risk of contamination. The positive control from the RNA extraction can be employed as positive control in the RT-PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1593_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1593_5.csv\nNote: ∗ Controls must include positive and negative extraction controls and non-template PCR control.\nNote: For this step pooled and individual samples are treated equally. i.e., both are eluted in 50 μl water and 5 μl are used per technical replicate. For the purpose of establishing this protocol, we performed RT-PCR reactions in technical duplicates, for analytical purposes, it is custom to just perform one technical replicate. The limit of detection for our method, employing this master mix is Ct 36 (Page et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Other qRT-PCR conditions may be employed (Lista et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Reijns et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])."
