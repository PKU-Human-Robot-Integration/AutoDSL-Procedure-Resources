    "1. Preparation and Fabrication of the Electrospun Fiber Scaffold\nCAUTION: All work with solvents or polymer solutions should be performed in a chemical fume hood. Refer to material safety datasheet of each reagent before starting the protocol.\nTo electrospin a 3 mL 15% w/w PLGA polymer solution, weigh 720 mg of 50:50 poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA; 0.55 to 0.75 dL/g, 31-57 kDa) into a 10 mL scintillation vial. The volume of the solution is based on the typical batch size used in current studies.\n\tNOTE: The polymer mass to add to a given volume of solvent must be calculated by first determining the density of the solvent used to dissolve the polymer. The density of the solvent Hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) is 1.59 g/mL. Thus, the weight of solvent, based on a volume of 3.0 mL HFIP needed, is 4.8 g (3.0 mL x 1.59 g/mL). For a 15% w/w fraction of PLGA to HFIP, 720 mg PLGA must be added to 3.0 mL HFIP (0.15 x 4,800 mg = 720 mg). The advantage of using a % w/w polymer/solution, rather than % w/v, is that this provides a defined weight of the final solution. This defined weight enables more accurate solvent replacement, in the case of solvent evaporation during step 1.3.\nAdd 3.0 mL HFIP to the glass scintillation vial containing PLGA (from step 1.1) using a serological glass pipette. Cover the vial with plastic film, then measure and record the vial mass.\nIncubate the polymer suspension overnight at 37 °C to ensure complete dissolution of the polymer. If any solvent evaporates, decreasing the vial mass, add HFIP until the vial reaches its original mass in step 1.2.",
    "After incubation, prepare the electrospinning apparatus (Figure 2A). Although a mandrel of any size may be used, here a rotating 25 mm outer-diameter stainless steel mandrel was used as the collector.\n\tNOTE: A larger mandrel diameter will decrease the fiber thickness, given the same volume of electrospinning solution.\nAspirate the polymer solution into a 3 mL syringe.\nConnect a blunt 18-gauge, ½ inch needle tip to the syringe and dispense the excess solution (typically 0.25 mL) to remove empty headspace in the needle tip.\nPlace the syringe on a syringe pump and set the instrument flow rate to 2.0 mL/h.\n\tNOTE: This flow rate was previously optimized based on polymer viscosity for this formulation.\nConnect the power source to the syringe needle and electrospin the polymer solution using a voltage of +27 kV. The distance between the needle and collector should be set to approximately 25 cm (Figure 2B).\n\tCAUTION: The electrospinning process creates a solvent vapor. Use a fume hood or an enclosed apparatus (Figure 2) to remove the harmful vapor.\nOnce the entire solution is electrospun, turn off the power source and allow the mandrel to spin for an additional 30 min to fully evaporate solvent.\nTurn off the rotating mandrel collector, and use a razor blade to cut the fiber from the mandrel. Use the blade to gently peel the fiber from the mandrel.\nCollect the electrospun PLGA fiber into a labeled Petri dish, and place in a desiccatorovernight to remove residual solvent.\n2. Surface-modification of Fibers with GRFT",
    "Prepare solutions of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES buffer). Prepare PBS by dissolving 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, and 0.24 g KH2PO4 in 1 L of ultrapure water. Similarly, dissolve 19.52 g MES (free acid, MW 195.2) and 29.22 g NaCl in 1 L of ultrapure water, to prepare MES buffer. Ensure the final pH of each solution is between 7.2 - 7.5 and 5.0 - 6.0, respectively, using a pH meter.\nPrepare individual working solutions of EDC (2 mM) and NHS (5 mM).\nRemove the EDC and NHS from the freezer and allow them to equilibrate to room temperature before weighing.\nWeigh 4 mg of EDC into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nWeigh 6 mg of NHS into another microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 mL MES buffer to each tube. Vortex both tubes vigorously to ensure the reagents are fully dissolved.\nPrepare a solution of hydroxylamine by weighing 70 mg into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nAdd 20 mL PBS to the hydroxylamine and vortex to dissolve.\nMass out an appropriate amount of PLGA fiber into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Typically, 75 mg of fiber is used for each reaction batch.\nAdd 8 mL of MES buffer to the 15 mL tube.\nAdd 1 mL each of the EDC and NHS solutions prepared earlier to the tube. The final volume of the solution should be 10 mL. The final concentrations of EDC and NHS should be 0.4 mg/mL and 0.6 mg/mL, respectively.",
    "Close and seal the 15 mL tube with plastic film and place on a rotator to allow the solution to be gently inverted for 15 min at room temperature (Figure 3B). This step activates the carboxyl groups on the polymer to allow for covalent modification with the GRFT protein (Figure 3A).\nAfter activation, carefully quench the reaction by adding 14 µL of β-mercaptoethanol to the tube. Invert the tube several times to ensure complete mixing.\n\tCAUTION: β-mercaptoethanol is highly toxic and should only be used in a chemical fume hood.\nDiscard the supernatant and rinse the PLGA fiber twice, with 10 mL of PBS, to remove any remaining β-mercaptoethanol.\nAfter rinsing, add an appropriate amount of GRFT stock solution to the tube. For example, a 5 nmol GRFT/mg fiber would require 6.35 µL of GRFT stock solution (from a 10 mg/mL stock) per mg of fiber. Thus a 75 mg fiber sample would require 476.25 µL of 10 mg/mL GRFT stock solution.\n\tNOTE: GRFT fibers with theoretical loadings of 0.05, 0.5, and 5 nmol GRFT per mg fiber were fabricated.\nAdd enough PBS to bring the final volume to 8 mL, close and invert the tube to ensure thorough mixing.\nSeal the tube with plastic film and place on a rotor again, this time for 2 h.\nAfter the 2 h incubation, quench the reaction by adding 2 mL of hydroxylamine solution into the 15 mL centrifuge tube. Per manufacturer instructions, the final concentration of hydroxylamine during the quenching reaction should be 0.7 mg/mL.\nMix the solution well and discard the supernatant. Rinse the surface-modified PLGA fiber twice with 10 mL ultrapure water to remove any unconjugated GRFT.",
    "Transfer the fiber to a Petri dish and place inside of a desiccator until the fiber is completely dry. Transfer the Petri dish to 4 °C for storage.\n3. SEM Characterization of GRFT Surface-modified Fibers\nPlace a strip of double-sided carbon tape on an SEM specimen mount. Label the bottom of the specimen mount with the sample identifying information using a permanent marker.\nCut three samples from one surface-modified fiber and place them on separate specimen mounts. The thickness of each sample is approximately 0.5 mm.\nSputter coat the samples using electron-induced particle deposition from a gold plate. Sputter coat for 90 s, at 2.4 kV.\n\tNOTE: The sputter coat time may vary depending on equipment parameters, including voltage and amperage.\nImage the samples at 8 kV with a magnification ranging from 1,000 to 5,000X.\n4. Extraction of GRFT from Surface-modified Fibers\nMass out 2 mg of fiber in triplicate into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the tube, then vortex and incubate for 1 min at room temperature to completely dissolve the fiber.\nAfter incubation, dilute a 10 µL aliquot of the DMSO-fiber solution from step 4.2, at least 100-fold in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH = 8.0).\nStore samples at -20 °C until loading characterization with ELISA.\n5. Measuring GRFT Desorption from Fibers\nTo assess the amount of GRFT released or desorbed from the fiber, weigh 5 - 10 mg of surface-modified fiber and place in a microcentrifuge tube. Record the fiber mass in each tube.\nAdd 1 mL of an appropriate solution that mimics the physiological environment (e.g., PBS, TE buffer, simulated vaginal fluid (SVF), etc.) to each sample.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h on a rotating shaker at 200 rpm, 37 °C.",
    "After incubation, remove approximately 1 mL of TE buffer containing the desorbed GRFT from the vial, and aliquot to cluster tubes. Store at -20 °C until protein quantification.\nTransfer the sample to a new microcentrifuge tube, add 1 mL of fresh buffer solution to the fiber within the microcentrifuge tube, and incubate until the next time point.\nTypical time points used to measure release include: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 h, and 1 wk. Negligible desorption was observed in these studies after 4 h.\n6. Quantification of GRFT Extraction and Desorption via ELISA\nCoat a 96-well ELISA plate with 0.1 mL of HA (10 µg/mL) per well as previously described51. Seal the plate with plastic film and incubate overnight at 4 °C (Figure 4).\nRemove the coating buffer, and add 0.3 mL blocking buffer (2 - 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20) to each well. Incubate the plate for at least 2 h at room temperature.\nAfter incubation, rinse the plate 3 times with 1x PBS with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (PBS-P). After rinsing, dispense 0.1 mL of sample, standard, or PBS as negative control into the respective wells. Incubate the plate again for 1 h at room temperature.\nRinse the plate 3 times again with PBS-P. After rinsing, add 0.1 mL of primary antibody (goat anti-GRFT antiserum) into each well and incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature. Typically, the primary antibody solution is diluted by 1:10,000 in PBS.\nAfter incubating the samples with primary antibody rinse the plates again 3 times with PBS-P. Add 0.1 mL of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG) to each well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody solution is diluted by 1:10,000 in PBS.",
    "Wash the plate 3 times. Add 0.1 mL TMB 2-peroxidase substrate to each well. Monitor color development (approximately 2 min), then add 0.1 mL H2SO4 (1 N) to quench the reaction. Read plate at 450 nm on a plate reader.\nAverage the background OD values (wells which only receive PBS), and subtract this from the experimental groups.\nSubscription Required.
