    "1. Preparing the Experimental Setup\nPrior to the subject's arrival set up the EEG equipment in the control room where the scanner operator will sit. Connect the laptop computer to the EEG hardware as shown in Figure 1. Note: all triggers from peripheral devices and the MR scanner must have durations of more than 200 μsec to be detected by the EEG system.\nSet up the stimulus computer; in this study, we use a visual stimulus; markers are read into the BrainVision Recorder at the beginning and end of each stimulation period.\nEnsure the workspace for recording the data is set to the highest temporal resolution available and correct filter settings. For the majority of studies AC-coupling with a filter of 0.016-250 Hz is optimal although DC-coupling or a higher (1 kHz) low-pass filter may be required if ultra low or high frequency neuronal signals are of interest, respectively.\nCheck the markers from the scanner and stimulus presentation to confirm that they are being recorded by the EEG system correctly. Turn on the synchronization of the scanner and EEG clocks using the BrainVision Recorder control panel. Then check if synchronization is successful; if the set up is correct the green icon and \"Sync On\" dot will appear.",
    "Set up the MR scanner in the conventional way; here we're using the body transmit RF coil and a 32 channel head receive RF coil. When possible, it is best to use a head-sized transmit coil to minimize the risk of RF heating of the EEG cap and associated cables. However on most scanners, the head transmit coil cannot be used in conjunction with a multi-element receiver coil, which leads to a sub-optimal set up for acquisition of fMRI data (in particular parallel imaging speed-up is not possible). We are using this specific head receive coil because it incorporates an access port which allows the cables from the EEG cap to run along a straight path out of the scanner.\nEnsure the MR sequences to be run are set up. The fMRI sequence must use a slice TR which is a multiple of the EEG clock period (200 μsec). If using a Philips MR system the Philips Timing calculator can be used to determine the possible slice and TR combinations.\nMake one final check that all equipment is recording as expected.\n2. Subject Arrival\nAsk the subject to arrive with clean hair and wearing comfortable, non-metallic clothing.\nExplain to the subject the purpose of the experiment and what will happen.\nAsk the subject to fill out forms that are used to establish that there are no contra-indications for MR scanning and that the subject consents to participation in the experiment. Check the forms before proceeding. In this study the approval of the local ethics committee has been obtained and all subjects gave informed consent.",
    "Measure the head-circumference and select the appropriately sized cap (i.e. the smallest available cap that is larger than the head size). Place the cap on the head starting at the front of the head and pulling backwards. Position the cap correctly, such that Cz electrode is sited half way between the nasion and inion and also centered left-right.\nConnect the electrodes to the head by: moving hair out of the way, applying alcohol and then Abralyte gel. Attach the ECG electrode to the base of the back using a similar method to that used for the cap electrodes. This electrode is used to measure the heartbeat. The positioning at the base of the back is recommended to maximize the signal to noise of the R-peak in the ECG trace as well as for subject comfort.\nWork on the contacts so as to reduce the impedances of electrodes on the head to less than 10 kΩ (excluding the resistance of the internal resistors in each electrode) . ECG and EOG resistance may be higher as the signals are stronger and good connections can be hard to achieve, but must be kept below 50kΩ.\nCheck the EEG data quality is satisfactory by visually inspecting the data on the monitor screen.\n3. Recording Outside of the MR Scanner\n(Optional: Only Required if You Wish to Compare EEG Data Quality from Inside and Outside the MR Scanner)\nSet up the presentation apparatus and EEG equipment outside the scanner (in a location where the magnetic field is low). Ensure that the setup is as similar as possible to that used inside the MR scanner (in particular the subject should be supine and a similar process of stimulus presentation should be used).",
    "Perform the experiment and record the data in a similar way to that used inside the scanner (see Section 4).\n4. Setting Subject up Inside the MR Scanner\nAsk the subject to be seated whilst you set up the EEG equipment in the MR scanner room.\nTake the amplifier into the shielded room and place it on a table at the back of the scanner. Attach the amplifier to a long fiber optic cable. Pass the fiber optic cable through the waveguide and attach it to the BrainAmp USB adaptor in the control room (Figure 1).\nRegister the patient in the MR scanner patient data-base.\nTake the subject into the room and ask them to lie on the scanner bed.\nGive the subject earplugs, head-phones and call button, and ensure that they are comfortable.\nPut the head coil over the subject's head. The EEG cables must leave the head coil along the shortest path possible. Now pad the subject's head to minimize head movement.\nMove the subject into the scanner bore, ensuring that electrodes Fp1 and Fp2 are at isocentre of the MR scanner in the z-direction. This is normally achieved by aligning these two electrodes with the light that is used to position the subject before they enter the bore.\nAttach the EEG cap to the amplifier at the rear of the scanner. Ensure that there are no wire loops in the EEG leads (as these can lead to RF heating and also cause larger EEG artifacts to be induced) and that the cabling is isolated from MR scanner vibrations as much as possible; here we use a cantilevered beam to achieve this isolation.\n5. Recording Inside the Scanner\nTalk to the subject from the console room to confirm that they can hear the scanner operator and are OK.",
    "A second experimenter starts the EEG monitoring, checking for noisy electrodes in the traces, as well as for the green \"Sync On\" dot at the bottom of the screen.\nThe clear effect of the cryo-pumps on the recording can be seen (see Figure 2). Therefore, switch off these pumps during data acquisition, following manufacturer guidelines.\nAsk the subject to move their head by a small amount. The importance of keeping the head still can be seen from the large voltages in the EEG recording that result from small head movements.\nTest the recording of neuronal activity by asking the subject to open and close their eyes. Look for occipital alpha activity. This will test whether you are measuring physiological signals rather than noise. If an alpha signal cannot be seen on a subject (which occurs in some subjects) it is possible to test for neuronal activity by performing a short run of the experimental paradigm without the MR scanner running and to look for the averaged evoked potential.\nThe pulse artifact can clearly be seen in the raw data (see Figure 2) particularly on electrodes over the temples. Use the ECG trace to correct this artifact in real time using RecView (or in post processing software packages).\nAs soon as each MRI scan begins the gradients will cause large artifacts in the EEG data.\nWhen the fMRI experiment is ready to start, - with the stimulus presentation system in a ready state - then begin saving the EEG data by following the steps shown.",
    "Now start the experiment, checking that the markers from the stimulus presentation and the MR scanner can be seen in BrainVision Recorder. Here the stimulus consists of a full-field radial checkerboard at 100% contrast. The reversal rate is 2 Hz such that an evoked response will occur every 500 msec and a marker is placed in the EEG file at each image reversal.\nThe EEG data quality will appear to be very poor, but it can be cleaned up, either on-line in RecView or during post processing. In order for the gradient artefact correction to work without compromising the recording of neuronal signals, the stimulus presentation must not be locked to the TR and the frequency of stimulus repetition must not be equal to the slice repetition frequency.\nGradient artefact correction must be carried out prior to pulse artefact correction (see Figures 3 and 4). Data may then be segmented according to stimulus presentation and analyzed with numerous techniques; the simplest of which is averaging for investigation of evoked responses (see Figure 6).\n6. Debriefing the Subject\nOnce the scanning is complete, take the subject out of the scanner and help them to take off the EEG cap.\nAllow them to wash their hair.\nThey are now free to leave.\n7. Clearing up at the End of Experiment\nPack up the EEG equipment as required by your laboratory. If the MR manufacturer requires it, make sure that the synchronization hardware is unplugged at the end of each session and not left attached to the scanner electronics.",
    "Finally, the EEG cap must be cleaned. To do this, soak the cap in water (normally for approximately 5 min) or a water and disinfectant mixture (the disinfectant should be selected according relevant pathogen spectrum and disinfectant recommendation of the cap manufacturer. Exposure time and disinfectant concentration must follow the guidelines of the disinfectant manufacturer.). Then use a toothbrush to clean away residual gel. It is very important to clean the cap fully to ensure the proper performance of the cap when subsequently used.\n8. Analysis\nHere, real time EEG analysis has been demonstrated, however it is also possible and normally desirable to post-process the EEG data. This can be done in a number of analysis packages such as Brain Products Analyzer 2 or EEGLAB.\nGradient and pulse artifact correction can be performed using a variety of methods such as: average artifact subtraction18,19 (commonly used for gradient correction and often used for pulse artifact correction), independent component analysis20,21 or optimal basis sets22 (for pulse artifact correction).\nData may then be analyzed in the time or frequency domain to look at evoked responses and on-going oscillatory activity.\nHere, we recorded the ECG trace using the Brain Products system so as to obtain information necessary for pulse artifact correction. In the standard setup the ECG trace is recorded by means of a dedicated electrode placed on the back of the subject. In our lab we use also a non-standard solution, which employs a vectrocardiogram to generate the cardiac trace (this solution is available only with the Philips physiological monitoring equipment). We have found this can be useful if a clean trace cannot be obtained using the conventional ECG set-up."
