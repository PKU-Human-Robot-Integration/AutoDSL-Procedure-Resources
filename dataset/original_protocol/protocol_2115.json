    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nChIP bead preparation (day -1)\nTiming: 1 h + 16–24 h incubation\nThis step allows conjugation of the target protein directed antibody to magnetic beads for ChIP the next day.\nFor each ChIP, place an Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of ice-cold PBS 1×/0.5% BSA on a magnetic rack. Add 50 μL of well resuspended magnetic Dynabeads® Protein A or G (mix by gentle inversions), taking care to pipet up and down repeatedly to not leave any beads in the tips.\nCritical: Avoid vortexing the magnetic beads as this may damage them and affect the quality of the MS results (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nNote: The choice of Dynabeads® Protein A or G depends on the antibody species and isotypes. Please refer to the manufacturer's instructions.\nWash four times with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS 1×/0.5% BSA. For each wash, resuspend the beads by tube inversions, spin quickly and use the magnet to remove the liquid before the next wash to avoid losing beads.\nAdd 500 μL ice-cold PBS 1×/0.5% BSA and 5 μg of antibody against your protein of interest (In Dufour et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], we used an mTOR-specific antibody) or non-specific IgG of the species targeted by your specific antibody (e.g., IgG Rabbit in our case). Resuspend by tube inversions.\nNote: The quantity of antibody for each ChIP needs to be optimized as it depends on the antibody and the genomic abundance of the target protein on chromatin (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nNote: To ensure reproducibility between independent experiments, keep enough antibody from the same lot for all replicates to avoid differences in antibody concentration and/or affinity for the target protein.\nThe antibody-bead mixture is left 16–24 h on a rotator at 4°C.\nDouble crosslinking (day 0)\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "In this step, protein-protein crosslinking is achieved with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and protein-DNA crosslinking with formaldehyde.\nRemove media from the cell culture plate and wash with 20 mL of PBS 1× containing protease inhibitors.\nFor double crosslinking:\nIncubate cells with mild agitation for 20 min in 20 mL of PBS 1× containing 2 mM DSG (40 μL of DSG 1 M for 20 mL of PBS 1×).\nWithout removing the PBS/DSG, add formaldehyde directly to 1% final (541 μL of 37% formaldehyde) for an additional 10 min at 22°C–24°C with mild agitation.\nNote: Add formaldehyde inside the plate with PBS/DSG, so DSG stays 30 min and formaldehyde 10 min.\nCrosslinking is quenched by the addition of 0.1 M glycine final, pH 3.5 (824 μL of 2.5 M glycine, pH 3.5).\nWash twice with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS 1× quickly.\nNote: To quickly stop the double-crosslinking, simply remove the PBS + DGS/formaldehyde by inverting the plate into a waste container. Do not waste time aspirating the media which could also dislodge adherent cells. When cold PBS is added to the plates during the washes, add it gently near the sides of the plates to avoid detaching cells.\nScrape cells using a silicone scraper and collect cells from two plates into a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g (3,170 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C to obtain the crosslinked cell pellet.\nRemove the supernatant and go to the next step.",
    "Critical: Crosslink all plates for the exact same time. To avoid variations, label the plates from 1, 2,… etc. and start the timer after addition of the first crosslinker to plate #1 and space the addition of PBS/DSG every 30 s for subsequent plates. Do the same for the second crosslinker in the same order of the numbered plates.\nNucleus isolation (day 0)\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step allows isolation of nuclear pellets without cytosolic protein contamination.\nAdd 10 mL of cold lysis buffer 1 (LB1) containing protease inhibitors to crosslinked cell pellets, resuspend by pipetting up and down and rotate at 4°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g (3,170 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant. The pellet is constituted of nuclei.\nAdd 10 mL of cold LB2 with protease inhibitors to the nuclear pellets, resuspend by pipetting up and down and rotate at 4°C for 10 min to wash the nuclei and remove contamination from cytosolic proteins.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g (3,170 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant. See below for an optional pause point after this step, although we do not recommend it.\nAdd 500 μL of cold LB3 with protease inhibitors per number of plates used (e.g., if you collected cells from two plates, put 1 mL of LB3) and resuspend nuclei by pipetting up and down.\nAliquot resuspended nuclei in 500 μL volumes in Eppendorf tubes and continue to sonication.",
    "Pause point: Freezing samples decreases the efficiency of RIME. If you wish to freeze at this point, freeze the nuclear pellets without supernatant (after completing step 15) using a dry ice/ethanol slurry, then store the samples at −80°C. We strongly recommend to not freeze samples until reaching step 27 after completing the ChIP. Ideally, if possible, do not freeze samples until after the entire on-beads digestion protocol is completed.\nSonication (day 0)\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step allows for the generation of chromatin fragments enriched ∼500 bp in size prior to performing ChIP for isolation of bait protein-containing complexes bound to chromatin.\nSonicate nuclei on an ice bath 8–10 times each for 15 s by pulse using a manual sonicator, Fisher Scientific model 100, set to power 11. Additional rounds of sonication may be necessary. See Notes below.\nNote: To prevent the samples from overheating, we recommend using an ice bath rather than ice only and rotate between tubes during sonication pulses. Adding water to ice helps keep the samples colder during sonication with the ice-cold water forming a more direct contact with the tubes. Do not add too much water, otherwise the tubes may flip over and risk sample loss and contamination. Tubes should be firmly placed in the ice bath. Remember to clean the probe between tubes from different conditions.\nNote: During sonication, the sonicator probe should be inserted enough into the liquid (middle is recommended) to avoid sample bubbling (foaming) causing likely sample loss and protein degradation. Avoid touching the bottom of the tubes with the sonicator probe to prevent plastic contamination and tube piercing from overheating.",
    "Note: As an indicator that the sonication is working, the liquid should become more clear (less opaque) and consequently the graduated lines of the Eppendorf tube will be more visible. The only way to ensure that the sonication efficiency is reached is to validate this by analyzing the samples by agarose gel electrophoresis (see steps 19–21 below). A double crosslinked sample is always harder to sonicate than a single crosslinked sample (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nAdd 30 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to each sample tube.\nCentrifuge at 13,684 × g (12,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4°C and pool supernatants from the same condition into the same new Eppendorf tube. Keep cold on ice.\nVerify the sonication efficiency by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that DNA was fragmented to 200–1,000 bp with a concentration at ∼500 bp:\nTransfer 5 μL of sonicated nuclear lysate in a new Eppendorf tube for each condition.\nAdd 95 μL of chromatin fast de-crosslinking buffer and incubate at 65°C for 1 h.\nNote: Vortexing the samples prior to the start of the incubation, at one point during the incubation, and at the end will aid in the efficiency of the de-crosslink.\nPurify de-crosslinked samples using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Refer to manufacturer’s instructions) and elute in 30 μL elution buffer from the kit.\nLoad 15 μL of eluate with DNA loading dye on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide to detect sonication efficiency. Examples of chromatin efficiency are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1701-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of good and bad sonicated chromatin smears\nBp, base pairs.\nIf the desired sonication is achieved, continue to step 22, otherwise sonicate more, and repeat steps 17, 18, and 21.\nCritical: Always sonicate on ice and avoid foaming to not denature and precipitate proteins.\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (day 0)",
    "Timing: 1 h + 16–24 h incubation\nThis step allows to keep only the protein complexes that contain your protein of interest.\nWash the antibody-bound beads (step 4) three times with 1 mL ice-cold PBS 1×/0.5% BSA to remove any unbound antibody. Refer to step 2 for washing guidelines.\nAdd the sonicated nuclear lysate (∼1 mL) from step 20 per ChIP (two 15 cm plates / ChIP).\nTubes are left to rotate at 4°C for 16–24 h.\nWashing (day 1)\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step removes non-specific protein complexes with RIPA buffer washes and removes detergents and salts for peptide ionization and trypsin digestion of proteins with ammonium bicarbonate (AMBIC) buffer washes (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nThe next day, wash beads five times with 1 mL of fresh ice-cold RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. Refer to step 2 for washing guidelines.\nWash 4 times with 500 μL of cold 100 mM AMBIC freshly made. For the second AMBIC wash, transfer the beads to a new Eppendorf tube to avoid non-specific protein attachment to the tube.\nResuspend beads in 50 μL of cold fresh 100 mM AMBIC and keep on ice. Your samples are now ready to be digested by trypsin and subsequent MS analysis.\nPause point: Freezing samples decreases the efficiency of RIME, but if you wish to freeze at this point, freeze the resuspended beads prior to on-beads digestion using a dry ice/ethanol slurry and store the samples −80°C. If possible, do not freeze until after completing all steps of the on-beads digestion protocol.\nOn-beads digestion\nTiming: 3 h + 16–24 h incubation\nThe on-beads digestion used in the study by Dufour et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] was performed as follows:",
    "For 16–24 h at 37°C with a ratio trypsin enzyme:protein of 1:20 in 2 M urea/≈50 mM AMBIC performed as follows (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]):\nAdd 100 μL of 6 M urea/100 mM AMBIC directly onto the washed beads that were resuspended with 50 μL 100 mM AMBIC from step 27, for a final concentration of 4 M urea.\nShake the samples for 10 min at 1,200 rpm on an Eppendorf MixMate®.\nAdd 200 μL of 50 mM AMBIC to decrease the urea concentration to less than 2 M.\nFor trypsin, 5 μg protein were considered. Thus, for a ratio 1:20 enzyme:protein, 0.25 μg of trypsin was added to the sample (e.g., 5 μL of trypsin at 0.05 μg/μL).\nIncubate at 37°C for 16–24 h.\nReduce samples with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a final concentration of ≈13 mM (e.g., add 150 μL of 45 mM DTT/100 mM AMBIC) at 37°C for 30 min.\nAfter cooling for 10 min, alkylate the samples with iodoacetamide (IAA) at a final concentration of ≈23 mM (e.g., add 150 μL of a 100 mM IAA/100 mM AMBIC solution) at 22°C–24°C for 20 min in the dark.\nAcidify the supernatants with 4.5 μL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 100% and clean from residual detergents and reagents with MCX cartridges (Waters Oasis MCX 96-well μElution Plate) following these instructions:\nWet cartridge with 500 μL of methanol.\nEquilibrate with 500 μL of 0.1% TFA.\nResuspend sample with a minimal amount (200–400 μL) of 0.1% TFA or acidify sample with 10% TFA so that the pH is < 3.\nLoad sample slowly to cartridge. Can load repeatedly to ensure binding (recuperate the flow through in the original tube).\nWash with 500 μL of 0.1% TFA.\nWash with 500 μL of 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA.\nWash with 500 μL of water (HPLC grade).",
    "Elute with 350 μL of fresh 1:9 ratio of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH):methanol (or with 250 μL if using LowBind tubes).\nNote: Use a vacuum manifold to pull solvents through the plate. Be sure to elute into glass tubes. MCX cartridges should be able to be run dry without loss of recovery. Cover plate with aluminum tape and cut holes for each sample. Re-cover used holes with aluminum tape and mark as used.\nNote: For the 1:9 ratio of NH4OH:methanol solution: add 200 μL of 28% NH4OH to 1 mL of methanol, then bring the volume up to 2 mL with methanol.\nDry samples with a Speed-vac and store them at −20°C for a few days prior to MS analysis.\nMass spectrometry\nTiming: 1 day\nThis MS method is intended to serve as an example. When using other LC or MS instruments, users are recommended to adjust the MS method to their setup. The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) setup used in the study by (Dufour et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) consisted of:\nSamples were reconstituted under agitation for 15 min in 12 μL of 2% acetonitrile/1% formic acid and loaded into a 75 μm i.d. × 150 mm Self-Pack C18 column installed in the Easy-nLC II system. The HPLC system was coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos spectrometer through a Nanospray Flex Ion Source.\nNote: The buffers used for chromatography were 0.2% formic acid (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile/0.2% formic acid (solvent B). Peptides were eluted with a three-slope gradient at a flowrate of 250 L/min. Solvent B first increased from 2 to 29% in 70 min, then from 29 to 44% in 50 min and finally from 44 to 95% B in 6 min.",
    "LC-MS/MS data acquisition was accomplished using a seventeen-scan event cycle comprised of a full scan MS for scan event 1 acquired in the Orbitrap.\nNote: The mass resolution for MS was set to 60,000 (at m/z 400) and used to trigger the sixteen additional MS/MS events acquired in parallel in the linear ion trap for the top sixteen most intense ions. Mass over charge ratio range was from 360 to 1700 for MS scanning with a target value of 1,000,000 charges and from ∼1/3 of parent m/z ratio to 2000 for MS/MS scanning with a target value of 10,000 charges. The data dependent scan events used a maximum ion fill time of 100 ms and 1 microscan. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 31 s after 2 counts. Nanospray and S-lens voltages were set to 1.3–1.7 kV and 50 V, respectively. Capillary temperature was set to 250°C. MS/MS conditions were the following: normalized collision energy, 35 V; activation q, 0.25; activation time, 10 ms.\nAlternatives: Other HPLC and mass spectrometry instrumentation represent valid options for this analysis.
