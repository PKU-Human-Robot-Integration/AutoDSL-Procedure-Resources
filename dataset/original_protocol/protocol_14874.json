    "NOTE: Experimental protocols and patient consent forms for obtaining fat were reviewed and approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol #2188). All animal procedures were approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) under Protocol #9999. All experiments were conducted with strict adherence to animal safety and humane care guidelines.\n1. Fat Harvesting\nUsing the Coleman procedure17-19, obtain human adipose tissue from the abdomen, flank, and/or thigh regions of healthy female patients undergoing elective liposuction.\nTo process the lipoaspirate for grafting, begin by allowing the fat to settle for 30 min.\nLipoaspirate typically settles into three layers, with oil at the top, fat in the middle, and blood at the bottom. Aspirate and discard the top oil layer and the bottom blood layer.\nTo further remove any remaining tumescent fluid or cell debris, centrifuge the fat for 5 min at 350 x g and 4 °C, and aspirate the bottom aqueous layer.\nCalculate the amount of fat needed for grafting, allowing for 20% delivery error, and transfer the desired volume of fat to 50 ml conical(s). Multiply 400 by the number of mice in the study to obtain microliters of fat needed for grafting.\nAt this point, if performing Cell Assisted Lipotransfer20,21, place volume of fat for grafting on ice. Then harvest adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) from the remaining fat using the standard technique described by Zuk et al22.\n2. Fat Grafting\nObtain female, homozygous CD-1 nude mice for the experimental study. Choose mice between 8 - 12 weeks of age.\nTo induce anesthesia, place mouse into a knockdown box with 2.5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture at 2 L/min for approximately 10 min. Please note that recommended isoflurane dose varies with mouse strain.",
    "When the respiration rate of the mouse has slowed, confirm adequate sedation with a toe pinch. Apply veterinary lubricating ophthalmic ointment to both eyes of the mouse.\nIf mouse does not flinch in response to toe pinch, this confirms a sufficient plane of anesthesia. Place the mouse’s nose into a nosecone delivering 2.5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture at 1-2 L/min. If mouse retracts from toe pinch, return to knockdown box and retest after 5 min.\nSet up sterile field under mouse and then sterilize scalp with 2.5% povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol solution. Repeat two more times. \nPlace surgical drapes over the mouse and be careful to maintain sterile field.  Sterile instruments, gloves, and PPE should be used at all times.\nIf fat volume to be grafted was previously placed on ice, allow fat to first adjust to RT before delivery.\nBackload a 1 ml luer-lock syringe with 1 ml of fat.\nConnect a 14 G, 8 cm long fat grafting cannula to the end of the syringe.\nPrime system by depressing the syringe plunger until between 200 and 400 µl of fat remains in the syringe. While depressing the syringe plunger confirm that the cannula has fully filled with fat by observing fat exiting the distal cannula hole.\nUsing fine forceps, lift the dorsal skin in the midline overlying the caudal-most aspect of the skull. Make a 1.5 mm cut in the skin using fine scissors.\nPlace a single 6-0 nylon suture through middle of the cut that will later be used to bring the wound edges together after grafting is performed. Do not tie the suture.",
    "Create a subcutaneous pocket over the skull by inserting the cannula through the skin incision and passing the cannula back and forth in a fan-shaped pattern over the skull to free any connective tissue attachments to the overlying skin.\nOnce the pocket has been created, position the cannula in the midline of the mouse directly over the skull until the tip lies at the rostral-most aspect of the pocket which should be just behind a line drawn between the eyes. (Figure 1A)\nSlowly inject the fat in a retrograde fashion, advancing the plunger while pulling the cannula back. Using forceps, bring the wound edges together and lift them up to keep any fat from leaking out of the pocket.\nTie the suture that was previously placed, making sure that the first knot lies lightly against the skin. Tie three more square knots and cut the suture with a 3 mm tail. (Figure 1B)\nConfirm with visualization and manual palpation that the pocket is not overfilled and skin overlying the pocket is not tense. If the pocket has been overfilled, cut the suture and remove all fat from within the pocket. Wash the pocket out with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 and re-inject a smaller volume of fat.\nRemove mouse from anesthesia and place on its back or side in a clean cage by itself. Monitor the animal for regular breathing, normal movements, absence of bleeding, and signs of pain or distress. Administer buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 6 hr for up to 48 hr if the animal is in pain.\nMake sure that the animal has woken up sufficiently to maintain sternal recumbency before leaving it unattended. Do not place animal into a cage with other animals until it has fully recovered.",
    "After 4 hr, ensure that the animal is able to eat and drink, move, and breathe normally and that there is no bleeding from the operative site. Return it to the animal care facility.\n3. Micro-CT\nScan mice for baseline volume by post-operative Day 3, and then repeat scans at post-operative Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8.\nWhen imaging the mice at each time point, follow pre- and post-procedural sedation and animal care guidelines as outlined previously in Steps 2.2-2.4 and 2.17-2.19.\nPerform scans on a micro-CT scanner with a reconstruction voxel size of 100 µm or better.\nWith a peak X-ray kilovoltage of 80 kVp and an anode current of 450 µA, administer a ration dose of approximately 5 centiGy during a 9 min scan to each mouse. Please note these values vary depending upon the scanning protocol.\nPrior to performing the first scan, calibrate micro-CT with an imaging phantom that distinguishes between air, water, and bone intensity.\nPlace four mice into scanner in the ventral position with two mice on top and two on bottom. A scanning bed can easily be constructed using 60 ml syringes to hold the mouse body and 10 ml syringes as nose cones.23\nMaintain mice under anesthesia with a 2.5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture at 1-2 L per min.\nConfirm with scout image that the entire skull of the mouse, from nose to first cervical vertebra, and from top of skull to base of skull, will be imaged.\n4. Micro-CT Analysis\nOpen the reconstructed images with a micro-CT imaging analysis software that allows the creation of Regions of Interest (ROI’s) by selecting voxels using thresholds for pixel intensity. Software also allows creation of 3D surfaces through the interpolation of selected voxels, and for volume analysis.",
    "Start by loading the reconstructed CT images in two-dimensional (2D) coronal, axial, and sagittal views. (Figure 2A)\nUsing the axial slice as a guide, navigate to the sagittal slice that corresponds to the left-most aspect of the fat graft. Select an upper and lower threshold for pixel intensity that captures all voxels corresponding to the fat graft, but that excludes the surrounding tissue and bone. (Figure 2B)\nDefine an ROI in the sagittal view that corresponds to the fat graft using previously defined pixel intensity thresholds. Repeat this procedure every fifth sagittal slice, navigating until the right-most aspect of the graft is reached. (Figure 2C)\nInterpolate selected voxels from all 2D ROI’s into a single, combined 3D ROI. (Figure 2D)\nRecord ROI volume calculated by the software.\nRender the 3D isosurface to visualize the final fat graft volume. (Figure 2E)\nIn subsequent analyses, be sure to keep the pixel intensity maximum and minimum threshold values the same as those used for the baseline analysis.\n5. Fat Harvest\nAfter mice have been scanned for the week 8 24,25 time point, anesthetize the mice as previously described above in Steps 2.2-2.4 and 2.17-2.19.\nFollowing APLAC guidelines, euthanize the mice by separating their spinal columns.\nPlace mouse in operative field. Using tenotomy scissors, carefully open the pocket and dissect the overlying skin and connective tissue attachments from the fat graft.\nAt this point, it may help to excise a patch of the overlying dorsal skin to aid in extraction of the graft. (Figure 3A)\nLightly maintain traction on the graft with forceps and turn graft from side to side to visualize successive points of tension that need to be released with scissors.\nStay as close to the graft as possible when excising to minimize the connective tissue taken with the graft. (Figure 3B)",
    "After excising graft, measure mass on a tared scale that is accurate to at least 0.01 grams.\nCalculate the volume of the fat graft using the measured mass value and the average density of human fat (0.9 g/ml) as a conversion rate.\nCompare calculated volume of fat graft to that obtained using micro-CT.\nFat grafts can be processed for histology or further analysis if needed.\nSubscription Required.
