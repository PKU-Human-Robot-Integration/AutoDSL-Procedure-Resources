    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Slice culture preparation, plasmid preparation, and electroporation are also detailed in our previously published methods and can be referred to for additional information10.\n1. Slice culture preparation\nPrepare mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as previously described11, using postnatal 6- to 7-day old mice of either sex.\n\t\nPrepare dissection media for organotypic slice culture consisting of (in mM): 238 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, and 11 glucose in deionized water, then gas with 5% CO2/95% O2 to a pH of 7.4.\nPrepare organotypic slice culture media consisting of: 78.8% (v/v) Minimum Essential Medium Eagle, 20% (v/v) horse serum, 17.9 mM NaHCO3, 26.6 mM glucose, 2 M CaCl2, 2 M MgSO4, 30 mM HEPES, insulin (1 µg/mL), and 0.06 mM ascorbic acid, pH adjusted to 7.3. Adjust the osmolarity to 310-330 osmol using an osmometer.\nDissect hippocampi out from the whole brain by using two spatulas, and slice (400 µm) using a tissue chopper. Separate slices by using two forceps and transfer to 30 mm cell culture inserts in a 6 well plate filled with culture media (950 µL) underneath the inserts.\nStore organotypic slice cultures in a tissue culture incubator (35°C, 5% CO2) and change the slice culture media every two days.\n2. Plasmid preparation\nPrepare the plasmid for the gene of interest.\n\t\nSubclone enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene into a pCAG vector.\nPurify pCAG-EGFP plasmid with an endotoxin-free purification kit and dissolve in an internal solution that consists of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 140 mM K-methanesulfonate, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH (plasmid concentration: 0.1 µg/µL).\n3. Glass pipette preparation",
    "Pull borosilicate glass pipettes (4.5 – 8 MΩ) on a micropipette puller (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: The glass pipettes used for whole-cell patch clamp recordings are ideal for electroporation.\nBake glass pipettes overnight at 200°C to sterilize.\nCheck the size of the pipette tip under a dissection microscope to approximate the electrical resistance.\n\t\nOptional:Verify pipette resistance by attaching the pipette to the electroporation electrode and use the micromanipulator to maneuver the pipette tip into filter-sterilized artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4 and 11 glucose in deionized water, gassed with 5% CO2/95% O2 to a pH of 7.4. Confirm the actual resistance using the readout on the electroporator.\n\t\tNOTE: The sharper the pipette tip, the larger the electrical resistance. The pipette resistance should be below 10 MΩ. Glass pipettes with high pipette resistance (Figure 1B) often clog at the tip during repeated electroporation.\n4. Electroporation rig setup\nInstall the electroporator to a standard whole-cell electrophysiology rig, equipped with an upright microscope mounted on a shifting table with a micromanipulator and peristaltic pump.\nInstall the headstage of the electroporator onto a micromanipulator and connect a pair of speakers to the electroporator. Connect the electroporator to a foot pedal which can be used to send a pulse when ready.\n\tNOTE: The speakers emit a tone when turned on, which is an indicator of the electrical resistance at the electrode. This makes it possible to determine relative changes in resistance without pulling attention away from the procedure.\n5. Electroporation preparation\nTransfer slice culture inserts from 6 well plates to 3 cm Petri dishes loaded with 900 µL of culture media and store in a tabletop CO2 incubator until ready to perform electroporation.",
    "Preincubate fresh culture inserts with slice culture media (1 mL) for at least 30 min in a 3.5 cm Petri dish to culture slices after electroporation.\nClean and prepare the rig for electroporation.\n\t\nPerfuse the lines with 10% bleach for 5 min to sterilize the tubing and chamber prior to beginning the experiment for the day.\nPerfuse the lines with deionized autoclaved water for at least 30 min to rinse completely.\nPerfuse the lines with filter-sterilized aCSF containing 0.001 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX).\n\t\tNOTE: TTX minimizes cellular toxicity and death due to overexcitation of interneurons10.\nSet the electroporator’s pulse parameters: amplitude of –5 V, square pulse, train of 500 ms, frequency of 50 Hz, and a pulse width of 500 µs.\nFill glass pipette with 5 µL of plasmid-containing internal solution.\n\t\nRemove any trapped air bubbles from the pipette tip by flicking and gently tapping the tip multiple times.\nCheck the tip for damage by visualizing it under a dissection microscope or by repeating step 3.3.1 to check the pipette resistance.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tip is damaged, the glass pipette must be discarded, and this step must be repeated with a new glass pipette previously prepared in step 3.\nSecurely attach the pipette tip to the electrode and turn the speakers on. Record the readout (the pipette’s resistance) of the electroporator when the tip has made contact with the aCSF medium.\nCut the culture insert membrane using a sharp blade and isolate one slice culture. Carefully transfer the slice culture to the electroporation chamber by using sharp angled forceps and fix its position with a slice anchor.\n\t\nDo not keep the slice culture outside of the incubator for more than 30 min at a time to prevent side effects such as changes in neuronal health or function12.",
    "6. Electroporate cells of interest\nApply positive pressure to the pipette with mouth or by using a 1 mL syringe (0.2 - 0.5 mL pressure) attached to the tubing.\nUse the micromanipulator’s 3-dimensional knob controls to maneuver the pipette tip near the surface of the slice culture.\nChoose a target cell and approach it, keeping the positive pressure applied until a dimple forms on the cell surface, visible on the microscope.\nPerform pressure cycles.\n\t\nQuickly apply mild negative pressure by mouth so that a loose seal forms between the pipette tip and the plasma membrane, indicated visually by the membrane going up into the pipette tip somewhat. Observe an increase (~2.5x the initial resistance) in pipette resistance by listening for an increase in tone coming from the speakers. Quickly re-apply positive pressure so that the dimple re-forms.\nImmediately complete at least two more pressure cycles without pausing, then hold negative pressure for 1 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Pausing between cycles, applying too much pressure, or holding the negative pressure for too long can cause significant cell damage and possibly cause the cell to die during electroporation.\nQuickly pulse the electroporator once using the foot pedal when the tone from the speakers reaches a stable apex in pitch, indicating peak electrical resistance. Do not wait at the peak resistance for more than 1 s before sending the pulse.\n\tNOTE: We have observed no off-target electroporation when using this protocol10. Only the cells in contact with the glass pipette during pressure cycles were transfected. Positioning the pipette near other neurons does not result in gene transfection.\nGently retract the pipette approximately 100 µm from the cell without applying pressure.\nRe-apply positive pressure, verifying that the resistance is similar to the recorded readout in step 5.5, then approach the next cell.",
    "Remove potential clogs, indicated visually or by a significantly increased (>15% higher) pipette resistance after electroporation, by applying positive pressure.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is no visible clog and the resistance is still significantly higher, discard the pipette and use a new one. On an average, a pipette can be used for up to 20 electroporation events if the user is careful10.\nAfter electroporation, transfer the slice culture onto a fresh culture insert, and incubate at 35°C in the incubator for up to 3 days.\n7. Fixation, staining and imaging of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures\nFix electroporated organotypic slice cultures 2 – 3 days after transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) for 1.5 h at room temperature.\nRemove fixative and incubate slices in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (1x PB) for 2 h.\nPlace slices on a slide glass and freeze them by putting the slide glass on top of crushed dry ice. Thaw the slices at room temperature and transfer them to a 6 well plate filled with 1x PBS.\nStain the slices with mouse anti-GFP and rabbit anti-RFP antibodies in GDB buffer (0.1% gelatin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 450 mM NaCl, and 32% 1x PB, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature.\nWash slices with 1x PBS three times at room temperature for 10 min each wash.\nIncubate slices with anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody and anti-rabbit Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody in GDB buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Incubate slices with DAPI (4 µg/mL) in 1x PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash slices with 1x PBS three times at room temperature for 3 min each wash.\nMount slices on glass slides using mounting medium and perform fluorescence imaging.",
