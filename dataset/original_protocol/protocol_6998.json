    "Safety note: Initial steps in the preparation of CC use concentrated mineral acid (HCl). Wearing eye protection device and gloves and following other safety measures are necessary. Perform the steps involving concentrated acid either in a fume hood or in a well-ventilated area. Preparation of CC and CFS using the LCCM based filtration apparatusA1. Preparation of CC Weigh 10 g of shrimp chitin powder in a 250 ml glass beaker and mix it with 100 ml of 37% w/w HCl. Mix it slowly but thoroughly using a glass rod. Make sure there are no clumps of chitin powder. A very thick slurry will form, which slowly turns brown.Transfer the beaker into a plastic tray filled with chilled water or ice. This will reduce the heat generated due to the addition of the concentrated acid.Keep mixing the slurry every 5 min with the glass rod for 30 min.The slurry will become noticeably less viscous during the final stages of this process.After the acid hydrolysis step, slowly mix the acid slurry with 2 L of chilled distilled water with concomitant mixing. Use a magnetic stirrer for this step. A white fluffy substance will immediately form. Let this suspension mix for at least 15-20 min. Longer mixing times improve the homogeneity of the suspension.Assemble the LCCM based filtration apparatus as depicted in Figure 1A and Video 1. A single layer of the LCCM is enough to filter the CC. Use rubber bands to tightly hold the LCCM in place. Ensure that most of the surface of the perforated plate of the funnel is in contact with the LCCM. Place the filtration apparatus inside a tray to collect any liquids that may drip from the LCCM due to wicking.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4176/bioprotoc-11-19-4176-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "(B) Cell free supernatant (CFS). A piece of LCCM is taken from an old laboratory coat.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Assembling the LCCM based filtration apparatus and preparation of CC Slowly pour the acidic CC suspension into the Buchner funnel. This solution is still considerably acidic at this stage. Exercise caution while handling.A clear filtrate will collect in the Buchner flask, and CC is trapped in the LCCM. A vacuum pump may optionally be used to expedite the process.Decant all of the suspension into the funnel. Allow water to drain from the thick CC paste trapped in the LCCM. This may take 30-45 min without a vacuum pump.Carefully remove the rubber bands from the filtration apparatus and remove the LCCM from the funnel. Keep the LCCM on a flat surface. Scrape and transfer all of the thick CC paste into a 2 L beaker filled with distilled water. Use a magnetic stirrer and mix this suspension for 15-20 min.Wash the LCCM in tap water and dry it if you intend to reuse it. The drying step may be avoided, but in our experience, it considerably improves the filtration rate. Reassemble the filtration apparatus as per step 6 and repeat the filtration process (Steps 7-11).This process must be repeated until the pH of the CC slurry is near neutral. Usually, 3-5 repetitions of the filtration process are required to get near neutral cake. The number of repetitions can be reduced by allowing more time for the water to drain from CC paste (Step 9). Each filtration cycle takes about 2 h to complete.Collect the CC paste and sterilize it in an autoclave or a pressure cooker at 121°C for 15min. Use steam indicator tape to validate the sterilization process.Store the sterilized CC at 4°C until use in a tightly closed container.",
    "Under this condition, the product can be stored for at least 6 months.A2. Preparation of CFS This procedure is best suited for fungi and actinomycetes that exhibit pellet growth.Sterilize the LCCM and conical flask cap in an autoclave or pressure cooker at 121°C for 15 min. Sterilize a conical flask and a glass funnel in a hot air oven at 170°C for 45 min. Use appropriate indicator tapes/strips to validate the sterilization process.Assemble the CFS filtration apparatus as depicted in Figure 1B under sterile conditions inside a laminar flow chamber. Use sterile tweezers to push the LCCM into the funnel.The use of rubber bands for securing the LCCM to the funnel is not required.A liquid culture of Streptomyces rimosus AFM-1 grown in colloidal chitin mineral salts medium (CCMS) was used in this study. The culture exhibited pellet growth. Pour the contents of the fermented broth into the funnel wrapped in LCCM. Wait for the liquid in the funnel to filter into the flask before topping it up.Close the glass flask with the cap and store at 4 °C until further use.Either collect or dispose of the cell mass as per requirement. Decontaminate the cell mass and LCCM before disposal or cleaning, respectively.Extraction and plate assay of laminarinase from Streptomyces rimosus AFM-1B1. AS precipitation Use powdered AS if available, or else grind the granules to a fine consistency using a mortar and pestle. Powdered AS is easy to dissolve in the CFS.Mixing of AS with CFS should be performed at 4°C to avoid denaturation of proteins. Use crushed ice if cold room facility is not available.Weigh the required amount of powdered AS. Add small portions to the CFS. Use a magnetic stirrer at low speed for mixing. Ensure that the previously added portion is completely dissolved before adding the next.",
    "High mixing speed or large portions of AS cause frothing and concomitant loss of proteins.Continue stirring the CFS at cold temperature for at least 30 min.Centrifuge at 4,032 × g for 30 min to pellet the precipitated proteins. The centrifugation parameters must be optimized for different proteins.Decant the supernatant and dissolve the protein pellet in a small volume of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) or any other buffer system of your choice. The enzyme content of this solution can be directly analyzed by laminarin-infused agarose plate assay.Similar precipitation experiments can be performed with different concentrations of AS (viz. 30-90% saturation). Such experiments can be used to optimize the AS saturation needed for precipitation while simultaneously reducing the levels of contaminating proteins (Figure 2).B2. Testing enzyme solutions using laminarin infused agarose plate with OFB staining Prepare a solution of 0.8% agarose and 0.15% laminarin in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) by melting the solution in a microwave oven and pour into a clean Petri dish. Wait for the gel to solidify.Using a cork borer, cut 6 mm diameter wells in the agarose gel.Pour 20-50 µl of laminarinase enzyme or AS precipitated samples into the wells. Use the same volume of either plain buffer or heat-inactivated enzyme solution as a negative control. Refer to the notes section for further instructions.Place the Petri dish in an incubator set at 37°C. Standardize incubation time and temperature for your application before running the full-scale experiments.Meanwhile, prepare a 0.15% solution of OFB Tinopal CBS-X in distilled water. Prepare this solution fresh in a container protected from light.After the incubation time of 4 h, flood the surface of the agarose gel with the OFB solution. Incubate the plate for 15 min in the dark.",
    "Discard the OFB solution and destain once with distilled water for 20 min.Observe the Petri dish under 365 nm UV light (Figure 2A and 2B). An antibiotic zonescale or a calibrated scale ruler is recommended for measuring the zones of hydrolysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4176/bioprotoc-11-19-4176-g002.jpgFigure 2.

(C) A suggestive precipitation protocol for improved selectivity.Determination of average Feret’s pore diameter of LCCM (see Video 2)Place the graticule in the eyepiece of a microscope as per the manufacture’s recommendation.Place the stage micrometer in the microscope and focus using 4× objective.Align the markings on micrometer and the graticule. Take a picture (P1). This picture will be used for ‘define scale’ function of ImageJ software.Remove the stage micrometer and carefully place a piece of LCCM without disturbing the focus settings.Nudge the LCCM to bring it into sharp focus. Take a picture with the LCCM in focus (P2). This picture will be used to measure the average Feret’s pore diameter in the LCCM.Download the latest Java runtime environment (JRE) and install.Download Fiji software and unpack the zip file (Rueden et al., 2017). This software is provided as a portable application and hence installing is not necessary.Double click on the ImageJ application file located inside the unpacked file folder.The ‘Analyze’ menu is important for this work. Most of the functions used here are under this menu (viz. ‘Set scale’ and ‘Measure’).Open P1 in ImageJ. Select straight line tool.",
    "Draw a line from the left-hand end of the micrometer markings to where the lines on the stage micrometer and graticule align with each other (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4176/bioprotoc-11-19-4176-g003.jpgFigure 3. Use of ImageJ for the determination of Feret’s average pore diameter. (A) Drawing a straight line in ImageJ. Stage micrometer and eyepiece graticule are aligned with each other. (B) Setting the measurement scale (‘set scale’ function). Count the number of markings on the stage micrometer that align with the markings on the eyepiece graticule. (C) Selecting a pore in LCCM using the oval selection tool. (D) The ‘Results’ window of ImageJ. Note the dimensional parameters of the selected area.Note the number of markings in the stage micrometer that align with the graticule markings. For example, in Figure 3A, it is at the third marking of stage micrometer, which is equivalent to 300 μm.Open the ‘set scale’ option and input 300 in the ‘known distance’ menu. Type ‘um’ in the ‘unit of length’ menu. ImageJ will recognize this as μm. Click the ‘global’ check box and press OK (Figure 3B).ImageJ is now calibrated to perform measurement operations. Open P2 without exiting the software.Select the oval or freehand selection tool. Select a pore in P2 (Figure 3C).Click on ‘measure’ option. A new ‘Results’ window will open, which includes all the dimensional parameters of the selected area in P2 (Figure 3D).Note down the Feret’s diameter.Select another pore and repeat Steps 14-16. Analyze as many pores in P2 per requirement and tabulate the results. Calculate the average value. This will be the average Feret’s pore diameter of LCCM.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Determination of average Feret’s pore diameter using ImageJ tool"
