    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThin section, transmission electron microscopy\nTiming: >3 days\nOptiPrep purified virus and VLPs are bound to target host cells at entry non-permissive temperatures. For HIV, temperatures below 22°C do not support efficient fusion and cell entry. Samples are immobilized on a plastic support (Thermanox) and fixed for EM imaging.\nPlace 10–15 mL of cell suspension into a 15 mL tube.\nStand the tube in the incubator and allow cells to settle by gravity.\nNote: This should take approximately 45–60 minutes.\nCarefully remove the media and unsettled cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet very gently with 5 mL prewarmed DPBS and allow to settle by gravity.\nCarefully remove the DPBS and unsettled cells and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL prewarmed DPBS.\nTransfer the cells to a 1.5 mL conical screw cap tube.\nPlace at 37°C until needed, allowing the cells to settle during this period.\nWhilst the cells are settling in the 1.5 mL tube, prepare the virus or VLPs for the assay. This may include a PNGase F treated control.\nNote: PNGase F cleaves N-linked glycans from glycoproteins between the innermost N-Acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides. Other glycosidase enzymes may be appropriate for your experiment.\nIn a total reaction volume of 10 μL, treat with 450 U PNGase F enzyme in the manufacturer’s recommended glycobuffer 2[href=https://www.neb.com/en-au/protocols/2014/07/31/pngase-f-protocol].\nIncubate the PNGase F treated samples at 37°C for 1 h. For the untreated control, set up the equivalent reaction in glycobuffer 2, without the addition of enzyme.\nWhilst the cells are settling and virus/VLP samples are being treated with PNGase F freshly prepare the Thermanox supports.",
    "Using clean scissors, cut the Thermanox supports into rectangle shapes with the top right-hand corner clipped (similar in shape and size of small mobile phone sim-card). When working with the supports, position the cut corner in the top right position to assist in orientation of the support and sample in downstream processes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3070-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cartoon schematic of sample preparation for TEM\nUsing a 1.5 mm biopsy punch, gently score a circle shape into the surface of the support.\nUsing forceps, clean the Thermanox supports by submerging into 100% ethanol and allowing to airdry.\nPlace the clean and dry supports onto filter paper inside a petri dish, scored side up. Pipette a 5–10 μL droplet of poly-L-lysine (1 mg/mL) into each scored circle and allow to sit for 30 min. Monitor the droplets to ensure that they do not evaporate too quickly.\nUsing lint free tissues (such as Kimwipes (Kimtech Science)) wick off the excess poly-L-lysine and allow the supports to air dry at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20–30 min.\nNote: Thermanox supports can be made up to 24 hours in advance and stored in a closed disposable petri dish at 4°C. Always store the supports, poly-L-lysine side up.\nPrior to combining the cells with virus or VLPs, incubate both tubes at 4°C for at least 10–15 min. From this point forward, place all tubes on ice to maintain entry non-permissive temperatures.\nPrepare a 24-well tissue culture plate by pipetting ∼ 1.5 mL 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS into the appropriate number of wells.\nCarefully remove all but 100 μL of the DPBS from above the settled cells from step 5. Very gently pipette the cell pellet to resuspend the cells.",
    "Transfer 10 μL of cell suspension to the chilled virus or VLP tubes. Very gently mix the cells and virus/VLP by pipetting the mixture 5 times.\nImmediately transfer approximately 3–5 μL of the mixture to the poly-L-lysine coated region of a Thermanox support (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAllow the sample to bind to the poly-L-lysine for 5–10 min, monitoring the droplets to ensure that they do not dry by evaporation.\nGently invert the Thermanox supports onto the 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (step 6) to fix the samples. Each Thermanox support should be fixed in it’s own well on the 24-well plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Samples are stored at 4°C until they can be processed for EM.\nTo process the Thermanox supports for EM, remove the supports from the glutaradehyde solution and place them sample side up in a 12-well culture dish. Using a Pelco Biowave, process the supports by washing in PBS twice for 40 s at 150 W, without vacuum.\nPost-fix the Thermanox supports in 1% osmium tetroxide for 12 min (2 min power on, 2 min power off, 2 min power on, then repeat the series) at 80 W under vacuum.\nDehydrate the samples through an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%) for 40 s at 150 W, without vacuum. Repeat the 100% ethanol step.\nAfter the final 100% ethanol step, infiltrate the sample with LX112 resin (50% ethanol: 50% resin x 2) for 3 min at 250 W, under vacuum.\nNote: The prepared LX112 resin mixture detailed in the materials and equipment section above can be stored indefinitely at ‒80°C. If the mixture is stored at ‒20°C, it should be stored for a maximum of 2 weeks.\nFill BEEM capsules (size 3) with resin and invert over marked sample area.",
    "Once polymerized, snap the BEEM capsules off the dish using pliers. Samples should now be at the surface of the resin block, with the scored circular imprint visible. Remove the BEEM capsules from the resin block prior to sectioning the samples.\nTrim the resin block to the region of the sample, as marked by the scored imprint.\nSection the blocks at 60–70 nm using an ultramicrotome with diamond knife.\nCollect the sections onto specimen grids.\nPost stain with 5% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol for 90 s. Rinse the grids three times in pure water, wicking the excess water away using filter paper.\nStain with Reynold’s lead citrate for 45 s followed by three washes with pure water, wicking the excess water away using filter paper.\nAllow the grids to air dry and then store in a grid box until the grids can be imaged.\nImage the grids using a TEM operated at 80 kV."
