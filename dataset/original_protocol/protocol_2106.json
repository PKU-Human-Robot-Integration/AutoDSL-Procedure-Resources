Thawing PBMCs too slowly may result in cell aggregation/cell clump formation, which may impact the number of recovered cells. We have found it acceptable to proceed in the occasional presence of minor clumps which generally resolve after overnight incubation.\nWash once with media to remove cryoprotectant.\nDilute thawed cells to 10 mL in T cell media in 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in 10 mL fresh T cell media.\nTransfer to vented T75 flask.\nAlternatives: Cell culture dishes or 6 well plates can also be used to culture PBMCs. However, vented T75 flasks are easier to handle and have lower chance of microbial contamination.\nCount cells and then dilute cells to a concentration of 2–4 × 106 / mL.\nAs a relatively small population, the Vγ9Vδ2 T cells will clearly expand better at a relatively higher PBMC density compared to similar approaches for other T cell types. Lower densities will be detrimental to expansion, while higher densities may be tolerable.\nAdd IL-2 to a final concentration of 5 ng/mL.\nUse a 1:100 dilution from working IL-2 stock.\nAdd HMBPP to a final concentration of 100 nM.",
    "Alternatives: In lieu of HMBPP, some groups have reported using bisphosphonate drugs such as zoledronate to expand the Vγ9Vδ2 T cells from PBMCs (Roelofs et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Zumwalde et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Nada et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). This is a lower cost alternative of indirectly activating BTN3A1 that likely produces similar Vγ9Vδ2 effector T cells. However, only a narrow range of bisphosphonate concentrations can be used due to higher compound toxicity relative to HMBPP.\nGrow cells in humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAfter 3 days, wash to remove HMBPP.\nTransfer to a 15 mL or 50 mL conical tube depending on culture volume.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate media using vacuum suction.\nAdd 10 mL of fresh T cell media. No need to disturb pellet.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend cell pellet in initial volume of fresh T cell media.\nAdd fresh IL-2 to 5 ng/mL.\nTransfer to a new vented T75 flask.\nAll of the cells are transferred.\nAt this stage, counting is not recommended.\nVisual inspection can be done, but it is not very informative. The Vγ9Vδ2 T cell population is small at this time point, and some death of other cell types is occurring.\nAt day 6 and 9 post stimulation, add fresh IL-2 to 5 ng/mL.",
    "Unlike αβ T cells, it is not usually necessary to add additional volume of media. It is not necessary to change or add media because the number of viable and proliferating Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is small (typically 1%–5% of T cell population) relative to the volume used, and the other cell types are not actively proliferating or are being killed by the Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. We have not found that media components other than IL-2 limit Vγ9Vδ2 T cell proliferation at this stage.\nOn day 12, cells are ready for purification.\nCritical: It is helpful to inspect cells at days 6 and 9. At these days, HMBPP-stimulated cells should have formed defined colonies of 10–1000 cells, whereas unstimulated cells (if used as a negative control, not always necessary) will only have some small colonies. This varies by donor. The colonies are usually visible by eye upon gentle shaking and look like healthy clumps. They can also be observed under a microscope. Prior to day 6, the total cell number may go down likely as a result of cytotoxicity caused by the Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against the other PBMCs.\nPause point: While we typically purify cells on day 12, it has successfully worked between days 10 and 17, giving some flexibility to the purification and subsequent functional assays. For most consistent results, keep the day constant.\nPurification of effector Vγ9Vδ2 T cells\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section will describe how to purify the expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells from any other PBMCs still remaining in the flask, such as resting αβ T cells. This section generally follows the recommendations of Miltenyi Biotec with some modifications. For example, our typical centrifugation protocol of 3 min at 600 rcf works fine instead of the recommended 10-min spins, saving prep time.",
    "Collect all HMBPP expanded cells.\nTransfer cells to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate media using vacuum suction.\nResuspend in 80 μL of cold MACS buffer.\nShould produce a very dense-looking cell suspension.\nThe kit claims up to 1 × 107 PBMCs can be used in one prep. Since this is negative selection, the non- Vγ9Vδ2 T cells will be removed by binding to antibodies. Typically, the expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells have killed many of the other cells, so there are not that many cells left to remove with the cocktail.\nAdd 20 μL biotin-antibody cocktail from TCR γ/δ+ T Cell Iso Kit, human.\nMix by gentle flicking.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nUsually we just put the tube into the refrigerator.\nWash cells.\nAdd 900 μL of cold MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in 80 μL MACS buffer.\nAdd 20 μL magnetic beads.\nIncubate again for 15 min at 4°C.\nUsually we just put the tube into the refrigerator.\nWash cells.\nAdd 900 μL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in 500 μL MACS buffer.\nEquilibrate the magnetic column with 500 μL of cold MACS buffer.\nPass the 500 μL of cells through the magnetic column.\nElute 2 additional times with 500 μL cold MACS buffer.\nPellet the cells.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in 10 mL T cell media.\nCount cells.\nTypical yield should be 3–30 million effector cells depending on donor and strength of expansion.\nIf desired, assess for purity by flow cytometry staining with CD3 and γδ TCR antibodies. These cells should be >95% pure.",
    "Pause point: After purification, the cells can be used immediately or maintained in the incubator. Typically, we will purify the cells on day 12 and use for experiments on days 13–15. Longer times can be used provided cells are maintained in fresh media and IL-2.\nPause point: Alternatively, the cells can be frozen again in liquid nitrogen following the freezing procedure above for PBMCs. Typically, storage of 3 × 106 effector cells per 500 μL cryotube will be sufficient for 2 ELISA plates upon thawing.\nPhosphoantigen loading of K562 target cells\nTiming: 2 h, variable\nThis section will describe how to load the target cells with phosphoantigen in preparation for co-culture. We will describe the process for a 5-concentration 10-fold dose response of C-HMBPP from 1 × 10−4 to 1 × 10−8 M and of zoledronate from 1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−7 M in duplicate, with empty wells remaining in one 96-well plate for additional test compounds and unstimulated controls. We typically use one 96-well plate for up to 6 test compounds at 1 time point or 2 test compounds at 3 time points in addition to the positive controls. C-HMBPP and zoledronate are commercially available direct and indirect phosphoantigens, respectively, which will make excellent positive controls in this assay. We recommend against using HMBPP as a positive control in pulse experiments- because of its low cellular stability it does not perform well in pulse experiments such as this.\nDilute C-HMBPP and zoledronate (and test compounds if desired).\nBoth compounds are originally dissolved in water. Serial dilutions are made using T cell media for ease of mixing with cells.\nIn a strip of 200 μL tubes, prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of either compound, or both, as desired.",
    "Concentrations in the tubes should be 10× the final concentration, ranging from 1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−7 M for C-HMBPP and 1 × 10−2 to 1 × 10−6 M for zoledronate.\nVolume should be at least 20 μL per tube.\nCompounds will be diluted an additional 10-fold when mixed with cells in later step to achieve the desired final concentrations.\nNote: Some compounds with weak activity or low stability produce curves that fail to reach maximum stimulation. Therefore, a positive control such as zoledronate or C-HMBPP should be included in each experiment to allow definition of the maximal effect when plotting the curve.\nNote: Zoledronate is a highly potent bisphosphonate. Other bisphosphonate inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate synthase may be substituted with similar results, where the potency will correlate to the degree of enzyme inhibition.\nCount K562 cells.\nA minimum of 4000 cells / well of a 96 well plate or 3.84 × 105 cells / 96 well plate are needed for this protocol.\nWe recommend preparing 1.2 × 106 cells / plate to allow a bit extra, make calculations easier, and enable use of multichannel pipettors.\nThis protocol will prepare enough cells for 48 conditions of test compounds at various doses and times in duplicate (one 96 well plate).\n12 wells will be used for the C-HMBPP dose response and 12 for the zoledronate dose response including negative controls (solvent only) for each.\nAdditional wells should be reserved for unstimulated controls (e.g., media and cells only) and standards for ELISA (see section below).\nCollect K562 cells.\nTransfer 1.2 × 106 cells to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate media by vacuum suction.\nResuspend K562 cells in T cell media to 2 × 105 cells/mL.",
    "Add 6 mL of T cell media and resuspend by gentle pipetting to reach 2 × 105 cells/mL (1.2 × 106 cells in 6 mL).\nT cell media is used here instead of K562 cell media because these cells will ultimately be mixed with T cells. T cell media contains extra additives that are necessary for T cells and not K562 cells, but will not harm the K562 cells.\nAliquot 120 μL of cells to sterile 200 μL strip tubes.\nFor each dose response, we will need 6 tubes of cells.\nUsing a multichannel pipettor, add 13.3 μL test compound or solvent control.\nTypically, we make a 10× series of test compounds in media and add 13.3 μL to each tube for a final concentration of 1× compound in 133 μL of cells.\nMix gently.\nIncubate for 1 h or desired time at 37°C.\nCritical: Compounds may be incubated longer or shorter than 1 h, which depends on the expected uptake rate and potency of the specific test compound. In our hands, most of the compounds we have tested displayed time-dependent effect at exposure time with K562 cells between 15 min to 240 min. A pilot experiment at multiple time points is helpful in establishing the optimum time frame for each compound.\nNote: T cell media contains HEPES buffer which allows tubes to be closed during incubation of K562 cells with test compounds (no gas exchange required).\nDuring incubation, proceed to count and plate T cells as described in the next section.\nAfter incubation, wash treated K562 cells 3–5× with 120 μL of T cell media.\nCentrifuge strip tubes for 20 s at max speed with tabletop mini centrifuge (ours is fixed at 2000 rcf).",
    "Aspirate ∼95% of media. A small cell pellet should be visible. Do not disturb the cell pellet.\nUsing multichannel pipettor, add 120 μL of T cell media.\nRepeat steps 35a–35c a total of 3–5×.\nNote: Some phosphoantigens, such as HMBPP, are highly potent but poorly stable. With these compounds, a high wash number is essential to remove any impact of residual compound on the system. We have found a minimum of 5 washes is necessary to lower extracellular HMBPP or C-HMBPP levels to a non-impactful level (Nguyen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nResuspend in 120 μL of T cell media using multichannel pipettor and proceed to co-culture.\nCo-culture of loaded target cells with effector Vγ9Vδ2 T cells\nTiming: 1 h prep, 20 h incubation\nThis section will describe how to mix the loaded target cells with the effector T cells for co-culture with a final volume of 200 μL per well.\nLabel a 96 well plate.\nCount expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells.\nCollect 1.2 × 106 T cells per plate.\nTransfer cells to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 600 rcf at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate media using vacuum suction.\nResuspend in T cell media to 1 × 105 cells / mL.\nAdd 12 mL of T cell media to reach a cell concentration of 1 × 10 5 cells / mL (1.2 × 106 cells in 12 mL).\nResuspend by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 60 μL of fresh T cell media without cells to each well of a 96 well plate using a multichannel pipettor.\nFor a media control, add 200 μL of media in duplicate wells.\nFor co-culture conditions, 60 μL of media is first added before adding T cells and K562 cells to achieve the final volume of 200 μL (see below).",
    "Distribute 120 μL of T cells to each well using a multichannel pipettor.\nThis results in 12,000 T cells per well.\nWe routinely distribute 80 μL of media and 120 μL of T cells to duplicate wells as a T cell only control. This is a control for the presence of T cells in a total of 200 μL solution.\nIf loaded K562 cells are not ready to be added onto the plate, keep the plate at 37°C until ready.\nAdd 20 μL of loaded K562 cells (from step 36) to each well using a multichannel pipettor.\nThis results in 4,000 K562 cells per well.\nFinal effector: target cell ratio is 3:1 in final volume of 200 μL.\nWe routinely distribute 180 μL of media and 20 μL of loaded K562 cells to duplicate wells as a K562 cells only control.\nIncubate the cells for 20 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nELISA\nTiming: Overnight coating, then 5 h\nThis section will describe how to use ELISA to quantify the amount of interferon γ produced by the T cells. This section generally follows the recommendations of BioLegend with some modifications as noted.\nCoat ELISA plates one day prior to the ELISA experiments, usually the same day that the co-culture is established, so that the plate can coat while the cells are incubating overnight.\nDilute capture antibody 1:200 in 1× coating buffer (available with kit).\nThough the protocol suggests making 12 mL per plate, 10 mL is sufficient providing pipetting is accurate.\nNote: The BioLegend ELISA kit provides some extra reagents and can easily be stretched to use for 6 plates if all the recommended volumes are cut by 1/6.",
    "Using a multichannel pipettor, coat ELISA plate with 100 μL / well of capture antibody in buffer overnight. Coat additional 16 wells for standard curve and 6 wells for controls (media only, T cells only, and K562 cells only).\nIt is necessary to use a high protein binding plate that is designed for ELISA. A regular 96-well plate will not work.\nSeal with plate sealer and place in refrigerator.\nPeel off the plate sealer the next day, use force to shake out the liquid into the sink in one quick motion.\nWash 4 times with Wash Buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) in spray bottle, filling up each well to a consistent level, then shaking into the sink.\nNote: Attempting to wash ELISA plate wells with a multichannel pipettor or a robot is quite time consuming. We find that the spray bottle method works fastest without loss of quality. It can be made even faster by cutting the tip of the nozzle off the spray bottle. Do be careful to apply a similar volume and flow rate to the wash steps for each well.\nAfter last wash, pat to dryness on a layer of paper towels, with a firm upside-down pat against a hard surface, to remove all residual liquid.\nDilute assay diluent (blocking buffer) to 1× with PBS.\nPreparing 40 mL per plate should be sufficient for the rest of the steps.\nBlock plates with 200 μL of assay diluent. Seal the plate and incubate for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.\nWash 4 times and dry as above (steps 49 and 50).",
    "Prepare eight 2-fold serial dilutions of the top standard from kit. We generally make the top concentration 4-fold higher than what is described in the BioLegend protocol (from 2000 pg/mL to 15.6 pg/mL), recognizing that at the highest concentration this will lose linearity.\nNote: Due to potential for high interferon γ concentration, we routinely use higher concentrations of standards than recommended just in case we have underestimated the cytokine level. Because the assay loses linearity at high standard concentrations, we either drop the non-linear points from analysis or perform non-linear regression if necessary.\nTransfer 25 μL of media (the samples) from the assay plate to ELISA plate (avoid touching the bottom of the wells).\nNote: It is critical that the ELISA absorbance readings fall within the range of the standard curve and these cells should produce copious amounts of interferon γ. Therefore, we often reduce the sample volume. Because our sample volume is smaller than the standard curve volume, we adjust the final concentration to account for the difference.\nTransfer 100 μL / well of each standard to ELISA plate.\nIncubate sealed plate for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nWash 4 times and dry as above (steps 49 and 50).\nDilute detection antibody 1:200 in 1× assay diluent, preparing 10 mL total per plate.\nAdd 100 μL / well of detection antibody.\nIncubate sealed plate for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nWash 4 times and dry as above (steps 49 and 50).\nDilute avidin-HRP 1:1000 in 10 mL of 1× assay diluent.\nAdd 100 μL / well of avidin-HRP.\nIncubate sealed plate for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nWash 5 times and dry as above (steps 49 and 50).",
    "Mix TMB A and TMB B equally to form active TMB substrate solution, 10 mL total per plate.\nAdd 100 μL / well of detection reagent (TMB substrate solution).\nIncubate 7–10 min in dark. Positive wells should turn blue in color.\nAdd 100 μL / well of stop solution when ready. Positive wells should turn color from blue to yellow.\nIt is very important to add the stop solution, as the yellow color is detected by the plate reader.\nAddition of stop solution can be delayed if color is slow to develop.\nRead absorbance at 450 nm and 550 nm (background).\nManufacturer indicated to read background absorbance at 570 nm. However, due to the filter availability, we read background absorbance at 550 nm."
