    "1. Combinatorial Polymer Library Synthesis (Varying in Polymer Chemistry) - see Figure 1 for Robotic Setup\nDissolve each monomer in the appropriate solvent (concentration = 25 mg/ml) and load each into a 10cc gas tight syringe.\nAttach the solvent resistant lure lock capillary tubes to the end of each syringe.\nPlace the syringes on the syringe pumps (New Era Programmable Syringe Pumps) and lock into position.\nSet the linear actuators (Zaber) to the starting position.\nUsing ring stand clamps, position the end of both capillary tubes into the starting vial/well for monomer deposition.\nInitiate the LabVIEW program, which pumps variable volumes of each monomer into each well depending upon the desired copolymer composition. This is achieved in the program by instructing the Z-axis actuator to lower the capillary tubes into the vial/well and then each pump to dispense the desired volume. Next, the program instructs the Z-actuator to return to its home position and the X- and Y- actuators to move to the position of the next vial/well. This is carried out until each well has the desired volume of monomer deposited into it.\nFollowing monomer deposition, the multi-well or multi-vial monomer library is transferred to a pre-heated vacuum oven and incubated under vacuum for the duration of the condensation polymerization reaction. For CPH:SA synthesis the reaction is carried out at 180 °C, 0.3 torr, for 1.5 hr but these reaction conditions will vary between different polymer systems.\n2. Combinatorial Blank and Protein-loaded Polymer Nanoparticle and Film Library Fabrication - see Figure 1 for Robotic Setup",
    "The syringe in the first programmable syringe pump is filled with a solvent (blank library) or a solvent with protein dispersed in it (protein-loaded library) while the syringe in the second syringe pump is left empty. Tubes for nanoparticle fabrication in the adjacent sample holder are filled with the non-solvent (ratio of solvent to non-solvent is 1 to 100). For film fabrication an empty multi-well plate is utilized in place of the tubes in the adjacent sample holder.\nUsing the LabVIEW program, the solvent is deposited into all polymer vials/wells of the library (concentration = 20 mg/ml) and incubated for 1-5 min. An optional sonication step (30 s at 40 Hz) can be introduced to ensure complete polymer dissolution.\nNext, by initiating a separate LabVIEW program, the sample is withdrawn into the empty syringe, and deposited into its corresponding tube of non-solvent (nanoparticles) or empty well (films) in the adjacent sample holder.\nThis process is carried out for each composition of the discrete polymer library.\nThe nanoparticle or film library is then placed in a vacuum chamber for solvent and non-solvent removal (the nanoparticle library can also be recovered using vacuum filtration).\n3. High-throughput Protein Release Kinetics\nFor investigating high-throughput protein release kinetics from a polymer library, a 96 deep-welled (2 ml/well), polypropylene plate is modified such that the top 1/3 of the well wall in neighboring columns (ex: A and B, C and D, E and F, G and H) is removed to adjoin the wells. The protein-loaded films must be fabricated in or the nanoparticles transferred into this plate to perform high-throughput release kinetics studies. Protein-loaded nanoparticle or film samples must only be placed in one well of the adjoining columns (ex: A, C, E, and G). See Figure 4 for details.",
    "Following the transfer of the nanoparticles to the 96 deep-welled release plate, the particles are allowed to settle. PBS buffer (0.1 mM, pH 7.4) is slowly added to each sample well (columns A, C, E and G) and then to each neighboring well (columns B, D, F, and H) until the wells are full and the buffer is free flowing between adjoining wells. For nanoparticles, this process needs to be carried out with extra caution to ensure the particles remain at the bottom of the sample well (columns A, C, E and G) and not transferred into the adjoining release well (columns B, D, F, and H). In some cases, centrifugation is required to localize the nanoparticle samples at the bottom of the sample well (columns A, C, E and G).\nNext, the release plate is sealed with a lid and placed at the desired temperature (i.e. 37 °C) under agitation for the duration of the experiment.\nAt incremental time points (i.e. 0.04, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 24, and 30 days) the amount of released fluorochrome-conjugated protein is quantified using a 9,400 Typhoon Flatbed Fluorescent Scanner (GE Healthcare). The release plate is placed on the scanner surface, scanned using the appropriate excitation laser and emission filters, and the fluorescence intensity of the released protein in the release wells (columns B, D, F and H) is quantified (Image Quant). It is suggested that protein standards of known concentrations be included in the well plate for calculating protein quantity and accounting for fluorochrome quenching.\n4. Representative Results",
    "Upon fabrication of the polymer library, characterization has been carried out with 1H NMR, GPC, and FTIR to validate this combinatorial method1,7,8,11. Molecular weights range from 10,000-20,000 g/mol, polydispersity index ranges from 1.5-3.0, and chemical composition has been shown to be accurate and in agreement with conventional methods of polyanhydride synthesis12-15. Similarly, SEM images of the nanoparticles libraries showed similar surface morphology, size, and size distribution as that of conventionally fabricated nanoparticles2. Protein release kinetics from polyanhydride nanoparticles or films is carried out in a modified well plate as described previously1. The results revealed an approximate zero order release with or without a burst dependent upon protein loading and polymer chemistry (Figures 2 and 3) 1,12,14,16.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3882/3882fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
