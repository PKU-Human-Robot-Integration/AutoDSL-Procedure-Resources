    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol can be performed in one day or broken down into 2–3 days based on the number of samples and instrument availability (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Thawing, plating, and acquisition time will depend on the number of samples stained.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_1.csv\nThis protocol can be used for freshly isolated or cryopreserved PBMC. Antibodies should be titrated in fresh or cryopreserved cells, respectively, to ensure adequate resolution of the markers as detailed in the Antibody Titration section.\nCryopreserved PBMC Thawing and Resting\nTiming: ~0.5 h for cell thawing (variable depending on the number of samples) + 2–3 h of cell resting for same day staining, or ~18 h of cell resting for next day staining\nThis protocol details optimized steps for PBMC samples stored in liquid nitrogen to yield >90% viability and ensure high quality resolution. When using cryopreserved samples, cells should be thawed and rested with DNAse I to remove debris from dead cells and reduce background signal. The following steps should be taken for each individual sample.\nPrepare a waste container with ~5 mL of 10% bleach.\nAliquot 13 mL of warm complete R10 medium into an adequately labeled 15 mL conical tube, and place in water bath at 37°C.\nIf multiple aliquots are being used, adjust the volume of complete R10 medium added to the 15 mL conical tube to avoid overfilling it. Approximately 1 mL of frozen volume per cryotube is assumed.\nThaw cryopreserved PBMC sample in the water bath for 30–60 s (for ~1 mL of frozen volume) until just melted.\nQuickly decant into the 15 mL conical tube with warm medium. Carefully pipette out the remaining volume from the cryotube using a P1000 micropipette.\nMix well without creating bubbles. Count cells and record total number of viable cells and % viability.",
    "In a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare a 1:1 mixture of 10 μL of cell suspension and 10 μL of trypan blue.\nLoad 10 μL of the 1:1 mix into a cell counting slide.\nInsert slide into the automated cell counter and count.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 400 × g.\nCritical: The DMSO contained in the freezing medium is extremely toxic at 20°C–25°C (Fleming and Hubel, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Liseth et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). We recommend that after removing 10 μL for counting, the cells be immediately centrifuged in a 15 mL conical tube for washing. Cell counting can be performed during the centrifugation time.\nDecant and resuspend at 2 × 106/mL in complete R10 medium with 1 μL/mL of DNAse I.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a culture flask adequate for the volume. Rest in the incubator at 37°C 5% CO2 for 2–3 h on the same day of the stain, or ~18 h to stain the following day.\nPause Point: Cells can be rested for ~18 h to perform the cell staining the next day (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: All centrifugations should be performed at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Based on manufacturer’s instructions (Corning), suggested volumes to be used in culture flasks are: 2–7.5 mL for a 25 cm2 flask, 15–22.5 mL for a 75 cm2 flask, and 30–45 mL for a 150 cm2 flask. These volumes were calculated based on 0.2 to 0.3 mL medium for each square centimeter of culture vessel growth surface area.\nAlternatives: Cell staining can be performed in polystyrene 5 mL FACS tubes. The adjusted protocol for tubes is detailed under section “Quick protocol for FACS tubes.”\nPreparing Antibody Cocktails and Staining Reagents\nTiming: ~1–1.5 h",
    "This section indicates how to prepare the antibody cocktails in the appropriate staining buffers for the corresponding steps. If the staining is performed on the same day of sample thawing, the antibody cocktail preparation can be done during the incubation for cell resting. Examples are shown for 1, 10, and 20 tests.\nOne single stain compensation control will be prepared for each parameter measured in this protocol (full panel detailed on Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]), including their corresponding negative controls (mouse, rat, “plus;” detailed in step 20 at the end of this section). These panels require single stain compensation controls for 22 shared parameters, plus SLeX and CLA for each corresponding panel, and unstained negative controls.\nFor clear data analysis, placement of gates can be based on fluorescence minus one (FMO controls), particularly for markers with continuous expression, such as activation markers (i.e., Ki67, CD38, HLA-DR, etc.), or for the main markers of interest SLeX and CLA. The need to use FMOs in every single experiment or throughout different samples has been detailed elsewhere (McGowan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). FMOs may be used for initial panel setup and further selected based on user’s experience.\nNote: While handling fluorochrome marked antibodies, all steps should be performed at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nNote: Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set contains three components: Permeabilization buffer 10X, Fixation/Permeabilization concentrate and Fixation/Permeabilization diluent. The preparation and use of each component is detailed as needed in the corresponding step.\nRemove from the refrigerator all antibodies, FACS buffer, BD Brilliant Stain buffer and Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set and place inside the hood.\nRemove Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain stock solution from the freezer and place inside the hood.\nDetermine the number of necessary tests. Prepare an excess of 1–2 samples (for <11 samples) or 3–5 more (for >10 samples).",
    "Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain stock solution diluted 1:60 → 5 μL/test.\nStaining buffer: 1:2 mix of FACS buffer and BD Brilliant Stain buffer → 26.3 μL/test.\n1X eBioscience wash buffer: 94.5 μL/test for antibody dilution + 200 μL/test for washes → 294.5 μL/test.\nNote: Remember to account for FMOs.\nIn an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, or a 15 mL conical tube (depending on the necessary volume), prepare the chemokine receptor cocktail following the volumes indicated in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_2.csv\nStart by adding PBS.\nContinue by adding antibodies in order of decreasing volumes.\nOnce finished, vortex for 5 s and do a quick spin to collect the volume at the bottom of the tube.\nSet the chemokine receptor antibody cocktail aside in the dark inside the hood.\nIn an appropriately labeled 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, prepare the 1:60 dilution of the stock solution of Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain in PBS.\nMake sure that the Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain stock solution is fully thawed before pipetting the necessary volume.\nPlace the stock solution back in the freezer immediately.\nVortex for 5 s and follow by a quick spin to collect the volume at the bottom of the tube.\nSet the Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain dilution aside in the dark inside the hood.\nPrepare the appropriate amount of staining buffer by mixing 1:2 volume of FACS buffer and BD Brilliant Stain buffer, as indicated in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for SLeX staining, or Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for CLA staining.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_4.csv\nMix well with pipette without creating bubbles.\nSet the staining buffer aside in the dark inside the hood.",
    "In an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, or a 15 mL conical tube (depending on the necessary volume), prepare the extracellular antibody cocktail following the volumes indicated in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for SLeX staining, or Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for CLA staining.\nStart by adding staining buffer.\nContinue by adding antibodies in order of decreasing volumes.\nOnce finished, vortex for 5 s and follow by a quick spin to collect the volume at the bottom of the tube.\nSet the extracellular antibody cocktails aside in the dark inside the hood.\nIn appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, prepare the antibody cocktails for the relevant FMOs. Examples of cocktails from preparing FMOs for the antibody cocktail including CLA are shown in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]. FMOs suggested for activation markers and CLA. While critical for initial characterization of the panel, users can evaluate the need to include these in every subsequent experiment depending on the consistency of the signal for each marker.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_5.csv\nIn an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, or a 15 mL conical tube (depending on the necessary volume), prepare fresh Foxp3 fixation/permeabilization working solution by adding 1 part of Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization concentrate and 3 parts Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization diluent (1:4 dilution, calculate 100 μL/test). These reagents are components of the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set.\nMix well with pipette without making bubbles.\nSet aside in the hood.\nPrepare eBioscience 1X permeabilization buffer to be used for washes and intracellular antibody cocktail preparation (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]). The eBioscience 1X permeabilization buffer is a component of the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_6.csv\nLabel a 15 mL conical tube “1X permeabilization buffer”.\nPrepare the necessary volume of a 1:10 dilution of eBioscience 10X Permeabilization buffer in ddH2O.\nMix well with pipette without making bubbles.\nSet aside in the hood.",
    "In an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube or a 15 mL conical tube (depending on the necessary volume), prepare the intracellular antibody cocktail following the volumes indicated in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\nStart by adding 1X permeabilization buffer.\nContinue by adding antibodies in order of decreasing volumes.\nOnce finished, vortex for 5 s and follow by a quick spin to collect the volume at the bottom of the tube.\nSet the intracellular antibody cocktail aside in the dark inside the hood.\nCritical: The intracellular antibody cocktail must be prepared in 1X permeabilization buffer. The permeabilization of the cell membranes continues to occur during incubation and the use of this buffer is critical for the intracellular stain to work.\nOptional: The intracellular antibody cocktail can be prepared during the fixation/permeabilization incubation step (30 min) following the extracellular staining.\nPrepare compensation controls.\nLabel a 5 mL FACS tube for each corresponding antibody and fluorochrome.\nLabel one tube as negative for mouse antibodies.\nLabel one tube as negative for rat antibodies.\nAdd one drop of Anti-Rat Ig κ beads to the CXCR5 BB515 and CLA AF647 compensation tubes.\nAdd one drop of Anti-Mouse Ig or Anti-Rat Ig Negative Control beads to the corresponding negative control tubes.\nAdd one drop of Anti-Mouse Ig κ beads to all remaining tubes.\nAdd the corresponding antibody and mix well with pipette.\nAdd 0.5 μL of the antibody if the titer is 1:200 (0.5 μL/test) or higher.\nAdd the corresponding antibody volume if the dilution is lower than 1:200 ( <0.5 μL/test).\nIncubate in the dark at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Compensation tubes can be prepared at any time and incubated for ~10 min. In this protocol, we indicate to prepare them initially and incubate for the duration of the experiment.",
    "Note: The use of Plus beads (BDTM CompBead Plus Particles, anti-mouse Ig κ Cat# 560497 or anti-rat Ig κ Cat# 560499) may be necessary for certain parameters based on the flow cytometer configuration. An example of the use of Plus beads for compensation is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. The positive peak of the compensation control must be brighter than the brightest population. Given the brightness of the anti-human IFN- γ AF700 antibody, the use of Plus beads is required. As depicted in this example, the peak for the Plus beads in the AF700 channel fell above 104 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), and all events would be correctly compensated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The uncompensated area is indicated by an orange box. When using a normal compensation bead, the peak fell below 104 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). All events below the peak would be correctly compensated, but every event above the peak would not (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D, purple selection indicated uncompensated area). Note that the example provided was generated from a different experiment, as the panel detailed in this protocol does not call for the use of Plus beads for compensation. When using Plus beads in a compensation control, the corresponding unstained negative control for Plus beads should be prepared and acquired as well.\nPrepare the appropriate volume of a dilution of 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Calculate 200–300 μL/sample.\nNote: Account for all type of samples: unstained controls, FMO controls, compensation controls, and experimental samples.\nNote: 1% paraformaldehyde dilution is only necessary to perform final fixation of infectious samples. Further details on step 37 under \"Final fixation and acquisition.\"\nCritical: Before preparing the antibody cocktails, vortex the antibody vials for ~5 s and centrifuge for ~10 s to ensure the accuracy of the staining between experiments.",
    "Critical: Change tips for every new added antibody. Insert the tip into the antibody vial and collect volume slowly. Be mindful of collecting the appropriate antibody volume and not carrying extra antibody drops on the pipette tip.\nCritical: Compensation tubes must match the antibody-fluorochrome conjugates used in each individual panel. Due to the instability of tandem dyes, (such as brilliant violets, brilliant ultraviolets, PE-Cy5, PE-Cy7, etc), the compensation control should be prepared from the same vial/lot. It is not appropriate to use an unmatched antibody conjugate that shares the same dye, as this may not properly compensate the sample.\nOptional: FMOs for chemokine receptors or intracellular markers can be prepared in the same fashion as exemplified in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] for the extracellular antibody cocktail. Adjust the volumes from Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] (for the SLeX panel) or 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] accordingly.\nNote: The use of FMOs in different steps of the analyses is discussed under “Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes].”\nCell Counting and Plating for Staining\nTiming: 20 min (15 min of centrifugation time, ~5 min of sample preparation between steps); plating time will increase with the number of samples\nAfter resting, cells should be counted and plated at a similar number per test to ensure homogeneity in the stain. For a small number of samples, the stain can be performed in 5 mL polystyrene FACS tubes. The adjusted volumes for tubes are described in the “Brief Protocol for FACS tubes” section.\nNote: All steps are performed at 20°C–25°C.\nLabel a 15 mL conical tube with the corresponding sample ID.\nLabel a 96-well V-bottom plate with the sample IDs in the desired order.\nAfter incubation for resting on complete R10 medium with DNAse I, transfer the sample into the corresponding 15 mL conical tube and count.",

When performing the experiment on multiple samples, it is important to maintain a similar staining volume for all samples to ensure homogeneity in the stain.\nTransfer 100 μL of the cell suspension (in PBS) into the corresponding well in the 96-well V-bottom plate (3 × 106 cells/well).\nCentrifuge plate for 5 min at 400 × g.\nRemove the supernatant carefully using pipette by leaning the pipette tip at the edge of the well cone; as shown in step 4 of the “Antibody titration” section.\nExtracellular Staining\nTiming: 1 h (45 min of incubation time, 5 min of centrifugation time, ~10 min of sample preparation between steps)\nIn this section of the protocol, cells are stained sequentially for chemokine receptor expression, viability, and extracellular markers. These stains require different buffers, as well as incubation temperatures and times to achieve optimal resolution.\nCritical: While handling fluorochrome marked antibodies, all steps should be performed in the dark. All centrifugations should be performed at 20°C–25°C.\nImmediately after removing the supernatant, resuspend the cells with 45 μL/test of the chemokine receptor extracellular antibody cocktail (prepared in PBS as indicated in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], under Preparing Antibody Cocktails and Staining Reagents).\nMix well to fully resuspend the cell pellet, being mindful not to create bubbles.",

All centrifugations should be performed at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Critical: Fixation/Permeabilization should be done to the compensation controls as well to keep chemical changes to the fluorochromes consistent throughout the entire staining samples.\nImmediately after removing the supernatant from the wash, resuspend the cells with 100 μL/well of the Foxp3 fixation/permeabilization working solution (prepared as indicated in step 16, under Preparing Antibody Cocktails and Staining Reagents).\nMix well to fully resuspend the cell pellet, being mindful of not creating bubbles.\nCover the plate with the lid and incubate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nOptional: The intracellular antibody cocktail can be prepared during this incubation following Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], under Preparing Antibody Cocktails and Staining Reagents.\nWash with 100 μL/well of 1X permeabilization buffer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g.\nCarefully remove supernatant with the pipette tip.\nNote: Cells may be less visible after fixation/permeabilization.\nResuspend with 100 μL/well of the intracellular antibody cocktail (prepared in 1× permeabilization buffer as indicated in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6], under Preparing Antibody Cocktails and Staining Reagents in steps 17 and 18).\nMix well to fully resuspend the cell pellet, being mindful of not creating bubbles.\nCover the plate with the lid and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nWash with 100 μL/well of 1× permeabilization buffer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g.\nCarefully remove supernatant with the pipette tip.\nFinal Fixation and Acquisition\nTiming: 15 min for final fixation; for acquisition, calculate approximately 3 min per sample when acquiring on “Hi” speed for 200 μL of volume, or approximately 7 min when acquiring on “Lo” speed\nIn this section of the protocol, the cells and compensation controls are prepared for acquisition.\nNote: Depending on the type of sample, the concentration of paraformaldehyde may need to be adjusted to comply with biosafety protocols.",
    "Immediately after removing the supernatant from the wash, resuspend the cells in 200 μL of 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Mix well to fully resuspend the cell pellet, being mindful of not creating bubbles.\nAlternatives: At this point, cells will have already been fixed before performing the intracellular stain. For non-infectious samples, cells can be resuspended in 200 μL of PBS instead of PFA for acquisition. As this protocol was optimized to be used in HIV-infected samples, an extra fixation step is recommended for biosafety purposes.\nTransfer the volume into an appropriately labeled 1.2 mL microtiter tube or a 5 mL FACS tube as preferred.\nAdd 200–300 μL of a freshly made solution of 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS to all compensation controls.\nStore samples and compensation tubes in the dark at 4°C until acquisition.\nAcquire using a FACS Symphony A5 cytometer within 24 h of staining.\nNote: Although the most fixed/permeabilized samples will remain intact for up to 7 days if kept in the dark at 4°C, best results are obtained if acquired in the first 48 h, being 24 h the optimal time to acquisition. Scatter properties can change with extended storage in PFA.\nCritical: Aim for a similar number of acquired events within a selected gate (example: 100,000–200,000 viable lymphocytes) to yield comparable results across samples. Published data indicate that acquiring ~200,000 viable CD4+ T cells allows proper identification of SLeX+ or CLA+ populations (Colomb et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, the desired gating strategy should be taken into consideration to set the threshold of acquired events. A larger number of events should be acquired in relation to the levels of sub-gating performed in the analysis.\nNote: Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7] includes the full list of antibodies and dilutions used for the panels described in this protocol.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_231_7.csv",
