    "Overview\nSection 1 describes the preparation of pH responsive nanosensors and characterization of nanosensor response to pH using fluorescence spectrometry and their size using SEM.\nSection 2 describes the preparation of electrospun polymer scaffolds and characterization of their morphology and size using SEM. Section 2 also describes the preparation of self-reporting scaffolds which are electrospun scaffolds with the inclusion of the pH responsive nanosensors. The resulting self-reporting scaffolds are characterized by SEM to assess whether any morphological changes in the electrospun fibers has occurred. The fluorescence from the self-reporting scaffolds resulting from the incorporated nanosensors is assessed by confocal microscopy.\nSection 3 describes the culture of cells upon the electrospun scaffold and the self-reporting scaffold. The scaffolds are first sterilized in preparation for cell culture following which the scaffolds are assessed to determine whether sterilization and the culture of cells affect the fluorescence capability of the self-reporting scaffolds. The protocol also describes the delivery of nanosensors to cells that are cultured upon electrospun scaffolds. Lysotracker dye is used to ensure that nanosensors have not been taken into cellular acidic compartments.\n1. Preparation and Analysis of pH Responsive Sol-gel Nanosensors\n1.1 Preparation of pH Responsive Sol-gel Nanosensors\nNote: This preparation should be performed in a fume hood.\nPrepare the fluorophores for use within the pH nanosensors by dissolving 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester (FAM-SE) (1.5 mg) in dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 ml) in a round bottomed flask and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (TAMRA-SE) (1.5 mg) in DMF (1 ml) in another round bottomed flask. Add 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) (1.5 mL) to each flask and stir under a dry nitrogen atmosphere (21 °C) for 24 hr in the dark i.e. wrap the samples in foil.",
    "Add both of the above dyes (250 µl) to a mixture of ethanol (6 ml) and ammonium hydroxide (30 wt %, 4 ml) contained in a round-bottomed flask and stir for 1 hr (21 °C).\nSlowly add tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) (0.5 ml) to the mixture, continue stirring for a further 2 hr. The mixture will turn cloudy. The nanosensors can be collected by rotary evaporation. Nanosensors can be stored in a glass vial at 4 oC for future use.CAUTION: further handling of nanosensors in their dry form should be performed in a fume hood or in the case of weighing them the balance should be enclosed, for example in a Weighsafe.\n1.2 Nanosensor Response to pH\nPrepare Sørensen's phosphate buffer solutions ranging from pH 5.5-8.0 by mixing specific ratios of sodium phosphate monobasic (0.2 M) and sodium phosphate dibasic (0.2 M) stock solutions. Check the final pH using a pH meter. Make any minor adjustments to the pH using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (4 M) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) (2 M).\nSuspend the pH nanosensors in the pH buffers (5 mg/ml) by firstly holding the vessel containing the nanosensor solution on a vortex for 3 min then submerging the vessel in an ultrasonicator until the solution becomes cloudy (approximately 5 min). Repeat these steps to fully suspend the nanosensors in solution.\nPlace the first solution into an optical cuvette and use excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 568 nm for 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). Collect the emission wavelengths at 500-530 nm for FAM and 558-580 nm for TAMRA using a fluorescence spectrometer.\nChange the solutions in the optical cuvette so that the pH can be observed at different pH and continue collecting the emission spectra.",
    "Calculate the ratio of the emission maxima produced at each pH value to produce a calibration curve.\n1.3 SEM of Nanosensors\nPlace a sample of the nanosensors onto a carbon coated electron microscope stub and sputter coat with gold for 5 min under an argon atmosphere.\nObserve by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During imaging adjust the working distance, voltage and magnification to minimize electron charging (Figure 1).\n2. Preparation and Analysis of PLGA Scaffolds\n2.1 Electrospinning PLGA Scaffolds\nIn a fume hood dissolve poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) in dichloromethane (DCM) (20% (w/w)) with pyridinium formate (PF) (1% (w/w)). Place the solution into a 10 ml syringe with an 18 G blunt fill needle and securely fit to a syringe pump.\nDistance the needle tip 20 cm away from a 20 cm x 15 cm aluminum collecting plate.\nAttach the electrode of a high voltage power supply to the tip of the syringe and the earth to the aluminum collecting plate.\n\tCAUTION: Care should be taken as high voltage is used i.e. always turn the electrical supply off before handling any of the electrospinning equipment.\nDeliver the solution using a constant flow rate of 3.5 m/hr at 12 kV for 2 hr. Electrospinning using these conditions will give a scaffold depth of approximately 60 µm.\nLeave the scaffold in a fume hood for 24 hr to allow solvent residue to evaporate.\n2.2 Electrospinning pH Responsive PLGA Scaffolds\nPrepare scaffolds incorporating pH responsive nanosensors as described in section 2.1 but with the modification of adding nanosensors to the polymer solution (5 mg/ml). Suspend the nanosensors in the PLGA solution with the assistance of ultrasonication (approximately 5 min) prior to placing into a 10 mL syringe.\n2.3 SEM of PLGA Scaffold and pH Responsive Scaffold",
    "Place a sample of the PLGA scaffold or pH responsive scaffold onto a carbon coated electron microscope stub and proceed as described for SEM of nanosensors (Figure 1).\n2.4 Calibration of pH Responsive Scaffold\nPlace a sample of pH responsive scaffold into a 35 mm culture plate and immerse in appropriate buffer solutions.\nOn a confocal microscope use a 488 nm argon laser to excite the FAM and a 568 nm krypton laser to excite the TAMRA within the nanosensors. Observe the fluorescence emission for pH responsive scaffolds at 500-530 nm for FAM and 558-580 nm for TAMRA. (Figure 2). Use sequential scanning to avoid collection of excitation wavelengths.\n3. Cell Culture upon PLGA Scaffolds and pH Responsive PLGA Scaffolds\nNote: The following should be performed in a cell culture cabinet.\n3.1 Preparation of PLGA Scaffolds for Cell Culture\nCut the PLGA or pH responsive PLGA scaffolds into 2 cm2 pieces.\nSterilize scaffolds by irradiating with ultraviolet (UV) light at a distance of 8 cm for 15 min each side.\nTransfer the scaffolds to a 12-well culture plate and place a steel ring on top. Add a solution of Penicillin/Streptomycin (5% v/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the inside and outside of the steel ring, incubate overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2). Note the steel ring was manufactured at The University of Nottingham and has the following dimensions: 2 cm outer diameter, 1 cm inner diameter, 1 cm depth.\nRemove the sterilizing solution and wash with PBS.\nAdd cell culture media to the inside (500 µl) and outside (500 µl) of the steel ring, place in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) whilst preparing a cell suspension.\nPrepare a cell suspension and perform a cell count using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay.",
    "Create a cell suspension to achieve a cell number of 1 x 106 cells/ml.\nRemove media from the inside and outside of the steel ring.\nReplace with prewarmed cell culture media on the outside of the steel ring (1 m).\nAdd 300 µl of the cell suspension to the inside of the steel ring - rock plate backwards and forwards gently to distribute cells.\nPlace the cell culture plate into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) - cell attachment should have taken place within 24 hr, however continue culture for as long as the experiment requires - refreshing the media every 2-3 days.\n3.2 Nanosensor Delivery to Cells Cultured upon PLGA Scaffold\nSeed cells onto PLGA scaffold as described in section 3.1. For this study a blank PLGA scaffold (not containing nanosensors) was used due to overlap of fluorescence emission when imaging.\nPlace the cell seeded scaffold into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 72 hr to allow the cells to grow and migrate throughout the scaffold prior to nanosensor delivery.\nPrior to nanosensor delivery wash the cells with PBS and change the media from standard culture media to antibiotic and serum free media, incubate (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 hr. Note: standard culture media for 3T3 cells comprises of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% (v/v)), L-glutamine solution (2 mM), penicillin/streptomycin (1% (v/v)).\nDuring the incubation period prepare the nanosensor-liposome complex by briefly sonicating nanosensors (5 mg) with Optimem (50 µl) to create solution A.\nCreate solution B by adding Lipofectamine 2000 (5 µl) to Optimem (45 µl), incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd solution A to solution B, incubate at room temperature for 20 min to form solution C which is the nanosensor-liposome complex.",
    "Add solution C (100 µl) to cells and incubate (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 3 hr.\nRemove the cell seeded scaffolds from the incubator, aspirate media and wash twice with PBS before adding PBS (1 ml) to allow live cell visualization by confocal microscopy. Note: PBS was used in this protocol so that the phenol red indicator present in cell culture media did not cause autofluorescence and also because a calibration at different pH was being performed. However phenol red free media could be used for longer term analysis of cell cultures.\nImmerse the cell seeded scaffold into buffers of different pH and monitor the response of the nanosensors associated with the cells.\nMonitor the pHi by determining the ratio of the fluorescence intensities from FAM and TAMRA by observing fluorescence using confocal microscopy (Figure 3).\n3.3 Nanosensor Location within Mammalian Cells\nIncubate cells with nanosensors containing only the FAM dye as described in section 3.2 (this is because the fluorescence emission of TAMRA is in the same spectral region as the LysoTracker Red). Prepare these nanosensors as described in section 1.1 but with the omission of preparing and adding TAMRA.\nFollowing the nanosensor delivery period dilute LysoTracker Red stock solution to 50 nM.\nAdd an aliquot of the diluted solution (2 µl) to cells cultured upon PLGA scaffolds.\nIncubate the cells with LysoTracker Red for 1 hr (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nFollowing the incubation period remove the media and wash the cells twice with PBS (pH 7.4) before changing the media to PBS (pH 7.4) (2 ml) in preparation for viewing using confocal microscopy. Note: Phenol red free media could be used instead of PBS.",
    "Add the nuclear stain Draq5 to the PBS so the final concentration is 5 µM and incubate with the cells for 3 min (37 °C 5% CO2). It is not necessary to change the media following the incubation period with Draq5.\nUse a 488 nm argon laser to excite the FAM only nanosensors, a 568 nm krypton laser to excite the LysoTracker Red and 633 nm helium/neon laser to excite the Draq5 chromophore and observe fluorescence at 500-530 nm, 580-600 nm, 650-750 nm respectively (Figure 3). Use sequential scanning to avoid collection of excitation wavelengths.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
