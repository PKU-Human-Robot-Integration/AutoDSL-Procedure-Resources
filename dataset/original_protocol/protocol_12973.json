    "1. Establishment of Suspension Cell Cultures\nPrepare liquid BY-2 media by adding 4.43 g Linsmaier & Skoog Basal media, 30 g of sucrose, 200 mg KH2PO4, and 200 µg of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to 900 ml of distilled water and pH to 5.8 with 0.1 M KOH. After adjusting pH, adjust final volume to 1,000 ml with distilled water and autoclave. Media can be stored up to 2 weeks at 4 °C.\nInoculate a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml of liquid BY-2 media and a single piece of BY-2 callus (>1 cm in diameter) grown on solid BY-2 media (liquid BY-2 media with the addition of 1% agar) and seal with aluminum foil. Incubate culture at 28-30 °C with shaking for 5 days.\n\tNOTE: BY-2 callus is maintained on solid media for long term storage, as liquid cultures will rapidly overgrow. Culture volume can be adjusted as necessary, typically a 100 ml culture will be capable of loading thirty-three 6-well plates.\nTransfer 2 ml of log phase BY-2 culture to 98 ml of fresh BY-2 media and incubate for 5-7 days at 28-30 °C with shaking.\n\tNOTE: Sub-culturing of established liquid cultures can be carried out regularly using 1:100 dilutions of 5-7 day old cultures, rather than inoculation with callus.\nMix the culture thoroughly, as cells will rapidly settle, and transfer 6 ml of the cell culture to a 15 ml conical bottom centrifuge tube and let the cells settle for at least 10 min. Adjust the packed cell volume to 50% of the total volume by removing supernatant.\nShake tube by inverting and pipet 500 µl into each well of a 6-well plate for digestion. Use wide-bore pipets to transfer the cells at this stage, as they are dense and will clog standard pipet tips.",
    "2. Protoplast Isolation\nTurn on all components of the robotic system (Figure 1A) and open the plate mover task scheduling software. The task scheduling program integrates the microplate mover with the other equipment to enable transfer of plates between each piece of equipment.\nPrior to experimentation, define the technical specifications for labware (e.g., plates, lids) used in the protocol, as well as starting and ending positions for each piece of labware, in the plate mover software, as follows:\n\t\nClick Setup from the main tool bar in the plate mover software and select the Manage Container Types command.\nIf the container type is listed in the existing container type library, then select the appropriate container.\nIf the container type is not listed in the existing container type library then click Add to specify a new container type.\nAfter adding a new container type, insert the dimensions of the new container (height, width, stacking dimensions, and gripper offset) into the appropriate tabs and click Save.\n\t\t\nIf the correct dimensions are not available from the manufacturer, then accurately determine all dimensions to the nearest millimeter using calipers. Errors in measuring the container dimensions will result in failure of the plate mover.\nRepeat steps 2.2.2 through 2.2.4.1 for all container types that the plate mover will encounter. After completion of this step for all labware, it is necessary to define the start and end location for each container (step 2.2.6).\n\t\tNOTE: For this protocol the labware includes the 6-well plate, the deep-well plate, and the 96-well fluorescent screening plate.\nTo define the start and end position of each container, click the Start/End tab in a specific protocol. First, select the start position of each container. Next, check the box for Lidded/Unlidded at both the start and end position. Repeat for all containers.",
    "NOTE: If the container will be left on another piece of equipment (instead of the plate mover) the end location can be left blank.\nAt this stage manually load all plates into the starting position for the entire workflow. Load the 96-well fluorescent screening plates into Hotel 2, 6-well plates with BY-2 cells into Hotel 3, a 96 deep-well plate that will be used for transformation onto plate heater/chiller nest 2, and a 50 ml conical tube containing the enzyme solution (see Supplemental File, Section 1.2.2) onto the multi-mode dispenser.\n\t\nIf transformation will be carried out in the protocol, pre-load the 96 deep-well plate with 10 µl of plasmid DNA per well (1 µg/µl, A260/280 > 1.8) containing the OFP reporter construct and incubate on the plate heater/chiller at 4 °C. Each well will be used for a single transformation, thus the number of wells filled will depend on the experimental setup.\nLoad all supplies and plates on the automated liquid handling platform in the designated locations and define the position of each item in the automation control software (Figure 1B).\n\t\nLoad a 96-well plate preloaded with 200 µl of 40% PEG in MMg (0.4 M mannitol, 100 mM MgCl2, 4 mM MES, pH 5.7) in column 1, 200 µl of propidium iodide (PI, 1 µg/ml) in column 2, and 200 µl of ethanol in column 3 (nest 2), and a box of pipette tips in nest 8.\nTo define the location of the labware in the automated liquid handling platform's software, select Tools from the menu and click Labware Editor.\nSelect the type of labware from the pulldown menu or define a new labware type using the New Labware button.",
    "Define the position of each piece of labware selected by selecting the Main Protocol tab and clicking Configure Labware. Ensure that each piece of labware placed on the automated liquid handling platform is defined prior to running the protocol.\nTo trigger the automated protocols, click the Profile Explorer window and select the name of the protocol to be run (Protoplast Isolation, Cell Count, and PEG-mediated Transformation).\nClick Run to initialize all devices that will be used in the protocol.\nFinally, in the Work Explorer window, click Add Work Unit to verify all containers/labware in the system and begin the automated protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: Full descriptions of the automated protocols are contained in the Supplemental File.\n3. Establish Standard Curve for Cell Counts\nManually concentrate protoplasts at a concentration of 1 x 106 protoplasts/ml in a volume of 1 ml. Centrifuge protoplasts at 1,000 x g for 10 min, and remove supernatant.\nManually add 900 µl of 70% ethanol (maintained at 4 °C) to the protoplast pellet and re-suspend the pellet. Incubate for 10 min on ice to fix cells.\nAdd 100 µl of PI (1 µg/ml) to the protoplasts to label the nuclei and allow detection by the plate reader.\nLoad 80 µl of liquid BY-2 media into each column and row of the 96-well fluorescent screening plate starting at column 2.\nIn column 1 of a 96-well fluorescent screening plate, add 70 µl of protoplasts and 50 µl BY-2 media to each well in the column.\nPlace the plate in nest 6 of the automated liquid handling platform, and run a 2-fold serial dilution.",
    "To conduct a serial dilution on the automated liquid handling platform, click Launch Serial Dilution Wizard and adjust the transfer volume (60 µl), number of mixes and volume (2, 70 µl), initial wells (Column 1, Rows A-F), dilution wells (Columns 2-11, Rows A-F), and aspirate and dispense properties (0.5 mm from well bottom).\nAfter setting the parameters, save and run the protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: Since all protoplasts are labeled with PI (due to fixation of cells), the fluorescence is proportionate to the protoplast concentration.\nAfter the serial dilution is completed, remove the plate from nest 9 and insert into the plate reader and run the standard curve protocol in the plate reader software.\n\t\tNOTE: A standard curve will then be generated by comparing the fluorescence from PI (excitation 536 nm/emission 620 nm) in each well with the known protoplast concentration.\nUpon completion of the plate reader protocol, remove the plate and collect any transgenic cells for autoclaving or other de-vitalization procedures as defined in biosafety protocols'.\n4. Microscopic Analysis of Transformation\nRemove plate with transformed protoplasts (the product of Automated Protocol 3, Supplemental File) from Hotel 1 of the robotic system.\nTurn on inverted microscope, camera, and fluorescent lamp.\nSelect the 10X objective for initial focusing on the protoplasts, turn on the halogen lamp, and close the shutter for the fluorescent lamp.\nLoad plate onto microscopic system and focus on the protoplasts using brightfield.\nAfter focusing on protoplasts, turn off the halogen bulb and open the shutter for the fluorescent lamp.\nSelect the CY3/TRITC filter set for visualization of the pporRFP protein expressed by the transgenic protoplasts.\nScan each well to determine the number of protoplasts expressing the pporRFP fluorescent marker.\nCalculate the transformation efficiency as the total number of protoplasts expressing the fluorescent marker the total number of protoplasts.",
