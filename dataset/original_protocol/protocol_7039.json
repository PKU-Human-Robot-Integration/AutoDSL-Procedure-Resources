    "Ex-vivo brain sample preparationAnesthetize the mouse with chloral hydrate (intraperitoneal injection 100 mg/kg in sterile PBS).Transcardially perfuse the mouse with 35 ml of cold PBS/heparin (50 units/ml) solution followed by 35 ml of 10% formalin. The perfusion rate is approximately 12 ml/min for PBS and formalin, with good perfusion assessed by the liver changing color from dark red to brownish/grey and the animal carcass becoming stiff.Decapitate the mouse at the mid-cervical line (around C3-C4), making sure not to damage the spinal cord, and place the head in 50 ml 10% Formalin solution at 4°C for 24 h in a 50 ml conical tube.After 24 h post-fixation, replace the formalin with PBS. Samples can be stored at 4°C at this point until ready to be scanned.Replace the PBS solution with 50 ml of 2 mM gadodiamide solution in PBS.Store the sample at 4°C for one week for the gadodiamide to diffuse into the tissue.Trim the skin and muscle tissues but keep the skull and eyeballs intact (Figure 1A). Remove the mandible bone and the tongue.Place one brain in the barrel of a 5 ml syringe, with the nose facing the hub of the syringe, then place 2-3 small pieces of bent zip-tie at the bottom and back of the brain to properly fix the specimen within the syringe barrel (Figure 1A).Replacing the cap of the syringe with a loosely tied vacutainer, fill the syringe with perfluoropolyether (Fomblin®), insert the plunger, flip the syringe so that the hub points upward, and remove the cap.Place the syringe with its hub pointing upward in a vacuum chamber for 30 min to remove air bubbles (Figure 1B).",
    "Remove the syringe from the vacuum chamber, push out the remaining air and PBS in the barrel, and seal the cap of the syringe by tightening the vacutainer (Figure 1C).MR data acquisitionPlace the syringe horizontally in the animal holder for the cryogenic probe and adjust the sample position so that the dorsal part of the brain is as close to the cryogenic coil as possible to maximize sensitivity. Use tape to fix the syringe to the animal holder (Figure 1D).Insert the animal holder into the magnet under the cryogenic probe (Figure 1E).Acquire a pilot scan using the Bruker Localizer protocol. For any MRI studies, Localizer is the very first scan that acquires reference images of the subject in three orthogonal planes. The images of the resulting scan appear in the ‘geometry editor,’ where the first three viewports show the reference brain slices in axial, sagittal, and coronal orientations. Therefore, the Localizer provides a quick view of the specimen in the magnet (Figure 1F). Check whether the sample is in the most sensitive region of the cryogenic probe with no apparent tilt toward the left or right sides. Adjust the position of the subject and re-run the Localizer protocol prior to proceeding to the next step.Adjust the tuning and match of the cryogenic probe and acquire a map of the main magnetic field (B0 field) over the entire sample.Use the Bruker MapShim procedure to adjust shimming currents to achieve a relatively homogeneous B0 field. In brief, select the specific scan to calculate the shim. Then choose Map_shim from the setup tab and define the target volume of interest in cubic, cylinder, or ellipsoid shapes. Shift, resize or rotate the target volume in the geometry editor such that the volume covers the entire specimen.",
    "Run the scan to compute the optimum shim values in the target volume based on the B0 map measured in the previous step.Acquire high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (HARDI) of the whole mouse brain using a modified 3D gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence (Wu et al., 2013) (an alternative is the 3D multi-shot diffusion weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence provided by Bruker) and with the following imaging parameters:Echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR): 33/400 min.Number of non-diffusion weighted images (b0s): 2.Number of diffusion weighted images (DWIs): 60, auto-generated by the sequence.b-value: 5,000 s/mm2.Resolution: 100 µm isotropic.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4221/bioprotoc-11-22-4221-g001.jpgFigure 1. Preparation for MRI. A. Sample preparation: Remove the tissues outside of the skull carefully without damaging the eyeballs (top panel). Place the brain in a 5ml syringe with small pieces of zip-ties to fix its position (bottom panel). B-C. Remove air from the syringe: Connect the syringe to a loosely tied vacutainer filled with Fomblin® (shown in C) and place in the vacuum chamber (shown in B). Remove the vacutainer and turn on the vacuum for 30 min to remove air bubbles. Push out the remaining air after vacuum and seal the top by tightening the vacutainer. D. Place the sample in a manufacturer-made sample holder designed for the cryogenic probe. D’. A zoom-in view of the sample. E. Insert the sample holder into the magnet bore of the magnet. E’.
