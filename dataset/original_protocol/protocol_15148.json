    "All surgery is performed in accordance with guidelines set out by the United Kingdom's Home Office and the University of Edinburgh's Veterinary Services Department.\n1. Surgical Procedure Set-up Notes\nChange into clean surgical scrubs, gown, scrub cap and mask. Clean all surfaces of the operating room including equipment with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol.  \nPrior to surgery, autoclave all surgical supplies and instruments that will be used in the procedure. Sterile packs per operation should include: 3 drapes, gauze, cotton tip applicators, silicone sheeting and the surgical instruments, see the Table of Specific Surgical Materials and Tools and Figure 1. Weigh the rat and measure out the appropriate volume of buprenorphine (0.04 mg/kg) to be administered subcutaneously 1 hr before completing the procedure. Lay out; 3 x 1 ml syringes for subcutaneous fluid administration during surgery, 2 x 6-0 Vicryl sutures, 1 x 5-0 Ethilon sutures, a sterile marker with ruler and a 10-blade disposable scalpel, 4 - 5 pairs of sterile gloves and a hand-held cautery unit. \nPlace 4 x 10 ml sterile, 0.9% saline vials in a water bath warmed to 37 °C. This will be used for subcutaneous fluid replacement (1 ml/kg/hr) and to rinse the surgical site. Set up the homeothermic blanket, rectal probe, heat lamp, operating microscope and anesthetic rig. Turn on the laser and its software, set-up another anesthetic rig and place a heat pad underneath the black mat on which the animal will lay during the scan. \nUse male, Lewis rats weighing 250-300 g. House rats for 7 days with food and water ad libitum with 12 hr light-dark cycles before any surgery is performed. \n2. Anesthesia and Skin Preparation",
    "Place the rat in the anesthetic rig's induction chamber and administer 4% isoflurane with 1L/min O2 for 2-3 min to induce anesthesia. Remove the anesthetized rat from the chamber and place it supine on the clean, heated mat. Maintain isoflurane at 1.5% using a nose cone. Apply lacrilube or similar agent to prevent corneal abrasion during the procedure. Perform a foot-pad pinch test to ensure the animal is adequately anesthetized before proceeding. Repeat this last test before each major step in the procedure and adjust the inhalational anesthetic concentration accordingly.  \nClosely shave the anterior abdominal using an electric shaver so that the entire abdominal surface is exposed. Apply depilating cream for the duration recommended by the supplier. Remove the cream and thoroughly rinse the skin with warmed sterile saline to remove all traces of the cream. Apply 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol to the skin and allow to dry before proceeding. This is the standard skin preparation in our unit based on current evidence for surgical site infection.34 Please discuss with your Veterinary Department what is standard procedure in your unit before electing a skin preparation protocol. \nPlace 2 drapes either side of the rat and take care to keep them sterile. Put on sterile gloves and with the aid of an assistant open up the sterile packs. Place all the instruments on one drape and the sutures, gauze, cotton applicators, silicone sheeting and sterile marker pen with ruler on the other.",
    "Identify the midline using xiphisternum and the tail as reference points. Mark the midline. Measure 0.8 cm below the xiphisternum and mark this point. Draw a line perpendicular to the midline from this point. Taking the midline as the center of the flap mark out 1 cm and 2 cm to the left and the right of the midline. Draw vertical lines parallel to the midline from the points. Measure 4 cm below the original horizontal line and draw another parallel to it. Following these instructions a 4 x 4 cm flap divided into 4 equal strips is delineated (see Figure 2). \n3. Laser Doppler Imaging\nCarefully move the rat to the nose cone of the second anesthetic rig at the LDI scanner. Continue anesthesia at 1.5% isoflurane, 1L/min O2.  Turn on the laser and follow the manufacturer's instructions to start scanning. After saving the scanned file return the rat back to the first rig and re-insert the rectal probe of the homeothermic blanket using soft white paraffin as a lubricant. \n4. In situ TRAM flap - Myocutaneous Model of IRI\nRe-scrub hands and put on fresh sterile gloves. Cut out a 5 cm diameter circle in the center of the remaining sterile drape and place this over the exposed abdomen to create a draped sterile-field.    \nMake an incision down the left lateral marked edge (Figure 3A and B). Achieve hemostasis. Make similar incisions down the horizontal lines to the left of the midline. Achieve hemostasis.",
    "The fat overlying the left inferior rectus sheath should be visible. Using forceps and fine iris scissors carefully get underneath this fat. Take care not to damage the perforators coming through the left, anterior rectus sheath. The plane opened up by such dissection is that immediately above the anterior abdominal wall fascia. Continue dissecting in this plane around the demarcated margins. In the left iliac fossa lies the large, superficial circumflex iliac vessels- these can be tied or cauterized. Then extend the dissection medially with caution and only as far as the lateral margin of the left rectus muscle. There is an obvious color change at this point from pink to near white (Figure 3C). Carefully irrigate the area with sterile saline and check that hemostasis has been achieved before placing moist gauze over the area. \nRepeat the procedure on the contralateral side but this time extend to the linea alba (mid line). Take care to identify and cauterize all the musculocutaneous perforators arising in the center of the right rectus abdominis muscle (Figure 3D). If this is not done properly it can result in a postoperative hematoma and spurious results. Similarly achieve hemostasis, irrigate and place moist gauze over the raised flap.",
    "Return to the inferior margin of the left anterior rectus (Figure 3E and F). Cauterize the most inferior perforator seen. Proceed to cut a small (approx. 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm) window in the anterior rectus sheath using microscissors and pointed curved Graeffe forceps. Blunt dissect slowly down the lateral margin of the muscle until the muscle thins out but before the posterior sheath is breached. Then rotate the forceps and blunt dissect medially until the belly of the muscle is atop the curved edge of the forceps and the tips are free at the medial margin. Feed approximately 6 cm of 5-0 Ethilon into the jaws of the forceps and tie off the inferior rectus sheath. Upon completion of this step the myocutaneous flap is isolated on one dominant vessel- the deep superior epigastric vessels. Cover with a moist gauze.    \nCut the silicone sheeting into ovals with smooth corners, (Figure 3G). These should be large enough to cover most of the area exposed under the fasciocutaneous portions of the flap. However, caution must be taken to ensure that the skin edge can be closed without any tension and the medial curve of the oval may have to be paired back to prevent it impairing flow through the remaining perforators. These are then sutured in place with 6-0 Vicryl (Figure 3H). Cover with moist gauze.\nUsing simple interrupted 5-0 Ethilon sutures 'peg out' the flap to reduce heat and water loss (Figure 3I). Cover with a moist gauze.    \nExtend the wound superiorly to the left of the xiphisternum (Figure 3I). Suture this to the upper left quadrant to improve the field-of-view.",
    "Cut away any overlying fat to reveal the superior, left, anterior rectus sheath. Cut a small (0.6 cm x 0.6 cm) window in this sheath (Figure 3J). Extend the wound medially until a change in muscle fiber trajectory from vertical to oblique and consistency from tightly packed to loose fibrils is seen.    \nInsert the curved forceps carefully between these two muscles and open up a plane by blunt dissection. Carefully cut down only as far as the superior surface of these curved forceps cutting through the belly of the left rectus abdominis muscle to reveal the underlying deep, superior epigastric artery and vein (Figure 3K).\nUsing micro-instruments and high power on the operating microscope, carefully separate the artery and vein and strip off any surrounding fat.\nApply atraumatic Acland clamps to the artery and vein (B-1, \"V\" type) and start the timer to count down the 30 min ischemic period. Irrigate the clamped pedicle and cover with gauze. We did not employ vessel dilators such as verapamil or pabavarine but should vessel spasm be a problem, these drugs should be considered.\nAdminister the buprenorphine (0.04 mg/kg) and warmed, sterile saline (1 ml/kg/hr). \nStarting at the top left corner, suture the flap in place with 6-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures stopping and tying off at the xiphisternum. \nWhen the 30 min ischemic time is over, carefully remove the clamps and irrigate the pedicle with warmed saline. Check that flow has been re-established. Please note that this ischaemic time was stipulated by the UK Home Office authority. Researchers working in other authorities may be able to extend this time. Extending the ischemic time will likely lead to worse clinical outcome.",
    "Suture the cut edges of the rectus back in place with 6-0 Vicryl. Take care not to apply too much tension as this can lead to kinking of the vessels. \nComplete the subcutaneous suturing taking care to bury all knots below the skin (Figure 3K).\nClean the wound area and allow it to dry. Re-draw the zones on the flap.\nRe-scan the animal to obtain a postoperative image. \nRe-apply lacrilube to the animal's eyes and place in a warmed incubator (37 °C) for 1 hr to recover before returning to the husbandry unit.\n  \nCritical steps within the protocol\nThe crux of the procedure is in identifying the deep, superior epigastric vessels. This is shown clearly in the accompanying film. In brief, a window is cut in the anterior rectus sheath to expose the underlying muscle fibers which will be running longitudinally. By extending the superficial dissection of the anterior rectus sheath medially a change in muscle fiber trajectory is observed from longitudinal to oblique. Insert blunt ended, curved, Graeffe forceps (or similar) at the intersection of these two bundles of muscle fibers. Blunt dissect laterally. Cut down, using micro scissors, onto the upper surface of the curved forceps held in this plane between the muscle fiber bundles. On removal of the Graeffe forceps the deep, superior epigastric artery and vein will be observed at the midpoint of the rectus abdominis muscle body. Strip off the fat overlying the vessels using micro instruments and apply the clamps.",
    "The fasciocutaneous portions of the rat TRAM flap are thin enough to permit the flap to take as a full thickness skin graft. To prevent this and to ensure that this is a true model of IRI a thin, flexible silicon sheet is placed underneath the fasciocutaneous portions of the flap.35  This step has been adopted by other researchers undertaking rat TRAM models.17,21,25 \nRats chew through knots so make sure all sutures are subcuticular and all knots are buried. In carrying out meticulous suturing autocannabilism of flaps as reported by other researchers can be avoided. 24 \nFollowing administration of Buprenorphine reduce maintenance anesthesia to 1% Isoflurane (1L/min O2).Subscription Required.
