    "Preparation of a synchronized nematode populationSelect L4 larvae of each strain by using a dissecting stereomicroscope. Place 4-6 L4 larvae on a freshly Escherichia coli (OP50) seeded NGM plate (Figures 1A-1C). Use at least three plates for each nematode strain.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129004253_9824.jpgFigure 1. Caenorhabditis elegans. A. E. coli (OP50) seeded NGM plates on the base of a dissecting stereomicroscope. Bacterial lawn is visible on the surface of the agar. B. A mix population of C. elegans nematodes observed through the dissecting stereomicroscope. Nematodes leave tracks on the plate surface indicating their movements on the bacterial lawn. Scale bar = 1 mm. C. During development worms increase in size throughout four larval stages (L1, L2, L3 and L4). L4 hermaphrodite nematodes can be distinguished by the developing vulva (red arrowhead), which is a clear half circle in the center of the ventral side. Scale bar = 0.5 mm.Incubate the nematodes at the standard temperature of 20 °C.Four days later the plates contain mixed animals population.Synchronize nematodes by picking L4 larvae of each strain under a dissecting stereomicroscope and transfer them onto separate freshly E. coli (OP50) seeded plates (Figures 1A-1C).Add 20-25 L4 larvae per plate. For each experimental condition, use at least five plates.Preparation of nematodes samplesUse an eyebrow/eyelash hair and collect 50-100 adult animals in 50 μl of M9 buffer in a 1.5 ml tube (see Note 1). Use the same number of animals of each strain during sample preparation.Freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen.Store the samples at -80 °C until further analysis.Immerse frozen worms in boiling water for 15 min.Place the samples on ice for 5 min.Spin down samples at 14,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer sample supernatants into new 1.5 ml tubes.Dilute sample supernatants tenfold by adding water before measurement.",
    "Keep the samples on ice or store them at -20 °C.Preparation of working solutions (ATP standards and luciferase reagent)ATP standardsDissolve lyophilized ATP by adding the appropriate volume of distilled water to get final concentration of 10 mg/ml or 16.5 mM (see Note 2).Store ATP standard solution at -20 °C. ATP standard solutions are stable for at least one week.Dilute ATP standards by serial dilutions in the range of 10 to 1 x 10-4 µM. Prepare serial dilutions of one ATP standard solution using distilled water to generate the ATP standard curve.Note: Diluted ATP standards solutions are stable for 8 h at 4 °C. Store them at -20 °C for longer periods of time. Luciferase reagentDissolve lyophilized luciferase by adding 10 ml of distilled water.Incubate dissolved luciferase for 5 min at 4 °C.Gently swirl the bottle and mix for a homogeneous solution. Avoid shaking.Store luciferase reagent at -20 °C (see Note 3).Determination of ATP levelsAdd 100 μl of each sample or ATP standard in a 1.5 ml tube. Use a sample containing M9 buffer as blank (no ATP). For each sample or ATP standard, use at least 3 replicates.Add 100 μl luciferase reagent to the sample/standard (see Note 4).Incubate for 10 sec at room temperature.Measure and record ATP levels of the sample/standard by using TD-20/20 luminometer.Prepare and measure the next sample/standard. Repeat steps D1-D4.Transfer supernatants (solubilized proteins; obtained during step B8) of each sample into new 1.5 ml tubes and measure protein concentration using a standard protein kit, such as PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Figure 2A).Open and review the recorded data (obtained during steps D4 and D6) in Microsoft Office 2011 Excel.Subtract the value of the ATP blank sample from the raw data.",
    "Prepare ATP standard curve by using the concentrations of ATP standards and their respective bioluminescence values.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161204/20161204215041_7899.jpgFigure 2. Intracellular measurement of ATP levels in C. elegans. A. Typical standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by using BCA protein determination assay. B. ATP standard curve using ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II. ATP dilutions were assayed with luciferase reagent in TD-20/20 luminometer. C. ATP levels are decreased in PINK-1 depleted nematodes (***P < 0.001; unpaired t-test). Error bars denote SEM.Calculate the ATP content of each sample by using a log-log plot of the ATP standard curve data (Figure 2B).Divided the ATP levels (obtained during step D10) with the total protein amount (nM/mg; obtained in step D6) in Microsoft Office 2011 Excel software. Subject the data to further and more advanced statistical analysis (Figure 2C)."
