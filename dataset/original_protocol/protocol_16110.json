    "This protocol was developed to characterize seeds before the start of any selfing multiplication cycles carried out under controlled conditions. The protocol allows the characterization of the original seed phenotype from heterogeneous accessions and the seeds obtained in subsequent cycles. The data obtained will also be used as a validation tool for the accuracy of the entire process (i.e., identification of potential human/technical errors).\nMaterials\nSeeds\nRuler\nAnalytical balance\nSpreadsheet for data collection\n1. Seed weight (g) – (Crop Ontology Code ID CO_338:0000026). Count 100 well-developed seeds harvested when plants are completely dried. If this number is not possible, count and weigh a sample of 10 seeds for each line (if more than 10 seeds are available, three samples of 10 randomly selected seeds should be weighed, and the values averaged).\nImmature, broken, or infected seeds should be excluded.\n2. Seed shape (Crop Ontology Code ID CO_338:0000019). Take at least five seeds from each accession (heterogeneous materials) or line (previously developed SSD lines), and through visual observation, evaluate and classify the seed shape according to the following categories (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.371#cpz1371-fig-0003]):\n         \n1 = Angular (ram's head)\n2 = Pea-shaped\n3 = Irregular (owl's head)\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a0c1164-10b9-4a79-8fa2-92bdc67e8440/cpz1371-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nSeed shape descriptors.\n3.

    "This protocol was developed to characterize plant and seed traits for each line during the seed multiplication cycle (Primary Seed Increase). Plants must be grown in a greenhouse or growth chamber to ensure insect-free conditions and avoid cross-pollination.\nData are differentiated according to two levels of priority: Priority 1 (Mandatory Traits) and Priority 2 (Non-Mandatory Traits).\nThis protocol assumes that the materials (i.e., plants, seeds) are evaluated by visual observation and manual measurements.\nDuring the Primary Seed Increase for each line, one plant is grown and investigated for at least the first two selfing cycles (development of SSD seeds). It is recommended to grow more than one plant per line in subsequent cycles, according to availability under controlled conditions. If more than three plants are grown per line, traits can be recorded on a subsample (i.e., at least three randomly chosen plants).\nMaterials\nSeeds\nRuler\nAnalytical balance\nSpreadsheet for data collection\nPriority 1, Mandatory Traits\n1.
