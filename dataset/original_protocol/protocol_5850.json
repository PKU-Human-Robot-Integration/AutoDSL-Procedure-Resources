    "Preparation of DNA probesTo create the probe templates, amplify three DNA fragments covering the sequences encompassing the oriC region (primers Ori1-F and Ori1-R, Ori2-F and Ori2-R, and Ori3-F and Ori3-R, Table 1) and three fragments encompassing the putative terC region (primers Ter1-F and Ter1-R, Ter2-F and Ter2-R, and Ter3-F and Ter3-R, Table 1) by PCR with a thermal cycler using ExTaq (see manufacturer'sinstruction[href=http://catalog.takara-bio.co.jp/PDFS/RR001A_DS_j.pdf]). The amplified sequences will then be used to create probe templates (Figure 1).To obtain the fragmented DNA (< 100 bp) sonicate the DNA using a Covaris S-2 sonicator (duty cycle: 5%; intensity: 3; cycles/burst: 200; time: 45 sec; number of cycles: 2) (Figure 1). This fragmentation step is necessary for permeating cell membrane.Ethanol precipitation: Add 1/10 volume of sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1/10 volume of glycogen, and 2.5 volume of ethanol to the reaction mix and chill on ice for 10 min. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 20 min and wash the pellet using 500 μl of 70% ethanol.Dissolve the pellet in 10-50 μl of sterile water and determine the DNA concentration by using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer.Label 1 μg of template DNA fragments using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (see the manufacturer'sinstruction[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/11004760001bul.pdf]) and fluorescence-12-dUTP as the labeling substrate (Figure 1). Denature the template DNA by heating at 100 °C for 10 min and immediately chill on ice for 10 min. Add 10 μl of hexanucleotide mix, 2.5 μl of fluorescence-12-dUTP, dNTP stock mix, and fill up to 95 μl using sterile water. Start the labeling reaction by addition of 5 μl Klenow enzyme and incubate at 37 °C for 15-20 h.Remove any remaining non-incorporated substrate by ethanol precipitation (see Step A3). Add 100 μl of the hybridization solution to dissolve the labeled probe DNA (final conc. 10 ng/μl).",
    "Immediately before hybridization, denature the probe by heating at 100 °C for 10 min and then chill on ice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730230519_5617.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of preparation of DNA probesPreparation of the S. elongatus 7942 cultureStreak out and pre-incubate S. elongatus 7942 cells on BG-11 agar plates at 30 °C under continuous illumination (40 μE/m2/sec) for 1 week in a plant growth chamber.Suspend cells on a BG-11 agar plate in approximately 1 ml of BG-11 medium and inoculate into 80 ml of BG-11 medium in a 100-ml glass tube at an OD750 of approximately 0.1.Incubate the culture at 30 °C under continuous illumination (40 μE/m2/sec) and bubble with 2% CO2 in air for 24 h.Harvest 5 ml of cell culture and centrifuge at 3,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then subject the pelleted cells to fixation as described below.FixationSuspend the cell pellet in 100 μl medium, add 1 ml chilled fixation solution, and incubate for exactly 5 min at -80 °C.Centrifuge the fixed cells at 20,000 x g for 1 min, wash the cell pellet twice with 1 ml of PBS, and store the cell at -30 °C until further analysis.Assess the quality of the fixed cells (cell shape, chromosomal morphology and chlorophyll fluorescence) by fluorescence microscopy. For this assessment, mix a few of the fixed cells with 4 μl mounting solution containing DAPI (final conc. 5 μg/ml) and analyze by using an Olympus BX53 fluorescence microscope (Figure 2). In comparison to the untreated cells, the chlorophyll fluorescence of the fixed cells should be decreased. If remarkable reduction of cell size was observed for the fixed cells, shorten the incubation time at -80 °C in Step C1.Note: The fluorescence of DAPI is observed without incubation. To avoid reduction of fluorescence, we covered the slides with aluminum foil.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730230546_6672.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Assessment of cell shape and chromosomal morphology of the fixed cells. The fixed cells were stained with DAPI and examined with fluorescence microscopy. The images shown are as follows: bright-field (A), DAPI staining (B), and chlorophyll fluorescence (C). Scale bars = 2 μm.FISHResuspend the fixed cell pellet (Procedure C, Step 2) in 1 ml 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 20, 000 x g for 1 min and then wash twice with 1 ml of PBS.For permeabilization, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme in PBS solution, and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Centrifuge at 20, 000 x g for 1 min and then wash the cell pellet twice with 1 ml of PBS.Spot and spread 10 μl of fixed cell suspension on a poly-L-lysine-coated glass slide with a pipet tip and then let air dry at room temperature.For washing the slides, submerge each glass slide into a glass vat filled with water, and remove the slides from the glass vat.Incubate each slide in cold (-30 °C) 70% ethanol in a glass vat for 5 min and then wash the slides in another two glass vats (90% and then 100%) each for 5 min at room temperature. Next, air dry the slides.Add 5 μl of hybridization solution containing the denatured probe labeled with fluorescence-12-dUTP, as described above on each slide. And then incubate the slides overnight at 42 °C in a humidified chamber (FormaTM direct heat CO2 Incubator with a water-filled vat on the bottom of chamber). After hybridization, wash the slides twice with 50% formamide in 1x SSC at 37 °C in a glass vat for 10 min.",
    "Wash the slides with 2x and 4x SSC solutions in glass vats at room temperature for 5 min each.Air dry the slides at room temperature, and then apply 5 μl of mounting solution to the slide. Seal the slide with a cover glass, and then examine under an Olympus FSX100 fluorescence microscope. Take three images of the cells: DAPI (excitation: 360-370 nm, emission: 420-460 nm), chlorophyll fluorescence (excitation: 530-550 nm, emission: 575 nm), and FISH fluorescence (excitation: 460-495 nm, emission: 510-550 nm) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730230609_3284.jpgFigure 3. Raw images. Fixed cells were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the ori probe, which covered approximately 13 kb encompassing the ori region. Shown are DAPI-stained cells (A), intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence of cells (B), and FISH foci (C). Scale bars = 20 μm."
