    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBelow we provide a step-by-step protocol describing the sequencing of antibody variable regions, purification of antibody and antigen, and structure determination of the antibody-antigen complex (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1056-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical size-exclusion chromatograms showing antibody only (orange line), antigen only (blue line), and antibody-antigen complex (gray line).\nAntibody variable region sequencing\nTiming: 1 week\nThis step allows for the accurate determination of the amino acid sequences of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibody. These sequences are vital for the atomic structural model building and fitting into the electron density data from cryo-EM analyses. The antibody variable region sequencing protocol was adopted from (Meyer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTotal RNA was extracted from the hybridoma cells using the RNeasy mini kit by following the vendor’s recommendations (Qiagen).\ncDNA synthesis was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis system (Bio-Rad) with the mouse IgG reverse transcription primers listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. The reaction condition is listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1056_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1056_4.csv\nTo amplify the antibody variable regions from the cDNA, a two-stage PCR reaction (Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) was run with the universal forward PCR primer and reverse PCR primer based on the antibody chain (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1056_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1056_6.csv\nThe amplicons from the 1st PCR reaction (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) appeared between 550–600 base pairs on 1 % agarose gel.\nThe amplicon DNA was extracted from the gel using the QIAEX II DNA Extraction Kit by following the vendor’s recommendations (Qiagen).\nThe extracted DNA was used to set up the 2nd-stage PCR (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]). The PCR amplicon was extracted and Gibson-assembled to the pET28a+ plasmid (EMD Biosciences). The pET28a+ vector amplicon was prepared using the primer pair matching the light and heavy chains (Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).",
    "The Gibson-assembled circular plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5α, a single colony was isolated, and the isolated plasmid was Sanger-sequenced using either T7 promoter or T7 terminator primer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: Other plasmids and E. coli strains can be used.\nCritical: The PCR amplicons could be directly sequenced to determine the antibody variable regions via Sanger sequencing. However, we found out that the sequencing outcomes were less satisfactory and counter-productive due to ambiguous base calls in our cases.\nPurification of antibody\nTiming: 1 week\nCell culture supernatants of the hybridomas generated as part of (Ahn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Nguyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) were prepared by centrifugation for 15 min at approximately 6,000 × g at 4°C using JLA8.1 rotor, followed by filtration through 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filters.\nProtein G resins were packed in a 25 mL gravity plastic column and equilibrated by flowing 20 mL of the binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0).\nThe cleared hybridoma supernatants from step 8 were submitted to the prepared Protein G resin from step 9 three times.\nThe antibody-bound resins were washed with 25–50 mL of the binding buffer.\nThe bound antibodies were eluted by applying 10 mL of the elution buffer (0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.7), which was harvested in a conical tube containing 1 mL of the equilibration buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for immediate neutralization.\nThe purity and yield of purified antibodies were monitored via 15% SDS-PAGE.\nPurified antibodies were divided in 50 μL aliquots and stored at −80°C until use.\nNote: Flash freezing with liquid nitrogen was not required in this case. Purified antibodies were stored stably without excipients such as glycerol. However, if desired, flash freezing and the addition of excipients like glycerol can be considered in this step.",
    "Optional: IgG was directly used for the complex structure determination for TyTx11 mAb (Ahn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, if desired, the following steps can be carried out to prepare the Fab fragment, as described in (Nguyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nFab fragment generation:\nConcentrate purified mAbs to 20 mg/mL in 0.1 mL of a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10 mM EDTA.\nMix 250 μL of equilibrated immobilized Papain (ThermoFisher) with 1 mL of concentrated mAbs and incubate for at least 16 h at 37°C.\nElute the digested mAb samples in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.\nSeparate the Fab from uncut mAbs and the Fc by carrying out using a Superdex 75 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a constant flow of 0.5 mL/min.\nPurification of typhoid toxin (antigen)\nTiming: 3 days\nA highly purified antigen is vital for the generation and purification of the antigen-antibody complex. The uniformity of antigen and subsequent antigen-antibody complex improves the quality and reproducibility of data obtained during cryo-EM analysis.\nThree subunits of typhoid toxin, PltB, PltA, and CdtB, were cloned together into pET28a+ with a C-terminal His6 tag (Song et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: The in-frame ORFs of PltB and PltA were cloned downstream of a T7 promoter provided by pET28a+. The ORF for CdtB was added downstream of PltB and PltA to be in-frame with the C-terminal His6 tag presented on pET28a+. This design allowed for the expression of all three genes by the induction of T7 promoter.\nPreparing bacterial cell pellet:\nTransform the typhoid toxin plasmid in E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells.\nPick, inoculate, and culture a single colony in 10 mL of LB for at least 18 h at 37°C in a glass culture tube.",
    "The next day, transfer 5 mL of the 10 mL bacterial culture into 50 mL of LB in a 250-mL baffled flask.\nAfter 3 h of culture at 37°C, transfer 10 mL of this culture to each 1 L of LB in a 2-L baffled flask and continue to culture at 37°C, 200 rpm for 1.5–2 h.\nWhen OD600 reaches 0.5, change the setting to 28°C and 130 rpm.\nAfter 30 min, add 250 μL of 0.5 M isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to each culture (final concentration, 125 μM) and stir before placing the culture back to the incubator for 17–18 h.\nHarvest the bacterial cells in a 1 L centrifuge bottle with 5000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nPour off the supernatant into an empty flask and bleached (10% v/v) to discard.\nNote: If desired, scoop out the pellet and combine up to 2 flasks worth of pellets into a single 50 mL tube.\nStore the pellet at −80°C if desired.\nBacteria lysis and centrifugal clarification:\nIn a 50 mL conical tube containing bacterial pellets from up to 2 L culture, add 25 mL of buffer A and vortex to resuspend.\nAdd a protease inhibitor cocktail solution (final, 1x), 2 mg/mL of lysozyme, and 40 μg/mL of DNAse I and invert the tube several time to mix.\nSubject the bacteria solution to 3 repeats of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen.\nLyse the cells using a 200-Watt ultrasonic homogenizer with a 1/8” probe (VWR).\nUse the ‘Time – Pulse’ setup with the 75% power, 20 sec-on, and 20 sec-off for 4 min.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 × g at 4°C.\nNi-Immobilized Metal Affinity chromatography (IMAC):\nLoad the clarified lysate onto 10 mL of Ni-NTA equilibrated with buffer A.",
    "Wash the column with 100 mL of buffer A.\nElute the protein with 50 mL of buffer B and collect 7 mL fractions.\nCombine elute fractions containing desired protein and concentrate using Amicon columns, 30 kDa cutoff (ThermoFisher) until the volume reaches less than 5 mL.\nHiTrap SP HP cation exchange chromatography:\nIn a 50 mL conical tube, add 45 mL of buffer C and up to 5 mL of the concentrated Ni-IMAC eluate to lower the pH and salt level.\nLoad the protein solution onto a 5 mL SP HiTrap column equilibrated with buffer C.\nConnect the column to the AKTA system.\nRun the ‘Toxin SP – Opt (or any name that you prefer to use)’ program: AKTA A-line equilibrated with buffer C, B-line equilibrated with buffer D.\nA flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nFractionation of 1 mL for 60 mL.\nGradient going from 0 to 40% buffer D for 50 mL.\nAt 50 mL, gradient going from 40% to 100% for 1 mL.\nAt 70 mL, gradient going from 100% to 0% for 1 mL.\nAt 90 mL, stop method.\nRun SDS-PAGE of the fractions containing UV-peaks to identify the fractions of interest.\nPool the fractions containing the toxin and concentrate using a 5 mL Amicon column, 30 kDa cutoff, by spinning at 3500 × g for ∼15 min at 4°C until the volume reaches 400–500 μL.\nSize Exclusion Chromatography:\nOptional: PBS can be used in place of buffer E if the downstream procedure is not compatible with Tris.\nEquilibrate a Superdex 200 10/300GL increase column with buffer E.\nLoad the concentrated protein elute from the HiTrap SP chromatography (up to 500 μL) through the manual injection port of AKTA into the 500 μL sample loop.",
    "Run the ‘Size Ex −500 μL (or any name that you prefer to use)‘ program: AKTA A-line equilibrated with buffer E\nA flow rate of 0.25 mL/min.\nFractionation of 0.5 mL for 28 mL.\nInject 0.5 mL from the 500 μL sample loop (Cytiva).\nAt 28 mL, stop method.\nNote: In the case of typhoid toxin, you should see the UV peak around 12 mL–14.5 mL, which equates to an estimate of 110–120 kDa.\nAliquot the toxin and freeze at −80°C until use.\nAssess the toxin concentration and analyze on SDS-PAGE.\nNote: Western blot and/or mass spectrometry can be carried out if further validation is desired.\nOptional: If the antibody recognition site overlaps with the location of the tag used for protein purification, the tagless version of proteins can be prepared. The following is the procedure that we used to obtain the tagless typhoid toxin (Nguyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPreparation of a column packed with the TyTx1 antibody-conjugated agarose resin:\nTransfer 1 mL of the settled Pierce NHS-activated agarose resin (ThermoFisher, cat# 26200), wash with PBS, and incubate with PBS containing 14 mg of the TyTx1 antibody (Nguyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) for 1 h at 25°C with gentle rocking for the conjugation to occur.\nWash the resin four times with 5 mL of PBS.\nQuench the resin by repeated washing with 10 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and store at 4°C until use.\nNote: The resin should be stable for longer than a year. Proper handling of the resin including buffer selection and cleaning will ensure a long shelf-life of the resin.\nPurification of the tagless typhoid toxin:",
    "Culture E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET28a+ carrying tagless typhoid toxin subunits in LB to approximately OD600=0.7 at 37°C, transfer to 28°C, add with 0.5 mM IPTG, and incubate for 16 h.\nResuspend the harvested bacteria pellet in buffer E containing 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, and 80 μg/mL DNAse I, and subject to 3 times of the freeze-thaw step in liquid nitrogen, and lyse the bacterial cells by sonication. See steps 17–18 for details.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nMix the clarified lysate with the prepared TyTx1-conjugated agarose and incubate at 4°C for 30 min with gentle rocking.\nRecapture the resin by passing the lysate through a gravity column and wash with buffer E.\nElute the protein with 5 mL of 100 mM Glycine, pH 3.0, and quickly neutralize the eluted protein by adding 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8.\nApply the purified protein to size exclusion chromatography.\nAntibody-antigen complex and cryo-EM grid preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nAntibody-antigen complex preparation:\nPrepare TyTx11 mAbs bound to wild-type purified typhoid toxin (PltB, PltA, CdtB) by at least 16 h incubation of the 1:1 mixture of antibody and toxin (250 μL each of ∼1.2 mg/mL proteins) at 4°C.\nSubmit the antibody-antigen mixture to a Superdex 200 10/300 increase column (Cytiva) using a constant flow of 0.5 mL/min of buffer F (15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl).\nCollect fractions corresponding to the antibody-antigen complex (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Measure the concentrations using the Bradford solution (Bio-Rad, cat# 5000006) and use the purified complexes immediately for Cryo-EM grid/sample preparations using buffer F.\nGrid preparation:\nDilute IgG-toxin complex samples with buffer F to a final concentration of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/mL providing a variable for grid screening.",
    "Apply samples (3.5 μL) to glow-discharged copper Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 300 mesh cryo-EM grid (EMS) mounted, blotted, and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (ThermoFisher) at 100% humidity at 4°C.\nOne of the common settings for Vitrobot was: Blot total – 1; Blot force – 1; Blot time – 2 to 4 s; Drain time −1 s; Wait time – 0 s.\nStore frozen grids in liquid nitrogen until analysis.\nCryo-EM grid screening and data acquisition\nTiming: 1 day\nGrid Screening:\nTest two variables per antibody-toxin complex: blot times and protein concentrations.\nNote: Optimal protein concentrations and blot times may vary depending on samples, which can be empirically determined. As shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], good grids should have wells containing thin vitrified ice with good protein complex dispersal. In our case, using two different protein concentrations, 0.1 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, we tested 4 different blot times: 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4s to screen for good grid, resulting in 8 different grids. The initial screen indicated that a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was suitable for imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1056-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cryo-EM sample and grid preparation\nExamples of good and bad ice.\n(A) The panel in the middle (thin vitrified ice) is a good example that typically shows protein particles with suitable dispersion.\n(B) Samples with thin vitrified ice were examined for particle dispersion and marked for data collection (i). During data processing, suitable particle picking parameters were set to auto-pick most particles (ii). Subsequent rounds of particle picking were carried out to exclude non-protein debris particles (iii).\nData Acquisition:",
    "In our case, data were acquired at a nominal magnification of 63,000× for TyTx11 using a Talos Arctica (ThermoFisher) operating at 200 kV equipped with a Gatan energy filter set to a slit width of 20 eV and K3 detector operating in super-resolution counting mode using a defocus range of −0.8 to −1.8 μm.\nIn our case, 50 frame movies with a super-resolution pixel size of 1.23 were collected over a 4-s exposure, resulting in a total dose of 54.7 e- Å−2 (1.06 e- Å−2/frame) for the TyTx11/Toxin complex.\nNote: To provide an example, in the case of our TyTx1 and TyTx4 study, we took approximately 150–200 movies that successfully yielded the complex structures for TyTx1 and TyTx4 (Nguyen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: A newer software like CryoSparc Live processes images captured by camera real-time, informing the researcher when to stop.\nCryo-EM data processing\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThe simplified version of the cryo-EM data processing workflow is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. See Ahn et al. (Ahn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for additional details.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1056-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Typical workflow of cryo-EM data processing\nSee also Ahn et al. (Ahn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for 2D classification and other details.\nImage import, motion correction, and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation:\nPerform motion correction of each image stack using MotionCor2 function in RELION (Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Nakane et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nFollowing CTF estimation by CTFFIND-4.1 via Relion 3, subject the movies (i.e., a total of 935 movies collected during data acquisition) to Laplacian-of-Gaussian particle picking in RELION 3.\nApproximately 1000 particles were manually picked, extracted, and 2D classified to serve as initial templates for automated particle picking in RELION 3.\nThe resulting 1,009,626 particles were extracted at 3.0457 Å/pixel to reduce the memory requirements during computation and to speed up image processing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "The 2D classification was used to remove incorrectly picked particles (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] left panel).\nCryoSparc 2 was used to generate an 3D ab initio model from the cleaned particle set.\nThis 3D ab initio model was used as a reference map for subsequent 3D classifications and refinement in RELION 3.\nInitial 3D classification revealed three out of five classes containing particles resembling the structure of Fab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] right panel).\nThe particles from those classes were combined and submitted to another round of 3D classification, which revealed one of four classes contained high-quality particles resulting in a high-resolution estimate for the model (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] middle-right panel).\nParticles from this class were then used for subsequent per-particle CTF refinements and 3D refinement (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] bottom-right panel).\nWhen no further improvement could be made, the particles were then un-binned and re-extracted at 1.23 Å/pixel.\nAfter subsequent CTF refinements and 3D refinements, a Bayesian polishing step followed by a final 3D classification was used to remove any last junk particles.\nFinal reconstruction using 61,478 particles was generated. The final 3D reconstruction has a 0.143 FSC cutoff resolution of 3.12 Å according to RELION3 (Figure 43 bottom left panel).\nStructural model building\nTiming: 1 week\nChimera (www.cgl.ucsf.edu[href=http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu]) was used to place the crystal structures of typhoid toxin (PDB 4K6L) and PltB pentamer (PDB 4RHR) into the sharpened reconstructions as preliminary atomic models. See Ahn et al. (Ahn et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for additional details.\nThe preliminary atomic models for TyTx11 Fab variable region were obtained from the following models selected based on sequence similarity through BLAST: the light chain from PDB 6GFF and the heavy chain from PDB 1F11. The constant regions of the TyTx11 were too flexible for the proper density fitting and thus left unbuilt in the final deposited model.",
    "Coot (www.biop.ox.ac.uk/coot[href=http://www.biop.ox.ac.uk/coot]) was then used to manually rebuild these preliminary models. The flexibility of the antibody constant regions, CdtB subunit, and the majority of the PltA subunit prevented us from confidently building these portions of the maps, so they were left unbuilt.\nCyclical refinement step involving model manually modified in Coot was submitted to automated real-space refinement in Phenix (phenix-online.org[href=http://phenix-online.org]), which was manually modified in Coot to lower clashes and fix outliers. The quality of the final models was validated using MolProbity (molprobity.biochem.duke.edu[href=http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu]).\nFigures were generated using Chimera and Pymol (Schrodinger, Inc). Cryo-EM density maps and refined complex structures were deposited under EMD-21429 and PDB 6VX4 for the TyTx11 MAb-toxin complex."
