    "All animal activities described here were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Male ApoE−/− mice (C57BL/6 background) of 6-8 weeks old were used for the study.\n1. Experimental preparation\nPrepare Tribromoethanol anesthetics (15 mg/mL): dissolve 0.75 g of tribromoethanol in 1 mL of tert-amyl alcohol (see Table of Materials). After complete dissolution, dilute it to 50 mL with sterile saline. Store the solution at 4 °C in a sterile container and avoid exposure to light.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, tribromoethanol was used due to optimal anesthesia recovery time and survival rate of animals. Follow local animal ethics committee recommendations when selecting the anesthesia regimen.\nPrepare PM suspension: measure 5 mg of DPM (Diesel particulate matter, see Table of Materials) in 10 mL centrifuge tubes. Add 5 mL of normal saline and turn the tube upside down to mix well. Use paraffin film to seal the tube and then put it into ultrasonic cleaner for 2-3 h (40KHz, 80w) for ultrasonic breaking.\n\tNOTE: The suspension should be homogeneous and free of particles agglomerates. Shake well before use.\n2. Induction of atherosclerosis in mice\nFeed the mice with a high-fat diet (egg yolk powder 10%, lard 10%, sterol 1%, maintenance feed 79%, see Table of Materials) for 12 weeks.\nTo estimate the progress of atherosclerosis, select 2-3 mice randomly and check whether there is a plaque in the aortic arch by ultrasound imaging or direct anatomical observation17.\n\tNOTE: For anatomical observation, animals were selected via random sampling and euthanized after anesthetization. Then, their chest cavity was opened, and blood vessels were directly visualized. Anatomical observation is usually more reliable because ultrasound imaging may not detect all plaques.\nOnce atherosclerosis has judged formed, prepare the mice for the next step.",
    "3. Orotracheal intubation and particulate matter acute exposure\nNOTE: PM will be exposed once a week for 4 weeks after 12 weeks of high-fat feeding and continually given a high-fat diet.\nPrepare a dissection board (see Table of Materials) with a rubber band securing 1.5 cm from the top edge. Fix the dissection board at a 60° angle from the table plane.\nAnesthetize the mouse using tribromoethanol anesthetic by intraperitoneal injection (0.1 mL for every 10 g of body weight). After 2-3 min, flip the mouse to check if there is a righting reflex. Perform a toe pinch to confirm sedation. Drop sterile lubricating on the eyes.\nDisinfect the dissection board with alcohol wipes.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in a supine position on the board and hook the upper incisors to the rubber band.\nUse a small LED spotlight (see Table of Materials) with a flexible pipe. Focus the light on the trachea, which is at around the midpoint of the axillary line.\nPut a small sterile cotton swab into the mouse's mouth, then roll the swab to stick the tongue out.\nHold the tongue and gently pull it up to make the oral cavity, pharynx, and trachea in the same longitudinal direction. The glottis, which is the entrance of the trachea, will be shown as a bright spot, which opens and closes with each breath.\nKeep holding the tongue gently. Insert the cannula (22 G) into the trachea of the mouse by aiming at the glottis, pulling out the needle core after the cannula is inserted in the trachea.",
    "Use a pipette gun with a small amount of normal saline to test whether the tube is correctly in the weasand. If the tube is at the right position, the liquid column in the pipette gun will be bouncing with each breath.\nDrop 50 µL of DPM suspension (prepared in step 1.2) into the tube with a pipette gun. The suspension will be naturally inhaled into the lungs of the mouse as it breathes.\n\tNOTE: To ensure smooth breathing, giving the mouse two times the DPM suspension (25 µL for once), 10 s apart, is better.\nRemove the pet indwelling needle after PM exposure. Wait for the mouse to remain on the heating pads until they regained consciousness (10-20 min) and then place back into the home cage.\n4. Coronary artery ligation\nNOTE: Myocardial Ischemia modeling operation (coronary artery ligation) is performed at the 16th week.\nPrepare surgical instruments. After autoclaving, store all the surgical tools in a sealed instrument box. Soak them in 75% alcohol for 20-30 min before surgery.\nConstruct the surgery platform. To achieve the proper platform slope, use a cell culture dish cover (150 mm x 25 mm). Fold 0-0 silk (10-15 cm length) in half and attach the ends of the thread to the top of the inclined platform using tape to create a suspension loop.\nAnesthetize the mice following the procedure described in step 3.2.\n\tNOTE: A 1-week interval must be ensured between each tribromoethanol administration.\nDisinfect the platform with alcohol wipes.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on the intubation platform and hook the upper incisors at the suspension loop described in step 4.2. Tape the tail, limbs, and whiskers.\nRemove the hair of the left chest and part of the adjacent right chest with hair removal cream before surgery.",
    "Perform orotracheal intubation in mice following the procedure described in steps 3.4-3.8.\nLink the pet indwelling needle with an animal ventilator (see Table of Materials). Ventilator setting: respiratory rate- 120 times/min; inhalation/respiration ratio - 1:1.1; tidal volume - 1.7 mL.\nWipe the skin with iodophor and alcohol to disinfect.\nExpose the heart. Make a skin cut for 0.5-1 cm by ophthalmic scissors and brace the muscles (pectoral superficialis muscle and serratus anterior muscle) to expose the ribs. Clamp the rib with an ophthalmic tweezer (with hooks) and then make a small cut at the third intercostal space (see Table of Materials). Make an operating window with homemade chest opening tools.\n\tNOTE: The skin cut is located at about one-third of the xiphoid process and axilla line.\nRip the pericardial membranes. Then it is possible to ligate LAD by following steps 4.11-4.14.\n\tNOTE: If the pulmonary lobes are blocking the view, push it behind the heart using a small sterile cotton swab.\nAt first, locate the LAD.\nHold the sterile 6-0 silk suture with a needle using microvascular hemostatic forceps (see Table of Materials). Pass the silk through a 2 mm width of myocardium in the area where the coronary artery is located.\n\tNOTE: Do not try to ligate the LAD only, which may cause major intraoperative hemorrhage.\nPlace a short piece of sterile 5-0 silk between the ligature and myocardial tissues to prevent tissue breakage.\nTie the LAD and the small bundle of the myocardium around it tightly. The ligation is deemed successful when the anterior wall of the left ventricle (LV) turns pale; ST-segment elevation can be observed simultaneously if an electrocardiogram machine is connected.\nGently squeeze out the air from the chest. Suture intercostal muscles and skin sequentially with sterile 5-0 silk.",
    "NOTE: To squeeze the air from the chest, close the chest at the moment of lung expansion and use the index and middle fingers to gently squeeze the ribcage in the middle and allow the air to escape from beyond the last stitch. Syringes can also be used to extract chest gas.\n\tNOTE: Simple interrupted suture is recommended, for the mice may gnaw the silk when they are awake.\n5. Recovery\nClean up all the bloodstain after surgery, or the mouse would be attacked by others.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad in a lateral recumbent position. Continuously monitor mouse signs for 5-20 min until they recover from anesthesia. The monitoring time depends on the state of the body.\n\tNOTE: Mice breathe easier in the lateral recumbent position.\nOnce the righting reflex is recovered, transfer the mice to clean recovery cages on a heating pad with food and water bottle. Continue to monitor for 15-30 min to ensure the survival of the mouse. Keep the mouse away from others before it can move entirely autonomously.\nTo prevent wound infection, inject penicillin sodium intramuscularly according to the desired dose (1,00,000-1,50,000 U/kg). For details, please refer to the drug labeling for dosage conversion.\nPlace the mouse back into the home cage. Keep monitoring for the next 24 h before sample collection. Administer analgesics for long-term experiments.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
