    "Sample preparationHarvest whole tomato flowers 2 DBF and 2 DAF from glasshouse-grown tomato plants and placed on ice for 4 h in fixing solution under vacuum (300 mm Hg) to remove air bubbles and submerge the entire flower. Wash flowers 3 x 10 min in 50 mM PIPES and store overnight at 4 °C. Was a further 3 x 10 min in ddH2O preceding ethanol dehydration. Ethanol dehydration series is progressed 10-100% in 10% increments whilst flowers are submerged in 5 ml of solution for 1 h per increment at 4 °C up to 70% then store tissue overnight. The following day remaining increments 80% and 90% are applied for 1 h at RT. Once in 100% ethanol, flowers are washed twice in 100% at 1 h increments before again being stored overnight.LR white resin is diluted with ethanol and infiltration series conducted as above with LR white concentrations starting at 10% through to 100% on a rotator at RT. Once samples are in 100% LR white resin, change with 5 ml fresh 100% LR white solution every 2-3 days for a period of three weeks. Size 000 gelatine capsules are 1/3 filled with LR white resin and partly polymerised at 60 °C (~12 h). Flowers are then placed into middle of each capsule with petals pointing up, on the partly polymerised resin and filled with LR white resin. The gelatine capsules are sealed and placed in 60 °C oven for 48 h until resin is totally polymerised. Hardened capsules are then trimmed with a razor blade around each flower sample under a dissecting microscope leaving 1 mm resin around all surfaces. The trimmed blocks are securely fastened onto a Reichert Ultracut E microtome and 1 µm thick sections cut using 45 Diamond DiATOME Histo Knife, 4.0-4.9 mm.",
    "Sections are floated onto water at RT within the knife boat before being transferred to a drop of ddH2O on a gelatine coated LIVINGSTONETM microscope slide.Three sections are placed on each slide and dried on a laboratory warming tray at 45 °C in fume hood under a beaker with a chloroform soaked cotton wool bud attached to the underside until water drop evaporated and the section flattens onto the slide.  Immunolabeling1 ml of blocking buffer is pipetted onto slide for 2 h (a hydrophobic pen can be used to prevent leakage). Excess solution is dried off the edges of each slide. Thereafter, 200 µl of 1:100 LIN5 or INH antibody, diluted in TBST, is pipetted to each slide and incubated for 1 h at RT. Slides are then washed 3 x 20 min with TBST. Once again excess solution is blotted from slide with lint free paper (without touching sections) and secondary anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated antibody, produced in goat is applied at a dilution of 1:200 in TBST incubated for 1 h at RT as above in dark conditions. Slides are washed as above with successive wash steps in TBST and then ddH2O (Figure 1A). CounterstainingA novel counterstaining procedure was developed to ascertain cellular localisation of LIN5 and INH. Following immunolabelling, 200 µl of aniline blue is applied to the washed sections and incubated for 20 min in dark conditions. Excess aniline blue is washed off by slowly pipetting 5 ml TBST over sections while holding at a 45° and then sections are mounted in 20 μl mowiol-phenylenediamine (mowiol) before a 22 x 50 mm long coverslip is applied. Sections are viewed under a ZEISSTM AxioScope. A1 epifluorescence compound microscope.",
    "Immunolabelling is viewed using 450-490 nm excitation, long pass 515 nm emission FITC filter set with at 100x objective under oil emersion (Figure 1A). Once immunolabelling signal is detected, rapid switching to 365 nm excitation, short pass 420 nm emission UV filter set is achieved to detect fluorescent callose upon binding to aniline blue, as the latter fades rapidly. The image is captured on a ZEISSTM AxioCam digital camera using AxioVision V4.8 software (Figure 1B). Filter set is returned to FITC and another image was taken of immunolabelling in the same target area (Figure 1A). When removing each slide from the microscope stage, care must be taken to keep the stage in the same position and to note the orientation of the slide. Once slide had been removed, the coverslip was slid off the slide with extreme care and discarded. Sections are washed with TBST as above until all excess mowiol is removed and 200 µl of 1:500 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is applied to locate the nucleolus and incubated at RT for 30 sec. Excess DAPI is removed with TBST and slides re-mounted as described above. The target area is re-acquired and aligned whilst being viewed under the FITC filter and compared to the previously captured image (Figure 1A) before being switching to long pass 420 nm emission UV filter set and capturing the image of DAPI stained cells (Figure 1C). As with DAPI counterstaining procedure, Calcofluor white staining proceeds as above to label cell wall cellulose (Figure 1D). All images are then exported and overlayed using Abode Photoshop CS4 software package (Figure 1E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170324/20170324220512_5222.jpgFigure 1.
