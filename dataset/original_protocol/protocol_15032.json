    "1. Harvesting and Processing of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue from Surgical Specimens\nPrepare two 50 ml polystyrene conical tubes containing 15 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nPathology service personnel harvest primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples from prostatectomy and palliative surgery specimens, respectively, under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Metastatic samples may be obtained from lymph node dissections during primary surgery, the vertebrae during palliative surgical procedures, such as spinal cord decompression, and the lungs during diagnostic removal of single metastatic lesions, among others.\n\t\nHarvest excess bulk tissue not needed for clinical diagnostics into the first 50-ml polystyrene conical tube from step 1.1 and store immediately at 4 °C. The harvested tissue should measure at least a 4-5 cm2 in area and 1-2 cm in thickness.\nLaboratory personnel process bulk tissue obtained from the pathology service in preparation for histological examination and generation of cell suspensions.\n\t\nProcessing of bulk tissues should not exceed 24 hr from surgical resection in order to guarantee maximal cell viability.\nWorking in a biosafety cabinet with a sterile scalpel and forceps, take 2-4 mm thick horizontal tissue sections from macroscopic tumor nodules. Immediately store the sections in the second 50 ml polystyrene conical tube from step 1.1.\nWhen macroscopic nodules are not visualized from prostatectomy samples, collect random 2-4 mm thick horizontal tissue sections from the posterior lobes and transition zone.\nSeparate a portion of the surgical tissue using a sterile scalpel and forceps and fix it in 10% formalin prior to generation of cell suspensions. Archive and analyze this material histologically to confirm the presence of prostate cancer tissue.\n2. Generation of Cell Suspensions from Tissue Sections",
    "Working in a sterile biosafety cabinet, transfer a tissue section to a 60 x 15 mm culture dish containing 1 ml of sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\nMechanically triturate the sample using a sterile scalpel and forceps.\nNo enzymatic digestions are in this protocol.\nTransfer the 1 ml suspension into a sterile 50 ml conical tube.\n\t\nAdd 1 ml to the culture dish and repeat the trituration step until the tissue section is completely dissociated, usually 3-4x.\nRepeat this procedure serially until all tissue sections have been dissociated.\nResuspend the contents of the 50 ml polystyrene conical tube with a 5 ml serological pipette and vortex at maximum speed (approximately 3,200 rpm) for 1 min.\nFilter the resulting suspension through a 35-μm cell strainer and collect into a second sterile 50 ml polystyrene conical tube.\nGenerate a pellet by centrifugation at 450 x g for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 5 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer, and incubate the solution for 5 min at RT. Remove the red blood cell lysis buffer by centrifugation for 5 min at 450 x g at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1x PBS supplemented with 5% FBS, and quantify the number of viable (trypan blue-negative) cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Generate a 1x106 cells/ml suspension and store it on ice for no longer than 1 hr.\n\t\nThe viability and yield of cells may vary considerably between tumor specimens. In the prostatectomy setting, viability may range between 45-70%, and five 2-4 mm thick horizontal tissue sections from a macroscopic tumor nodule may be expected to yield approximately 3x106 viable cells.\n3. Antibody Staining of Cells for FACS",
    "Label five 15 ml polystyrene conical tubes as shown below. Use CD45 and CD31 antigen labeling to exclude hematopoietic and endothelial elements, respectively.\n\t\nUnstained\nIgG2aκ-PE + IgG1κ-FITC\nHLAI-PE + IgG1κ-FITC\nIgG2aκ-PE + CD31-FITC + CD45-FITC\nHLAI-PE + CD45-FITC + CD31-FITC\nDistribute the quantified cell suspension from the previous section (step 2.7) into the five tubes in step 3.1. Add the antibodies at a dilution of 1:250, and incubate the cell suspensions on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the cells at 450 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, and discard the supernatants.\nWash the cells by resuspending each pellet with sterile 1x PBS supplemented with 10% FBS followed by centrifugation at 450 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the cells in a 1 ml solution of 1x PBS containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml.\nFilter the final solution through 35 μm strainer caps into 12 mm x 75 mm polystyrene tubes.\n4. Isolation of Prostate CSCs by FACS\nUtilize a flow cytometer for cell sorting.\nSet compensation controls using cells from tubes #1, #2, #3, and #4.\nCreate gates that exclude debris and clusters of cells using forward- and side-scatter parameters.\nEstablish the FITC and PE gates using the suspensions from tube #3 and tube #4, respectively.\nGate viable (DAPI-negative) cells using the pacific blue-A channel.\nUsing tube #5 discard CD31-positive and CD45-positive cells and collect both HLAI-negative and HLAI-positive populations into sterile 15-ml polystyrene conical tubes containing 2 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge the sorted cell suspensions at 450 x g for 5 min, and then resuspend the pellets in 200-500 μl of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS.\nQuantify viable (trypan blue-negative) cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nSubscription Required.
