    "Add 60 pmol siRNA-NPL4 (or siRNA-luciferase for negative control) to 250 µL of Opti-MEM. Mix well using a vortex mixer (Figure 1).Note: Steps 1–8 pertain specifically to the siRNA transfection protocol, while step 9 marks the beginning of the pull-down protocol. To perform siRNA transfection, please follow the \"Reverse transfection protocol\" of LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX transfection reagent. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4640/bioprotoc-13-06-4640-g001.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the protein pull-down HiBiT assay. A. Schematic illustration of the protein pull-down HiBiT assay. B. Flow diagram of the protein pull-down HiBiT assay.Add 6 µL of LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX transfection reagent to 250 µL of Opti-MEM. Mix well using a vortex mixer.Add the mixture from step 1 to that from step 2 and mix well using a vortex mixer.Incubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature.Seed 293T cells in a 6 cm dish at a density of 750,000 cells/well in 4.5 mL of culture medium.Gently add approximately 500 µL of the siRNA-Lipofectamine mixture to the cell-containing dish.Place the dish in a CO2 incubator for 24 h.Replenish culture medium at 24 h post transfection.Note: Slowly add medium to the side of the well to avoid cell detachment. Add 1.5 µg pCAG-NS4B-FLAG-HiBiT, 1.5 µg pCAG-OSF-VCP, and 120 pmol siRNA-NPL4 (or siRNA-luciferase for negative control) to 250 µL of Opti-MEM. For siRNA transfection, repeat the initial transfection using the same siRNA. Mix well using a vortex mixer.(Optional) Set control experiments using an empty vector (pCAG-OSF) in place of pCAG-OSF-VCP. Add 6 µL of LipofectamineTM 3000 transfection reagent to 250 µL of Opti-MEM. Mix well using a vortex mixer.Add the mixture from step 9 to that from step 10 and mix well using a vortex mixer.Incubate the mixture for 10 min at room temperature.Apply the mixture from step 12 to the cell-containing dish (~500 µL).",
    "Place the dish in a CO2 incubator for 48 h.Aspirate the culture medium and add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to each dish. Collect the cells using a cell scraper and transfer them to a 1.5 mL tube.Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate PBS. Add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to each tube and suspend by pipetting.Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate PBS. Add 500 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer to each tube and mix by pipetting.Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer 5 µL of the supernatant to 1.5 mL tubes for input and add 45 µL of lysis buffer. Mix well using a vortex mixer.Transfer 10 μL of diluted lysate in each well of a 384-well plate.Note: To ensure accurate measurements, it is recommended to use more than three wells per sample. If the obtained values are outside the reading range, a dilution series should be carried out. Add 10 μL of HiBiT reagent to each well.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence for 1,000 ms measurement time/well using a microplate reader.Transfer 480 µL of the clear lysate to fresh 1.5 mL tubes.Add 15 µL of Strep-Tactin Sepharose 50% suspension to the lysate and rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant. Add 1 mL of cold pull-down washing buffer to each tube and mix via inversion.Repeat steps 28 and 29 thrice.Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant. Add 450 µL of 1× Strep-tag elution and rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.",
    "Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C.Transfer 400 µL of elution buffer to fresh 1.5 mL tubes.Transfer 10 μL of elution in each well of a 384-well plate.Note: To ensure accurate measurements, it is recommended to use more than three wells per sample. If the obtained values are outside the reading range, a dilution series should be carried out. Add 10 μL of HiBiT reagent from Nano Glo HiBiT lytic detection system to each well.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Measure the luminescence for 1,000 ms measurement time/well using a microplate reader (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4640/bioprotoc-13-06-4640-g002.jpgFigure 2. HiBiT activity of the Strep-Tactin-purified fraction and the input fraction. A. HiBiT activity of the Strep-Tactin-purified fraction. B. HiBiT activity of the input fraction. C. The compensated HiBiT value of the Strep-Tactin purified fraction. The HiBiT activity of the Strep-Tactin purified fraction was calculated by dividing its value by that of the input fraction. The means between two groups were compared using a Student’s t-test. Differences were considered significant at **P < 0.01."
