    "The present protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee at the Institute of Experimental Medicine (PE/EA/1490-7/2017, PE/EA/106-2/2021). The presented data is from FVB/Ant background14, 3-month-old male THAI mice (n = 3-6/group). FVB/Ant background THAI animals tend to have highly pigmented spots on their skin that may distort measurements. Hence, search for pigmented spots on the skin of the imaged area after fur removal. Animals do not require special housing conditions unless the experiment specifically requires so (e.g., a special diet).\n1. Hyperthyroid treatment\nNOTE: A general protocol for inducing hyperthyroidism in mice is provided here. The ATA guide19 offers detailed explanations on the background of the methods with alternatives mentioned.\nDissolve T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, see Table of Materials) in 40 mM NaOH to create a stock solution with a concentration between 5-10 mg/mL.\nDilute the stock solution with saline to a final concentration of 0.1 µg/µL.\nInject the diluted T3 solution intraperitoneally (i.p.) into awake animals at a volume of 10 µL per gram of body weight (bwg). After 24 h, the animals will be considered hyperthyroid.\n\tNOTE: T3 treatment can be replaced by any other kind of treatment. The treatment does not affect the protocol of in vivo imaging.\n2. Hypothyroid treatment\nNOTE: Here, only a general protocol for inducing hypothyroidism in mice is provided. ATA guide19 describes detailed explanations on the background of the methods with alternatives mentioned.\nSwitch the diet to an iodine-free chow diet and add KClO4 and methimazole to the drinking water (0.01 % methimazole, 0.05 % KClO4) (see Table of Materials).\nReplace the drinking solution regularly (every 2-3 days) with a fresh drinking solution because methimazole is light-sensitive and degrades quickly.",
    "Keep up the treatment regime for at least 2 weeks, no more than 4 weeks. Animals will lose weight and will show discomfort. If animals are hardly moving around, have lost much of their hair, or are barely conscious, use a humane endpoint and terminate them by any method (following institutionally approved protocols).\nContinue hypothyroid treatment when combined with other treatments to prevent potential recovery from hypothyroidism.\n3. In vivo imaging\nStart the software compatible with the in vivo imaging system (see Table of Materials).\nLog in and wait for the \"Imaging Wizard\" panel to load. It is a smaller panel on the bottom left of the window.\nOn the \"Imaging Wizard\" initiate camera cooling by clicking on Initialize in the \"Image Wizard panel\". This makes the instrument run a setup protocol, wait for it to complete. The \"Imaging Wizard panel\" turns blue, and a green light will turn on in the panel when the camera temperature is low enough and the instrument is ready.\nSet the temperature of the heating pad to 30-37 °C to keep the measured animals warm.\n\tNOTE: Continue with the protocol while waiting for the camera temperature to be optimal.\nDo not keep or treat animals near the instrument. Avoid excess amounts of hair circulating in the air around the instrument.\nAnesthetize 1-3 animals with ketamine-xylazine i.p. injection (ketamine 50 mg/g, xylazine 10 mg/bwg, see Table of Materials). Alternatively, if an isoflurane anesthetic system is installed, follow institutionally approved protocols to use isoflurane anesthesia, replacing the ketamine-xylazine mixture.\n\tNOTE: Hypothyroid mice are more sensitive to ketamine-xylazine; use half dose.\nUse eye protection gel during anesthesia.\nCheck pedal reflex by pinching the footpads. No pedal reflex confirms the state of surgical plane anesthesia.",
    "After the anesthesia takes effect, remove fur from the imaged body parts using the most suitable fur removal method (epilator, shaving, cream, etc.). Ensure no fur is left on the imaged body parts to prevent the scattering of luminescent light.\nDissolve Na-luciferin (see Table of Materials) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 15 mg/mL. Luciferin is light-sensitive; avoid direct light exposure. Store the solution in amber tubes or wrap it in aluminum foil.\nTreat shaven animals with luciferin solution 10 µL/bwg i.p.\nPlace the animals into the instrument with the camera's center point marked as a '+' on the pad. Ensure proper placement by checking the gridlines and confirming with a single 'Photo' capture if unsure.\nWait for 15 min after substrate administration before taking the first measurement. During this time, set the imaging time in the \"Image Wizard\" panel to 3 min for luminescence and check the boxes for Photo and Luminescence. The 'Photo' is necessary to coincide with luminescence to identify the source of the measured signal.\n\tNOTE: 15 min is required for optimal substrate uptake and tissue distribution. The luminescent signal plateaus 15-20 min after luciferin administration. The signal starts to slowly decrease after the plateau.\nTake the first measurement by clicking on Measure in the \"Imaging Wizard\" panel.\nIf both ventral and dorsal imaging are performed, rearrange animals for the second body part to be imaged immediately after concluding the first.\nAfter imaging is done, return the animals to their cages and continue the experiment with the next set of animals.\nAllow the animals to recover, which typically takes 1-2 h at most. Place a tube filled with warm water near the animals to facilitate recovery, and monitor vital signs such as breathing and perfusion.",
    "Decide the fate of measured animals. In the data presented in this article, the measured animals were euthanized following institutionally approved protocols for ex vivo measurements. However, this is not necessary. Consider whether euthanasia or follow-up experiments are ethical.\n4. Data analysis\nOpen the \"ClickInfo\" file in the software. A panel named \"Tool Palette\" for image analysis and editing will open on the right side of the window.\nConvert scale to radiance in the top left corner of the image.\nClick on \"Image Adjust\".\nDecide on the optimal binning and color scale of the images. Make all images utilize the same settings.\nClick on \"ROI tools\" on the \"Tool palette\".\nSelect areas of interest by clicking on \"Place ROI\" in the \"ROI tools\". Using the same sized ROIs or different sized ROIs can also be meaningful depending on the experimental design.\nClick on \"Measure ROIs\". A new window will open with the data of placed ROIs. Export the data with ctr + c-ctrl + v Windows command into an organizing or statistical software of choice.\nData can be exported as total flux or average radiance. Choose which variable is the most relevant in the current experimental setting.\nContinue data analysis in accordance with the experimental design. Individual calculation of (treated-background) values as \"measured effect in one animal\" is recommended.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
