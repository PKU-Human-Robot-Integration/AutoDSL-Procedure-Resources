    "This step describes how to isolate mesothelium-bound resMØ-aggregates formed during inflammatory processes in different organs of the peritoneal cavity, particularly in the peritoneal wall and omentum. resMØ-aggregates induced by E coli infection can be easily isolated during the first 6 h post infection while, from 18 h post infection, resMØ-aggregates start to disaggregate and are more difficult to isolate. Isolated resMØ-aggregates can be subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry or electron microscopy, as detailed below, or be subjected to other studies.\nFollow steps 1a to 1c described above.\nMake an incision in the skin in the abdominal area, starting in the lower abdominal midline, without penetrating the abdominal wall, and extend the incision until the neck.\nExtend the incision to the hind and forelegs and remove all the abdominal and thoracic skin.\nInject 6–9 mL of cold PBS in the peritoneal cavity at the lower left quadrant of the abdomen, using a 10 mL syringe with a 25 G needle.\nNote: The volume of PBS to be injected has to be adjusted to the age/size of the mice used. For 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 females 8 mL were injected.\nMassage the abdomen vigorously to detach resMØ-aggregates from the mesothelium (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nMake an incision in the peritoneal wall starting in the lower abdominal midline and extend the incision until the ribcage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2413-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
