    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCRISPR/Cas9 cleavage target sequence identification\nTiming: 1 h\nIdentify the potential target sequences for DNA cleavage within the genomic region of interest by using the sgRNAcas9 software (V3.0), as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. sgRNAcas9 software package is publicly available at BiooTools website (www.biootools.com[href=http://www.biootools.com]) under the terms of the GNU General Public License.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1917-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the sgRNAs selection and design\n(A) The sgRNACas9 graphical user interface, where the cbh1 gene in the target sequence and the PfNCIM1228 genome sequence are fed as input sequences.\n(B) The sgRNAcas9 output file “sgRNAcas9_report.xls”, from where the two 20-base sgRNAs (cbh1_S_1 and cbh1_S_102) were selected for cbh1 deletion.\n(C) The T7 promoter sequence at 5′ and the overlap sequence at 3′ were appended to both the sgRNAs and chemically synthesized for sgRNA preparation.\n(D) The cbh1 gene showing the positions of both the sgRNAs, cbh1_S_1 at start codon and cbh1_S_102 at stop codon.\nNote: Detail about the software is described by Xie et al. (Xie et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nEnter the gene sequence for knockout in the target sequence and the fungal genome sequence in the genome sequence, and then run the program (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nThe software generates a report file that highlights CRISPR target sites, potential off-target sites and risk of evaluation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCarefully choose the nucleotide sequence of 20 bases that are shown best in the risk of evaluation column generated by the software based on number of off-targets.\nNote: The oligonucleotides should not include PAM sequence.\nAdd ‘G’ at the 5′-end if not present in the selected nucleotide of 20 bases (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Addition of ‘G’ at the 5′-end helps T7 RNA polymerase by providing the extra stability required in transcription (Kuzmine et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "Append T7 promoter sequence: TTCTAATACGACTCACTATA to the 5′ end and 14 nucleotides overlap sequence: GTTTTAGAGCTAGA to the 3′ end of the target specific oligonucleotide(s).\nCheck complete oligo sequence of 55 bases long : 5′ TTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG(N)20GTTTTAGAGCTAGA 3′ before ordering/synthesizing (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPlace order or synthesize the customized 55 base-long oligonucleotide (Oligo_55).\nThe sgRNA is synthesized with the help of EnGen® sgRNA Synthesis Kit (NEB #E3322). The customized 55-base long oligonucleotide (from Step 6) is used as template according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: For knockouts, to study the loss of function, a pair of sgRNAs is preferred with DNA cleavage sites near to start and stop codon of the gene for complete removal of ORF (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: If the report file is not generated by the software or target cleavage site risk column shows discard then check for the input sequences. The software does not allow any white space in the file name or file path.\nDonor DNA design and preparation\nTiming: 1 month\nThe double strand breaks (DSB) generated by Cas9 at the cleavage site is repaired by either by Non-Homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination when donor DNA construct is provided for repair of the genome (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We prepared Donor DNA for cbh1 deletion having antibiotic resistance marker, hygromycin, flanked by the 300 bp homologous region of the cbh1 ORF to be knocked out.\nCheck the target sequence and the upstream / downstream genomic sequence flanking the target cleavage sites.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1917-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B) The resulting pCBH1 plasmid is linearized by restriction digest and the Hygromycin cassette is ligated into the linearized vector to yield pHygro.\n(C) The linear dsDNA donor for CRISPR engineering is obtained from the final pHygro using CBH1_300bp_up_F and CBH1_300bp_ds_R.\nNote: We have found for NCIM1228 that donor DNA with 300 bp–500 bp homologous region is efficient for the recombination.\nA two-step cloning method for cbh1 deletion cassette preparation is mentioned below-\nThe 3432-bp genomic region of NCIM1228 containing cbh1 ORF of 1590-bp to be amplified using CBH1_ 1124bp_ up_F and CBH1_ 718bp_ dn _R primers and cloned in pCambia1302 vector at BstBI and AatII restriction enzymes sites to obtain pCBH1 construct and transform in DH5 alpha cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_9.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_10.csv\nIn the second step, in place of cbh1 ORF, hygromycin selection marker to be sub-cloned at AhdI and AleI restriction enzymes using Hygromycin F and Hygromycin R primers to obtain pHygro construct (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUsing cbh1_300bp_US_F forward and cbh1_300bp_DS_R reverse primers, the donor DNA is to be amplified (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_11.csv\nAlternatives: Donor DNA can be synthesized by overlapping PCR or by chemical synthesis.\nNote: While cloning of selection marker cassette, restriction enzymes must be selected near to start and stop codon of the ORF so that most portion of the gene is removed.\nAmplify the linear Donor DNA through PCR using forward and reverse primers binding at 300 bp upstream of cleavage site at promoter region and 300 bp downstream of another cleavage site at the terminator region (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and purify the PCR product using QIAGEN PCR purification kit.\nUse 20 μg of linear PCR product for transformation. Generally, six aliquots of 50 μL PCR reaction yields 20 μg of DNA.",
    "Reprecipitate the DNA using sodium acetate/100% ethanol or use Speedvac concentrator for evaporation of the solution.\nResuspend the DNA pellet in a solution of STC/PEG with the volume ratio at 4:1 to obtain the concentration of ∼1 mg/ mL for transformation.\nStore at −20°C until use. Use linear donor DNA along with RNP complex on the day of transformation.\nAlternatives: Donor DNA can be prepared using Gibson Assembly Reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_12.csv\nsgRNA synthesis and purification\nTiming: 3 h\nThe sgRNA is synthesized with the ordered oligonucleotides consists of 55 bases (Oligo_55) using EnGen® sgRNA Synthesis Kit, S. pyogenes (NEB #E3322) according to manufacturer’s instructions (https://international.neb.com/protocols/2016/05/11/engen-sqrna-synthesis-kit-s-pyogenes-protocol-e3322[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2016/05/11/engen-sqrna-synthesis-kit-s-pyogenes-protocol-e3322]) and purified with the Zymo Research RNA clean and concentrator kit (https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/rna-clean-concentrator-kits-rcc/products/rna-clean-concentrator-25[href=https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/rna-clean-concentrator-kits-rcc/products/rna-clean-concentrator-25]). The EnGen 2× sgRNA Reaction Mix contains 80 bases-long scaffold oligo of S. pyogenes for Cas9 recognition, which includes 14 bases at the 3′-end that are complementary to the 14 nucleotide overlap sequence of Oligo_55. The final sgRNA would contain 20 bases of target nucleotide and 80 bases of scaffold sequence (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1917-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Keep on ice until use.\nNote: Wearing of gloves and use of RNase free tubes and workbench is strongly recommended.\nP. funiculosum NCIM1228 Cas9 synthesis\nTiming: 2–3 months\nThis step describes how to customize the Cas9 protein having host-specific nuclear localization signal (NLS) for the efficient entry inside the nucleus of the targeted background host, i.e., P. funiculosum NCIM1228. This step is necessary since the classical nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SV40 is unable to efficiently translocate Cas9 into its nucleus (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nChemically synthesize the dual NLS Cas9 construct.\nFuse the 5′ end of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene with the host specific NLS sequence.\nNote: Nucleotide sequence (171 bases) encoding NLS of the P. funiculosum NCIM1228 from histone H2B protein was fused to 5′ end of the codon optimized gene for SpCas9. The sequence of the resulting PfNLS is as follows-\nATGCCTCCCAAAGCTGCCGAGAAGAAGCCCAGCACTGGTGGCAAGGCCCCAGCTGGAAAGGCTCCTGCTGAGAAGAAGGAGGCTGGCAAGAAGACTGCCACCGCTGCCTCTGGCGAGAAGAAGAAGCGCGGCAAGACTCGCAAGGAGACCTACTCTTCCTACATCTACAAG.\nNote: The SpCas9 sequence was considered from pHis-parallel1-NLS H2BCas9 vector (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAdd the nucleotide sequence encoding Simian Virus (SV40) NLS at the 3′-end of SpCas9.\nNote: NLS at both ends to obtain higher translocation efficiency inside the nucleus.\nChemically synthesize the gene encoding customized Cas9 with dual NLS.\nClone the dual NLS Cas9 construct in the expression vector for purification.\nNote: The construct was cloned in pET28a vector at NdeI and XhoI restriction sites such that the expressed protein would have 6×His tag at N-terminus to facilitate purification. The resultant vector pET-PfCas9 and the expressed Cas9 protein are shown in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B, respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1917-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) A synthetic gene containing PfNCIM1228 H2B NLS at 5′-end and SV40 NLS at 3′-end of SpCas9 was cloned in pET28a expression vector using NdeI (shown at 3,643 bp position) and XhoI (shown at 7,950 bp position) restriction sites and the resultant vector pET-PfCas9 is shown here.\n(B) A schematic representation of the translated protein containing N-terminal His-tag, PfH2B NLS, SpCas9 and SV40 NLS at C-terminus.\nRNP complex formation\nTiming: 20 min\nTake 1.6 μg of Cas9 and 1 μg of each sgRNAs in a microcentrifuge tube, add 1× nuclease reaction buffer and DEPC treated water to make reaction volume to 5 μL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_14.csv\nIncubate at 30°C for 20 min.\nStore the tubes in ice, transform together with donor DNA when protoplast is ready. Before proceeding for transformation, perform in vitro cleavage assay to check the efficiency (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1917-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Verification of in vitro Cas9 cleavage assay\nThe formation of functional RNP was verified via PCR as the PCR product showed band shift from 2,490 bp (lane2) with approx 300 bp fall out when Cas9 was incubated with sgRNA-I (lane3), sgRNA-II (lane4) and sgRNA-I & sgRNA-II (lane 5), respectively.\nFor in vitro cleavage assay,\nDilute the purified Cas9 and take volume equal to 200 ng in three different microcentrifuge tubes, take approximately 100 ng of each sgRNA - add sgRNA-I in one tube, sgRNA-II in second tube, sgRNA-I & sgRNA-II together in the third tube and incubate at 30°C for 20 min for RNP complex formation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1917_15.csv\nAmplify cbh1 sequence (i.e., the gene that has to be deleted) along with the sgRNA cleavage site, purify using the PCR purification kit and add 150 ng in each tube.",

Overview of protoplasts preparation and PEG-mediated transformation\nProtoplasts preparation protocol\nTiming: 3 days\nHarvest the spores from the sporulated plate of the fungus with 10 mL of sterile MQ (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nInoculate four flasks containing 25 mL of PDB with 107 spores in each flask.\nIncubate the flask for 36 h at 28°C at 120 rpm.\nAfter 36 h, harvest mycelia by filtering the PDB using Mira cloth.\nInoculate one full spatula of mycelia to the 25 mL of lysing solution and incubate for 3 h at 28°C at 120 rpm.\nAfter 1 h, view under microscope using Neubar counting chamber for protoplasts formation.\nAfter 3 h, filter the protoplasts using Mira cloth and collect the 25 mL filtrate in 50 mL Falcon.\nOverlay the protoplasts solution with 25 mL of protoplasts separation buffer. Centrifuge the tube at 1500 rcf for 15 min.\nCollect the protoplasts from the interface layer and dilute it with storage buffer. Keep on ice until use.\nPellet the protoplasts at 3000 rcf for 10 min and resuspend it in storage buffer and store at 4°C.\nFor transformation, resuspend protoplasts pellet in 500 μL of STC/PEG (4:1) and keep on ice.",
    "Take 10 μL of the suspension and count the protoplasts using Neubar counting chamber at 100× magnification (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Dilute in STC/PEG if required.\nCritical: Protoplasts are very fragile, thus fast up and down pipetting or vigorous mixing will damage the protoplasts. Always mix by tapping the bottom of the tube or gentle up and down pipetting. Cut the end of the pipette tip to reduce the stress on the protoplasts while pipetting.\nCritical: Overlaying of separation buffer should be done slowly and in around the rim of 50 mL centrifuge tube using Pasteur pipette.\nNote: Always use swing bucket rotor for pellet formation.\nPEG- mediated transformation\nTiming: 6 h\nLiu et al. (Liu and Friesen, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) procedure was followed for PEG-mediated transformation with minor modifications.\nPlace 15 mL centrifuge tubes on ice and pipette 100 μL (107) of protoplasts suspension to each tubes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPipette 20 μL (11–20 μg) of linearized DNA and RNP complex into protoplasts suspension and mix gently by tapping the solution. Use equal volume of the STC/PEG (4:1) solution for control tubes.
