    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe overall procedure is outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Scheme of Mr MT\nMr MT procedure consists of two steps: the first step is replacing the recipient’s endogenous microglia by tamoxifen-sensitive CX3CR1-CreER::DTA cells by microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) (refer to STAR Protocols STAR-PROTOCOLS-D-21-00166R2). After that, transplant the donor microglia intracranially at day 44. Tamoxifen is continuously applied to kill the endogenous Mr BMT cells without affecting the transplanted microglia.\nWBI: whole-body irradiation; OG: oral gavage; BMT: bone marrow transplantation; MT: microglia transplantation; PLX5622: PLX5622-formulated AIN-76A diet; CD: control diet (AIN-76A diet).\nReplace endogenous microglia of the C57BL/6J mouse with gender-matched CX3CR1-CreER::DTA microglia-like cells through mr BMT\nTiming: 44 days\nThe first step of Mr MT is replacing the endogenous microglia with tamoxifen-sensitive CX3CR1-CreER::DTA microglia-like cells through Mr BMT (Xu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). For the detailed protocol of Mr BMT, please kindly refer to Xu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nNote: The only difference is the donor cells used. For this protocol, utilize the CX3CR1-CreER::DTA mouse as the donor. In step 8 of the Mr BMT STAR protocols paper, we use the gender-matched CX3CR1+/GFP mouse. But for Mr MT, we use the gender-matched CX3CR1-CreER::DTA mouse here.\nTamoxifen-induced ablation of the CX3CR1-CreER::DTA mr BMT cells\nTiming: 4 days\nFrom D41 to D44, three days before the intracerebral injection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), treat the recipient mouse with tamoxifen (150 mg/kg body weight, dissolved in olive oil) through an oral gavage for 4 consecutive days to initiate the ablation of CX3CR1-CreER::DTA Mr BMT cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Microglia isolation from the CX3CR1+/GFP mouse\nBrain isolation\nTiming: 30 min\nTurn on the orbital shaker incubator, set the temperature at 35°C and speed at 100 rpm. Preheat the incubator for at least 20 min to 35°C. This temperature helps reduce cell death during digestion.\nAliquot 4 mL of Enzyme Digestion Mix per brain into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nDeeply anesthetize the adult CX3CR1+/GFP mouse (>2 months old, gender-matched to the recipient mouse) with ketamine (100 mg/kg, dissolved in saline) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, dissolved in saline). Pinch the tail to ensure the mouse is in a deep anesthetized state before the transcardial perfusion. Otherwise, it will cause tremendous suffering to the mouse.\nTranscardially perfuse the donor mouse with ice-cold perfusion solution (L15 medium + 3 U/L heparin) until the skull turns white.\nDecapitate the mouse and put the head in the ice-old PBS for 1 min. Make small incisions laterally on either side at the caudal/ventral base of the skull. Make additional shallow cuts starting at the caudal/dorsal aspect of the skull moving in the rostral direction up the dorsal midline. Make a final “T” cut perpendicular to the midline at the level of the olfactory bulbs. Use the round-tip forceps to grasp the skull starting at the rostral-medial aspect and peel back towards the caudal-lateral direction. Repeat for both sides to crack open and remove the dorsal halves of the skull cap to expose the brain. Harvest the brain and wash it with fresh ice-cold PBS. The brain should be white without the presence of blood (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Critical: All reagents and surgical tools should be ice-cold. The operation should be quick to minimize the damage to the cells.\nBrain digestion\nTiming: 22 min\nChop the brain using a razor blade on ice with 100 μL ice-cold PBS into ∼1 mm pieces. Then place the minced brain tissue into 3 mL enzyme digestion mix in a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nShake the minced brain in the orbital shaker incubator at 35°C, 100 rpm for 20 min (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTerminate the digestion by adding 0.5 mL 10× papain neutralization solution. Gently mix and sit on ice for about 1 min for tissue to settle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Dissociation of brain cells by the orbital shaker incubator at 35°C, 100 rpm, related to step 8\nTrituration\nTiming: 10 min\nRinse the 100 μm cell strainer with DPBS and insert it into a 50 mL centrifuge tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Cool it in ice.",
    "Transfer the supernatant above the brain chops (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) to the 50 mL tube containing the strainer, and leave the brain chops in the original tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nAdd 2 mL trituration solution to the 15 mL tube containing the brain chops (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nGently triturate the brain chops 10 times with a 1 mL tip pipette, and put on the ice for about 1 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nRepeat steps 11 to 13 until the minced brain is diminished to about 3 mm in height. Discard the remanence (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCell debris removal by percoll gradient centrifuge\nTiming: 30 min\nPrecool the centrifuge to 18°C.\nCentrifuge the brain at 400 g, 18°C for 5 min.\nInsert a 10 μL white tip on the metal pipe of the vacuum pump to aspirate the supernatant with vacuum pump suction (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Aspirate the supernatant from the brain pellet through a vacuum pump\nAdd Percoll working solution to the pellet and mix gently until the pellet disappears. Then transfer the cell suspension to a new 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tissue at 400 g, 18°C for 20 min (set the acceleration and deceleration speed to zero). Set the centrifuge temperature to 4°C after the centrifugation finished\nCritical: The temperature must be set to 18°C.\nThe myelin debris is separated from living cell pellets (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Carefully take out the tube containing the cell pellets from the centrifuge.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Separation of myelin debris from cell pellets in 30% Percoll\nInsert a 200 μL yellow tip on the metal pipe of the vacuum pump. Carefully aspirate the myelin debris and supernatant by the vacuum pump suction (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Add 5 mL trituration solution and wash by centrifugation at 4°C 400 g for 5 min.",

Removing the myelin debris and supernatant from cell pellets by the vacuum pump suction, related to step 21\nMicroglia purification by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)\nTiming: 1 h\nAdd 10 μL anti-CD11b beads into 90 μL trituration solution. Mix thoroughly.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet with the above mixture.\nIncubate the cell suspension at 4°C for 15 min. Shake the cell gently every 5 min.\nWash the cell suspension with 5 mL MACS buffer through 400 g centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet with 3 mL MACS buffer, filter the cell suspension through a 40 μm pore cell strainer.\nSetup the LS column on a MACS multistand.\nWash the LS column by 3 mL MACS buffer twice.\nImmediately pour all the cell suspension into the column\nOnce liquid has finished flowing through the columns, wash the column twice with 3 mL MACS buffer.\nCritical: Do not let the column dry.\nRemove the column from the stand and insert it into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. Add 5 mL MACS buffer in the column and flush the column as quick as possible using the supplied plunge.\nCentrifuge at 400 g, 4°C for 10 min. The cell pellet will appear at the tube bottom (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Cell pellet (in red circle) after MACS\nOptional: Repeat steps 26 to 32 if additional microglial purification is required.\nRe-suspend the cell with 100 μL microglia resuspension solution; transfer the cell suspension to a 200 μL tube. Keep the cell suspension on ice until use.",
    "Take 1 μL out of the suspension and dilute it to 100 μL. Count the cell number with a cell cytometry. The common output is about 2 × 105. The purity of GFP-positive cell is typically 80%.\nCritical: The cell suspension must be transferred to the 200 μL tube.\nNote: To get a higher cell purification, we usually perform the fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) by gating the GFP-positive cells.\nStereotactic injection at the unilateral hippocampus\nTiming: 40 min\nClean the operation bench with 75% ethanol.\nTurn on the FST hot bead sterilizer and heat the beads to about 250°C. Insert surgical tools (fine scissors, dressing forceps, needle holders) deep into the beads for at least 20 s. Put the sterilized surgical tools on the sterilized towel paper.\nIntraperitoneally inject the recipient mouse (C57BL/6J that received bone marrow transplantation from Cx3cr1-CreER:DTA mice, age and gender-matched to the donor mouse) with the mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). After the mouse loses refectory response to toe pinching, shave the scalp hair with scissors and apply depilatory cream on the scalp. Two minutes later, clean the scalp with water.\nFix the mouse head on a stereotactic apparatus. Apply iodophor on the scalp with a cotton swab and cut the scalp by scissors to exposure the skull. Use cotton swab to remove the mucosa over the skull till the skull gets dry.\nMark the following location on the skull: −2.00 mm at AP and −1.5 mm at ML with an 18 G needle (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/787-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Illustratration of injection site on the mouse skull",
    "Moisten the skull surface by DPBS. Use a microdrill with a 0.6 mm bore bit to open a dimple at the marked location, using the drill speed at 200 rpm. Carefully remove the thinned skull piece and the underneath dura in the dimple with a 27 G needle.\nCritical: Moistening is key to visualizing major brain surface vasculature. Avoid bleeding and damaging the brain tissue by avoiding stabbing the major vasculature.\nConcentrate the microglia by centrifugation at 100 g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant. Use a cell counter to calculate the amount of microglia resuspension solution (usually with remaining volume less than 5 μL). Control the cell concentration to 1 × 105 cells per μL. Aspirate 0.8 μL concentrated cell suspension into a pre-cooled 5 μL Hamilton syringe equipped with a 30 G needle. Attach the syringe on a micro-pump and set the following injection parameter: injection amount, 0.3 μL; injection speed, 3 min. Connect the syringe with the pump onto the arm of the stereotactic apparatus.\nMove the syringe needle close to the small window on the skull. Insert the needle to the following depths: −1.5 mm and −0.7 mm of the unilateral brain. Start the injection process and infuse 0.3 μL microglia cell suspension at each depth. At the end of the second infusion, hold the needle in place for 1 min, and then slowly withdraw the needle at about 0.02 mm/s.\nMoisten the skull and the scalp with DPBS. Close the scalp together with 4 to 5 sutures, 3 mm apart. Sterilize the suture with iodophor and apply erythromycin ointment on the wound.",
    "Intraperitoneally inject 0.5 mL sterilized saline to the mouse. Put the mouse into a cage laid with sterilized towel paper. Put the cage on a heating pad set at 45°C. Put a few moistened chows near the mouse. Add neomycin into the drinking water (1.1 g/L). Wait till until the mice recovered from anesthesia.\nInject meloxicam (1 mg/kg, disolved in saline) intraperitoneally. Put the cage back to the animal facility.\nPost-operational care\nInject meloxicam (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every 12 h for the first 2 days after the surgery.\nChange the bedding materials every day and keep the cage clean.\nNote: We kept these operated animals outside the SPF environment. However, it is preferable to maintain the moue in SPF environment.\nCheck for any distressing behavior of the mice. If the mice lose 20% of body weight abruptly in a week, ask help from the veterinarian and considering euthanasia.\nFeed the mouse with tamoxifen-formulated chow diet ad libitum for 30 days. Upon tamoxifen treatment, the CX3CR1-CreER::DTA cells are continuously killed and suppressed while the injected CX3CR1+/GFP microglia are not affected."
