    "1. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis\nUploading Protein-interactome Dataset\n\t\nInsert the proteins/genes of interest in a spreadsheet with their unique gene identifiers (preferably gene symbols and gene identifier numbers as obtained with mass spectrometric data).\nAssign one column in the spreadsheet for Gene identifier number and one column for observational value (e.g., Fold-change or p-value). Select the 'contains column header' option to view the column headings.\nUpload the dataset on the IPA by clicking on the upload dataset tab and selecting the spreadsheet mentioned above. Choose the flexible format tab, and select the appropriate category of gene identifier.\n\t\tNote: A flexible format of the dataset overcomes the formatting specifications for uploading.\nAfter the dataset appears, select ID and observation columns. Ensure that all of the proteins (MRP4 interactome as identified by mass-spectrometry) are mapped by checking on the dataset summary tab. The dataset is now ready for the desired analysis.\nData Analysis\n\tNote: Described are the partial uses of IPA features that were utilized for this study.\n\t\nAfter uploading MRP4 interactome with their gene names as the unique identifiers, click on new and choose core analysis in the top left menu of IPA software.\nSet the expression cutoffs value for intensity in accordance with the experiment type (Intensity value of 100 is recommended for analysis).\nCalculate the fold-change in expression while preparing the dataset if control and experimental conditions are involved and include it as part of the dataset file if a comparison analysis needs to be performed (A cut-off value of 1.5 fold change is usually recommended for analysis).",
    "Note: After completion of the core analysis, multiple sections of analyses can be obtained. The first tab shows the summary of the total analyses and suggests top canonical pathways, upstream regulators, molecular and cellular functions, and networks among others; all calculated based on the confidence level (p value) and arranged in ascending order of p value.\nOpen the major canonical pathways (using the open pathway option) as large molecular networks that pictorially show cross talking, overlapping, and affected signaling pathways.\n\t\tLook at the list of the canonical pathways that are majorly involved based on the p-value (p <0.05 is considered as significant).\n\t\tNote: The significance values for the canonical pathways are calculated by Fisher's exact test right-tailed. The significance indicates the probability of association of molecules from the dataset with the canonical pathway by random chance alone.\nConfirm the input proteins (MRP4 interactome as identified by mass-spectrometry) among the list of proteins involved in each pathway.\n\t\tNote: Using this option, it was observed that the cellular actin cytoskeleton signaling network is the major affected pathway and how the input proteins fit into it (Figure 1). This approach helps identify which molecular networks would be closely associated and affected by the test proteins.\nUse the network tab in the analyses to identify the top diseases and functions that are potentially linked to a particular protein network based on the number of focus molecules.\n\t\tNote: A score value is given based on the known proteins that are determined as part of a network e.g., cellular assembly and organization network, through literature knowledge and experimental evidences and focus molecules that are identified from the dataset and become part of the network. Henceforth, the network gets filtered in the first place based on the number of focus molecules.\n2. High-content Microscopy\nPreparation of Cells",
    "Note: All cell culture work was done under the horizontal-flow cell culture hood.\n\t\nUse 96-well microplates for the wound-healing assay.\nCoat the microplate with 1% fibronectin solution (reconstituted in PBS), and keep the plate in a standard CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 hr.\nRemove Mrp4-/- and Mrp4+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) grown in 25 cm² cell culture flasks from the incubator, wash 1 time with PBS, and trypsinize the cells for 5 min using 1 ml of 4x trypsin-EDTA solution.\nWash the cells with complete medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and resuspend them in 5 ml of complete medium.\nAspirate the fibronectin solution from the wells. Count cells using a hemocytometer and seed 30,000 cells (cell number needs to be optimized based on cell type) into each well.\nGrow the cells to 100% confluence in a standard CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nCreating Wound\n\t\nEnsure all the wells are filled with solution. Fill unused wells with PBS to prevent damage to the wound making tool (e.g., WoundMaker).\nAfter confirming 100% cell confluence, place the 96-well plate inside the wound making tool on the metal base plate and press the 96-well pin block down.\nWash the cells three-times with PBS to remove any dislodged cells and add 100 µl of complete medium.\nAdd the test compounds - H-89 (50 µM; 1:1,000 dilution with complete media using 50 mM stock in DMSO) or Latrunculin B (1 µM; 1:1,000 dilution with complete media using 1 mM stock in DMSO) at this stage.\nPlace the assay plate inside the reader at 37 °C and monitor migration over the experimental period.\nMonitoring Cell Migration",
    "Note: Cell migration was monitored using the microscope and software provided with high-content microscopy system. The use of 96-well microplates ensures that the wounds are automatically monitored by the microscope and registered by the software.\n\t\nSet the software to scan the assay plate every hour for migration assays using the schedule scan tab . Select a start time at least 15 min after placing the assay plate inside the reader to allow equilibration prior to imaging.\nSelect the tray and choose vessel type (96-well microplate) and experiment type (Scratch Wound).\nSelect 10X objective and choose phase-contrast imaging parameters. Select the wells that need to be scanned using the edit scan pattern option.\nSpecify the treatments groups and any replicates by selecting the properties tab and setting up a plate map. Scanning can be stopped at any time based on the experimental condition.\nData Analysis\n\t\nAfter the scanning is done, select the vessel view tab for the assay plate. Go to the analysis job utilities and select launch new analysis job.\nSet scratch wound as job type and select the time range for the analysis (0 time point to 24 hr time point).\nSelect the wells to be chosen for analysis by a single click on the well and click 'OK' to initiate the analysis. Once the analysis is done, graphically visualize relative wound density (RWD) data for each well at each time point using export to the graph option.\nView the phase-contrast image set of each well corresponding to different time-points using the view image tab. Select a specific well by clicking on the plate map, select a specific time point from the time range tab and click on the view image tab.\n3. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)\nPreparation of Cells",
    "Coat 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes with 100 µl of 1% fibronectin solution (as described in section 2.1) and keep them in a standard CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 hr.\nAspirate the fibronectin solution from the plates and seed equal numbers of HEK293 cells (10,000 cells/plate) in complete medium.\nGrow the cells to 60-70% confluence in the fibronectin coated glass-bottomed dishes in a standard CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nTransfection\n\t\nPerform all transient transfections using a commercial transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions.\nAliquot 250 µl of complete medium into two separate 1.5 ml sterile centrifuge tubes for each 35 mm dish.\nAdd 2 µg of DNA (pmAKAR3 or pmAKAR3-TA) in one tube and 5 µl (2.5 fold the DNA concentration) of transfection reagent in another tube.\nIncubate the tubes for 20 min at room temperature and then transfer the diluted DNA into the transfection reagent-containing tube.\nMix thoroughly and incubate at 37 °C for another 30 min.\nAspirate the medium off the cells and wash them once with PBS. Add 1 ml of antibiotic-free DMEM F-12 medium containing 10% FBS to the cells.\nAdd 507 µl of DNA-lipid conjugate with media to the cells in each plate, mix gently, and keep in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 48 hr. Use 2 µg of DNA (1 µg/µl stock) and 5 µl lipid for 10,000-50,000 cells in each plate.\nLive-cell Imaging\n\t\nAfter 48 hr of transfection, remove growth medium and wash the cells 2 times with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, pre-warmed at 37 °C). Add a final volume of 1.9 ml HBSS to the washed cells and mount them on an inverted wide-field microscope system for FRET imaging inside a custom-made 37 °C maintained chamber.",
    "Note: In this system, the excitation light is provided by a 300 W Xenon lamp attenuated with a Neutral Density filter with 50% light transmission.\nUse 60X objective. Manually focus on the cells and set an optimal field of view using the microscope. Activate the selected field of view on the computer screen using the Focus \"F\" option on the software. For performing FRET measurements, select the proper filter set (CFP/YFP filter set with a 430/25 nm excitation filter, a double dichroic beam splitter, and two emission filters (470/30 nm for CFP and 535/30 nm for FRET) manually.\nVisualize fluorescence by first checking on the channel option CFP/YFP/FRET followed by clicking open fluor tab. Improve the signal intensity by using the intensification tool in the camera tab.\nSelect cells expressing pmAKAR3 or pmAKAR3-TA avoiding saturation of the signal intensity. Use the capture window to initiate FRET measurement.\nSelect the time-lapse option and setup a time-scan for 30 min with 30 sec interval. Check the FRET option and set the exposure time at 100 msec. Enter the image label and press start to initiate the measurement.\nAfter five time points and establishment of a baseline, add 25 µM of forskolin (5 µl of 10 µM stock in ethanol, diluted with 100 µl of HBSS) to the cells without disturbing the plate and monitor the cells for a total of 30 min.\nData Analysis\n\tNote: Use ratiometric calculation module for data analysis.\n\t\nClick on the select tool on the left-hand side of the image window and choose a solid rectangle from the drop down menu. Drag the rectangle on the image field in a cell free area and right click on it to set it as background for the purpose of background subtraction.",
    "Go to the mask and use 'create a new mask' option. Go to the select tool and choose a pen from the drop down menu to manually draw a mask around the cell to select it for a measurement. Select at least 4-6 cells per condition.\nSelect the Mask tab and perform mask statistics.\nCheck 'Entire mask', expand cross-channel option and select donor normalized FRET (N-FRET) (FRET/CFP). The N-FRET value is representative of PKA activity at the plasma membrane.\nAdd time-stamps, look-up table and scale bar using the annotations.\nSubscription Required.
