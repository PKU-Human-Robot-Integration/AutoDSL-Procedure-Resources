    "Cell synchronization Freshly streak C. albicans strain on a sterile YPD agar plate and incubate at 30 °C for 24–36 h. Inoculate an isolated colony in 5 mL of sterile YPD broth and grow at 30 °C in a shaker incubator for 16 h at 200 rpm. This growth condition has been repeatedly found to cause effective spontaneous synchronization of C. albicans cells (> 90% cell synchronization will be achieved). Critical:  Always pick a single isolated colony and inoculate it in 5 mL of YPD broth for all the strains to be analyzed.Dilute the synchronized culture with YPD broth to obtain an OD600 of 0.2 in a total volume of 10 mL and allow them to grow for up to 150 min at 30 °C and 200 rpm for timewise cell collection.Cell fixation by ethanol Collect 1 mL of C. albicans every 30 min in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 10,621× g for 1 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 1 mL of sterile distilled water. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of sterile distilled water and immediately place it on ice to arrest cell progression.Take 10 μL of culture for cell number counting by using a hemocytometer. Collect approximately 1 × 107 cells from the stock for ethanol fixation. Critical:  When working with multiple strains simultaneously, determine the cell number of any one of the strains (not necessary to count the cell number of every strain). Accordingly, dilute all the strains to get the desired cell number for fixation. As the methodology is standardized for a wide range of cell populations (1 × 106–1 × 108 cells), there will be no issue with minor differences in cell populations between different samples.",
    "Resuspend the counted (~1 × 107 cells) cells in 300 μL of sterile distilled water and add 700 μL of 100% cold ethanol dropwise while vortexing. Vortex gently in between the drops. Caution:  While adding fixative, vortex slowly to ensure good fixative penetration and reduce cell clumping. As the fixation process is an exothermic reaction and heat liberated could damage the sample, fix the cells with cold ethanol only.Incubate the ethanol-resuspended cells at -20 °C for 16–20 h. Critical: C. albicans strains with pseudohyphal and hyphal cells need to be incubated for 24 h.Pause point:  After ethanol fixation, cells can be stored for several months at -20 °C by sealing properly with parafilm.Caution:  Cells can only be stored in ethanol as it will make the cells porous, which helps efficient staining by SYTOX green at later stages. Storing in ethanol also prevents microbial growth during long-term storage. Unlike fixed animal cells that can be stored at 4 °C, fungal cells, due to thick cell walls, must be stored at -20 °C for efficient pore formation.Rehydration of fixed cells Centrifuge the ethanol-fixed cells at 10,621× g for 2 min at room temperature and pipette out the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Caution:  Cells will form a loose pellet after centrifugation; if the pellet is disrupted during aspiration, repeat centrifugation for 1 min at the same g force. Remove the ethanol completely as ethanol presence will hamper downstream RNase A and Proteinase K enzymatic digestion. One should open the cap of the tube carefully for rehydration as ethanol spillage may erase the sample labeling.Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.2), mix by vortexing, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature for rehydration.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 10,621× g for 2 min at room temperature and pipette out the supernatant.Repeat step C2 for complete rehydration and finally resuspend the rehydrated cells in 1 mL of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.4).RNase A and Proteinase K treatment Incubate the rehydrated cells in 25 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A at 37 °C for 12 h for RNA degradation. Critical:  Since SYTOX green can bind to both DNA and RNA, make sure that RNase A is active to cause complete digestion of RNA.After incubation, directly add 25 μL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K into the samples without centrifugation, vortex briefly, and incubate at 50 °C for 1 h. Critical:  Increase the incubation time for an additional hour when working with pseudohyphal and hyphal C. albicans cells. Proteinase K treatment breaks down cellular proteins to produce uniform optical scattering and inactivates nucleases to prevent DNA degradation in the samples.Centrifuge the enzymatically treated cells at 12,745× g for 1 min at room temperature and carefully remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 500 μL of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.4).SYTOX green staining Take 200 μL of SYTOX green from a 5 mM stock and make up the volume to 1 mL with DMSO to make a 1 mM working solution. Add 1 μL of 1 mM SYTOX green working solution to each sample and incubate them at 4 °C for 2 h in the dark. Caution:  Prepare the SYTOX green working solution in an amber color microcentrifuge tube, divide the working solution into 100 μL aliquots, and store at -20 °C. Prevent direct light exposure at the time of staining by covering the FACS tubes with aluminum foil during incubation.Wash the cells with 500 μL of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.",
    "4) and transfer it into properly labeled FACS tubes for acquisition. Pause point:  Stained cells can be stored overnight for next day acquisition as the SYTOX green is a relatively more stable dye than PI.Experimental setup and cell acquisition Perform the routine cleaning of the flow cytometer to avoid contamination and switch on the laser light prior to acquisition. Caution:  Before starting the acquisition, fill the sheath tank and empty the discard tank for uninterrupted acquisition. Switch ON the laser 10 min before starting acquisition to stabilize the laser, which is important for efficient excitation of the fluorochrome.Login to the respective FACS software (BD FACSDiva software), open the workspace, and set up a new experiment. Select the forward-scatter area and height (FSC-A & H) and the side-scatter area and height (SSC-A & H) along with SYTOX green in the Cytometer window and ensure the connectivity status. Critical:  SYTOX green is excited by Blue laser (488 nm) with an emission maximum of 523 nm, which is similar to that of fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC) and Alexa fluor 488; so, one can select FITC or Alexa Fluor 488 if SYTOX green is not listed in the fluorochrome panel of the Cytometer window as cytometer configuration varies from machine to machine.Set up the dot plot of SSC-A vs. FSC-A to eliminate debris and FSC-H vs. FSC-A to discriminate singlet population, along with the histogram plot SYTOX green-A vs. Count to determine the different stages of the cell cycle in the worksheet window.Run a test sample at low flow rate to adjust the voltage of all three parameters (FSC, SSC, and SYTOX green) and determine the events per second. Critical:  Maintain a low flow rate for all samples throughout the acquisition.",
    "Do not change the flow rate to medium or high, and do not acquire samples with different flow rates as that will cause variation in SYTOX green excitation, and the obtained results will be erroneous.Once the experimental setup and voltage setting are stable, acquire all the samples with 50,000 gated events. After the acquisition, clean the fluidics system according to the user’s manual and switch off the laser. Critical:  To avoid cell clumping, place a vortex machine next to the flow cytometer, vortex for a brief period, and then quickly acquire. Maintain 400–500 events/second for all the samples and accordingly dilute the samples with sodium citrate buffer."
