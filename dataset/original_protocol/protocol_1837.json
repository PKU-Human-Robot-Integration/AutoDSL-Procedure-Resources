Also, it\n      is essential to filter all reagents through sterile syringe filter\n      polyethersulfone membrane (PES) units. We recommend using a 0.45 μm pore\n      size to remove larger cell debris followed by a 0.22 μm pore size to\n      remove remaining cell debris and bacterial-size particles. This two-step\n      filtration protocol applies to all reagents and the supernatant of the\n      fecal samples.\n    \n        Preparation of phage suspension (15 min per sample).\n        \n            Pour 40 mL of SM Buffer, previously filtered, into a 50 mL\n            centrifuge tube.\n          \n            Gently pipet the 250 mg of fecal sample and resuspend in RNA later\n            several times until obtaining a homogeneous mixture.\n          \n            Add the whole RNA later + fecal sample mixture to the SM Buffer\n            tube.\n          \n        Remove bacterial debris (40 min).\n        \nCentrifuge at 4700 g for 30 min at 4°C.\n            Carefully transfer the supernatant (it contains the VLPs) to a 5 mL\n            syringe attached to a 0.45 μm PES filter, using a micropipette.\n            Filter the supernatant and collect the filtrate into a new 50 mL\n            centrifuge tube.\n            \nNote: When taking the supernatant\n              with the micropipette, make sure not to disturb the pellet. We\n              recommend using a fine tip and removing the volume very slowly.\n            \n            Filter all the supernatant obtained from the previous step through a\n            0.22 μm PES filter.\n            \nNote: Regularly change the filters\n              to avoid clogging them with cell debris that was not removed by\n              the centrifugation step.\n            \nNote: Do not push too hard with\n              the syringe to avoid breaking the filter.\n            \nPause point: The filtered\n              buffer with VLPs can be stored at 4°C until needed.",
    "Note: Some reports have shown good\n              stability of phages when stored at 4°C in SM buffer for more than\n              six months (Jepson and March, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10];\n              Jończyk et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Similarly, storing at\n              2°C–5°C has shown no significant reduction in phage titer (5%–10%)\n              after six months (Mullan 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\n            \nNote: Check that the SM buffer\n              contains gelatin. It stabilizes VLPs membranes during storage.\n            \n        Enrichment and washing the VLPs (2–3 h).\n        \n            Add 15 mL of the previous buffer with VLPs into an Amicon Ultra-15\n            centrifugal filter (100 KDa).\n          \n            Centrifuge at 5000 g in a fixed-angle centrifuge for 15–60 min at\n            4°C, until the remaining volume reaches ∼200 μL on the top of the\n            Amicon filter unit.\n          \n            Discard the flow-through and add fresh filtrate again to the top of\n            the filter unit.\n          \nRepeat steps a, b and c until the entire buffer is filtered.\n            Add 5 mL of SM Buffer to the top chamber of the Amicon and spin at\n            5000 g at 4°C for 2–5 min to wash the VLPs until the remaining\n            volume reaches ∼200 uL on the top of the Amicon filter unit. Repeat\n            this VLPs washing step (at least five times) until the buffer\n            containing the VLPs is clear.\n            \nNote: Wash several times the VLPs\n              to diminish cellular debris that could inhibit the nucleic acid\n              extraction and their visualization in the microscope. Eight washes\n              of the VLPs allow a more precise visualization of viral particles\n              by electron microscopy (TEM).\n            \n            Discard the collector tube of the Amicon filter unit and pipet the\n            ∼200 μL of VLPs several times to resuspend the VLPs retained on the\n            filter walls.\n          \n            Transfer the total volume ∼200 μL containing the VLPs to a 1.5 mL\n            microfuge tube.\n            \nNote: If the volume in the Amicon\n              filter unit is less than 200 μL, adjust the volume using SM",

The gelatin in SM buffer stabilizes VLPs\n              membranes during storage.\n            \n        Eliminate the remaining bacterial and human cell debris (15 min).\n        \n            Add 40 μL of chloroform to the 200 μL of VLPs and incubate at room\n            temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\n          \n            Centrifuge at room temperature for 5 min at 20,000g to separate the\n            aqueous phase. Take the aqueous phase carefully (it contains the\n            VLPs) with a micropipette and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL microfuge\n            tube.\n          \n        Remove residual bacterial and human DNA (3 h).\n        \n            Eliminate the Non-virus-protected DNA by adding 2.5 units of DNase I\n            per milliliter of VLPs, and incubate at 37.8°C for two hours,\n            following the manufacturer’s procedure.\n          \nInactivate the DNase at 65°C for 10 min.\n            Cool down the reaction on the laboratory table until room\n            temperature (20 min).\n            \nCritical: Do not inactivate\n              the DNase at 75°C; this temperature can damage the VLPs.\n            \nNote: Wash two times the VLPs to\n              clean up remnants of the DNAse reaction.\n            \n            Transfer the previous reaction into an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal\n            filter (100 KDa) and add 15 mL of SM buffer.\n          \n            Centrifuge at 5000 g in a fixed-angle centrifuge for 15–60 min at\n            4°C, until the remaining volume reaches ∼200 uL on the top of the\n            Amicon filter unit.\n          \n            Discard the flow-through, add fresh SM buffer to the top of the\n            filter unit, and repeat step e.\n          \n            Discard the collector tube of the Amicon filter unit and pipet the\n            ∼200 μL of VLPs several times to resuspend the VLPs retained on the\n            filter walls.\n          \n            Transfer the total volume ∼200 μL containing the VLPs to a 1.5 mL\n            microfuge tube.\n            \nPause point: The VLPs can",
    "be stored at 4°C until needed.\n            \nNote: At this point it is\n              recommended to use TEM microscopy to confirm the presence of VLPs\n              and count the number of particles using fluorescence microscopy.\n            \nMicroscopy visualization and VLPs counts\nTiming: 2–2.5 h per sample\n      This step is to corroborate the presence and quantify the VLPs in the\n      samples.\n    \n        Quantify the number of isolated VLPs by epifluorescence microscopy (1.5\n        h).\n        \n            Preparation of the SYBR Green staining solution (5 min).\n            \n                Dilute 5 μL of SYBR Green in 45 μL of nuclease-free water\n                (previously passed through the 0.22 μm PES filtration units).\n              \n            Staining the VLPs of the sample (10 min).\n            \n                Place 10 μL of the VLPs sample in a 0.6 mL Eppendorf tube.\n              \nAdd 2 μL of the SYBR Green solution.\n                Add 10 μL of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde.\n                \nCritical: Paraformaldehyde\n                  is a toxic chemical, and it only should be used in a chemical\n                  fume hood. Waste should be collected and discarded\n                  appropriately.\n                \n            Mounting the VLPs sample on a microscopy slide (5 min).\n            \nPlace 10 μL of stained VLPs sample on a slide.\n                Place a coverslip over the sample, avoiding the formation of air\n                bubbles.\n              \n            Microscopy visualization and quantification of VLPs (Olympus FV1000\n            Multi-photonic confocal microscope) (1h).\n            \n                Place the slide under the microscope and focus on the field at\n                the confocal microscope.
