    "The following protocol complies with the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Vision Research.\n1. Setup and Preparation of Lenses for Ex Vivo Wound Culture\nPlace three 100 mm petri dishes in a sterile, laminar flow hood. Fill two of the petri dishes halfway with Tris/Dextrose buffer (TD buffer; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2PO4, 5 mM D-glucose, 8.25 mM Tris Base, pH to 7.4 with HCl) at RT, leaving the third empty. Pre-warm culture media (Media 199 supplemented with, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) to 37oC.\n\tNote: The standard wound healing culture media is serum-free, as occurs in vivo; however, the wound-repair cultures can be grown successfully in defined media conditions that include serum or other factors.\nRemove fertile embryonic day 15 white leghorn chick egg from incubator (held at 37.7° C with gentle rocking)\nPlace selected egg in the laminar flow hood and clean outside of shell with 70% ethanol from a wash bottle. Conduct all procedures below under aseptic conditions in the laminar flow hood, using sterile solutions and instruments.\nCrack egg and place contents into the empty 100 mm petri dish. Decapitate embryo using standard forceps and fine scissors. Place the chick embryo head in a petri dish containing TD buffer and properly dispose of the remainder of the embryo. Optionally keep the chick embryo heads in TD buffer for a short period of time, no longer than 15 min.",
    "Place the chick embryo head on a petri dish lid. Using high precision forceps, remove the lens along with its attached vitreous humor from the eye in the following sequence. Pinch the back of the eye with the forceps to create a small opening in the back of the eye.\nThen, grasp the vitreous humor with forceps and gently tug on the vitreous with a rolling motion, the vitreous with the lens attached will be dislodged from the eye. Place lens/vitreous in the remaining petri dish containing TD buffer. Allow the lenses to remain in TD buffer for no longer than 30 min.\nMove the lens to a new petri dish lid under a dissecting microscope. From this point on perform all steps under a dissecting microscope. With high precision forceps carefully brush away any ciliary body (pigmented cells) that were dislodged with the lens using the edge of the forceps, taking caution not to damage the lens tissue.\n\tNote: Removing the ciliary body ensures that cell types that are not endogenous to the lens are not included in the wound repair culture.\nSeparate the lens from the vitreous humor with high precision forceps by pinching off the vitreous body from its association with the posterior lens capsule.\nUsing high precision forceps transfer the lens into a small drop of TD buffer (about 200 µl) in a 35mm tissue culture dish.\n2. Performing Mock Cataract Surgery\nOrient the lens in the drop of TD buffer in the 35 mm dish with the anterior aspect of the lens facing up.",
    "Note: The anterior of the lens is easily identified by the presence of a dense ring in the tissue that notes the border between the anterior and equatorial region of the lens epithelium. In contrast, there is an absence of markings on the posterior of the lens capsule to which the lens fiber cells are attached.\nUsing two high precision forceps make a small incision (approximately 850µm) in the center of the anterior lens capsule, the thick basement membrane that surrounds the lens tissue, and its associated anterior lens epithelium, by grasping the tissue with one forceps in each hand and gently tugging in opposing directions.\nRemove the fiber cell mass, which makes up the bulk of the lens tissue, dislodging it from its attachments to the lens epithelium and surrounding lens capsule by hydro-elution (an approach used in classic cataract surgery, modeled in Figure 1A).\nFill a 1 ml syringe with a 27.5 G needle tip with 300 µl of TD buffer. Insert the needle tip into the incision made in the anterior lens capsule, and about halfway into the lens.\nGently depress the syringe injecting the TD buffer into the lens fiber cell mass. Inject between 50 and 200 µl TD, and never more than 300 µl. Observe the fiber cell mass loosening itself from the epithelium and lens capsule.\nUsing high precision forceps, remove the loosened fiber cell mass from the lens through the anterior incision site.\n\tNote: This procedure leaves the posterior lens basement membrane capsule to which the fiber cells had been attached denuded of cells, and an injured lens epithelium just adjacent to this site.\n3. Preparing the Wounded Lens for Ex Vivo Culture",
    "Flatten the lens capsular bag that results from the cataract surgery described above on the culture dish, cell side up, by making five cuts in the anterior aspect of the capsular bag.\nCut perpendicular to the original incision site through to the equator of the lens. Flatten the resultant five “flaps” of lens capsule with attached epithelium on the culture dish capsule side down, cell side up. Note the ex vivo wounded lens now should take on a star or flowerlike shape (see Figure 1B).\nTo secure the capsule to the dish, press softly down with the forceps at each point of the star. This will make a small indentation at the five most outside tips of the explant and result in sustained attachment to the dish.\n\tNote: It is possible to damage the capsule during this procedure and so it is important to secure the capsule to the dish as close to the tips of the flaps as possible, as well as to make the least amount of securing points as possible (generally two, maximum of three per flap).\nRemove the TD buffer from the 35mm dish and replace it with 1.5 ml of pre-warmed media. Cover the 35mm dish with its lid and place in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\n4. Separation of the Central Migration Zone (CMZ), where Re-epithelialization of the Wounded Area of the Posterior Capsule Occurs, from the Original Attachment Zone (OAZ) of Lens Epithelial Cells, for Quantitative Analysis.",
    "Note: The cells begin to move into the CMZ region immediately in response to injury. By day one in culture enough cells are migrating across the CMZ for molecular and biochemical analysis, following separation of the CMZ and the OAZ by micro-dissection23. This protocol involves removal of one flap (OAZ) at a time from the wounded area of the capsule.\nObserve a demarcation, clearly visible under the dissecting microscope, between the OAZ and CMZ (see Figure 2A). Using two high precision forceps, grasp with both forceps at the edge of the OAZ/CMZ line, one just adjacent to the other, on either side of the line (see Figure 2A, B, arrow).\nUsing one hand/one forceps on the CMZ side continue to hold onto the wounded culture, while with the other hand/forceps, gently pull the OAZ along the OAZ/CMZ line. The CMZ easily separates from the OAZ along this line. Continue along this line around the entire culture until the two regions are completely separated.\nStudy the separated OAZ and CMZ fractions for molecular analysis such as RNA-Seq 24 or biochemical analysis such as western blot or co-immunoprecipitation 23,25.\nSubscription Required.
