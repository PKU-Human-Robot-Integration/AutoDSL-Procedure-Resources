    "Following Danish law, an educational study without the participation of patients does not require ethical approval.\n1. Handling of the scope\nHold the bronchoscope in the left hand with the left thumb on the steering lever and the left forefinger on the suction button. Use the right hand to hold the distal part of the bronchoscope.\nHolding the scope with a straight arm and wrist, so the suction button is pointing directly forward and the steering lever is in the neutral position, is defined as the neutral position or 0°. By twisting the wrist, turn the scope from the neutral position/0°.\nMove the thumb up and down the lever to flex and extend the distal end of the endoscope. Move the wrist and hands, not the arm and body.\n2. Structured progress: angle of the scope and the four landmarks\nEnter the airways either through the mouth or nostrils. Pass the vocal cords and enter the trachea.\nFind the four landmarks systematically from landmarks 1 to 4 and note the correct angle of the endoscope in each position (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: The four landmarks approach is designed in a memorable way to decrease the cognitive load for novel bronchoscopists. It is based on a pairing between the angle of the bronchoscope and how to access the different lobes/landmarks. The approach, therefore, provides novice trainees with a basic training tool to navigate through the bronchial maze. As an example, by knowing if the bronchoscope is held at a 90° angle to the right, the correct position to inspect the right upper lobe can be determined. When visualizing the lobe or landmark, one should defer from the designated angle to inspect the individual segments.",
    "Find the segments chronologically from 1-10, the right side first, then the left side according to the four landmarks.\n3. Systematic bronchoscopy: the four landmarks approach\nLandmark 1: The carina with the right and the left main bronchus as seen from the trachea (Figure 2)\n\t\nLocate the bronchoscope in the distal part of the trachea at a 0° angle-the neutral position. If the orientation is lost, go back to landmark 1 to reorientate.\nLandmark 2: Right segments 1, 2, and 3 (upper lobe) (Figure 3)\n\t\nTurn the endoscope 90° to the right while at the same time flexing the distal end of the bronchoscope upward by pushing the left thumb down to investigate the upper lobe. This landmark resembles the Mercedes star.\nWhen visualizing the Mercedes star, defer from the 90° angle to inspect segments 1, 2, and 3.\nLandmark 3: Right segments 4 and 5 (middle lobe) plus 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (lower lobe) (Figure 4)\n\t\nMove on to the bronchus intermedius by placing the distal end of the endoscope at a 45° angle to the right to see segments 4 and 5 (numbers from the lateral side at an oblique angle).\nAgain, defer from the 45° angle to inspect segments 4 and 5. Go back to the 45° angle and extend the tip of the endoscope by pushing the stewing lewer upward with the left thumb to inspect segment 6 (just opposite the middle lobe).\nTurn the scope to a 0° angle and progress to the lower lobe. Segment 7 is located medially, and segments 8, 9, and 10 (numbers from the lateral side at an oblique angle) at the bottom. Defer from the 0° angle to inspect segments 7-10.",
    "Landmark 4: Left segments 1+2, 3, 4, and 5 (upper lobe), plus segments 6, 8, 9, and 10 (lower lobe) (Figure 5)\n\t\nMove the bronchoscope to the left main bronchus (90° angle to the left), upward to see the upper lobe, and downward to see the lower lobe.\nKeep the scope at a 90° angle to inspect the left upper lobe with the lingula. Defer from the 90° angle to inspect segments 1+2 and 3 (left upper lobe) and segments 4 and 5 (lingula).\nGo back to the left main bronchus, turn the scope to a 45° angle, and extend the end of the bronchoscope to inspect segment 6, which is opposite segments 4 and 5 (lingula).\nTurn the scope to a 0° angle to visualize the lower lobe with segments 8, 9, and 10. Defer from the 0° angle to inspect the segments.\n\t\tNOTE: There is no segment 7 on the left side, as this area is filled out by the heart. Segments 4 and 5 plus 8, 9, and 10 follow the same numbering as for the right side, and are numbered from the lateral side at an oblique angle (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required.
