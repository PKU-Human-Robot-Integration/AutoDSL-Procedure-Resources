    "1. Random Au Nanoparticle Array Fabrication 8,10,12,14\nThe Au nanoparticle array is formed by first creating a template that is made of a dense layer of randomly adsorbed latex spheres with mean diameter of 454 nm. This is achieved by first evaporating gold on a glass coverslip to a thickness of 20 nm using chromium as the adhesion layer.\nThe polystyrene sphere monolayer is then self-assembled by exposing the gold-coated substrate to a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), latex sphere suspension and de-ionized water.\nThe adsorption process is allowed to last for about one hour and the non-absorbed spheres are washed away with a copious amount of water.\nThe formed monolayer is allowed to air dry.\nFinally, another 20 nm of gold is evaporated on the latex sphere monolayer to form the random gold nanoparticle array.\nIf an SEM is available, the AuNP array can be seen under the SEM to look like Figure 1 and a diagram of the process is shown in figure 8.\n2. Biological Sample Preparation9,11\nSample preparation for optically trapping mouse cell nuclei is now shown.\n3T3 Mouse cell nuclei tagged with Acridine Orange dye were obtained from the Tewari group at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n10% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is added to the mouse cell nuclei in a concentration of approximately 1 : 10 (BSA : Mouse Cell Nuclei). The BSA helps to prevent the nuclei from sticking to the substrate.\nMix the solution using sonication.\n5 uL of our solution is deposited onto the aluminum grating array coverslip. It is better to perform this step with the aluminum grating on the microscope stage so that you do not have to transport the sample after the solution is deposited.",
    "Two stacks of two 1\"by 1\" coverslips are used to support a fifth coverslip through which the sample is viewed.\nPosition the sample under the microscope for viewing.\n3. Method for Trapping\nThe optical tweezers are constructed by sending a 35 mW helium neon laser through a Zeiss Axio Imager.D1M equipped with a GFP 17 filter set which is modified to allow for 633 nm laser radiation to reach the sample.\nA Zeiss LD EC Epiplan - NEOFLUAR 50x objective is used to image the cell nuclei which are approximately 5 micron in diameter.\nAfter the sample is placed under the objective, focus the microscope on the gold nanoparticle array or diffraction grating.\nTranslate microscope vertically until focus is achieved on the nuclei which you desire to trap.\nPosition laser trap spot over particle and the particle should then maintain its position in the laser spot even when the stage is translated.\n4. Representative Results:\nThe random gold nanoparticle array procedures should deposit a monolayer of AuNP's that can be viewed under an SEM to look like Figure 1. The trapping force created by these plasmonic tweezers can be 10-20 times the force generated by standard optical tweezers. The minimum intensities required by the plasmonic tweezers to achieve particle confinement are shown for particles of various sizes in Figure 4.9,10 The diffraction grating achieved alignment and trapping with 20 times higher trapping efficiency than the gold nanodots and could achieve trapping with as little as 17 uW/um2 (Figure 7).11\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3390/3390fig1.jpg",

Inset shows trap asymmetry in trapping efficiency for translating a 3.87 um polystyrene bead perpendicular and parallel to the rules of the grating. The solid line (large asymmetry) is obtained with incident light polarized perpendicular to the grating, and the dash line (small asymmetry) is obtained with incident light polarized parallel to the grating. The unit is in (pN[mW/μm2]-1). (b)-(d) Trapping demonstration of a fluorescent 590 nm polystyrene bead. The red circle indicates the position of the laser spot as the laser light was too dim to be seen. At first the particle is trapped within the spot at higher power, as the power is lowered the Brownian motion of the particle overcomes the trapping force, allowing the particle to escape.
