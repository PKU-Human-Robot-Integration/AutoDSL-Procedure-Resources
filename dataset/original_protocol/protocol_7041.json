    "The protocol described in this manuscript is summarized in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4223/bioprotoc-11-22-4223-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protocol work flow. Schematic summarizing the major steps of the protocol.See Video 1 for procedure of Leydig cell isolation.  <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Testis isolation, wash, and decapsulation.Sacrifice ten 8-week-old healthy Kunming (KM) mice in a desiccator using CO2 (Leary, 2013). Wait until breathing stops, soak the mice in 75% alcohol for 10 min to sterilize them, and place them on the operating table (Figure 2A).Pull up the skin in the lower abdomen region, cut it horizontally with sterile surgical scissors, locate and remove the testes with sterile forceps, and transfer them into a 50 ml tube containing 30 ml of precooled PBS.Move the testes to the biosafety cabinet, pour testes and PBS into an empty clean cell dish, add 20 ml of PBS (with 1× penicillin/streptomycin solution) to each of the four dishes in advance, and wash the testes four times (Figure 2B).Clamp the testes one by one to an empty cell dish using forceps and puncture the testis with another pointed forceps. Squeeze out the content and place it into a new cell dish containing 20 ml of PBS (Figure 2C). Finally, collect all into a 50 ml tube with 10 ml of collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) solution.Put the tube in a shaking water bath to digest for 7 min at 37°C.Add 20 ml of complete medium to the tube to terminate the digestion at room tempreture (figure 2D).Let the contents settle for 5 min until the seminiferous cords sink to the bottom of the centrifuge tube.Transfer the supernatant to a new 50 ml centrifuge tube, filter it on a 40 μm cell strainer, and centrifuge at 250 × g for 10 min.",
    "After centrifugation, discard the supernatant and add 2 ml of complete medium to resuspend the cells in a tube.Seed the cell suspension evenly into two 100 mm culture dishes containing 5 ml of complete medium.Incubate the dishes in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 1 h (Figure 2E).One hour later, remove the non-adherent cells, and add 6 ml of fresh complete medium to the dish to continue culturing for 24 h (Figure 2F).Twenty-four hours later, discard the original medium, treat the cells with 4 ml of KCl hypotonic solution for 5 min to further remove the myoid cells, and wash with PBS three times.Add 6 ml of fresh complete medium per dish and continue culturing for 48 h (Figure 2G).After 48 h of culture, harvest the Leydig cells for further experiments.Stain for HSD3B enzyme to identify the purity of Leydig cells (figure 2H). Perform total cell counts using a hemacytometer. Approximately 2 million cells can be obtained from ten mice. Harvest approximately 20,000 cells, resuspend them in PBS, smear on the slides, and leave to dry. Add 50-100 μl HSD3B enzyme staining solution to cover the cells and incubate for 30 min at 37°C away from light. Discard the staining solution and wash the slide twice with PBS. Use a TS100 Inverted microscope to capture the images, and perform analysis with ImageJ.Add complete medium (with 1ng/ml LH) to the Leydig cells, and continue to culture for 48 h, following on from step 15. Then collect the supernatants to measure testosterone with I125-testosterone Coat-A-Count RIA kits by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Figure 2I) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Perform immunostaining for Leydig cell markers StAR, HSD3B, and SF-1 (Figures 2J-2L). Fix the cells in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min, wash the cells three times with PBS, permeabilize cells in 0.",
    "5% Triton-X for 10 min, and then block nonspecific adhesion sites using 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Dilute the primary and second antibodies in the antibody diluton solution. Incubate cells with primary antibody solution (such as StAR, HSD3B, and SF-1) overnight at 4°C. Wash with PBS three times and then incubate cells with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Wash with PBS three times and stain nuclei with DAPI. Use a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) to capture the images.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4223/bioprotoc-11-22-4223-g002.jpgFigure 2.
