  "procedures": [
    "1. Dissection of the ventral nerve cord\nDissection and dye filling of the GF can be performed at room temperature. For all dissection steps cold (4°C) saline should be used to slow down cell metabolism and keep the neurons alive longer.\nAnesthetize adult flies (4 days or older) with CO2 or chill them on ice until they are immobilized. Anesthetizing with ice will require more \n time (up to 30 min) but will keep the flies immobilized for longer.\nPlace one fly in a Sylgard coated Petri dish. This dissection requires the use of a high magnification (80-100X) dissection stereomicroscope.\nWith Vannas scissors, remove legs, proboscis, and wings.\nUse coarse forceps and fine insect pins (minutien pins) to orient the fly dorsal side up in the Sylgard dish. Pin the abdomen first and then elongate the animal \n slightly by placing two pins on each side of the neck, behind the head, so that the neck is slightly stretched and accessible (see Figure 2).\nSubmerge the fly in fresh, cold Drosophila saline. Most commonly used Drosophila salines are sufficient for the dissection, however here we used a \n saline described in Gu and O'Dowd, 20064. An air bubble will surround the fly. Remove the air with a syringe.\nMake a short, lateral incision into the dorsal end of the abdomen. Starting at the incision, make a shallow, straight cut along the dorsal midline of the \n abdomen towards the thorax. Then continue the shallow, longitudinal cut in the thorax as precisely as possible along the midline toward the connective. It \n is critical to make the cuts shallow as to not damage the VNC (Figure 1).\nUse two fine insect pins to carefully open the thorax. Spread the body halves apart using the pins and place the pins through the flight muscles (Figure 2).",
    "The thorax should not be opened further as depicted in the Figure 2 to avoid ripping of the cuticle. To ensure a straight orientation of the VNC the pins \n should be placed in the same anterior posterior position on each side.\nAccess to the VNC for dye injection and proper imaging may be obstructed by internal organs. Therefore, use forceps and scissors to remove the stomach, gut, \n heart, and reproductive organs. Pull out the salivary glands lying on both sides of the VNC. Rinse the dissection carefully with fresh saline to remove \n floating tissue and fat.\nRemove the fat body from underneath the cervical connective (CvC). The fat body is best visible at a high magnification. Use fine forceps to carefully \n grasp the tissue from the side and pull it out.\nThe dissection can be performed within 5 to 10 minutes. By using fresh, cold saline the dissected, undamaged nervous system will remain alive for at least one hour.\n2. Intracellular GF fill\nIt is recommended to perform the dye filling as soon as possible after the dissection.\nPlace the Sylgard dish with the dissected fly under an upright microscope with a fixed stage (Figure 3) and a 10x air objective. Center the sample \n with the posterior end of the fly positioned toward the dye fill electrode holder. Use the differential interference contrast (DIC) mode and focus on the \n CvC. The big axons of the GFs should be clearly visible on the dorsal surface of the CvC.\nDilute Lucifer Yellow CH dilithium salt in deionized H2O to a concentration of 1%. Pull a Borosilicate glass electrode with filament to a resistance \n of approx. 60-80 MΩ. The tip of the glass electrode should be long and sharp. Fill the tip of the electrode with 1% Lucifer Yellow solution by placing",
    "the electrode with the end opposite the electrode tip into the Lucifer Yellow solution for approx. 30-60 seconds. Then backfill the electrode with 3M LiCl \n using a Hamilton syringe leaving an air bubble between the dye and LiCl. Connect the dye fill electrode to the head stage.\nInsert a chloride coated silver wire ground electrode into the saline and place the dye fill electrode above the fly parallel to the VNC using a 3D hydraulic micromanipulator. The dye fill electrode should be connected to an amplifier that allows passing current in order to release negatively or positively charged dyes from the electrode by passing hyper- or depolarizing current, respectively.\nSwitch to a 40x water immersion lens and lower the tip of the dye fill electrode onto one of the GFs. The GF axons lay close to the dorsal surface of the CvC. Use a forward (toward the head) movement to insert the electrode into the GF.\nChange your light source to epifluorescent light and switch to a Lucifer Yellow filter. Apply a hyperpolarizing current to the dye fill electrode with the amplifier to inject the Lucifer Yellow into the GF. The quantity of dye injected can be controlled by the amount of current passed as well as the duration the current is passed. To prevent the dye from spilling out of the injection site or damage the GF, it is recommended to inject using a low current (approx 3-5 nA) over 1-5 minutes.\nApply current until the GF terminal in the VNC can be seen clearly (Figure 4A). For trans-synaptic staining of postsynaptic neurons, continue to pass current on until dye can also be seen in postsynaptic neurons. Switch off the current and remove the dye fill electrode.\n3. Representative Results:",
    "A representative dye fill for one GF with Lucifer Yellow is shown in Figure 4A. The image was acquired as an image stack in \nNikon Elements software using a spot camera mounted on the microscope. In this sample current was passed through the electrode for about 2 minutes. \nThe GF is thoroughly filled and the large GF terminal in the thorax is well labeled (Figure 4A, ellipse). No postsynaptic neurons are visible in this case, \nalthough Lucifer Yellow is small enough to pass through gap junctions. If the dye is not injected long enough into the GF then trans-synaptic fills of the \npostsynaptic neurons may not been seen because the signal is too weak to be detected. Neurons postsynaptic to the GFs (Figure 4B, arrow heads) can be \nvisualized more reliably using even smaller neuronal tracers, such as Neurobiotin. Injecting a 7% Neurobiotin in 2 M potassium acetate solution with a \ndepolarizing current for 2 minutes is sufficient to label postsynaptic neurons strongly. Neurobiotin can be visualized for confocal microscopy using \nStreptavidin coupled to dyes of different wavelengths. Because Neurobiotin is not a fluorescent dye, co-injection of Rhodamin-Dextran or Alexa \nhydrazides in the same solution, can be used to monitor a successful injection into the GF (Figure 4C, from Boerner and Godenschwege, 20105).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3080/3080fig1.jpgFigure 1.
