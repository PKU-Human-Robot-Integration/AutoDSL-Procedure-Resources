    "This study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University. H9 hESCs were obtained from the WiCell Research Institute and genetically engineered to tdTomato-tagged cell line.\n1. Generation of human ROs\nCulture the hESCs under feeder-free conditions.\n\t\nCoat one well of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL reagent A (Table of Materials) at 37 °C for at least half an hour following the manufacturer's instructions. Thaw an aliquot of 1x106 hESCs.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare 3 mL of pre-warmed reagent B (Table of Materials) and transfer the cryopreserved cells (1 mL) into 3 mL of fresh medium. Do not pipette the hESCs to single cells.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nSeed the cells into the reagent A-coated plate with 2 mL of reagent B and change 2 mL of reagent B daily. Passage cells when reaching approximately 80% confluency (usually around 4 days).\nDay 0\n\t\nDissociate hESCs to a single-cell suspension using medium I (Table 1). Prepare medium I by mixing the following: 20% (v/v) KnockOut serum replacement (KSR), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids solution (NEAA), 1 mM pyruvate,3 µM IWR-1-endo (IWR1e), 30 ng/mL COCO, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin (PS), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and Glasgow's Eagle's minimal essential medium (GMEM).\n\t\tNOTE: Before the start of the dissociation, prepare medium I and transfer 12 mL of medium I with 20 µM Y-27632 into a 10 cm Petri dish, 500 µL of reagent C (Table of Materials) containing 0.05 mg/mL of reagent D (Table of Materials) and 20 µM Y-27632 in a 1.5 mL tube. Perform the above steps in the dark, as component IWR1e in medium I is light-sensitive.\nWash the hESCs with pre-warmed 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) buffer.",
    "Add the prepared 500 µL reagent (in the 1.5 mL) tube and incubate the hESCs for 3.5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDetach the cells by flicking the side and bottom of the plate for a few seconds and add 500 µL of prepared medium I from the Petri dish into the hESC plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare a 1.5 mL tube with 900 µL of 1x DPBS and use a hemocytometer for cell counting.\nHarvest the cells in a new 1.5 mL tube and pipette the cell suspension up and down and then take out 100 µL from the tube and then add into the tube with 900 µL of DPBS for cell counting.\nDisperse the left 900 µL cell suspension and then dilute the cells with prepared medium I in the Petri dish to 9 x 104 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The whole volume of the medium is 12 mL; 1.08 x 106 cells are needed in total.\nAdd 100 µL of cell suspension to each well of a non-adherent, V-bottom, 96-well plate (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a multichannel pipette to shorten the time and ensure that each well contains an equivalent cell number. Shake the Petri dish each time before removing 100 µL portions. It is important that the cells are uniformly distributed.\nLightly spin down the 96-well plate in a low-speed shaker for 5 min and then incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the plate in dark. Set the day as day 0.\nDay 2\n\t\nAdd 1% reagent A (Table of Materials). Prepare reagent A (protein concentration of 10 mg/mL) by adding 133.4 µL of reagent A into 2 mL of medium I.",
    "NOTE: Maintain reagent A at 4 °C overnight before use to achieve complete and uniform melting. Please note the product information and search the catalog number the and the lot number in the official website of the company to have the protein concentration of reagent A as each bottle of reagent A is at a different protein concentration. If the protein concentration is low, an increased volume of reagent A would be helpful.\nAdd 20 µL of prepared reagent A to each well and pipette twice in the center to scatter the dead cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Maintain the reagent A and the 96-well plate under cool conditions and complete all the steps on ice. Place the plate in dark.\nDay 2-12\n\t\nClean the bottom of the 96-well plate and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until day 6. At day 6, change half of the medium by removing 58 µL of the medium from each well and adding 60 µL of medium I.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a multichannel pipette to complete the half medium change. Conduct this step gently to ensure that no cell pellets are removed from the well. Aspirate the medium into a clean 10 cm Petri dish. If there are cell pellets inside, add them back to the 96-well plate.\nDay 12- 18\n\t\nChange the medium to medium II (Table 1) at day 12. Prepare medium II using 1% (v/v) reagent A by mixing the following: 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM pyruvate,100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 nM SAG dihydrochloride and GMEM. Store it under cool and dark conditions.\nHarvest the cell pellets in a 15 mL conical tube from the 96-well plate and allow the pellets to settle naturally for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: Remove the medium and pellets gently under the surface to avoid bubbles.\nRemove the supernatant while taking care of the organoids. Transfer the cell aggregates to a 10 cm suspension dish containing 18 mL of prepared medium II with reagent A.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add the prepared medium II into the 10 cm dish in advance, as the reagent A should be at 4 °C.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until day 18.\nFrom day 18 onwards\n\t\nChange the medium to medium III (Table 1). Prepare medium III under dark conditions by mixing the following: 10% FBS, 1xsupplement 1, 0.5 µM retinoic acid (RA), 100 µM taurine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)/nutrient mixture F-12.\nOn day 18, when a semitransparent optic vesicle is generated, cut the organoids using a microsurgical knife.\n\t\tNOTE: Cleave the organoid, usually into four pieces, in a Petri dish with medium II. Each piece should grow into an intact optic cup in the following weeks.\nAggregate all the pellets to the center of the dish. Harvest the cells into a 15 mL conical falcon tube and allow natural settling. Then gently remove the supernatant.\n\t\t​NOTE: Due to their sizes, organoids can be aggregated at the center by rotating the Petri dish in one direction for 90° on a horizontal plane a few times.\nSuspend and disperse the pellets in two 10 cm Petri dishes, with 18 mL of medium III per dish, and gently transfer the dishes to the incubator to avoid cell aggregation. Continue culturing in medium III at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and change the medium weekly. The CRX expressed after day 45 and until day 120, we could detect the out-segment of the photoreceptor.\n2. Analyzing human ROs",
    "FACS analysis\n\t\nAssemble three CRX-tdTomato and three H9 ES-derived organoids from the dishes by using the cut 1 mL tips. Wash the organoids with 1 mL of pre-warmed (room temperature) DPBS.\nPrepare the digestion buffer by mixing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA Solution with 0.05 mg/mL of reagent D.\nDissociate the organoids into single cells by using the prepared digestion buffer for 8 min at 37 °C. Then add the same volume of DPBS with 10% FBS and 0.05 mg/mL of reagent D to inactivate the reaction.\nLightly suspend and scatter the cells and then filter using a 100 µm cell strainer and use a Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) system at 561 nm excitation laser line and 780/60 filter to analyze the CRX-tdTomato positive signals.\n\t\tNOTE: CRX initially expresses at day 45 and increases with the maturation of organoids. Ten thousand cells are used for each test, for each timepoint, at least three repeats are completed.\nFluorescence intensity quantification of ROs\n\t\nPrepare the viable organoids randomly for imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: Set the parameters and use the same filters and parameters for all the fluorescence intensity monitors.\nCapture images and analyze the mean fluorescence intensity using suitable software (e.g., ImageJ).\nImport the images and then convert to 8-bit using Image | Type.\nAdjust the threshold by using the default parameters by Image | Adjust | Threshold.\nDetermine the measured area and then evaluate the gray value by using Analyze | Measure.\n\t\tNOTE: The mean values in the result panel are the mean fluorescence intensity of the measured area.\nSubscription Required.
