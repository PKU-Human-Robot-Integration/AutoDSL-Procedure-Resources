Either dissection strategy works well. The decision to bulk fix flies prior to dissection or dissect fresh brains prior to fixation is largely based on timing preferences i.e. if all of the flies need to be processed at the same time, then bulk fixation is the preferred method.\nNote: Be sure to remove as much of the air sac as possible, which can otherwise result in floating brains.",
    "Critical: Take care when replacing solutions within the Eppendorf containing fly brains, otherwise aspiration of fly brains may happen. To minimize this possibility, allow brains to sink following replacement of solution, and place the pipette away from the brains while leaving a residual amount (~50 μL) of solution each time.\nCritical: Whole-fixed fly brains are a little more brittle than fresh ones, be careful while dissecting to minimize inadvertent tissue damage.\nPause point: Prior to brain dissections, fixed whole flies can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C for up to several days. Dissected brains can also be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C for several days.\nWhole-brain staining and mounting: Day 1–day 2\nTiming: 15 min preparation + 16–24 h incubation\nFor standard staining to detect frank neuronal atrophy, only phalloidin and DAPI staining are required. Additional immunohistochemistry can be performed on the same brains for the study of additional proteins of interest. If additional immunohistochemistry is performed, do so prior to incubation with phalloidin and DAPI.\nPrepare phalloidin and DAPI cocktail in 0.5% PBS-T (580 μL per 600 μL Eppendorf)\nDAPI is used at a 1:1000 concentration\nAlexa Fluor conjugated phalloidin is used at a 1:100 concentration\nApply 400 μL phalloidin + DAPI cocktail (0.5% PBS-T) per Eppendorf tube of fly brains and incubate tubes upright 16–24 h at 4°C with nutation\nFollowing 16–24 h incubation, wash fly brains 4 times with 580 μL 0.5% PBS-T, 15 min each with nutation at 20°C–23°C.\nFollowing the final wash in 0.5% PBS-T, wash fly brains in 580 μL 1× PBS for 30 min with nutation at 20°C–23°C to remove residual detergent\nMount fly brains anterior side up on Superfrost Plus microscope slides with SecureSealTM imaging spacer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/883-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(A) Brains are positioned in a uniform fashion at 45° to maximize the field of view for microscopy and minimize space on the microscope slide. Alternatively, for mispositioned brains, most microscope imaging software have a rotation function that can be used to fully capture the entire brain’s field of view. Scale bar = 1 mm.\n(B) Cartoon schematic of physiologically normal holes.

Allow the mountant to perfuse throughout the well and in between the coverslip and spacer. Avoid air bubbles.\nSeal perimeter of coverslip with nail polish and allow nail polish to dry before storing or imaging\nOptional: Any combination of fluorophore tagged phalloidin and nuclear stains can be used. If performing additional immunohistochemistry, the same fluorophore for phalloidin and nuclear stains can be used depending on the number of available detectable microscope channels.",
    "Optional: If additional immunohistochemistry is performed, additional steps including blocking in normal serum is required. If additional antibody staining is performed, longer incubation steps are needed for sufficient antibody penetration. Additional methods can be found in (FlyLight 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPause point: Stained fly brains can be stored for an extended period of time in 1× PBS at 4°C for several days before mounting onto microscope slides. Slides can be stored at 4°C but should be placed horizontally to avoid movement of brains within the spacer and kept covered to minimize light exposure.\nWhole-brain imaging: Day 3\nTiming: 5–10 min per brain\nPerform two-photon imaging of the vacuoles in the Drosophila whole-brain scanning at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 with a Z-step of 1 μm. Using these parameters, an entire Drosophila brain corresponds to ~150–180 Z-sections. Total image acquisition typically takes 8–10 min per brain.\nNote: Drosophila whole-brain imaging is performed using an Olympus Fluoview two-photon system fitted with a water immersion two-photon objective XLPLN25XWMP, which has a working distance of 2 mm and N.A. of 1.05. We set the IR laser at 780 nm wavelength to simultaneously excite the DAPI and Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin, which will be collected by two non-descanned detectors with specific filters for FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and Alexa Fluor 594, respectively. Here, DAPI fluorescence is collected by FITC channel since DAPI emission spectrum overlaps with FITC. If performing additional antibody staining, DAPI and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin can be detected using the FITC, and an additional antibody of interest can be detected using the red channel.",
    "Note: Maintain consistent laser strength and detection settings across all samples being compared. The adult Drosophila brain is less than 200 μm thick (A-P) after mounting. Set scanning depth to cover the entirety of the brain (this should be adjusted for each individual brain sample). If signal strength is low within the deeper portion of the tissue, a depth compensation protocol within the imaging software may be utilized to increase signal intensity. A laser strength between 2–3% is typically sufficient within our imaging setup.\nNote: While standard laser scanning confocal imaging can be performed, it does generate weaker signals in the deeper layers of the brain due to deflection and absorption of the excitation laser reaching the deeper layers and the loss of emission signals. Therefore, one needs to compensate by increasing the laser intensity for deeper layers and gain of the detector. Most of the current confocal systems have a built-in function for the depth-compensation imaging routine as well. We find that a two-photon (2P) laser can sufficiently penetrate the whole Drosophila brain and generates similar levels of fluorescence throughout the whole brain. Therefore, 2P imaging is recommended for this work. It should also be noted that the standard FITC/TRITC filter set can be used with the caveats that there will be some bleed-through of DAPI signals to the TRITC channel as well as the less than optimal collection of Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence.\nNote: 2P sectioning of the whole brain can be done at increased Z-resolution by reducing the Z-step.\nPause point: Mounted slides can be stored (4°C) for several days to weeks before significant deterioration of signal strength. Protect from light to minimize signal loss.\nWhole-brain vacuole analysis in image J: Day 4\nTiming: 5–10 min per brain\nImport stack of images into Fiji (Image J)",
    "Using the wand(tracing) tool within Fiji, isolate vacuoles at their largest area and assign them as regions of interest (ROIs). Adjust tolerance as needed within the tool to best select each vacuole. Within the ROI manager, save each set of ROIs per brain as its own “.zip” file. Upon completion of the stack, select all ROIs per given brain and perform Measure (with Area selected within Set Measurements) and save Results as “.csv”. Import measurement data within preferred stats package.\nNote: The primary criteria for determining pathogenic vacuoles includes hole location and shape. For location, we refer to the arrangement of physiologically normal holes which often appear in a stereotypical location, which is almost always symmetrical in nature. For assessing shape, we examine whether the hole is oval or spheroid in appearance, which is indicative of pathogenic vacuole, or tubular in nature, which corresponds to air sac conduit. Examining sequential frames of the stack is important for determining the overall shape of holes of interest. Holes that appear on the surface of the brain, which assume a crater-like appearance, do not have a defined enclosure and as such are not considered pathogenic vacuoles. Please refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C for location of the most prominent physiologically normal holes found within the fly midbrain.
