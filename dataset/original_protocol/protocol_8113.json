    "Note: Photosynthetic complexes such as FCPs are highly vulnerable to light and heat. Always work on ice and under a very dim light.\n1. Isolation of FCP from Cells\nThylakoid isolation from C. meneghiniana cells\nGrow C. meneghiniana in five 500 mL flasks each filled with 300 mL of ASP-medium23,25 and 50 million cells. Plug the flasks with a cotton stopper and allow the cells to grow to the exponential growth phase for approximately one week on a shaker at 120 rpm with a 16 h light and 8 h dark phase at 40 µmol photons/(m²s) white light and a temperature between 15-18 °C. Check that the cell number is between 1.5-2 million cells/mL with a cell counter chamber.\nCentrifuge the cells at 4,000 x g in a precooled rotor with 500 mL centrifuge vials (4 °C) for 15 min in a high-speed centrifuge. Re-suspend the cell pellets in 12 mL of homogenization buffer (HB, Table 1) by pipetting.\n\t\t\nTransfer the suspension to a single 50 mL plastic tube. Store the samples at -80 °C or proceed to step 1.1.3.\nPre-cool the bead mill and equipment. Fill the 50 mL beaker of the bead mill to 75% with a glass bead mixture and add the cell suspension. For cell disruption, use 7 x 45 s pulses at full speed with 30 s of cooling between each pulse. Take 20 µL of disrupted cells for quality checks in step 1.1.6.\nFilter the disrupted cells over a glass filter funnel and wash by pouring the HB over the glass beads until they appear clear. Pool the wash fraction with the filtrate. Keep the final volume lower than 150 mL.",
    "Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 140 x g using three 50 mL plastic tubes to pellet the cell debris. Carefully transfer the supernatant to 20 mL polycarbonate ultracentrifugation vials and discard the pellet.\n\t\t\nFill the vials with HB, equilibrate the weight, and centrifuge in a suitable rotor for 1 h at 300,000 x g and 4 °C to pellet the thylakoid membranes.\nUse the centrifugation time to check the proportion of disrupted cells by microscopy at 400X magnification with the 20 µL sample taken in 1.1.3. Calculate the ratio between chloroplast free and chloroplast containing frustules (silica shells).\n\t\tNote: Diatom cell walls are made of silica, which is visible as highly diffracting substance in the microscope. Chloroplasts occurring as green dots should have been released from the cells if the cell disruption worked.\nRe-suspend the membrane pellet with as little washing buffer as possible (0.5-1 mL) using a small painter’s brush. Fill the polycarbonate ultracentrifugation vials with washing buffer (Table 1), equilibrate their weight and centrifuge for 20 min at 200,000 x g and 4 °C.\n\t\t\nRe-suspend the washed membranes with a painter’s brush. Add washing buffer only if needed to keep the thylakoid concentration as high as possible. Pool all thylakoids in one sample vial (15 mL).\nPre-dilute the samples using 10 µL of the sample with 90 µL of 100% acetone. Centrifuge it at 12,000 x g for 5 min to pellet precipitated protein. Take 10 µL of the predilution and mix it with 990 µL of 90% acetone.\n\t\t\nMeasure the absorbance (ABS) of chlorophyll a and c at 664 nm and 630 nm in 90% acetone. Subtract the ABS750nm from both values. Determine the total chlorophyll content using the following formula:24\n\t\t\t1)       imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58017/58017eq1.jpg\n\t\t\t2)       imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58017/58017eq2.jpg",
    "Aliquot thylakoids in portions of 0.5 mg of total chlorophyll in a 1.5 mL reaction tubes, freeze them in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C until further use.\nSeparation and concentration of FCP complexes\nPrepare a sucrose gradient solution and fill the ultracentrifuge tubes until the top minus the loading volume (300 – 500 µL). Freeze the tubes at -20 °C until they are completely frozen. Allow the tubes to thaw at +4 °C, which takes 3-4 h for a 17 mL tube.\n\t\t\nRepeat the freeze-thaw cycle twice to refine the gradient for better resolution.\nUse the samples obtained in 1.1.9 corresponding to 0.5 mg of chlorophyll and adjust with buffer B1 (Table 1) to a final volume of 2 mL. For solubilization, add n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (b-DDM) to a final concentration of 20 mM.\n\t\t\nInvert the tube 3 times and place it on ice for 20 min with gentle shaking to avoid foam. Centrifuge for 5 min, at 12,000 x g in a pre-cooled table top centrifuge at +4 °C.\nLoad the supernatant on the gradient. Do not load more than 125 µg of total chlorophyll per gradient if 17 mL vials are used. Centrifuge for 22 h at 100,000 x g and +4 °C.\n\t\t\nRecover the desired brown FCP fractions from the gradient using a syringe (Figure 2A). Take a 5 µL aliquot and dilute it with 995 µL of B1a.\nMeasure the absorbance (ABS) spectrum between 370 - 750 nm in a UV-VIS-spectrophotometer. Use semi-micro optical glass cuvettes.\n\t\t\nOpen the spectra manager software, go to spectrum mode and record a baseline from 370 to 750 nm followed by sample measurements. Use the following settings: scan speed, 200 nm/min; data pitch, 0.5 nm; response, medium.",
    "Measure the volume of the recovered sample with a micropipette. Wash the FCP complexes by adding twice the recovered volume with B1 buffer (Table 1). Concentrate in a membrane concentrator with a 30 kDa cutoff at 1,000 x g and +4 °C to an ABS672nm of at least 20.\nNote: The b-DDM concentration might rise due to micelle enrichment in the sample compartment. This could lead to further solubilization of the FCP complexes! Avoid over-solubilization by adding detergent free buffer B1 if further washing steps are required to remove residual sucrose.\nTake a 20 µL aliquot for the controls. Shock freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58017/58017fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Purification of FCP, spectroscopic controls and purity check. (A) Typical appearance of a sucrose density gradient after overnight centrifugation. All brown bands contain the FCP pool consisting of FCPa and FCPb. pigm.- unbound pigments, PS - photosystems (B) Absorbance spectra of FCP before (blue line) and after (orange-dashed line) concentration using centrifugal filter devices with 30 kDa cutoff. Particularly, carotenoids are prone to loss from the FCP, which would result in lower absorbance in the region between 500-550 nm. Graphs are normalized to the chlorophyll Qy maximum at ~670 nm. (C) Chlorophyll a emission spectra with excitation of chl c (465 nm) for testing the functional excitation energy transfer. If the energy transfer of chl c to chl a is hampered, an additional fluorescence band at ~640 nm (chl c) would occur. Graphs are normalized to the emission maximum. (D) Excitation spectra recorded at 675 nm (chl a fluorescence maximum) for testing the energy transfer to chl a from all pigments absorbing between 370 nm and 600 nm. If the energy transfer to chl a is less efficient, the fluorescence yield would decrease especially between 465 and 550 nm. The graphs are normalized to the maximum around 440 nm. The spectra in (B), (C) and (D) are nearly identical if the concentration worked well. (E) Check for purity of the isolated FCP using a Tris-tricine gel28. FCPa and FCPb have subunits between 18-19 kDa. All visible silver-stained proteins larger than 20 kDa are contaminants.

    "Record the absorbance between 370-750 nm of 5 µL of FCP in 995 µL of B1a after step 1.2.5. Compare it with the spectrum obtained in step 1.2.4. Use the same instrumentation and settings as described in step 1.2.4.\n\t\t\nExport data as *.csv and import the data into a spreadsheet. Normalize both spectra to the maximum of chl a in the Qy band of around 672 nm as depicted in Figure 2B.\nCalculate the dilution factor of the samples from step 1.2.4 and 1.3.1 by dividing the measured ABS672nm by the desired ABS672nm of 0.03. Dilute the samples accordingly with B1a and transfer them to special glass fluorescence cuvettes.\nRecord chl a fluorescence emission spectrum with a spectrofluorometer to reveal intact light energy transfer from chl c to chl a (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\nUse the spectrometer software and go to the spectrum measurement mode with the following settings: mode, emission; slit width excitation and emission, 3 nm; sensitivity, medium; scan speed, 100 nm/min; data pitch, 0.5 nm; excitation wavelength, 465 nm; emission, 600-800 nm. Perform autozero and measure.\nRecord excitation spectra with the same sample and equipment to reveal intact energy transfer from all pigments to chl a (Figure 2D). Change settings to: mode, excitation; emission wavelength, 675 nm; excitation, 370-600 nm. Record the spectra.\n\t\t\nCorrect with a rhodamine spectrum in the same range for spectral properties of the lamp – cf. instructions in the user manual.\nMix FCP samples corresponding to 1 µg of chl a with 10 µL of SDS-loading buffer. Incubate for 10 min at 25 °C. Centrifuge for 5 min at 12000 x g in a table top centrifuge.\n\t\t\nLoad the supernatant on a Tris-tricine gel28. Separate it for 2 h at 150 V and silver-stain it after separation40.",
    "Note: The FCP subunits separate into two prominent protein bands between 18-19 kDa, which are constituents of FCPa and FCPb29 (Figure 2E).\n2. Preparation of Liposomes and Incorporation of FCP\nPreparation of the lipid mixture and lipid detergent micelles\n\tNote: Lipids are susceptible to warm temperatures combined with oxidative conditions. Try to keep the lipids chilled and under an N2 atmosphere.\n\t\nCalculate the desired thylakoid lipid ratios for C. meneghiniana according to Vieler et al. 200730. Refer to the example given in Supplemental Table 1. Prepare the lipid stock solutions recommended by the manufacturer in a solvent proof container.\nPipette the desired amount of lipids in a 2 mL reaction tube and evaporate the chloroform using a gentle nitrogen flow and try to spread the lipids over the whole area of the tube base. Let the N2 flow until all solvent is evaporated.\nSolubilize the lipid mixture in 29 µL of n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside solution (OG) at 4 °C for 4 h. Incubate the lipid mixture for 10 min at 30 °C. Incubate the lipids in a sonicator bath for 3 x 3 min at 25 °C interrupted by 30 s on ice.\n\t\t\nAdd 221 µL of tricine buffer and 250 µL of 4x dialysis buffer.\nUse an extruder with 0.1 µm polycarbonate membranes for a defined liposome diameter of 50-70 nm. Assemble the extruder with the membrane and filter support. Avoid air bubbles and tighten the assembly thoroughly.\nFill one syringe with 4x dialysis buffer and pre-wet the extruder until no bubbles can be seen in the second syringe.\nApply the lipid-detergent-micelles to the extruder and press the solution from one syringe to the other forth and back. Repeat this step 5 times until the solution appears homogenous.",
    "Note: This solution can be stored at 4 °C for several days. Do not freeze!\nIncorporation of FCP complexes and removal of detergents and aggregates\nNote: In this example we use a lipid/chl a ratio of 12:1, which corresponds to a lipid/protein ratio of roughly 100:1.\n\t\nAdd FCP equal to 20 µg of chl a in a total volume of 500 µL of B1a buffer to 250 μL of the extruded lipid-micelles and 250 µL of 4x dialysis buffer. Incubate the samples for 3 x 3 min at 25 °C in a thermomixer at 1,500 - 3,000 rpm interrupted by a 30 s pause on ice.\nCut the lid of four 1.5 mL reaction tube just under the top giving a ring which still fits on the lid. Prepare 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm pieces of dialysis membrane and wash them in 20 mL of 1x dialysis buffer\nFill 250 µL of the sample to each lid. Carefully, lay the membrane on the lid so that the compartment is completely filled with the sample and no air bubbles occur. Tighten the reaction tube ring on the assembly in order to have a closed compartment.\nDialyze the samples in 50 mL of 1x dialysis buffer overnight (12-16 h) on ice on a tumbling shaker. Replace the used dialysis buffer with fresh one and add 7 mg of adsorbent beads to remove the remaining detergents for at least 6 h.\nReplace the dialysis buffer again and dialyze for another 12 h. Recover the liposomes by piercing the dialysis membrane with a 200 µL micropipette tip and aspirate all liposomes from the reaction tube lid.",
    "Optional step: If high purity (>95%) is needed. Prepare a discontinuous density gradient in 17 mL ultracentrifugation vials with steps containing 6%, 10%, 15% and 20% sucrose epichlorhydrin copolymer in dialysis buffer. Load the liposomes on top and ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 4 h in a swinging bucket rotor.\n\t\t\nRecover the upper brown band with a syringe, dilute the sample 1:5 with DP and proceed to the next step.\nCentrifuge the FCP liposomes in at least 2 mL of 1x dialysis buffer for 1.5 h at 100,000 x g and 4 °C. Recover the liposomes by turning the centrifuge tube at an angle of 45°. Allow the liposomes to move down for 1 min (Figure 3A).\nRecover the FCP liposomes in a final volume of 25-50 µL. Avoid disturbing the precipitate.\nControls 1: absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy\nAdd a 3 µL aliquot of the FCP-liposomes to a 1 mL final volume of 1x dialysis buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 12,000 x g.\n\t\t\nRecord the absorbance between 370 and 750 nm of FCP-liposomes with the same equipment as described in 1.2.4. Normalize the spectrum to the maximum in the Qy region of chl a (670-680 nm) and compare it to the normalized spectrum of solubilized FCP (Figure 3C).\nPrepare FCP-liposomes in 1 mL of DP with an absorbance (ABS)=0.03 with respect to the maximum between 670-680 nm. Adjust the solubilized FCP in detergent from step 1.2.6 to the same ABS diluting with B1a.\nRecord absorbance spectra of both samples as described in 1.2.4. Record chl a fluorescence emission spectrum of both samples as described in 1.3.3.\nNote: The fluorescence yield is decreased in the FCP-liposome sample (Figure 3D and cf. discussion.)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58017/58017fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Isolation of FCP proteoliposomes followed by spectroscopic controls and confocal imaging. (A) Recovery of FCP liposomes after centrifugation. Turn the centrifugation tube to 45° and wait approximately 1 min - the liposomes will move down whereas the FCP aggregates which are not incorporated into liposomes stick to the tube wall. (B) Comparison of absorbance spectra of solubilized FCP in detergent (blue) and FCP in liposomes (orange) (C) The same spectra as in (B) normalized to chl a maximum in the red region (~670 nm - Qy peak); solubilized FCP in detergent (blue) and FCP in liposomes (orange). Potentially, there could be a pigment loss mainly of carotenoids visible in the 500-550 nm region. The clustering of FCP in the liposomes may lead to a peak broadening and a slight shift of the chl a maximum (~670 nm) to the red. (D) Emission spectra of solubilized FCP in detergent and FCP in liposome. Clustering of FCP in the liposome enhances energetic interactions of FCP complexes which lowers the fluorescence yield (orange curve) and shifts the emission maxima slightly to the red.
