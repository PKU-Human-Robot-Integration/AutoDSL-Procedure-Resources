    "1. Fin fabrication\nBuild a fin mold based on the desired shape design.\n\t\nDesign and build a custom 3D-printed gloss-finished mold of fin shape (Figure 1). See STL files for fabricating the mold in Supplementary Coding Files 1-4.\nInsert structural elements into the mold, such as a 3D-printed rigid plastic leading-edge spar. See the STL file of the spar in Supplementary Coding File 2.\nMix PDMS (see Table of Materials) in the desired part ratio.\n\t\nSelect the part ratio of base elastomer to curing agent (i.e., 10:1 or 20:1) to achieve higher or lower elastic modulus, respectively. Weigh the corresponding amounts of base and hardener.\n\t\tNOTE: Both 10:1 and 20:1 (elastomer to curing agent) were used in the present study.\nMeasure the fluorescent pigment (see Table of Materials) such that the total mixture contains 0.1%-1% pigment by weight, depending on the desired brightness of pigmentation. Add the pigment to the PDMS blend.\nPour the measured amounts of elastomer, hardener, and pigment into a planetary centrifugal mixer (mixing at 423 x g for 30 s and de-aerating at 465 x g for 30 s) and mix accordingly.\nCast the fin in the mold.\n\t\nDegas and pour the PDMS mixture into the mold for the fin. Place the mold into the oven at 70 °C for 45 min, and let it cure overnight at 37 °C.\nOnce the curing is complete, remove the cast fin from the mold (Figure 2).\nPerform tensile testing following the ASTM standard39.\n\t\nFor each fin cast in Step 1.3., cast one Type IV specimen using the same PDMS and pigment blend in a Type IV shaped mold using the previously described Steps 1.1.-1.3.",
    "NOTE: See the STL files to cast the Type IV specimen in Supplementary Coding File 5 (mold shown in Figure 1C), and see Figure 3 for examples of the Type IV samples tested.\nClamp the test specimen into the tensile testing machine (see Table of Materials). Measure the initial length, width, and thickness (mm) of the narrow sample section.\nSubject the test specimen to tension in 5 mm increments, ensuring that the sample remains stretched in the elastic region only, not overstretched. Decrease the tension in 5 mm increments until the total sample displacement is 0 mm (original position). Record the lengths (mm) and forces (N) of the narrow section at each increment.\nTo calculate the elastic modulus of the sample, plot the stress-strain curve and determine the best linear fit and R2 value.\n2. Experimental setup and trials\nMount the PLIF hardware (see Table of Materials) to a rectangular glass water tank (2.41 m x 0.76 m x 0.76 m).\n\t\nMount and use a pulsed laser system (see Table of Materials) to generate a planar light sheet intersecting the tank at its mid-plane at a specified frequency (30 Hz), as shown in Figure 4.\nMount and use a 4 MP charge-coupled device (CCD) camera equipped with a lens (35 mm) and a longpass fluorescence filter (560 nm) (see Table of Materials).\nCalibrate the micrometer-to-pixel conversion by taking a single image from the CCD camera with a ruler placed in the laser sheet plane (Figure 5). Select two positions on the camera and divide the distance in micrometers by separating pixels. Ensure this micrometer-to-pixel ratio is small enough (sub-millimeter) for the application.",
    "Synchronize the laser pulses and camera images with the flapping fin using trigger outputs from the fin software and signals from a delay generator and associated software (see Table of Materials) to coordinate the camera, laser heads, and fin motion. See Supplementary Figure 1 for an example of the delay generator software interface settings.\n\t\nSet the laser system.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure all laser safety measures are in accordance with institutional guidelines.\n\t\t\nTurn the laser system on by rotating the power key to the right to run the chiller that cools the laser heads. The fault light blinks until the system is ready to power the lasers. Do not press the power button that turns the lasers on until all laser modes are set correctly.\nSet the Trigger Source to EXT LAMP/EXT Q-SW (external lamp/external Q-switch).\nFor both laser heads, set the laser energy to the desired level (i.e., approximately 60%-80% of the full power) and ensure that the Q-switch is turned on by pressing each Q-switch button.\nTurn the lasers on by pressing the Power button.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As the Trigger Source is set to EXT LAMP/EXT Q-SW, the laser heads are ready to fire, but only fire after the system receives an external trigger from the software.\nSet the camera.\n\t\t\nPlug in the power cables to the camera and ensure proper connections to the computer and software.\nOpen the camera settings software and select the proper port.\n\t\t\t\nUnder Trigger > Settings, set \"Trigger in:\" to External and \"Mode:\" to Fast.\nUnder Exposure, set \"Exposure Control\" to Off.\nOpen the camera capture software and select the proper camera card.\n\t\t\t\nClick on the Grab Sequence button.\nClick on the Capture Settings button, select TIFF images, select Series of frames ..., and select the desired file path, 6 Digit Number, Continuous, and Accept.",
    "Click on Start Capture.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: As the camera settings are set to an external trigger, the camera is ready to collect images but only captures these images after the system receives an external trigger from the software.\nSet the delay generator.\n\t\t\nTurn on the delay generator, and connect the External Gate Channel to the fin trigger, Channels A-D to the laser (A: laser head 1, B: Q-switch to laser 1, C: laser head 2, and D: Q-switch to laser 2), and Channel E to the camera.\nOpen the delay generator software.\nSelect the \"Pulse Mode\" to Burst and \"System Resolution\" to 4 ns.\nSet the \"Period (s)\" to 0.033333352.\nSet the \"External Trigger/Gate Mode\" to Triggered, \"Threshold (V)\" to 0.20, and \"Trigger Edge\" as Rising.\nOn Channels > Ch A, click on the Enabled checkbox. Set the \"Delay (s)\" to 0.000000004, \"Width (s)\" to 0.005000000, \"Amplitude (V)\" to 5.00, \"Channel Mode\" to Duty Cycle, \"Wait Count\" to 0, \"Sync Source\" to T0, \"Polarity\" to Normal, \"Multiplexer\" to A, \"Duty Cycle On\" to 1, \"Duty Cycle Off\" to 1, and \"Gate Mode\" to Disabled.\nOn Channels > Ch B, click on the Enabled checkbox. Set the \"Delay (s)\" to 0.000138000, \"Width (s)\" to 0.005000000, \"Amplitude (V)\" to 5.00, \"Channel Mode\" to Duty Cycle, \"Wait Count\" to 0, \"Sync Source\" to Ch A, \"Polarity\" to Normal, \"Multiplexer\" to B, \"Duty Cycle On\" to 1, \"Duty Cycle Off\" to 1, and \"Gate Mode\" to Disabled.",
    "On Channels > Ch C, click on the Enabled checkbox. Set the \"Delay (s)\" to 0.033333304, \"Width (s)\" to 0.005000000, \"Amplitude (V)\" to 5.00, \"Channel Mode\" to Duty Cycle, \"Wait Count\" to 0, \"Sync Source\" to Ch A, \"Polarity\" to Normal, \"Multiplexer\" to C, \"Duty Cycle On\" to 1, \"Duty Cycle Off\" to 1, and \"Gate Mode\" to Disabled.\nOn Channels > Ch D, click on the Enabled checkbox. Set the \"Delay (s)\" to 0.000138000, \"Width (s)\" to 0.005000000, \"Amplitude (V)\" to 5.00, \"Channel Mode\" to Duty Cycle, \"Wait Count\" to 0, \"Sync Source\" to Ch C, \"Polarity\" to Normal, \"Multiplexer\" to D, \"Duty Cycle On\" to 1, \"Duty Cycle Off\" to 1, and \"Gate Mode\" to Disabled.\nOn Channels > Ch E, click on the Enabled checkbox.

This needs to be conducted over 200+ stroke cycles.\nPress Stop in the delay generator software and disconnect the fin from the power source.",
    "Move the fin platform so the laser sheet crosses at a new spanwise position and perform experiments to acquire the images again. Repeat Steps 2.3.-2.6. for the number of desired measurements (eight different spanwise positions, as shown by the black dashed lines in Figure 2A).\nReplace the fin with additional desired fin membranes (two fin stiffnesses, PDMS 10:1 and PDMS 20:1) and repeat the experiments.\n3. Image analysis\nFor each experimental trial conducted in Step 2.4., locate the file where the images are stored and create a subfolder for each fin position or phase throughout the stroke cycle. Sort the image files into their corresponding subfolders.\nFor each fin phase subfolder, read the 200+ images as pixel-value arrays (imread.m). Sum the pixel-value arrays for all the images and divide by the number of images to generate a mean image. Write the image to a new file (imwrite.m). Repeat this step for each fin position throughout the stroke cycle (30 positions).\nPerform a histogram enhancement on each mean image (imadjust.m) to extend the dynamic intensity range of the images to the full available range to improve the contrast between the fin and background.\nSet the intensity thresholds and binarize each image to obtain a black-and-white image (imbinarize.m). The resulting white shapes should correspond to pieces of the fin cross-section.\nExtract all white objects (fin pieces) from the binary image (bwareafilt.m), and display the image (imshow.m). Create a trace of the binary image boundary for each image to obtain a 2D shape by selecting all the fin (white) pixels that touch the background (black) pixels (bwboundaries.m).",
    "NOTE: Due to imposed fin kinematics, the view of the PLIF measured cross-section in some frames may be occluded by another part of the fin. In such cases, either there is no coherent fin shape apparent from the images, or only the leading edge (LE) remains visible (Figure 6).\nPerform Steps 3.1.-3.5. for each fin cross-section.\n4. Reconstruction of 3D deflection\nAssuming that the LE position (at least closer to the stroke axis) in the flexible cases is the same as that of the LE in a rigid fin of the same shape, line the plane cuts along their LE for the same time-step, and compare with the results from the corresponding rigid fin shape.\nUse a least-squares fit to approximate the resulting centerline shape of the fin cross-section for all plane cuts and reconstruct the 3D fin shape using a simplified convex-hull from these fitted profiles.\nCompare the resulting fin shapes with 3D FSI models (generated from their centerlines) to showcase how this process can be used as high-fidelity validation.\n\t\nGenerate a surface triangulation of the partially rigid nylon and partially flexible PDMS fin.\nUse a commercial structural dynamics software (see Table of Materials) to obtain the eigenmodes of the hybrid material.\n\t\t\nPerform scaling studies to match the steady-state displacement obtained using uniform pressure differential on the fin surfaces.\nScale the modes to match the displacement obtained from the software.\nWith the proper scale factor, use the first few dominant modes (usually 7 or 8) employed in the coupled FSI solver to simulate the unsteady flow over the flexible fin.\n\t\t\nTreat the body as an embedded entity in a background mesh.",
    "NOTE: The coupled solver was validated for the Turek-Hron problem of flow over a circular cylinder with a flexible sting at the back35 and extended for flapping fin simulations36.\nPrescribe the kinematics of the fin motion from the experiments.\nMonitor the time history of the force production and the shape of the fin along several plane cuts throughout the flapping cycle, and compare with experiments.\nSubscription Required.
