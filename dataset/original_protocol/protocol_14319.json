    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) at Duke University.\n1. Experimental Animals\nKeep mice in an air-conditioned environment with 12-h light/dark cycles and proper access to standard food and water. House no more than 5 littermates per cage, and avoid conditions that could encourage fighting.\nUse females C57BL6/J mice at 3 months of age (young) or 18 months of age (old).\nFor parabiosis, acclimate 2 mice together for at least two weeks before surgery. Mice are either wild-type C57BL6/J or eGFP+.\nCheck the body condition and overall appearance of mice daily.\n2. Preoperative Setup for Parabiosis and Orthopedic Surgery\nWeigh the 2 mice.\nAdminister general anesthesia via an anesthesia system at a constant O2 flow rate of 0.2 L/min. Use 5% isoflurane for induction in an induction chamber.\n\tNOTE: The depth of anesthesia can be confirmed using a toe pinch.\nPlace the mice on a heated pad in a supine position. Use a rectal probe to monitor body temperature throughout the surgical procedure.\nTo maintain anesthesia, lower the inhaled concentration of isoflurane to 2.0% in 0.2 L/min through a facemask. Monitor to ensure adequate depth of anesthesia.\nMonitor physiologic parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and heart beat) non-invasively using a pulse oximeter (optional).\n3. Parabiosis Surgery (Protocol 1A)\nAdminister analgesia (buprenorphine, SR/slow release, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously) after induction and before surgical manipulation. Inject bupivacaine (0.25%) at the flanks just before opening. Apply eye lubricant.\n\tNOTE: The parabiosis protocol can be performed independently from the tibial fracture.\nFor all internal body suturing, use 4-0 polydioxanone suture material. For all external suturing, use 4-0 polypropylene suture material.",
    "Shave each of the 2 mice along a contiguous line from the elbow, the flank, and the knee on the side to be joined. Disinfect with iodine + 70% alcohol skin scrub over 3 alternating cycles in preparation for incision. \n\tUsed autoclaved instruments and maintain a sterile field.\n\tNOTE: Place the wild-type mouse to the right of the eGFP mouse, and prepare the left flank of the wild-type mouse and the right flank of the eGFP mouse for surgery (Figure 1).\nOn each mouse, use a scissor to make a skin incision along the flank, ranging proximal to the knee to just proximal to the elbow, and without disturbing the muscles underneath the skin.\nJoin the triceps of the animals with 2 interrupted sutures.\nJoin the body walls along the flanks with a running, continuous suture of 7-9 passes.\nJoin the quadriceps of the animal with 2 interrupted sutures.\nClose the skin of the 2 parabionts with interrupted sutures.\nAllow the mice to awake in ambient air.\nTo ensure success of this protocol, the health of the pairs must be maintained: monitor the pairs daily; perform body condition scoring twice weekly; and weigh the pairs twice weekly.\n\tNOTE: Each pair is housed individually.\n\tNOTE: If using regular buprenorphine (ie not SR/slow release) then administer 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously in 1 mL of saline per mouse twice daily for 3 days.\nAllow 4 weeks of recovery time to ensure shared circulation between parabionts if performing tibial fracture surgery.\n4. Tibial Fracture Surgery (Protocol 1B)\nAdminister analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously) after induction and before surgical manipulation. Inject bupivacaine (0.25%) at the surgical site proximal to the knee just before the opening. Apply eye lubricant.",
    "Shave the medial aspect of the right hind limb of the mouse to expose the surgical area, and disinfect with iodine + 70% alcohol skin scrub over 3 alternating cycles. Maintain a sterile surgical field throughout the procedure. To limit contamination; use autoclaved instruments and gloves; complete the surgery under a dissecting microscope (optional); and use a heating pad to maintain body temperature.\n\tNOTE: If the protocol is performed on parabionts, only 1 mouse is fractured in the pair (the right tibia of the right mouse). See Figure 1B for a schematic diagram of the fracture on parabionts.\nUse a scissor to make a skin incision along the medial aspect of the right hind limb proximal to the knee down to the midshaft of the tibia on the right mouse.\nExpose the midshaft of the tibia and visually locate the diaphysis. Flex the knee and visualize the tibial plateau using the patella-femoral ligament as a landmark.\nVisualize the patellar tendon; manually drill by rolling thumb and index finger a 0.5-mm hole in the intramedullary canal using a 25-gauge needle.\n\tNOTE: The drilled hole will run parallel along the tibia, in through the tibial plateau.\nInsert a 0.38-mm stainless steel pin through the hole about 15 mm into the medullary cavity until resistance is felt, and cut flush with the tibial plateau using a wire cutter (see Supplementary Video 1 for a 3D reconstruction).\nUsing straight Bonn scissors, fracture the tibia midshaft (diaphysis). See Figure 1C for a schematic diagram of the fracture.\nVisually observe the fracture site and adjacent tissues to inspect for stabilization of the fracture sight.\nClose with dermal staples.",
    "Place the mice on heated pads to recover before returning them to a clean home cage. Inject 1 mL prewarmed (37 °C) normal saline subcutaneously in each mouse for fluid replacement.\nCheck mice daily for signs of lameness, infection, or bleeding.\n\tNOTE: If using regular buprenorphine (ie not SR/slow release) then administer 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously in 1 mL of saline daily for 3 days."
