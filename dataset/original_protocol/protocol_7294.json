    "Drosophila rearing Set a vial containing fly media with twenty Neuronal Gal4 driver Drosophila adult virgin females and five MitoTimer reporter Drosophila adult males.Keep vials in an incubator at 25 °C, and transfer adult flies to a new vial containing fly media every 24 h.Set 2 to 4 vials with adults laying eggs per day, to collect enough larvae of the desired stage (early third instar larvae are used here).Larvae collection To collect early third instar larvae, wait 4 to 5 days from egg laying, depending on larvae population density per vial.Recover larvae from the food using the sucrose extraction method (Nichols et al., 2012). Select a vial containing larvae, and cover half of it with 20% sucrose solution (Figure 1A).Using a brush, gently disrupt the top food layer and wait for a couple of minutes. The larvae will float, and the food will sink back to the bottom.Using a brush, collect the larvae and transfer them to an apple juice-agar plate (Figure 1B).Insecticide exposure Using the micropipette, load a 48-well Nunc plate with 200 µL of 5% sucrose solution per well.Under the stereo microscope, select early third instar larvae (Figure 1C) and, using a pair of forceps, gently transfer 25 larvae per well (Figure 1D).For the insecticide exposure, create a 5x insecticide solution by diluting a 1,000 ppm insecticide stock solution in 5% sucrose solution (or equivalent dose of DMSO for controls) (Denecke et al., 2015).Add 50 µL of the 5× stock solution to each well containing larvae to be exposed, and give the plate a gentle swirl (Figure 1D).Keep the plate with larvae under insecticide exposure at 25 °C and protected from light for 2 h (or desirable number of hours), until exposure is over.",
    "Once exposure time is over, using a pair of forceps, gently transfer larvae to a new well containing 250 µL of 1× PBS (Figure 1E).Tissue dissection and fixation Transfer larva from the PBS containing well to a microscopy slide containing a drop of 1× PBS.Under the stereo microscope, begin the dissection. Using two pairs of forceps, hold the larval body at the midpoint, and pull the anterior and posterior regions apart (Figure 1F).Using a pair of forceps, gently transfer the anterior body section to a microtube containing 500 µL of 4% formaldehyde solution (Figure 1G).Keep the microtubes at slow agitation in a bench agitator for 20 min, to fix the sample.With a micropipette, slowly and completely remove the fixative solution, whilst avoiding touching the sample. Dispose of the toxic formaldehyde waste appropriately.Gently add 500 µL of 1× PBS back to the microtube, to avoid damaging the sample, and place the microtube back on the agitator for another 5 min.Repeat the previous step two more times.Under the stereo microscope, add a drop of 1× PBS to a new microscopy slide. Using a pair of forceps, gently transfer the fixed sample from the microtube onto the slide (Figure 1H).Conclude the dissection by holding the anterior body section sideways with two pairs of forceps, and gently pull them apart from each other to tear the cuticle. Once the brain is located, use the forceps to clear the surrounding tissues. If PBS starts to dry out, add more of it accordingly.Mounting slides for fluorescence microscopy Clear the remaining tissue from the slide, leaving only the brain.Using a delicate task wiper’s tip, carefully drain the excess of PBS.",
    "Moistening the wiper’s tip in distilled water before touching the PBS, as far away from the fixed sample as possible, will reduce its dragging capacity, and prevent the sample from being sucked into the wiper.Add a small drop of Vectashield on the top of the fixed sample, only enough to cover it. Using a pair of forceps, if necessary, adjust sample orientation.Cut two small pieces of double-sided tape, and place them flanking the sample in Vectashield.Place the coverslip on the top, aligning its border with the double-sided tape (Figure 1I).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4498/bioprotoc-12-17-4498-g001.jpgFigure 1. Experimental procedure. A. Use the sucrose extraction method to recover larvae from the vial. B. Using a brush, transfer larvae to an apple-juice agar plate. C. Selected early third instar larvae. D. Transfer 25 larvae to a well pre-loaded with 5% sucrose solution, and expose them to insecticide. E. Once exposure is over, transfer larvae to a new well containing 1× PBS solution. F. Under the microscope, begin dissection by separating anterior and posterior body parts. G. Transfer the anterior body part to a microtube containing fixative solution. After fixing the sample, perform three washing steps by replacing the solution in the microtube with 1× PBS. H. Under the microscope, conclude dissection, and isolate the brain from the other tissues. I. Mount the slide for microscopy using double-sided tape, Vectashield, and a cover slip.Imaging Proceed to image acquisition with a fluorescent microscope immediately.To ensure consistency and accuracy in the measurements, set optimal values of laser power and gain with a control sample, and maintain the same settings across all samples.Once the desired area is localized, acquire both green (excitation/emission 488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) signals at 200× magnification.Acquire at least 20 images across the z-stack for every sample."
