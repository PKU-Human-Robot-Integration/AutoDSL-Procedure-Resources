    "The following procedure to collect data on infant and toddler’s visual experiences in the laboratory and at home was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from the infant’s caregiver.\n1. Choose a Head Camera\nNOTE: There are numerous small, lightweight, and portable cameras readily available for purchase (Figure 2).\nChoose a head camera that is unobtrusive and will not influence the scenes being recorded.\n\t\nMount the camera onto a snug hat or headband using a temporary adhesive or securely mount the camera onto a small plastic plate attached to the headband. Position the camera at the child’s brow (Figure 2B, left).\n\t\t\nDepending on the shape of the camera, mount the camera by sewing small cloth loops into a headband or hat (Figure 2B, center and right).\nEnsure that the hat or headband are adjustable to achieve a snug and comfortable fit on the child’s head (Figure 2A).\nNOTE: A camera located directly between the eyes of the infant is theoretically ideal, however this is not quite possible with current technology. Small cameras that can be placed low on the forehead are becoming increasingly available.\nIf cameras are being sent home with the parents, ensure that parents can use them without any technical help.\n\t\nBefore the parents leave the laboratory, train them on how to operate the head camera.\nSend the parents home with the camera to use, the head-band or hat, and a hand-out describing the procedure to turn on the camera and record data.\nEnsure that the cameras are light enough for infants to wear and forget about.\nNOTE: The recommended weight is less than 30 g3. Any chosen camera should not heat up during use and must be durable under heavy use.",
    "If the experimental setup requires the children to be freely-moving, store recorded video to an internal storage card. Otherwise, use cameras tethered to the data collection computer.\nUse a camera with a high-quality lens to better leverage recent advances in machine learning algorithms which segment visual scenes into regions of interest.\n\t\nIf visual scenes will be manually coded by researchers, use a camera that can capture images at sufficient quality for manual inspection.\nEnsure that any battery-powered camera is capable of recording for the desired amount of time.\nShortly before beginning the experiment or sending the camera home with the parents, test the head camera to ensure it is working appropriately.\n2. Data Collection in the Laboratory\nNOTE: Head-mounted cameras can be easily added to most experiments.\nHave 2-3 experimenters place the camera onto the child’s head: one experimenter places the head camera, one monitors the head-camera view, and, if needed, one distracts the child.\n\t\nAsk the parent to ensure that the child remains calm and to distract the child during the placement process.\nPerform the camera placement in three steps as follows.\n\t\nDesensitize the infant to hand actions near their head.\n\t\t\nAsk the parent to lightly touch or stroke the infant’s head and hair several times.\nAsk the experimenter placing the hat on the infant’s head to do the same as in 2.2.1.1.\nHave the experimenter place the head-mounted camera when the child is distracted.\n\t\t\nUse push-button toys to keep the child’s hands busy.\nHave the distracting experimenter or parent help at this stage by gently pushing the child’s hands toward the engaging toy so that the child’s hands do not go to the head.\nTighten the hat on the child’s head and adjust the head camera when the child is engaged with the toy.",
    "Adjust the camera so that when the infant holds an object in front of his/her face, the object is centered in the head camera FOV.\nIf the child is sitting, adjust the camera so that it captures most of the child’s lap when the child looks down.\nAfter placing the camera on the child’s head, ask the experimenter to leave the room and begin the recording.\nIn the event that a camera is moved out of place or removed, re-enter the room to correct the camera.\n\t\nTerminate the experiment if the child does not tolerate the camera being reapplied.\nNOTE: For recording natural environments in the home, first fit a hat and camera to the individual infant and show parents how to position the camera. The design and fit of the camera must ensure that parents will be able to put the hat on their child without technical help.\n3. Data Collection for the Parent-Infant Study\nNOTE: The following representative method for head-cameras uses naturalistic toy play in the lab to demonstrate the type of analyses that can be conducted on the egocentric views of infants and their parents (Figure 3A).\nOutfit the parent and child with head-mounted cameras, as described in 2.1 and 2.2.\nUse head cameras to capture videos with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels at 30 frame/s. Proceed as described in steps 2.3 and 2.4.\n\t\nSubsample the video stream at one frame every 5 s.\nManually draw bounding boxes around each toy (Figure 3B) within view using commercial software or a program developed in-house (see Figure 3C for a sample frame).",
    "If only part of a toy is visible due to occlusion by other toys or truncation on the edge of the frame, only draw bounding boxes when a toy is easily identifiable and include all visible parts of the toy.\nFor example, if only the doll’s leg is visible, draw a bounding box around its leg. If an object occludes half of the doll, leaving the hair and legs visible, then draw a box that includes both hair and legs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
