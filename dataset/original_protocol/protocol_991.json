    "**REAGENT SETUP**\n**IraZolve-Mito staining solution**\nIraZolve-Mito \\(MW = 907.48 g/mol) is provided as a powder \\(0.5 mg) that can be stored at room temperature. The powder should be dissolved in high-quality/sterile/anhydrous DMSO \\(55.1 µL) to prepare IraZolve-MitoTM stock solution of 10 mM, which can be stored at 4 ºC \nStock solution of IraZolve-MitoTM \\(10 mM) should be diluted in either complete sterile DPBS to a final concentration of 20 µM \\(1:500 dilution of 10mM stock solution). ▲ **CRITICAL** Prepare fresh 20 µM staining solution for each experiment. At the end of experiment, this staining solution should be discarded.\n**MitoTracker<sup>®</sup> Red CMXRos staining solution**\nPrepare 1 mM stock solution by adding 94 µL of high-quality/sterile/anhydrous DMSO to 50 µg of the lyophilized MitoTracker® product \\(MW = 531.52 g/mol). This stock solution can be stored at ‒20 ºC for at least one year. We recommend avoiding multiple freeze-thaw cycles. ▲ **CRITICAL** This imaging agent is light sensitive, therefore, store it in a dark container. For mitochondrial staining by MitoTracker<sup>®</sup> Red CMXRos, dilute the stock solution at 1:1000 either in complete DMEM media or in DPBS. At the end of experiment, this staining solution should be discarded.\n**4% PFA fixation solution**\nTo 4 g of PFA add 50 mL of distilled water. Add 1 mL 1M NaOH. To dissolve, heat and stir at 60 ºC. Once dissolved, add 10 mL 10 × DPBS. Allow to cool and adjust to pH 7.4 with 1M HCl. Add distilled water to 100 mL, filter solution and store aliquots at ‒20 ºC. **\\!** **CAUTION** PFA is toxic. Please read the MSDS before working with this chemical. Gloves and safety glasses should be worn and solutions made inside a fume hood.\n**Saponin solution \\(10% w/vol)**",
    "Dissolve 1 g of Saponin in 10 mL of sterile DPBS. Store at 4 ºC. For permeabilization of the cell membrane, add 100 µL of 10% Saponin \\(w/vol) in 10 mL of DPBS. This will yield 10 mL of a diluted solution with a final solute concentration of 0.1 %.\n**Blocking solution**\nDissolve 2.5 g of the lyophilized BSA powder in 50 mL of sterile DPBS; stir continuously. Add 250 µL of 10% Saponin, and then disperse into 10 mL-aliquots. Store at ‒20 ºC.\n**Anti-Cytochrome C antibody \\(1 µg/mL)**\nThis antibody is delivered as 100 µg stock \\(0.6 mg/mL) in PBS, containing 0.02% sodium azide, and it should be stored at ‒20 °C avoiding freeze/thaw cycle. For anti-Cytochrome C staining, add 2 µL of the antibody stock in 1 mL of blocking solution.\n**Secondary antibody**\nAnti-Rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy5 labels were prepared at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution \\(i.e. 5% BSA containing 0.05% Saponin).\n**Hoechst 33258 staining solution**\nHoechst 33258 DNA stain is delivered as a 10 mg/mL solution in water, which should be stored at 4º C in the dark. This stock solution can be used for at least a year. For nuclear staining, prepare Hoechst 33258 at 1:1000 dilution in DPBS. ▲ **CRITICAL** This imaging agent is light sensitive, so therefore store it in the dark.\n**EQUIPMENT SETUP**\n**Nikon A1+ microscope setup.** Essential components are as follows \\(note that while a specialist protocol has been presented, IraZolve-Mito can be imaged on any standard confocal or epifluorescent microscope):\n• A Nikon A1+ \\(Nikon, Japan) fitted with a LU-N4/LU-N4S 4-laser unit \\(403, 488, 561 and 640 nm), the A1-DUG GaAsP Multi Detector Unit \\(2 GaAsP PMTs and 2 standard PMTs) and a 32 channel spectral detector \\(Nikon, Japan)",

For two-photon microscopy, IraZolve-Mito can be excited by 800-830 nm excitation wavelengths. Ideally, image with a spectral detector set for the emission of 550-650 nm, alternatively detected by using an emission filter suited to the detection of red fluorophores.\n• For imaging of MitoTracker<sup>®</sup> Red CMXRos, use 561 nm excitation wavelength \\(0.3 power setting) and collect emission at 595 nm by a GaAsP PMT detector \\(gain of PMT HV 30). For co-staining experiments, use the settings above in sequence to collect IraZolve-Mito and MitoTracker<sup>®</sup> Red CMXRos respectively, minimising any overlap in spectral profiles.\n• Image anti-Cytochrome C antibody staining using a 640 nm laser \\(7 power setting) and emission wavelength 700 nm by a standard PMT \\(gain of PMT HV 125)\n• Image Hoechst 33258 DNA stain using 403 nm laser \\(<sub> 1.0 laser power), and collect emission at 450 nm wavelength by a GaAsP PMT detector \\(gain of PMT HV </sub> 65)\n• Set the pinhole radius to 42.1 µm\n• 40X/WI λS DIC N2 water emersion lens\n• Set the temperature in the imaging facility to a constant 19 °C\n**Zeiss LSM 710 META NLO microscope setup**.

Tissue preparation and fixation protocol**\nThe experimental procedures should be approved by an Animal Ethics Committee \\(e.g. SAHMRI Animal Ethics Committee in South Australia) and follow the guidelines of a Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals \\(e.g. as developed for Scientific Purposes developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia). The investigators should understand the ethical principles outlined in Grundy et al. \\[10] **\\!

TROUBLESHOOTING**\n**3. Mounting tissues for imaging**",
    "For tissue mounting, use µ-slide 8 well chambers. Keep tissues moist, but not mounted in DPBS as this may cause tissues to float away from the imaging surface. For example, mount tissues with a longitudinal cross-section in contact with the imaging surface of the chamber, where possible. Good contact between the sample and the surface can be achieved by gently pressing the tissue down into the chamber. Using samples that are roughly the same size as the chamber, can also help to hold the tissue in place. A dissection microscope can be used to place and orientate the tissues. For snap-frozen tissue add an appropriate amount of mounting media, such as 80% glycerol in PBS, to the section and add a cover slip.\n**?
