    "1. Electrospinning Collector Setup\nCut the aluminum foil into a rectangular piece.\nFold the rectangular piece into a rectangular strip, and attach it perpendicular to a flat metal plate with tape (Figure 1). Note: The size of the fiber mat depends on the length and width of the strip. Thus, the strip dimensions can be adjusted as needed.\n2. Polymeric Solution Preparation\nMix glycerol and dodecanedioic acid (DDA) in 1:1 molar ratio in a beaker at 120 °C for 100 hr to obtain PGD polymer.\nDissolve poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and gelatin in 65% ethanol with a weight ratio of 1.5:3:95.5 in a 15 ml tube, tighten the cap and heat the mixture in an oven at 60 °C for 1 hr with stirring until it becomes a homogeneous solution (Basal solution).\nFor electrospinning, mix the PGD polymer and the basal solution in 4:6 weight ratio. Note: PGD concentration has a big effect on fiber diameter. 30%-50% percent PGD is acceptable to produce fibers longer than 5 cm with increased fiber diameters.\nAdd 0.1% riboflavin to the polymeric solution and mix well.\n3. Electrospinning\nFeed the polymeric solution into a 5 ml standard syringe with an 18 G blunted stainless steel needle.\nInsert the syringe into a syringe pump.\nAttach the grounded lead of a high voltage power source to the metal plate and the positively charged lead to the needle.\nAdjust the distance between the needle and the aluminum foil strip to 15 cm.\nPlace the syringe pump in an angle of about 15° with the horizontal to prevent aggregation of the fibers at the front of the strip.\nTurn on the syringe pump and adjust the flow rate of the pump to 0.6 ml/hr.\nTurn on the high voltage power source and set the operating voltage to 14.6 kV.",
    "4. Fiber Processing\nAfter the collection is complete, expose the fiber mat to UV light for 60 min for cross-linking.\nTransfer the fiber mat from the aluminum foil strip to a 100 mm Petri dish, and expose it to UV light for another 20 min for sterilization.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, cut the fiber mat into round pieces of the same size with a surgical blade and place the pieces into a 24-well plate.\nFor cell pre-seeding treatment, immerse fiber samples in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nOn the following day, aspirate PBS carefully, add 1 ml of differentiation medium (DMEM/F12, N2, and FGF2) (see recipe in Materials table) to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 3 hr.\nAspirate differentiation medium carefully, add 0.2 ml of matrigel to each fiber sample and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Note: Laminin can also be used for fiber coating. Add 0.2 ml of 20 µg/ml laminin to the fiber and incubate at room temperature for 3 hr.\nCarefully remove excess matrigel from each well. Rinse with 2 ml of differentiation medium once. Note: The fiber samples are ready for cell culture.\n5. Cell Seeding on Fibers\nAdd 1 ml of Accutase to the mES cell culture dish and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nAfter 10 min, the mES cells are detached from the culture dish. Add 4 ml of differentiation medium to the plate. Collect the floating mES cells into a 15 ml tube and pipette cells up and down to break colonies (about 15x).\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min and re-suspend cells in 4 ml of differentiation medium.",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer. Transfer 200 µl of the cell suspension into a 15 ml tube and dilute it 10x with differentiation medium. Transfer 15 µl of the diluted cell suspension to a chamber on the hemocytometer with a cover-slip in place. Count the cells in the 1 mm center square and the four corner squares of the hemocytometer under the microscope. Note: Cell per ml = the average count per square x the dilution factor x 104\nPlace approximately 5 x 104 mES cells onto each well. Slowly drop the cell suspension onto the middle of the fiber samples, instead of sliding off to the side of the well, to prevent the solution from draining off the fiber mat.\nAdd 1 ml of differentiation medium to each well, and keep the plate in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow cells attachment, growth and differentiation.\nAspirate the old medium from each well and replace with 1 ml of fresh differentiation medium every other day.\n6. Cell Viability\nAspirate the old medium from each well.\nMix 1/10th volume of Resazurin fluorescence reagent with culture medium and add 1 ml to each well.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 hr, protected from direct light.\nAfter 4 hr, transfer 100 µl 3x of the reagent from each well to a 96-well plate, and then the samples are ready to be measured on a fluorescence spectrophotometer using 560EX nm/590EM filter settings.\n7. Real Time PCR\nAfter 14 days of culture, add lysis buffer to the samples and isolate total RNA from the cells on the fiber samples.\nUse 4 µl of total RNA to synthesize cDNA in 20 µl reaction scales by reverse transcription.",
    "Prepare the PCR reaction mixture in each optical tube: 10 µl Master Mix (2x), 0.2 µl dye, 8 µl Nuclease-Free water, 1 µl cDNA, and 1 µl primer (Primers used in this study are listed in Table 1).\nSet up the PCR program: a. 95 °C 2:20 min, 1 cycle b. 95 °C 3 sec→60° C 1 min, 40 cycle c. 95° C 15 sec, 1 cycle d. 60° C 1 min, 1 cycle e. 95° C 15 sec, 1 cycle. Choose comparative CT method to determine relative gene expression levels.\nAfter PCR is finished, analyze the real-time PCR results with StepOne software and export the results to Excel.\nSubscription Required.
