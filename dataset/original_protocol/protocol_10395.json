    "All animal care and experiments are performed in accordance with the ethical protocol provided by the KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) IRB (Institutional Review Board).\n1. TAPE Formation\nFor preparing a TA solution, place a 4 ml-sized glass vial on a magnetic stirrer, and add 1 ml of distilled water with a stirring bar. Add 1 g of tannic acid to the vial, and dissolve it in the water by gentle stirring at 200 rpm for more than 1 hr. When the TA is completely dissolved, the mixture becomes transparent with a brown color.\nPrepare a PEG solution by adding 1 g of PEG powder (4-arms, 10 kDa, and linear, 4.6 kDa) to 1 ml of distilled water followed by mixing them by vortexing for few seconds to make a white slurry. Keep this slurry in the incubator at 60 °C for 10 min. until the white one becomes completely clear.\nNOTE: The melting point of PEG with 10 kDa molecular weight is around 55 - 60 °C, and the 4 kDa one is 53 - 58 °C. Melted PEG becomes water-miscible so that a high concentration of PEG in water up to 1 g/ml can be achieved as a clear solution. Once a clear PEG solution is formed at a high temperature, the solution is still stable at room temperature after cooling.\nAdd 329 µl of the PEG (4-arms, 10 kDa) solution prepared in step 1.2 to 671 µl of the TA solution prepared in step 1.1 (In the case of a linear PEG with 4.6 kDa, add 311 µl of a PEG solution to 689 µl of a TA solution) in a micro-centrifuge tube. Gently blend the two viscous and honey-like solutions with a narrow spatula to mix them homogeneously.",
    "CAUTION: Both solutions are quite viscous, so the scientist must slowly but sufficiently pull up and transfer the solutions with a micropipette.\nSpin the mixture prepared in step 1.3 at 12,300 x g for 3 min in a centrifuge equipped with a fixed-angle rotor.\nCarefully remove as much of the supernatant as possible using a micropipette, and collect the product that has settled down: This is the fully formed TAPE. After TAPE formation, store it in the refrigerator (4 - 8 °C) for up to several weeks. NOTE: TAPE can be sterilized by gamma radiation or electron beam treatment prior to use in surgical applications.\n2. Measurement of the Adhesion Strength of TAPE \nPrepare two pieces of porcine skin tissue with a diameter of 6 mm by cutting with a biopsy punch after removing all fat on the skin tissue.\nNOTE: The porcine skin tissue was obtained from healthy porcine flank skin and was purchased from a local meat market located in Daejeon in South Korea.\nApply commercial cyanoacrylate glue to the outer side of each tissue, and attach the tissue to the metallic rod.\nNOTE: The metallic rod is used as a supplementary handle so tissues are not directly gripped by the machine. Accordingly, it can be replaced with other materials following the configuration of the tensile machine.\nApply a drop of TAPE (a drop of TAPE is approximately 3 - 6 mg) to one side of the tissue. Then, spread the TAPE uniformly using another tissue between the two tissues on their inner sides so they are attached as shown in Figure 2A.\nThen, manually attach and detach the two sides of tissues several times to homogenously mix and maximize the interface between each tissue and TAPE.",
    "With the UTM, carefully grip each side of the rod. The adhesion strength will be determined by the force needed to detach two tissues attached with TAPE. First, apply a force of 20 N for 1 min. Next, with the machine, pull each rod in an opposite direction at a rate of 1 mm/min. until the tissues are completely detached.\nNOTE: Data will be given as a force-distance (F-D) curve detected by the motion of each rod.\nCalculate the adhesion strength of TAPE by dividing the maximum force (kN) shown at the F-D curve achieved in step 2.5 by the specimen surface area, that is, 3.14 x (0.003 m)2.\nFor monitoring the adhesion strength in the presence of water, add 20 µl of water on the detached area between two tissues, and attach them immediately. With the machine, perform the detachment test again.\n3. In Vitro Degradation Test\nCut a cap (d = 8 mm) of micro-centrifuge tube, and weigh the cap to define it as Wc.\nFill the cap with 150 mg of TAPE, and weigh all together again to set it as a total initial weight W0.\nCAUTION: Do not overload TAPE in the cap. The height of TAPE should be lower than the top of the cap, as it can be a physical barrier to a stream of PBS buffer generated by the stirring process during the incubation in step 3.4.\nPut the cap containing TAPE into a cell culture flask (75 cm2), and add 50 ml of PBS buffer (1x, pH 7.4) to the cell culture flask so the TAPE in the cap is completely immersed in the PBS buffer, as shown in Figure 3A (n = 5).",
    "Incubate the cell culture flask prepared in step 3.3 in an orbital shaking incubator at 37 °C, similar to physiological conditions, with gentle stirring (50 rpm).\nCAUTION: Keep the stirring condition at 50 rpm. Higher rpm might cause a collapse of TAPE.\nAt each time point, take the cap with TAPE from the cell culture flask, and then dry them by blowing nitrogen gas. Weigh the cap containing remaining TAPE. Set the weight at each time point to Wt. Replace the fresh PBS again, and shake it again after measuring Wt at each time point.\nCalculate the relative remaining weight (%) the following equation.\n\tRelative remaining weight (%) = (Wt - Wc)/(W0 - Wc) x 100%\n4. Hemostatic Ability of TAPE\n       NOTE: All animal experiments should be performed in accordance with the guidelines and ethical protocol provided by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.\nTo evaluate the in vivo hemostatic ability, review the hemorrhaging mouse liver model as described in ref 24.\nAnesthetize fifteen mice (normal ICR mouse, 6 weeks, 30 - 35 g, male) with an intraperitoneal injection of tiletamine-zolazepam (33.333 mg/kg) and xylazine (7.773 mg/kg) (n = 5 per group). To confirm proper anesthetization, pinch the animal's paw gently and observe movements such as withdrawing the paw, etc. No movement indicates that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized to do surgery.\nTo prevent dryness of animal's eyes, apply vet ointment to eyes sufficiently while under anesthesia. Expose the liver via a midline abdominal incision, and prick the liver with an 18 G needle to induce bleeding.\nRemove the flowing blood with sterile gauze, and put 100 µl of TAPE or fibrin glue (positive control) immediately on the bleeding site.",
    "NOTE: No further suturing is needed after applying TAPE due to its highly blood-resistant adhesive properties on wound tissues. For the negative control, no treatment occurs at the site of bleeding.\nIn each case, put a filter paper with known mass underneath the liver to collect the blood from the damage site. Replace the paper with a fresh one every 30 sec for 4 times (i.e., 2 min).\nMeasure the mass of absorbed blood on each filter paper collected every 30 sec. After the animal experiment, sacrifice the mice through CO2 asphyxiation euthanasia.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
