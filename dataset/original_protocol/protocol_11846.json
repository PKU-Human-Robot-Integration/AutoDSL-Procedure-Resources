    "The animal procedure is in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Mouse Embryonic Heart Dissection and Single Cell Suspension Preparation\nNOTE: This step could take a few hours depending on the numbers of embryos to dissect.\nTo acquire E18.5 embryonic hearts, euthanize a pregnant CD1 mouse by CO2 administration. Use a razor to remove the unwanted hair in the abdominal area and disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol.\nCut the skin of the abdomen using sterilized scissors and carefully dissect the embryos out and quickly put them into cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice.\nIsolate hearts from each individual embryo carefully in a 10 cm dish filled with cold PBS under a stereoscopic microscope using forceps and scissors.\n\tNOTE: Keep the four chambers intact by dissecting the lung with heart together and DO NOT directly catch/pull the heart with surgical instruments.\nTransfer ~10 hearts into a new 10 cm dish filled with cold PBS and micro-dissect the hearts into left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle.\n\tNOTE: This is assumed to yield more than 1 x 106 cells from each sample. We recommend to start with at least 1 x 105 cells per sample.\nTransfer each of the 4 chamber tissues to a 1.5 mL tube and chop them into pieces using scissors. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min to collect the tissues.\nAfter aspirating the supernatant, add 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA to each tube and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. Pipet up and down gently 7-8 times using a P1000 pipette.",
    "If the embryonic stage is older than E11.5, add 1 mL of 10 mg/mL collagenase A/B mixture and incubate at 37 °C for 10-20 min. Gently pipet up and down until most cells are dissociated.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL tube and add 8 mL Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to dilute the enzymes. Spin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Suspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS and transfer them to a 1.5 mL tube. Filter the cells through a 40 µm cell strainer.\nTake 15 µL of volume from each sample and mix with the same amount of 0.04% trypan blue. Load this on a cell counting chamber and count the cells in a cell counter.\n\tNOTE: To generate high quality results, cell viability is recommended to be higher than 95%.\n2. Single Cell Multiplexing Barcoding\nNOTE: This step takes at least 40 min which varies based on the number of samples processed. A clean bench area treated with RNase decontamination solution is required for pre-amplification steps (step 2.11 to 3.11), and a separate clean bench area is required for the post-amplification steps (the steps after 3.11).\nLipid based barcoding procedure (optional procedure 1)\nBased on cell concentration, keep less than 5 x 105 cells per sample. Make sure the cell suspension is free of debris and cell aggregates.\nPrepare 2 µM anchor/barcode stock solution and 2 µM co-anchor stock solution for each sample (Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: The anchor and co-anchor were kindly gifted by Dr. Zev J. Gartner lab. To synthesize these lipid-modified oligonucleotides, DNA sequences were conjugated with fatty acid on a solid support and purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)18,19.",
    "Wash the cells twice with PBS and collect the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Suspend cells in 180 µL of PBS.\nAdd 20 µL of anchor/barcode stock solution and pipette up and down gently to mix. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 20 µL of co-anchor stock solution and pipette up and down gently to mix, then incubate on ice for another 5 min.\nAdd 1 mL of cold PBS with 1% BSA and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Wash at least 2 more times with ice cold 1% BSA in PBS.\nCombine all samples together and filter through 40 µm cell strainers. Count the cells and keep the cell suspension on ice to use in section 3.\nAntibody-based barcoding procedure (optional procedure 2)\nCentrifuge 1 x 106-2 x 106 cells for each sample (from step 1.8) at 300 x g for 5 min and suspend them in 100 µL of staining buffer (Table 1) in 1.5 mL low bind tubes.\nAdd 10 µL Fc blocking reagent and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.\nPrepare antibodies (see Table of Materials) by centrifuging at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 2-8 °C.\nAdd 1 µg of each oligo-conjugated antibody to 50 µL of cell staining buffer to make antibody staining solution20. Add one antibody staining solution to each sample tube. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.\nWash cells 3 times with 1 mL of PBS, spin for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C.\nPool all samples at desired proportions in 1 mL of staining buffer, spin for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Resuspend cells in PBS at appropriate concentration (up to 1,500 cells/µL) and filter cells through a 40 µm cell strainer. Immediately proceed to the next step.\n3. Droplet Generation and mRNA Reverse Transcription\nNOTE: This step takes about 90 min for one multiplexed reaction.\nEquilibrate the gel beads (see Table of Materials) to room temperature for 30 min. Take out reagents from gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) kit (see Table of Materials) and keep them at their indicated temperature.\nAssemble the chip B into a chip holder (see Table of Materials).\nDispense 75 µL of 50% glycerol solution into the unused wells in row 1; 40 µL in row 2; 280 µL in row 3. Do not add glycerol in any recovery wells on the top row of the chip.\nPrepare the master mix on ice according to Table 1. Add appropriate volume of cell suspension and nuclease-free water to master mix according to a cell suspension volume calculator table17 and gently pipette the mix. Dispense 75 µL of cell mixture into the bottom center of the sample well in row 1 without introducing bubbles.\nVortex the gel beads for 30 s using a vortex adapter and slowly dispense 40 µL of gel beads into the bottom center of the gel bead well in row 2 without introducing bubbles.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to wait for 30 s between adding cells and gel beads to avoid wetting failure.\nFor the partitioning oil well in row 3, dispense 280 µL of partitioning oil through the sidewall of the well.\n\tNOTE: Loading less than 270 µL of partitioning oil will lead to abnormal GEMs generation.\nAttach the gasket onto the chip, do not press down on the gasket and keep it horizontal to avoid wetting the gasket.",
    "Load the assembled chip with the gasket in the chromium controller and run the chromium single cell B program (see Table of Materials), immediately proceed to the next step when the program completes.\nTake the chip out and discard the gasket. Fold the lid back to expose wells at 45°, check the liquid level to make sure no clogs are present.\nSlowly aspirate 100 µL of GEMs from the lowest points of the recovery well and check the uniformity of the GEMs. Dispense GEMs into a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tube on ice with the pipette tips against the sidewall of the tube.\n\tNOTE: If excess aqueous layer is observed, it is suggested to re-prepare the samples. Importantly, take a picture of the mixture when the GEMs are still in the pipette tips. This picture can tell if there is a wetting failure, partially emulsified GEMs, and reagent clogs. The photograph can also be used as evidence to get reimbursement from the reagent company with replacement reagents and chips.\nPut the tube in a thermal cycler and perform the reverse transcription procedure (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: Stop here or proceed to the next step. The PCR product can be stored at -20 °C for up to a week.\n4. cDNA Amplification\nNOTE: This step takes about 150 min.\nPost single cell reverse transcription cleanup\nTake out the cDNA amplification reagents from GEMs kit (see Table of Materials) and keep them at their indicated temperature.\nAdd 125 µL of recovery agent to the sample at room temperature to acquire a biphasic mixture. No opaque liquid should be observed and avoid pipetting or vortexing the mixture.\nAfter waiting for 60 s, slowly remove 125 µL of recovery agent from the bottom of the tube.",
    "Vortex the magnetic beads (see Table of Materials) thoroughly for 30 s and immediately use it to prepare beads cleanup mixture (Table 1).
