    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the Federal Research and Clinical Center of Physical-Chemical Medicine of Federal Medical Biological Agency dated September 08, 2015.\nNOTE: Figure 1 gives an overview of the protocol.\n1. Obtaining a primary culture of human skin fibroblasts (Figure 2)\nDeliver the biopsy to a laboratory within a few hours in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL of penicillin and 50 U/mL of streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: A skin biopsy must be performed under sterile conditions by a physician after a patient signs an informed consent.\nPlace the biopsy tissue in a 6 cm Petri dish together with a small amount of the medium.\nUsing a sterile scalpel, cut the biopsy sample into pieces of about 0.5-1 mm in size. Place 1-2 obtained fragments into a 3.5 cm Petri dish and place a sterile coverslip over the biopsy pieces. Slowly add 1.5 mL of a growth medium to the following composition: DMEM, 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nCulture fibroblasts in the growth medium inside a CO2 incubator maintained at 5% CO2, 37 °C, 80% humidity.\n\t​NOTE: After 4-7 days, first keratinocytes, then fibroblasts, begin to migrate from the tissue to the bottom of the dish.\n2. Storage, freezing, and unfreezing of primary culture\nRemove cells from the culture dish (see points 3.2-3.4).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g. Then discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 900 µL of cooled FBS.\nTransfer to a cryopreservation tube drop by drop and add 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nPlace the cryoprobe in a low-temperature freezer at -80 °C. Twenty-four hours later, transfer the cryovial to liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for long-term storage.",
    "To defrost the cryopreserved cells, remove the cryovial from the nitrogen storage and, within 1 min, transfer 1 mL of the content into a 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL of the transport medium preheated to 37 °C.\nCarefully resuspend and then centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 200 x g. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in the required volume of the growth medium and place them on a Petri dish of the required diameter.\n3. Cell cultivation\nCover the dish bottom with autoclaved 0.1% gelatin solution prepared in distilled water. Incubate for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: For transfection visualization, glass-bottom plate dishes (confocal dishes with glass thickness 170 µm) should be used.\nPrepare a culture medium having the following composition: DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Mix thoroughly and store at 4 °C. Warm the medium to 37 °C before adding to the cells.\nAssess the culture under the microscope. Remove the medium and wash the fibroblasts with Dulbecco's phosphate-salt solution (DPBS).\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin solution to the cells. Check the cells under the microscope if they detach from the substrate completely. Deactivate trypsin with 1 mL of the culture medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of the culture medium.\nCount the number of cells. Calculate the required number of cells to seed them with a density of 8-15 x 103/cm2 and resuspend in 2 mL of the culture medium.\nRemove the gelatin solution from the culture dish and immediately add 2 mL of the cell suspension. Cultivate fibroblasts at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.",
    "Refresh the medium every 2-4 days.\n\t​NOTE: For experiments, use the cells of 4-11 passages.\n4. Transfection\nReplace the culture medium with a fresh culture medium 24 h before transfection.\n\tNOTE: The cell confluence should be 70-80%.\nPrepare a DNA-lipid complex based on the area and density of the cell seeding. Use liposome-based transfection agent.\n\tNOTE: Use the cell seeding density as 1 x 104 cells/cm2.\nAdd 3 µL of commercial transfection reagent to 125 µL of optimal minimal essential medium (Opti-MEM) not containing any antibiotics, without touching the walls of the tube. Gently resuspend.\nDilute plasmid DNA (GFP-EB3) by adding 1 µg of the plasmid DNA to 125 µL of Opti-MEM. Gently resuspend.\n\tNOTE: Expression vector encoding GFP-EB311 was received as a kind gift from Dr. I. Kaverina (Vanderbilt University, Nashville) with permission from Dr. A. Akhmanova (Erasmus University, Rotterdam)11.\nAdd diluted plasmid DNA to each tube of diluted transfection reagent (1:1). Incubate for 30 min.\nAdd the DNA-lipid complex to the 6 cm Petri dish containing cells and mix with a cruciform swing for 30 s. Incubate cells with a transfection agent for 24 h and then change to fresh medium. Analyze the efficiency of transfection after 24 h and 48 h.\n\t​NOTE: 24 h after transfection, the efficiency was 10-15%, and after 48 h up to 40%.\n5. Preparing for imaging\nBefore live imaging of cells, change the culture medium to a medium without pH-indicator dye to reduce autofluorescence.\nCarefully apply mineral oil to the medium surface to completely cover the medium, isolating it from the external environment to reduce the O2 penetration and the medium evaporation.\nUse a mercury lamp and oil immersion 60x or 100x objective lens with a high numeral aperture to take the images.",
    "NOTE: For in vivo observations, the microscope must be equipped with an incubator to maintain the necessary conditions for the cells, including heating the object table and the lens to +37 °C, a closed chamber with CO2 supply, and humidity level support. Use double distilled water to create humidity. Check the level of double distilled water before filming.\nPlace the confocal dish with the cells in the microscope holder before imaging. Ensure that the dish and the camera are securely attached to the holder to avoid drifting while taking images.\n6. Setting the imaging parameters\nChoose the low exposure values since light induces cell-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n\tNOTE: To study the dynamics of microtubules in human skin fibroblasts, a 300 ms exposure was selected.\nFocus on the object of interest.\n\tNOTE: For long-term time-lapse imaging, use the automatic focus stabilization system to compensate for a possible shift along the z-axis.\nChoose the optimal imaging conditions depending on the cells' photosensitivity and the rate of the fluorochrome fading.\n\tNOTE: Since microtubules are highly dynamic structures, a reasonably short time interval can be selected, and the frame rate must be sufficiently high. To investigate the microtubule dynamics in skin fibroblasts, we used at a frequency of 1 frame/s for 3-5 min.\nWhen selecting the next object to get the image, move away from the already imaged area. Since this area was under the influence of light, there will be noticeable photo-bleaching.\n\tNOTE: Since a relatively high imaging frequency was used, the shutter did not close between images, and the lamp was lit for the entire period of imaging, which is why fading increased.",
    "Choose the optimal video for studying the microtubules' dynamics visually, taking into account the quality of transfection, the quality of the microtubules' images (optimal signal-to-noise ratio), and the absence of drifting in case of the analyzed cell (Figure 3).\nUse the selected videos to study the microtubules' plus-ends dynamics by tracing them in the ImageJ or Fiji program (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: For quantitative analysis instructions see Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1.\nSubscription Required.
