    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPurification of the GST-H2B protein\nTiming: 3 days\nThis major step describes the transformation of BL21 cells with the pET42b (+) plasmid encoding the H2B protein (GST-H2B) and purification of this protein. Please also refer to (Jing et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for an example of this step.\nTake the competent BL21 cells from the −80°C freezer and thaw the cells on ice.\nMix 2 μL of the GST-H2B plasmids (approximately 1 μg) with 20 μL of BL21 competent cells in a microcentrifuge tube. Gently mix the cells and the plasmids.\nPlace the tube with cells on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock the tube by placing it into a 42°C water bath for 90 s.\nPut the tube back on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 800 μL LB medium (without antibiotic) to the tube and incubate in a bacterial shaker at 250 rpm for 60 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nResuspend it by adding 100 μL LB liquid medium (without antibiotic) and transfer the entire amount on one 10 cm LB plate containing 100 μg/mL kanamycin antibiotic. And then, a spreader is used to spread the sample evenly over the surface of a section of the plate. Thereafter, using a fresh, sterile spreader, drag through the first section and spread the bacteria over a second section of the plate, and the step was repeated to create the third section.\nNote: This step could also be done by inoculating loops.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 1 h. After that, invert the plate and continue the incubation at 37°C for approximately 12 h.\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, select a single colony from the LB agar plate.",
    "Drop the tip into 3 mL LB medium with 100 μg/mL kanamycin. Grow the cells in a bacterial shaker at 250 rpm at 37°C for approximately 12 h.\nIncubate 2 mL of the cell culture into 200 mL LB medium with kanamycin (the dilution ratio was 1:100) and grow the cell culture in a bacterial shaker at 250 rpm at 37°C until the OD600≈0.6.\nAdd IPTG at a final concentration of 0.2 mM to the cell culture and incubate it in a bacterial shaker at 250 rpm at 20°C for approximately 12 h.\nCritical: it is important the final concentration of IPTG is 0.2 mM. Do not exceed this concentration. Otherwise, insoluble proteins will be produced, leading to a lower production of the target proteins.\nPellet the cells down by centrifuging them at 1000 g for 5 min (if using a 50 mL centrifuge tube, add about 45 mL of cell culture to the tube, centrifuge at 1000 g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellet. Then add another 45 mL of cell culture to this tube and repeat steps 4–5 times until all the 200 mL of cell culture was pelleted.).\nResuspend the pellet with 3 mL PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (insoluble precipitates may exist) and transfer them to 5 mL centrifuge tube.\nSonicate the pellet solution (with 1 min on/3 min off intervals, with a sonicator at 50% power) in an ice/water slurry bath for approximately 30 min until most of the insoluble precipitates disappear. In our lab, this requires approximately 10 min.",
    "Transfer the cells to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 17 mL PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Sonicate again (with 1 min on/3 min off intervals) in an ice/water slurry bath with a sonicator at 50% power until the mixture becomes clear. In our lab, this requires approximately 30 min.\nNote: We use a QSonica Q125 (with a 1/8 inch tip), whose maximum power is 125 W. Many other suitable sonicators can be used. The above parameters can be used as initial parameters for optimization.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 4°C at 12000 rpm for 10 min and collect the supernatant, which contains the target protein. Save the supernatant and the pellet for analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/716-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Purification of GST-H2B protein\nLeft panel: BL21 cells with GST-H2B plasmids treated with or without IPTG were incubated for 20 h and lysed by sonication. The supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (step 18). ∗ indicates the GST-H2B protein. Right panel: The supernatant in step 31 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, showing that target protein (H2B) was purified by glutathione sepharose 4B.

Western blot analysis of the isolated nucleolar fractions and non-nucleolar fractions (cytoplasmic + nucleoplasmic fractions, CP+NP)",
    "The isolated nucleolar fractions and non-nucleolar fractions (cytoplasmic + nucleoplasmic fractions, CP+NP) were subjected to western blot and indicated proteins were immunoblotted (antibody dilution: NCL, 1:1000; Actin, 1: 1000). Actin: marker of non-nucleoli fraction. NCL: marker of nucleoli fraction (Ginisty et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). WCL: whole cell lysate. This figure is identical to previously published data [Figure 5B in (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])]and is reprinted with permission (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nPrepare the glutathione sepharose 4B beads (steps 20–23).\nGently shake the bottle of glutathione sepharose 4B to resuspend the slurry.\nTransfer 1 mL beads to a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 4 mL PBS and invert to mix. Sediment the medium by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 22 two more times.\nMix the supernatant from step 18 with the prepared beads from step 23 together in a 50 mL tube and rotate it gently for approximately 12 h at 4°C.\nCentrifuge it at 4°C at 500 g for 5 min to collect beads, carefully discard the supernatant until there are approximately 3 mL solution left, resuspend the beads gently.\nTransfer the solution to a 5 mL centrifuge tube, sediment the beads by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL PBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and resuspend gently.\nRotate at 4°C for 10 min. Sediment the beads by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. Carefully discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 27 and 28 two more times for a total of three washes.\nElute the bound protein by adding 2 mL elution buffer and rotate it at 4°C for 6 h.",
    "Critical: Prepare elution buffer just before use. Long time storage of elusion buffer will make glutathione oxidized and lose its function.\nCentrifuge at 4°C at 2000 rpm for 5 min, after which the target protein is contained in the supernatant. Save the supernatant at −80°C for analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPause Point: The supernatant can be stored at −80°C for analysis later.\nNucleolus isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis major step describes the isolation of nucleoli from HEK293T cells.\nHEK293T cells grown to 80%–90% confluence (approximately 2.5 × 106) in one 6 cm dish are sufficient to obtain a sufficient nucleolar fraction for GST-H2B degradation by cellular components (other cell types may need optimization). Please note that the solutions used in the following steps are for a 6 cm dish.\nWhen the cells have grown to 80%–90% confluence, wash the cells gently with 3 mL prewarmed PBS carefully and slowly, and discard the PBS completely. Add 1 mL prewarmed trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37°C for approximately 1 min to detach cells. After adding 2 mL prewarmed complete growth medium, transfer the cells to a 5 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 mL hypotonic buffer A supplemented with 1 mM PMSF to the cell pellet. Resuspend cells and incubate them on ice for 30 min.\nNote: The cells will be swollen at the end of this step. It is important to observe the changes in cell size under a microscope to determine the time of incubation. Other cell types may need optimization.\nTransfer the solution into a prechilled glass Dounce homogenizer on ice.\nStroke up and down promptly and steadily approximately 10 times on ice, making sure the membranes of most cells (>90%) get fragmented while the nuclei remain intact.",
    "Note: the number of strokes needs optimization according to the cell type and Dounce homogenizer used. Insufficient rupture will lead to the cytoplasmic fraction from unbroken cells contaminating the nuclear fraction. In contrast, excessive homogenization will result in breakdown of the nuclear envelope, leading to the loss of soluble nuclear proteins from nuclear fractions (Liang and Cohn, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C. The nuclei will be collected in the precipitate after centrifugation. The cytoplasm (cytoplasmic fraction, CP fraction) will be contained in the supernatant. Save the CP fraction in another 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nResuspend the nuclei with 500 μL S1 solution supplemented with 1 mM PMSF at 4°C.\nAdd 500 μL S2 solution supplemented with 1 mM PMSF to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and then add the S1 solution of step 38 to S2 solution carefully and slowly along the tube wall. Two separated layers can be observed, which represent S2 at the bottom and S1 at the top.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Clean nuclei will be in the pellets.\nResuspend the pellets in 500 μL S2 solution supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and then sonicate in an ice/water slurry bath with a sonicator at 40% power six times, each time for 10 s on and 30 s off.\nNote: We used a QSonica Q125 (with a 1/8 inch tip), whose maximum power is 125 W. Many other suitable sonicators can be used. The above parameters can be used as initial parameters for optimization.",
    "Take a new 1.5 mL tube and add 500 μL S3 solution supplemented with 1 mM PMSF to it. Carefully add the solution obtained from step 41 to the top of the S3 solution along the tube wall. Two separated layers can be observed, which represent S3 at the bottom and S2 at the top.\nCentrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The nucleoli will be in the pellets, and the nucleoplasm fraction (nucleoplasm fraction, NP fraction) will be in the supernatant. Save the supernatant in another microcentrifuge tube.\nResuspend the nucleoli pellet with 500 μL S2 supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and centrifuge at 4°C at 1430 g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 44 two more times for a total of 3 washes.\nResuspend the nucleoli pellet in 500 μL RIPA solution supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Western blotting analyses can be performed to determine the purification efficiency of the nucleolar fractions (step 46) and non-nucleolar fractions (cytoplasmic + nucleopasmic fractions, CP+NP) (step 37 and step 43) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Up to this step, it is ready for the GST-H2B degradation assay and ubiquitination assay.\nIf long-term preservation of nucleoli is needed, keep the nucleoli in RIPA solution at −80°C.\nPause Point: store the nucleoli (step 47), the nucleoplasm fraction (step 43) and cytoplasmic fraction (step 37) at −80°C for analysis later.\nIn vitro analysis of GST-H2B degradation by the nucleoli fraction.\nTiming: 2 days\nIn vitro analyses of GST-H2B degradation by different cellular fractions are performed by establishing the reaction systems indicated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/716-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
