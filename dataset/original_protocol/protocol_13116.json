    "1. Worm locomotor activity analysis in liquid media on glass slides using ZebraLab software\nNematode growth and handling\n\t\nGrow C. elegans on Petri plates containing nematode growth media (NGM) and spread with Escherichia coli OP50 as food source. Maintain worm culture at 20 °C, as previously described8.\nSynchronize worms performing a timed egg lay52 and study worms at the desired stage. In this protocol, L4 stage worms were analyzed.\nGrow control and mutant worm strains on NGM plates with and without drug treatments to be tested or buffer control. To evaluate the drug treatment effects, prepare the desired drug stock concentration in S. basal solution; spread the calculated specific volume onto the NGM plates and allow it to dry. Transfer the worms at a specific larval or adult stage and maintain on the drug treatment plate for the desired duration before analysis.\nExperimental set-up of worms for locomotor activity video recording and ZebraLab analysis\n\t\nPick 5 synchronized L4 worms per strain and condition using a worm pick. Pipette a single 20 µL drop of S. basal solution onto a glass slide located under a stereomicroscope connected to a camera and transfer 5 worms into it (Figure 1A,B). Transfer the 5 worms from the Petri dish containing NGM and E. coli OP50 to the liquid drop only at the moment preceding the recording.\n\t\tNOTE: Continue to maintain the other worms on the Petri dish until the prior video is recorded. This will avoid the damage caused on the other worms due to the drying up of the 20 µl drops during the procedure (dry time ~15-20 min).\nPipette multiple drops on one slide to obtain multiple technical replicates (Figure 1A). Select worms from different NGM plates (biological replicate). Do not use cover slip.",
    "Adjust the microscope's working distance to visualize the complete area of a single drop. Set and maintain a low video resolution (<1024 x 768) to upload the files in the software.\nAllow worms to acclimate on the slide at room temperature for 1 min before recording.\nRecord the worm swim activity in 1 drop for 1 min at 15 frames per second (fps). Repeat the imaging for each additional drop on the plate.\nC. elegans locomotor activity recording analysis in ZebraLab software\n\t\nUse the option ZEBRALAB AVI to upload videos to the software. Click on the option Quantization with AVI Files (Figure 1C).\nTo create a new protocol, select File > Generate Protocol, and then add the number of areas selected for the analysis. Choose Location Count: 1.\nOpen Protocol Parameters and select 1 min in the Experiment Duration window. Select a different experimental duration for different experimental durations. Select or deselect the window No Time Bin and choose Integration Period, depending on the data output desired. In this study No Time Bin was selected (Figure 1D).\n\t\t​NOTE: Time bin is the time over which the activity will be averaged.\nIf a protocol was already created, select Open Protocol and select the saved protocol (in .vte format).\nSelect File and Open a Movie to upload each individual video file that was previously recorded.\nSelect the Area icon indicated in Figure 1E (black arrow) to build a single area of detection and create an area around the whole liquid drop where worms are located. Click on Select, then the green circle icon (gray arrow) under Areas > Build > Clear marks.\n\t\tNOTE: The activity of all worms in the defined drop will be detected in the selected area (Figure 1E,F).",
    "Go to Calibration > Draw scale (Figure 1E) and draw a horizontal line from the left to the right of the video area. Indicate the real distance to calibrate. Then select Apply to Group.\nUnselect the icon selected to build the area (arrow in Figure 1E) and select or deselect Transparent.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, Transparent was selected and gave better results.\nAdjust Detection Sensitivity and Activity Threshold to allow the detection of all the different C. elegans worm strains analyzed.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment, the Detection Sensitivity was set at 8 with Burst and Freezing values of 15 and 2, respectively (Figure 1F).\nSet Display Scale at 70 to visualize the track made by the animal while activity analysis is underway. Then select Apply to Group (Figure 1F).\nClick on Experiment > Execute > Save as, and then on Start. A window opens. Choose Do you want to process the video media at maximum computer speed? to analyze the video quickly (e.g., a 1 min video recording is analyzed by the in ZebraLab software in 5 s).\nAnother window opens: Running Experiment; click on Start to proceed with the experiment.\nAfter the video recording is complete, the analysis stops. Click on Experiment > Stop. This saves the activity analyzed from a single drop in a spreadsheet.\nRepeat the analysis for each video of individual drop. Each drop is one technical replicate.\nOutput and analysis of ZebraLab data\n\tNOTE: After the experiment, data from each video is individually saved as separate spreadsheets in the chosen folder. In the data output file, the integrated activity level of all worms moving in an individual drop is recorded as pixel changes under actinteg.\n\t\nOpen each spreadsheet obtained from the analysis of each video. Compile them manually into a single file.",
    "​Normalize the mutant and wild-type data to a percent of control. Here, statistical analyses were performed to compare mean activity levels between groups.\n2. Worm locomotor activity analysis in liquid media in 96-well plate format by WormScan software analysis\nNematode growth and handling\n\t\nGrow C. elegans as described in section 1.1.1.\nSynchronize worms as described in section 1.1.2.\nGrow worms on specific media as described in section 1.1.3 until L4 stage or day 1 adult.\nExperimental set-up of worms in 96-well plate for WormScan activity analysis\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of 2% weight per volume of E. coli OP50 in liquid suspension in S. basal medium to each well of a 96-well, clear, flat-bottom, microplate, as previously described49,53.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, manually pick 15 synchronized worms at L4 stage or day 1 adult from their NGM plates into liquid media within each experimental well of the 96-well microplate. Allow the worms to acclimate to the liquid media for 20 min before scanning.\n\t\tNOTE: Other animal stages and ages can be readily substituted for study.\nWormScan activity analysis in 96-well plate and data export to spreadsheet.\n\t\nScan each 96-well, clear, flat-bottom, microplate twice sequentially using a standard flatbed scanner, with less than 10 s between scans.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the photo scanner with resolution of 1,200 dots/in and 16-bit grayscale was used to produce jpeg images. Time required to scan four 96-well plates using the photo scanner is less than 10 min.\nAlign the two sequential scans (Figure 2A) using open source software49.",
    "NOTE: The software generates a difference image to evaluate pixel changes between the two sequential images for a region of interest (Figure 2B) and a relative WormScan Score. This WormScan Score is equivalent to changes in locomotor response based on the light intensity produced by the scanner when set to a pixel threshold of 5 (Figure 2C).\nExport the data from WormScan as a spreadsheet. Save the spreadsheet containing the data to the local computer. Normalize the data as percentage of control (POC) and compare across biological replicate experiments for diverse mutant or treatment conditions. Perform statistical analysis to compare mutant and control means using student t-test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
