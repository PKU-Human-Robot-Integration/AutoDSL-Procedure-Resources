    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of Campylobacter spp. from the chicken cecal contents\nTiming: 48 h\nSample collection and processing: Place freshly collected fecal contents from broiler chickens in sterile 1× PBS (pH 7.4). Samples should be kept on ice and processed immediately (Singh and Mallick, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nPlace the chicken on top of the cage.\nHumanely kill the chickens in accordance with the approved animal ethics protocol.\nLay the chicken on its back on tissue paper and clean the surface of the chicken thoroughly in 70% ethanol.\nNote: This important step reduces the risk of contaminating the tissue sample.\nPin the sacrificed chicken down to secure the chicken to a tray at the wings, shoulders, and legs.\nUse a pair of sterile scissors to remove the skin of the chicken, starting from the lower abdomen and to the top of the thorax to expose the digestive tract.\nCut the cecum pair and gently place it in a sterile petri-plate.\nCarefully clean the outer surface of the cecum using a sterile scalpel to remove the mucous or blood clots.\nCut the cecum longitudinally.\nUse a sterile scalpel to scrape and gently rub the inner epithelial surface of the cecum and take the cecal content into the sterile micro-centrifuge tube.\nSuspend 500 mg cecal content in 1 mL of sterile 1× PBS. Mix the cecum content by vortexing for 10 min to make a homogenous mixture.\nSerially dilute homogenized samples up to 10-3 in Mueller Hinton broth (MH broth).\nInoculate 100 μL sample from 10-3 dilution and spread onto Blood Free Campylobacter Selectivity Agar Base media supplemented with CAT Selective Supplement (cefoperazone 8 mg/L, amphotericin 10 mg/L, and teicoplanin 4 mg/L).",
    "Incubate the agar plates at 42°C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions (10% CO2, 5% O2, and 85% N2).\nColonies that grow on the plate can be subjected to further analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1622-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Identification of T6SS+ C. jejuni from cecal content of chickens\n(A) Schematic of sample collection, processing, and identification of C. jejuni. Cecal content from commercial broilers was collected, serially diluted in MH broth, and plated onto Blood free Campylobacter selective agar media. After overnight incubation (∼18 h), bacterial colonies were subjected to further characterization.\n(B) Morphological features and differential staining characteristics of the isolated bacteria. Flat, gray, glistening colonies with rough edges appeared on the plate. Gram-negative spiral-shaped bacteria were visualized under a light microscope (Scale bar: 20 μm) and scanning electron microscopy (Scale bar: 4 μm).\n(C) Diagrammatic representation bacterial motility assessment: Following spot inoculation of single colony onto a soft agar plate, the bacteria were grown for 24–48 h. The swarming ability of C. jejuni was assessed by measuring the diameter of hallow formation around the colonies at different time points.\n(D) A catalase test for the identification of Campylobacter sp. The individual colony was picked and added into a 4% H2O2 solution. Typical bubble formation (red arrow) in H2O2 solution indicates rapid liberation of oxygen bubbles due to the presence of catalase specific to the Campylobacter sp.\n(E) An oxidase test for the identification of Campylobacter sp. Bacterial inoculum was added to a blotting paper soaked with an oxidase solution. The inoculated area turned blue (red arrow) due to the production of bluish indophenol, confirming the presence of cytochrome c oxidase in Campylobacter sp.",
    "(F) A hippurate hydrolysis test for the identification of Campylobacter jejuni. The individual colony was incubated with 1% Hippurate solution, and then a ninhydrin solution was overlaid on the top. The appearance of purple (red arrow) confirms the presence of hippuricase enzyme specific for C. jejuni.\nIdentification of Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni)\nTiming: 1 h (Related to Sub-step 3-a)\nTiming: 7 h (Related to Sub-step 3-b)\nTiming: 24–48 h (Related to Sub-Step 4)\nTiming: 30 min (Related to Sub-step 5-a)\nTiming: 30 min (Related to Sub-step 5-b)\nTiming: 2 h 30 min (Related to Sub-step 5-c)\nIdentification of C. jejuni from mixed culture can be achieved by colony morphology, bacterial morphology, biochemical character, and bacterial motility assay.\nColony morphology. Colony morphology can be useful to identify the bacteria present in a mixed culture as the colony of bacteria is distinguishable from each other based on their appearance, shape, and color.\nFor morphological characterization, examine the colonies that appeared on selective media for size, shape, elevation, color, surface type, odor, etc.\nExamine the subjected colonies for further characterization, such as morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Usually, C. jejuni forms a milky-white, glistening colony with rough edges on Blood Free Campylobacter Selective Media.\nMorphological characterization. The size and shape of bacteria are relatively stable under suitable conditions. It is important to know the morphological structure of bacteria, as morphology provides a better understanding of bacterial physiology and allows to characterize them by species. The Gram Staining procedure and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) can be used as key techniques to characterize bacterial morphology.\nGram staining. Conventional Gram Staining protocol (Coico, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) can be followed to identify C. jejuni by its Gram-negative and spiral shape character (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Take bacterial samples from an overnight grown (18–24 h) culture and prepare a smear on a glass slide.\nNote: To prepare a good smear, bacteria cells from a culture should be laid out using a sterile loop in circular motions to make a thin film over a small area of a microscope slide.\nAir-dry cell smear. Heat fix the slide by passing it over a heat source (flame) several times to kill and firmly adhere bacteria on the glass slide (Madani, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Smear quality affects gram staining results. Pass the slide over the heat source quickly to avoid excessive heating during heat fixation.\nFlood the dried smear with crystal violet staining reagent for 1 min.\nDiscard the flooded crystal violet stain and wash the slide under a slow stream of tap water for 5 s.\nCover the smear with Gram’s iodine and wait for 1 min.\nDiscard the residual Gram’s iodine and wash the slide under a slow stream of tap water for 5 s.\nAdd decolorizing agent (95% ethanol) and keep it for 15 s.\nRinse the slide under a slow stream of water for 10 s.\nAfter completely drying, flood the slide with a safranin counterstain and wait for another 30 s.\nWash the slide under a slow stream of tap water until no color appears in the effluent.\nObserve the results of the staining procedure under oil immersion using a brightfield microscope (Objective magnification 60×) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: As C. jejuni is a Gram-negative bacterium with less peptidoglycan in the cell wall, it cannot retain the crystal violet stain and hence acquire the counterstain (safranin) to shade pink color.",
    "Field Emission Scanning Electron microscope (FESEM). To visualize the cell morphology, cell integrity, and cell-to-cell adherent properties at a higher resolution (14,990×), FESEM can be performed (Relucenti et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTake the bacterial culture and adjust the OD600 to ∼0.6 by adding a fresh medium. Further, take 1 mL of the culture and centrifuge it at 5,000 × g for 6 min at room temperature (∼25°C).\nResuspend the cells with 300 μL of 1× PBS and centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 6 min. Repeat this step for two more rounds.\nTo fix the cells, add 300 μL of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde to the cell mixture and incubate at room temperature (∼25°C) for 1 h. Further, centrifuge the cells at 5,000 × g for 6 min.\nWash the cell pellet thrice with 300 μL of 1× PBS for 10 min each.\nResuspend the cells using 300 μL of 35% ethanol and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (∼25°C). Further, centrifuge the cells at 5,000 × g for 6 min.\nDehydrate the fixed cells sequentially at 50%, 70%, and 95% ethanol as mentioned in the previous step (Sub-step 3; b; v).\nAfter that, resuspend the cells using 500 μL of 100% ethanol followed by 1 h incubation for complete dehydration.\nCast 10 μL of the sample on a small cover slip or silicon wafer.\nDry the cover slip at room temperature (∼25°C) for 2 h.\nFinally, vacuum-dry the fixed and dehydrated samples for 1 h and fix them to aluminum stubs.\nThereafter, put the aluminum stub with the sample inside the coating instrument.\nThen sputter-coat the sample with platinum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Method video of FESEM sample fixation to aluminum stubs with silver conductive paint and sputter-coating with gold, related to step 3b).",
    "Capture the images of the Platinum-coated samples using the secondary electron detector under a high vacuum at 6 kV, with an 8 mm distance and 30 μM objective lens apertures, magnifications ranging from 3,000× to 20,000×.\nNote: We used Supra 55 Carl Zeiss scanning electron microscopes for our experimental purposes. We observed the cell morphology (spiral-shaped) and integrity of C. jejuni.\nBacterial motility assay. Motility is the ability of some bacteria to move. Using metabolic energy, bacterial flagella facilitate this movement in the culture or inside the hosts and is considered one of the key virulence phenotypes. As C. jejuni is a flagellated bacterium, motility phenotypes represent a critical virulence determinant for C. jejuni.\nCritical: Do not use high agar concentration to study bacterial motility. A higher agar concentration in the medium may cause inhibition of bacterial motility.\nPour 0.4% Mueller Hinton Agar (MH agar) into each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate.\nAdjust the absorbance (OD600) of the culture to 1.00.\nInoculate 5 μL of the culture as a spot in the center of the agar and let it dry.\nIncubate the inoculated plate for 24 h at 42°C under micro-aerophilic conditions.\nAfter 24 h, measure the diameter (in a millimeter-scale) of the spread zone with a ruler throughout the area of growth around the central point of the plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: As C. jejuni are motile and flagellated bacteria, bacterial spots on the agar surface should be outspread (hallow) from the center to the periphery (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Hallow formation is absent in the case of non-motile bacteria.",
    "Biochemical characterization. Biochemical tests are commonly used to accurately identify the bacterial genus or species based on differences in their biochemical activities. The standard biochemical tests rely on nutrient utilization (carbohydrate utilization, amino acid degradation, lipid degradation), resistance to inhibitory substances (high salt, antibiotics, etc.), enzyme production (catalase, oxidase, hippuricase, etc.) of particular bacteria. To identify and characterize C. jejuni, biochemical tests such as Catalase, Oxidase, and Hippurate hydrolysis test can be performed. Bacteria can be grown either on agar plates or in broth culture, depending on the type of the biochemical test. Bacteria can be incubated for 18–24 h in microaerophilic conditions (85% N2, 10% CO2, and 5% O2) at 37°C to obtain bacterial growth on agar plates (distinguishable colony) as well as in broth (OD600∼0.6).\nCatalase test. The catalase test helps identify the bacteria that have catalase enzymes. As C. jejuni is a catalase-positive bacterial species, this assay can be helpful in the species-level identification of C. jejuni. A catalase enzyme in a C. jejuni can be scrutinized when bacterial inoculum is mixed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution.\n   H 2   O 2   → Catalase     H 2  O  +    O 2     ( Bubbles )   \nCritical: To limit catalase aerosols, which have been shown to carry viable bacterial cells, petri dish is strongly recommended. Be careful not to pick up any agar.\nPlace a microscope slide inside a petri dish.\nKeep the petri dish cover available.\nPlace one drop of 4% H2O2 onto the bacteria on the microscope slide using a dropper.\nUsing a sterile inoculating loop or wooden stick, collect a small amount of well-isolated colony and place it onto the microscope slide.\nImmediately cover the petri dish with a lid to limit aerosols and observe immediate bubble formation.",
    "Observing the formation of bubbles against a dark background enhances readability. Alternative Protocol:\nTake 1 mL of well-grown (18–24 h after primary culture) culture in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 6,000 × g for 5 min and decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nAdd 150 μL of 30% H2O2 solution.\nObserving the formation of bubbles against a dark background enhances readability (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: As C. jejuni is catalase-positive, it can facilitate the breakdown of H2O2 into oxygen and water. This is exhibited by the rapid release of oxygen and forms bubbles.\nOxidase test. The Oxidase test determines the ability of bacteria to synthesize cytochrome oxidase and is used to identify Neisseria, Moraxella, Campylobacter, and Pasteurella spp (oxidase positive). Cytochrome oxidase catalyzes electron transport from donor compounds (NADH) to acceptors (usually oxygen). The test reagent, N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD), serves as an electron acceptor. The oxidized reagent forms the colored compound indophenol blue, suggesting positive test results.\nCritical: Let the filter paper dry after adding oxidase reagent.\nSoak a small filter paper in an oxidase reagent and let it dry.\nUsing a loop, pick a well-isolated colony from a fresh bacterial plate (grown overnight for 18–24 h), rub it onto treated filter paper, and wait for 10–15 min.\nObserve for color changes to blue, indicating oxidase-positive (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: As C. jejuni is oxidase-positive, blue color forms in the presence of N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride.",
    "Hippurate hydrolysis test. The hippurate hydrolysis test aims to confirm the presence of the hippuricase enzyme in bacteria. It is primarily used to identify C. jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, the hippurate hydrolysis test is a reliable assay to differentiate C. jejuni from the other Campylobacter spp. such as C. coli and C. upsaliensis since the latter does not produce hippuricase enzymes. This biochemical assay is based on the ability of C. jejuni to hydrolyze sodium hippurate to benzoic acid and glycine using the hippuricase enzyme. Further glycine is deaminated by the oxidizing action of ninhydrin which forms reduced ninhydrin, resulting in a purple-colored complex.\nCritical: The bacteria wash step (steps 2 and 3) is essential to remove the content of the medium that may give false-positive results.\nSuspend a loop full of the well-isolated colonies from a fresh (18–24 h) bacterial plate in 5 mL MH broth and grow the culture for 18–24 h (OD600∼0.6) at 37°C in microaerophilic condition (85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% O2).\nCentrifuge the grown culture at 5,000 × g for 6 min and discard the supernatant.\nTo wash the bacterial cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL 1× PBS (pH∼7.4). Centrifuge the suspension at 5,000 × g for 6 min. Repeat this step three times.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL of 1%-hippurate solution and incubate the mixture for 2 h at 37°C.\nThen slowly add 200 μL of the 3.5%-ninhydrin solution to the side of the tube to form an overlay and re-incubate at 37°C for 20 min.\nSee the formation of purple color (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: Identified bacteria, which are characterized as Gram-negative, spiral in shape, motile and positive for catalase, oxidase, and hippurate hydrolysis test, can be performed for further molecular and phenotypic characterization.",

As hcp is a hallmark gene of T6SS machinery, determining the hcp gene sequence can also be performed by the Sanger Sequencing technique.\nPCR amplification of 16S rRNA and hcp genes by gene-specific primer set (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and PCR condition (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nPCR products can be purified by a PCR purification kit (Thermo Scientific) using the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/documentconnect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fpurelink_pcr_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/documentconnect.html?url=https%253A%252F%252Fassets.thermofisher.com%252FTFS-Assets%252FLSG%252Fmanuals%252Fpurelink_pcr_man.pdf]) and subjected to Sanger sequencing.\nTo identify the bacteria at the species level, we used 16S rRNA sequences (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), while phylogenetic relatedness among the T6SS positive C. jejuni with other Gram-ve bacteria-harboring T6SS was determined from the hcp sequence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPerform BLAST analysis of the DNA sequence. To analyze the nucleotide sequence in BLAST, open the histogram of the Sanger sequencing data and copy the sequence. After that go to browser and open search NCBI BLAST and select Nucleotide BLAST. Then paste the copied sequence and click on BLAST option.

    "Create a phylogenetic tree by the MEGA X software. To generate a phylogenetic tree among the 16S rRNA gene of C. jejuni using MEGA software, download a few sequences of C. jejuni 16S rRNA gene from the NCBI website in the FASTA format. Then create a text file, and merge all the sequences including the sequence of C. jejuni isolate. After that in MEGA software open a file and go to align, to build and create a new alignment. Next, select the DNA option and select the same text file to get the alignment data. Then, export the alignment in MEGA format.

    "Biofilm formation assay. Similar to other bacterial pathogens, the ability to form biofilms is an important virulence mechanism concerning the transmission of disease-causing Campylobacter spp. to humans (Mah, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Bridier et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). As we are looking into virulent T6SS+ve C. jejuni, a biofilm assay can be helpful to identify and characterize C. jejuni.\nCritical: Glacial acetic acid can cause eye and upper respiratory tract irritation.\nPrecautionary measures: Use nitrile rubber gloves as glacial acetic acid perforates latex gloves.

These selective advantages raise the interest to study the nature of interbacterial interactions. Here, we have demonstrated the procedure to establish interbacterial interaction between C. jejuni and E. coli.\nGeneration of GFP expressing E. coli. To differentiate competing bacteria during inter-bacterial interaction, bacterial cells should possess morphological or chromogenic heterogeneity. For this, we have generated GFP-expressing E. coli which have been effectively used during co-culture experiments to differentiate prey (E. coli, green colonies) and predator bacteria (C. jejuni, milky white colonies).\nNote: Prepare chemically competent E. coli (DH5α) cells and store them at −80°C.\nNote: Commercially obtained cells also can be used as an alternative.\nCritical: Do not thaw the competent cells till other reagents are ready; this may affect the competency of the cells. Do not use more than 500 ng of plasmid DNA for the transformation; a high amount of DNA may cause bacterial lawn formation after plating, which affects the selection of positive transformant cells. Do not give heat shock for more than 45 sec, which may cause cell death.\nTake out E. coli (DH5α) competent cell vial from −80°C and thaw in ice for 10 min.\nAdd 300 ng plasmid DNA (pTurbo GFP-B plasmid) to the competent cell.\nGently tap the tube 2–3 times to mix cells and place the vial into ice again for 30 min.\nNote: Set the heat-block temp to 42°C.\nAfter that, place the vial in the heat block for 45 s.\nImmediately chill the vial on ice for 10 min.",

    "(B) Experimental setup for assessing interbacterial interaction (C. jejuni vs. E. coli) in co-cultures. Each bacterium was mixed and co-incubated for 10 h, washed, and serially diluted to quantify and image the competing bacteria. The red circle on the culture plate shows a GFP-expressing E. coli colony, while the blue circle represents the C. jejuni colony. The CFU values can be obtained by counting the colonies on the plate. These data can be fitted with a mathematical model to extract important parameters for the interspecies interaction. For instance, we demonstrate a mathematical model fitting prey and predator cell densities (denoted by [Ec] and [Cj], respectively). This helps determine the birth rates of each bacteria (rEc and rCj) and the predation rate (α).

During inter-bacterial interaction, one bacteria act as prey while another one predator. Usually, due to predator pressure, prey bacteria get eliminated from the ecological niche. During the inter-bacterial interaction, morphological changes (such as cell blebbing, cell elongation) can be observed in prey bacteria. These morphological changes can be observed using an epifluorescence microscope in the ApoTome module.\nCo-culture GFP-E. coli and C. jejuni, as mentioned earlier section (Sub-step 12; a).\nAfter 10 h, harvest 2 mL of the co-culture by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cell pellet with 200 μL of 1× PBS, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min to discard the supernatant.

    "To visualize the invaded C. jejuni cells, use a DAPI filter with an excitation wavelength of 300–450 nm and an emission wavelength of 380–650 nm.\nNote: For our experimental purposes, we used the Leica confocal microscope for image acquisition at an objective magnification of 60× (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR to check the hcp gene expression. To examine whether the host responses were associated with the expression of the major T6SS gene, the transcriptional profile of hcp can be studied.\nGrow monolayer of human INT407 cells in 24-well tissue culture plate (3 × 105 cells/well).\nAdd C. jejuni at MOI 300:1 when the cells become 70% confluent.\nIncubate for 5 h at 5% CO2 and 37°C in DMEM and supplemented with 10% FBS.\nFollowing incubation, remove the culture media and wash the cells with 500 μL of 1× PBS three times.\nAdd 300 μL TrizoL reagent.\nCritical: TriZol is a hazardous chemical that can cause severe chemical burns and permanent scarring. This step should be performed in a fume hood with a lab coat and nitrile gloves.\nDo vigorous pipetting to detach the cells. Take the solution in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube at room temperature (∼25°C) for 20–30 min.\nIsolate the RNA and prepare the cDNA as mentioned earlier (Sub-step 14; c–m).\nUsing PCR cycling conditions, amplify the C. jejuni 16S rRNA gene from the cDNA (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nRun equal volume of the PCR product on 1% agarose gel. Quantify the band intensity using ImageLab software (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]: ImageLab software user method video to quantify band intensity during semi-quantitative PCR, related to step 18).\nAmplify hcp gene using equal volume cDNA.
