    "Population genetic analyses of Z. tritici at different spatial scales have revealed high levels of genetic variation even within single lesions (Linde et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0036]). Depending on the specific research objectives, this variation should already be considered when sampling Z. tritici in the field. For a representative sampling of genetic variation, a hierarchical sampling design can be applied, in which infected wheat leaves are collected from individual sub-plots along a transect (McDonald, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0064]). Most importantly, samples should be properly labeled with a code that allows derivation of the origin of the isolate and that considers the different levels of sampling (field, plot, sub-plot, plant, leaf, lesion).\nFresh leaves can immediately be used for Z. tritici isolation, or leaves can be mounted on paper sheets and stored for later isolations. Such “herbarium” specimens should be well dried and stored in a dry and dark place at room temperature, where they can be kept up to several months until isolations are performed. Due to the destructive nature of isolation, we advise recording information about the leaf by taking a photograph before it is used for isolation, numbering each leaf as well as each lesion on each leaf separately (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]). In this way, it will later be possible to trace back to the original virulence phenotype, e.g., as lesion size, pycnidia density, and overall appearance of the leaf.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dd556fd6-c2f0-497f-be51-3fd57ef9b1bf/cpmc128-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Workflow of Z. tritici isolation from wheat leaf lesions. (A) Symptomatic wheat leaves are detached from the plant, mounted to paper sheets, and labeled, with each leaf and each lesion numbered separately. (B) After surface sterilization, selected leaf sections with lesions are placed on metal grids inside petri dishes with wet Whatman paper. (C) After 5 days of incubation, pycnidiospores are released in cirrhi from pycnidia (white arrows). The scale bar represents 250 µm. Spores are then transferred to YMS agar plates with 50 µg/ml kanamycin, and colonies become visible after ∼7 days. (D) To obtain pure single-spore isolates, a few cells from the grown colonies are picked and streaked out onto a new YMS plate, following a “zig-zag” pattern. The shown plate was incubated at 18°C for 6 days. (E) Using a single colony from the last round of isolation, cells are spread on a small area (∼4 mm2) of a fresh YMS plate. The scale bar represents 10 mm. (F) Schematic representation of the single-spore isolation pattern. Note that the first line (straight, solid brown line) and the second line (“zig-zag”-patterned, dashed yellow line) are done with separate sterile toothpicks.\nNOTE: We recommend performing the following method of isolation using aseptic techniques under a laminar flow hood and/or close to a Bunsen burner.\nMaterials\nSterile water\n1.2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite in aqueous solution\nTween® 20 (e.g., Roth, cat. no. 9127.1)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nLeaf samples with necrotic lesions containing pycnidia\nYMS agar plates with and without 50 µg/ml kanamycin (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-rec-0006])\nSterile tweezers\nSterile Whatman paper or filter paper (disc-shaped to fit in petri dish)\nSterile petri dishes\nSterile metal grid or equivalent\n50-ml Falcon tubes\nSterile scissors\nParafilm\nMicrobiological incubator with temperature control, 18°C\nDissecting microscope",
    "Sterilized fine dissecting needles or fine syringe needles (e.g., insulin needles, Gr. 14, Braun, cat. no. 4657640) (see step 9)\nSterile toothpicks\nSterile 1000-µl pipet tips (optional)\n1. Using sterile tweezers, put a sterile Whatman or filter paper inside bottom of a sterile petri dish for each sample. Place a sterile metal grid or equivalent on top of it and wet paper with 2 to 3 ml sterile water.\nThe metal grid or something similar should fit inside the petri dish and allow you to position the samples to have them fully exposed to the humidity without touching the bottom (see Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002] and step 7).\n2. For each sample, prepare the following for leaf surface sterilization in 50-ml Falcon tubes: 1.2% sodium hypochlorite in aqueous solution with a few drops of Tween® 20, 70% ethanol with a few drops Tween® 20, and two tubes of sterile water.\nTo avoid mixing up samples, each lesion (that is, one leaf section) should be treated individually throughout the whole isolation procedure. We recommend conducting the surface sterilization process for the individual leaf sections in separate Falcon tubes.\n3. Excise 3- to 4-cm sections from leaf material (leaf samples with necrotic lesions containing pycnidia) using sterile scissors and select sections with lesions and pycnidia.\n4. Submerge excised leaf sections in the 1.2% sodium hypochlorite solution and wash for 3 min by gently inverting each tube.\n5. Transfer leaves with sterile tweezers into 70% ethanol and wash for 15 s by gently inverting each tube.\n6. Transfer leaves with sterile tweezers into the first tube of sterile water and wash leaves for ≥30 s by gently inverting each tube. Repeat wash step in the second tube of sterile water.\nWash the leaves until the chlorine smell is gone.",
    "7. Place surface-sterilized leaves onto the metal grid inside a petri dish (see step 1) using sterile tweezers, as shown in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]. Prepare one petri dish per leaf section.\nAvoid allowing the leaves to touch the filter paper.\nLabel the dishes with sample ID and lesion number.\n8. Seal dishes with Parafilm and incubate at 20°C with a 16-hr light period until pycnidiospores are released in cirrhi (a mucilage that groups spores together; Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]), usually after 5 days.\nSimilar conditions for incubation can also work, e.g., simply keeping the plates on the laboratory bench as long as the temperature does not exceed 25°C.\nEnvironmental samples can be highly variable and can contain a large diversity of endophytic, putatively unwanted microorganisms. Hence, it is important to monitor the leaf sections daily for Z. tritici cirrhi emergence and growth of other endophytes that might contaminate the isolation. Incubation periods should be kept as short as possible to avoid such contaminations.\n9. Under a dissecting microscope, pick pycnidiospores (emerging from one pycnidium in one cirrhus) with a sterilized fine dissecting needle or fine syringe needle.\nSterilize the needle by dipping the tip in 70% ethanol and passing it through a Bunsen burner flame to burn off the ethanol. Ensure that the needle is cooled before touching pycnidiospores.\nAvoid exposing the leaves to the light source for a prolonged time because it will dry out the cirrhi and make transfer difficult.\nTo facilitate pycnidiospore isolation, mount the leaf pieces on a sterile filter paper disc over a Styrofoam base using sterilized needles (e.g., simple pins). This fixates the leaves and helps in picking single cirrhi.\n10. Transfer pycnidiospores to YMS agar plates with 50 µg/ml kanamycin by gently dipping the needle with the picked spores into the agar.",
    "Pick pycnidiospores from each pycnidium just once and sterilize the needle between pycnidia. Divide YMS plates into eight compartments to reduce the total number of plates required (see Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002] and 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]).\n11. Seal plates with Parafilm and incubate at 18°C for 3 to 7 days, until small colonies are visible.\nColonies are often cream colored to pinkish, resembling yeast-like growth (see Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]). Monitor plates for growth of contaminating organisms frequently.\n12. Pick cells from a colony with a sterile toothpick and streak out onto a new YMS agar plate with 50 µg/ml kanamycin.\nTake only a few cells from the colony; the amount that sticks to the toothpick tip is sufficient. “Draw” a single straight line with this toothpick (see Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]).\n13. On the same new YMS agar plate from step 12, use another sterile toothpick to streak out a second continuous line in “zig-zag” (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002] and 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]). Seal plates and incubate at 18°C for 5 to 7 days, until single colonies appear around “zig-zag” line.\n14. Repeat steps 12 and 13 on YMS agar plates without kanamycin using cells from a well-separated single colony.\nThese two rounds of purification allow the researcher to obtain colonies grown from single fungal cells, which are mandatory to obtain pure, single cell–derived Z. tritici isolates.\n15. Pick a single colony from this last round of isolation and spread it onto a small surface area (∼4 mm2; Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]) on a fresh YMS agar plate without kanamycin using a sterile 1000-µl pipet tip or toothpick. Incubate plates for 5 days at 18°C. Use cells grown in this colony for any downstream procedures, such as species confirmation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0002]) and inoculation of cultures for long-term storage (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0005]).",
    "Z. tritici species identification solely based on disease symptoms and in vitro phenotypes is challenging, so we recommend verifying the species identity of isolates obtained from field collections. To this end, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by amplicon sequencing of a conserved nuclear locus (e.g., internal transcribed spacer rDNA, beta-tubulin, actin) represents a well-established procedure to discriminate Z. tritici specimens from other plant-associated fungi (Crous, Aptroot, Kang, Braun, & Wingfield, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0012]; Fraaije, Lovell, Rohel, & Hollomon, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0016]; Quaedvlieg et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0045]). Based on the following protocol, isolates can be readily confirmed by PCR and amplicon sequencing using only small amounts of cells from the last single-colony isolation step in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001] and a “rapid DNA extraction” method (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0003]). Once PCR and amplicon sequencing are done, online databases, alignment tools, and software such as NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]), BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]), Geneious (https://www.geneious.com[href=https://www.geneious.com]), and Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com[href=https://www.blast2go.com]) can be used to align the sequences and support species identification by DNA sequence homology. The following PCR protocol uses crude template genomic DNA (gDNA) from a rapid extraction method (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0003]) and primer pairs for two loci, ITS and beta-tubulin (TUB2), that have been described previously (Glass & Donaldson, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0018]; O'Donnell & Cigelnik, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0041]; Weir, Johnston, & Damm, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0056]; White, Bruns, Lee, & Taylor, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0057]) (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-tbl-0001]).\nTable 1.\n                Primer Sequences for Amplification of ITS and Beta-Tubulin\ntable:\n﻿Locus,Primer,Orientation,Sequence (5′-3′),Length (bp),Reference\nITS,ITS5,Forward,GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG,22,\"White et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0057]\"\nITS,ITS4,Reverse,TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC,20,\"White et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0057]\"\nTUB2,T1,Forward,AACATGCGTGAGATTGTAAGT,21,\"O'Donnell & Cigelnik, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0041]\"\nTUB2,Bt2b,Reverse,ACCCTCAGTGTAGTGACCCTTGGC,24,\"Glass & Donaldson, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0018]\"\nNOTE: Experiments involving PCR require extremely careful technique to prevent contamination.\nMaterials\nTemplate gDNA (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0003])\n5× Phusion High Fidelity (HF) Buffer (e.g., NEB, cat. no.

    "For ITS PCR, use the primer pair ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0057]). For beta-tubulin PCR, primers T1 and Bt2b (Glass & Donaldson, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0018]; O'Donnell & Cigelnik, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0041]) should be used. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-tbl-0001] for details.\nIt is recommended to prepare a master mix of the reaction components (minus the template gDNA) and to distribute the required volume into each tube/well prior to adding the template gDNA. Prepare the master mix with a slightly greater volume than required to avoid insufficient volume due to pipetting inaccuracy. Make sure to include negative- and positive-control reactions for each primer pair (e.g., substitute template gDNA with sterile water and use template gDNA from a previously confirmed Z. tritici isolate, respectively).\n2. Preheat thermocycler to 98°C prior to entering the reaction tubes/plates and set lid temperature to 98°C to avoid condensation in lids. For the PCR reactions to amplify the target DNA, use the following program:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nInitial step:,30 s,98°C (initial denaturation)\n35 cycles:,8 s,98°C (denaturation)\n,20 s,x°C (annealing)\n,30 s,72°C (extension)\n,8 min,72°C (final extension).\nx°C = 50°C for ITS and 55°C for beta-tubulin.\nPCR products can be stored at 4°C until they are analyzed via gel electrophoresis and submitted to sequencing. For longer storage, store at −20°C.\n3. Separate PCR products on a 2% agarose gel with nucleic acid gel stain in 1× TAE buffer in an electrophoresis apparatus containing 1× TAE buffer. Set electrophoresis run to 120 V for 1 hr. Include controls and a 1-kb or 50-bp DNA ladder.\nSupplement the gel with an appropriate volume of nucleic acid gel stain, e.g., add 5 µl Midori Green dye (Nippon Genetics, cat. no. MG04) per 100 ml gel.",
    "Expected band sizes are around 550 to 600 bp for ITS and 750 bp for beta-tubulin. Only PCR fragments from samples that give single, clear bands should be used for sequencing. If necessary, excise bands with the expected fragment size from the gel.\n4. Clean up PCR products or gel fragments prior to sequencing using a PCR cleanup kit following the manufacturer's recommendations or cleanup services at a commercial sequencing facility.\n5. Submit PCR products for Sanger sequencing using the same primers as used for the PCR reactions.\nUsually, one primer (sequencing in the forward or reverse direction) per locus is sufficient.\nFollow the specific concentration requirements of the sequencing facility.\n6. Use ITS and beta-tubulin sequences for alignments and similarity searches.\nHighly similar sequences can provide information about the species.\nPublic tools and databases like BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) and NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) or software like Geneious (https://www.geneious.com[href=https://www.geneious.com]) and Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com[href=https://www.blast2go.com]) can be used for sequence analysis.",
    "In order to facilitate the molecular identification of newly isolated fungal specimens (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0002]), here we describe an easy method for PCR-quality gDNA extraction that is inexpensive and much faster compared to traditional protocols. It is a modified version of the previously published “HotSHOT” DNA extraction protocol (Truett et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0054]). Besides being short, this protocol does not use potentially harmful organic compounds like chloroform and phenol and requires a low number of cells. These cells can easily be retrieved from the last step of single-colony isolation (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001], step 15). It is important to note that the gDNA extract is crude and only suitable for amplification of products <1 kb. This protocol is not appropriate to isolate gDNA for whole-genome sequencing or for more delicate PCR-based analyses (e.g., amplification of genetic markers like inter-simple sequence repeats). For such applications, isolation of high-quality DNA as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0004] is recommended.\nNOTE: Considering the chemicals used in this protocol, all the steps can be performed on the laboratory bench using regular latex gloves.\nMaterials\nBlastospores from axenic fungal cultures (e.g., from YMS agar plates with Z. tritici single colonies; see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001], step 15)\n25 mM sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\n40 mM Tris·HCl, pH 5.5\nSterile toothpicks\nPCR tubes or plates\n98°C thermocycler or heat block\n1. Pick a small number of cells (blastospores from axenic fungal cultures), approximately one-eighth of a single colony grown on YMS (see Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]), with a sterile toothpick and resuspend in 50 µl of 25 mM NaOH in a PCR tube or plate.\nSwirl the toothpick in the solution to release the cells.\n2. Incubate samples at 98°C for 10 min in a thermocycler or heat block.\n3. Add 50 µl of 40 mM Tris·HCl (pH 5.5) to each sample.",
    "This step ensures pH neutralization, which is important for DNA stability.\n4. Store samples at −20°C until further use.\nWe recommend routinely freezing the samples after the 98°C incubation and neutralization, as we have observed that it increases DNA yield.\n5. Thaw DNA extracts on ice prior to use in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0002].\nOnly the supernatant can be used as template gDNA for PCRs (e.g., amplification of ITS or beta-tubulin; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0002]). Pipet carefully and do not touch the cell debris on the bottom of the tube when transferring the supernatant. Alternatively, spin down cell debris using a microcentrifuge that can accommodate a PCR plate or tube. Dilute the supernatant 1:10 for use as template gDNA in PCR reactions (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0002], step 1).",
    "The following protocol describes a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based method to isolate high-quality, high-molecular-weight gDNA from Z. tritici blastospores (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0003]; Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0005], step 2). This DNA can be used as input for genome sequencing libraries for short-read (e.g., Illumina) and long-read (e.g., SMRT sequencing by PacBio) technologies as well as for a broad range of molecular biology techniques, including PCR-based genotyping and cloning. We observe that DNA extracted using this protocol results in better overall sequencing quality compared to sequencing of DNA, e.g., extracted using a phenol/chloroform-based protocol. This protocol is a modified version of the CTAB method described by Allen, Flores-Vergara, Krasynanski, Kumar, & Thompson (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4c78dbf4-05ef-4fca-b554-c66513230805/cpmc128-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nZ. tritici blastospore culture.

Set temperature of the water bath to 65°C.\n2. Prepare fresh DNA extraction buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-rec-0001]) and pre-warm to 65°C in water bath.\n3. Transfer densely grown liquid Z. tritici culture (∼20 ml) to a 50-ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge 10 min at 4000 rpm in a Thermo Scientific Heraeus Biofuge Stratos with a fixed-angle rotor and remove supernatant.\nIf required, the cell pellet can be snap-frozen and stored at −80°C until further use. However, in order to prevent DNA degradation and maintain DNA integrity, prolonged storage should be avoided.",
    "4. Grind cells in liquid nitrogen using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. Ensure that cells are ground to a fine powder and that no frozen clumps remain.\nBefore transferring the cells into the mortar, cool the mortar and pestle, e.g., by adding a few drops of liquid nitrogen into the mortar or by placing both into liquid nitrogen. Ensure that the cells are also frozen while grinding.\nThe protocol can be paused after this step, and cell powder can be stored at −80°C until further use.\n5. Transfer 100 to 200 mg cell powder (approximately until the 400-µl volume mark) into a pre-cooled, sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube using a pre-cooled small spatula. Use a different spatula for different samples. Close microcentrifuge tube and quickly place into a Styrofoam box containing liquid nitrogen.\nDip the spatula briefly into liquid nitrogen to cool it in order to avoid adhesion and thawing of cell powder.\nTo prevent DNA degradation, ground cells must not thaw before extraction buffer is added (see step 6). Hence, maintain samples in liquid nitrogen until proceeding with the next step.\n6. Add 1.2 ml pre-warmed DNA extraction buffer (see step 2) to each sample. Vortex briefly.\n7. Incubate sample at 65°C for 1 hr in the water bath (see step 1). Mix tube every 10 min by inversion.\n8. Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 16,200 × g at room temperature.\n9.

Place sample on a nutator shaker platform and gently shake for 20 min.\n11. Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 16,200 × g at room temperature.",
    "12. Transfer aqueous phase (top phase) to a new sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and repeat phenol/chloroform extraction (steps 9 to 11).\nIMPORTANT NOTE: To obtain high-quality DNA, it is very important to avoid transferring any organic phase (bottom phase) to the subsequent steps as it contains proteins and cell debris. Avoid touching the bottom phase while pipetting the supernatant.\n13. Transfer aqueous phase (top phase) to a new sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 800 µl cold isopropanol (−20°C). Mix several times by inversion (no shaking).\n14. Incubate sample for 15 min at −20°C followed by 10 min at room temperature for DNA precipitation.\n15. Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 16,200 × g at room temperature.\n16. Gently remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 250 µl of 1× TE buffer (pH 8).\nAt this stage, the pellet is not completely stable. To avoid losing it, do not dislodge the pellet when you remove the supernatant.\n17. Add 25 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A to each sample and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\n18. Add 25 µl of 3 M NaOAc and mix briefly by inversion. Add 600 µl of cold 100% ethanol (–20°C), mix, and incubate sample for ≥1 hr at −20°C to precipitate DNA.\nA prolonged precipitation step (e.g., overnight) is possible and preferred; it can help to increase the final DNA yield.\n19. Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 16,200 × g at room temperature.\n20. Gently remove supernatant and wash pellet two times with 500 µl of 75% ethanol.\nWash the DNA pellet entirely. If the pellet sticks to the tube wall, dislodge it carefully using a pipet tip to ensure that it is fully submerged.\n21. Centrifuge sample for 5 min at 16,200 × g at room temperature.",
    "22. Remove supernatant and air-dry pellet for ≥20 min at room temperature.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: It is extremely important to remove any residual ethanol as it may interfere with any downstream DNA applications. It is also possible to remove residual ethanol using a SpeedVac for 10 to 15 min. Do not extend this incubation time or use a heating option; over-dried DNA pellets are difficult to dissolve.\n23. Dissolve DNA pellet in 50 to 100 µl of 1× TE buffer (pH 8) by incubating the sample in the thermomixer at 37°C and 300 rpm for 45 min.\nLarge DNA pellets may take more time to fully dissolve, and therefore, the DNA concentration can change over time. Hence, always check the DNA quality and concentration immediately before proceeding with downstream applications that require accurate DNA concentrations (e.g., molecular cloning, preparation of sequencing libraries).\n24. Check DNA purity by gel electrophoresis using a 0.8% agarose gel with nucleic acid gel stain in 1× TAE buffer in an electrophoresis apparatus containing 1× TAE buffer. Run gel at 100 V for 45 min. Include a 1-kb DNA ladder.\nSupplement the gel with an appropriate volume of nucleic acid gel stain, e.g., add 5 µl Midori Green dye (Nippon Genetics, cat. no. MG04) per 100 ml gel.\nA single, high-molecular-weight band with little-to-no smear should be observed. In the case that smears or multiple bands are visible, in particular at the bottom of the gel, additional cleanup steps, e.g., with phenol/chloroform (1:1), are recommended, as smears or multiple bands indicate either DNA fragmentation or contamination with proteins. Alternatively, spin columns for DNA purification can be used. However, every additional cleanup step will reduce DNA yield.",

Quantify DNA concentration using a fluorometer and fluorometer DNA assay kit following the manufacturer's recommendations.\nFluorometer measurements are more accurate compared to visual or spectrophotometer methods.\n26. Keep DNA sample at 4°C for short-term storage or at −20°C for long-term storage prior to use in any analysis that requires high-quality DNA (e.g., cloning, preparation of genome sequencing libraries).\nAvoid repeated thawing-freezing cycles, as they may accelerate DNA degradation.",
    "Proper storage and maintenance of new Z. tritici isolates (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001]) are important to keep isolates viable and to ensure their genomic integrity. Cells of isolates that are stored under cryogenic conditions can be preserved for decades and therefore serve as valuable resources to answer different research questions throughout history (Hartmann, Sánchez-Vallet, McDonald, & Croll, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0024]; Oggenfuss et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0042]). The Dutch Z. tritici isolate IPO323 was originally isolated in 1981 and has been used as a reference in several studies worldwide since then (Kema & Van Silfhout, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0032]). For most experiments, including preparation of long-term stocks, blastospore cultures (“yeast-like” morphology) are used as input. For many isolates, these cells can be obtained from cultures grown in nutrient-rich medium (e.g., yeast malt sucrose, or YMS, medium) at 18°C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0003]).\nThis protocol describes cultivation and long-term cryopreservation of Z. tritici blastospores and can be initiated using a small number of cells from single-spore colonies immediately after isolation (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001]). Considering the importance of long-term storage stocks, we recommend preparing the cultures using aseptic techniques in a laminar flow hood. Additionally, we propose preparing two distinct sets of cryo-stocks: a safe “backup” stock that will only be used in cases of great necessity and an “in use” stock, which will be used routinely to cultivate cells for experiments. Digital records of the stored isolates can be combined with different types of metadata (e.g., location and date of isolation, original wheat cultivar).\nMaterials\nYMS agar plate with Z. tritici single colony (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0001], step 15)\nLiquid YMS medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-rec-0003])\nSterile silica (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 60741; sterilized at 180°C for 6 hr)\nLiquid YMS-glycerol medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-rec-0002])\nLiquid nitrogen\nSterile toothpicks\nSterile culture tubes or sterile Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles",

Pick a small number of cells (from a YMS agar plate with Z. tritici single colony), e.g., approximately one-fourth of a single colony grown on YMS (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0002]), using a sterile toothpick and inoculate ≥5 ml liquid YMS medium in a sterile culture tube or a sterile Erlenmeyer flask with baffles. Label tube with the isolate ID.\nThe volume of medium is dependent on the culture tube or flask used. A maximum of one-third of the culture tube or flask volume should be filled with YMS. To allow CO2 circulation, do not close the culture vessel to be airtight; secure the cap using tape (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0003]).\n2. Incubate cultures using an orbital shaker with an adapter for culture tubes or flasks at 18°C and 200 rpm for 5 days or until the cultures are densely grown (OD600nm = 2.8 to 3.2 via a spectrophotometer) (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0003]).\nDue to the phenotypic diversity of Z. tritici, some isolates may take more or less time to reach this culture density.\n3. Prepare two or more sterile 2-ml cryovials for each isolate, with vials for both “backup” and “in use” stocks, as follows:\n         \nSilica stocks: Scoop sterile silica into cryovials using a small spatula until the vials are filled to the 300-µl mark.\nGlycerol stocks: Add 900 µl liquid YMS-glycerol medium to the cryovials.\nGlycerol stocks are easier to handle and are recommended for “in use” stocks.\n4. Add 50 and 900 µl of densely grown culture from step 2 to the cryovials containing silica and YMS-glycerol, respectively. Close cryovial caps tightly.",
    "Label the cryovials with the isolate ID and other relevant information (e.g., date of preparation). It is important to use freezer-ready labels or pens, as lettering may fade over time or labels may come off; regular paper labels easily detach if not covered with clear tape.\n5. Mix liquid culture and YMS-glycerol for the glycerol stocks thoroughly by inversion. Likewise, mix culture and silica for the silica stocks for ≥5 min on a shaker with an adapter for cryovials.\nThe shaker does not need to be at high speed (500 rpm is sufficient). This step is required to dry the blastospores. Check if there are still clumps of “wet” silica after 5 min by holding the tubes horizontally. If this is the case, add more silica to the cryovials and leave them in the shaker until the silica-culture mix is dry and homogeneous.\n6. Snap-freeze stock cultures using liquid nitrogen and store tubes at −80°C.\n7. Keep cryo-stocks on ice or in a cooled rack during use.\nIt is good practice to not let samples thaw too long on ice (e.g., for ≥10 min). Ideally, the YMS-glycerol culture should still be soft, not entirely thawed. Use and return the stocks to the −80°C freezer as quickly as possible.\n8. Remake “in use” stocks before these stocks run too low to avoid samples loss, preferentially retrieving material for culture inoculation from the safe “back up” stocks.",
    "Ranging from virulence quantification to mutant phenotyping, in planta infection assays are an important component of many Z. tritici studies. The infection outcome, namely wheat susceptibility or qualitative or quantitative resistance, can provide information about the presence or absence of avirulence factors in Z. tritici isolates as well as about the relevance of candidate gene products during host infection (Brown, Chartrain, Lasserre-Zuber, & Saintenac, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0009]). For example, the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring harbors the resistance gene Stb6, which confers resistance against isolates carrying the avirulence factor AvrStb6, like the Z. tritici reference isolate IPO323 (Kema et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0031]; Saintenac et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0047]; Zhong et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0060]). Hence, Chinese Spring can be used to study the molecular and physiological mechanisms of wheat resistance against Z. tritici AvrStb6 genotypes. Infection of other highly susceptible wheat cultivars can be used to compare the virulence of different Z. tritici genotypes. The cultivars Obelisk, Riband, and Drifter are highly susceptible to IPO323 and to a large number of other isolates and are therefore commonly used in pathogenicity assays to quantify and compare virulence (Chartrain, Brading, & Brown, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0010]; Habig et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0022]; Haueisen et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0025]; Karisto, Dora, & Mikaberidze, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0027]; Stewart & McDonald, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0051]; Zhong et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0060]).",
    "Previous studies revealed that quantitative virulence of Z. tritici can be highly variable within and between experiments, generally indicated by a broad data distribution for quantitative measures like pycnidia density (Habig et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0022]; Stewart & McDonald, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0051]). Thus, technical and experimental replicates are extremely important to be able to discern treatment effects from background variation. We recommend using a minimum of two biological replicates (e.g., two independent deletion mutants) and two technical replicates (e.g., two independent experiments) to obtain at least 30 leaves per treatment and replicate (Z. tritici isolates or mock). Randomization within experiments (randomization of pot placement and randomization of treatment order) is required to minimize confounding effects of environmental factors and experimental procedures. Furthermore, cross-contaminations or other abiotic and biotic biological aspects (e.g., senescence) that may influence the final results must be monitored by the inclusion of a negative control (mock treatment). In addition, observer's bias can be avoided by making the experimenter unaware of the treatment type throughout the whole experiment.\nThe following protocol describes a method to quantitatively evaluate Z. tritici virulence in wheat hosts under controlled greenhouse or growth chamber conditions. This protocol can be used whenever phenotyping in planta is required. The complete workflow is summarized in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af6fdfdc-d2e5-4dda-b3eb-d62b48c6a7f8/cpmc128-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Initiate germination of wheat seeds: Place Whatman paper at bottom of a plastic box and add sterile water to moisten it (∼12.5 ml is appropriate for an 11 × 7–cm box). Place wheat seeds inside box and close it. Germinate seeds for 4 days under plant growth conditions (20°C and a 16-hr light period) in a growth chamber (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]).\nEnsure that the Whatman paper is covering the bottom of the box and that the seeds are well dispersed and are touching the filter paper. Include seeds for at least 30 plants per treatment (Z. tritici isolate replicates and mock).\nThis step ensures that enough wheat seedlings will be viable and at a similar developmental stage when they are planted and inoculated. It is recommended to germinate a number of additional seeds. In our experience, ∼4.5 g of Obelisk seeds is sufficient to produce ∼100 seedlings.\n2. Fill pots with peat potting soil and organize them on trays. Add a plastic tag with information about wheat cultivar, treatment (e.g., anonymized isolate and replicate ID), and date to each pot.\nTwenty-four 9 × 9–cm pots can be placed onto one 60 × 40–cm tray.\n3. To plant wheat seedlings, first wet soil in the pots. Make four holes in soil (∼1 cm in depth), e.g., by using a small dibble or a finger. Transplant 4-day old seedlings (see step 1) into holes and cover roots with soil.\n4. Grow seedlings for 7 days in soil prior to inoculation. Water plants regularly by pouring water in the trays instead of overhead watering.",
    "Seedlings of different wheat cultivars require different times to develop. Plants can be inoculated as soon as the second leaf is expanded, or at stage 1 on the Feekes scale (Large, 1954[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0033]).\n5. One day before inoculation, mark a distinct section (e.g., 5 to 10 cm) on adaxial side of the second leaf of each plant using a permanent black pen with a soft tip (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]).\nThis leaf section will be used as a reference to compare Z. tritici virulence between plants and treatments. To simplify this step, mark the length of the area to be inoculated on your glove, preferably on the pointer (index) finger, and bend the leaves over this finger (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]).\n6. On the inoculation day, organize pots for each treatment and ensure that all pots are properly labeled.\n7. To clean the spray gun, spray 70% ethanol 20 to 30 times for 2 to 3 s each followed by spraying sterile water 20 to 30 times for 2 to 3 s each using 2.0 bar of pressure.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This cleaning procedure is required between all treatments. It is extremely important to prevent cross-contamination and must not be omitted.\n8. To inoculate the plants for each treatment, use cleaned spray gun and a pressure of 2.0 bar to inoculate the marked leaf sections of each plant with the Z. tritici inoculum by evenly spraying until runoff (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]). Clean spray gun after each treatment as described in step 7. Follow same procedure for the mock treatment by spraying 0.1% Tween® 20 in sterile water onto the marked leaf sections.",
    "Alternatively, sterile paint brushes can be used to apply Z. tritici inoculum (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]). At least one paint brush should be used per treatment. Brush inoculum gently onto the marked leaf area, without applying pressure, until the leaf surface is completely covered. Follow the same procedure for the mock treatment.\n9. Let inoculum dry on leaf surface (∼15 min) and place pots (sorted by treatment) in large plastic bags containing water (∼1 L). Seal bags using tape or plastic locking clips to generate an environment with maximal relative humidity (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]). Incubate plants in the bags at ∼20°C (day)/∼12°C (night) and a 16-hr day/8-hr night cycle under controlled greenhouse conditions. Alternatively, in growth chambers, use constant conditions of 20°C and 16 hr of light (∼200 µmol/m2/s).\nHigh humidity induces opening of stomata and facilitates even Z. tritici infections.\n10. After 48 hr, remove pots from the bags and place plants back onto the trays (Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0004]). Ensure randomized placement. Water regularly and maintain a relative humidity of 70% to 90%. Grow wheat for 21 days post-inoculation (dpi) at the same temperature and light conditions as described in step 9.\nFor cultivar Obelisk and the reference IPO323, 21 dpi is adequate to detect STB lesions and mature pycnidia. However, for other wheat cultivar–Z. tritici isolate combinations, this period can be shorter or longer.",
    "Another important phenotypic trait is temporal development of disease. Timing of the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth varies between Z. tritici isolates and might be impacted by the presence/absence of putative effector candidates. We suggest screening inoculated leaves of individual plants for the onset of necrosis and first visible pycnidia daily or every other day. Keep a record of the disease development (like the average day of the first observed symptom) for each isolate and mutant, e.g., for future experiments and as an additional virulence measurement.\n11. At 21 dpi, harvest inoculated leaf sections by cutting ∼1 cm above and below the pen marks using scissors and mount leaves to white paper sheets using white regular tape.\nCover the black pen marks on the leaves with the white tape. Black marks will interfere with the leaf image analysis. Attach the leaves to the paper sheets with a distance of ≥5 cm from each other.\n12. Scan paper sheets using a flatbed scanner, scanning each leaf individually. Use an image resolution of 2400 dots per inch.\nKeep each scanned leaf in a separate image file, naming each file with the treatment followed by a consecutive number (e.g., Mock_1, Mock_2, …; IPO323_1, IPO323_2, …). Alternatively, QR codes can be used to automatically name image files; a related workflow was developed by Karisto et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0028]).\n13. Analyze scanned images using ImageJ software (Schneider, Rasband, & Eliceiri, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0048]) and the published macros for Z. tritici virulence quantification (Karisto et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0028]; Stewart & McDonald, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0051]; Stewart et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0050]).\nThe macros automatically output a spreadsheet summarizing the total leaf area, lesion area, percent of leaf area covered by lesions (PLACL), total pycnidia count, and pycnidia per cm2 of lesion leaf area, among other parameters, for each analyzed leaf.",
    "Macro adjustments may be necessary depending on the hardware used and the leaf conditions (e.g., color intensity). Customize and test the macro settings to obtain more accurate results.\n14. Compare virulence readouts (e.g., PLACL, normalized pycnidia count) within and between treatments using statistical tests in the R environment (R Core Team, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0046]) or Open Office Calc (https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html[href=https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html]).\nStatistical methods should be performed to validate that the observed differences are significant, i.e., could only occur at a low probability assuming that the null hypothesis is true (which, in most cases, states that there is no difference between treatments). Different statistical tests have different assumptions that should be met for a correct statistical analysis. Among other premises, parametric tests (e.g., Student's t-test, analysis of variance/ANOVA) rely on the assumption that the data follow a normal distribution, with similar variances between treatments (Altman & Bland, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0003]). If these assumptions are not met by the data, a statistical test will produce incorrect results. Hence, it is essential to verify that these assumptions are met. A visual inspection using a normal Q-Q plot and a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality (Shapiro & Wilk, 1965[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0049]) (check the function “shapiro.test” of the “stats” R package) can be used to test the normal distribution of the data. Be aware that a significant result in the Shapiro-Wilk test indicates that the data are not distributed normally. Moreover, Levene's test for homogeneity of variances (also called homoscedasticity) (Levene, 1961[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0035]) is recommended, in particular for the analysis of variance between treatments that have small or different sample sizes. The function “leveneTest” of the R package “car” can be used to perform this test.",
    "Although it is not always the case, Z. tritici in planta phenotyping data generally fail one or more assumptions for parametric tests. Therefore, nonparametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test (or Wilcoxon rank sum test) and Kruskal-Wallis test can be used as good alternatives for the t-test and ANOVA, respectively. These tests do not assume a certain distribution of the data and have been largely used in studies analyzing Z. tritici virulence data (Haueisen et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0025]; Karisto et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0028]; Möller et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0038]; Poppe, Dorsheimer, Happel, & Stukenbrock, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0044]; Stewart et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0050]). Check the functions “wilcox.text” and “kruskal.test” of the R package “stats” to perform such analyses.\nConsidering that high variation between experiments (i.e., technical replicates) could obscure real differences between treatments, a method where the variation between experiments can be removed and the true differences between treatments can be obtained is desirable. In general, multifactorial statistical analyses are extremely powerful in detecting effects and interactions. For nonparametric tests, the inclusion of multiple factors is difficult. ANOVA, however, can include and account for multiple factors. A promising way to apply ANOVA to non-normal data is the rank transformation, which has been suggested as a link between parametric and nonparametric statistical tests (Conover & Iman, 1981[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0011]). Once rank-transformed, the data often follow a normal distribution, which allows the use of ANOVA (Habig et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0022]; Habig, Bahena-Garrido, Barkmann, Haueisen, & Stukenbrock, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0021]). Inclusion of a model (e.g., pycnidia density ∼ treatment* experiment) can allow dissection of the effect of treatment without confounding influence of the experiments (technical replicates). Applying the post hoc test Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) to the results of the ANOVA then allows for testing of individual treatment effects (Tukey, 1949[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-bib-0055]).",
    "In addition to their use in long-term cryo-stocks (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0005]), Z. tritici blastospore cultures (“yeast-like” form) are routinely required to prepare inoculum for virulence assays (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0006]). The following protocol describes a method to initiate blastospore culture, collect the cells, and adjust their density for plant infections. This protocol should be started 5 days prior to plant inoculation (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0006]).\nMaterials\nZ. tritici glycerol stock of Z. tritici isolate to be inoculated (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-prot-0005])\nYMS agar plate without kanamycin (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-rec-0006])\nSterile water\n70% (v/v) ethanol\n0.1% Tween® 20 (e.g., Roth, cat. no. 9127.1) in sterile water\nSterile pipet tips and/or inoculation loops\nMicrobiological incubator with temperature control, 18°C\nSterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nVortex (e.g., Vortex-Genie 2, Scientific Industries, cat. no. SI-0236)\nHemocytometer and coverslip (e.g., Neubauer improved chamber, 0.100 mm, Marienfeld Superior, cat. no. 0640010)\nManual counter (i.e., tally counter)\nCompound microscope\nSterile 50-ml Falcon tube\n1. Retrieve Z. tritici glycerol stock of Z. tritici isolates to be inoculated from the −80°C freezer.\n2. Dip a sterile pipet tip in soft (not entirely thawed) Z. tritici glycerol culture and transfer cells to a YMS agar plate without kanamycin. Using the pipet tip or a sterile inoculation loop, spread glycerol culture onto a small surface area (∼4 mm2).\nTo avoid contamination of the YMS plate and the cryo-stocks, perform this step using aseptic techniques under a laminar flow hood.\nBlastospores from one YMS plate are usually sufficient to inoculate up to 96 wheat plants. Inoculate extra YMS plates if additional inoculum is required.\n3. Incubate plate for 5 days at 18°C and constant darkness.",
    "After this period, a pinkish colony patch of blastospores should form. Some Z. tritici isolates may show different colony phenotypes. The color can range from pale pink to orange to black (melanized) and the texture from very smooth to hard and flaky, as displayed in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.128#cpmc128-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7acc7f57-9c04-4ce8-a394-58e0d5e19038/cpmc128-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nZ. tritici colony phenotypes are variable. Phenotypic plasticity is observed for two Z. tritici isolates grown under two different temperature conditions: isolates were grown at 18°C (A and B) and 25°C (C and D) for 5 days on YMS plates in constant darkness. For each isolate, the same inoculum source was used. The scale bars represent 1000 µm.\n4. Scrape cells from the colony surface using a sterile pipet tip and resuspend them in a sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml sterile water. Swirl pipet tip to release the cells and ensure that the suspension is homogeneous (no cell clumps).\nColonies of Z. tritici isolates may be formed by blastospores and hyphae. In the case of strong filamentous growth, filter the cell suspension through sterile miracloth to retain hyphal clumps.\n5. Make at least two serial dilutions (1:10 and 1:100) of blastospore suspension in additional sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Vortex tubes briefly between dilutions.\nTwo serial dilutions are generally enough to facilitate cell counting. Additional dilutions may be necessary if a larger number of cells has been resuspended.\n6. Carefully clean hemocytometer and coverslip with 70% ethanol before use and position coverslip correctly (indicated by the appearance of Newton's rings). Select appropriate dilution, briefly vortex blastospore suspension, and pipet 10 µl into each compartment of hemocytometer.\nCheck the specifications of the counting chamber to select the appropriate cell dilution. Verify if the cell suspension is well homogenized and avoid injecting bubbles into the counting chamber.",
    "7. Observe cells using a compound microscope (e.g., with a 10× objective lens).\n8. Count number of cells using a manual counter. Record cell number.\n9. Calculate cell density considering the average number of counted cells, the specifications of the hemocytometer in use, and the dilution of the cell suspension that was counted.\nVerify the specific volume of the used counting chamber to calculate a correct estimate of the cell density.\n10. Adjust inoculum to the required cell density (e.g., 106 or 107 cells/ml) in 0.1% Tween® 20 in sterile water. Keep final inoculum in a sterile 50-ml Falcon tube and use within a few hours.\nA total volume of 15 ml is sufficient to inoculate ∼96 wheat leaves. However, prepare as much as possible to avoid exhausting the inoculum during inoculation."
