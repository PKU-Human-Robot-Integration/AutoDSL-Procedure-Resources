    "Primary NK cell isolation Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolationNote: At room temperature (RT) unless stated otherwise. Dilute at least 15 ml blood 2x in dilution medium and mix.Note: From 15 ml blood typically ~1.5 x106 NK cells can be isolated. This number will yield ~7.5 x 104 CD56bright NK cells. Add 4 ml Ficoll to a 15 ml tube.Carefully layer the diluted blood sample (10 ml) onto the Ficoll (do not mix).Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the remaining diluted blood.Centrifuge 15 min at 1,000 x g without brake.Harvest the PBMC by carefully pipetting (using a Pasteur pipette) the white layer of cells between plasma and ficoll.Transfer the PBMC to a new 50 ml tube (pool per sample max 25 ml).Add wash medium up to 50 ml.Centrifuge 10 min at 800 x g.Remove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the cells.If applicable, pool the cells in 150 ml tube.Add wash medium up to 10 ml.Centrifuge 10 min at 540 x g.Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in the recommended volume of MACS buffer (~1 ml MACS buffer for every 10 ml of undiluted blood).Count the cells with Türk′s solution (dilute 10 µl cell suspension with 90 µl Türk′s solution). Keep the remaining cells at 4 °C.Keep 2 x 106 PBMC aside for single stain controls in sorting procedure.NK cell isolation from PBMC using MACSNote: Keep cells and buffers at 4 °C during the NK cell isolation. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for any updates in the protocol. Transfer cells to 15 ml tube and add up to 14 ml MACS buffer.Centrifuge 5 min 540 x g.Note: Volumes for magnetic labeling are minimum volumes, when working with less than 1 x 107 cells, use this volume, when working with more than 1 x 107 cells, scale up the volumes accordingly.",
    "Remove supernatant by aspiration. Resuspend cells in 40 µl of MACS buffer per 1 x 107 cells.Example: For 1.5 x 107 cells, add 60 µl of MACS buffer Add 10 µl of NK cell Biotin-Antibody Cocktail per 1 x 107 cells.Mix well and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.Add 30 µl of MACS buffer per 1 x 107 cells.Add 20 µl of NK cell MicroBead Cocktail per 1 x 107 cells.Mix well and incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.Place the column (MS for ≤ 1 x 107 cells, LS for > 1 x 107 PBMC) in the magnetic field of the MACS separator, which is placed on the MACS MultiStand. A maximum of 1 x 108 PBMC can be loaded per LS column.Put the pre-separation filter on top of the column.Position the column into a 15 ml tube.Rinse the column by pipetting MACS buffer in the filter: 500 µl (MS column), 3 ml (LS column)Replace the 15 ml tube filled with buffer with a new 15 ml tube (the flow-through with NK cells will be collected in this tube).Important: Only pipet new volumes when the column reservoir is empty. Pipette the labeled PBMC in the filter. A minimum volume of 500 µl is required for magnetic separation. If necessary, add MACS buffer to the cell suspension.Wash column by pipetting MACS buffer in the filter: 500 µl (MS column), 3 ml (LS column)Repeat Step 15 twice.Centrifuge the 15 ml tube containing the unlabeled NK cells and centrifuge 5 min at 540 x g.Resuspend in MACS buffer (~500-1,000 µl) and count.FACS of NK cell subsetsNote: Keep cells and buffers at 4 °C. Prepare antibody mixes (30 µl per 1 x 106 NK cells). Prevent bleaching by keeping the antibody mixes in the dark! See Recipes for example calculation.",
    "Important: use titrated antibodies.Note: Titration is performed on 106 PBMC using the recommended dilution as the median of 5 concentrations. A 2-fold dilution factor is typically applied. Recommended dilutions should be saturating but at the same not alter the mean fluorescence intensity of the antigen negative cells. Prepare single stain control mixes (1 antibody + MACS buffer), 25 µl per single stain. Use same dilution as used for complete antibody mix. Do not forget to include 1 unstained control.Transfer 2 x 105 PBMC into a well of a 96 wells plate (1 well/single stain).Pellet cells by centrifugation for 5 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for tube), or 2 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for plate).For tube: remove supernatant from the 15 ml tube by aspiration and resuspend in the correct amount of antibody mix. Incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C.For plate: remove supernatant from the wells by flicking the plate once above the sink. Remove any access liquid by gently tapping the plate once onto a paper towel. Add 25 µl of single stain mix. Incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C.Wash cells by adding 10 ml (for tube) and 200 µl (for plate) MACS buffer to the cells.Pellet cells by centrifugation as before: 5 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for tube), 2 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for plate).Remove supernatant as described before (Step 5).For tube: resuspend NK cells in MACS buffer, to a concentration of 1 x 107 NK cells per ml.For plate: resuspend the PBMC in 70 µl MACS buffer, and collect them in micronic tubes.Prepare round bottom polystyrene tubes with 3 ml collection medium (max. 6 x 105 cells can be collected in 1 tube).",
    "Sort the cells at low pressure (100 µm nozzle, 20 PSI, this is important for the functioning of the NK cells after the sorting). Use the gating strategy as depicted in Figure 1. If more subsets are desired, the CD56bright can be further subdivided in a CD16- and CD16+ subset. Sorting of 1.5 x 106 NK cells will yield (when taking into account cell loss) ~7.5 x 104 CD56bright NK cells and 1 x 106 CD56dim NK cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3845/bioprotoc-10-23-3845-g001.jpgFigure 1. Gating strategy for sorting of primary NK cell subsets. First, lymphocytes are gated based on forward- and side scatter. Next, doublets, CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD33+CD56- myeloid cells are excluded. NK cells can be further subdivided based on intensity expression of CD56 and CD16: CD56brightCD16+/- and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells.iPSC-derived NK cell isolation by FACSNote: Keep cells and buffers at 4 °C during the NK cell isolation. Collect the floating cells in the iPSC differentiation culture (Figure 2A) into a 15 ml or 50 ml conically shaped tube. The tube size depends on the scale of differentiation (typical format: a few wells from a 6-well plate).Note: ~1 x 106 floating cells are typically harvested from one 6 well plate. Depending on the success of differentiation 20-70% of the floating cells are CD7+CD56+ NK cells. Pass the cell suspension through a 30 µm CellTrics filter (Sysmex) and collect the cells in a 15 ml or 50 ml conically shaped tube.Centrifuge the collected cell suspension at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the pelleted cells in 500 µl ice-cold PBS (wash Step 1).Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Remove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the pelleted cells in 500 µl ice-cold MACS buffer (wash Step 2).Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the pelleted cells in 500 µl ice-cold MACS buffer (wash Step 3).Take a small aliquot (10 µl) and count the cells.Transfer the cells into a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube or 96 wells pate (round-bottom or V-shaped bottom well). Required number of tubes/wells: unstained control, single stain controls, complete stain. Use 2 x 104-5 x 104 cells for the single stain or unstained controls. The rest is used for the combi-stain of the cells that will be sorted. Never go beyond 1 x 106 cells/ 25 µl staining solution.Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (for tube) or 2 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for plate).Prepare antibody mixes: single stain control mixes (1 antibody + MACS buffer), 25 µl per single stain, and a complete antibody mix containing at least anti-CD7 and anti-CD56 to identify NK cell-like cells.Note: Use identical dilutions for the same antibodies and shield the antibodies from light, particularly, when tandem dyes are used as conjugates. Do not forget to include an unstained control and preferentially also a positive control consisting of mononuclear blood cells, by example from peripheral blood. Remove the supernatant by aspiration ( fortube) or by flicking the plate once above the sink (for plate). Remove any access liquid by gently tapping the plate once onto a paper towel (for plate).Resuspend the cells in the antibody mix.Incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C (typically in the fridge).",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (for tube) or 2 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for plate).Remove the supernatant as described before (Step 13) and resuspend the cells in 200 µl ice-cold MACS buffer.Centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (for tube) or 2 min, 540 x g at 4 °C (for plate).Remove the supernatant as described before (Step 13) and resuspend the single stain, unstained cells, and positive control cells in 70 µl MACS buffer and transfer them into Micronic or 5 ml round-bottom polystyrene tubes. The cells to be sorted are resuspended at a concentration of 10 x 106 cells per ml.Prepare 5 ml round-bottom polystyrene tubes with 3 ml collection medium (max 6 x105 cells can be collected in 1 tube).Sort the CD7+CD56+ cells at low pressure (100 µm nozzle, 20 PSI). Use the gating strategy as depicted in Figure 2B.Note: Dependent on the question to be addressed and required purity antibodies against additional NK cell markers such as CD16 may be used. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3845/bioprotoc-10-23-3845-g002.jpgFigure 2. Isolation of iPSC-derived NK cells by FACS. A. An example of the differentiation of iPSC towards NK cells after co-culturing with OP9-DL1 cells for 3 weeks (100x magnification). Non-adherent cells are harvested and CD56+ NK cells are isolated using FACS. B. Gating strategy to isolate iPSC-derived CD7+CD56+ NK cells.NK cell stimulation Spin down the sorted NK cell subsets and resuspend at a concentration of 5.6 x 104 cells/ml in AIMV medium with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (the final FCS concentration will be ~5%).Add 180 µl /well NK cells in a sterile 96-wells round-bottom plate.Add 20 µl of IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 mix and medium without cytokines (AIMV + 1% Penicillin-Streptomcyin) to the different wells.",
    "Note: Cells from healthy donors that are cultured in IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 are the positive control for IFN-γ production. Cells cultured in medium without cytokines act as negative control. Preferentially, stimulations should be performed in triplicate. If more cells were sorted than needed stimulations with single or double cytokine mixtures should be included. Include 1 well with 200 µl medium (AIMV + 1% Penicillin-Streptomcyin + 5% FCS) and 1 well with 200 µl medium supplemented with interleukins (as background for the Luminex).Wrap plastic foil around plate to prevent evaporation.Culture cells for 20 h in incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.  Note: When studying kinetics, take a sample of 10 µl at multiple time points. Spin down plate, 540 x g for 2 min.Harvest supernatant and store in sealed 96 wells plate or Micronic tubes at -20 °C.LuminexNote: The protocol below has been optimized and therefore differs from the manufacture’s instruction. Spin down the standard vial and reconstitute a single vial of standard in 500 µl of diluent (= AIMV medium + 5% FCS), gently vortex for 5 s and incubate on ice for 30 min.Label 9 0.5 ml polypropylene tubes Std1-Std8 and Blank.Add the specified volume of diluent to each tube (Table 1).Vortex the reconstituted standard gently for 5 sec, take 128 µl and add to tube Std1.Vortex Std1 and transfer 50 µl from tube Std1 to tube Std2 and vortex. Important: use new pipet tips for every volume transfer.Continue with serial dilutions form tube S2 to S8 by transferring 50 µl each time.Table 1. Serial dilutions to generate a standard curve imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201201/20201201230713_0753.jpgThaw supernatant, and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 4 min at RT.Transfer supernatant to clean polypropylene tube.Dilute samples 1:6 in diluent (once thawed keep samples on ice) and equilibrate to RT before use.",
    "Make a plate lay-out (for example Figure 3) to check the number of wells required. Use duplicates for the standards and blanks. Fill the plate vertically.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3845/bioprotoc-10-23-3845-g003.jpgFigure 3. Plate lay-out. An example of a plate lay-out with 8 standards and 1 blank in duplicate, and 6 samples.Add the required volume of assay buffer to a 15 ml tube (Table 2).Vortex the stock beads for 30 s at medium speed. Carefully open the cap and pipet any liquid trapped in the cap back into the vial. Important: do not centrifuge the stock beads, since the beads will be spun down.Dilute the beads by pipetting the required volume of stock beads into the 15 ml tube (Table 2). Important: protect the beads from light with aluminium foil.Table 2. Bead dilutions imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201201/20201201230902_4660.jpgBring standards and samples to RT before use.Vortex the diluted beads at medium speed for 30 s and pour the beads into a reagent reservoir. Transfer 50 µg of beads to each well of the flat bottom plate.Add 100 µl wash buffer per well. Position the plate for at least 60 s on the handheld magnet and quickly decant the waste solution. Remove any access liquid by tapping the plate onto a paper towel. Remove plate from the magnet, carefully resuspend the beads by tapping the plate, and repeat this washing step.Gently vortex the diluted standards, blanks and samples for 5 s. Transfer 50 µl to each well. Important: use a new pipette tip for each volume transfer.Cover the plate with a new sheet of sealing tape and protect from light with aluminum foil. Incubate on shaker at 450 rpm for 45 min at RT.Prepare the dilution of detection antibodies 10 min before use. Add the required volume of detection antibody diluent to a new 15 ml tube (Table 3).",
    "Vortex the stock detection antibodies at medium speed for 15-20 s. Spin down the stock for 30 s.Dilute the 10x detection antibodies by pipetting the required volume into the 15 ml tube (Table 3).After the 45 min incubation, remove the sealing tape and wash 3x with 100 µl washing buffer.Vortex the diluted detection antibodies for 5 s, pour into a reagent reservoir and transfer 12.5 µl to each well.Cover plate with a new sealing tape and protect from light with aluminum foil. Incubate on shaker at 450 rpm for 30 min at RT.Table 3.

Vortex and protect from light.Power-up the Bio-plex system (30 min in advance).After the 30 min incubation of the detection antibody, remove the sealing tape and wash the plate 3x with 100 µl washing buffer.Vortex the diluted SA-PE for 5 s, pour into a reagent reservoir, and transfer 25 µl to each well.Cover the plate with sealing tape and aluminum foil. Incubate on shaker at 450 rpm for 10 min at RT.Wash the plate 3x with 100 µl wash buffer.To resuspend beads for plate reading, add 80 µl of assay buffer to each well and cover the plate with sealing tape. Incubate on shaker at 850 ± 50 rpm for 30 s at RT.Remove the tape and read the plate (using low PMT settings). In case you expect low concentrations, use high PMT settings.",
    "Data analysis: For a detailed handbook we refer to online tutorials by Bio-Rad (Reference 1 for instance).Note: It is important to subtract the background values (the wells with only medium or medium supplemented with interleukins) from the other values, which are automatically generated by the software based on the standard curve. In addition, check whether the experiment was successful by verifying that the negative control (cells without stimulation) is truly negative, and that the positive control (cells stimulated with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18) shows IFN-γ production. An example of cytokine production by a variety of NK cells is shown in Figure 4. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3845/bioprotoc-10-23-3845-g004.jpgFigure 4. Example of Luminex measurements of stimulated primary and iPSC-derived NK cells. The Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Immunoassay allows detection of 27 cytokines/chemokines. NK cells are producers of predominantly GM-CSF, TNF-α and IFN-γ and various chemokines. GM-CSF, TNF-α and IFN-γ production is shown upon the culture of primary NK cell subsets (CD56bright and CD56dim) and iPSC-derived NK cells (CD7+CD56+) in the presence of IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 for 20 h. The data is a representative of at least 2 independent experiments. The means and standard deviations are shown."
