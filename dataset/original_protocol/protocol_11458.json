  "procedures": [
    "The protocol consists of the isolation of DNA from serum or plasma samples to perform real-time PCR for copy number analysis. DNA extraction, DNA quantity control (spectrophotometer) and real-time PCR for specific targets were performed. In Figure 1, a summary of the procedures and time line are reported.\nThe protocol follows the guidelines of IRST Human Research Ethics Committee.\n1. Serum Collection and Processing\nCollect approximately 5 mL whole blood in a serum tube without anticoagulant to obtain serum. Maintain blood tubes at 4 °C until processing.\nCentrifuge tubes at 1,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nCarefully transfer serum into 2 mL tubes.\nDiscard the collecting tube and immediately freeze the supernatant at -80 °C until use.\n2. Plasma Collection and Processing\nCollect approximately 10 mL whole blood in a plasma tube with EDTA to obtain plasma. Fill the tube completely and then invert it 8 times. Maintain blood tubes at 4 °C until processing.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,800 x g for 15 min at room temperature with no brake setting on the centrifuge.\nCarefully transfer the upper part of the plasma into 2 mL tubes. Repeat the transfer, leaving at least 1 mL of the supernatant above the white cell layer.\n\tNOTE: Transferring the upper part of the supernatant reduces the risk of contamination by cells or cell debris.\nDiscard the collecting tube and immediately freeze the supernatant at -80 °C until use.\n3. DNA Isolation from Serum or Plasma\nNOTE: Isolation of DNA from serum or plasma should be performed using the commercial protocol modified in the following steps.\nThaw one aliquot (containing from 0.5 to 2 mL) of serum or plasma at room temperature.",
    "Vortex and mix the sample and transfer 0.5 mL of serum or plasma into a clear 1.5 mL tube. Freeze the rest of material at -80 °C.\nAdd 50 µL of proteinase k (20 mg/mL) directly to the sample.\nAdd 0.5 mL of lysis buffer to the sample and mix well by pipetting.\nClose the tubes and incubate samples at 56 °C for 15 min in the heat block.\nAdd the indicated amount of 100% ethanol at wash buffer 1 and 2, as indicated by the manufacturer's instructions.\nBring the samples back to room temperature and add 0.5 mL of absolute ethanol and mix well by pipetting.\nAdd 650 µL of the mixture obtained in step 3.7 to the separation column and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow through and place the column on a new clean collection tube. Repeat steps 3.8 and 3.9 one more time.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer 1, without wetting the rim of the column and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow through and replace it with a new clean collection tube.\nAdd 500 µL of wash buffer 2, without wetting the rim of the column and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.\nDiscard the tube containing the flow through and replace it with a new clean collection tube.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min to remove any residual washing buffer.\nPlace the column into a clean 1.5 mL tube. Add 150 µL of elution buffer and wait 7 min to ensure that buffer wets the column.\nCentrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min.",
    "Pipette the elute from step 3.16 again into the same column and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min to ensure maximum recovery of DNA.\n4. DNA Quantification and Dilution\nPerform quantification of DNA using a spectrophotometer. Use 2 µL of sample on a bench-top spectrophotometer per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: If the DNA quantity is not sufficient to proceed with real-time PCR (at least 120 ng), perform a new DNA isolation process.\nDilute DNA from serum or plasma to 2.5 ng/µL in a final volume sufficient for all real-time PCR (about 50 µL).\n5. Real-time PCR\nThaw copy number assays, reference gene assay, DNA diluted samples, and calibrators pooled in ice. Equilibrate at room temperature the master mix that is stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare a mix of 1 µL of target assay, 1 µL of reference gene assay, and 10 µL of master mix for 3 replicates of each sample and calibrators pooled. Prepare the mix including a negative control (water) and 2 extra samples.\nIn a 96 well plate, aliquot 12 µL of the mix into each well. Do not pipette or spin tubes.\nAdd 8 µL (concentration of 2.5 ng/µL) of each DNA sample and calibrators pooled into each well. Do not pipette or spin tubes. Change the tip for each well.\n\tNOTE: 30 DNA samples can be processed for each Real-time experiment using the 96-well plate: 30 x 3 samples + 1 x 3 calibrators pooled + negative control = 94.\nBriefly spin down the plate at 1,000 x g.\nRun the plate using the following protocol: hold stage at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min.\n6. Data Analysis and Interpretation",
    "In the section \"option\", below the amplification plot results, set the Ct threshold at 0.2 for the first target gene analyzed. Repeat the set for each target or reference genes. To Export the real-time PCR file in .txt extension, press \"Export\" into toolbar. Flag only \"results\" in the select data to export → choose as file type the extension .txt → press \"start export\" → close the export tool.\nOpen the analysis software and import the file .txt (toolbar → import).\nSelect the file name to analyze and select the analysis setting by toolbar (play symbol).\nSpecify the calibrator sample and the known number of copies of the target (e.g., 1 copy for AR gene). Press \"apply.\"\nFor each sample, omit one well with different delta Ct (ΔCt) in comparison with other wells.\nReanalyze the experiment (press play symbol).\nEvaluate the results by the copy number bar plot or the table.\n\tNOTE: The results table contains numerous parameters like confidence, Z-score, and replicates analyzed that could be useful for results interpretation.\nSubscription Required.
