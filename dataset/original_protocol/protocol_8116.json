    "The protocol meets the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Southwest University.\n1. Determination of Stimulation Location\nReview the literature and confirm the stimulation location (here, the rTPJ)19,20,21.\n2. Preparation of Electrode Holding Cap\nNOTE: The following steps are shown in Figure 1.\nEnsure that all necessary materials are readily available: the 3D digitizer (Figure 2), standard measurement tape, a marking pen, the headform, and a swimming cap.\nPut the cap on the headform and mark the points on the cap.\n\t\nLocalize the Vertex (Cz). To do so, first mark the midpoint of the distance between the nasion and inion using a skin marker13,14,22. Then, measure the distance between the pre-auricular points and mark the midpoint. The point at which both points intersect is the Cz.\nCheck the location of the center electrode and the return electrodes. Here, the stimulation was applied on rTPJ. The rTPJ roughly corresponds to the midpoint between CP6 and P6 in the 10-10 EEG system19,20,21.\nFind CP6 and P622,23,24,25. According to the proportional requirements of the 10-10 system, locate the approximate location of the rTPJ on the scalp and mark it on the cap.\nAdjust the radius of the four return electrodes based on the objectives11,14,26. After this decision, mark the center electrode and return electrode locations on the cap.\n3. 3D Digitizer Measurement\nScan with the metal scanner to ensure that the environment for 3D digitizer is metal-free.\nPlacement of the cap on the subject's head\n\t\nMake sure that the references (Cz, Fpz, Oz, left preauricular point, and right preauricular point) on the cap align with the international 10-10 system for scalp location22. For example, localize the Vertex (Cz) on the scalp and place the cap onto the subject's head, aligning the cap's Cz to the subjects.\nArranging the 3D digitizer equipment",
    "Connect the 3D digitizer to the computer using the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface and make sure that the digitizer software is available and ready27.\nPut the source in front of the subject and fasten the elastic rope of the sensor around the head. Importantly, make sure that neither the source nor sensor moves during 3D digitizer measurement.\nNOTE: The source is a magnetic transmitter that emits an electromagnetic dipole field. The sensor is a receiver that detects the field.\nOpen the digitizer software on the computer and make sure that the 3D digitizer system communicates with the software.\nTest the accuracy of the stylus. Find a length of 10 cm on the ruler and record the zero graduation and ten graduation, respectively, using the stylus.\nNOTE: The measurement distance between the two recording points of the 3D digitizer should be captured. Compare the error with the reading from the 3D tracker.\nSelect the New icon and create a new subject file. Select the Sessions box, then Reference.\nNOTE: Using the 3D digitizer stylus, the reference position data (Cz, inion, nasion, left ear, right ear) of the subject are collected according to the software prompts.\nTo cater to the requirement of fNIRS experiments, use the Transmitter, Detector, and Channel options. Collect the position data of the center electrode and four return electrodes 3x for the transmitter, detector, and channel, in order to reduce error. Ensure that five electrodes are numbered and localize in turn.\nSave the three files that are generated.\n4. Data Conversion and Spatial Registration\nSelect the three files into the NIRS-SPM to achieve the real coordinates registration into MNI space28. Affine transform the reference points and five electrode points in participants to the corresponding points in each entry according to the MRI database in MNI space.",
    "Register the data to anatomical automatic labels and Brodmann areas and register the spatial information of the five electrode points to both of these.\nCompare the coordinates of stimulation in previous research with the obtained coordinates20,29.\nMake a small cut aligned to the five points marked on the cap, such that the plastic casing is embedded snugly into the cap.\n5. Stimulation\nMake sure that participant have no contraindications (i.e., history of neurological or psychiatric disorders) for HD-tDCS1,3 and that they provided written informed consent prior to the study (including HD-tDCS stimulation).\nFor device installation, ensure that all the necessary materials are available (Figure 3). Install the device as detailed in published literature14. A brief description is provided below.\n\t\nInstall the batteries and check that they are charged.\nConnect the conventional tDCS and 4x1 Stimulation Adapter.\nConnect the cables of five Ag/AgCI sintered ring electrodes to the matching receivers on the 4x1 adapter output cable.\nCheck that all materials are connected correctly.\nMeasure the head of the participant and place the cap on the head.\n\t\nEmbed the five plastic HD casings in the swimming cap.\nLocalize the Cz, Fpz, and Oz of the subject13,14. Adjust the reference on the cap to align with the international 10-10 system for scalp locations22. Once the cap is in position, ensure that it does not move.\nCollect the position data of the stimulated brain areas using the 3D digitizer. Make the corresponding adjustments according to the generated data.\nCover the scalp surface with electrically conductive gel. First, carefully separate the hair through the opening of the plastic casing using the end of a plastic syringe, until the scalp is exposed. Then, cover the exposed scalp with the electrically conductive gel through the plastic casing opening on the scalp surface.",
    "Set the parameters of the tDCS device: quality value, stimulus duration, intensity, and condition setting.\n\t\nTurn on the 4x1 Multichannel Stimulation Adapter.\nEnsure that the default setting is SCAN, which shows the impedance of one electrode at a time in the display window by scanning the electrodes14,30,31. Here, the impedance is described as \"quality value\". Values below 1.5 indicate sufficient quality14,30,31. In this case, the values were lower than 1.\nNOTE: If the impedance value exceeds these required limits, open the cap of the plastic casing with high impedance and adjust the hair and electrode to obtain the desired impedance value.\nPress the \"MODE SELECT\" button and switch from \"SCAN\" to \"PASS\", after the impedance values are acceptable.\nSelect the center-anode or center-cathode by pressing the \"POLARITY\" button. \"CENTRAL ANODE\" is the default setting.\nAdjust the settings on the conventional tDCS device to include stimulus duration (min), intensity (mA) and sham condition setting. In this case, anodal active stimulation was 1.5 mA, and the stimulus lasted 20 min. Next, push the \"RELAX\" lever to switch to full current.\nOnce everything is set, initiate the stimulation. Press the \"START\" button, and the DC intensity will ramp up until the target current is reached. The timer will then show the remaining time.\nNOTE: Some participants may feel uncomfortable during periods of increased DC intensity. In such cases, the current may be moderately decreased slightly for a few seconds by pulling down the \"RELAX\" lever. Then, push the dolly bar to full current, gradually, when participants feel comfortable again.\n6. Post-stimulation\nWhen the stimulation is over, turn the lever slowly to adjust the current to zero before turning off the power. Otherwise, participants may perceive stinging sensation or dizziness when turning off the power directly.",
    "After the stimulation, open the plastic cap and remove the Ag/AgCI sintered ring electrodes from the casing.\nRemove the swimming cap and clean the materials. Provide participants with tools to clean their hair.\nAsk participants to fill out a questionnaire after each stimulation session, if necessary (e.g., to measure adverse effects of screening following HD-tDCS, participant tolerance to brain stimulation, etc.; see Supplementary File).\nSubscription Required.
