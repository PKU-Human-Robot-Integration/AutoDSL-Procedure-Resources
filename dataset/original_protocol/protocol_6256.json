Workflow of transcriptomic analysis of single myofibers. The scheme summarizes principal steps for transcriptomic analysis of single myofibers. On the side of each box, it is reported the corresponding part of the protocol.Part I: Purification of long RNAs (mRNAs and lncRNAs) and short RNAs (miRNAs) from single isolated myofibers Myofiber isolationNote: Here we will describe myofiber isolation from soleus and Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) hindlimb muscles of 3 months old mice, but the same procedure can be used for other types of skeletal muscles optimizing the timing of collagenase dissociation. In principle, younger mice have smaller muscles, we suggest decreasing the time of collagenase incubation and the repetitions of triturating process with muscles of young mice, to avoid damage of myofibers. On the contrary, muscles of older mice have more connective tissue, it could be necessary increase the time of collagenase incubation and the repetitions of triturating process to obtain a sufficient number of single isolated myofibers for the following analyses. In any case, it is important to limit this step to avoid the alteration of gene expression and consequently cell pathways. Sacrifice mice according to the local animal welfare act. Collect soleus or EDL muscles from hindlimb mouse, taking care to handle them only by their tendons to minimize mechanical damage of myofibers (Figure 3). We used 3 months old CD1 mice. Store them in 1 ml of cold DMEM 3 mM BDM. Muscles collection should take no more than half an hour. Below, step by step procedure to collect soleus and EDL muscles.Peel off the leg skin to expose the hindlimb muscles.Gently remove the fascia of the hindlimb muscles.",
    "Position the mouse supine and expose the tendons of tibialis anterior (TA) and EDL.Cut the distal TA tendon and use it to remove the TA muscle by cutting it at its proximal attachment.Cut the distal EDL tendon and remove it through cutting the proximal EDL tendon.Place the muscle in a tube containing 1 ml of DMEM 3 mM BDM.Repeat Steps A5-A7 to collect the EDL of the other leg.Place the mouse in prone position.Cut the tendon of gastrocnemius muscle and use it to peel off the muscle until the exposure of the soleus tendon.Cut the soleus tendon and use it to remove the soleus cutting the other end.Place the muscle in a tube containing 1 ml of DMEM 3 mM BDM.Repeat to collect the soleus of the other leg.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190927/20190927021358_3236.jpgFigure 3. Muscles collection. A. EDL muscle isolated from hindlimb mouse muscles. B. Collection of one muscle in 1 ml of DMEM 3 mM BDM. C. Soleus muscle isolated from hindlimb mouse muscles.Digest the muscles for 45 min at 37 °C in 1 ml high-glucose DMEM 3 mM BDM containing 10 mg type I collagenase in one well of a 24-well plate.Sequentially rinse the muscles for 2 min in 3 ml of DMEM and 3 mM BDM, 3 ml DMEM and 3 mM BDM supplemented with 10% FBS and 3 ml of DMEM and 3 mM BDM in different wells of a 6-well plate (Figures 4A, 4B and 4C). Handle muscle with care and control under the microscope to avoid losing myofibers during these washing steps.Transfer the muscles into a well of 6-well plate with 3 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS at about 25 °C to inactivate collagenase (Figure 4D).",
    "Liberate myofibers by gentle physical trituration (pipetting up and down) using a wide-mouth plastic Pasteur pipette (about 4 mm diameter), rinsed in FBS to prevent sticking.Repeat the triturating process several times, eventually transferring non-dissociated muscle in new wells, until about 100 intact fibers are obtained. After each physical trituration, transfer the muscles into a new well, to get rid of collagen wisps and hyper-contracted fibers (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4G).Using a stereo-microscope and a micropipette (200 µl tips), pick one by one intact and well-isolated fibers and wash first in a well with DMEM 3 mM BDM 10% FBS and then in a well with PBS (Figure 4H). If the researcher chose to avoid the myofiber characterization via MyHC protein expression (possible on a piece of myofiber [Chemello et al., 2011]), after washing, transfer the single myofiber into an RNase/DNase free Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. The expression of specific genes [Myosin Heavy Chain 4 (Myh4), Myosin Light Chain 3 (Myl3), Myosin Heavy Chain 7 (Myh7), Tropomyosin 3 (Tpm3), actinin alpha 3 (Actn3), myosin heavy chain 2 (Myh2)] will be useful for the myofiber characterization (Chemello et al., 2019). See Figure 5 for the flowchart and timing specifications for each step.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190927/20190927021422_2689.jpgFigure 4. Steps for single myofiber dissociation and isolation. A. After 45 min of incubation with collagenase the muscle is transferred from a 24-well plate (on the left of the picture) into a well of a 6-well plate containing 3 ml of DMEM 3 mM BDM. After 2 min of incubation, the whole muscle is transferred into the second well and then in the third well, waiting 2 min for the incubation in each well. B. Representation of the third transfer of the muscle. C.",

Recover free myofibers from all the wells and transfer them into a new 24-well plate filled as described in H. H. Scheme of the plate used to wash single myofibers (I: first wash; II: second wash; 1, 2, 3: several wells to wash different myofibers. It is not necessary to use a well per myofiber). After the second wash, single myofibers can be collected independently in different Eppendorf tubes or can be cut into two pieces; one used for their characterization using MyHC proteins and the other for RNA extraction and transcriptional analyses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190927/20190927021450_2499.jpgFigure 5. Workflow for the isolation of single myofibers from hindlimb mouse muscles. Each box describes work steps and timing and is associated with the protocol points.Note: During the isolation of single myofibers it is mandatory to follow exactly the same procedure and time points when processing the same muscle types derived from different mice to avoid introducing errors due to tissue processing. Moreover, it is important to avoid recovering contracted fibers to avoid having a different gene expression due to their peculiar condition. There are no stopping points during the myofiber collection procedure.",
    "Only when myofibers are lysed in TRIzol for RNA analysis, in Laemmli buffer (Tris pH 6.8 62.5 mM, glycerol 10%, SDS 2%, β-mercaptoethanol 5%) for MyHC analysis (Chemello et al., 2011), flash freeze in nitrogen and then the tube can be stored at -80 °C. In Figure 1C, it is represented how isolated myofibers appear under microscope.Long RNA and short RNA separation using RNeasy kits (Qiagen)To proceed with RNA purification, it is better to avoid working with too many myofibers. We suggest working with 4-6 myofiber samples.Lyse each myofiber in 250 µl of TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pipetting up and down the solution.Add 50 µl of chloroform, mix well by inverting the tube, and incubate on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.Collect and transfer the aqueous upper phase (about 130 µl) into a new tube.Add 1 volume of 70% ethanol and mix.Transfer the solution onto a miRNeasy column (Qiagen).Spin for 15 s at 12,000 x g. Long RNAs are retained by the column, whereas short RNAs are collected in the eluate. Retain the eluate and process as described in Section D in Part I if you are interested in miRNA components.Long RNA purificationAdd 700 µl of RWT Buffer (Qiagen) to the column containing long RNAs (Section B in Part I).Spin for 15 s at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Add 500 µl of RPE Buffer (Qiagen) to the column.Spin for 15 s at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Add again 500 µl of RPE Buffer (Qiagen) to the column.Spin for 15 s at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Place the column in a new collection tube.",
    "Add 50 µl of nuclease-free water to the center of the column and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Spin for 1 min at ≥ 8,000 x g to eluate long RNAs. Eventually, store the eluate at -80 °C in the eluted volume.Use SpeedVac concentrator to reduce the volume to 14 µl. It is better to control the volume during its reduction to avoid drying the sample. Store at -80 °C until use. To avoid RNA binding to the plastic tube it is strongly suggested to use LoBind tubes.miRNA purification using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen)Add 0.65 volumes of absolute ethanol (about 165 µl) to the eluate produced after loading the aqueous phase of the TRIzol extraction into the miRNeasy columns (Section B in Part I) and mix well.Transfer the solution onto an RNeasy micro column (Qiagen).Spin for 15 s at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Add 500 µl of RPE Buffer (Qiagen) to the column.Spin for 15 s at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Add 500 µl of 80% ethanol to the column.Spin for 2 min at ≥ 8,000 x g and discard the eluate.Spin again for 5 min at ≥ 8,000 x g with the cap opened.Transfer the column to a new collection tube.Add 14 µl of nuclease-free water to the center of the column and incubate at room temperature for 2 min. Spin for 1 min at ≥ 8,000 x g to eluate miRNAs. Eventually, store the eluate at -80 °C in the eluted volume.Use SpeedVac concentrator to reduce the volume to 6.5 µl. If you dry the solution, resuspend miRNAs in nuclease-free water and preferably use LoBind tubes for the SpeedVac step.Store at -80 °C until use.",

    "Synthesis of the second stranded cDNASecond strand cDNA is synthesized by a PCR step avoiding reaching the plateau phase. In fact, it is important to maintain the original ratios of miRNAs. This step allows the production of double stranded DNA that, after its purification, can be sequenced because presenting on the 5′ and 3′ end sequencing primers for the Ion Torrent platform. It is important to use a High-Fidelity Taq DNA polymerase to avoid the introduction of errors during PCR amplification. For a scheme of the SMART protocol see Figure 6.Prepare the following mix to perform two PCR reactions per sample (each of 50 µl) (Table 13).Table 13.

Scheme for miRNA amplification. miRNAs extracted from a single myofiber are polyadenylated using the PAP enzyme (1, and Section B in Part III). After that, using the SMART technique (Wellenreuther et al., 2004) miRNAs are retrotranscribed. The primer used for the retrotranscription is an oligo-d(T) that includes the Ion P1 adapter sequence at the 5′ end (2). When the Superscript II reaches the 5′ end of miRNA it adds a stretch of no template C to the cDNA that serves for the binding of the SMART primer (3). In the SMART primer, the three terminal g are RNA nucleotides. After the binding of the SMART primer to the cDNA it is used from the Superscript II for the synthesis of the complementary sequence (4, and Section C in Part III). Using this method, two anchors at the 3′ and 5′ end of the miRNAs are produced. The two anchors can be used for the miRNA amplification by PCR reaction.",
    "During PCR amplification (Section D in Part III) a specific primer it is used to include the A adapter in the 5′ end of miRNAs (5) that will be useful for miRNA sequencing in a strand specific way. After 10-12 cycles of PCR amplification (6, 7, 8), sufficient quantity of double stranded DNA is obtained with P1 and A adaptors on the miRNA 3′ and 5′ end, respectively to allow emulsion-PCR and following sequencing.DNA purification using GenElute PCR Clean-Up Kit (Sigma)Pool the two PCRs (50 + 50 µl). If you have more than one sample remember to maintain them separated.Add 500 µl of Binding Solution to the pooled PCRs and transfer the solution into the binding column.Spin for 1 min at 12,000 x g and discard the eluate.Add 500 µl of Wash Solution to the column.Spin for 1 min at 12,000 x g and discard the eluate.Spin for 2 min at maximum speed without any additional wash.Transfer the column to a new collection tube.Add 50 µl of nuclease-free water to the center of the column and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Spin for 1 min at 12,000 x g.Quantify DNA using Nanodrop spectrophotometer.Store the purified PCR at -20 °C until use.Size selection for NGS using the E-Gel SizeSelect Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific)For DNA sequencing it is important to select the size range of DNA to be sequenced. In the case of long RNAs dimensional purification it was described in the Step G4 in Part II. Retained reads to identify miRNAs are 18-35 nt long (He et al., 2019) or purified small RNAs for miRNA libraries covers the same dimensional range ( Krishna et al., 2013; Fu et al.",
    ", 2018) and adapters added during the library construction (Sections D and E in Part III) are ~107 nucleotides (Primer A is 57 nt and Oligo-dT-Ion P1 50 nt ) (Figure 6). We, therefore, selected the smear between 125 and 142 nt. See below for the full procedure.Use a 2% agarose gel.Each well of the gel should be loaded with no more than 20-25 µl and 500 ng of DNA.If DNA prepared from Section E in Part III needed to be diluted use Low TE to dilute it.Dilute DNA ladder (50 bp) to 25 ng/µl with Low TE and load central well of the E-Gel with 10 µl of diluted ladder.Load sample wells avoiding using adjacent wells for different samples (same samples split in different volumes can be loaded in adjacent wells).Empty wells have to be filled with 25 µl of nuclease-free water. Run E-Gel SizeSelect instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) selecting the correct program (SizeSelect 2%).Visualize the run using the instrument and stop it when desired DNA dimension filled recovery well. Recover the solution from the recovery well using a P20 pipette without touching the gel. Usually, 12-15 µl can be recovered.Fill the recovery well with nuclease-free water replacing the withdrawn volume.Start again the instrument and repeat Step F9 in Part III until all the desired dimensional range is recovered.Dimensional analysis and library quantification (Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis)Run purified samples according to the High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent). Thaw High Sensitivity DNA kit at room temperature for at least 30 min.Prepare gel dye mix by adding 15 µl of High Sensitivity DNA dye to High Sensitivity DNA gel matrix.Mix by vortexing and spin down.Put the solution onto Spin-X Centrifuge tubes 0.22 µM pore diameter (Corning Costar) and centrifuge at 2,200 x g for 10 min at room temperature.",

Agilent Bioanalyzer chip loadingimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190927/20190927033046_8058.jpgFrom the Bioanalyzer analysis used to assess the library size distribution, determine the molar library concentration in pmol/L using the Bioanalyzer software. Determine the dilution factor that results in a concentration of the library of ~100 pM.This concentration is suitable for template preparation using Ion OneTouch Template Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Use the following formula: Dilution factor = (Library concentration in pM)/100 pM.Dilute the library in a new LoBind Eppendorf using a small amount of DNA library and necessary Low TE to yield approximately a concentration of 100 pM. Use this library dilution for template preparation.Emulsion-PCR (template preparation for DNA sequencing) using the Ion OneTouch system (Thermo I.Fisher Scientific)Note: Described material is included in the Ion PGM Hi‑Q OT2 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
