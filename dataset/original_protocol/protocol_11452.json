    "The study was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments (ECD 09/23 and ECD 12/28). All commercial details can be found in Table of Materials.\n1. F98 GB Rat Cell Model\nCulture the F98 GB cells, obtained from ATCC, in monolayers using Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium, 10% calf serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and 0.1% amphotericin b, and place in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C).\nInoculate the glioma cells in the brain of female Fischer F344 rats (body weight 170 g).\n\t\nUse sterile instruments and wear sterile gloves at all times.\nAnesthetize the rats by injecting a mixture of 74 mg/kg ketamine and 11 mg/kg xylazine intrapertioneally (IP) with an insulin syringe (1 mL, 29 G). Confirm the anesthetization by the absence of response to the withdrawal reflex of the limb. Immobilize the rats in a stereotactic device using fixation points for nose and ears. Place a carbomer eye gel to prevent dryness of the eyes while under anesthesia.\nShave the rat from eye level to the back of the skull and disinfect the skin with povidone-iodine.\nExpose the skull through a midline scalp incision of 2 cm, and make a 1 mm hole (diamond drill) 2 mm posterior and 2.5 mm lateral to the bregma in the right frontal hemisphere.\nInsert a stereotactically guided insulin needle (29 G) and inject 5 µL cell suspension (20,000 F98 GB cells) 3 mm deep using an microsyringe pump controller (settings: inject (I50), rate 1 nL/s (001 SDN)).\nWithdraw the syringe slowly and close the incision with bone wax. Suture the skin and disinfect with povidone-iodine.",
    "Stabilize the body temperature of the animal post-surgery using a red lamp. Monitor the awakening of the rat until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return the animal to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Keep all animals under environmentally controlled conditions (12 h normal light/dark cycles, 20-24 °C, and 40-70% relative humidity) with food and water ad libitum. Make sure to follow the animals closely by monitoring their body weight, food, water intake, and their activity and normal behavior. Use a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium to euthanize the animals (160 mg/kg) if a decline of 20% body weight is observed or when the normal behavior severely deteriorates (e.g., lack of grooming).\n2. Confirmation of Tumor Growth\nNOTE: Evaluate tumor growth 8 days post-inoculation using T2-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. When the tumor reaches a size of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3, select the rat for therapy.\nFirst, connect a 30 G needle to a 60 cm long tube, which is placed intravenously in the lateral tail vein. Anesthetize the rats through a nose cone with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen (0.3 L/min). Confirm anesthetization when the rats do not respond to the withdrawal reflex of the limb. Cover the rats with a heated blanket and place them in the MRI bed. Use a carbomer eye gel to prevent dryness.\nPlace the bed in the holder with a fixed rat brain surface coil, and position the bed in a 72 mm rat whole body transmitter coil.\nPerform a localizer scan followed by a T2-weighted spin-echo scan to assess tumor growth. T2-MRI sequence details: TR/TE 3661/37.1 ms, 109 µm isotropic in-plane resolution, slice thickness 600 µm, 4 averages, TA 9 min 45 s.",
    "If tumor is confirmed on the T2-weighted acquisition, inject a gadolinium-containing contrast agent into the intravenously placed tubing (MRI contrast agent; 0.4 mL/kg) 30 s after the start of the DCE-MRI acquisition. Acquire DCE-MRI during 12 min using a fast-low angle shot (FLASH) sequence in a single slice (1 mm slice thickness). Use an in-plane spatial resolution of (312 µm2) and a temporal resolution of 1.34 s.\nUsing the image sequence analysis tool, select a region of interest (ROI) within the suspected tumor region to plot the signal intensity over time. Subsequently, analyze the shape of the resulting DCE curve to confirm the presence of glioblastoma (Figure 3).\nFinally, acquire a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence. T1-MRI sequence details: TR/TE 1539/9.7 ms, 117 µm isotropic in-plane resolution, slice thickness 600 µm, 3 averages, TA 4 min 15 s. Typical contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images are shown in Figure 2.\nAfter finalizing the T1-weighted sequence, the animal can wake up under continuous supervision, until it regains full conciousness.\n3. Multimodality Imaging for Target Volume Selection\nNOTE: To be able to perform MRI-guided 3D conformal irradiation of the F98 GB rat model with PET-guided sub-volume boosting, 3 imaging modalities need to be performed. First, inject the radiotracer, then perform MRI during tracer uptake, subsequently perform a static PET acquisition and a treatment planning CT.\nAnesthetize the animals using a nose cone with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen (0.3 L/min). Confirm anesthetization when the rats do not respond to the withdrawal reflex of the limb. Use a carbomer eye gel to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nInsert a catheter (26 G) into the tail vein, enabling the injection of 37 MBq of PET radioactive tracer dissolved in 200 µL saline. Inject either 18F-FET or 18F-FAZA, 30 min or 2 h before PET acquisition, respectively.",
    "Inject MRI contrast agent (0.4 mL/kg) intravenously in the tail vein using the catheter 15 min before PET acquisition.\nPlace the rats on an in-house made multimodality bed and secure using hook-and-loop fasteners, maintaining a fixed position during imaging and micro-irradiation (Figure 1).\nFix three multimodality markers (capillaries filled with water) underneath, above, and on the right side of the skull. Place the rat, still fixed on the multimodality bed, in the animal holder of the MRI scanner, fix the rat brain surface coil and position this set-up in a 72 mm rat whole-body transmitter coil. Perform a localizer scan followed by a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence.\nTransport the animal to perform a 18F-FET or 18F-FAZA PET acquisition. Acquire a 30 min static PET scan in list-mode. Scan should be acquired either 30 min after 18F-FET injection or 2 h after 18F-FAZA injection. Reconstruct all PET scans into a 200 × 200 × 64 matrix by a 2D Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm using 60 iterations and a voxel size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.157 mm.\nPlace the animal, still fixed on the multimodality bed, on a plastic holder secured onto the four-axis robotic positioning table of the micro-irradiator. Perform a high-resolution treatment planning CT scan using an aluminum filter of 1 mm and a 20 x 20 cm (1,024 x 1,024 pixel) amorphous Si flat panel detector. Reconstruct the CT images with an isotropic voxel size of 0.2 mm. Fix the tube voltage and tube current at 70 kV and 0.4 mA, respectively. Acquire a total of 360 projections over 360 °.\n4. RT Treatment Planning",
    "Use the pre-clinical treatment planning system (PCTPS) for treatment planning. Import the planning CT into the PCTPS and manually segment this CT image into three different tissue classes: bone, soft tissue, and air. This manual segmentation is based on defining three different grey-value thresholds on the planning CT. These manually selected grey-value thresholds should be chosen such that air in the brain is absent and that bone thickness of the skull is non-zero. Once these thresholds are defined, material densities are assigned by the PCTPS for bone, soft tissue, and air (Figure 4).\nIf only MRI guidance is needed, load the MRI scan and co-register with the planning CT using the PCTPS.\n\t\nUse rigid body transformations (three translations and three rotations), the multimodality markers, and the skull. By overlaying the increased signal intensity of the skull on CT with black signal on MRI, a precise fusion can be achieved (Figure 5).\nSelect the target for irradiation in the center of the contrast-enhancing tumor on T1-weighted MRI, see Figure 6 and Figure 7.\nWhen additional PET information must be included, include a CT/MRI/PET co-registration using the biomedical image quantification software (BIQS).\n\t\nUse the contouring tool in the BIQS to achieve PET/MRI image fusion (Figure 8). After co-registration, select the target in the center of the increased PET tracer uptake in the BIQS (Figure 9) and enter the coordinates manually into the PCTPS using the following transformations: X → -X, Y → Z, and Z → -Y.\nSelect the prescribed dose, number of arcs, arc position, rotation range of the arcs, and the collimator size (Figure 10).",
    "For MRI-guided RT, use the following settings: a prescribed dose of 20 Gy, 3 arcs positioned at couch angles of -45 °, 0 °, and 45 ° with arc rotations of 120 °, and a collimator size of 5 x 5 mm.\nFor PET-MRI-guided RT, use the following settings: a prescribed dose of 20 Gy using 3 arcs and a 5 x 5 mm collimator and extra 5 Gy for sub-volume boosting using 3 non-coplanar arcs and a 1 x 1 mm collimator. Select a rotation of 120 ° for all arcs while changing the position of the couch (-45 °, 0 °, and 45 °).\nCalculate the dose distribution within the animal and the beam delivery parameters to deliver the prescribed dose to the target using the PCTPS. Before actual irradiation, test the arc rotations at the different couch positions to prevent any collision during irradiation.\nFor the actual irradiation, select a 0.15 mm copper filter, set the X-ray voltage to 220 kV, set the X-ray current to 13 mA, and position the right collimator on the gantry. Execute the RT by transferring the appropriate beam delivery parameters from the PCTPS to the micro-irradiator.\nDuring these procedures, the rat is kept under continuous isoflurane anesthesia (2% isoflurane, mixed with oxygen 0.3 L/min). Following the execution of the last arc, the animal can wake up under continuous supervision, until it regains full consciousness.\n5. Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs)\nNOTE: To compare the actual dose delivered to the tumor target volumes and the surrounding normal brain tissue, calculate DVHs.\nDraw a volume-of-interest (VOI) around the tumor and the normal brain on the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR images to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum dose (Figure 11).",
    "As a surrogate for the maximal, mean, and minimal dose to the tumor volume and the normal brain tissue volume, calculate the D2, D50, and D90. D stands for the dose received by x% of the volume, denoted by the subscript, and can be derived from the resulting DVH.\n6. TMZ and Sham Chemotherapy\nTo mimic the treatment of glioblastoma in patients, administer concomitant chemotherapy using IP injections of 29 mg/kg TMZ dissolved in saline with 25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) once a day for 5 days starting at the day of irradiation24,25. Use 1 mL, 29 G insulin syringe to administer injection.\nFor the control group, administer injection from step 6.1 without TMZ.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
