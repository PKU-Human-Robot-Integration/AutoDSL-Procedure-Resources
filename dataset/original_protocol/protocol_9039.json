    "1. Brain Mitochondrial Isolation (Adapted from Brown M.R. et al.9)\nSacrifice the rat using methods approved by the Institutional  Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nCut the head of the  animal by decapitation, cut the skin and expose the skull. \nOpen the skull gently  by cutting with a scissor or rongeur. Remove the brain.\nMince finely the  brain without cerebellum in Isolation Buffer (see Table 1) and transfer it to a  5 ml glass/teflon homogenizer (see equipment list).\nHomogenize  tissue gently 10 times (no bubbles), approximately 5 min.\nCentrifuge sample at  1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a bench-top centrifuge.\nSave the supernatant  (mitochondrial and  synaptosomes) and discard the pellet (nuclear material and cell debris). Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a bench-top centrifuge.\nDiscard supernatant  and re-suspend pellet in  500 μl of Isolation Buffer. Disrupt synaptosomes with a cell disruption vessel (see equipment list). Apply a  pressure of 1,200 psi for 10 min, followed by rapid decompression.\nLayer the mixture  onto Ficoll gradients (see Table 2), place in SW-50.1 rotor and centrifuge at 126,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C  in an ultracentrifuge (see equipment list). The  pellet is the purified mitochondria, the layer between the different densities of Ficoll is undisrupted synaptosomes.\nWash pellet by  centrifuging in Isolation Buffer at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a bench-top centrifuge.\n2. Submitochondrial Vesicles (SMV) Isolation (Adapted from Chan et al.10)\nRe-suspend mitochondria in 200 μl Isolation Buffer combined with an equal volume of 1% digitonin and allow to sit on ice for 15 min.\nAdd more Isolation Buffer and centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a bench-top centrifuge. Do this twice.",
    "Re-suspend pellet in 200 μl Isolation Buffer and add 2 μl of 10% Lubrol PX (C12E9). Mix and allow to  sit on ice for 15 min.\nLayer mixture onto Isolation Buffer, place in SW-50.1 rotor and centrifuge at 182,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 hr.\nWash final pellet by centrifuging in a desk-top centrifuge in Isolation Buffer at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.\n3. Electrophysiological Recording\nA typical electrophysiology rig includes an amplifier, a PC computer equipped with a Digidata 1440A analog-to-digital converter interface in conjunction with pClamp10.0 software,  manipulators, a microscope, a vibration isolation table, Faraday Cage.\nBorosilicate glass capillary tubes are inserted into a Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller Model  P-87. A pipette-puller program is optimized to generate pipettes with  resistances between 80 to 100 MΩ. \nSMVs are placed in a  physiological intracellular solution (ATP is added at the appropriate time  during the recording) (Table 3).  Patch clamp pipettes are filled with the same solution (no ATP). Recordings are made by forming a giga-ohm seal  onto SMVs at room temperature. Vesicles are visualized by phase-contrast microscopy with a Nikon or Zeiss  inverted microscope.\nThe membrane  potential is maintained at voltages ranging from -100 mV to + 100 mV for  periods of 10 seconds. Recordings are filtered at 5 kHz using the amplifier circuitry. Level of stray electrical or non-specific noise of less than 1 pA are desirable for successful recording.\nData are analyzed  with Clampfit 10.0 software for example to determine frequency and amplitude of  single channel events. Voltage dependence is determined by plotting a current  voltage relationship.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
