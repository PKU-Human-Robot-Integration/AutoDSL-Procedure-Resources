If cell viability is less than 80%, do not use these cells.\nSpin down cells for 3 min at 231 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL for each mouse of a solution made of 50:50 culture medium (DMEM without FBS) and Matrigel on ice.\nKeep cells on ice until injection into mice.\nNote: In our experience, 2 h of waiting did not affect tumor engraftment.\nPrepare cells from tumoroids.\nDetach Matrigel drops by scratching using the tip of a 1 mL pipette.\nAspirate the drop and medium using a 1 mL pipette.\nTransfer all drops to a 15 mL tube. Then add medium until 10 mL to balance the centrifuge.",
    "Spin down cells for 10 min at 450 g at room temperature.\nNote: room temperature is in range of 19°C–22°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of room temperature Tryplee Express to the pellet.\nIncubate for 3 min at 37°C, 5% CO2, then assess under the cell culture microscope that tumoroids are dissociated into single cells or small clusters.\nAdd 5 mL medium to inactivate Tryplee Express.\nCount cells:\nTake 10 μL of cell suspension and add 10 μL of trypan blue.\nDeposit this mix on cell counting chamber slides and count cells with cell counter.\nCalculate the volume of cells needed to obtain 0.5 × 106 cells in 100 μL that will be injected in each mouse.\nNote: If there are small clusters, count the cells in each cluster. If cell viability is less than 80%, do not use these tumoroids.\nSpin down cells for 10 min at 450 g at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL for each mouse of a solution made of 50:50 culture medium (DMEM/F12 without FBS) and Matrigel on ice to prevent premature polymerization of Matrigel.\nKeep cells on ice until injection into mice. In our experience, 2 h of waiting did not affect tumor engraftment.\nPreparation of mouse (day 0)\nTiming: 5 min per mouse\nThis section describes the preparation of mice before cell injection. The mouse needs to be immobilized and anesthetized. An analgesic is given to mice before the procedure to reduce pain. The colon should be cleaned to remove faces, which is done by gently massaging the mouse’s abdomen.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane and 2 L per minute air flow until it falls asleep.\nOnce the mouse is sleeping, reduce isoflurane to 2% with an airflow of 0.5 L per minute.",
    "Place tear gel on the eyes of the mice to prevent drying.\nInject 5 mg/kg Carprofen (Rimadyl) analgesic (in 100 μL) diluted in PBS subcutaneously.\nPosition the mouse on its back with hind legs apart, immobilized with surgical tape (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2345-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse preparation and crypts removal\n(A) Anesthetized mouse is placed on its back and kept under isoflurane. The mouse’s legs are immobilized with the tape.\n(B) The interdental brush is immersed in an EDTA solution heated to 50°C for 30 s.\n(C) The interdental brush is gently inserted into the mouse’s anus and advanced for 1,5 cm into the colon.\n(D) The interdental brush is gently removed and immersed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing PBS.\n(E) Removed crypts visualized under EVOS M5000 microscope. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(F) High magnification of a crypt isolated from a mouse colon. Scale bar, 25 μm.\nRemove feces present in the colon by gently massaging the mouse’s abdomen.\nNote: You should feel with fingers that the colon is empty.\nCritical: This step is essential because unremoved feces in the distal part of the colon may prevent the cells from attaching to the colonic mucosa. Feces can also open the anus too quickly (which will be obstructed at the end of the experiment using surgical glue) and thus decrease the time of adhesion of cells to the colonic mucosa. Do not wash the colon with PBS or similar solutions, as this will dilute the EDTA and the injected cells.\nRemoval of mouse epithelium (day 0)\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step injures the colonic mucosa to felicitate the attachment of injected cells. The lesions are made by an electric interdental toothbrush soaked into a hot EDTA solution. The same experimenter can prepare both the mice and EDTA.",
    "Pre-heat 0.5 M EDTA, pH8 at 50°C in a water bath 15 min before the start of the experiment.\nImmerse the interdental brush for 30 s in the pre-heated EDTA solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nGently insert the interdental brush into the mouse’s anus and advance it 1.5 cm into the colon (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTurn on the vibration of the interdental brush for 10 s.\nCritical: This step is crucial because the number of removed crypts must be sufficient but not excessive. The optimal number of detached crypts is between 2,500 and 5,000 crypts. The pressure exerted on the interdental brush should not be too strong to avoid piercing the colonic wall. In case of bleeding, interrupt the abrasions immediately.\nThe interdental brush is gently removed and immersed in an Eppendorf tube containing 1.5 mL of PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nTurn on the vibration for 5 s to release the removed crypts (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nEvaluate the efficiency of crypt removal:\nPipette 10 μL of PBS containing crypts on a slide.\nCount detached crypts under a cell culture microscope.\nMultiply this number by 150 to obtain the total number of detached crypts (that are in 1.5 mL PBS).\nIf there are no or not enough detached crypts, additional abrasions should be performed, assessing the presence of crypts after each abrasion.\nEliminate the residual EDTA by massaging the mouse’s abdomen for 2 min.\nInjection of cells in the mouse colon (day 0)\nTiming: 5 min\nAt this stage, cells are deposited in the colonic lumen in the area of the lesions made with the interdental brush.\nMix the cell solution gently to avoid bubbles.\nPipette 100 μL of a solution containing cells and Matrigel using a 200 μL pipette tip.",
    "Insert the pipette tip very gently into the colonic lumen parallel to the colon wall and advance as far as possible (about 1.5 cm).\nPinch the anus and tip of the pipette with tweezers and slowly pipette out cells into the colonic lumen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2345-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Injection of cells\n(A) Solution containing cells and Matrigel is inserted in the colonic lumen.\n(B) A drop of biological glue is placed on the anus, and the edges of the anus are pressed with tweezers to prevent the leakage of the solution containing cells.\n(C) Mouse is kept with raised pelvis until it wakes up.\nGently remove the pipette tip while continue applying pressure to the clamp to keep the anus closed.\nCarefully remove the cone from the anus while maintaining pressure.\nAdd a drop of surgical glue to close the anus of the mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nHold the mouse in a position with the raised legs and pelvis until it wakes up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAfter 4 h, verify that the anus of the mice is opened. If not, remove the remaining glue with a damp tissue.\nCritical: This step is critical because the cells should not leak from the colonic lumen. The cells should be deposited as far as possible, carefully not to pierce the colon. The volume of deposited glue should be sufficient to hold the anus closed for at least 4 h to allow cell attachment. However, it should not be excessive, ideally self-removed within 4 h.\nLive imaging of tumor growth by endoscopy (day 7 to day 90)\nTiming: 5 min per mouse",
    "This step allows visualization of tumor growth by colonoscopy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Colonoscopy could be used to observe a healthy, non-damaged colon (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), a colon just after damage with an interdental brush (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), or to follow tumor growth (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2345-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Visualization of tumor growth using endoscopy\n(A) Animal endoscope composed of a cold light source, a camera control unit, a camera, and a device to inject air to inflate the colon.\n(B) The colon observed with an endoscope before the procedure.\n(C) Colon observed after brush injury.\n(D) Tumor in the colon visualized 15 days after the injury.\n(E) Tumor in the colon visualized 37 days after the injury. Scale bar, 1 mm.\nImaging is done starting one week after the transplantation, once every week and up to 3 months, depending on the tumor growth. Mice could be kept alive until the defined humane endpoint, i.e., 50% obstruction of the colonic lumen or deterioration in the general condition of the animal.\nNote: Repeating the imaging several times a week should be avoided to limit repeated anesthesia and limit the risk of bleeding in the animals.\nAnesthetize mice using 3% isoflurane, 2 L per minute, until it falls asleep.\nReduce isoflurane between 2% isoflurane with airflow of 0.5 L per minute during imaging.\nImmobilize the mouse with tape on the hind legs.\nRemove feces by abdominal massage as described above.\nNote: You should feel with fingers that the colon is empty.\nApply vaseline around the anus to facilitate insertion of the endoscope.",
    "Insert the endoscope gently into the anus while dilating the colon by blowing air into the port using a 50 mL syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The quantity of air depends on how close the colon is. In general, the injected volume of air is around 5 mL.\nMove the endoscope throughout the colon gently while recording the movie.\nLive imaging of tumor growth intravital IVIS (day 7 to day 90)\nTiming: 30 min per mouse\nThis step allows visualization of tumor growth by IVIS (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). IVIS could be used to follow the growth of the primary tumor by repeated imaging (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4E) or to visualize metastasis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). Imaging is done starting one week after the transplantation, once every week and up to 3 months, depending on the tumor growth.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2345-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Mice are imaged at different time points to follow the tumor growth and emergence of metastases.\n(C) Mouse before injection of cells.\n(D) Mouse just after injection of cells. The detected signal is from injected cells.\n(E) Mouse imaged 37 days after cell injection. The detected signal shows a tumor, Scale bar, 1 cm.\n(F) Mouse imaged 37 days after cell injection. As the signal from the primary tumor is too strong, obstructing the detection of any potential signal from the metastasis, the mouse’s lower abdomen (colon) is covered with thick paper to block the signal coming from the primary tumor (black square). The detected signal in the upper abdomen represents metastases.",
    "Note: Repeating the imaging several times a week should be avoided to limit repeated anesthesia.\nInject 200 μL of a 15 mg/mL luciferin solution (150 mg/kg of animal) intraperitoneally.\nWait 15 min to ensure consistent photon flux before imaging using IVIS.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane and 2 L per minute air flow until it falls asleep.\nOnce the mouse is sleeping, reduce isoflurane to 2% with an airflow of 0.5 L per minute (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPosition the mouse on his back in Xenogen Vivovision IVIS lumina II heating chamber (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Animals are maintained in the instrument using the integral anesthetic manifold. The stage is at a constant temperature of 37°C, which maintains the mouse’s body temperature.\nUsing Living Image software, set up exposure time to 1 min, f-stop to 1 and large pixel binning.\nCollection of samples (day 30 to day 90)\nTiming: 20 min per mouse\nNote: Mice could be sacrificed at a defined time point, but not later than the humane endpoint - when the size of the tumor reaches 50% of the colonic lumen. The colon is systematically removed, while the liver and other organs are removed if macroscopic tumors are detected.\nSacrifice mice by cervical dislocation.\nOpen the abdomen and inspect the organs (liver, lungs, peritoneum) for the presence of macroscopic metastases. Macroscopic metastasis could be observed by eyes as white spots (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nCut the urogenital system and pelvis, and then excise the anus and the distal part of the colon (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nInspect colon for presence of tumors.\nNote: Tumors could be mistaken by enlarged lymphoid tissues.\nTake also other organs if they contain macrometastasis.\nNote: Metastases will not be formed if primary tumor grow too fast.\nTissue fixation and embedding (day 30 to day 90)\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Fix organs in 25 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in PBS using 50 mL tube for 1 h at 4°C with gentle shaking.\nDecant PFA and wash tissues with PBS for 10 min at 4°C with gentle shaking.\nDecant PBS and add 15 mL of 15% sucrose in a 50 mL tube at 4°C with gentle shaking. These sucrose steps remove water from the tissues.\nIncubate tissue for 2 h at 4°C.\nDecant solution and replace it with 15 mL of 30% sucrose in 50 mL tube.\nIncubate tissue for 2 h at 4°C.\nPlace tissue in plastic 15 × 15 × 5 mm mold and include in OCT at room temperature. Orient the colon vertically (lumen of the colon facing up) with the anus sitting at the bottom of the mold. For other organs, the orientation of the tissue is not important.\nPlace the mold at −20°C for at least 2 h to let OCT solidify.\nCutting samples using cryostat (day 30 to day 90)\nTiming: 30 min per sample\nOrient the OCT block with the anus/rectum facing the blade.\nNote: The OCT block should be trimmed until reaching the tissue.\nTrim the anus and rectum until reaching the tumor that can be seen macroscopically.\nCut colon/tumor into 8 to 10 μm-thick slices.\nNote: For other tissues, just trim the OCT and proceed with cutting the tissue into 8 to 10 μm-thick slices.\nTransfer the tissue to the slide Super frost + by contact.\nStaining samples (day 30 to day 90)\nTiming: 2 h\nAdd 500 μL of a solution containing 25 μg/mL DAPI in PBS to the sections.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove the DAPI solution, add 8 drops of Aquapolymount mounting solution on the tissue section and cover with 24 × 50 mm coverslip.\nLeave to dry for at least 1 h before imaging.\nImaging samples (day 30 to day 90)\nTiming: 1 h per sample\nImage samples using an epifluorescent microscope or, for higher resolution images, a confocal microscope (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6F).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2345-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
