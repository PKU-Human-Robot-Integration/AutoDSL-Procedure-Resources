    "All mice used in these protocols were housed and raised according to the Rutgers University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (Protocol 201702497) and National Institutes of Health guidelines. These regulatory bodies approved all experimental procedures involving animal studies. All mice used in the present study were 6-8-week-old CF-1 females.\n1. Experimental preparation\nBefore starting the SAC evaluations, collect mouse oocytes following the previously published report12. Divide collected oocytes into three evenly sized groups and keep them in Chatot, Ziomek, and Bavister (CZB) culture media containing 2.5 µM milrinone (see Table of Materials) to avoid meiotic resumption13.\n\tNOTE: CZB composition: 81.6 mM NaCL; 4.8 mM KCl; 1.2 mM KH2PO4; 1.2 mM MgSO4-7H2O; 0.27 mM Pyruvate; 1.7 mM CaCl2; 30.8 mM DL-Lactic Acid; 7 mM Taurine; 0.1 mM EDTA; 25 mM NaHCO3; Gentamicin; and 0.3% BSA.\nPrepare the cRNA for microinjection as described previously12,14. Amplify the mouse Securin gene from the cDNA cloned from mouse germinal vesicle oocytes, followed by subcloning into the pMDL2 vector containing Gfp sequence15,16.\n\t\nTo prepare Securin-Gfp cRNA, linearize the plasmid with Nde I digestion. Perform in vitro transcription by using T3 RNA polymerase and purifying the cRNA16.\n\t\t​NOTE: Store cRNA in aliquots of 2-3 µL at -80 °C until use.\n2. Nocodazole treatment and live imaging\nPrepare 1 mL of culture media (CZB) containing 5 µM nocodazole (NOC), 1 mL of culture media with 5 µM of NOC plus 0.5 µM reversine (NOC + REV), and 1 mL of culture media with Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1:2000) as a control (see Table of Materials).",
    "For oocyte maturation and live imaging, use a 96-well plate pre-warmed in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity. In the first well, load 150 µL of the control DMSO treatment; in the second well, load 150 µL of NOC treatment; and in the third well, load 150 µL of NOC + REV treatment. Keep the plate in the incubator under the same conditions as above until needed.\n\tNOTE: In the 96-well plate, avoid using the first row and the first column because the shadow of the border interferes with the quality of the images.\nTo start meiotic maturation, remove milrinone. While viewing the oocytes under a stereomicroscope using magnification between 30x-64x, wash milrinone out of the media by sequentially transferring the oocytes through six drops of 100 µL of milrinone-free culture media containing DMSO and place them into the corresponding well of the 96-well plate using a hand- or mouth-operated pipette.\n\t\nCount oocytes by picking them up using a hand- or mouth-operated pipette and delivering them to the next drop to avoid losing any. The oocytes are single, large (~80 µm in diameter), and round cells. The nucleus will appear like a button in the center of the cell, and the membrane and zona pellucida surround the oocyte.\n\t\tNOTE: Transfer the oocytes among drops while moving the least amount of liquid possible. This allows for optimal removal of the milrinone from the culture media. If oocytes fail to resume meiosis, it is likely that the milrinone was not effectively removed.\nRepeat the same process (step 2.3) for NOC and NOC + REV treatment.",
    "Image the oocytes using a brightfield microscope equipped with an incubator chamber with a controlled environment under these conditions: 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity. Capture images at the middle plane of the oocytes at intervals of 20 min for 24 h.\nQuantify the number of oocytes that extrude a polar body (PB) by identifying the cells that go through asymmetrical cytokinesis. The result will be a small cell (PB) next to the egg and within the shared zona pellucida. View the images using imaging software (ImageJ, see Table of Materials).\nImport image sequence into the image analysis software and advance the frames until one or more cells go through asymmetrical cytokinesis. Calculate the percentage of oocytes that extrude a PB of the total of oocytes17.\n3. Monitoring the pattern of Securin-gfp degradation during meiotic maturation\nCentrifuge 3 µL of Securin-Gfp cRNA(step 1.2) at 19,283 x g for 30 min at 4 °C18.\n\tNOTE: Use the supernatant to avoid loading impurities that could cause needle blockage during microinjection.\nFollow step-by-step oocyte microinjection, extensively described in reference12. Microinject prophase I-arrested oocytes with 100 ng/µL of Securin-gfp cRNA prepared in step 1.2.\nAfter microinjection, allow the oocytes to recover and translate the RNA in the CO2 incubator for at least 3 h. Check the expression by observing the oocytes in an automated multichannel fluorescence imaging system (see Table of Materials) to view the GFP signal.\nAs described in step 2.2, load 150 µL of culture media with or without 5 µM of nocodazole and 150 µL of culture media with 0.5 µM of reversine in three different wells of a 96-well plate.\nWash the microinjected oocytes through six drops of milrinone-free culture media and transfer 1/3 of the oocytes into each treatment.",
    "Keep the plate in the incubator at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 and 80% humidity until the oocytes resume meiosis, around 3 h post milrinone washing.\n\tNOTE: Use a stereomicroscope with magnification between 30x-64x to evaluate the nuclear envelope breakdown as a hallmark of meiotic resumption.\nRecord images of oocyte maturation using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an incubator chamber as described in step 2.6. Use brightfield settings to find the oocytes in the well. Use a 488 filter to detect the Securin-gfp signal and adjust the fluorescence intensity to avoid over-exposing the cells.\n\t\nIf the imaging system is automated, save the positions of the oocytes in each well. Because Securin-gfp is evenly distributed into the cytoplasm, capture images in the middle plane of the oocytes at intervals of 20 min for 24 h. To capture groups of oocytes in one picture, use a lower magnification objective lens such as 10x.\nUse image analysis software to quantify Securin-gfp destruction. Open the images of the GFP channel. Start at time point 1. In the preferred analysis software, use a selection or shape tool to mark each oocyte and generate a region of interest (ROI) for each cell.\n\t\nUse the same ROI to select a background area to be subtracted later. Measure GFP pixel intensity in each ROI.\nUsing the ROIs for each oocyte generated in step 3.8, measure the GFP intensity in all the time points.\n\tNOTE: In some software programs, an \"Analyze\" tab allows the selection of the Measure function.",
    "Then, advance to the next time frame and repeat this process to measure the intensity of GFP in each time frame. Lastly, to each GFP value, subtract the measurement of the ROI in the background selected in step 3.8. This analysis will give a value for Securin-gfp intensity for each oocyte at each time point.\nExtract different parameters from the pattern of Securin destruction: (a) the time that Securin-gfp degradation began. This tells when SAC silencing started; (b) the time of Securin-gfp minimum signal. This tells when SAC silencing has dropped below a threshold level to allow high APC/C activation and full Securin-GFP degradation; (c) the rate of Securin-gfp destruction19. This tells how rapidly SAC activity drops below a threshold level for APC/C activation and Securin-GFP degradation.\n4. Recruitment of MAD2 at kinetochores by immunofluorescence during meiotic maturation\nNOTE: For oocyte collection and maturation, refer to the previously published report12.\nSplit oocytes into three groups. Transfer each group of oocytes into 100 µL drops of milrinone-free culture media. Cover the drops with mineral oil and place them in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity) for 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h to reach early prometaphase I, late prometaphase I, and metaphase I stage, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Place each time point in a different dish to avoid taking out the same dish from the incubator several times, which affects the regular timing of meiotic maturation.\nAt the assigned time points, fix the oocytes by transferring them into 500 µL drops of 2% PFA in 1x PHEM buffer for 20 min at room temperature, using a 9-well glass dish as previously described20. Then, transfer the cells to a clean well containing a 500 µL drop of blocking solution (PBS + 0.3% BSA + 0.01% Tween-20 + 0.02% NaN3).",
    "NOTE: PHEM composition: 60 mM PIPES; 25 mM HEPES; 10 mM EGTA; and 2 mM MgCl2.\n\tNOTE: One can stop at this point and store the oocytes in blocking solution in the 9-well plate at 4 °C until the convenient time to complete immunofluorescence.\nTo continue MAD2 detection, transfer the oocytes to a clean well containing a 500 µL drop of permeabilization solution (PBS + 0.3% BSA + 0.1% TritonX-100 + 0.02% NaN3). Incubate for 20 min at room temperature, and then transfer the cells to a new well of blocking solution and incubate for 10 min.\nFor the rest of the immunofluorescence steps, use a 96-well dish lid with indentations as previously described20. Use a humidified dark chamber to avoid light exposure and evaporation. Transfer the oocytes into a 30 µL drop of blocking solution with anti-MAD2 antibody (1:1000, rabbit) and anti-centromeric antibody (ACA) (1:30, human) (see Table of Materials) and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The 96-well dish lid allows room for the processing of several proteins and groups at the same time.\nTo wash excess primary antibodies, transfer the cells to a 30 µL drop of 1x PHEM buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton and incubate for 10 min in the humidified chamber. Repeat this step two more times.\nPerform the fourth wash, transferring the cells to a 30 µL drop of 1x PHEM buffer without 0.5% 1x Triton, and incubate for 10 min.\nTransfer the cells to a 30 µL drop of blocking solution containing secondary antibodies such as anti-human-633 (1:200) and anti-rabbit-568 (1:200) (see Table of Materials) and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Choose the combination of fluorophores based on your microscope lasers or filters.\nTo wash excess secondary antibodies, repeat steps 4.5-4.6.",
    "To mount the cells on the microscope slide, transfer the cells to a 10 µL drop of mounting media containing DAPI (0.1 mg/mL) (see Table of Materials). Add small dots of petroleum jelly to each corner of the coverslip, carefully place them on top of the mounting media drop, and press slowly to distribute. Use clear nail polish to seal the coverslip to the slide. For a more detailed description of the mounting process, see reference20.\nImage kinetochores using a confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) equipped with a 40x or 63x objective. Using the ACA signal, determine the z-range that allows imaging of the entire chromosome area.\n\tNOTE: An optical zoom of 4.0 and z-step size of 0.5 µm can be used on some imaging systems. These parameters may vary from system to system, and optimization will be necessary.\nAnalyze MAD2 intensity at kinetochores using image analysis software. Make a z-stack maximum projection and then split the channels.\nFirst, create a mask using the ACA channel by selecting the ACA channel to establish a threshold that identifies all the kinetochore signals. Go to the edit tab and create a selection. Then, create an ROI with this selection.\nSelect the MAD2 channel and bring in the selection created in step 4.12. Select a threshold method that better adapts to the MAD2 signal. Measure the intensity.\n\tNOTE: Select the threshold method in the control treatment and keep it constant when analyzing different treatments.\nTo make relative pixel intensity calculations, divide the intensity of each cell by the average intensity of the WT oocytes in the experiment.\nSubscription Required.
