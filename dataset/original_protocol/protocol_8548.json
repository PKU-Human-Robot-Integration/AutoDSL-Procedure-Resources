    "Caution: Fine, powdery scales released by Manduca can be allergenic so the use of laboratory safety gloves and a face mask is recommended.\n1. Dissection of Manduca sexta to Reveal the Maxillary Nerves and the SEZ\nChoose an appropriate moth of either sex based on the following features: three days after eclosion with a general healthy appearance (wings should be fully extended, and the proboscis and antennae should be intact).\nPlace the moth individually in a plastic cup for transportation.\nInsert the moth into a polypropylene tube.\n\tCaution: We recommend performing this step in a fume hood to prevent the moth's powdery scales from spreading.\n\t\nThe tube should be slightly longer that the moth's body (Figure 1A). The tube can be made by cutting a 15 mL polypropylene tube.\nPush the moth until the head is exposed and insert balled-up tissue paper into the other end of the tube to help keep the moth immobile (Figure 1A).\nRemove the hair from the moth's exposed head (ventral and dorsal) by blowing pressurized air onto it.\nAn air jet can be made by connecting a syringe (1 mL with a needle, I.D. around 1.4 mm, with sharp tip removed) to a pressurized air source.\n\t\tNote: After removing the hair all the following steps can be performed outside the fume hood.\nOnce most of the hair has been removed, place the tube into a holding chamber with the dorsal part of the head facing up, as shown in Figure 1B.\nOn a petri dish, use modeling clay to build a triangular base about 7 cm long, 2.5 cm high (Figure 1B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55868/55868fig1.jpg",

The inner diameter should be large enough so that the antenna and proboscis can fit snugly.\nPrepare a hook by bending a wire (22 AWG, of about 7 cm long). Extend the moth's proboscis and then insert it into one of the small tubes by pulling it through with the wire hook until the tube reaches the proximal part of the proboscis.\nSecure the small tube with firm batik wax (using, for example, a dental electric waxer to melt and direct the wax) to the dorsal part of the moth's head-capsule (Figure 2A left).\nPlace each antenna into a tube and secure the tubes with batik wax as shown in Figure 2A (left). Be careful to avoid damaging the antennae with the hot wax.\nStabilize the brain against movement by cutting muscles that cover the anterior surface of the brain (i.e. buccal compressor muscle).\nUnder the dissection microscope, use micro-dissection scissors or a mini-axe fashioned from a razor chip glued to a toothpick to open the head capsule by making a small cut just below the proboscis (Figure 2A, left upper inset).",
    "Use micro-dissection scissors to cut the buccal compressor muscle (for illustrations see reference 25). As the muscle is not easily visible, the following behavioral test is recommended to confirm that it has been cut.\nDilute sucrose in distilled water to achieve a 1 M solution.\nUse a pipette to deliver about 200 µL of sucrose solution to the distal 2/3 of the proboscis, and observe the proboscis for 5 min. If the muscle was properly cut the insect should not be able to extend or move the proboscis.\nApply a layer of melted batik wax to seal the opening in the head-capsule.\nFlip the insect over so the ventral side of the head-capsule is now facing up.\nTo perfuse saline during and after the dissection procedure build up a wax cup around the ventral side of the head using the electric waxer: Under a dissection microscope, start building the cup by applying the first row of wax along the front of the head, moving toward the back. Keep the proboscis and antennae tubes inside the cup (Figure 2A right).\nContinue building the cup outward and upward until it reaches the level of the eyes.\nUse forceps to take one of the two labial palps, then place it on the side and secure it into the wax cup by adding more melted wax. Do the same with the other maxillary palp (Figure 2A right).\nSeal any openings in the wax cup and tubes.\n\tNote: In this step epoxy is used because it helps to easily seal gaps in the wax and the tubes, and avoids any heat-related damage to the antennae and proboscis.\n\t\nUse a toothpick to mix binary epoxy in a plastic mixing dish. Retain the mixing dish.",
    "Use the toothpick to apply a thin layer of epoxy to the outside and the inside of the cup (Figure 2B).\nFill the empty space in the tubes that contain the proboscis and antennae with epoxy, and fill the part of the polypropylene tube surrounding the neck with enough epoxy to hold it firmly in place (Figure 2B).\nLeave the epoxy to dry for approximately 20 min. To check this, test the epoxy remaining in the plastic mixing dish to ensure it is solid and no longer sticky.\nFill the wax cup with Manduca physiological saline 28 and wait a couple of minutes to make sure there are no leaks. If a leak is visible, try to seal it by applying more hot wax and/or epoxy.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55868/55868fig2v2.jpg\nFigure 2: Preparing Manduca for Dissection. (A) Antennae and proboscis are protected inside small tubes made from pipette tips cut into three pieces of about 0.5 cm in length. (Left panel, large image) The tubes are secured with melted batik wax applied around the dorsal part of the head. (Left panel, inset) To remove the buccal compressor muscle, the dorsal side of the head capsule is opened by making a small cut as indicated by the dotted line in the large image. (Right panel) A wax cup is built surrounding the ventral side of the head as a reservoir for perfused saline during the dissection procedure and recording experiments. (B) Epoxy is used to seal gaps between the base of the wax cup and the dorsal part of the head (left panel), and between the wax and the tubes containing the antennae and proboscis, including the openings of the tubes (right panel).

    "Under the dissection microscope, use micro-dissection scissors to cut off the labial palps.\nUse micro-dissection scissors or a mini-axe to open the ventral side of the head capsule by making four cuts: two cuts along the cuticle that surrounds each eye from back to front, one cut on the cuticle along the back of the head, and one cut on the cuticle along the front of the head near the proboscis (Figure 3A).\nGently pull away the cuticle using micro-dissection forceps to expose the brain.\nBy using two sharp micro-dissection forceps slowly and carefully remove fat tissue and the trachea covering the SEZ. Avoid any damage to the brain or nerves (e.g., maxillary nerve, optic nerve, cervical connective). Rinse the brain by frequently replacing the saline solution, and adjust the light often for improved visibility. Note: This may be the most critical part of the dissection; it is easy to inadvertently damage the maxillary nerve by tugging on or crushing it.\n\tNote: At this point the SEZ and the maxillary nerves should be clearly visible (Figure 3B-3C). However, the brain and the maxillary nerves are covered by a thin sheath.\nTo remove the sheath, replace the saline in the wax cup with 10% (w/v) collagenase/dispase dissolved in saline and leave it in place for 5 min. Then, after rinsing the brain several times with saline, gently remove the sheath with super-fine micro-dissection forceps by pulling the sheath up from the SEZ through the maxillary nerves.\nBegin to perfuse the wax cup with fresh saline. Place the tube from a saline drip line into the wax cup and secure it there with melted wax.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55868/55868fig3.jpg",

Tastant Delivery System\nThe tastant delivery system is composed of four main elements: the water source, the tastant manifold, the color sensor, and the site containing the proboscis, all connected to a rigid plastic tube (Figure 4A-4B). To build this system follow the steps shown in Figure 4B. Use a rigid plastic tube about 6 cm in length (ID 0.3 cm).\nUse a soldering iron to make a small hole in the tube where the proboscis is going to be placed (Figure 4A-4B).\nTo ensure that the proboscises of different animals are always placed in the same location, attach plastic screening material (mesh, hole size of about 0.1 cm) into the tube (Figure 4A-4B). With a razor blade or a rotary tool cut the rigid tube about 5 mm above the proboscis hole. Place the mesh between the two pieces of tube. Secure the mesh and reconnect the tubes by applying epoxy on the outside of the tubes. Leave the epoxy to dry for approximately 20 min.",
    "For tastant delivery use a pressurized perfusion system with as many tastant tubes as needed, joined to a manifold (see below). Use the soldering iron to make a small hole in the rigid tube about 1 cm above the mesh. Insert the output tube from the perfusion system (ID 0.86 mm) into the rigid tube and secure it there by applying epoxy (Figure 4A-4B).\nUse a peristaltic pump to deliver a constant flow (~40 mL/min) of distilled water. Connect it with silicone tubing to the rigid tube (Figure 4A-4C). Connect the other side of the rigid tube to another silicon tube to direct the output into a large waste container (Figure 4A-4C).\nTo deliver the tastant, inject compressed air into the manifold of the perfusion system. This can be achieved, for example, by using a pneumatic pump (10 p.s.i.) controlled by a timed voltage pulse input to inject compressed air into the manifold tube containing the desired tastant. A 1s pulse ejects about 0.5 mL of tastant.\n3. Tastant Preparation and Monitoring Tastant Delivery\nDilute tastant in distilled water to the desired concentration. Be aware that the tastant will be further diluted by the water stream. We measured the final concentration reaching the proboscis as 77% of the initial concentration (see references 10,29).\nAdd an artificial food dye to each tastant solution to allow determining the precise timing with which the tastant passes over the proboscis. We found that the green dye (see Material List) at 0.05% w/v does not activate Manduca GRNs.",
    "Use a color sensor (see Table 1) to detect the food coloring in the tastant solutions. Use a soldering iron to make a hole adjacent to the mesh and 0.5 cm below the output tube of the perfusion system (Figure 4A-4B). Connect the sensor to the rigid tube and secure it there applying epoxy on the outside.\nRecord the color sensor voltage output as an analog signal together with physiological signals (see section 4). The color sensor voltage signal can be amplified using a DC amplifier connected to the sensor (Figure 4A).\nEnsure that the color sensor is working by delivering the tastant and recording the sensor's voltage output. The signal elicited by the dye should exceed the noise level.\nAdjust the constant water flow rate to make the signal as close to square as possible.\n\t\tNote: When delivering multiple tastants in sequence, note the first trial with a new tastant will consist of a blend of the new and previous tastant. For this reason, we did not analyze these first trials.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55868/55868fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Tastant Delivery System. (A) A schematic of the apparatus used for delivering and monitoring timed pulses of tastants to the proboscis of the animal. The main components of the system are denoted with red numbers. A constant flow of distilled water is maintained across the proboscis by a peristaltic pump connected with silicone tubing to the rigid plastic tube (1) where the proboscis is to be placed (6). Tastants containing a small amount of taste-free dye are delivered using a pressurized 16-channel perfusion system. The reservoirs containing the tastants are connected to a manifold (2) that is attached to the rigid tube, above the hole where the proboscis is to be placed (5). Compressed air from a pneumatic pump is injected to the perfusion system to rapidly deliver a tastant, with timing controlled by custom software. A color sensor (3) is used to monitor tastant delivery. The sensor is connected to the rigid tube adjacent to the proboscis and below the outlet of the tastant perfusion system. The color sensor voltage signal is amplified by a DC amplifier. The red trace on the inset adjacent to the amplifier illustrates a color signal recorded using custom data acquisition software; the rapid increase and decrease in the signal reflect arrival and washout of the tastant, respectively. The moth's proboscis is placed into a hole (5) located just below the color sensor. A mesh (4) is placed above the hole to ensure that the proboscises of different animals are always positioned in the same location. The other side of the rigid tube is connected to another silicon tube to direct the output into a waste container (7).",

(C) The placement of the Manduca preparation into the set-up is shown. The distal t2/3 of the moth's proboscis are introduced into the hole (5) at the rigid plastic tube (1). The proboscis is secured in place with dental wax and epoxy as shown by the inset. The water input to the rigid tube and its output to a waste container are indicated by the numbers 6 and 7, respectively. The number 2 indicates the tastant manifold output tubing.

    "4. Extracellular Tetrode Recording to Monitor Tastant-evoked Activity from GRNs\nPlace moth preparation on a platform under a stereomicroscope on a vibration-isolating table (Figure 4C).\nPut the distal two-thirds of the moth's proboscis into the rigid tube of the tastant delivery system (Figure 2B). To do this, extend the moth's proboscis and then insert it into the hole of the rigid tube by gently pushing it through with the help of dressing forceps. Seal the proboscis in place with soft dental wax and then a layer of epoxy to avoid leaks (Figure 4C, inlet).\nConnect the saline perfusion line to the head capsule and set the perfusion flow to a constant rate of about 0.04 L/h.\nImmerse a ground electrode (i.e. a chlorided silver wire) in the saline bath (Figure 5A).\nUse a custom-made twisted wire tetrode built following the fabrication procedure described in 30 (4 electrode wires are suggested to achieve well isolated units and to fit into the nerve). Before the experiment, electroplate the electrode following the steps described in 30.\nUse a manual micromanipulator to position the tetrode close to the maxillary nerve. Advance the tetrode until it starts to enter the nerve (Figure 5).\nWait for at least 10 min after placing the tetrode to allow it to stabilize within the nerve before recording.\nAmplify the signal (3000x) and use a band-pass filter set between 0.3-6 kHz. Acquire the signal at a 40 kHz sampling rate using data acquisition software.\nAfter finishing the experiment place the moth preparation into the freezer.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55868/55868fig5.jpg",
