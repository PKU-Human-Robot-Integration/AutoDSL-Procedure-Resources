Establishing a non-saturating enzyme concentration is key for downstream steps when comparing the effect of different peptides on JmjC KDM activity. This is achieved by dilution series of the given KDM from the highest concentration possible to a low or sub nanomolar concentration (e.g., <1–10 nM). In our prototypic example of KDM5A and KDM3A, by dilution series we determined enzyme concentrations yielding non-saturating signal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Determining non-saturating JmjC KDM concentration\n(A and B) Two-fold dilution series of recombinant (A) KDM5A and (B) KDM3A enzymes, observing activity towards H3-K4me3 and H3-K9me2 peptides, respectively. The data represents the average of three luminescent readings and error bars represent the SEM (n=3). Data for KDM5A was previously published (Hoekstra and Biggar, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: To maximize the signal-to-background ratio, we recommend users of this methodology establish optimal conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.) prior to beginning this workflow. This may be done experimentally or by literature search.\nNote: Commercially available Promega Succinate-Glo™ assay reagents are stored at −80°C. Begin thawing reagent components on ice ∼1 h before use. For Acetoacetyl-CoA 100×, specifically, thaw at 22°C–24°C for 5 min before addition to Succinate-GloTM Buffer.\nPlace a white 384-well microplate on a Peltier device and set temperature to 4°C.\nPrepare 2× Reaction Buffer/Peptide Mix.\nAdd 2.5 μL of 2× Reaction Buffer/Peptide Mix to all experimental wells in the 384-well microplate.\nThaw JmjC KDM stock protein on ice.",
    "Perform a 20 μL dilution series (e.g., 4× or 2×) of the JmjC KDM protein in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes on ice in the same buffer used initially for storage (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for an example dilution range).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1526_5.csv\nInitial concentration of purified KDM5A was 20 μM, yielding a final reaction concentration of 10 μM. Concentrations listed are in μM.\nNote: Save at least a 20 μL aliquot of storage buffer for the “no enzyme” control.\nAlternatives: Dilution series may be performed in higher or lower volumes depending on the number of replicate reactions performed.\nSet Peltier device to 23°C.\nAlternatives: Other temperatures for the JmjC KDM reaction may be used (e.g., optimal temperature may be determined prior to this protocol or published in literature).\nTo initiate the reaction, add 2.5 μL of each JmjC KDM dilution to a specific microplate well containing the 2× Reaction Buffer/Peptide Mix (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] shows an example plate layout).\nSet the 384-well microplate on a plate shaker for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 240 × g for 1 min at 23°C.\nNote: For the no enzyme control (NEC), add 2.5 μL of storage buffer containing an absence of JmjC KDM protein.\nAllow the demethylation reaction to occur for 60 min at 23°C.\nAdd 5 μL of Succinate Detection Reagent I to each assay well.\nShake the 384-well microplate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 240 × g for 1 min at 23°C and incubate for 60 min at 23°C.\nNote: The time of JmjC reaction may be adjusted, however, the reaction time used in this step must be kept consistent when performing all downstream JmjC KDM reactions. For example, reactions with KDM3A occurred for 3 h.\nAdd 10 μL of Succinate Detection Reagent II.",
    "Shake the 384-well microplate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nCentrifuge the plate at 240 xg for 1 min at 23°C and incubate for 10 min at 23°C.\nRead the luminescence from each well using a microplate reader.\nCalculate the average luminescence signal across technical replicates.\nFor each condition, subtract the average signal from that of the average of the NEC to account for background luminescence.\nUsing data analysis/graphing software, such as GraphPad Prism, visualize the data to determine non-saturating and linear dose responsive JmjC KDM concentrations (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Choose a concentration of protein within the mid-linear range of relative activity.\nSee Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] if JmjC KDM activity is difficult to observe.\nValidate KDM methyl-state preference\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step aims to validate the methyl-state preference (i.e., mono-, di-, tri-methylation) of the recombinant JmjC KDM for an established substrate. This is important as many JmjC KDMs have been shown to be capable of discriminating between different methyl-states of the same substrate. As the peptide libraries used for this method are synthesized as one methyl-state, this validation should be performed prior to commercially ordering or synthesizing the full peptide permutation library. Given the optimal concentration of the JmjC KDM determined in the previous step, the JmjC KDM activity can be monitored by performed reactions with peptide substrates of different methylation states. For assay validation, it is important to include an unmethylated substrate and a ‘no peptide control’ (NPC) alongside the standard NEC.\nCritical: Some JmjC KDMs can convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate in an appreciable extent in the absence of methylated peptide substrate. As a result, a ‘no peptide control (NPC) is critical to use going forward to assess the true level of relative demethylation activity (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).",
    "Thaw 40 μM wild-type substrate (including null-, mono-, di-, and tri-methyl state peptides) on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1526_6.csv\nRepeat steps 1–3, except using 2× Reaction Buffer (similar to 2× Reaction Buffer/Peptide Mix minus peptide substrate).\nKeep 2× Reaction Buffer on ice for same day use.\nAdd 1.25 μL of 40 μM wild-type peptide substrates, individually, to each experimental well containing 2× Reaction Buffer.\nFor the NPC, use 1.25 μL of 1× PBS.\nNote: If peptides were dissolved in a buffer other than 1× PBS, use the peptide buffer for the NPC.\nThaw JmjC KDM stock protein on ice and dilute to 4× the optimal concentration determined in step 14.\nConsidering the number of experimental conditions requiring enzyme (5 in total), the volume of JmjC KDM needed per reaction (1.25 μL), and the number of replicates (e.g., n=3), make at least 20.63 μL of 2× JmjC KDM (this is 10% excess of the minimum volume needed (18.75 μL)).\nPerform the protein dilution with the JmjC storage buffer.\nSet Peltier device to 23°C (or appropriate constant temperature).\nAdd 1.25 μL of 4× JmjC KDM dilution to all experimental wells, except for the NEC. Add 1.25 μL JmjC KDM storage buffer to the NEC.\nRepeat steps 8–13.\nFor each condition, subtract the signal from that of the NPC to account for demethylation-uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate turnover.\nOptional: Represent methyl-state preference as relative JmjC KDM activity; normalize subtracted luminescent signals to that of the peptide displaying the highest signal. Again, using data analysis/ graphing software visualize the data to represent methyl-state preference (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Validation of JmjC KDM methyl-state preference",
    "(A and B) Methyl-state specificity of (A) KDM5A and (B) KDM3A towards differentially methylated H3-K4 and H3-K9 peptides, respectively. KDM activity towards non-methylated, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated (i.e., me0/1/2/3) peptides at the indicated residues was assessed. Data represents the mean luminescence and standard deviation (n=3) normalized to the max signal. Data for KDM5A was previously published (Hoekstra and Biggar, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nDetermine JmjC KDM substrate preference by permutated peptide substrate (PPS) library\nTiming: 4 h (per mutation position)\nThese steps aim to map JmjC KDM substrate preference by monitoring activity towards all peptides in the PPS library. At this point, all peptides within the library should be methylated according to the preferred methyl-state (e.g., H3-K4me3 and H3-K9me2 for KDM5A and KDM3A, respectively). The experimental set-up is performed in the same manner as the previous section (methyl-state validation), except using permutated peptides alongside the wild-type peptide and reaction controls (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]). In analyzing the data relative to the positive control (wild-type peptide) and negative controls (no peptide and no enzyme controls), one can determine the relative effect of individual amino acid mutations on JmjC KDM activity.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1526_7.csv\nThe following is set up for mutations in one residue position. Each single letter amino acid designation is representative of the amino acid substitution occurring in the mutated peptide substrate.\nNote: To limit variability in the start of reaction time between experimental conditions; it is recommended to assess JmjC KDM activity towards peptides representing one residue position of the PPS library at a time.\nThaw 40 μM peptide stocks for the PPS library position being tested on ice.\nMake fresh 2× Reaction Buffer (e.g., for each residue position, 242 μL of 2× Reaction Buffer is required (22 conditions × 4 replicates × 2.5 μL = 220 μL + 10% extra).",
    "Repeat steps 1–3, using the freshly prepared 2× Reaction Buffer.\nAdd 1.25 μL of 4× (40 μM) peptide, individually, to experimental wells containing 2× Reaction Buffer. For the NPC, use 1.25 μL of 1× PBS.\nNote: Again, if peptides were dissolved in a buffer other than 1× PBS, use that buffer for the NPC.\nCritical: Ensure each run of the experiment contains a reaction condition with a wild-type peptide. All mutation positions have a wild-type peptide. However, if mutation positions are not run in full, a wild-type peptide must be included.\nThaw JmjC KDM stock on ice and dilute to 4× the optimal concentration determined in the previous step in JmjC storage buffer.\nNote: Consider the number of experimental conditions requiring enzyme (e.g., the volume of JmjC KDM needed per reaction well (1.25 μL), and the number of replicates (e.g., n=4), make 115.5 μL of 2× JmjC KDM (this is 10% excess of what is needed; 21 conditions × 4 replicates × 1.25 μL = 105 μL)).\nSet Peltier device to 23°C (or appropriate constant temperature).\nAdd 1.25 μL of 4× JmjC KDM solution to all experimental peptide conditions (wild-type peptide and mutant peptides) and the NPC well. Add 1.25 μL JmjC KDM storage buffer to the NEC well.\nRepeat steps 8–13.\nFor each condition, subtract the average signal of the NPC to account for demethylation-uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate turnover.\nTo assess the relative effect of mutations on JmjC KDM activity; normalize substrate luminescent signals to that of the wild-type peptide.\nNote: Normalization is achieved from dividing the luminescent signals of reactions with experimental peptides by that of the WT peptide. This is critical to gauge the relative effect of individual mutations on enzyme activity.\nRepeat steps 23–32 for each mutation position.",
    "Optional: Represent relative activity data as a heat-map to visualize JmjC KDM substrate preference (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) using basic data analysis software (e.g., Microsoft Excel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representation of KDM substrate preference as a heat-map\n(A and B) Relative activity of recombinant (A) KDM5A and (B) KDM3A were assessed towards permutation libraries of their corresponding canonical substrates of preferred methyl state (i.e., H3-K4me3 and H3-K9me2, respectively). X-axis and y-axis represent the wild-type peptide sequence and amino acid substitutions, respectively. Location of wild-type peptide (i.e., relative activity 1.0) spots are defined by the pink borders.\nJmjC KDM recognition motif generation, substrate prediction, and in vitro validation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe major aim of this step is to use JmjC KDM substrate preference to prioritize peptides to be tested for in vitro KDM activity. Peptide Specificity Analyst (PeSA) software can be used to easily produce a candidate KDM recognition motif (Topcu and Biggar, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). In turn, these candidate recognition motifs can then be used to score and prioritize the methyllysine proteome for candidate substrates.\nDownload and open PeSA software (Topcu and Biggar, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; also available at https://github.com/EmineTopcu/PeSA[href=https://github.com/EmineTopcu/PeSA]).\nSelect “Permutation Array” tab at the menu.\nClick “Load from File” and upload your JmjC KDM quantification matrix.\nNote: The quantification matrix can be uploaded with either the relative activity values or the background subtracted luminescent values. If the latter, normalization to the wild-type luminescent values in each position can be performed within the software to obtain relative activity values. Under “Normalized”, select “Per Row/Column” (see Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Mmc1.xlsx] for an example of the KDM5A quantification matrix).",
    "Note: Experimentally, only the residue positions flanking the methylation site are assessed. However, to maintain the central target lysine within the visualization of the recognition motif; in the quantification matrix one can assign the central methylated K the relative value of “1” and all other mutations in this central position as “0”.\nSet the “Threshold” to the desired the value.\nNote: In this context the “Threshold” defines the minimum level of relative JmjC KDM activity for an amino acid substitution to be included within the candidate recognition motif. Keep in mind that stringency increases with higher threshold values.\nAlternatives: Another threshold value may be used and should be considered when Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] represents KDM5A and KDM3A recognition motifs set at various threshold values (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0).\nObtain the recognition motif under the “motif” tab on the left-hand side of the window.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representation of the screening data as PeSA generated sequence motif\n(A and B) The recognition motifs for (A) KDM5A and (B) KDM3A depict amino acid substitutions maintaining a minimum level relative activity defined by the threshold values on the y-axis.\nScore peptides that possess windows which reflect known methylation sites in the methylproteome, using the PeSA generated candidate recognition motif.\nEach position in the queried sequence which shares an amino acid with the recognition motif contributes a value of 1 to the total score. An example of scoring is provided in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1526_8.csv",
    "Example of motif-based scoring. Example of scoring 9-mer sequences with KDM3A motif (defined by amino acids maintaining at least 100% relative activity). Tolerable amino acids at each position are shown in brackets. Matching and mismatching residues, compared to the motif, are shown in green and red, respectively. PeSA score is defined by the number of matching residues.\nNote: Given the recognition motif produced and Kme position, ensure that the queried windows are of the same length and Kme residue in question is in the correct position. The PeSA score reflects the number of residues in the queried peptide matching those in the recognition motif at their corresponding positions. As a result, the predictions were made based on a 9-residue recognition motif, and therefore, the highest possible score obtainable is a total PeSA score of 9 (i.e., for windows exactly matching the recognition motif) (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nDetermine mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of PeSA scores across all queried peptide sequences.\nTo define high-ranking peptide sequences, determine the PeSA score corresponding to 2 standard deviations above the mean.\nFor KDM5A, using the 0.5 relative activity recognition motif, a PeSA score of 9 reflects high-ranking peptide sequences (μ = 6.6, σ = 1.2) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1526-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Substrates were randomly chosen within their respective classification and KDM5A activity is shown as relative to the H3-K4me3 substrate.",
