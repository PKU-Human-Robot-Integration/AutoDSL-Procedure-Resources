    "Preparation of sucrose gradients (Table 1) (Notes 3 and 4)Table 1. Preparation of sucrose stock solutionsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170125/20170125012128_4850.jpgPrepare stock solutions for 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% sucrose as mentioned in the table and store it at 4 °C until use.Prepare the sucrose gradients a day before the polysome fractionation experiment and pre-cool the SW41Ti rotor and buckets at 4 °C overnight.Using prepared solutions containing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% sucrose (see Table 1), begin by adding 2.2 ml of 10% sucrose gradient to the bottom of the thin-wall ultracentrifuge tube.Underlay each subsequent layer (2.2 ml each of 20%, 30%, 40%, then 50%) using a 9” Pasteur pipet and manual pipettor (Figure 1; Note 1). Leave gradients at 4 °C overnight to allow the gradient to become linear (Figure 2; Notes 6 and 7)Make chase solution (see Recipes), a high-density sucrose solution which will push the sample through the absorbance detector, with a speck of bromophenol blue (BPB) powder added for slight color (optional step to observe the transition between samples and the chase solution) and store at 4 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170125/20170125012218_1867.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of sucrose gradient preparationCytoplasmic lysate preparationAdd 10 µl of 100 mg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) in DMSO to the cells containing 10 ml culture media resulting in 100 µg/ml CHX and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C (Note 2).Remove media and wash the cells three times with ice cold PBS supplemented with 100 µg/ml CHX.Trypsinize for 3 min or long enough for the cells to come off the plate or scrape the cells with cell scraper and transfer the cells to a 15-ml tube using cold PBS with CHX to rinse the plate (Note 8).Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 x g.",
    "Cell pellets can be stored at -80 °C or immediately used for cytoplasmic lysate preparation.Disrupt the cell pellet by pipetting 0.5 to 1.0 ml polysome extraction buffer (PEB) containing 100 µg/ml CHX, 1x protease inhibitors and 1:1,000 dilution of RiboLock RNase inhibitor.Transfer the cell suspension to a 1.7-ml microfuge tube and incubate on ice for 10 min with occasional inverting every two minutes (do not vortex).Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei and debris. Transfer approximately 9/10 of the total volume of the supernatant (cytoplasmic lysate) to a fresh tube.Measure the protein concentration by Bradford assay and/or the total RNA concentration by Nanodrop.This supernatant can also be stored at -80 °C and fractionated another time or proceed to polysome fractionation.Polysome fractionationCarefully layer equal amounts of cytoplasmic lysate (1 ml or less containing 1.0-1.5 mg protein or 100-300 µg RNA) to the top of a 10-50% sucrose gradient. Be sure all tubes are equally balanced.Using a Beckman ultracentrifuge, centrifuge the gradients for 90 min in a SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor at 190,000 x g (~39,000 rpm) at 4 °C with maximum acceleration and brake (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170125/20170125012502_7826.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of polysome fractionationKeep the gradients on ice after centrifugation. To begin, place the gradient onto the fractionating system - the piercing needle will puncture the bottom of the tube.Collect 1 ml/min fractions into 12 tubes per gradient and immediately transfer the fractions to an ice bucket.The 254 nm spectrophotometer within the optical unit of the fractionation system reads the RNA amount in each fraction and plots a chart which displays the polysome profile of the gradient (Figure 3A; Note 5).Analyze the fractions as desired or store the fractions at -80 °C until use.RNA and cDNA preparation from sucrose gradientTake 0.",
    "5 ml of each sucrose fraction in a fresh 1.7-ml tube, and add 0.5 ml TRIzol and 200 µl chloroform.Vortex or shake vigorously for 10 sec and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer 500 µl of the upper layer to a fresh microfuge tube containing 1 ml isopropanol and 2 µl of 15 mg/ml Glycoblue.Precipitate the RNA by incubating overnight at -20 °C followed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and wash pellet once with 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Centrifuge for few seconds at 4 °C to collect the remaining ethanol at the bottom of the tube.Discard the ethanol and air dry RNA pellet for 5-10 min at 25 °C.Dissolve RNA in 12 µl nuclease-free water (Note 9).Use the whole RNA solution for reverse transcription by preparing a 20-µl reaction containing 12 µl of prepared RNA, 1 µl random hexamers, 4 µl 5x RT buffer, 1 µl RiboLock, 1 µl dNTP mix and 1 µl Maxima reverse transcriptase.Mix and centrifuge for a few seconds to settle the reaction mixture at the bottom of the tube.The cDNA synthesis was performed using the thermal cycler set at 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 30 min and 5 min at 85 °C.The cDNA product can be stored at -20 °C or -80 °C, or used immediately for RT-qPCR analysis.RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA distribution over the sucrose gradientDilute the cDNAs (20 µl volume) with nuclease-free water to 1,000 µl final volume.To amplify specific transcripts, prepare the gene-specific forward and reverse primer mix at a final concentration of 1 µM in nuclease-free water.",
    "Use primer sets for mRNAs of interest as well as for 1 or 2 mRNAs encoding housekeeping proteins (e.g., ACTB mRNA or GAPDH mRNA).Prepare 20 µl qPCR reactions in a 384-well plate, add 10 µl 2x SYBR Green PCR mix, 5 µl cDNA, and 5 µl primer mix.Cover the plate with optical adhesive film and vortex at maximum speed for 10 sec to mix the reaction.Centrifuge the plate for 30 sec using Plate Spinner to settle the reactions at the bottom of the wells.Use a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System for qPCR with a cycle set up of 3 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 5 sec at 95 °C plus 20 sec at 60 °C.It is recommended to analyze dissociation curves to verify that the primer set is optimal.Using the cycle threshold (CT) values, the percent (%) distribution for the mRNAs across the gradients can be calculated using the ΔCT method (Tables 2 and 3).Table 2. % of mRNA A distribution over sucrose gradient in control cellsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170125/20170125012833_3518.jpgTable 3. % of mRNA A distribution over sucrose gradient in treated cellsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170125/20170125012922_8819.jpg"
