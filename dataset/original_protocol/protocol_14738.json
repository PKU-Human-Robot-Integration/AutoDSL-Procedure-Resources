    "This protocol is approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University and follows the National Institutes of Health Guideline for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Setup\nPrepare the surgical bed on warming pad connected with heat pump at 37 °C for at least 15 min before the surgery. Place a neck roll using the barrel of 3 ml syringe on the surgical bed. Prepare the anesthesia gas with 2% isoflurane in medical air.\nPrepare autoclaved forceps, scissors, micro needle holders, hemostat, cotton swabs and sutures. Prepare tissue glue and eye ointment.\nSet up the hypoxia system and temperature controllers with heating lamp and rectal probe. Prepare hypoxia gas with 2% isoflurane in 7.5% O2 balanced by 92.5% N2.\nOne hour before surgery, mice are analgesized by subcutaneous injection of a slow-release Meloxicam (4.0 mg/kg).\n2. Transient Cerebral Hypoxia-ischemia (Figure 1B)\nAnesthetize 10-13 week old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 22 to 30 g in the anesthesia induction chamber with 3% isoflurane until the animal is unresponsive to foot squeeze, and then remove the hair on right neck using an electronic shaver.\nPlace mice on the surgical bed connected with 2% isoflurane in medical air at flow rate of 2 L/min. Secure forelimbs stretched out along neck roll at sides using medical tape.\nClean the surgical site for incision with betadine followed by alcohol and then cotton swabs.\nUnder dissecting microscope, make a 0.5 cm right-cervical incision using a straight forceps and a micro scissors about 0.2 cm lateral from midline skin.\nUse a pair of fine serrated forceps to pull apart the fascia and tissue to expose the right common carotid artery (RCCA). Carefully separate the RCCA from the vagal nerve using a pair of fine smooth forceps.",
    "Live knot two precut 5-0 silk suture (releasable) on the RCCA, and then sew up the skin using 4-0 Nylon monofilament suture (Figure 1C).\nApply eye ointment on both eyes to prevent dryness.\nQuickly transfer the mice to hypoxia system and put nose and mouth in face-mask with 2% isoflurane in 7.5% O2 at flow rate of   0.5-1 L/min for 30 min.\n\t\nDuring hypoxia, use temperature controllers with heating lamps to control the rectal temperature at 37.5 ± 0.5 °C. Monitor the respiratory rate at 80-120 breaths/min. The maintenance of the body temperature above 37 °C during the hypoxia is important to create consistent brain infarction. Low respiratory rate usually happens after 20 min hypoxia. Remove the face-mask and allow normal air supply if the respiratory rate drops below to 40. This takes 1-2 min and does not count into the 30 min hypoxia duration.\nAfter hypoxia, transfer mice to a surgical bed and release the two sutures from RCCA. Close the wound using tissue glue, and then return mice to the cage. Exclude the animals if both of two live knots are unexpectedly released after hypoxia.\nMonitor the mice for 5-10 min to recover from hypoxia and anesthesia. Place the wetted food in the cage and return it to animal care facility.\n\tNote: Animals showing mild to severe circling behavior at 24 hr after tHI are correlated with brain infraction. Most animals with seizure symptoms die before the 24 hr timepoint after tHI.\n3. Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging",
    "Note: Although this is not an essential procedure of the tHI model, a two-dimensional laser speckle contrast imaging system16 can be used to characterize the changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during or after transient hypoxia-ischemia. To document the alterations of CBF under tHI, record immediately after the step 2.6. Alternatively, to compare CBF recovery after tHI insult, these procedures can be performed following the step 2.10.\nPlace an anesthetized mouse in the prone position and perform a 1 cm-long midline incision on the scalp with the skull exposed but unopened.\nMonitor CBF in both cerebral hemispheres under a blood flow imager according to manufacturer’s protocol and start recording the cerebral blood flow immediately after the CCAO surgery (step 2.6). Continue for 50 min.\nShow CBF image with arbitrary units in a 16-color palette and analyze in real-time the selected regions using the MoorFLPI software following the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 2).\nAfter recording the CBF image, close the scalp with tissue glue and return the animal to the cage.\n4. tPA Administration\nInject animals at the tail vein with the solvent or 10 mg/kg recombinant tPA (220-300 μl of 1 mg/m tPA) at 0.5, 1, or 4 hr after tCCAo plus hypoxia (Figure 4).\n5. Brain Damage Detection with Several Different Options\nNote: To collect brain samples, euthanize the mice at 1, 4 or 24 hr after tHI.\nPerform quantification of infarct volume by in vivo 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) method at 24 hrs after tHI insult as previous described.17 \nIntraperitoneally inject animals with 1.4 M mannitol solution (~0.1 ml/g body weight) 30 min before transcardial perfusion. Transcardial perfuse mice with PBS followed by 10 ml of 2% TTC.",
    "Remove the brain of animals with surgical instruments after 10 min and place into 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation overnight and section into 1 mm thickness with a vibratome.\nSnap a series of four sectioned brain slides by digital microscope and quantify the infarct volume as the ratio of the infarcted area (white area in the right side) to the area of the undamaged, contralateral hemisphere using the ImageJ software.\nAlternatively, perform thrombosis formation by immunofluorescence at 1 hr after tHI insult.\n\t\nFreeze the fixed brain in O.C.T. compound and section the brains at 12 μm thickness using a cryostat.\nIncubate the brain slide with rabbit anti-fibrinogen antibody (1:100) following by goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluro 488 dye (1:200) to observe the fluorescence on a fluorescent microscope.\nAlternatively, perform vessel obstruction by tail vein injection of 100 µl 2% Evans blue dye at 4 hr after tHI insult.\n\t\nEuthanize the mice and quickly cut head to remove brains into 4% paraformaldehyde after Evans blue injection. Note: It takes 5-10 min for Evans blue circulation with blue color of both fore- and hind limbs.\nSection fixed brains at 100 μm thickness using a sliding microtome and observe the fluorescence using a 680 nm emission filter on a fluorescent microscope.\nSubscription Required.
