Since the synapsin1 gene is located on the X chromosome, the synapsin1CreERT2 of males is passed from their mothers. In order to increase efficiency, it is necessary to increase the number of mice with the appropriate sex and genotype. Young adult mice (2–4 months) are recommended when breeding starts.\nObtain homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females. Following steps a and b shows how to obtain females with homozygous synapsin1CreERT2, which resides X chromosome, from a heterozygous mouse. When you do not have homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females, please refer a and b.\nCross synapsin1CreERT2 knock-in mice with wild-type mice of the opposite sex to obtain both heterozygous or homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females and hemizygous synapsin1CreERT2 males.\nCross a heterozygous synapsin1CreERT2 female and a hemizygous synapsin1CreERT2 male to obtain homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females.\nCross homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females and a heterozygous Sik3flox male mouse to obtain male synapsin1CreERT2; Sik3ex13flox mice.\nCritical: Appropriate regulations and guidelines for mouse experiments must be followed.\nCritical: The synapsin1 gene is located on the X chromosome. Since the synapsin1CreERT2 of male mice is passed from their mothers, if you plan to use male mice for your experiment, heterozygous or homozygous synapsin1CreERT2 females are necessary to obtain hemizygous synapsin1CreERT2 males.\nCheck vaginal plugs every morning during breeding.\nTransfer a pregnant female mouse to a separate cage in the case of polygamous mating.\nCheck daily to see if the female has given birth.\nRecord the date of birth.\nGenotype the pups with Tissue Preparation Solution, Neutralization Solution B, and RED Extract-N-Amp PCR Ready Mix.",
    "Note: To see the effect of SIK3 SLP (exon 13-skipped) allele induction, we compared heterozygous synapsin1CreERT2 males with Sik3ex13flox allele to those without Sik3ex13flox allele (Iwasaki et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nLittermates are recommended as control group because the genetic and environmental conditions can be identical except for the Sik3ex13flox allele.\nNote: Please refer to the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for reagents used in the genotype, and PCR conditions\nWean at around 4 weeks of age.\nTamoxifen dilution\nTiming: 2 days\nTamoxifen is diluted to 20 mg/mL in corn oil. Dilution should be started the day before the first IP injection. Dissolved tamoxifen should be used within 1 month in 4°C.\nCritical: Tamoxifen needs to be handled carefully according to safety data sheet because of the toxicity.\nCover a 15 mL-tube with aluminum foil to protect it from light (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Procedure of dissolving tamoxifen in corn oil\n(A and B) Prepare a tube and cover it with aluminum foil.\n(C) Weigh tamoxifen in the tube prepared tube in (A and B).\n(D) Add warmed corn oil to tamoxifen.\n(E) Tamoxifen in corn oil before overnight incubation.\n(F) Corn oil in which tamoxifen is completely dissolved.\nBring tamoxifen to room temperature in a dark room and heat 5 mL of corn oil to 42°C.\nWeigh 80 mg of tamoxifen in the tube prepared in step 10 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAdd warmed 4 mL of corn oil to the tube and vortex (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nNote: Change the amount of tamoxifen dilution as needed.\nIncubate overnight (≒12 h) at 42°C with shaking.\nVortex several times during overnight incubation.\nAfter incubation, vortex until tamoxifen is completely dissolved (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nStore at 4°C until use.\nCritical: Repeat vortex until no more tamoxifen particle are visible.\nTamoxifen injection during late infancy",
    "Timing: 7 days\nTamoxifen is delivered with IP injection\nDilute tamoxifen stock (20 mg/mL) 2 times with corn oil to 10 mg/mL.\nIntraperitoneally inject 50 μL tamoxifen in corn oil (10 mg/mL) to pups on postnatal days 14, 17, and 20.\nFill a syringe with the tamoxifen solution and remove air in syringe (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. IP injection to P14 mice\n(A) Fill corn oil to syringe.\n(B) Remove air from syringe in plastic bag (to prevent scatter of tamoxifen and be discarded to medical pale).\n(C) Gently pinch pup’s back and keep tail between your fingers.\n(D) Insert the needle about 5 mm to the lower abdomen.\nNote: Because of the high viscosity of corn oil, this step takes several minutes.\nSeparate pups to a new cage.\nGently stretch the pup along your hand by holding the back neck skin and tail (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInsert the needle to the lower abdomen towards the head at a 30° to horizontal. The needle was inserted only 5 mm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nInject 50 μL of tamoxifen in corn oil intraperitoneally.\nPut the pups back to breeding cage.\nNote: This injection procedure is the same as giving an IP injection to an adult mouse.\nNote: It is recommended to fix injection time to avoid varying injection interval which may affect tamoxifen accumulation.\nNote: For histological examination, we sacrificed the mice 7–8 days after the last injection.\nEEG/EMG recording\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nEEG/EMG electrode implantation surgery, EEG/EMG recording and analysis is performed (Iwasaki et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Miyoshi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Here, we show the procedure of EEG/EMG implantation surgery. In our laboratory, EEG signals are recorded from ipsilateral metal pins on left hemisphere, and EMG signals are obtained from neck extensor muscle.\nEEG/EMG electrode implantation",
    "Prepare tools for electrode implantation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and its figure legend).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Tools for EEG/EMG electrode implantation\n(A) Tools for electrode implantation. One side 6-pin header is used as a “cap” for an EEG/EMG electrode after the implantation surgery. The bottom pins of 6-pin header are attached to an EEG/EMG electrode and the top pins are holed with implant holder during surgery.\n(B) Close-up pictures of EEG/EMG electrode.\nPlace an 8–9-week-old mouse in an anesthesia box and anesthetize for 3 min with 4% isoflurane.\nFix the mouse head in a stereotaxic instrument with two ear bars and a nose clamp. (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. EEG/EMG electrode implantation\n(A) Head- fixed mice on stereotaxic apparatus.\n(B) Cranium surface is exposed.\n(C) Drilling 4 holes for EEG electrodes.\n(D) Drilling coordination. Posterior holes locate (x, y) = (± 1.27 mm, just anterior side of lambdoid sutures) and anterior holes locate (x, y) = (± 1.27 mm, 5.03 mm anterior from posterior holes). (E) How to fit electrode implantation to the holder.\n(F) Lower the electrode implantation.\n(G) Fill dental cement between skull surface and electrode implant.\n(H) EMG wires are inserted into neck extensor muscles.\n(I) EMG wires are fixed with dental cement.\n(J) Suture done.\nNote: Stable fixation capable of avoiding movement by drilling is required.\nDecrease isoflurane concentration to 2%.\nNote: Observe respiratory rate and decrease isoflurane concentration if it is unstable or too slow.\nApply Vaseline to the eyes, shave the fur from the top of the head, and disinfect the head skin with 70% ethanol.\nMake a longitudinal incision (2 cm long) along the midline of the scalp.\nOpen the skin with four tissue clamps and clean the cranium surface with a cotton swab (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Adjust the head holder to set bregma and lambda at the same dorsoventral and mediolateral level (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nDrill four holes in the skull for EEG electrodes and clean the skull surface with a cotton swab (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).\nCritical: Do not drill too deep so as not to damage the cerebral cortex. We use the tip of the drill reaching the outer surface of the skull as seen by the surgeon as a guide. But this varies depending on the drill used and needs to be adjusted for each researcher.\nAttach the electrode to the implant holder with long pins (made of a pin header, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) of the 6-pin header (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nLower the electrode pins into the holes under stereotaxic control until reach the four stoppers (small protrusion at the bottom of the implant to contact the skull) of the implant attach on the skull (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nCritical: Do not push the skull with the stopper.\nCritical: Of the four stoppers, at least two on the left side should be attached to the skull for EEG recording.\nCritical: When two stoppers on the left side is not attached to the skull because of displacement in horizontal direction of skull, correct the tilt with screws on the stereotaxic instrument.\nSet the Z axis to zero and heighten the Z axis of the implant to 1.0 mm.\nApply dental cement between the skull and the electrode base (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).\nCritical: Turn off the surgical light as the dental cement is cured by strong light.\nCritical: Make sure that the cement does not contain air when it is filled.\nLower the Z axis of the implant to zero and cure the dental cement with LED light.\nNote: Remove cement adhered to the EMG wires",
    "Cross the two EMG wires and insert them into neck extensor muscles under the fascia (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]H).\nApply dental cement from the base of the wires to the intersection and cure the dental cement with LED light (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I).\nApply two-four stitches using silk thread (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J).\nNote: Make sure there is no gap between the implant and the skin to prevent suture from being broken by the mouse.\nStop the anesthesia and remove the mouse from the stereotaxic instrument.\nRemove the 6-pin header from the implant and then insert a one side 6-pin header (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Mouse after the surgery\n(A) The mouse released from stereotaxic apparatus.

A, anterior; P, posterior; R, right; L, left.\n(C) Recording environment. The tether cable is hanged by a multi-axis counter balanced lever arm.\nNote: Hold the implant, not the mouse head, when removing the 6-pin header and inserting the one side 6-pin header.\nCarefully wipe Vaseline from eyes.\nPlace the mouse in the cage on the heating pad to keep it warm until the mouse starts normal behavior.\nEEG/EMG recording\nAllow the mouse to recover for at least 5 days in a home cage.\nPut the mouse in an anesthesia box (4% isoflurane) and wait until the mouse loses righting reflex. Take the mice from the anesthesia box and quickly remove the cap and attach a tether cable to the mouse.\nAcclimate the mouse to the recording environment for at least 7 days (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B and 7C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1218-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test; 13 mice per group. Data are mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗p<0.001. For more information, please refer to the original paper (Iwasaki et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\n(E) Western blotting of brain homogenates. An antibody specific to ex13 skipping SIK3 detected the protein (asterisks) in tamoxifen administrated synapsin1CreERT2; Sik3ex13flox/+ mice and Sik3Slp/Slp mice (top row). An antibody specific to the exon 13-encoded region detected wild-type SIK3 protein in tamoxifen- or vehicle-administered synapsin1CreERT2; Sik3ex13flox/+ mouse brains, but not in Sik3Slp/Slp mouse brains (middle row). An antibody specific to SIK3 c-terminus detected long isoform of SIK3 (third row). In wild-type brains, there are two major isoforms of SIK3: short isoform (50–75 kDa, top and second row) and long isoform (150–250 kDa, third row) (Park et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). β-tubulin was used as a loading control (bottom row).\nNote: Left side electrodes are used for EEG recording, so the electrode pins with three wires need to be left side (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: We wait at least 14 days from EEG/EMG electrode implantation to EEG/EMG recording.\nObtain and analyze EEG/EMG signaling with LabVIEW and MATLAB.
