Prepare phytohormone and antibiotic stock solutions according to Table S3[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200820/3739 Supplementary file Table (Recipes).docx].Filter sterilize all stock solutions and keep at 4 °C.Notes: Always filter sterilize the stock solutions (filter pore size: 0.2 µm, Consumables 1, 2, 3, 20 and 21 for filter types), do not autoclave! Stock solutions can be stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 months. Do not use stock solutions older than 3 months. Prepare cultivation mediumPrepare cultivation medium according to Table S4-Table S11[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200820/3739 Supplementary file Table (Recipes).docx]. Cultivation medium composition.Notes:  It is very critical to adjust pH properly: always calibrate the pH meter before use (for pH 5.8, use calibration solutions pH 4 and pH 7). Always adjust the pH very precisely: for a medium which e.g., pH 5.8 is needed, accepted pH value is 5.80-5.81. Record the pH values before and after pH adjustment. Always measure the pH at the same medium temperature and record the medium temperature while measuring pH (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233128_6387.jpgFigure 3. pH measuring. A. Recording pH and temperature while preparing medium. B. Detail of the right position of the electrode while recording the pH. C. Temperature and pH recording at the display.pH is measured after all components are added, except for agarose, phytohormones and antibiotics (see Table S4-Table S11 for more details), before autoclaving the medium. It is critical to use short autoclave cycles for autoclaving media: apply a sterilization time of 5 min (!",
    ") at 121 °C (101 kPa) and transfer media to RT as soon as the autoclave has cooled down to 95 °C, do not let media stay longer in the autoclave (Figure 4). Sterilization time varies depending on the amount of medium because the autoclaving process includes additional time for the heating up and cooling down. In this protocol, we prepared medium in 0.5 L bottles, and applied a sterilization time of 5 min at 121 °C (101 kPa), the whole autoclave cycle took 1.5 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233148_5614.jpgFigure 4. Comparison of media autoclaved for 5 min (A) and 20 min (B) at 121 °C (101 kPa). The caramel color is a good indication of over-autoclaved media. Media color should remain almost colorless after autoclaving like show on the left picture.Add phytohormones and antibiotics after autoclaving only when media have cooled to 40-45 °C (always use the Laserliner thermometer to check temperature!). Pour plates under sterile bench (biosafety cabinet), see Table S4 for types of Petri dishes and amount to pour for each medium. Types of Petri dishes are different for different media and it is critical to follow our recommendation. Close the lids only when plates have completely dried and no water condensation is visible on the side of Petri dishes (Figure 5). This is critical because calli prefer to stay dry on the medium, wet calli do not regenerate. But also, do not overdry. Overdried media shrink and form cracks, and due to reduced water content, solute concentrations increase substantially, affecting the sensitive calli and the regeneration process. Plates are wrapped with stretch foil and stored at room temperature and in the dark (Figure 5). Do not refrigerate media. Discard unused plates with solid media after 2 weeks.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233206_7188.jpgFigure 5. Medium drying and storage. A.

    "Pressing until ‘buzzing’ sound can be heard (about 5 ms), leave all other settings as default: 200 Ω, capacitance extender 250 μFD, capacitance 25 μFD.Add 1 ml YEP medium without antibiotics immediately after pulse, mix cells by pipetting up and down using 1 ml pipet tip.Transfer suspension into an autoclaved 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and incubate for 30 min at 28 °C without shaking.Spin cells down for 1 min at 210 x g.Carefully remove supernatant, but leave about 100 μl medium in the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Re-suspend the cells in the remaining medium in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and place 100 μl on a YEP agar plate containing 50 mg/L kanamycin and 20 mg/L rifampicin.Incubate the plates for 2 days at 28 °C in the dark.Conduct colony PCR to select for transformed colonies by checking for the presence of the selection marker gene. In our case, to confirm the presence of the Hpt gene (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase encoding gene), we used the following primers: Hpt_F: 5′-AGCCTGACCTATTGCATCT-3′; Hpt_R: 5′-CATATGAAATCACGCCATGT-3′, amplicon size 200 bp, Tm 55 °C.Select 1-3 positive colonies and inoculate in a glass test tube with 3 ml liquid YEP medium containing 50 mg/L kanamycin and 20 mg/L rifampicin. Grow bacteria at 28 °C in the dark with shaking speed at 200 rpm overnight.Prepare glycerol stock of Hpt positive Agrobacterium cultures by mixing 0.6 ml culture with 0.3 ml 10% glycerol (autoclaved) in 2 ml safe lock microcentrifuge tubes, freeze immediately in liquid N2 and store at -80 °C.Note: In this study we used a GUS reporter construct (pSWEET13:GUSplus) and a GFP reporter construct (pOsUbi:eGFP) (Figure 6) which were kindly provided by Dr. Joon-Seob Eom (Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Kyung Hee University, South Korea) and Dr. Bing Yang (University of Missouri, USA) respectively.",
    "From other experiments, we know that under pSWEET13 and OsUbi promoters, GUS and GFP are expressed at both calli and seedling stages, therefore we used these two constructs for checking transformation efficiency. One can use any other GUS/GFP reporter construct for the same purpose. Optimal is the use of GUS or GFP intron constructs, since Agrobacteria do not splice the intron and thus can not cause false positive calli or regenerate plants (Vancanneyt et al., 1990).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233239_5478.jpgFigure 6. Maps of the two plasmids carrying GUS and GFP reporter genes used in this studyIsolation of the immature embryosHarvest rice immature seeds (8-12 days post-pollination) and place 300-400 seeds in a 50 ml Falcon® tube. It is important to get immature seeds at the right developmental stage. To check for the stage of immature embryos, squeeze immature seeds gently and feel their hardness. Immature seeds should be at the late milky stage at which the endosperm is not completely cellularized yet, see Video 1 for more details. This harvesting step can be done outside of a sterile hood, but all steps below including dehusking, sterilization, isolation of immature embryos are done under sterile condition.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Selection of immature seeds Under sterile condition, wash seeds with 40 ml ethanol 70% for 30 s with hand shaking in a 50 ml Falcon® tube; discard ethanol. Then wash seeds with 40 ml sterile Milli-Q water three times, discard the water.Place immature seeds into a Petri dish layered with moistened sterile filter papers and remove the seed coat (lemma and palea) very carefully under a stereo microscope and in sterile conditions (under laminar flow chamber) with scalpel and forceps (Video 2, Figures 7A-7B). Scalpel and forceps should be sterilized by using for example a glass bead sterilizer.",
    "Tools need to be cooled down to avoid heat damage to immature embryos.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Dehusking of immature seeds Place the immature seeds in sterile conditions in a 50 ml Falcon® tube (once lemma and palea have been removed) to start the sterilization procedure (Figure 7C).Add 40 ml ethanol 70%, under sterile conditions, to the Falcon® tube and shake by hand for 30 s. Discard ethanol. Wash immature seeds with 40 ml sterile Milli-Q water. Discard the water.In a sterile 50 ml Falcon® tube, prepare a mixture of 5 ml commercial bleach Klorix® with 35 ml sterile Milli-Q water [final concentration of NaClO is 28 g/L (0.376 M)].Add the mixture to the 50 ml Falcon® tube containing the immature seeds and shake by hand for 5 min.Discard the Klorix® mixture and rinse the seeds with 40 ml sterile Milli-Q water, repeat the procedure 15 times until all remains of Klorix® are completely washed out.Note: It is very important that Klorix® is washed out completely, because Klorix® can affect the germination of immature embryos. We recommend to rinse the immature embryos in a 50 ml Falcon® tube 15 times with 40 ml sterile Milli-Q water each time. Place immature seeds into a Petri dish with sterile filter paper and carefully isolate immature embryos (IEs) using scalpel and fine forceps under the stereo microscope (Video 3, Figure 7D) in a sterile hood. Be careful and gentle to avoid damaging or wounding the immature embryos!<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Immature embryo isolation Only select undamaged immature embryos with sizes between 1.3-1.8 mm. The immature embryos should be opaque, off-white colored. Transparent immature embryos will not germinate. Place about 50 immature embryos (scutellum face up) on co-cultivation medium (Figure 7E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233301_6463.jpgFigure 7.

Inoculation with Agrobacteria.Transformation and co-cultivationNotes: Generally, we recommend to start with 100 immature embryos for one transformation. Depending on the transformation efficiency, the number of immature embryos as starting materials can be reduced or increased. We recommend to use 12 immature embryos as controls without Agrobacterium inoculation. In the first selection step, 6 control immature embryos will be moved onto selection medium without hygromycin B to check for the regeneration ability. The other 6 control immature embryos will be moved onto selection medium with 30 mg/L hygromycin B to control the effectiveness of hygromycin B selection. These are very important controls, especially when trying to adapt this transformation protocol to other varieties. Hygromycin B concentration, regeneration medium and inoculation time may have to be adapted for other varieties. We also recommend to record all data for each transformation, e.g., date, number of immature embryo as well as any notes (see Table S12[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200820/3739 Supplementary file Table (Recipes).docx] for the template). Strike Agrobacteria (LBA4404 or EHA105) from frozen -80 °C stocks on solid YEP plates containing antibiotics (50 mg/L kanamycin and 20 mg/L rifampicin) two days before infection. Then incubate for two days at 28 °C in the dark.On the day of the transformation, take a 3 mm-size loop of Agrobacterium culture from the YEP plate and suspend in suspension medium (Table S5) in a 50 ml Falcon® tube.Vortex bacterial suspension and adjust to OD600 0.3.",
    "Incubate in dark at 25 °C for 1 h, no shaking needed.Notes: Add acetosyringone just before use and prepare freshly! Dissolve acetosyringone: for 50 ml suspension culture, dissolve 10 mg acetosyringone in 100 μl DMSO and then take 9.81 μl solution to obtain 0.981 mg acetosyringone; no filter sterilization needed. Always adjust OD600 very precisely: recommended values, depending on the spectrometer, are between 0.30 and 0.31. Drop 5 μl Agrobacterium suspension on top of each immature embryo, with scutellum side-up (Figure 7F).Incubate plates with embryos in the presence of Agrobacteria for 7 days at 25 °C in the dark (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233333_7109.jpgFigure 8.

Agrobacterium-infected calli.RestingCheck immature embryos for possible contamination (Figure 9). If immature embryos are contaminated, discard them. If possible, uncontaminated immature embryos in the contaminated plate can be rescued and placed on a separate plate. Otherwise discard the whole plate. Contamination can happen if dehusking or immature embryos isolation was not done carefully enough and embryos were damaged with forceps or scalpel during the process, facilitating contamination with other microorganisms (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233346_4610.jpgFigure 9.

Agrobacterium-inoculated immature embryos without contamination.Place immature embryos without contamination on sterile filter paper and remove shoots with scalpel and forceps. Performing this steps under a stereo-microscope to guarantee complete excision of shoots.No parts of the shoot and rim should be left over, remove everything (Figures 10A and 10B).Remove the brown tissue from calli if there is excess, but be careful not to damage the immature embryos.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233359_9922.jpgFigure 10.

Cleaning immature embryo using two layers of sterile filter paper.Clean the immature embryos by placing them between two layers of sterile filter paper (Figure 10C) and carefully dab off the Agrobacteria. Repeat this procedure at least two times to remove the surplus Agrobacteria.Transfer immature embryos scutellum side-up onto resting medium (16 immature embryos/plate) and incubate for 5 days in growth chamber 1 [30 °C, continuous light, 24/0 day/night photoperiod, with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 200 µmol m-2 s-1 with PPFD-blue of 40 µmol m-2 s-1, PPFD-green of 80 µmol m-2 s-1 and PPFD-red of 70 µmol m-2 s-1] (Figure 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233413_6827.jpgFigure 11.

Agrobacterium-inoculated immature embryos.Notes: Use the stereo microscope to check for the state of the immature embryos (e.g., if there is any contamination), to clean brown tissues and take immature embryos more gently. Do not push immature embryos into the medium, let them stay loosely on top of the medium. Keep immature embryos on the same position when transferring between media (scutellum up-side to the medium). Seal plates with two layers of Micropore 3M tape. SelectionAfter 5 days of resting, remove the brown tissue completely with forceps and a scalpel by scratching or cutting brown tissue off the surface of the immature embryo. Transfer the immature embryos onto the selection medium, containing 30 mg/L hygromycin B (16 calli/plate).

    "The embryogenic calli are small, compact clusters of cells, usually light yellow in color (Figure 13 F). Non-embryogenic calli are usually larger, soft, semi-transparent and yellow or gray loosely- held clusters of cells. The “mother immature embryo” can be kept on the selection medium as a back-up in case the freshly-isolated microcalli do not grow, or more microcalli are needed. For this step, microcalli from different immature embryos are kept separately by dividing the Petri dish into small areas (Figure14 C). The separated microcalli will be considered as independent events.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233500_3715.jpgFigure 14.

If no microcalli is generated after 2nd selection, refresh the selection medium and culture for another 10 days. If after 2-3 additional rounds of selection, no microcalli are produced, discard the immature embryos.

Regenerated plants from Agrobacterium-inoculated calli are putative transformants.If calli have not produced any shoot or only produce small shoots, transfer the calli to freshly prepared plates of regeneration medium (6 calli/plate) every 14 days and incubate at 30 °C in continuous light [24/0 day/night photoperiod, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 200 µmol m-2 s-1 with PPFD-blue of 40 µmol m-2 s-1, PPFD-green of 80 µmol m-2 s-1 and PPFD-red of 70 µmol m-2 s-1], until small plantlets develop (small rice plants regenerated from a callus with at least two leaves and small root system, Figures 16-17).Select 1-3 plantlets from each callus and transfer into a MagentaTM GA-7 vessel containing rooting medium without hygromycin B. Incubate them for 7 days at 27 °C [16/8 day/night photoperiod with photon flux density (PPFD) of 200 µmol m-2 s-1 with PPFD-blue of 30 µmol m-2 s-1, PPFD-green of 70 µmol m-2 s-1 and PPFD-red of 60 µmol m-2 s-1].",
    "At this stage, plantlets regenerated from different calli are considered independent transformation events, therefore taking more than one plantlet as a backup to ensure that all putative events grow vigorously in the rooting step.After 7 days, when plantlets reach the top of the MagentaTM box, place another MagentaTM box on top to create more space for the plants to grow (Figure 17A). Place ‘double’ MagentaTM box in the growth chamber with 27 °C [16/8 day/night photoperiod with photon flux density (PPFD) of 200 µmol m-2 s-1 with PPFD-blue of 30 µmol m-2 s-1, PPFD-green of 70 µmol m-2 s-1 and PPFD-red of 60 µmol m-2 s-1] for another 7 days.Transfer plantlets of approx. 15 cm height into soil by gently washing away excess agarose attached to roots.

    "Seal Petri dishes or MagentaTM GA-7 vessels with two layers of Micropore 3M tape. Since the plantlets were regenerated under continuous light (24/0 day/night photoperiod), we recommend to grow the plantlet for the rooting step under long-day conditions (16/8 day/night photoperiod) to slowly acclimate them to the upcoming short-day conditions in the glasshouse (8/16 day/night photoperiod). Screening for transformed plantsNote: In this protocol, we did not unambiguously determine transformation events. We used plants that had been regenerated in parallel, but without infection by Agrobacteria as controls. In these control plants, we did not observe GUS staining or GFP fluorescence. All transformation events counted here were derived from independent immature embryos (one plant per one transformed immature embryo).Transformation of 100 Komboka immature embryos with GUS-intron reporter construct using two different Agrobacterium strains (EHA105 and LBA4404) resulted in 14 and 31 putative transformants from independent immature embryos, respectively (Table 1). All regenerated plants were tested for GUS activity. All leaves of regenerated plants showed GUS activity (Figures 18A-18B), except control plants which also underwent the whole protocol but without Agrobacterium infection (Figure 18C). Our results might indicate that the LBA4404 strain is more efficient in transforming Komboka when compared to EHA105, however the relative efficiency of different Agrobacterium strains can not be judged without careful quantitative analyses across many independent transformations.Table 1. Apparent transformation efficiency of Komboka using different Agrobacterium strainimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233803_2074.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200901/20200901233830_4732.jpgFigure 18.

Roots of all these 54 plants were GFP positive (Figures 19A-19E).",
    "No GFP fluorescence was observed in uninfected plants (Figure 19F). From 54 GFP positive events, 200 bp GFP gene fragment was amplified by PCR from 48 plants (Figure 20). Full T-DNA insertion, inheritance and copy number remain to be validated.Table 2.

WT: non-infected plant regenerated from tissue culture.Adjusting the protocol for transformation of other rice varietiesTo adapt this protocol for the transformation of other varieties, we recommend to evaluate the efficiency after each step using GUS or GFP intron reporter constructs (Vancanneyt et al., 1990). For example, after co-cultivation, use five calli for GUS staining or GPF screening to test whether the co-cultivation step was successful or whether co-cultivation time needs to be adjusted.  We also recommend to use non-infected immature embryos as controls to check for the effectiveness of hygromycin B selection as well as the regeneration ability on media without hygromycin B (see Note 2, Section E), because hygromycin B sensitivity and regeneration ability may differ among varieties. Hygromycin B concentrations can be adjusted between 5-50 mg/L. Criteria for adjustment include: control immature embryos cannot grow or produce microcalli on hygromycin B containing media (Figures 13, 14, 15).  Another relevant parameter is the stage of immature embryo development, which may differ between varieties; immature seeds should be in the late milky stage (Video 1), typically with a size of 1.3-1.8 mm at about 8-12 days post pollination.",
    "Agrobacterium strains (AGL1, LBA4404, EHA105) can be compared. Also, the number of rounds of selection and rounds of pre-generation steps can be adjusted between 1-3 until microcalli or green spots are produced."
