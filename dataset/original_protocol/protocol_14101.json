    "The study followed guidelines of Capital Medical University (Beijing, P.R China) for the care and use of experimental animals. All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of Capital Medical University in China.\n1. Experimental preparations\nNOTE: Acclimate the female specific pathogen-free Wistar rats (weight: 200 ± 10 g) to the experimental environments for a week before administration (Environmental conditions: light/dark:12h/12h, temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 50 ± 10 %).\nUse a fresh 10 mL of PA/NPSi suspensions (nanosilica Ø:20 ± 5 nm by in situ emulsion polymerization) diluted in normal saline at concentrations of 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 mg/mL, respectively10. Before administration, sonicate the suspensions for 20-30 min and vortex for 10 min in order to prevent nanoparticles aggregation.\nEqually divide a total of 20 rats into four groups: one group for each concentration of PA/NPSi (0, 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 mg/mL).\nTo anesthetize them, place the rats in a closed container with 1.5 mL of ether (99.5%) or any other IACUC approved protocols. After 60-90 s of anesthesia, check for the lack of response to pedal reflex. Ensure that the rats are breathing.\nPut the anesthetized rat on the board and fix its front teeth with a sterilized line of nylon on the board too.\nOpen its mouth and expose its fissure of glottis with the help of a surgical forceps and frontal lens.\nInstill the rats with 0.5 mL of PA/NPSi suspension to each rat's lung for a total of 1 mL using a fine tube with a sterilized blunt needle into the bilateral bronchus.\nPlace the rats on a plastic board in a supine position and let the rats recover slowly in 5-10 min.\n2. Ultrasound examination for pleural effusion",
    "Use an ultrasound system with a linear array transducer (frequency: 8 MHz) to examine rats on days 1, 3, 7 and 1410.\nGive anesthesia (10% chloral hydrate, 0.35 mL/100 g, i.p.) to the rats and check for the lack of pedal reflexes.\nRemove the hair from rats' chest and upper abdomen using an electric shaver. Then place the rat on a mounting plate in a supine position.\nCover the skin with the coated gel, and then place the transducer on the intercostal space and subcostal area to detect the pleural fluid.\n\tNOTE: In order to detect the effusion accurately, the left and the right lateral positions were selected to perform an ultrasound examination.\nPut the rat on a plastic board in a supine position after ultrasound examination and let the rats recover slowly in 10 min.\n3. Chest CT scanning for pleural effusion\nOn days 7 and 14 post-administration, anesthetize the rats with 10% chloral hydrate (i.p). Consider it sufficient depth of anesthesia when the rat does not react to pedal reflexes.\n\tNOTE: Day 7 post-administration is the most appropriate time to observe pleural effusion by CT scanning.\nPlace the rat on a plastic sheet in a prone position and then scan its chest to investigate pleural effusion using a 64-channel CT. Use the following settings: 64 mm x 0.625 mm detector configuration, 120 kV (peak), and 350 mAs.\n4. Collection of pleural effusion and isolation of nanoparticles in the pleural effusion\nAfter chest CT scanning of rats and under anesthesia of chloral hydrate, check the pedal reflex of the rats, shave the hair from abdomen to chest, and then disinfect the skin by iodine.\nBring the rats to the surgical area.",
    "Under anesthesia, quickly cut 1-1.5 cm of the skin and abdominal muscles to the xiphoid along the midline with the intact diaphragm.\nCarefully open the chest and inspect bilateral pleural cavities with the help of tweezers, especially the bilateral costal phrenic angles. Collect 1-2 mL of the light-yellow pleural effusion with a 2 mL sterile syringe.\nOnce done, sacrifice the rats with IACUC approved protocol.\nCentrifuge the pleural effusion in a 2 mL tube for 15 min at 300 x g in order to isolate the nanoparticles.\nUse a drop of the upper layer which is the bright liquid and observe under a transmission electron microscope(TEM,) at an accelerating voltage of 60-80 kV.\nSubscription Required.
