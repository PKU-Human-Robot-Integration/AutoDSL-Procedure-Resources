  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation\nPlace the real-time cell analyzer’s station in a tissue culture incubator set at 37 °C and with 5% CO2. Carry out all cell culture handling and pharmacological treatments in a tissue culture hood under sterile conditions.\nNOTE: Neuronal cell lines requiring different temperature settings compared to standard conditions for culture, should be adjusted accordingly. For weakly adherent cell lines, use coating agents to facilitate the interaction of cells with the gold microelectrodes in the bottom of the wells of the E-Plate 96.\nPrepare 1,000X stock solutions of the pharmacological compounds for cell culture treatment (neuroprotective agents or second messenger pathways inhibitors in the appropriate solvent – dimethylsulfoxide or sterile water) and store them at -20 °C. Use the solvent as vehicle in the following treatments.\nCulture human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (proliferation medium) in cell culture flasks with 175 cm2 surface to density of about 75%. Keep cell passage number within a range (of about 10 passages) to ascertain consistency between experiments in terms of rate of cell proliferation and response to cytotoxicity. Lower passage numbers are preferred.\nWash the adherent SK-N-SH cell layer with PBS, and trypsinize with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 ˚C. Centrifuge the cells at 170 × g for 5 min to remove trypsin. Resuspend the cells in 10 ml proliferation medium. Count the cells with Scepter cell counter and adjust cell number to 300,000 cells/ml by diluting cells with proliferation medium.\n2. Plating and Proliferation of SK-N-SH Cells",
    "Add 100 µl proliferation medium to each well of the E-Plate 96 and leave it for 30 min in the tissue culture hood at RT to equilibrate. Insert the E-Plate 96 in the real-time cell analyzer station in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nStart the real-time cell analyzer software. On the Layout page select the wells included in the experiment and enter in the edit boxes the information about cell type, cell number, names and concentrations of chemical compounds used for cell treatment.\n\tNOTE: For the purposes of this protocol at least 4 replicates are recommended for each treatment.\nOn the Schedule software page determine “Steps” included in the experiment, by selecting the number of sweeps measuring Cell Index and the interval between sweeps for each step. Since Step 1 is predetermined for background measurement, select “Add a step” and set Step 2 to measure the Cell Index every 15 min for 96 hr.\n\tNOTE: For treatments, in which effects with fast kinetics are expected, set sweeps at shorter intervals.\nClick Start to initiate the automatically predetermined Step 1 and measure the background impedance of the media. This value is automatically subtracted by the software at each data point once the cells are added to the wells.\nUse the previously prepared in step 1.5) cell suspension of 300,000 cells/ml in proliferation medium. 30,000 cells/well for cell toxicity/neuroprotection studies and 15,000 cells/well for cell proliferation studies. Take out the E-Plate and add 100 µl cell suspension per well for cell toxicity/neuroprotection studies and add 50 µl cell suspension and 50 µl proliferation medium per well for cell proliferation studies. The number of cells plated per well needs to be optimized for each cell line empirically.",
    "Gently swirl the E-Plate 96 for even plating of the cells. Leave the E-Plate 96 for 30 min in the tissue culture hood at RT to allow the cells settle evenly to the bottom of the wells.\nInsert the E-Plate 96 in the real-time cell analyzer station and start Step 2 on the Schedule page. Monitor Cell Index values throughout the experiment by viewing the cell curves on the Plot page and the raw Cell Index data on the Cell Index page of the software.\n3. Serum Deprivation\n24 hr after plating the cells, pause the experiment, and remove the E-Plate 96 from the real-time cell analyzer station. Dilute second messenger inhibitors from 1,000X stocks with DMEM/F12 serum-free medium – to 200× the final concentration. Treat cells with 1 μl inhibitors of second messenger pathways to be tested for their involvement in neurotoxicity/neuroprotection 30 min before initiating cytotoxicity, to inhibit the respective pathways. Return the E-Plate 96 to the station and resume experimental Cell Index measurements.\nAfter 30 min pause the experiment again. Carefully remove proliferation medium fully from the E-Plate 96 wells with a pipette (or multi-channel pipette), taking care not to disrupt the adherent cell layer by directing the edge of the pipette tip to the corner of the well. Add 200 µl/well of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium (serum deprivation medium). Ensure rapid exchange of cell culture medium to minimize mechanical agitation of the cells.\nDilute compounds to be tested for their neuroprotective effects from 1,000X stock with serum-free DMEM/F12 medium to 200× the final concentration. Add 1 μl compounds to be tested for their neuroprotective effects and 1 μl inhibitors of second messenger pathways in the individual wells according to the experimental plan.",
    "In cells for proliferation studies do not change medium. Dilute compounds to be tested from 1,000X stock to 200× the final concentration in proliferation medium, treat with 1 μl per well and continue to culture in proliferation medium.\nResume the experiment to continue with Cell Index measurements every 15 min for 96 hr as previously set.\n4. Data Analysis\nFor neurotoxicity/neuroprotection data normalize Cell Index to the last time point before pharmacological treatment or medium change to reduce variation between experiments by selecting “normalized Cell Index” and “normalize Time” on the Plot page.\nHighlight the wells on the Plot page for the experimental conditions of interest and click “Add” to plot the normalized Cell Index curves. Observe the kinetics of the neurotoxic/neuroprotective effect, or of second messengers inhibition as normalized Cell Index curves as a function of time.\nObserve the Cell Index curves for the tested drug treatments in proliferation medium as a function of time to assess whether an effect on proliferation is involved in the neuroprotective/neurotoxic effect.\nExport the experimental info for all Cell Index time points from the Cell Index software page into an Excel file to initiate statistical evaluation of the results\n\tNOTE: As an initial step in the statistical analysis a set of modified MATLAB programs that use the Welch's t-test, with the p-value plotted semilogarithmically, utilize inverted axis against the time scale (provided as supplementary code files). These programs allow detection of p-values over the time-course of an entire real-time cell analyzer experiment, and thus aid the selection of time points for more detailed statistical analysis. See the supplementary material for detailed information on the programs.",
    "For statistical analysis of differences in Cell Index values under different treatment conditions at specific time points, select Cell Index values at respective time points from the exported Excel file. Analyze the Cell Index values for the selected time points with one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc test using statistical software.\nSubscription Required.
