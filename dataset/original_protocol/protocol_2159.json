If the autoclaved water has cooled, reheat in the microwave until the bottle is hot to the touch, but water should not boil.\nPartially cap bottle and stir on a hotplate set between medium/high until methylcellulose is in solution (1–4 h).\nIn a tissue culture hood, aliquot cooled 2% methylcellulose into 50 mL conical tubes. Pipette slowly, as the mixture will be viscous. Store at 4°C until further use in the assay, which will require bringing the methylcellulose to room temperature.\nPrepare 5× FFA Staining buffer according to tables found in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]:\nTo 250 mL of 10× PBS, add:\n250 mL of Millipore water.\n2.5 g of Saponin.\nStir until dissolved, then sterile filter and store at 4°C until the day of the assay.\nPrepare 1× FFA Wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100) according to table found in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]:\nTo 9 L of Millipore water, add:\n1 L 10× PBS.\n5 mL Triton X-100.\nPrepare media for carrying BHK-ATCC clone-13 cells (hereafter referred to as growth media):\nTo 500 mL 5% DMEM, add:\n5 mL HEPES solution.\n25 mL Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS).\nStore at 4°C until further use.\nCell plating and titration by focus forming assay\nTiming: Active time: 2–3 h, With incubations: 48–72 h",
    "Quantification of Powassan viral titer by focus forming assay relies on the addition of sample with an unknown quantity of virus to a monolayer of permissive cells (BHKs). This step outlines the plating conditions and titration schema that, in our hands, produces the most reproducible conditions for determining POWV titer. Researchers are encouraged to determine the appropriate cell density and culture conditions for their own cell lines before titrating precious samples. Additionally, this protocol details titration using a 10-fold dilution series, researcher may find it useful to increase or decrease the fold dilution series based on the need for sensitivity for the titration series. This step also outlines the process of adding sample to the cell monolayer, overlaying to minimize lateral spread of infection, and the process of fixing the cells for removal from biological containment.\nThe day before the assay: to a tissue culture treated 96-well plate, add 2.5 × 104 cells per well of BHK-21 ATCC clone-13 cells in 100 μL of growth media per well. Incubate overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nBefore starting the assay, examine cells under a light microscope to ensure you have proper cell confluence the day of the assay (∼90%); BHKs will not form an even monolayer with complete cell-to-cell contact as seen with Vero cells.\nIn a 96-well round bottom plate, prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the sample containing virus by adding 20 μL of sample to 180 μL of growth media. Sample dilutions should be performed in duplicate or triplicate, and at least one column should include a ‘mock’ infected PBS control.\nRemove media from 96-well flat bottom plate containing BHKs. Add 100 μL per well of serially diluted samples in growth media to the 96-well flat bottom plate containing BHKs.",
    "Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h without shaking to allow for virus adsorption.\nDuring incubation, prepare methylcellulose:\nMix one part 2% methylcellulose (see prepare reagents[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]) with one part growth media. Place on a rocker at room temperature with gentle agitation to mix methylcellulose and media.\nAdd 125 μL per well of diluted methylcellulose in growth media to the flat bottom plate containing BHKs and + serially diluted samples. This step will minimize lateral spread of viral infection.\nIncubate 24 h without shaking at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nFollowing incubation, fix the 96-well flat bottom plates as follows:\nPrepare 5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by diluting 20% electron microscopy grade PFA four-fold in 1× PBS.\nFix cells with 5% paraformaldehyde by adding 50 μL per well and incubate at room temperature for 30–60 min.\nWash cells gently three times with 150 μL per well of 1× PBS.\nAdd 150 μL per well of 1× FFA Wash buffer and let sit for 5–10 min at room temperature.\nRemove plates from BSL-3 containment and proceed to immunostaining.\nImmunostaining\nTiming: Active time: 2–3 h, With incubations: 8–24 h\nAfter cells have been fixed, individual foci must be visualized following an immunostaining protocol that relies on the detection of viral antigen in the cells. This step outlines the immunostaining protocol that, in our hands, allows the researcher to visualize foci with minimal background.\nPrepare 1× FFA Staining buffer by diluting 5× FFA Staining buffer five-fold in Millipore water. 5× FFA Staining buffer should be handled aseptically.\nRemove Wash buffer and add primary antibody (e.g., Monoclonal Anti-Langat Virus Envelope Glycoprotein (E), Clone 10F6) that has been diluted 3:10,000 in 1× FFA Staining buffer (50 μL per well).\nIncubate at room temperature for 1.5–2 h with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker, or overnight at 4°C without shaking.",
    "Wash three times with 1× FFA Wash buffer (150 μL per well).\nRemove Wash buffer and add secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse conjugated to HRP) that has been diluted 1:5,000 in 1× FFA Staining buffer (50 μL per well).\nIncubate at room temperature for 2–3 h.\nWash three times with 1× FFA Wash buffer (150 μL per well).\nRemove Wash buffer; add Trueblue substrate (50 μL per well) and incubate 15–20 min without shaking, in the dark, or until spots are fully defined with minimal background.\nFlick off substrate and wash twice with 200 μL/well of cool Millipore water to quench the reaction. The reaction should not be quenched with hot (>37°C) water.\nTap on a paper towel to remove water and count or image within 15–30 min of quenching for best counting results.\nImaging (optional)\nTiming: Active time: 15–60 min, With computer/software run time: 30–120 min\nAfter immunostaining, individual foci should be visible wells. While POWV titer can be calculated manually by counting under a dissecting microscope, we have found that the high-throughput nature of the 96-well plate format is more suitable for automated counting. For this purpose, we utilize an ImmunoSpot S6 FluoroCore M2 analyzer, hereafter referred to as a CTL Elispot machine. The steps below outline the parameters on a CTL Immunospot analyzer that, in our hands, produce the most rapid and accurate foci counts.\nTurn on both the computer and CTL machine.\nOpen the CTL Switchboard and select the ‘Scan’ function.\nSelect ‘Full plate scan’.\nUnder ‘Dashboard’, ensure the correct filepath and plate setting.\nThe ’96 well BD Falcon’ setting can be used for most FFAs.\nLoad and name the plate.\nStart the scan, confirm that the CTL machine can correctly identify the A1, A12, and H1 wells, and allow the images to be collected.",
    "After the scan has completed, return to the CTL Switchboard.\nSelect the ‘Count’ function.\nSelect ‘SmartCount’.\nFind the file folder containing the plate that was just scanned/imaged and load the plate(s) into the autocount queue.\nSelect a few wells with clear, distinct foci. Adjust the parameters of the spot count, giving special consideration to the appropriate gate size, background balance, and spot separation to yield an accurate count.\nIt may be necessary to adjust parameters using a manually counted well or series of wells.\nOnce the appropriate parameters are selected, start the autocount.\nAfter the autocount has completed, return to the CTL Switchboard.\nSelect the ‘Quality Control’ Function.\nFind the file folder containing the plate that was just counted and load the plate(s) into the quality queue.\nQuality control functions of the CTL Elispot should be used to manually correct aberrant counts, remove false spots/hits, and, if necessary, re-count wells with different parameters.\nParameters should be determined/adjusted in the same manner as the original autocount.\nTitration should be based on wells with individually discernable foci."
