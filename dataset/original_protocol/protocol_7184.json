    "Cell isolationPour 12 mL of PBS in a 10 cm dish on ice.Pre-warm TrypLE to 37°C.Euthanize a pregnant mouse (E10.5) via methods approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), such as inhalation of CO2 followed by thoracotomy.Harvest the uterus and place it in ice-cold PBS (Figure 1).Harvest embryos from the uterus and keep them in ice-cold PBS (Figure 1, Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4371/bioprotoc-12-07-4371-g001.jpgFigure 1. Harvest embryos from a pregnant mouse. (A–C). A pregnant mouse was euthanized with CO2. The skin was cut with a pair of scissors, and a uterus with embryos (arrowheads) was exposed by pushing the digestive tract upward anteriorly. (D). The uterus was cut with a pair of scissors, by following the dotted arrows (top to bottom). (E). A tweezer was inserted as per the arrow, to separate the uterine wall from the embryo. (F–I). Embryos were carefully removed from the placenta, the yolk sac, and the amnion. Scale bars: 1 mm.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Harvest an E10.5 embryo from the uterus.  An embryo is located at the light red area of the isolated uterus (Figure 1E, upper part), and the placenta is located at the dark red area (Figure 1E, lower part). A tweezer will be carefully inserted from one of the cut sites of the separated uterus. The uterine wall will be carefully removed to harvest an embryo with yolk sac. Subsequently, the yolk sac and the amnion will be removed as shown in Figure 1H–I.Isolate the BA1 (Figure 2, Video 2), and place them into 1.5 mL tubes with 100 µL of ice-cold PBS (one BA1 to a tube).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4371/bioprotoc-12-07-4371-g002.jpgFigure 2. Harvest the first branchial arch from embryo. (A). Embryos were divided into the head and the trunk. A tweezer was inserted between BA1 and BA2, as following the arrow. (B, C).",
    "The BA1 was divided from the MA with a tweezer, as following the arrow in B, and the isolated BA1 was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. MA; maxillary arch, BA1; first branchial arch, BA2; second branchial arch. Scale bars: 1 mm.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Harvest the BA1 from an embryo.  The trunk of an embryo is gently pressed down with a tweezer, and another tweezer is inserted between the BA1 and the BA2. The head is then gently pressed down with a tweezer, and the BA1 is separated from the head.Centrifuge at 100 × g and room temperature (RT) for 5 min.Remove supernatant, then add pre-warmed 100 µL of TrypLE to the 1.5 mL tube.Incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min. Gently pipette up and down with wide bore 1,000 µL tips.Add 900 µL of 10% FBS in Advanced DMEM, then gently pipette 5–10 times.Centrifuge at 100 × g and RT for 5 min, then discard supernatant.Resuspend the cells with 500 µL of PBS.Centrifuge at 100 × g and RT for 5 min, then discard supernatant.Resuspend with 150 µL of PBS.Filter the cells through a 40 µm cell strainer.Take 10 µL of cell suspension into 1.5 mL tube, and mix with 10 µL of Trypan blue, to assess cell viability.Micromass cultureDilute the fibronectin stock solution with 10% FBS in Advanced DMEM, to prepare 100 µg/mL fibronectin solution.Resuspend the cells with 100 µg/mL fibronectin solution (5 × 105 cells/100 µL).Seed 20 µL of cells onto a 35 mm dish.Incubate at 37°C for 1.5 h, to allow them to attach to well.Add 1 mL of Advanced DMEM including 10 µg/mL Fibronectin and 10% FBS in Advanced DMEM.Incubate at 37°C for 24 h.Remove media, then add 2 mL of 4% FBS in Advanced DMEM/Ham's F-12.Culture for 5 days.",
    "Measure chondrogenic differentiation by Alcian blue staining (Figure 3 and part C), and set up a qRT-PCR to determine the levels of chondrogenic marker genes, such as Sox9 and type 2 collagen (Yang et al., 2021).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4371/bioprotoc-12-07-4371-g003.jpgFigure 3. Observation of primary cranial NCCs in vitro.  (A). Harvested primary cranial NCCs from BA1 are shown. The morphology of the cranial NCCs from BA1 is close to O9-1 cells (Ishii et al., 2012), a neural crest stem cell line. (B). Micromass culture for cranial NCCs from control and caAcvr1; P0-Cre mice embryos was performed. Cells were stained with Alcian blue. Scale bars (A) 100 µm and (B) 1 mm.Alcian Blue staining for micromass cultureAspirate medium from micromass culture.Fix with 1mL of Bouin’s fixative at RT for 15 min.Wash with Solution A (see Recipes).Wash with Solution B (see Recipes).Stain with 2 mL of 1 mg/mL Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid (see Recipes) at RT for 1 h.Wash dye off with double distilled water (ddH2O) four times.Keep in 2 mL of ddH2O.Take photos.Wash dye off with ddH2O.Extract the dye by incubating cultures with 1 mL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (see Recipes) at RT overnight.Measure the optical density at OD595 using a spectrophotometer, such as the Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash Spectral Scanning Multimode Reade."
