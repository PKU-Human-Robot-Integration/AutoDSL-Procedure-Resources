    "The saliva collection protocol described herein was reviewed by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research.\nNOTE: With regard to institutional reviews for human subject work of this type, prior arrangements and permissions should be garnered from the host institution. In particular, depending on the institution, IRB or ethics approval might need to be sought and approved before saliva collection from human volunteers can proceed. As an aid to preparing an application, a useful NIH algorithm/chart can be found here: http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/PrivateInfoOrBioSpecimensDecisionChart.pdf[href=http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/PrivateInfoOrBioSpecimensDecisionChart.pdf]\n1. Preparation of Pooled Saliva for Use as an Environmentally Germane Growth Medium\nRecruit >5 individuals for saliva donation. Do not take any identifying information, ensure no individuals will donate saliva if they are ill, or have taken oral antibiotics in the past 3 months, or have consumed food or liquid, with the exception of water, in the previous 2 hr before donation.\nCollect saliva in 50 ml plastic tubes. Pool the collected saliva in a plastic beaker, keeping it on ice. Do not use glass as polymers in the saliva will adhere to the internal glass surfaces.\nAdd Dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 2.5 mM from a 100x stock. (Stock is frozen in single-use aliquots at –20 °C). Stir for 10 min in a plastic beaker on ice.\nIn order to remove particulate matter, centrifuge the pooled saliva for 30 min at 17,500 x g.\nDilute the saliva with 3 volumes of dH2O to give one-fourth concentrated saliva.\nFilter-sterilize saliva using 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES), low protein binding filter. Use filter with large surface area, or use several small area filters. Keep saliva in a plastic container on ice while filtering.",
    "Freeze the pooled saliva at –80 °C in 50 ml plastic tubes until needed to grow bacteria. Each plastic tube is for one use only and should contain no more than 35 ml as each microfluidic well holds a maximum of 1.2 ml (1.2 ml x 24 wells = 28.8 ml) and space is needed in each tube as saliva expands during freezing.\nFor use, thaw the pooled saliva at room temperature. Once thawed, filter-sterilize once more (0.22 µm polyethersulfone, low protein binding filter to remove any precipitates).\n2. Preparation of Pooled Saliva for Use as an Inoculum\nRecruit >5 individuals for saliva donation. Do not take any identifying information, ensure no individuals will donate saliva if they are ill, have taken oral antibiotics in the past 3 months, or have consumed food or liquid, with the exception of water, in the previous 2 hr before donation. Collect samples over 30 min.\nCollect saliva in 50 ml plastic tubes at room temperature and pool the collected saliva in a plastic beaker at room temperature.\nDilute pooled saliva with autoclaved general reagent grade glycerol to yield a stock with a final ratio of 25% glycerol, 75% cell-containing saliva [CCS].\nFreeze saliva at –80 °C in 3 ml single-use aliquots until needed.\nWhen required to inoculate the microfluidic system, aliquots are thawed at room temperature and agitated gently on a vortexer for 5 sec before being pipetted into the microfluidic system as described in step 3 of the protocol, below.\n3. Growth of Oral Multi-species Biofilms\nCFS pre-treatment\nFirst coat the Bioflux microfluidic channels with CFS. Add 100 µl of CFS to each outlet well. Using the Bioflux control software, select “manual” and set flow from channels “B1-B24” that are to be used.",
    "Next, set shear to 1.0 dyne/cm² and start flow for 2 min at room temperature to ensure homogenous distribution of the CFS throughout the channel. Ensure there is fluid in each inlet channel to verify that CFS flowed through all channels evenly.\nIncubate plate at room temperature for 20 min.\nRemove the CFS/pretreat solution that remains in the outlet wells and transfer to the inlet wells. This total volume of 100 µl will serve to balance against the pressure being applied to the inoculum from the outlet well.\nInoculation\nTo each outlet well, add 100 µl of CCS inoculum. Place the microfluidic plate on the heat plate (temperature set at 37 °C), select manual within the control software, and set flow from outlet wells to the inlet wells (i.e., reverse) at 1.0 dyne/cm² for exactly 6 sec.\nIncubate the microfluidic plate at 37 °C for 40 min to allow for initial adherence and growth of the bacteria in the inoculum.\nOvernight Growth\nFor the inoculated channels being used, aspirate the waste inoculum from each of the outlet wells. Add up to 1 ml total volume of CFS into each of the inlet wells (can be done on top of existing CFS).\nIncubate the microfluidic plate at 37 °C, select manual and set the program to run at 0.2 dyne/cm² for 20 hr.\nStain prewash\nAspirate all fluid from the inlet and outlet wells and add 100 µl of PBS (pH 7.4) to each of the inlet wells. Flow for 20 min at 0.2 dyne/cm².\nStain mixture addition",
    "For cell viability staining make 100 µl of stain mixture for each channel to be stained. Specifically, add 3 µl of SYTO 9 and 3 µl of propidium iodide per ml of PBS using commercial cell viability staining kit such as LIVE/DEAD. This generates a staining mixture containing 10 µM SYTO 9 and 60 µM propidium iodide.\nAspirate the remaining PBS from the inlet wells and then add 100 µl of the cell viability stain mixture to each inlet well. Set to flow at 0.2 dyne/cm2 and run the solution from inlet to outlet for 45 min at room temperature.\nPost-staining wash\nAspirate the remaining stain in each of the inlet wells and add 100 µl of PBS to each inlet well. Set to flow at 0.2 dyne/cm² and run the PBS solution from inlet to outlet for 20 min at room temperature to remove any excess stain.\n4. Image Collection, 3D Rendering, and Image Analysis\nUse an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) to collect biofilm image data from the microfluidic system. Make sure that the CLSM is able to withstand the weight of the Bioflux plate, which can reach 150 g.\n\tNOTE: Given the dimensions of the microfluidic channels, the need for sensitivity to discern biofilm structure, and the requirements to detect fluorescence signal of varying intensity, fit the CLSM with a 40X 1.25 NA objective lens or one with similar optical quality, magnification, and numerical aperture.\nStandardize the emission capture gates with gain and offset measurements being kept constant. Ensure that the laser power does not exceed 25% as this can result in photo-bleaching.",
    "Convert CLSM files from the Leica Image File type (LIF) to OME (Open Microscopy Environment) file type. This allows for greater ease of access and compatibility between software programs. Use commercially available software such as, IMARIS to convert files to this type.\n3D Rendering for Images/Figures\nOnce converted to OME format, use commercially available software such as IMARIS to render the images in 3D. Perform this using a combination of “Easy3D” and “Surpass” options.\n\tNOTE: Attention to background signal and thresholding should be made. The histogram function in IMARIS can be used to obtain the collection range and this should be kept constant between images being analyzed.\nSave images using the “snapshot” function and make careful consideration to image resolution before saving file types.\nAssemble images into figures using image editing software such as CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator.\n3D Image Analysis for Graphs and Tables\nUse freely available IMAGEJ 23 and COMSTAT/COMSTAT2 38 for image analysis. Download the packages from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ and http://comstat.dk/, respectively. Have the most recent Java update installed.\n\tNOTE: The software platform JAVA will need to be installed prior to the use of the image analysis software.\n\t\nUse the IMAGEJ software with COMSTAT2 plugin to import the OME files for each biofilm image in “hyperstack” mode and view with “split channels”.\nIndividually analyze the two channels (red/propidium-iodide/dead being channel 0, green/SYTO-9/LIVE being channel 1) using the “histogram” function of IMAGEJ. This function lists the total number of pixels of 8-bit OME files (shown as “count”) at each color intensity from 0 to 255 (shown as “value”), with 0 being pixels with no signal (background) and 255 being pixels with complete signal saturation.",
    "Export the data into a spreadsheet program and standardize all signal values by weighting each pixel by the corresponding signal intensity. This is performed by multiplying the total count at a given signal intensity by the numerical 8-bit value (0-255) of that signal intensity.\nSum all weighted values, 0-255, for both channels for each biofilm image captured. Take the sum of the weighted values for both channels to determine the percent total signal from either channel. Do this to determine the relative ratio or percent red and percent green signal (i.e. the percent “DEAD” and percent “LIVE” for each treatment).\nPerform statistical analyses, for example using two-tailed Student's T-test modified for unequal variance. Values of p <0.05 are considered significant and those values of p <0.01 are considered highly significant.\n5. Harvesting Biofilm Cells for Culture-independent Analysis\nRemove all spent and unused saliva from inlet and outlet wells. Wash the wells with 1 ml sterile distilled water three times.\nAdd 100 µl of sterile distilled water to the inlet wells and, using the software control interface, pass the sterile distilled water forward through the channels at >8.0 dyne/cm2 (flow rate >745 µl/hr, shear of 800 sec-1) for at least 5 min. Repeat in the reverse direction for at least 5 min and then repeat the forward and reverse washing step process.\nCheck by light or by epifluorescence microscopy (if cells were stained/labeled) for thorough biofilm removal (Figure 2). Collect the 100 µl cell-suspension and store at -80 °C for culture-independent analysis. A cost-effective analysis of community composition can be achieved through using bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) using the approach described in Nance et al. 20\nSubscription Required.
