    "​All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) of Tsinghua University and performed in accordance with guidelines of the IACUC. The laboratory animal facility at Tsinghua University has been accredited by the AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International). For staging of embryos, mid-day of the vaginal plug identified was calculated as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\nNOTE: All cells are cultured in the cell incubator under conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n1. Preparation of Mouse Endothelial Culture in Permeable Support Inserts\nNOTE: BEND3 cells are maintained according to manufacturer's instructions.\nPrepare BEND3 cell medium (BM) by adding 50 mL of FBS and 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin into 500 mL of DMEM and mix well.\nAspirate the medium from the dish and wash the BEND3 cells culture with 1 mL of PBS once. Add 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA into the cells and incubate the cells for 4 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of BM into the cells to neutralize Trypsin-EDTA and pipette up and down gently to completely dissociate the cells.

Aspirate the supernatant from the tube and wash the cell pellet with pre-chilled DMEM. Repeat this step once.\nNOTE: During the digestion and washing, take caution not to pipette the tissues and cell pellet roughly to avoid damaging the cells with a strong shearing force.\nAspirate the supernatant from the tube then add 1.5 mL of pre-chilled HBSS into the tube. Dissociate the cortical cell pellet into single cells with gentle pipetting. Count the cell number with a hemocytometer.",
