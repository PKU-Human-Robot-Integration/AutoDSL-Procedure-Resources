    "Expression and purification of His-carbamoyltransferase proteinimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4496/bioprotoc-12-17-4496-g001.jpgFigure 1. Major steps for expression and purification of protein. Transform 50 μL of competent DH5-alpha cells with 10–50 ng of pET28-Kan-his-CT plasmid (follow the manufacturer protocol) and spread 20–30 μL on an agar LB plate containing 40 μg/mL kanamycin. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.Inoculate 10–50 mL of LB medium containing 40 μg/mL kanamycin in a bacteria culture tube or shaking flask with a single colony from the plate. Grow overnight at 37 °C while shaking at 250 rpm.Optional: Verify the integrity of the insert by sanger sequencing.In the next morning, inoculate 1 L of LB medium containing 40 μg/mL kanamycin in a shaking flask with 10–25 mL overnight culture (roughly 1:40 to 1:100 ratio). Grow the cells at 37 °C while shaking at 250 rpm until OD600nm reaches 0.6. Save 1–2 mL cell culture as un-induced control. Pellet the 1–2 mL cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 10,000 × g and freeze in -20 °C for short-term storage.Note: This step may take several hours. Check OD600nm every 1–1.5 h in the first few hours and then more frequently. Be aware that the cells grow fast in log phase and the OD600nm can increase rapidly when near 0.6. Transfer the cells to a shaker pre-chilled to 16 °C and let it sit for 20 min to cool down the cell culture.Note: This step is performed to guarantee that carbamoyltransferase protein expression is induced at its optimal temperature (~16 °C). Add IPTG at 0.4 mM (stock concentration is 0.4 M, 1,000×) and 1 μM iron II (stock concentration is 500 μM, 500×) to the culture, and continue growth at 16 °C while shaking at 250 rpm for ~24 h.",
    "Carbamoyltransferase protein expression is confirmed in step A6, before the entire 1 L volume of culture is processed in step A7.Note: Iron (ii) is added to facilitate protein folding. Check protein expression with SDS-PAGE gel.Harvest 1 mL culture, and pellet cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 10,000 × g.Note: The purpose of taking 1 mL from the 1 L culture is for the confirmation of protein expression before the entire 1 L culture is harvested and processed. Note that this 1 mL culture is induced, and the 1 mL control culture taken in step A3 is un-induced. Resuspend the pellet and un-induced cell pellets (saved in step A3) in 1 mL cell lysis buffer.Lyse the cells in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice with 3–5 cycles of 20 s on/20 s off pulses using sonicator with a microtip. 10 μL is saved as crude lysate. The rest of the volume (1 mL – 10 μL = 990 μL) is used in step A6d.Pellet the inclusion bodies by centrifuging the sonicated cell suspension at full speed for 10 min at 4°C, and transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Mix 10 μL crude lysate taken in step A6c, 10 μL nuclease-free water, and 10 μL blue protein loading dye (3× with reducing reagent added) to get a final volume of 30 μL.Mix 10 μL of soluble samples (supernatant from step A6d), 10 μL of nuclease-free water, and 10 μL of blue protein loading dye (3× with reducing reagent added) to get a final volume of 30 μL.Heat samples from steps 6Ae and 6Af at 95 °C for 5 min.Assemble the SDS-PAGE gel and gel running apparatus, fill with 1× running buffer, load the samples and protein ladder, and run gel at 150 V for approximately 1 h.",
    "Stain the gel with SimplyBlue staining reagent, take picture of the gel, and confirm expression of carbamoyltransferase protein in crude lysate and soluble portion.Note: The estimated size of carbamoyltransferase enzyme is 63kDa. Presence of protein in soluble lysate should be confirmed before large-scale purification in the next step. Harvest cells from 1 L cell culture from step A5 by centrifuging for 15 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C.Cell resuspension and sonication:Directly resuspend cell pellet in 30 mL of HisTrap buffer A (or 4 mL buffer per gram of pellet).Sonicate the cells on ice with 5 s on/5 s off pulses for 30–40 cycles. Set power to max level.Note: The number of cycles needed for complete disruption of cells depends on the model of sonicator. It is suggested to do a pre-test to determine the best sonication condition before performing the actual experiment. Centrifuge the sonicated cell suspension for 30 min at 23,000 × g at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant (~30 mL) and mix with equal volume of HisTrap buffer A for loading to the AKTA purifier. Add the appropriate volume of 1M PMSF to a final concentration of 0.4 mM to prevent protein degradation.Note: Save 0.1 mL sample as before purification control. Here, the total loading volume is about 60 mL, and the suggested loading volume range is between 50 and 100 mL. First purification using HisTrap HP 5 mL column on AKTA.Equilibrate the column with 10 column volume (CV) of HisTrap buffer A.Load sample at 2 mL/min.Wash out unbound proteins of the column using 10× CV HisTrap buffer A.Elute protein using a linear gradient from 0%–100% HisTrap buffer B for a total of 10× CV. Set fraction volume to collect 2 mL per fraction tube.",
    "Check purified proteins in each fraction by adding 5 μL of sample with 15 μL of nuclease-free water and 10 μL of blue protein loading dye (3×, reducing agent added) to get a final volume of 30 μL.Heat samples at 95 °C for 5 min.Load the samples and run SDS-PAGE gel (see Figure 2 for example of protein purification with HisTrap column).Stain the gel with SimplyBlue staining reagent, and take picture of the gel.Pool fractions with concentrated proteins.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4496/bioprotoc-12-17-4496-g002.jpgFigure 2. Stained SDS-PAGE gel with samples from the purification with HisTrap column. Arrow marks band of carbamoyltransferase expression at 63 kDa. For this particular example, we pooled fraction 12–18.Second purification using HiTrap Q column on AKTA.Mix pooled fractions with 7× volume of dilution buffer so that the final salt concentration is approximately 50 mM.Equilibrate the column with 10 column volume (CV) of Q buffer A.Load sample at 3 mL/min.Wash out unbound proteins of the column using 10× CV Q buffer A.Elute protein using a linear gradient from 0%–100% Q buffer B for a total of 10× CV. Set fraction volume to collect 2 mL per fraction tube.Check purified proteins in each fraction by adding 5 μL of sample with 15 μL of nuclease-free water and 10 μL of blue protein loading dye (3×, reducing agent added) to get final volume of 30 μL.Heat samples at 95 °C for 5 min.Load the samples and run SDS-PAGE gel (see Figure 3 for example of protein purification with HiTrap Q column).Stain the gel with SimplyBlue staining reagent (following manufacturer instructions), and take picture of the gel.Pool fractions with concentrated proteins.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4496/bioprotoc-12-17-4496-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Transfer purified protein to a dialysis tubing bag (MWCO: 6–8 kD). Dialyze overnight against dialysis buffer at 4 °C.Carefully transfer samples from dialysis tubing bag and determine concentration of purified carbamoyltransferase using the Bradford protein assay kit (following manufacturer instructions).Aliquot purified carbamoyltransferase into 50 μL per microcentrifuge tube and store at -20 °C.dsDNA enzymatic assayDNA denaturation: 5-hydroxymethylcytosine carbamoyltransferase has a preference for ssDNA; therefore, it is critical to denature dsDNA to ssDNA for optimal conversion.Prepare 1–2 μg genomic DNA in 5 μL of nuclease-free water or TE buffer in PCR tubeNote: The reaction with T4gt genomic DNA (containing 90–90% 5hmC) is shown as example. Heat to denature dsDNA in a thermal cycler set at 95 °C for 10 min.Immediately transfer the tube into an ice bath to avoid re-annealing.Critical:  DNA denaturation is a reversible process. When the temperature is cooled down slowly, denatured ssDNA will anneal again. Thus, it is critical to transfer the heated sample and immediately embed the tube completely in the ice bath. Add reaction mix (see Table 1) to denatured DNA sample, keep the tube on ice, and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down for 10 times.Table 1. Reaction mix for dsDNA modification  table:",
