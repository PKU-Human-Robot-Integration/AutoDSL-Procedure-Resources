    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal perfusion and brain sectioning\nTiming: 2 days\nThe goal of this step is to fix the brain to preserve the structures of brains and organelles. High-quality perfusion is crucial for obtaining high-resolution electron micrographs. After perfusion, the brain is removed and cut with a vibratome into brain sections, which will be utilized in a later step to obtain ultrathin sections for EM. Care is taken during handling brain sections to avoid tissue damage.\nAnimal perfusion\nConduct perfusion in a chemical fume hood. Use the perfusion buffer (0.1 M PB containing 10 units/mL heparin) and the fixative (4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB) at warm room temperature (23°C–37°C).\nTranscardially perfuse mice and extract the brains with a standard protocol. First, anesthetize mice with isoflurane and then inject them intraperitoneally with ketamine (110 mg/kg) and xylazine (7 mg/kg).\nWait until adequate anesthesia is achieved as determined by loss of response to toe pinching. Place the mouse on a shallow tray.\nMake a small incision in the diaphragm beneath the rib cage using a pair of iris scissors.\nCut the diaphragm along the entire length of the rib cage to expose the pleural cavity.\nNote: Take care to avoid damaging the liver and the heart.\nInsert a blunt tip needle into the left ventricle of the heart.\nUse a hemostat to clamp the heart to secure the needle and prevent leakage.\nCut open the right atrium with a pair of iris scissors.\nAttach the needle base to a three-way valve connected to two 50-mL syringes, each containing 0.1 M PB with heparin or fixative.\nTurn the valve to open the PB line and manually inject 25 mL 0.1 M PB with heparin within 1 min.",
    "Note: The liquid coming out of the atrium should be clear and the lungs and liver should have become very light after perfusion with PB.\nSwitch the perfusion solution to fixative and manually inject 25 mL fixative within ∼4 min.\nIsolate the brain.\nRemove the head with a pair of scissors.\nExpose the skull by making an incision along the midline from the neck to the nose. Remove the vertebrae and muscles that remain attached to the skull.\nUse the tip of a pair of iris scissors to carefully cut open the skull. Lift up the blade when cutting to prevent damaging the brain. Use a rongeur to peel the skull away from the dorsal surface of the brain.\nUse a spatula to sever the olfactory bulbs and nerves connected to the ventral surface of the brain.\nPlace the isolated brain in fresh fixative overnight (12–18 h) at 4°C.\nBrain sectioning\nPrepare a 5% agarose block. Add 5 g agarose powder and 0.85 g NaCl to 100 mL Milli-Q or distilled water. Heat the solution in a microwave oven until boiling. Pour the agarose solution into several 10-cm tissue culture plates and let it cool down.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1417_5.csv\nCut the agarose block into 3 × 1 × 1.5 cm (L × W × H) cubes.\nAfter the overnight fixation, wash brains with PBS (3×20 min). Gently agitate brains on a rotating platform during incubation with PBS. Alternatively, PB may be used; PBS is used because it works as well for this step and is readily available in the laboratory. Note that during Step 2, keep the brain wet with PBS or PB at all times to avoid any drying artifacts.\nGlue the agarose cube to the sample holder of the vibratome with Krazy glue (Elmer’s Products, Westerville, OH).",
    "Make a clean, vertical cut along the rostral border of the cerebellum to remove the cerebellum, using a razor blade.\nPlace the brain on a piece of filter paper to dry the bottom surface of the brain; this surface should be only slightly moist to ensure that the glue sticks properly.\nGlue the brain without the cerebellum to the sample holder of the vibratome against the agarose block using Krazy glue. Orient the brain with the dorsoventral axis in parallel with the holder plate and the rostral tip of the brain facing up.\nFill the cutting chamber of the vibratome with PBS. Cut 150-μm thick coronal sections. Transfer brain sections into 6-well plates with a fine brush.\nWash the brain sections with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer diluted from the stock solution (3×5 min), then proceed to Step 3 directly if time permits. Otherwise, keep brain sections at 4°C overnight (12–18 h) and conduct Step 3 on the next day.\nOsmium tetroxide fixation, en bloc staining, dehydration, and resin infiltration\nTiming: 1–1.5 days\nOsmium tetroxide (OsO4) is a secondary fixative for electron microscopy; it also provides contrast staining. Uranyl acetate is used for contrast staining for electron microscopy; it also acts as a fixative. The brain sections are dehydrated with ethanol following secondary fixation and staining, then embedded in epon resins. Steps 3–4 need to be performed in a chemical fume hood.\nOsmium tetroxide fixation\nPrepare fresh 1% osmium tetroxide solution by adding 250 μL 4% osmium stock solution and 100 μL 1 M cacodylate stock solution to Milli-Q or distilled water. Bring the volume to 1 mL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1417_6.csv\nRemove cacodylate buffer from brain sections by using a disposable transfer pipette. Do not allow the brain sections to dry during any of the procedures in Step 3.",
    "Add 1 mL or at least enough freshly made 1% osmium tetroxide solution to cover the sections, using a fresh pipette.\nIncubate brain sections with the osmium tetroxide solution at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 30 min in the dark.\nNote: Excessive light and heat may alter osmium tetroxide and reduce its effectiveness (Hayat, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Woods and Stirling, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Thus, we fix the tissue in the dark for a short time at room temperature; we prefer room temperature since osmium tetroxide penetrates the tissue slowly, and cooling might slow penetration even more. Alternatively, one can fix for longer in both dark and cold. However, it is not clear if light versus dark can make a significant difference considering these relatively short incubation times.\nWash brain sections 3×10 min with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.\nDehydration and resin infiltration\nPrepare 1% uranyl acetate solution by adding 0.01 g uranyl acetate to 1 mL of 50% ethanol. Protect the 1% uranyl acetate solution from light.\nDehydrate the brain sections with 50% ethanol (3×5 min).\nReplace 50% ethanol with the 1% uranyl acetate in ethanol solution. Keep brain sections in the 1% uranyl acetate solution for 15 min in the dark.\nContinue to dehydrate brain sections with 75% ethanol (2×5 min), 95% ethanol (10 min), and 100% ethanol (3×10 min).\nCarefully transfer brain sections to 20 mL glass scintillation vials containing propylene oxide. After transfer, change propylene oxide once.\nReplace propylene oxide with a 1:1 mixture of epon and propylene oxide. Incubate brain sections with the mixture for 1 h.\nReplace the epon and propylene oxide mixture with epon. Keep brain sections in epon at room temperature (20°C–22°C) overnight (12–18 h).",
    "On the day after dehydration, replace the overnight epon with freshly-made epon. Keep brain sections in epon for several hours (we keep them for 24 h) at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nEmbedding, isolation and mounting of the amygdala\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step is to prepare tissue blocks that will be cut into ultrathin sections. The researcher identifies the brain regions of interest under a light microscope and uses a scalpel to isolate them. The isolated epon-embedded tissues are mounted on cylinders made of epon.\nTissue embedding and isolation\nPlace dehydrated, epon infiltrated tissues between two Aclar sheets separated by a thin layer of epon to make an Aclar sandwich. Avoid trapping bubbles in the sandwich and cure it in an oven set at 64°C for 48 h to complete the embedding procedure.\nAdditional epon can be used to make the epon cylinders. Mount flat bottom embedding capsules (polyethylene; size “00”; Electron Microscopy Sciences, catalog number 70021) on a corresponding polypropylene capsule holder (6 pack from EMS; catalog number 70022-06). Pour the epon into the capsules and heat in an oven as above.\nRemove the Aclar sandwich from the oven and cool it down at room temperature.\nRemove one of the Aclar sheets. Then, under a light microscope, outline the amygdala with a marker pen; this area can be identified by comparing its shape and features to those seen in coronal sections in any standard atlas. Use a scalpel to carve out the amygdala along the marked outlines.\nTissue mounting\nPrior to mounting tissues, use a razor blade to slightly scratch one end of the epon cylinder in a grid pattern to assist in adhesion of the tissue section.",
    "Glue the epon-embedded amygdala to the center of the grid with one drop of Krazy glue placed on the side still covered with the Aclar material.\nNote: Ensure the tissue glued to the cylinder is flat and avoid using excessive glue. This usually produces a stable specimen for utrasectioning; however, if the tissue comes loose from the Aclar sheet, then the Aclar sheet can be removed and the tissue mounted directly to the cylinder.\nDry the cylinder mounted with the tissue at room temperature overnight (12–18 h).\nUse a specimen holder supplied with the Ultramicrotome to keep the epon cylinder mounted with brain tissue in place and free both hands for trimming.\nTrim the edges of the tissue to make it a trapezoid. Don’t damage the tissue.\nWipe off any debris from the cylinder with wet paper towels. Since the debris may contain stained tissue with heavy metals, it is preferred to wipe it off instead of blowing it off into the air.\nCritical: Use wood handles derived from cotton swabs to transfer epon-embedded tissues onto Alcar sheets. After the tissue is flattened on the first Alcar sheet, place one end of the second Alcar sheet on the first sheet and slowly lay down the rest of the second sheet to avoid bubbles. Illustrations of the epon cylinder and Aclar sandwich are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1417-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Pictures of epon-embedded brain sections and epon cylinders mounted with brain tissues\n(A) 150-μm coronal sections of mouse brain are shown embedded in epon, sandwiched between two layers of Aclar film; in the bottom image, pieces of the amygdala region have been cut out of the sections (arrows). Note that the sections are black due to treatment with osmium tetroxide.",
    "(B) The piece of brain with the amygdala is mounted on an epon cylinder and then trimmed to form a trapezoid shape. The cylinder is then placed in a metal chuck (upper right image) and inserted in the ultramicrotome (not shown) for further sectioning.\nCutting ultrathin brain sections\nTiming: 8 h\nCut thick brain sections\nCut thick sections (1 μm or more) from the face of the mounted brain tissue block on an ultramicrotome until the entire tissue face is exposed. We use a Diatome Histo Diamond Knife (45° angle, 6 mm; catalog number 60-HIS; Diatome U.S., Hatfield, PA; affiliated with EMS).\nStain these sections with a toluidine blue solution (0.5% toluidine blue [500 mg] plus 1% sodium tetraborate [1 g in 100 mL water]); we stain them on a hot plate and continue until the solution is dried.\nExamine these thick sections under a light microscope to determine if the proper area has been reached for electron microscope examination, i.e., comparing the area to the known features as shown in a standard atlas.\nCut ultrathin brain sections\nCut ultrathin brain sections (60 nm) from the face of the mounted brain tissue with an ultramicrotome. We use a Diatome Ultra Diamond Knife (Wet; 45° angle, 3.5 mm; catalog number 35-US).\nMount the ultrathin sections on formvar/carbon-coated single-slot copper grids (EMS, catalog number FCF2010-Cu-SB). Alternatively, nickel grids (EMS, catalog number FCF2010-Ni-SB) may also be used.\nStore grids in a grid box (EMS, catalog number 71147-12) in a desiccator until use.\nThe ultrathin brain section is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1417-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Ultrathin-section cutting\n(A) In the ultramicrotome, sections about 1-μm thick are cut, mounted on glass slides, and stained with a toluidine blue solution to visualize the subregions of the amygdala (BLA, basolateral amygdala; CeA, central nucleus of the amygdala).",
    "(B) Low magnification electron micrograph of an ultrathin section correlating with a portion of the thick section in A. On the electron microscope, we first go to a low magnification (50–100×; imaged in LOW MAG mode without an objective aperture) and mark off the boundaries of the brain region on the ultrathin section to be imaged. This is done by correlating the image on the Gatan camera screen (Digital Micrograph program) with an image of the last 1 μm section taken before the ultrathin sections. Arrows in A and B indicate the same two blood vessel profiles.\n(C) In the ultramicrotome, when the proper region has been reached, the ultrathin sections (60 nm) are cut and mounted on formvar/carbon-coated single slot grids (the hole is 1 × 2 mm); note that this ultrathin section is larger than the slot and so overlaps partly on the metal grid on the upper left side.\nElectron microscope imaging\nTiming: 4–8 h\nStaining\nWe mount the grids on a Hiraoka grid support plate. The type that we use has been discontinued (see Figure 1 in Petralia and Wang, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), but a similar, modified Hiraoka grid support plate is available separately (EMS, catalog number 71560-32) or in the Modified Hiraoka Staining Kit (EMS, catalog number 71560-00).\nStain with 0.3% lead citrate solution (0.3 g lead citrate in 0.1 N NaOH; pass it through a 0.22 μm filter before use) for 3 min and then wash 3× with distilled water. Dry using a pipette to remove most of the water and then use the edge of a piece of filter paper to remove the last traces of water. Store in grid box until use.\nElectron microscope imaging",
    "Place a grid with a section of the brain in a holder and insert it into the JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM).\nAlign and examine at 200 kV.\nNote: This moderately high voltage allows electrons to penetrate the tissue more readily to improve image quality; and the JEOL 2100 maintains high image contrast at 200 kV as long as there is optimal sample preparation and thickness, due to its pole-piece with an in-gap, high-contrast objective lens aperture. Our lab and others routinely use the JEOL 2100 at 200 kV for all types of studies. For some other TEMs, one might need to use a lower kV to ensure adequate contrast.\nGo to low magnification (50–100×) and compare the image on the Gatan camera monitor screen (using Digital Micrograph program) with an image of the last 1 μm section taken before the ultrathin sections (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Then mark off the boundaries of the brain region on the ultrathin section to be imaged, using the JEOL specimen position display window.\nTake images at high magnifications (2,500× to 25,000×)."
