    "This study was conducted in strict accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and adhered to the guidelines established by our institution's Human Research Ethics Committee. The research protocol underwent a thorough review and received approval from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. All participating patients provided written informed consent before their involvement in the study, and stringent measures were taken to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of their data throughout the research process. Patients with benign thyroid nodules, follicular neoplasms, or papillary microcarcinomas, with a tumor size of less than 2 cm, and the absence of lymph node metastasis, were included in the present study. On the other hand, patients with advanced thyroid cancer, tumors larger than 2 cm, evidence of lymph node metastasis, a history of neck surgery that might have resulted in anatomical distortions, or severe comorbidities were excluded from this study.\n1. Initiation of the procedure\nAdminister general anesthesia to the patient using standardized techniques performed by a qualified anesthetist (following institutionally approved procedures). Employ the EMG Endotracheal tube (see Table of Materials). Preoperative antibiotics are not required.\nPosition the patient in a supine position, turning their head slightly to the unaffected side. Abduct the upper limb on the affected side to an angle between 60°-90°. This positioning helps expose and stabilize the axilla.\n2. Incision making\nIdentify the first or second natural crease line in the axilla on the affected side. Make a primary incision of approximately 4-6 cm in length using a scalpel.\nCreate a secondary incision of about 0.5 cm using a surgical scalpel for Trocar (see Table of Materials) placement (Figure 1A).\n3. Creating surgical cavities",
    "Begin creating a nearly quadrilateral subcutaneous tunnel using retractors (see Table of Materials). Place the retractors on the surface of the pectoralis major muscle and lift the skin and subcutaneous tissue with them (Figure 1B).\nUse the retractors to identify the gap between the sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid and the clavicle head (Figure 1C). Coagulate the tiny blood vessels in the gap using the mini button of the ultrasonic scalpel (see Table of Materials).\nWith dissecting forceps and the ultrasonic scalpel, dissect the anatomical space between the sternothyroid muscle and the internal jugular vein. Follow this anatomical space to locate the thyroid and coagulate the middle thyroid vein using the mini button of the ultrasonic scalpel.\nProceed to dissect the natural space between the thyroid and the sternothyroid muscle, place the retractors in this space, and complete the creation of the surgical cavities (Figure 1D).\n4. Recognition and safeguarding of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, inferior parathyroid gland, and central neck dissection\nLift the middle and lower pole glands of the thyroid using the retractor to expose the tracheoesophageal groove.\nLocate the recurrent laryngeal nerve around the bifurcation of the inferior thyroid artery, using a nerve monitoring probe (see Table of Materials) for confirmation9 (Figure 2A).\nCarefully dissect the recurrent laryngeal nerve with dissecting forceps and the ultrasonic scalpel until it enters the larynx (Figure 2B). The length of the dissected nerve typically ranges from 4-6 cm, depending on the patient's anatomy and disease characteristics.\nDissect the area around the inferior thyroid artery using dissecting forceps and the ultrasonic scalpel while protecting and coagulating the inferior thyroid blood vessels with the mini button of the ultrasonic scalpel to expose the trachea.",
    "Follow the nerve path to the larynx, ensuring its protection during the dissection process, after coagulating and cutting off the branches of the inferior thyroid artery (Figure 2C). Safeguard the inferior parathyroid gland, preventing any damage or removal during the thyroid and central neck lymph node dissection. If the blood supply to the inferior parathyroid gland is compromised, perform autologous transplantation12.\nPerform a central neck dissection method similar to open surgery12. Remove lymph nodes from the central compartment of the neck based on the extent of the patient's disease (Figure 2D).\n5. Identification and protection of superior laryngeal nerve and superior parathyroid gland and dissection of the superior pole of the thyroid\nLift the upper pole of the thyroid using retractors and separate it upward along the common carotid artery using dissecting forceps and the ultrasonic scalpel. Continue separation along the cricothyroid space to expose the vessels of the upper thyroid pole (Figure 2E).\nLocate the superior laryngeal nerve using a nerve monitoring probe and intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) device13 (see Table of Materials).\nCoagulate and cut off the blood vessels of the upper pole of the thyroid using the mini button of the ultrasonic scalpel, taking care to avoid coagulating or cutting the superior laryngeal nerve. Fully dissociate the gap between the upper pole of the thyroid gland and the cricothyroid muscle (Figure 2F).\nAttempt to preserve the upper parathyroid gland in its original position while separating the upper pole of the thyroid gland. If the blood supply to the upper parathyroid gland is compromised, perform autologous transplantation12.\n6. En Bloc resection of the thyroid and central neck lymph nodes",
    "Utilize an ultrasonic scalpel to coagulate tiny blood vessels, and then remove both the thyroid isthmus and the lymph nodes in the central area along with the thyroid gland (Figure 3A).\nCollect the specimen using a specimen bag (Figure 3B).\n7. Post-surgery procedures\nFlush the operating cavity with warm sterile saline using a laparoscopic aspirator (see Table of Materials).\nPosition a drainage tube near the trachea, leading it out from the axilla using dissecting forceps (Figure 3C).\nIf needed, perform autologous transplantation of the parathyroid gland into the pectoralis major space following the method described in our previous work12. The only difference is the change in the site from the sternocleidomastoid to the pectoralis major (Figure 3D).\nClose the axillary incision using a 4-0 absorbable suture, making it 30 cm long and using an interrupted suture technique. Allow the neck muscles to naturally reset without suturing (Figure 3E).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
