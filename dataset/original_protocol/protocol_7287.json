    "Preparation of surgical equipment Autoclave surgical instruments.Note: Alternatively, surgical instruments can be submerged in 70% ethanol (3 min) and ddH2O (3 min) subsequently. Clean work surface, heating plate, and retraction system with 70% ethanol.Cover heating plate with 1–2 surgical drapes and adjust heating plate temperature to 37 °C.Prewarm buprenorphine (0.05 mg/mL working solution) to 37 °C on heating plate.Arrange surgical equipment (Figure 2A–2C).Note: Hemostat opening width is maximized to approximately 5 mm (tip distance). This facilitates generation of equally sized peritoneal buttons. The labels on Adson forceps’ handles assist in the formation of peritoneal buttons at distinct sites of the parietal peritoneum (Figure 2B). Anesthesia and pre-surgical preparations Weigh mouse and note down body weight.Place the mouse into induction chamber for anesthesia with 5% v/v isoflurane in medical oxygen (1.2 L/min).Place the anesthetized mouse on surgical drape/heating plate to prevent hypothermia and maintain anesthesia with 2.5% v/v isoflurane in medical oxygen (1.2 L/min) via the nose cone.Note: Assess anesthetic depth by toe and eye reflex. If necessary, adjust percentage v/v isoflurane. Monitor the respiratory rate of the mouse during entire surgical procedure. If necessary, adjust percentage v/v isoflurane. Apply 0.1 mg/kg body weight pre-warmed buprenorphine (0.05 mg/mL working solution) by subcutaneous (s.c.) femoral injection.Apply eye ointment to prevent drying of the eyes.Turn the mouse on its dorsal side and fixate the extremities with surgical tape to ensure proper tension and continuous anesthesia induction via the nose cone.Place two cellulose swaps next to each side of the abdomen.Shave the abdomen using the rodent shaver.Remove the hair using the two cellulose swaps and remove additional hair using surgical tape.Apply 70% ethanol to disinfect the shaved skin using cellulose swap.Note: Apply ethanol sparingly on the shaved skin to reduce excessive heat loss. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4491/bioprotoc-12-16-4491-g002.jpgFigure 2. Equipment and pre-surgery set-up. A.",
    "Surgical instruments and materials are set up on a heating plate covered with a sterile surgical drape. B. Distance marks are indicated on the handle of the Adson forceps for assistance during peritoneal button creation. Maximum opening distance of the hemostat is restricted to approximately 5 mm for assistance during peritoneal button formation. C. Listed items correspond to the respective letters in (A) and (B).Surgical procedure LaparotomySkin incision: perform a median vertical incision (approximately 25 mm) (Figure 3A):Grasp the abdominal skin midline approximately 25 mm inferior to the xiphoid (Graefe forceps).Extend the cut approximately towards, but no further than, the xiphoid (surgical scissors). Incision should be 25 mm or from pubic to xiphoid bone, whichever is shorter.Note: Ensure not to penetrate into the peritoneal cavity at this step. Perform a matching median vertical incision in the peritoneal wall (Figure 3B–3C):Perforate the linea alba (e.g., by using fine scissors).Note: Take care not to injure intra-abdominal organs. This can be achieved by pulling the abdominal wall up. As soon as the linea alba is perforated, air enters into the abdominal cavity, which separates the abdominal wall from the underlying organs. The access through the linea alba is extended towards the symphysis and the xiphoid process to match the skin incision in length (fine scissors).Notes:  1) Take care not to injure intra-abdominal organs. This can be ensured by pulling the peritoneal wall up while extending the cut. 2) The linea alba has no major blood vessels and this incision technique should not result in any visible bleeding. If bleeding occurs, one of the rectus abdomini muscles was likely injured. This can be salvaged by using diathermy. We use cellulose swabs only to clean the skin.",
    "We do not recommend using cellulose inside the peritoneal cavity at all, as this may influence adhesion formation that may be difficult to standardize. After exposing the peritoneal cavity, place one retractor at each corner of the opening. Adjust distance of the fixators ensuring good access to the peritoneal cavity (Figure 3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4491/bioprotoc-12-16-4491-g003.jpgFigure 3. Laparotomy. A. Median vertical incision is performed in the abdominal skin using surgical scissors and forceps. B. The abdominal wall is perforated through the linea alba (black arrow) using fine scissors. Gently pulling the abdominal wall up prevents intraperitoneal organ damage. C. Incision measures 25 mm (distance d) or from pubic to xiphoid bone, whichever is shorter. D. The peritoneal cavity is exposed by placing four retractors as displayed. Scale bar (A–D): 5 mm.Adhesions are induced by three modular components (Figure 1A–C): Peritoneal buttons (PB), Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP), and Cecal Slurry (CS). Typical component combinations include: PB alone, PB + CLP, and PB + CS.Module 1: Peritoneal button (PB) formation (Figure 1A)Gently press the handle of the Adson forceps from outside to the peritoneal wall (Figure 4A).Note: The assistance distance mark at the forceps handle is visible through the abdominal wall. Clamp a portion (approximately 5 mm) of the parietal peritoneum 8–10 mm lateral from the incision in the first quadrant using the hemostat (Figure 4B–D).Note: Labels at the forceps’ handle can help to standardize the location for the peritoneal button. Controlling maximum hemostat opening can facilitate formation of equally sized peritoneal buttons (see also Note A.5.). Ligate the grasped portion with three subsequent surgical knots at its base using a polypropylene suture 4-0 (suture tying forceps, needle holder) (Figure 4E–F).Carefully remove the hemostat (Figure 4G).Repeat the described steps (C2a–d.) three additional times, resulting in one button in each peritoneal quadrant (Figure 4H).",
    "Module 2: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure (Figure 1B)Carefully remove retractors.Locate the cecum using blunt anatomic forceps or another blunt surgical tool (e.g., needle holder).Note: The cecum is typically found in the left lower quadrant. Gently mobilize the cecum and bring it in front of the abdominal wall (Figure 5A).Ligate the cecum (2 mm) with a polyglactin 910 suture 4-0. Tie the suture tight with three subsequent surgical knots (suture tying forceps, needle holder) (Figure 5B–C).Note: Severity grade could theoretically vary by ligating different lengths of the cecum. However, increasing the length of the ligated cecum portion should be explicitly stated in the research protocols submitted to the authorities, as this may result in significant morbidity and mortality for the animals. Perforate the ligated cecum using a 25 G needle by a single through-and-through puncture (Figure 5D).Remove the needle.A small portion of feces from both puncture sides exits the ligated cecum.Relocate the cecum into the abdominal cavity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4491/bioprotoc-12-16-4491-g004.jpgFigure 4. Surgical peritoneal button formation. A. Gently pressing the handle of the Adson forceps against the abdominal wall allows access to the peritoneum. Distance marks (black arrow, blue line) support standardized peritoneal button formation. B. The hemostat is used to clamp a 5 mm section (distance d) of the peritoneal wall. C. Clamped peritoneum portion. D. Gentle retraction of the hemostat ensures good access for suture tying. E–F. Three consecutive surgical knots are created at the base of the clamped peritoneum portion using a polypropylene suture 4-0. G. Peritoneal button in the upper right quadrant. H. Two out of four peritoneal buttons are displayed (white arrows). Scale bar (A–H): 2.5 mm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4491/bioprotoc-12-16-4491-g005.jpgFigure 5. Surgical cecal ligation and puncture. A. Exteriorized cecum. B–C. Cecal ligation is performed at 2 mm distance (distance d) from the apex ceci using a polyglactin 910 suture 4-0.",
    "Three consecutive surgical knots are utilized. D. Perforation of the ligated cecum portion is achieved by a single through-and-through puncture using a 25 G needle. Abbreviations: ce = cecum. Scale bar (A–D): 2 mm.Module 3: Cecal slurry (CS) administration (Figure 1C)Thaw frozen CS in 37 °C water bath.Mix CS thoroughly.Optional: Heat inactivation of CS is performed by 20 min incubation at 72 °C.Administer 100 μL CS (native or heat-inactivated) or the respective control directly into the open peritoneal cavity using a 1 mL syringe or a P200 pipette.Note: Fluid volumes of up to 100 μL can usually be pipetted into the peritoneal cavity without compromising the subsequent closure of the abdominal cavity. If this approach leads to contamination of the surgical incision site, CS can also be administered using a 0.5 mL insulin-50 syringe after closing the abdominal wall. Carefully remove retractors.Wound closureClose the muscular peritoneal wall and the skin with an all-layer running suture (polypropylene suture 6-0, (suture tying) forceps, needle holder).Note: The integrity of this running suture and the respective knots is absolutely paramount. Suture failure can lead to wound infection or a burst abdomen resulting in significant suffering and death. We recommend formal small rodent surgery training for all investigators prior to commencing experiments. Post-surgical monitoring Carefully remove the fixation tape and the nose cone.Place the mouse back in its cage, which is placed on a heating pad.Monitor mice according to the protocol approved by authorities. In our hands, pre-surgically untreated mice (C57BL/6 background) did not develop sepsis. Nonetheless, since sepsis might occur in the hands of others or when mice are treated with immunocompromising regimens prior to surgery, we strongly recommend monitoring for signs of sepsis [e.g., murine sepsis score (Shrum et al., 2014)], in addition to a standard pain score sheet.",
    "Adhesion assessment (post-surgical day 7) Work space preparations:Clean work surface with 70% ethanol.Cover work surface with surgical drapes.Prepare autoclaved surgical instruments, fresh cellulose swaps, and surgical tape.Weigh mouse and note down body weight.Anesthetize mouse by s.c. injection of Triple mix (see Recipes, dosage for terminal experiments 6 μL/g body weight) using a 0.5 mL insulin-50 syringe.Assess anesthetic depth by toe and eye reflex approximately 15 min after injection. As soon as reflexes are lost, the mouse can be transferred to the surgical drape.Turn the mouse on its dorsal side and fixate the extremities with surgical tape to ensure proper tension.Apply 70% ethanol to disinfect the abdominal skin using cellulose swap.Expose the peritoneum around the midline suture by removing the skin from the parietal side towards the midline with a U-shape incision (surgical scissors, Adson forceps).Access the abdominal cavity using an inverted U-shape incision (fine scissors, blunted forceps).Note: Use different sets of surgical instruments for steps E7 and E8 to keep the abdominal cavity free of hair. Adhesions (Figure 6A–F) are scored by two different observers according to the selected adhesion scoring method, in this case the peritoneal adhesion index (PAI) scheme (Figure 1D, Table 1). The PAI score is a composite score based on previously published adhesion scores evaluating adhesion tenacity and vascularization (Mazuji, 1964; Nair, 1974; Zühlke et al., 1990; Coccolini et al., 2013). The total PAI aggregates the individual adhesion scores from six separate locations: PB 1st quadrant, PB 2nd quadrant, PB 3rd quadrant, PB 4th quadrant, midline incision, and interintestinal. Each location score ranges from grade 0 (minimum) to grade 4 (maximum). Consequently, the total PAI per mouse can attain values from 0 (minimum) to 24 (maximum).",
    "In Figure 6A–F examples of adhesions assessed at post-surgery day 7 are displayed:Grade 0: no adhesion (Figure 6A)Grade 1: flimsy adhesion (Figure 6B)Grade 2: dense adhesion (Figure 6C)Grade 3: fibrotic and vascularized adhesion (Figure 6D)Grade 4: complete adhesion (Figure 6E–F)If required, tissue biopsies, such as peritoneal buttons and peritoneal adhesions, can be collected for further investigation, for example histological analyses or flow cytometry.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4491/bioprotoc-12-16-4491-g006.jpgFigure 6. Peritoneal adhesion assessment using the peritoneal adhesion index (PAI). A. Peritoneal button (white arrow) is free and covered with mesothelium. Corresponds to grade 0 of the PAI scale. B. A flimsy adhesion connects the peritoneal button (white arrow) to the omentum, but separates spontaneously during the process of peritoneal cavity opening. Corresponds to grade 1 of the PAI scale. C. A dense adhesion connects the peritoneal button (white arrow) to the omentum and separates bluntly without bleeding. Corresponds to grade 2 of the PAI scale. D. A fibrotic and slightly vascularized adhesion connects the peritoneal button (white arrow) to the omentum. Upon dissection, bleeding occurs. Corresponds to grade 3 of the PAI scale. E. The peritoneal button (white arrow) is completely covered (only the suture reveals its location) by the adhesion connecting the mesentery to the abdominal wall. Corresponds to grade 4 of the PAI scale. F. A complete adhesion connects parts of the midline incision (black arrow) to peritoneal cavity organs, including cecum and intestine. Dissection results in organ damage. Corresponds to grade 4 of the PAI scale. Abbreviations: adh = adhesion; aw = abdominal wall; ce = cecum; in = intestine; me = mesentery; om = omentum.
