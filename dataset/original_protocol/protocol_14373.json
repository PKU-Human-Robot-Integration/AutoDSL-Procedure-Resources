    "This protocol follows the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\n1. Assessment Guidelines Prior to Placement\nNOTE: Although there are no formal contraindications listed in the U.S. labelling, it is recommended that the esophageal temperature management device be used with caution in patients with known esophageal deformity, evidence of esophageal trauma, and in patients known to have ingested acidic or caustic poisons within the prior 24 hours.\nObtain all equipment, including appropriate heat exchange unit, the esophageal temperature management device, an appropriate securement device, water-based lubrication packets, and a circumferential bite block.\nPlace Foley thermistor and/or rectal temperature probe and connect one to the heat exchange unit. A second temperature source is recommended for verification, and may be connected to the patient monitor.\nConnect the esophageal temperature management device to the appropriate heat exchanger, power on the unit, set the patient target temperature according to hospital protocol, and place the heat exchanger in automatic mode. Ensure that water is flowing through the esophageal temperature management device and confirm that no leaks are present.\n2. Device Insertion\nMeasure the appropriate insertion depth for the esophageal temperature management device by extending it from the patient's lips to the earlobe and then from the earlobe to the tip of the xiphoid process; mark the insertion depth on the device (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56579/56579fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

A gentle jaw thrust may be required to assist passage of the device. If clinically feasible, the addition of slight neck extension, induced with support under the shoulders if needed, may further ease passage of the device. Advance the device with light pressure until the required length of tube has been inserted. Secure the bite block in place (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56579/56579fig4v2.jpg\nFigure 4. Inserting the esophageal temperature management device.

Ensure the tube and tube set connections are not in contact with the patient's skin, as direct contact between the tube and exposed skin may cause shivering.\nFor stomach decompression, connect the central lumen to low-intermittent suction using standard suction tubing.\n3. Temperature management – cooling",
    "Ensure heat exchanger is set to automatic mode and the appropriate goal temperature (typically from 32 °C to 37 °C, depending on institutional protocol) is set.\nInitiate shivering prophylaxis with medications as per unit protocol (prophylactic intervention is recommended with non-sedating medications to start; for example, acetaminophen, buspirone, magnesium, and skin counterwarming).\nEvaluate for shivering using the Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale at regular intervals, or anytime temperature reduction is not proceeding as expected. Shivering occurs in a caudal progression and will first be identified at the mandible or pectoralis muscles; early intervention is imperative. Additional treatment for shivering may include meperidine, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, propofol, or neuromuscular blockade.\n4. Temperature management – maintenance\nMonitor and record water temperature hourly; if the water temperature drops below 10 °C for 1 h (or more than once when patient is at target temperature), first assess for shivering.\nPeriodically reposition the esophageal temperature management device in accordance with hospital protocol.\n5. Temperature management – warming\nFollow local hospital guideline for rewarming rate if rewarming from intentional hypothermia.\nSet a maximum rewarming rate if rewarming from accidental hypothermia, or preventing perioperative hypothermia.\n6. Troubleshooting\nNOTE: A kink or pinch in the system may cause an occlusion alert on the external heat exchanger. If the cause cannot be found, stop treatment and remove the esophageal temperature management device.\nUtilize standard approaches for clearing blocked gastric tubes if the central lumen of the esophageal temperature management device becomes clogged or blocked; if unsuccessful, replace the device.\nIf there is a discrepancy greater than 0.5 °C between temperature sources, pause therapy to investigate the issue.",
    "As leak in the system may cause an increase in accumulated liquid in the suction canister, if a larger than expected volume of water accumulates in the suction canister, stop treatment and remove the esophageal temperature management device to examine for leaks.\n\tNOTE: Factors which may affect warming or cooling include body mass, environmental conditions, shivering, and clinical condition; patients greater than 120 kg may exhibit slower responses to intended temperature changes, and smaller patients may take longer to warm.\nIf the patient is not cooling or warming as expected:\n\t\nEnsure the esophageal temperature management device is at the correct depth.\nEnsure adequate water flow and that the device is cold or warm to touch (as appropriate).\nEnsure the external heat exchanger is set appropriately in automatic mode with desired target temperature and appropriate water temperature (4 °C to 42 °C).\nConfirm the temperature probe is intact and accurate; check with secondary source.\nCheck the patient for heat generation (shivering or fever generation for example), heat loss (hemodynamic instability or medication administration) and ensure the environmental temperature is consistent with temperature modulation goal.\n7. Device removal\nPress \"Monitor\" to stop the external heat exchanger, close the clamps if present, and withdraw the device.\nDisconnect the device from the tube set connections and dispose as per institutional policy.\nTurn off the heat exchange unit."
