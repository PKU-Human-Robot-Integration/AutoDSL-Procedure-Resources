    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details about all the materials used in the protocol.\n1. Construction of the SAA\nMake the frame by cutting wood and assembling the frame using the dimensions in Figure 1A.\nModify 50 mL conical tube caps.\n\t\nDrill two holes in each cap with a 9/32 in drill bit. Sand the holes to clean up the ragged plastic. Sand the top of the cap to roughen the surface (this helps with glue adhesion).\nCut 5 mL serological pipettes to size (3 in for inflow and 1.5 in for outflow) by scoring the plastic and then breaking it clean at the scored line. Sand the ends of the cut/broken pipettes.\nGlue netting to the tubes (allow proper drying time for the adhesive). Cut the netting to the size of the tube after the adhesive dries.\nInsert the tubes into the holes of the conical caps with both tubes extending (3/4 in) above the cap; ensure that the inflow tube extends longer into the tube than the outflow (Figure 1B).\nApply glue to the tops of the caps around the tubes to secure the parts together (allow proper drying time for the adhesive before continuing).\nAttach the caps to the frame, and route the tubing (Figure 1C).\n\t\nAttach adhesive cable tie-downs to the frame (3.25 in apart, center to center).\nAffix the caps to the frame using zip ties; cut the zip tie tag ends short.\nCut and connect lengths (9 in) of Tygon tubing to the inflow/outflow tubes on each modified cap (Figure 1D). Starting at the upstream end, attach first to the inflow, and then subsequently attach tubing from the outflow to the inflow of the next position.\nAdd a flow indicator to the most downstream \"inflow\" (position 10, Figure 1E).",
    "Put a 50 mL conical tube on the first position, and fill it with water to just below the inflow tube (Figure 1F).\nPrepare the interfacing for the vaporizer. Remove the plungers, cut notches out of two 10 mL dispensing syringes (1/2 in deep x 1/4 in wide, Figure 1G), and insert them into the vaporizer inflow and outflow with the notches facing directly toward the front of the vaporizer to align with the holes (Figure 1H). Optional: Glue the modified syringes into place. If affordable, use a commercial manifold (see the Table of Materials for one option).\nHook up the entire system. Use Tygon tubing to attach the components together in the following order: carrier gas tank with regulator > gas specific flowmeter > vaporizer > SAA (Figure 1C).\nFill empty positions on the array with empty 50 mL conical tubes. Turn on the gas tank, open the flowmeter to ~2 L/min, and turn on the vaporizer to 0%. Confirm gas flow through the system by checking the flowmeter upstream of the vaporizer and the flow indicator downstream of the last chamber of the SAA for flow. Alternatively, insert the downstream tubing end into water, and look for bubbles.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: As the system is not pressurized, a water column higher than a couple of centimeters will stop the flow. If there is no flow at the downstream end of the array, check the following: the vaporizer needs to be on to allow flow; check that the tank regulator and flow meters are allowing flow; check the array positions to make sure the tubes are screwed on tightly; and check for leaks around the adhesive on the modified caps.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65144/65144fig01.jpg",

The red circle highlights the cut-out notch located between the 8 mL and 10 mL marks (or 1/2 in x 1/4 in). (H) Rear view of the Tec7 vaporizer showing the insertion and orientation of the modified syringes. Only one syringe is in place in this view to show, on the left, the hole (red arrow) that needs to be aligned with the notch of the modified syringe. Note: Misalignment of this cut-out notch and the outflow opening will disrupt anesthetic administration. This part is a potential weak spot in this custom-made system. If funds are available, a commercial manifold should be used. Abbreviation: SAA = serial anesthesia array.

Prior to anesthetic exposure\nTwenty-four hours or more prior to the anesthetic exposure, sort the fly cohorts as needed for the experiment using the preferred method (e.g., CO2 or ether).\n3. Operation of the SAA\nTransfer flies from food vials into empty 50 mL conical tubes (without CO2).\n\t\nCount and record any dead flies prior to exposure.\nUncap and screw 50 mL conical tubes with flies onto the SAA.\nTurn on the carrier gas, and set to the desired flow rate.",
    "NOTE: We typically use 1-2 L/min.\nSet the anesthetic vaporizer to the desired concentration.\n\tNOTE: We typically use 2% for isoflurane and 3.5% for sevoflurane, which are equipotent doses in mammals10.\nExpose the flies for the desired duration (min: 15 min).\n\tNOTE: A minimum exposure time of 15 min is recommended to avoid possible variability in equilibration across the positions of the SAA. In this system, it takes 2-3 min for the anesthetics to equilibrate across all the positions.\nAt the end of the exposure, flush the system with fresh gas flow (vaporizer set to 0%) at 1.5 L/min for 5 min corresponding to approximately 10x volumes of the total SAA volume.\n4. Checklist prior to starting an experiment\nOpen the high-pressure regulator (on top of the air tank) completely, and then close it half a turn to ensure carrier gas flow.\nFollow tubing for each line to the i) flowmeters and ii) vaporizer (make sure the inflow/outflow are connected correctly), and iii) check the anesthetic level in the vaporizers.\nAfter loading the chambers with subjects, check that the air/gas is flowing with the bubble test or the flow indicator.\n\tNOTE: Some vaporizers do not allow air flow when the dial is in the off position.\nWhen gas is flowing, confirm that both the flowmeter and the downstream flow indicator indicate flow.\nAt the end of the experiment, allow for 4-5 min of airflow to wash out the anesthetic."
