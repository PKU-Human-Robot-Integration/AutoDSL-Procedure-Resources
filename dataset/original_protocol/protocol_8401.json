    "The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of South Carolina (federal assurance number: A3049-01).\n1. Preparation of Fresh Frozen Brain Sections\nUse the F344/N rat strain: three rats of each sex, 13 months of age, body weight approximately 320 g.\nAdjust the sevoflurane concentration to 5% (overdose of sevoflurane). Continue sevoflurane exposure after breathing stops for an additional minute.\nDecapitate the rat and remove the brain.\nSubmerge the rat brain in liquid nitrogen for 15 s within 5 min of tissue harvest.\nEquilibrate the brain to -20 °C in a cryostat for 1 h.\nCut 30 µm sections and transfer onto slides (see Table of Materials).\nChoose sections from the nucleus accumbens region, approximately 2.76 mm to 2.28 mm anterior to Bregma14.\nContinuously slice the rat brain from the olfactory bulb through the nucleus accumbens region according to the stereotaxic brain structure of the rat.\nMount samples onto the slides. Keep the sections at -20 °C for 10 min to dry.\nImmediately immerse slides in the pre-chilled 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C.\nPlace the slides in an increasing ethanol gradient at room temperature (RT): 50% EtOH for 5 min; 70% EtOH for 5 min; and 100% EtOH for 5 min.\nRepeat with fresh 100% EtOH.\nPlace slides on absorbent paper, and air dry.\nDraw a barrier around each section with a barrier pen (see Table of Materials). Let the barrier dry completely for 1 min.\n2. Pretreatment of Brain Sections\nTurn on the oven and set the temperature to 40 °C.\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of Pretreatment 4 reagent (see Table of Materials) on each brain section (one section per slide).\nIncubate the sections for 30 min at RT.",
    "Submerge the slides in 1x PBS for 1 min at RT. Repeat with fresh 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Slides should not stay in 1x PBS for longer than 15 min.\n3. RNA In Situ Hybridization Fluorescent Multiplex Assay\nWarm the target probe for 10 min at 40 °C in a water bath, and then cool to RT.\nPlace the RNA reagent (e.g., Amp 1-4 FL) at RT.\nRemove excess liquid from slides with absorbent paper and place back on the slide rack (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of the Drd1α probe (C1) on the sample slice. Incubate for 2 h at 40 °C.\nSubmerge slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 minutes at RT. Repeat with fresh 1x wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid from the slides with absorbent paper and place back on the slide rack (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of Amp 1-FL on the sample slice. Incubate for 30 min at 40 °C.\nSubmerge slides in 1 wash buffer for 2 min at RT. Repeat with fresh 1wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid from the slides with absorbent paper and place back on the slide rack (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of Amp 2-FL on the sample slice. Incubate for 15 min at 40 °C.\nSubmerge slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 minutes at RT. Repeat with fresh 1x wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid from the slides with absorbent paper and place back on the slide rack (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of Amp 3-FL on the sample slice. Incubate for 30 min at 40 °C.\nSubmerge slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 min at RT. Repeat with fresh 1x wash buffer.",
    "Remove excess liquid from the slides with absorbent paper and place back on the slide rack (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 3 drops (90 µL) of Amp 4-FL-Alt A on the sample slice. Incubate for 15 min at 40 °C.\nSubmerge slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 minutes at RT. Repeat with fresh 1x wash buffer.\nRemove excess liquid from slides and immediately place 2 drops of mounting reagent (see Table of Materials) onto each section.\nPlace a 22 mm 22 mm coverslip (see Table of Materials) over each brain section.\nStore slides in the dark at 2-8 °C until dry.\nTurn on the confocal microscope and switch to a 60X objective.\nObtain Z-stack images with a confocal microscope. See the supplemental video for a detail procedure of confocal imaging.\nAcquire images of Drd1α labeled cells in the nucleus accumbens region (Excitation: 488 nm; Emission: 515/30 nm).\n\tNOTE: Do not let brain sections dry out between incubation steps.\n4. Data Analysis\nSemi-quantitatively analyze the staining pattern: \"discrete dots\".\n\t\nTo identify the individual cell from the image, perform DAPI staining as a nuclear marker. However, it is still difficult to analyze certain parts of brain tissue since it has multiple types of cells with irregular shape of nuclei and/or cells. Here, two experienced researchers separately assign each cell from images to define cell region.\nVisually score each cell within the representative confocal images based on the number of dots per cell using the specific criteria (Figure 1B).\nDetermine the total cell number in each category and divide by the total cell number x100 to create relative frequency graphs that display the percent frequency of cells within each category for all tissue sections (Figure 2A) and for males and females separately (Figure 2E).",
    "Divide the sum of cells within all prior categories by the total cell number x100 to determine the cumulative frequency of cells for all tissue sections (Figure 2B) and for males and females separately (Figure 2F).\nStatistically analyze the \"discrete dots\" staining pattern (Optional).\n\t\nExamine the number of dots per cell to provide a categorical variable that is ordinal in nature (i.e., the number of cells which fall into each rank category from lowest cell expression (1) to highest cell expression (9)) for further statistical analyses.\nAfter examination of descriptive statistics, use three main approaches: a Mantel-Haenszel statistic, a Mann-Whitney U test, and a Kruskal-Wallis test. Although the precise statistical approach will be dependent upon the experimental design and research question of interest, a statistical decision tree (Figure 4) may aid in making decisions regarding one's analytical approach.\nQuantify the signal intensity in the region of interest (ROI) for staining pattern: \"clusters\".\n\t\nCalculate the signal intensity of each image using the following equation:\n\t\tSignal intensity = Total intensity of ROI image - (Average background intensity × Total image area)\nCount the total number of cells within ROI image to calculate the approximate signal expression per cell. Group differences in signal intensity/image as well as the number of cells/image may be of interest to consider mechanisms that may contribute to group differences seen in signal expression/cell (Figure 3B-3D).\nStatistically analyze the \"clusters\" staining pattern (Optional).\n\t\nExamine the signal expression/cell to provide a continuous variable for further statistical analysis. Use two approaches, including an independent sample t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), based on the number of between-subjects factors included in the design. A statistical decision tree (Figure 4) may aid in making decisions regarding the most appropriate statistical approach.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
