    "Soil column preparationDepending on the plant species, and for how long you want to grow the plant, different column dimensions may be required. For our experiments, rice was grown in column dimensions of 10 cm height × 3 cm diameter for 10 days with a minimum of four replicates per treatment.Note: As the roots of the plant grow, they will eventually reach the boundary of the column. This will have implications for the measurement of root angle and depth. In the case of root angle, a sharp downwards trajectory is common, so we suggest only measuring the angle at the point of contact with the column wall. Measurements of primary root length should be made before the primary root reaches the bottom of the column. A preliminary assessment of the growth rate of the roots of the plant species you are working with is recommended. To facilitate easy removal of the plant from the soil following X-ray CT scanning, a column was designed which could be easily split longitudinally and opened into two equal halves. The column also features a tapered base plate and separate holding jig, to facilitate identical placement inside the X-ray CT scanner for each scan. Both the columns and holding jig were manufactured using a fused deposition modelling 3D printer in Polylactic Acid (PLA) (Figure 1). Source files for the 3D models and suggested print settings are available at https://github.com/UoNMakerSpace/[href=https://github.com/UoNMakerSpace/].If a 3D printer is not available, cut a 10 cm length of 3 cm diameter plastic drainpipe (Figure 2C), then remove any burr from the ends using a coarse grade (80 grit) sandpaper.Note: It is important to cut the drainpipe at a 90° angle to ensure the column sits vertically upright.",
    "This helps to minimize the size of the reconstructed data volume following the CT scan, as columns that are not straight (i.e., tilted) require a larger volumetric field of view to capture the full column in the scan. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of the 3D printed column used for CT imaging. Using a black marker pen, draw a circle of 2.5 cm radius on the nylon fabric mesh (white) and then cut it out using scissors following the circular mark.Cut a 0.5 cm wide × 8 cm long strip of double-sided sticky tape and fix it around the plastic column, so the edge of the tape is flush to the bottom edge of the column (Figure 2D). Stretch the nylon fabric mesh across the bottom of the column (Figure 2E), allowing the sticky tape to hold the material in place with even tension. Wrap a 10 cm length of cloth-backed adhesive tape around the edges of the material to securely fix the column (Figure 2F).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g002.jpgFigure 2.

The volume of the 3 cm diameter column we used was 63.62 cm3. Measure the radius, height, and weight of the empty column to calculate the bulk density.To achieve a soil bulk density (BD) of 1.1 g/cm3 and 1.",
    "6 g/cm3, add 69.98 g and 101.78 g of sieved (<2 mm) air dried soil to the column, respectively.Notes:   To make the non-compacted soil treatment (1.1 g/cm3), weigh 69.98 g of soil, add to the column then gently tap the base of the column (2-3 times during filling the soil) to settle the soil to reach 9 cm height of the column.   To make the compacted soil treatment (1.6 g/cm3), weigh 50.89 g of soil, press it until it occupies 4.5 cm height of the column, and then add the remaining 50.89 g of soil, compressing it to reach 9 cm height of the column.  For both bulk density treatments, add 7.77 g of soil to create a non-compacted zone with a final soil filled height of 10 cm.Note: This helps establishment of the pregerminated seeds on the top of the column, otherwise most seeds will fail to grow in the compacted soil. Place the column in a tray containing sterilized water to a depth of 3 cm. Leave overnight at room temperature to saturate the soil from the bottom of the column upwards.After 8-12 h, ensure the surface of the soil is fully saturated, remove the columns from the tray of water, and allow them to drain freely for 48 h, then record their mass. The mass of the column is equivalent to the notional field capacity moisture of the soil.Place a pregerminated rice seed into the surface of the soil and cover gently with soil to place the radicle into top non-compacted soil. Be careful not to damage the emerging radicle.Note: Briefly, de-husked rice seeds were sterilized with 10% bleach solution for 5 min and thereafter washed with sterilized reverse osmosis (RO) water 5 times.",
    "The sterilized seeds were placed on a wet Whatman paper in the dark for two days, and the pregerminated seeds were then gently placed in the top 1.1 BD soil of both columns. Grow the rice seedlings in suitable growth rooms (at 30°C, 12-hour photoperiod and 300 μmol·m-2·s-1 light with 70% relative humidity) for 4 days. Maintain the moisture content at field capacity for each column, by checking its weight and adding water to the top surface of the soil if needed. The weight of the columns should be checked daily (Figure 3). Note: For our soils, the volumetric water content was 18% and 14%, respectively, for the 1.1 g/cm3 and 1.6 g/cm3 BD treatments. The soil moisture content is dependent on soil texture and organic matter status, so it is important to calculate this for your own specific experimental conditions.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g003.jpgFigure 3.

The red circle and yellow rectangle show the root tip zone of rice and Arabidopsis roots, respectively. (C) Longitudinal image of rice root tip grown in non-compacted soil. Note: For the compaction study, root tips were used which were growing through soil, not on the soil surface.  Do not add water on the day before X-ray CT scanning, as high soil water content can reduce the efficiency of root segmentation.Note: We leave the columns to be scanned on tissue paper for 12hrs before scanning to reduce soil moisture content (approx. 80% Field Capacity). X-ray Computed TomographyAfter turning on the CT scanner, first optimize the CT scanner by conditioning and centering the X-ray tube following the manufacturer’s guidelines.",
    "Collect offset (black) and gain (white) detector calibration images for the chosen X-ray energy and detector settings. This process typically takes 20-30 min.The scan parameters provided in Table 1 are suitable for imaging soil column diameters 30-60 mm using a GE Phoenix v|tome|x m 240 kV CT scanner. Enter each parameter into the GE Datos acq software (GE Sensing and Inspection Technologies GmbH, Wunstorf, Germany).Table 1.

    "Place the soil column with the plant on the rotation stage and ensure it is stable. Close the scanner door, turn on the X-rays, and select the ‘live’ image on the monitor screen.Make a new project in the software for the scan to save the images. Check the parameters are all correct and then press ‘start’.When the scan is complete, use the GE Datos rec software to reconstruct the data.Open the scan in Datos rec and use the scan optimizer tool to calculate the geometric center calibration, and counteract any sample movement which may have occurred during the scan.Apply a Beam Hardening Correction (BHC) value of 8 and then use the AutoROI function to set the region of interest for reconstruction, to remove the very top and bottom of the scan volume which often contain cone-beam artifacts. Reconstruction is made in a 16-bit depth image format.The reconstructed data is now ready for polyline tracing of the root in non-compacted and compacted soils.Open the data in VGStudioMAX software, and use the polyline measurement tool to trace the trajectory of the roots from the seed down into the soil profile. Record the length of each root (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Scale bar 20 mm.Root anatomical imaging (longitudinal)Carefully open the 3D printed column.Remove (cut) the soil from the column leaving the root tip zone (2 cm) intact (see Figure 3B).Place the 2 cm soil block containing the root tip in sterilized water for 5 min.",
    "Wash the soil with a gentle flow of water 3-5 times to remove the soil from the root tip.Finally, remove the remaining soil particles from the root tip using a fine paint brush. Do not press the brush too hard as the root tip can break very easily.Fix (preserve) the washed root tips in freshly-prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution (PFA) in a vacuum chamber for 1 h (Figure 5A).Wash the rice root tips with 1× PBS buffer three times for two minutes each.Store and clear the root tips using ClearSee solution for 15 days (Figure 5B). Using a confocal microscope, check if the root tips are cleared using Calcoflour staining (Figure 5C); if necessary, extend the clearing stage for longer (20-25 days).Note: Compacted soil grown root tips require longer times (20-25 days) to clear than non-compacted soil root tips, as they have larger diameters. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g005.jpgFigure 5.

    "Rice roots in compacted soil have a larger root diameter. Scale Bar 100 µm.Root anatomical imaging (radial)Place the washed root tips in sterilized water for 10 min, while preparing a 3.5% agarose gel solution using a microwave oven.Note: Use a ‘pulsed’ operation of the microwave by intermittently switching off and on every 5-10 s to avoid boiling the agarose (boiling agarose solution may explode). Allow the agarose solution to cool at room temperature for 20 min.Place the root tips in a 3D-printed embedding mold.Note: You can obtain the 3D print file using the Nottingham Maker Space GitHub site (https://github.com/UoNMakerSpace/[href=https://github.com/UoNMakerSpace/]).Slowly pour the melted agarose solution into the 3D-printed embedding molds over the root tips.Note: During the pouring process, the orientation of root tips can change. To mitigate this movement, first completely fill the mold with agarose solution then reorient the root tips using a pair of forceps before the agarose solidifies. Keep at room temperature for 30 min until fully solidified.Use a vibratome to cut transverse sections of the root tips. Note: Please follow the detailed vibratome protocol as described in Atkinson and Wells (2017).  Stain the sections on a glass slide with 1% Calcofluor white dye for 5 min.Place a coverslip on the root section and image with a confocal microscope as described above (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4252/bioprotoc-11-24-4252-g007.jpgFigure 7.
