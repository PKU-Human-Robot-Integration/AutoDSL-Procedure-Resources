    "No specific ethics approval is required since this operation was performed in routine clinical care. The patient is a 67-year-old female with a 1 cm ampullary tumor, presenting with obstructive jaundice, pale colored stools, dark colored urine, itching and 10 kg weight loss in 1 year. Patient's clinical history shows hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) shows a large pedunculated polypoid lesion of the ampulla.\n1. Patient Selection\nSelect patients on the basis of a pancreatic or peri-ampullary tumor without any signs of involvement of major vessels on a recent (max 4 weeks old) contrast enhanced CT-scan.\nExamine the CT for any vascular abnormalities such as aberrant course of the right hepatic artery.\nDuring training, exclude patients with a body mass index >35 kg/m2, recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis, previous major abdominal surgery, pancreas-targeted radiotherapy, mid-cholangiocarcinomas, and large duodenal cancers, due to expected technical difficulties. Once extensive experience with LPD has been obtained, vascular resections are also feasible during LPD20.\n2. Patient Preparation\nPerform a preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to relieve the obstructive jaundice.\nPlace a 7Fr plastic biliary stent and take biopsies. Pathology shows a tubulovillous adenoma of common bile duct (CBD) with focal high-grade dysplasia. Figure 1 illustrates the appearance of the lesion on CT scan.\n3. Surgical Technique\nOperation setting\n\t\nPlace the patient in French position with a heating device on a short grain mattress with the right arm in and left arm abducted to 90Â°.\nDuring sterile exposition, remember to keep the suprapubic region free for a Pfannenstiel incision to remove the specimen. The first surgeon stands between the patient's legs, the 1st and the 2nd assistant are on the left and right side, respectively. Use a 6-port technique to perform the procedure, see Figure 2.",
    "After creation of pneumoperitoneum, place the sub-umbilical 12 mm trocar and then 4 trocars along a semi-circular plane (two 12 mm trocars left and right of the umbilicus, two 5 mm trocars four fingers subcostal left and right in the anterior axillary line).\nPlace the 6th trocar just sub-xiphoidal (Figure 2) for liver retraction.\nChoose an appropriated (articulating) sealing device, along with laparoscopic monopolar hook and laparoscopic bipolar clamp diathermy.\nExploration Phase\n\t\nPerform a diagnostic laparoscopy to exclude peritoneal and liver metastases. Place a straight needle transcutaneously in the epigastric region, around the Teres ligament to retract the ligament to the ventral abdominal wall.\nDissect the gallbladder hilum and the cystic artery and then divide the duct between clips and suture Hartmann's pouch to the ventral abdominal wall for further liver retraction and exposure of the hepato-duodenal ligament.\nDissection Phase\n\t\nOpen the lesser sac by dividing the gastrocolic ligament 2 cm distal from the gastroepiploic vessels. Free the stomach from the pancreas and let the assistant retract the stomach anteriorly. Mobilize the hepatic flexure. Thereafter, the left assistant retracts the duodenum to the patient's left side, while the right assistant pushes the colon caudo-medially with a gauze.\nKocher Maneuver\n\t\t\nPerform a wide Kocher maneuver, exposing the inferior caval vein, the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the ligament of Treitz. Expose also the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and its confluence with the gastroepiploic vein. Dissect the latter and transect it using clips and articulating sealer.\nPancreatic Tunnel\n\t\t\nNow, create the beginning of a wide pancreatic tunnel.",
    "Next, free the distal part of the stomach, just 1 cm proximal to the pylorus, and transect it using an endostapler after the nasogastric tube is pulled back. On the cranial side of the pancreas, dissect the hepatic artery lymph node station (number 8a) and send it for pathology. Hereafter, identify the hepatic artery, portal vein and gastroduodenal artery.\nEncircle the gastroduodenal artery with a vessel loop and divide it, leaving 2 locking clips on the patient's side and 1 on the specimen's side. Complete the pancreatic tunnel by blunt dissection using the articulating sealer and sling the pancreas with a quarter length vessel loop, securing it with a plastic self-locking clip.\nLigament of Treitz resection\n\t\t\nMobilize the duodenojejunal flexure (ligament of Treitz), and divide the first jejunal loop with an endostapler using a vascular cartridge. Now complete the mobilization of the first loop up to the mesenteric root. Hereafter, suture the two free ends of the jejunum to each other and pass both under the mesenteric root to the patient's right side.\nPancreatic resection\n\t\t\nFor the pancreatic head dissection, move the camera to the right sided 12-mm trocar as this offers a better view of the SMA and SMV. Dissect the uncinate process with the articulating sealer from the lateral aspect of the SMV and first jejunal branch. Work in layers from ventral to dorsal, while retracting the SMV medially to expose the SMA.\nTransect the pancreas using monopolar diathermy, manage bleeding with bipolar diathermy.\nTransect the pancreatic duct with scissors to avoid sealing of the duct. Dissect all retroperitoneal nodes, while visualizing the SMA.\nBile duct resection",
    "Follow up the common hepatic artery to the right hepatic artery and take care in case of aberrant vascular anatomy. Hereafter, encircle the hepatic duct with a vessel loop and divide it between a laparoscopic bulldog on the proximal hepatic duct, and a plastic locking clip (or second bulldog) on the distal hepatic duct.\nNext, place the specimen in a plastic retrieval bag and temporarily leave it in the lower abdomen. Remove the specimen later simultaneously with the gallbladder. Take a short pause before start of the reconstruction phase.\nReconstruction Phase\n\t\nPancreatic anastomosis\n\t\t\nWith 3D laparoscopy, start the reconstruction phase performing the PJ, according to the modified Blumgart technique, with 4 barbed sutures (large blunt needle, 3/0, 23cm length) (Figure 3).\nPass the sutures through the pancreas approximately 1 cm from the cut edge, then pass them dorsally through the bowel and back through the pancreas. After passing, drive the needle through its own loop, tighten and place it far from the pancreas.\nRepeat this procedure for each suture, taking care not to obstruct the pancreatic duct (Figure 3.1). The 3D laparoscopy facilitates easy needle placement and suturing.\nDuct-to-mucosa anastomosis\n\t\t\nCreate a 2 mm enterotomy in the jejunum using the diathermy hook (about 5 mm from the pancreatic duct).\nSubsequently, place 4-6 duct-to-mucosa sutures using a small blunt needle (5/0). In case of four sutures, place them at 8, 5, 11 and 2 o'clock. Choose the position in order to overcome more difficult suturing of the typical 9 and 3 o'clock sutures in small pancreatic ducts.\nFirst, place the 8 and 5 o'clock sutures with the knot inside. Place a 12 cm 6 or 8 Fr pediatric nasogastric tube as internal pancreatic stent (Figure 3.2).",
    "Next, place the 11 and 2 o'clock sutures with the knot outside. Complete the anastomosis picking up the ventral side of the jejunum with the original four barbed sutures, inserting them first anteriorly through the jejunal wall and then back through the ventral side of the pancreas, and retracting toward the spleen to prevent tearing of the pancreas.\nSecure each suture with a clip on the pancreatic surface before cutting (Figure 3.3 and 3.4).\nBiliary anastomosis\n\t\t\nApproximately 5-7 cm further on the jejunal loop, create a 2-4mm antimesenterial enterotomy with the diathermy hook.\nPerform an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) with interrupted absorbable threaded (5/0) sutures, starting with a suture between 6 o'clock on the bile duct to 12 o'clock in the enterotomy.\nContinue it from caudal to cranial alternating between the left and right sides of the HJ. A tension-releasing suture may be placed between the jejunal loop and the gallbladder bed. In case of a wide, thick-walled bile duct use a running suture with the surgeon standing on the patient's left or right side.\nPlace a surgical drain from the right subcostal space through the foramen of Winslow ending at the superior border of the PJ. Complete the cholecystectomy and place the gallbladder in a second retrieval bag. Pull up the first jejunal loop to the stomach.\nGastric anastomosis\n\t\t\nAfter a small enterotomy and small gastrostomy just ventral from the staple line perform a stapled side-to-side antecolic gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Close the remaining opening with a single suture with a barbed 3/0 suture.",
    "Create a Pfannenstiel incision of 5 cm to extract the pancreatoduodenectomy specimen and the gallbladder. Close this incision in layers and insufflate the abdomen to place a second drain through the most right sided 5 mm trocar at the inferior border of the PJ, with the tip under the GJ.\nCover the PJ and the stump of the GDA with the greater omentum. Close the fascia of the three 12 mm trocars. Close all incisions by intracutaneous sutures (4/0) (Figure 4)."
