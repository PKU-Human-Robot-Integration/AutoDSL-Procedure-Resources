    "Note: This protocol involves the manipulation of dangerous compounds, namely osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, epoxy resin, and uranyl acetate. Osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, and epoxy resin are a contact and inhalation hazard. Prepare and use these toxic compounds in a chemical fume hood and wear gloves. Uranyl acetate is a uranium salt that does not represent a significant external radiation hazard, as the alpha particles do not penetrate the external layer of skin. There are beta and gamma emitters, but the betas also do not have enough energy to penetrate the skin, and the amount of gamma radiation is minimal. Despite this, uranyl acetate has associated chemical and radiological hazards, and some basic safety precautions must be adopted, with emphasis on avoiding the possibility of inhalation or ingestion of the material. Uranyl acetate has to be stored and disposed of as a low-level radioactive compound. Please read the official guideline of each compound carefully before use and follow the local safety regulations. Culturing cells on sapphire disks and viral infectionBefore plating cells, the 50-µm-thick sapphire disks (1.4 mm in diameter) must be carefully cleaned with 100% ethanol and covered with a carbon layer of 4-7-µm thickness using a coating device. Most cell lines propagate most efficiently using this substrate. To know on which side of the disk the cells are, it is useful to scratch an asymmetric letter or a number in the carbon.The carbon coating must be stabilized to avoid detachment from the disks. To stabilize before use, place the carbon-coated disks in a glass dish and bake overnight at 120°C. If the disks will not be used right away, they can be stored in a humid atmosphere in a refrigerator at 4°C for 2-4 weeks. After storage, the disks should be glow-discharged before use as a cell substrate.",
    "Finally, the disks should be sterilized prior to culturing cells (e.g., using ultraviolet radiation).Note: The glow-discharge treatment of TEM grids makes the carbon film surface negatively charged, which allows aqueous solutions to spread easily and facilitates attachment of cells and particles. Place the sapphire disks in plastic dishes. HBMECs (5 × 105 cells per well) are added and maintained in 2 ml complete RPMI-1640 medium (see Recipes) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).Cells are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h and adsorbed with reovirus strain T1LM1 P208S at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/cell (stock diluted in culture medium) at 37°C for 1 h.Note: The maintenance medium must be aspirated prior to reovirus absorption. After the inoculum is removed, fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 2% FBS is added, and cells are incubated for 18 h post-infection (hpi).For biosafety reasons, HBMECs are fixed with 1 ml 1% glutaraldehyde in HEPES buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h.Note: Prior to fixation, the culture medium must be aspirated. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Coating of the sapphire disks using the Leica EM MED020 High pressure freezing (HPF)Note: HPF was accomplished using the Leica (EM PACT2) HPF instrument. For other HPF instruments, different sized sapphire discs may be required, and the loading protocol may differ. Remove the disks from the culture dish and dip them into 20% BSA in PBS.Place sapphire disks with cells facing into the cavity of the flat specimen holders filled with 20% BSA (see Figure 2A, Verkade, 2008). The BSA functions as a cryoprotectant. Other cryoprotectants can be used, including FBS and normal goat serum [NGS]. Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the liquid present in the sample holder.",
    "The flat specimen holders are placed in a sample holder pod and tightly sealed by pressing them against a surface made of black diamond (see Figure 2).Load the sample holder in the Leica EM PACT2 with the loading stage (see Figure 2).To freeze the sample, on the touch screen press “start,” and the system starts the high pressure freezing. After freezing is complete, the pod loaded with the sample falls automatically into a liquid nitrogen bath.Check the cooling rate and the pressure rise on the screen.Place the pod holder in the socket bath of the liquid nitrogen and unscrew the pod holder, leaving frozen samples in the bottom of the bath.Following freezing, the flat specimen holders are transferred under liquid nitrogen from the EM PACT2 instrument to a Leica AFS2 freeze substitution system pre-cooled to -90°C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4080/bioprotoc-11-13-4080-g002.jpgFigure 2.

(B) A torque screwdriver was used to tighten the flat sample holder containing the sapphire disk in the pod (Step B3). (C) A pod holder was used to pick up and introduce the pod with the sample to the Leica EM PACT2 (Step B3). (D) The pod holder was charged in the loading stage of the Leica EM PACT2 (Step B4).Freeze substitution and embedding in epoxy resinNote: Always maintain the frozen samples in liquid nitrogen before loading into the freeze substitution liquid. All instruments (e.g., forceps to transfer sample to the tube containing the substitution liquid) and solutions should be precooled before use. Samples are freeze-substituted at -90°C for 24 h in a mixture of 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1% uranyl acetate, 5% water, and 2% methanol in dry acetone.",
    "The temperature is increased to -25°C at a rate of 2°C/h, and finally to 0°C in increments of 5°C/h.Following completion of the -90°C to 0°C transition, the machine can be held at 0°C for 1-2 h. This procedure increases contrast of the sample. If the duration is longer than 2 h, membranes will not be as well-preserved.All of the following steps are conducted at RT. Wash samples three times for 20 min with 1 ml dried-pure acetone.The samples were gradually infiltrated with mixtures of acetone-epoxy resin (see Recipes), increasing the concentration of resin in steps of 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% for 1 h each.For infiltration in pure epoxy resin, the sapphire disks are separated from the flat sample holders using tweezers and placed into flat-bottomed beam capsules.Capsules are filled with freshly prepared epoxy resin for polymerization at 60°C for 2 days.UltramicrotomyBeam capsules are removed using a stainless-steel blade, and the sapphire disks are separated from the resin blocks with thermal shocks. The samples are loaded into liquid nitrogen for a few seconds and then returned to room temperature. Repeat these two steps until the sapphire disks are detached from the resin blocks.Samples are cut into small pieces (~1 × 1 mm) using a stainless-steel blade and affixed to a resin block as a holder (see Figure 3).The sample surface is hand-trimmed to obtain a trapezoidal shape using a new stainless-steel blade.Collect semi-thick sections (~ 350-400 nm) using a ultramicrotome UC6 with a perfect loop and place the sections in Quantifoil® cooper grids.Note: Other types of grid can be used for ET. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4080/bioprotoc-11-13-4080-g003.jpgFigure 3. Mounting the samples for ultramicrotomy. (A) After detachment of the sapphire disc, the resin with embedded cell monolayers is cut into small pieces of about 1-mm in size.",
    "(B) The small pieces of sample are glued onto cylindrical resin blocks, which allows mounting of the sample in the sample holder of the microtome. Scale bar = 10 mm.Coating grids with fiducial markers (protein A gold spheres [10 nm diameter], PAG10) on both sides of the section for better alignment and staining with uranyl acetate. The protocol is summarized in Figure 4.Note: The fiducial markers are gold particles of 10 nm diameter required for the alignment of the tilt images during tomogram processing prior to image reconstruction. On a parafilm sheet, place one drop per sample of the protein A gold solution (see Recipes) and three drops per sample of water.Incubate the grids on the gold drops for 10 min.Sequentially lay the grids for a few seconds on the three water drops to remove excess gold solution.Absorb the excess liquid with absorbent filter paper.Repeat Steps E1-E4, incubating the other side of the grid.Let the grids dry for at least 2 h.Note: To increase the contrast of the images, stain the sections with uranyl acetate. On a parafilm sheet, place one drop of 2% uranyl acetate (see Recipes) and incubate the grids for 20 min.Wash the grids with three drops of water for a few seconds to remove the uranyl acetate.Absorb the excess liquid with filter paper.Allow the grids to dry for at least 2 h prior to imaging with an electron microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4080/bioprotoc-11-13-4080-g004.jpgFigure 4. Schematic of grid preparation prior to electron tomography. Created with BioRender.com.Electron tomographyExamine the sections using an electron microscope for reovirus egress zones, selecting and saving the regions of interest (ROIs) for the tilt series.Pre-irradiate the ROIs prior to collection of the tilt series. The electron beam produces damage in resin-embedded samples, resulting in specimen shrinkage, especially along the Z-axis (Luther et al., 1988).",
    "To avoid this problem during tomogram acquisition, it is important to pre-irradiate the ROIs, including a larger area than the ROI since outside areas could later enter in the field.Notes: About 2,000 electrons per square Angstrom at a low magnification (2,000×) of EM-irradiation is enough to allow the ROIs to assume sufficient size and stability. The ROIs should not be close to the grid bars, as the grid bars will block acquisition at high tilt angles. Single- and dual-axis ET is conducted using a Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated at 200 kV.The specimen is tilted within the electron microscope to produce transmission electron microscopy images from many different angles, resulting in a tilt series.Acquire tilt series automatically at 1° increments over an angule range of −60° to 60°. The camera parameters should be set to allow optimum resolution and contrast for the sample. In our studies, we acquired the tilt series with a nominal magnification of ×11,500, resulting in a pixel size of 1.01 nm.Images are recorded using an Eagle 4k×4k slow-scan charge-coupled device (FEI) and Tomography 3 software.To conduct dual-axis ET, collect a second tilt series after rotation of the specimen by 90° around an axis perpendicular to its support plane.Note: Dual-axis or double-tilt ET increases the information collected and reduces artifacts of acquisition and reconstruction (Mastronarde, 1997). Tomogram processingNote: The different perspectives obtained by ET are used to reconstruct a 3D view, which resolves the ultrastructure of the reovirus egress organelles in three dimensions. Download and install the IMOD software to align tilt series and obtain tomographic reconstructions.Start eTomo, providing the entries in the Setup Panel.",
    "The important parameters regarding the tilt series are:Axis type: single or dual axisFrame typePixel size and fiducial diameterTilt anglesNote: In this Setup Panel, it is possible to remove excluded views (images that are suboptimal for analysis). Once the Setup Panel is complete, activate Create Com Scripts.Preprocessing. Run Ccderaser to erase X-rays and other artifacts from the images. The X-ray model creates a fixed stack that can be saved and used.Coarse Alignment. Calculate the cross-correlation with Tiltxcorr to determine the X and Y translations required to align each image with the previous one, generating the coarse aligned stack.Fiducial Model Generation. There are several ways to generate a fiducial model. We selected well-distributed fiducials or gold beads on the zero-degree view and used Beadtrack to find their locations in the rest of the tilt series. Finally, a Seed Model was created. The seed points can be marked manually or automatically. An overview of the alignment process is shown in Figure 5.Fine Alignment. Perform the alignment using Tiltalign and examine the results in the log file after the process is complete. It is possible to view a model of the Residual Vectors, which gives an idea of the alignment quality (see Figure 5). The smaller the residual vectors, the better the alignment. A typical mean residual value of a good alignment is around 1 pixel.Tomogram Positioning. Prepare a simple model with horizontal lines across the top and bottom faces of the section at three locations in Y. It is important to delineate the thickness of the sections. After defining the edge of the section, select Find boundary model automatically, creating the Boundary Model (see Figure 5).Final Aligned Stack. Use Newstack to obtain the aligned stack.",
    "As an option, it is possible in this step to correct the microscope CTF (contrast transfer function) and filter the aligned stack.Tomogram Generation. Use Tilt to generate the tomogram.Note: In double-tilt tomography, both tomograms, called A and B, are processed separately. Tomogram A is first aligned, indicating that it is dual axis. Tomogram B is aligned with reference to tomogram A using its fiducials (matching the tomogram B to A). As a result, a combined tomogram is prepared. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4080/bioprotoc-11-13-4080-g005.jpgFigure 5. Screen captures of the IMOD software. Representative models constructed using tomogram alignment are shown.Tomogram segmentation and 3D visualizationThe tomogram segmentation and 3D visualization were conducted with the Amira Software.Load the tomogram (.rec) in the Amira interface and apply a Gaussian filter (3D type) for noise reduction.An Orthoslice can be made to visualize and compare the tomogram with the filtered tomogram.The filtered tomogram was segmented with the function LabelField, which allows the area of the different structures to be marked in the images. Labeling a structure in all images of the tomogram is tedious work, which can be simplified with the Interpolate function. The Interpolate function allows the segmentation to be done automatically after marking the images.Note: It is important to verify that the Interpolate function is working well, as occasionally manual corrections of the automatic segmentation must be made to some of the labeled images or structures. The functions Arithmetic and Isosurface were used to visualize the structures in 3D.Note: The threshold values of labeled structures are obtained using histograms for each structure. Adjusting the threshold value using Isosurface improves visualization of the reconstructions."
