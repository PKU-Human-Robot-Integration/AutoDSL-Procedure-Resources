    "All animals were housed and cared for in accordance with National and Institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Ethics approval for this protocol was granted by the University of British Columbia’s Animal Care Committee. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 300 - 450 g were used for this protocol.\n1. Donor Operation\nHave approximately 100 ml of cardioplegia (RT) in a cylindrical flask connected to long intravenous (IV) catheter tubing by a 3-way stopcock. Use a stand to elevate the flask to approximately 80cm above the operative surface, enabling cardioplegia delivery by gravity.\nTo visualize structures adequately, use either a pair of surgical loupes or a dissecting microscope.\n\tNOTE: We currently use a binocular operating microscope with 3.4 - 21.3X magnification.\nPlace the donor in an anesthetic chamber and induce anesthesia with 4 - 5% isoflurane.\nTransfer the rat to an operating platform and maintain anesthesia by nose-cone with 1 - 2% isoflurane. Apply vet ointment to the animal’s eyes to prevent dryness. Administer midazolam (2 mg/kg) intra-peritoneally with a 25 G needle.\nUsing surgical clippers, shave the donor from xiphisternum to mandible. Shave a small region of the left groin (for subsequent IV access). Apply a depilating agent to the operative surfaces, wait approximately 5 min, and remove hair with a piece of gauze.\nPrep the surgical sites with a povidone-iodine or chlorexidine-based solution (we use only chlorhexidine). Infiltrate the incisional sites with 0.1 - 0.5% lidocaine subcutaneously.\nSecure the forelimbs and left hindlimb to the operating platform with adhesive tape, leaving the right hindlimb free for monitoring of anesthetic depth and vital signs.",
    "After ensuring appropriate anesthetic depth by pedal pinch, make an incision in the left groin crease using a 22-blade scalpel. By blunt dissection, expose the left common femoral vein and obtain IV access as follows:\n\t\nGently retract the tissue overlying the femoral vein, and cannulate the vein with a 24 G IV. Connect the IV to a short length of saline-filled IV tubing, and secure the tubing in place with adhesive tape.\n\t\tNOTE: The procedure for femoral venous cannulation in rats is described elsewhere by Jespersen and colleagues14.\nConnect a saline-filled 10 ml syringe to the IV tubing, and gently aspirate blood to ensure correct positioning of the IV.\nInject 300 - 500 IU of unfractionated heparin through the IV tubing, and subsequently flush the tubing with 3 - 5 ml of saline.\nNext, tracheotomize the donor as follows:\n\t\nMake a midline incision in the soft tissues between the jugular notch and mandible using a 22-blade scalpel. Penetrate the capsule of the thyroid gland in the midline using Metzenbaum scissors, and separate its lobes using blunt dissection.\nUsing blunt dissection, separate the strap muscles of the neck in the midline to expose the anterior surface of the trachea.\nUse a curved forceps to bluntly dissect a circumferential plane around the trachea. Encircle the trachea with a 4-0 silk tie.\nUsing iris scissors, make a transverse incision in the anterior trachea, approximately 5mm inferior to the thyroid cartilage. Gently introduce the tracheal cannula (a 14 G IV) and secure it in place using the 4-0 silk tie.\nConnect the tracheal cannula to a mechanical ventilator. Redirect the flow of oxygen and isoflurane through the ventilator circuit, and ventilate the donor at a rate and tidal volume predicted by its weight13.",
    "Make an incision in the midline of the chest (using a 22-blade scalpel), extending the incision at the jugular notch to below the xipisternum.\nStaying in the midline, Perform a median sternotomy using a bone cutter. Retract the edges of the sternum with a self-retaining retractor. Enter the pericardium and pleural cavities.\nPerform a thymectomy. It is easiest to first bluntly divide the thymus in the midline, and then separate it from surrounding structures using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.\n\tNOTE: The origin of the internal thoracic arteries may be injured when dissecting the thymus away from the superior sternal edges. To prevent bleeding, hemostatic clips may be applied before removing the thymus at these points.\nUsing Metzenbaum scissors and/or a sharp Lauer, dissect peri-caval fat away from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Ensure that the IVC is relatively free of fat and connective tissue from the cavo-atrial junction superiorly, to the diaphragm inferiorly.\nUsing a sharp Lauer, circumferentially free the superior vena cava (SVC) and encircle it with a 4-0 silk tie.\nNext, dissect the left vena cava free from surrounding structures, and ligate it proximally and distally with 4-0 silk ties. Resect the intervening portion of cava to expose the left subclavian artery.\nCircumferentially free the aortic arch vessels using a sharp Lauer. Apply proximal and distal surgical clips to the innominate artery, and divide it between the clips. Leave the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery un-clipped.\nNext, cannulate the SVC with a 24 G IV catheter. Secure the catheter with the previously placed 4-0 silk tie.\nPrepare for an expedient, but gentle graft harvest.\nUsing sharp scissors, divide the IVC just superior to the diaphragmatic surface. Divide the SVC superior to its cannulation site, ensuring that nearby airway structures aren’t injured.",
    "Turn off the ventilator and disconnect the tracheal cannula. Transect the trachea proximally.\nGrasp the transected trachea with forceps, and remove the heart and lungs en-bloc. This will require gentle traction with sharp dissection as the heart-lung graft is removed. Separate the trachea from the underlying esophagus. Avoid injuring the descending aorta, so that a long portion of it remains intact after harvest.\n2. Preparation of the Heart-lung Graft\nNOTE: while completing this portion of the procedure, an assistant should be anesthetizing the recipient rodent and preparing for graft implantation.\nPlace the heart-lung graft on surgical gauze with the anterior surface of the heart facing down. Using sharp dissection, remove any residual esophagus, avoiding injury to the posterior airways.\nLocate the descending thoracic aorta and insert a 16 G blunt-tipped cannula. Secure the cannula in place with a 4-0 silk tie.\nLocate the aortic arch vessels, and apply a surgical clip to the left subclavian artery. Leave the left carotid artery un-clipped for subsequent de-airing.\nAdminister the first dose of cardioplegia by connecting the cardioplegia tubing to the 16 G aortic cannula. The carotid artery must be temporarily occluded with forceps to ensure adequate delivery of cardioplegia.\n\tNOTE: A benefit to having the aortic cannula attached is that cardioplegia may be administered continuously and/or intermittently as desired. For intermittent dosing, we typically deliver cardioplegia every 10 - 15 min in 5 ml boluses over 30 - 45 sec.\nUsing Metzenbaum scissors and/or a sharp Lauer, dissect peri-aortic fat away from the aorta. Ensure that the aorta is relatively free of fat and connective tissue from the left subclavian artery (distal arch) to its cannulation site.",
    "Next, expose the left mainstem bronchus using a sharp Lauer, and ligate it proximally with a 4-0 silk tie. Transect the left bronchus distal to the ligature using iris scissors. Perform a left pneumonectomy by ligating the left pulmonary artery and vein with 4-0 silk ties. Transect distal to the ligature and remove the left lung.\nAs above, remove all other lung lobes with the exception of the right upper and middle lobes. Avoid injuring the IVC in the process of performing lobectomies.\nConnect the cardioplegia tubing to the aortic cannula and administer continuous cardioplegia while the recipient is being prepared. Place the heart-lung graft in a sterile container (e.g., a beaker).\n3. Recipient Operation\nAnesthetize the recipient as per the donor operation, above. Use vet ointment to protect the animal’s eyes from dryness. Confirm anesthesia frequently by pedal pinch.\nPosition the animal as per the donor operation, this time leaving the right forelimb free to monitor vital signs and anesthetic depth.\nShave the abdomen from xiphisternum to penis. Shave a small region of the left groin (for subsequent IV access). Apply a depilating agent to the operative surfaces, wait approximately 5 min, and remove hair with a piece of gauze.\nPrep the surgical sites with a povidone-iodine or chlorexidine-based solution. Infiltrate the incisional sites with 0.1 - 0.5% lidocaine subcutaneously.\nTracheotomize and ventilate the recipient as directed above. Alternatively, maintain the recipient under nose-cone anesthesia.\nIntroduce a catheter into the femoral vein as described above. Inject 300 - 500 IU of unfractionated heparin through the IV tubing, and subsequently flush the tubing with 3 - 5 ml of saline.",
    "Perform a laparotomy by making a midline abdominal incision with a 22-blade scalpel from xiphisternum to penis. Retract the abdominal wall using a self-retaining retractor. Next, retract the bowels superiorly and to the rat’s left side. Wrap them in warm, saline-soaked gauze.\nExpose the IVC and abdominal aorta by sharply dissecting through the overlying retro-peritoneal fat.\nHave a curved vessel clamp available and ready.\nCircumferentially free the IVC and aorta proximally and distally and encircle them with 4-0 silk ties. There should be approximately 2 - 3 cm of space between these sites.\nCarefully apply the curved vessel clamp, ensuring that a sufficient portion of both IVC and aorta are exposed above the jaws of the clamp.\nMake an incision in the anterior wall of the IVC with a 25 G needle connected to a saline-filled 1 ml syringe. Extend the incision with Potts scissors to match the length of the donor IVC orifice.\nRemove the heart-lung graft from its container and disconnect it from cardioplegia. Place the graft in the recipient’s abdomen in an optimal position to perform the venous anastomosis.\n\tNOTE:The heart-lung graft will ultimately be oriented slightly obliquely, with the apex pointing towards the abdomen’s left lower quadrant.\nSecure the heel and toe ends of the anastomosis with 9-0 nylon suture. Tie a secure knot at each end, leaving the needle attached to a long arm of suture, and a short end of suture to be tied to later. Administer a dose of cardioplegia.\nIn running fashion, complete one-half of the suture line and tie to the opposing short suture arm. Administer a dose of cardioplegia.\nComplete the other half of the suture line and tie it down. The venous anastomosis is complete. Administer a dose of cardioplegia",
    "Orient the heart-lung graft with the heart’s apex pointing toward the abdomen’s left lower quadrant. Ensure that the venous anastomosis is not kinked or twisted.\nAssess the length of donor aorta that will be required to reach the recipient aorta, maintaining both IVC and aortic anastomoses in tension-free and un-kinked configurations.\nDivide the descending aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery) with an iris scissors.\nMake an incision in the anterior wall of the recipient aorta with a 25 G needle connected to a saline-filled 1 ml syringe. Extend the incision with Potts scissors to match the length of the donor aortic orifice.\nAnchor the toe (superior aspect) of the donor aorta to the recipient aorta using a 9-0 nylon suture. Then, pass the needle to the medial aspect of the aorta and complete one-half of the anastomosis in running fashion.\nAt the heel of the aortic anastomosis, reverse the orientation of the suture line (a transition in the direction of stitching), and complete the lateral half of the anastomosis in running fashion.\nSlowly remove the IV catheter in the SVC, and ligate the SVC with a surgical clip.\nDe-air the aorta by locating the un-clipped left common carotid artery. Hold the artery open, in an upright position that will allow air to be freely evacuated.\nBriefly open the jaws of the curved vessel clamp and allow the carotid artery to bleed (de-air) for 2 - 3 sec. Re-apply the vessel clamp.\nApply a surgical clip to the carotid artery. Remove the curved vessel clamp.\nCheck for bleeding at the suture lines. If present, apply gentle compression with surgical gauze or repair with a length of 9-0 nylon suture (depending on the severity of bleeding).\nThe donor heart should resume beating within minutes.",
    "Pay close attention to the recipient’s vital signs, depth of anesthesia, and administer volume resuscitation as needed.\nDepending on the experimental endpoints, either close the animal’s abdomen and let it recover from anesthesia, or prepare the animal for cardiovascular assessment.\n\tNOTE: Examples of graft assessment include in vivo measures of load-dependent and load-independent hemodynamics, in vitro measures of function in Langendorff and working heart modes, and (in survival surgery) echocardiographic or MRI investigations.\nAt the end of acute terminal experiments, animals are euthanized by exsanguination.\nSubscription Required.
