    "1. Designing of Target Protein\nUsing the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) obtain an amino sequence for the target protein taking into account the species of interest and any splice variants. Select the amino acid sequence that corresponds to the active region of interest of the protein.\nNote: For Sema3A, amino acids 21-747 were chosen. A fusion protein was designed with NGF where the sequence of barstar, amino acid 1-90, was added to NGF amino acids 122-241.\nTo the N-terminus add the follow sequences: 6X-His tag for purification (HHHHHH), Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cut site for removal of His tag (ENLYFQG), biotin tagged sequence for biotinylation of protein at K (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) and flexible hinge with gaps that will allow room for proper protein refolding (EFPKPSTPPGSSGGAP).\nNote: These sequences can vary depending on the desired fusion protein.\nSend complete amino acid sequence to a company for gene design/optimization for desired host species and synthesis. Subclone into a vector of choice using the BamHI-NotI site using a kit or by utilizing commercial services.\n2. Making Agar Plates\nNote: It is very important that all stocks of antibiotics, plates, buffers, etc. are stored properly (temperature and duration) and remain free of proteases (sterilized).\nWeigh out agar at 1.5 wt% and lysogeny broth (LB) at 20 g/L and place in a glass media bottle. A 500 ml bottle makes about 15 plates.\nVolumetrically add ultrapure water, mix well, and autoclave.\nLet bottle cool to the touch and add the appropriate antibiotics. Avoid premature solidification of agar; however, if bottle cools too much and solution begins to congeal, reheat in microwave.",
    "Note: Our plasmid contains an ampicillin resistance gene. Therefore, all steps must contain ampicillin at 100 µg/ml. The E. coli cloning K12 strain requires tetracycline (12.5 µg/ml) antibiotic. BL21 bacteria cells do not require any additional antibiotic.\nPour 25-30 ml of solution into 90 mm Petri dishes and allow time to dry.\nLabel dish with appropriate antibiotics and store upside-down in 4 °C, with Parafilm or in a resealable bag.\nNote: Plates are good for about one month.\n3. Cloning of the Biotin Tagged Plasmid\nNote: Conditions are done aseptically.\nSpin down plasmid vector at 6,000 x g for 3 min in order to pellet, and add 10 μl of sterilized ultrapure water.\nRemove 50 μl of chemically competent E. coli high transformation efficiency cells from -80 °C and immediately place on ice for 5-10 min.\nAdd 1 μl of vector solution at 0.5-1 ng/50 μl cells to the 50 μl E. coli cells and place the remaining plasmid in -80 °C.\nPlace the bacteria cells containing the vector on ice for 5 min.\nHeat shock the cell and vector mixture for 30-45 sec in 42 °C water bath and place cells back on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 250 μl of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) medium (2% w/v bacto-tryptone, 0.5% w/v bacto-yeast extract, 8.56 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 20 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose, ultrapure water; pH= 7.0) and shake at 250 rpm at 37 °C for 30 min.\nNote: SOC should not be autoclaved but be filter sterilized through a 0.22 µm filter.\nDry plates 10-15 min prior to plating cells.\nPipette 25, 50, and 100 μl of cell solution onto separate agar plates containing the ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and tetracycline (12.5 µg/ml) antibiotics. Use glass beads to distribute solution evenly over agar plates.",
    "Incubate plates upside-down at 37 °C for 15-18 hr.\nCheck for small individual bacteria colonies on plates and store upside-down at 4 °C until further use (Figure 2A).\n\t\nIf no colonies are present:\n\t\t\nCheck the freshness and sterility of buffers and supplies.\nIncrease the amount of plasmid added to E. coli K12 strain.\nIf large colonies are present or there is an overgrowth of colonies (Figure 2B and 2C), restreak a new agar plate using a sterile inoculation loop or plate cells at lower volume.\nInoculate 5 ml LB containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and tetracycline (12.5 µg/ml) antibiotics with a single colony of transformed E. coli cells. Grow-up cells overnight at 37 °C at 250-300 rpm.\nThe following day, use a plasmid isolation kit in order to isolate the target vector from the overnight grow-up and store purified plasmid at -80 °C until further use.\n\t\nOptional: Check purity and concentration of plasmid using absorbance reading obtained at 260 and 280 nm.\n4. Transformation of Plasmid into Expression Host\nNote: Conditions are done aseptically.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.10 for E. coli BL21 cells with the following changes:\nNote: BL21 cells do not require any additional antibiotics, therefore only ampicillin is added to the agar plates for transformation.\nAdd 2-5 μl of isolated plasmid at 0.5-2 ng/50 μl cells from step 3.12 to 50 μl E. coli expression host cells.\nHeat shock cells for 60-90 sec.\nShake solution containing SOC medium at 250 rpm for 60 min instead of 30 min.\nPluck a single colony of transformed bacteria cells from the Petri dish with a sterile applicator stick and place in a test tube containing 5 ml LB broth with the appropriate concentration of ampicillin (100 µg/ml).\nPlace test tubes in shaker overnight at 37 °C at 250 rpm.",
    "The following morning, take 200 μl of the overnight grow-up and add it to 5 ml LB containing ampicillin at 100 µg/ml.\nFreeze down the remaining cells with 250 μl 50% glycerol (sterile) to 750 μl culture and keep in -80 °C.\nNote: New test expression and scale-up procedures can be done by using a sterile applicator stick to obtain a scraping of frozen cells and inoculating LB with the appropriate antibiotics.\nPlace test tube in shaker at 250-300 rpm at 37 °C until optical density (OD) is measured between 0.7-0.8 at an absorbance of 600 nm.\nInduce cells with IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM.\nShake for an additional 4 hr at 37 °C at 300 rpm. Alternatively cells can also be shaken overnight at 18 °C at 250-300 rpm. This can produce a higher yield of plasmid depending on the target protein.\nSodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Analysis of Test Expression\n\t\nTake 500 μl of culture and place in a 1.5 ml tube. Spin down at 13-15 x g for 5 min. Pour off supernatant liquid and label \"Soluble.\" Resuspend pellet with vortexing in 200 μl of loading dye (50 μl 2-mercaptoethanol, 950 μl Laemmli sample buffer).\nNote: Soluble bacteria pellets will be used to determine if the recombinant protein is in the cytoplasmic regions of the bacteria cells. Pellets can be stored in -80 °C without loading dye until needed. A control bacteria culture that has not been transformed or induced can be treated as soluble as well for comparison.\nTake 1,000 μl of culture and place in a 1.5 ml tube. Spin down at 13-15 x g for 5 min. Pour off supernatant liquid and label \"Insoluble.\"",
    "Note: Insoluble pellets will undergo denaturation procedures below in order to release proteins found in inclusion bodies of bacteria cells. Pellets can be stored in -80 °C until needed. A control bacteria culture that has not been transformed or induced can be treated as insoluble as well for comparison.\nResuspend the insoluble pellet in 200 μl Bugbuster and leave at room temperature for 30 min.\nSpin down sample again at 13-15 x g for 5 min and take 50 μl of supernatant and add it to new \"Insoluble\" 1.5 ml tube.\nThen add 50 μl of loading dye to this new sample.\nBoil both soluble and insoluble samples for 5 min to denature proteins for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nLoad each sample into electrophoresis gel with standard ladder.\nIn order to visualize the protein samples use a staining reagent and follow the company’s protocol.\nDetermine whether the protein expresses in the soluble and/or insoluble fractions by comparing these two lanes as well as comparing the lanes to the soluble and insoluble control lanes (see Note 4.9.1 and 4.9.2) on the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2). A dark band should appear around the molecular weight of the protein in the soluble or insoluble lanes. This will determine which isolation procedure to use in Protocol 6.\nNote: If there is a band in both of these regions than either isolation used in Protocol 6 below can be performed, or the protein can be isolated both ways in order to determine which isolation method produces a higher yield of recombinant protein (Figure 3).\nIf a 4 hr and overnight induction was conducted, determine which induction method has the highest protein production for the scale-up process (Figure 2).\n5. Scale-up Procedure and Main Culture",
    "Prepare growth media with 85.7 g of Terrific Broth and 28.8 ml of 50% glycerol in 1.8 L of ultrapure water and autoclave on liquid cycle for 1 hr.\nStart an overnight culture from frozen cell stock created in step 4.5.\nNote: Conditions are done aseptically.\nMix 20 ml of LB and with a final concentration of ampicillin at 100 µg/ml in a sterile 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask.\nUsing a sterile applicator stick take a scrapping of transformed E. coli cells and drop applicator into the flask. Remove applicator stick and plug flask with foam stopper or cotton and cover with aluminum foil to maintain sterility.\nShake overnight at 250 rpm at 37 °C.\nMain Culture\nNote: Conditions are done aseptically.\nPour overnight culture into 1.8 L of sterile growth media and add ampicillin at 100 µg/ml and 6 to 8 drops of sterile antifoam 204 using a Pasteur pipette.\nPlace cultures in a 37 °C water bath with 0.2 mm filtered compressed air bubbling into cultures through aeration stones.\nOnce the OD600nm reaches 0.7-0.8, induce with IPTG (1 mM) and allow induction to occur for either 4 hr at 37 °C or overnight at 18 °C depending on soluble/insoluble results from SDS-PAGE in step 4.9.\nCollecting E. coli Cells\n\t\nSpin down the cell culture in 1 L centrifuge bottles (2 bottles/culture) for 15 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C.\nPour off supernatant and using a thin spatula, scoop the bacteria pellet into two 50 ml tubes. The cells can be pelleted again by centrifugation for a few minutes.\nNote: Each 1.8 L culture will result in two bacteria pellets, one in each 50 ml centrifuge tube.\nStore pellets in -80 C until protein isolation.\n6. Isolation and Purification of Recombinant Protein",
    "Note: If the protein is located in the soluble region based of SDS-PAGE Analysis from step 4.9 then \"Native Isolation\" will be used, but for insoluble proteins \"Nonnative Isolation\" procedures will be performed.\nCell Lysis\n\t\nNonnative\n\t\t\nRemove transformed E. coli pellet from -80 °C freezer, and add 20 ml Lysis/Wash Buffer (Table 1) to each centrifuge tube.\nVortex and shake the frozen pellet until it thaws and solubilizes into the buffer solution without any large chunks. Incubate on nutator overnight. The following morning, the pellet should now be a viscous slurry due to the denaturing of the protein from the buffer.\nCentrifuge the slurry at 20,500 x g at room temperature for 30 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for isolation and discard the pellet.\nNative\n\t\t\nObtain transformed E. coli pellet from -80 °C freezer.\nAdd Lysis Buffer (Table 1) to centrifuge tube to reach a final volume of 30 ml, and dislodge frozen pellet by vortexing and shaking rigorously. Place pellet on ice.\nWash sonicator probe with 70% ethanol at 100% amplitude for 1-2 min. Then repeat with ultrapure water.\nSonicate bacteria pellet while on ice for 5 min (total elapsed time of 10 min).\n\t\t\t\nSet sonicator at 30% amplitude with pulse of 30 sec on/30 sec off.\nBob centrifuge tube up and down during sonication interval in order to completely break up the cell pellet. At the end of the total elapsed time there should be no visible bacteria pellet leaving a stringy, viscous slurry.\nClean the sonicator probe between different protein isolations as well as for storage using 70% ethanol and ultrapure water as described in step 6.1.2.3.\nCentrifuge the slurry at 20,500 x g at 4 °C for 30 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for isolation and discard the pellet.",
    "Ni-NTA Affinity Chromatography\n\t\nNonnative\n\t\t\nAdd 1 ml Ni2+-NTA resin solution to each centrifuge tube (2 ml resin total for a 1.8 L culture) and incubate at RT for at least 1 hr on nutator.\nPour slurry into affinity column and allow solution to drip through stopcock valve completely into waste beaker.\nPerform 10 washes with 10 ml of Lysis/Wash Buffer for each wash.\n\t\t\t\nFor the first two washes, add the 10 ml to the centrifuge tube to remove additional resin and then pour into column. The additional washes can be added directly to column.\nAfter each wash, stir the resin with a glass stirring rod. Once the wash drips into the waste beaker, the next 10 ml can be added.\nAfter wash completely drips through, close stopcock valve, remove waste beaker and replace with 50 ml centrifuge tube for protein collection.\nAdd 15 ml of Elution Buffer (Table 1) and stir-up resin, allowing solution to sit for 5 min. Open stopcock valve and collect elution. Repeat again with an additional 15 ml.\nNative\n\t\t\nFollow the Nonnative Affinity Chromatography above (Steps 6.2.1.1-6.2.1.4) except adjust the following parameters:\n\t\t\t\nIncubate Ni2+-NTA resin solution at 4 °C for at least 1 hr on nutator.\nUse the appropriate Wash Buffer (Table 1).\nAdd 5 ml of Elution Buffer (Table 1) and incubate with resin for 5 min.\n\t\t\t\nOpen stopcock valve and collect elution until most of the solution has dripped through.\nAdd 90 μl/well of Bradford reagent to clear 96-well plate. After each elution allow 10 μl of solution to drip from column into well containing 90 μl Bradford reagent.\nContinue adding 5 ml Elution Buffer at a time until Bradford assay no longer detects protein (color goes from dark blue to light blue to clear). This usually takes 4-5 elution volumes.\nDialysis/Renaturation",
    "Make nonnative (renaturation) and native dialysis buffers (Table 1) and store in 4 °C.\nNote: The pH of the dialysis buffers are determined by the target protein’s isoelectric point (pI). As a rule of thumb proteins should be buffered at least one full point above or below their pI values.\nTransfer native and nonnative elutions to dialysis tubing with appropriate molecular weight cutoff (25,000 MWCO for NGF and 50,000 MWCO for Sema3A). Place each protein sample in respective dialysis buffer 1 for 4 hr at 4 °C and then replace with the respective buffer 2 overnight at 4 °C.\nNote: Protein needs to be dialyzed in each buffer for at least 4 hr for proper refolding and buffer exchange to take place.\nConcentrate the dialyzed protein elutions to less than 5 ml using centrifuge spin concentrators.\nNote: Proteins can further be purified by using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and concentrated again.\nDetermine protein concentration (mg/ml) by freeze drying a 10-50 ml sample in a preweighed microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\nOptional: determine the extinction coefficient, ε, so that concentration of protein can be determined in future isolations by measuring the absorbance of a sample at 280 nm using Beer-Lambert’s Law: c=A280nm/εl, where l is the path length.\n7. Biotinylation of Purified Protein\nDialyze proteins in 10,000 MWCO dialysis cassettes against 10 mM Tris (pH=8.0), changing the buffer every 4 hr with a total of 6 changes.\nTransfer the recombinant proteins (now in 10 mM Tris buffer) to 2 ml micro-centrifuge tubes for biotinylation.\nBiotinylate proteins using a biotin protein ligase kit.\nDialyze proteins against PBS (pH=7.4) using 10,000 MWCO dialysis cassettes with 3 buffer changes a day for 2 days.\nDetermine the percent biotinylation of proteins using a quantitation kit.",
    "Determine the concentration again as described in 6.4 and store at 4 °C or aliquot and store at -20 °C for long term storage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
