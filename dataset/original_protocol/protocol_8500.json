    "All procedures were approved by the local research ethics committee of the Higher School of Economics (HSE), Moscow, with consent from all participants.\nNOTE: Participants must report no history of implanted metal devices, neurological or psychiatric disease, drug abuse or alcoholism. TMS is used according to the most recent safety guidelines20. Subjects must be fully informed of the nature of the research and sign an informed consent form before starting the experiment. We show an entire set of equipment needed to run the online-combined tACS-TMS protocol by stimulation of the dominant M1 ( Figure 1; Table of Materials).\n1. Place Electromyography (EMG) Electrodes in a Bipolar Belly-tendon Montage\nClean the skin using a cleaning scrub under all the electrodes to achieve low skin impedance (below 10 kOhm).\nPlace the active EMG electrode on the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, reference electrode on the bone 2 cm distally and the ground electrode more proximally on the arm.\n2. Identifying the Target for the Stimulation Protocol\nNOTE: Here, we use the frameless TMS navigation system to achieve a proper positioning of the TMS coil.\nPlace the tracking sensors over the glabella between the eyebrows and above the nose of the participant.\nOpen the navigation system software. Use individual participants' structural T1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and perform a co-registration of the participant's head and a 3D MRI head via the navigation system.\nAccurately, place the coil over the primary motor hand-area, the so called \"motor knob\" region (Figure 2).",
    "Start applying single pulse TMS and test MEPs; TMS is delivered by a stimulator (see Table of Materials) connected to a standard figure-of-eight 75-mm coil. To localize the \"hotspot\" of the left M1, hold the coil tangential to the scalp, with the handle pointing backward and laterally, angled at 45Â° from the midline sagittal axis of the participant's head.\nOnce the hotspot (i.e., the scalp point eliciting MEPs at threshold from the contralateral examined hand muscles) is found, mark it with a pencil to facilitate the application of the tACS target electrode.\n3. tACS Electrodes Preparation\nConnect 2 surface saline-soaked sponge electrodes (size: 5 cm x 7 cm) to the stimulation device, which can generate electrical alternating current (e.g., Brainstim).\nIn order to minimize skin sensation, constantly saturate the electrodes with a saline solution to keep impedances below 10 kOhm throughout the whole stimulation session.\n4. tACS Protocol Set Up\nTo set up the tACS protocol using the stimulator device, first check the battery status.\nUsing the software, open a new session and manage a new stimulation protocol.\nName the protocol (e.g., \"Beta\").\nSet the frequency of the stimulation (e.g., 20 Hz).\nChoose the waveform (e.g., sinusoidal).\nSet the total duration of the stimulation protocol (e.g., 600 s).\nFinally, set the intensity of stimulation (e.g., 1 mA), set offset, fade in, fade out, and phase at \"0\".\n\t\tNOTE: A little timing to fade in and out the stimulation (around 30 s) can be suggested, in order to avoid any adverse or uncomfortable neurosensory effects for the subject.\nActivate the device's \"Bluetooth\" function and upload the protocol from the software to the stimulator.\n5. tACS Electrodes Montage",
    "Place the \"target\" electrode over the scalp corresponding to the marked point. Place the \"reference\" electrode over the ipsilateral shoulder by using specific sticky tape, in a \"monopolar montage\"21.\nCarefully adjust the first elastic strap on the head with respect to the neuro-navigation head-sensors position. Then, by using the second strap, fix the target electrode position.\nOnce tACS electrodes are placed both on the scalp and on the ipsilateral shoulder, connect them to the stimulator.\nBefore the start of the stimulation session, ensure by visual inspection that position of the target electrode is centered over the marked hotspot.\n6. Identifying the Resting Motor Threshold (RMT)\nPlace the TMS coil over the target tACS electrode and carefully adjust the coil position over the hotspot (Figure 3) by using the neuro-navigation system.\nMeasure the RMT accordingly to the combined tACS-TMS setup (i.e., TMS coil over the electrode). Specifically, adjust the TMS intensity with respect to the thickness of the tACS electrode in order to check for a reliable RMT.\nMeasure the RMT individually, it is defined as the minimum intensity required to induce an MEP in the FDI muscle with an amplitude of 50 mV (peak-to-peak) in 5 out of 10 trials22.\nSet the intensity of the TMS stimulation at 110% of the RMT in order to start the experimental session.\n7. Experimental Procedure\nOpen the EMG software and start EMG recording.\nStart the tACS stimulation.\nDuring the stimulation, deliver TMS single pulses interspersed by random intervals from 3 to 5 seconds.\nEnsure that each session of the stimulation (e.g., 20 Hz tACS stimulation followed by a sham/another control frequency) lasts no more than 90 seconds with an inter-session interval around 3 minutes, in order to avoid possible carryover effect of the preceding stimulation frequency/condition11,13.",
