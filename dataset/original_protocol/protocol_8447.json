    "The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo, Taoyuan, Taiwan (102-2577A3).\n1. Preparation of the NR1-GFP Expression Plasmid\nMix 10 ng of NR1-GFP plasmid with 100 µL of Escherichia coli competent cells strain DH5α in a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, pipet the mixture gently up and down 4-6 times, and incubate the tube on ice for 20 min.\nIncubate the tube at 42 °C for 1 min in a water bath, remove the tube from the water bath, add 1 mL lysogeny broth (LB) medium into the tube, and incubate the tube at 37 °C in an incubator with shaking for 1 h.\nSpread 50 µL of the mixture onto an LB agar plate containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL), and incubate the LB agar plate at 37 °C in an incubator overnight.\nPick a single colony from the overnight LB agar plate using a sterile tip, and swirl the tip in a in a bacterial culture tube containing 5 mL of LB medium and ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL). Incubate the tube at 37 °C in an incubator with shaking overnight.\nAliquot 3 mL of the overnight bacterial culture into a 500 mL flask that contains 250 mL sterile LB medium and ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL). Incubate the flask at 37 °C with shaking. Check regularly the optic density (OD) of the bacterial culture at wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrometer until the OD600 reaches 0.6-1.0.\n\tNOTE: Mix well 800 µL of the overnight bacterial culture with 200 µL glycerol to prepare the glycerol stock, and store the glycerol stock under -80 °C for future use.\nPrepare NR1-GFP expression plasmid from the 250 mL bacterial culture\n\t\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.",
    "Resuspend the bacteria pellet in 10 mL resuspension buffer containing RNase A; vortex thoroughly until no clump is seen.\nAdd 10 mL lysis buffer to the bacterial suspension, gently invert the mixture 4-6 times, and incubate the lysate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL pre-chilled precipitation buffer to the lysate, gently invert the mixture 4-6 times.\nPour the lysate into the barrel of a filter cartridge with the cap on; wait for 10 min at RT.\nRemove the cap from the cartridge outlet nozzle, insert a plunger into the cartridge, and gently press the plunger. Collect the filtered lysate into a 50 mL tube.\nAdd 2.5 mL proprietary buffer from the manufacturer to the filtered lysate, mix the mixture by inverting the tube approximately 10 times, and incubate the mixture on ice for 30 min.\nApply the filtered lysate mixture to a filter column that was pre-equilibrated with 10 mL equilibration buffer. Allow the column to drain by gravity.\nWash the column with 30 mL wash buffer twice, then elute DNA from the column using 15 mL elution buffer.\nAdd 10.5 mL (0.7 volumes) isopropanol to the eluted DNA buffer, mix well, and centrifuge the mixture at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nDecant the supernatant carefully, wash the DNA pellet with 5 mL endotoxin-free 70% ethanol once, and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min.\nDecant the supernatant, dry the pellet for 5-10 min in a chemical hood, and dissolve the pellet in 300-500 µL of endotoxin-free buffer.\nDetermine the plasmid concentration by measuring the absorption of the solution at UV 260/280 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare the expression plasmid GFP using the same protocol.\n2. Transfection of HEK293 Cells with NR1-GFP Expression Plasmid",
    "Aliquot 200 µL of 2% gelatin solution to each well of a 48-well culture plate and incubate the plate at 37 °C for at least 30 min.\nAspirate the gelatin solution from the well, and seed 5 x 104 HEK293 cells in 200 µL of cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 overnight.\n\tNOTE: Cells were counted using a hemocytometer.\nOn the next day, replace the spent culture medium with 200 µL of fresh culture medium containing 10% FBS per well.\nFor each single well, prepare solution A by mixing 100 ng of NR1-tGFP plasmid with 20 µL culture medium, and solution B by mixing 0.8 µL transfection reagent with 20 µL culture medium. Multiply the number of wells needed to prepare the total volume for each experiment.\nPrepare solution C by mixing solution A and solution B, and incubate the mixture at RT for 20-30 min.\nAliquot 40 µL of solution C to each well containing the HEK293 cells, swirl the plate gently, and incubate the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 overnight.\nCheck the expression of NR1-GFP recombinant protein in the host cells under fluorescent microscope with 40X-200X magnification (excitation/emission: 482/502 nm), and proceed to the cell-based immunofluorescence assay.\n\tNOTE: Transfect the expression plasmid GFP into the HEK293 cells using the same protocol.\n3. Cell-based Immunofluorescence Assay\nAspirate the spent medium from the wells, then wash each well with 200 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times.\nAdd 200 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde solution to each well; incubate the plate at RT for 15 min.",
    "Aspirate the paraformaldehyde solution from the wells, and wash each well with 200 µL of PBS three times.\nAdd 200 µL of 10% skim milk in PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) solution to each well, and incubate the plate at RT for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nAspirate the 10% skim milk in PBST solution from the well, then wash the wells with 200 µL PBST once.\nIncubate the wells with diluted plasma (1:100 in PBST) as the primary antibody with gentle shaking at RT for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Plasma is obtained from the blood of patients suspected to have autoimmune encephalitis.\nAspirate the diluted plasma from the wells, and wash each well with 200 µL of PBST three times.\nAdd 200 µL of goat anti-human IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,000 dilution in PBST) to each well, and incubate the culture plate at RT with gentle shaking for 1 h.\nAspirate the goat anti-human IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 solution, and wash each well with 200 µL of PBST three times.\nAdd 100 µL glycerol solution (50% glycerol in PBS and 1:100,000 of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)) to each well.\nObserve and image the cells under a fluorescent microscope using a 10X eyepiece, and 4X, 10X, and 20X objectives.\n\tNOTE: Use the correct filter for each dye: for NR1-GFP (excitation/emission = 482/502 nm), for Alexa Fluor 594 (excitation/emission = 561/594 nm), for DAPI (excitation/emission = 358/461 nm). Conduct the negative control using the HEK cells expressing GFP in the same way.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
