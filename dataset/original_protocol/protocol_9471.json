    "1. Splat Apparatus Setup\nFill a temperature-programmable circulating water bath with ethylene glycol (50% v/v in water).\n\tNOTE: Green automotive ethylene glycol can be used.\nTo assemble the external chamber, use insulated plastic tubing to attach the water bath to a double-walled glass bowl. Insulate the glass bowl with polystyrene foam and cover with a plastic petri dish lid. Cut a 3-4 inch hole in the bottom of the polystyrene chamber so that the light source can be seen through the glass chamber.\nMount the external chamber on a dissection microscope, fitted with a camera port and a 4X polarized objective lens with a 10x ocular lens. Place an additional piece of polarized film in the bottom of the external chamber.\nClamp a 1-1.5 m tube (~5 cm diameter) onto a retort stand and place inside a large polystyrene container, along with a cooling block positioned underneath the tube at the base of the retort stand.\n2. Preparation of Native Protein Extracts for IRI Analysis\nTo induce the expression of IBPs in freeze-tolerant grasses or other freeze-tolerant plant species, cold acclimate plants for up to 1 week at 4 °C, under low light conditions (6 h light/ 18 h dark). This does not apply to samples collected from the field that have already been exposed to low temperature conditions and acclimation periods.\nObtain approximately 0.1 g of leaf tissue by cutting at the base of the stem and then place in a 1.5 mL tube. Immediately flash freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until use.\nTo lyse cells, grind tissue sample into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Ensure that the liquid nitrogen does not evaporate during the homogenization process.",
    "Immediately place ground samples on ice and allow the liquid nitrogen to completely evaporate. Add 1 mL of a native protein extraction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 25 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), with two EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets added immediately before use. Pipette to mix; do not vortex.\n\tNOTE: Additional additives may need to be used if the lysate contains secondary metabolites (see Discussion).\nGently shake samples overnight (18-24 h) at 4 °C. Conduct the remaining steps at 4 °C.\nRemove cellular debris by centrifuging samples at ~16,000 x g for 5 min. Retain the soluble fraction and centrifuge for an additional 5 min if cellular debris persists. Clarified samples can be stored at -20 °C until use.\n3. Splat Assay Pre-experiment Set up\nPour 100 mL of hexane into external chamber set up with the polarized film and add 5-6 desiccation beads to prevent moisture build up on the slides. Add a small amount of vacuum grease to the plate covering the bath and twist to ensure a tight seal and prevent evaporation of the hexane.\nCool the hexane bath between -4 °C and -6 °C using the programmable water bath approximately 2-3 h before starting the experiment. Make sure to check the temperature of the hexane with a thermometer prior to beginning the experiment.\nPlace the cooling block in a polystyrene box directly below the plastic tube and cover completely with dry ice, 40 min prior to starting the experiment.\nBefore beginning the assay, ensure that the tube is level. To determine where on the cooling block the sample will drop, first test the procedure with water and indicate where the sample drops with a marker (as described below).",
    "Remove dry ice from the top of the cold block and place a glass microscope cover slide on the drop mark that has been determined with water.\nImmediately before starting assay, turn on the light source and scrape any ice that has formed on the bottom of the glass chamber. Avoid keeping the light source on unless ice crystals are being visualized to prevent heating the hexane.\n4. Conducting the Splat Assay\nDip the disposable tip affixed to an automatic pipette (1-20 µL) in immersion oil, using a paper towel remove any excess oil. This step will allow the sample to fall rather than adhere to the outside of the pipette.\n\tNOTE: Removing excess oil from the pipette is critical to ensure that oil droplets do not form on the ice crystals, making visualization difficult.\nPipette 10 µL of sample and place pipette directly over plastic tubing before releasing the sample. A distinct 'splat' sound should be heard when the sample hits the glass cover slide, creating a monolayer of ice crystals.\nQuickly and carefully remove the microscope slide from the cold block using tweezers and place in the hexane bath on top of the polarizing film.\nLooking under the microscope, put the microscope slide into the field of view and adjust the objective lens so that the cross-polarization allows for the visualization of high contrast ice crystals. Adjust magnification to 40x.\nAttach the camera to the microscope and adjust the settings to \"macro\" to allow clear visualization of ice crystals and capture the image.\n\tNOTE: Waiting up to 1 h to allow ice crystals to grow can give a clearer picture.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.5 for all samples. Typically, place up to 6 slides with a different sample in the hexane chamber.",
    "Turn off the light source and place a plastic plate over the hexane bath, ensuring a tight seal. Allow ice crystals to anneal overnight (12-24 h, keeping a consistent annealing period within a particular assay). Following incubation, capture images of the ice films as described above.\n\tNOTE: Some samples may recrystallize more quickly than others. If no recrystallization is apparent after 12 h, allow crystals to anneal for up to 24 h to ensure that no recrystallization will occur.\n5. Splat Assay Data Analysis\nUpload the photos to a computer and directly compare the size of ice crystals before and after annealing. Samples with ice recrystallization activity will not grow, whereas samples without no IRI activity will recrystallize forming noticeably larger ice crystals. Light interference will make large ice crystals appear in slightly different hues and thus are easy to see.\n6. Ice-affinity Purification Equipment Setup\nFill a temperature-programmable circulating water bath with ethylene glycol. Green automotive ethylene glycol can be used.\nConnect the bath to a hollow, brass probe using insulated plastic tubing15.\nConstruct a polystyrene container into which a 150 mL beaker can fit snuggly. Create a lid for the container with a hole in the center for the brass cold finger.\n7. Preparation of Samples for Ice-affinity Purification\nCold acclimate plant tissue as described in section 2.1.\nCollect ~100-150 g of the ground biomass (step 2.3) in 20 mL tubes and immediately flash freeze. Samples can be kept at -80 °C before use.\nPrepare sample as described in sections 2.3-2.5. Use a 1:1 ratio (mg of tissue: mL of native protein extraction buffer) for resuspension of leaf tissue. Use additional protease inhibitor tablets to avoid the degradation of IBPs by endogenous proteases.",
    "NOTE: If the tissue sample is too concentrated, adjust the ratio to 1:2 or 1:3 (mg of tissue: mL of native protein extraction buffer).\nTo remove cellular debris, sieve lysate through 2 layers of cheesecloth, 3 times. Pellet the debris by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 40 min at 4 °C.\nIncrease the volume of sample to 120 mL using native protein extraction buffer. Use the lysate immediately for ice-affinity purification to avoid any loss of ice-binding activity.\n8. Conducting Ice-affinity Purification\nPrior to purification, set the programmable water bath to cool from -0.5 °C to -3 °C at a rate of -0.04 °C/h.\n\tNOTE: The cooling rate can be adjusted depending on the initial volume of sample.\nCool the ice finger to -0.5 °C and subsequently submerse it into a 50 mL tube containing cold distilled water. Add a few ice chips to facilitate ice nucleation and allow a thin layer of ice to form on the finger. This process typically takes between 20 and 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Any lumps on the ice-coated finger should be smoothed with a gloved hand prior to placing in sample. If an ice layer does not form at -0.5 °C, lower the temperature to -0.75 °C.\nPlace sample in a 150 mL glass beaker containing a small magnetic stir bar into a polystyrene container on top of the magnetic stirrer. Make sure that the ice finger is centered and lowered at least half way into the liquid sample. Seal the container.\nAllow the program to run for approximately two days, checking every 24 h. Once 50% of the sample is frozen, stop the program. Incorporation of IBPs into the ice hemisphere will result in \"ice-etching\".",
    "NOTE: Purification experiments can be done using larger sample volumes with the length of time at which the program runs adjusted accordingly.\nIn order to remove the ice hemisphere, warm the probe to 4 °C, rinse the hemisphere with distilled water to remove unbound protein, and then thaw at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Most IBPs are not stable in water and an appropriate buffer (i.e. 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 or 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8) will need to be added periodically during the thawing process (approximately 1 mL/2 h). Ice hemispheres can be wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at -20 °C prior to thawing.\nIf the ice-hemisphere still contains pigment, or to increase the sample purification, repeat steps 8.1-8.5 2-3 times.\n\tNOTE: Although the concentration of IBP may be lower following multiple rounds of purification, purity is more valuable than yield if the purified samples will be analyzed using MS. If sufficient material is available, three rounds of ice-affinity purification is recommended.\n9. Identification of IBPs\nSince IBPs are contained in a large volume following thawing of the ice-hemisphere, concentrate the samples. Concentrate samples containing ~100 g of tissue to ~1-3 mL using centrifugal concentration tubes with a 3,000 Da molecular weight cut-off to avoid the loss of small proteins.\nPrior to sending samples for MS, determine the protein concentration using a protein quantification assay such as a BCA or Bradford assay. Estimate the purity of samples by gel electrophoresis such as SDS-PAGE. Test the purified proteins for IRI activity prior to sending for MS to ensure that active protein has been retained through the purification and concentration steps.\nUse concentrated samples directly for mass spectrometry analysis10.\nSubscription Required.
