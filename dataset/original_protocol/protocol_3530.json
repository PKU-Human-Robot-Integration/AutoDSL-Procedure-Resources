Data from these replicates is averaged to afford a single assay result. Then, the entire screening is repeated twice using freshly made substrate and enzyme dilutions, and data are reported as the average of both results (n = 2 independent experiments).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_452_5.csv\nNE, no enzyme added.\nNote: Stock solution concentrations are provided with a number in parenthesis (e.g., 2×) that refers to how many times it will be diluted to achieve the final assay concentration.\nNote: Experiments are performed in a volume of 25 μL per well, followed by addition of 25 μL of developer solution.\nOptional: Include known enzyme‒substrate pairs in the screening as positive controls. For example: LGKac (1a) for HDACs 1‒3 and 6 (Wegener et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), LGKtfa (1b) for HDACs 4, 5 and 7‒9 (Bradner et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), or QPKKmyr (5e) for SIRTs 1‒3 (Chiang and Lin, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPrepare substrate stocks in BSA-containing Tris assay buffer at 83.3 μM concentration (1.78×).\nPrepare enzyme stocks in BSA-containing Tris assay buffer at 125 nM concentration (2.5×).\nOptional: Prepare 200 μL extra of enzyme stocks and use a liquid reservoir and a multichannel pipette for addition of the enzyme (point 5).\nNote: Keep enzyme solutions on ice as much as possible.\nAdd 15 μL of 1.78× substrate stocks to the corresponding wells of half-area black 96-well plates (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for a plate layout example).",
    "Add 10 μL of BSA-containing assay buffer to the control wells (where no enzyme will be added).\nAdd 10 μL of 2.5× enzyme stocks to the corresponding wells.\nCover the plates with a transparent sticker and incubate at 37°C for 60 min with gentle shaking (e.g., 750 rpm).\nTake out the plates from the incubator, remove the sticker, and add 25 μL of trypsin solution (5.0 mg/mL) to every well.\nCover the plates again and let them stand at 25°C for 90 min for development.\nRead the fluorescence from each well using a plate reader.\nCalculate the average fluorescence of each replicate pair.\nFor each experiment, subtract background fluorescence from the corresponding control wells without enzyme added (always subtract the background from the same substrate, because background fluorescence may change with chemical structure).\nRepeat steps 1–11.\nRepresent data as average ± SEM of both screenings (n = 2 independent experiments) using a data analysis software (e.g., GraphPad Prism), as bar graphs for individual enzymes or as a heatmap (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/452-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representation of screening data as a heatmap\nSince only mean values are included, supplementary raw data or bar graphs should be reported for such representations. Heatmap reprinted with permission from Moreno-Yruela et al. (2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nOptional: A 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorescence standard curve can be obtained by preparing dilutions of free AMC fluorophore in BSA-containing assay buffer and measuring the fluorescence with the plate reader. This standard curve can be added to the data-processing software and used to convert fluorescence units into AMC concentration for each experiment, which corresponds to amount of substrate converted. In GraphPad Prism, this can be done using the function “Transform ‒ User-defined Y function.”",
    "Optional: Represent screening data as a heatmap. In order to highlight differences in conversion, manually select range intervals that would differentiate most of the values in the heatmap (in GraphPad Prism, select “Colormap: categorical”). Change the color of each interval so that differences are clearly visible in web and in print versions (color advice sites such as colorbrewer2.org[href=http://colorbrewer2.org] can be used as inspiration). Here, Adobe Illustrator was used to add frames, adjust the legend, and organize the labels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nBuffer optimization\nTiming: 2‒4 h\nThe selected HDAC(s) and substrate(s) are incubated in Tris of HEPES buffer with varying amounts of BSA to find optimal assay conditions (e.g., 0.00‒0.50 mg/mL). These conditions can then be applied for testing of future enzyme batches or for inhibition/activation experiments.\nNote: Experiments are performed in a volume of 25 μL per well, followed by addition of 25 μL of developer solution.\nPrepare Tris and HEPES buffers with different concentrations of BSA (for example, 0.5 mg/mL and 0.05 mg/mL) (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPrepare corresponding trypsin solutions in each assay buffer.\nOptional: Depending on the peptide sequence of the selected substrate(s), the concentration and development time with trypsin may vary. This can be tested by measuring fluorescence at several time points during the development phase and checking when the maximum signal stays constant. For example, development of Ac-Gln-Pro-Lys-Lys-AMC (QPKK) requires 90 min incubation with a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL of trypsin (5.0 mg/mL trypsin stock), whereas Ac-Leu-Gly-Lys-AMC (LGK) and Ac-Glu-Thr-Asp-Lys-AMC (ETDK) can be developed in 15 min with a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL of trypsin (0.4 mg/mL tryspin stock) (Galleano et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "Repeat steps 1‒13 for the selected enzymes and substrates, with the following modifications: prepare substrate and enzyme stocks in each of the BSA-containing assay buffers (steps 1 and 2), and develop each experiment with the matching trypsin solution (step 7).\nOptimization of trypsin concentration for time-course experiments\nTiming: 3–6 h\nSmall amounts of trypsin are added from the beginning of the experiment in order to record substrate conversion in real time. Trypsin concentration requires optimization, so that the recorded rate corresponds to that of the deacylation reaction (too low trypsin concentration limits the reaction rate to that of trypsin) and to be able to measure the steady state for the longest time possible (too high trypsin concentration can compromise enzyme stability).\nNote: Experiments are performed in a volume of 50 μL per well.\nPrepare trypsin stocks (5×) in the selected BSA-containing assay buffer at decreasing concentrations (for example: 1,000, 500, 250 and 125 μg/mL).\nPrepare a 333 μM or 666 μM substrate stock in BSA-containing assay buffer (3.33×).\nPrepare enzyme stocks (2×) in the selected BSA-containing assay buffer at decreasing concentrations (for example: 200, 20, and 2 nM).\nAdd 15 μL of 3.33× substrate stock to every well (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for a plate layout example).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_452_6.csv\nNE, no enzyme added.\nAdd 10 μL of the corresponding 5× trypsin stocks to the wells.\nAdd 25 μL of BSA-containing assay buffer to the negative control wells.\nMake sure the plate reader is set up with the time-course experiment ready to be launched (in order to measure fluorescence as soon as possible after enzyme addition).\nAdd 25 μL of the corresponding 2× enzyme stocks to the wells, place the plate in the plate reader, and start recording fluorescence of each well every 30 s.",
    "Critical: Fast addition of enzyme is advised to avoid different starting times between experiments. A repetitive or multichannel pipette can be used for this purpose.\nRecord fluorescence for 30‒60 min, or until progression curves are not linear (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/452-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of data obtained for the optimization of trypsin concentration, with associated linear regression curves\nHere, enzyme concentrations of 4, 2, and 1 nM were incubated with substrate 6e (ETDKmyr, 60 μM) and trypsin at 200, 100, 50, or 25 μg/mL concentration. Sample data corresponding to 4 nM enzyme concentration is used to highlight examples of long lag phase and of loss of linearity. Data points not fitting to a linear regression should be excluded in order to obtain an accurate measure of the steady state. Data represent mean ± SD of 2 internal replicates.\nPlot fluorescence measurements vs. time and calculate initial rates for each experiment (in GraphPad Prism, this can be done with “Analyze” – “Nonlinear regression” – “Straight line”).\nExclude data points at the start and end of the assay whenever they do not fit a linear trend, because lack of linearity indicates that the system is not in steady state (Stein, 2011a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nNote: At low concentrations of trypsin, it is common to observe a long “lag phase” until the deacylated substrate is accumulated and steady-state fluorophore release is reached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Avoid choosing such conditions for future experiments, if possible.",
    "Find a concentration of enzyme at which assay progression curves are obtained with appropriate signal-to-noise ratio, but not as high as to consume all substrate within the assay time frame. Ideally, fluorescence units should increase to at least 2-fold higher values than the background signal during the first 15 min of reaction, and the error obtained between internal replicates should be smaller than the fluorescence increase during a period of 2‒3 min.\nFor the set concentration of enzyme, find the lowest trypsin concentration at which the conversion rate remains unchanged. This should also be the concentration at which linearity is kept for the longest period of time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Lower conversion rates indicate that the fluorophore release by trypsin, and not the deacylation event, is the rate-limiting step of the experiment.\nOptional: Fine-tune enzyme and trypsin concentrations in order to extend assay linearity and/or spare material (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nDetermination of Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters\nTiming: 1–2 days\nWith the optimized time-course assay conditions, the selected HDAC is incubated with substrate at different concentrations, and the initial conversion rates are used to calculate kinetic parameters. These are critical for the design of continuous or discontinuous inhibition assays (Moreno-Yruela et al., 2019b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), and for the accurate comparison of substrates.\nNote: Experiments are performed in a volume of 50 μL per well.\nPrepare a trypsin stock (3.33×) in BSA-containing assay buffer at the chosen concentration.\nPrepare a 1 mM substrate stock (5×) and 10 additional dilutions (1.5-fold, 1,000‒17.3 μM) in BSA-containing assay buffer.\nOptional: Use a clear V-bottom 96-well plate for the dilution series. This will allow dilution of several substrates at a time, detection of substrate precipitation, and facilitate the transfer to the assay plate using a multichannel pipette.\nPrepare an enzyme stock (2×) in BSA-containing assay buffer at the chosen concentration.",
    "Add 10 μL of the corresponding 5× substrate stocks to each well (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for a plate layout example).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_452_7.csv\nNE, no enzyme added.\nAdd 15 μL of 3.33× trypsin stock to every well.\nAdd 25 μL of BSA-containing assay buffer to the negative control wells.\nMake sure the plate reader is set up with the time-course experiment ready to be launched (in order to measure fluorescence as soon as possible after enzyme addition).\nAdd 25 μL of the 2× enzyme stock to the corresponding wells, place the plate in the plate reader, and start recording fluorescence of each well every 30 s.\nCritical: Fast addition of enzyme is advised to avoid different starting times between experiments. A repetitive or multichannel pipette can be used for this purpose.\nRecord fluorescence for 30‒60 min, or until progression curves are not linear (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/452-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of kinetic data and fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation\nKinetic evaluation of (A) substrate ETDKmyr (6e) for HDAC11 (Moreno-Yruela et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and (B) substrate LGKac (1a) for HDAC3. HDAC11 experiments were linear for up to 65 min, whereas HDAC3 only retained linearity for 25 min (progression data represent mean ± SD of 2 internal replicates). XY data sheets are created with substrate concentrations and corresponding slopes from at least 2 experiments, and data are fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to generate the represented curves (steady-state data represent mean ± SEM of 2 individual experiments). 1.5-fold dilutions of substrate concentration are preferred, as in B, for better definition of the curve and calculation of KM and kcat parameters.

    "Plot fluorescence measurement replicates (Y) vs. time (X). In GraphPad Prism, label each Y column with the corresponding substrate concentration, as these labels will be used for later calculations.\nOptional: In case of having obtained a standard curve, transform fluorescence units into [AMC] with it. In GraphPad Prism, use “Transform” – “User-defined Y functions” and the custom function.\nCalculate initial rates for each experiment by fitting data to a linear regression. In GraphPad Prism, use “Analyze” – “Nonlinear regression” ‒ “Lines” – “Straight line.”\nExclude data points at the start and end of the assay whenever they do not fit a linear trend. This ensures only the steady state is taken into account for the calculation of kinetic parameters (Stein, 2011a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCreate a summary table and associated graph with the slope ± SEM of each experiment (conversion rate, Y) and the substrate concentration (X). In GraphPad Prism, do this by checking the box “Create a summary table and graph” in the “Output” tab, select only “Slope,” and mark “Create a: XY graph with X values coming from column titles.”\nCheck that negative control experiments have slopes close to 0.\nCheck that experiment replicates follow the same trend (also indicated by low slope SEM).\nRepeat steps 29 to 41.\nPrepare a new data sheet with the slopes of each experiment (Y) and the concentration of substrate (X) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nOptional: Divide conversion rate data (slopes) by the concentration of enzyme employed, in order to normalize data across experiments. Then, the calculated vmax will be equal to the turnover number of the enzyme (kcat). In GraphPad Prism, use “Transform Y values using Y=Y/K,” and use the concentration of enzyme as “K.”\nFit data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In GraphPad Prism, use “Analyze” – “Nonlinear regression” – “Enzyme kinetics” ‒ “Michaelis-Menten.”",
    "Create a summary table and graph with vmax and KM values. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOptional: Repeat steps 29 to 41 and plot additional data sets until the kinetic values are obtained with sufficient certainty (ideally, SEM <10% for both vmax and KM values). Alternative substrate concentration ranges might be needed in order to define the Michaelis-Menten curve accurately.\nIf not done in the optional step before, calculate the enzyme kcat by dividing the vmax by the concentration of enzyme employed."
