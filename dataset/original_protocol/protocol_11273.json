    "NOTE: All the procedure including animal subjects have been approved by the IACUC at the University of Missouri. All mice received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\". The following procedure for cell isolation and inoculation should be performed in a hood. All performers should wear the standard personal protective equipment for handling of the mice and tissue.\n1. Induction of Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis with IP Injection of Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4)\nNOTE: See Figure 1. (CCl4 is highly hazardous reagent, it should be handled carefully and with wearing chemical-resistant gloves)\nObtain male C57BL/6J mice that are six to eight weeks old (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 10% CCl4 (v/v) solution in corn oil in a centrifuge tube. Determine total volume based on number of mice to be injected (see step 1.6).\nUse appropriate mice handling technique to select one mouse for injection.\nManually restrain the mouse with its dorsal (abdomen) side up.\nClean the injection site on abdominal wall of the mouse by scrubbing with 70% alcohol.\nInject male C57BL/6J mice with 160 µL of 10% CCl4 solution by intraperitoneal (IP) injection using a 25-gauge disposable needle.\nEnsure that the needle penetrates just through the abdominal wall (approximately 4-5 mm) with bevel-side up and slightly angled at 15-20 degrees.\nInject mice twice a week for a total of four weeks-each mouse will receive a total of eight injections.\n\tNOTE: Two weeks after the last injection, treated mice are ready for ISPL inoculation of oncogenic hepatocytes from MTD2 mice.\n2. Isolating Tag-transgenic Hepatocytes from Line MTD2 mice\nNOTE: See Table 1 for solution recipes.\ntable:\n﻿0,1",

In brief, using two fingers, give the mouse toe/foot a good squeeze. If there is no withdrawal reaction, the animal is judged deep enough to commence surgery.\nWhen adequately sedated, place mice in a supine position and fix the extremities with tape to provide adequate exposure of abdominal surface.\nPerform a midline laparotomy incision using scissors along the length of the linea alba large enough to provide an adequate exposure of the liver.\nDisplace the intestines to the left to provide better exposure of the liver and portal triad.\nDissect above the liver to expose the inferior vena cava (IVC).\nLigate the IVC above the liver using an artery clamp.\nReturning to the inferior border of the liver, use a butterfly needle (see materials) to gain IV access to the portal vein. Fix catheter by hand.",
    "Successively perfuse the mouse liver using an injection syringe at 8.9 mL/min with with 15 mL of solution 1, 15 mL of 0.75% collagenase solution 2, and 15 mL of solution 2 via the catheter.\nHarvest the perfused liver by cutting and taking the tumor mass from MTD2 mice in a 50 mL conical tube with 10-15 mL of PBS.\nRemove PBS and wash an additional time with PBS; do not centrifuge at this step.\nCut the liver into smaller pieces using scissors and then wash again with PBS  2x to remove remaining blood.\nAdd 5 mL of complete RPMI medium to the conical tube and continuously mince the liver with scissors to small pieces (<3 mm)-tissue should smoothly go through a 5 mL pipette.\nAdd complete RPMI to a final volume of 30 mL and suspend liver using a 5 mL pipette.\nFilter the mixed solution with a 70 µm strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nWash the strainer several times with complete RPMI and adjust the final volume to 50 mL by adding additional RPMI medium.\nQuickly spin the suspension by centrifuge to a maximum of 500 rpm; once the speed is accelerated to 50 x g, the centrifuge should be stopped.\nDecant the supernatant and suspend pellets in 20 mL of PBS.\nCount cells using Trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer, then adjust the cell concentration to 2.5 x 106/mL for the following cell inoculation.\n\tNOTE: The expected yield from 5 grams of tumor tissue is 80 million hepatocytes with viability >95%.\n3. Inoculating the hepatocytes from MTD2 mice to the liver of wild type C57BL/6J mice by ISPL injection\nThe aseptic technique should be used in all the procedures",
    "Anesthetize the CCl4-treated male C57BL/6J mice with 2.5% isoflurane, the mice should be treated with eye lube to prevent eyes from drying out.\nPrepare syringes with 200 µL of hepatocytes for injection.\nWhen adequately sedated, position mice with left side up.\nShave the entire left flank of the mice, then scrub the area, alternating between 70% alcohol and betadine three times.\nAdminister 5 mg/kg of carprofen subcutaneouly prior to surgical incision.\nMake a 1 cm incision on the left flank parallel to the 13th rib from the dorsal extreme beginning just below the spine muscle.\nIdentify the spleen, then exteriorize it using blunt-pointed forceps.\nClip the spleen with two medium-sized titanium clips. Place both clips between the splenic artery and vein, leave room between the clips to cut later after inoculation.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to isolate the inferior pole of the spleen to reduce risk of seeding.\nInject 200 µL (0.5 million) of the prepared hepatocytes into the inferior pole of the spleen using a 27 G needle.\nClip the inferior branch of the pedicle (inferior splenic pole vessels) with one medium-sized clip.\nCut the spleen between the two initially placed clips.\nRemove the inferior pole of the spleen that was directly injected with tumor cells.\nUse 3-0 polyglactin 910 interrupted suturing to close the inner muscle layer.\nUse sterilized steel wound clips to close the outer skin layer.\n\tNOTE: Steel clips are preferred over sutures to avoid animals chewing out sutures, leaving a gaping wound.\nAdminister 5 mg/kg of carprofen subcutaneously after suture.\nPlace all recovering animals on a temperature-controlled heating pad and monitor closely until fully recovered from anesthesia.\nGive mice free access to water after surgery. If the mouse becomes dehydrated during surgery, administer subcutaneous fluids (<1 mL).\nRemove skin clips at 7-10 days post-operatively.",
