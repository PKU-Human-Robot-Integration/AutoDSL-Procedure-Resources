    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal perfusion and brain extraction\nTiming: 3 min\nThis step will perfuse the mouse to eliminate intra-vascular blood cells and results in brain extraction.\nAnesthetize the mouse using methods approved by the institutional regulatory committee.\nSpray chest of the mouse with water to matte down fur.\nPerform a lateral incision down the center of the rib cage, cutting the skin.\nPerform a lateral incision through the rib cage just to the left or right of the sternum up the entire rib cage to fully expose the chest cavity. Take care to not puncture heart, lungs, or other organs while making this excision. Remove as much of the rib cage as necessary to be able to see and hold the heart with forceps.\nHolding the heart steady with forceps, make a small incision in the right atrium and immediately begin to perfuse the mouse with 10 mL ice-cold 1× PBS (without Mg2+ or Ca2+) by inserting 25 gauge needle into the apex of the left ventricle, slowly depressing the plunger, perfusing the entire 10 mL volume in no less than 1 min.",
    "To extract the brain, first cut the vertebral column/spinal cord at the base of the skull (approximately C1-C3 region) with large bone scissors to detach the skull from the body. This cut should expose the brain stem. Next, insert one blade of fine scissors into the brain stem opening, bracing the sharp part of the scissor blade against the left inner part of the skull. Snip the skull laterally from the opening of the brain stem until you reach the left eye of the mouse, resulting in the left side of the skull as an ‘opening point’ and the right side of the skull as a ‘hinge’. Next, using fine scissors or forceps, push the skull cap upwards, using the previous cut as an insertion/lever point. This should completely remove the skull cap, exposing the top of the brain and entire left side of the brain. Finally, slide forceps between the bottom of the brain and skull to prop out the brain. Keep the brain in a 2 mL tube with cold 1× HBSS on ice until the next step.\nCritical: Perfusion performed in step 5 must be successful to ensure leukocytes isolated in later steps were brain parenchyma-infiltrating rather than those within the vasculature. If perfusion is successful, the liver should turn from dark brown/pink to pale brown/beige (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). If these color changes do not occur, attempt to perfuse the mouse again with at least 10 mL ice cold PBS.\nOptional: Mouse can be perfused with >10mL of ice-cold PBS in step 5, which is recommended if time allows to further ensure removal of intra-vascular leukocytes.\nBrain dissociation\nTiming: ∼25 min\nThis step will dissociate the mouse brain into a single cell suspension.\nMechanical Dissociation",
    "Using sharp scissors (iris scissors or similar), thoroughly mince mouse brain in 2 mL tube filled with 1 mL 1× HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+, or Phenol Red) until chunks remain that are generally small enough to be pipetted using a p1000 micropipette.\nTriturate (mechanically dissociate) minced brain using a p1000 micropipette to pipette up and down until there is absolutely no resistance upon pipetting upward. Ideally, this should be done with the sample tube sitting in ice or a pre-chilled tube rack.\nTransfer brain slurry contents to 15 mL conical tube and use fresh 1× HBSS to wash out remaining brain slurry or fine chunks from 2 mL tube into 15 mL tube. As it is important to recover as much of the brain slurry as possible, several washes of 1-2 mL 1× HBSS of the 2 mL tube may be performed. Because this will be centrifuged and pelleted in the next step, there should be no concern about the total volume of 1× HBSS in the 15 mL transfer tube.\nAdd at least 2 mL 1× HBSS to 15 mL conical tube containing brain slurry.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 300RCF and 4°C with acceleration and brake set to low settings.\nEnzymatic Dissociation\nAspirate supernatant from the brain cell pellet.\nResuspend each brain cell pellet in 2.5 mL pre-prepared Multi-Tissue Dissociation Kit I enzyme mix.\nRotate or rock sample on a rocker or tube rotator at a medium speed for 10 min at 37°C.\nTriturate sample for 30 seconds to 1 min using a p1000 micropipette, eliminating most chunks of tissue. Any remaining chunks will be further dissociated in subsequent steps.\nRotate or rock sample at a medium speed for 10 min at 37°C.",
    "Triturate sample for 30 seconds to 1 min using a p1000 micropipette. No tissue chunks should be present at this point (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), but if there are, rotate or rock sample at a medium speed for an additional 2–3 min at 37°C, triturate again, and repeat process until no tissue chunks remain.\nAdd at least 8 mL ice cold 1× HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+, or Phenol Red) to the sample to help slow the enzymatic reaction. If any tissue chunks remain, remove them by filtering the sample through a 40 μm cell strainer and into a new tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 500RCF at 4°C with acceleration and brake set to low settings.\nCritical: Mechanical dissociation in steps 7a and 7b should not be replaced with other methods, such as sonication or a Dounce homogenization. Sonication could damage cells, and we observed that cell preparations following Percoll gradient centrifugation contained significant debris with dounce homogenization that would be unsuitable for downstream CyTOF or CITE-seq experiments.\nCritical: Mechanical dissociation in steps 7a and 7b must be well done to ensure thorough dissociation and reduce overall enzymatic dissociation time. We have found inadequate mechanical dissociation significantly reduces the effectiveness of enzymatic digestion and final leukocyte yield. An example of the effect of insufficient mechanical dissociation on the final dissociated product (post-enzymatic dissociated) compared to ideal mechanical dissociation is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nCritical: During enzymatic dissociation in step 8e, ensure that the sample is continuously agitated. If the sample becomes stagnant due to either rotator/rocker failure, becoming lodged in the tip of the conical tube, etc., the dissociation rate is significantly reduced, potentially compromising cell viability and cell yield.",
    "Note: We use a large volume of ice cold 1× HBSS in step 8g to help stop the enzymatic reaction. We theorize this large volume should dilute the reaction and the cold temperature will reduce enzymatic activity. We caution against using serum-containing reagents to help stop the reaction as the serum could artificially stimulate leukocytes in the preparation.\nLeukocyte purification by percoll gradient centrifugation\nTiming: 35 min\nThis step will purify brain-infiltrating leukocytes, both enriching these cells in a condensed, extractable layer in the Percoll gradient while removing debris such as myelin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAspirate supernatant from cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet in 3.5 mL 70% Percoll by pipetting up and down. Bring total volume to 4 mL with 70% Percoll.\nCarefully layer a total of 4 mL of 37% Red Percoll on top of the 70% layer without allowing intermixing of the two Percoll densities. This can be achieved by using a p1000 micropipette and slowly dripping the 37% Percoll onto the sidewall of the conical tube while the conical tube is held at a slight (∼45 degree) angle (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCarefully layer a total of 4 mL of 30% Percoll on top of the 37% Red Percoll layer without allowing intermixing of the two Percoll densities. This can be achieved as described above. The final layered solution should consist of three distinct layers as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D.\nCentrifuge sample in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 25 min at 800 RCF at room temperature (23°C–25°C) with the acceleration at the lowest setting and no break. Following centrifugation, there will be a buffy leukocyte layer at the interface of the 37% Red Percoll and clear 70% Percoll layers and a thick myelin layer at the top of the sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Using a vacuum aspirator connected to a p1000 micropipette tip, remove layers above buffy leukocyte layer at the interface of the 37% Red Percoll and 70% clear Percoll layers. Perform this step slowly, keeping the micropipette tip at the surface of the liquid (as opposed to submerged) to ensure the myelin layer is thoroughly removed and minimizing disturbance of the buffy leukocyte layer. Once within 1–2 mL of the buffy leukocyte layer, use a p1000 micropipette with a wide-bore tip to gently remove the remaining Percoll above the buffy leukocyte layer.\nUsing a p1000 micropipette with a fresh tip, extract the buffy leukocyte layer and place it in a new 15 mL conical tube. No more than 2 mL of Percoll on the top or bottom of the buffy leukocyte layer should be extracted.\nBring the volume of extracted cells up to 15 mL with cold 1× HBSS (without Ca2+, Mg2+, or Phenol Red) and centrifuge for 7 min at 350–400RCF at 4°C with the acceleration and brake set to medium settings.\nAspirate supernatant from cell pellet, leaving as minimal of a volume of residual liquid as possible without disturbing the cell pellet. A small aliquot of cells must be taken out to verify the preparation largely consists of debris-free single cells and to obtain a cell count and examine viability (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F). Proceed with the subsequent steps only if the cell preparation is a clean, single cell suspension with >80% viability.",
    "Critical: Centrifuge used for Percoll gradient centrifugation in step 15 must be set according to the indicated speed and temperature settings. A very low acceleration and no break will prevent early and late disturbances of the Percoll gradient, which could significantly reduce cell yield. Also, centrifugation must occur at room temperature as the density of Percoll would be changed at lower or higher temperatures, compromising cell yield.\nCritical: Once the Percoll gradient is fully layered in step 12, the sample should be centrifuged within 10 min as the 70% layer containing cells can begin to partition, slightly compromising cell yield. Prepared gradients should be maintained at room temperature before centrifugation.\nCritical: Minimize the amount of Percoll taken up when extracting the buffy leukocyte layer in step 15. Extracting excessive amounts of Percoll will make it impossible to pellet the cells, which is necessary to optimally remove Percoll.\nOptional: Centrifugation time in step 15 can be reduced to 20 min with no appreciable effect on cell yield.\nOptional: The 30% Percoll layer placed in step 12 can be omitted without compromising cell yield or purity. This layer is mostly used to extend the buffer space between the buffy leukocyte layer and myelin debris, reducing the chance of intermixing during leukocyte extraction.\nNote: Related to steps 10 and 11, cells can be resuspended in 37% Percoll instead of 70% Percoll and layered as described above with minimal effect on cell yield. This method has been described and evaluated elsewhere (Lee and Tansey, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Percoll gradient layers, related to steps 10–12\nLeukocyte blocking, staining, and washing\nTiming: 50 min\nThis step will block non-specific antibody binding and stain leukocytes with selected antibodies.\nCITE-seq Applications",

The qualities of cDNA, ADT and HTO libraries should be verified using bioanalyzer before proceeding for sequencing. Examples of high quality cDNA, ADT and HTO libraries are presented in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C. Specifically, product peaks should be ∼180 bp for ADT libraries and ∼300–700 bp for mRNA libraries, and these should be the predominant peaks within each library (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). If other product peaks are present, libraries may be re-cleaned with SPRI beads to eliminate unwanted fragments and retain the desired fragments.",
    "Sequence the CITE-seq library to the desired sequence depth. In the case of CITE-seq, a critical consideration is the ratio of mRNA to antibody libraries sequenced to obtain optimal sequencing depth for both libraries. Although the amount of each library sequenced will vary based on several factors (for example: the flow cell used and the number of individual libraries if samples were hashed). To this end, we have routinely sequenced hashed samples on a NovaSeq platform. Sequencing a CITE-seq library consisting of 9 HTO-hashed/multiplexed individual samples (68% cDNA library, 25% ADT library, 7%, HTO library) on an NovaSeq S1 flow cell routinely provides the following reads: ∼1000 X 106 reads for cDNA, ∼400 X 106 reads for ADT, and ∼100 X 106 reads for HTO. In our experience, with an expected recovery of ∼16,000 single cells per NovaSeq S1 sequencing lane, such sequencing depth is sufficient to reach >4000 genes/cell and >50% cDNA sequencing saturation of each singlet CD45+ immune cell recovered (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Multiple CITE-seq libraries can be multiplexed and sequenced on Nova-seq S2 flow cell to further reduce the per cell sequencing cost.\nTo analyze data (analyze differential gene expression, generate dimensional reduction plots, etc.) a number of excellent options are available, including Seurat (Satija et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) (R coding (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])), Scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) (Python coding), and Cytobank (cloud-based software program). A gating strategy for a brain leukocyte CITE antibody panel is displayed in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/652-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. RNA and antibody-based epitope expression in brain infiltrating leukocytes",
    "(A) Example of gating leukocyte populations using CITE antibodies. Briefly, CNS native myeloid cells (microglia and BAM) were gated based on both populations lowly expressing CD45 and then differentiated from each other based on higher I-A-I-E and CD38 expression in BAM. Peripheral leukocytes were gated based on high CD45 expression. Within the peripheral leukocyte population: B cells were defined as having CD19 and B220 expression. T cells were defined based on high CD3 expression and low NK1.1 expression, then subpopulations further distinguished on the basis of CD4 and CD8 expression. Myeloid cells were distinguished from adaptive peripheral immune cells by high CD11b expression, and then further subdivided on the basis of Ly6C expression levels and Ly6G expression.\n(B) Example of gating leukocyte populations using CyTOF antibodies.\n(C) Biaxial plots of CITE epitope expression on the x axis and its corresponding mRNA expression on the y axis. Discordant expression of mRNA and protein can be observed.\n(D) UMAPs derived from CITE-seq data clustered by RNA transcription cluster color coded by transcriptional cluster (left) or canonical cell ID determined by CITE-antibody gating (right). While canonically identified cells generally group within the same cluster, there is appreciable dispersion of canonical cell types among clusters, indicating the utility in using CITE antibody tags rather than mRNA alone to identify canonical cell types.\nPause Point: Amplified cDNA may be stored at −20°C until ready for final sequencing library preparation. Prepared sequencing library may be stored at −20°C until ready for sequencing.\nNote: The upstream work of this protocol should be adaptable to most, if not all, forms of cell partitioning and library preparation.",
    "Note: 10× Genomics regularly updates their reagent kits and protocols related to step 20. Be sure to check 10× Genomics reagent kits that will be used for your experiment and check the associated 10× Genomics protocol before proceeding with droplet generation or library preparation. Likewise, check for updates to the CITE-seq library preparation protocol, which is continuously being adjusted.\nNote: When performing cell hashing/sample multiplexing using HTO antibodies to enable sample pooling, we routinely use the HTODemux function in the R package Seurat (Satija et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) to demultiplex HTO hashed samples as part of the analysis performed in step 22. However, we have observed a low frequency of HTO cross-contamination. Assignment of HTO to respective samples needs to interpretated with caution and should be cross-validated with other computational methods.\nCyTOF data acquisition and analysis\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis step will run cell suspensions on a CyTOF instrument to ultimately obtain a count matrix of the number of antibodies bound to each cell.\nTo run cell suspensions on a CyTOF instrument, follow the most up to date user manual of the specific CyTOF instrument.
