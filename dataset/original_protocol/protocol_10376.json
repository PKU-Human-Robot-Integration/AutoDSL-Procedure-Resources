    "1. Chip Design and Fabrication\nDraw patterns to be ablated on PMMA substrates and double-side tapes using commercial software 24.\n\t\nTo study the effects of chemical concentrations and shear stresses, draw a \"Christmas tree\" pattern with a varying width at its end in each of the five culture areas (Figure 1A and 1B).\nTo study the effects of chemical concentrations and electric fields, draw a \"Christmas tree\" pattern with two more fluidic channels for salt bridges (Figure 2A and 2B).\nScribe an individual pattern on a PMMA sheet or a double-side tape by loading the corresponding file into the CO2 laser scriber.\n\t\nTurn on the laser scriber, and check its connection to the computer. Open the pattern to be ablated using the commercial software.\nPlace a PMMA sheet or a double-sided tape on top of the stage of the scriber. Adjust the focus of the CO2 laser if necessary using the calibration bar and the visible He-Ne laser.\nLoad the pattern into the scriber for ablation on the PMMA sheet or the tape.\nPick up the patterned sheet or tape, remove unwanted pieces, and clean the surface with nitrogen blowing.\n\t\tNOTE: The thickness of the PMMA sheet is 1 mm, and that of the double-sided tape is 0.07 mm or 0.22 mm.\n2. Chip Assembly\nWith super glue, attach acrylic adaptors (length x width x height = 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm, with screw threads in the middle) to the top-most layer of the chip by aligning the screw threads and the holes on the top-most layer. These adaptors serve as medium inlets/outlets and salt bridge connectors.\nAssemble the microfluidic chip inside a laminar flow hood.\nAssemble the chemical-shear stress microfluidic chip (CSS chip).",
    "Attach 3 sheets of scribed PMMA sheets using 2 pieces of scribed double-sided tape. (Figure 1A and 1B).\nAdd one more piece of the 0.07 mm thick double sided tape to the bottom of the chip and attach the chip to a 10 cm diameter Petri dish.\nPut the assembly chip in the vacuum chamber for overnight.\nTo assemble the chemical-electric field chip (CEF chip), attach the PMMA sheet to a double-sided tape of thickness = 0.22 mm (Figure 2A and 2B).\n\t\nAttach the scribed PMMA sheet and double-sided tape to a 10 cm diameter Petri dish using this same piece of tape.\nLeave the assembled chip inside the hood and expose it to UV for 30 min for sterilization. \nConnect the inlets to two 3-ml syringes via plastic tubes and finger-tight nuts. Connect the outlet to a waste tube via a plastic tube and a finger-tight nut.\n\tNOTE: Autoclave all tubes and nuts at 121 °C for 15 min prior to usage.\nSlowly depress the plunger on the syringe to prime the fluidic channels with PBS. Push syringes back and forth to remove bubbles.\nPut the chips inside an incubator overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: These two steps are aimed to wash the chip and remove any remaining bubbles within the chip.\nTake the chip out of the incubator.\nPrepare agar salt bridges for generating electric fields in the CEF chip. \n\t\nDissolve 3% low melting point agarose in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer using a microwave. \nInject solution-phased agarose into the salt bridge channel and insert the electrodes before solution solidifies.\nPlace silver/silver-chloride electrodes into the tubular nuts.",
    "Connect the syringes to the syringe pumps, and continuously flow the culture medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium, DMEM) into the fluidic channel for 10 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to replace PBS.\n3. Cell Preparation and Experimental Setup\nNOTE: Pre-warm 1x PBS, culture medium (DMEM plus FBS), and trypsin in a 37 °C water bath before usage.\nPlate 2 x 105 lung cancer CL1-5 cells25,26 in a 10 cm Petri dish supplied with DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Incubate the cells inside an incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C until 90% confluence.\nAspirate the medium and wash the cells once with pre-warmed 1x PBS. Add 2 ml of 0.05% trypsin buffer to the cells and wait for 2 to 3 min at 37 °C to detach the cells.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 ml sterile centrifugation tube and add 6 ml of culture medium into the tube. Gently invert the tube for mixing and take out 5 µl of the cell-containing medium for counting the cell number in a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 5 min. Suspend 106 cells in 1 ml of culture medium and place the cell-containing medium in a 1 ml syringe.\nInfuse the cell-containing medium into the microfluidic chip from the outlet and make sure that the solution distributes all through the five culture areas. Incubate the chip inside an incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2 hr. \n4. Experimental Setup\nTake the chip out of the incubator and place it on top of a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) glass heater.",
    "NOTE: The ITO glass is connected to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for maintaining the temperature at 37 ± 0.5 °C via feedback from a thermal coupler clamped tightly between the ITO heater and the chip.\nPut the chip-heater assembly on top of a motorized XY stage of an inverted microscope for tracking cell migration or a fixed XY stage of an inverted fluorescent microscope for measuring the production of ROS.\nTo generate different chemical concentrations, fill two syringes with 5 ml of chemical solutions of relative concentrations 0 and 1 (dissolved in culture medium) and pump them into the chip at desired flow rates: in the CSS chip, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 1 hr; in the CEF chip, at a flow rate of 20 µl/min for the first 20 min and a flow rate of 20 µl/hr for another 120 min (total time = 2 hr).\nIn the CEF chip, for tracking cell migration, program the XY stage of the microscope to repeat taking photos, via a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, of certain field of views (FOVs) within culture areas every 15 min for 2 hr.\nFor measuring the production of ROS, use the fluorescence-based indicator 2′-7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresce diacetate (2′-7′-DCFDA).\n\t\nPrepare the stock of 2′-7′-DCFDA at 10 mM in molecular biology grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dilute DCFDA in DMEM only without serum (5 µM in DMEM). The potential deacetylase could increase the background signals and decrease the signals in cells.",
    "After 1 hr of shear stress stimulus in the CSS chip or after 2 hr of EF stimulus in the CEF chip, pump 2′-7′-DCFDA (5 µM in DMEM) into the chip at a flow rate of 20 µl/min for the first 20 min and a flow rate of 20 µl/hr for another 20 min. For washing, pump DMEM into the chip at a flow rate of 20 µl/hr for 20 min.\nTake photos, via a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, of certain FOVs within culture areas for analyzing the fluorescent intensities.\n5. Calculations of Chemical Concentrations, Shear Stresses, and Electric Fields\nIn both the CSS chip and the CEF chip, calculate the chemical concentrations in the five culture areas. For example, by injecting H2O2 of concentrations 0 and 200 µM from the two inlets, concentrations of 0, 25, 100, 175, and 200 µM are generated.\n\tNOTE: By assuming that all liquids split-flow smoothly and equally around the fork, the relative concentrations in the five culture areas are 0, 1/8, 1/2, 7/8, and 1, respectively.\nIn the CSS chip, calculate the shear stress (τ) within each of the culture areas using imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54397/54397eq1.jpg 27, where Q is the volume flow rate, η is the fluidic viscosity, h is the height of the channel, and w is the width of the channel.\n\tNOTE: By setting Q = 0.3 ml/min in each inlet (Q = 0.12 ml/min in each culture area), η = 0.0008 Pa·s for culture medium, h = 1 mm, and w = 1 ~ 4 mm, the shear stress is calculated to range from 0.0048 Pa (4 mm wide region) to 0.0192 Pa (1 mm wide region).",
    "In the CEF chip, calculate the EF strength within each of the culture areas using E = I/(σAeff) (Ohm's law), where I is the electric current flowing across the fluidic channel, σ is the electrical conductivity of the culture medium, and Aeff is the effective cross-sectional area of the channel.\n\tNOTE: Using σ = 1.38 Ω-1m-1 for culture medium and Aeff = 0.22 mm2 (width = 1 mm and height = 0.22 mm), the EF strength is calculated to be E (mV/mm) = I (A) × 3.3 × 106.\n\t\nAs shown in Figure 2D, treat the equivalent circuit as five C-section circuits with four (8 + 35 + 8) segments and one (5 + 35 + 5) segment.\n\t\tNOTE: By analyzing this parallel circuit according to Kirchhoff's voltage law and Ohm's law, currents flowing across five culture areas, I1 through I5 from bottom to top, are calculated to be around 0.49I (area 1), 0.25I (area 2), 0.13I (area 3), 0.08I (area 4), and 0.05I (area 5), respectively, where I is the total direct current (dc). With an applied dc of 0.157 mA, EFs of 254, 130, 67, 41, and 26 mV/mm are generated within the five culture areas.\n\t\tNOTE: For a simplified electrical analysis of the microfluidic network, all fluidic segments are considered as resistors with resistance proportional to their lengths.\n6. Data Analysis\nNote: Data analysis is performed using the ImageJ software.\nAnalyze the Production of ROS.\n\t\nRun the ImageJ software. Go to \"File\" → Open to load a fluorescent image to be analyzed.\nGo to \"Image\" → \"Type\" → \"16-bit\" to change the image to a gray scale.\nDraw a polygon to enclose a cell.

The directedness of a group of randomly moving cells is close to 0.\nAnalyze Cell Alignment.\n\t\nRun the ImageJ software. Go to \"File\" → \"Open\" to load an image to be analyzed.",
