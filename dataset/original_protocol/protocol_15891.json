    "DexMA serves as an ideal backbone for a tunable 3D cell culture matrix, the most important building block for an in vitro model of angiogenic sprouting. First, DexMA chains are cytocompatible, enabling live cell encapsulation during gelation; second, DexMA is intrinsically resistant to protein adsorption and cell adhesion, allowing the controlled introduction of any biofunctionality of choice; and third, the polysaccharide backbone displays abundant functional groups, thereby providing complete and orthogonal control over bioactive moieties and crosslinking components (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0019]; Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]). In particular, hydrogel stiffness can be adjusted solely by tuning the degree of network crosslinking, without changes in polymer content, which in turn affect pore size and solute diffusion—an advantage over other backbones with limited functionalities, such as poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA; Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]). Additionally, functionalization with balanced concentrations of hydrophobic pendant groups can eliminate hydrogel swelling, thereby enabling 3D molding applications needed for more complex models of angiogenic sprouting that also take the structural features of native blood vessels into account (Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]).\nHere, we describe a method for the methacrylation of dextran through its base-catalyzed reaction with glycidyl methacrylate (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0001]). The crude product is purified by precipitation and dialysis to remove unreacted compounds and then is recovered as a pale orange product after lyophilization (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0002]). Dextran methacrylation levels can be analyzed through 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8df7cfd3-7301-4655-a1e9-5fd858f3b115/cpz1859-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nReaction scheme of dextran methacrylation.

Weigh 20 g dextran into a 250-ml round-bottom flask and add a stir bar.\n2. Using a syringe, add 100 ml anhydrous DMSO while mixing on a magnetic hotplate. Immediately close the flask with a septum.\nPay attention to avoid skin punctures when retrieving DMSO from the glass bottle. Full dissolution of dextran in DMSO requires a few hours under stirring, and yields a very viscous solution.\n3. After the dextran has completely dissolved, add 2 g DMAP.\n4. After DMAP has dissolved, add 24.6 ml (1.5 equivalents relative to dextran repeating units) of GMA under vigorous stirring using a serological glass pipet with a rubber bulb. Ensure that the flask is well sealed with the septum, as the reaction is moisture sensitive.",
    "As the addition of GMA forms a separate organic phase, it is recommended that the flask be manually shaken vigorously to quickly mix the two layers. The volume of GMA and the weight of dextran reported here are used to achieve a methacrylate/dextran repeating unit ratio of 0.7. For further information on how to obtain other degrees of functionalization (in molar equivalents relative to dextran repeating units), refer to Trappmann et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]).\n5. Place the round-bottom flask into an oil bath and heat to 45°C, using a temperature sensor for most precise heating. Stir the mixture vigorously for 24 hr and cover the round-bottom flask with tin foil to minimize exposure of the solution to light (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0002]).\nThe methacrylate group of GMA can readily react in the presence of light, and the flask should therefore be kept in the dark for the entire reaction time.\nOver time, the solution will develop a darker color, turning dark brown after 24 hr (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0002]).\nDexMA purification and lyophilization\n6. Cool down the solution to room temperature and precipitate DexMA by slowly pouring the reaction mixture into a beaker containing 1 L of cold (4°C) IPA under vigorous stirring.\nDuring this step, a pale orange form (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0002]). Make sure to cover the beaker containing the IPA solution with Parafilm during cooling to prevent moisture absorption. A high content of dissolved water in the IPA may affect the precipitation, leading to a loss in yield.\n7. Transfer the precipitate containing solution to 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes and centrifuge 2 min at 1600 rcf, 4°C.\nWe recommend distributing the solution containing the precipitate across a maximum of 10 conical centrifuge tubes.",
    "8. Discard the supernatant and repeat centrifugation of the pellets for 2 min at 1600 rcf, 4°C, to expel most of the solvent.\n9. Resuspend the pellets in Milli-Q water.\nIf 10 conical centrifuge tubes were used for the precipitate retrieval, we recommend using ∼20 ml Milli-Q water per tube.\nThe dissolution of the pellet in water may require a few hours. To speed up the process, you can mechanically break up the pellet with a spatula.\n10. Cut dialysis tubing into the required length and soak in water for a few minutes to rehydrate the membrane.\n11. Close one end of each dialysis tube with a clamp and transfer the DexMA solution, being careful not to fill the tubes completely. Close the other end of the tube with a clamp and transfer everything to a 4-L beaker filled with Milli-Q water and a stir bar. Perform dialysis with stirring at 4°C in the dark.\nStir the dialysis solution very slowly to prevent the stir bar from accidentally hitting the dialysis tubing and causing the clamps to open. Leave enough void volume in the dialysis tubes, as remaining IPA in the DexMA solution will lead to an influx of water that can otherwise burst the dialysis membrane. Dialysis should be performed at 4°C to minimize polymer degradation.\n12. Replace dialysis water with fresh, ice-cold Milli-Q water twice per day for three consecutive days.\n13. Transfer dialyzed dextran solution to 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes using a serological pipet. Place conical centrifuge tubes horizontally inside a −20°C freezer and freeze the solution overnight.\nFill conical tubes up to 25-30 ml maximum. Freeze them horizontally to increase the surface area of the frozen solution, which facilitates lyophilization.\n14. Lyophilize the frozen solution for ∼3 days to completely dry the polymer.",
    "15. Store the lyophilized polymer (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0002]) at −20°C.\nDexMA can be stored at −20°C for a few years.\n16. Analyze the degree of methacrylate functionalization of the obtained product by 1H-NMR spectroscopy using deuterium oxide as solvent.\nTo determine the degree of DexMA functionalization, calculate the average of the double bond proton integrals (6.2 and 5.7 ppm) and divide by the integral of the glucopyranosyl ring's anomeric protons (4.92 ppm), assuming a 4% ratio of α-1,3 linkages.\nFor further details on the 1H-NMR spectrum of DexMA, refer to Trappmann et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]) and van Dijk-Wolthuis et al. (1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0034]). This protocol should yield a degree of functionalization of ∼70% (∼0.7 methacrylate residues per dextran repeat unit). We recommend acquiring a 1H-NMR spectrum of the product for each batch of DexMA to confirm the success of the functionalization.",
    "The basis for all in vitro models of angiogenic sprouting are endothelial cells, which in vivo line the inner wall of blood vessels and are triggered to migrate into the surrounding matrix by chemokine gradients (Heiss et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0013]). More specifically, HUVECs have evolved as a major primary model cell type as they can be easily obtained in large numbers (Jiménez et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0015]). Historically, HUVECs were generally cultured on surfaces; however, this configuration fails to recapitulate the natural sprouting phenotype in a 3D tissue microenvironment and frequently results in the loss of their differentiated phenotype (Fina et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0008]). The maintenance of a more natural phenotype, in particular, can be supported by a more physiological 3D culture setup, e.g., in the form of spheroids (Heiss et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0013]).\nOver the years, many different methods have been developed to generate ECSs reproducibly and efficiently. All techniques drive cells to self-aggregate by preventing their adhesion to an underlying culture substrate (Fang & Eglen, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0007]). One common approach is the culture of endothelial cell suspensions as hanging drops, leading to cell aggregation and spheroid formation (Foty, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0009]). Although this method does not require special equipment and is therefore easily accessible to many labs, it often results in a comparably low spheroid yield and a low degree of homogeneity. Instead, low-adhesion wells with U- or V-shaped geometries can be optimized for high spheroid shape reproducibility, yet here, again, the number of generated spheroids is generally low. To improve yield, spheroids can be generated in low-adhesion microwell plates. Here, a standardized array of microwells (e.g., 400 µm × 400 µm in size) permits the formation of many, highly uniform spheroids from cell suspensions.",
    "This protocol aims to generate spheroids of HUVECs in a 24-well low-adhesion AggreWellTM microwell plate. Before the cell suspension is added, an anti-adherence rinsing solution must be applied to the well to prevent cell adhesion to the microwells and to initiate spheroid formation (Fang & Eglen, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0007]). The input cell density can be adjusted to control the individual sizes of each of the ∼1200 ECSs that can be yielded per well. The cell density applied in this protocol will result in spheroids of ∼140 µm in diameter after an incubation period of 24 hr (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0003]). At this time, they can be harvested from the microwells and used for downstream applications.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/25881fed-18c7-40ac-be02-bb5c53859dd3/cpz1859-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nFormation of ECSs.

    "Humidified cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)\nNOTE: All steps of ECS preparation need to be performed in a biological safety cabinet.\nPrepare AggreWell™400 plates with anti-adherence solution to prevent cell adhesion\n1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions by adding the 0.5 ml of sterile anti-adherence solution to one well of the AggreWell™400 24-well plate. Prepare a balance plate using a standard 24-well plate filled with water to match the weight and filled positions of the AggreWell™400 24-well plate. Centrifuge both plates for 5 min at 1300 rcf, room temperature.\nPrepare a number of wells depending on the number of spheroids required. Each well of the multi-well plate contains 1200 microwells and will yield ∼1200 spheroids. Be careful not to introduce bubbles into the microwells when dispensing the solution.\n2. Aspirate the anti-adherence solution and wash once with 2 ml PBS. Aspirate PBS and add 1 ml EGM-2 to the well.\nStarting at this stage, the plate can be kept at room temperature for the duration of cell suspension preparation. Long-term storage with culture medium is not advised.\nPrepare a cell suspension for spheroid generation\n3. Prepare a cell suspension from a confluent 10-cm dish of HUVECs (∼4.5 million cells): Wash cells twice with PBS and spread 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution across the cell layer. Aspirate the solution and detach the cells by tapping the dish from the side. Check the degree of cell detachment under a cell culture microscope.\nPrewarm PBS and cell culture medium to 37°C (in a water bath) and trypsin-EDTA solution to room temperature. The short exposure to trypsin (for only ∼20 s) at room temperature is more gentle to cells than the traditional trypsinization over several minutes at 37°C.",
    "4. Take up cells with 10 ml EGM-2 medium using a serological pipet and transfer the suspension to a conical centrifuge tube. Count cells in a counting chamber or equivalent. Prepare a cell suspension of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml or as desired (see AggreWell™400 datasheet) in a fresh conical centrifuge tube.\nGenerate spheroids\n5. Add 1 ml of cell suspension to the EGM-2-containing well of the AggreWell™400 24-well plate prepared in step 2, to achieve a total volume of 2 ml. Mix gently by pipetting up and down to ensure an even distribution of cells throughout the well.\n6. Centrifuge the plate for 3 min at 100 rcf, room temperature, to capture cells in the microwells along with the balance plate.\nPay attention to balancing the plate properly (well position, weight) to ensure an even distribution of the cells.\nObserve the plate under a microscope to verify that cells are evenly distributed among the microwells (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0003]). Each microwell should now contain about 1000 cells.\n7. Incubate the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 24 hr. Observe the cells under a microscope. Cells will assemble into spheroids after 24 hr (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0003]).",
    "Matrix stiffness is known to regulate endothelial cell migration patterns during angiogenic sprouting. In particular, we have shown that in both soft (∼0.8 kPa) and stiff (∼6 kPa) matrices, endothelial cells migrate as single cells, whereas cells acquire a collective migratory phenotype in matrices of intermediate stiffness (∼1.5 kPa) (Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]). Multicellular migration is required for subsequent vascular lumen formation, a critical step toward the formation of functional lab-grown blood vessels with in vivo-like properties (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0019]; see Background Information for more details).",
    "In Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0003], we describe the preparation of DexMA hydrogels (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0004]) with tunable stiffness, which are optimally designed to study the stiffness-dependent sprouting phenotype of ECSs. The protocol is divided into four sections: First, glass-coverslip-supported PDMS wells are prepared as holders for the spheroid-laden hydrogels; next, DexMA is functionalized with the integrin-binding peptide RGD to enable cell-matrix engagement; subsequently, the spheroid-laden precursor solution is crosslinked into MMP-cleavable hydrogels; and finally, cells are initiated to sprout by a pro-angiogenic cocktail (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0005]). DexMA functionalization with cell-adhesive peptides as well as hydrogel formation through coupling of MMP-cleavable peptide crosslinkers occur through the methacrylate groups introduced on the sugar backbone in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0001]. Methacrylates undergo Michael-type addition with thiols present in cysteine residues of the peptides (mono-cysteine adhesive ligands, bis-cysteine crosslinkers; Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0004]). Specifically, the presence of a base catalyzes the formation of nucleophilic thiolate anions, which react with methacrylates (Nair et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0023]). DexMA hydrogel stiffness can be tuned by changing the concentration of MMP-cleavable peptides (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-tbl-0001]; refer also to Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029] for stiffness values as a function of different crosslinker concentration). Changing hydrogel stiffness while keeping the content of DexMA polymer chains constant is a crucial design criterion of our system, because it ensures a comparable pore size and hence biomolecule diffusivity across the entire stiffness range (Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]). DexMA hydrogel stiffness can be measured through nanoindentation, a widely applied technique to probe the mechanical properties of materials, described in detail elsewhere (Ebenstein & Pruitt, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0005]; Xu et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0039]). An example of stiffness-dependent changes in endothelial cell migration mode is presented in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0006].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c08ea55b-aa32-4a29-aa37-08634010f6b2/cpz1859-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

All steps of hydrogel preparation need to be performed in a biological safety cabinet.\nPreparation of glass-coverslip-supported PDMS wells\n1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and pour the desired volume of liquid PDMS pre-polymer solution into a plastic cup. Add the dedicated curing agent at a 1:10 ratio using a plastic pipet and mix thoroughly for several minutes.\nAs the two components are mixed, many bubbles will form.\nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is an inert, nontoxic, and optically clear silicone-based elastomer (Raj & Chakraborty, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0025]).\n2. To cast a flat PDMS sheet, degas the mixture in a vacuum chamber or desiccator until all bubbles disappear. Pour 7 g of PDMS into a 10-cm culture dish, allow it to spread out evenly, and solidify on a level surface at 60°C for ∼4 hr. Alternatively, keep it at room temperature for 24 hr.\nBeware of potential spillage, as the level of PDMS will rise during degassing. If required, vent and repeat degassing multiple times. A maximum temperature of 60°C is advised to prevent the plastic dish from melting. Flat PDMS sheets cast inside dishes can be processed further to craft PDMS wells, or else be used to hold PDMS wells during ECS-laden hydrogel formation and cultivation.",
    "3. To prepare PDMS wells, extract the solid PDMS layer from the dish with tweezers. Cut out circular pieces of PDMS using a 10-mm-diameter biopsy punch or, alternatively, 2 cm × 2 cm squares using a razor blade on a cutting mat.\n4. Cut out holes of 5 mm diameter in each piece of PDMS. These cavities will function as hydrogel chambers.\n5. Remove dust and particles from the PDMS pieces using sticky tape and attach each PDMS piece to a glass coverslip, ensuring conformal contact (24 × 24-mm square coverslip for square pieces or 15-mm circular coverslips for circular pieces).\n6. Sterilize the glass-coverslip-supported PDMS wells using a UV light source (e.g., Omnicure® Series 1500 UV Spot Curing System, 10 mW/cm2 for 60 s; intensity measured at 365 nm).\nUV-sterilized glass-coverslip-supported PDMS wells can be stored indefinitely inside a tissue culture dish and used directly when required.\nLinear RGD coupling to DexMA: First step of DexMA hydrogel preparation\n7. Follow Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-tbl-0001] to select the stiffness of interest.\n8. Thaw aliquots of linear RGD and DexMA and equilibrate to room temperature.\n9. Centrifuge the aliquots to spin down any liquid left on the walls of the vessels.\n10. Add the required volume of DMEM, pH 7.0, to a sterile 0.5-ml reaction tube.\nThe pH of the DMEM used for the hydrogel preparation (7.0) is slightly lower than for cell culture (7.4) to enhance DexMA stability. The ester bond in DexMA can easily undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions, and a lower pH slows down this process. Suggestions for replacing DexMA with a more stable base material can be found in the Background Information section.\n11. Homogenize the RGD solution by pipetting up and down several times.\n12. Add the required volume of linear RGD solution to DMEM, pH 7.0.",
    "The acidity of the linear RGD peptide will induce a color shift of the DMEM solution to yellow (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0007]). To minimize pipetting errors, make sure that no drops are left inside or outside the tip after dispensing the required volume.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ce9446bf-7435-4ce8-aecb-b8283e7ca8d5/cpz1859-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nPreparation of ECS-laden hydrogels.

(B) Complete experimental setup for culturing ECSs encapsulated in a DexMA hydrogel. (C) ECS-laden DexMA hydrogel cast inside glass-coverslip-supported PDMS well.\n13. Homogenize the DexMA solution by stirring with a pipet tip several times.\nDexMA solution can easily form bubbles, which may affect precise pipetting and mixing. Briefly centrifuge at high speed to eliminate bubbles in the solution.\n14. Dispense the required volume of DexMA solution into the reaction tube containing the mixture of DMEM and RGD and pipet up and down several times to wash the inner side of the tip.\nDexMA solution is viscous, so when pipetting, make sure that the full volume is dispensed. This step can easily generate bubbles, so be careful not to pipet up and down too vigorously. If too many bubbles are present, the solution can be briefly spun down using a tabletop centrifuge.\n15. Dispense the required volume of 1 M NaOH solution while quickly stirring.\nDuring the addition of NaOH solution, it is important to quickly homogenize the reaction mixture in order to avoid a locally high pH, which can lead to a local induction of the coupling reaction resulting in hydrogel inhomogeneity. The addition of NaOH solution will induce a shift of the reaction mixture color from yellow to pink once pH 8 is reached (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0007]).",
    "16. Allow the reaction to proceed for 30 min at room temperature.\nFormation of ECS-laden hydrogels: Second step of DexMA hydrogel preparation\n17. Transfer a glass-coverslip-supported PDMS well to a 10-cm tissue culture dish with an adhesive surface.\nWe recommend the use of a 10-cm tissue culture dish coated with cured PDMS (described in steps 1 and 2). The stickiness of the PDMS layer is required to keep the PDMS well in place.\n18. Wet a Kimwipe with 2 ml antibiotic/antimycotic solution in PBS, fold it to obtain a long strip, and fit it inside the PDMS-coated dish by pressing it against the walls of the dish (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0007]).\nKimwipes soaked with antibiotic/antimycotic maintain a moist environment within the dish, avoiding drying of DexMA hydrogel surface during polymerization; antibiotic-antimycotic is present to minimize risks of contamination.\n19. In a biological safety cabinet, cut off the end of a 200-µl pipet tip using a razor blade.\nThis step widens the opening of the tips to decrease shear stress on spheroids during pipetting.\n20. During the 30-min incubation period after the first step of DexMA hydrogel preparation, detach ECSs from microwells by pipetting up and down against the walls of each well.\nPipet gently against the well walls to avoid damage to ECSs.\n21. Check ECS detachment under a cell culture microscope and repeat step 20 in case ECSs are still present in the microwells.\n22. Transfer ECS suspension to a 1.5-ml reaction tube using a cut tip and centrifuge for 4 min at 16 rcf, room temperature.\nCentrifugation at low speed is required in order to sediment ECSs faster without damage.\n23. Carefully aspirate the supernatant with a P100 pipet and resuspend spheroids in the desired volume of DMEM, pH 7.4 (prewarmed to 37°C in a water bath).",
    "DMEM at pH 7.4 is used to keep cells at an optimal pH during the preparation of ECS suspension.\nWe recommend aiming for a few ECSs in each hydrogel so that the forming sprouts do not overlap or interfere with each other. As an example, to get ∼2 ECSs in 20 µl of hydrogel cast in a PDMS well, the 1200 ECSs harvested from microwells should be resuspended in 100 µl DMEM, pH 7.4.\n24. Add the required volume of DMEM, pH 7.0, to the reaction mixture prepared in the first step of DexMA hydrogel preparation (steps 7-16).\n25. Add the NCD peptide solution and pipet up and down several times.\nHomogenize the reaction mixture quickly to avoid a locally high pH. The solution color turns from pink to yellow due to the acidity of the NCD peptide solution. Moreover, pay attention to the formation of air bubbles, which can be removed by spinning down the reaction mixture using a tabletop centrifuge.\n26. Add 1 M NaOH solution under rigorous stirring.\n27. Add the required volume of ECS suspension (from step 23) using a cut tip and pipet up and down gently to homogenize the solution.\n28. Quickly cast the hydrogel precursor solution, ∼20 µl, within the glass-coverslip-supported PDMS well using a cut 200-µl tip, and flip the dish repeatedly to ensure an appropriate positioning of the spheroid until the hydrogel has formed (Fig. 7C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0007]). Let the hydrogel polymerize fully for 30 min outside the biological safety cabinet. Cover the outside of the dish with wet tissues to create a moisturized environment for polymerization.",
    "Monitor hydrogel formation with remaining material in the reaction tube by gentle inversion. The movement of air bubbles in the solution can serve as an indicator of hydrogel formation. For a hydrogel of ∼1.5 kPa, the solution in the reaction tube should solidify within ∼5 min; otherwise, the pH needs to be increased slightly. During first trials, adjust the volume of 1 M NaOH solution in order to achieve hydrogel solidification in ∼5 min—the additional NaOH volume needs to be deducted from the volume of DMEM, pH 7.0, in the second step to adjust the final precursor volume to 90 µl. This discrepancy between the reported volumes of 1 M NaOH solution in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-tbl-0001] and the actual volumes required can be attributed to differences in pipetting between researchers and batch-to-batch variations in the acid content of the lyophilized NCD peptide powder.\nInduction of ECS sprouting by pro-angiogenic cocktail\n29. After 30 min of polymerization, carefully add 200 µl EGM-2 on top of the samples. Keep the samples in a cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for ∼4 hr.\nGently add the solution on top of the hydrogels, especially in the case of very soft (0.8-kPa) hydrogels, to avoid damage.\n30. Replace EGM-2 with 200 µl of pro-angiogenic cocktail on top of the samples. Transfer the samples to a cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) to induce sprouting.\n31. Culture ECSs while refreshing pro-angiogenic cocktail every 24 hr.\nIt is advisable to replace the pro-angiogenic cocktail every 24 hr due to the limited stability of its components. Moreover, water evaporation will result in higher osmotic pressure on endothelial cells during culture.",
    "Due to the hydrolytic instability of the ester bond in DexMA, samples cannot be kept for long-term culture. The maximum culture time of ECSs depends on the stiffness of the hydrogels: It is advisable not to exceed 2 days for 0.8-kPa samples and 10 days for 6-kPa samples (for information on more hydrolytically stable dextran-based hydrogels, refer to the Background Information section).",
    "In blood vessels, the endothelium is supported by a surrounding basement membrane consisting mainly of ECM proteins, such as laminin, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Importantly, not only does this basement membrane serve as a support structure for endothelial cells, but its biochemical properties directly affect endothelial cell function, e.g., by regulating integrin activation through the presentation of adhesive ligands (Leclech et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0018]). To study the regulatory role of individual adhesive ligands in vitro, synthetic hydrogels can be functionalized with peptides recapitulating the adhesive sites presented to endothelial cells in natural basement membranes. This approach offers an advantage over commonly used hydrogels of natural origin, such as type I collagen and fibrin, which do not provide control over the selection and concentration of adhesive ligands.\nIn our standard DexMA hydrogels (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0003]), the engagement of endothelial cells with their surrounding ECM is mediated through an RGD peptide (extended sequence: CGRGDS, free N- and C-termini). This peptide activates both αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins (Kapp et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0016]), which are known regulators of endothelial cell function during angiogenic sprouting in vivo (Brooks et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0002]; Francis et al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0010]). By using DexMA hydrogels functionalized with different concentrations of RGD, our lab was able to elucidate the role of ECM adhesiveness in the regulation of multicellular sprouting. In particular, endothelial cells were only able to sprout multicellularly through matrices functionalized with high concentrations of linear RGD, whereas they adopted a single-cell migratory phenotype at low peptide concentrations (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0019]).",
    "In Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0004], we report the recipes for the preparation of DexMA hydrogels of a constant stiffness (∼1.5 kPa) (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0003]) and varying concentrations of RGD ligand, ranging from 0.15 to 6 mM (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-tbl-0002])—a range of concentrations shown to support HUVEC adhesion in 2D (Liu et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0019]). These recipes will allow users to test the effect of matrix adhesiveness on ECS angiogenic sprouting independently from stiffness (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0008]). To keep chemical properties of hydrogels constant across the entire RGD concentration range, the adhesiveness is tuned by varying the ratio of RGD to RGE ligands, the latter not eliciting integrin activation (Takahashi et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0027]).\nTable 2.\n                Formulations for DexMA Hydrogels of ∼1.5 kPa Stiffness and Varying Concentrations of the Adhesive Ligand RGD\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0_level_0,1st step (reaction time: 30 min),1st step (reaction time: 30 min),1st step (reaction time: 30 min),1st step (reaction time: 30 min),1st step (reaction time: 30 min),2nd step (reaction time: 30 min),2nd step (reaction time: 30 min),2nd step (reaction time: 30 min),2nd step (reaction time: 30 min),Final concentrations,Final concentrations,Final concentrations,Final concentrations\nExpected stiffness values (kPa),\"DMEM, pH 7.0 (µl)\",\"RGD, 40 mM (µl)\",\"RGE, 40 mM (µl)\",\"DexMA, 250 mg/ml (µl)\",\"NaOH, 1 M (µl)\",\"DMEM, pH 7.0 (µl)\",\"NCD, 200 mg/ml (µl)\",\"NaOH, 1 M (µl)\",ECS susp.

    "Synthetic hydrogels are nanoporous polymer networks that require active cleavage of crosslinker moieties to allow cell spreading and migration (West & Hubbell, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0038]). Our DexMA hydrogels are crosslinked through peptide sequences that can be cleaved by specific sets of cell-secreted MMPs. The speed at which a given volume of covalently crosslinked hydrogel is cleaved by MMPs defines the degradability of the hydrogel. This degradability is affected by the concentration of the crosslinker as well as its susceptibility to MMP activity. Thus, in covalently crosslinked hydrogels, changes in stiffness through crosslinker concentration are always accompanied by differences in hydrogel degradability (Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]). In order to dissect the individual roles of these two parameters in endothelial cell sprouting, crosslinker peptides with different MMP susceptibility can be used to generate hydrogels of varying degradability but constant stiffness. Using this approach, our lab recently demonstrated that endothelial cells switch their migration pattern between single-cell and multicellular modes depending on the degradability of the matrix (Trappmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0029]).\nIn Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0005], we describe recipes for preparing DexMA hydrogels crosslinked with peptide sequences of different MMP susceptibility while keeping the stiffness (∼0.8 kPa) and adhesiveness (6 mM linear RGD) constant (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-tbl-0003]). Specifically, a crosslinker sequence derived from the cleavage site of native collagen, called a “native collagen degradability” (NCD) sequence (CGPQGIAGQGCR, free N- and C-termini), introduced in Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0003] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-prot-0004], is used as our standard sequence. Introduction of an amino acid mismatch to this sequence lowers its susceptibility to MMPs and therefore generates crosslinks of low degradability (LD, sequence: CGPQGPAGQGCR, free N- and C-termini) (Nagase & Fields, 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0022]). The applicability of the resulting hydrogels is demonstrated by the degradability-dependent changes in endothelial cell migration modes in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-fig-0009].\nTable 3.",

    "To gain insights into matrix-dependent signaling events, cultured ECSs within 3D DexMA hydrogel scaffolds can be assessed via immunofluorescence assays, including standard fixation methods, antibody staining, and fluorescence microscopy. Yet the surrounding nanoporous hydrogel hinders diffusion-based access to the cells. To achieve sufficient tissue preservation and antibody labeling, the application of all fixatives, antibodies, and fluorophores requires extended incubation times.\nThe imaging of embedded spheroids with a confocal fluorescence microscope requires the consideration of a set of additional parameters that may limit the acquisition results: Scattering of light by the cells and the hydrogel matrix, as well as mismatches in refractive indices between the hydrogel and the sample buffer (Riss & Trask, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0026]). To reduce background noise from out-of-plane fluorescence, samples are best imaged with a confocal microscope with a uniform laser illumination. Due to the thickness of 3D samples, fast image acquisition with a spinning-disc microscope is advised. The objectives of choice must provide extensive working distances of up to several hundred micrometers to reach and image the spheroids embedded at distant z-layers within the hydrogel.\nWhen assessing cells and spheroids in 3D, acquisition of structures close to the glass surface should be avoided. Cells can sense the stiffness of an underlying glass support surface up to a few tens of micrometers and thus must be excluded from the analysis in matrix-stiffness-related studies (Tusan et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0033]).

    "Angiogenic sprouting in vivo is promoted by pro-angiogenic cues that activate endothelial cells. Three factors commonly associated with angiogenesis have been identified and confirmed to induce robust and reproducible sprouting in vitro: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Nguyen et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0024]). VEGF and S1P both bind to their specific receptors on endothelial cells and activate downstream signaling cascades to promote cell migration and tube formation (Carmeliet & Jain, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0003]; Takuwa, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0028]). PMA passes through the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C (PKC), which leads to the activation of important pro-angiogenic signaling pathways (e.g., ERK), resulting, for example, in elevated cell proliferation (Mebratu & Tesfaigzi, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0021]; Verin et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0035]; Wang et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0036]).\nTo recapitulate the in vivo initiation of sprouting in the presented in vitro spheroid assay, a defined pro-angiogenic cocktail containing VEGF, S1P, and PMA at titrated concentrations is administered to the sample (Wang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.859#cpz1859-bib-0037]).
