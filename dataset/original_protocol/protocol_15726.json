    "Experimental animal procedures were conducted according to the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU, and approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Hospital Gregorio Marañón. A graphical summary of the experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1A.\n1. Brain target localization by in vivo neuroimaging\nAnimal preparation\n\tNOTE: Male Wistar rats of ~300 g were used.\n\t\nPlace the animal into an anesthesia induction box and seal the top.\nTurn on the sevoflurane vaporizer (5% for induction in 100% O2). When the rat is anesthetized, switch the gas flow to the nosecone. Confirm the state of anesthesia by pinching the rat paw.\nLay the animal supine on the CT bed, maintaining sevoflurane anesthesia (3% for maintenance in 100% O2).\nCT imaging\n\tNOTE: Selection of amperage, voltage, number of projections, number of shots, and voxel resolution depends on the CT scanner. Here, the following parameters: 340 mA, 40 KV, 360 projections, 8 shots, and 200 µm resolution were used7,8,9.\n\t\nSecure the facemask or nose cone to the rat.\nSecure the rat body at the head, shoulders, hips, and tail with silk tape to provide enough restraint without damage.\nMonitor the rat continuously.\nLocate the head in the center of the field of view of the CT scanner.\nProceed to acquire the CT image using acquisition parameters according to the specifications of the scanner.\nAfter 10 min, when the in vivo CT scan has been completed, stop the sevoflurane flow and place the rat into the MRI scanner.\nMR imaging",
    "NOTE: Scan acquisition specifications vary among scanners, including different software systems and more importantly, the specific research question. Here, a 7-Tesla scanner was used. A T2-weighted spin-echo sequence 7,8,9 with TE = 33 ms, TR = 3732 ms, and a slice thickness of 0.8 mm (34 slices), matrix size of 256 x 256 pixels with a FOV of 3.5 x 3.5 cm2 was used.\n\t\nLay the animal supine on the MRI bed, maintaining sevoflurane anesthesia (3% for maintenance in 100% O2).\nSecure the head to a stereotactic frame placed on the scanner bed to avoid head movements during MRI acquisition. Also, secure the rest of the rat body with silk tape.\nLocate the head in the center of the field of view of the MRI scanner.\nOnce the position is correct, proceed to acquire the MRI image.\nWhen in vivo MRI scanning is complete, stop the sevoflurane flow and place the rat into its cage.\nLocate a heating lamp near the cage because rats usually reduce their body temperature during the scan.\nMonitor the rat until recovery from anesthesia.\nAtlas co-localization and target coordinates calculation\n\t\nOnce CT and MRI images are acquired and reconstructed following the scanner's recommendations, co-register the CT and MRI images.\nUse an imaging processing software to spatially normalize CT and MRI using an automatic rigid registration algorithm based on mutual information10.\nLocalize the Bregma line in the co-registered image, and measure the distance in the anterior/posterior (AP: +3.5 mm), midline/lateral (ML: +0.6 mm), and dorsoventral (DV: -3.4 mm) axis from Bregma to the target (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC), according to the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas11.\n\t\tNOTE: Coordinates from Bregma to the target may differ between rats when weight, size, sex, and breed are different.\n2. Stereotaxic surgery",
    "CAUTION: Autoclave all surgical material, implants, and stereotaxic units before use, and disinfect the surgical area to avoid infections and complications which may affect animal welfare. Use sterile surgical gloves and cover the animal with sticky drapes to prevent contamination.\nAnimal preparation and anesthesia\n\t\nAnimals were administered 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine intraperitoneally the day before the surgery. Place the animal into an anesthesia induction box chamber and seal the top.\nTurn on the sevoflurane vaporizer (5% for induction in 100% O2).\nWhen the rat is recumbent, turn off the sevoflurane vaporizer and remove the rat from the box chamber.\nIntraperitoneally administer a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) to anesthetize the animal.\nWait until the animal is completely anesthetized. Check the level of anesthesia by pinching the interdigital area.\nShave the area between the ears and the eyes.\nPlacement in the stereotactic frame and craniotomy\n\t\nPlace the animal in the prone position on the stereotactic frame and use the head holding adaptor for rats to maintain the animal in the correct position during the surgery.\nEnsure immobility of the head by using the rat ear bars. Be careful with the insertion of the ear bars, as too deep an insertion may damage the eardrum.\nApply ophthalmic lubricating gel to the eyes to prevent dryness during surgery, and cover them with sterile gauze.\nCover the animal using sticky drapes to prevent contamination.\nApply iodopovidone solution to the shaved area and clean it with sterile gauze.\nApply mepivacaine in gel on the shaved area to anesthetize the local area.\nMake a longitudinal incision in the skin overlying the skull between the ears, extending 1.5-2 cm from lambda to Bregma (i.e., from the cranial vertex towards the eyes).",
    "Expose the skull with the help of 2 or 3 clamps. Remove the periosteum with a cotton bud and clean the blood with saline solution to expose Bregma and the sagittal sutures. Remove the excess saline solution with gauze.\nScratch the skull surface with a scalpel to improve dental cement adhesion. Clean the area with a cotton bud soaked in hydrogen peroxide.\nElectrode placement and fixation to the skull\n\t\nStraighten the electrodes with plastic tweezers to ensure the correct placement during the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentric bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes with the ground are used in this protocol.\nLocate one electrode on the holder of the right arm of the stereotactic frame.\n\t\tNOTE: It might be necessary to adapt the holder to the electrode to fix it better (see Figure 1B). Make sure that the electrode is parallel to the axis of the holder.\nMove the right arm holding the electrode through the stereotaxic frame and place the tip of the electrode exactly over Bregma. Try to bring the electrode tip as close as possible to the skull but without touching it to avoid deformation of the electrode, and note the resulting coordinates for Bregma provided by the stereotaxic frame. Make a mark on the skull indicating the initial position of the electrode with a surgical pen.\nMove the holder to the AP and ML coordinates obtained in step 1.4.3 and make a mark on the skull with a surgical pen indicating the position of the electrode target.\nRemove the right arm of the stereotactic frame holding the electrode. Be careful not to touch anything with the electrode.\nUse a small electric drill to make a hole through the skull (about 1-1.5 mm in diameter) in the target position until the dura is visible. Stop any bleeding using a cotton bud.",
    "Drill 4 holes along the skull to locate 4 screws (preferably stainless steel screws of 2-3 mm length) to increase the surface area of the dental cement and to locate the ground. Attach the 4 screws.\nLocate the right arm of the stereotactic frame with the right electrode. Move the arm to the calculated position, which should coincide with the hole. Then, lower the electrode until it touches the dura mater. This position will serve as 0 level in the DV direction.\nInsert the tip of the electrode in the DV direction, using the DV position in step 1.4.3. Clean the blood and cerebrospinal fluid around the area of the electrode with a cotton bud.\nAttach the ground to one of the screws closest to the electrode.\nApply dental cement around the electrode and screws taking care to shape the dental cement avoiding sharp edges, which could injure the animal. Dental cement is applied in a layer to prevent overheating/thermal injury to the tissue/skull. Thick layers require more time to cure before additional layers are added. Ensure the dental cement is completely hardened before removing the electrode from the holder.\n\t\tCAUTION: The preparation of the dental cement produces the emanation of toxic vapors from the mixture, which finishes with the solidification of the cement. Therefore, wear a protection mask effective against chemical gases from this point and until the end of the surgery.\nRepeat the same procedure from steps 2.3.2-2.3.11 for the other hemisphere of the brain.\nApply more dental cement to form a cap without covering the electrode. Wait until it hardens.",
    "Use braided natural silk non-absorbable suture 1/0, with a triangle needle, to suture in front and behind the cap. If required, remove the non-absorbable sutures at a particular time according to the body region where they are located. Use an iodopovidone solution to disinfect the surgical area.\nRemove the rat from the stereotactic frame.\nCT imaging for electrode placement confirmation\n\t\nPerform steps 1.2.4-1.2.5 and see Figure 1C.\nOnce the in vivo CT scan is complete, place the rat into its cage.\nFollow steps 1.3.6. and 1.3.7.\nPostoperative care\n\t\nAdminister antibiotic (ceftriaxone, 100 mg/kg, subcutaneous) for 5 days and analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 3 days as postoperative care. This antibiotic regimen may be prolonged for 5 days if any signs of infection (redness, swelling, and exudate) are observed around the cap.\nPerform a visual inspection of each animal daily, searching for signs of pain or distress, and clean the cap with iodopovidone solution.\nProvide intensive care for up to 1 week after surgery.\n3. PET/CT imaging acquisition\nNOTE: Each animal undergoes two PET/CT studies (i.e., in the absence and during DBS administration) under inhaled anesthesia to assess the acute effects induced by the electrical stimulation. Both scanning sessions follow the same imaging acquisition protocol, being performed 1 week after surgery (D1, without stimulation) and 2 days later (D2, during DBS).\nAnimal preparation and anesthesia\n\t\nFast the rat for 8-12 h prior to each PET scan to allow higher brain uptake of FDG, improving the signal-to-noise ratio12.\nPlace the animal into an anesthesia induction box and seal the top.\nTurn on the sevoflurane vaporizer (5% for induction in 100% O2).\nWhen the rat is anesthetized, switch the gas flux to the nosecone.\nFDG injection and uptake period",
    "CAUTION: FDG is a radiotracer, so consider radioprotection measures to avoid radioactivity exposure. Confirm that the institution has all permission to work with radioactive compounds.\n\t\nKeep the FDG vial inside a lead-lined cabinet until used to avoid undesirable radioactivity exposure.\nFill a small gauge syringe (~27G) with ~37 MBq of the FDG solution in the less possible volume, as measured in an activimeter.\nPlace a heating pad under the animal's tail or use infra-red light to dilate the tail veins.\nOnce the lateral veins are evident in the peak of the tail, clean the area with sanitary alcohol (96%).\nInject the FDG solution through one of the lateral tail veins, approaching the vein with a syringe parallel to its trajectory and with the bevel of the needle facing upwards.\nSwitch off the anesthesia and place the animal back in its cage to recover completely under a heating lamp.\nAllow 45 min of radiotracer uptake before starting the image acquisition session. During this period, keep the animal awake and inside a lead shielded chamber.\nIn the case of the D2 study, deliver DBS as explained below in section 4 (Electrical stimulation administration) during the FDG uptake period.\nPET acquisition and imaging reconstruction\n\tNOTE: PET image acquisition specifications depend on the scanner and the scan time. For this protocol, a static PET image was acquired for 45 min with a small-animal PET/CT scanner, using an energy window of 400-700 keV7,8,9. Review the specifications of the PET/CT equipment before designing the acquisition protocol.\n\t\n45 min after FDG injection, place the animal into an anesthesia induction box and seal the top.\nTurn on the sevoflurane vaporizer (5% for induction in 100% O2).",
    "Transfer the animal to the PET/CT bed and lay it in a supine position, securing the nose to the anesthesia nose cone and maintaining sevoflurane anesthesia (3% for maintenance in 100% O2). Confirm the state of anesthesia by pinching the rat paw.\nRepeat steps 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.\nLocate the head in the center of the field of view of the PET scanner.\nAcquire the static PET image using acquisition parameters according to the scanner's specifications.\nProceed to reconstruct the image using a 2D-OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm) and apply decay and dead time corrections7,8,9.\nWhen the in vivo PET scan is complete, maintain the flow of sevoflurane to the rat in order to subsequently proceed to the CT acquisition without displacing the animal's head position on the scanner bed.\nCT acquisition\n\t\nWithout changing the animal's position with respect to the previous PET acquisition, proceed to acquire the CT image.\nRepeat steps 1.2.3-1.2.5.\nOnce the in vivo CT scan is completed, stop the sevoflurane flow and place the rat into its respective cage for recovery.\nFollow steps 1.3.6. and 1.3.7.\nMaintain the animal into a lead-shielded chamber until complete radioactivity decay.\n4. Electrical stimulation administration\nNOTE: Electrical stimulation is delivered during the FDG uptake period in the D2 imaging session. For this protocol, the stimulation was delivered with an isolated stimulator, with a high-frequency (130 Hz) electrical stimulation in a constant current mode, 150 µA, and a pulse width of 100 µs7,13,14.\nDBS stimulator configuration\n\t\nPrepare the isolated stimulator and the required wires in a wide and quiet room, with enough space for the animal cages and minimal influence of potentially disturbing stimuli.\nConnect the stimulation wires to the swivels to allow animals to freely move within their cages and to the stimulator.",
    "Set the stimulation parameters according to the needs of the study.\nUse an oscilloscope to check the current mode, frequency, and pulse width. Confirm the biphasic waveform with a rectangular pulse shape (Figure 1D).\nDBS delivery\n\t\nAfter the D1 imaging session and until the D2 acquisition, subject animals to a daily habituation protocol (45 min/day) to accustom them to the stimulation system and the operator's handling, avoiding undesirable stress responses in D2. Connect the stimulation system to each animal, but without turning on the stimulation.\nOnce the stimulator has been set up, and the animal has been injected with FDG, connect the swivel to the electrodes and turn on the stimulator.\nAfter 45 min, turn off the stimulator, disconnect the animal from the swivel and quickly transfer it to an anesthesia induction chamber to begin step 3.3.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63478/63478fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental design.

PET image processing and analysis\nNOTE: Follow the same image processing on images from D1 and D2 to obtain comparable data for subsequent voxel-wise statistical analysis.\nSpatial registration of PET images\n\t\nUse specialized imaging processing software. The whole registration workflow is illustrated in Figure 2.\nCenter and crop each PET and CT image to the field of view. Register the PET image to its CT using an automatic rigid registration algorithm based on mutual information15.",
    "NOTE: Rigid registration methods are only appropriate whether there are no significant differences in body weight or size between animals. Otherwise, consider using elastic methods.\nRegister each CT image to a reference CT spatially registered to the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas11 as in step 5.1.2. Save the resulting transformation parameters.\nApply the transformation parameters obtained in step 5.1.3. to each registered PET image obtaining the PET image registered to the reference CT image.\nSave all the final PET images in Nifti format.\nIntensity normalization and smoothing of PET images\n\tNOTE: Intensity normalization and smoothing are performed with different in-house scripts based on publicly available resources.\n\t\nSmooth the PET images with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 2 mm of Full-Width Half Maximum (FWHM) to correct possible registration errors.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the smoothing filter will depend on the resolution of the PET acquisition, but it is recommended to use a filter of 2-3 times the voxel size of FWHM.\nNormalize the intensity of the PET voxel values using an appropriate reference cluster normalization method16.\nSegment a brain mask from a reference MRI registered to the reference CT image.\nApply the brain mask to each PET image to exclude voxels outside the brain from the voxel-wise analysis.\nVoxel-wise analysis\n\tNOTE: The statistical analysis, consisting of a voxel-wise analysis of the PET image data, was performed using specialized imaging analysis software17.\n\t\nCompare D1 and D2 PET images using a paired T-test, setting adequate statistical significant thresholds.\nConsider as definitive results of the analysis only those clusters larger than 50 adjacent voxels to reduce type I errors.\nRepresent the results in T-maps overlaid on a T2 MRI, showing the changes in glucose brain metabolism induced by DBS (cold colors for FDG reduction and warm colors for FDG increment).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63478/63478fig02.jpg",
