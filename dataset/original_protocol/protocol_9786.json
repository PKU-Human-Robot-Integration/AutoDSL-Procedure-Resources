    "This work was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University. Human DPSCs (hDPSCs) were isolated from human dental pulp tissues extracted from both premolars and molars due to wisdom teeth issues. Informed consent was obtained from the patients under an approved protocol (HREC-DCU 2018/054).\n1. Integrative induction protocol\nPreparation of lentiviral vector carrying PDX1\nUse human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293FT cells for viral packaging. Culture and maintain these cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic.\nGenerate PDX1-lentivirus vectors by co-transfection of 10 µg each of the packaging and envelope plasmids and 20 µg of the targeted gene plasmid into HEK293FT cells using calcium phosphate transfection system, e.g., psPAX2, pMD2.G, and human pWPT-PDX111. Ensure that the cells are 80%-90% confluent during the time of infection.\nCollect the medium containing lentiviral particles at 48 and 72 h after transfection.\nFilter the collected medium through a 0.45 µm filter; concentrate the viruses with a centrifugal filter at 100 kDa nominal molecular weight cut-off (NMWCO).\nPDX1 overexpression\n\t\nUse passage 3-5 hDPSC that are 70-80% confluent. Trypsinize and count the cells using a cell counter. Seed 1 x 106 hDPSCs onto a 60 mm tissue culture-treated dish and incubate overnight.\n24 h later, add fresh virus particles obtained from step 1.1.4 to transduce polybrene pre-treated cells (4 µg/mL polybrene, 30 min under 37 °C and 5% CO2) at the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI). For example, in this case, MOI used is 20. Maintain the cells in the cell culture incubator for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "After the 24 h infection period, discard the medium containing viral particles. Add fresh culture media and continue growing the cells for 48 h. All cultures are maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nCheck the aggregated morphology of the transfected cells before proceeding to the induction step. PDX1 transduction is confirmed by gene expression analysis (Supplemental Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Check the cell morphology under a microscope before proceeding to the next steps.\nHarvest and proceed to a three-step induction protocol (step 1.3) as a microenvironmental induction approach.\nThree-step induction protocol\n\tNOTE: The three-step induction protocol resulted in the series of pancreatic differentiation of hDPSCs to definitive endoderm, pancreatic endoderm/endocrine, and pancreatic beta-cells/IPCs using serum-free medium (SFM)-A, SFM-B, and SFM-C, respectively.\n\t\nDiscard the culture medium, and then wash the transduced-hDPSCs with 1x phosphate-buffered solution (PBS).\nAdd 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution to the cells and incubate for 1 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd the culture medium to stop the trypsin activity and gently flush the cells to get the single cell suspension. Count the cells and aliquot 1 x 106 cells into each collecting tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 468 x g (Relative Centrifugal Force: RCF), 4 °C, for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and save the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 3 mL of first pancreatic induction medium, i.e., serum-free medium (SFM)-A. Seed the cells on a low attachment culture plate (60 mm). Maintain the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Observe cells morphology under an inverted microscope before proceeding to the next step.\nRemove SFM-A and add 3 mL of the second induction medium, i.e., SFM-B. Maintain the cells for the next 2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: Observe cells morphology under an inverted microscope before proceeding to the next step.\nRemove SFM-B and add 3 mL of the third induction medium, i.e., SFM-C. Maintain the cells for the next 5 days in a cell culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Change the medium every 48 h. Observe their morphology after 5 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Each induction medium is supplemented with different reagents as described; SFM-A: 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS), 4 nM of activin A, 1 nM of sodium butyrate, and 50 µM of beta-mercaptoethanol; SFM-B: 1% BSA, 1x ITS, and 0.3 mM taurine; and SFM C: 1.5% BSA, 1x ITS, 3 mM taurine, 100 nM of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, 1 mM nicotinamide, and 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAAs).\nMake sure to check the cell morphology under an inverted microscope after each step. The cells will become more aggregated and float as colonies.\nCollect cell colonies for further analysis. Check for colony morphology and size. Perform pancreatic gene marker expression analysis and functional analysis (Glucose stimulated C-peptide secretion assay).\n2. Non-integrative induction protocol\nNOTE: The non-integrative protocol is the backbone protocol for delivering the IPCs with the three-step induction process as a microenvironmental induction approach8,9.\nUse passage 3-5 hDPSCs at 70%-80% confluency.\nDiscard the culture medium and wash hDPSCs with 1x PBS.\nAdd 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution onto the cells and incubate for 1 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAdd the culture medium to stop the trypsin activity and gently pipette the cells to obtain the single cell suspension. Count cells and aliquot 1 x 106 cells into each collection tube.\n\t\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 468 x g (RCF), 4 °C, 5 min. Discard the supernatant.",
