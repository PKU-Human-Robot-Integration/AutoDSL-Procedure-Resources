    "1. Purification of the Dye\nPrepare a 4% aqueous solution of methyl green by dissolving 0.4 g of stain powder in 10 ml distilled water. Mix thoroughly until completely dissolving it.\nUnder a fume-hood, mix it with at least 2 parts of chloroform. It is important to check beforehand whether the tubes are chloroform resistant.\nMix thoroughly and centrifuge for 1 min at 2,000 x g to accelerate phase separation.\nAfter centrifugation, an upper aqueous phase with methyl green and a lower organic phase with chloroform and the usual contaminant crystal violet are obtained.\nRecover the upper phase and repeat this step until lower phase appears completely devoid of crystal violet.\nAt the end, the upper phase is recovered and diluted in water to a final concentration of 2% methyl green. This stock solution is stable on the workbench for months and does not need to be protected from light.\n2. Fluorescent Nuclear Staining of Whole Zebrafish Embryos using Methyl Green\nFix the embryos overnight in 4% formaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: This can take from a few hours to overnight depending on the thickness of the embryos. In the example, we fixed 48 hr post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos overnight.\nWash the embryos three times in PBS-T (1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 min. The elevated concentration of detergent permeabilizes the cuticle.\nPrepare a 1:5,000-1:10,000 solution of methyl green (from 2% stock solution) in PBS-T. The presence of detergent during the incubation is useful for thick specimens, such as zebrafish embryos and larvae.\nIncubate the embryos in the solution for at least 6 hr at 4 °C, with gentle rocking. Again, the thickness of the embryo is the calibrating parameter for the length of the incubation.",
    "Wash the embryos 3 times with PBS for 30 min to remove the detergent excess. Methyl green fluorescence is only evident when bound to DNA, hence background from the unbound molecule is negligible.\nMount on an excavated slide or a homemade chamber with mounting solution (75% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris·HCl pH 8).\n\tNOTE: If the nuclear staining is to be performed after immunolabeling, methyl green can be incorporated to the mounting solution at the working concentration, with no need to wash it away.\nStore refrigerated or start imaging immediately. Perform imaging with a laser scanning confocal (or other fluorescence) microscope with excitation at 633 nm and emission filters set to register at 650-750 nm taking into account that methyl green emission reaches its maximum at 677 nm.\n\tNOTE: We provide the measured data of the methyl green emission profile, to be loaded into the acquisition software, as supplementary material.\n3. Fluorescent Nuclear Staining of Whole Chick Embryos using Methyl Green\nIncubate fertilized hen eggs to the stage of interest. Fix the embryos overnight in 4% formaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde) in PBS at 4 °C. Wash embryos 3 times in PBS-T for 2 hr.\nPrepare a 1:5,000-1:10,000 solution of methyl green (from 2% stock solution) in PBS-T. Incubate the embryos in the staining solution overnight at 4 °C. Wash the embryos 3 times in PBS, 1 hr each. Mount in chamber with 75% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.\n4. Imaging Fluorescently Labeled Nuclei in Whole-mounted Embryos\nPrepare an imaging chamber by sticking several layers of electrical tape over a microscope slide and carefully cut a hole into it with a scalpel to place the embryos within. This will prevent embryos from crushing during imaging.",
    "Carefully transfer the embryos to the imaging chamber and fill the chamber to the top with 75% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH=8 to avoid bubble formation.\nCover with a #0 coverslip avoiding or eliminating medium overflowing. Seal it with nail polish.\nAcquire images of the specimen on a fluorescence microscope equipped with a 633 excitation filter or laser line.\n\tNOTE: Emission filters should cover the 677 emission maximum of methyl green.\nSubscription Required.
