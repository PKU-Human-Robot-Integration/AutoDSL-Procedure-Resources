    "The protocol used for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tsinghua University.\n1. Stimuli construction and presentation\nStimuli construction\n\t\nStimuli preparation: Prepare target words containing approximately 140 Chinese two-character compounds, of which low- and high-frequency words account for half. Precede each target by three analogues: a phonologically identical word (homonymous word), a word with related meaning, and an irrelevant control word.\n\t\t\nEnsure that high-frequency targets are always preceded by high-frequency antecedents and low-frequency targets are always preceded by low-frequency precedents, whether in related conditions or unrelated control groups. In addition, ensure the precede-target pairs are similar in the number of strokes and frequency.\n\t\t\tNOTE: All the words for this study were selected from the Modern Chinese Frequency Dictionary (Xiandai Hanyu Pinlu Cidian). The frequency of low-frequency words was less than eight times per million, and the frequency of high-frequency words exceeded 800 times per million.\nStimuli assessment: Recruit a separate group of approximately 30 students to evaluate the degree of semantic relevance between word pairs on a seven-point scale, wherein 1 reflects the lowest correlation and 7 reflects the highest correlation.\nFinal stimulus determination: Delete inappropriate word pairs, such as word pairs with lower scores in semantically related conditions and word pairs with higher scores in homophone and irrelevant condition scores.\n\t\t\nCalculate the respective average scores of high- and low-frequency semantic-related word pairs and ensure no significant difference is present between the two.\nIn addition, ensure that the scores of homophone pairs and unrelated pairs are not significantly different at both high and low frequency. Finally, determine the final experimental stimulus material (see Table Materials).",
    "​NOTE: For the semantic-related values of the semantic-related pairs in this experiment, the final average values were 5.62 and 5.73 for high-frequency and low-frequency pairs, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two (p > .1). In addition, the semantic relatedness between the homophonic and unrelated pairs was not significantly different (p > .1).\nStimuli presentation\n\t\nBuild a program to show the task to the subjects and fill in the aforementioned materials (the program can be written in E-prime or other programming languages).\nEnsure that each core structure of the program starts with a screen displaying a \" + \" sign that lasts for 300 ms, directly after which the preceding word must appear for 140 ms, with no interval between the two.\nAfter that, set a blank screen lasting for 360 ms, and then set the target word, which will appear for 500 ms. Finally, set a question mark (?) that will continue to be displayed until the participant has decided on the word pair just shown and pressed the button as quickly and accurately as possible.\nTell the participants in advance that they need to judge whether the word pair is semantically related in the semantic judgment task and whether the phonology is the same in the phonological judgment task.\nPractice session setup: Set up two practice groups to include semantic judgment and phonological judgment tasks, respectively, with no less than 10-word pairs for each task. Inform the participants that they can repeat the exercises to ensure that the accuracy in the practice session is more than 70%.\nFormal experiment setup: Divide the whole experiment into 6 blocks, with the semantic judgment task and the phonological judgment task each accounting for half.",
    "Make sure that there are no repeated target words in each block, and that the number of priming types in each block is the same. In addition, set up a few filler trials to reduce the response deviation caused by the unequal number of tests requiring positive or negative reactions.\nRandomize the order of items in each block and counterbalance the block order among the subjects.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The entire experiment can also be divided into eight or ten or more blocks according to the number of experimental materials to be prepared, which minimizes the repetition of target words in each block.\n2. Experiment preparation and electrophysiological recording\nRecruit right-handed native Chinese speakers with a normal vision that may have been previously corrected.\n\t\nExclude participants with any neurological or psychiatric diseases.\nEnsure there is a balanced number of female and male participants in the desired age range (18-28 years old).\nEnsure that the participants do not have any history of perming or dyeing their hair for the past two months.\nInform the participants that they will need to have sufficient sleep and rest time before the experiment25.\nWhen participating in the experiment, please make sure the participants are in a healthy state at the time of conducting the experiment.\nWhen a participant arrives at the lab, introduce the experimental equipment, tasks, and time costs. Explain the requirements (such as not being sleepy, moving, and blinking) to help them understand the entire process and eliminate unnecessary worries.\nIf the participant has no other questions about the experiment, ask them to fill in the Edinburgh Handedness Query Form, which is used to confirm that all participants have the same right-handed habits.",
    "Provide the informed consent form to the participants and ask them to read and sign carefully. If participants have questions about the content of the consent form, provide them with the necessary explanations.\nInstruct the participant to properly clean their scalp and dry their hair in the laboratory. While waiting for participants, please prepare all experimental materials.\n\tNOTE: The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is amplified using an amplifier system with a bandpass of 0.01 to 100 Hz and continuously sample at 500 Hz.\nInvite the participants to sit comfortably on a chair in the chamber where the experiment will be conducted. Instructed them not to move the chair.\nUse cotton swabs and facial scrubs to clean the skin under the participant's left eye (for the vertical electro-oculographic electrode), near the outer canthus of the right eye (for the horizontal electro-oculographic), and around the right and left mastoid bones (for Tp9 and Tp10, which will be used as new offline references).\n\tNOTE: The distribution of electrodes may vary depending on the caps used.\nPlace the elastic cap on the participant's head and make sure that the Cz electrode is at the center of the top of the head. Fix the electrode cap strap under the chin with care to ensure that it is not too tight or too loose.\nMake sure that the cap and amplifier are connected to the recording system. Next, switch the recording software to the impedance monitoring interface.\nEnsure that the impedance of all electrodes does not exceed 5 kΩ or 10 kΩ, starting with the reference (Ref) and ground (Gnd) electrodes.",
    "Pass the syringe filled with conductive gel through the small hole of an electrode to the scalp and then push the plunger to inject a small amount of conductive gel into the scalp while being careful not to cause an overflow. At the same time, monitor the display system that displays the impedance in real-time until the impedance drops to the threshold.\nAfter the Ref and Gnd electrodes are prepared, reduce the impedance of the other electrodes in the same way. Treat the impedance reduction of ocular electricity carefully.\n\t\nTape the small holes on one side of the two electro-oculographic electrodes to prevent the injected conductive gel from leaking. Fix them to the bottom of the left eye and the outer canthus of the right eye with tape.\nAfter all the electrodes are prepared, instruct the participants to be ready for the experiment. Instruct the participants to relax and avoid excessive eye blinking and body movement during the experiment.\nPresent the stimulus via the stimulus demonstration program and let the participants practice in the practice section.\n\tNOTE: After the practice session, participants can ask questions if they have any doubts or questions about how to proceed.\nStart the formal experiment and record the EEG information. Monitor the recording system during recording. If an electrode is loose or the resistance exceeds the threshold, refill the electrode when the participant is resting.\n\tNOTE: Participants can rest for 4-10 min after each block.\nAfter the experiment is completed, save the EEG signal and turn off the equipment, such as the recording system and amplifier. Then take off the participant's cap and instruct the participant to wash off the conductive gel from the hair and skin. Finally, reward the participants and thank them for their cooperation.\n3. EEG preprocessing",
    "Utilize semi-automatic ocular correction with independent component analysis.\nCompute the ERPs from 100 ms to 600 ms after the onset of the target word (100 ms pre-target baseline).\nSet the EEG bandpass-filtered offline from 0.05 to 30 Hz (zero phase shift mode, 24 dB/oct).\nDiscard epochs exceeding ±80 µV by artifact rejection and eliminate the trials of erroneous responses.\nSubscription Required.
