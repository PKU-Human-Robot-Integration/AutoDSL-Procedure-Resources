    "1. Assembling the assay chambers\nNOTE: While this protocol describes the use of a 35 mm Petri dish (Figure 1A), the desired effect can be achieved using any watertight, smooth-bottomed vessel that can be bisected and covered.\nFirst, bisect a lidded 35 mm Petri dish by fixing a length of plastic (5 mm in width and 3 mm in height) down the midline with waterproof adhesive, forming two watertight compartments. Confirm that the seal is complete to avoid leakage that can lead to mixing of the two food substrates being assayed.\n\t​NOTE: After assembly, reuse this apparatus as long as the seal holds.\n2. Preparing starvation vials\nPrepare a sufficient number of empty plastic fly vials; then, loosely compact a piece of tissue paper at the bottom. Compress the tissue paper enough that it fills the space, but not so much that it forms a dense mass.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that there are no deep crevices or folds in the tissue, as this can lead to flies getting trapped.\nAdd ~3 mL pure water to the vial so that the tissue is completely saturated, but there is no standing water. Ensure that there are no large droplets of excess water on the wall of the vial. Alternatively, substitute agarose for the soaked paper by preparing a 1% w/v agar solution (without sucrose) by adding 5 mL of 1% agarose to each empty vial and allowing the agarose to solidify at room temperature.\n3. Wet starvation of flies prior to the experiment\nInitiate starvation 24 h before the time of the experiment. Under CO2 anesthesia, sort groups of ~70, 2-4-day-old flies into the prepared starvation vials, labeling each vial with the genotype and time of starvation.\n4. Reagent setup\nPreparation of dyes",
    "​NOTE: Prior to performing any experiments, it is important to perform a preliminary control assay to determine the correct concentrations of red and blue dyes to use.\n\t\nFor the control assay, prepare a range of dilutions for each dye, and perform the feeding assay with the same food with a different dye color. Use the results to identify two-dye concentrations (one red, one blue) that yield a PI of ~0 when no experimental compound is added (see section 7).\n\t\tNOTE: For example, the final blue dye concentration was fixed at 50 µM and tested against a series of red dye concentrations. Based on the red dye dosage curve, the optimal red dye concentration was 210 µM, which gave minimal dye bias (Figure 1B). A higher red dye concentration drives flies to prefer red food, whereas a lower concentration drives flies to prefer blue food. Carefully refine blue or red dye concentrations in increments of 1 µM, as differences of this magnitude and greater can affect experimental outcomes.\nPreparation of 1% agarose\n\t\nCombine 0.5 g agarose and 50 mL of pure water (or some multiple thereof) in a microwave-safe vessel. Microwave the agarose solution until dissolved, stirring it as needed.\nPreparation of other food components\n\t\nDissolve each food component, including sucrose and any experimental compounds, in water at a 100-fold or higher concentration of the final tested concentration.\n\t\t​NOTE: The total volume of each food ingredient added to 1% agar should not exceed 1 mL per 10 mL molten agar. Otherwise, the agarose may be too dilute and will not solidify appropriately.\nPreparation of food media",
    "Mix agar, dye, and the desired experimental compound in conical polypropylene centrifuge tubes (15 or 50 mL); use water instead of the experimental tastant in the control food. Do this while the agar is still completely liquid and mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer. Keep the tubes in a 60 °C water bath while not in use to prevent the agarose from hardening before being distributed into dishes.\nPreparing dishes for the experiment\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all dishes are completely dry before starting.\n\t\nPipette 1 mL of red experimental food medium into one side of the assay dish (Figure 1A); repeat for the desired number of dishes. Allow the agarose to cool until firm (3-5 min), and then pipette 1 mL of blue control food into the other side of the dishes (Figure 1A). Repeat this process with the control red/experimental blue pair.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure all dishes are fully set before beginning the experiment. Use the dishes within 30 min.\n5. Initiating the two-way feeding assay\nTemporarily paralyze experimental fly lines on ice until no obvious motor activities such as flying and climbing are observed. Once the flies are immobilized, gently invert the vial, and tap to transfer all the flies into the assay chamber.\n\tNOTE: Cold shock takes ~3-5 min. Prolonged exposure to cold may affect the fly's physiology and health and should therefore be avoided.\nQuickly place the cover on the chamber and set it aside. Once all the flies have been transferred, move all chambers to a dark, enclosed space. Allow the assay to run for 90 min.\n\t​NOTE: A dark environment minimizes the influence of the fly's visual pathway on feeding behavior and removes any environmental cues from outside the dish.\n6. Terminating the two-way feeding assay",
    "After 90 min have elapsed, transfer the chambers to a -20 °C freezer to sacrifice the flies. After ~1 h, count the flies.\n\t​NOTE: Invert each Petri dish before placing the dish in the freezer to ensure that no flies will be frozen onto the food.\n7. Assigning a preference index (PI) to determine food preference\nUnder a standard dissection microscope, examine the flies' abdominal color in each individual dish. Count the flies as either red, blue, or purple according to the color of their abdomen (Figure 2A). Count the fly if its abdomen is more than 50% colored, indicating robust feeding (Figure 2B). Exclude the fly if its abdomen contains only a tiny food spot, indicating poor eating (Figure 2C).\nAfter the numbers of flies eating blue, red, or both blue and red foods have been counted, use the following equation to assign each Petri dish a preference index (PI):\nPI = (Number of flies eating experimental food) - (Number of flies eating control food) / (Number of flies eating experimental food) + (Number of flies eating control food) + (Number of flies eating both)\nPI > 0 indicates a preference for the experimental compound, PI < 0 indicates an aversion to the experimental compound, and PI = 0 indicates no effect of the compound on feeding behavior.\n8. Cleaning the assay chambers\nPromptly clean the Petri dishes by scraping out the food substrate and rinsing them with unscented soap and water. Soak the Petri dishes overnight in distilled water. Check that the dividing seal in each dish is still watertight, then let the dish air dry.\n\tNOTE: After ensuring that there is no residual agarose or dye staining, the Petri dishes are ready to use again.\nSubscription Required.
