First, we will go over how to use the CRISPOR tool to design guide sequences complementary to the flanks of the genomic region to be knocked out. Once the guide sequences are designed, we will walk you through the process of cloning them in the pgRNA-humanized vector.\nDesigning guide sequences for region of interest. The steps outlined below can be used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of the target region:\nSearch the region of interest in the designated assembly of UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/[href=https://genome.ucsc.edu/]).\nSelect your target region.\nObtain the flanking region sequence of targeted DNA by selecting the flanks.\nClick on ‘View’ option.\nIn the dropdown menu, click on ‘DNA’ and then click on ‘Get DNA’.\nCritical: We recommend designing at least two separate pairs of guide sequences for each target.\nNote: The size of the flanks would depend on the objective of experiment. For deletion of a gene or a non-coding region, larger flanks (50–100 bp) can be selected. For smaller deletions like deletion of transcription factor binding motifs, guide sequences should be designed very close to region to be deleted, thus limiting the flexibly of selecting the flanks.\nCritical: It is not necessary to target the complete gene in order to knock it out. Targeting one or a few exons along with promoter is sufficient to perturb the gene.\nPaste this sequence into the CRISPOR tool (http://crispor.tefor.net[href=http://crispor.tefor.net]) (Concordet and Haeussler, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and choose the correct genome (organism) and PAM that is recognized by the Cas9 protein in use.",
    "Note: The Cas9 protein used in the study recognizes NGG as the PAM site.\nLook for guide sequences with high specificity and few predicted off-targets.\nAdd the following nucleotide sequences to your guide sequence: GGAGAACCACCTTGTTGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTT (where (N)20 is the guide sequence).\nGet the 63-nucleotide long DNA guide sequence synthesized.\nNote: 63 nucleotide long guide sequences can be synthesized in desalted form. We routinely purchase these oligos from local vendors but they can be purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technology).\nNote: We have successfully created lines with deletions ranging from 1 Kb to 3 Kb with this protocol. However, it can be used to knockout smaller or larger regions as well.\nOligos designing for validation of knockout clones. To screen the colonies for deletion, oligos for PCR validation are to be designed. Design two oligo sets, one within the target region (PCRin) and the other outside the target region (PCRout), as shown in the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Get the designed surveyor oligos synthesized.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1121-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic illustrating the design of oligos for PCR validation of knockout clones\nNote: Oligos can be designed manually or with the help of a primer designing tool. The knockout amplicon of less than 500 bp is recommended.\nCloning of guide sequences in pgRNA-humanized vector\nFor sgRNA PCR amplification, the designed 63 nucleotides long guide sequence is used as a forward oligo, universal reverse oligo (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) is used as a reverse oligo and the pgRNA-humanized vector as a template (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). To amplify the full-length sgRNA, set up a 100 μL PCR reaction with any proofreading polymerase. For KOD DNA Polymerase following reaction is used:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_2.csv\nNote: Universal reverse oligo can be used for amplification of any sgRNA that is to be cloned in pgRNA-humanized vector.",
    "Run 5 μL of the PCR product on 1.8% agarose gel. An amplicon of 133 bp size will be visible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nClean up the remaining PCR product with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit after verifying the success of PCR.\nElute the DNA in 25 μL of nuclease-free water.\nSet up the digestion of purified PCR product with BstXI and XhoI restriction enzymes as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_3.csv\nSimilarly, set up the digestion of pgRNA-humanized vector with BstXI and XhoI restriction enzymes to linearize it:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_4.csv\nIncubate the digestion mixture overnight (14–16 h) in water bath set at 37°C.\nRun both the digested vector and insert on 1.0% and 1.8% agarose gels respectively (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nExcise the gel slices containing DNA fragments (8.3 kb for vector and approx. 125 bp for sgRNA) from the respective gels.\nExtract the DNA from the gel slices with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit from Qiagen. To extract DNA from the gel, follow the instructions included with the kit.\nTo integrate the digested sgRNAs into the pgRNA-humanized vector, set up a ligation reaction as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_5.csv\nNote: Remember to set up a control ligation reaction that doesn't include the digested sgRNA.\nIncubate the ligation samples overnight (14–16 h) at 16°C.\nTransform the ligated plasmid into DH5α strain of E. coli and plate it on agar plate with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nNext day, inoculate at least 10 colonies from the agar plate into tubes containing 3 mL LB broth supplemented with 100 ug/mL of ampicillin. Allow the bacteria to grow at 37°C for overnight (14–16 h) with constant shaking.\nUsing the QIAGEN Plasmid Mini kit, isolate the plasmid from the inoculated colonies. Follow the protocol that comes with the kit.",
    "For screening the positive clones, set up a digestion reaction (as in Step 3e) with BstXI and XhoI (scale down the reaction to 15 μL).\nNote: In order to clearly see the release, minimum 1 ug of plasmid DNA should be taken for restriction digestion.\nRun the digested samples on 1.8% agarose gel (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nPerform Sanger sequencing on clones that show approx. 125 bp fragment release. Confirm that the clone contains your desired sgRNA with no mutations.\nCritical: Test whether your sgRNAs work before proceeding for the rest of the protocol. Transfect the cell line of interest with lentiCas9 Blast and pgRNA-humanized containing your sgRNAs. Select the cells with puromycin (3 μg/ml) for 48 h, harvest the cells and isolate genomic DNA and set up PCRs with PCRout oligos. Presence of both wild type and knockout (faint) bands confirms that the sgRNAs are functional. In that case one can proceed with the rest of the protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1121-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Post screening gel image showing the approx. 125 bp release from 8 different positive clones\nProduction of lentiviruses in HEK293FT cells\nTiming: ∼6 days\nThis section describes how lentiviruses carrying sgRNA constructs and lentiCas9-Blast vector are made. Once the lentiviruses are ready, the subsequent steps will guide you to transduce the cells.\nCell culture. HEK293FT and HeLa cell lines are maintained/cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v) and 5% PenStrep (v/v) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Passage both cell lines every 3 days.",
    "Note: Early passage (less than 30) HEK293FT cell line should be used for viral production.\nCritical: HEK293FT cells should be cultured on poly-D lysine-treated plates before transfection because these cells detach from the untreated plate surface following transfection.\nCell preparation for transfection (Late Evening)\nAspirate medium and add 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA to 10 cm dish of HEK293FT cells. Incubate the plate for 1–2 min at 37°C.\nRemove trypsin from the plate carefully to avoid disturbing the cells. Gently tap the plate to dislodge the cells.\nCollect and resuspend cells in 3 mL of fresh culture media.\nSeed 0.8 × 106 cells on poly-D lysine-coated 35 mm dishes ∼14 h before transfection. Place the plate back into incubator.\nCritical: At the time of transfection, the cells should be 60–65% confluent. Both low and high confluency will reduce the transfection efficiency, and as a result, also the viral titer.\nPlasmid transfection (Early Morning) Transfection mixture of DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 is to be prepared in Opti-MEM medium as follows:\nAdd 100 μL Opti-MEM and 3 μg (0.6 μg each of psPAX2, pCMV-VSVG, pgRNA-humanized sgRNA1, pgRNA-humanized sgRNA2 and lentiCas9-Blast) DNA to tube A.\nAdd 150 μL Opti-MEM and 6 μL lipofectamine 2000 to tube B.\nMix the contents of both tubes thoroughly by pipetting.\nAdd the contents of tube B to tube A and mix thoroughly.\nShort spin tube A to collect the liquid from the tube walls.\nIncubate the transfection mixture at room temperature (25°C) for 25 min.\nMeanwhile, remove the spent medium from the plate to be transfected and add 0.75 mL of fresh Opti-MEM to it.\nAdd the transfection mixture (tube A) to the cells after 25 min. Swirl the plate to evenly distribute the mixture. Incubate the cells for 6 h at 37°C.",
    "Remove the transfection mixture from the cells after 6 h of transfection. Add 2 mL fresh media to the plate and incubate it for 48 h in the incubator.\nNote: The above-mentioned transfection protocol is for 35 mm dishes. If larger dishes are used, the recipe should be scaled up accordingly.\nViral Particle collection and transduction\nAfter 48 h, take the plates out of the incubator and transfer the medium containing viral particles to a sterile 15 mL falcon tube (Falcon A).\nStore the Falcon A at 4°C and incubate the cells for next 24 h with 1 mL of fresh media at 37°C.\nSeed 0.7 × 106 HeLa cells (or any cell line of interest) in 35 mm dish approx. 14 h prior to transduction.\nRemove the media from HEK293FT cell plate after 24 h and transfer it to Falcon A.\nFilter the entire viral particle-containing media by passing it through 0.45-micron syringe-driven filters. Collect the filtered media in fresh sterile 15 mL tubes.\nCheck the volume of filtered media you have and add 8 μg/mL polybrene.\nAdd 2 mL of this filtered media to HeLa cells in 35 mm dishes (or any other cell line of interest).\nRemove the medium after 12–14 h of transduction. Incubate the cells for 24 h with 2 mL fresh media.\nNote: If you can't work with/make viruses, cells can be transfected with lentiCas9 Blast and pgRNA-humanized vector with lipofectamine. Because the efficiency of transfection is less than transduction, in that situation approximately 45%–60% of cells will die after puromycin selection.\nSelection of sgRNA-positive cells and seeding of single cells\nTiming: ∼20 days\nThe selection of cells transduced with sgRNAs, followed by single cell seeding in the 96 well plates is discussed in this section.\nSelection of cells transfected with sgRNAs",
    "To select the sgRNA positive cells, add 3 μg/mL puromycin to the transduced cells for 48 h.\nRemove the media and wash the cells twice with DPBS to remove any dead cells.\nAdd 0.3 mL trypsin and incubate at 37°C for 1–2 min.\nCarefully remove the trypsin and tap the plate to dislodge the cells.\nCollect the cells and resuspend them in 2 mL of fresh media without puromycin.\nNote: Puromycin concentration varies from cell line to cell line. Use the concentration which is desired for cell line of your interest.\nSingle cells seeding in 96 well plates\nUsing a cell counter, count the number of cells per mL of media. Count the cells at least three times and if the difference between the three readings is small, the average should be used to minimize the variation.\nAdd the media and cells to the sterile reagent reservoirs.\nDilute the cells such that 100 μL of DMEM contains only one cell.\nUsing the 100 μL multi-channel pipette, add 100 μL of DMEM-containing cells to the 96 well plate.\nCritical: Seed at least five 96 well plates to get clones with homozygous deletion for aneuploid cell lines.\nNote: Instead of seeding single cells by dilution method, cell sorters can be used to seed cells in 96 well plates. Sorting can be done using the mCherry marker, which is coded from the pgRNA humanized vector along with puromycin.\nThe next day, observe each well under light microscope at 20× resolution to label the wells containing single cell.\nDisregard the wells that have no cell or more than one cell.\nAllow the single cells to form colonies.\nChange the media every 3–4 days, taking care not to lose the cells.",
    "Note: It takes approx. 15–20 days for HeLa cells to form colonies that are big enough to be processed further.\nCritical: If the single cells aren't visible the following day, wait 2–3 days for the cells to form minute colonies that can be easily seen under a microscope. Mark the wells that contain single colonies.\nNote: At least 25–30 wells in a 96-well plate would contain single cells. From five 96-well plates, 100–125 single clones are expected for final screening.\nScreening of knockout clones\nTiming: ∼ 5 days\nThis final section will cover the genomic DNA isolation from the cells, followed by PCRs to screen for the colonies carrying homozygous knockout of the region of interest.\nGenomic DNA isolation\nAdd 50 μL of trypsin to the colonies and transfer them to 48-well plates with 0.5 mL media. Allow the cells to grow for 2–3 days.\nTrypsinize the cells once they are 80–90% confluent by adding 100 μL trypsin to each well. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL media.\nTransfer half of the cells to 1.5 mL tubes for screening, and the other half should be seeded in the same wells.\nSpin the tubes at 600 rcf for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and remove the excess media from the tubes by inverting them on a tissue paper.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 μL of genomic DNA isolation buffer. Pipette thoroughly until the sample's viscosity is reduced. Incubate the samples overnight (14–16 h) at 50°C.\nAdd an equal volume of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl (PCI) alcohol to the sample and vortex for 1 min.\nSpin the tubes at 13500 rcf for 12 min at 4°C.\nCollect the aqueous phase with care without disturbing the interphase, and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Note: Genomic DNA should also be isolated from wild type cells. The nature of clones must be determined by comparison to this control.\nCritical: If the aqueous phase appears viscous, add more digestion buffer to the sample and repeat the PCI extraction.\nTo the sample, add 1/10th volume of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. Vortex the tubes and place them in a −20°C freezer for an hour.\nPellet the precipitated DNA by centrifuging the tubes for 12 min at 4°C at 13500 rcf.\nTo remove residual salt, wash the pellet twice with 70% ethanol. Decant the ethanol and allow the pellet to air dry for 15–20 min.\nDissolve the DNA pellet in 100 μL TE buffer.\nNote: If necessary, RNA contaminants can be removed by treating the sample with RNase A.\nPause point: Extracted DNA can be stored at −20°C for further processing.\nValidation of knockout clones\nNote: In our study, we used Kapa Taq DNA polymerase for validation PCRs. Other Taq-based polymerases can also be used, but the supplier's protocol must be followed in that case.\nPrepare the PCR mix for the validation of clones (PCRout) as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_6.csv\nAdd 2 μL of genomic DNA obtained from Step 10l to the PCR mix.\nCritical: The concentration of DNA in manually isolated samples cannot be accurately measured. If the desired amplicon is not observed, more volume of template DNA can be taken.\nAdjust the PCR to the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_7.csv\nRun all of the samples on an agarose gel (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nCritical: Determine the percentage of gel based on the expected size of amplicon.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1121_8.csv",
    "Note: Only the wild type amplicon will be visible in the control sample. Clones with no deletion will have an amplicon similar to the control. Heterozygous clones will produce two distinct amplicons: 1. wild type and 2. knockout amplicon. The homozygous deletion clones show a single amplicon of expected size after deletion.\nComplement the above PCR results with another round of PCRs with PCRin oligo set to confirm the outcome of the clones.\nCritical: The control sample will only show one amplicon of the expected molecular weight. Clones with no deletion and heterozygous deletions will also produce an amplicon of the same size as the control sample. Clones with homozygous deletion will not show any amplification.\nOptional: If the knockout region codes for a protein, the clones can be further validated using western blotting. qRT PCR can be used to test the expression of regions that are transcribed into RNA.\nCritical: The PCR product from the validated knockout clones should be sent for Sanger sequencing to rule out the possibility of nucleotide insertion or more than expected deletion at the junction of deleted region (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Sequence multiple clones for further molecular characterization of deleted line.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1121-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
