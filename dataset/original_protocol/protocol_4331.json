    "Determine the number of wells needed for the assay. The test should be performed at least in duplicate. Following the ELISA worksheet example below, if you test in duplicate 8 serial dilutions of an unknown protein/peptide plus the same dilutions of polymyxin B (positive inhibition control) and a known protein/peptide with no binding ability to LPS (negative inhibition control) you need 52 wells: 3 x 8 x 2 = 48 wells for protein/peptide dilutions, two wells with LPS-FITC (reference control) and two wells without LPS-FITC (negative control).    Add 200 µl of casein hydrolysate solution to the wells of a 96-well microplate. Seal the microplate with the adhesive film and incubate overnight at 4 °C without shaking.    Separately, prepare a 2x solution of LPS O111: B4-FITC conjugate (5 µg/ml) and 2x serial dilutions of the protein/peptide to be tested (starting dilution 80 µg/ml) in PBS-EDTA. Prepare the same dilutions of polymyxin B (positive inhibition control) and a negative inhibition control (e.g., ovalbumin). Eight serial ¼ dilutions are optimal for most proteins. For the ELISA worksheet example prepare:   2x solution of LPS-FITC: 3.5 ml of LPS-FITC at 5 µg/ml in PBS-EDTA.   2x serial dilutions of the proteins/peptides in PBS-EDTA:   Table 1.

    "Mix 120 µl of LPS-FITC solution (2x) with 120 µl of each dilution (2x) or PBS-EDTA (reference control) in individual microcentrifuge tubes, mix well, and incubate the samples for 1 h at RT.    Aspirate the content of the wells coated with the casein hydrolysate and wash 3 times with 200 µl of PBS (no soak) at RT without shaking.   Immediately, add 100 µl of the preincubated solutions or PBS-EDTA (negative control) to each well in duplicate. Seal the microplate and incubate for 30 min at RT under shaking at 750 rpm.   Wash the plate 5 times with 200 µl of PBS-T (no soak) at RT without shaking.    Add 100 µl of sheep anti-FITC: HRP diluted 1/4,000 in PBS-T. Seal the microplate and incubate for 30 min at RT under shaking at 750 rpm.   Wash the plate as described in step 7.   Prepare the chromogen [o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD)] solution following the manufacturer’s instructions.    Add 100 µl of the OPD solution to each well and incubate for 20 min at RT, without shaking and in the dark.    Add 25 µl of 3 N H2SO4 to each well to stop the reaction.    Read the absorbance of the wells at 492 nm within 30 min.    The percentage of inhibition for each protein dilution is calculated according to the formula: [(average OD reference control) - (average OD protein dil + LPS-FITC)]/ (average OD reference control) x 100. OD: Optical density.  *Alternatively, incubations in steps 6 and 8 can be performed in an incubator for 1 h at 37 °C without shaking, after sealing the plate with the adhesive film.   Table 2.
