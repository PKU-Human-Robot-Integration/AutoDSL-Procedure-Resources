    "1. Tissue Harvest and Freezing of Muscle Tissues\nEuthanize the mouse with an overdose of isoflurane (2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoro-ethane). Perform this step in a fume hood and use a secondary containment method such as a desiccator or a bell jar containing a cotton swab soaked in isoflurane.\nConfirm death by firmly squeezing footpad. Use a secondary method of euthanasia such as cervical dislocation.\nWet the fur with 70% alcohol to reduce the sticking of loose hair strands on the muscles. Peel the skin off the limb using a fine forceps such as #5.\nCarefully separate the muscle of interest (tibialis anterior (TA) in this case) from the bones underneath, starting from the tendon and remove.\nExcise the muscle, cover it in OCT (Optimum Cutting Temperature compound), and lay it flat on a labeled disposable freezing mold. Make sure that the muscle is at its normal physiological orientation (head to tail) without stretching. Alternatively, freeze the muscle on small styrofoam squares and pin it using insect pins to ensure the correct length of the muscles.\nChill 2-methylbutane (isopentane) in a steel beaker using liquid nitrogen. This takes on average 3 - 5 min. Keep stirring intermittently until white precipitates start to form on the bottom and walls of the beaker.\n\tNOTE: When this occurs, isopentane has reached optimal freezing temperature (-150 °C)\nDip the molds containing muscles in the chilled 2-methylbutane. Freeze small muscles such as the diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) for 6 - 12 sec and larger muscles like the gastrocnemius soleus (GS) and triceps for 15 - 20 sec. Do not freeze the muscles for too long as this may lead to cracking.",
    "Transfer the frozen tissues on to dry ice and let the isopentane evaporate (note that this process takes on average around 15 - 20 min). Wrap the tissues in aluminum foil and store them at ultra low temperature (-70 °C to -80 °C) until sectioning.\n2. Embedding the Tissues in OCT to Prepare Tissue Block\nTransport tissues on dry ice to cyrostat to prevent thawing. Transfer tissue to cryostat chamber (set at -20 to -24 °C to avoid full thawing of tissues) and let them equilibrate for 30 min.\nTurn the Peltier bay cooling on. If the cryostat does not have this cooling, use aerosol cooling spray to quickly freeze the OCT. Do not let the muscle thaw at any point during the embedding as this can result in freeze damage.\nAdd a uniform thin layer of OCT on the specimen disc and let it cool. When most of the OCT is frozen on the bottom while still liquid on the top, insert the tissue at the correct orientation (perpendicular to OCT for transverse sections and parallel to OCT for longitudinal sections). Use aerosol cooling spray to quickly freeze OCT. Touch the unembeded part of the tissue with heat extractor and wait for 45 sec.\nAdd another thin layer of OCT around the muscle, spray with aerosol cooling spray and extract the heat as in the previous step.\nKeep adding OCT in small increments and quickly freeze the OCT using a combination of aerosol cooling spray and heat extractor until the whole muscle is covered.\nPut the heat extractor on the top of the tissue block and wait for 5 min.\n3. Preparing Sections and Identifying the Sections from Mid-belly Region of the Muscles",
    "Mount the specimen onto the specimen head. Tighten the knob to secure the disc. Make sure that the specimen disc is in good contact with the specimen head.\nAdjust the chamber temperature to between -21 and -24 °C and wait until the set temperature is achieved.\nAdjust the thickness settings (7 µm); trim the block by advancing or retracting the block using coarse and fine settings.\nCollect the sections on pre-warmed positively charged microscope slides by pressing the top of the slide onto the sections, using the attraction between opposite charges to facilitate the adherence of the cut sections to the slide.\nIdentify the mid-belly sections by measuring cross-sectional area (CSA) of the sections. Do this using imaging software on the computer that is connected to the microscope.\n\tNOTE: Phase contrast images are taken and circumference of the entire muscle is measured via a tracing function on the software program. This will yield both CSA as well as minimum ferret diameter (measure of fiber cross-sectional size that is expressed as the smallest distance between two parallel tangents on opposite sides of a particle) measurements. Note: When CSA and minimum ferret diameter measurements begin to plateau, mid belly has been reached.\nInventory and archive the slides at -80 °C for future staining.\n\tNOTE: OCT does not need to be removed prior to staining procedures. Once slides are coverslipped, they are ready to be stained immediately.\n4. Staining\nNOTE: While detailed step-by-step procedures can be found on the product data sheet and should be followed for staining procedures, personal optimization may be required to obtain optimal staining.",
    "Because mounting media (see table) is not miscible with water, dehydrate slides through increasing grades of alcohol (2 min each in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol) and clear them with xylene (100% for 5 min) to ensure slides do not become opaque over time.\nCoverslip sections and let them dry. Image with microscope equipped with imaging software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
