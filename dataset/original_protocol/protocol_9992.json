    "1. Semiautomated \"plate to plate\" sample transfer preparation\nGenerate a CSV file as shown in Figure 1 containing source and destination plates using a spreadsheet editing application. The CSV file that is generated must have the following header columns in the order listed: Source_barcode; Destination_barcode; Source_well; Dest_well; Transfer_volume.   \nUnder the header columns, make sure to include one row in the CSV file for each desired pipetting operation (i.e., sample transfer) with the following information:\n\t\nSource_barcode: Alphanumeric barcode of the source microplate, e.g., S1007372; leave blank if no barcode is associated.\nDestination_barcode: Alphanumeric barcode of the destination microplate, e.g., D0573282; leave blank if no barcode is associated.\nSource_well: Alphanumeric row and column identifier for well to be pipetted out of from source plate, e.g., H10 for row H (8th row), column 10 (ANSI/SLAS standard well designations, e.g., A1, C10…).\nDest_well: Alphanumeric row and column identifier for well to be pipetted out of from destination plate, e.g., A3 for row A (1st row), column 3 (ANSI/SLAS standard well designations, e.g., A1, C10…).\nTransfer_volume: Volume to be transferred from source_well in source_barcode to dest_well in destination_barcode (numeric and unitless: typically in µL).\nOpen the Microplate Assistive Pipetting Light Emitter Plate to plate GUI application, shown in Figure 2, by opening the Light Guide program (Maple-LightGuide.exe).\nClick the Select cherrypick file button in the upper left corner of the GUI.\nUse the file browser window, shown in Figure 3, to navigate to the CSV file generated in steps 1.1 and 1.2 above and click the Open button. The application will parse the first row of the CSV file and illuminate the corresponding wells in the source and destination plates.",
    "Use the Previous well and Next well buttons, in the upper right corner of the GUI, shown in Figure 4, to traverse the CSV file as desired. The GUI will highlight in grey any rows which have been previously illuminated and highlight in brown the currently active row.\nPerform pipetting operations as needed to transfer samples between source well of source plate to destination well of destination plate. An example of a M.A.P.L.E. unassisted hand pipetting operation can be seen in Figure 5, with a comparison of the current user pipetting view seen in Figure 4 and Figure 6. In addition to the user GUI, plate barcodes can be verified via the LCD displays attached to the illumination panels.\nContinue until the end of the CSV file is reached via the Next well button. To load a new CSV file, the Select cherrypick file may be clicked at any time. To exit the program the red X at the top right corner of the GUI can be clicked.\n2. Multi-well illuminations for parallel transfers and serial dilutions\nOpen the Microplate Assistive Pipetting Light Emitter 'Serial dilution' application by opening the serial dilution program (Maple-SerialDilution.exe).\nUse the GUI, shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, to specify the desired titration mode (column or row), plate density and start row(s) or column(s). The GUI also allows users to specify a column or row mask to control which LEDs in a given row or column are illuminated. This allows a subset of LEDs in a row or column to be illuminated instead of illuminating the entire row or column.",
    "Use the Next and Previous buttons to step through the rows or columns in sequence from the initial start row or column to the last row or column in the plate. Each time the Next or Previous button is clicked, the light panel will illuminate the corresponding LEDs of the microplate.\nContinue until the end of the titration sequence is reached. To exit the program, click the red X at the top right corner of the GUI.\n3. Laboratory training: assay development and screening format techniques\nPlace a 96- or 384-well microplate into the portable light guide. The portable light guide contains a battery and all electronics necessary to be used independently of a computer. This allows the portable lightguide to be used in a handheld mode which can be controlled with built-in pushbuttons to toggle between demonstration modes.\nUse the power toggle switch on the portable light guide enclosure to power the system on.\nDetermine the mode for the portable light guide to be in. By default, the portable light guide will load into the default HTS demo mode which provides users with a visual representation of a typical assay plate as seen in Figure 9. In this mode, one can use the right pushbutton switch at the top of the portable light guide to toggle through the following sample illumination patterns.\n\t\nAll wells illuminated with red color to simulate the reagent dispense of an assay, e.g., (suspended cells in media).\nAll wells illuminated with a yellow color to simulate dye reagent addition.\nFirst column and last column of wells illuminated green, remaining middle 'sample field' columns illuminated blue to indicate plate being read on microplate reader. Random wells in the sample field will also have green color of varying intensity to represent hits.",
    "To toggle the light guide between HTS demo mode and Titration demo mode, push the left pushbutton switch. Doing so will switch the portable light guide to the Titration demo mode which provides a visual guide to users to understand how titrations can be performed in compound plates. When the light guide enters the Titration demo mode, the following will occur.\n\t\nAll wells in column 3 and 13 are illuminated with yellow color.\nSubsequent presses of the rightmost pushbutton switch illuminates columns in sequence, e.g., (4 and 14, 5 and 15, etc.).\nWhen the pushbutton is pressed after columns 12 and 22 are reached, wells in columns 4-12 and 13-22 are illuminated in decreasing intensity of yellow to represent the titration.\nTo modify the default behavior of the light guide, plug the portable light guide to a computer via a USB cable and follow the detailed instructions for updating the default firmware via the Arduino IDE which can be found on the project GitHub page8. By updating the firmware, you can modify these modes to display other sequences or sets of LEDs.\n4. Illumination of artifacts in microplates\nPlace a 96- or 384-well microplate into the portable light guide.\nSwitch the light guide to Illumination mode by pressing the leftmost pushbutton switch two times.\n\tNOTE: An example of the practical use of this mode can be seen in Figure 10 and Figure 11, where compounds have precipitated out of solution and can be observed on the bottom of the microplates. Without backlit illumination, most of the precipitate is invisible to the naked eye, but M.A.P.L.E. backlighting reveals precipitate for user inspection and photographic documentation.",
    "Use the right pushbutton to toggle between a set of predefined colors as needed for the application. The light panel will turn all LEDs on to the following colors in sequence with each push of the right button: red, blue, green, orange, white, violet, yellow and indigo.\nAs an optional step, use a camera or smartphone to photograph the illuminated plate for recordkeeping or documenting the work.\nSubscription Required.
