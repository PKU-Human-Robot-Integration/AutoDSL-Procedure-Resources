    "Cell cultureNote: This protocol was optimized for nuclear isolation and chromatin fractionation of roughly 4 x 107 A549 cells (for A549 cells that is approximately two 100% confluent 150 mm cell culture dishes). This number of cells was chosen for efficient nuclear isolation as described in Procedure B. This protocol can be used for other cell types but should be optimized accordingly.For each condition, grow roughly 4 x 107 A549 cells in F-12K media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. Note: Time treatments such that the required cell number is reached at the time of harvest.Harvest cells using trypsin and combine into one 15 ml tube per condition.Centrifuge for 2 min, 500 x g, room temperature using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor SX4750).Wash cells once with 10 ml of PBS and centrifuge again for 2 min, 500 x g, room temperature.Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet. Flash freeze samples in liquid nitrogen.Store samples at -80 °C until ready to process.Nuclear isolationNote: This section describes two alternative methods for nuclear isolation. The procedure detailed in B1 yields a clean nuclear fraction but B2 is recommended for highly mobile nuclear proteins that are lost from the nuclear fraction when mild detergents are used as described in B1 (see example in Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170313/20170313093302_3981.jpgFigure 2. Fractionation of nuclear protein HMGB1 can differ depending on the method of nuclear isolation. Western blot of chromatin fractionation of A549 cells using different methods of nuclear isolation. HMGB1 is lost from nuclei during nuclear isolation B1 using NP-40 and a sucrose cushion. HMGB1 is retained in the nuclear fraction during isolation of nuclei with the alternative method described in step B2.Nuclear isolation using mild detergent and sucrose cushion.",
    "Note: This section describes permeabilizing the cell membrane using a mild detergent (NP-40), followed by separation of the nuclei from cytoplasmic debris by sucrose cushion. The sucrose cushion consists of a layer with 1.2 M sucrose at the bottom (Buffer II) and a layer with 0.32 M sucrose on top (Buffer I, Figure 3A). The nuclei are more dense than the 1.2 M sucrose buffer and will pellet at the bottom of the tube while the less dense cytoplasmic debris will remain in the upper sucrose layer (Figure 3B). Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).In the meantime, prepare one aliquot each of Buffer I.A and I.B by addition of PMSF, DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail immediately before use (see Recipes for final concentrations). Add NP-40 to Buffer I.B.Gently resuspend cells in 2 ml of Buffer I.A using a 5 ml pipette. Avoid the formation of bubbles.Set aside 50 μl of the cell suspension in a new tube labeled ‘cells fraction’.Add 2 ml of Buffer I.B containing NP-40 to the 2 ml of cell suspension and mix gently by inverting the tube 2-3 times.Incubate samples on ice for 10 min. Mix gently by inverting after 5 min.Pipette 8 ml of ice-cold Buffer II into 30 ml reusable centrifuge tubes (one per sample).Carefully layer cell suspension onto Buffer II (Figure 3A).If the number of tubes is even, balance the tubes with Buffer I.A before centrifugation. If the number of tubes is uneven, use an additional tube containing water as balance.Centrifuge for 20 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C using benchtop centrifuge (Allegra X-14R with rotor FX6100) with low brakes (deceleration setting 1 for this centrifuge model, 5-10 min of deceleration for other centrifuge models) to avoid disruption of pellet.",
    "Note: Use the adapters listed in the Equipment section under 4 to fit the 30 ml reusable centrifuge tubes into the FX6100 rotor. The nuclei form a dense pellet at the bottom of the tube while the cytoplasmic debris remains in the upper sucrose layer, Figure 3C.Carefully remove the supernatant using a transfer pipette. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170314/20170314012829_7646.jpgFigure 3. Intermediate steps of nuclear isolation.

Pellet of nuclei after spin at 10,000 x g indicated by red arrow. The buffers were removed before these pictures were taken.Nuclear isolation by manual disruptionNote: Using mild detergents such as NP-40 for nuclear isolation is important to ensure that the nuclear membrane remains largely intact. In some cases, highly mobile nuclear proteins such as HMGB1 (Sapojnikova et al., 2005) may diffuse out of the nucleus upon isolation with this method. To prevent loss of these proteins from the nuclear fraction, we adapted an alternative method that relies on a hypotonic buffer and subsequent manual disruption of the cell membrane using a Dounce homogenizer. The short centrifugation times in this step minimize diffusion of these proteins out of the nuclei (Figure 2). Thaw cells on ice (about 10 min until pellet is loose).",
    "Gently resuspend cells in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and transfer into a 1.7 ml tube using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips) to avoid disrupting the cellular membranes.Set aside 25 μl of the cell suspension in a new tube as ‘cells fraction’. Note: This is proportional to the 50 μl aliquot taken from 2 ml of cell suspension in step B1.Incubate on ice for 30 min.Pre-cool the Dounce homogenizer and the pestle on ice for at least 5 min.Transfer the cell suspension to cold Dounce homogenizer using a transfer pipette.Disrupt the cell membrane using 40 strokes of the tight-fitting pestle. Minimize the formation of bubbles.Transfer sample to 1.7 ml tube using a transfer pipette.Centrifuge for 5 min, 1,500 x g, 4 °C using a tabletop centrifuge.Carefully remove the supernatant using a P1000 pipette. Transfer supernatant and label as ‘cytosol fraction’ if desired. Keep pellet containing the nuclei and proceed to Procedure C. Note: The nuclei form a loose pellet at the bottom of the tube that can be easily disturbed. The cytoplasmic fraction in step B1 is too dilute to isolate as a result of the sucrose cushion.Micrococcal nuclease digestionNote: In this step the DNA is digested to the length of mono-nucleosomes (roughly 150 bp) using MNase. While partial MNase digest in combination with nuclear fractionation by salt gradient can be used to separate euchromatin from heterochromatin (Teves and Henikoff, 2012), our protocol aims to identify global association of proteins with chromatin and does not distinguish between different types of chromatin. Subsequently, it is important that the DNA is completely digested into mono-nucleosomes to break up chromatin and allow for elution of all soluble proteins in Procedure D (Figure 4).",
    "EGTA is used instead of EDTA to stop the MNase digestion as EGTA preferentially chelates Ca2+ ions that are necessary for MNase enzymatic activity but does not impact Mg2+ ions important for protein-protein interactions. Proteins loosely bound to chromatin elute during MNase digest and can be detected in the supernatant collected in this section of the protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170314/20170314013108_4433.jpgFigure 4. Digestion of cellular DNA using MNase. Agarose gel analysis of DNA extracted from nuclei during a time course of MNase treatment. The position of DNA bands corresponding to mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes are indicated on the left while the DNA size in base pairs (bp) is indicated on the right. Without MNase digestion (0 min), cellular DNA barely enters the agarose gel because of the large size of the DNA molecules. After 1 min of MNase digestion, DNA fragments show the characteristic banding pattern of multiples of 150 bp. After 5 min the DNA fragments correspond to one to three nucleosomes in length. After 30 min most DNA fragments are close to 150 bp, indicating the desired digestion of cellular DNA necessary for optimal chromatin fractionation. The high concentration of DNA causes the slightly lower shift of the mono-nucleosome band. The nuclei used for this time course were isolated using method B.1. No differences in MNase digestion efficiency have been observed with nuclei isolated using method B.2.Prepare and cool Buffer III.A and III.B.Add 400 μl Buffer III.A to the nuclei.Gently resuspend the nuclei using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips) to avoid disrupting the nuclear membranes. Add 5 μl of MNase (1 U) and incubate at 37 °C (in a water bath) for 30 min.Mix every 10 min by gently inverting the tube 2-3 times.After 30 min, add 25 μl of ice-cold 0.",
    "1 M EGTA to stop the digest.Set aside a 60 μl aliquot of the nuclear suspension as ‘nuclei fraction’ and for DNA isolation to confirm the sufficient digest of DNA (described in Procedure E).Centrifuge for 10 min, 400 x g, 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ‘MNase fraction’.Wash the nuclei once by resuspending them in 400 μl Buffer III.B.Centrifuge again for 10 min, 400 x g, 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Chromatin fractionationNote: In this step the nuclei are further fractionated using buffers with increasing amounts of NaCl. Proteins only weakly bound to DNA are expected to be soluble under low salt conditions and will elute from nuclei in the buffers with low NaCl concentration. Proteins tightly bound to chromatin only become soluble under high salt conditions and only elute from nuclei in the buffers with high NaCl concentration.Gently resuspend the nuclei in 400 μl Buffer IV.80 using a P1000 pipette with the tip cut (or wide orifice pipette tips).Rotate at 4 °C for 30 min.Centrifuge for 10 min, 400 x g, 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to fresh tube and label ‘80 mM fraction’.Repeat steps D1-D4 with Buffer IV.150, IV.300 and IV.600 in that order. Keep the supernatants as fractions ‘150 mM’, ‘300 mM’ and ‘600 mM’, respectively.Prepare samples for Western blot immediately (see Table 1 in Procedure F) or store at -20 °C. DNA isolation and DNA gelNote: In this step, DNA is isolated from the samples after MNase digestion to test the length of DNA fragments. The goal is to digest the DNA down to mono-nucleosome level of around 150 bp to ensure optimal chromatin fractionation (Figure 4). It is important that orange G or another small molecular weight dye is used for loading the DNA.",
    "Commonly used DNA loading dyes such as bromophenol blue run around the same size as 150 bp of DNA and may obscure the results. Dilute 10 μl of the ‘nuclei’ fraction in 90 μl H2O for better DNA purification.Use a PCR purification kit to isolate the DNA from this sample following the kit instructions. Elute the DNA in 30 μl of H2O.Take out 5 μl (about 5 μg) of DNA and add 1 μl of 6x Orange G. Keep the rest of the DNA on ice until results are finalized or freeze at -20 °C.Run samples and a 100 bp ladder on a 2% agarose gel containing 1x GelRed at 100 V for 1 h.Visualize the DNA using gel imager and check for prominent DNA band of around 150 bp with minimal DNA laddering (Figure 4).Verifying the quality of nuclear fractionation by Western blotNote: The quality of the nuclear fractionation can be analyzed using SDS-PAGE combined with Western blotting (Figure 1G). Efficient nuclear isolation can be tested by probing for proteins such as tubulin that are only found in the cytoplasm. The quality of chromatin fractionation can be tested by probing for histone proteins such as histone H3 or proteins expected to bind histone tails such as bromodomain containing protein Brd1 (Sanchez et al., 2014). The interaction of the histone H3 and Brd1 with chromatin should only be disrupted under high salt conditions. In addition, proteomics can be performed to identify changes to global chromatin composition under different conditions. Further details concerning mass spectrometry of salt fractions can be found in (Avgousti et al., 2016).  Prepare samples for analysis by Western blotting according to Table 1.Table 1.
