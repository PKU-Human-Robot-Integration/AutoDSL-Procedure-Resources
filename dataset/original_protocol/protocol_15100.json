    "All experiments involving animals followed the regulatory standards approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The demonstrated protocol was approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Phospho-protein Western Blot\nPreparation of lysates\n\t\nCulture cell lines expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase of interest. Harvest cells and plate 3-5 x 106 cells/sample in 400 μl growth medium in a 48-well tissue culture dish. Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2-3 hr.\nAdd 100 μl of 5x TKI solution in growth medium and incubate for 60 min.\nPrepare lysis buffer with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. If cultures will not be treated with pervanadate prior to harvest, add phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 0.1 mM sodium molybdate) to lysis buffer.\nPrepare pervanadate (PV) phosphatase inhibitor solution immediately before use. Prepare a 0.3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (CAUTION) in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a dark tube on ice (1:100 dilution of a 30% stock solution). Boil an aliquot of 0.2 M sodium orthovanadate (OV, CAUTION) stock solution for 5 min. Dilute 1:10 in PBS to make 20 mM OV solution at room temperature (RT). Mix 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and 20 mM OV 1:1 and incubate in the dark at RT for 20 min.\nDilute PV into complete medium (60 μl PV + 940 μl medium). Add 100 μl of diluted PV/well. Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 min and then place plate on ice.",
    "Harvest the cells in cold microfuge tubes at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 120 μl of lysis buffer. Incubate on ice for 15 min. Clarify the lysate in a cold microfuge at 6,000 rpm for 3 min. Transfer supernatant to a fresh cold tube. Store at -80 °C.\nImmunoprecipitation\n\t\nSpin down Protein G sepharose beads in microfuge at 1,000 rpm for 1 min. Remove supernatant and wash beads 2x with 1 ml cold PBS. Add an equal volume of PBS to make a 50% slurry. Add primary antibody and 20 μl 50% Protein G beads to each sample. Incubate for 2 hr - O/N at 4 °C on a rotator.\nPulse down beads in a cold microfuge at 9,000 rpm. Remove supernatant and wash beads 2x with 150 μl cold lysis buffer. Spin in cold microfuge at 1,000 rpm for 1 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 20 μl 2X SDS Sample Buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol (CAUTION). Use immediately or store at -80 °C.\nBoil samples for 5 min and run on an SDS-PAGE tris-glycine gel. Transfer the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane and detect phospho-protein by western blot.\nRinse blot with water and then incubate in 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris (pH  6.8), 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol (CAUTION) for 30 min at 50 °C. Rinse 2x with water and then wash for 60-90 min in 5-6 changes of TBS-T to remove stripping solution.\nDetect total-protein by western blot.\n2. Methylcellulose Assay\nAliquot 4 ml of methylcellulose human base medium into 50 ml conical tubes using a sterile large bore blunt end needle. (Note: Methylcellulose can be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. Thaw at RT O/N prior to use.)",
    "Add 500 μl of 10x TKI or vehicle in growth medium to 4 ml of methylcellulose and vortex mixture for 10 sec.\nHarvest and count cells. Prepare a cell suspension in growth medium in a concentration, which is 10x higher than the final cell concentration. Add 500 μl cell suspension to methylcellulose mixture. Vortex for 10 sec and let sit for 10 min to remove bubbles.\nDraw up 4 ml of methylcellulose mixture using a 5 ml syringe and sterile large bore blunt end needle. Avoid drawing up bubbles. Dispense 1 ml of the methylcellulose mixture into the center of three 35 mm tissue culture plates. Swirl the dishes until the bottom is completely covered with methylcellulose.\nFor each methylcellulose plate, prepare a 10 cm sterile tissue culture plate with two additional 35 mm tissue culture plates filled with sterile water to ensure a humid environment. Place cultures in water jacketed incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10-14 days.\nCount colonies after 1-2 weeks. Colonies should be more than 20 cells and not overlapping. Colonies can be counted using an inverted microscope equipped with a microscope stage with a grid or using an automated colony counter. Changes in colony size or morphology in response to treatment with TKI should also be evaluated. To improve detection by colony counter, stain colonies by adding 60-100 μl of (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, 5 mg/ml in H2O, store at -20 °C, protect from light, CAUTION) drop-wise over the surface of each plate and incubating for 8 hr at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n3. Soft Agar Assay",
    "Prepare 1% noble agar for bottom layer, 0.7% noble agar for top layer and 2x growth medium. Equilibrate 2x growth medium in a 42 °C water bath. Heat 1% and 0.7% noble agar in a microwave (approximately 1 min/100 ml) and equilibrate in a 42 °C water bath. Mix equal parts of 1% agar and 2x medium and separately 0.7% agar and 2x medium in 50 ml conicals. Plan 10 ml of soft agar mixture/six-well plate for each layer.\nLabel 6-well tissue culture plates. Fill each well with 1.5 ml 1% soft agar mixture. Avoid bubbles during plating. Dry plates with lids off in sterile hood for 30 min.\nCount cells. Prepare a cell suspension in growth medium in a concentration, which is 500x higher than the final cell concentration. Add cell suspension to 0.7% agar mixture, mix well and dispense 1.5 ml of the agar cell mixture on the top of the 1% agar layer. Let the top layer solidify for 30 min.\nPrepare 1x growth medium containing TKI or vehicle control. Add 2 ml of medium with desired concentration of TKI on top of the top agar layer.\nIncubate cultures for 10 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Remove and replace the overlaying medium every 3 days.\nWhen colonies are visible to the naked eye, aspirate overlaying medium and add 200 μl nitro-tetrazolium blue solution (1 mg/ml NBT in H2O, store at 4 °C, protect from light, CAUTION). Return to incubator for 24-48 hr. Move to 4 °C for at least 2 hr prior to counting. Stained plates can be stored at 4 °C for one month. Count colonies using a microscope or an automated colony counter.\n4. Evaluation of Phospho-protein Inhibition In vivo",
    "Collect cells growing in log phase by centrifugation in a table top centrifuge at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Wash the cells once with sterile PBS and resuspend in PBS at an appropriate concentration (typically 1-5 x 107 cells/ml). Transplant cells in a volume of 100 μl into 6-12 week old NSG mice by intravenous injection into the tail vein using a 28 G insulin syringe. Place the animal in a restrainer, heat the tail in a beaker of warm water to dilate the veins, and clean the tail with a chlorhexidine swab prior to injection. After injection, apply pressure to the injection site using sterile gauze until bleeding stops. Transplant at least 3 animals/group. Maintain the mice on water containing 1 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate.\nFourteen days post-transplant, treat animals with TKI or vehicle only and harvest samples for analysis of target inhibition. Weigh animals and treat with an appropriate dose (mg/kg of body weight) of TKI or vehicle. Administer treatment in a volume of 5 ml/kg body weight by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or 10 ml/kg body weight by oral gavage. For i.p. injection, restrain the mouse manually and inject in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen using a 29 G needle. For oral gavage, restrain the mouse manually and hold the animal upright. Place the gavage tube in the mouth over the tongue and into the back of the mouth. Apply slight pressure to pass the tube through the esophagus and into the stomach. Depress the syringe plunger to administer treatment. If the plunger does not depress easily the gavage needle should be removed and repositioned. Prepare TKI formulations immediately before use.",
    "If pervanadate treatment is desired, prepare PV solution 20 min before harvest as described above (step 1.1.4) and dilute into medium with 1 μM MgCl2 and 100 U/ml DNase (120 μl PV + 880 μl medium). Note: PV is stable for at least 1 hr after dilution.\nSacrifice animals by CO2 narcosis at the appropriate time(s) post-treatment. Dissect femurs by removing fur, skin and muscle from the entire leg so that the bones are completely exposed. Remove the femurs by clipping with dissecting scissors just below the hip joint and again above the knee joint. Transfer to a Petri dish and flush bone marrow with 1 ml cold PBS or diluted PV solution using a syringe and a 27 G needle. If treating with PV, incubate at RT in the dark for 10 min.\nPrepare lysates and analyze phospho-protein and total-protein levels as indicated above (steps 1.1.6-1.2.5).\nQuantitate relative phospho-protein and total-protein levels for each sample using densitometry. Calculate phospho-protein/total-protein relative to the average phospho-protein/total-protein value for vehicle-treated animals.\n5. Evaluation of Anti-leukemia Activity of TKIs in ALL Xenograft Models\nIf necessary, expose mice to 200 cGy of radiation in a RS-2000 irradiator one day prior to transplant. Transplant mice with leukemia cell lines as described above (step 4.1). Transplant at least 6 mice per group. Identify mice by ear punch. Alternatively, a black marker may be used to identify mice with hash marks on their tails. Add enrichment to cages to reduce the potential for cage mate aggression during the study.",
    "Treat mice with a TKI or vehicle only as described above (step 4.2). Monitor the health status of mice daily via physical examination and weight determination. Expected symptoms of leukemia (reduced activity level, weight loss, hind limb paralysis, and eye infections). Weight loss more than 10%-15% is usually associated with the death of the mouse within two days and is typically a surrogate endpoint for death in accordance with standard IACUC requirements.\nMonitor engraftment and development of leukemia via an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system up to 2x weekly. Prepare a 200x D-luciferin stock solution (30 mg/ml) in sterile water. Mix gently by inversion until D-luciferin is completely dissolved. Use immediately, or aliquot and freeze at -20 °C. Prior to imaging using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system, thaw aliquots of D-luciferin at RT and dilute 1:2 in PBS to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and filter sterilize through a 0.2 μm filter.\nAnesthetize the mice before imaging with 1.5% inhaled isoflurane in oxygen. Monitor sufficient anesthesia, characterized by muscle relaxation, loss of movement, and loss of response to toe-pinch stimulation.\nImmediately before imaging, administer 150 mg/kg body weight D-luciferin by i.p. injection (10 μl of 15 mg/ml luciferin/g of body weight).\nUse an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system to capture 2 series of images with sequential 30, 60 and 90 sec exposures and a final image with a 120 sec exposure. After imaging, return mice to cages and monitor for recovery from anesthesia. Depending on the intensity of bioluminescence, exposure times can be varied. Optimal exposure times should be predetermined for a given model and kept consistent such that the signal intensities for individual time points are comparable across the entire study.",
    "Determine bioluminescence intensity for each mouse using Living Image 3.2 acquisition and analysis software. Determine total flux values measured in photons/second by drawing regions of interest (ROI) of identical size over each mouse.\nSacrifice mice by CO2 exposure and cervical dislocation if moribund, exhibiting paralysis, in the event of greater than 15% weight loss, or at the end of the study. Dissect mice and record observations (e.g. enlargement of spleen, liver, or lymph nodes; pale bone marrow). Dissect femurs and flush bone marrow with cold PBS using a 27 G needle.\nCollect cells in a microfuge at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. Resuspend cells in PBS containing 2% FBS and incubate for 5 min at RT. Collect cells and stain with 20 mg/ml DAPI (4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, 1:1,000) and FITC-conjugated α-hCD45 (1:100) or mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody (1:100). Evaluate leukemia engraftment using flow cytometry. Gate on the viable population (DAPI negative) and determine percentage of CD45+ cells (% bone marrow blasts).\nSubscription Required.
