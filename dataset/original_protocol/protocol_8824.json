    "1. Preparation of Dyes, Buffers and Agarose Gel\nPrepare the following solutions for staining DNA or the digestion of stained DNA.\nPrepare 1x TE (Tris-HCl and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; EDTA) buffer using 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA in a graduated cylinder or volumetric flask. Store at room temperature (18 - 25 °C).\nMake aliquots of each dye: TOTO-1, YOYO-1, POPO-1, BOBO-1, TOTO-3, YOYO-3, POPO-3, BOBO-3 (Table 1). Pipette 4 µL of 1 mM dye into a dark amber or black 1.5 mL tube and add 36 µL of 1x TE, mix using the pipette; this concentration makes a 100 µM dye solution (40 µL total). Complete this step for each dye. Store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid exposing dye to light to prevent photobleaching or degradation of the dye.\nPrepare buffer 1 using 10 mM Bis-Tris-Propane-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 µg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). Prepare buffer 2 using 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 µg/mL BSA. Prepare buffer 3 using 50 mM Potassium Acetate, 20 mM Tris-acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 100 µg/mL BSA. Each enzyme will require one of these specific buffers to function.\nPrepare the following solutions for gel electrophoresis.\nMake a 6x loading dye by combining 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 15% Ficoll in dH2O. Store at room temperature.\nTo make a 0.7% agarose gel, weigh out 0.07 g of high gelling temperature (HGT) agarose in an Erlenmeyer flask, add 100 mL of 1x TAE buffer and place an inverted beaker on top of the flask.\n\t\t\nHeat the solution on a hot plate until bubbles begin to form on the bottom of the flask and float to the top.",
    "Remove the solution from the hot plate, let the solution cool until the flask can be touched with a bare hand, and then pour the gel into a 24.5 cm x 21.8 cm gel mold with a gel comb to create wells.\nRemove bubbles near the comb or on the surface of the gel by popping them with a pipette tip and allow the gel to solidify for at least 15 minutes. This can be stored in a fridge (4 °C) wrapped in plastic wrap for 1 week to prevent drying of the gel or contamination. For more information on how to run a gel refer to Lee et al.33.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use a gel comb with 30 individual wells. Each well should be 4.5 mm wide with a depth of 2 mm. The height of the well will depend on the amount of gel poured into the box.\nPrepare 1x TAE (Tris - acetate - EDTA) buffer using 40 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA. Store at room temperature (18 - 25 °C).\n2. Preparation of Stained DNA\nStain lambda DNA (300-800 ng) using different aliquots of dyes. Each dye (Table 1) will have six different concentrations tested, for a total of 48 reactions per restriction enzyme. The following process outlines a set up for 1 reaction (Figure 1).\nDilute lambda DNA using 1x TE to 100 ng/µL. Store in 4 °C. Make a solution with total volume of 300 µL.\nStain unmethylated lambda DNA. For each band expected from the digest, estimate 75 - 100 ng/band. Add appropriate amounts of dye to produce concentrations of 1.9 µM, 3.8 µM, 19.4 µM, 32.2 µM, 48.3 µM, 63.5 µM / 100 ng of DNA.\nIncubate overnight (15 h - 18 h) at 4 °C.",
    "Leave one reaction unstained to act as a control25.\n\t\tNOTE: Use unmethylated DNA for the digestion reaction. Methylation sensitive enzymes cannot cut methylated regions in DNA and will give an appearance of an incomplete digestion.\n3. Preparation of the Restriction Enzyme Assay\nDigest stained DNA with a restriction enzyme to determine if that enzyme can digest prestained DNA (Figure 1).\nThe following day, add 20 U of restriction enzyme, 3 µL of the appropriate buffer ( Table 2), and distilled, autoclaved and filtered water for a total of 30 µL. For each enzyme reaction, choose the buffer with the highest cutting efficiency, which can be found on the manufacturer's website.\nPlace the reactions in a water bath at the temperature of optimal enzymatic activity, listed in Table 2 for the 6 enzymes used in Maschmann et al., for 2 - 4 h (Table 2)25.\nStop the reaction by adding 2 µL of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0.\n4. Electroeluting Stained DNA in an Agarose Gel\nRemove the sides from the 24.5 cm x 21.8 cm gel mold (Step 1.2.2) and place the gel into the gel electrophoresis box. Pour 2.5 L of 1x TAE buffer into the box. Carefully remove the gel comb from the gel, so the wells are accessible33.\nPipette the restriction enzyme reactions onto a plastic film and combine each reaction with 6x loading dye. For each reaction solution, add 1 µL of 6x loading dye per 5 - 6 µL of DNA solution (1x). Then pipette the reactions (containing the loading dye, <18 µL) into the wells.\nMix 1 µL of 1 kb ladder, 9 µL of 1x TE, and 2 µL of 6x loading dye. Load solution into the wells that flank the other solutions.",
    "Cover the gel box with dark blue or black paper or fabric. Connect the gel box to a power supply, set the power supply to 30 V, and run it overnight (15 - 20 h). Turn off the lights while the gel is running, to prevent photocleavage of the labeled DNA.\nThe next morning turn off the power supply. Take the gel out using the tray and transfer it to a container with 45 µL ethidium bromide and 1 L of 1x TAE buffer. Store the container at room temperature in the dark or cover in foil to prevent exposure to light. Let gel stain for at least 45 min at room temperature.\n\tCAUTION: Use ethidium bromide with gloves and wear safety glasses. When cleaning out the container containing ethidium bromide solution and throwing away the gel, consult your states disposal guidelines to determine how to deal with used ethidium bromide; additionally, other stains may be utilized instead of ethidium bromide.\n5. Imaging the Agarose Gel\nPlace the gel on top of a blue light transilluminator, which emits maximum light output between 400-500 nm. Take pictures with the camera attached to the station.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure to use the cover for the illuminator and put on protective glasses prior to turning on the light source.\n\tNOTE: This step may also be completed using any UV light source or standard gel scanner.\nView the pictures in ImageJ by dragging the file to the ImageJ status bar and the image will pop up.",
    "Determine the digestion rate for the experiment by comparing the bands on the gel to the expected in silico gel pattern. To determine the digestion rate, the number of experimental bands is divided by the expected number of DNA bands24,25. If the experimental digested DNA band pattern has the expected pattern, the digestion rate is 1. If the pattern has more fragments than expected, the digestion rate is greater than 1. If the pattern has less fragments than expected, the digestion rate is less than one.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
