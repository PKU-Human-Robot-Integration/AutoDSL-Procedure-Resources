    "All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Virginia.\n1. Electrode building/cable building\nUse a unipolar insulated stainless-steel wire (0.005” bare diameter, 0.008” coated) to make an electrode that is connected with a female socket connector (female receptacle connector 0.079).\nUse a special custom-made cable to connect animals to the amplifier.\n\t\nAttach a male 4-pin connector (Male connector 0.079”) to 4 channel unity gain impedance matching operational amplifier (op-amp). Attach a 10K resistor to the wires that connect to the 9 V battery. A ground wire not connected to the op-amp acts as the midpoint of the battery.\nConnect one end of the cable (AWG, 0.012” OD) to the op-amp and connect the other end of the cable to the amplifier.\n2. Electrode implantation surgery\nAnesthetize the pup (postnatal day 9) with 4-5% isoflurane in a downward flow hood. Prior to the start of the procedure, inject the pups with bupivacaine (0.02-0.05 mL, 0.25% subcutaneous local infiltration).\nOnce the animal is immobile, transfer to a stereotactic stage with a nose cone. Use the reverse side of the ear bar as it is soft to hold the head steady. At this age, pups do not have a fully developed ear to use the pointed end of the ear bar.\nTurn down the flow of isoflurane and maintain it at 2.5-3%. Keep an eye on steady breathing of the pup throughout the surgery procedure. Pinch the tail to check pain response and then proceed to incision.\nSterilize the incision area on the skull with betadine and alcohol (3 cycles of alternating iodine and 70% ethanol). Drape the surrounding body part such that the incision region is visible.",
    "Open the scalp anterior-posterior from slightly above the eyes and retract approximately 0.5 cm of skin. Reposition the mouse head on the stereotaxic stage so that the skin pulls outward exposing skull.\nApply hydrogen peroxide on the skull using a cotton swab and scrape the skull clean using a scalpel blade. The skull is very soft; exercise caution while scraping.\nApply one drop (approximately 50 µL) of adhesive and spread it around the exposed skull area using its applicator. Expose to UV light for 40 s to set the adhesive.\nMeasure the coordinates using the exposed bregma as the reference. Implant electrodes bilaterally in the CA1 region of hippocampus [-3.5 mm Dorsal-Ventral (DV), ±2 mm Medial-Lateral (ML), -1.75 mm Deep (D)] and bilaterally in the parietal cortex [-1.22 mm DV, ±0.5 mm ML, -1 mm D] and a reference electrode in the cerebellum17. Use a 32 G needle to create a hole at the marked region.\nClean the blood from the surface of the skull. Lower electrodes attached to the female socket connector into the brain with the help of the stereotaxic arm and fix in place with dental acrylic. Implant the electrode in the brain. The socket connector headset sits on top of the skull glued together by dental acrylic.\nInject ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously in the interscapular region once the electrode is fixed. Place the pups back with the mother.\n\tNOTE: Introduce half of the litter with the headset at once to the mother rather than introducing them one at a time. This will prevent from mother damaging the pup’s headset.\n3. EEG setup and recording (baseline/pre-injury)\nAfter 24 h of recovery after electrode implantation, place each animal in a heated (37 °C) custom-made Plexiglas chamber for EEG recording. This chamber will also serve as a hypoxia chamber.",
    "Connect pups in the chamber to a video-EEG monitoring system via a flexible cable (custom made op-amp cable).\n\tNOTE: With the headset in place, the mice are freely mobile and do not exhibit any differences in behavior. Once attached to the electrode wires, the wires must be adjusted within the chamber tether in order to provide the right amount of slack so that the pup can freely move throughout the chamber.\nDigitize the EEG data at 1000 Hz with 1K gain using a grass amplifier. Review the EEG signal (band pass filter between 3-70 Hz) later using software (e.g., LabChart Pro).\nRecord a pre-injury baseline EEG for 30 minutes prior to disconnecting animals for carotid artery ligation procedure.\n4. Left carotid artery ligation\nAnesthetize the pup (postnatal day 10) with 4-5% isoflurane in a downward flow hood and place them on specially arranged setup on a waterbath pad. Position the animal supine and secure the forelimbs with paper tape.\n\t\nLower the flow of isoflurane to 2-3%. Pinch the tail for pain response and monitor breathing throughout procedure.\nSterilize the incision area (between mandible and the clavicle) on the left side of the neck with betadine and alcohol (3 cycles of alternating iodine and 70% ethanol).\nMake an approximately 1 cm long incision on the left side of the neck using microscissors. Using a dissecting microscope, carefully retract the subcutaneous tissue and skin to expose the carotid artery. Take care to identify the vagus nerve (running lateral to the artery) and delicately separate and retract it from the artery.\nThread a 5 cm long sterile silk suture under the artery using microforceps. Tie a double knotted suture around the artery to occlude flow.",
    "Cut the excess suture and close the exposed artery by pulling back the subcutaneous tissue and skin. Use vet bond to seal the incision.\nPlace the animal back on continuous EEG monitoring in a chamber at room temperature, which is placed on a warming mattress. Take spot infrared temperature checks of pup core temperature to avoid opening the chamber. Allow the animal to recover for 1 h prior to hypoxia.\n5. EEG and hypoxia\nContinuously monitor FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) within the chamber via an oxygen monitor.\nFlush the chamber with 60 L/min of 100% N2 and 0.415 L/min for 100% O2. Once the oxygen saturation in the chamber reaches 12%, decrease the N2 flow to 10 L/min while keeping the O2 flow unchanged. With small adjustments, maintain the FiO2 at 8% for 45 min.\nAfter 45 min of hypoxia exposure, return FiO2 to 21%.\nHave pups recover in chamber and monitor on EEG for 2 h post-hypoxia.\nAfter completion of recording period, disconnect mice from EEG recording and return to the mother.\n6. EEG analysis\nAnalyze the EEG file with video in LabChart Pro. Have a blinded researcher mark the EEG for seizures and background patterns17. Seizures are defined as an electrographic event lasting greater than 10 seconds with high frequency rhythmic sharp wave discharges (≥3x baseline) with clear evolution17.\nHave a second blinded researcher review marked events at random for agreement.\nReview associated video for each marked electrographic event and analyze according to the neonatal rodent behavioral seizure score16. Briefly, this score ranges from 0-6 (immobility to severe tonic-clonic behavior). To further characterize seizure semiology, analyze behavior for laterality (multifocal/bilateral movements vs. focal/unilateral vs. mixed).",
    "Create a power spectrogram. Use a Fast Fourier Transform with a Cosine-Bell data window with a size of 1024 data points. Create a smooth x-axis in the spectrogram with the help of a window overlap of 87.5%. Express the power as µV218.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
