    "The use of animals are approved by the Oberlin College Institutional Animal Care and Use committee and are in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals21.\n1. Preparation for Viral Infusion\nNote: This protocol uses BSL-1 precautions. When employing BSL-2 precautions, a disposable lab coat, gloves, shoe covers, eye protections and a particulate respirator (type N95) are required. All individuals handling BSL-2 compounds must be fit tested for a particulate respirator by a local public health agency. Refer to Lowery & Majewska (2010)22 for additional details on handling and storage of viral vectors.\nUpon first use, aliquot and store unused virus in 20 µl microcentrifuge tubes to avoid repeated freezing and thawing.\nPrepare the work surface by removing any unnecessary objects and sterilizing the surface with 70% ethanol. Prepare a 10% bleach solution for decontaminating AAV waste. Place a beaker full of the bleach solution and a sterile 10 µl syringe onto the work surface. Place the microcentrifuge tube with the AAV in a container with crushed ice during set up.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tube with the virus into a standard bench vice. Load a 10 µl syringe with at least 4 µl of AAV. Take care not to bend the tip of the syringe against the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube during loading. Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the 4 µl of AAV solution in the syringe.\nDispose of the empty virus tube in the beaker containing 10% bleach. Store unused portions of the virus as specified by the supplier.\nAdd additional 10% bleach to the waste container, and allow waste to sit for 30 min before disposing the decontaminated liquid waste.",
    "Dispose of all protective equipment and plastic waste in a biohazard container as instructed by institutional guidelines. Decontaminate any equipment or surfaces that came in contact with the virus using 10% bleach.\n2. Surgery\nPrepare the surgical area by placing absorbent bench paper under the stereotaxic apparatus and on an adjacent space designated as a dedicated virus handling area.\n\t\nPlace a 10% bleach waste container in the dedicated virus handling area near the surgical apparatus.\nInduce a steady level of anesthesia and prepare the rat for surgery.\n\t\nPlace the rat into an induction chamber that contains a mixture of isoflurane gas (range of 1 to 3%) and oxygen (100% at approximately 1 L/min) until there is a loss of consciousness and lack of gross purposeful movement. Maintain isoflurane anesthesia throughout the surgical procedure.\nAfter 6 deep anesthesia is attained, shave the rat from between the eyes to slightly behind the ears. \nPlace the rat back into the induction chamber for an additional 1-3 min.\nEnsure that the isoflurane anesthesia system is connected to the nose cone of the stereotaxic surgery. Open the stopcock on the isoflurane tubing to begin the flow of isoflurane to the stereotax. Maintain the isoflurane and oxygen at the levels specified above.\nPlace the rat in a stereotaxic apparatus by securing the mouth onto the bite bar and securing the ear bars.\nApply eye lubricant to the eyes and betadine to the surgical site prior to incision.\nMake a 2.4 cm midline incision of the skin on the dorsal surface of the skull starting approximately 2 mm caudal to the eyes. Retract the skin to expose the skull. Periodically instill sterile 0.9% sterile saline on the margins of the surgical site to prevent tissues from drying.",
    "Clear membranous tissue from the skull until bregma and lambda are clearly visible.\nEnsure that the skull is level by measuring the dorsal-ventral coordinates at bregma and at lambda. Adjust the stereotaxic device accordingly until dorsal-ventral coordinates at bregma and lambda differ by no more than 0.04 mm.\nAt this time, reduce the isoflurane gas to between 2 and 2.5%.\nReturn the drill to bregma, rezero the coordinates and then move the drill to the desired medial-lateral and anterior-posterior coordinate.\nDrill a hole at the coordinate using a 0.9 mm drill bit as it produces an appropriate size hole for a 28 G infusion syringe.\nSet the infusion pump to deliver virus at a rate of 0.2 µl/min. Place the syringe into the infusion arm of the stereotaxic device and lower the syringe into the desired coordinate. Deliver the desired amount of virus (range 0.1 to 0.8 µl). For example, deliver 0.8 µl of AAV over 4 min.\n\tNote: conduct pilot studies to determine the ideal infusion volume and the typical spread of virus in each region of interest.\n\t\nAfter the delivery of virus is complete leave the syringe in place for 10 min to prevent backflow into the needle tract. Slowly raise the syringe at a rate of about 5 mm/min. Repeat until all coordinates have been infused with AAV.\nClose the wound using surgical staples and coat the wound with topical antibiotic ointment.\nFollow institutional guidelines for post-operative pain management.\nPlace the rat in a cage with bedding, a lid and proper signage and return the rat to the animal facility.\n\t\nIf working under BSL-2 precautions, collect bedding for the amount of time (typically 48-72 hr) specified by institutional guidelines. Place bedding into a biohazard waste container.",
    "Dispose of all AAV-contaminated materials as specified by guidelines for their safe disposal.\n3. Behavioral Apparatus\nNote: The sensory preconditioning apparatus consists of a standard operant conditioning chamber (12” L x 9.5” W x 11.5” H) with a stainless steel grid floor, 2 Plexiglas sidewalls and 2 metal walls.\nMount a 2.8 W light on one of the aluminum walls to serve as the house light and as the visual stimulus when flashed at 2 Hz. Mount a speaker on the chamber to deliver the auditory stimuli (a 10 sec, 1500 Hz, 78 dB pure tone and a 10 sec 78 dB white noise).\n\t\nUse a food hopper to deliver 45 mg food pellets into the food cup. Within the food cup, infrared photocells detect the total time spent in the food cup before, during and after presentations of the stimuli and food rewards.\nHouse the chambers in sound-attenuating cabinets (22” W x 22” H x 16” D) outfitted with exhaust fans (~68 dB).\nUse a PC computer with Med Associates software to control the operant chamber and acquire the data. During the Conditioning sessions, collect data on the total time spent with the head in the food cup during presentation of the light stimulus (5 sec epoch) and during presentation of the food reward (5 sec epoch). During the Test session, collect data on the total time spent in the food cup in response to presentations of the auditory stimuli (10 sec epoch beginning when the auditory stimuli are terminated).\n4. Overview of the Sensory Preconditioning Paradigm\nFollowing recovery from surgery, gradually food restrict the rats to 85% of their free feeding body weight. Consult veterinary staff for an appropriate food restriction paradigm.\n\tNote: The 3-phase sensory preconditioning paradigm is illustrated in Figure 2.",
    "Preconditioning Sessions (Phase 1; Daily 64 min training sessions conducted across 4 consecutive days):\n\t\nPresent rats with 12 intermixed trials that consist of delivery of auditory and visual stimuli. Include inter-trial intervals that average 4.5 min (range 4.0 to 5.0 min) after each auditory presentation.\nOn 6 of the trials, present a tone (preconditioned stimulus) for 10 sec, followed immediately by a 5 sec presentation of the flashing light stimulus.\nOn the other 6 trials, present the white noise (unpaired stimulus) alone for 10 sec.\nConditioning sessions (Phase 2; Daily 64 min training sessions conducted across 5 consecutive days):\n\t\nPresent rats with 8 trials that consist of delivery of the visual stimulus (the flashing light stimulus) for 5 sec followed immediately by delivery of two 45 mg food pellets. Include inter-trial intervals that average 7 min (range 6.0 to 8.0 min) after each trial. Occasionally rats require more than 5 conditioning sessions to learn the light food association.\nTest Session (Phase 3; a single 78 min session):\n\t\nPresent the rats with 12 intermixed trials that consist of delivery of the auditory stimuli alone. Include inter-trial intervals that average 4.5 min (range 4.0 to 5.0 min) after each auditory presentation.\nOn 6 of the trials, present the tone stimulus (the preconditioned stimulus) alone for 10 sec.\nOn the other 6 trials, present the white noise (the unpaired stimulus) alone for 10 sec.\nCounterbalance the stimuli by completing the study with a second set of rats that receive the white noise as the preconditioned stimulus and the tone as the unpaired stimulus.\n5. Pharmacological and Behavioral Procedure",
    "Turn on the power to the behavioral apparatus and load the Med-PC code for the appropriate behavioral session. Wire and program the behavioral apparatus such that the fans that are mounted on the sound attenuating cabinets turn on when the power is switched on.\nTo prepare a 1 mg/ml solution of clozapine N-oxide (CNO), weigh 5.0 mg of CNO into a 15 ml conical tube and add 5 ml of sterile water or 5 ml of sterile 0.9% saline. Vortex until the solution is clear.\n\t\nIf CNO does not dissolve into solution or if more concentrated solutions of CNO are desired add a solubilizing agent, such as DMSO23. Specifically, to prepare a 1 mg/ml solution of CNO with 0.5% DMSO, weigh 5.0 mg of CNO and add 25 µl of DMSO to a 15 ml conical tube. Flick gently ensuring that the contents remain at the base of the tube. When the solution becomes clear, add 5 ml of sterile water or 5 ml of sterile 0.9% saline. Further instructions for preparing solutions of CNO are available on the DREADD wiki resource page25.\nPrepare a new CNO solution each day that it is administered.\nInject the CNO intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg approximately 30 min prior to behavioral testing. For example, inject a 200 g rat with 0.2 ml of the 1 mg/ml CNO solution. The dose and time course of CNO administration were selected based on previously published reports2,12.\n\t\nInject CNO 30 min prior to each preconditioning session (Phase 1; total of 4 days of injections) but administer the vehicle prior to all subsequent behavioral sessions.\nAfter 30 min, place the rats into the behavioral testing chambers and initiate the computer code for the appropriate behavioral session.",
    "Upon completion of the behavioral task, immediately remove the rats from the chambers and return the rats to the animal colony.\n6. Analyses of Behavioral Data\nNote: The dependent variable for all behavioral sessions is the amount of time that the rat’s head is inside the food cup as detected by interruption of the infrared photocells in the food cup. The data (in sec) are collected and recorded by the computer software.\nDo not conduct analyses on data generated during the Preconditioning phase.\nFor the conditioning sessions: analyze each rats’ ability to learn the light food association by comparing food cup behavior during presentation of the visual stimulus across the 5 behavioral sessions. Specifically, calculate the average time spent in the food cup during the 5 sec light epoch for each of 8 trials/session (i.e., an average of 8 trials that are each 5 sec in duration/rat). Compare average control and experimental values for each of 5 daily sessions (see Figure 3A).\n\t\nAnalyze the rats’ motivation to obtain food reward by comparing food cup behavior during delivery of the food reward (5 sec epoch) across the 5 behavioral sessions using the same calculation as specified for the 5 sec light epoch above. These values will be consistently higher than those acquired during presentation of the visual stimulus (see Figure 3B).\nFor the test session: calculate a discrimination ratio that describes the rats’ food cup behavior in response to presentations of each auditory stimulus.",
    "Specifically, for each rat, divide the average time spent in the food cup following each of 6 presentations of the sensory preconditioned stimulus (i.e., the tone) by the sum of the average time spent in the food cup following each of 6 presentations of the sensory preconditioned stimulus (i.e., the tone stimulus) plus the average of the total time spent in the food cup following each of 6 presentations of the unpaired stimulus (i.e., the white noise stimulus). Each epoch is 10 sec in duration.\n\t\tNote: A discrimination score of 0.5 or greater demonstrates that rats learned the associations inherent in the sensory preconditioning paradigm.\n7. Verification of AAV Placement and Expression\nAnesthetize and perfuse the rats transcardially using 4% paraformaldehyde. Due to the use of fluorescent labels, do not exceed a post-fixation time of 2 hr to minimize loss of antigenicity and to preserve the fluorescent signal.\nDehydrate perfused brains by transferring them into a brain jar containing 30 ml of a 20% sucrose solution in phosphate buffered saline (1x) for a minimum of 2 days or until the brain sinks to the bottom of the brain jar.\nUse a freezing sliding microtome to make coronal brain sections (20-40 µm) throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the region of interest.\nConduct immunohistochemistry directed against the tagged receptor or the reporter protein to ascertain the location and expression of the designer receptor and/or reporter12. An immunohistochemistry staining protocol is provided on the DREADD wiki resource page25.\nMount the sections onto superfrost-plus slides and coverslip using 100-200 µl of an aqueous mounting medium.\nPerform fluorescence microscopy on brain tissue to verify AAV placement and protein expression12,24.\nSubscription Required.
