    "Immobilization of PD-1: Amine Coupling Method Set immobilization method on the SPR instrument.Note: All steps should follow the instrument’s manual. Set temperature to 25 °C.Set chip type as CM5.Set flow cells per cycle as 1.Under flow cell 1, check immobilize flow cell 1.i. Set amine as the method.ii. Set blank immobilization.Under flow cell 2, check immobilize flow cell 2.i. Set amine as the method.ii. Set ligand as 40 μg/mL PD-1.iii. Set aim for immobilization method with desired target level and the wash solution as 50 mM NaOH.Set tubes R2 B1 as 40 μg/mL PD-1.Set tubes R2 B2 as 50 mM NaOH.Set tubes R2 B3 and R2 C3 as Ethanolamine.Set tubes R2 B4 and R2 C4 as Empty.Set tubes R2 B5 and R2 C5 as NHS.Set tubes R2 B6 and R2 C6 as EDC.Prepare 200 mL of HBS-EP+ running buffer solution (see Recipes).Prepare Amine Coupling kit reagents and PD-1 protein in a reagent rack.Prepare a stock solution of PD-1 at 500 μg/mL in DNase-free water (see Recipes).i. Set at room temperature for 30 min to fully dissolve.ii. Dilute PD-1 solution to 40 μg/mL in acetate 5.0 and add 160 μL to tube R2 B1.Add 70 μL of 50 mM NaOH to tube R2 B2.Add 140 μL of ethanolamine to tubes R2 B3 and R2 C3.R2 B4 and R2 C4 remain empty.Add 100 μL of NHS to tube R2 B5 and R2 C5 (NHS is included in the Amine Coupling kit).Add 100 μL of EDC to tubes R2 B6 and R2 C6 (EDC is included in the Amine Coupling kit).Place Tube A into the HBS-EP+ running buffer solution.Eject the maintenance sensor chip and insert the CM5 chip.Reopen the immobilization method, eject the rack, and insert reagent rack 2.Run method for the estimated run time.",
    "The following method will be performed:Inject ligand solution for five pre-concentrations.Establish a baseline with an injection of the HBS-EP+ running buffer solution.Mix inject a 50:50 ratio of EDC + NHS with a contact time of 420 s and a flow rate of 10 μL/min to activate the chip surface with the modification of carboxymethyl groups to N-hydroxysuccinimide esters.Continue baseline with an injection of the HBS-EP+ running buffer solution after chip modification. The baseline activation will observe a slight response unit (RU) effect.Inject 40 μg/mL of PD-1 ligand to induce an electrostatic interaction that will couple the ligand to the chip surface. The ligand includes both immobilized and non-covalently bound proteins. At this stage, the PD-1 solution remains in contact with the CM5 sensor surface, resulting in a response that includes both immobilized and non-covalently bound PD-1. The N-hydroxysuccinimide esters present on the sensor chip surface react spontaneously with the primary amines on PD-1 to form stable and covalent links.Immobilize the ligand prior to deactivation. This indicates that the ligand has surpassed the protein surface and the majority of the non-covalently bound ligand has been removed.Deactivate remaining NHS-esters and remove unreacted esters through the injection of ethanolamine with NaOH utilizing a contact time of 420 s and a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The unreacted NHS-esters were deactivated using 35 μL of 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride, which was adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH. Additionally, the deactivation process ensures the removal of any remaining electrostatically bound PD-1.Notes:  i. A slight increase in RU is observed due to the change in the bulk refractive index. ii. Stopping point if desired. Eject chip, gently wash chip surface with two drops of DI water, briefly let dry, and place at 4 °C. Replace running buffer with Milli-Q water for standby.",
    "The reproducibility of this immobilization protocol has been confirmed through multiple experiments conducted in our research group. It is important to note that when dissolving PD-L1 recombinant proteins (in lyophilized solid form), a minimum of 30 min of equilibrium time at room temperature is necessary to ensure full dissolution of the protein.

    "Proceed with the same procedure as BMS-1166/BMS-202 to run NO-Losartan A.Note: In this protocol, NO-Losartan A was employed as a negative control due to the presence of a biphenyl group, which is a structural feature shared by the BMS-1166 and BMS-202 compounds tested. To ascertain the suitability of NO-Losartan A as a negative control, we conducted a preliminary investigation of its binding affinity with PD-L1. Our findings indicated that NO-Losartan A displayed negligible binding affinity towards PD-L1, confirming its suitability as a negative control in this protocol. For screening purposes, the selection of a negative control may depend on the specific composition of the compound library employed. It is essential to ensure that the chosen negative control exhibits no binding affinity towards the PD-L1."
