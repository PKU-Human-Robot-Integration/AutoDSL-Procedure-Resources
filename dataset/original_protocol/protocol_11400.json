    "All experiments on mice were performed according to the guidelines of our institute (the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NCKU Medical College).\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Media, and Dishes\nBefore starting the experimental protocols, obtain sterile surgical sutures, 1 mL syringes with 26G/0.5 cm needle (for tail vein injection), 3 mL syringes with 24G/3 cm needle (for lung perfusion), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), trypsin-EDTA solution (5 g/L trypsin and 0.53 mM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1x PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2PHO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4), and 6 cm culture dishes.\n2. Preparation and Recovery of Tumor Cells in Suspension\nPrepare sterile Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) containing 10% or 20% FBS and freshly add 2 mM L-glutamine, 1x PBS, and 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nCulture the cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C and grow them until there is 70-80% confluence in the culture dish.\nRemove the culture media (DMEM) from the dishes, followed by two washes with 2 mL of sterile 1x PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA into the dishes to thoroughly cover all the cells. Immediately remove 800 μL of solution and leave only 200 μL in the dishes. Incubate the dishes at 37 °C for 30 s to 1 min (depending on cell type) and wait until the majority of cells are in the suspended state.\nAdd 1 mL of fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS directly into the dishes to stop the enzymatic activity of trypsin and vigorously pipette the cell suspension up and down with a 1000 µL pipette to prepare a single cell suspension.\nTransfer the cells from the dish to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and spin down the cells at room temperature at 162 x g for 3 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the tumor cells in 1.5 mL DMEM containing 20% FBS and end-over-end rotate the cells in suspension at 37 °C for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: If the medium turns yellow during the recovery, exchange the old medium with fresh medium containing 20% FBS.\n3. Fluorescence Staining and Analysis of Tumor Cells in Suspension With Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE)\nAfter cell recovery in suspension, count the appropriate viable cell numbers with Trypan Blue in a Neubauer counting chamber for titrating the fluorescence staining doses and for tail vein injection.\nSpin down the cells at 162 x g at room temperature for 3 min and resuspend the pelleted cells in 1 mL of sterilized 1x PBS, followed by room temperature centrifugation at 162 x g for 3 min.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in 500 µL of 1X PBS containing 10% FBS and 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 µM CFSE for dose titration, and incubate the cell suspension at 37 oC for 10 min in the dark.\nSpin down the cells at 162 x g at room temperature for 3 min and resuspend the pelleted cells with 4 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS. Repeat this washing step three more times. Resuspend the pelleted cells with 4 mL of DMEM alone for the final wash.\nSubject the CFSE-labeled cells to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to quantify the fluorescence intensity of a single cell, or tail vein injection.\n\tNOTE: Keep the cells on ice prior to performing the FACS analysis or tail vein injections.\n4. Lung Colonization Assay\nPrepare the cells labeled with 20 µM CFSE (refer to Steps 3.1 through 3.4).\n\tNOTE: Decide the working dose of CFSE for labelling tumor cells, based on the titration results from the FACS analysis (refer to Step 3.3).",
    "Warm up the tails of 4-6 week-old male C57BL/6 mice (6 mice) with a halide lamp for 5-10 min on a mouse-by-mouse basis to dilate mouse tail veins.\nThoroughly mix and aspirate CFSE-labeled tumor cells with a 1 mL (26Gx1/2) syringe, avoiding any bubbles in the cell suspension (with a final cell density of 5 x 106 cells/mL).\nCarefully inject 1 x106 CFSE-labeled tumor cells in 200 µL of DMEM into the mouse tail vein, which should be lodged in a mouse restrainer.\n\tNOTE: During the injection, if the needle is directly placed in the lumen of the tail vein, tumor cells should be easily delivered into the circulation without needing to push hard on the syringe. If it is hard to push the tumor cells through, they have most likely been injected outside of the tail vein, into the subcutaneous space.\nDivide the mice that intravenously received the CFSE-labeled tumor cells into two groups: one group will undergo lung perfusion followed by confocal microscopy and ImageJ quantification in the lung colonization assay and the other one will be left alone for 4-5 weeks in the long term lung colonization assay.\nAt 20, 38, or 45 h and with 1x 106 tumor cells intravenously injected during a time course- and dose-dependent titration, anesthetize tumor-bearing mice with 50-75 mg/kg zoletil 50, which is a well-accepted and proper anesthetizer23.\n\tNOTE: Use vet ointment on the mice's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nLongitudinally cut the skin and subcutaneous tissues from the abdomen to the chest region with surgical scissors. Open the pleural cavity with surgical scissors and forceps to fully expose the heart and lungs.\n\tNOTE: Be careful to avoid cutting off blood vessels.",
    "Tie the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) with sterile surgical sutures to prevent the backflow of perfusion solution during lung perfusion.\nCut the left ventricle wall with surgical scissors to open a fissure (about 2-4 mm) to drain the perfusion solution from the lungs.\nInject 1x PBS into the right ventricle with a 3 mL syringe and remove the drained solution with constant suction during lung perfusion until the lungs turn from a reddish color to completely pale.\n5. Confocal Microscopic Imaging and Analysis of Lung-Colonized Tumor Cells\nRemove the now-pale lungs from the pleural cavity and separate the five lobes by cutting away the trachea and connective tissue ligaments with surgical scissor and forceps24.\nPrepare a stretcher-like lung holder as shown in Figure 3B by winding a nylon suture around two metal rods to produce a reticulate texture with a space between the two rods for the placement of lung lobes. Set the lung holder in a 6 cm dish.\n\tNOTE: The lung holder will be used to stabilize the lung lobes underneath the objective lens of a confocal microscope.\nLodge and fix the lung lobes on the reticulate texture of the lung holder. Cover and moisten the lung lobes with 1x PBS.\nSubject the 6-cm culture dish harboring the lung lobes on the lung holder to confocal microscopy to capture fluorescence images recording the lung-colonizing tumor cells.\nFor imaging, use objective lenses (5X, MPLN, NA: 0.1, WD: 20, Air).\nRotate the filter wheel to NIBA (excitation/emission; 470-495 nm/510-550 nm) and use a 488 nm laser to excite CFSE, to clearly visualize images of fluorescence dots in the lung lobes.",
    "Rotate the filter wheel to R690 (for MaiTai HP DeepSee laser) to scan with 2.0 µs/pixel scanning speed and optimize the HV, Gain, and offset levels.\nCapture fluorescence images (512 x 512 pixels) by using the microscope software with a 10 µs/pixel scanning speed.\nQuantify and statistically analyze the microscopic images using ImageJ and GraphPad software as previously described21.\n6. Long term lung colonization assays\nNOTE: Repeat steps 4.1 through 4.5.\nSacrifice the mice after tumor cell inoculation for 4-5 weeks and fix their lungs with Bouin's Fluid25 for 1 to 2 days.\nQuantify and statistically analyze the tumor nodules from the mice lungs with software21.\nSubscription Required.
