    "Plant growthGerminate transgenic mGFP5 Nicotiana benthamiana seeds (see Note 1) and grow seeds in SunGro Sunshine LC1 Grower soil mix in a growth chamber for four to six weeks before experiments. Use 12-h light at 24 °C and 12-h dark at 18 °C cycle for growing plants.Note: Different plant species may require different germination and growth conditions. siRNA design and generationCurrently, there are many software to design gene specific siRNA sequences with minimal off-target effects. A recently developed software called “siRNA-Finder (si-Fi) Software” can be used in plants (Lück et al., 2019).After the design of siRNA sequences, sense and antisense RNA strands can be purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) as single-stranded oligonucleotides.RNA-SWNT preparationDissolve sense and antisense siRNA strands in 0.1 M NaCl at a concentration of 100 mg/ml.Add 1 mg dry HiPCO SWNTs to 20 μl of dissolved sense RNA, and complete the solution volume to 1 ml with 0.1 M NaCl (see Note 2).Bath sonicate the mixture for 10 min at room temperature in Ultrasonic bath (Branson).Probe-tip sonicate the mixture with a 3-mm tip at 50% amplitude (~7W) for 30 min in an ice bath. Renew ice bath if it starts melting during the sonication to prevent heating.Rest the solution at room temperature for 30 min.Centrifuge the solution at 16,100 x g for 1 h in room temperature to remove bundled SWNTs. The supernatant contains the individually suspended sense-RNA-SWNTs. Keep the supernatant and discard the SWNT pellet to the hazardous nanomaterials waste.Repeat the same protocol for the antisense RNA strand (see Note 3). Store RNA-SWNT solutions at 4 °C.Removal of unbound siRNAAdd 500 μl sense-RNA-SWNT and 500 μl antisense-RNA-SWNT into two separate 100K Amicon spin filters that are placed in 2 ml collection tubes. Centrifuge 4 min at 8,000 x g in room temperature.",
    "Collect the flow-throughs from sense-RNA-SWNT and antisense-RNA-SWNT in separate tubes and place the spin filters into the same collection tubes.Add 0.1 M NaCl into the spin filters until the volume reaches 500 μl. Repeat the wash step.Perform a total of 8 washes to remove all unbound RNA molecules. Merge and accumulate all flow-through solutions (separately for sense-RNA-SWNT and antisense-RNA-SWNT) for later measurement of removed RNA amount.Calculate the SWNT concentration by measuring the carbon nanotube absorbance at 632 nm using a spectrophotometer (use 2 μl for NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer or dilute to 1 ml for Thermo Scientific). Divide the absorbance value by SWNT extinction coefficient of 0.036 to obtain SWNT concentration in the unit of μg/ml (If the sample is diluted, multiply the absorbance value also by the dilution factor).Calculate the concentration of RNA loaded on SWNTs by measuring the absorbance of collected flow-through solutions at 260 nm (use 2 μl for NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer), and subtracting the total amount of RNA removed from the total amount of RNA added (2 mg in this case).(Optional) For additional characterization, record sense-RNA-SWNT and antisense-RNA-SWNT absorbance spectra with Shimadzu  UV-3600 Plus  , and fluorescence spectra with a near-infrared spectrometer (Princeton Instruments IsoPlane 320 coupled to a liquid nitrogen-cooled Princeton Instruments PyLoN-IR 1D array of InGaAs pixels). See Demirer et al., 2020 for representative examples of SWNT absorbance and fluorescence spectra.Infiltration of leaves with RNA-SWNTsSelect healthy and fully-developed leaves from mGFP5 Nicotiana benthamiana (4-6 weeks old) plants for experiments.Merge 100 μl of 200 nM sense-RNA-SWNTs with 100 μl of 200 nM antisense-RNA-SWNTs in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (see Note 4). Mix well.",
    "Immediately after mixing, make a small puncture on the abaxial (bottom) surface of the leaf with a pipette tip, and infiltrate ~100-200 μl of the siRNA-SWNT mixture from the hole with a 1 ml needleless syringe with caution not to damage the leaf (see Note 5).Use a Kimwipe tissue to remove the excess siRNA-SWNT solution on the leaf surface. Mark the infiltrated area with a Sharpie pen without damaging the leaf.Infiltrate a negative control solution, such as the free siRNA without SWNTs or scrambled RNA suspended SWNTs that does not target the gene of interest. If possible, also infiltrate a positive control solution, such as viral siRNA delivery sample (see Note 6).Return the infiltrated plant(s) into the growth chamber until the measurement of gene silencing.Gene silencing determination through quantitative PCR (qPCR)24-h after infiltration, cut the infiltrated leaf areas (maximum of 100 mg leaf tissue per sample) and extract total RNA with a RNeasy plant mini kit. After cutting the leaf, immediately proceed with the first step of the RNA extraction protocol (i.e., grinding the tissue in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle) to make sure gene expression levels do not change after cutting. Follow the protocol of the RNeasy plant mini kit (see Note 7).Following RNA extraction, measure the RNA concentration and purity with a spectrophotometer. Reverse transcribe 1 μg total RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit. Follow the protocol of the iScript cDNA synthesis kit.Use PowerUp SYBR green master mix for the qPCR step with 2 μl cDNA from Step 2 and specific primers for the target and housekeeping genes. Follow the protocol of the PowerUp SYBR green kit for relative quantification of target mRNA in the siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaf compared to negative controls of free siRNA without SWNTs or scrambled RNA-SWNTs.",
    "Example: The target gene in our qPCR was mGFP5 (GFP transgene inserted into Nb), and EF1 (elongation factor 1) as our housekeeping (reference) gene.Analyze the qPCR data using the ddCt method (Rao et al., 2013). See Figure 2B for representative qPCR results.Gene silencing determination through confocal fluorescence microscopy imagingIf silencing a fluorescent protein, such as GFP, confocal fluorescence microscopy can be used to detect approximate silencing efficiency.After infiltration, leave the plants with intact infiltrated leaves in the growth chamber for 72 h.72-h after infiltration, cut a small flat piece (0.5-1 cm x 0.5-1 cm) of the infiltrated leaf around the infiltration point and prepare a glass slide with cover slip (thickness #1). Add 50-100 μl water in between the glass slide and cover slip for imaging. Image samples before the leaf piece dries out (optimally within 15 to 30 min).Image the plant tissue with 488 nm laser excitation with a GFP filter cube (in the case of GFP silencing), and also capture brightfield with a transmitted light if available (see Note 8).Capture at least 10 to 15 fields of view with same optical settings per sample, including non-treated leaf, and any negative and positive control samples.For each sample, compare the mean fluorescence intensity value with the mean GFP fluorescence intensity of a non-treated leaf, which can be used to determine silencing efficiency of siRNA-SWNTs. Pay attention to use the same imaging parameters and quantification analyses for samples imaged on different days. See Figure 2A for representative confocal imaging results.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3897/bioprotoc-11-01-3897-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative gene silencing results. A.

    "Gene silencing determination through Western blotting72-h after infiltration, harvest infiltrated leaves and grind them in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle to recover dry frozen leaf powders.Transfer the frozen leaf powder into a tube with 400 μl pre-chilled lysis buffer (see Recipes).Lyse tissue on ice for 1 h. Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min. Following centrifugation, gently transfer the supernatants containing whole proteins to a new clean tube. Quantify total extracted proteins with a Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay.Mix the samples with the appropriate loading buffer for gel electrophoresis, and boil the mixture at 95-100 °C for 5 min either using a heat block or thermal cycler. Load 0.5 µg of normalized total proteins from each sample and analyze with SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad precast tris/glycine gel, 4-20% gradient). Run the gel at 120 V for 60 min.Transfer the gel to a PVDF membrane in cold transfer buffer (see Recipes) and run at 400 mA in 1x transfer buffer with methanol for no more than 60 min in a cold room with an ice block.Block the membrane for 1 h using 7.5% BSA in 1x TBST buffer (see Recipes) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary GFP antibody. After extensive washing, probe the corresponding protein bands with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 30 min. After washing, develop the bands by incubation with chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL prime kit) in less than 2 min and image with a ChemiDoc XRS+ System.Quantify the intensity of GFP bands with ImageJ software."
