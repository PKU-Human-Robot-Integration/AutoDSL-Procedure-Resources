    "1. Microfabrication of the Microfluidic Chip\nPrepare Electrochemical Chip\n\t\nPattern Gold Electrodes\n\t\t\nRinse a blank 4’’ silicon wafer (prime grade quality) with acetone, methanol, and isopropanol (“AMI” clean). Rinse the isopropanol from the wafer with deionized water (DI) followed by drying with N2 gun.\nGrow a 1 µm thick SiO2 passivation layer with plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) tool. Deposit a 200 Å thick layer of chromium followed by a 2,000 Å thick layer of gold with a DC sputtering tool.\nSpin “PR1” positive photoresist (spinning parameters: 3,000 rpm, 1,000 rpm/sec, 30 sec) to create uniform film ~1.6 µm thick. Pre-bake the wafer for 1 min at 100 °C on a hot plate.\nExpose the wafer with 190 mJ/cm2 at 405 nm wavelength through a photomask. Develop the wafer for 30 sec in 352 developer and rinse the wafer with DI and dry with N2 gun.\nEtch the gold with gold etchant for 1.5 min. Etch the chromium with chromium etchant for ~30 sec. Rinse the wafer with DI and dry with N2 gun.\nStrip the photoresist with “AMI” clean procedure.\n\t\t\tNOTE: STRONG OXIDIZER AND POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE.\nClean the wafer with 4:1 H2SO4:H2O2 mixture (“Piranha” clean) for 1 min. Rinse the wafer with DI and dry with N2 gun.\nPattern Platinum Electrodes\n\t\t\nSpin “PR2” positive photoresist (spinning parameters: 3,000 rpm, 1,000 rpm/sec, 30 sec) to create uniform film ~1.4 µm thick. Pre-bake the wafer for 1 min at 100 °C on a hot plate.",
    "Expose the wafer with 30 mJ/cm2 at 405 nm wavelength through a photomask. Bake the wafer for 45 sec at 125 °C on a hot plate. Flood expose the wafer with 1,000 mJ/cm2 at 405 nm wavelength without a photomask. Develop the wafer for 2 min in 6:1 AZ400K developer and rinse the wafer with DI and dry with N2 gun.\nDeposit a 400 Å thick layer of titanium followed by a 1,600 Å thick layer of platinum using an E-beam evaporation system.\nLift off photoresist in an ultrasonicated acetone bath for 5 min followed by rinse with acetone and isopropanol. Rinse the wafer with DI and dry with N2 gun.\nPrepare Assay Channels\n\t\nPrepare Mold for Assay Channels\n\t\t\nRinse a blank 4’’ silicon wafer (test grade quality) with “AMI” clean procedure. Rinse the isopropanol from the wafer with DI followed by drying with N2 gun.\nSpin “PR3” negative photoresist (2-step spinning parameters: step one - 600 rpm, 120 rpm/sec, 10 sec. Step two – 1,150 rpm, 383 rpm/sec, 27 sec) to create uniform film ~100 µm thick. Pre-bake the wafer on a hot plate (2-step baking parameters: step one – ramp up from room temperature to 65 °C at 300 °C/hr and hold temperature for 10 min. Step 2 – ramp up to 95 °C at 300 °C/hr and hold temperature for 30 min).\nExpose the wafer with 2,500 mJ/cm2 at 405 nm wavelength through a photomask. Post-bake the wafer by ramping up to 95 °C at 300 °C/hr and hold temperature for 10 min on a hot plate. Develop the wafer for 10 min in Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PGMEA) developer. Rinse the wafer with isopropanol and dry with N2 gun.\nFabricate Assay Channels",
    "Prepare 10:1 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture (20 g of elastomer, 2 g of curing agent) and completely degas in a vacuum chamber for 20 min.\nDefine an enclosure around the mold wafer with aluminum foil and slowly pour the uncured PDMS over the mold.\nBake the mold with the PDMS in a box furnace (2-step baking parameters: step one – 5 min ramp up from room temperature to 80 °C. Step 2 – hold at 80 °C for 17 min).\nPeel away the PDMS from the mold and place on aluminum foil. Cut the assay chips with a surgeon knife, define holes with a biopsy punching tool.\n2. Assemble the Device\nManually align the PDMS assay channels with the working electrodes on the electrochemical chip. PDMS sticks well to the electrochemical chip, sealing the channels and preventing leakage.\nConnect a flexible tubing (OD 0.087’’ and ID 0.015’’) to a plastic elbow or straight connector using a short flexible tube as an adapter (OD 0.1875’’ and ID 0.0625’’). Attach connectors to each of the hole-punched inlets in the device.\nConnect a syringe on the other end of the tubing and place the syringe in a syringe pump. Alternately change the set of a syringe, a tube, and a connector according to the required procedure step in section 3 and its corresponding solution.\n3. Analyze DNA Hybridization\nNOTE: Introduce each solution slowly into the channel at a flow rate of 200 µl/hr until the whole channel is filled.\nFunctionalize each vertical microchannel with a different ssDNA probe sequence (perform in parallel to the 3 separate vertical microchannels):",
    "Fill each microchannel with a different ssDNA probe incubation solution (10 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, 10 µM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 1 µM probe ssDNA), and incubate for 1 hr followed by rinsing the microchannel with PBS.\nFill the microchannel with a solution containing 1 mM of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) in a buffer of 10 mM PBS, 100 mM NaCl and 1.395 mM TCEP, and incubate for 1 hr followed by rinsing the microchannel with PBS.\nLift off the PDMS, rotate 90° to a horizontal orientation, and place down to expose separate rows of reaction chambers with each row containing a unique counter and reference electrode (Figure S1).\nFill the microchannels with control measurement solution of 4x concentrated saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, and incubate for 20 min.\nBackground measurement: Fill the microchannels with 5 mM ferricyanide / 5 mM ferrocyanide in PBS solution and record the impedance values of the electrochemical system for different frequencies (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; EIS) using a potentiostat connected to the working, counter, and reference electrodes (EIS parameters: frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz, 10 frequency data points per decade, 25 mV amplitude, 5 mV polarization versus the reference electrode). Repeat this measurement for each working electrode in the microchannels.\nMeasure DNA hybridization (perform for each non-complementary and complementary ssDNA target).\n\t\nFill the microchannels with target ssDNA measurement solution of 4x concentrated SSC buffer containing 1 µM of the target ssDNA, and incubate for 20 min. Measure the DNA according to step 3.4.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
