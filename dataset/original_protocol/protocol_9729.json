    "1. Day 1: Preparation of the 24 well plate\nBegin the procedure by adding 20 mL of the cell culture medium into a 50 mL conical tube. In this experiment, F12 Ham's based medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used.\nObtain a 24 well plate designed to assay cell contractility. Set the pipette to 500 µL and obtain a cell strainer for cell passaging.\n\tNOTE: The plate is available from the authors upon request.\nLift and hold the plate in one hand and proceed to gently peel the plastic film from the top of the plate. Then carefully set the plate back down.\nTurn on a vacuum aspirator and aspirate the top layer of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from the wells to prevent spilling. Remove the PBS one row at a time. Once the wells are no longer completely full, hold the plate in one hand and carefully remove the rest of the PBS from the wells. Quickly fill with 500 µL of cell culture medium. Take care to avoid contact between the aspirator and the bottom of the well.\nShake the plate gently and tap on the side to ensure the entire bottom of the well is covered with solution. Once all wells are filled with medium, set the plate to the side.\n2. Day 1: Cell seeding\nRetrieve the culture flask with passage 7 or lower primary human bladder smooth muscle (BSM) cells from the 37 °C incubator. Under a microscope, check cell morphology and ensure cells have grown to at least 90% confluency but less than 100% confluency.\nConduct the cell dissociation protocol. Within a sterile biosafety cabinet, trypsinize the cells for 2.5 min until cells are detached before quenching them with serum-supplemented medium (10% FBS).",
    "Once cells are dissociated, use a hemocytometer to count the cells and dilute the cell suspension to approximately 50,000 cells/mL in serum-supplemented medium. Importantly, cells require at least 2% serum to attach to the micropatterns.\nPrior to seeding, rapidly strain the cell suspension through a 40 or 100 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube with a serological pipette to break up clumps of cells into single cells.\nCarefully add 500 µL of the 50,000 cells/mL cell suspension into each of the 24 wells on the plate using a P1000 pipette by dispensing the solution dropwise across different positions in the wells.\nAfter cell seeding, let the plate sit at room temperature for 1 h to let the cells settle directly onto the micropatterns without becoming influenced by microcurrents generated by evaporation. After 1 h, place the plate into a 37 °C incubator overnight. The cells will self-assemble and spread over the adhesive micropatterns during this time and begin exerting basal contraction levels.\n3. Day 2: Addition of test drug\nNOTE: The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the wells containing adhered cells cannot exceed 1% and drug/DMSO cannot be added directly to the cells but should first be diluted and mixed into an intermediate solution of cell medium.\nCreate a six-step, eight-fold drug dilution series by transferring 30 µL of the stock drug into consecutive 210 µL volumes of DMSO and thoroughly mixing between each transfer step. In this work, a six-step, eight-fold dilution series of blebbistatin is prepared in doses ranging from 40 µM to 1 nM, in DMSO.\nFor each stock drug solution (from Step 3.1), mix 30 µL of drug into 470 µL of cell culture medium. The intermediate solution yields a 16.7-fold dilution of DMSO.",
    "Transfer 200 µL of each intermediate solution to the appropriate well on the 24 well plate (which already contains 100 µL of medium in each well). This yields an additional six-fold dilution of DMSO.\nSteps 3.2 and 3.3 collectively yield a 1% final concentration of DMSO in the wells.\nPlace the treated plate into a 37 °C incubator for the appropriate duration. For this experiment, a 30 min incubation is used.\nImmediately prior to imaging, add Hoechst 33342 live nuclear stain solution to each well (1:10,000 final dilution). Allow it to incubate for an additional 15 min to label the cell nuclei.\n4. Day 2: Imaging the well-plate\nAccess a microscope that is equipped to image the channels for both the cell nuclei (DAPI) and the micropatterns (TRITC).\nFirst image the cells with DMSO only.\nThen focus on and image both the micropatterns and the labeled cell nuclei in order to identify single cells and ensure both channels are perfectly aligned to enable automated image analysis.\nRepeat at multiple positions in each of the 24 wells on the plate. Images may be taken with 4x objective (or optionally higher to expedite imaging and acquire maximal data points per image).\nExport the images as TIF files and open them on a web-connected computer with ImageJ to analyze the data.\n5. Post-experiment: Image analysis\nNOTE: Image analysis was performed using Biodock.ai portal and imaging software.\nUpload the acquired images to a computer.\n\t\nEnsure that corresponding pairs of micropattern and nuclear images are named properly.\nEnsure that micropattern image names all take the form \"sharedCoreName_pt.tif\".\nEnsure that nuclei image names all take the form \"sharedCoreName_dapi.tif\".\nConvert images from TIF to PNG using ImageJ.",
    "Once ImageJ is opened, load in one channel at a time. For this experiment, first load micropattern images as a stack into ImageJ.\nUsing Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast, adjust the image brightness to emphasize the micropatterns and reduce the background to black. In addition to this, smooth out the images.\nUsing Image > Type > 8-bit, convert the images to 8-bit.\nThen export the image to PNG type and check the box slice level as file name. Now create a new folder PNGs and save the PNG files there with the same name.\nRepeat this process for nuclei images.\nUpload PNG image pairs into the image processing software for the analysis.\n\t\nCreate and validate the account. The authors have an account to enable open access to academic users.\nValidate the account by contacting the authors.\nLog into the software.\nUnder the Data tab on the left, click Upload Batch.\nImport the images by dragging and dropping image pairs into the window that pops up and name the batch. Click OK.\nCheck the box next to the batch name and click Analyze.\nOn the next screen, scroll down and check the box next to Contractility Analysis and click Select. Lower down the page, select 10x as the magnification that was used for imaging from a drop-down menu.\n\t\t\nClick Submit. Once the data analysis reads Completed, click on the batch name. On the next screen, click Download Data on the right side of the page.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The downloaded files will contain images that were analyzed, summary results reporting average contraction in each image, and a detailed analysis of every micropattern that was detected in any image, reporting their sizes, positions, number of cells adhered, and contraction.",
