    "This study was conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Animals and approved by the Committee for Animal Research of Kyoto University (Kyoto, Japan; authorization number: R-16-16). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, and all sections of this report adhere to the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of in Vivo Experiments) guidelines.\n1. Fabrication of the PGA-C tube\nTo fabricate the artificial nerve conduit by means of an absorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) tube, use a tubular braiding machine equipped with 48 spindles and five PGA fibers, comprised of bundles of 26 filaments (Figure 1)18.\nTo render the PGA tube surface hydrophilic, expose it to plasma discharge.\nUse 1% v/w atelocollagen in hydrochloride solution7.\n\tNOTE: Atelocollagen is extracted from porcine skin via enzyme treatment and subjected to a virus check. It mainly consists of type I (70–80%) and type III collagen, the ratio of which is described in detail elsewhere7. Prepare the collagen solution by dissolving 1 g collagen in 100 mL hydrochloride solution (pH = 3.0). Since the density of the hydrochloride solution is approximately 1.0, the w/w collagen concentration is almost 1%.\nCoat the tube with the collagen layers by repeatedly dipping it into the 1% collagen hydrochloride solution for 5 s each time.\n\t\nAfter dipping, dry the tube on a clean bench at room temperature. Perform next dipping after ensuring the tube is completely dry (about 6 h for air-drying).\nRepeat the coating process 10 times.\nSubject the PGA-C tube to 140 °C for 24 h under vacuum (dehydrothermal treatment), in order to control bio-absorption and crosslinking of the collagen molecules. Perform the entire process under aseptic conditions.\n\tNOTE: This procedure generates a tube of 14-mm final length, 3-mm inner diameter, and 50-μm wall thickness.\n2. Surgical Procedure Set-up",
    "Use adult male beagles weighing 9.0 to 13.0 kg.\n\t\nHouse animals in separate cages, under controlled kennel conditions (12-h light and dark cycle).\nProvide solid food and water ad libitum.\nWeigh the beagles.\nAutoclave all surgical instruments.\nDon sterilized gloves and disinfect all surfaces of the operating setting with an 80% ethanol solution. Discard the used gloves.\nPerform surgical handwashing.\nPut on a fresh mask, gown, and sterile gloves.\n3. Anesthesia and Skin Preparation\nAnesthetize the dog with a mixture of 5 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 1 mg/kg xylazine by an intramuscular injection.\nIntubate by a tracheal tube of 7.5 mm diameter and 25 cm length.\nPlace the dog on the right lateral position. Maintain general anesthesia with 3.2% sevoflurane with oxygen (1.0 L/min).\nUse a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37 °C.\nApply an ophthalmic gel over the anterior surface of the eyes to avoid corneal abrasion.\nCarefully shave the surgical field (left side chest area) using surgical clippers. Spray a substantial amount of alcoholic solution over the operative site. Wait at least 15 sec. Repeat the application 3 times.\nRecord the heart rate and oxygen saturation during surgery.\n4. Inferior Alveolar Nerve Reconstruction Using PGA-C tube: Development of the Reconstruction-only Model\nInject 3 mL of 1% lidocaine using a 27 G needle to the left mandibular gingiva as a local anesthetic and analgesic.\nPerform a 5-cm transverse incision with a number 15 scalpel blade in the left mandibular gingiva, to expose the mandibles of the animal.\nUse piezoelectric ultrasonic vibrations to grind the proximal aspect of the mandible into a 3-cm × 8-mm rectangle through the posterior mental foramen.\n\tNOTE: The vibration frequency was 28 ‒ 32 kHz.",
    "Remove the frontal part of the mandibular bone plate (dimensions, 3 cm × 8 mm) to expose the left IAN (Figure 2A)18.\n\tNOTE: The reconstruction site corresponds to the root apex of the first molar\nTransect the IAN with a scalpel to remove a 10-mm segment.\nInsert the proximal and distal stumps of the severed nerve into the nerve tube to a depth of 2 mm.\nUse 8-0 nylon sutures and a surgical microscope at 8X magnification to suture the tube to the proximal and distal nerve ends (Figure 2B)18.\nReturn the bone plate to its original site in the mandible.\nClose the wound with 4-0 nylon sutures.\nOne day after surgery, confirm that the mandibular bone plate is in its proper position.\n\t\n4.10.1 Perform computed tomography (CT) imaging of the facial bone under anesthesia. Set CT parameters as follows: 120 kVp, 200 mAs, 0.5 mm/s, 0.5-mm slice thickness.\n\t\t\nAdminister anesthesia using a mixture of 5 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 1 mg/kg xylazine (Figure 3).\nAdminister ampicillin (100 mg/day) as an antibiotic and acetaminophen (100 mg/day) as an analgesic for a week after surgery.\n5. Ethanol-induced CSGB: Development of the Reconstruction + CSGB Model\nPerform IAN reconstruction as described in section 4 and allow a week for recovery.\nAnesthetize the animal with 1.5% sevoflurane in oxygen (4 L/min) and air (6 L/min). Shave and clean the intended surgical field, as described in section 3.\nMark the incision line with a surgical skin marker by drawing a line on the left side chest area (Figure 4, the incision line is 20 cm in length).\nInject 5 mL of 1% lidocaine using a 21 G needle to the left side chest area as a local anesthetic and analgesic.\nIncise the left side chest skin with a number 10 scalpel blade.",
    "Incise the fat layer with an electric scalpel to expose the muscle fascia.\nExpose the serratus ventralis muscle and scalenus muscle.\nRaise the serratus ventralis muscle and scalenus muscle from ventral to dorsal to expose the second and third ribs (Figure 5).\nPerform a left lateral thoracotomy at the second and third intercostal space to expose the left cervical sympathetic ganglion (Figure 6).\nInject 0.2 mL of 99.5% ethanol into the cervical sympathetic ganglion using a 30 G needle under direct visualization (Figure 7).\nClose the intercostal space with interrupted 1-0 absorbable stitches.\nClose the skin with interrupted 3-0 nylon stitches.\nAdminister ampicillin (100 mg/day) as an antibiotic and acetaminophen (100 mg/day) as an analgesic for a week after surgery.\nAt 1 week after CSGB, measure facial skin temperature with infrared thermography to confirm the CSGB.\n6. Electrophysiological Recordings\nTo measure sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) of the IAN three months after reconstruction, anesthetize animals as described in section 3.\n\tNOTE: SNAP and SCV should be measured on both the experimental and normal control sides for each dog in both treatment groups.\nMake an incision in the left mandibular gingiva with a number 10 scalpel blade.\nCarefully remove the mandibular bone plate to avoid physically damaging the regenerated nerve.\nStimulate the IAN using a pair of needle electrodes, to record the SNAP and SCV.\n\t\nInsert the electrodes proximally to the nerve conduit.\nApply 10-kHz electrical stimulus 20 times.\nAnalyze the results.\n\t\nDetermine SNAP by calculating the average response amplitude to the electrical stimulation.\nMeasure the peak latency and peak amplitude from the chart recordings.",
    "Calculate the recovery index with the following equation: peak amplitude of the left IAN of the reconstruction-only or reconstruction + CSGB group / peak amplitude of the normal control (central segment of the right IAN in the reconstruction-only group)19,20.\n7.
