    "Molecular biologyGateway® Technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) is used to create plasmids for the yeast mbSUS assay following the manufacturer’s instructions. The unique attB1 and attB2 sites (B1 5’-3’: ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggct; B2 5’-3’: ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggt) are included in the forward and reverse primers as overhanging sequences, respectively. To fuse the PCR product in the proper reading frame with an N-terminal tag, the forward primer must include two additional nucleotides. Depending on the destination vector, a stop codon is included in the reverse primer or provided on the vector itself. Subsequent PCR products are inserted by BP reactions into the pDONR207 vector to yield Entry clones that are verified by DNA sequencing. Gateway Destination clones, pNX35-Dest for prey (Grefen and Blatt, 2012) and pMetYC-Dest for bait (Grefen et al., 2009), are generated by using LR Clonase® II in LR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Yeast transformationThe yeast transformation is performed under sterile condition. Prepare fresh competent yeast for each transformation.Pick THY.AP4 and AP5 yeast from long-term stock by a sterile toothpick or pick one colony of yeast from a stock plate (see Note 7) and inoculate 5 ml YPD in 14 ml sterile round bottom tubes and incubate in a shaker overnight at 200 rpm, 28 °C.Inoculate 45 ml of YPD with the 5 ml of overnight culture in autoclaved 500 ml flasks and incubate with shaking at 200 rpm, 28 °C for 3-5 h until OD600 0.6-0.8. Harvest cells by centrifugation (10 min at 2,000 x g, 4 °C) in 50 ml blue screw cap tubes and discard the supernatant.Wash cells with 20 ml of sterile water, centrifuge again, and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells with 1.8 ml of 0.",
    "1 M LiAc and transfer to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, spin down (30 sec at 2,000 x g, 4 °C), and discard the supernatant.Add an appropriate amount of 0.1 M LiAc (multiply the number of transformations by 20 µl) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Meanwhile, prepare sterilized PCR tubes with 10 µl of ssDNA and 5 µl of plasmid DNA (Destination clones, > 100 ng/μl) for each transformation.Prepare a master mix: mix 70 µl of PEG solution, 10 µl of 1 M LiAc, and 20 µl of competent yeast (from step B6) for each transformation.Mix the master mix with the DNA mixture from step B7.In a PCR machine, incubate at 30 °C for 30 min, then gently mix the mixture by pipette and heat shock cells at 43 °C for 30 min.Spin down the yeast at 2,000 x g for 1 min, and discard the supernatant by pipetting it carefully off the pelleted cells.Wash the cells with 100 µl of sterile water, spin down, and discard the supernatant.Resuspend cells in 50 µl of sterile water and plate on the appropriate selective media.THY.AP4 carrying bait vector plates on CSM-LM solid medium.THY.AP5 carrying prey vector plates on CSM-TUM solid medium.Incubate for 48-72 h at 28 °C. At least 100 colonies are expected in each plate.mbSUS assayThe mbSUS assay is performed under sterile conditions.Pick 5-15 colonies of transformed THY.AP5 yeast carrying the prey construct and inoculate in 3 ml CSM-TUM media. Grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28 °C.Pick 5-15 colonies of transformed THY.AP4 yeast carrying the bait construct and inoculate in 3 ml CSM-LM media. Grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28 °C.",
    "Reserve 750 µl from each bait and prey yeast culture to store as a stock culture (see Note for yeast stock preparation).Harvest yeast cells by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature and resuspend the pellets in YPD media (for each mating 20 µl of YPD media should be calculated).Mix 20 µl of each yeast (carrying bait) and yeast (carrying prey) in sterilized PCR tube and immediately drop 4 µl of each mated yeast onto YPD plate. Incubate overnight at 28 °C.Transfer the mated yeast from the YPD plate to a CSM-LTUM plate with a sterile toothpick (Figure 2A). Grow overnight at 28 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426205025_1422.jpgFigure 2. Example of a mbSUS assay. A. Yeast is transferred from the YPD plate to a CSM-LTUM plate with a sterile toothpick. B. Yeast is dropped on the CSM-LTUMAH plate with black spots on paper. C. Diploid yeast expressing KAT1-CubPLV as bait with NubG-X fusions of VAMP721, VAMP723, and the controls (negative: NubG; positive: NubWt) as prey were spotted onto different media as indicated. CSM-LTUM was used to verify the presence of both bait and prey vectors. The addition of different concentration of methionine (Met) to CSM-LTUMAH was used to verify interaction when K+ channel-CubPLV expression was suppressed. Diploid yeast was dropped at 1.0 and 0.1 OD600 in each case. Incubation time was 24 h for CSM-LTUM plate and 72 h for CSM-LTUMAH plates. Western blot analysis of the diploid yeast used in mbSUS was carried out with commercial HA antibody for the VAMP fusions and VP16 antibody for the K+ channel fusions. Ponceau S stains were used as blotting/loading control (right).",
    "Pick the mated yeast colony of each sample from the CSM-LTUM plate and inoculate in 3 ml liquid CSM-LTUM media, grow overnight in the incubator shaker at 200 rpm, 28 °C.Inoculate 1 ml of the mated cells into 3 ml of fresh CSM-LTUM media and grow at 200 rpm, 28 °C for 4-6 h for later Western blot analysis.Determine OD600 of yeast cells from step C7.Harvest 100 µl of remaining cells from step C7 by centrifugation at 2,000 x g, 1 min at room temperature and dilute them to OD600 1.0 and 0.1 respectively in sterile water.Apply 4 µl drops of each dilution on CSM-LTUM and CSM-LTUMAH plates with different methionine concentrations (0.5, 5, 50, and 500 µM; Figure 2B), grow them at 28 °C. Check for growth after 1 day and 3 days growth on CSM-LTUM plate and CSM-LTUMAH plate respectively. Figure 2C shows an example of a mbSUS assay which indicates an interaction between VAMP721 and KAT1 K+ channel, and no interaction between VAMP723 and KAT1 (Zhang et al., 2015). Diploid yeast containing NubWt as prey serves as the positive control and yeast containing NubG as prey is the negative control. In a good mbSUS assay, the sample of negative control should show weak or no yeast growth on CSM-LTUMAH plates, while the yeast grows well in the positive control sample (Figure 2C).Yeast protein extraction for western blot analysisDetermine the OD600 of the yeast culture.Harvest 2 ml of the culture and resuspend in ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer at a final OD600 of 100 for each sample. The volume of ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer used is calculated like this: e.g., the 1:10 diluted culture measurement yields an OD600 of 0.5, which is equivalent to an OD600 of 5 for 1 ml of culture.",
    "Harvest 2 ml of the culture yields OD600 of 10. Then resuspend them in 0.1 ml of ‘Lyse & Load’ buffer can get a final OD600 of 100 in the sample.Lyse the yeast with an ultrasonic disintegrator (amplitude setting 10 for 20 sec, keep samples on ice). Incubate for 10 min at 65 °C. Vortex for 10 sec, spin down the lysate at full speed for 30 sec and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Then sample can be used for Western blot analysis.Western blot analysisLoad protein ladder and 10-15 μl of each sample on an SDS-PAGE gel.Run gel with appropriate conditions and transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (e.g., by semidry transfer).Block the membrane for 60 min in the blocking buffer at room temperature.Transfer the membrane to the primary antibody solution; incubate for at least 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.Wash 3 times with 1x TBS-Tween, 10 min each wash.Transfer the membrane into the secondary antibody solution; incubate for at least 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.Wash 3 times with 1x TBS-Tween, 10 min each wash. Incubate the membrane with the chemiluminescent substrate for 5 min in darkness.Develop the membrane and take images with an imaging system.Wash membrane several times with distilled water to remove the chemiluminescent substrate. Incubate the membrane in the Ponceau S solution for 5 min.Wash the membrane several times with distilled water until the red bands are clearly visible.Scan Ponceau S image as blotting/loading control."
