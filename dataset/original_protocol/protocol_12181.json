  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were in accordance with Italian law. Murine AF samples were harvested from pregnant mice at 13.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) from C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J mice called GFP.\n1. Transposon Production\nNOTE: Transposon expression vectors were generated using standard cloning procedures. The plasmid DNA for mouse AF cells transfection was prepared using commercial kits.\nMix 10 ng of plasmid DNA with 50 µl of DH5α bacteria in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Incubate the microcentrifuge tube on ice for 20 min.\nHeat shock at 42 °C for 40 sec.\nPlace microcentrifuge tube on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 250 µl of pre-warmed (37 °C) lysogeny broth (LB) broth. Shake (300 rpm) at 37 °C for 30 min.\nSpread 30 µl of each transformation onto LB plates with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. Allow plates to dry and incubate inverted at 37 °C overnight.\nThe next day, in the afternoon, pick 3 colonies, using sterile 200 µl tips, from each transformation and transfer onto 0.1 mg/ml LB amp.\nShake (300 rpm) bacteria overnight at 37 °C.\nFor plasmid purification use commercial kits. Stock plasmids at -20 °C.\n2. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) Culture\nCoating of the 6-well Plates with 0.1% Gelatin\nCoat plates under the hood adding 1 ml of sterile 0.1% gelatin to each of the six wells. Let the gelatin polymerize on the incubator (37 °C) for 1 hr.\nDiscard the excess, and dry the plates for 1 hr.\nUse parafilm to seal and store plates at room temperature.\nInactivation of MEF with Mitomycin C\nThaw a vial of 4 x 106 MEF cells using a 37 °C bath.\nSeed MEF in the hood on a Petri dish (150 mm) with MEF medium.\nCultivate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n​(CAUTION) Add mitomycin C (5 mg/mL) when cells are confluent.",
    "Place cells into an incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) for 3 h.\nRemove medium with mitomycin C. Wash cells three times with 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS).\nAdd 2 ml of the commercial trypsin and place cells into the 37 °C incubator for 5 min. After, add 18 ml of blocking medium to stop the trypsin reaction.\nCount the cells using a burker chamber according to manufacturer's protocol.\nCentrifuge cells at 145 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nSeed 60,000 cells/cm2 of inactivated MEF on 0.1% gelatin coated plates.\nCultivate cells for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, before seeding AF and/or iPS-AF cells.\n3. Mouse AF Cell Isolation\nSet up timed matings and check vaginal plugs after 24 h of co-housing.\nObserve until 13.5 d.p.c and sacrifice pregnant dam through cervical dislocation.\nClean the abdominal wall of the animal using 70% ethanol.\nUsing scissors, perform a midline laparotomy incising the length of the abdominal wall to gain access into the abdominal cavity.\nExpose the uterus using forceps. Remove the uterus using scissors and transfer into a 100 mm Petri dish filled with sterile 1x PBS placed on ice.\nUse a stereomicroscope to collect the AF at 10X magnification.\nHold the uterus with forceps and remove the uterine wall with scissors. Be careful to avoid any damage to the fetal membranes and consequent amniotic fluid leakage.\nCollect fetuses into a 100 mm Petri dish filled with sterile 1x PBS and place on ice.\nGrasp the placenta of one fetus with a fine point forceps and place in a clean 100 mm Petri dish.\nRemove the yolk sac using fine point forceps.",
    "Disrupt the amnion using fine point forceps and collect 30 µl of AF for each fetus using an insulin syringe into a 15 ml conical vial.\nAfter AF collection, wash each fetus with sterile 1x PBS supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and collect into the 15 ml conical tube containing the AF.\nCentrifuge AF at 145 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant under the hood and seed the pelleted AF cells.\n4. Mouse AF Cell Culture\nSeeding of Mouse AF Cells\nOne day prior to the seeding, prepare a 0.1% gelatin-coated 6-well plate with mitomycin C-treated MEF.\nAfter AF collection, seed the cells obtained from an amniocentesis (around 1 x 107 cells obtained from 6 fetuses) onto the mitotically inactivated MEF using AF culture medium.\nCultivate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, changing the medium every other day.\nAfter 7 days of culture, transfect AF cells following the procedure described below.\n5. Transfection, iPS-AF Cell Generation and Culture\nNOTE: Mouse AF cells were transfected with the PB-tetO2-IRES-OKMS transposon plasmid, in conjunction with a transposase expression plasmid (mPBase) and with the reverse tetracycline transactivator (PB-CAG-rtTA) transposon plasmid. All plasmids were provided by Professor Andras Nagy33.\nMix 1 µg of PB-tetO2-IRES-OKMS with 0.5 µg of mPBase and 0.5 µg of PB-CAG-rtTA (Total DNA: 2 µg) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nDilute the DNA to 100 µL with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium - DMEM).\nAdd 8 µL of the transfection reagent (e.g., FUGENE) (at the ratio of plasmid DNA:transfection agent of 2 µg (DNA) to 8 µL transfection agent) into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing DNA.\nIncubate transfection reagent/DNA mixture for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Add dropwise 100 µL of the transfection reagent/DNA mixture per well to a 6-well plate with mouse AF cells and distribute by gentle swirling, with a final volume of 2 mL/well. Leave for 24 h.\nThe day after, induce the expression of the Yamanaka's factors (Oct4, Klf4, cMyc, Sox2) by feeding the cells with fresh iPS-AF medium supplemented with 1.5 µg/mL of doxycycline (2 mL of media for each well).\nFeed cells every day, without passage, with fresh dox-containing medium (maintain cells in media supplemented with doxycycline until point 5.13).\nObserve cells within 24 h for mCherry expression and daily for colony formation (colonies typically appear between 20 and 30 days after transfection).\nOne day before colony picking, prepare a 96-well tissue culture plate with mitomycin C-treated MEF.\nPick single colonies in 50 µL of volume using a 200 µL pipette, and transfer them sequentially into a 96-well plate in individual wells.\nThe day after, dissociate every colony into single cells by adding 50 µl of the commercial trypsin and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nPipette up and down to disaggregate the colony.\nTransfer 50 µL of the trypsin containing the dissociated colony into a new well with inactivated MEF on a 0.1% gelatin coated 96 well-plate filled with 100 µL of fresh iPS-AF medium supplemented with doxycycline.\nWhen cells reach 60-70% confluence, split into a well of a 24-well plate.\nWhen cells reach 60-70% confluence, split 1:2 to two wells, one with doxycycline and the other without doxycycline, to verify if colonies appear also in the condition without doxycycline.\nContinue to maintain iPS-AF clones, doxycycline independent, on inactivated MEF in the iPS-AF medium.\nCultivate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, changing medium daily.\n6. Alkaline Phosphatase Staining",
    "Perform alkaline phosphatase staining following the manufacturer's protocol whenever there is the appearance of doxycycline independent iPS-AF cells.\n7. Immunofluorescence\nWhenever there is the appearance of doxycycline independent iPS-AF cells, seed 150,000 cells/cm2 on a well of a 24-well plate with inactivated MEF, and grow cells for 48 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n(CAUTION) Fix the cells by adding 300 µl per well of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature.\nAdd 300 µl of 0.1% NP-40 to permeabilize cells.\nRinse cells with 300 µl of 0.1% PBS-Tween 20.\nAdd 300 µl of the blocking buffer (10% horse serum in 1x PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature.\nUse the following primary antibodies: Oct4 (1:80), Sox2 (1:80), Klf4 (1:80), Nanog (1:100) and SSEA1 (1:80).
