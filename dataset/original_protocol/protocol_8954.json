    "1. Preparation of the Animal\nAll experimental procedures are carried out in accordance with the Dutch law and after evaluation by a local ethical committee at the VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nAnesthetize a Wistar rat (P25-P45, ♂/♀) with isoflurane (2-3% in oxygen) and subsequently with urethane (20% in 0.9% NaCl, 1.6-1.7 g/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Assess the depth of the anesthesia by monitoring pinch withdrawal, eyelid reflexes, and vibrissae movements.\nAdminister an additional dose of urethane (10% of initial dose) in case the animal does not reach sufficient anesthetic depth or whenever vibrissae twitches are observed during the course of the experiment.\nPlace the anesthetized animal on the stereotaxic frame equipped with a heating pad, insert rectal temperature probe and maintain the animal’s body temperature at 37.5±0.5 °C by a heating pad.\nPosition the animal’s head in the stereotaxic frame; trim the hair on top of the head using scissors to render the skin visible.\nInject 100 µl 1% lidocaine (in 0.9% NaCl) subcutaneously for local anesthesia at the operation site and wait 3-5 min. Remove the skin covering the surface of the skull by cutting in the caudal-to-rostral direction and clean the remaining tissue.\nClean the skull extensively with 0.9% NaCl and absorbent swabs.\nDetermine the coordinates of the target area on the left hemisphere (for primary somatosensory cortex (S1): 2.5 mm posterior and 5.5 mm lateral to bregma). Mark the location on the skull with a surgical skin marker pen.\nScrape off the bone gently by a dental drill from the region of interest until the bone becomes transparent and blood vessels are clearly visible.",
    "Make a 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm craniotomy by cutting a window in the thinned skull with a scalpel (#11), avoiding damage to the dura mater and blood vessels. Optional: mark the edges of the craniotomy using a surgical skin marker pen to improve visibility.\nApply a thin layer of superglue on the dry skull and then dental cement to construct a bath (i.e. recording chamber) enclosing the craniotomy.\nTrim the whiskers at the contralateral side to exactly 5 mm from the whisker follicle. Optional: highlight the trimmed whiskers with black mascara.\n2. Juxtasomal Recordings and Biocytin Labeling\nMake patch pipettes of borosilicate glass with inside tip diameter of ~1 μm to obtain electrodes with 3-5 MΩ resistance. Note: The ideal pipette morphology for the juxtasomal recording is a gradual slender taper, a low cone angle, and a ~1 μm tip (Figure 1).\nDepending on the recording depth (with respect to the pial surface), the taper dimensions of the recording electrode should be adjusted. Critically important is that the taper diameter should be less than 75 μm at point of entry in the brain to avoid mechanical damage or stress to the recording area. This indicates that for superficial cortical recordings, a taper of 300-500 μm with an outer diameter of maximally 75 μm is required (Figure 1A) whereas recordings from relatively deep cortical layers require a longer taper of 1,500-1,800 μm, again with maximal outer diameter of 75 μm (at 1,800 μm from the electrode tip).\nLoad the patch pipette with normal rat ringer (NRR) supplemented with 2% biocytin (see Table 1 for solutions and reagents) and mount the patch pipette on a head stage fixed to a micromanipulator.",
    "Set the angle of the electrode holder to 34° with respect to the sagittal plane to specifically target the D2 column of rat S1.\nConnect the head stage to an amplifier in bridge-mode (i.e. current clamp).\nPosition the patch pipette in close proximity to the craniotomy. Fill the bath with 0.9% NaCl and determine the electrode resistance which should be between 3-5 MΩ, assessed by applying a square pulse with positive current injection (1 nA, 200 msec on/off).\nEstablish overpressure of 100-150 mbar and advance the patch pipette in 1 µm steps while applying positive current as square pulses (1 nA, 200 msec on/off). Monitor the robust resistance change upon establishing contact with the dura mater. At this point, set the coordinates of the micromanipulator to ‘zero’ to allow accurate depth measurements.\nAdvance in 1 µm step-mode until the patch pipette penetrates the dura mater indicated by a sudden drop in electrode resistance. Remove the holding pressure of the pipette.\nSearch for single units while advancing in 1 µm steps. Monitor the electrode resistance continuously by applying 200 msec on/off pulses. An increase in electrode resistance typically indicates the proximity of a single neuron. Advance the electrode until positive action potential (AP) waveforms of ~2 mV are recorded (Figures 2A and 2B).\nOptional: Record the spontaneous spiking pattern of the neuron and determine whisker-evoked spiking by, for instance, caudally deflecting individual whiskers for 200 msec at an angle of 3.3° using a piezoelectric device18.",
    "Advance the electrode until the resistance is 25-35 MΩ and spikes have amplitudes of 3-8 mV to obtain optimal conditions of juxtasomal filling. Start the juxtasomal filling by applying square pulses of positive current (1 nA, 200 msec on/off). Slowly and gradually increase the current by steps of 0.1 nA while monitoring the AP waveform and frequency (Figures 2A and 2B).\nMonitor the membrane opening as a clear increase in AP frequency during the on-phase of the block pulse (Figure 2C). The spike waveform during filling shows an increased width and reduced after-hyperpolarization (Figures 2C and 2D). Additional parameters include increased noise or a small (1-5 mV) negative DC shift.\nIncrease or decrease the current (1 nA) while filling to maintain stable biocytin infusion. Reduce or stop the current pulses upon sudden increase of the AP frequency to avoid toxicity by excess influx of extracellular ions, such as sodium ions. Note: every neuron will respond differently to the current injection and juxtasomal labeling parameters need to be adjusted depending on individual recording conditions.\nClosely monitor the signal after stopping the current injection. The spike waveform after a filling session is usually broadened and shows a strongly reduced after hyperpolarization. Wait for recovery of the neuron, which is apparent when the spike waveform returns to its original properties (i.e. presence of normal after-hyperpolarization, Figure 2).\nRepeat biocytin filling sessions after complete recovery of the neuron to increase biocytin load for improved staining quality.\nRetract the patch pipette in steps of 1 µm until the spike amplitude decreases to reduce any mechanical stress to the cell. Wait at least 1 hr for the biocytin to diffuse intracellularly while closely monitoring the animal’s body temperature and breathing.\n3. Perfusing the Animal and Removing the Brain",
    "Prepare the perfusion setup, rinse, and preload the tubing with 0.9% NaCl.\nPosition the animal on a surgical tray and secure with standard labeling tape. Ensure sufficient depth of the anesthesia; foot pinch and eyelid reflexes should be absent.\nMake a medial to lateral incision (5-6 cm) through the abdominal wall just beneath the rib cage and proceed in posterior-anterior direction to expose the sternum. Pull the sternum anteriorly and carefully separate the liver from the diaphragm.\nMake a small incision in the diaphragm, cut through the lower ribs and continue the incision along the entire length of the abdominal cavity to expose the heart.\nRemove the pericardium.\nInsert the needle into the left ventricle and make an incision in the right atrium. Perfuse with 0.9% NaCl (~8 ml/min) until decoloration of the liver is complete.\nSwitch the infusion to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) until stiffness of front paw and lower jaw is apparent.\nDecapitate the rat using a pair of scissors\nRemove the remaining neck muscles and expose the skull completely.\nPosition the scissors in the brain stem on the dorsal side and cut the bone carefully along the sagittal suture, maintaining the dorsal position.\nRemove the bones from both sides of the sagittal suture to expose the brain using forceps. Carefully remove the dura to avoid damage.\nCarefully insert a blunt spatula to the ventral side of the brain and remove the brain gently.\nPost-fix the entire brain overnight in PFA at 4 °C. Switch the brain to 0.05 M phosphate buffer (PB) and store at 4 °C.\n4. Slicing the Brain in Tangential Sections",
    "Take the brain out of the 0.05 M PB and put it on a filter paper facing anterior. Use a sharp razor blade to cut off the cerebellum along the coronal plane and separate the hemispheres by cutting along the mid sagittal plane.\nApply superglue on the mounting platform and mount the left hemisphere on its sagittal plane with anterior facing right. Secure the mounting platform at an angle of 45° on a vibratome and submerge the brain in 0.05 M PB.\nSecure a razor blade on the vibratome and make sure that the first contact with the brain surface is in the middle of the anterior-posterior plane of the hemisphere. Cut 24 100 µm sections and collect them in a 24-well plate containing 0.05 M PB.\n5. Histological Procedures\nPerform histological protocols for the cytochrome oxidase staining24 and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method according to previously described methods25. Optional: visualize biocytin using fluorescent avidin/streptavidin-Alexa conjugates. This additionally allows double-staining with retrograde or anterograde tracing techniques.\nWash sections 5 x 5 min with 0.05 M PB and prepare the 3,-3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)-containing solution for the cytochrome oxidase staining to visualize barrels in layer 4 (L4) of S1 (see Table 2 for solutions and reagents). Incubate sections 6-12 from the pia in the preheated solution for 30-45 min at 37 °C.\nRinse sections with 0.05 M PB for 6 x 5 min and quench endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating all sections in 3% H2O2 in 0.05 M PB for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\nRinse sections with 0.05 M PB for 5 x 10 min. Incubate sections in ABC-solution (see Table 3 for solutions and reagents) overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Rinse sections with 0.05 M PB for 5 x 10 min and prepare the DAB-solution to visualize the biocytin-filled neuron (see Table 4 for solutions and reagents). Incubate sections in filtered solution for 45-60 min at RT.\nRinse sections with 0.05 M PB for 5 x 10 min. Mount sections on microscope slides and cover slip with Mowiol (see Table 5 for solutions and reagents).\nDetermine labeling quality using light microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
