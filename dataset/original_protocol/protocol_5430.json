    "Plant cultivationArabidopsis thaliana: Arabidopsis seeds (ecotype Columbia-0) were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar (Sigma-Aldrich) plates supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose and cultivated in tissue culture under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark regime (irradiance of 150 μE m-2 sec-1) at 70% humidity. Arabidopsis seeds germinated on soil were grown under short-day conditions (8 h of light/16 h of dark [23 °C/21 °C], irradiance of 150 μE m-2 sec-1, 70% humidity).Nicotiana benthamiana and Capsicum annuum plants were grown in soil in a greenhouse with daily watering and subjected to a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle (25 °C/21 °C) at 300 μE m-2 sec-1 light and 40% relative humidity.Sample preparationPunch out two to four leaf discs with a cork borer (diameter 0.7 cm), combine discs from the same sample in a single 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and immediately freeze leaf discs in liquid nitrogen. Samples can be stored at -80 °C until further processing.Grind frozen leaf material in 200 µl extraction buffer (see Recipes) in an overhead stirrer until the material is completely thawed (be sure to prevent heating of the sample). Alternatively, leaf discs can be ground to a fine powder in a pre-cooled mortar. Add extraction buffer and continue to grind until the material is completely thawed. Pour the suspension into a microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge samples at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.Determine the protein content of the extracts with the Bio-Rad Assay Dye according to the manufacturer’s instructions using BSA as a standard.Adjust the protein concentration of the supernatant to 1 mg/ml with extraction buffer. Keep samples on ice until use. Proceed to measurement as soon as possible.",
    "It is generally not recommended to store the samples for a longer period of time as the proteasome activity is relative unstable even if stored at -80 °C.AssayPrepare assay buffer (see Recipes).Add 25-50 μg of plant extract into the wells of a black walled 96-well plate and subsequently mix with 220 μl assay buffer. The amount of extract used is plant species and tissue dependent but should be kept the same within a single experiment. Empirically, 50 µg from Nicotiana tabacum or Capsicum annuum and 25 µg from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf samples work best. Process at least three biological replicates per sample/experimental condition (that is material harvested from different plants receiving the same treatment).Incubate for 15 min at 30 °C.Add proteasome substrate into the wells (15-30 μl/per sample; final concentration should be 100 μM to 200 μM). Add at least three blank wells including all solutions except protein extract for later background subtraction.Measure the release of amino-methyl-coumarin at 30 °C (A360ex/A460em) on a fluorescent plate reader every 1.5 min over a period of 120 min.The protocol details in Gen5 (Biotek Instruments) are as follows:Plate Type: 96-WELL PLATESet Temperature: Setpoint 30 °C, Preheat before moving to next stepStart Kinetic: Runtime 2:00:00 (HH:MM:SS), Interval 0:01:30, 81 ReadsRead: Fluorescence Endpoint, Full Plate, Filter Set1: Excitation: 360/40, Emission: 460/40, Optics: Top, Gain: 60, Readspeed: Normal, Readheight: 1 mmEnd Kinetic"
