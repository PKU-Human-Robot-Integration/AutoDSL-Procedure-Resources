Verify the digestion of pVAX.A120 vector in agarose gel electrophoresis and purify both digested PCR product and digested pVAX.A120 vector backbone using GeneJET PCR Purification kit following manufacturer instructions.For optimal ligation, the concentration of digested pVAX.A120 vector backbone and digested PCR product from gene of interest are calculated in NEBiocalculator to achieve 3:1 of insert:vector ratio. The calculated amount of insert and vector are added to the 20 µl ligation mix consists of 20 Units of of T4 DNA ligase and 2 µl 10x DNA ligase buffer. Incubate the ligation complex at 22 °C for 10 min.Cell transformationUse 50 µl Top10 E. coli competent cells and thaw it on ice.Chill approximately 10 µl of the ligation mixture.Add 50 µl of competent cells to the 4 µl of ligation mixture and mix gently.",
    "Do not exceed 10% volume of the competent cells, i.e., not more than 5 µl of ligation mixture.Incubate the complex on ice for 30 min.Heat shock at 42 °C for 45 s.Add 950 µl of SOC media stored at room temperature.Place tube at 37 °C for 60 min.

Verify the linearization of pVAX.A120 vector with desired gene in agarose gel electrophoresis and purify it using GeneJET PCR Purification kit following manufacturer instructions.Use the linearized product to produce mRNA using MEGAscript kit (Use 1 µg Linear template DNA and anti-reverse CAP analog (ARCA; [m7G(5’)G])). The reaction volume is 20 µl (1x). For co-transcriptional capping of ARCA, the concertation of GTP is reduced to 5 mM instead of 10 mM as with other nucleosides. To increase the chance of ARCA being first base to be transcribed, 6 mM of ARCA is added to the reaction.Choose the bases (ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP) for unmodified mRNA production.The chemically modified nucleosides (Example: 100% Pseudo-UTP, 100% N1-methylpseudo-UTP, 25% s2-thio-UTP/5-methyl-CTP and 100% N1-methylpseudo-UTP/100% 5-methyl-CTP) are used to generate chemically modified mRNA. Table 1 shows an example to generate both modified and unmodified mRNA.Table 1. 1x unmodified or modified mRNA imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201215/20201215180306_0962.jpg Mix the solution by flicking the tube and use parafilm to cover the lid.",

Otherwise, wash buffer consists of PBS and 0.05% Tween-20. Make sure for each wash all the wells are covered with wash buffer and soaked for 1 min.Decant the wash buffer and dry the wells using absorbent paper.Add HRP conjugate working solution (prepared following instruction for specific ELISA) to each well and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Wash the plate 7 times with washing buffer (appropriate for specific ELISA). Make sure for each wash all the wells are covered with wash buffer and soaked for 1 min.Decant the wash buffer and dry the wells using absorbent paper.Add 90 μl of Substrate Reagent to each well. Cover with a new plate sealer. Incubate for about 15 min at 37 °C in the dark.Add 50 µl stop solution and determine the optical density of each well using a plate reader at the specific wavelength (normally 450 nm).",
    "Cytokine levels are assessed by interpolating unknown values from standard curve using the Michaelis-Menten model in the Graphpad Prism v.6.0 software (www.graphpad.com[href=http://www.graphpad.com]).Real-time RT-PCRCollect total RNAFor RT-PCR collect and stimulate the blood as mentioned above.Instead of collecting plasma after 6 h and 24 h use the blood to collect total RNA.Collect total RNA from blood using PAXgene Blood RNA kit.Check the concentration and purity of total RNA (RNA integrity number-RIN score should be above five).Note: For qPCR application RIN score above 5 (partially degraded RNA)works moderately well. However for RNA-seq application RIN score above 7 (pure RNA) is needed. Store the RNA -80 °C.cDNA synthesisUse 200 ng total RNA to perform cDNA synthesis using iScriptTM cDNA kit.Priming: 25 °C for 7 min.Reverse Transcription: 45 °C for 20 min.RT inactivation: 95 °C for 2 min.Dilute the cDNA 1:20.Store at -20 °C.SYBR-Green based quantitative Real-time PCRUse 5 µl of diluted cDNA with 2x Power-SYBR green PCR master mix (7.5 µl) and both forward and reverse primer (1 µl each, 1.0 µM) in 15 µl reaction volume.Use the following program in ViiA7.Initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C.40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 2 min at 60 °C (annealing and extension).Collect and analyze melting curve and Ct values.Flow cytometry analysis of DsRed transfected blood samplesIn order to assess whether TransIT complexed DsRed mRNA transfected any cells in whole blood, stimulate the blood as mentioned above.Instead of collecting plasma or total RNA after 6 h and 24 h use the whole blood for flow cytometry.Add 2 ml of Erythrocyte lysis buffer to 2 ml whole blood mix well.Incubate at room temperature for 10 min (Do not exceed the time of incubation).Spin the tube at 500 x g for 5 min.Decant the supernatant.Wash the cells with 1 ml PBS.",
    "Spin it at 500 x g for 5 min and remove PBS and resuspend the pellet at FACS buffer (10% FBS in PBS).Measure DsRed expression using appropriate laser and red channel (558 ex/583 em for DsRed).The gating strategy to detect DsRed positive cells illustrated in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3850/bioprotoc-10-24-3850-g001.jpgFigure 1. Gating strategy of whole blood cells. Post Erythrocyte lysis buffer treatment and isolation of white blood cells, the cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis and analyzed. The gating strategies are detailed in the above figure. Briefly, singlets were gated based on their location in the FSC/SSC plot. From viable cells, lymphocytes and monocytes were gated based on their size and granularity in the FSC/SSC plot. DsRed positive cells were gated from the cell pool choosing RFP channel.Count minimum of 50,000 gated cells per tube with flow rate of 100 cells per second.The RNA ImmunoGeneic Assay protocol uses R848 (Resiquimod) TLR7/8 agonist as a positive control that mimic the endosomal TLR7/8 activation upon RNA endosomal entry. The blood only sample will serve as a background control whereas TransIT treated samples will be the appropriate negative control."
