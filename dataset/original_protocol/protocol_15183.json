    "1. Bone Marrow Cell Isolation\nEuthanize male donor FVB/NJ mice and female FVB/NJ mice using CO2 method followed by cervical dislocation. The female FVB/NJ bone marrow cells will be used as competitive cells.\nUse small scissors and forceps, dissect out femurs and tibiaes from mice and place them in a 60 mm tissue culture dish containing 6 ml ice-cold RPMI1640 with 5% heat inactivated FBS. Use kimwipe tissue to remove muscle and other tissues. Cut off both ends of each bone shaft in the dish.\nConnect the end of the bone with 23G needle on 3 cc syringe, flush out bone marrow with RPMI1640 with 5% heat inactivated FBS into the dish. Disaggregate bone marrow tissues by repeated aspirations using the same needle. Transfer the cell suspension to 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nSpin down the cells for 5 min at 400 x g, remove the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1 ml of room temperature red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM potassium bicarbonate, 10 mM Ammonium chloride, 0.1 mM of EDTA, PH=7.4) and incubate at room temperature for 5 min then add 5-10 ml of RPMI 1640 with 5% heat inactivated FBS.",
    "Pass the cells through a cell strainer. Collect the flow through to a new tube. Spin down for 5 min at 400 x g. Remove the supernatant; the cell pellet should not contain any red color. The absence of red color indicates a complete removal of red blood cells. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of RPMI1640 with 5% heat inactivated FBS. Gently vortex to make sure the cell suspension is completely uniform. Take an aliquot and count the cells in a hemacytometer. Calculate how much volume of cells needed for bone marrow transplantation and aliquot enough cells and mix male donor cells with competitor female cells at a ratio of 5:2. Spin down for 5 min at 400 x g, wash with PBS, resuspend in PBS with the final concentration of donor cells at 5×106/ml and competitor cells at 2×106/ml.\n2. Competitive Bone Marrow Transplantation\nIrradiate female recipient mice (8-12 wks of age) with 137Cs gamma rays radiator at a single dose of 11Gy 4-6 hr before bone marrow transplantation.\nPlace the irradiated female mice in a mouse restrainer. Inject the mixed donor and competitor cells via tail vein in 0.1 ml of total volume such that each mouse receives 5×105 donor cells and 2×105 competitor bone marrow cells.\n3. Sample Collection",
    "Couples weeks after bone marrow transplantation, collect peripheral blood samples (~50 μl) from female recipient mouse by retro-orbital bleeding under anesthesia condition. Samples are collected into EDTA coated tubes. BM samples can also be collected at the end of experiment, usually at least 4 months post transplantation, with same procedures as previous described (Step 1); usually 20-40% of 1 tibia BM cells are enough to make enough amount of DNA. Blood or BM samples from age matched normal female and male mice are also collected to prepare standard curve.\n4. Genomic DNA Isolation\nAdd 4× volume of room temperature RBC lysis buffer (~ 200 μl) to each blood sample. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 1 ml of PBS, then spin down to remove most of the lysed RBC.\nIsolate DNA using a blood DNA extraction kit (QIAmp DNA Blood extraction kit). Pre-warm the elution buffer (AE) at 37 °C to enhance the yield of eluted DNA. Male and female DNAs for standard curve are isolated similarly.\n(Optional) Genomic DNA can be further purified or concentrated using EtOH precipitation method in the presence of 3 M Sodium Acetate (pH=5.5). The DNA pellets are then resuspended in 40-50 μl distilled water for analysis immediately or stored at -20 °C for future use.\nMeasure the DNA concentration with Nanodrop ND-1000 spectra photometer. Samples with OD 260/280 between 1.8-2.0 are used for further analysis.\nDilute DNA with DNAase free H2O to 4ng/μl in a total volume of 50 μl.\n5. Standard Curve Preparation\nDilute male DNA and female DNA to a concentration of 4 ng/μl, and make the DNA mixture according the Table1\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n% of male DNA in Female Background,Volume (μl) of 4ng/μl male DNA,Volume (μl) of 4ng/μl female DNA,Total volume(μl)\n0.2,1,499,500\n0.5,1,199,200\n2.5,5,195,200\n12.5,25,175,200\n50,100,100,200",
    "87.5,175,25,200\n100,200,0,200\nTable 1. Sample preparation for standard curve. Normal male and female FVB/NJ mice at the age of 8-12wks were sacrificed. Blood and BM cells were collected. DNAs from male cells and female cells were isolated and re-suspended at a concentration of 4ng/μl. The male and female DNAs were mixed at various ratios to generate the DNA standard sample mixtures.\n6. Real-time PCR\nSet up the PCR reaction plate by mixing SYBR Green supermix reagent with primers and genomic DNA. The reaction volume (20 μl) contains 400 nM of each primer and 5 μl of blood cell genomic DNA (4ng/μl x5 μl=20 ng) in each reaction. DNA samples and standards were set up in triplicate. The sequences of primers are shown in Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nGene name,Forward,Reverse\nBcl2,5′-AAGCTGTCACAGAGGGGCTA,5′- CAGGCTGGAAGGAGAAGATG\nZfy1,5-TGGAGAGCCACAAGCTAACCA,5'- CCCAGCATGAGAAAGATTCTTC\nTable 2. RT-PCR primer sequence for murine Bcl2 and Zfy1.\nPerform PCR reaction using Biorad iQ5 PCR machine with the following conditions: 95 °C 3 min, 42 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 10 sec, 58 °C for 25 sec and 72 °C for 15 sec, followed by a melting-curve step.\nObtain Cycle threshold (Ct) values by Bio-Rad iQ5 2.1 Standard Edition Optical System. Calculate δCt (CtZfy1-CtBcl2) value, and Zfy1 expression level is calculated as the value of 2-δ Ct.\nEstablish standard curves for each reaction series using 2-δCt reading from known male/female standard mixtures. The standard curves are generated by plotting the mean of 2-δCt value of triplicates to the known % male DNA in the mixture with linear regression fitting.\nSubscription Required.
