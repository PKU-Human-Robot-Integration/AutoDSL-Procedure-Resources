  "procedures": [
    "Animal experiments were approved by the University of Wuerzburg and the legal state authorities of Lower Franconia in accordance with the animal protection guidelines and European Communities Council guidelines (approval number: 55.2-2531.01 76/11). All efforts were made to minimize pain or discomfort of the animals used.\nNote: Electrode implantation was performed as described elsewhere18.\n1. Cylinder Test (Figure 2)\nPrepare a clear plastic glass cylinder (height: 40 cm, diameter: 19 cm) by cleaning the cylinder with a 0.1% acetic acid solution.\nPrepare cards with date of experiment and each rat's identification number.\nPlace two mirrors in 90Â° angle behind the cylinder.\nPlace the camera in front of the cylinder such that the distance between the camera and the cylinder allows a good view of the paws.\nPlace the rat in the transport box.\n\tNote: The animals should be handled by the experimenter prior to the test to avoid stress.\nTransport the rat from home cage to the cylinder using the transport box.\nPlace the rat in the cylinder (Figure 3).\n\t\nAlways perform all behavioral tests at the same time of the day to avoid circadian differences in activity. If the animal is connected to the stimulus generator by cable make sure the cable is not twisted during the experiment.\nPress the \"record\" button on camera. Show the card with the actual date of experiment and rat's identification number to the camera. Start recording.\nAfter five minutes, remove the animal from the cylinder and put it back into the home cage using the transport box.\nClean the cylinder with a 0.1% acetic acid solution.",
    "Evaluate the paw use from recorded video by counting the left and right paw wall contacts (paw use in percent) as well as rearings (standing on hind paws with or without supporting on the cylinder wall). The cylinder test can be also evaluated automatically by an appropriate software.\n\tNote: A healthy rat uses both paws equally. The hemiparkinsonian rat uses the paw affected due to lesion a lesser extent.\n2. Staircase Test (Figure 4)\nAcquisition Phase\n\t\nOne day prior to the training familiarize the animals with the pellets used in the Staircase test.\n\t\t\nOptional: To increase the animal's motivation use a dietary restriction (10-15 g of standard laboratory chow to maintain body weight at 90% of the free feeding level16). However, this is not obligatory to achieve a positive training effect. This study was conducted without food restriction.\nPrepare a clear plastic glass staircase box (height: 34.5 cm, length: 35.5 cm, width: 12 cm and narrow compartment 6 cm) by cleaning the box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution. Note: The staircase box is a two-compartment-box with a raised platform and two stairs in the narrow compartment. The left steps on the stairs in the narrow compartment can be reached only with the left paw, the right steps only with the right paw.\n\t\tNote: The standard staircase boxes consist of two compartments with a lid, if it is to be used for experiments with rats stimulated via cable, use a high box without lid.\nRemove the staircase and fill the wells on each step with eight 45 mg pellets.\nInsert the staircase and put eight additional pellets on the heightened platform.\nPlace the rat in the transport box.\nTransport the rat from home cage to the staircase box using the transport box.",
    "Place the rat in the staircase box (Figure 5).\nAfter five minutes, remove the animal from the staircase box and put it back into the home cage using the transport box.\nNote how many pellets were eaten from platform and (eventually) from right and left staircase.\nRefill the staircase by filling the wells on each step with eight 45 mg pellets.\nClean the staircase box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution and place the additional pellets on the platform.\nRepeat this procedure (acquisition phase) three days in a row.\n\t\tNote: All experiments described were performed on male Sprague Dawley rats. The duration of the different training modules can differ in rats of different strain, sex and vender.\nFree Choice Test\n\t\nClean the staircase box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution.\nRemove the staircase and fill the wells on each step with eight 45 mg pellets.\nPlace the rat in the transport box.\nTransport the rat from home cage to the staircase box using the transport box.\nPlace the rat in the staircase box.\nAfter five minutes, remove the animal from the staircase box and put it back into the home cage using the transport box.\n\t\tNote how many pellets were eaten from right and left staircase.\nNote: If the animals still have problems with grasping pellet, add some more on the platform where they can be easily reached.\nRefill the staircase by filling the wells on each step with eight 45 mg pellets.\nClean the staircase box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution for the next animal.\nRepeat this procedure (free choice phase) three days in a row.\n\t\tNote: The presented results were obtained by training conducted without a resting period between modules. Some groups prefer a resting day for consolidation, to support the training process.\nForced Choice Test",
    "Clean the staircase box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution.\nRemove the staircase and fill the wells on each step on the left staircase with eight (first three days of the module) or four (consecutive three days of the module) 45 mg pellets.\n\t\t\nPerform the forced choice test on the side, where the impairment will occur.\n\t\t\tNote: We perform the Parkinson lesion on the right hemisphere and therefore train selectively the left paw.\nPlace the rat in the transport box.\nTransport the rat from home cage to the staircase box using the transport box.\nPlace the rat in the staircase box.\nAfter five minutes, remove the animal from the staircase box and put it back into the home cage using the transport box.\nNote how many pellets were eaten from left staircase.\nRefill the staircase by filling the wells on each step with eight or four 45 mg pellets (number of pellets depends on training day).\nClean the staircase box with a 0.1% acetic acid solution for the next animal.\nRepeat this procedure (forced choice phase) six days in a row.\nData Acquisition\n\t\nPerform the experiment as described for the forced choice module (four pellets in each well on the left staircase) on two consecutive days. Calculate the success rate (number of pellets eaten) as mean of the two days.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
