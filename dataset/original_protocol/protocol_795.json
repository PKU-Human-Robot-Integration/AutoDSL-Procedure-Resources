    "**Membrane Preparation**\n1. Place a pre-cut \\(22 x 66 mm) polycarbonate membrane onto a glass slide, carefully using a gloved finger and tweezers to separate the membrane and paper. \n  **Note 1:** The orientation of the polycarbonate membranes is not important.\n**Note 2:** Discard any membranes that have creases or other large-scale imperfections.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5089/original/Figure_1.jpg?1486505820\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n2. Place membranes onto a shelf in the plasma cleaner. \n  **Note:** Place membranes on bottom shelf to reduce risk of them flying after vacuum is removed.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5095/original/Figure_2.png?1486505822\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n3. Close the plasma cleaner door, and then turn on the main power and pump switch. To form a vacuum, ensure that the 3-way valve lever is at the 9:00 position as shown below. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5107/original/Figure_3.jpg?1486505825\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n4. Allow vacuum to form for 2 minutes. Once the vacuum has formed, simultaneously turn the valve to 12:00 while turning the power to the Hi setting \\(shown below). \n  **Note:** The plasma should be a bright pink. If not, adjust the air valve to increase or decrease the amount of oxygen you are letting into the chamber.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5109/original/Figure_4.jpg?1486505826\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n \n5. Treat membranes with plasma for 7 minutes. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5111/original/Figure_5.jpg?1486505828\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n6. **Critical** – After treatment, in the following order, turn the RF level valve from HIGH to OFF, then turn off the power followed by turning off the vacuum.  Then slowly open the valve until you can barely hear air entering chamber \\(Approximate valve position shown below).  Leave until the door opens \\(~5 min).\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5161/original/Figure_6.jpg?1486505829\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n7. Remove slides from plasma cleaner and transfer to a 4-well dish.",
    "**Note 1:** If membranes have slightly folded over, slowly flip the membrane back using needle nose tweezers.\n**Note 2:** If membranes have blown off the slide entirely, repeat above procedure to ensure you know which side was exposed to plasma.\n8. Quickly pipet 5 mL of 1xPBS over the dry membrane, preventing the membrane from folding on itself.\n  **Pro-tip:** gently hydrate one end of the membrane with a single drop so that it adheres to the slide before dispensing the entire volume.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5113/original/Figure_7.jpg?1486505830\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n9. Remove any air bubbles underneath the membrane using wafer forceps.\n  \n10. Membranes are now functionalized and ready for use.\n  **Note 1:** Membranes solvated with 1xPBS should be used within 48 hours.\n**Note 2:** If transporting solvated membranes \\(e.g. between buildings), remove all but ~1 mL of PBS to prevent membranes from flipping within the dish. \n**Note 3:** Alternatively, membranes can be solvated in 1xPBS, dried out, and stored for 4 weeks at room temperature. When ready to use membranes, they can be rehydrated with 1xPBS. This is helpful when traveling with membranes or when you want to run Seq-Well in a laboratory without access to a plasma cleaner.\n**Bead Loading**\n1. Aspirate storage solution and solvate array\\(s) with 5 mL of bead loading buffer \\(BLB; See **Appendix B: Buffers Guide**).\n  \n2. Place array\\(s) under vacuum with rotation \\(50 RPM) for 10-15 minutes to remove air bubbles in wells. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5115/original/Figure_8.jpg?1486505832\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n3. Aliquot ~110,000 beads from stock into a 1.5 mL tube and spin on a tabletop centrifuge for 10-15 seconds to form a pellet. \n  \n4. Aspirate storage buffer and wash beads once in 500 uL of BLB. \n  \n5. Pellet beads, aspirate BLB, and resuspend beads in 200 uL of BLB.",
    "**Note:** For each array, it’s recommended to load <sub>110,000 beads. For example, when running two arrays you would aliquot </sub>220,000 beads, wash, and resuspend in 400 uL of BLB.\n6. Before loading beads, thoroughly aspirate BLB from the dish containing the array\\(s), being careful not to aspirate or dry the PDMS surface of the array\\(s).\n  \n7. Use a 200 uL pipette to apply 200 uL containing 110,000 beads, in a drop-wise fashion, to the surface of each array \\(See image below and Bead Loading Diagrams). \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5117/original/Figure_9.png?1486505833\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n8. Place the loaded array\\(s) onto a rotator for 10 minutes \\(75 RPM). \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5119/original/Figure_10.png?1486505837\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n9. Thoroughly wash array\\(s) to remove excess beads from the surface. For each wash: \n  **a.** Position each array so that it sits in the center of the 4-well dish. \n**b.** Dispense 500 uL of BLB in the upper right corner of each array and 500 uL in the bottom right corner of each array. Be careful not to directly pipette onto the microwells, as it can dislodge beads.\n**c.** Using wafer forceps, push each array against the left side of the 4-well dish to create a capillary flow, which will help remove beads from the surface.\n**d.** Aspirate the liquid, reposition each array, and repeat on the opposite side.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5121/original/Figure_11.png?1486506381\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n10.  Repeat step 9 as necessary. Periodically examine the array\\(s) under microscope to verify that no loose beads are present on the surface, as this will interfere with membrane attachment. \n  \n11.  Once excess beads have been removed from the surface, solvate each array with 5 mL of BLB and proceed to cell loading. \n  \n**Notes:**",
    "- If continuing to cell loading immediately \\(i.e., within 1-5 hours), loaded arrays should be stored in 5 mL of BLB. \n- Loaded arrays can be stored for up to 72 hours in Array Quenching Buffer \\(See **Appendix B: Buffers Guide**). \n**Bead Loading Diagram**\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5123/original/Figure_12.png?1486506383\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Bead Washing Diagram**\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5125/original/Figure_13.png?1486506384\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Cell Loading**\n_Cell Loading \\(without imaging)_\n1. At this point, your array\\(s) should be loaded with beads and sitting in BLB.\n  \n2. Obtain a cell or tissue sample and prepare a single cell suspension using your preferred protocol.\n  \n3. While preparing your single cell suspension, aspirate the BLB from each array and soak it in 5 mL of RPMI + 10% FBS \\(RP-10) for 5 minutes.\n  \n4. After obtaining a single cell suspension, count cells using a hemocytometer and make a new solution of 10,000 cells in 200 uL of RP-10.\n  \n5. Aspirate the RP-10, center each array in well, and then load the cell loading solution in a dropwise fashion onto the surface of each array.\n  \n6. Intermittently rock the array\\(s) in the x & y direction for 5 minutes.\n  **Note:** To visualize membrane sealing or cell loading, pre-label cells with AF647- anti CD45 if leukocytes or another surface marker in AF647.\n7. Wash array\\(s) 4x with 5 mL of PBS to remove FBS in media – this is critical to ensure successful membrane attachment.\n  \n8. Aspirate final PBS wash and replace with 5 mL of RPMI media \\(no FBS).\n  \n_Cell Loading \\(with imaging)_\n1. When pre-imaging cells, cells should be loaded first as beads will obstruct view of many cells and bead autofluorescence can interfere with the signal.\n  \n2. Obtain a cell or tissue sample and prepare a single cell suspension using your preferred protocol.",
    "3. Count cells using a hemocytometer and resuspend 10,000 cells in 200 uL of cold CellCover \\(Anacyte).\n  \n4. Incubate cells at 4C for 1 hour.\n  \n5. After the cells have been fixed, perform antibody staining at 4C.\n  **Note:** Some epitopes may no longer be available as a result of the fixation process.\n6. Wash cells twice with 1xPBS, resuspend in 200 uL of CellCover10 buffer \\(pH 10 + 10% FBS; See **Appendix B: Buffers Guide**), and place on ice. \n  **Note:** CellCover \\!= CellCover10. \n7. Obtain empty functionalized array\\(s), aspirate storage solution and soak array\\(s) with 5 mL of CellCover10 buffer \\(See **Appendix B: Buffers Guide**).\n  \n8. Aspirate media and load fixed cells onto the array\\(s) in a dropwise format.\n  \n9. Gently rock the array\\(s) in the x & y direction for 5 minutes.\n  \n10. Wash array\\(s) twice with 5 mL of CellCover10 \\(pH 10 + 10% FBS), then solvate in 5 mL of CellCover \\(No FBS).\n  \n11. Place a lift slip on each array, then image with a microscope.\n  \n12. After imaging, wash each array in 5 mL of CellCover10 media.\n  \n13. Immediately load beads using the bead loading protocol provided above.\n  **Note:** In the protocol provided above, beads are washed and loaded in BLB. When loading cells first, replace BLB with CellCover10 for all steps. After beads are loaded and sufficiently washed, you will wash the array 4x with CellCover10 without FBS and solvate arrays in CellCover.\n14. Proceed with membrane sealing.\n  \n**Membrane Sealing**\n1. Gather the following materials before sealing the array\\(s): \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5127/original/Figure_14.png?1486506386\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n- Array\\(s) loaded with beads and cells \\(See Bead/Cell Loading) \n- Pre-treated membrane\\(s) \\(See Membrane Preparation) \n- Wafer forceps\n- Paper towels \n- Agilent clamps\n- Clean microscope slides",
    "2. Use the wafer forceps to transfer the array from media to the lid of a 4-well dish, being careful to keep the array as close to horizontal as possible. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5129/original/Figure_15.png?1486506390\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n \n3. Use the wafer forceps to remove a pre-treated membrane from the 4-well dish. \n  \n4. Gently dab away moisture from the glass slide on the paper towel until the membrane does not spontaneously change position on the glass slide. \n  \n5. Carefully position the membrane on the center of the microscope slide, leaving a small \\(2-3 mm) membrane overhang beyond the edge of the slide.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5131/original/Figure_16.png?1486506393\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n6. Holding the membrane in your left hand, invert the microscope slide so that the treated surface is facing down. \n  \n7. Place the overhang of the membrane in contact with the PDMS surface of the array just above the boundary of the microwells. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5133/original/Figure_17.png?1486506395\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n \n8. Using your right hand, firmly hold down the overhang of the membrane against the PDMS surface of the array. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5135/original/Figure_18.png?1486506397\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n9. **Critical Step:** While maintaining pressure with your right hand to hold the membrane in place, gently apply the membrane.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5137/original/Figure_19.png?1486506400\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Note 1:** For optimal results, use little to no pressure while applying the membrane with the left hand. See Instructional Video \\(www.shaleklab.com/seqwell) for additional details. \n**Note 2:** Attempts to manually seal the microwell device using pressure results in a ‘squeegee’ effect, effectively removing moisture from the membrane while fixing membrane creases in place.\n \n10.  After applying the membrane, carefully pry the array and membrane from the surface of the lid and transfer to an Agilent clamp.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5139/original/Figure_20.png?1486506842\">See figure in Figures section.</a>",
    "11.  Tighten clamp to the point of resistance and place in a 37C incubator for 30 minutes. \n  \n12. Repeat membrane sealing procedure if running multiple arrays.\n  \n**Membrane Sealing Notes:**\n- Video tutorial of membrane sealing is available at the following link: www.shaleklab.com/seqwell\n**Cell Lysis and Hybridization**\n1. Remove the clamp from the incubator, and then remove the array\\(s) from the Agilent clamp\\(s). \n  \n2. Submerge each array, with top slide still attached, in 5 mL of pre-lysis buffer \\(See **Appendix B: Buffers Guide**). \n  \n3. Gently rock the array\\(s) in pre-lysis buffer until the top glass slide lifts off. \n  **Note:** Do not pry the top slide off as this can reverse membrane sealing. The time necessary for detachment of the top slide varies \\(10 seconds – 5 minutes). Just be patient. \n4. Once the top slide has detached, aspirate the pre-lysis buffer and add 5 mL of complete lysis buffer to each array.\n  **Note 1:** Alternatively, 5 mL of complete lysis buffer can be prepared by adding 25 uL of 20% Sarkosyl and 50 uL of Beta-mercaptoethanol to pre-lysis buffer.  \n**Note 2:** Use a separate waste container for lysis buffer because guanidine thiocyanate can react with bleach in TC traps to create toxic gas. \n5. Rotate the array\\(s) for 20 minutes at 50-60 rpm. \n  \n6. Remove the lysis buffer and wash each array with 5 mL of hybridization buffer. \n  \n7. Aspirate hybridization buffer and add another 5 mL of hybridization buffer to each array and rotate for 40 minutes at 50-60 rpm. \n  \n8. While array\\(s) are rocking in hybridization buffer, prepare RT master mix. \\(See **Reverse Transcription and PCR**).\n  \n**Bead Removal**\n1. Aspirate hybridization buffer and replace with 5 mL of wash buffer. \n  \n2. Rock for 3 minutes. \n  \n3. Remove membrane with fine-tipped tweezers. \n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5141/original/Figure_21.png?1486506844\">See figure in Figures section.</a>",
    "4. Identify the orientation of a lifter slip so that the feet are facing upwards. \n  **Note:** Orientation can be determined in two ways: **\\(1)** Shown below – the feet of the lift slip are not reflective, while the glass backing has a continuous reflection; **\\(2)** The feet can be palpated beneath your finger. \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5143/original/Figure_22.png?1486506848\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n5.
