    "1. Cell Culture Preparation\nMDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nSeed 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in 92 mm diameter Petri dish in 10 ml complete medium containing Dulbeco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 10% horse serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% Penstrep-Amphotericine B. Allow cells to proliferate to about 80-100% confluence.\nRemove culture medium from dish and discard.\nWash the cell layer briefly with 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin-EDTA solution to remove all traces of serum.\nAdd 2.0 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution to dish and observe cells by inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed (usually within 5 to 15 min).\nAdd 18 ml complete growth medium and gently aspirate the cells by pipette. Transfer to a tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 1,200 rpm.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in 24 ml of culture medium.\nAdd 2 ml of cell suspension to 35 mm glass bottom dishes (about 25% confluence) and place in incubator (5% CO2 , 37 °C).\nSolutions:\nComplete Medium for cells proliferation: DMEM with 10%FBS, 1% Antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, Pen-Strep-Ampho solution) and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nTrypsin-EDTA solution, containing 0.25%Trypsin-EDTA.\nDishes:\n\t92 mm diameter Petri dishes.\n\t35 mm diameter poly-D-lysine coated glass bottom culture dishes.\n2. Preparation of Cells for Live Confocal Imaging\nSeed 2 x 105 MDA-MB-231 cells in glass bottom culture dishes in 2 ml complete medium as mentioned in section 1. When cell culture reaches confluence of 60-70% (about 3-4 x 105 cells per dish), proceed with transfection.",
    "Transfect the cells with two plasmids encoding the fusion proteins γ-Tubulin-GFP (for fluorescent detection of centrosomes) and Histone-RED (H2b-RED, for fluorescent detection of chromosomes) using the liposomal transfection reagent Jet-PI, following the manufacture protocol. Briefly, mix 2 μg from each plasmid in a tube with 100 μl NaCl (150 mM). Mix the transfection reagent (100 μl) with 100 μl NaCl (150 mM) in a second tube, and incubate 5 min at room temperature (RT). Then combine the two solutions, mix (using mild vortex) and spin-down. Incubate for 30 min at RT.\nDuring the incubation of the transfection mixture, wash the cells once with PBS and replace the cell medium with 2 ml of warm DMEM with no supplements (37 °C).\nGently add the transfection mixture to the cells in DMEM and then return the cells to the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 8 hr.\nAfter 8 hr of incubation, replace the DMEM with 2 ml complete medium and incubate the cells in the incubator for 24 hr.\n24 hr after transfection, replace the medium of the cells with 2 ml complete medium containing 20 μM PJ-34.\nIncubate the cells for additional 18 hr (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nSubject the cells to live confocal imaging for at least 16 hr in imaging chamber keeping the cells at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.\nIn parallel, examine transfection efficacy 36 hr post transfection using fluorescent microscopy as follow:\n\t\nSeed 2 x 105 MDA-MB-231 cells in 6-well plate containing 1 coverslip per well in 2 ml complete medium.\nTransfect the cells as mentioned in sections 2.2-2.5.\n36 hr post transfection fix the transfected cells mounted on a coverslip by incubation in cold methanol:acetone (1:1) solution, 7 min, -20 °C.",
    "Aspirate the fixation solution and let the coverslip with the mounted cells to dry in a chemical hood.\nApply ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI and let the coverslip to dry in the dark for 6 hr.\nExamine the slide under fluorescent microscope and calculate the percentage of the transfected cells (red and green signals) from the total population of cells (DNA staining by DAPI). The desired transfection percentage is about 20-40% when 100-200 cells are counted.\n3. Technical Parameters of the Live Confocal Imaging Scanner Settings\nScanMode XYZT; Pinhole [airy] 1.00; Zoom 3.5; Resolution 8 bits; Laser DPSS 561 nm; Argon, visible laser 488 nm; Laser He/Ne visible 633 nm; Objective HCX PL APO CS 63X 1.40 OIL UV; Numerical aperture 1.4; Scan speed 700 Hz; Refraction index 1.52.\n Image 3-D presentation were prepared by IMARIS imaging software 7.0.\n4. Confocal Imaging of Mitosis in Fixed Cells\nSeed 2 x 105 MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ATCC), normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), or PARP1 deficient MEF (PARP-/-, prepared by Dr Francoise Dantzer) on glass coverslips in 6-well plate in 2 ml complete medium. Coverslips were washed with 96% ethanol, following by wash with sterile DD water, dried for 2 hr, and placed in each well of 6-well dish.\nAdd PJ-34 (10-30 μM) to the medium and incubate the cells for the required period (usually up to 96 hr).\nWash the coverslips once with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and fix the cells using incubation in ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1) solution, 7 min, -20 °C.\nAspirate the fixation solution and let the coverslips to dry in chemical hood (at this stage, the coverslips can be kept in -20 °C for several weeks).",
    "Wash the coverslips once with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20) to permeabilize the cell membranes and block the cells with 10% NDS (Normal Donkey Serum) in PBST ('blocking solution') for 1 hr at RT.\nIncubate the permeabilized fixed cells with primary antibodies for 2 hr at RT (for spindles and centrosomes staining). The antibodies are diluted in the blocking solution as follow: anti-α tubulin (1:250 dilution) and anti-γ tubulin (1:200 dilution). Primary antibodies are applied as follows: apply 100 μl (in a drop) of a mixture of the antibodies in blocking solution for each coverslip on 6-well plate cover (the cover is upside down). Gently put the coverslip on the antibodies drop, seeded cells facing the drop. Incubate the coverslips facing the antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature.\nPlace the coverslips back in the wells and wash the cells 3 times with PBST. Then use the same procedure described in 4.6 for labeling cells on the coverslips with the fluorescent secondary antibodies. Incubate the cells on the coverslips with the secondary antibodies for 1 hr, RT, in the dark. The antibodies are diluted in the blocking solution as follow: Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000 dilution; green) and Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1,000 dilution; red).\nMount the coverslips using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (for chromosomes staining) and incubate overnight at RT in dark to dry.\nExamine the cover slips by confocal microscopy.\n5. Cell Viability Measured by ATP Production\nATP production is measured by a luminescent ATP detection assay kit.\nSeed the cells in 96-well plate, approximately 20,000 cells in 800 μl medium in each well. Three blank wells should be used for determination of the background luminescence of the medium.\nPrepare ATP standard dilution series from approximately 10 μM to 100 μM and keep on ice.",
    "Add 50 μl of detergent to each well and shake the plate for 5 min in orbital shaker, 700 rpm.\nReconstitute each vial of the' lyophilized substrate' with 5 ml of 'substrate buffer' in the kit.\nAdd 50 μl of the reconstituted substrate solution to the wells, and shake the plate for 5 min on orbital shaker, 700 rpm.\nKeep the plate in dark for 10 min.\nMeasure luminiscence of each well by ELISA microplate reader.\nSubscription Required.
