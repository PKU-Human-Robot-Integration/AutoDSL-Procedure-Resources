    "All rats were used according to protocols approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University.\n1. Surgical preparation, anesthetization, and surgical techniques\nNOTE: A total of 40 female Wistar rats, weighing 200–220 g, were commercially obtained for the present study. Of the 40 rats, 10 were randomly selected as the control group, and the rest were treated as the test group. All animals were housed in a sterile environment in the animal facilities of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University.\nPerform general anesthesia by administering sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally (40 mg/kg). Alternatively, induce anesthesia using 3%-4% isoflurane and maintain it at 1%-3% (inhaled). Apply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness. Then, place the rat on the surgical platform and provide thermal support. \n\tNOTE: Administer analgesics such as buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg, SC, 0.1-0.2 mL at the beginning of the procedure.\nCheck for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to the toe pinch. Shave the fur from the whole back area with a razor.\nSterilize the surgical site with at least 3 cycles of a two-stage scrub such as Chlorhexidine or Povidone iodine followed by Isopropyl alcohol. Secure the limbs with surgical tape and make a median incision of about 3 cm on the back with surgical scissors.\nDeepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissues using surgical scissors and cut off the muscles attached to the spine.\nVisually identify and expose the 13th rib (the intervertebral space connected to that rib is interval T13‒L1). Mark the 13th rib using a suture.\nAfter identification, carefully resect the muscles attached to the spine and expose the vertebral column. Resect the supraspinous ligament and interspinous ligament for an accurate identification of the vertebral column. Expose the level of L4‒L5 with surgical scissors and forceps.",
    "NOTE: The supraspinous ligament can be identified easily because of the presence of thin subcutaneous tissue. After the resection of supraspinous ligament, the ligament between spinous process is interspinous ligament.\nCarefully dissect away the L4‒L5 vertebral spinous process and parts of the transverse process using Kelly forceps to expose the spinal cord (Figure 1).\nCompletely expose the conus medullaris at the L4‒L5 level and transect the conus medullaris totally with iridectomy scissors. Insert some tissue packing to block the recovery of the spinal cord.\nClose the overlying muscle and skin on the outer skin layer using 4-0 non-absorbable suture.\nFor the control group, perform steps 1.1‒1.7, and leave the conus medullaris intact. Close the incision according to step 1.9.\n2. Animal recovery\nKeep the rats in a temperature-controlled incubator (37 °C) during the first hour post-operation and monitor them until they are sternal or actively moving.\n\tNOTE: It takes about half an hour for total recovery.\nTransfer the animal to a clean cage with sufficient food and water. Keep the rats in separate cages.\n\tNOTE: The transection's success is indicated when the rats in the test group move only with the help of forelegs, whereas the rats in the control group could walk normally.\n3. Post-operation management\nInject Penicillin G, an antibiotic (50,000 U/mL per animal) intraperitoneally. Administer analgesics such as buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg, SC, 0.1-0.2 mL every 6-12 hr for 48 hr post-operation.\nCompress the urinary bladder at the hypogastrium to help with the voiding. Perform this twice daily at the same time (8 am and 8 pm) for six weeks.\n\tNOTE: The loss of normal constriction of detrusor is the symbol of DU.\nHouse all rats in metabolic cages, each containing a urine collection funnel placed over a previously weighed absorbent paper to monitor the micturition and incontinence.",
    "Collect and note the weight change of absorbent paper, which indicates the voided volume (VV), and the residual urine volume separately.\n4. Urodynamic testing\nAt six-weeks post-operation, perform a cystometrogram, using urodynamic measurement equipment as follows.\n\t\nAnesthetize rats by injecting 10% chloral hydrate into the peritoneal cavity (3 mL/kg).\nCompress the bladder for voiding, then fix the rat to the surgical platform using a tape.\nInsert the epidural catheter (3F) into the bladder and connect the urodynamic measurement equipment, epidural catheter, and infusion pump by the three-limb tube.\nPump physiological saline at a speed of 0.2 mL/min for urodynamic measurement (see Table of Materials). Record the MCC and DOP, and compliance of the bladder (calculated by dividing δ bladder volume with δ pressure of the detrusor).\n5. Statistical analysis\nPerform statistical analysis using commercially available software.\nUse Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to test the normality of data.\nExpress the normally distributed variables as mean values with standard deviations. Use the two-tailed paired Student’s t-tests to compare the parameters of cystometrogram in both groups.\n\tNOTE: p < 0.05 indicates that the difference had statistical significance.\nSubscription Required.
