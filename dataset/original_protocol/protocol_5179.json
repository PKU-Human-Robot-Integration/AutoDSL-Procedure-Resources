    "Day 1Prepare the following two cell cultures5 ml DT40 (TopBP1YFP/+/+) cell culture with a cell density of 0.7 million per ml  DT40 cells medium (RPMI 1640 medium GlutaMAX supplemented with 2% chicken serum, 8% FBS, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin) + DMSO (solvent control, diluted similar to aphidicolin).5 ml DT40 (TopBP1YFP/+/+) cell culture with a cell density of 0.7 million per ml DT40 cells medium + 0.5 µM aphidicolin (aphidicolin from 4 mM stock is diluted in culture medium).Incubate for 16 h at 39 °C in a CO2 incubator with 5% CO2.Day 2Add colcemid to 0.1 µg/ml final concentration to the 5 ml cell culture in each of the flasks and incubate for 150 min in the CO2 incubator. Harvest the culture with 5 ml of colcemid-treated cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 201 x g in 15 ml tubes.Discard the supernatants and gently vortex the cell pellet to resuspend it in the remaining liquid.Vortex the tube at very low intensity and add drop by drop 1 ml ice cold hypotonic buffer. Add drop by drop another 1 ml ice cold hypotonic buffer (no need to vortex).Incubate for 15 min on ice.Meanwhile label cytospin slides and carefully place them in the cytofunnel according to manufacturers’ protocol. See Figure 1 for image of the cytofunnel.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426231335_9960.jpgFigure 1. Image showing the cytofunnel. Top arrow indicates the site of loading into the funnel. Bottom arrow indicates the flow direction of the cell suspension toward the slide, which is indicated as a blue line. This takes place during centrifugation with the result that cells are spun onto the slide at the site of the red X.",
    "After the 15 min incubation, transfer 400 μl of the cell suspension from step B5 to the cytofunnel and spin it in a cytospin centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm corresponding to 113 x g.Take the slide out of the cytofunnel.To fix the sample on the slide, carefully add 100 μl paraformaldehyde solution to the marked area on the slide and leave for 10 min in the fume hood (the paraformaldehyde should stay as a droplet on the slide).Immerse slides in a Coplin jar with 35 ml KCM buffer for 10 min.Pour out the KCM buffer (hold the slides in place) and then add 35 ml of PBS to the Coplin jar with the slides.Pour out the PBS (hold the slides in place) and then add 35 ml of PBS to the Coplin jar with the slides once again. Note: At this stage you may store the Coplin jar with slides in PBS in the fridge until next day.After at least 5 min, take out the slides and drain them well. Note: Slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle.Add 30 μl blocking solution to the area within the circle and cover with coverslip.Leave for 30 min at room temperature and then very carefully remove the coverslip. (Most of the blocking solution is removed along with the coverslip.)Add 20 μl primary anti-GFP antibody solution to the area within the circle, and cover with a coverslip.Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 25 min. Remove the coverslip carefully and wash 2 times, for 3 min each time in PBS-T in a Coplin jar.Drain (slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle) and add 20 μl Alexa-488 secondary antibody working solution to the area within the circle.",
    "Then cover the area within the circle with a coverslip.Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 30 min (protected from light).Remove coverslip carefully and wash 2 times for 3 min each time in PBS-T (35 ml) in a Coplin jar.Drain (slides should be dry, except from the area within the circle) and mount round coverslip onto glass slide with 6 μl DAPI-mounting buffer. Seal with a thin layer of nail polish at the edge of the coverslip. See Figure 2 for image of the slide.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426231609_2196.jpgFigure 2. Image of the cytospin slide. The sample is within the white circle. A round coverslip covers the area within the circle and nail polish is used to seal the coverslip along the edges/the white circle.When the nail polish is dry, store the slides in a slide storage box in the fridge or proceed directly to microscopic analyses of the slides. Notes: Fluorophores may be visualized under a wide-field microscope (DeltaVision Elite; Applied Precision) equipped with a 100x objective lens (U-PLAN S-APO, NA 1.4; Olympus), a cooled EM CCD camera (Evolve 512; Photometrics), and a solid-state illumination source (Insight; Applied Precision) or similar fluorescence microscope.Images can be acquired using softWoRx (Applied Precision) software or similar."
