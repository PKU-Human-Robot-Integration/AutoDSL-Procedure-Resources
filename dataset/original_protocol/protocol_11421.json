    "This study has been approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Ningbo University (ARGH20150356). All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion in the study, and they were informed of the goal, requirements, and experimental procedures of the study.\n1. Gait Laboratory Preparation\nSwitch off any incandescent lights and leave a reasonable fluorescent lighting level in the laboratory. Remove all markers and unwanted objects of reflection that may be misinterpreted as passive retro-reflective markers from the capture volume.\nPlug the appropriate dongle into the parallel port of the computer. Turn on the motion-capture cameras, proprietary tracking software, force platform amplifiers, and external analog-to-digital converter (ADC).\nAllow time for the 8 cameras to initialize. Click the \"Local System\" node on the \"System\" tab of the \"Resources\" pane. In the \"Properties\" pane of the \"Local System\" node, type \"100\" into the \"Requested Frame Rate\" property in the \"System\" section to set sample rate at 100 Hz.\nSelect \"Camera\" from the view list in the \"View\" pane. Place the T-frame, which consists of 5 markers located a fixed distance from each other, on the force platform.\nIn the \"System Resources\" tree, expand the \"Cameras\" node and press and hold the CTRL key while clicking each camera listed in the node. In the \"Properties\" pane of the \"Cameras\" node, move the \"Strobe Intensity\" bar in the \"Settings\" section to the left or right for each camera to ensure that data from each camera is completely, clearly, and steadily visible in the \"View\" pane.",
    "Click the \"System Preparation\" button in the \"Tool\" pane. Click the \"Start\" button in the \"Calibrate Cameras\" section and thenphysically wave the calibration wand (T-frame) in the capture volume in a vertical figure eight whilst moving around the area intended for the capture of 3D data. Stop waving when the blue status lights on the front of the cameras stop flashing.\nIn the \"Cameras Calibration Feedback\" section in the \"Tool\" pane, monitor the progress bar until the camera calibration process is complete. Review the \"Image Error\" data; the acceptable image error of each camera should be less than 0.3.\nPlace the T-frame on the floor, with the central marker on the top-left corner of the force platform (60 cm × 90 cm) and the axes of the frame along the edges of the force platform. Ensure that the long axis of the frame points in the travel direction (anterior direction).\nSelect \"3D Perspective\" from the view list in the \"View\" pane. In the \"Set Volume Origin\" section, click the start button and click the \"Set Origin\" button to set the origin of the capture volume.\nAsk a subject to step onto the force platform. Verify that the direction of the ground reaction vector displayed in the view pane is upward and that the magnitude of the vertical force component is equal to the body mass x 9.81. Ask the subject to walk away from the force platform.",
    "In the \"System Resources\" tree, right-click on the \"Force Platform\" node and select \"Zero Level\" from the \"Context\" menu to calibrate the force platform. Click the \"Connectivity\" node on the \"System\" tab in the \"Resources\" pane. In the \"Properties\" pane of the \"Connectivity\" node, type \"1,000\" into the \"Requested Frame Rate\" property in the \"Settings\" section to set the sample rate at 1,000 Hz.\nPrepare 16 passive retro-reflective markers (diameter: 14 mm) by pre-attaching them individually to one side of double-sided adhesive tape.\n2. Subject Preparation\nOrganize the results of the survey about high-heel shoe-wearing experience, including frequency, duration, heel types, and heel heights, which should be given to each volunteer.\n\tNOTE: Questions in the survey: (i) How often do you wear your high-heeled shoes? (ii) How many h/min do you wear your high-heeled shoes each time? (iii) What kind of high-heeled shoes do you usually wear? Wedge heel or stiletto heel? (iv) How high is the shoe that you usually wear? Here, 36 young females volunteered to participate in this test, but 14 of them were excluded for assorted reasons: feeling uncomfortable with the experimental shoe (4), hallux valgus (3), only having wedge-heel experience (3), abnormal gait in the experimental environment (2), and absence on the testing day (2).\nObtain written informed consent from subject who fulfill the inclusion criteria.",
    "NOTE: The inclusion criteria are as follows: no musculoskeletal disorders that might affect normal jogging and running gait; feeling comfortable with the experimental shoe offered; right-foot dominant; and size 37 (EUR) EW (age: 24.2 ± 1.2 years; height: 160 ± 2.2 cm; mass: 51.6 ± 2.6 kg) wear shoes with narrow heels 3-6 cm-high for a minimum of three days per week (6 h per day) for at least two years, while IEW (age: 23.7 ± 1.3 years; height: 162.3 ± 2.3 cm; mass: 52.6 ± 4.5 kg) wear high-heeled shoes less than twice per month.\nAsk the subjects to change into tight-fitting pants and a t-shirt.\nMeasure subjects' standing height (mm) and body mass (kg). Measure the leg length (i.e., the distance between the superior iliac spine and the ankle internal condyle, in mm), knee width (i.e., the distance between the medial and lateral knee condyle, in mm) and ankle width (i.e., the distance between the medial and lateral ankle condyle, in mm) using measuring calipers.\nPrepare skin areas of anatomical bony landmarks for marker placement.\nShave body hair as appropriate and use alcohol wipes to remove excess sweat and moisturizer.\n\t\tNOTE: The marker locations include: anterior-superior iliac spine (LASI/RASI), posterior-superior iliac spine (LPSI/RPSI), lateral mid-thigh (LTHI/RTHI), lateral knee condyle (LKNE/RKNE), lateral mid-shank (LTIB/RTIB), lateral malleolus (LANK/RANK), second metatarsal head (LTOE/RTOE), and calcaneus (LHEE/RHEE), where the L and R prefixes indicate the left and ride legs, respectively.\nPalpate to identify anatomical landmark. Circle each landmark on the skin using a marking pen. Attach the 16 passive retro-reflective markers on the landmarks of both sides of the lower limbs with double-sided adhesive tape.",
    "Ask the subjects to change into the experimental shoe (heel height: 4.5 cm) and then walk, jog, and run freely along the runway until they are physiologically and psychologically comfortable with the cameras and markers on their lower limbs (i.e., no influence on the participants) and they feel like they are walking, jogging, and running naturally.\nAsk the subjects to practice jogging along the runway at a comfortable low speed until they are able to jog steadily. Instruct the subjects to perform some progressive training (e.g., making an effort to jog at a progressively increasing speed on a treadmill within a safe and comfortable range).\nAsk them to practice running on the ground along the runway at a comfortable high speed until they are able to run steadily at this speed.\nInstruct the subjects to try to start jogging/running from different starting lines within the starting area several times to find an appropriate starting position, ensuring that the right foot naturally strikes and completely contacts the force platform when passing by.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55714/55714fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental protocol. 8 infrared cameras capture lower-limb motion while the subject jogs and runs along the runway. The right foot naturally strikes and completely contacts the force platform when passing by. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected synchronically.

    "Click the \"New Database\" button in the toolbar to create a new database. Click the \"Data Management\" button in the toolbar to open the \"Data Management\" pane. In the \"Data Management\" pane, click the \"New Patient Classification,\" \"New Patient,\" and \"New Session\" buttons, in order. Return to the \"Resources\" pane, click the \"Create a new subject\" button to create a new subject, and enter the values for all anthropometric measurements (e.g., height, weight, leg length, knee width, and ankle width) in the \"Properties\" pane for the newly created subject.\nClick the \"Go Live\" button in the \"Resources pane.\" Click the \"Split horizontally\" button in the \"View\" pane and select \"Graph\" in the view list in the new \"View\" pane. Select \"Trajectory Count\" in the \"Model Output\" pulldown list.\nConfirm that the count of markers in the \"Graph\" view pane is 16 and that the same number of markers is visible in the \"3D Perspective\" view pane, meaning that no markers on the lower limb have failed to be captured.\nClick the \"Subject Preparation\" button in the \"Tool\" pane.\nAsk the subject to stand in a stationary neutral pose in the center of the capture volume to capture the static data.\nClick the \"Start\" button in the subject capture section, capture approximate 150 frames, and click the \"Stop\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Start\" button switches to \"Stop\" automatically after clicking it.\nClick the \"Reconstruct\" button in the toolbar to display the captured markers. Click the \"Label\" button in the \"Tool\" pane and manually assign the labels (16 in total) listed in the \"Manual Labeling\" section to the corresponding markers in the \"3D Perspective\" view pane. Press the \"Esc\" key on the keyboard to exit.",
    "Select \"Static\" in the \"Pipeline\" pulldown list in the \"Subject Calibration\" section. Check the \"Left Foot\" and \"Right Foot\" options in the \"Static Settings\" pane. Click the \"Start\" button in the \"Subject Calibration\" section.\n4. Dynamic Trials\nAsk the subject to stand at the appropriate starting position.\nClick the \"Go Live\" button in the \"Resources\" pane. Click the \"Capture\" button in the \"Tool\" pane. Edit the \"Trial Name\" in the \"Next Trial Setup\" section.\nClick the \"Start\" button in the \"Capture\" section to begin capturing and then immediately give the subject the oral instruction to \"Go jogging/Go running.\" Ensure that the right foot naturally strikes and completely contacts the force platform when passing by ( Figure 1).\nFor jogging trials, ask the subjects to jog at the comfortable low speed that they were familiar with during preparation; for running trials, ask the subjects to run at the comfortable high speed that they had been familiar with during preparation. Allow for a 2-min rest between two trials.\nCapture at least 3 complete successive steps, including the step on the force platform.\n\t\tNOTE: Jogging and running trials are performed randomly. For each speed, ask the subjects to repeat 5 trials. Cancel the capture in the event of a marker moving/falling or if abnormal gait occurs. In the event of markers moving/falling, re-attach to the predetermined skin mark.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55714/55714fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: User interface for dynamic data collection.

See Figure 2.\n\tNOTE: The \"Start\" button in the \"Capture\" section switches to \"Stop\" automatically after clicking it.\n5. Post-processing using Proprietary Tracking Software",
    "Click the \"Data Management\" button in the toolbar. In the \"Data Management\" pane, double-click the trial name. Click the \"Reconstruct\" and \"Label\" buttons in the toolbar to reconstruct the 3D dynamic model and to obtain the filmed data.\nOn the time bar, move the left-range indicator (blue triangle) on the timeline to the frame at which the right foot strikes the force platform. Select this frame according to the instant when the vertical force vector in the view pane arises.\nMove the right-range indicator (blue triangle) on the timeline to the frame at which the next heel-strike event of the right foot occurs.\n\t\tNOTE: The selection of this frame depends on the elaborative subjective estimate of the researchers according to the instant when there is no superior-inferior displacement of the right heel marker.\nRight-click on the time bar and select \"Zoom to Region-of-Interest\" from the \"Context\" menu to define the desired frames.\nClick the \"Label\" button in the \"Tool\" pane. In the \"Gap Filling\" section, click on the markers whose trajectories contain gaps listed in the \"Trajectory\" column and then click the \"Fill\" button of the \"Spline Fill\" tool.\n\tNOTE: The number of gaps are listed in the \"#Gaps\" column. Clicking on the \"Fill\" button of the \"Spline Fill\" tool fills one gap. The \"Spline Fill\" method can generally be used for gap instances less than or equal to 60 frames.\nClick the \"Pipeline\" button in the \"Tool\" pane. Select \"Dynamic\" from the \"Current Pipeline\" list. Move the indicator (blue slider) along the timeline to the last frame. Click the \"Run\" button to start the pipeline process and export dynamic trials in.csv format for post-processing in the data analysis software.\n6. Data Analysis",
    "Low-pass filter the kinematic and kinetic data using 4th-order Butterworth filters with cut-off frequencies at 10 Hz and 25 Hz, respectively13 (see the Table of Materials).\nDivide the anterior-superior displacement of the marker on the right anterior superior iliac spine by the corresponding time to calculate the jogging/running speed.\nDefine the anterior-posterior displacement of the marker on right heel between the successive heel-strike events as the stride length. Define the reciprocal of the duration of the gait cycle as the stride frequency.\nDefine the difference between the peak angle and valley angle during the stance phase as the joint range of motion (ROM).\nCalculate the vertical average loading rate by defining the slope of the vertical GRF-time curve from 20-80% of the stance time from initial contact to impact force14.\n\tNOTE: Define the initial contact as the instant when the vertical GRF consistently measured more than 0 N.\nNormalize the vertical GRF to bodyweight (BW%).\nFirst average the 5 trials from each subject and then average these results for all subjects.\n\tNOTE: The parameters include jogging and running speed, stride length, stride frequency, joint (i.e., ankle, knee and hip) 3D (ROM) and peak angle during stance phase, angle at heel-strike in the sagittal plane, impact force (Fi), peak force (Fp), and vertical average loading rate (VALR).\nTransfer the data to a statistical software for statistical analysis.\n7. Statistical Analysis\nPerform two separate independent samples t-tests to assess the effects of wearing experience. Perform two separate paired-samples t-tests to assess the effects of running speed on lower-limb kinematics and GRF. Consider statistical results as significant if p <0.05.\nSubscription Required.
