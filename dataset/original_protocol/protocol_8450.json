    "The animals were maintained in accordance with the established standards of animal care and procedures of the Institutes of Brain Science and State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\n1. Solution Preparation\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials.\nPrepare the slicing buffer (modified Gey's solution): 92 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, 3 mM Na+-pyruvate, 10 mM MgSO4, and 0.5 mM CaCl2.\nAdjust the pH to 7.6 using 1 M NaOH without carbogenation.\nStore the buffer at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The titration clarifies the cloudy liquid. The osmolality is 305-310 mOsm. The carbogen21 contains 5% carbon dioxide and 95% oxygen.\nPrepare the aCSF by diluting a 10x stock solution of aCSF that does not contain bicarbonate and glucose, giving a final composition of: 124 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1.25 mM KH2PO4.\nAdd bicarbonate and glucose to reach 10 mM glucose and 26 mM NaHCO3.\nCarbogenate the aCSF through a perforated silicon tube with a blocked end immediately after adding the NaHCO3.\nMeasure the pH while carbogenating (pH 7.3-7.4).\n\tNOTE: The buffer capacity can be adjusted slightly by altering the amount of NaHCO3. Since the resulting pH is temperature-dependent, it is necessary to check the resulting pH while carbogenating at the working temperature (e.g., 30 °C).\n2. Preparation of Acute Hippocampal Slices\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials.\nPlace a slice-holding mesh into an incubation chamber for acute brain slices, fill the chamber with aCSF, and carbogenate (4-6 L/h) for at least 30 min22 at 28-30 °C.\nCool the surgical instruments down to 2-4 °C.\nPlace a glass beaker filled with cold and carbogenated slicing buffer (2-4 °C), maintained in an ice/water mixture, near the vibratome.",
    "Anesthetize rats or mice until the corneal reflexes disappear (30-50 s) using isoflurane by taking 500 µL into a 2 L glass jar or 12.5 µL into a 50 mL tube.\nIsolate the brain using a method described and visualized in detail in the publications of Mathis et al. (2011)23 and Yuanxiang et al. (2014)24.\nCool the brain down to 2-4 °C in an ice-cold slicing buffer (for at least 2 min) before dissecting the cerebellum and separating the hemispheres.\nUse a cold surgical blade to dissect a piece of the dorsal cortex at a 70° angle along the dorsal edge of each hemisphere25 to get transverse slices from the ventral and the intermediate part of the hippocampus, as shown in Figure 1C and E.\nWith a cold dental cement spatula, transfer a hemisphere to a piece of filter paper to briefly dry the created surface (1-2 s).\nMount the two hemispheres with freshly cut surfaces on the ice-cold slicing platform using fast-acting adhesive glue; have the caudal end of the hemispheres face the razor blade (Figure 1D).\nPlace the slicing platform into the cooling chamber of a vibratome and fill that chamber with the slicing buffer (2-4 °C). Carbogenate using a perforated silicon tube.\nCut 350 µm slices using adequate vibratome settings (e.g., blade forward speed: 1.2 mm/s, blade amplitude: 1 mm).\nIsolate the hippocampal formation from the subiculum and the entorhinal cortices using two injection cannulas (>28 G) as scissors.\nRemove the bubbles from the slice-holding mesh of the previously prepared incubation chamber using a Pasteur pipette.\nTransfer the slices that have some transparency at the stratum pyramidale from the slicing platform on the mesh of the incubation chamber. Avoid any folding, stretching, overlapping, and floating by aspirating aCSF and the slice into a large-mouth Pasteur pipette.",
    "NOTE: The whole procedure (step 2.5-2.14) can take 5-10 min; therefore, it is important to check the temperature of the buffer solution over time to maintain it at 4 °C.\nIncubate the slices at 30 °C for at least 1.5-2 h in the incubation chamber and provide carbogen at 4-6 L/h.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the flow rate of the carbogen to circulate the buffer in the incubator, but prevent the slices from floating.\n3. Modifications of the Carbogenation for the aCSF Recycling of Small Reservoirs\nAdd a 3-way tube connector to the outflow of the recycling system (Figure 2B).\nConnect the middle arm of the 3-way tube connector with a carbogen supply tube and regulate the flow rate with an airflow meter (3-4 L/h, Figure 2D and Figure 4C).\nAdd a second 3-way tube connector to the inflow of the recycling system. Connect the middle arm to the tube facing the inline heater, the upper arm to a thin silicon tube (10 cm length), and the lower arm to the inflow tube from the reservoir (low-pass filter; Figure 4C).\nPlace a tube squeezer on a thin silicon tube (OD: 2 mm) at a position along the tube where the pulsation of the aCSF in the slice chamber, generated by the peristaltic pump, is at its minimum.\n\tNOTE: The outflow-carbogenation (outflow-carb.) modification reduces the sensitivity of the carbogenation level to the volume of the aCSF reservoir, the aCSF recycling rate, and relative tube positions within small aCSF reservoirs (<50 mL; Figure 3). Regarding the low-pass filter, a certain amount of air in the thin silicon tube reduces the pulsation of the aCSF flow; thus, the tube should be filled mostly with air.\n4. Recording Synaptic Responses in a Submersion Slice Chamber\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials.",
    "Pre-warm the aCSF solution in a water bath to about 28-30 °C (this will prevent bubble formation in the recording chamber).\nStart the recycling system (4-5 mL/min) and activate the inline heater to equilibrate the system for at least 1 h.\nPresoak a small piece of lens cleaning paper and a nylon mesh fixed on a U-shaped platinum wire in the submersion slice chamber for a few minutes (Figure 4).\nRemove the U-shaped platinum wire.\nSwitch off the recycling and place a slice on the lens cleaning paper.\nImmediately place the slice-holding mesh on top of the slice, switch on the pump, and let the slice equilibrate for 30 min without dipping the objective into the aCSF.\nFill the borosilicate micropipette (i.e., the recording electrode) with aCSF (tip resistance: 1-2 MΩ, filled 1/3 with aCSF) and mount it into the pipette holder.\nCheck the insulation of the metal stimulation electrode by placing it into NaHCO3 solution (>40 mM). Connect the electrode to the negative pole of a DC voltage generator (1-2 V, positive pole: silver or platinum wire), and observe the formation of bubbles at the tip under a dissection microscope (>60x magnification).\nPlace the tested epoxy-insulated tungsten stimulation electrode in the manipulator holder and the reference wires in the slice chamber.\nAdd a second reference electrode to the chamber and connect it to the reference socket of the headstage of the recording electrode (Figure 4A).\nIn the amplifier control software, click on the \"zero clamp mode\" box and proceed by double-clicking the \"output gain list\" box. Choose a gain of \"100,\" double-click the \"high pass filter list box (Bessel),\" choose \"0.1 Hz,\" and double-click the \"low pass filter list box (AC)\" to choose \"3 kHz.\"",
    "In the recording software, click the on \"Acquire | Open Protocol.\" Choose a protocol that has settings allowing for episodic stimulations and the digitalization of amplified potentials at 10-20 kHz for 50-100 ms and that automatically triggers a stimulus isolator 10 ms after the start of an episodic recording.\nPlace the stimulation and recording electrodes in line and parallel to the stratum pyramidale, for example (Figure 4B and Figure 5).\nClick \"Acquire | Edit Protocol\" and choose the \"trigger\" tab (in the pop-up window). Click on the \"trigger source\" box and chose \"space bar\" as the trigger source. Click the \"OK\" button. Click the \"record\" button to start the acquisition and note the pop-up window with a trigger button.\nIn the stimulus isolator software, click on the \"voltage control\" box and enter \"0.\" Click the \"download\" button. Click on the \"recording software\" window and press the space bar. Repeat this cycle by sequentially entering values from 1 to 8, for example, at 1 mV steps in the \"voltage control\" box.\nCorrelate the stimulation strength with fEPSP-slope values and determine the stimulation strength required to get 40% of the fEPSP-slope maximum. Click the \"voltage control box\" and enter the determined value. Click the \"download\" button.\n\tNOTE: A stimulus isolator is used to apply brief voltage or current pulses to brain tissue. The biphasic pulses can have 100 µs per phase.\nIn the recording software, click the stop button and then the \"Acquire\" menu. Click on \"Edit Protocol\" and choose the \"trigger\" tab in the pop-up window. Click on the trigger source box and chose the \"internal timer\" as the trigger source. Click the \"OK\" button. Click the record button that starts the automatic recording of field potentials every 30 s, for example. Click the \"stop\" button after 30-60 min.",
    "Click on the \"Acquire\" menu, click on \"Open Protocol,\" choose the desired induction protocol of synaptic plasticity, and click the \"OK\" button. Click the \"record\" button to automatically activate the high-frequency stimulation and recording. Click the \"stop\" button.\n\tNOTE: In case of studies relating to synaptic plasticity, apply one of the standard induction paradigms for long-term potentiation or long-term depression after prolonged baseline recording. Representative examples of the resulting modulation of the synaptic transmission are depicted in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\nIn the recording software, click \"Acquire | Open Protocol\" and choose the same protocol as in step 4.12. Click the \"OK\" button and then click \"record.\" Keep automatically running the field potential recordings for 2-4 h, for example. Click the \"stop\" button to terminate the recording.\nIn case of pharmaceutical studies, apply the compound directly to the aCSF reservoir if permanent compound administration is desired (Figure 6).\n5. Cleaning the Setup and Hints\nNOTE: See below for general tips.\nClean the system weekly by recycling 10% H2O2 for no more than 20 min, followed by washing with deionized H2O.\n\tNOTE: Ethanol is not recommended for cleaning. It is likewise not recommended to immerse the reference wires and objective in H2O2.\nRemove precipitated salt on the surface of the objective lens or chamber surroundings with 0.1 N HCl and then water.\nWash the carbogen bubbler in distilled water or 0.1 N HCl.\nImmerse the slice incubation chamber in 10% H2O2 for 5 min once a week and then thoroughly rinse the incubation chamber with deionized H2O.\nIn case of metal stimulation electrodes, rinse the stimulating electrode tip with deionized water after each experiment and gently wipe the stimulating electrode tip with a cotton ball soaked with ethanol to remove residual tissue.",
    "Reduce the resistance of commercial metal stimulation electrodes by removing the insulation at the tip through a careful swipe with sandpaper.\nReduce the loss of carbogen from the aCSF while recycling through the tubes by replacing the silicon tubes with polytetrafluoroethylene tubes.\nKeep the silver wires of the recording electrode and reference electrode in bleach for several days to form AgCl on the wire surface.\nSubscription Required.
