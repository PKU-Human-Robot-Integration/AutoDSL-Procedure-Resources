    "All animal experiments must be carried out in accordance with local and national regulations on animal experimentation and with approval of the relevant institutional review board.\n1. Preparing the CAS9-gRNA RNP mix\nDesign and synthesize gRNAs.\n\tNOTE: Refer to other publications for designing and synthesizing gRNAs, including one exclusively concerning axolotls15,20,21,22.\nObtain CAS9-NLS protein by preparing in-house or purchasing it commercially.\nPrepare CAS9-gRNA mix by mixing 5 µg of CAS9-NLS protein, 4 µg of gRNA, 0.9 µL of 10x CAS9 buffer, and fill up the volume to 10 µL with nuclease-free H2O. Aliquot the mixture and store at -80 °C if not used immediately.\n2. Preparing agarose plates for electroporation\nPrepare 200 mL of 2% (wt/vol) agarose solution in 1x DPBS. Dissolve by heating the solution in a microwave and pour it onto 10 cm Petri dishes to a depth of about 10 mm (deep enough to cover the whole animal).\nAllow the plates to solidify at room temperature. Store plates at 4 °C if not used immediately.\nUsing surgical scalpels, cut the agarose plate to make a slit for holding the tail straight, a well for fitting in the body of the animal, and two extra wells for placing the electrodes (Figure 1E).\nPlace the plate on ice and fill it up to the brim with ice-cold 1x DPBS. Use the same DPBS solution for making the plates to ensure consistent electrical conductibility in the set-up.\n3. Configuring the electroporator\nConfigure the electroporator. Set up the poring pulse to consist of one bipolar pulse of 70 V, with a duration of 5 ms, interval of 50 ms, and no voltage decay. Set up the transfer pulse to have four bipolar pulses of 40 V, with a duration of 50 ms, interval of 999 ms, and 10% voltage decay.",
    "Connect the electrodes to the electroporator and adjust the tweezers to be 7 mm apart. Submerge the electrodes in a beaker of DPBS before and in between electroporation.\n4. Preparing and loading microinjection glass capillaries\nPerform a ramp test on a flaming/brown micropipette puller as per the manufacturer’s instructions to determine the heat value.\nPull injection capillaries with tapered ends using the following parameters: heat = ramp test value, pull = 100, velocity = 100, time = 100.\nObserve the needle under a stereomicroscope. Using fine forceps, break the capillary at an angle so that it has a slanted tip. Break at a position where it is thin enough to target the central canal, while being strong enough to pierce the skin.\n\tNOTE: The point at which the diameter is at about 20 µm or about 50% of the diameter of the spinal cord is a good starting point. Multiple tries may be needed to obtain optimal breaking.\nAdd Fast Green FCF solution to the RNP mix at a ratio of 1:30 and load about 5 µL of injection mix into the capillary with a Microloader pipette tip.\nMount the capillary on the pneumatic pump, with the slanted tip facing downwards.\n5. Configuring the pneumatic pump\nConfigure the pneumatic pump. Set the hold to 0.5 pounds per square inch (psi), eject to 2 psi hold, and duration to gated.\nTest capillary and pneumatic pump settings by dipping the capillary into a drop of water and pressing the foot pedal to inject. Ensure that the injection mix comes out in a slow but steady stream.",
    "Adjust the hold pressure if the injection mix start leaking out spontaneously or water is sucked up the capillary. Increase the ejection pressure or break more of the capillary if the injection mix is coming out too slow. Decrease the ejection pressure if the injection is coming out too fast.\n6. Injecting RNP mix into the spinal cord\nAnesthetize axolotls in 0.03% benzocaine solution for at least 10 min. Check that the animals are not responsive by flipping them upside down in the water.\nPick up an animal with ring forceps and lay it on a bed of silicon, with the left side of the animal facing up and the tail pointing towards the right. Position the injection site in the middle of the field of view of the stereomicroscope (Figure 1A).\nAdjust the micromanipulator so that the capillary is coming in at 60° from the right side of the field of view (Figure 1B).\nIdentify the spinal cord and central canal (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: The spinal cord is the tubular structure above the notochord.\nAiming at the central canal, move the capillary forward to gently pierce the skin and muscle into the central canal of the spinal cord. Limit the movement of the capillary to small steps, as the spinal cord is right beneath the tail muscles.\nPress and hold down the foot pedal to inject the mix into the central canal. Observe whether the RNP mix spreads along the central canal as a blue line in both directions, which shows that the capillary has been correctly positioned (Figure 1D).",
    "If this does not occur, keep the foot pedal pressed while moving the capillary slightly in and out until the RNP mix starts going in. If the capillary becomes clogged by tissue, clear it by ejecting into water at higher pressures.\nAdjust the ejection pressure so that it is just enough to cause the RNP mix to spread in the central canal, but not so much that it blows up the structure.\nContinue to hold down the foot pedal so the injection mix spreads further along the central canal, until it reaches the terminal vesicle at the end of the spinal cord and ventricles in the brain.\n\tNOTE: This may take up to 2 min depending on the size of the animal. It may be necessary to increase the pressure after some time to cause the RNP mix to enter the brain ventricles.\nProceed as soon as possible to electroporation after successful injection.\n7. Electroporation\nTransfer the animal with ring forceps onto the prepared agarose electroporation plate (Figure 1E) on ice. Place the tail inside the slit so it is sandwiched by agarose (Figure 1F).\nPlace the electrodes into the wells on both sides of the tail. Ensure that the entire animal and electrodes are covered by ice-cold PBS.\nPress the foot switch to start the electroporation.\nAfter electroporation is complete, return the animal to water.\nProceed to inject more animals if necessary.\nCheck that the electroporated animals are healthy after anesthesia wears off and that there is no damage done to the tail.\n8. Assessing knock-out efficiency\nFix the tail of the electroporated animal. Make cross-sections of the tail followed by immunohistochemical staining to assess the efficiency of the knock-out at the protein level.",
    "NOTE: If a tail amputation is to be performed after electroporation, the cut off tail could be used for this purpose. Animals electroporated with gRNAs against Gfp or Tyrosinase, for example, can be used as a negative control4.\nAlternatively, the electroporated spinal cord could be extracted and lysed for DNA. Perform genotyping PCR followed by Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing to assess the percentage of edited genetic loci15.\n\tNOTE: The resulting editing efficiency will underestimate the actual editing efficiency for NSCs, due to the inclusion of non-electroporated cells and neurons that lack apical contact to the central lumen and thus will not receive the RNP mix.\nSubscription Required.
