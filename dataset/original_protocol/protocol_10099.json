    "All stem cell and animal experiment procedures were conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the National Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Jinan University Animal Care and Use Committee (Guangzhou, China).\n1. Preparation of the DPP Scaffold with the PLA2 Decellularization Method14\nNote: See Figure 1A for a schematic of the PLA2 decellularization method.\nPrepare 100 mL of 200 U/mL PLA2 solution. Add 0.5 g of sodium deoxycholate and 2 mL of PLA2 in 198 mL of carbonate buffer solution.This solution should be used within 24 h after its preparation.\nObtain the fresh porcine pericardium (FPP) from the slaughterhouse and return to the laboratory within 1 h.\n\tNOTE: The FPP should be stored at 4 °C during the transportation. Steps 1.2 - 1.10 should be conducted with continuous shaking in a thermostat-controlled water bath.\nThoroughly wash the FPP with 200 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 500 mL beaker at 10 °Cfor 10 min. Repeat this step 2x.\nSplit the FPP into two layers and remove the adipose tissue with forceps and scissors.\n\tNOTE: Keep the FPP wet by adding 50 mL of PBS every 20 min during the removal of adipose tissue.\nShape the FPP into 10 x 10 cm2 pieces with scissors. Wash the FPP with 200 mL of carbonate buffer solution (CBS) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 500 mL beaker at 10 °C for 10 min. Repeat this step 2x.\nTransfer the FPP to pure water and soak it at 10°C for 12 h.\nSoak the 10 x 10 cm2 samples in 50 mL of CBS containing 200 U/mL PLA2 and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate solution at 37 °C for 6 h.",
    "Wash the samples with CBS containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 10 °C for 10 min. Repeat this step 2x.\nSoak each sample in 50 mL of CBS containing 200 U/mL PLA2 and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate solution at 37 °C for 2 h.\nWash the samples with CBS containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 10 °C for 2 h. Repeat this step for 10x at least. Place the samples on flat plates and dry them to constant weight in a constant temperature oven at 55 °C.\n\tNOTE: The sample needs to be completely dried. Weigh the DPP sample every 10 min and repeat that 3x or until the weight no longer changes.\nShape each DPP sample into a 10.5 mm-diameter circle with a trephine. Pack each DPP in a sterile sealed bag.\nSterilize the DPP samples by gamma irradiation (25 kGy). Stored the DPP samples at 4 °C before use.\n\tNOTE: All samples can be stored for up to six months at 4 °C.\n2. Preparations for the Cell Sheet Construction\nAutoclave all instruments and tissue carrier components at 121 °C for 30 min, including 1.5 mL centrifugal tubes, forceps, toothed forceps, scissors, black bases (tissue carrier component), and white tension rings (tissue carrier component).\nPrepare 20 mL of germ-free 10% sucrose solution. Weight 2 g of sucrose and dissolve the sucrose in 18 mL of ultrapure water. Autoclave the 10% sucrose solution at 121 °C for 30 min or filter the solution with a 0.22 µm filter.\nAutoclave the dynamic perfusion system devices at 121 °C for 30 min, including a gas exchange equipment, a 500 mL glass bottle, a perfusion culture container, and the connective tubes.\nPrepare the autoclaved instruments and tissue carrier components.Put the black base part of the tissue carrier in a culture dish.",
    "Pick up a dried DPP scaffold and put it in the center of the black base.Put a white tension ring on the DPP scaffold and fix it in the tissue carrier.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the scaffold is totally fixed in the tissue carrier and there is no gap between the black base and the white tension ring. If not, separate the tissue carrier and fix the scaffold again.\nAdd 100 µL of culture medium on the DPP scaffold for rehydration.\n\tNOTE: If the scaffold is not fixed well in the tissue carrier, the culture medium will infiltrate the culture dish.\nPut the scaffold into a 37 °C incubator and allow it to soak for 15 min.\n3. Preparation of the Cells for Cell Sheet Construction\nNote: This protocol is for cell culture using a 100 mm dish. See Figure 1B for a schematic of the construction of the multilayered cell structure.\nIsolate BMSCs13.\n\tNOTE: This method is designed for constructing a multilayered MSC cell sheet. Rat BMSCs are used in this protocol. The BMSCs are isolated using the whole bone marrow adherent method, and the BMSCs are expanded in vitro to obtain enough cell amount.\n\t\nAutoclave the instruments at 121 °C for 30 min, including forceps, toothed forceps, and scissors. Prepare a 2 mL injection syringe and BMSC culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM], 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin).\nEuthanize the three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by cervical vertebra dislocation. Soak the animal in 100 mL of 75% alcohol solution in a beaker for 5 min.\nTake the animal out of the beaker and place it prone on the operation table. Incise the skin on the back of the animal with scissors and forceps. Isolate the skin and muscle tissues to expose the thigh femurs.",
    "Isolate the thigh femurs and put it in 30 mL of PBS in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Place two thigh femurs into one tube. Vortex the centrifuge tube to wash the tissue thoroughly. Repeat this step 2x.\nCut both ends of the femurs with scissors and expose the marrow cavity.\nAspirate 2 mL of BMSC culture medium with an injection syringe. Insert the needle into the marrow cavity and flush out the bone marrow with culture medium. Flush out every two thigh femurs into one 100 mm culture dish.\nFor each 100 mm culture dish, add 2 mL of culture medium in the culture dish. Put the culture dish into the 37 °C incubator and static culture for 72 h.\nTake out the culture dish from the incubator. Replace the supernatant with 6 mL of fresh culture medium.\nObserve primary BMSCs under a microscope. Following this, passage the BMSCs every 5 - 7 d.\nTake the cells out of the incubator. Observe the cells under a microscope and choose suitable cells for cell sheet construction. When the BMSCs reach 80% - 90% confluence, the cells can be chosen as the seeded cells.\nRemove the culture medium from the culture dish. Gently wash the cells with 2 mL of warm PBS. Remove all PBS from the culture dish and make sure no liquid remains. Add 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin (or another dissociating solution) to the dish and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\nStop the trypsin effect by adding 2 mL of the culture medium, and gently wash the cells from the dish. Transfer the cell suspension into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifugate the cells at 225 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells with 3 mL of 10% (w/v) sucrose solution.",
    "NOTE: 10% (w/v) sucrose solution is used to wash the cells in order to obtain a uniform cell-hydrogel mixture in the following steps.\nAspirate 10 µL of the cell suspension and count the cell number with a hemocytometer. Calculate the volume needed for the next step. For one cell sheet, three million BMSCs are used.\nExtract three million cells and transfer them into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cells at 225 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells with 1 mL of 10% (w/v) sucrose solution. Transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Using a 1.5 mL centrifugal tube is beneficial for preparing the cell-hydrogel mixture.\nCentrifuge the cells at 260 xg for 5 min. Completely remove the supernatant and obtain the cell sediment.\n4. Preparation of the BMSCs and the RAD16-I Peptide Hydrogel Mixture\nNote: See Figure 1B for a schematic of the construction of the multilayered cell structure.\nAdd 20 µL of 10% (w/v) sucrose solution to the 1.5 mL centrifugal tube. Gently resuspend the BMSCs and obtain a uniform suspension.\n\tNOTE: Do not generate any bubbles during the resuspension.\nAdd 20 µL of RAD16-I peptide hydrogel at the top of the suspension. Gently stir the RAD16-I peptide and cell suspension with the pipette tip. When the cell suspension and hydrogel are mixed together, gently pipette the mixture a couple of times.\nTake out the DPP scaffold from the tissue carrier and gently aspirate the culture medium with a pipette tip.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the DPP scaffold is fully rehydrated before adding the cell-hydrogel mixture.\nAspirate the mixture and evenly add it to the DPP scaffold.",
    "NOTE: The total volume of the mixture would be about 40 - 50 µL. It is recommended to add the mixture 10 µL at a time from the center to the outside of the scaffold.\nAdd 1 mL of culture medium to the bottom of the tissue carrier. Put the cell sheet in the 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nTake out the cell sheet from the incubator. Gently add 4 mL of culture medium in the culture dish and immerse the cell sheet. Put the cell sheet in the 37 °C incubator for 2 h of static culture.\n5. In Vitro Culture of a 3D Multilayered Cell Sheet Using a Dynamic Culture System\nNOTE: See Figure 1C for a schematic of the 3D dynamic system.\nPrepare the dynamic perfusion system, including a peristaltic pump, gas exchange equipment, a 500 mL glass bottle, a perfusion culture container, and the connective tubes. Assemble the dynamic perfusion system as shown in Figure 2.\nAdd 200 mL of culture medium to the sterile glass bottle. Insert the cell sheet into the chamber of the culture container.\n\tNOTE: Pay attention to the direction of the upper surface of the cell sheet.\nAdd 3 mL of culture medium in the tissue container and close the container. Put the dynamic perfusion system in the incubator and start the pump. Set the flow rate of the peristaltic pump at 8 mL/min. Culture the cell sheet in the dynamic perfusion system for 48 h.\n6. Obtaining the Multilayered MSC Cell Sheet\nAutoclave the instruments and tissue carrier components at 121 °C for 30 min, including 1.5 mL centrifugal tubes, forceps, and toothed forceps.\nPull out the input duct from the glass bottle to stop the supply of culture medium to the container.",
    "NOTE: Stop the peristaltic pump when the culture container is empty.\nTake out the cell sheet from the culture container and put it in a culture dish.\nUse one forceps to immobilize the tissue carrier and use another toothed forceps to separate the white tension ring from the black base. Finally, obtain the multilayered BMSCs cell sheet.\nFor short preservation, each cell sheet can be transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifugal tube with the forceps. The DPP scaffold should be attached to the inner wall of the centrifugal tube, and the cell sheet should spread out as much as possible in the centrifuge tube.\nGently add 1 mL of culture medium in the centrifugal tube to immerse the cell sheet. Close the cap of the centrifugal tube and store the cell sheet at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The cell sheet should be transplanted or analyzed as soon as possible. It is recommended to use the cell sheet within 4 h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
