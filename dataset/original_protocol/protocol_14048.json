    "This prospective feasibility study recruited patients after obtaining Human Study IRB approval and complying with HIPAA regulations.\n1. Phantom\nFill a hollow cylindrical phantom with an insert that has hollow cylinders with a range of diameters (5 - 38 mm) with 185 MBq of [18F]-NaF.\nGenerate an attenuation map of the phantom using CT or a template that was generated previously for this phantom.\nPlace the phantom into the center of PET/MR and acquire PET data for 5-10 min recording the resultant image using the imaging console.\nReconstruct using the imaging console with the CT-based attenuation map using an algorithm that matches with the same reconstruction algorithm to be used for imaging human subjects.\nCalculate the mean activity in each cylinder (left and right) of equal size for all sizes using freeware AMIDE.\nTabulate the mean activity versus cylinder size.\nCalculate the partial volume errors (PVE) by dividing the mean activity of each cylinder by the reference cylinder mean activity.\nPlot the PVE by the size of the cylinder.\nUse the linear equation between two-cylinder sizes when correcting for PVE in the patient data.\n2. Patient Preparation\nBefore recruiting patients, obtain any necessary Human Study IRB approval and comply with HIPPA regulations.\nEstablish appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study of interest.\n\t\nInclusion criteria were as follows: adults, at least 18 years old with the capacity for informed consent; a reported history of axial non-radicular low back pain; recommended by the spine interventional radiologists.\nExclusion criteria were as follows: the history of fracture or tumor of the spine; women who are pregnant or breast-feeding; contraindications to having MRI or administration of tracer or contrast; prior lumbar surgery or instrumentation.\nGather patient’s written informed consent, approved by the Committee on Human Research.",
    "Obtain any relevant clinical exam and/or patient survey data pertinent to your study of interest.\nHave subject change into the gown, establish IV access, administer pregnancy test if the patient is female and of child-bearing age, check creatinine/GFR for the safe use of contrast, and retrieve [18F]-NaF dose. Coach the patient on the importance of remaining still throughout the duration of the exam.\nPosition patient supine and feet first in the PET/MRI.\n3. Imaging Protocol\nUse a 3.0 T PET/MRI scanner for simultaneous PET and MR image acquisition.\nUse the posterior array central molecular imaging array coil for the MR imaging.\nEnsure the FOV of both MR and PET imaging modalities is centered to cover the lower spine region from T12 to S3.\nThe Clinical MRI sequences for the lumbar spine protocol includes: Sagittal T1 (repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 510/8.6 ms, in-plane resolution = 0.75mm, through-plane resolution = 4mm), Sagittal T2 fat saturated (FS) (TR/TE = 4208/86.2 ms, in-plane resolution = 0.75mm, through-plane resolution = 4mm) Axial T2 fast relaxation fast spin echo (FRFSE) with and without fat saturation (TR/TE  = 750/9.2 ms, in-plane resolution = 0.7mm, through-plane resolution = 4mm), Axial T1 fast spin echo (FSE) Pre Gadolinium (TR/TE = 575/8.9 ms, in-plane resolution = 0.65mm, through-plane resolution = 4mm), Axial T1 FSE Post Gadolinium (TR/TE = 562/8.6 ms, in-plane resolution = 0.65mm, through-plane resolution = 4mm).\nInject 0.1 mm/kg of gadobutrol (1M Gadavist) contrast into the patient’s antecubital fossa IV directly before acquiring the MRI sequences requiring it.\nPrior to the dynamic PET scan inject the radioactive dose of [18F]-NaF into the patient at a concentration of 2.96 MBq/kg of [18F]-NaF.\nPerform a 60 min of dynamic PET scan using 3 separate temporal phases centered over the lower spine, T12 to S3.",
    "Acquire the first phase of the dynamic scan with 12 frames of 10 s each.\nAcquire the second phase of 4 frames of 30 s each.\nAcquire the last phase of 14 frames of 4 min each.\nCalculate MR attenuation correction (MRAC) for the lumbar spine region using the standard two-point Dixon method. The Dixon method segments the MR signals of fat and water into air, soft tissue, lung and fat (though not bone).\nEnsure PET data is co-registered to axial T2 fat saturated FRFSE images.\nReconstruct the PET data on the console using the following parameters: 60 cm field of view (FOV), 3 mm post-filter, Standard Z-axis filter, 256 x 256 matrix, 28 subsets, and VPFX (Time of Flight - Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization, TOF-OSEM) with 4 iterations.\nEnsure reconstruction includes post processing to correct for decay, attenuation, scatter, and dead time.\n4. Image analysis\nHave blinded radiologist interpret the clinical MRI sequences.\nEvaluate fat-suppressed T2- weighted and fat suppressed T1-weighted post-contrast sequences for grading facet synovitis as previously described by Czervionke and Fenton10.\n\t\nUse the following facet grading is: MRI grade 0 = no abnormality of the facet joint, 1 = abnormal enhancement or T2 hyperintensity limited to joint capsule, 2 = abnormal extracapsular enhancement or T2 hyperintensity involving < 50% of FJ perimeter, 3 = abnormal extracapsular enhancement or T2 hyperintensity involving >50% of FJ perimeter, and 4 = grade 3 with extension of edema into the neuroforamen, ligementum flavum, pedicle, transverse process, or vertebral body. As explained in the ref: Czervionke LF, Fenton DS. Fat-saturated MR imaging in the detection of inflammatory facet arthropathy (facet synovitis) in the lumbar spine.10\n5. Data analysis",
    "Transfer PET and MRI images to a dedicated workstation equipped to analyze dynamic PET data such as the software PMOD. Analyze the facet joints of the lumbar spine from L1-L2 to L5-S1.\nLocate regions that will be evaluated for [18F]-NaF uptake measurements: bilateral facet joints at each level. Select volumes of interest (VOI) using anatomic T2 MR images and then transfer to the PET images.\nIdentify the center point of each lumbar facet joint by visually triangulating with sagittal and axial plane T2 MR images and recording the slice number of the approximate center.\nWith the patient data open in the View tab, click the VOI button from the sidebar and select SPHERE (Object).\nWithin the Predefined window that pops up, type in 7.5 mm as the radius and click Create New VOI.\nPlace a spherical VOI (7.5 mm diameter) in the center of each facet joint by left clicking on the facet. Adjust the sphere by left clicking and dragging until visually centered on the facet.\nRepeat as necessary for all facets of interest by clicking Create New VOI and performing step 5.5\nPlace a spherical VOI (5 mm diameter) in the right iliac crest in the central marrow cavity (to exclude cortex involvement) as a reference region. Click Create New VOI and left click in the marrow of right iliac.\nPosition VOI so edges are within marrow entirely.\nEnsure VOI’s are placed similarly to the image showing vertebral body facet joint (FJ) VOIs in Figure 2 in that they encapsulate the center of the facet joint.\n6. SUV Calculations and Kinetic Data\nTo calculate the arterial input function place a cylindrical VOI covering two axial slices of the abdominal aorta. Ensure the diameter is equal to the aorta’s diameter.\nRight click on the Axial image, select data inspection.",
    "Measure the diameter of the abdominal aorta proximal to its bifurcation.\nLeft click on the right side of the aortic wall and move the cursor to the left side of the aortic wall.\nRecord the distance of the aortic wall diameter in the Data Inspector window. This will be used to calculate the partial volume correction (PVC) coefficient.\nLeft click the VOI button from the sidebar, select CIRCLE (ROI).\nCreate a Circle ROI with a specified radius of half of the previously measured diameter in Step 6.5\nClick Create New VOI and left click in the center of the aorta, reposition if necessary, to ensure circle approximates aortic wall position.\nDescend one slice in the axial plane and repeat steps 6.7-6.9, thereby, making a cylinder from the two circular ROI’s.\n7. PET Partial Volume Correction\nNOTE: Due to PVE the tracer activity is underestimated in relation to the size of the target. Therefore, steps are taken to correct for the PVE.\nUse the recovery coefficients that were derived earlier using the PET/CT phantom by plotting the size of the cylinder diameter versus the ratio of recovered activity to true activity.\nApply the recovery coefficients to the image-based measurement over the descending aorta to create a partial-volume corrected arterial input.\nSubstitute this partial-volume corrected arterial input into PMOD for use in kinetic modeling and accurate quantification of tracer kinetics.\n8. SUV Calculations and Kinetic Data\nNote: The algorithm used to calculate Standard Uptake Value (SUV), Equation 1, makes the assumption that the tracer is equally distributed throughout the body and that the lean body mass accurately represents whole body volume. Therefore, SUVs are referred to as a semi-quantitative measurement.\nEquation 1: Standard Uptake Value\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58491/58491eq1.jpg\nCalculate the SUVmax, and SUVmean values for each subsite using the 60-minute time point.",
    "Note: The two-tissue compartment model used for kinetic modeling is shown in Fig 1. Cp is the concentration of tracer in the blood plasma while Ce and Ct represent the concentration in the unbound interstitial space and bound tracer in the target bone matrix respectively. K1, k2, k3, k4, are 4 parameters that describe the kinetic model for tracer wash in/out and binding.\nUse the two-tissue compartment irreversible for Patlak Linear model and Non-Linear regression models during kinetic analysis\n\tNote: A two-tissue irreversible compartment model is used to calculate region-specific influx rate constants (in min-1) for [18F]-NaF11.\nEnsure the time to equilibrium is set to 24 minutes when using the Patlak kinetic model\nInput k4 = 0 when using the nonlinear regression model to produce Ki_NonLinear influx rates.\nCalculate the tracer influx rate from the blood pool to the bone matrix using Equation 2 and Equation 3 for Ki_Patlak and Ki_NonLinear respectively. Ki_Patlak and Ki_NonLinear are the rates at which [18F]-NaF leaves the arterial blood pool and irreversibly binds to a subsite bone matrix, using the two models respectively.\n\t\nEquation 2: Patlak Graphical Kinetic Model\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58491/58491eq2.jpg + Intercept\nEquation 3: Nonlinear Regression Kinetic Model\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58491/58491eq3.jpg\n9. Statistical Analysis\nUse a linear regression analysis to evaluate if [18F]-NaF Ki_Patlak influx rate was correlated to: SUVmean, SUVmax, Ki_NonLinear, and any clinical scoring grades specific to the study.\nUse two-tailed t-test and Pearson correlation to test for statistical significance in previous correlations.\nSubscription Required.
