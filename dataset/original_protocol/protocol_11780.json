    "All animal procedures were performed with the approval of Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Retrovirus generation and in vitro cardiac reprogramming\nCulture Platinum E cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 µg/mL puromycin, and 10 µg/mL blasticidin until Platinum E cell confluency reaches 70%–80%.\nOn Day 1, seed ~0.55 x 106 cells (first well) and ~0.18 x 106 cells (second well) into two separate wells of 12-well plate with 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin a day prior to the first transfection.\n\tNOTE: Different sizes of culture dishes can be used depending on the amount of viral media needed for the experiments. Refer to Table 1 for other scales of experiments.\nOn Day 2, transfect the quad-cistronic M-G-T-H retroviral construct encoding Mef2c, Gata4, Tbx5, and Hand2 described in the previous study9 or empty vector into Platinum E cells of the first well. Add 3 µL of transfection reagent to 30 µL of reduced serum media. Five minutes later, add 1 µg retroviral construct or the empty vector into the mixture of transfection reagent and reduced serum media. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, add the mixture to Platinum E cells.\nOn Day 3, 16–20 h after transfection, remove the media and replenish fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nOn Day 3, 24 h after the first transfection, perform the second transfection into the second well in which Platinum E cells were plated on Day 1 as described in step 1.3).\nOn Day 3, seed ~5 x 104 frozen mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Titin-GFP reporter knock-in mice19 into a well of 24-well plate. A total of two wells of 24-well plate are needed (i.e., uninfected control and M-G-T-H infection).",
    "NOTE: The number of MEFs plated may need to be adjusted, because the recovery rate of frozen MEFs can vary depending on cell freezing conditions. About 10% confluency a day after seeding cells is adequate for reprogramming. Reprogramming efficiency could be enhanced using fresh unfrozen MEFs.\nOn Day 4, 16–20 h after the second transfection, remove the media and replenish fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nOn Day 4, 48 h after the first transfection, collect the viral media in the first well of Platinum E cells using a 5 mL syringe and filter them through a 0.45 µm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filter. Remove the fibroblast growth media on MEFs, and replace them with the viral media supplemented with polybrene at 6 µg/mL (first infection).\nOn Day 5, 48 h after the second transfection, perform the second infection using the viral media in the second well as described in step 1.8).\nOn Day 6, 24 h after the second infection, the viral media are replaced with cardiac induction media composed of DMEM/199 (4:1), 10% FBS, 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% essential amino acids, 1% B-27, 1% insulin-selenium-transferrin, 1% vitamin mixture, and 1% sodium pyruvate, 1 µM SB431542, and 0.5 µm A83-01. Change cardiac induction media every three days until the cells are harvested.\n2. Immunostaining\nAt 14–15 days post infection, fix the cells on a 24-well plate with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min.\nPermeabilize the fixed cells with permeabilization buffer (0.05% Triton-X in PBS) by washing the cells three times with permeabilization buffer every 5 min.\nIncubate the cells with universal blocking buffer for 45 min.\nIncubate the cells with mouse α-actinin (1:400 dilution) and chicken GFP antibodies (1:400 dilution) for 1.5 h at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: About 150 µL of antibody solution can cover the whole area of a well of 24-well plate.\nWash the cells with permeabilization buffer for 5 min three times.\nIncubate the cells with anti-mouse Alexa-555 and anti-chicken Alexa-488 secondary antibodies (1:400 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature\nWash the cells with permeabilization buffer for 5 min three times.\nAdd 2.5 µL of DAPI solution into 250 µL of permeabilization buffer.\n3. High content imaging\nTurn on the imaging system.\nOpen the associated software.\nLog into the system.\nOn the taskbar, select Run a Plate.\nClick on Open Door-Eject Plate to open the door on the machine and put the plate in. Make sure the plate is in the right direction. Click on Close Door-Load Plate to close the door.\nClick on Load Plate Settings. Select a template protocol, and then click on Load From DB.\nClick on Acquisition Setup.\nIn the Plate Acquisition Setup dialog, click on Configure.\nIn the Objective and Camera tab, select 10x objective.\nIn the Plate tab, select a 24-well plate.\nIn the Sites to Visit tab on Site Options, choose \"Fixed number of sites\" to determine the number of imaging sites by choosing the number in columns and rows. A total of 36 imaging sites are used by selecting 6 in columns and 6 in rows. Select the Spacing between each imaging site (i.e., 500 μm).\nIn the Acquisition tab, set the number of wavelength as 3.\nIn the Wavelengths tab on Illumination, select DAPI, FITC, or Texas Red for each wavelength separately.",
    "Click on the Run tab and then set up the \"Folder Name\" and \"Plate Name\" for the plate.  Click the wells on the plate diagram for imaging and then on Calculate to set up the focus offset for each wavelength. Set up the foucs offset for DAPI first. Click on Auto Expose to set up the exposure time automatically for each wavelength. Then, click on Acquire Plate to start imaging the selected sites.\n4. Analysis of high content imaging\nOnce high content imaging is completed, click on the Screening menu, and select Review Plate Data to select a plate for analysis.\nClick on Select Plate. In the Select Plate for Review dialog, open the folder and select the plate saved in the database and then click on Select.\n\tNOTE: To display the images, select DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red in the Wavelengths field. In the Sites field, select All Sites. Click on a site among the selected 36 sites to display it in each wavelength image window, and then click on Look-Up Table to select a color for the wavelength. Use the Print Screen key on the keyboard and paste the image in a photo editing software (e.g., Paint and Photoshop) to save it.\nClick on Run Analysis, and select a template setting.\nClick on Configure Settings and then on Number of Wavelengths. Select three wavelengths (i.e., DAPI for nuclei staining, Teaxs Red for α-actinin, and FITC for Titin-GFP).\nUsing the Line tool in the tool bar, measure the width across the short axis of a cell. Based on the measured widths of cells, set the “Approximate min width” and “Approximate max width” to include most of cells in the selected imaging site.",
    "Click on Preview to check whether nearly all nuclei are selected. The selected nuclei exhibit white color, while the unselected nuclei remain blue (DAPI stained). If necessary, make adjustments for “Approximate min width” and “Approximate max width”.\nTo set Intensity Above Local Background, place a mouse cursor inside and outside of a cell. The intensity value appears at the bottom of the window. Slightly reduce the intensity of a dim cell to evenly exhibit the intensity throughout the whole area of each cell. Define this intensity value as Intensity Above Local Background value. This value needs to be set separately for each channel.\nClick on the Screening menu and select Plate Data Utilities. In the Plate Data Utilities dialog, click on Run Analysis to select the plate.\nIn the Settings field, select the saved setting for analysis; select Add to Auto Run List, and then click on OK to run the analysis.\nAfter the analysis is completed, click on Screening menu and select Plate Data Utilities. Then, in the Plate Data Utilities dialog, click on Export Measurements to export the analysis results.\nClick on Cell and Image Measurements and then on OK.\nOn the Export Measurements Wizard - Step 1 page, select the plate and click on Next.\nOn the Export Measurements Wizard - Step 2 page, click on Finish.\nOn the Configure Data Export page, select the data types (i.e., well name, total cell number, subtotal cell number for DAPI+, subtotal cell number for Texas Red+, subtotal cell number for FITC+, subtotal cell number for DAPI+Texas Red+, subtotal cell number for DAPI+FITC+, subtotal cell number for DAPI+FITC+Texas Red+, percentage of DAPI+ cells, percentage of DAPI+Texas Red+ cells, percentage of DAPI+FITC+ cells, and percentage of DAPI+Texas Red+FITC+ cells) and then click on OK.",
    "On the Export as text file page, select the destination to save the file and click on OK.\nOpen the file in Microsoft Excel. The results will be presented by each site (Table 2). There are 36 sites per well. Using the analysis tool, Pivot Table, summarize the data of the 36 sites (i.e., the sums of cell numbers and the averages of the indicated cell percentage in all the 36 sites) (Table 3).\nSubscription Required.
