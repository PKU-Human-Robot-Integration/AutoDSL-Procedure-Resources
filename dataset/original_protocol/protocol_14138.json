    "NOTE: All steps have to be performed in a BSL2 hood unless stated differently. Viral titration is required in advance of a PRN assay to determine the optimal RSV concentration used in the PRN assay. It is recommended to aliquot the virus stocks in a small volume that will be thawed once and used for each NAb assay. Using the same viral stock for all NAb assays performed for all samples from one study is also recommended. Make sure culture media and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is warmed at 37 °C before adding to cell plates.\n1. RSV Viral Titration\nNOTE: Depending on the number of virus stocks and the number of duplicates, the assay plate can be set up according to Figure 1. Each virus stock should be titrated in triplicate down the assay plate, starting at the highest viral concentration (i.e., 1:10). Serial titrations can be typically 1:10. A549 cell culture and maintenance as well as RSV culture procedure are done using standard procedures and are not included in this protocol.\nSeeding plates (Day 1) \nResuspend A549 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) + 1000 IU penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) at 4 x 105/mL. Seed 96-well flat-bottom sterile plates with 100 μL/well containing 4 x 104 A459 cells.\nIncubate plates overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (cells will be in the log-phase growth).\nNOTE: Use new A549 cell vial after 23 passages. It is recommended to not start the experiments when a new cell vial is still at the first three passages.\nVirus infection (Day 2) \nPreparation of virus serial dilution",
    "Rapidly thaw a single frozen vial of RSV in a 37 °C water bath until almost completely thawed and place immediately on ice. Prepare 3 replicates for each RSV virus stock to be assayed, use an initial virus stock dilution of 1:10 with 100 μL of diluted virus/well and reserve at least one column for negative control.\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows negative control in triplicates.\nAdd 100 μL of each diluted virus at 1:10 in triplicate of row A of a 96-well U-bottom sterile plate. Add 90 μL/well of DMEM + 1000 IU pen/strep without FCS to rows B to H.\nPerform serial 1:10 dilutions down the plate by transferring 10 μL from row A to row B. Mix solution by pipetting content up and down 5 times and continue the ten-fold dilutions until row H. Discard the final 10 μL so that the final volume in each well is 90 μL.\nNOTE: It is important to use new tips for each dilution.\nVirus inoculation to A549 cells\nRetrieve A549 cell plate(s) prepared on the previous day. Ensure that A549 cell monolayers in the 96-well plates are ~80% confluent. Discard media by gently inverting plate and lightly blotting on sterile absorbent paper towel.\nWash all wells with 100 μL of PBS twice, discard excess PBS by gently inverting plate and lightly blotting on sterile absorbent paper towel after each wash. Do not allow plates to dry.\nTransfer the virus dilutions from the viral titration plate (Figure 1) to corresponding wells on the A549 cell plate. Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 1 h incubation, decant supernatants using a pipette (to avoid cross contamination). Take out 90 μL/well.",
    "Add 100 μL of 1x medium 199 (M199, see Table of Materials) + 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) low viscosity + 2% FCS containing pen/strep to each well.\nNOTE: 2x M199 + 4% FCS + 2% pen/strep and 3% CMC solutions need to be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C for future use. Make sure the solution is warmed at 37 °C before adding to plates.\n\t\t\t\nPrepare 2x M199 solution: 1 sachet/500 mL distilled water + 20 mL FCS + 10 mL pen/strep (to make up 2x MI99). Filter the solution using a 0.22 μm filter unit.\nFor preparation of 3% CMC, add 15 g of CMC slowly into 500 mL of distilled water. Dissolve the CMC in water by using metallic stirrer heater at 50 °C, which takes about 1 h of preparation. Mix well to make 3% CMC and autoclave the solution.\nNOTE: The CMC solid must be added to the water in order to be dissolved; adding water to the dry solid produces a “clump” of solid that is very difficult to dissolve.\nPrepare 1x M199 + 1.5% CMC low viscosity + 2% FCS containing pen/strep by mixing 1:1 the 2x M199 and 3% CMC prepared in step 1.2.2.4.2.\nIncubate plate for 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDeveloping assay plate and analysis (Day 5)\nFixation and developing assay plate\n\t\t\nDiscard M199 + CMC + 2% FCS containing pen/strep by gently inverting the plate. Add slowly (in order to avoid disturb the cell layer) 200 μL of fixation buffer (80% acetone, 20% PBS, stored at -20 °C) to fix cells. Incubate at -20 °C for 20 min.\nDiscard the fixation buffer and gently blot on absorbent paper towel. Leave plate face down to dry for 10 min.",
    "NOTE: From this step onwards, assay can be performed outside the BSL2 hood.\nPrepare 5% milk diluent blocking solution in filtered PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate 20 (PBS-polysorbate, see Table of Materials). For one plate, calculate the volume needed for blocking based on 200 /well and 110 wells: 200/well x 110 wells = 22 mL (1.1 mL concentrated milk diluent in 20.9 mL filtered PBS-polysorbate). At this stage, also make up sufficient blocking solution for primary and secondary antibodies. For one plate, calculate the volume needed for each antibody solution based on 50 /well and 110 wells: 50 /well x 110 wells = 5.5 mL. Therefore, the total volume of milk diluent blocking solution required for a single plate assay is 33 mL.\nAdd 200 /well of blocking solution. Incubate plate at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Discard the solution by gently inverting the plate and blot on absorbent paper towel.\nPrepare 1:500 Goat X RSV antibody (mAb – primary antibody) diluted in blocking solution. Add 50 /well of the mAb solution and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Wash plate 3 times with filtered PBS-polysorbate.\nPrepare 1:5,000 Alexa-Fluor donkey anti-goat IgG (secondary antibody) diluted in blocking solution. Add 50 /well of the secondary antibody solution and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Wash plate 5 times with filtered PBS-polysorbate.\nRead plate on an automated spots reader using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel and count settings as shown in Figure 2. Wrap plate in foil and store at 4 °C. Calibrate the instrument using an unused 96-well culture plate and inputting count settings before assay.",
    "NOTE: Re-scanning within a few days is possible if required. The calibration and count setting can be saved and used for the future scanning if the assay uses the same type of plate used for the calibration.\nCheck the images of wells for artefact plaques or disrupted cell monolayers (Figure 3). Exclude wells with disrupted cell monolayers.\nNOTE: Depending on the size of the artefact plaques, manual counts may need to be performed for those wells or those wells may need to be discarded from data analysis. Criteria for a valid result include no disrupted cell monolayer or artefact plaques detected in more than one replicate well and no PFU detected in negative wells (wells without added virus).\nDetermine viral concentrations \nChoose the last two dilutions where spots can be counted clearly. Calculate the average number of spots from replicate wells at the same dilution. Calculate the viral titer (PFU per mL) of the stock sample using the formula below:\n\t\t\tPFU/mL = Average number of plaques/(Dilution factor × Volume of diluted virus added to the well)\n\t\t\tNOTE: The virus concentration determined for each RSV stock can now be used in the PRN assay (step 2).\n2. RSV Neutralization Assay\nSeeding plates (Day 1)\nResuspend A549 cells in DMEM + 10% FCS + 1000 IU pen/strep at 4 x 105/mL. Seed 96-well flat-bottom sterile plates with 100 μL/well containing 4 x 104 A459 cells and incubate plates overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (cells will be in the log-phase growth).\nNOTE: Use new A549 cell vial after 23 passages. It is not recommended to use A549 cells before passage number 3.\nVirus and serum preparation (Day 2)",
    "NOTE: Depending on the sample type, there are required steps for pre-processing samples before the NAb assay. It is recommended to use the RSV international standard sera that are now available upon request from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC).\n\t\nPreparation of serum dilution\nThaw the human RSV reference antiserum (reference serum, REF) and serum test samples at RT. Heat-inactivate serum samples and reference antiserum in a water bath at 56 °C for 30 min prior to use. Prepare dilutions as per the plate template (Figure 4).\nPrepare 1:100 dilution of the REF. Prepare a minimum of 110 μL of REF diluted in DMEM + pen/strep without FCS per assay plate (e.g., 1.5 μL of REF in a total volume of 150 μL). Add 110 μL of 1:100 diluted REF in well A12 of a 96-well U-bottom sterile plate.\nAdd 55 μL of DMEM + pen/strep without FCS to wells B12 to H12 in column 12. Perform serial 1:2 dilutions down the plate by transferring 55 μL from row A to row B, mixing solution by pipetting content up and down 5 times and continuing until row H. Discard the final 55 μL of media so that the final volume in each well is 55 μL. Use new tips for each dilution.\nPrepare 1:100 dilution of serum test samples. As all serum samples are assayed in triplicate, prepare a minimum volume of 110 μL/well x 3 = 330 μL per serum test sample.\nAdd 110 μL of each diluted serum test sample (1:100; S1 = serum 1, S2 = serum 2, etc.) to corresponding wells A1 to A9 and also E1 to E9 of the 96-well sterile plate according to Figure 4.",
    "Add 55 μL of DMEM + pen/strep without FCS to all wells labelled X. Perform serial 1:2 dilutions as per step 2.2.1.3 until row D (for samples 1, 2, and 3). Discard the final 55 μL of media so that the final volume in each well is 55 μL. Similarly, perform the serial 1:2 dilutions for samples 4, 5, and 6 for rows E to H.\nNOTE: It is important to use new tips for each dilution.\nAdd 55 μL of DMEM + pen/strep without FCS to wells in columns 10 and 11.\nPreparation of virus\nRapidly thaw a single frozen vial of RSV in a 37 °C water bath until almost completely thawed and place immediately on ice. \nDilute virus in DMEM + pen/strep without FCS based on the concentration of the RSV aliquot determined in step 1.3.2. Apply a dilution that gives approximately 200 PFU/well. Prepare a total volume of 5.5 mL (for 100 wells).\nPreparation of virus-serum mixture\nAdd 55 of the diluted virus to all wells of columns 1-9 and wells of rows E-H of columns 10 and 11 (positive control) according to the plate template (Figure 4).\nAdd 55 of DMEM + pen/strep without FCS to all wells of rows A-D of columns 10 and 11 (negative control). Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nVirus inoculation to A549 cells\nPrior to the completion of incubation period, retrieve A549 cell plate(s) prepared in step 2.1.1. Ensure that A549 cell monolayers in the 96-well plates are ~80% confluent.",
    "Discard media by gently inverting plate and lightly blotting on sterile absorbent paper towel. Wash all wells with 100 μL of PBS twice, discard excess PBS by gently inverting plate and lightly blotting on sterile absorbent paper towel after each wash. Do not allow plates to dry.\nTransfer 100 /well of the virus-serum mixture to the corresponding wells on the A549 cell plate following the plate template Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 1 h, using a pipette, take out 90 /well and add 100 of prewarmed 1x M199 + 1.5% CMC + 2% FCS + pen/strep. Incubate plate for 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nNOTE: Make sure the solution is warmed at 37 °C before adding to plates.\nDeveloping assay plate and analysis (Day 5) \nDevelop fixation and assay plate following steps 1.3.1.1 to 1.3.1.8.\nDetermine the 50% neutralization titer  \n\t\t\nDetermine the 50% neutralization titer by calculating the proportional distance between the reciprocal serum dilutions above and below 50% of the ‘no serum’ control wells (positive virus control - column 10, rows E-H).\nCount the number of PFU (i.e., plaques) arising from individual viral infections in serum wells and no serum control wells. Calculate the mean number of PFU of the no serum control wells and determine the 50% value.\nIdentify serum dilutions with counts which are immediately above and below the 50% value of the no serum control wells.Using a semi-log graph or spreadsheet template, plot the number of PFU on the x-axis (linear scale) and the reciprocal serum dilution on the y-axis (log10 scale). Draw a line between the two points and read the 50% neutralization titers of the test serum samples from this line.",
