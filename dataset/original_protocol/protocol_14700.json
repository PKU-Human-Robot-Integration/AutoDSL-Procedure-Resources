    "All animal procedures were approved by the University of California San Diego and University of Miami institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC) and performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research. All reagents and instruments used in surgical procedures are sterile.\n1. Anesthetize and Prepare the Rat for Surgery\nPrior to procedure, rats are anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) according to body weight. Adequate depth of anesthesia should be determined by a negative response to toe pinch stimulus.\nOnce anesthetized, pull the tongue forward to prevent asphyxia and apply lubricating ointment to both eyes to prevent drying of the corneas during surgery.\nShave the surgical sites using a hair clipper and wipe the area three times with 10% providone-iodine detergent solution and 70% ethanol.\nDrape the animal within a sterile field. Sterile gloves and surgical instruments are used during survival surgery. Re-sterilize the tips of instruments using a hot bead sterilizer between animals.\n2. Surgical Approach\nPION induction\nFemoral vein catheterization\nPrepare and clean the surgical site. Shave the right inner thigh using a hair clipper and wipe the area three times each with 10% providone-iodine detergent solution and 70% ethanol.\nPrepare the tubing. Cut a 40cm length of polyethylene tubing (PE 10) sterilized in 70% ethanol. Flush the tubing with saline and connect it to a 1 ml syringe containing a pre-measured solution of 2% erythrosin B dye (1 μl/mg, yielding a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight). Mount the syringe into a foot-switch controlled infusion pump set to a rate of 600 μl/min.",
    "Using a No. 15 blade, make a small horizontal incision at the base of the right thigh. Cut and spread the membrane inside and clean the area with sterile cotton swabs.\nSeparate the muscle with forceps until the branch of the femoral vein is visible. A sheath surrounds the artery, vein and the nerve. Pinch and pull this sheath upward with forceps (fine-tip Dumont forceps), and cut a small incision (2-4 mm is usually adequate) near the base of the triangular-shaped wedge with Vannas spring scissors. Expand the cut as necessary.\nSeparate the vein and artery with a blunt micro-surgical hook parallel to the direction of the vein. Be careful not to damage the delicate membrane and vein branches. Then, gently lift the vein and separate it from the underlying connective tissue.\nObtain a needleless nylon suture and place it next to the femoral vein. Using the micro-surgical hook, elevate the vein and pass the fine-tip forceps beneath the distal region. Grab one end of the suture and pull it underneath the vein. Ligate the distal vein tightly. Pass a second suture in a similar manner under the proximal vein and make a loose knot.\nMake a small cut in the vein near the distal ligation with Vannas spring scissors. Expand the hole as necessary with the fine-tip forceps. Some blood may leak through the cut. Clean the surgical area with cold, sterile BSS and sterile cotton swabs.\nHolding the vein wall at the edge of the cut, catheterize the vessel with the prepared saline-flushed tubing using a needle holder. Tighten the proximal knot around the vein and tubing. Then, anchor the tubing by tying it to the distal suture.",
    "Check the quality of the catheterization by pressing the foot-switch to inject saline, <1 ml is adequate. Make sure the tubing is unobstructed and has no leaks. Temporarily close the incision with sutures to protect the catheterization and tissue.\nExposure of the optic nerve\nPrepare the surgical site by wiping the pre-shaved area above the left eye three times each with 10% providone-iodine detergent solution and 70% ethanol.\nMake an incision along the skin 2-3 mm behind the eye with a No. 15 blade. Pinch and lift the connective tissue with serrated forceps, and make a small incision with Vannas spring scissors. This small incision is generally about 5 mm in length, but can be longer to provide greater exposure for a surgeon in training. Continue to bluntly dissect through the connective tissue along the superior rim of the orbital bone, taking care to avoid disrupting blood vessels. Clean the surgical area with cotton swabs.\nDissect downward through the conjunctiva until the superior rectus muscle is visible. Pinch and dissect through the muscle; the muscle will be liberated from deep within the orbit. Now, surrounding tissues can be utilized to aid in the retraction and elevation of the eye for ease of visualization.\nRetract the flap of skin and connective tissue laterally and downward, and hold in place with a suture and hemostat. This will rotate the eye forward and outward in order to reveal the fat-containing sheath that surrounds the optic nerve.\nCarefully insert a pair of sharp forceps and expand parallel to the optic nerve to separate the connective tissue surrounding the sheath. Do not touch the optic nerve with the sharp tips of the forceps.",
    "A 5 mm length of the optic nerve and surrounding sheath should now be visible. A network of microvessels on the sheath surface encircles the optic nerve. These will be targeted during laser irradiation.\nIntravenous injection of Erythrosin B and laser irradiation\nWear orange-colored safety glasses at all times while operating the laser irradiation apparatus to shield yourself from the green laser light. Turn on the laser, open the shutter and adjust the peak and average powers of the laser as necessary. Close the shutter.\nPosition the rat in the laser irradiation apparatus. To ensure proper beam placement, a weak aiming beam is produced by spatially filtering the laser through a 100 µm diameter hole drilled in the closed shutter blade. Re-expose the optic nerve with a pair of fine tip forceps, and position the aiming beam onto the intraorbital optic nerve between 3 mm and 4 mm behind the optic nerve head.\nInject the solution of 2% erythrosin B via activation of the infusion pump. It may circulate for a few seconds while the surgeon adds a small drop of BSS to moisten the surface of the optic nerve.\nVerify the position of the aiming beam and then click the foot-switch to initiate irradiation. An orange-colored safety filter, which is added into the optical path of the microscope, will be immediately triggered followed by the opening of the shutter after a 1 sec delay.",
    "Irradiate the optic nerve for 90 sec with a peak power of 135mW and average power of 18mW produced by a beam chopper rotating at 250 Hz with a duty cycle of 15% (this minimizes thermal effects). Yellow fluorescence, visualized as bright orange through the safety filter, will be emitted from the superior surface of the optic nerve and is sufficient to ensure that the beam irradiates the nerve symmetrically.\nAfter the irradiation, the orange-colored safety filter will open automatically. Microhemorrhage can be observed in some cases.\nRelieve the traction on the extra ocular muscles and return the eye to a neutral position. Close the incision with interrupted sutures. Then withdraw the catheter and tie off the femoral vein tightly to prevent leakage; close with interrupted sutures. Apply antibiotic ointment to both incisions. Check the fundus to verify the vascular integrity of the central retinal vein and artery.\nRetrograde Labeling of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs). NOTE: In order to evaluate RGC survival, retrograde labeling with fluorogold (FG) should be completed one week before PION. The method is described in detail in JoVE protocol 81913.\n\t\nIn brief: anesthetize the animal with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) and shave the head.\nSurgically scrub the incision site and make a midline incision across the head to expose the skull.\nDrill bilateral holes through the skull (ø 2x2 mm) 0.5 mm from both the sagittal and transverse sutures.\nCarefully aspirate the cerebral content that lies over the dorsal surface of the superior colliculus (SC) using a vacuum pump. Then, place a small piece of gelfoam soaked with 4% FG onto the surface of the SC.\nClose the incision with sutures and care for the animal using standard postoperative care.\nPost-operative care and Euthanasia",
    "After surgery, place animal in a separate clean cage on top of a recirculating heated water pad until the animal is recovered.\nPost-surgical analgesics (buprenorphine HCl, 0.01 mg/kg) should be administered twice per day for three consecutive days to minimize discomfort.\nRat should be kept separately and observed until they are able to maintain sternal recumbency and regain sufficient consciousness.\nSigns of recovery and good health are monitored daily for at least 5 days after the surgery, or until suture removal and adequate healing of the surgical site, whichever occurs latest.\nEuthanize the animals by perfusion with 4% PFA at scientifically appropriate time points after the surgery according to investigative interest.\nSubscription Required.
