    "Preparation of liposomes for DPILiposomes are prepared for DPI as described in Lee et al. (2010). This involves dissolving the dried phospholipids in chloroform to a 2 mM stock, and for PI(4,5)P2 a 2 mM stock is prepared in chloroform, methanol and MilliQ water (20:9:1). Avanti polar lipids provides information about the requirements for dissolving their lipids on their product sheets and website. Lipid mixtures of POPC: POPS: POPE: PI and POPC: POPS: POPE: PI(4,5)P2 in a ratio of 56:10:30:4 are prepared by adding each of the desired 2 mM lipid stocks to glass vials to a final volume of 410 μl. The lipids are then dried under a stream of nitrogen gas in a warm water bath (≈ 55 °C) in a fume hood. A thin lipid film that coats the bottom and sides of the round bottom tube is desired. This is created by constantly turning the tilted vial in the warm bath under the stream of nitrogen gas. The gas is at a flow rate that just causes a disruption to the surface of the lipid mixture. Once all the visible liquid is evaporated, the nitrogen gas stream is increased and the tube is given a final blow out to remove remaining organic solvent. Lipid films are vacuum dried overnight to ensure complete liquid removal. After this stage the vials are capped and sealed with Parafilm prior to storage at -20 °C until required. Lipids are resuspended to 1.14 mM (average lipid concentration) in degassed, freshly made 10 mM MOPS, pH 7 with 150 mM NaCl at 40 °C (720 μl). The lipids are rehydrated by incubating for 30 min in a shaking incubator at 40 °C.",
    "The temperature for this incubation should be above the gel-liquid crystal transition temperature (Tc or Tm), so that the lipids are rehydrated in their fluid phase. Avanti polar lipids provide information regarding the Tc/Tm of their lipids.The hydrated liposome mixture is then sonicated in a warm water bath (≈ 40 °C) for 20 min, or until clear. A sonicator bath is preferred over a sonicator probe for this procedure as probes are likely to overheat the lipid sample. Sonicator probes can also generate titanium fragments that need to be removed by centrifugation before using liposomes.The liposomes are made into a uniform size by extruding the mixture through a 100 μm polycarbonate membrane 21 times using a pre-warmed Avenstin lipofast extruder. Warming the assembled extruder helps to ensure the lipid mixture remains above the Tc of the lipids. Extruding lipid mixtures below the Tc will usually result in the membrane becoming clogged with rigid liposomes. To load the liposomes into the extruder syringe use a wide gauge needle. Remove all the air from the syringe prior to attaching to the extruder assembly. Once the liposomes are prepared they should be used immediately for DPI.Dual polarisation interferometryDual polarisation interferometry (DPI) is conducted as described in Lee et al. (2010). Measurements are performed using an Analight® Bio200 DPI instrument. The flow rate is controlled by external Harvard Apparatus PHD2000 programmable syringe pumps, which are primed with degassed, double-distilled water. If using this setup, the flow rate must be changed on the pumps and set in the program Analight Inject that controls the DPI machine.A highly clean chip surface is a critical step in forming lipid bilayers with reproducible structure. The washing procedure is performed after the chip is loaded into the machine and thus the lines are cleaned at the same time.",
    "The silicone oxynitride AnaChip is cleaned using a three-step washing procedure involving an initial wash of 10% Hellamanex II, injected at 25 μl/min for 8 min. A second wash of 2% SDS injected at 50 μl/min for 4 min followed by the third wash of 100% ethanol at 50 μl/min for 4 min. A water rinse at 50 μl/min for 2 min is performed between all three wash steps. After cleaning the chip, the interference fringes for each channel are set up in the set channel window. To calibrate the channels on the chip, press the button that has three parallel vertical lines and snap a high resolution image to observe the quality of the chip. Each of the three channels should have distinct bands and a relatively even pattern corresponding to the valleys and the peaks of light (Figure 1). If the chip quality is okay, data acquisition begins by pressing the start button.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161230/20161230002751_7925.jpg Figure 1. Quality of a chip can by observed through the Interference fringes of the three chip channels. A. A high quality chip surface will have distinct bands in each of the three channels that represent the valleys and peaks of light. B. These bands will become less distinct and uneven as the quality of the chip deteriorates.Calibration of the chip is achieved by injecting 120 μl of 80% ethanol at 50 μl/min followed by a linear gradient of 100-0% of 80% ethanol to the bulk buffer (10 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7 with 150 mM NaCl) at 20 μl/min (Figure 2). A 140 μl water injection at 50 μl/min is then performed for the bulk calibration. The buffer baseline should remain stable throughout these calibration steps and should only change when the temperature is changed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161230/20161230003155_3869.jpgFigure 2.",
    "TM and TE phase change profile of NaD1 (4 µM) binding to bilayer. The first section of the profile contains the chip calibration data that consists of the initial 80% ethanol injection, followed by the linearization injection of 100 to 0% of 80% ethanol and then the bulk calibration of 140 μl water injection. The profile baseline decreases during the change of temperature from 20 to 28 °C. The lipid bilayer is then formed once the base line stabilizes by injecting liposomes (POPC: POPS: POPE: PI[4,5]P2) followed by a calcium injection. The baseline then increases due to the decrease in temperature back to 20 °C. Next the protein is injected (NaD1, 4 μM) for 4 min, followed by disassociation for 30 min. The chip surface is regenerated for future use by removing the lipid bilayer using a three-step wash procedure of two washes each of 10% Hellamanex II, 2% SDS, and 100% ethanol. The chip readings are allowed to stabilise in the bulk buffer at both 20 °C and 28 °C. Once the baseline is stable at 28 °C, liposomes (0.1-0.2 mM) are injected in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 at 20 µl/min for 10 min followed by an injection of 2 mM CaCl2 in 10 mM MOPS buffer pH 7 with 150 mM NaCl (200 μl) (Figure 2). The presence of calcium helps the formation and stabilization of the supported lipid bilayer. The concentration of calcium may need to be changed in the range of 1-5 mM depending on lipid composition. Liposomes with high PE and other negatively charged lipids will require greater amounts of calcium to form a stable bilayer. If necessary for protein interaction studies, the calcium ions can be removed from the lipid bilayer surface by injecting 2 mM EDTA in running buffer.",
    "The adsorbed lipid bilayers are further equilibrated in running buffer for an additional 20 min until a stable baseline is achieved. This is performed at both 28 °C and 20 °C. The stabilization of baseline takes approximately 20 min for each temperature. The coverage and presence of defects in the supported lipid bilayer can be checked with an injection of 50 μl BSA (50 μg/ml in running buffer). Complete coverage of the lipid bilayer is confirmed by the absence of BSA binding.The protein of interest, NaD1 is prepared for injection in running buffer. The sample (160 μl) with 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 μM of NaD1 is degassed prior to injection at 40 μl/min for 4 min followed by a dissociation for 30 min in the running buffer (Figure 2). The chip surface is regenerated and cleaned and a new bilayer was deposited for each NaD1 injection. All solutions are degassed before injection."
