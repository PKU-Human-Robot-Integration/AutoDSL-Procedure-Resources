    "Animal procedures were approved by The University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.  All experiments were performed using 8-12-week-old male and female mice bred in-house on a C57BL/6 background. Transgenic mice with cre-recombinase driven by the fibroblast-specific protein-1 promoter were purchased commercially (Jackson, 012641) (FSP1cre)+/- and crossed with tdTomatolox-stop-lox mice, also purchased commercially (Jackson, 007914) and (FSP1cre)+/- ; tdTomatolox-stop-lox and FSP1cre-/-; tdTomatolox-stop-lox mice were bred in-house on a C57BL/6 background (Figure 1A,B,C). Fibroblast-specific protein 1 is an endogenous protein expressed on roughly 72% of fibroblast and represents an effective cre driver in dermal tissue20. Mice were group housed and given ad libitum access to food and water. Room temperature was maintained at 21 ± 2 °C. While we used C57BL/6 crossed male and female mice at 8-12 weeks, we do not believe the age, sex, or genetic background are necessary requirements to run multiphoton experiments. Mice were deeply anesthetized immediately after the experiment and euthanized.\n1. Preparation of drugs\nPrepare a 5 µg/20 µL solution of lipopolysaccharide-FITC (See Table of Materials) in sterile 1x PBS (pH 7.4). Vortex the stock solution at medium intensity for minimally 30 seconds to ensure homogenous mixing for an equal concentration throughout the solution before pipetting (LPS is a glutinous molecule).  \n\tNOTE: Do not place LPS into a glass container, if possible, use siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Keep on ice until use.\n2. Imaging set-up\nSet up the multiphoton system (see Table of Materials) for two-color imaging. This requires the use of two separate excitation lasers (see Table of Materials), a GFP/RFP filter cube set (see materials table), and a 25x (1.05 NA) water-immersion objective (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: Users can alter these settings to better suit alternative setups and multiphoton microscope capabilities. These are the parameters used in the experimental protocol. See Table of Materials for specific details.\nPlace a stereotaxic apparatus (see Table of Materials) on the stage of the multiphoton microscope. Connect this to an anesthesia delivery machine (see Table of Materials) to ensure the animals are anesthetized for the duration of the experiment. Place a piece of matte black paper on the surface of the apparatus as a connection point for the mouse paw.\nSelect the resonant scanner with a fixed scan area of 512 µm x 512 µm.\n\tNOTE: Do not perform the experiments in this protocol using a galvanometer scanner. Due to the slower sample rate, there will be distortion in z-stack time-lapse videos due to the respiration of the animal that is unavoidable.\nTune the two excitation lasers to the excitation wavelengths of GFP and RFP, 930 nm and 1100 nm respectively, and direct the light path of both excitation lasers to the single objective using a dichroic mirror of 690-1,050 nm allowing the 930 nm-tuned excitation laser to be reflected to the main scanner and the 1,100 nm-tuned laser to pass directly into the main scanner (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: It is possible to alter these excitation wavelengths depending on the user's setup.\nSet the laser power of FITC to 5% and GFP to 20%.\n\tNOTE: This setup provides an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in these experiments. Detect signal via multi-alkali photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs); however, GaAsP detectors may be used instead in very high-sensitivity experiments.\nPrepare the room for imaging under dark conditions without stray light.\n3. In vivo imaging",
    "Place the mouse into the induction chamber of the anesthesia delivery system and use 5% isoflurane (see Table of Materials) at a 2 L/min flow rate of oxygen to place the mouse under deep anesthesia.\n\t NOTE: It is highly recommended to wear all appropriate PPE during the experiment.\n\t\nTransfer the mouse to the stereotaxic apparatus with access to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia throughout the experiment. Reduce the isoflurane to 1.5%-2% and keep the flow rate constant.\nFirmly affix the hind paw to a piece of black paper with black tape on areas both proximal and distal to the area of interest (this reduces the effects of mouse respiration on image quality), making sure the plantar surface of the paw is unobstructed and facing up towards the objective. Ensure that the head of the mouse is stable within the nose cone attached to the apparatus.\n\t\tNOTE: Monitor the mouse for any signs of distress or dehydration throughout the experiment and adjust isoflurane accordingly.\nPlace a generous amount of sterile water-based lubricant (gel, see Table of Materials) on the plantar surface of the paw and touch the objective to it in order to create a column of liquid between the paw and the objective.\nUse the FITC excitation light to focus into the dermal layer of the paw. Ensure that tdTomato-tagged fibroblasts are visualized before continuing on (this step is important in determining the correct focal plane to image).\n\tNOTE: The dermal layer of the paw is about 100-150 µm into the paw.",
    "Image the area of cells located just below the plantar surface of the hind paw with both the 930 nm and 1100 nm-tuned lasers and acquire a 15-minute time-lapse of about 5-10 z-slices at approximately 1 µm per slice to establish a representation of the environment prior to injection with LPS-FITC.\nPerform an intraplantar injection of 5 µg/20 µL LPS-FITC on the mouse’s hind paw using a 25 µL glass Hamilton syringe (see Table of Materials) and 30G needle (see Table of Materials), taking care to not disturb the position of the paw.\nImage an area of cells located just below the plantar surface of the hind paw with both the 930 nm and 1100 nm-tuned lasers and acquire a 60-120 minute time-lapse of about 5-10 z-slices at approximately 1 µm per slice to identify uptake of LPS-FITC by cells.\nSubscription Required.
