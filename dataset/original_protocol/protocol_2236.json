This method for tissue preservation overcomes the limitation of specimen transportation time and enables wider application of the TIL analysis method.\nTumor tissue preservation.\nGently rinse the fresh specimen with saline to remove blood from tissue and place into a TTPR tube.\nMake sure the sample is completely immersed in the TTPR solution, and then close the cap tightly.\nPlace the TTPR tube with specimen in a styrofoam box filled with crushed ice and store the box at 2°C–8°C for up to 72 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1843-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Box preparation for TTPR preservation\n(A) TTPR tubes are placed in a styrofoam box filled with ice.\n(B) The lid is sealed with plastic tape.\nNote: Rinsing step with saline can be skipped unless an obvious blood contamination is seen. If using surgically resected samples instead of biopsy, the tissue samples should be cut into small pieces of biopsy size (approximately 5 mm3 as shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) before placing sample into TTPR for preservation. Up to 100 mg of tumor tissue can be preserved in a TTPR tube (20 mL).\nNote: A styrofoam box or the substitute should be filled with as much ice as possible, and the lid should be sealed with plastic tape (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Size of the box should be large enough to keep ice during the storage time.\nTumor tissue dissociation and isolation\nTiming: 60 min",
    "This step describes the approach to dissociate tumor tissue to obtain single-cell suspensions. The expected outcome is to extract a sufficient number of various types of immune cells although other types of cells which comprise the tumor microenvironment including tumor cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial and endothelial cells are also isolated simultaneously. We show data of isolated TILs with this method in comparison with the conventional mechanical dissociation method, which was reported previously (Sugiyama et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Saito et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The cell number and the immune phenotype of cells isolated from multiple types of tumors, various tissue sizes and different preservation time are presented.\nNote: All reagents are stored at 4°C or on ice unless otherwise specified. Sample incubations and centrifugation are performed at 4°C or on ice unless otherwise specified.\nTumor tissue dissociation.\nPrepare 1× TTDR by adding 5 mL of TTDR reconstitution buffer at 20°C–25°C to each TTDR vial and incubate for 5–10 min at 20°C–25°C. Mix well by pipetting and transfer reconstituted TTDR to a 15 mL conical tube containing additional 5 mL of TTDR reconstitution buffer. Keep it aside at 20°C–25°C while preparing the sample. Do not leave the reconstituted TTDR at 20°C–25°C longer than 30 min prior to use.\nNote: Make sure that dried reagent at the bottom of the vial is completely reconstituted.\nCentrifuge the TTPR tube containing the tissue at 300 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nAspirate the supernatant down to approximately 0.3 mL in the tube.\nCut tissue into small pieces (around 0.5–1.0 mm per side) using scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Critical: Excessive cutting with scissors may increase cell death. Cutting time should be usually about 20–40 s and no longer than 90 s when the scissor stroke is about 100 times per 60 s. In the case of hard tissues and/or large tissue size, place tube on ice for about 1 min to cool down and resume cutting.\nPlace the tube at 20°C–25°C and add 5–10 mL of 1× TTDR at 20°C–25°C into the tube, rinsing the scissors while adding it.\nNote: We recommend 5 mL of 1× TTDR for up to 50 mg and 10 mL for up to 100 mg. Insufficient volume of 1× TTDR may cause poor cell recovery.\nClose the cap tightly and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 15 min on the nutator. Gently tilt and check every 5 min that the tissue pieces are not stuck to the walls of the tube without touching the solution.\nDuring the incubation, place a 50 mL conical tube with a 40 μm cell strainer directly on ice and add 10 mL cold stop buffer to equilibrate the filter membrane.\nCritical: Incubation time with TTDR should not exceed 20 min.\nNote: The use of a 40 μm cell strainer is recommended to eliminate cell aggregates and/or tissue debris as much as possible, as the purpose of this protocol is mainly to isolate immune cells for flow cytometry analysis. Please choose a larger pore size strainer if you need to isolate larger cells as well.\nAfter the incubation, place the incubation tube at 20°C–25°C and immediately add 5 mL cold stop buffer to the tube and the cap.\nCell isolation.\nImmediately decant the solution in the cap to the tube, and then transfer the solution into the strainer.",
    "Note: Pour the solution into the strainer slowly while avoiding overflowing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Exercise caution with mucosal samples (e.g., colorectal tissues) since they may be stickier and often disrupt the flow of the solution from the strainer.\nAdd an additional 10 mL cold stop buffer in the TTDR incubation tube for rinsing and decant the solution into the strainer.\nLightly grind the pieces of tissue on the strainer using the top of the syringe plunger for 20–30 s (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAdd an additional 8 mL cold stop buffer in the strainer, rinsing the tip of the plunger.\nCentrifuge the tube with the strainer at 400 × g for 2 min at 4°C to drop the remaining solution into the tube.\nRemove the strainer and close the cap tightly.\nMix by inverting of the tube 10 times.\nCritical: The mixing step is indispensable to achieve optimal cell recovery.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 12 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving approximately 5 mL in the tube. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nResuspend the pellet and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube.\nRinse the original tube with 4–5 mL of Stain Buffer (FBS) and transfer to the 15 mL tube. Repeat this step; total volume is 13–15 mL.\nClose the cap tightly and invert the tube at least twice.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving approximately 100 μL in the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in a total of 2–5 mL Stain Buffer (FBS), and pipette appropriate volume of the cell suspension for cell count.",
    "Note: We recommend hemolysis of cell counting portion if the suspension looks reddish or pinkish. Up to 5 × 106 viable cells can be stained in a tube in this protocol. Optimization of antibodies and reagents are required for your staining panel.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving 100 μL in the tube for cell staining. Pipette the cell suspension carefully and transfer the cell suspension to a 5 mL round bottom tube. The volume can be adjusted depending on the assay needs.\nNote: Leaving 50–100 μL in the tube is recommended for cell surface staining. Different types of tubes can be used although a 5 mL round bottom tube is recommended here. For isotype control staining, cell suspension has to be divided into two tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1843-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The protocol is optimized for flow cytometry analysis. The panel shown here is an example. You may set your own staining panel according to your study design.",
    "Note: All steps including centrifugation are performed at 4°C or on ice unless otherwise specified. Reagents are kept at 4°C or on ice unless otherwise specified. All incubation steps should be performed at 4°C or on ice and protected from light. We recommend using a steel tube stand for incubation on ice as it can cool faster and keep stable temperature during the incubation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nStaining for dead cell exclusion and blocking.\nPrepare FVS780 working solution by adding 28 μL DPBS(-) to a 2 μL FVS780 stock solution (dilute it 1:15).\nNote: Discard the remaining FVS780 stock solution once thawed.\nAdd 3 μL of FVS780 working solution to 100 μL TIL suspension, mix thoroughly by pipetting, and incubate for 10 min, protected from light.\nAdd 5 μL of human Fc Block to the tube, mix thoroughly by pipetting, and incubate for 10 min, protected from light.\nDuring the incubation, prepare the following mixture for staining cell surface molecules.\nAdd 10 μL of Brilliant Stain Buffer (BSB) Plus to a 1.5 mL microtube.\nAdd antibodies one by one in the tube containing BSB Plus. Lightly vortex the tube (∼ 1 s) each time an antibody is added. Spin the tube down when needed.\nVortex lightly and spin tube down after the addition of the last antibody.
