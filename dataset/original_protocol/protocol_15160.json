    "Part A: Immunohistochemistry\nPreparation of 96-well plate and prevention of background staining Punch skin biopsies are collected from human subjects and incubated for 12-24 hr in fixative solution (2% paraformaldehyde with 0.75 M L-Lysine solution (pH 7.4) and 0.05 mM sodium periodate) at 4 °C as previously described 8. Samples are then cryoprotected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 20% glycerol at 4 °C for up to 1 week, embedded in mounting media optimal cutting temperature (OCT), then sectioned into 50 μm thick sections on a cryostat. The protocol described below is designed for 8 skin sections, the maximum number of skin sections possible to undergo free-floating immunohistochemistry in one 96-well plate.\nDAY 1:\n1. Prevention of Non-specific Immunoreactivity in the Stratum Corneum\nLabel 96-well plate as shown in Figure 1.\nAdd 150 μl of Image-IT FX Signal (Image-IT), effective for blocking background staining 11,12, into each well in Row 1 of the 96-well plate.\nAdd 150 μl of 1X PBS into each well in Row 2 and 3 of the 96-well plate.\nAcquire two 50 μm sections per patient: one section from the biopsy taken at DL, one section from the biopsy taken at PT. An inoculating loop (LeLoop) is used to transfer sections from one rinse to the next to avoid morphological damage. Gently transfer each 50 μm section, using an inoculating loop, into an individual well of Row 1, containing Image-IT. Incubate sections in Image-IT for 30 min at RT on a flat rocker.\nRinse sections twice with 1X PBS (Rows 2 and 3) for 10 min at RT. Place well plate on a flat rocker between rinses.\n2. Preparation of 5% BSA Blocking Solution and 1% Rinsing Solution",
    "While biopsy sections are incubating in Image-IT, prepare 5% blocking solution (5% BSA, 0.3% TX-100, 0.1 M PBS- Vortex solution until BSA completely dissolves).\nAdd 150 μl of 5% BSA blocking solution into each well of Row 4.\nUsing an inoculating loop, transfer sections into individual wells of 5% BSA blocking solution. Incubate sections in 5% BSA blocking solution for 1-2 hr at RT on a flat rocker.\n3. Preparation of 1% BSA Rinsing Solution and Dilution of Primary Antibodies\nWhile sections are incubating in 5% BSA blocking solution, prepare 1% rinsing solution (1% BSA, 0.3% TX-100, 0.1 M PBS- Vortex solution until BSA completely dissolves).\nWhile sections are incubating in 5% BSA blocking solution, dilute primary antibodies in 1% rinsing solution.\n \nFor eight sections (8 x 150 μl = 1,200 μl) a total of 1,200 μl is needed. The primary antibodies are made up in 1,500 μl (about 20% extra volume).\nDilutions of the primary antibodies: PGP, 1:500; Trk A, 1:500 in 1% BSA rinsing solution.\n4. Incubation of Sectioned Biopsies in Primary Antibody\nAdd 150 μl of diluted primary antibodies into the designated wells of the 96-well plate (Row 5).\nTransfer sections from 5% blocking solution (Row 4) into the designated primary antibody wells (Row 5).\nSeal the 96-well plate with parafilm and aluminum foil to avoid drying and light exposure.\nIncubate the 96-well plate O/N at 4 °C on a flat rocker.\nDAY 2:\n5. Rinse Biopsies in 1% BSA Rinsing Solution\nAdd 150 μl of 1% BSA rinsing solution into each well in Row 6, 7, and 8.\nRinse sections three times with 1% BSA rinsing solution (Rows 6, 7, and 8) for 1 hr each time at RT. Cover well plate with aluminum foil and place on flat rocker between rinses.",
    "6. Dilution of Secondary Antibodies\nWhile sections are incubated in the last rinse of 1% BSA rinsing solution (Row 8), dilute secondary antibodies in 1% BSA rinsing solution:\n \nFor eight sections (8 x 150 μl = 1,200 μl) a total of 1,200 μl is needed. The secondary antibodies are made up in 1,500 μl (about 20% extra volume).\nDilutions of the secondary antibodies: for PGP (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit, 1:250), for Trk A (Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-goat, 1:250) in 1% BSA rinsing solution.\n7. Incubation of Sectioned Biopsies in Secondary Antibody\nAdd 150 μl of diluted secondary antibodies into their designated wells of the 96-well plate (Row 9).\nTransfer sections from 1% BSA blocking solution (Row 8) into secondary antibody well (Row 9).\nSeal the 96-well plate with parafilm and aluminum foil to avoid drying and light exposure.\nIncubate sections in the designated secondary antibodies O/N at 4 °C on a flat rocker.\n8. Rinse Biopsies in 1% BSA Rinsing Solution\nAdd 150 μl of 1% BSA rinsing solution into each well in Row 10, 11, and 12.\nRinse sections three times with 1% BSA rinsing solution (Rows 10, 11, and 12) for 1 hr each time at RT. Cover well plate with aluminum foil and place on a flat rocker between rinses.\n9. Preparation of Microscope Slides and Mounting Sectioned Biopsies\nWhile biopsy sections are incubating in the last rinse of 1% BSA rinsing solution (Row 12), prepare microscope slides.\nPlace 50 μl of 1% BSA rinsing solution on one slide at a time.",
    "Remove sections from 1% BSA rinsing solution (Row 12), and place it in the 50 μl drop of 1% BSA rinsing solution on the designated microscope slide. After optimizing the position of the section, remove excess 1% BSA rinsing solution with a bulbed glass pipette, taking precautions to avoid touching the specimen.\nNOTE: Make sure section is not folded over; the specimen should be flat against the surface of the microscope slide.\nPlace 1 drop of Prolong Gold antifade mounting reagent with DAPI near the biopsy on the microscope slide. Take a 22x22 mm microscope glass coverslip and gently place it over biopsy and a drop of Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI drop. Repeat for each section.\nLet microscope slides dry O/N at RT in dark.\nNOTE: Remove any air bubbles using a pipette tip. Wipe away excess Prolong Gold antifade reagent.\nPart B: Confocal Imaging\n10. Confocal Imaging\nImage fluorescence signals using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X oil-immersion (1.3 NA) objective and zoom two times with FluoView version 5.0 software.\nUse Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 647 to excite the 543-nm HeNe green laser and the 633-nm HeNe Red laser, respectively. The Alexa Fluor 488 signal is represented by a green look up table (LUT) and the Alexa Fluor 647 by a red LUT.\nSet the confocal apertures for each detector at 400 μm to enhance signals. Sequential scans should be taken at a resolution of 1,024 x 1,024 to maximize signal separation.\nCapture three-dimensional z-series using 1.2 μm z-step intervals (based on the optimal scan unit calculated by the FluoView software) with Kalman averaging (two frames).\nPart C: Three-dimensional Visualization and Animation\n11. Three-dimensional (3D) Visualization and Animation",
    "Open Fluoview files in Imaris x64 software (version 7.3, Bitplane AG) to visualize the 3D image sets.\nAdjust display as needed to enhance contrast of the nerve specific signal.\nCreate a surface to visualize the dermal-epidermal boundary. Use the Contour tool in draw mode to draw the boundary.\nAssign a semi-transparent surface to the boundary in order to see the underlying fluorescent signals.\nCapture still images of the 3D fluorescent signals to create Snapshot images of the 3D movie.\nUse the Animation feature to create a 3D movie. The images can be rotated 360 degrees several times to show each signal separately and merged (Figures 2, 3, and 4). Set animation to create movies consisting of 200 frames animated at 15 frames per second. Save each movie as a raw AVI file.\nCompress the final AVI movie with VirtualDub software (version 1.9.4).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
