    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of live imaging dish\nTiming: ∼20 min\nTurn on the metal bath and heat to 37°C to melt the LIG by heating it on the metal bath for 10 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The temperature used to melt the LIG may increase to 40°C to prevent the LIG from solidifying too quickly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Prepare live imaging dish\n(A) Melt the LIG by heating it on the metal bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n(B) Cut a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip into two pieces from the middle.\n(C) Drop 10 μL of melted LIG onto the dish.\n(D and E) Quickly cover the LIG with a pre-cut coverslip.\n(F) Repeat steps (C-E) and cover the other pre-cut coverslip, spacing the two coverslips approximately 5 mm apart.\nUsing a glass cutter, cut a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip into two pieces from the center (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The thickness of our coverslips is about 0.14 mm, and the coverslips are cut to make room for the dissected intestine. The coverslip can be cut with a glass cutter, or simply break the coverslip in half by hand (be careful not to injure your hand, and some of the coverslip may break).\nPipette 10 μL of melted LIG into the lumox dish 50 and quickly cover it with an 11 mm × 22 mm coverslip (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E).\nRepeat step 3 to place another coverslip, keeping the two coverslips approximately 5 mm apart (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: Providing an ideal environment for the intestine is critical for prolonging the survival time of the dissected pupal guts, and the live imaging dish we prepared here is air-permeable and nutritious, which is beneficial for the development of the dissected guts.",
    "Transfer the stage pupa to a dissecting microscope\nTiming: ∼5 min\nUse the brush to gently pry several properly staged pupae from the side of the vial (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Prepare pupae for dissection\n(A) Gently lift the staged pupae from the side of the vial.\n(B) Transfer these pupae to the dissecting plate.\n(C) Pupae prepared for dissection under a dissecting microscope.\n(D and E) Dorsal and lateral views of male and female pupae at 46 h APF and 52 h APF (arrow indicates meconium). Typically, males have a darker yellow tail color and are smaller individuals compared to female pupae of the same developmental stage.\nTransfer these pupae to the dissecting plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPlace the pupae under a dissecting microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: We can get the exact developmental time of the pupae we want to study by timing from the white pupae. Since the developmental stages of the pupae are different at different times, we can also determine if the pupae are developing normally by the morphology (e.g. 46 h APF Drosophila eyes are yellowish, while at 52 h APF eyes deepen in color in the yw, hs-Flp; esg-Gal4, 10XUAS-Myr::tdTomato; pros::GFP/TM6B.Tb) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nDissect the pupa to obtain the pupal midgut\nTiming: ∼5 min\nAdd 40 μL of LIB to the center of a dissecting plate and transfer one pupa into the LIB under a dissecting microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dissect pupal midgut\n(A) Add 40 μL of LIB to the center of a dissection plate and transfer the pupa into the LIB.\n(B) Zoom view of a pupa ready for dissection.\n(C) Using a dull flat-ended forceps to gently grasp the anterior part of the pupa.",
    "(D) Using another pair of fine-tipped forceps, with the forceps open, press down very gently on the top of the meconium.\n(E) From the insertion position, divide the pupa into two parts, taking care not to pull the midgut apart.\n(F) Remove the head of the pupa by holding the head and neck of the pupa with two pairs of forceps and pulling in opposite directions (as indicated by the arrow).\n(G) Peel off the anterior shell.\n(H) Peel off the posterior shell.\n(I) Gently rinse the midgut by aspirating LIB through a 200 μL pipette to flush the midgut out of the pupal stage tissue.\n(J) A dissected female midgut.\n(K) A dissected male midgut.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, with the anterior of the pupa facing left if dissecting right-handed (right if dissecting left-handed), zoom in to enlarge the view of the pupa (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nGently grasp the pupa from the anterior part using one pair of blunt, flat-ended forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nUsing another pair of fine-tipped forceps, with the forceps open, gently insert one tip of the forceps onto the top of the meconium (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D, and 4E).\nOnce the tip is inserted approximately one-third to one-half of the way down the pupa, pull back to expose the midgut, being careful not to break it.\nRemove the head of the pupa by holding the head and neck of the pupa with two pairs of forceps respectively and pulling in opposite directions (arrow indicated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nUse the flat-ended forceps to gently press down on the surface of the pupa to hold it in place, and use the fine-tipped forceps to peel off the anterior shell (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nRepeat step 14 to peel off the posterior shell (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).",
    "Gently rinse the midgut by aspirating LIB through a 200 μL pipette to flush the midgut out of the pupal stage tissue. At this point the midgut is attached to the crop and reproductive system (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nNote: When using a new strippette tip, the midgut can easily adhere to the tip of the strippette. Washing the strippette tip 3 times with LIB before starting the experiment can greatly reduce the occurrence of this situation.\nNote: This method is specific for dissecting pupae between 46 h and 52 h APF. For dissecting other developmental stages: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nMount the pupal midgut on the live imaging dish\nTiming: ∼10 min\nWashing the 20 μL strippette tip 3 times with LIB. Then, gently aspirate the dissected pupal midgut (in LIB) under the microscope using a 20 μL pipette gun.\nPlace the live imaging dish under a stereo microscope and transfer the dissected pupal midgut (together with associated tissues in LIB) to the gap between the two coverslips using the pipette gun (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Mount of pupal midgut\n(A) Transfer of the dissected midgut to the live imaging dish.\n(B) Zoom view of the area indicated by the arrow in (A).\n(C) Replace LIB with LIG.\n(D) Add LIG between the two 11 × 22 mm coverslips and cover the midgut with the 22 × 22 mm coverslip and press it with forceps to stabilize it.\n(E) Zoom view of the midgut mounted in (D), an air bubble under the slide but not on the midgut does not affect the survival and imaging of the midgut.\n(F) Seal these coverslips with halocarbon oil 27 (dashed lines indicate the range of oil).",
    "Add 10 μL 37°C LIG to the transferred midgut, gently mix with LIB, aspirate and discard 10 μL of the mixed liquid. Adjust the position of the midgut so that it is not folded (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nRepeat step 19 twice.\nNote: The operator should complete steps 17 to 20 within 1 min; otherwise, the LIG will solidify before the experiment is completed.\nAllow the LIG to solidify for 2 min at 25°C.\nAdd 20 μL of 37°C LIG to the space between the two 11 × 22 mm coverslips and quickly cover the midgut with a 22 × 22 mm coverslip, gently pressing the 22 × 22 mm coverslip with forceps to bring the coverslip as close to the midgut as possible (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E).\nAfter 2 min, when the LIG has stabilized, seal the 22 × 22 mm coverslips with approximately 80 μL of halocarbon oil 27 using a 20 μL pipette gun to prevent water evaporation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nLive imaging of the pupal midgut under a confocal microscope\nTiming: ∼3 h, varies by experiment\nThe live imaging dish is placed without a lid, with the coverslip upside down so that the objective touches the coverslip (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Live imaging of pupal midgut\n(A) Pupal midgut mounted on a coverslip and imaged by inverted confocal microscopy.\n(B) Zoom view of the imaged mounted dish.\n(C) Imaging areas are indicated by rectangles.\nImage the mounted live imaging dish on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective using the Immersol 518 F imaging medium (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B). Use definite focus to avoid focus drift, acquire time-lapse images using ZEN 2.1 with time-lapse module.",
    "Take an image of the pupal midgut from the parts indicated by rectangles (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nNote: The laser wavelengths of the green and red channels are 488 and 561, with a laser power of 2% and 0.2%, the detection wavelengths are 410-525 and 580–700, respectively, these channels are taken in frame, 8–12 μm z-stack images (2 μm intervals) of 512 × 512 pixels (0.198 μm × 0.198 μm) are acquired every 60 s with a pixel time of 1.03 μs.\nAdjust the total imaging time according to the requirements of the experiment and imaging.\nNote: Imaging the midgut can last for 3 h or longer. We choose 3 h because after 3 h of imaging we can hardly detect the pISC divisions This section images the ISC division in the Drosophila pupal midgut at 25°C. Experiments can also be performed at temperatures between 18°C and 29°C, if required.\nWhen live imaging is complete, place the mounted dish in 50°C hot water for 5 min to melt the LIG, then rinse the dish with water, dry, and reuse.\nNote: An example of live imaging of the pupal ISC division is shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. A non-inverted microscope can also be used for live imaging of the pupal midgut.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3162-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
