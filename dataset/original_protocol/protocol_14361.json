    "Sperm are collected from 8-16-week-old CD-1 male mice. Animal experiments were approved by Weill Cornell Medicine's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Day prior to assay\nPreparation of sensor cartridge and extracellular flux analyzer calibrant\nTo hydrate the sensor cartridge, remove the sensor cartridge from the XFe96 Extracellular Flux Assay Kit and place the sensor cartridge upside down next to the utility plate.\nFill a solution reservoir with 25 mL of double-distilled H2O using a multichannel pipette, add 200 µL of H2O to each well of the utility plate. Place the sensor cartridge back into the utility plate and incubate overnight in a 37 °C non-CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Cartridge needs to be hydrated for at least 4 h.\nAliquot 25 mL of the extracellular flux analyzer calibrant into a 50 mL conical tube and incubate it overnight in a 37 °C non-CO2 incubator.\nPreparation of ConA-coated microplates\nDissolve 2.5 mg of ConA in 5 mL of double-distilled H2O to prepare a 0.5 mg/mL (w/v) stock.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, fill each well of an extracellular flux analyzer 96-well plate with 50 µL of the 0.5 mg/mL Con A solution. Leave the lid open and let the plate dry overnight at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple plates can be coated at once and stored at 4 °C for up to four weeks until ready for use.\nPreparation of sperm buffer\nPrepare 250 mL of extracellular flux analyzer TYH buffer with low HEPES containing 138 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.7 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5.6 mM glucose, and 1 mM HEPES. Heat the buffer to 37 °C and adjust the pH to 7.4.\n2. Day of the assay\nPreparation for cartridge calibration",
    "Replace the H2O in the utility plate with 200 µL of XF calibrant per well and incubate for at least 1 h in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Instead of calibrant, sterile-filtered PBS, pH 7.4 can be used.\nHeat 50 mL of TYH buffer at 37 °C.\nGenerating a wave template for the extracellular flux analyzer\nTurn the extracellular flux analyzer on and allow the temperature to stabilize to 37 °C.\nOpen the wave software and design a new template by opening a blank template (see Supplemental File 1, wave template).\nOpen the Group definitions tab. Define assay media as TYH; pH 7.4 and cell type as mouse sperm, leave injection strategies and pretreatments blank. Create different groups for each assay condition; in this example, there are 6 different groups (TYH, TYH + db-cAMP/IBMX, 2-DG, 2-DG + db-cAMP/IBMX, Ant/Rot, Ant/Rot + db-cAMP/IBMX); dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) and 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to induce capacitation, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) as glycolysis inhibitor, antimycin A (antA) and rotenone (rot) as inhibitor of complex III and complex I of the electron transport chain.\n\t\tNOTE: To account for variability between wells, at least 7-8 wells per condition should be measured in parallel.\nOpen the Plate map tab and define the plate map by assigning groups to specific wells.\n\t\tNOTE: The four corner wells (A1, A12, H1, H12) will be filled with TYH buffer (no sperm) and will later be used for background subtraction.\nOpen the Protocol tab, add 4 different measurement cycles, select the respective port and edit the measurement details (Figure 2, Table 1). Highlight measure after injection and do not highlight equilibrate.\nSave the assay template, fill out the project summary and define the saving location for the results file.\nPreparation of compounds to load into sensor cartridge",
    "Prepare 2 mL of 50 mM db-cAMP by dissolving 9.8 mg of compound in TYH buffer and add IBMX to a final concentration of 5 mM.\n\t\tNOTE: IBMX has the tendency to precipitate after being diluted in TYH buffer. Precipitates can be dissolved by vortexing and incubating the TYH/db-cAMP/IBMX solution in a 37 °C heat block for 5 min.\nPrepare 1 mL of 500 mM 2-DG by dissolving 82.1 mg of compound in TYH buffer.\nPrepare 1 mL of 5 µM of AntA/Rot by diluting both drugs in TYH buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Compounds are diluted 10-fold by injection into the extracellular flux analyzer cartridge; therefore, be sure that injection solutions are 10x more concentrated.\nIsolation of mouse sperm\nAnesthetize 3 male mice between 8 and 16 weeks by isoflurane and sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation after no response to toe pinching was detected. Remove the cauda epididymides and vasa deferentia.\nPlace each cauda in 500 µL of prewarmed TYH buffer in 24-well plate well, immobilize the cauda to the bottom of the plate using a pair of forceps and open the tissue by making 5-7 small incisions with feather scissors.\nTransfer the plate immediately into a non-CO2 37 °C incubator and let the sperm disperse for 15 min.\nLoading of the sensor cartridge\nTwo port-loading guides for port A and D and port B and C are provided in the Extracellular Flux kit. For loading a specific port, remove the lid from the sensor cartridge and align the letter of the respective port loading guide with the upper left corner of the cartridge. While injecting, use the fingertips of the non-injecting hand to hold the port loading guide in place and insert the pipette tips vertically into the port loading guide holes.",
    "Port A: Using a multichannel pipette, inject 20 µL of the TYH buffer into every column.\nPort B: Inject 22 µL of TYH buffer into column 1-4, inject 22 µL of 500 mM 2-DG into column 5-8, and 25 µL of 5 µM AntA/Rot into column 9-12.\nPort C: Inject 25 µL of TYH buffer into every column with odd numbers, inject 25 µL of 10 mM db-cAMP/ 500 µM IBMX into every column with even numbers.\nPlace the sensor cartridge with the calibration plate into the extracellular flux analyzer and start the assay. Calibration takes 10 - 15 min.\nPreparation of sperm plates\nDissolve 45 mg of BSA in 15 mL of TYH buffer (3 mg/mL w/v) and prepare three aliquots of 3 mL BSA/TYH solution each in 5 mL centrifuge tubes.\nCombine two sperm wells each in one 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, count the sperm using a hematocytometer and dilute the sperm to a concentration of 2 x 107 sperm/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Use cut pipette tips for pipetting sperm to avoid damaging the cells.\nCentrifuge the sperm for 3 min at 700 x g, remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of TYH buffer. Repeat the centrifugation step, remove the supernatant, and transfer each sperm suspension aliquot into one 5 mL centrifuge tube with 3 mL of BSA/TYH.\nPlace 180 µL of TYH buffer into each corner well (A1, A12, H1, H12) of a ConA-coated plate. Place 180 µL of sperm suspension into each empty well of the ConA-coated plate (1.2 x 106 sperm/well).\nCentrifuge the sperm plate at 250 x g for 1 min, rotate the plate by 180°, and centrifuge again at 250 x g for 1 min (lowest braking rate 1).",
    "Remove the calibration plate from the extracellular flux analyzer and add the sperm plate. Continue the assay.\nData extraction and analysis\nAfter finishing the assay, remove the cartridge, open the results file, click the Export tab and export the completed run as a GraphPad Prism file (Supplemental File 2: Primary example data used for Figure 3).\nDuplicate the ECAR and OCR file by clicking on the New tab and then the Duplicate Family… tab (Figure 3A).\nDelete the first 7 rows of data (Figure 3B).\nNormalize to the data point before the cAMP/IBMX injection by baseline subtracting row 1. Click on the Analyze tab, then on the Remove baseline and column math tab. Highlight Selected row(s): First Row, Calculation: Ratio:Value/Baseline, and Subcolumns: Ignore Subcolumn. Click OK (Figure 3C).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
