Rinse three times in DDW followed by three rinses with absolute analytical reagent (ABS AR) ethanol.\nPass each coverslip briefly through the flame of a Bunsen burner two or three times for 1 - 2 s, and then leave to incubate overnight in 24 well plates with 1 mL poly-L-lysine 0.01% solution diluted 1:5 in borate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4). Then rinse coverslips in DDW three times and leave with 1 mL PM per well in a standard 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nPreparation of coverslips for 1D cultures.",
    "Clean glass coverslips by immersion in a base piranha solution consisting of 75 mL DDW, 25 mL 25% ammonia solution and 25 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide. Place solution with the glass coverslips on a heating plate at ~ 50 °C for 30 min and then dry the glass coverslips with nitrogen.\nCoat coverslips first with a thin chrome film (99.999%) of 6 Å thickness followed by a 30 Å layer of gold (99.999%), using either vapor or sputter deposition.\n\t\t\nTo achieve a sputtering rate of 0.05 – 1 Å /s use a sputtering machine with 2 e-beams and a vacuum system of 260 l/s with target sizes 2\" and 4\". Use a rotation stage that can go from 0 – 100 rounds per minute (RPM).

Place coverslips in the solution for 1 h. Dry coverslips with nitrogen.",
    "Mechanically etch the desired pattern by scratching the bio-rejection layer22. Do this using a pen plotter, where the pen is replaced by an etching needle. Scratch the pattern through the metal layers to reach the underlying glass. Control this process by a computer to achieve a replicated desired pattern. Patterns formed by this process are demonstrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\nPrepare a bio-compatible layer of 100 mL D-PBS, 3.5 g tri-block co-polymer, 35.7 µL/mL fibronectin and 29 µl/mL laminin.\n\t\t\nSterilize coverslips in ultra-violet light for at least 10 min.

Incubate coverslips in PM overnight. Coverslips are now ready for cell plating.\nPerform dissection according to standard procedures that have been published extensively previously23,24.\n\t\nIn brief, extract hippocampus or cortex from rat embryos, typically at day E19, or from mice, typically at day E1723,24.\nDissociate cells first in papain solution for 20 - 30 min, followed by mechanical trituration24 with glass pipettes whose tips are fire polished.\n\t\tNOTE: If the cells come from genetically modified mice then the tissue from each embryo should be maintained in a separate 1.5 mL plastic tube during the entire process.\nCount cells with trypan blue before seeding.\n\t\tNOTE: For genetically modified animals the counting should be done separately for each embryo.\nFor 2D cultures, seed mouse neurons at 750,000 and rat neurons at 850,000 cells per well.

Electric Stimulation of Cultures",
    "NOTE: The basic setup for electric stimulation is shown in Figure 1. A cover slip on which the neuronal culture has been grown for about 14 days is placed in a Petri dish under a fluorescence microscope. Electrical activity of the neurons is imaged using calcium sensitive dyes while a voltage is applied via two pairs of bath electrodes that are positioned outside the culture. The electrodes are driven by a signal generator whose output is amplified by a dual channel amplifier. Voltage control for stimulation is preferred over the more standard current control25,26 because the electric field vectors are determined directly, thus enabling straightforward vector addition and combination. This does require a careful check of the uniformity of the electric field, which can be performed over the whole sample for the case of voltage control. When using voltage control care should be taken to avoid any ground loops and the homogeneity of the electric field should be verified (see 2.2 below).\nFor electric stimulation with a homogeneous electric field use a pair of parallel electrode wires.\n\t\nUse electrodes made of platinum with a thickness on the order of 0.005'' (127 µm). When used with the 13 mm coverslips, ensure that the distance between the two electrodes is around 11 mm, and position the electrodes 1 mm above the culture.\n\t\tNOTE: To make the electrode holder (Figures 5A and 6A) use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Drill narrow holes through the PTFE to insert the electrodes. The device should be higher than the extracellular solution so that the top end, where the electrodes are exposed, will never come in contact with the solution. For insulation, use epoxy glue on any part of the electrode leads that might be exposed.",
    "Use a square pulse shape with a 50% duty cycle, with no DC component to avoid electrolysis. Vary pulse duration between 10 µs and 4 ms to cause effective stimulation without burning the culture. Ensure that the amplitude is in the order of ± 22 V (see Figure 5). The square pulse can be observed on an oscilloscope connected in parallel to the electrodes.\n\t\tNOTE: For easy programming of any desired waveform, use a commercial waveform editing software (see Materials list). Enter graphically the desired waveform and send it to the waveform generator.\nTo test for field homogeneity use a probe electrode. Use a grid of at least 1 mm x 1 mm to allow the probe to be moved in the area between electrodes and measure electric potential.\n\t\nMeasure electric potential. Use imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54357/54357equation1.jpg to calculate the electric field. Use one of the electrodes as a reference electrode. Measure the electric field with varying pulse durations between 100 µs to 4 ms (see Figure 5B for an example of 100 µs pulse duration) to verify that the field is homogeneous within the range of stimulating durations.\n\t\tNOTE: See Figure 5D for an example of a measured electric field homogeneity when the pulse duration was 1 ms.\nUse 2 perpendicular pairs of bath electrodes to produce more complicated electric field shapes, and to be able to orient the field in different directions (see Fig. 6B). The device with 2 pairs of electrodes will be used, and the signal on each pair of the electrodes will be observed on two separate oscilloscopes.",
    "Position the electrodes 1 mm above the culture and at a distance of 10 - 11 mm from each other. Make sure that both electrode pairs are floating (have no ground connection), and do not have any common ground by measuring the resistance between any set of electrodes and verifying absence of short circuits between any of the electrodes. Verify that all equipment used, which is connected to the electrodes (such as the oscilloscopes, the amplifiers, the signal generators, etc.) is floating with respect to ground by checking that all equipment is floating and that none of the reference electrodes is touching any grounded equipment.\nTo change field orientation, vary the amplitude of the voltage fed to the two electrode pairs with respect to each other (see Figure 7A). For example, for 0° use ± 22 V on the electrode pair which are perpendicular to the pattern and 0 V for the other electrode. For 45°, use ± 15.6 V on both pairs of electrodes with no phase lag, for an amplitude vector sum of 15.62+15.62=222.\nTo apply a rotating field use one single waveform of a sine voltage pulse and one single waveform of a cosine voltage pulse to the two pairs of electrodes to produce a fixed amplitude rotating electric field (see Figure 6B).\n\t\tNOTE: As can be viewed in Figure 6B, when using one cycle of a sine wave with ± 22 V in one electrode and one cycle of a cosine wave with ± 22 V in the other electrode, the vector sum is a rotating electric field with the cycle duration same as the sine and cosine waves, and with an amplitude of ± 22 V.",
    "To measure and calculate Chronaxie and Rheobase of axons in the neuronal culture vs. dendrites in the same culture perform the following steps.\n\t\nUse a calcium sensitive fluorescent dye for calcium imaging as described in the Table of Materials/Reagents and in 1.5) with a 1D culture patterned on thin (170 µm), long (10 mm) lines. Calcium sensitive dye will be applied to the culture, and incubated for 45 minutes. The dye will be washed by replacing with a fresh recording solution.\nDisconnect the network to achieve population statistics of the direct response to electrical stimulation, without the effect of synaptic transmission. To do so, apply a combination of 40 µM of bicuculline, which blocks the inhibitory action of gamma-Aminobutyric acid-A(GABAA) receptors, 10 µM of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), to block the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) and kainate receptors and 20 µM of (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The blockers will be added to the recording solution.\nApply a square pulse as described in 2.1 and 2.3 with varying time durations between 100 µs and 4 ms. The signal can be observed on the oscilloscope.\nUse a fluorescence microscope with an image acquisition program (see 1.5) to monitor the intensity of the calcium transients at several ROIs, each containing a few hundred neurons. Acquire images using a sensitive EMCCD camera (see Materials list), capable of an image acquisition rate of at least 20 frames per second. The change in light intensity is proportional to the amount of neurons which were stimulated. Estimate the fraction of stimulated neurons using the relative change in intensity.",
    "For each pulse duration (100 µs to 4 ms), change the amplitude of the voltage applied to the electrodes starting at a voltage where no change in intensity is seen (a few Volts), to the voltage where the changes in intensity due to the applied voltage has saturated (Up to ± 22 V).\n\t\tNOTE: The intensity change will be distributed as a cumulative Gaussian5 with respect to the applied voltage for stimulation for each time duration of the voltage pulse.\nFit a cumulative Gaussian distribution for the intensity vs. the applied voltage for each duration and extract the Gaussian mean from this fit.\n\t\tNOTE: This mean is the representative voltage to which the neurons responded.\nAt the end of this process obtain for each stimulation duration a mean voltage to which the neurons responded. Use these pairs of durations and strengths to plot the Strength-Duration curves (see Figure 7).\n3. Magnetic Stimulation of Cultures",
    "Note: The basic setup for magnetic stimulation is shown in Figure 2. On top right is shown an inverted fluorescence microscope that is used to image calcium sensitive dyes in the neurons. The magnetic coil (blue circles) is positioned about 5 mm concentrically above a neuronal ring culture, (blue outline). A pickup coil (red circle) on the circumference of the Petri dish monitors the voltage induced by the magnetic pulse. On the top left is shown the measured dynamics of the magnetic stimulator (MS) coil with a capacitor voltage load of 5,000 kV, as integrated from the pickup coil. The induced electric field (calculated for a ring radius of 14 mm) is depicted in green while the magnetic field is depicted in blue. On the bottom are shown images of the neuronal culture. At bottom left is a bright field image of a patterned 24-mm coverslip. The white areas are the neurons. The photographed pattern consists of concentric ring cultures with different radii. At the bottom right is a zoom onto a short segment of the rings, showing individual neurons. For a scale, the rings' width is about 200 µm.\nGrow the neurons in a circular ring pattern (etched as described in 1.2.5) for 1D culture stimulation. Use a calcium sensitive fluorescent dye for calcium imaging (as described in section 1.5) with a 1D culture patterned on thin (170 µm), long (10 mm) lines.\n\t\nUse a circular magnetic coil and position a Petri dish approximately 5 mm below and concentric with the coil. Use a custom coil of approximately 30-mm (inner diameter, 46-mm outer diameter) coil with an inductance of L = 90 mH driven by a homemade or commercial MS loaded with a maximal voltage of 5 kV.",
    "Discharge a high voltage and current through a conducting coil using a high-current-high-voltage switch to magnetically stimulate neuronal cultures. The magnetic stimulator (MS) can be built as described in21 using large capacitors, on the order of 100 mF, to obtain a high voltage of 1 - 5 kV. Alternatively use a commercially available MS (see  Table of Materials/Reagents).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a 0.254 mm thick and 6.35 mm wide polyester-coated rectangular copper wire to fabricate a homemade coil21. Turn wires on custom made frames, insulated with glass fibers and cast in epoxy (see Table of Materials/Reagents). Alternatively use commercially available coils (see Table of Materials/Reagents).\nUse rotating magnetic fields to stimulate 2D cultures.\nNow, use the rotating magnetic fields to stimulate 2D cultures. Fire the TMS with no culture in the dish, at different intensities, to show the linear correlation of the coil reading with the intensities.\nNext, while recording calcium transients with a neuronal culture, start firing the TMS at increasing intensities while recording both calcium transients and the coil. At first, network bursts observed as large calcium transients, should not synchronize with pick up coil TMS spikes. Continuing to increase intensity, at some point, the calcium transients start to become synchronized with the TMS spikes. Alternatively, or in addition, after achieving a synchronized response, start decreasing the intensities until synchronization is abolished, to determine the TMS threshold.\n\tNOTE: Conditions should be maintained strictly fixed for each of the setups, using the exact volume every time, the same vessels and exact coil positions and orientations.\n\t\nMount the pickup coil on the base of the recording dish so that it is in a plane parallel to the neuronal culture and in a fixed position with respect to the culture.",
    "NOTE: This ensures that the dependence of the positioning of the pickup coil with respect to the magnet is faithful to the position of the culture and that any discrepancies in the positioning will be negligible on the pickup coil readings.\n\t\t\nUse two independent coils that are positioned perpendicular to each other (Figure 8B) to generate a rotating magnetic and induced electric field. Connect each coil to its own MS. Ensure that the stimulators discharge similar currents at a phase lag of 90 degrees (Figure 10A), resulting in a rotating magnetic field which scans 270 degrees of the real space at a maximum field of ~ 270 V/m (Figure 10B).\nPosition the neuronal culture inside a spherical glass container filled with the external recording solution (EM).\nMonitor stimulation (change in fluorescence intensity of the neurons) with the camera as described in step 2.4.4.\nIn the case of the cross coils (Figure 8B), position the pickup coil parallel and at a specific distance below the neuronal culture. Carefully maintain this configuration throughout the experiments.\nCalculate analytically the electric field for 1D configuration by Emax=k1Br, where Emax is the maximum amplitude of the induced electric field and is directed along the tangent of the rings with radius r. B is the amplitude of the magnetic pulse and k1 is a dimensional proportionality constant that can be measured using the pickup coil (Figure 8A).\nUse a numerical simulation package (see Material list) to numerically simulate the electric field21.\nSubscription Required.
