    "Animal studies were approved by the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and by the Community of Madrid (ref. PROEX 155.7/20). All animal procedures conformed to EU Directive 2010/63EU and Recommendation 2007/526/EC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, enacted in Spanish law under Real Decreto 1201/2005.\n1. Obtention of AVC and/or OFTs (adapted from Xiao et al.25)\nSet up crosses in the afternoon between female mTmG and male VE-Cadherin-Cre-ERT/+.\nThe next morning, check for a vaginal plug. If there is a vaginal plug, count it as half a day (E0.5). Depending on the experiment of interest, count 8 days or 9 days.\n24 h before dissection, gavage the pregnant female orally with 50 µL of 5 mg/mL 4-OH-Tamoxifen diluted in corn oil.\n\t​NOTE: This dose will induce a limited amount of CRE-mediated recombination revealed by the presence of GFP-positive clones. The appropriate dose will have to be determined with each new batch of 4-OH-Tamoxifen.\nSacrifice the pregnant female at E8.5 or E9.5 by cervical dislocation.\nOpen the abdomen of the pregnant mice by using scissors and remove the uterus containing the embryos by using scissors and fine forceps.\nPlace the uterus in a Petri dish containing ice-cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBT).\nRemove the individual deciduae from the uterus under a dissecting microscope and using fine forceps.\nUsing fine tweezers, make an incision in the white part of the decidua, which is where the embryo is, remove it gently, avoiding pulling, and transfer the embryos to a new Petri dish with fresh PBT using a P1000 with the tip cut off, leaving a diameter large enough for an embryo to pass through without breaking.",
    "For genotyping, take a little piece of the yolk sac (0.5 mm2) or a piece of the tail (from the posterior end, counting 5 to 10 somites toward the head) and digest it in 100 µL of appropriate buffer.\nUnder the fume hood, transfer the embryos to ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) in sterile-filtered PBS in a microcentrifuge (2 mL) tube at 4 °C. Fix the embryos from 2 h to overnight (O/N) at 4 °C on a nutator.\nUnder the fume hood, remove the 4% PFA fixative from the microcentrifuge tubes without touching the embryos. Discard the PFA in an appropriate container.\nWash the embryos 5x in cold PBT for 10 min each at room temperature (RT).\nUsing fine forceps, remove the heart and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with fresh PBT.\n2. Whole mount immunofluorescence of the mouse embryonic heart\nReplace PBT with PBSTr (0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS) and wash the samples 3x, 5 min each, at RT on an orbital shaker.\nReplace PBSTr with blocking solution (PBSTr with 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum). Incubate from 2 h to O/N at 4 °C on an orbital shaker.\nReplace blocking solution with blocking solution containing primary antibody at the desired concentration (for anti-GFP or anti-VE-Cadherin antibody,use 1:1000 dilution). Incubate O/N on an orbital shaker at 4 °C.\nAfter O/N incubation at 4 °C, incubate for 1.5 h at RT on an orbital shaker. This step is very important to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nRemove and keep at 4 °C the primary antibody solution for up to three future experiments (add sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.02% for best conservation).\nWash the embryos 3x with PBSTr for 3 min each.",
    "Wash the embryos with PBSTr 3x for 30 min each on an orbital shaker at 4 °C.\nAfter the last wash, add 1 mL of blocking solution containing 1:1000 fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody against the primary antibody host species. Add also 1:3000 DAPI to the solution and incubate the embryos O/N on an orbital shaker at 4 °C.\nAfter O/N incubation at 4 °C, incubate for 1.5 h at RT on an orbital shaker. This step is very important to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nWash the embryos 3x with PBSTr for 3 min each.\nWash the embryos with PBSTr 3x-5x for 30 min each on an orbital shaker at RT.\n3. Mounting the mouse embryonic AVC or OFTs\nPut the hearts on a Petri dish (35 mm) containing PBS.\nUsing a tungsten wire and fine forceps, isolate the AVC or the OFT, and cut them longitudinally26.\nPrepare coverslips (22 mm x 22 mm), slides (60 mm x 24 mm), forceps, a P200 pipette with the appropriate tips, paper towel, and any aqueous glycerol-based mounting media for fluorescence, without DAPI.\nUsing a similar approach as in Xiao, C. et al.25, stick two strips of tape on a slide, separated by 0.3-0.6 cm in order to create a 3D room space that will allow the samples to conserve it original shape without squashing them.\nCarefully, and using the minimum volume of buffer, drop the samples onto the slide between the tape stripes using a cut P200 tip pipette. Use a dissecting microscope to increase the accuracy.\nUsing fine forceps, place the samples with the endocardium facing up (myocardium down on the slide).\nRemove excess PBS with a paper towel (avoid touching the sample), and then dry the samples for 1-2 min at RT to make the samples stick to the slide.",
    "Add 40 µL of aqueous-based mounting media on the tissue.\nPlace the coverslip over the two pieces of tape and lower it slowly onto the tissue with a needle or forceps. Avoid creating air bubbles.\nSeal the coverslip using one drop of nail polish on each vertex of the coverslip.\nOnce the nail polish is dry, clean the excess mounting media from the sides of the coverslip by using an absorbent paper towel. Avoid moving the coverslip.\nAdd nail polish along the coverslip edges to fully seal it, preventing mounting media evaporation.\nUsing an upright or an inverted confocal microscope, take images at 10x for general view and at 63x with 3x zoom for detailed images.\nSubscription Required.
