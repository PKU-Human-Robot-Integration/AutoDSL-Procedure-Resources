    "Place the plate into an incubator under standard tissue culture conditions and check for spheroids formation after 48 h.\nOptional step: Take pictures of the spheroids (40x) using a fluorescence stereo microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This method generates 96 spheroids (one spheroid/well) after 48 h (area 1-2 pixel2), and it is usually used for growth studies.\nHanging drop\n\t\t\nMix the cell suspensions (3.4 x 105 cells/mL) in a 1:1 ratio to get a final volume of 2 mL.\nUse a P20 pipette to seed the cell mixture in the form of 15 µL drops on the inverted lid of a 10 cm Petri dish.\nInvert the lid with the drops and add 5 mL of base medium (EBM-2) at the bottom of the dish to avoid evaporation of the drops.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: This method generates one spheroid/drop after 48 h. Ensure the drops are sufficiently apart from each other, so that they do not merge while switching the lid. Use more than one 10 cm Petri dish if necessary.\n3. Spheroid growth study\nPlate 100 µL of HUVECs and MCF-7 cell mixture (5 x 102 cells/well) in 96-well U-bottom plates and place them in the incubator.\n48 h after plating, check for spheroids formation with an inverted microscope (Bright field).

    "Use the Freehand Selection Tool to draw the border of the spheroids.\nTo calculate the area of interest and to separate the object or the foreground pixels from the background pixels, use the threshold function: Select the Image option, choose Adjust and click on Threshold.\nNow a Threshold pop-up window will open. The top bar indicates the minimum threshold value: set the value at zero. The bottom bar indicates the maximum threshold value: move the bar until the area of interest becomes completely red.\n\tNOTE: If the color is not red, select Red from the Threshold window.\nGo to Analyze | Set Measurements and select Area and Perimeter.\nTo measure the area of interest, select the Analyze option and use the Analyze Particles tool.

Spheroid's protein and RNA isolation",
    "Prepare cell suspensions at 3.4 x 105 cells/mL per cell type, mix them at a ratio of 1:1, and seed the cell mixture using a P20 pipette in the form of 15 µL drops on the lid of a 10 cm Petri dish. Invert the lid and place it in the incubator under standard tissue culture conditions for 96 h.\nUse 5-6 mL of PBS to collect spheroids in a 15 mL round-bottom Polystyrene tube using 5 mL sterile polystyrene pipettes.\n\tNOTE: It is also possible to use 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge the spheroids suspension at 250 x g for 5 min, and then carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 500 µL of trypsin (100%) and pipette up and down using a P1000 pipette for 30 s to disaggregate spheroids, achieving a cell suspension.\nNeutralize trypsin with 10% FCS medium, centrifuge the tubes at 250 x g for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nAccording to the manufacturer's protocol (specific kit for DNA-free RNA isolation), use 300 µL of RNA lysis buffer to lyse the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: Lysis buffer can also be directly added to the intact spheroids (no trypsin step required) to extract RNA. Add 300 µL of the lysis buffer to the pelleted spheroids, place tubes in ice, and triturate 10 times using a P200 pipette. Subsequently, isolate RNA as above. Spheroid dissociation may be needed if RNA recovery is low due to matrix interference.\nAlternatively, use 70 µL of the Lysis buffer for protein isolation. Homogenize for 2-4 s by sonication and determine the protein concentration according to the manufacturer's protocol using a BCA Assay Kit.\n\tNOTE: For protein isolation, pelleted spheroids can be lysed directly in lysis buffer followed by sonication. Use 25 µg of total protein to perform western blot.",
