    "Building optical setup for two-photon absorption measurementsOn the optical table set up and fix a femtosecond laser and a spectrofluorimeter, approximately 2 m apart.Remove the excitation lamp source (Figure 2), the mirror holder with two mirrors from the excitation monochromator (Figure 3), two lenses (in tubes) (Figures 4 and 5), optional beam splitter (Figure 6), and optional filter (Figure 7) from the excitation path of the PC1 spectrofluorimeter. The tube carrying the first lens and placed between the monochromator and optional beamsplitter must be removed as well (Figure 4). The second tube (empty), entering the sample compartment should be kept in place (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108232727_7780.jpgFigure 2.

    "Electrically disconnecting Left Emission Wavelength filter wheel from its stepper motor and connecting an additional filter wheel in excitation path with the stepper motor of the Left Emission Wavelength filter wheelIn a spare motorized filter wheel with 4 slots (ISS accessories) insert New Focus ND reflective filters with OD = 1, OD = 0.5, and OD = 0.3 in the slots # 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Leave the slot # 4 empty.Set a motorized filter wheel with these ND filters in the excitation optical path of PC1 right after the excitation monochromator and bolt it to the PC1 base (Figures 4 and 8).Connect the stepper motor of this filter wheel to the stepper motor jack of the ‘Left Emission Wavelength’ wheel (Figure 8).Put the excitation polarizer inside the optical path of the PC1.Turn on the PC1 and the computer controlling it.Create a file template in Vinci to measure the excitation power dependence of fluorescence in the left or right emission channels (Power Dependence file), Figure 9.

Right-click on the block called Fixed Parameter, click on Remove tab, and select Left Emission Wavelength box, then click OK. Right click on the block called Variable Parameters, click on Add tab and select Left Emission Wavelength function then click OK.

Use safety goggles.Set the first mirror M1 assembled in the holder right after the laser output (main beam) to turn the beam 90° in horizontal plane, parallel to the table, see Figure 1.Set first a half-wave plate and second a Glan Laser polarizer assembled in their rotation mounts after the M1 in the laser beam. Make sure the beam passing through both of them freely at its original height (as it came out of the laser).Turn the half-wave plate fast axis approximately to 45° (turning laser polarization from horizontal to vertical).Turn the Glan polarizer polarization axis close to vertical position.",
    "Use 3 mirrors (M2-M4) in their holder assemblies to direct the laser beam to the entrance aperture of the spectrofluorimeter (see Figure 1). Use mirrors M2 and M3 to make the beam height close to the height of the entrance aperture of PC1 and parallel to the table. Use M3 and M4 to direct the beam to the center of the entrance aperture of PC1 in the horizontal plane.Put the continuously variable neutral density filter in the beam after the M3 mirror.Put the flip mirror FM after M4 and flip it up.Put the power meter in the laser path after the flip mirror.Turn the continuously variable neutral density (ND) filter wheel to the maximum transmission position.Check that the laser power measured with the power meter is ~200 mW.Turn the continuously variable ND filter to attenuate the power to ~20 mW.In the VINCI Experiment software (ISS), go to Instrument Control tab and open the excitation shutter.In the same tab set the Left Emission Wavelength to position 4 (corresponding to empty slot of the excitation ND filter wheel.With mirrors M3 and M4 align the beam along the axis connecting the center of the entrance aperture of PC1 and the center of the window in the sample holder.Insert the 45-mm achromatic lens into a 22 mm-to-25 mm diameter adaptor tube (ISS accessory) and slip that adaptor with the lens over a 22-mm ISS tube, with the lens facing toward the sample position (Figure 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108233159_4395.jpgFigure 11.

    "Make sure that the laser beam is still pointing at the center of the opening of the sample holder (now with the 45-mm lens in). If necessary slightly re-align the beam with mirrors M3 and M4.Turn off the laser.In the right emission channel, insert the Semrock 745/SP filter into a filter slot.Disconnect the Laser from the computer with InSight GUI software and connect it through an RS 232 Serial port to a PC computer with the custom LabView program for tuning laser wavelength.Turn on the laser using the LabView program (Figure 12, Supplemental file 1 Laser Scan[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20191231/3498 Supplemental file 1 Laser Scan.docx]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108233251_2148.jpgFigure 12.

First make sure that continuously variable ND filter is turned to a fully transmitting position. Then, slowly rotate the half-wave plate (sitting immediately after the laser) until the laser power reads 200 mW. Use this position of the half-wave plate always, unless higher power is needed in experiment.Move the head of the power meter into the sample compartment and fix it (with the 1” post holder and short post holder base BA1S), such that its sensor is centered inside the round opening of the excitation path and facing the laser beam. Set the excitation polarizer to horizontal (90°) position with the Instrument Control of PC1 software. Adjust the angle of the external Glan Laser polarizer by turning its rotation mount, to a position where the power is minimum. Lock this position with a screw on its rotation mount.Slide the excitation polarizer out of the excitation optical path.",
    "Calibrate the ND filters at several laser wavelengths in the whole tuning range. Set a first laser wavelength at 680 nm. By using the Instrument Control function in Vinci, change the position of the Left Emission Wavelength filter from 1 to 4 and record the power for all 4 positions.

First, sample #1 and then sample #2 in Sample holder. Filters 770/SP and 633/SP (or 680/SP, 694/SP or empty) in the Left Emission Channel. Select the second short pass filter such that its cutoff wavelength is larger than fluorescence peak wavelength of samples #1 and #2.Put the cuvette with the sample #1 solution into the Sample position instead of Coumarin 540A solution.Cover the sample compartment with the lid.Measure the maximum signal at several wavelengths across the 2PA spectrum, e.g., 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 nm (using left PMT).Repeat the same for the sample #2.Adjust the laser power with the continuous ND filter such that the maximum signal across the 2PA spectrum of both samples amounts ~1 x 106 counts.
