    "1. Preparation of Primary Insect Spermatocyte Cell Culture for Micromanipulation\nSlide preparation\n\t\nObtain a 75 mm x 25 mm glass slide with a 20 mm diameter circular hole cut out in the center of the slide.\n\t\tNOTE: These were cut from a single sheet of window glass to be the size of a glass slide with a hole in the center.\nRun a 25 mm x 25 mm #1.5 coverslip through a Bunsen-burner flame for 2 s.\nApply vacuum grease around the edge of the hole in the glass slide\nPlace the coverslip on the hole as in Figure 1. Press it and make sure to form a tight seal.\nFlip the glass slide and fill the dissection well with halocarbon oil.\nSpermatocyte culture preparation for viewing on microscope\n\tNOTE: Here, we describe the culture preparation method using grasshopper or cricket cells. Testes contents of other arthropods can be cultured using a similar method.\n\t\nObtain subadult male crickets (or grasshoppers). Place a living insect in a refrigerator for approximately 2 min to cold-anesthetize it. Using dissecting scissors, quickly cut through the dorsal surface parallel to the long axis of the abdomen directly behind the wing buds. Manually squeeze the abdomen gently to push the testes through the cut in the exoskeleton (Figure 2).\nUsing forceps, place the isolated testes in a dissection well containing halocarbon oil.\nIf needed, view the testes under a dissecting microscope. Divide them into smaller pieces using fine-pointed forceps, removing any fat covering the testes, and use fine-pointed forceps to break up the testes (Figure 3A and 3B). Spread the testes contents under the oil, on the surface of the coverslip (Figure 3C).",
    "Spread the testes contents until the spread portion of the testis is barely noticeable to the eyes (Figure 3C). Use additional oil-loaded dissociation wells if needed.\n2. Micromanipulation\nProduction of the microneedle\n\t\nPlace one end of a (0.85 mm in outer diameter, 0.65 mm in inner diameter) glass tube in the flame of a Bunsen burner. Pull the end of the glass tubing in such a way that a 150° angle is formed, and an extended area of narrow glass tubing is created. Break the tubing in the thin region so that the thin region extending from the angle is approximately 10 mm long (Figure 4A).\nUsing a microforge (either custom-made according to Powell27 or commercially available-see Table of Materials), touch the tip of the glass needle to the hot platinum wire to melt the glass at the tip. Form an approximately 45° angle between the needle and the platinum wire of the microforge (Figure 4B). Pull the glass away from the hot wire, while shutting off the heat to the wire, forming a thin tip of ≤1.5 mm at the end of the glass needle.\n\t\tNOTE: The tip diameter will be difficult to measure, but a tip of this length is likely to produce a firm but flexible needle that will be appropriate for micromanipulation. Alternatively, a micropipette puller could be used to create glass tubing with an appropriate tip diameter (the experimenter will have to test different pulling recipes to produce an appropriately firm but flexible microneedle for the job). The needle could be placed in a holder that is shaped similarly to the manipulation needle created according to the method described above.\nPositioning the micromanipulator",
    "Place the prepared slide on the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. Find the dividing cells and center them in the field of view. Focus on the cells using the lowest magnification possible.\n\t\tNOTE: We used a 16X phase-contrast objective.\nPlace the microneedle in the needle holder on the micromanipulator.\nManually position the microneedle in the light path of the microscope so that the tip of the needle is illuminated by the light (Figure 5B).\nFocus the microscope several focal planes above the plane in which the cells lie.\nReposition the microneedle using the joystick controller at a low sensitivity several times to find the shadow of the needle in the X- and Y-axes. Continue to readjust the position until the position of the tip is visible. Adjust the position of the needle along the Z-axis until the needle tip is in focus.\nRefocus on the cells, then focus the microscope above the cell plane so that cells are just out of focus and invisible. Readjust the position of the needle so that its tip is in focus in this focal plane.\nAdjust the magnification of the microscope as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: We used a 100X 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) phase-contrast objective for the micromanipulation.\nAfter focusing on the cells using the higher-magnification objective, again focus the microscope above the cell plane so that the cells are just out of focus and invisible. Using a higher sensitivity setting, readjust the position of the needle so that its tip is in focus and centered in the focal plane above the plane in which the cells lie.\nRefocus on the cells, adjusting their position so they remain in the center of the field of view. The needle is now ready for the micromanipulation.\nMicromanipulation of chromosomes",
    "Using the same sensitivity setting as for the fine positioning at a high magnification, use the joystick to control the microneedle and push the chromosomes around inside the cell. Keep the needle tip above the plane of the cells.\nTo pull on or move a chromosome, focus on a chromosome near the top of the cell.\n\t\tNOTE: These chromosomes are easier to manipulate-manipulating chromosomes close to the coverslip makes it likely that the needle will grind into the coverslip, bursting the cell and ending the experiment.\nAdjust the Z-axis on the joystick to bring the needle tip into focus, and then move the needle tip with the joystick in X and Y. Place the tip of the needle directly on the chromosome to be manipulated and push it in the desired direction to allow the manipulator to reposition the chromosome.\nDepending on how far the chromosome is pushed, either apply tension to the chromosome or apply sufficient tension to detach a chromosome from the spindle. Once a chromosome is removed from a spindle, place it anywhere within the cell.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
