    "To label cellular components of interest with fluorescence, one can induce fluorescence-tagged proteins, which consists of each target component by Drosophila ectopic gene expression system, Gal4/UAS (Ashburner et al., 2004; White-Cooper, 2012). Alternatively, one may use strains expressing such fluorescence proteins continuously. In former cases, F1 progenies obtained by crossing bam-Gal4::vp16 with an UAS stock in which a cDNA encoding the protein with a fluorescence tag is placed under a control of the UAS sequences can be used for the time-lapse observation (see the schematic diagram for genetic cross in Figure 2). In testes cells in the F1 progeny males, expression of the fluorescence protein is specifically induced. The F1 progenies are reared at 28 °C (not beyond this temperature) in order to induce effective expression. For depletion experiments, another UAS stock carrying a transgene so as to induce dsRNA for each target protein is used instead of the UAS stock described above. After selection of male flies for the dissection, any preparation should be performed at an ambient room temperature below 25 °C. Note: One should adjust the room temperature around the microscope stage to 25 °C at least 1 h before observation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412203251_0998.jpgFigure 2. Genetic cross to generate F1 progenies producing fluorescence-tagged protein to label intracellular structures or F1 progenies expressing dsRNA to deplete a target protein. For labeling intra-cellular structures, induced expression of cDNA for a fusion protein X, which was consisting of the structures, with GFP fluorescence tag is carried out by Gal4/UAS system. For a depletion experiment, dsRNA representing a portion of target mRNA was induced instead of a fluorescence protein X.A pair of testis was carefully collected from pharate adults or newly eclosed adult flies (0-1 day old) described above at a room temperature (Figure 3).",
    "To collect adult testes, a movie uploaded to the internet web site would be useful as a guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ej8nF1YsRg[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ej8nF1YsRg]). The fly was placed ventral side up in BRB80 buffer on a plastic Petri dish under a dissecting microscope. Using a pair of the forceps, their abdomens were clamped by forceps and gently pulled the external genitalia in opposite direction by another one. After carefully removed associated accessory tissues away from a pair of testes, a pair of coiled testes were isolated as shown in Figure 3C. In a case of colchicine or cytochalasin D treatment, this dissection step was carried out in a BRB80 buffer containing 50 μg/ml colchicine and 10 μg/ml cytochalasin D, respectively. For a longer treatment, the spermatocytes isolated from testes can be incubated in M3 culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50% male cell extracts with a drug until 14 h (Kitazawa et al., 2012).Note: It is important to select young flies as much as possible because testes in aged flies contained less numbers of living spermatocytes instead of a large amount of sperm bundles. To collect young flies, all adult flies were discarded from fly culture tubes and newly eclosed flies were collected 12 h to 24 h after the discard. Remove a pair of testis gently and quickly using forceps. It is recommended that one complete the testis dissection (steps 1 to 4) within three minutes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412203432_8380.jpgFigure 3.

A reproductive tract collected from a normal pharate adult male. The male reproductive tract is consisting of a pair of testis, seminal vesicle (sv) and accessory gland (ag).",
    "Ejaculatory duct (ed) and ejaculatory bulb (eb) are also attached. Scale bar = 1 mm. C. A pair of testis isolated from an adult male after removal of associated tissues such as seminal vesicles and accessory glands away. Note that flies carrying a w mutation have colorless testes, while wild type testes display pale yellow as shown in this photo. Scale bar = 100 μm. D. A phase construct micrograph of a half pair of testis. There would be at least one or more meiotic cysts consisted of 16 primary spermatocytes undergoing meiosis I at one-third the away from the apical tip of the testis (arrow). The dissection should be carried out to tear the sheath open at this point. Apical tip (asterisk). Scale bar = 100 μm.One or two testes were transferred and laid out under mineral oil (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland) filled in open chambers on a clean glass cover slip (Figure 4). To prevent a drop of the oil to spread over the cover slip, it was surrounded by a 10 x 10 mm open frame that had adhesives on the bottom side (Gene Frame 25 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Waltham, USA). Extra liquid associated around the testis should be sucked up using a string of Kim-wipe carefully in order to avoid an unexpected slip down of the testis cells due to the liquid remaining beneath the cells during a time-lapse recording (Figure 3D).Note: It is recommended to collect intact and a health-looking testis complex in which ejaculatory pump is still actively contracting, if possible (Figure 3B). The testes punctured in the process of dissection should not be selected.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412203628_0588.jpgFigure 4. Schematic diagram of procedure to make cysts and cells within testis to spill into the mineral oil. 1.",
    "A half of testis pair illustrated here in a darker gray is located straight in a drop of mineral oil. One or two pairs of testis can be dissected in the drop of the oil. 2. Using a pair of tungsten needles, a sheath covering a testis is torn open from the apical tip (asterisks) until one-third of the testis. 3. By gently moving the testis sheath outward using needles, cysts consisting of 16 primary spermatocytes can be spread into the oil. The cells and cysts spread out are indicated in a light gray. On the other hand, each cyst should be kept intact as much as possible. The testis sheath is removed from the oil drop. 4. Using a pair of tungsten needles attached at the tip of holders in each hand, the sheath covering a testis is torn at a position at one third from the apical tip (arrow in Figure 3D) so as to allow a whole cyst consisting of 16 primary spermatocytes to release into the oil outside of the testis, while keeping intact. The oil should cover every testis cell at any time to prevent desiccation. Under these conditions, the cells within intact cysts remained viable for several hours (Kitazawa et al., 2012; Savoian, 2015). Note: A few germline stem cells are located at the apical tip of testis (Ueishi et al., 2009). And 16 cell cysts undergoing 1st meiotic division are localized around one third from the apical tip (Figures 3C, 3D and Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412203734_3035.jpgFigure 5.

    "(Inset) A premeiotic cell from a primary spermatocyte cyst at earlier stage. Note that it has a larger nucleolus (arrowhead). An intact 16-cell cyst is encircled by a yellow line. Bar = 10 μm.The cover slips set on the plastic cover slip holder are placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), outfitted with excitation, emission filter wheels (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence signals are collected using a 40x dry objective lens or a 100x oil immersion lens. As Drosophila spermatocytes are extremely sensitive to light (Rebollo and Gonzalez, 2004), one of most crucial points for the time-lapse imaging is to restrict the dose of irradiation to the living cell specimens as much as possible. Thus, after setting the holder on the microscope stage, one should look for prophase I cysts in which mature spermatocytes would initiate meiotic division I soon after using phase contrast optics under a transmission light through ND25 filter. In the prophase I cells, round-shaped multi-layers of nuclear envelope are formed, while oval-shaped elongated envelopes are observed at stages after prometaphase I. Primary spermatocytes within an intact cyst rather than cells stayed alone should be selected for the imaging as much as possible. A recording of time-lapse images started from timing when a fluorescence of GFP-Tubulin initiated to accumulate at spindle poles located opposite to each other (t = 0 min). Alternatively, one should start image collection from timing when nucleoli became almost disappeared under a phase contrast (t = 0 min) (Figure 6). Note: It is advisable to initiate time-lapse imaging within ten minutes from the initial step of the dissection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170412/20170412203903_2064.jpgFigure 6. Phase-contrast observation and fluorescence observation of testis cells including primary spermatocytes expressing GFP-βTubulin just before or at onset of meiosis I.",
    "Primary spermatocytes at prophase I or cells that would initiate meiotic division I soon after should be found by a phase contrast observation under a transmission light in order to avoid a prolonged irradiation of excitation light from a Hg lamp. The spermatocytes before and at prophase I show round-shaped cell morphology, while cells elongate to shape oval morphology as meiosis progress after prometaphase I. Premeiotic spermatocytes at S5 stage (small arrows) contain single larger nucleoli. As meiotic cell cycle progress, the nucleoli become smaller and disintegrated at S6 stage (arrows). The spermatocytes at prophase I, which contained tiny almost invisible nucleoli (arrowheads, A), also show that intensity of a fluorescence of GFP-Tubulin at the spindle poles separated apart toward opposite direction becomes vigorous (B). Asterisk (*) indicates bundled tails of elongated spermatids. Image collection can start from timing when a nucleolus has disappeared under a phase contrast (t = 0 min). In the case that a fluorescence of GFP-Tubulin is simultaneously collected, the recording should be initiated at timing when the GFP fluorescence becomes stronger at the poles (t = 0 min). Scale bar = 10 μm.At each 30-sec time interval, fluorescence-tagged proteins in the interested cells are excited by irradiation light from mercury lamp. Specimens are illuminated with UV filtered and shuttered light using the appropriate filter wheel combinations through a GFP/RFP filter cube. Near-simultaneous GFP and/or RFP fluorescence images are captured with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). For instance, a sequential collection of fluorescence images (10 msec exposure) and phase contrast images (300 msec exposure using ND12 filter) can be carried out for time-lapse observation to examine dynamics of cellular components in the primary spermatocytes. Image acquisition is controlled through the Metamorph software version 7.6 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).",
    "Note: One can adjust the focus and the microscope stage so as to make target cellular components clearly visible while looking at the computer screen.For a drug treatment, we carried out short term in vitro culture of primary spermatocytes (Rebollo and Gonzalez, 2004; Kitazawa et al., 2012).A testis complex attached with accessory gland, ejaculatory duct and pomp was collected from adult males. A living testis complex in which ejaculatory pomp was actively contracting should be selected and transferred into the M3 culture medium. For a longer incubation with special drugs such as Brefeldin A or Exo1, these inhibitors for intracellular vesicle transport can be directly added to the modified culture medium consisting of the M3 medium without bicarbonates containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50% male cell extracts as prepared in according with (Kitazawa et al., 2012).The testis was incubated in the culture medium for 14 h before isolation of spermatocytes at room temperature.Note: Using this protocol, one can carry out continuous observation of primary spermatocytes undergoing proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis for at least an hour without any distinct abnormalities (Kitazawa et al., 2012 and 2014; Hayashi et al., 2016). A time-lapse imaging can continue to the end of meiosis II through meiosis I without medium changes, although a prolonged incubation of the cells without media replacement may result in cellular toxicity due to extra accumulation of metabolic wastes."
