    "Ethical Statement\nTo study how sensory stimuli are represented by neuronal activity there is no alternative to the use of animals and the use of an in vivo approach. All the animals have been treated along the Italian and European Laws on animal treatment in Scientific Research (Italian Bioethical Committee, Law Decree on the Treatment of Animals in Research, 27 Jan 1992, No. 116). The National Research Council, where the experiments have been performed, adheres to the International Committee on Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS) on behalf of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO), the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS). As such, no protocol-specific approval was required. The approval of the Ministry of Health is classified as \"Biella 1, 3/2011\" into the files of the Ethical Committee of the University of Milan.\n1. Preparation of the Experimental Animals\nSelect male rats approximately 300-400 g in size.\nAnesthetize the rats for the experimental preparation.\n\t\t\nInject intraperitoneally a barbiturate solution (pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg for induction, 10 mg/kg for maintenance).\nCheck the anesthesia level by low threshold and high threshold mechanical stimuli over a paw ensuring that no retraction reflex occurs.\nPrepare the cranial skin by shaving the cranial vault accurately and then make an incision to expose the cranial surface.\nCannulate the trachea, by a tracheal cannula (inner diameter of 2 mm and outer diameter of 2.5 mm) fixing it by surgical ligation around the trachea itself.\nLaterally to the tracheal segment expose the jugular vein and cannulate it inserting a cannula (PE10) connected to a syringe fixing it by surgical ligation around the vessel.\nMount the rat onto a stereotaxic apparatus.\n\t\t\nSecure rat body and place in a supine position.",
    "Fix the head by ear bars and block the snout. Put one or two drops of local anaesthetic (lidocaine) in the rat's ear before placing ear bars.\nRegulate the temperature of the stereotaxic pad by an electronically controlled heating pad, maintaining the temperature at 37.5 °C.\nConnect the tracheal tube to the respiratory anesthesia device.\n\t\t\nSet the respiratory anesthesia device at 1 stroke/s delivering Isoflurane (2.5% 0.4-0.8 L/min) and O2 (0.15-0.2 L/min).\nClean carefully the cranial vault by a povidone-iodine topical antiseptic.\nTake a sterile scalpel and cut longitudinally on the midline from the basis of the snout to the angle of the occipital bone.\n\t\t\nDivaricate the wound borders by a retractor and fix them by two small cocker forceps applied to the wound borders.\nIdentify the periosteum by pointing a light over a skull vault observing the translucent surface. Scratch carefully the bone vault removing the periosteum and exposing the bone surface.\nProvide hemostasis with a cotton tip or surgical sponge over the bone surface if focal hemorrhages appear over the bone.\nWith a fine tip pen, identify the stereotactic point bregma at the cross point of the mediosagittal and coronal suturas.\n\t\t\nUnder surgical microscope control, identify the stereotactic area (S1HL) overlaying the somatosensory cortex contralateral to the posterior paw used for the experiment (Bregma, AP -0.5 to 1.2 mm, LL -2.3 to 2.5 mm).\nWith a fine tip pen draw the square perimeter delimiting the hole to be drilled.\n\t\t\nDrill a 9 mm2 hole on the previously identified blue square removing the bone tile.\nClean and absorb potential bone bleedings.\nCarefully remove the dura mater and cover the cortical surface with a surgical sponge soaked in artificial cerebrospinal fluid maintained at 37.5 °C.\nFix the electrode matrix to a holder connected to an electronic micromanipulator.",
    "Connect the head of the matrix to the preamplifier by a microconnector.\nDrive manually the electrode matrix (under surgical microscope control) up to the cortical surface (without touching it).\nSwitch on the amplifiers with auditory signal.\nDrive, by the electronic control, the electrode matrix to touch the cortical surface until the contact is reached, signaled by a clear noise sound change.\nPull down the electrode matrix by electronically controlled steps (2 μm/step) until a depth of 350-400 μm is reached (cortical layer IV).\nCheck the responsiveness of neurons by light touches on the contralateral posterior paw.\nAdjust the depth by a few further steps until a clear spiking response is observed.\nParalyze the rat by intravenous Gallamine thriethiodide (20 mg/kg/hr). Use refracted doses throughout the experiment to maintain curarization levels (0.2 ml/1 hr).\n2. Signal Treatment\nSet the software bandpass filter to [0.1 6000] Hz.\n\t\t\nRecord the neuronal signals of the 8 channels microelectrode matrix sampled at 32 kHz.\nAfter the acquisition ends, export the recorded signals into a binary format suitable for post-processing.\n\t\t\nPerform the spike sorting procedure by means of the Wave_clus toolbox11.\n3. Manufacture and Configuration of the Stimulation Device\nMount a cactus stalk (with blunted tip) orthogonally to the surface of a mid-range speaker gluing the stalk basis to the cap.\nProgram a microcontroller to deliver voltage pulses to a driver circuit for the speaker.\n\t\t\nProgram the microcontroller to deliver two paired pulses of current each second (see Figure 1C).\nAssemble the speaker and the microcontroller by means of a L293D h-bridge with basic passive components (see Figure 1A).\nConnect the microcontroller to a 12 V rechargeable battery.\n4. Stimulation Protocol\nGlue the dorsal aspect of the hind-paw to a solid frame, exposing the volar surface and avoiding articular torsions.",
    "Place the tip of the stimulation device onto the desired limb/paw position.\nSwitch on the stimulation device.\nOffline steps:\n5. Evaluation of Spike Responses\nFor each recorded neuron, compute the Shannon Mutual Information (MI) of the stimulus evoked spiking activity (stimulus category is either 1, stimulus, or 0, no stimulus).\n\t\t\nEstimate the conditional response probability p(r | s) where s represents the stimulus category and r represents the number of spikes emitted within a fixed time window.\nCorrect the MI estimate by using the shuffling procedure described9.\n6. Evaluation of LFP Responses\nFilter the recorded signal in the frequency range [0.1 100] Hz in order to obtain the LFP signal\nCompute LFPSNR, a measure of LFP responsiveness, as explained in the reference10.\n7. Model Estimation\nGenerate a model of the form\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50941/50941eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere the x arguments represent three different LFP features (x1the LFP itself, x2 its derivative and x3 the Hilbert phase of its derivative) and F is expressed as follows\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50941/50941eq2.jpg\n\t\tthe g coefficients are weights of a linear combination and f is an operator that takes either the absolute value, the power or the original value of each xi.\nUse the NSGAII algorithm to estimate the model parameters and operators by using the following three objects: i) a local, trial-to-trial basis, measure of fit imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50941/50941eq3.jpg, where Nsp and Nr represent respectively the overall spikes count and the length of the response vector; ii)a global measure of fit based on the average response imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50941/50941eq4.jpg where Nresp represents the length of the average response; iii) a measure of model complexity (see also)10 imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50941/50941eq5.jpg.\n8. Histological Confirmation\nSacrifice the rat.\n\t\t\nAt the end of experimental recordings, put the animal under deep gaseous anaesthesia (Isoflurane 2%, 4 L/min) and inject intravenously a barbiturate overdose (>50 mg/kg, pentobarbital). \nWait the heart arrest.",
