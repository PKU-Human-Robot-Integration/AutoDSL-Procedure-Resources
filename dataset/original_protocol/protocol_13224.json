    "All animal experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare Ethics Committee of Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Male C57BL/6J mice, aged between 8 to 10 weeks, were used in the study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). The major parts required for establishing the device are listed in Figure 1A.\n1. Preparation of the sleep deprivation device\nSecure one end of a 50 cm slotted steel channel at the middle of a 40 cm slotted steel channel with screws (see Table of Materials) to make a T-shaped structure; repeat the process and make two such T-shaped structures (Figure 1B-a).\nMake the two T-shaped structures stand upwards parallelly 30 cm apart, and connect the bottoms of the two T-shaped structures with a 30 cm screw-compatible steel cylinder (see Table of Materials) using screws (Figure 1B-b).\nPlace a steel rectangle platform (20 × 25 cm) (see Table of Materials) in between the two T-shaped structures (Figure 1B-c).\n\tNOTE: If ready-to-use steel rectangle platforms of the specified size are not available, one can make one by welding 2 mm thick flat steels.\nSecure each end of a 30 cm screw-compatible steel cylinder attached in the platform to two bearings fixed on each of the T-shaped structures at 10 cm down from the top (Figure 1B-d).\nSecure a motor mount (see Table of Materials) on one of the T-shaped structures at 25 cm down from the top using screws (Figure 1B-e).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, construction adhesive can be used to secure the motor mount on the T-shaped structure instead of crews.\nInstall a motor (see Table of Materials) on the motor mount with screws (Figure 1B-f).",
    "Secure a cooling fan (see Table of Materials) with self-locking bands on the T-shaped structure below the motor (Figure 1B-g).\nFix the bearing end of a connecting rod to a platform corner facing the motor using screws (Figure 1B-h).\nFix another end of the connecting rod to the shaft of the motor using screws (Figure 1B-i).\nDrill two 4 mm holes at each of the four corners of a standard mouse cage (see Table of Materials) using an electric drill, and drill two 4 mm holes and a lower 6 mm hole on the left side of the cage (Figure 1B-j).\nSecure the cage on the rectangle platform with self-locking bands through the corner holes (Figure 1B-k).\nDrill a 5 mm hole in the cap of a 50 mL centrifuge tube with an electric drill, and plug in the hole with a long nozzle equipped with a ball valve to prevent water leakage.\n\tNOTE: Hydrogel would be an alternative option for water supply if customizing water bottles is difficult.\nSecure the customized water bottle on the left side of the cage using self-locking bands through the two 4 mm holes, with the nozzle going through the 6 mm hole (Figure 1B-l).\nConnect the output electrical wires of the power brick adapter to the two terminals of the motor (Figure 1B-l).\n\tNOTE: There is no specific polarity requirement for connecting the wires to the motor terminals.\nConnect the input electrical wires of the power brick adapter to the time contactor (Figure 1B-m).\n2. Induction of sleep deprivation\nPress the rightmost plus sign buttons on the left and right halves of the time contactor (see Table of Materials), respectively, until \"M\" appears on the mechanical counters on both sides (Figure 1C-a).",
    "Press the middle plus sign buttons on the left and right halves of the time contactor until \"5M\" appears on the mechanical counters on both sides (Figure 1C-b).\nPress the leftmost plus sign button on the left half of the time contactor until \"15M\" appears on the left mechanical counter (Figure 1C-c).\n\t​NOTE: The time contactor will then be on for 15 min and off for 5 min in a cyclic mode.\nPut mice in the cage with water and food ad libitum.\nSupply the time contactor and the cooling fan with power.\n\tNOTE: The platform will now be rocking at 10 rpm.\nWeigh each mouse at Zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) every day.\n\t​NOTE: The light is on from 8 AM (ZT0) to 8 PM (ZT12).\n3. Oral glucose tolerance test\nMeasure the fasting glucose levels in fasted mice by sampling blood from tail veins.\nInject glucose solution into each mouse (2 g/kg body weight) intraperitoneally using 1 mL syringes.\nCollect blood samples through the tail vein, and test the blood glucose at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after glucose injection, respectively.\nPut the mice back into the cage with the food and water ad libitum after the test.\n4. Harvesting the brain tissues\nDecapitate the mice after adequate anesthesia by exposing them to isoflurane (2%) for 3-5 min.\nExpose the skull and make a 1 cm vertical cut at the skull using surgical scissors.\nRemove the skull using mosquito hemostats (see Table of Materials) to expose the brain tissue.\nGently move the whole brain out of the cranial cavity using curved tweezers.\n\tNOTE: Brain tissue should be removed according to local policies.\nWash the brain tissue using cold phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS, 4 °C).",
    "Snap freeze the intact brain tissue in liquid nitrogen and transfer the tissue to -80 °C for long-term storage .\n\t​NOTE: When stored at -80°C, the flash-frozen brain tissue is stable for at least 6 months.\n5. Detection of gene expression by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nThaw the brain tissues at 4 °C or on ice.\nTransfer the tissue to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and extract the total RNA using the TRIzol-based method13.\nMeasure the concentration of RNA using a spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials) after RNA extraction.\nPerform reverse transcription of the total RNA (1 µg) into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a commercial kit14.\nMeasure gene expression levels by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction15.\nSubscription Required.
