    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of liposomes for electron microscopy negative staining\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to prepare liposome which do not enclose Tb3+ ions. These liposome was used as a substrate for POR mediated lipid peroxidation and the damage was detected by electron microscopy.\nDissolve the soy phospholipid mixture and bovine cardiolipins from heart in chloroform (10 mg/mL stock solution) under nitrogen and store them at −20°C. Add 80 μL of soy phospholipids and 20 μL bovine cardiolipins into 500 μL of chloroform in a round-bottomed flask (10 mL).\nCritical: The lipid should be carefully covered with nitrogen to protect from oxygen. Even a small amount of oxygen would cause oxidative damage to the lipids with time.\nOptional: Argon could also be used to protect phospholipids from oxygen.\nNote: As this protocol is used for testing lipid peroxidation of PUFA phospholipids mediated membrane damage, it is critical to make sure PUFA phospholipids are included in the lipid mixtures. In this protocol, PUFA phospholipids were included in the soy phospholipid mixture and bovine cardiolipins. However, when using other phospholipids for example PUFA contained phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine are all optional. According to our previous research, when approximately 2% of membrane lipids are oxidatively damaged, the liposome membrane becomes permeabilized. Therefore, at least 2% of PUFA phospholipids should be incorporated into the liposomes. The higher the concentration of PUFA phospholipids, the more easily lipid peroxidation-mediated membrane damage occurred.\nEvaporate the chloroform using a vacuum rotary evaporator (BUCHI) using gentle and continuous rotation (150 rpm) under a water bath at 30°C to form an evenly spaced phospholipid film.\nCritical: Gentle and continuous rotation of the flask is critical for the formation of an even lipid film.",
    "Add 500 μL of buffer H (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) into the flask and the lipid film was detached by vortex.\nOptional: Sonication of the flasks also helps the detachment of phospholipids from the glass wall.\nNote: The buffer H was stored at 4°C until use.\nThe hydrated phospholipid was draw via syringe and subjected to extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane (100 nm) 30 times using a mini-extruder (Avanti) to generate morphologically uniform liposomes.\nCritical: The extrusion process must be slow and gentle, with an approximate speed of 100 μL per second.\nPause Point: The liposomes can be stored at 4°C for approximately one week.\nNote: Pre-warming of the mini-extruder on a 65°C block greatly facilitates the solubility of some phospholipids.\nInducing POR mediated oxidative breakage of liposomes\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to perform POR catalyzed redox reactions with liposome as the substrate.\nAdd liposomes (100 μg/mL), POR (100 nM), and ferric chloride (120 μM) to buffer L (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl) in 50 μL system in 1.5 mL tubes. Pass Oxygen (3 L/min) into the mixture via a thin needle for 10 s.\nCritical: The NaCl concentration in buffer H (inside the liposomes) is higher than in buffer L (outside the liposomes), which is critical for maintaining the morphology of liposome under electron microscopy.\nNote: The addition of oxygen should be done carefully to avoid spilling the reaction mixture.\nNote: The buffer L was stored at 4°C until use.\nNote: Appropriate controls were made: a negative control group with eliminated POR protein, a group with an equivalent amount of the POR Y178D mutant variant, and a group including the lipid peroxidation inhibitor Fer-1 (10 μM).",
    "Initiate the reaction with the addition of NADPH (50 μM) and reacted for 90 min at 15°C–25°C.\nNegative staining of liposomes and imaging under electron microscopy\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the method for negative staining liposomes for transmission electron microscopy.\nEM grid pre-treatment: the EM grid (ultra-thin carbon supporting films, 300 mesh) was discharged in a plasma cleaner (PDC-32G) with a current intensity of “Low” gear for 30 s.\nCritical: The pre-treatment of EM grid should be performed right before use and the grids are ready by the time the reaction (step 6) is done.\nOptional: Any plasma cleaner and glow discharge plasma would work as alternatives.\nLiposome adsorption: 5 μL of liposomes were added to the grid for 1 min to allow attachment. The remaining liquid was carefully removed by filter paper dabbing.\nCritical: The liposomes in the POR-free group can be difficult to attach to the EM grid. Glycerol (1% v/v) facilitate this process.\nOptional: An equivalent level of BSA (100 nM) may also facilitate liposome grid binding in the POR-free group.\nGently wash off Loosely attached liposomes, or other reaction system components with distilled water for 20 s, twice. Discard water via a filter paper.\nStain the bound liposomes with 5 μL 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s, 2 times. Discard the remaining uranyl acetate via filter paper, and the sample was allowed to dry at 15°C–25°C.\nPause Point: The stained EM grid can be stored for an extended period (several weeks) before electron microscopy imaging.\nNote: Liposomes were stained twice with uranyl acetate, because the remaining water on the sample would decrease concentration of uranyl acetate in the first staining process, and, further, to increase the staining depth.",
    "Normal or oxidatively damaged liposomes were imaged on a Tecnai T12 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 120 kV. Take the photographs on a Gatan 4k × 4k CCD camera (nominal magnification 26,000×).\nOptional: Any transmission electron microscope with a similar capacity would be a suitable alternative for imaging.\nPreparation of liposomes for leakage detection by spectrophotometry\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes how to prepare liposome enclosing Tb 3+ ions. These liposomes were used as substrates for POR or CYB5R1 mediated lipid peroxidation, and the leakage of Tb3+ ions from the liposomes was detected via spectrophotometry.\nDissolve the soy phospholipid mixture, bovine cardiolipins, and synthesized PUFA SAPE (18:0–20:4 PE) or saturated fatty acid (SFA) DPPC (16:0 PC) in chloroform (10 mg/mL each) under nitrogen and stored at −20°C. Add 100 μL of individual phospholipid, or different ratios of SAPE and DPPC combined phospholipids, into 500 μL of chloroform in a 10 mL round-bottomed flask. The evaporation of chloroform was then performed as described in step 2.\nTo enclose Tb3+ ions, the phospholipid films were hydrated and detached in 500 μL of buffer TL (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium citrate, 15 mM TbCl3). Liposomes were then prepared as described in step 4.\nCritical: Pre-warming of the mini-extruder on a 65°C block is required for the solubilization of phospholipids like DPPC.\nNote: The buffer TL was freshly prepared and stored on ice until use.\nUnencapsulated Tb3+ ions were removed by extensive washing with 8 cycles of 15 mL buffer L in 100 KD cut-off ultrafiltration tubes (Millipore) and centrifugation at 4 C, after which they were re-suspended in 500 μL of buffer L.",
    "Critical: The extensive washing of external Tb 3+ ions are crucial to a low background in the following assays. The existence of external Tb3+ ions can be detected by the addition 50 μM of DPA in the flowthrough buffer L and a subsequent increase in fluorescence signal (λex= 270/λem=620 nm) (see below).\nOptional: Centrifugation of the liposomes at 100,000 × g for 30 min, then washing the pellet 3 times is also feasible for obtaining external Tb3+ ions free liposomes.\nPause Point: The liposomes may be stored at 4°C for approximately one week.\nInducing POR/CYB5R1 mediated oxidative breakage of liposomes encapsulating Tb3+\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to perform the POR and CYB5R1 catalyzed redox reactions on liposomes encapsulating Tb3+.\nDilute liposomes encapsulating Tb3+ (100 μg/mL), oxidoreductase (100 nM), ferric chloride (120 μM), and DPA (50 μM) into 100 μL of buffer L. Pass oxygen (3 L/min) into the mixture via a thin needle for 10 s. Add nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (50 μM) into the mixture to initiate the reaction.\nNote: In the negative control groups, no oxidoreductase, NADPH, or ferric chloride were added. In some groups, WT or mutant POR proteins were included. When analyzing the additive effect of POR and CYB5R1, 100 nM each of the protein was added. In some groups, Fer-1 (1 μM) or Lip-1 (1 μM) were added.\nNote: NADPH is an electron donor for POR, and NADH is an electron donor for CYB5R1. When analyzing the additive effect of POR and CYB5R1, both electron donors were included in the mixtures.",
    "As soon as NADPH and/or NADH was added, the fluorescence signal (λex= 270/λem=620 nm) was measured via microplate reader as Ft 0. Then, the fluorescence signals were recorded at 20 s intervals for about 120 times (about 40 min), after which 1 μL of Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v) was added to the liposomes to completely release the Tb3+ ions. The fluorescence signal value achieved by Triton X-100 was recorded as Ft100. At each time point (Ft), the percentage of liposome leakage was defined as: Leakage (t) % = [(Ft-Ft0) / (Ft100-Ft0)] × 100.\nCritical: Previous research (Wang et.al., 2014) used emission wavelength λem=490 nm to detect the fluorescence signal of Tb3+/DPA chelates. NADPH has a strong signal under λem 490 nm but is not detected under λem 620 nm. Additionally, λem 620 nm gives a higher signal for Tb3+/DPA than λem 490 nm. Therefore we use λ em 620 nm in this assay."
