    "The experiments were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Hokkaido University, following the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. Female C57BL/6J mice (pregnant, 15.5 days) were used for the present study.\n1. Preparation of mouse primary cortical cultured neurons\nAdd 0.1 mg/mL of poly-L-Lysin in 0.1 M Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)-HCl (pH 8.5) into an 8-well (No.1.0) glass-bottom chamber (see Table of Materials). Incubate the chamber in a 37 °C incubator for a minimum of 1 h.\nRinse the chamber with sterilized water a minimum of three times and air-dry in a tissue culture hood.\nSacrifice the pregnant mice at 15.5 days by cervical dislocation, or following institutionally approved regulations.\nPinch the uterine horn containing the embryos, isolate the entire uterine horns using scissors, and immerse them in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice.\nIn cold PBS, isolate the embryos using sharp tweezers and remove all amniotic membranes from the embryos.\nWash the embryos again with fresh cold PBS.\n\tNOTE: During each isolation step, wash as much blood out as possible and ensure not to damage the vessels or embryos.\nPlace an embryo on a sterilized gauze in a cold Petri dish under light microscopy.\nIsolate the brain. Cut the embryo's head skin and skull using the tip of curved sharp tweezers. Remove the skin and skull to expose the top and sides of the brain.\nScoop out the entire brain using the curved part of the tweezers and immerse it in a Petri dish containing ice-cold 1x Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 5.3 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 39 mM D-glucose, and 0.5 µg/mL gentamicin; see Table of Materials).\nRepeat steps 1.7-1.9 until the required number of brains are obtained.",
    "NOTE: Typically, 5 x 106 to 2 x 107 cells per brain can be obtained.\nSeparate the cortex22 from the brains using tweezers in cold 1x HBSS and tear off the meninges from the cortex.\nTransfer the cortex to a new Petri dish containing cold 1x HBSS. Cut the cortex in half or into thirds using surgical blades.\nTransfer the cortex into a 15 mL centrifuge tube using tip-cut 1,000 µL tips and remove excess 1x HBSS.\nAdd 100 units of papain and 200 µg of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) diluted with 5 mL of papain dilute solution (5 mg/mL D-glucose, 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/mL L-cysteine in 1x PBS; see Table of Materials) per embryo, and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Invert the tube every 5 min during the incubation.\n\tNOTE: Preincubation of papain in papain dilute solution is recommended. Incubate for 5 min in a 37 °C water bath, then add DNase I.\nDiscard the solution. Add 2 mL of 20% heat-inactivated horse serum (see Table of Materials) in 1x HBSS. Incubate for 1 min.\nDiscard the solution. Rinse the tissue with 4 mL of 1x HBSS twice.\nDiscard the solution. Add 0.5 mL per embryo of plating medium (neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 supplement, 4 mM Glutamax, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin; see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: During steps 1.14-1.17, no centrifugation is needed as the cut cortex pieces sink to the bottom of the tube without it. Do not use an aspirator, and do not suck up the pieces.\nResuspend very gently with a cut 1,000 µL tip or 10 mL pipette 5 to 10 times.\nResuspend very gently with a 1,000 µL tip 10 times.",
    "Centrifuge at 250 × g at room temperature (20-25 °C) for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend very gently with 0.5 mL per embryo of plating medium using a 1,000 µL tip 10 times.\nPlace a 40 µm cell strainer on a 50 mL centrifuge tube, then filtrate the cell suspension by gravity flow. Collect the filtered cell suspension in the tube.\nCount the cells and plate into the chambers at 2 × 104 to 5 × 104 cells/cm2, with an appropriate volume of plating medium. An example of the density is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.\nAt day-in-vitro (Div.) 2, replace half of the medium with culture medium (neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 supplement, 4 mM Glutamax, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin) and add 5 µM of 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (see Table of Materials).\nAfter Div. 4, replace half of the medium with culture medium every 2 or 3 days.\n2. Transfection of plasmids to primary cultured neuron using the calcium phosphate method\nNOTE: The mentioned volumes are for a 0.8 cm2 well in an 8-well glass-bottom chamber (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 50 µL of DNA/CaCl2 solution by mixing 200 ng to 2 µg of a plasmid (APP-EGFP in pCAGGS, Alcα-EGFP in pcDNA3.118, or Alcβ-EGFP in pcDNA3.1; see Supplementary Table 1) encoding a fluorescence-tagged protein, 6.2 µL of 2 M CaCl2, and sterilized water.\nAliquot 50 µL of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) into new centrifuge tubes.\nAdd 6.2 µL of DNA/CaCl2 solution to 2x HBS solution. Mix gently by pipetting 10 times.\nRepeat step 2.3 until all the DNA/CaCl2 solution has been transferred.\nIncubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nCollect the culture medium in the glass-bottom chamber and replace it with fresh culture medium without antibiotics.\n\tNOTE: Keep the collected medium in the cell culture incubator until step 2.10.",
    "Add 50 µL of the DNA/CaCl2/HBS mixture per well dropwise to neurons. Culture for 1 h.\nDuring incubation, prepare acidified medium by placing a Petri dish containing DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium)/Ham's F-12 media in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter incubating for 1 h following transfection, rinse the primary neurons with DMEM/Ham's F-12 (acidified medium) 3 times.\nReplace the media with a mixture of half-collected media and half-fresh culture media. Culture until observation by microscopy at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n3. Observation of axonal transport\nPreincubate the chamber equipped with TIRF (total internal reflectance) microscopy (see Table of Materials) at 37 °C.\nIf the CO2 controller is equipped, the culture medium can be used as observation media under 5% CO2. If it is not equipped, replace the medium with a pH-stable medium, such as Leibovitz L-15 (see Table of materials), supplied with 4 mM Glutamax and 2% B-27 supplement.\nFind a transfected cell, then identify an axon. Increase the incident angle of the laser until the laser is completely reflected. Then, decrease the angle until all of the vesicles in the axon are visualized (pseudo-TIRF). Acquire images with a 200 ms exposure time for 150 frames (30 s).\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, pseud-TIRF illumination was used to capture all axon vesicles. Other microscopes equipped with high-speed capture systems can be used.\n\t​NOTE: Record the direction of the axon every time in the file name. The area of the initial axon segment or terminal axon area was avoided from the observation.\n4. Image processing\nOpen the acquired images using the MetaMorph software (see Table of Materials).\nOpen Tool bar > Measure > Calibrate distance. Enable \"apply to all open images\" and input the actual distance of a pixel.",
    "Open Tool bar > Display > Rotate. Enable the check box for \"all planes\". Rotate so that the axon is horizontal and the direction toward the axon terminal is rightward.\nOpen Tool bar > Regions > Create regions. Set the size of the region for clipping and click on Create. Place the frame that appears on the image on the axon area for analysis. Save the generated image sequence as a stack file.\n\tNOTE: Select areas that do not contain unfocused axons or debris.\nOpen Tool bar > Display > Graphics. Select Calibration bar to stamp the scale bar. Select Data/Time to add a time stamp to the images. Enable \"all planes\". Move the objects to the appropriate space and click on stamp.\nOpen Tool bar > Stack > Make movie. Input the appropriate frame rate and select AVI. Save it as a new file.\n5. Drawing a kymograph and detecting traces using KYMOMAKER\nDownload KYMOMAKER (see Table of Materials) and open \"Kymoanalysis.exe\" in the KYMOMAKER folder.\nOpen \"kymoAnalysis.exe\" to show the main windows (Figure 1A). Select File > Load and open the created AVI movie. A \"Preview\" window will appear (Figure 1B).\nIn the Generate Kymograph tab > trimming section, input the pixel numbers for trimming. Trimming is immediately reflected in the \"Preview\" window to allow easy adjustment (Figure 1C). Confirm that the entire scale bar and time stamp have been removed.\nClick on the Generate button to generate the kymograph (Figure 1C). KYMOMAKER detects the brightest pixel within each y-axis in the \"Preview\" window. Save the kymograph via  File > Save > Normal Kymograph.\nTo detect the low-intensity traces in the kymograph, click on Rotational Kymograph. Adjust the number in the \"Rotational Kymograph\" section and view the result by clicking on the rotational kymograph (Figure 1D).",
    "NOTE: \"Rotation (degree)\" is the interval of the degree for the Rotational Watershed algorithm21. For example, 10° means that the Watershed algorithm is performed every 10° 36 times, and the results are then combined in the \"Rotational Watershed\" window.\nTo detect the anterograde and retrograde traces in the kymograph, in the Detection tab > Target section, select original if the Rotational Kymograph has not been generated. Ensure that by selecting Rotation, the created Rotational Watershed is used to detect traces. Select Watershed in \"Detecting Method.\" Click on the Detect button to detect traces automatically.\n\tNOTE: Detected traces are drawn in the \"Working\" window. Turning \"Masking\" on draws traces on the original kymograph.\nDetect the anterograde and retrograde traces by entering a number into the Detection > Filtering > Velocity section (Figure 1E,F). Detect anterograde traces by entering 0.4 to 7.0 µm/s. Detect retrograde traces by entering −0.4 to −7.0 µm/s.\n\tNOTE: The setting for the lowest velocity depends on the definition of an immobile condition of vesicles. See step 6.7.\nSave the files.\n6. Determining the velocity\nOpen the MetaMorph software.\n\tNOTE: The \"manual tracking\" plugin in ImageJ can also calculate the velocities in the same ways.\nOpen the file created in step 4.4. Ensure that the calibration is adapted to the images.\nOpen Tool bar > Apps > Track Points. Click on Add Track. Find a moving vesicle that was anterogradely or retrogradely transported. Then, track the vesicle by clicking until the transport terminates. Click on Done.\nRepeat step 6.3 until all the vesicles have been tracked.\nClick on open log to open a CSV file. Then, click on log file to show data in the CSV file.\nSave the CSV file.",
    "To calculate segmented velocity unaffected by the pause, remove calculated velocities 0.37 µm/s or below in the \"velocity\" column.\n\tNOTE: Vesicles can move very shortly by anomalous diffusion, and they are not processed by motor proteins23. To avoid including these motions from the calculation of motor-drived velocities, the lowest velocity (1 pixel/200 ms) in this protocol is removed from the calculation.\nCalculate the segmented average velocity every five frames (a total of 1 s). Discard the last part of velocity if fewer than five frames are left.\nCombine all average velocities from one condition. Generate histograms to help visualize the distribution of speeds.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
