    "Assay plate preparationNGM agar plates for growth and assay (see Recipes)Prepare plates less than 1 week before assay. Keep plates sealed at 4°C before use.Prepare standard NGM plate media as per established protocol. Cool to 50°C.Note: We usually make about 20 plates per week when running assays. To pour this many plates, make 250 mL of media. Pipette 12 mL of media into 20 individual 10-cm2 Petri dishes.Note: It is important that there are no bubbles in the plate, as worms will burrow into these. Let cool for 3 h, and then store in a sealed plastic bag at 4°C.Use assay plates that are 2–5 days old. In our hands, both too-fresh and too-old plates impact assays.Worm preparationM9 buffer (see Recipes)Grow 3–4 plates up, containing gravid adult worms of each genotype/condition.Bleach these plates according to standard protocol in a 15-mL Falcon tube, to obtain clean eggs (Stiernagle, 2006).After the final wash, suspend eggs in 5 mL of 1× M9 and rotate overnight, to obtain synchronized L1 larvae.The next day, set tube upright ~30 min so L1s sink to the bottom of the M9, or spin them down at 300 × g for 1 min.Remove excess M9 with a glass pipette.Use a glass pipette to move worms from the tube onto a seeded NGM plate.Note: It is important to have enough worms to perform the assay (~200 worms per replicate). It is also important not to crowd the plate or starve the worms. Any amount of starvation after synchronization can alter the outcome of the assay. Grow the worms at the cultivation temperature being analyzed (typically 15°C or 25°C) until the worms have reached young adulthood (Table 1).Table 1. Approximate growth times for N2 from synchronized L1s to adulthood (Stiernagle, 2006)  table:\n﻿Cultivation Temperature,Time from L1 to young adult\n15°C,~96 h",
    "20°C,~60 h\n25°C,~48 h",
    "Note: This is usually the day after the worms are L4 larvae. The amount of time needed to get the worms to adulthood will vary with temperature. It is important to raise all control and experiment worms in parallel, so that they experience the same conditions and are at the same age when conducting the assay. Pre-assay preparationOne hour before beginning assay, remove assay plates from 4°C, and allow them to warm up to room temperature.Turn on the water pump and thermo-regulators. Before starting the assay, ensure that water is flowing, and that each side of the thermotaxis rig is at the correct temperature.The gradient for the assay is 1°C/cm, with the very center of the plate being 20°C. Adjustment of each thermo-regulator may be necessary to have this gradient. This results in the left most edge of the plate being at ~16.5°C, and the rightmost being at ~23.5°C.Performing the assayS-Basal buffer (see Recipes) Note: The next steps should be carried out as quickly as possible before the worms have time to adjust to room temperature. We typically get the worms from cultivation temperature to the thermotaxis rig in ~5–10 min (Steps 1–3 shown in Video 1; Steps 4–7 shown in Video 2).  <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Placing worms on assay plate. Remove the first plate of worms. Using a Pasteur pipette, place ~2 mL of room temperature S-basal on the plate and lightly shake, to allow worms to detach from the bacterial surface.Tilt the plate and pick up as much of the worm slurry as possible. Pipette into a microcentrifuge tube.Either allow the worms to settle to the bottom of the tube or lightly spin them down with a tabletop microcentrifuge for 3 s.Note: Depending on the centrifuge, spinning down the worms may damage them.",
    "If this is a concern, we recommend opting for letting the worms settle to the bottom of the plate. Gently pipette as much S-Basal off the worms as possible. The goal is to remove the maximum possible number of bacteria.Dispose of the S-Basal and gently fill the tube with clean S-Basal.Gently mix the worms and then spin down or allow them to settle.Pick up the worms in the pipette with minimal S-Basal.Hold the pipette upright for a few moments, to allow the worms to settle to the bottom.Pipette the worms (<200 worms) onto the center of the assay plate.Note: Worm density is critical. Both too sparse and too dense inversely impact assay fidelity. Further, too low and there won’t be enough worms to perform the assay. Too high will lead to the worms clumping together at the center of the plate. Take a Kim wipe and fold it in half along the crease. Take one of the creased corners and twist it to make a long point.Under the dissecting microscope carefully soak up the S-Basal from the center of the plate via the capillary action from the tip of the Kim wipe.Note: It is important to try and avoid the worms. They can be pulled into the Kim wipe or damaged enough to impair proper locomotion on the assay plate. We find that quick dabs around different edge-points of the drop works best. Soak up S-Basal until all worms are freely crawling out of the drop-site on the plate.Note: Do not pull up too much liquid, as this will dry and tear the surface of the plate. Worms can burrow into the plate through these micro-abrasions, complicating the assay. Using a pipette, transfer 5 mL of glycerol to the center of the back plate of the thermotaxis rig.",
    "Carefully lay one edge of the assay plate on the corresponding edge of the back plate. Slowly lay the assay plate onto the glycerol, giving it time to spread evenly and without bubbles on the bottom of the assay plate. Else, the air pockets can impede uniform gradient heat transfer.The plate should float on glycerol evenly along its entire bottom surface, including all edges.When the plate is all the way down, ensure that it is straight and properly fitted to the back plate.Begin a timer for 45 min.Tandem assay set-upWe run three trials of each condition on separate days. Each day, we include a wild type control and up to two test conditions.On each day, we set up each position in descending order from 1 to 3 (see Table 1). Each position is set up 10 min after the previous position, they are run in tandem for some time, and each plate removed after it has been on the rig for 45 min.To address variability between positions on the rig, for each trial we rotate each condition through each position on the rig (see Table 2).Table 2. Scheme for rotating each condition on the thermotaxis rig table:",

This will immobilize the worms for counting.When finished with the assay, clean the back of the plate with paper towels and 70% ethanol to remove residual glycerol.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.
