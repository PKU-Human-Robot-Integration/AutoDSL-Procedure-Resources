    "In silico splice analysis In many cases, initial in silico prediction of mRNA splicing of the single mutations might be helpful. To predict the potential effects on splicing of your mutation of interest use a human splicing finder software (e.g., http://www.umd.be/HSF3/[href=http://www.umd.be/HSF3/]).   Go to http://www.umd.be/HSF3/[href=http://www.umd.be/HSF3/] and select an analysis type. We recommend using the option ‘Analyze a sequence’.   Choose a sequence. We recommend using the option ‘Pasting your own sequence’. Paste the wildtype version of your sequence of interest into the provided box and click on ‘Proceed to analysis’. Note: Your sequence should contain at least 40 bp flanking the respective point mutation on both sides.   Click on ‘Perform a quick mutation’, type in the position of your mutation of interest relative to the sequence you have entered before and select the new nucleotide. Then click on ‘Proceed to quick mutation analysis’.   Human splice finder webserver output:   Click on ‘Raw Data Tables’ to analyze the effect of the entered point mutation in detail.   You are provided with five different data tables called ‘Potential splice sites’, ‘Potential Branch Points’, ‘Enhancer motifs’, ‘Silencer motifs’ and ‘Other splicing motifs’. Each of them shows the percental variation induced by the point mutation. Newly formed splice sites or motifs are indicated in green, a change in strength of an existing site or motif is indicated in light yellow.     Repeat the analysis for all point mutations of interest and select the ones predicted to affect splicing for further cloning.      Isolation of human genomic DNA for cloning of minigenes   Preheat one water bath to 65 °C and the other to 37 °C.   To collect buccal cells, scrape the inside of the mouth 10 times with a Buccal Collection Brush (provided in the kit, Materials and Reagents A3).",
    "Note: For best results, wait at least 1 h after eating or drinking to collect buccal cells.   Dispense 300 µl Cell Lysis Solution (provided in the kit, Materials and Reagents A3) into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Remove the Collection brush from its handle using a sterile scalpel, and place the detached head in the tube.   Incubate at 65 °C for 60 min to complete cell lysis.   Remove the collection brush head from the Cell Lysis Solution, scraping it on the side of the tube to recover as much liquid as possible.   Add 1.5 µl RNase A Solution (provided in the kit), and mix by inverting the tube 25 times.   Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubate for 1 min on ice to cool the sample.   Add 100 µl Protein Precipitation Solution (provided in the kit, Materials and Reagents A3), and vortex vigorously for 20 sec at high speed.   Incubate for 5 min on ice.   Centrifuge for 3 min at 13,000-16,000 x g to pellet the precipitated proteins.   Pipet 300 µl isopropanol and 0.5 µl Glycogen Solution (provided in the kit, Materials and Reagents A3) into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and add the supernatant from the previous step by pouring or pipetting carefully. Make sure not to transfer the protein pellet.   Mix by inverting the tube gently 50 times or by rotating it for 2.5 min at 20 rpm.   Centrifuge at RT for 5 min at 13,000-16,000 x g.   Carefully discard the supernatant, and drain the tube by inverting it on a clean piece of absorbent paper, taking care that the pellet remains in the tube.   Add 300 µl of 70% ethanol and invert the tube several times to wash the DNA pellet.   Centrifuge at RT for 1 min at 13,000-16,000 x g.   Carefully discard the supernatant.",
    "Drain the tube on a clean piece of absorbent paper, taking care that the pellet remains in the tube. Allow to air dry for 5 min.   Add 100 µl DNA Hydration Solution (provided in the kit, Materials and Reagents A3) and vortex for 5 sec at medium speed to mix.   Incubate at 65 °C for 1 h to dissolve the DNA.   Incubate at room temperature overnight with gentle shaking. Ensure tube cap is tightly closed to avoid leakage. Samples can then be centrifuged briefly and transferred to a storage tube.      Overlap extension PCR for construction and cloning of minigenes C1. Methodological description and design of overlap primers To enable minigene-based analysis of mutations on mRNA splicing, large introns can be shortened. In our recent studies, we validated that approx. 200 bp of the intronic regions flanking the exons are sufficient for correct mRNA splicing (Becirovic et al., 2016b; Nguyen et al., 2016).  To generate the appropriate minigenes via standard cloning procedures, an overlap extension PCR can be used. For this purpose, as a first step the respective exons including ≥ 200 bp of the flanking introns must be amplified via standard PCR. The primers used for this PCRs must encompass defined overhangs of approx. 20 bp. These overhangs are complementary to the corresponding PCR fragment to be connected in the second overlap extension PCR. These create 40 bp overlap regions used for the amplification of the two fragments. We applied this strategy for creating minigenes consisting of three native exons including two shortened flanking introns (Figure 2). However, this method is also suitable for the generation of minigenes with a random number of exons and shortened introns.   Design PCR primers to amplify one exon plus ≥ 200 bp of the flanking intronic regions.",
    "Check the melting temperature (Tm) using a Tm Calculator Software (e.g., NEB Tm Calculator).   To create the overlap regions, the primer must contain the approx. 20 bp long region complementary to the adjoining PCR amplicon (see Figure 2).  Example: When designing primers to amplify the second exon plus flanking intronic regions (amplicon #2), add the sequence of the final 20 bp in the exon 1 containing amplicon (amplicon #1) to the 5’ end of your forward primer. Next, add the reverse sequence of the first 20 bp of the exon 3 containing amplicon (amplicon #3) to the 5’ end of your reverse primer. These overlapping sequences will be needed for subsequent overlap extension PCRs.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228175112_2946.jpg Figure 2. Schematic of overlap extension PCR for creating minigenes consisting of three exons and two flanking introns that were shortened. The single amplicons are depicted in different colors. Restriction sites are shown in blue. Primers are depicted bicolored according to their templates and matching overlaps. Two PCR amplicons from step 1 serve as templates for the overlap PCR 1 and can be combined together in a random manner (e.g., amplicons of PCR 1 + PCR 2). The final overlap PCR 2 can be performed with the remaining PCR fragment (in this example, the amplicon of PCR 3). For all overlap PCRs, only the 5’ primer of the first and the 3’ primer of the second PCR amplicon should be used.    For the amplification of the first minigene exon: Add an appropriate restriction site to the 5’ end of your forward primer according to the restriction site of your expression vector (e.g., HindIII in pcDNA3.1). Consider adding an additional sequence (up to 4 bp) to the 5’ end of the restriction site for more efficient cleavage by the restriction enzymes.",
    "For amplification of the last minigene exon: Add an appropriate restriction site to the 5’ end of your reverse primer according to the restriction site of your expression vector (e.g., NotI). Consider adding additional up to 4 bp to the 5’ end of the restriction site for more efficient cleavage by the restriction enzymes.   Order PCR primers (approx. 0.05 µmol, at least HPSF purified) from commercial providers (e.g., Eurofins Genomics).    C2.

Load all of your PCR reaction on an agarose gel and check for correct amplification.   If amplification was successful, i.e., if you see a band of correct size, excise the band and purify DNA using the gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   Measure the DNA concentration using NanoDrop.   Repeat Overlap extension PCR to connect the new amplicon with the subsequent amplicon. For this, use the purified DNA of both amplicons as template; and the forward primer of amplicon #1 and the reverse primer of amplicon #3 as Overlap extension PCR primers.   Depending on the number of amplicons to be joined together, Steps 1-7 can be repeated.   Use the chosen restriction sites to clone your minigene into the respective expression vector using standard cloning techniques.   Check for the correct sequence of the minigene by sequencing (e.g., Eurofins Genomics). Notes:   Consider using an expression vector carrying a reporter gene (e.g., GFP) at the 5’ or 3’ end of your minigene. In case minigenes will also be used for protein analysis, this will enable a convenient visualization of protein expression. Check for the correct reading frame and the presence of a start codon and stop codon at appropriate positions by sequencing prior to proceeding with the next steps.   This vector is required for initial in vitro testing of the minigene expression and validation of mRNA splicing. Do not use rAAV vectors for cloning at this stage, as the site-directed mutagenesis (see the following section) will be prevented by the secondary structure of the rAAV vector ITRs.
