    "siRNA reverse transfectionCulture PC-9 cells in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin.Resuspend the siRNA SMARTpools library in 1x siRNA buffer (dilute the 5x siRNA buffer using RNase/DNase-free water) to reach a final concentration of 375 nM.Note: Upon arrival, the library was resuspended using 1x siRNA buffer into 3.75 µM stock solutions and stored at -20 °C for long-term storage. At this step in the protocol, the stock library was further diluted into 375 nM.Aliquot the siRNA SMARTpools from library assay plates using the BiomekFX into 384-well assay plates at a final concentration of 11 nM/well (load 2.5 µl/well). Prepare all plates in triplicate for both the untreated and the drug-treated conditions. Use the first 4 columns of each plate for positive and negative siRNA controls (Figure 2 and Note 2), which can be aliquoted at the same time of the library or on the day of the transfection. Note: The plates can be prepared beforehand, sealed and stored at -20 °C, making this a suitable stopping point. On the day of the reverse transfection, thaw the plates at RT for 20 min, and spin briefly for 1 min at 1,000 rpm (180 x g) before removing the seal. Add the siRNA controls in the first 4 columns if not done so at step A3.Dilute DharmaFECT2 in Opti-MEM media (see Notes 2-4; we used 0.075 µl DharmaFECT2/3 µl) and add 3 µl per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed. Tap the plates to ensure the solutions mix well, and incubate the plates at RT for 15 min.In the meantime, trypsinize and count the PC9 cells in quadruplicate using the Countess cell counter, and dilute the cell suspension appropriately. For PC9 cells, the final cell number was 500 cells per well in 80 µl.",
    "We therefore prepared 15 L RPMI (with FCS and Pen/Strep) containing 93.75E06 cells (see Note 5) for a total of 402 384-well plates, which are 6 replicates of the genome siRNA library (201 plates for the untreated condition and 201 plates for the drug-treated condition).Add 80 µl cell suspension per well using the 16-channel Xrd-384 dispenser at high speed. Note: For an optimal reverse transfection, cells should be added to the siRNA mix at least 15 min and no more than 45 min after step A4.Incubate cells in incubator at 37 °C for 48 h in a Cytomat incubator to ensure efficient protein knockdown.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519193411_8794.jpgFigure 2. Example of a layout of a 384-well plate. The first four columns were used for control siRNAs, with each row containing the siRNA indicated on the left. The first two columns were left untreated in the drug-treated conditions to confirm the effect of the drug. The remaining twenty columns were used for the genome-wide library, each well containing a different siRNA.Drug treatmentRemove the medium using the Biotek PlateWasher (Figure 1); ensure that viable cells remain attached to the bottom of the wells.Add 80 µl RMPI (supplemented with FBS and Pen/Strep) per well with or without drug (see Note 6) using Xrd-384 dispenser at medium speed. Note: For the treated condition, we left the first two columns containing control siRNAs without drug to determine the killing efficiency of the drugs in the experiment (Figure 2).Incubate cells for a further 96 h (see Note 6).Cell number quantificationRemove media.Fix the cells by adding 90 µl of 80% ice-cold EtOH using Xrd-384 dispenser at low speed. Store plates for at least 1 h at -20°C.Note: Overnight storage at -20 °C is perfectly fine and provides a suitable stopping point in the protocol.",
    "Perform steps C15-18 in batches of 50 plates.Wash the plates 3x with 100 µl PBS using plate washer.Add 20 µl of a 1 µg/ml DAPI solution to each well and incubate the cells at RT for 1 h.Wash the plates with PBS using the plate washer.Seal the plates with adhesive foil seals.Note: Plates can be stored at 4 °C prior to quantification.Scan the plates using Acumen with the 405 nm laser to quantify the number of cells in each plate (see Note 7 and Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519193443_1731.jpgFigure 3. Example of Acumen output of a plate in untreated conditions. A. Once a plate has been scanned by Acumen using laser 405 nm, the number of stained cells is indicated in shades of green for each well. Note that the first four columns contain control siRNAs (see Figure 2). B. Each well can be visualized individually within the Acumen software package. Here, two examples are presented; the left well representing a well comparable to positive control siRNAs, which indicates that the siRNA did not impact, cell viability (>5,000 cells), whereas the right well shows the effect of an siRNA that impacted on cell viability (<500 cells).Data AnalysisNormalize the data within each plate using a robust Z-score calculation (Birmingham et al., 2009). For each plate, determine the median value of all samples (exclude the first four rows containing controls iRNAs) and subtract this value from each individual well. Divide each well by the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the plate to obtain a robust Z-score for each well. For example, the median sample value within plate A was 1,000 cells with an MAD of 200.",
    "If well D10 contains 800 cells, the robust Z-score for well D10 in plate A would be (800-1,000)/200=-1, which indicates that this well contains 1 deviation fewer cells than the median.Normalize the data across the plates, separately for the untreated and drug-treated conditions. Determine for each position a smoothed Z-score using the median and MAD at each well position across all plates, in a similar manner as in the previous step. As mentioned above, calculate the smoothed Z-scores separately for the untreated and the drug-treated conditions. Plot the smoothed Z-scores from the drug-treated condition against those from the untreated condition for each replicate (two conditions in triplicate gives nine comparisons in total).Determine the ‘line of best fit’ using linear regression.Calculate the residual difference between each data point (drug treated versus untreated) as the perpendicular distance between each data point and the ‘line of best fit’. A residual difference <0 indicate siRNAs were the viability within the drug condition is lower than would be expected based on the untreated condition, whereas a residual difference >0 indicate siRNAs were the viability within the drug condition is higher than would be expected based on the untreated viability. Thus, siRNAs with a positive residual difference indicate genes that reduce drug sensitivity upon knockdown of the gene.Note: The results our genome-wide siRNA screen using this protocol are included in the original manuscript as Supplementary Tables (de Bruin et al., 2014). For further validation, we selected siRNAs with a smoothed Z-score ≥ -2 in the untreated condition (no cell killing in the absence of the drug) and with a median residual difference ≥ 2 (desensitizing) or ≤ -2 (sensitizing).",
    "As described (de Bruin et al, 2014), this selection of siRNAs was further validated by performing a deconvoluted siRNA screen using the Dharmacon Set of 4 Upgrade siGENOME siRNAs."
