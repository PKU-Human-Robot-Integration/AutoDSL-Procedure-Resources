Refer to the drawing (Figure 2A) for the detail scale of each part.\nSet the thickness of the geometry by clicking on Feature-Protrusion Boss/Base. Enter the desired thickness (refer to Figure 2A) in the empty box and select the green check icon to form the 3D geometry.\n\t\tNOTE: The dimension of the cancer-on-a-chip is defined based on the desired volumes of media and hydrogel. In the present experiment, the desired volumes of media and hydrogel were approximately 1,500 µL and 500 µL, respectively, based on the previous practical experiences for resolution of extrusion-based bioprinter.\nSave the geometry file as a 3D CAD file format (.prt or .stl).\nDetermination of cellular density for induction of hypoxic core\nRun a physical diffusion simulation program.\nClick on LiveLink and select the CAD program used. Click on Synchronize to import the geometry of the hypoxic cancer-on-a-chip on the simulation program. As the inner space of the chamber will be filled with a culture medium in an actual experimental setting, oxygen will diffuse across the inner space of the chamber and the cellular construct, which will be composed of cell-laden hydrogels.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to previous study for details on the physical parameters15.\nDefine the imported 3D geometry as a control volume of the space wherein oxygen diffuses, and the cells consume oxygen (Figure 2B).\nRun a computer analysis for gas diffusion analysis following a user guide and previously established methods16,17.",
    "From the computer analysis results, export the estimated oxygen concentration data over cross-section A-A' at each time point following the user guide. The governing equation is based on Fick's first law, as expressed in Eq. (1) (Figure 2C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61945/61945eq01.jpg\n\t\twhere c is the concentration, D is the oxygen diffusion coefficient, Ncell is the density of the cells, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61945/61945eq02.jpg is the maximum up-take rate of oxygen, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant. The constants were applied as described in a previous publication15.\n\t\tNOTE: Each time point means a step point to observe oxygen diffusion change over time.\nEvaluate whether the minimal oxygen level reaches a threshold of hypoxia and repeat the computer analysis process with an increment or decrement of cellular density.\n\t\tNOTE: Define that hypoxia gradient is formed in the construct if the oxygen level of 80% in the hydrogel area is less than 0.02 mM after 24 h.\nConfirm the number of cells required to generate the oxygen gradient inducing hypoxia in the central region from Fick's first law in step 1.2.5 and the simulation results from step 1.2.6.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, cell number was 2 × 106 cells/each construct.\n2.

Immediately loosen and retighten the cap to release the internal pressure.\nGently place the cryopreserved cells in a water bath at 37 °C for 2 min, keeping the cap out of the water. Rinse the vials with 70% ethanol under laminar flow to prevent contamination.\nTransfer the thawed cells to the flasks containing the prepared cell culture media described in step 2.1 and place the cell-containing flasks in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C for cell recovery.\nRefresh the cell culture media every 2 days and maintain the cell growth.\nAfter 24 h of thawing, replace the cell culture media to avoid cytotoxicity of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was used for cell freezing. Use HUVECs, which has undergone less than 6 passages.\n3. Preparation of collagen pre-gel solution\nSolubilization of collagen sponge with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (HCl)\n\t\nPrepare a solution of 0.1 N HCl and filter it with a 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nFor 3 mL of a 1% (w/v) neutralized collagen pre-gel solution, prepare collagen sponges cut into 5 x 5 mm2 pieces and weighing 30 mg.\nTransfer the cut collagen pieces to a sterile 10 mL glass vial.",
    "NOTE: Prepare 1.5 times volume of the required collagen hydrogel, considering the loss of the hydrogel due to the sticky characteristic of the collagen solution.\nAdd 2.4 mL of 0.1 N HCl into the collagen-containing glass vial and incubate it on the rocker at 15 rpm and 4 °C for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of the 0.1 N HCl solution was four-fifths of the final volume of required collagen hydrogel. In this case, 3 mL of collagen was prepared.\nAfter digestion, sieve the undigested collagen particles using a 40 µm cell strainer. Store the acidic collagen solution at 4 °C and use within 7 days.\npH adjustment for 1% neutralized collagen pre-gel solution\nCentrifuge the acidic collagen solution at 1224 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 30 µL of phenol red solution as a pH indicator to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) and 300 µL of 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) in the collagen pre-gel solution.\nNeutralize the pH to 7 with 1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH), verifying the color change.\n\t\tNOTE: Based on the formula, moles H+ = molarity H+ x volume H+ = moles OH-= molarity OH- x volume OH-, add 240 µL of NaOH.\nAdd distilled water to obtain a total volume of 3 mL.\nAfter pH adjustment, store the 1% (w/v) neutralized collagen pre-gel solution at 4 °C and use within 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: To precheck the gelation of the neutralized collagen pre-gel solution, make 50 µL collagen droplets on a small dish using a positive displacement pipette and incubate them in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h. Refer to the following three methods to verify the cross-linking of collagen droplets.",
    "Check whether the color of collagen has changed into opaque white from transparent color.\nTilt the container and check whether the collagen is adhered to the bottom of the container.\nPour 1x PBS on the droplets and check whether the collagen construct is not broken in the solution.\n4. 3D printing of gas-permeable barrier\n3D printing of a sacrificial poly (ethylene-vinyl acetate) (PEVA) mold\nGenerate the 3D geometry of the sacrificial PEVA mold defined in step 1 using a 3D CAD software (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: The 3D geometry and detailed model scale including dimension, units, and line types were shown in Figure 2A.\nConvert the 3D CAD file into an STL file format by clicking on File | Save-File type as STL. Also, click on Option | Output form as ASCII for G-code generation.\nClick on File | Open STL file and select the saved STL file to import the generated STL file. Click on Slice model of STL-CAD exchanger to automatically generate the G-code of the sacrificial PEVA mold (Figure 3B, C).\n\t\tNOTE: The printing path is generated with the connection of intersected points between the fundamental figure of the STL file and the slicing plane (i.e., layer). Basically, the fundamental figure of a fragment in an STL file is a triangle that contains the 3D coordinates. After the intersected points between the triangle and the layer are obtained, a G-code for printing is generated by connecting each point without an overlapped path on a layer18. Any G-code generation algorithm on board software can be used to generate printing paths for the chip fabrication.\nPrepare a sterile adhesive and hydrophilic histology slide.",
    "NOTE: The hydrophilic slide glass is critical for the permanent bonding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on the glass and the adhesion of the collagen constructs encapsulating cancer cells and stromal cells.\nPrint the sacrificial PEVA mold on the slide with a 50 G precision nozzle at a pneumatic pressure of 500 kPa at 110 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The line width is affected by the feed rate, nozzle gauge, and temperature of the material. The 50 G nozzle was used and a feed rate of 400 was applied to generate 500 µm line width for the sacrificial wall. The nozzle gauge, pneumatic pressure, and feed rate are defined with practical results19. The sacrificial wall needs to be sufficiently thick to hold the PDMS solution, which is the next fabrication step.\nCasting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) barrier\nMix 6 mL PDMS base elastomer and 0.6 mL curing agent homogenously over 5 min in a plastic reservoir. This can fabricate 6 hypoxic cancer-on-chips, considering the loss due to the sticky characteristic of PDMS.\nLoad the blended PDMS solution into a 10 mL disposable syringe and fit the syringe head with a 20 G plastic tapered dispense tip.\nFill the sacrificial PEVA mold with the blended PDMS solution in the syringe. The blended PDMS will fill the sacrificial PEVA mold with a convex surface. The height of the PDMS barrier will be higher than that of the PEVA mold.\nCure the PDMS barrier in an oven at 40 °C for over 36 h to avoid the melting of PEVA. Do not increase the temperature to over 88 °C, which is the melting temperature of PEVA.\nDetach the sacrificial PEVA mold with a pair of precision tweezers and sterilize the gas-permeable barrier at 120 °C in an autoclave.\n5.
