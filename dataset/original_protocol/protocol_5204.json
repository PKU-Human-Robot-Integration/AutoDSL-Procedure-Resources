    "RNA extraction and cDNA generationWhole patient serum, surplus to diagnostic testing requirements and with a mean viral titer of 6 HCV RNA log10 IU/ml, was used as the starting material.RNA was extracted from 140 µl of serum using QIAamp® Viral RNA mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions into 1.5 ml RNase free tubes and a final volume of 50 µl.11 µl of extracted viral RNA was mixed with 1 µl (0.5 µg) random primer.Samples were incubated at 75 °C for 10 min.To this was added a master mix which contained 2 µl (80 mM) dNTP mix, 1 µl (10 U) AMV reverse transcriptase, 1 µl (40 U) RNasin, 4 µl AMV reaction buffer.cDNA generation took place at 42 °C for 60 min, followed by 94 °C for 3 min.Samples were kept at 4 °C until required.Nested PCR to amplify the HCV E1/E2 gene junctionPrepare the primary PCR master mix to a final volume of 45 µl:table:\n﻿0,1\nOuter-forward primer:,1.5 µl\nOuter-reverse primer:,1.5 µl\n10x reaction buffer (- MgSO4):,5 µl\ndNTP mix:,1 µl\nMgSO4 stock solution:,3 µl\nPwo:,0.5 µl\nPCR grade water:,32.5 µl\n5 µl of cDNA is then added to the master mix.1° PCR cycle parameters:Initial denaturation: 3 min at 94 °CCycle conditions (repeat for 35 cycles):Denaturation: 15 sec at 94 °CAnnealing: 30 sec at 51 °CExtension: 30 sec at 72 °CFinal extension: 7 min at 72 °CKeep sample at 4 °C until required.Prepare master mix for secondary PCR to a final volume of 46 µl:table:\n﻿0,1\nInner-forward primer:,1.5 µl\nInner-reverse primer:,1.5 µl\n10x reaction buffer (- MgSO4):,5 µl\ndNTP mix:,1 µl\nMgSO4 stock solution:,2 µl\nPwo:,0.5 µl\nPCR grade water:,34.5 µl",
    "4 µl of primary PCR sample is then added to the master mix.2° PCR cycle parameters:Initial denaturation: 3 min at 94 °CCycle conditions (repeat for 35 cycles):Denaturation: 15 sec at 94 °CAnnealing: 30 sec at 53 °CExtension: 30 sec at 72 °CFinal extension: 7 min at 72 °CSamples were kept at 4 °C until required.To ensure that the initial amount of the template was not limiting, 1:100 dilution of the viral RNA was prepared which, when used as the starting template for nested PCR as described, should yield an amplicon visualized by gel electrophoresis for each sample.Preparation of samples for pyrosequencingTwo 2% TAE agarose gels were poured, one containing Sybr safe DNA gel stain and one without.Once set, the gels were split in two, with one half of the gel containing the gel stain joined with the second gel without gel stain.The 50 µl amplicon sample was split in two (10 µl and 40 µl) and resolved on the above gel. The 10 µl sample was stained using Sybr safe, while the 40 µl sample was not stained and went forward for downstream procedures. The resultant amplicon in this instance was 320 bp (Figure 1).The region of the gel containing the unstained band (40 µl sample) was cut out using a clean stainless steel blade using the stained 10 µl sample as a positioning guide and transferred to a clean 1.5 ml tube.The amplicon was gel extracted using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Extracted amplicons were quantified using a BioPhotometer.Samples were prepared in equimolar concentrations and diluted to a final concentration of 1 x 107 molecules/ml.Pyrosequencing was outsourced to Roche 454 Life Sciences (Brandford, CT, USA).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170512/20170512002827_6554.jpgFigure 1. Amplicon visualization. Successful amplification of the 320 bp amplicon was confirmed following agarose gel electrophoresis.",
    "10 µl of the 2° PCR sample was loaded.Clonal analysisPurified amplicons were cloned using CloneJet PCR Cloning Kit and transformed into One Shot® TOP10 Competent Cells using the manufacturer’s instructions using a molar ratio of 3:1 insert to vector.20 clones per sample were generated.Plasmids were purified using GeneJet Plasmid Miniprep Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.Sequencing of E1/E2 inserts was performed by Eurofins. All trace files were inspected to exclude sequences where double peaks or regions of ambiguous sequence were present.Data handling and error correctionThe raw sff data files were managed using SFFFile tools. Low-quality reads and reads shorter than 90% of the expected amplicon lengths were removed.Phylogenetic separation of the clonal data using a general time-reversible model with gamma-distributed and invariant sites (GTR+G+I) using MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). Main branches with bootstrap values (of 1,000 resamplings) > 85 were categorised as (sub-)lineages (Palmer et al., 2014).Two 24-bp motifs, that defined the HVR1 amino acid profile of each (sub-)lineage, were subsequently applied to the sequence analysis pipeline. The first 15-bp of the motif span the conserved 3’-end of E1. The remaining 9-bp include the first three amino acids of the HVR1 at the 5’-end of E2. The overall number of motifs used reflected the observed changes in the dominant HVR1 over time. For each (sub-)lineage, two motif reference sequences were deemed sufficient.To increase the sensitivity of the sequencing error correction algorithms (KEC-ET), the UDPS data was partitioned according to the presence of corresponding motifs.In order to ensure the quality of the analyzed data and the absence of PCR and sequencing chimeras, reads that had more than a 3 bp difference from the best-matching sequence from this motif set were removed.",
    "KEC consists of the three stagesIn stage 1, the set of k-mers (substring of fixed length k) of reads from the processed data set is calculated and the distribution of frequencies of k-mers is analyzed. The error threshold is calculated as the minimal frequency of k-mers separating two different distributions.In stage 2, k-mers with frequencies lower than the error threshold are considered erroneous and are used to identify and correct the errors. The corrections are based on an analysis of different factors, including the length of a segment of consecutive erroneous k-mers, the sequences of nucleotides at the end of that segment, and the frequencies of the similar correct k-mers. The procedure of error correction is repeated iteratively i times.In stage 3, the reads containing k-mers that were not corrected in stage 2 are discarded.The following parameters of KEC were used: k = 25 and i = 3."
