    "Isolation of thymocytesEuthanize mouse following approved IACUC protocol.Isolate thymus from mice using scissors and forceps (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101225227_5447.jpgFigure 1. Removal of thymus from a euthanized mouse. Secure mouse limbs to cutting board with push pins or syringe needles. Carefully cut skin with scissors down the midline from the neck to the pelvis. Make short lateral cuts in the skin at the top and bottom of the midline cut and secure skin flaps to the cutting board. A. Grab xyphoid (yellow arrow) with forceps and gently lift, then cut sternum down the midline with scissors and fold back rib cage to expose thymus (B, blue arrow). Gently lift thymus with forceps in one hand and with forceps in other hand dislodge thymus from surrounding tissues by gentle teasing. C. Thymus (note 2 lobes) after removal from the mediastinum.Transfer thymus to one well of a 6-well plate filled with 1 ml of degassed serum-free media (see Note 1) then cut thymus into several small sections with scissors.Gently compress thymus pieces in a cell strainer with forceps to release thymocytes from stroma.Add 9 ml of degassed serum-free media on ice.Filter the thymocyte suspension by pipetting (1,000 μl pipette) through a cell strainer into a 14 ml tube.Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 10 ml of degassed serum-free media on ice.Detection of reduced (catalytically active) SHP-1Enumerate thymocytes using a hemocytometer and trypan blue solution. The expected number of cells per thymus is 0.5-1 x 108.Put 1 x 107 cells into a 14 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of degassed oxidation lysis buffer (Recipe 1, Note 1) on ice. Transfer to a 1.6 ml microfuge tube.",
    "Degassed oxidation lysis buffer without IAP-biotin is used as a control.Vortex for 15 sec.Incubate the lysate for 20 min on ice.Centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 x g, 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to a 1.6 ml microfuge tube and add 0.5 ml of degassed oxidation lysis buffer.Add 5 μl (1 μg) of anti-SHP-1 Ab and incubate overnight in a nutator at 4 °C.Add 20 μl of degassed oxidation wash buffer (Recipe 2) equilibrated GammaBind G-Sepharose and incubate in a nutator for 1 h at 4 °C.Add 1 ml of degassed oxidation buffer, pipet to disperse sepharose then centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g. Remove buffer by aspiration. Repeat three times.Add 30 μl of SDS protein gel loading solution containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol to pellet.Boil samples for 5 min and load onto one lane of 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel.Run the gel for 3 h at 100 V then transfer to PVDF membrane by electro-blotting.Note: PVDF membrane is soaked in 10 ml of methanol for 5 min and then in 15 ml of transfer buffer for 5 min before electro-blot transfer.Block PVDF membrane with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer (Recipe 3) for 1 h at room temperature on a platform shaker.Add Streptavidin-HRP at a 1:5,000 dilution in a 5 ml of TBST buffer for 4 h at room temperature on a platform shaker.Wash 3 x 10 min in 15 ml of TBST buffer at room temperature.Add 2 ml of SuperSignalTM West Pico chemiluminescent developing solution and incubate for 5 min. Pour off the developing solution.In a darkroom, place X-ray films on the wrapped membrane.Expose for 1 min (see Note 2). Develop the film.Analyses of SHP-1 oxidation after stimulation with pervanadate or H2O2.Enumerate thymocytes as described above.",
    "Put 1 x 107 cells into a 14 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C.Discard supernatant, add 0.1 ml of degassed serum-free media and gently resuspend cells by repeated pipetting. Add 0.1 ml of 2x pervanadate (Recipe 4) for 10 min or 0.1 ml 2x H2O2 (2-20 mM) for 5 min at room temperature.Note: 3% (w/v) H2O2 is 880 mM. Optimal final concentrations of H2O2 and pervanadate will need to be established for each cell type and will depend on the extent of PTP oxidation desired. Initial experiments should test a range of concentrations. Suggested ranges: Pervanadate, 10-200 μM (final concentration); H2O2: 0.1-10 mM (final concentration). Cells are also treated with the same amount of vehicle solution without H2O2 or pervanadate as a negative control.Stop by centrifugation for 1 min at 1,000 x g at room temperature.Discard supernatant and wash the pellet once with degassed 1x PBS.Resuspend with 0.5 ml of degassed lysis buffer (Recipe 5). Incubate the lysates for 20 min on ice.Centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 x g, 4 °C.Take supernatant, transfer to a 1.6 ml microfuge tube and add 0.5 ml of degassed lysis buffer.Add 5 μl (1 μg) of anti-SHP-1 Ab and incubate in a nutator overnight at 4 °C.Add 20 μl of degassed lysis buffer-equilibrated GammaBind G-Sepharose and incubate in a nutator for 1 h at 4 °C.Wash by pelleting (centrifuge for 1min at 1,000 x g), aspiration, and resuspension with 1 ml of degassed lysis buffer three times.Add 30 μl of SDS protein gel loading solution containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol to pellet.Boil samples for 5 min and load each sample into well of 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel.Run the gel for 3 h at 100 V and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting.",

Analysis of reduced (active) SHP-1 in thymocytes. Immunoblot analysis of anti-SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from total thymocytes from wild type (Themis+/+; WT) or Themis-/- (KO) mice after labeling reduced active PTP active site cysteines with iodoacetyl-polyethylene glycol-biotin. The blot was probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) to detect biotinylated proteins. The reduced SHP-1 was quantitated by densitometry. Values are normalized to total SHP-1 band density in each experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101230413_0205.jpgFigure 3. SHP-1 oxidation after stimulation with pervanadate or H2O2 treatment. Immunoblot analysis of active-site oxidation of SHP-1 in total thymocytes treated with various concentrations of pervanadate (PV) (A) or H2O2 (B). Proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP1 were analyzed, and the blots were probed with antibody specific for the sulfonic acid (SO3H) form of the conserved active site cysteine of PTPs for the detection of irreversible oxidation of SHP1."
