  "procedures": [
    "The manufacturers' instructions are followed for the reagents listed below, unless otherwise described. The PCR assays are commercially available products designed to detect ROS1 and RET fusions.\n1. Working with RNA in Preparation for Reverse Transcription (RT)-dPCR: Laboratory Best Practices\nCreate an RNase-free environment when working with RNA.\n\t\nUse commercially available sprays designed to inactivate contaminating RNases.\nUse certified RNase-free reagents, tips, and tubes. Use barrier tips for pipettors to prevent introduction of RNases or cross-contamination of samples.\nAlways wear a laboratory coat to prevent particulates from falling from clothing into your sample. Designate a lab coat specific to use with RNA processing.\nWear gloves to prevent sample contamination from RNases in skin. Change gloves frequently.\nNote: Assume laboratory surfaces are contaminated with RNase since they are exposed to the environment. Gloves that contact skin, hair, doorknobs, freezer handles, pens/markers, etc. are assumed to no longer be RNase-free.\nDecontaminate pipettors, benchtops, centrifuges, and other work surfaces with a RNase inactivation spray prior to use.\nIf possible, maintain a set of equipment for use with RNA only.\nMinimize disruption of air flow in lab areas when working with RNA samples to prevent particulates from falling into samples or contaminating the work area.\nStore purified RNA at -80 ˚C.\nAvoid multiple freeze-thaws of RNA samples, as this can cause degradation.\n2. Generation of Analytic RNA Material for the Positive Controls\nDesign synthetic DNA using published mRNA sequences for fusion variants of interest10.\n\t\nFor a given fusion variant, select an mRNA fusion sequence that includes the fusion site plus sufficient length flanking on each side to cover the PCR amplicon.\nSelect nucleotide sequences between 50 - 250 nt to mimic the size of circulating RNA captured using platelet-enriched plasma.\nAdd a T7 promoter sequence (5'-CAGAGATGCATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3') to the 5' end of the target sequence.",
    "Order synthetic sequences as double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments.\nReconstitute synthetic DNA in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer to a final concentration of 10 ng/µL.\nConvert 60 ng synthetic DNA to RNA using in vitro transcription.\nPurify RNA transcripts using phenol/guanidine-based reagent12.\n\t\nInclude DNase I, RNase-free to remove residual template DNA.\nMeasure concentration of purified in vitro RNA using a commercially available fluorometer with RNA-specific dyes and standards. Ensure the RNA is within the range acceptable for the chosen standards. Dilution may be required.\nConfirm successful transcription by gel electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel mixed with RNA gel stain and a high range RNA ladder including 50 - 250 nt size range.\n\t\nLoad 500 ng of each in vitro RNA onto a gel.\nRun the gel at 5 V/cm.\nVisualize single bands using illumination, and document the results.\nConfirm expected transcript size for each of the fusion variants (based on design in step 2.1.2).\nConfirm detection of each in vitro RNA by RT-dPCR using matched variant-specific PCR assay (see steps 5 - 8 of this protocol).\nOptional: Prepare an equimolar mixture of in vitro RNA that contains each of the fusion variants and the control gene GUSB.\nIf Step 2.9 is performed: Confirm detection of each of the fusion variants included in the control mixture by dPCR using variant-specific PCR assays (see steps 5 - 8 of this protocol).\nDetermine desired input concentration for analytic positive controls by testing concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 fg10. Choose concentration based on desired copy number output.\nFollowing confirmation, prepare 10 µL single-use aliquots of analytic RNA for use in the positive control (step 4.4) and store at -80 ˚C.\n3. Donor Specimens\nCollect 10 mL human whole blood specimens in 10 mL blood collection tubes (BCT) containing a cell-free RNA preservative.",
    "Note: All human donors shall consent to research use and no donor-specific identifying information shall be collected or used during testing.\nProcess whole blood samples within the timeframe specified by the BCT manufacturer.\nPooled normal human plasma can be purchased from a commercial source for use within the analytic positive control. Prepare single-use, 1 mL aliquots of the pooled normal human plasma and store at -80 ˚C for use with the positive control (step 4.4).\n4. Recovery of Circulating RNA from Plasma\nNote: It is important to work quickly during this procedure.\nCentrifuge whole blood tubes at 200 x g for 20 min.\nCollect up to 4 mL of plasma from centrifuged blood collection tube using a serological pipette. Be careful not to disturb or aspirate the buffy coat layer.\nIsolate circulating RNA using a commercially available kit that can capture exosomes, platelets and cell-free RNA from plasma. Isolate RNA from positive control sample alongside each batch.\nPrepare the Positive Control for each batch of clinical samples as follows:\nThaw 1 mL pooled normal human plasma aliquot (Step 3.3).\nThaw 10 µL analytic RNA aliquot (Step 2.12).\nPrepare positive control by adding 10 µL analytic RNA into the normal human plasma sample once ethanol has been added to the plasma lysate.\nElute samples with 100 µL nuclease-free water. Proceed immediately with RNA clean up and concentration.\n\t\nSamples may be stored on wet ice, and covered, for up to one hour.\nConcentrate RNA using column based method and elute in 9 µL of RNase-free water.\n\t\nProceed immediately to Step 5, or keep samples on wet ice for up to one hour.\n5. Reverse Transcription of RNA to cDNA\nConvert concentrated circulating RNA sample to cDNA using a commercially available reverse transcription reaction kit, including random primers (see Table 1 for components).",
    "Note: Gene specific primers are optional and can be designed for test variants. Primers are designed based on the target RNA sequence. Use fusion variant sequences from Step 2.1.\n\t\nInclude no reverse transcriptase control sample and no RNA control sample (see Table 1).\nIsolate cDNA from reverse transcription reaction using a commercially available DNA concentrator spin column.\nNote: This step facilitates removal of enzymes, primers, and free deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs).\nUse cDNA immediately in PCR reactions or store at -80 ˚C.\n6. Digital PCR\nNote: This PCR is specific to droplet digital PCR (See Table of Materials).\nPCR mix precautions.\nWear a disposable lab coat and nitrile gloves.\nUse PCR mix reagents in a dedicated reagent preparation area. Do not handle cDNA in the reagent-only preparation area.\nCover probes while working to protect them from light. Excessive light can photo bleach the fluorescent dye attached to the probe.\nTransport mixes, covered and protected from light, into a separate pre-amplification area before cDNA is to be added.\nAdd cDNA to be tested to PCR mix in a PCR clean hood located in pre-amplification area.\nPrepare PCR mixes for a final reaction volume of 20 µL according to Table 2.\nDistribute PCR mixes + cDNA to PCR plates.\nNote: Use of a plate layout as a guide is recommended.\nCover the plate using a removable plate sealer.\nCentrifuge plates briefly to collect samples at the bottom of the wells.\nMix on plate shaker on a low setting for 10 s.\nCentrifuge plates briefly to collect sample at the bottom of the well.\nRemove plate sealer. Perform droplet generation for PCR-cDNA mix with either a manual or automated droplet generation system.",
    "For manual droplet generation, transfer 20 µL PCR mix to sample wells on the droplet generation cartridge. Add 70 µL of droplet generation oil. Cover with rubber gasket and transfer cartridge to manual droplet generator to initiate droplet generation. Following droplet generation, transfer droplets to a fresh PCR plate using tips recommended by the manufacturer. Aspirate and dispense the droplets slowly, over 5 to 6 s each, without touching the opening of the tip to the droplet cartridge or plate.\nFor automated droplet generation, seal the plate with a foil seal and transfer to the droplet generator. Ensure all tips, cartridges, and plates are in place before starting droplet generation.\nFollowing droplet generation and transfer of droplets to a fresh PCR plate, seal with a foil plate sealer, and thermal cycle plates using the settings in Table 3.\nAfter the thermal cycler run is complete, read the plate using a droplet reader. Create a plate layout for reader software that identifies the location of controls, samples, etc., and load into software to start read.\n7. Data Analysis and Review, and Generation of Results\nAnalyze plate read results using commercially available software.\nNavigate to the Analyze menu to view two-dimensional (2D) amplitude plots.\nEvaluate the overall quality of the data by examining the droplet data.\n\t\nEvaluate data for total accepted event numbers using the Events menu. If there are fewer than 10,000 events per well, carefully evaluate the data for additional problems.\nCheck data for aberrant fluorescence amplitudes. Significant amplitude differences and concentration differences between replicate samples indicate poor handling or mixing of samples.\nMake notes of droplet clusters with spray patterns on a 45-degree axis, which is indicative of poor quality droplets or problematic samples.",
    "Examine Positive Control, No Reverse Transcriptase (No RT), and No RNA Control (NRC) data first. Select all control samples and examine cluster quality by 2D plot. For proper thresholding, a clear separation between droplet clusters should be apparent.\nFor each assay variant, set the threshold based on control wells.\n\t\nSet thresholds on 2D plots using the crosshairs tool to separate the double negative droplet population from the control gene population (labeled with 5'-hexachloro- fluorescein-CE phosphoramidite probe), y-axis, and variant gene population, if present (labeled with fluorescein amidite OR 6-carboxyfluorescein probe), x-axis.\nSum copies from each replicate well for a single sample.\nExpress test results as the number of variant copies detected.\nNote: To determine the analytic cutoff value for calling a positive or negative sample, run a normal healthy donor sample set (at least 10 individual samples) through the finalized process and establish the cutoff above any detectable background signal for the mutation of interest. Additionally, establish the number of control gene copies required to call a positive or negative result. This control gene cut-off functions as an internal quality control (QC) to evaluate the quantity and quality of each RNA sample that is processed.\n8. Verification of RT-dPCR Reaction Conditions Using Cell-lines (Optional)\nTo verify detection of fusion variants, use commercially available cell-lines expressing the ROS1 or RET fusion mRNA of interest. Proceed as follows:\n\t\nHomogenize flash-frozen cells in a guanidinium-based lysis solution directly from the frozen state. Even brief thawing prior to homogenization can cause RNA degradation and loss.\nIsolate RNA using silica-membrane spin columns designed for RNA.\nMeasure the concentration of RNA samples using a fluorometer with RNA-specific reagents and standards.\nDilute isolated RNA into a background of wild-type RNA from plasma or another commercial source.",
