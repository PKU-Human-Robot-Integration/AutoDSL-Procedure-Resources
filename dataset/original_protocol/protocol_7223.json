Deparaffinization and rehydrationTake one tissue section in a 50 mL Falcon tube, add 1 mL of xylene for deparaffinization, and incubate it for 5 min. After incubation, aspirate the xylene and repeat the same step twice.After deparaffinization, add 1 mL of 100% ethanol and incubate it for 5 min, followed by sequential rehydration by adding and aspirating different percentages of ethanol (1 mL) (95%, 70%, 50% and 30%). Finally, add 1 mL of nuclease-free water for rehydration and incubate it for 5 min.Tissue microdissection and enzymatic digestionAfter rehydration, the tissue is resuspended in 1 mL of PBS (room temperature) with 0.5 mM of CaCl2, select sections, and use a forceps to transfer tissue to an autoclave glass dish with 200 µL of PBS with 0.5 mM of CaCl2. Perform total tissue fragmentation with two 21 G needles under a stereomicroscope.",
    "Tip: To get suitable nuclei, make tissue as small as possible. Transfer the fragmented tissue into a 1.5 mL tube with a 1 mL pipette and centrifuge the sample at 3,000 × g (room temperature) for 10 min. After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and add 500 µL of 6 mg/mL collagenase (diluted in PBS with 0.5 mM CaCl2), 500 µL of 600 unit/mL hyaluronidase (diluted in PBS with 0.5 mM CaCl2), 50 μg of sodium azide (Merck Millipore, 26628-22-8), 100 μg of ampicillin and incubate for 16 h at 37°C.DisaggregationPrepare fresh NST buffer (Nonidet P40 with Salts and Tris buffer) before starting the experiment (see Table 8 for NST buffer recipe). After 16 h of incubation, add 400 μL of NST buffer and centrifuge the mixture at 3,000 × g for 10 min (room temperature), then aspirate and discard the supernatant.Add 800 μL of NST buffer,10% fetal bovine serum (88 μL) (on ice), and 0.1% DNase-free RNase A (0.88 μL) (on ice) to the pellet and pass through 2 7G needle syringe for at least 30 times for disaggregation.FiltrationAfter disaggregation, centrifuge the mixture at 3,000 × g for 10 min, aspirate supernatant, add 800 μL of NST buffer, and filter the mixture twice using a 30 µm filter.The filtered mixture should be centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. Then, discard the supernatant first and resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of 1× PBS, take 5 μL of nuclei suspension to count the cells using a cell counter, take 20 μL of nuclei suspension to stain the nuclei with DAPI, and visualize the single nuclei population (Figure 1).Note: 500,000–1,000 000 nuclei could be gotten from one 20 μm-thick mouse kidney section. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4418/bioprotoc-12-10-4418-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Finally, mix with 2 μL of 6× loading dye and run on a 1% agarose gel to check the size of the tagmented DNA along with DNA ladder (Figure 2).Note: The expected size of fragments of DNA after tagmentation starts from 150 bp to 2,500 bp, and it looks like a smear spreading in the gel lane. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4418/bioprotoc-12-10-4418-g002.jpgFigure 2. Activity assay of Tn5, pA-Tn5, and T7-pA-Tn5. DNA size distribution after Tn5 transposition showed here. T7-pA-Tn5 has similar activity to Tn5 and pA-Tn5.Antibody binding and tagmentation Epitope retrievalAfter nuclei isolation, transfer a proper amount of FFPE nuclei (1,000–1,500,000) to a new 1.5 mL Lo-Bind tube. Then spin down the nuclei at 3,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.Note: The number of nuclei used in the experiment depends on the total number of nuclei gotten from nuclei isolation step. The protocol works for 1,000 to 1,500,000 nuclei. To profile histone modification H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (euchromatin markers), resuspend the FFPE nuclei with 50 μL of Epitope Retrieval Buffer-1 (see below Table 13), and transfer the suspension to a PCR tube. Incubate the nuclei suspension at 50°C for 1 h. To profile histone modification H3K27me3 (heterochromatin marker) and H3K36me3 (gene body marker), a harsher epitope retrieval condition is needed. Therefore, the nuclei are resuspended with 50 μL of Epitope Retrieval Buffer-2 (see below Table 14), and transfer the suspension to a PCR tube. Incubate the nuclei suspension at 65°C for 1 h.During the incubation time, prepare the FACT-seq Antibody buffer (check more information from the recipe section) and keep it on ice.After incubation, add 10 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to the tube and transfer the mixture to a 1.5 mL Lo-Bind tube.",
    "And place the tube on a shaker, and incubate at 37°C for 30 min with 500 rpm to quench SDS.After quenching, spin down the mixture at 3,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and wash the pellet once with the FACT-seq Antibody buffer.After washing, resuspend the nuclei pellet with 200 μL of FACT-seq Antibody buffer, and use 5 μL of nuclei suspension to count the nuclei number by the cell counter.Note: Recovery rate after epitope retrieval on average is 62.94%. Primary antibody bindingAfter counting nuclei, transfer 100,000 FFPE nuclei into a new 0.5 mL Qubit tube.Note: Nuclei tend to attach to the tube wall and dry out during the overnight rotation step, and 0.5 mL tubes should be used instead of 1.5 mL tubes. Centrifuge the nuclei at 2,500 × g for 5 mins at room temperature and discard the supernatant with pipette.Resuspend the nuclei with at least 1 volume of FACT-seq Antibody buffer.Centrifuge the nuclei at 2,500 × g for 5 mins at room temperature and discard the supernatant with pipette and resuspend the nuclei with 200 μL of FACT-seq Antibody buffer with 1:100 diluted primary antibody.Incubated overnight with slow rotation (8–10 rpm) at 4°C.Tip: Set the rotation speed properly and don’t make the solution stuck to one side of the tube. Secondary antibody bindingPrepare the following buffers before starting the experiment and keep it on ice or at +4°C.Tip: We always prepare these buffers freshly. FACT-seq Dig-washing buffer (see below Table 15)FACT-seq Dig-300 buffer (see below Table 16)FACT-seq tagmentation buffer (see below Table 17)After overnight incubation with primary antibody, spin down the nuclei at 2,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, wash the nuclei pellet with 200 μL of FACT-seq Dig-washing buffer.",
    "Resuspend the nuclei pellet in 200 μL of FACT-seq Dig-washing buffer with 1:100 diluted secondary antibody (Guinea Pig anti-Rabbit IgG antibody) and incubate the mixture for 1 h at room temperature with slow rotation.Spin down the mixture at 2,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, wash it three times with 200 μL of FACT-seq Dig-washing buffer, resuspend the nuclei pellet with 200 μL of FACT-seq Dig-300 buffer containing 1:100 diluted T7 pA-Tn5 (Tip: The T7-pA-Tn5 was assembled in section B.2.). And the protein A domain of T7 pA-Tn5 has the affinity to bind mammalian immunoglobulins, which will bind to the secondary antibody from guinea pig.Incubated the tubes for 1 h rotating at room temperature.Tagmentation and reverse crosslinkingAfter Tn5 binding, spin down the nuclei for 5 min at 600 × g and wash three times with FACT-seq Dig-300 buffer, resuspend the nuclei with 200 μL of FACT-seq tagmentation buffer and incubate the suspension for 1 hr at 37°C.After that, stop tagmentation by addition of 6.7 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, 22 μL of 10% SDS, and 2.2 μL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K to each tube, and mix it by gently pipetting up and down several times.Perform the Proteinase K digestion at 65°C with 1,200 rpm shaking for 2 h.Perform reverse-crosslinking overnight at 72°C with 1,200 rpm in a heating block for H3K27ac or H3K4me1 (change the overnight temperature to 80°C for H3K27me3 or H3K36me3).After overnight reverse-crosslinking, add 2.2 µL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K and perform the Proteinase K digestion again (65°C, 1,200 rpm) for 1 h. DNA isolation and in vitro transcription  DNA purificationAfter Proteinase K digestion, purify the mixture with either Qiagen Kit purification or phenol-chloroform purification. (Tip: We don’t see differences in library quality when targeting H3K27ac using these two different purification approaches.",
    "When targeting H3K27me3 (heterochromatin marker), phenol-chloroform purification is recommended).For Qiagen purification, follow the standard protocol of Qiagen MiniElute PCR Purification kit and finally elute the DNA in 20 μL of elution buffer.For phenol-chloroform purification, after Proteinase K digestion, add elution buffer or sterile water to the tube and make the final volume 300 μL per tube. Add 300 μL of Phenol and mix by full-speed vortexing ~2 s.Centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 15 min. Remove the aqueous layer by pipetting to a fresh 1.5 mL tube and add equal amount of Chloroform.Invert the tube ~10× to mix, and centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 15 min.Transfer aqueous layer to a fresh 1.5 mL tube, then add 2.5×–3× volume of absolute ethanol and add proper amount of 5M NaCl to make the final concentration become 200 mM (NaCl).Transfer the tube to -80°C freezer and precipitate the DNA for 2–3 h, and centrifuge the tubes for 20 min 4 °C at 16,000 × g.Discard the supernatant and add 700 μL of 70% ethanol and slightly vortex it. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, then discard the supernatant and air dry the tube for 10–15 min. After drying up, add 25 μL of elution buffer (from Qiagen MiniElution PCR Purification kit) to dissolve the DNA.Gap fillingTip: After Tn5 tagmentation, there will be two 9 bp gaps between the mosaic ends and the chromatin strands. And the gap filling is to fill up these two gaps using high-fidelity DNA polymerase. After DNA purification, transfer the sample to the PCR tube and add an equal volume of high-fidelity 2× PCR master mix.Then incubate the mixture for 8 mins at 72°C in a thermal cycler.Purify the sample using the Qiagen MiniElute PCR Purification kit.",
    "SPRI bead purificationRemove the fragments shorter than 150 bp using 1.0× SPRI select beads.
