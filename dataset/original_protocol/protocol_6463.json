    "Cloning of dual fluorescence reporter constructsDesign primers for the amplification of the gene of interest (here: ADRB1 or dengue NS4A-4B), eGFP and mCherry with the addition of 20-30 bp overlaps between the neighboring fragments for assembly of multiple DNA fragments. The forward primer for the gene of interest contains an overlap with left arm of EcoRV-linearized pLenti CMV Puro DEST (w118-1), a Kozak sequence and an ATG start codon. The reverse primer overlaps with the 5′ end of the eGFP coding sequence. The reverse primer for eGFP has no stop codon and contains an overhang encoding the first ~40 bp of T2A thus creating an overlap with the T2A-mCherry fragment. mCherry is amplified with a forward primer containing parts of the T2A sequence and a reverse primer with stop codon and overlap to the right arm of EcoRV-linearized pLenti CMV Puro DEST (w118-1). A control construct, which only encodes eGFP-T2A-mCherry, can be generated, where the forward primer for eGFP contains an overlap with left arm of EcoRV-linearized pLenti CMV Puro DEST (w118-1), a Kozak sequence and an ATG start codon.Amplify DNA fragments from plasmid templates using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (or any other high-fidelity polymerase). Use PCR cycling conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. After PCR, run amplified fragments on a 1% agarose gel followed by extraction using a gel purification kit.Assemble purified PCR fragments together with EcoRV-linearized and CIP-treated plenti-CMV-Puro plasmid using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Note that other mammalian expression vectors can be used as recipient plasmid but you need to modify the overhang sequences for assembly of multiple DNA fragments in Step A1 accordingly.Transform  Stbl3  E. coli with assembled plasmids by heat shocking at 42 °C waterbath for 45 s. Recover heat shocked bacteria in S.O.C.",
    "medium and 30 °C shaker for 1 h at 225 RPM. Spread transformed bacteria on 10 mm agar plates that contain 100 μg/ml Carbenicillin and incubate at 30 °C or 37 °C overnight.The next day, pick a single colony from the plate and inoculate 50 ml of LB broth that contains 100 μg/ml Carbenicillin. Shake inoculated LB broth in 30 °C (if plasmid sequence is prone to recombination, such as lentiviral plasmids) or 37 °C shaker at 225 RPM overnight.Extract plasmid DNA from E. coli using a plasmid DNA Midiprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Determine concentration and purity (260/280 ratio) of nucleic acid using Nanodrop. Sequence-verify plasmid insert by Sanger sequencing using a forward primer upstream of eGFP and a reverse primer downstream of mCherry.Transfection of cell linesPlate ~3 x 105 293FT cells (WT and EMC4 KO genotypes) in 12-well plates the day before transfection using 293FT culture medium (see Recipes). Cells should be 70%-80% confluent 24 h after plating.The next day, transfect dual fluorescence constructs into 293FT cells using Mirus TransIT®-LT1 Transfection Reagent or Lipofectamine 3000. To do so, dilute required amount of plasmid DNA in serum-free media or OptiMEM and add the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, add DNA-lipid complexes dropwise to cells.Flow cytometry analysisAfter 24-48 h, detach cells by adding 100 μl 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA per well followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 min. Inactivate trypsin by adding an equal volume of culture medium containing FBS. Pass cells through a 35 μm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension.Analyze cells on a flow cytometer. First, use untransfected cells to draw negative gates.",
    "Gate for forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), then height and area of FSC for a singlet gate, then mCherry fluorescence (mCherry positive cells are the successfully transfected cells) and finally eGFP fluorescence. Then run your samples (eGFP-2A-mCherry control and protein of interest constructs). Record 5 x 103-5 x 104 mCherry-positive events per transfected sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200414/20200414032834_0118.jpgFigure 1. Experimental design for dual fluorescence cytometry assay. A. Schematic representation of mammalian expression cassette showing gene of interest followed by eGFP, a viral T2A sequence and mCherry. The primers to generate DNA fragments containing overhangs for plasmid construction are indicated by black arrows (1F = PLENTI-CMV-ADRB1-F or PLENTI-CMV-DENV_NS4A-F; 1R = ADRB1(NOSTOP)_GFP-R or DENV_NS4B_GFP-R; 2F = EGFP-F; 2R=EGFP-T2A_GIBSON-R; 3F = T2A-MCHERRY-F; 3R = MCHERRY-PLENTI-R). Transcribed mRNA molecules encode both fluorescent proteins, which are then translated into two protein products by peptide bond skipping at the T2A site. This results in the production of the GFP fusion protein and mCherry at an initial 1:1 stoichiometry. Thus, the eGFP:mCherry ratio allows measuring effects on protein levels post-synthesis. B. Experimental workflow. eGFP-T2A-mCherry reporter constructs are transfected into cells of different experimental conditions (e.g., wild-type vs knockout genotypes, drug treatments, cell stress etc.). Cells are then analyzed for GFP and mCherry fluorescence levels using flow cytometry. Lastly, eGFP:mCherry ratios are calculated for the protein of interest under the different experimental conditions and graphed as frequency distributions."
