    "This study has been carried out using heterozygous DAT-Cre19 and VGLUT2-Cre20 mice of both sexes, aged >8 weeks and weighing >20 g. All the experiments were conducted according to the Swedish (Animal Welfare Act SFS 1998:56) and European Union Legislation (Convention ETS 123 and Directive 2010/63/EU) with permission from the local Animal Ethical Committees.\n1. Genotyping of mice\nTake ear biopsies using an ear puncher to use for genotyping of the transgenic mice.\nPrepare the ear punches to perform a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction using purpose-made primers.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, Cre-directed primers were used.\n\t\nAdd 75 µL of lysis buffer (buffer 1: 250 mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA) in each 1.5 mL tube containing an ear punch.\nIncubate in a heating block at 96 °C for 30 min.\nLet the samples cool down for 5 min and then add 75 µL of the neutralization buffer (buffer 2: 400 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0).\nPerform PCR according to standard procedures12,21 using the appropriate primers (here: Cre FW 5'-ACGAGTGATGAGGTTCGCAAGA-3', Cre REV 5'-ACCGACGATGAAGCATGTTTAG-3').\n\tCAUTION: Work on ice under a PCR hood and pay attention not to contaminate the reagents and the samples.\n\t\nPrepare the PCR master mix. Multiply the following volumes according to how many samples are going to be analyzed, including appropriate control samples. Mix the reagents for a single 25 µL final volume reaction in the following order: distilled water (18.9 µL), 10x buffer with MgCl2 (2.5 µL), 10 mM dNTP mix (0.5 µL), 10 µM forward primer (1 µL), 10 µM reverse primer (1 µL), 5 U/µL DNA polymerase (0.1 µL), and template DNA (1 µL; will be added in the next steps).\n\t\tNOTE: Always add a negative, a positive, and an empty (without template DNA) control to ensure valid results.",
    "Add 24 µL of master mix in PCR tubes.\nAdd 1 µL of template DNA (coming from the ear punch from each mouse) in each PCR tube.\nCentrifuge the PCR tubes briefly to ensure the template DNA is inside the master mix.\nPerform PCR with a thermal cycler using the cycling program in Table 1.\nPrepare an agarose gel to run the samples using electrophoresis.\n\tNOTE: The size will depend on the number of samples that need to be analyzed.\n\t\nAdd 1% w/v agarose powder in 1x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer in a glass bottle. Heat in microwave until the agarose is fully dissolved, checking regularly that it does not boil over.\n\t\tCAUTION: Take precautions to avoid burns.\nLet the gel cool down to approximately 50 °C and add a nucleic acid gel stain (0.5 µL/50 mL of gel).\nPour the gel in the casting tray containing well combs and leave it in room temperature until it becomes completely solidified. Remove the combs gently.\nFill the electrophoresis tank with 1x TAE buffer and place the gel in the tank.\nAdd 2 µL of 1x DNA loading dye in each one of the DNA samples.\nLoad 4 µL of DNA ladder in the first well of the gel, then proceed to load the full volume of the samples in the remaining wells.\nSet the power source of the electrophoresis to 140 V and run for 25−30 min.\nPlace the gel under a UV source and take a picture of the results.\n2. Stereotaxic surgery\nAfter genotyping, separate mice keeping the ones positive for Cre. Wait until they are at least 8 weeks old and weigh >20 g to perform surgery.\n\t\nSanitize the environment and sterilize the surgical tools to perform surgery under aseptic conditions.",
    "Inject the mice subcutaneously with analgesic 30 min before surgery.\nAnesthetize the mice with isoflurane (2−3% in normal air for induction and 1.5−2.0% for maintenance of anesthesia). Ensure adequate anesthesia level is achieved by testing the absence of pain reflexes by gently pinching the toe of the mouse. Adjust the isoflurane delivery accordingly.\nPlace the mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus. Add eye lubricant to prevent eye lesioning due to dryness and shave the hair of the top of the skull. Use a heating pad to maintain the temperature of the mouse stable.\nInject 100 µL of local anesthetic under the skin of the skull and allow 5 min to take effect.\nPrepare the incision site by three circular applications of alcohol or sterile saline alternating with iodine. Use a sterile cotton tip and initiate the application from the incision line, outward.\nGently lift the skin with forceps, and make an incision of ~1.5 cm along the rostrocaudal axis with surgical scissors to reveal the surface of the skull.\nUsing a cotton stick, apply H2O2 solution to remove the periosteum.\nRinse the skull with sterile saline and dry it using sterile cotton tip applicators.\nLocate the bregma and lambda.\nAscertain flat skull alignment by positioning the tip of the injection needle, adjusted on the stereotaxic frame, on bregma and lambda. Measure the ventral coordinates for each position and compare. When the skull is flat the ventral coordinate for both bregma and lambda are identical. If not, adjust the head position and take the measurements again.\nFind and mark the position (AP: -3.45 mm, ML: -0.2 mm from bregma according to Franklin and Paxinos22) where the injection of the Cre-dependent virus and the implantation of the optic fiber will take place and make a small hole using a micro drill.",
    "Load 400 nL of virus in the 10 µL syringe mounted on the stereotaxic apparatus using a precision pump.\nLower the needle (34 G, beveled) carefully and inject 300 nL of Cre-dependent optogenetic virus (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2(H134)-eYFP [5.6 x 1012 vg/mL]) in the VTA (AP: -3.45 mm, ML: -0.2 mm from bregma and -4.4 mm from the surface of the skull, according to Franklin and Paxinos22) at 100 nL/min injection rate using the precision pump.\nAfter injection, leave the needle in place for an additional 10 min to allow for diffusion of the virus (Figure 2A).\nRetract the needle slowly from the injection site.\nMake small holes using a microdrill to fit anchor screws that will stabilize the optic fiber and dental cement complex.\nTake the bregma coordinates again and implant the optic fiber (200 µm diameter, 0.37 NA) at: AP: -3.45 mm, ML: -0.2 mm from bregma and -4.0 mm from the surface of the skull (Figure 2B) according to Franklin and Paxinos22.\nSecure the fiber on the skull using dental cement. Apply enough cement around the optic fiber ferule to secure it to the skull but pay attention to leave 3−4 mm of the top of the ferule free of cement to allow connection of the patch cord (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: Pay attention not to fill the hole with cement as this can cause brain tissue damage. Hemostatic materials can be added in the hole to prevent this from happening.\nUse tissue glue or absorbable sutures to close any open wound and leave the animal to recover for at least two weeks. Give an additional dose of analgesic 12−24 h after the surgery.\n3. Setting up the control of the laser source",
    "Use single board microcontrollers to control the laser source. Write a script using the appropriate software. Load the script on the microcontroller board using the appropriate connection cable to the computer.\n\tNOTE: The script should include external modulation (input) coming from the tracking software through a TTL box, and an output to the laser to control stimulation parameters. For 10 ms pulse width at 20 Hz frequency, use the script found in the Supplemental Coding File.\nConnect the board to the laser and the TTL box of the tracking hardware.\n\t\nUse a network cable to connect the TTL box to the board (pin 5 for the provided script) (Figure 3A,C).\nEnsure the laser is set to control by external modulation and connect the laser to the board using an FC/PC cable (pin 13 for the given script) (Figure 3B,C).\nConnect the appropriate pins to ground parts of the board.\nConnect the laser source to the optic fiber.\n\t\nConnect the laser source to a rotary joint (Figure 3D).\nConnect a patch cord (Figure 3E) to the rotary joint.\nStabilize the rotary joint above the apparatus but outside the recording area. Make sure the length of the fiber-optic patch cord is appropriate to allow the mouse to move without difficulties in the arena (Figure 3F).\n4. Setting up the experiment for the RT-PP approach within the tracking software\nCalibrate the arena setup. Use a ruler to measure a specific part of the physical apparatus, draw a line corresponding to the part measured on the image within the software under the Draw Scale to Calibrate tab and enter the already known value (step 1 in Figure 4).\nDesign the arena. Draw the area where the movement of the mice will be recorded (step 2 in Figure 4).",
    "Create the zones. Draw the zones that will eventually be assigned as laser-paired, laser-unpaired and \"neutral\" (step 3 in Figure 4).\nValidate the setup to confirm that there are no conflicting parameters, for example zones outside the arena (step 4 in Figure 4)\nSet the experimental parameters under the tab trial control settings (step 5 in Figure 4).\n\t\nSet the trial time as shown in step 1 in Figure 5 for a 30 min RT-PP session.\nMaking sure \"hardware control\" is enabled, assign a compartment as laser-paired in which entry of the mouse will trigger a TTL signal through the tracking software to the microcontroller board. In Figure 5 (step 2) the laser-paired compartment is compartment A. For the reversal phase, switch the compartments so compartment B will be laser paired and compartment A will be unpaired. Do so by replacing A with B and B with A in the software.\n5. Modification of the setup to test the aversive properties of the stimulation using the NCP approach\nFollow steps 4.1−4.4 as described previously.\nSet the time of the experiment to 30 min through the \"Repeat till\" option in the \"Reference\" box settings (step 1 in Figure 6).\nAssign both A and B zones as laser paired (step 2 in Figure 6) by adding \"when center-point is in any of Zone A and Zone B\" for the condition box related to the settings for A and B compartments. Note that the laser will turn off when the animal is located in the neutral compartment.\n6. Performing an experiment using laser stimulation\nSet up the detection settings.\n\t\nUse a dummy to resemble the mouse in order to ensure appropriate detection settings.\nPlace the dummy in one compartment of the apparatus and use automated setup with dynamic subtraction.",
    "Remove the dummy and place it to the opposite compartment. Make sure the dummy is fully detected and if not, adjust the settings via the software to achieve proper detection.\n\t\t\nDuring this step also check if the stimulation works as it is supposed to. Start acquisition using the previously configured trial control settings and place the dummy in the laser paired compartment and see if the stimulation is triggered as it should. Then place the dummy in the unpaired and/or the neutral compartment and see if the stimulation is stopped.\nUse a power meter with a sensor to set the laser power to 10 mW using the knob on the laser (Figure 3B). Perform this step each time laser stimulation is used.\n\tCAUTION: Use protective eye equipment as direct exposure to laser light can cause permanent eye damage.\nPlace the mouse in the apparatus.\n\t\nGently take the mouse out of its cage and connect the fiber-optic implant to the fiber-optic patch cord using a ceramic sleeve.\nPlace the mouse gently in the neutral compartment of the three-compartment apparatus.\nWait until the mouse is detected by the software.\nRemove the vertical sliding doors restricting the animal from entering the main compartments.\nAllow the animal to explore freely without any disturbances.\n\t\tNOTE: The same procedure is followed when the animal is not receiving stimulation with the exception that step 6.2 is not needed and that the laser is off the whole time."
