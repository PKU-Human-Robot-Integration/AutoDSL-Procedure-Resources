Counts / 4 ∗ 10,000 = number of cells/mL.\n20,000 cells are needed for a collagen preparation for 2 center well dishes.\nCentrifuge the amount of medium containing 20,000 cells in a 5 mL reaction tube at 2,000 rpm and room temperature.\nNote: Prepare step 8 while the centrifuge is running.\nRemove the supernatant medium with a pipette.\nPrepare the collagen matrix solution before removing the supernatant so cells are not seating without media.\nPipette the appropriate amount of PureCol Collagen into a 5 mL reaction tube.\nAdd the amount of Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution 10×.\nAdd 29 μL of NaOH solution till the color turns pink.\nGently mix the mixture.\nIf the solution is not pinkish in color, stepwise add a few more μL of NaOH using a micro pipette till the appropriate color is reached.\nPipette the collagen mixture onto the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in this mixture.\nPipette 850 μL of the collagen cell suspension per center well dish.",
    "Leave the dishes in the CO2 incubator for 1 h which will allow the collagen to gel.\nNote: Settings of the Heracell 150i CO2 Incubator: 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM medium supplemented with forskolin (FSK; 10 mM) on the top of each collagen gel.\nNote: Depending on the previous number of passages of the cells, after 3–4 days of growth within the collagen matrix, the in vitro cysts will reach a size that can be punctured. We use cells up to a passage of 15 to reduce the risk of passage-dependent clonal variability which may affect the capability of cyst formation.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Not all cells placed in the collagen matrix form cysts. A small proportion (in our hands 5%–10% of the cells) may die or remain at the single cell level. A reasonable size for use for puncturing cysts is a diameter of at least 100 μm. We recommend changing the DMEM medium every 2 days.\nCritical: If the color of the collagen does not stably turn into a pink color by adding NaOH, the appropriate pH is not set correctly. Of note, the use of a pH electrode or pH test strips does not provide robust and reliable measurements in our hands which we refer to the sticky and glutinous texture of the collagen mixture.\nPreparation upon start on day 3\nTiming: 30 min prior to injection\n30 min before puncturing the in vitro cysts, turn on the Keyence microscope including the in vivo chamber. The chamber should have reached the required working temperature and have the necessary humidity and amount of CO2.\nSettings of the incubation chamber: 37°C, 5% CO2.\nPuncture of the cysts in the collagen matrix\nTiming: 30 min\nPull the glass capillaries with the Four-Step-Micropipette-Puller.",
    "Setting: 850°C/100% Force/9 Distance (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: In vitro cyst puncture and injury-induced tubule formation using renal epithelial cells Part 1; point of time 00:05–00:30 s).\nGrind the pointed side of the capillary using the MicroGrinder using water cooling at an angle of 30°. The tip of the capillary should then resemble a cannula (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] point of time 00:30–01:07 s).\nFill the capillary completely filled with mineral oil from its rear side (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] point of time 01:07–01:20 s).\nNote: The capillary should be completely filled with mineral oil before the injection solution is introduced. A seamless transition from mineral oil to injection solution is required for the correct application of 2 nl. There should be no air bubbles.\nExtend the pen of the WPI Puller to 88%. Place the capillary on the pen and secure it.\nPut the capillary carefully into 30–50 μL of the liquid to be aspirated, in our case brilliant cresyl blue. Aspirate the liquid by manually actuating the puller (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: In vitro cyst puncture and injury-induced tubule formation using renal epithelial cells Part 2; point of time 00:00–00:29 s).\nManually eject a few times to get rid of any air or oil at the tip of the capillary. Clamp the pen in the holder.\nPlace the center well dish with in vitro cysts under the Leica stereomicroscope.\nLock the dish into position with one hand and pierce the cysts in the collagen using the micromanipulator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2378-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Then: Analyze → Set Scale → insert the correct length in the known distance field in “μm” and type “μm” into the field named Unit of length. If you are going to analyze further stacks with the same resolution, you may tick global and ImageJ will use the same setting for the next stacks).",
    "Insert time using the time stamper function according to the frequency that was used to capture the photos (Plugins → Movies → Timer stamper. Fill in the following fields Starting Time: usually 0.00, Interval (the interval that has been used to capture your photos): in our case 20.00 (min). X/Y-Location allows you to determine the position of your time stamp. By use of Suffix you can specify the unit used (in our case “min”).\nSet the starting point of tubule outgrowth and the end point of tubule growth by the use of the multi-point tool and mark the point of outgrowth in the first and the end of the tubule in the last image of your analysis. By double-clicking on the multi-point button you can tick show on all slices. Then go to the last slice and go to Edit → Draw and then push “Shift” + “a” to remove your points and find them now fixed in your image.\nDraw a straight line between your dots and use Analyze → Measure to measure the length between the two dots which will be given in “μm” according to the settings mentioned above.\nRepeat measurements for all injected cysts and transfer the data sets to a program that allows statistical analysis (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] point of time 01:27–01:33 s).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2378-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. cAMP leads to impaired capacity for tubule formation but is more pronounced in PC1-deficient cells",
