    "All methods described have been approved by our institutional review board and the local ethics committee and they have been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.\n1. Preoperative Radiographic Evaluation\nPerform weight bearing radiographs of the ankle and the foot with antero-posterior, lateral, and rearfoot alignment views (Saltzman's view30).\nPerform a conventional computed tomography (CT) of the ankle and request any other diagnostic exams (such as magnetic resonance), if necessary, to better clarify the diagnosis.\nMeasure the following parameters on the preoperative weight-bearing radiographs.\n\t\nMeasure the anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA, normal value 83.0 ± 3.6 °) on the lateral ankle view: measure the angle between the anatomic axis of the tibia and the line connecting the distal points on the anterior and posterior edge of the tibial articular surface (Figure 1)30,31.\nMeasure the lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA, normal value 89.0 ± 3.0 °) on the anteroposterior ankle view: measure the angle subtended between the anatomic axis of the tibia and the line connecting the distal points on the medial and lateral edge of the tibial articular surface (Figure 2)32,33,34.\nMeasure the tibio-talar ratio (TT ratio, normal value 34.8 ± 3.8%): measure this parameter on the lateral ankle view; it is the ratio between the posterior longitudinal talar length (the length between the posterior talar edge and the intercept of the anatomical tibial axis) and the full longitudinal talar length (Figure 1)33,35,36.\nMeasure the tibio-talar surface angle (normal value 89.0 ± 2.6 °) on the anteroposterior ankle view: measure the angle between the anatomic axis of the tibia and the line connecting the proximal point on the medial and lateral talar articular surface (Figure 2)37.",
    "Use the CT to assess the available bone stock and to evaluate the severity of the avascular necrosis of the talus, if present.\n2. Surgical Technique17\nNOTE: This procedure is performed under general or regional anesthesia (spinal anesthesia).\nPlace the patient in the supine position with a rigid board under the leg to sustain the alignment stand. Position a thick pad under the ipsilateral hip. Do not use a tourniquet.\nMake a longitudinal incision with a scalpel over the lateral malleolus that curves under its tip toward the sinus tarsi (Figure 3). Dissect the fibula and the anterior side of the tibia subperiosteally with the scalpel and the periosteal elevator to obtain a complete view of the osteophytes and the joint.\nRelease the posterior capsule of the tibia and the fibula using a periosteal elevator.\nMake an oblique lateral malleolus osteotomy with a sagittal saw blade: begin from the posterior edge of the fibula, 6-7 cm proximal to the joint line; end on the anterior side of the fibula, 2 cm proximal to the joint line. Rotate the fibular malleolus distally and use a 1.6 mm K-wire to fix it to the calcaneus.\nRemove the anterior osteophytes with the sagittal saw blade and a rongeur until the ankle can be easily placed in a neutral position.\n\tNOTE: The medial gutter release can be performed later during the tibial preparation.\nMeasure the medial/lateral talar width with the manufacturer's sizer, choosing the largest size possible while avoiding overhang.\nPlace the leg in the alignment stand that is assembled at the beginning of the procedure.",
    "Internally rotate the foot and use the trans-calcaneal pin to fix it to the foot plate. Use the 4.0 mm pin to fix the talus to the footplate: put the pin as distal as possible in the talar neck, thus facilitating further correction of talar tilt.\nCheck the tibial alignment with fluoroscopy using a bar that is parallel to the mechanical tibial axis. Use fluoroscopy with the following parameters: 55 kilovolts, 3 milliampere-seconds.\nInsert two 5.0 mm pins on the medial border of the tibia while an assistant pushes the tibia anteriorly if an anterior sagittal talar shifting is present. To increase the rigidity of the construct, an adjunctive carbon fiber bar can be placed in a vertical position.\nVerify the level of the desired joint line with the pointer located through the ''Position'' hole of the cutting guide of the selected size. Check the amount of bone resection with the pointer placed in the ''Talus'' and ''Tibia #1'' hole.\nUse the 4.0 mm drill through the pre-cutting guide to pre-drill the talus and the tibia surfaces. Assemble the bone burr to the pneumatic handpieces and put the contralateral talar trial of the selected size between the bone burr and the cutting guide to assess the medial depth of the bone cut. Then, use the bone burr to make the definitive bone cuts through the ''Talus'' and the ''Tibia #1'' holes of the guide. Use the ''Tibia #2'' hole to reach the whole tibial cut on the medial side and to release osteophytes of the medial gutter\nPosition the rail drill guides. Utilize antero-posterior fluoroscopy to verify they are properly placed to avoid lateral overhang. Drill the rails and position the provisional implant, then choose the insert size.\nInsert the definitive implants using the talar and tibial inserter.",
    "Use fluoroscopy to check the positioning, and use two or three 3.5 mm lag screws to fix the fibula; alternatively, use a plate-fixation of the lateral malleolus, if the deformity requires a malleolar lengthening or shortening that does not leave sufficient contact for screw fixation.\nCheck the stability of the syndesmosis with a bone hookapplied to the lateral malleolus. Gently pull the fibula laterally to assess any residual tibiofibular instability. If a lateral movement of the lateral malleolus is present, stabilize it with a syndesmosis screw fixation across four cortices. Test the ankle range of motion.\nRepair the anterior talofibular ligament with resorbable suture before routine wound-closure.\n3. Postoperative Care\nPlace the leg into a cast and forbid weight-bearing for four weeks. Then allow weight-bearing with a walker-boot for two weeks.\nAllow calf strengthening, proprioceptive training and stretching of the triceps surae six weeks after the surgery.\n4. Clinical and Radiographic Follow-Up\nRadiologically and clinically evaluate patients at one, two, six, and twelve months after the procedure and, afterward, every twelve months. The follow-up protocol consists of function and pain assessment with SF-12, VAS pain score, and AOFAS ankle and hindfoot scores collected at each time-point.\nPerform radiographic examination: request weight-bearing radiographs of the ankle and of the foot with antero-posterior, lateral and Saltzman's view at each end-point.\nMeasure the following parameters on the postoperative radiographs at each end-point.\n\t\nMeasure the alpha angle (α-angle) on the antero-posterior ankle view: measure the angle formed laterally by the anatomical axis of the tibia and the articular surface of the tibial component (Figure 4)38.\nMeasure the beta angle (β-angle) on the lateral ankle view: measure the angle subtended anteriorly by the anatomical axis of the tibia and the articular surface of the tibial component (Figure 5)18,38.",
    "Measure the gamma angle (γ-angle) on the lateral ankle view: measure the angle between a line through the anterior and the posterior edge of the talar component and a line along the center of the talar neck (Figure 5)39.\nMeasure the Tibio-talar ratio.\nMeasure the Tibio-talar surface angle.\nSubscription Required.
