    "Being able to generate sets of overhangs with high fidelity enables the selection of arbitrary fusion sites between parts for modular assembly systems (Damalas et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0005]; Malci et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0016]; Stuttmann et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0026]). To enable the easy creation of high-fidelity overhang sets, we have created a webtool called the NEBridge GetSet Tool based on our ligase fidelity data (Pryor et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0024]). The tool allows the user to select the number of requested overhangs, Type IIS restriction enzyme, and ligation conditions to give optimal overhang sets for a specific use. Specific overhang sequences can also be required or excluded in the algorithmic search used by the program. These features allow for a large amount of control over the overhangs sets generated. Specific entries are provided for an example described in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0005] and the Commentary (see Understanding Results).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/21989237-66af-4abd-af21-c7ca7b5a9831/cpz1882-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nInputs and outputs of the NEBridge GetSet Tool. (A) Input page showing fields for selecting overhang length (1) and ligation conditions (2), entering the number of overhangs to generate (3), and entering any overhangs to be required (4) or excluded (5). In this example, 24 overhangs are requested using cycling BsmBI conditions. (B) Output page showing the generated overhang set (6) and its estimated ligase fidelity (7). Any overhangs required in (A) will appear first in the overhang list, followed by overhangs selected by the program. The ligation fidelity matrix (8) functions the same as in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0003].\nNecessary Resources\nPersonal computer or other device with up-to-date web browser\n1. Navigate to the NEBridge GetSet Tool (https://ligasefidelity.neb.com/getset/run.cgi[href=https://ligasefidelity.neb.com/getset/run.cgi]).\n2. Select the overhang length of your overhang set from the “Overhang length” drop-down menu. For our example, select 4-base.",
    "This setting determines which ligation conditions will be available in the next step by separating the 3- and 4-base overhang datasets (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0005]).\n3. Select the most representative ligation conditions from the “Ligation conditions” drop-down menu. For our example, select BsmBI-v2 42-16 cycling.\nThis setting selects which available ligation fidelity dataset will be used for the ligation fidelity estimation calculations. The datasets available fall into two categories: (1) ligation-only datasets that assess ligation of pre-generated overhangs by T4 or T7 ligase under static incubation temperatures (Potapov, Ong, Kucera, et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0021]; Potapov, Ong, Langhorst, et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0022]) and (2) datasets generated by incubating a Type IIS restriction enzyme and T4 ligase under various conditions mimicking GGA protocols (Pryor et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0024]). For the most accurate predictions, the dataset selected should match the digestion, ligation, and cycling conditions to be used for assembly.\n4. Enter the desired number of overhangs for the set in the “Number of overhangs” field. For our example, enter 24.\nThis setting determines the size of the overhang set that will be returned by the program. The allowable input ranges from 2 to 50 (inclusive).\n5. Input any required overhangs into the “Required overhangs (5′→3′)” field. For our example, leave this field blank.",
    "Overhangs entered into this field will be automatically selected by the search algorithm and will always appear in the final overhang set. Overhang sequences must be in the 5′→3′ direction. Which overhang of a pair is submitted is arbitrary, as the software automatically generates the reverse complement sequence as part of the algorithm. Overhang length should match the length selected in step 1. Only canonical A, C, G, and T bases are supported. Incorrect or duplicate overhangs prevent the program from running and are automatically flagged with an error message. Spaces (if any) are excluded. Overhangs may be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case.\n6. Input any overhangs to be excluded into the “Excluded overhangs (5′→3′)” field. For our example, leave this field blank.\nOverhangs entered into this field will be excluded from possible solutions and will not appear in the final overhang set. No assessment will be given to the compatibility of the solution provided and any excluded overhangs; excluded overhangs are simply not permitted in the calculations. This feature can be used to exclude potentially problematic overhangs, including homopolymers (e.g., CCCC) and overhangs with the sequence TNNA (which have low ligation efficiency), although we rarely find this necessary to achieve high assembly efficiency. The input restrictions for overhangs noted in step 4 apply here as well. Overhangs entered into both the required and excluded fields are treated as required.\n7. Click “Submit”.",
    "The program will return a list of overhangs as well as a fidelity visualization similar to that provided by the NEBridge Ligase Fidelity Viewer (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0005]). See Understanding Results for more on interpreting these outputs. Note that when submissions are repeated with the same parameters, different solutions with similar estimated fidelity will be provided. The search algorithm is not deterministic and instead attempts to find a fidelity maximum from randomized initial steps. Thus, different runs can provide different solutions of similar fidelity estimates. To retrieve a specific prior calculation, record the Request ID, which can be entered on the submission page of the NEBridge GetSet Tool to retrieve a previous submission output. Note that prior runs are only stored for a limited amount of time.",
    "A particularly useful application of the NEBridge GetSet Tool is the expansion of an existing overhang set to add more compatible fusion sites while maintaining high set fidelity. This application of NEBridge GetSet supports adding new fragments to an existing assembly, finding optimal overhangs for subdividing existing fragments within an assembly, and expanding existing standard overhang sets (e.g., MoClo). This protocol covers how to use NEBridge GetSet to generate additional overhangs and how to redesign an existing assembly to incorporate the new overhangs. As an example, we describe how to expand the LacIZ assembly (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0005], Supporting Information Table S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section]) to add three additional fragments (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0006]) that encode two new selection markers, superfolder GFP (sfGFP, fluorescence) and an AmpR cassette (ampicillin resistance). NEBridge GetSet is used to select new fusion sites compatible with the existing assembly, and these new fusion sites are used to design new fragments and modify existing ones to generate the expanded assembly (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0006] and Supporting Information Table S2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4ad76b42-77f2-4a28-b1aa-19e3b0026a61/cpz1882-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Example expansion from a 12-part LacIZ assembly to 15-part assembly. (A) Assembly design. For the 12-part assembly, 12 insert fragments are combined with the destination vector at 13 fusion sites to form the final assembly. For the 15-part assembly, three new fragments (AmpR-1, AmpR-2, and sfGFP) plus one modified fragment (LacIZ-F1*) replace LacIZ-F1, adding three new fusion sites. The remaining 12 fragments (11 insert fragments plus the destination vector) are reused in the expanded assembly. (B) Example plates of the 15-part assembly demonstrating expression of LacIZ (blue/white; left) and sfGFP (fluorescence; right). Quantitation in CFU/μl is also shown. Blue + GFP represents colonies displaying both blue and fluorescence, indicating correct assembly. Blue only, white + GFP, and white only represent colonies that sfGFP expression, LacZ expression, or both. As assemblies were plated on Cam/Amp plates, all colonies contain the AmpR fragments. (C) Output page of NEBridge GetSet showing the generated overhang set used to design the 15-part expanded LacIZ assembly (1), the estimated ligation fidelity (2), and the ligation fidelity matrix (3). The associated NEBridge GetSet input page can be seen in Supporting Information Figure S5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section].\nNecessary Resources\nPersonal computer or other device with up-to-date web browser\nPlain text, comma-delineated list of fusion site overhangs from the assembly to expand\nExample set: GGAG, GGCA, TCGC, CAGT, TCCA, GAAT, AGTA, TCTT, CAAA, GCAC, AACG, GTCT, CCAT\nSequence files for known part sequences in plain text, FASTA, GenBank, or similar format\nExample files: see Supporting Information GenBank files 12-part_LacIZ_Assembly, 15-part_Expanded_LacIZ_Assembly\n1. Begin as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0002], steps 1-3. For our example, select 4-base for overhang length and BsaI-HFv2 37-16 cycling for ligation conditions.\n2. In the “Number of overhangs” field, enter the number of overhangs in the current set plus the desired number of new overhangs. For our example, enter 16.",
    "This setting determines the size of the overhang set that will be returned by the program. Any overhangs required in the next step are counted toward this value, so the number of overhangs requested in excess to the number of required overhangs determines the number of new overhangs the program will return. In our example, 16 overhangs are requested with 13 required (starting) overhangs, meaning NEBridge GetSet will search for 3 new overhangs.\n3. Enter the current overhang set to be expanded into the “Required overhangs (5′→3′)” field. For our example, enter:\nGGAG, GGCA, TCGC, CAGT, TCCA, GAAT, AGTA, TCTT, CAAA, GCAC, AACG, GTCT, CCAT\n4. Input any overhangs to be excluded in the “Excluded overhangs (5′→3′)” field. For our example, leave this field blank.\n5. Click “Submit”.\nThe program will return a list of overhangs that includes the required overhangs plus additional fusion sites, as well as the fidelity visualizations. See Understanding Results for an explanation of the output.\n6. Identify new overhang sequences. The new overhang set is listed in the order of the required sequences as entered (step 3) followed by the newly generated overhangs (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0006]). For our example, the new overhangs are CTGA, GATA, and ACAA.",
    "As noted in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0002], the search algorithm is not deterministic and can provide different solutions of similar fidelity estimates when repeated submissions are made with the same parameters. When following this protocol for the example provided, it is very likely the user will obtain a set with different specific overhangs suggested. Overhang sets with differences in estimated fidelity of <5% are difficult to distinguish in practical applications and can be treated at equivalent. The overhang set selected for our example has an estimated fidelity of 98%. To retrieve a specific prior calculation, record the Request ID, which can be entered on the submission page of NEBridge GetSet to retrieve a previous submission output. Note that prior runs are only stored for a limited amount of time.\n7. Determine placement of the new fusion sites in the expanded assembly. For our example, two of the new overhang sequences are placed at new fusion sites and the third connects the new fragments to the existing assembly (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0006]).\nWhile new fusion site placement is highly dependent on the situation, some considerations are presented below (see Understanding Results). For our example, Fusion Site A was placed in the middle of the AmpR gene, Fusion Site B was placed between AmpR and sfGFP, and Fusion Site C replaces the original fusion site between the destination plasmid and the original assembly.\n8. Assign new overhang sequences to new fusion sites. For our example, ACAA was placed at Fusion Site A, GATA was placed at Fusion Site B, and CTGA was placed at Fusion Site C.",
    "Depending on the situation, the placement of overhangs at fusion sites can be completely arbitrary or highly specific (for some considerations, see Understanding Results). For our example, a natural occurrence of ACAA was located near the desired Fusion Site A location in the AmpR gene and was used as an overhang. The overhangs GATA and CTGA were inserted by replacing existing sequences at Fusions Sites B and C.\n9. Determine insert sequences for new fragments. After placement of the new overhangs in the assembly sequence, insert sequences can be extracted by taking the sequence between the two overhangs (inclusive of the overhangs). For our example, the insert sequences can be found in Supporting Information Table S2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section].\nFor our example, the fragments are defined as AmpR-1 (Fusion Site 1 to Fusion Site A), AmpR-2 (Fusion Site A to Fusion Site B), and sfGFP (Fusion Site B to Fusion Site C).\n10. Convert insert sequences into Golden Gate fragments. The insert sequences extracted in the previous step lack Type IIS sites and associated spacers, which must be added. For our example, which uses BsmBI, CGTCTCA (spacer) was added to the 5′ ends of the insert sequences and TGAGACG was added to the 3′ end before synthesis and insertion into to the EcoRV site of pUC57-mini-BsaI-Free or pUC57-mini-Kana-BsmBI-Free (Supporting Information Table S3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section]).",
    "Depending on the situation, fragment sequences can be generated in multiple ways, including PCR from existing or synthetic templates (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0008]), plasmids containing DNA from existing or synthetic sources (used in this example), or direct use of synthetic DNA (see Strategic Planning). The critical factor in all cases is the presence of at least 6 bp of 5′ sequence followed by the desired Type IIS recognition site and an appropriate spacer for that Type IIS enzyme (1 bp for BsaI, BsmBI/Esp3I, and SapI/BspQI; 2 bp for BbsI/BpiI; 4 bp for PaqCI/AarI).\n11. Modify an existing fragment to be compatible with the expanded assembly. The last step of expanding an assembly is resolving the conflict that results from inserting fragments into an existing fusion site. For our example, the new fragments are inserted at the GGAG fusion site of the existing assembly and the destination plasmid. This fusion site is part of the destination plasmid and is positionally locked; therefore, the fragment forming the other half of that fusion site must be changed. Here, that requires the GGAG overhang of fragment LacIZ-1 to be changed to the Fusion Site C overhang of CTGA. For final assembly sequence, see Supporting Information GenBank file 15-part_Expanded_LacIZ_Assembly.\nThe best strategy to make the required overhang change depends on the method of fragment generation used for the pre-expansion assembly. For fragments carried in plasmids, site-directed mutagenesis is an economical method. For PCR-generated fragments, a primer change is likely all that is required. However, depending on circumstance, any technique that generates DNA with the required overhang will work.\n12. Generate fragment DNA and perform assembly and transformation (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0005]). Plate transformants on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 µg/ml), IPTG (0.2 mM), and X-gal (80 µg/ml).",

    "One of the most powerful uses of DAD-driven Golden Gate Assembly is the division of existing sequences into fragments suitable for assembly using the NEBridge SplitSet Tool. NEBridge SplitSet can select high-fidelity overhang sets from a sequence using defined search windows and input parameters similar to NEBridge GetSet. As an example, we describe the division of the ∼40-kb T7 bacteriophage genome into 12 fragments. To perform the assembly from these 12 fragments, see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0007].\nNecessary Resources\nPersonal computer or other device with up-to-date web browser\nGeneious, SnapGene, or similar software for browsing and editing sequence data\nSequence file for the target to be assembled as plain text, FASTA, GenBank or other format. The sequence must contain only canonical nucleotides with no ambiguous positions.\nExample: T7 genome sequence (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/V01146.1?report=fasta[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/V01146.1?report=fasta])\n1. Using available sequence analysis software, find existing Type IIS enzyme recognition sites in the target sequence. For our example, PaqCI (AarI isochizomer) sites were identified in the T7 bacteriophage genome using Geneious. The wild-type T7 genome has five sites at positions 3942-3948, 8771-8777, 9387-9393, 9949-9955, and 17729-17735 (see Supporting Information Table S4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section] for gene contexts).\nAny suitable software may be used for genome analysis, including online tools (i.e., NEBCutter at https://nc3.neb.com/NEBcutter/[href=https://nc3.neb.com/NEBcutter/]) and free software tools (i.e., SnapGene). Identification can also be done by simply searching for the PaqCI recognition site (5′-CACCTGC-3′) within the genomic sequence. For a discussion of the logic in selecting which restriction specificity to use in designing an assembly, see Strategic Planning.\n2. Navigate to the NEBridge SplitSet Tool at https://ligasefidelity.neb.com/splitset/run.cgi[href=https://ligasefidelity.neb.com/splitset/run.cgi].\n3. Enter assembly name into the “Assembly name” field. For our example, enter T7-PaqCI.\nThis field acts as a naming prefix for fragment sequences output by the tool. The default value is “MyAssembly” (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0007]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ecaeda89-ebc6-464c-939f-74d06371f8c3/cpz1882-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",

The matrix functions the same as in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0003]. The tool also outputs additional data on overhang location and fragment sequences (Supporting Information Fig. S6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#support-information-section]). (C) Example of a domestication mutation introduced by PCR. The PaqCI site located at 3942-3948 was removed by the substitution A3944T, which generates a silent mutation in Ala258 of the RNA polymerase.\n4. Select whether the assembly will be linear or circular. For our example, select circular.\nFor linear assemblies, the tool treats the entered sequences as linear, using the first entered base as position 1. For circular assemblies, the tool presumes a continuous sequence that fuses position 1 and the last nucleotide position. While T7 phage is naturally a linear genome, in this example we assemble a circular version. For details on why, see Understanding Results and Pryor et al. (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0023]).\n5. Select the overhang length from the “Overhang length” drop-down menu. For our example, select 4-base.\nThis setting determines which ligation conditions will be available in the next step by separating the 3- and 4-base overhang datasets.\n6. Select the most representative ligation conditions from the “Ligation conditions” drop-down menu. For our example, select PaqCI, 1× T4 DNA Ligase buffer, 37-16 cycling.",
    "This setting selects which available ligation fidelity dataset will be used for the ligation fidelity estimation calculations. The datasets available fall into two categories: (1) ligation-only datasets that assess ligation of pre-generated overhangs by T4 or T7 ligase under static incubation temperatures (Potapov, Ong, Kucera, et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0021]; Potapov, Ong, Langhorst, et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0022]) and (2) datasets generated by incubating a Type IIS restriction enzyme and T4 ligase under various conditions mimicking GGA protocols (Pryor et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0024]). For highest accuracy predictions, the dataset selected should match the digestion, ligation, and cycling conditions to be used for assembly.\n7. Enter the full sequence to be assembled in the “Nucleotide Sequence” field. For our example, enter the full T7 bacteriophage genomic sequence.\n8. Leave the box “Use terminal overhangs as fusion sites (for linear assemblies only)” unchecked.\nThis setting selects whether the 5′- and 3′-terminal three or four nucleotides (selected overhang length) will be included as overhangs for the ligation fidelity calculations. This setting is particularly helpful when designing linear assemblies for insertion into a destination plasmid. Note that the 5′- and 3′-terminal nucleotides must be complementary to the destination plasmid.\n9. For “Define split regions based on”, select the option appropriate for the assembly from the drop-down menu. For our example, select Split regions.",
    "The four options for defining the split regions are number of fragments, maximal fragment size, minimal fragment size, and split regions. The number of fragments setting will divide the sequence evenly into the number of fragments requested in the following field. Note that the number of fusion sites to be defined for the next step will depend on whether a linear or circular assembly was selected, as the number of fusion sites needed for a circular assembly is always one greater than the number of fusion sites for the same number of fragments for a linear assembly. The maximal and minimal fragment size options work similarly to the number of fragments setting, but choose the number of fragments based on the fragment size minima or maxima entered in the following field. These settings can be useful when fragments need to conform to vendor requirements for synthetic DNAs. The split regions setting allows the user to predefine the windows or fusion site locations by entering range windows in the form of comma-delineated “window-start-position” and “window-end-position” inputs. The allowable input range for all settings is 3–50 fragments (inclusive). The “Use terminal overhangs as fusion sites (for linear assemblies only)” check adds two additional overhangs to linear assemblies, but the positions of these overhangs cannot be edited.\n10. In the field following the drop-down menu, enter the predefined split regions for the assembly. For our example, enter:\n3940-3950, 8770-8780, 9385-9395, 9952-9962, 15575-15585, 17725-17735, 23290-23300, 26630-26640, 29715-29725, 29945-29955, 33260-33270, 36584-36594",
    "In this example, some fusion sites are restricted to locations near where PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis will be used to introduce domesticating mutations at native PaqCI sites, with a narrow search window of ±5 nucleotides. We recommend keeping fusion sites within 10 nucleotides of domestication targets, if possible, as making mutations too far from the fusion site can lead to mismatches close to the 3′ end of the primer. Where there is higher flexibility in placing the fusion sites, the search windows can be set wider (i.e., 50-200 base pairs). For more information on break point placement, see Understanding Results and Strategic Planning.\n11. Click “Define split regions”.\nSince the split regions setting was chosen, the values entered in step 10 will automatically define the regions of the genome the tool can use to select fusions sites for each breakpoint. If another setting was chosen, the tool will automatically define these windows based on fragment number or maximal/minimal fragment size by selecting equally spaced fusion sites with windows of ±25 nucleotides. When “Define split regions” is pressed, the default selections are presented. The default values are suitable for many assemblies, but the user can manually modify the default break point regions and search window.\n12. Input any overhangs to be excluded in the “Excluded overhangs (5′→3′)” field. For our example, leave this field blank.",
    "As in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0002], these overhangs will be completely excluded, with no consideration as to whether the selected overhang set is compatible with the excluded overhangs. This input simply prevents these overhangs from being used in the final set. This feature can be useful to exclude potentially problematic overhangs including homopolymers (e.g., CCCC) and overhangs with the sequence TNNA (which have low ligation efficiency). This feature can also be used to exclude specific fusion site candidates when performing iterative optimization).\n13. Click “Submit”.\nThe protocol will take seconds to several minutes to run, depending on the number of fragments requested. The outputs will be similar to the fidelity table and fusion site list produced by NEBridge GetSet (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0002]) and will additionally include a list of sequences of all fragments, inclusive of the upstream and downstream overhangs.

For this example, the sequence GGCTACCACCTGCGACT (spacers) was added to the 5′ end of all primers.\nThe 5′ primer extension structure consists of an end spacer to ensure full activity of the restriction enzyme (we use GGCTAC as a universal 6-bp end spacer), the Type IIS recognition site (CACCTGC for PaqCI), and a restriction enzyme–specific spacer (a 4-bp spacer is required for PaqCI).\n15. Introduce silent point mutations in appropriate primers to domesticate fragments.

    "The most common application of GGA is the creation of plasmids assembled from multiple fragments. In this protocol, GGA is used for a one-pot assembly of 12 DNA fragments into a destination plasmid with a selectable antibiotic resistance marker. We recommend this protocol for assemblies of 12-23 fragments. In this example, illustrated in Figure 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-fig-0006], the fragments assemble to form a cassette of LacI and LacZ, which, when plated on X-gal, produce blue colonies following correct assembly and white colonies following incorrect assembly (Potapov, Ong, Kucera, et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0021]; Pryor et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0024]). Fusion sites for the assembly were selected following Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0004]. The fragments are flanked on the 5′ and 3′ ends by Type IIS recognition sites (in this case BsmBI) and a spacer nucleotide. DNA fragments are cloned into holding plasmids, which are used directly in the assembly.

However, increasing the number of cycles rarely causes a decrease in efficiency or fidelity.\nFor the sequence of the completed assembly, see Supporting Information GenBank file 12-part_LacIZ_Assembly.\n4.

We suspect that this is due to many incorrect assemblies being incomplete (i.e., linear) and therefore unable to be transformed, resulting in an undercount of white colonies. If not using a visual method, clones containing full-length assemblies can be identified using colony PCR (Woodman et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-bib-0032]). If DAD principles were used to design a high-accuracy assembly (e.g., Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0002] or 3), assemblies containing all fragments are very likely to be fully correct. However, sequencing is recommended for final validation of constructs, especially for assemblies containing PCR-generated fragments.",
    "This protocol describes an alternative GGA protocol for one-pot assembly of 24 or more DNA fragments into a destination plasmid with a selectable antibiotic resistance marker. In this example, the insert fragments assemble the same LacI and LacZ cassette as in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0005], but using twice the number of insert fragments, each of which are roughly half the size. The insert fragments are split such that the overhangs of the 12-fragment assembly are reused in the 24-fragment assembly. The ability to split fragments in this manner is a good demonstration of the flexibility GGA, where fragments of the 12-fragment assembly can be replaced with 24-fragment counterparts, enabling easier part swapping and system engineering. The assembly used for this protocol also allows one to assess the effect of increasing fragment number on assembly efficiency using the same end product. Although fragment size in and of itself does not appear to be an important factor in assembly, very small (<25 bp) or very large (>>10 kb) fragments can experience normal issues with DNAs of those sizes. Namely, very small DNA duplexes are thermally unstable and can melt, while very large DNAs can experience shearing or other mechanical damage. Within these extremes, fragment size is arbitrary and can be dictated by a number of external factors, such as the length of synthetic DNA that can be acquired from a vendor.

The number of cycles can be increased beyond 60, but with diminishing returns as the Type IIS enzyme and T4 DNA ligase will typically begin to degrade with large cycle counts.

    "The amount of dilution required will vary based on the source of the DNA. Amplicon DNA generated using Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0008] will likely require no dilution.

Add 10 µl diluted DNA sample to each tube. Vortex for 2-3 s and microcentrifuge for 2-3 s.\nWe find that using 10 µl sample gives a more consistent measurement of the concentration, but this must be balanced with the proportion of the sample used for measurement. For samples generated following Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0008], the sample concentration is generally <50 ng/µl and using 1 µl sample for quantification consumes ∼7% of the total sample volume, making the use of >1 µl impractical. For high-concentration samples, the use of small portions of the total sample to gain higher accuracy measurements is generally worth the sample consumption.\n10. Repeat steps 5-6 to take measurements.\n11. Determine the sample concentration by multiplying the measured concentration by the dilution factor in step 7. Use this concentration to generate the parts master mix.\nIn cases where extreme concentration accuracy is desired, multiple measurements can be performed and averaged to increase accuracy.\nIf sample concentrations are too low to prepare a parts master mix, samples can be concentrated by repeating the column purification (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.882#cpz1882-prot-0008], steps 4-19) using a smaller elution volume.

Collect an agar plug of a single, isolated T7 phage assembly plaque by plunging a glass Pasteur pipet to the bottom of the plate through the agar. Wiggle the pipet slightly to loosen the plug from the plate and remove the pipet.\nThe agar plug should be visible in the pipet tip.\n4. Eject the plug into 1 ml phage dilution buffer in a 1.5-ml DNA LoBind tube. Agitate the tube gently to diffuse the phage particles into the buffer.\n5. Inoculate the bacterial culture with 100 µl phage suspension.",
    "The amount of phage required depends on the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the phage and the titer of the isolated phage particles. We find that an MOI of ∼0.01 works well for T7 phage, and that plaques collected as above generally have titers of ∼1 × 108 PFU/ml. Therefore, 100 µl of phage particle suspension should give an MOI of ∼0.01 assuming that an OD600 of 0.1 = 8 × 107 cells/ml.\n6. Incubate at 37°C (225 rpm) and monitor phage propagation by measuring the drop in OD600. Phage propagation is complete when the culture appears clear by eye and has an OD600 < 0.1.\nOptimal conversion of the bacterial host into phage particles is achieved if the MOI used is low enough that the OD600 continues to increase for multiple hours post infection. This continued growth allows a significant amount of cell mass to be produced before the majority of cells infected by bacteriophage. If the OD600 decreases in <1 hr, it is advisable to reduce the amount of virus used.\n7. Transfer the culture to a 50-ml centrifuge tube and pellet residual cells and cell debris by centrifuging 20 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C. Decant the supernatant into a new 50-ml tube.\n8.

Add 300 µl HMW gDNA Tissue Lysis Buffer and 20 µl proteinase K and incubate in a thermal mixer at 56°C for at least 45 min with agitation at 300 rpm.\nThe combination of proteinase K and heat degrades the viral capsid and releases the genomic DNA.\n14. Add 300 µl Protein Separation Solution, mix by inverting for 1 min, and centrifuge 10 min at 16,000 × g.\nSeparation will result in a large, clear, upper phase containing DNA and a lower phase containing proteins and lipids.\n15. Transfer the upper DNA-containing phase to a Monarch 2-ml Tube and add two DNA Capture Beads.\nFor phages with small genomes (e.g., the ∼40-kb T7 genome), a standard 1000-µl pipet tip will work for this transfer. For larger genomes, a wide-bore pipet is recommended.\n16. Add 550 µl isopropanol and mix for 4 min on a tube rotator to bind DNA to the beads.\nThe DNA should be evident as a white mass wrapped around the glass beads.\n17.
