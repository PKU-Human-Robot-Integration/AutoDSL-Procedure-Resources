    "1. Expression of His6-Tlp3-LBD in E. coli\nInoculate 150 mL of sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 50 µg mL-1 ampicillin with BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIPL cells transformed with the pET151/D-TOPO vector for expression of His6-Tlp3-LBD (amino acid residues 42-291), and incubate it at 37 °C in a shaker (orbit diameter, 25 mm) with 200 rpm overnight.\nPrepare six 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 800 mL of sterile LB broth and 50 µg mL-1 ampicillin. Inoculate each flask with 20 mL of the overnight culture obtained from step 1.1. Incubate them at 37 °C with continuous shaking at 200 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm reaches 0.6.\nTake a 1 mL aliquot from one of the flasks (uninduced control sample), pellet using a benchtop centrifuge (13,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min) and discard the supernatant. Store the bacterial pellet at -20 °C for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.\nInduce protein expression by adding 1 mM of isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to each flask with culture. Continue incubating the flasks at 37 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm for an additional 4 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the procedure can be paused by placing the cell pellet into a -80 °C freezer for storage.\n2. Isolation and Denaturation of Inclusion Bodies\nTransfer all the cell pellets obtained in step 1.5 to a 250 mL beaker and add 100 mL of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). Allow the cells to thaw completely (if frozen), and resuspend the pellet. Keep the sample on ice unless indicated otherwise.\nPass the resuspended cells through a high-pressure homogeniser three times to lyse the cells and ensure complete shearing of the genomic DNA.",
    "Centrifuge the lysate at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Collect a 1 mL sample of the supernatant (soluble fraction) and store it at -20 °C for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis. Discard the rest of the supernatant and place the pellet on ice.\n\tNOTE: This pellet is white in color (easily distinguishable from unbroken cells which are the shade of brown in color) and contains inclusion bodies.\nResuspend the inclusion bodies pellet thoroughly in 20 mL of ice-cold buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1% Triton X-100). This facilitates solubilisation of the membrane and membrane proteins. Vortex for 1 - 2 min to aid resuspension.\nCentrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet thoroughly in 20 mL of ice-cold buffer B by vortexing the tube for 1 - 2 min. Ensure that the pellet is broken into small pieces. Pipet the sample up and down to aid pellet resuspension.\n\tNOTE: It is important to resuspend the pellet thoroughly to obtain inclusion bodies free from impurities.\nRepeat step 2.5. If the supernatant is cloudy or coloured, repeat steps 2.6 and 2.5 (in that order) until the supernatant is clear and colourless.\nResuspend the pellet in 20 mL of ice-cold buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM PMSF) by vortexing the tube for 1 - 2 min.\nRepeat step 2.5.\nAdd 25 mL of ice-cold denaturing buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 8 M urea, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mM PMSF) to dissolve the inclusion bodies pellet. Resuspend thoroughly by vortexing for 1 - 2 min, or until the pellet is broken into small pieces.",
    "Mix the suspension by axial rotation with a rotation rate of 30 rpm for 30 - 120 min at 4 °C.\nClarify the denatured protein solution by centrifugation at 30,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min, place the supernatant on ice and discard the pellet.\nMeasure the protein concentration using the Bradford assay.24 Take an aliquot for SDS-gel analysis and place it at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: At this point, the procedure can be paused by snap-freezing the aliquoted sample in liquid nitrogen and keep it at -80 °C for storage.\n3. Protein Refolding\nPrepare 250 mL of buffer E (3 M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.4 M L-arginine monohydrochloride, 20 mM reduced L-glutathione, 2 mM oxidized L-glutathione) in a 500 mL beaker and cool the buffer down to 4 °C.\nAdd 60 mg of denatured protein mix containing His6-Tlp3-LBD obtained in step 2.13 to 250 mL of buffer E, while stirring the buffer at 500 rpm. Incubate the refolding mix at 4 °C with continuous stirring at 500 rpm for 24 - 48 h. The final protein concentration in this step is 0.2 mg mL-1.\nPrepare 7 L of buffer A in an 8 - 10 L bucket and cool it down to 4 °C in preparation for the next step (step 3.4) that will take place in 24 - 48 h (see the flowchart in Figure 1).\nImmerse an ~50 cm piece of dialysis tubing of 28 mm inflated diameter, with molecular weight cut-off at 12 - 14 kDa into 200 mL of 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-Na2) and heat it over a gas flame until boiling. Rinse the dialysis membrane with 200 mL of ddH2O.",
    "Clamp one end of the dialysis membrane with a dialysis tubing closure and transfer the 250 mL refolding mixture obtained in step 3.2 into the dialysis tube. Close the open end with another clamp. Check the integrity of the membrane to ensure there are no leaks.\nPlace the dialysis tube in a dialysis bucket with the pre-cooled 7 L of buffer A prepared in step 3.3. Place a magnetic stir bar, ensuring that it will not touch the dialysis tubing while stirring.\nDialyse the sample at 4 °C with continuing stirring at 500 rpm and change the buffer at least four times over a period of 12 h. After the last buffer change, leave the sample to dialyse overnight.\n\tNOTE: During dialysis, the excess of urea (~3 M) is gradually removed from the denatured protein solution, which allows the protein to refold. Heavy protein precipitation can be observed at the end of dialysis.\nRemove the dialysis tube from the bucket and transfer its contents into a 500 mL beaker. Keep the protein solution on ice, unless indicated otherwise.\nFilter the protein solution through a 0.43 µm pore size membrane into a 500 mL glass bottle to remove any precipitated protein.\n4. Purification of His6-tagged Protein Using Immobilised Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography\nCharge and equilibrate a 5 mL prepacked chelating column.\nConnect the column to a peristaltic pump, ensuring that there is no air trapped in the connecting tubing.\nWash the column by passing through 25 - 50 mL of ddH2O.\nCharge the column by loading 3 mL of 0.1 M NiCl2 and then passing through 25 mL of ddH2O.\nEquilibrate the column with 25 mL of buffer F (loading buffer, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole).",
    "Adjust the refolded protein sample obtained in step 3.9 to the composition of buffer F by adding 2.5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mL of 5 M NaCl and 2.5 mL of 2 M imidazole stock solutions.\nLoad the sample onto the column at a rate of 5 mL/min or less and discard the flow-through (unbound proteins).\nWash the column with 50 - 100 mL of buffer F to remove non-specifically bound proteins and discard the flow-through.\nElute His6-Tlp3-LBD with 25 mL of buffer G (elution buffer, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) and pool the flow-through fractions containing the protein (as determined by using the Bradford reagent).\nMeasure the protein concentration in the pooled sample using the Bradford assay. Take a small aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis and place at -20 °C.\n5. His6-tag Removal Using TEV Protease (Optional)\nPrepare, and cool down to 4 °C, 4 L of buffer H (TEV cleavage buffer, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM DTT).\nCut approximately 5 - 7 cm of dialysis tubing (diameter 2 - 3 cm) and immerse it in 200 mL of ddH2O.\nAdd His6-tagged TEV protease to the His6-tag protein prepared in step 4.5 to a final molar ratio 1 TEV: 8 protein.\nClamp one end of the tubing with a dialysis tubing closure and fill it with the protein/TEV protease mixture. Close the other end and ensure there are no leaks.\nPlace the dialysis tube into the pre-cooled 4 L of buffer H (from step 5.1) and incubate it at 4 °C with continuous stirring for 2 h. Change the buffer and continue dialysis overnight to allow the TEV-mediated cleavage reaction to complete.",
    "In the meantime, prepare and cool (4 °C) 4 L of buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % (v/v) glycerol) in preparation for the next day.\nAfter the overnight dialysis, exchange the buffer to buffer I prepared in step 5.6 and dialyse for a further 1 - 2 h at 4 °C.\nRemove the tube from the dialysis bucket, unclip one end of the tube and transfer the protein solution to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Filter the solution through a 0.43 µm pore size syringe filter and keep it on ice, unless stated otherwise.\nMeasure the volume of the sample and adjust the Tris, NaCl and imidazole concentration to the composition of buffer F (e.g. for 25 mL of protein solution in buffer J add 0.25 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.75 mL of 5 M NaCl, and 0.25 mL of 2 M imidazole).\nPrepare a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating HP column as described in step 4.1.\nLoad the sample onto the column (flow rate: 5 mL/min) and collect the flow-through, which contains the untagged Tlp3-LBD (residues 42 - 291). Uncleaved protein, the cleaved His6-tag and His6-TEV are retained by the column.\nWash the column with 5 mL buffer F (loading buffer) to allow all untagged protein to flow through and collect the eluate.\nPool the eluate obtained in steps 5.11 and 5.12 and measure the protein concentration. Take a small aliquot and store it at -20 °C for SDS-PAGE analysis.\n6. Size-exclusion Chromatography (Gel Filtration) of Tlp3-LBD\nPrepare 1 L of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and filter it using a 0.43 µm membrane.\nEquilibrate a 26/60 size-exclusion column with buffer A at a flow rate of 4 mL/min.",
    "Concentrate the protein sample obtained in step 5.13 to a volume of 3 - 4 mL using 15 mL centrifugal concentrator with a 10 kDa cut-off (4 °C, 4,000 x g).\nClarify the protein solution by centrifugation at 13,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min to remove any precipitated protein.\nLoad the sample onto the pre-equilibrated 26/60 gel filtration column. Perform chromatography in buffer A at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. Monitor the UV trace. Tlp3-LBD elutes at a retention volume of 210 - 220 mL. Pool the peak fractions.\nMeasure the protein concentration. Take a small aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis.\n7. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Samples Collected at Various Stages of Protein Purification\nPrepare 1 L of SDS-PAGE running buffer (buffer J), containing 25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine pH 8.3, and 0.1 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).\nPrepare 10 mL of 5x SDS-PAGE loading buffer (buffer K), containing 0.25 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05% bromophenol blue.\nAllow the aliquots collected during the different steps of the purification (steps 1.3, 2.3, 2.13, 4.6, 5.13, 6.6) to thaw.\nFor each sample, mix the volume corresponding to 15 µg of total protein with 2 µL of 5x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and adjust the volume to 10 µL with ddH2O.\nHeat the samples at 95 °C for 5 - 10 min, spin them at 10,000 x g for 30 s and transfer the samples into a clean tube.",
    "Prepare an SDS-PAGE gel, using 15% polyacrylamide separating gel (for 5 mL: 2.5 mL 30% (w/v) bis-acrylamide, 1.2 mL 1.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 1.2 mL ddH2O, 50 µL 10% (w/v) SDS, 50 µL 20% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS), 3 µL tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and 5% polyacrylamide stacking gel (for 2 mL: 340 µL 30% (w/v) bis-acrylamide, 250 µL 1 M Tris pH 6.8, 1.37 mL ddH2O, 20 µL 10% (w/v) SDS, 20 µL 20% (w/v) APS, 2 µL TEMED).\nAssemble the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with 1x SDS page running buffer as per manufacturer's recommendation.\nLoad a protein molecular weight marker and the samples prepared in step 7.5. Perform the electrophoresis at a constant current of 25 mA.\nTransfer the gel into a container and rinse it with ddH2O. Add 150 mL of the Coomassie Blue staining solution containing 25% (v/v) isopropanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.03% (w/v) Brilliant Blue R-250. Place the container on a horizontal rotation platform for 30 min at room temperature.\nRinse the gel with ddH2O and place into the destaining solution containing 5% (v/v) methanol and 7% (v/v) acetic acid. Destain while mixing using a horizontal rotation platform for 1 h.\nImage the gel and analyse.\n8. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy Analysis of Secondary Structure of refolded Pure Protein\nTransfer 0.5 - 1 mg of refolded protein obtained in step 6.6 into a dialysis tube and place it in a dialysis bucket containing 5 L of buffer L (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4), precooled to 4 °C.
