    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSingle-cell CITE-Seq can provide great insight to complex biological systems, uncover cellular heterogeneity and reveal novel characteristics (Peterson et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Stoeckius et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Combining single-cell sorting with single-cell CITE-Seq provides unparalleled resolution to deeply characterize rare cell populations (Mair et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; See et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). This protocol was generated to streamline the process of staining cells with flow cytometry antibodies and AOCs. The stained cells can be directly utilized for downstream cell sorting followed by single-cell capture.\nOptional step: Flow proxy experiment to evaluate the compatibility for the same protein marker of fluorescent antibody and AOC\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nWhen the fluorescent antibody and AOC against the same protein marker are used simultaneously, regardless of the binding epitopes, it is highly recommended to perform a flow proxy experiment to evaluate the compatibility of the two antibodies and the possible signal loss of the co-stained sample compared to the single-stained sample.\nIf there are no overlapping proteins between the fluorescent panel and the AOC panel, move directly to the “co-staining PBMCs with a fluorescent panel and an AOC panel[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]” section.\nObtain PBMCs at a concentration of ∼1 × 107 cells/mL. Use 0.5–1 million cells for each sample. It is essential to account for sufficient cells for use in 6 different samples per protein marker.\nFor cells containing myeloid cells and B cells, blocking potential non-specific Fc receptor-mediated false positive signals with human Fc block is recommended: use 5 μL human Fc block for each 100 μL PBMCs.\nNote: To block more cells, increase the amount of human Fc block proportionally. Incubate cells at room temperature for 10 minutes.\nLabel 6 polystyrene tubes for each protein marker to be tested and add 100 μL PBMCs (0.5–1 million cells/tube) into all 6 tubes.",
    "Alternatives: A plate can also be used for cell staining instead of polystyrene tubes.\nAdd the corresponding antibodies to tube 3, 4, 5 and 6 for the first stain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1105-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Graphical illustration of co-staining cells with the same protein marker of fluorescent antibody and AOC\nSix tubes need to be prepared and stained with one or two antibodies to examine the possible signal change of the co-stained sample compared to the single stained samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1105_1.csv\naantibody quantity used for co-staining with the same clones; for different clones of the same protein marker, use the corresponding optimal amount per test.\nCritical: Because of the possible competition of the fluorescently labeled antibody with AOC, it is important to add the two antibodies at the same time into the cells for tube 6. Alternatively, cells can be added after adding antibodies to the tubes.\nNote: For tube 6, if the fluorescent antibody and the AOC are of the same clone, use an equivalent quantity of the two antibodies based on the optimal amount from the vendor’s recommendations. If the optimal amount is different, select one amount to be used for both antibodies (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] as an example of identification of optimal antibody amount to use). If the two antibodies are different clones, use the corresponding optimal amount provided by the antibody vendor, which can be different.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1105-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. An example of co-staining PBMCs with the same CD4 clone and conjugate utilized for surface detection and AOC",
    "PBMCs were co-stained with BUV395 CD4 (clone SK3) and CD4 AOC (clone SK3). Histograms of unstained, single stained, and co-stained samples were overlaid to compare the flow signal (left plot) and AOC signal (right plot). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was reduced by approximately half for both fluorescent CD4 surface expression and CD4 AOC signals. The optimal quantity is 0.125 μg for BUV395 CD4 and 0.06 μg for CD4 AOC. 0.125 μg of each antibody was added for co-staining to utilize equal amounts of the two antibodies. 7AAD was used for live/dead cell discrimination.\nPipet mix and incubate the mixture at the room temperature for 30 min.\nAlternatives: If staining murine cells or delicate human cells, incubation should be performed on ice.\nAdd 2 mL of stain buffer to tube 3, 4, 5 and 6 and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate or decant supernatant and gently blot the tube on a lint-free wipe to remove residual liquid from the rim of the tube.\nAdd 2 mL of stain buffer a second time and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend tube 3 in 350 μL stain buffer and store at 4°C until flow cytometry acquisition.\nResuspend tubes 4, 5 and 6 in 100 μL stain buffer.\nDilute 100 μM flow proxy oligos (AF647-dT and AF647-AbSeq PCR handle) using stain buffer to 3.75 μM.\nAdd 1 μL of each of 3.75 μM flow proxy oligos (2 μL in total) into tubes 2, 4, 5 and 6 containing 100 μL cells. Mix by pipetting 10 times.\nIncubate the cells at room temperature for 20 min, protected from light.\nAdd 2 mL of stain buffer to tubes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and resuspend by pipet-mixing.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min.",
    "Add 2 mL of stain buffer to each tube a second time and mix the solution.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend cell pellets in 350 μL stain buffer to prepare the 6 tubes for the next step.\nSamples can be analyzed using any flow cytometry analyzer with appropriate detectors. An example of co-staining PBMCs with CD4 AOC and CD4 fluorescent antibody is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nOptional: Add appropriate amount of live/dead marker to all tubes prior to flow cytometry analysis. Because fluorescent antibodies and flow proxy oligos may non-specifically bind with dead cells, we recommend including a live/dead dye to each tube to gate on live cells during flow cytometry analysis. For example, 7AAD or DAPI can be used.\nNote: Single-color control tubes need to be prepared for compensation calculation if there is spillover among fluorescent antibody, flow proxy dye and live/dead marker. If no live/dead marker is added, tube 3 and tube 5 can be used for single color compensation controls.\nCo-staining PBMCs with a fluorescent panel and an AOC panel\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis protocol describes the procedure of co-staining cells with AOCs and fluorescent antibodies. After staining, cell sorting can be performed directly to enrich cell populations of interest, followed by single-cell CITE-Seq workflow.\nObtain the optimal volume per test of all antibodies in both the sorting panel and the AOC panel based on vendor recommendations or flow proxy experiment for the shared protein marker. For example, the optimal volume of BUV395 CD4 (BD Catalog #: 563550) is 5 μL per 1 million cells. The optimal volume of BD® AbSeq AOC reagents is 2 μL for staining 1 million cells.",
    "Calculate the total volume of all antibodies to be used in the assay for both the sorting panel and the AOC panel.\nSubtract the total volume of the two panels from 200 μL to obtain the volume of stain buffer per sample. An example of calculation is in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1105_2.csv\nNote: Antibody cocktail volumes can be scaled up based on the number of samples or amount of cells\nOptional: when two or more BD Horizon™ Brilliant dyes are present in the sorting panel, Brilliant Stain Buffer (BSB) Plus should be used to mitigate dye to dye interaction and staining artifacts.\nNote: To stain more than 1 million cells, increase the antibody reagent volume proportionally.\nResuspend the PBMCs in the calculated volume of stain buffer in a 5 mL polystyrene tube.\nMake the fluorescent antibody cocktail and the AOC cocktail separately and place them on ice until cells are ready for staining.\nOptional: If multiple tubes of BD® AbSeq AOCs are used, tubes can be organized in a Latch Rack. Centrifuge the Latch Rack with a plate adaptor at 400 × g for 30 seconds. Open the tubes using an 8-Channel Screw Cap Tube Capper to make the AOC cocktail (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1105-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Latch rack for BD® AbSeq Ab-Oligo tubes and 8-channel screw cap tube capper\nBD® AbSeq tubes can be organized in the Latch Rack, as shown. The tubes can be opened and closed using the Screw Cap Tube Capper.\nBlocking non-specific binding of Fc receptors: add 5 μL of human Fc block per 1 million cells in suspension and incubate cells for 10 min at room temperature. Increase the volume of Fc block appropriately for increasing cell numbers.\nCombine the two cocktail mixtures and add PBMCs to the antibody cocktail mixtures.",
    "Optional: Pre-staining cells with the competing antibodies or the antibody that is particularly important for downstream characterization may be a good strategy to preserve the staining resolution. For example, researchers can add the same protein marker present in the AOC panel and the fluorescent panel, if there is any, to the cells first. After 10 minutes of incubation, the two remaining cocktail mixtures can be added.\nPipet to mix and incubate for 30–60 min at room temperature.\nAlternatives: If staining murine cells or delicate human cells, incubation should be performed on ice.\nAdd 2 mL stain buffer to the labeled cells and mix by pipetting.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate or decant supernatant and gently blot the tube on a lint-free wipe to remove residual liquid from the rim of the tube.\nRepeat the wash for an additional two times by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min in between.\nResuspend the cell pellet in Pre-Sort buffer for cell sorting.\nCritical: The co-stained cells can be kept at 4°C in the dark before FACS sorting. However, we highly recommend proceeding to cell sorting as quickly as possible to preserve the cell viability.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate cell population of interest\nTiming: Approximately 1 h\nCell sorting on co-stained cells can be performed using any type of cell sorter. A high level of procedure overview is provided below. Refer to the specific user guide of the instrument used.\nStart up the cytometer and the computer.\nPerform quality control of the cell sorter such as running Cytometer Setup and Tracking (CS&T) beads.\nPrepare the instrument for sorting following specific instrument user guidelines and biosafety regulations (Schmid and Dean, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nVisualization of the fluorescent sorting panel using co-stained cells.",
    "Run all the single-color controls and calculate the compensation.\nRun a small portion of the co-stained cells to visualize the fluorescent sorting panel and ensure proper staining.\nProceed to sorting the co-stained sample.\nCritical: To avoid potential transcriptional and proteomic changes and preserve cell viability, keep sorted cells on ice and proceed immediately to downstream single-cell capture (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSingle-cell capture using BD RhapsodyTM single-cell analysis system\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nA detailed protocol for single-cell capture using the nano-well based BD Rhapsody™ system is described in Erickson et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] or here.\nPause point: The Exonuclease-treated beads can be stored at 2°C–8°C for ≤ 3 months. During the library preparation process, there are multiple stopping points that allow researchers to break down the process into different days if needed."
