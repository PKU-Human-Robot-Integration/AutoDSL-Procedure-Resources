  "procedures": [
    "This preclinical study approved by the legal and ethical committee of the Regional Office for Health and Social Affairs, Berlin (LAGeSo). All animals (Ovis aries) received humane care in compliance with the guidelines of the European and German Laboratory Animal Science Societies (FELASA, GV-SOLAS). The procedure is illustrated by performing autologous pulmonary valve replacement in a 3-year-old, 47 kg, female sheep J.\n1. Preoperative management\nHouse all experimental sheep in the same room containing straw for 1 week from the day of arrival to the pericardiectomy day to maintain social companionship (Figure 1A).\nDeprive the sheep of food but not water for 12 h prior to the pericardiectomy and implantation.\nPre-medicate the sheep with an intramuscular injection of midazolam (0.4 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg), and glycopyrrolate (0.011 mg/kg or 200 mcg) 20 min before intubation.\n2. Induction of general anesthesia\nAseptically place an 18 G safety intravenous (IV) catheter, an injection port, and a T port in the cephalic vein (Figure 1B).\nInduce anesthesia by intravenous injection of propofol (20 mg/mL, 1–2.5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) to effect.\nIndications of an adequate level of sedation include jaw relaxation, loss of swallowing, and papillary reflex. After sedation, intubate the sheep with an appropriately sized endotracheal tube (Figure 1C). Shave the sheep and then transfer it to the operating room (OR).\n3. Intra-operative anesthesia management for pericardiectomy and implantation\nUse a pressure-cycled mechanical ventilator to initiate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with 100% oxygen in the OR.",
    "Connect the sheep to the anesthetic device platform and ventilate the sheep throughout the anesthesia under pressure mode (tidal volume (TV) = 8-12 mL/kg, respiratory frequency (RF) = 12-14 breaths/min). Adjust the TV and RF to keep the end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) between 35-45 mmHg and the arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) below 50 mmHg.\nMaintain anesthesia combined with isoflurane (to effect, suggested maintenance concentration 1.5%-2.5%) in oxygen with a flow rate of 1 L/min (inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) = 75%), combined with a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of fentanyl (5-15 mcg/kg/h) and midazolam (0.2-0.5 mg/kg/h).\nPlace an 18 G safety IV catheter in the auricular artery for the measurement of invasive blood pressure (IBP).\nConnect the sheep to the multi-function anesthesia platform for hemodynamic monitoring, which displays the direct measurement of invasive blood pressure (IBP) in the auricular artery (zeroed at the level of the heart), body temperature with a rectal probe, a lead-IV electrocardiogram, plethysmographic oxygen saturation (SpO2), TV, RF, EtCO2, heart rate (HR), and FiO2.\nPosition a gastric tube to evacuate excess gas and fluids from the reticulorumen in preparation for the pericardiectomy. Equip the gastric tube with a marker guide wire as a reference for the implantation.\nPlace a foley urinary catheter via the urethra inside the bladder connected to a urine bag. Distend the foley balloon with a minimum of 5 mL of saline solution (0.9% NaCl).\nCarry out an activated coagulation test (ACT: 240-300 s) 30 min before implantation to confirm sufficient heparinization before and antagonization after the implantation. Perform arterial blood gas analysis (ABGs) to analyze the internal environment 30 min prior to pericardiectomy and implantation and every hour during the two procedures.",
    "Administer the following antibiotics, namely, sulbactam/ampicillin (20mg/kg) 30 min via intravenous drip prior to pericardiectomy and implantation. Ensure a continuous infusion of crystalloids (5 mL/kg/h, isotonic balanced electrolyte solution) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES, 30 mL/h) throughout the pericardiectomy and implantation.\n4. Pericardiectomy\nPreparation for pericardiectomy\n\t\nPlace the sheep on the operating table in the right lateral recumbent position with 30° elevation on the left side, and then secure her limbs with harnesses and straps.\nSterilize the surgical site (pericardiectomy: superiorly to the left clavicle, anteriorly to the sternum, inferiorly to the level of the diaphragm, and posteriorly to the left midclavicular line) with chlorhexidine-alcohol before performing the minithoracotomy. Cover the remaining areas with sterile draping (Figure 2A).\nMake a 5 cm skin incision at the fourth intercostal parasternal position using a #10 surgical blade under general anesthesia.\nDissect the pectoralis major- pectoralis minor- anterior serratus-intercostal muscle via the left lateral minithoracotomy (m-LLT) into 5 cm incisions in length consecutively and separately in the third and fourth intercostal space for ideal exposure (Figure 2B).\nMake the incision at least 2 cm offset from the sternum to prevent injury to the left internal thoracic artery and veins. Cease the ventilator for 10 s to prevent lung injury before opening the thorax.\nUse several sterile gauzes to compress the left lung for better exposure of the surgical field after placing a rib spreader (Figure 2C). Visualize the pericardium and thymus in the surgical field (Figure 2D).\nStart the pericardiectomy at the attachment point of the pericardium and diaphragm and harvest the pericardial tissue between the two phrenic nerves, up to the innominate veins, down to the diaphragm.",
    "Compress the left lung as mentioned in step 4.1.5 to expose the attachment of the diaphragm-pericardium-mediastinal pleura. Cut open the left mediastinal pleura at the attachment of the diaphragm-pericardium-mediastinal pleura by making a 1 cm incision in length using a surgical scissor. Extend the incision upward into the innominate veins along the line which is 1 cm offset from the left phrenic nerve (Figure 2E).\nRepeat the procedure for the right part of the pericardium by elevating the apex to the left using fingers. Dissect the thymic and pericardial fat from the sternum.\nMeet the two incisions of the pericardium in front of the aorta. Cross clamp the intersection of pericardium and thymus from the two pericardial incisions in front of the aorta by holding them firmly in place and tying six surgical knots manually using a 4-0 non-resorbable suture.\nAvoid injury of the phrenic nerve and the underlying vascular structures, when harvesting the pericardium. Dissect adipose tissue including the thymus from the surface of the pericardium during pericardiectomy. Use a cautery tool (i.e., electrotome, Bovie) for hemostasis.\nPlace the harvested pericardium onto the sterile plate with a centimeter scale to remove the extra adipose tissue, and then wash it twice in 0.9% NaCl (Figure 2F). Double-check all the surgical areas for hemostasis.\nSuture the opened right mediastinal pleura to the residual right pericardial edge with 3-0 polydioxanone in a running fashion twice. Inflate the right lung to the largest volume manually using a breathing bag and hold for 10 s prior to closing the right thorax. Suture the opened left mediastinal pleura to the residual left pericardial edge with 3-0 polydioxanone in a running fashion twice.\nClose the left thoracic incisions in four layers as described below.",
    "Suture the intercostal muscles and anterior serratus with 2- 0 polydioxanone in a simple interrupted or cruciate fashion, pectoralis major-pectoralis minor with 3-0 polydioxanone in a running fashion, the subcutis with 3-0 polydioxanone in a cruciate fashion, and the skin with 3-0 nylon in a simple interrupted fashion. Place all the sutures at 1 cm intervals.\nInflate the left lung to the largest volume manually using a breathing balloon and hold for 10 s prior to closing the intercostal muscles.\nCover the incision with sterile gauze and compress it manually for 5 min to prevent hemorrhage after heparinization for the new heart valve implantation. Then bandage the surgical site.\nStop the intravenous anesthetics and isoflurane when performing the skin suture to reduce the depth of sedation.\nRemove the gastric tube and urinary catheter after the spontaneous respiration returns. Then transfer the sheep with pulse oximetry to the recovery room on the stretcher.\nRemove the endotracheal tube when the swallowing reflex, the papillary reflex, and normal spontaneous breathing recover. Administer 0.5 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously once a day before the implantation.\nOnce the anesthesia is completely reversed (i.e., when the sheep is able to stand independently), the sheep can be given access to food and water.\n5. Preparation of the three-dimensional autologous heart valve\nTrim the pericardium by removing the adipose tissue (Figure 3A,B,C), and then place it onto the 3D shaping heart valve mold. (Due to a pending patent application, figures cannot be provided in this step.)\nPut the pericardium and the 3D shaping heart valve model into an incubator with a non-toxic crosslinker (30 mL) for 2 days and 21 h (Figure 3D; due to the pending patent application, figures and detailed information of non-toxic crosslinker cannot be provided in this step).\n6. Preparation of the APV",
    "Wash the crosslinked heart valve in 0.9% NaCl twice and suture it into a Nitinol stent (30 mm in diameter, 29.4 mm in height, 48 rhombic cells) in a discontinuous fashion after 2 days and 21 h. Use 5-0 polypropylene to suture the heart valve in place using six to eight knots to align the attachment points between the heart valve and stent. (Due to a patent application, figures cannot be provided in this step.)\nCut the three free edges of the autologous pulmonary valve open with a no. 15 surgical blade (Figure 4A,B). Hold the stented pulmonary valve with a surgical tweezer, lift and leave the APV in 0.9% NaCl to test its opening and closing and to evaluate whether the three commissures need further cutting to achieve a larger opening of the orifice.\nIncubate the APV in an incubator for 30 min for sterilization in 47.6 mL of PBS with 0.8% amphotericin B (0.4 mL) and 4.0% penicillin/streptomycin (2 mL). Crimp the stented heart valve into the head of a delivery system (DS) using a commercial crimper for two-fold testing (Figure 4C-D) and fit it into the delivery system (Figure 4E).\n7. Transcatheter autologous pulmonary valve implantation via the left jugular vein\nAnesthetize the sheep for APV implantation as illustrated in steps 1 to 3.\nVessel access: Shave the sheep and sterilize the surgical field, which includes superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible, anteriorly to the anterior median line, inferiorly to the superior border of left clavicle, and posteriorly to the posterior median line using a povidone-iodine antiseptic before performing the implantation. Cover the remaining unshaved and unsterilized areas with sterile draping.",
    "Mark the left jugular vein on the neck and using the Seldinger technique place the guidewire into the left jugular vein. Enlarge the puncture point with a no. 10 blade, place a 11 F sheath into the left jugular vein for the ICE probe and delivery system (Figure 5A,B). Place a purse-string suture around the sheath introducer with a 4-0 non-absorbable suture.\nIntracardiac echocardiography (ICE)17\nPerform ICE before and immediately after the implantation using a 10 Fr ultrasound catheter (Figure 5C). Asses the parameters including the dimensions and functions of the NPV, APV, and tricuspid valve by 2D, color, pulsed wave, and continuous Doppler in the short and long axis.\nEvaluate the degree of valvular regurgitation in the vena contracta by semi-quantitative assessment18 via ICE (Figure 6).\nAngiography19: Perform angiography using a portable C-arm and a functional screen to guide the implantation by measuring the diameters of the RVOT, NPV, pulmonary bulb, and supravalvular pulmonary artery, as well as to evaluate the APV after implantation (Figure 7A-D).\nHemodynamics20: Measure and record the right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure before and after the implantation using a 5.2 F 145° pigtail catheter. Measure the systemic arterial pressure via the auricular artery.\nImplantation\n\t\nEstablishment of the TPVR tract: Place a 0.035-inch angled guidewire to the right pulmonary artery under the guidance of fluoroscopy. Then, place a 5.2 Fr pigtail catheter into the left jugular vein and advance it into the right pulmonary artery with the guidance of the previously placed guidewire under fluoroscopy.\nRetrieve the angled guidewire out of the left jugular vein. Place a 5 Fr Berman angiographic balloon catheter into the left jugular vein and advance it into the right pulmonary artery using the guidance of the guidewire.",
    "Pre-shape the 0.035-inch ultra-stiff guidewire into a circle of about 8-10 cm in length with a diameter equaling the distance from the central point of the tricuspid valve to the central point of the pulmonary valve according to the fluoroscopy measurement and advance it into the right pulmonary artery under the guidance of the balloon catheter (Figure 8A). Ensure the wire does not interfere with the tricuspid valve chordae.\nDilate the skin with a no. 11 blade and dilate the left jugular vein using commercial dilators from 16 Fr to 22 Fr sequentially (Figure 8B). Close the incision with a 3-0 polydioxanone purse-string suture after dilatation (Figure 8C). Perform angiography to ensure the desired position of the stent-bearing part of the DS as described in19.\nMark the sinotubular junction of the pulmonary valve at the end-systolic and end-diastolic cardiac phases during pulmonary angiography as the distal border of the landing zone and the basal plane of the pulmonary valve as the proximal border of the landing zone.\nReopen and inspect the stented autologous valve for crimping-induced damage. Re-crimp the APV and fit it into the head of the DS (Figure 8D). Advance the loaded DS via the pre-shaped guidewire through the right ventricular inflow tract (RVIT) and the RVOT to the NPV position (Figure 8E,F, and Figure 9A).\nRetract the cover tube of the DS and deploy the APV slowly and directly over the NPV in the landing zone at the end of the diastolic phase under fluoroscopic guidance (Figure 9A-C). Exercise caution when loaded DS is crossing the junction between the RVIT and the RVOT in order to prevent myocardial injury and ventricular fibrillation. The optimal position for the APV is when the middle part of the stent is placed onto the NPV.",
    "Retract the tip of the DS carefully into the cover tube after deployment and retrieve the DS from the sheep (Figure 9D). Repeat ICE (Figure 6D-F), angiography (Figure 7C-D), and hemodynamic measurements for post-examination of the dimensions and functions of the implanted APV. Close the incision on the left side of the neck with the pre-placed purse-string suture and compress it manually.\n8. Peri-implantation medication\nPrior to implantation, administer the sheep with heparin at a dose of 5000 IU to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of 240-300 s. Use ACT tests throughout the procedure. Repeat ACT tests every 30 min after the start of the procedure to confirm both sufficient heparinization before and antagonization after the implantation.\nBefore the APV implantation, administer 10% magnesium at a dose of 0.02 mol/L and amiodarone at a dose of 3-5 mg/kg to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.\nAdminister sulbactam/ampicillin (20 mg/kg) intravenously to prevent infection and endocarditis at the start of the pericardiectomy and implantation procedure.\n9. Postoperative management\nPerform a daily postoperative follow-up for 5 days, checking the general condition of the sheep in terms of heart rate and rhythm, breathing depth, breathing rhythm, and breath sound (for checking postoperative pneumonia), signs of pain, and other abnormalities. Check the wound for postoperative swelling, inflammation, redness, bleeding, and secretion.\nContinue anticoagulation for 5 days with dalteparin 5000 IU or another low-molecular-weight heparin administered subcutaneously once daily. Administer 1 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection for postoperative analgesia for 5 days.\nPerform a laboratory blood test, including hematology, liver function, renal function, and serum chemistry to evaluate the sheep's physical condition.\n10. Follow-up\nPerform ICE, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), angiography, and record hemodynamics every 3-6 months after implantation for up to 21 months. Perform ICE and angiography as illustrated above.",
    "Perform cMRI to evaluate the regurgitation fraction (RF) on a 3.0 T MRI scanner using a standard electrocardiogram-gated cine-MRI method21. Perform final cardiac computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the stent position and the deformation of the right heart throughout the entire cardiac cycle as illustrated in our previous study22.\nSubscription Required.
