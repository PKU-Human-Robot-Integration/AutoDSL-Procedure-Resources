    "The following protocol was approved by HEC Montréal's ethics committee prior to the beginning of the data collection.\n1. Participant screening for the experiment\nRecruit participants 18 years and older. Ensure that participants understand the language of the experiment, can stand for 20 min, possess a smartphone dating from a maximum of 5 years, do not have skin allergies or sensitivities, do not have a pacemaker and do not suffer from epilepsy or any other diagnosed health problem.\nRecruit groups of people that are friends, and other groups of people that do not know each other, in order to control for familiarity. Group sizes must be determined based on the purpose of the study, the game studied, and the size of the available room.\nSchedule participants. Impose a date and time for group of people knowing each other and group the people who do not know each other on their most convenient dates.\nAsk participants to charge their smartphones and bring chargers to the data collection session.\n2. Conditions and experimental design\nPrepare the randomization sheet for the interactivity condition by associating each participant number to the two conditions of interactivity for each game. Also assign numbers to players and to spectators who will wear an EDA box.\n3. Preparation\nNOTE: These materials are needed to perform the protocol: EDA box, the box used to record the EDA of the participant; light box, the box containing lighted digital numbers; and sync box, the box that sends signals to the EDA box and the light boxes to synchronize data. Two armbands, EDA electrodes, EDA sensors, medical tape, and antiseptic wipes are also needed.\nPlug the EDA boxes, the three light boxes, and the sync boxes into the charging station.",
    "Turn on the game in the studio (projector and 3D scanner for movement detection technology) and test the game by running it through a full game.\nPlace the consent forms, the pre-experiment questionnaire, and jerseys on a table in the greeting area.\nTest the Bluetooth connection of the light boxes. Set the sync box to manual.\n\t\nTurn on the three light boxes, the two EDA boxes, the Bluetooth on the EDA boxes, and the sync box.\nPush the pulse button on the sync box. The light boxes will flash the number 01.\nTurn off the sync box, the light boxes, and the EDA boxes.\nSet the sync box and light boxes in place for the collection. Place the light boxes in view of each camera.\n\t\nPut the sync box on the tripod, at a height of 6 feet.\nSet the sync box to auto.\nUnplug the batteries and put them into the cameras.\n\t\nCheck that battery power can record for over an hour.\nPlace the camera in order for the framing to include all four extremities of the game's paying field and the light box. Place the two low light cameras at opposite corners of the playing field at hip level and place the go pro mid-field on a higher tripod to have an overhead shot of the playing field.\nEnsure that framings include the full playing field and an area of 1 m around its limits, and the light box. Ensure that sync box is not further than 20 m from where participants will stand, otherwise the pulses will not be transmitted.\n4. Welcoming participants\nGreet the participants at the front door. Tell them to go sit at the table.",
    "Once all the participants have arrived and are seated, describe the tools which will be used to collect data for the present study. This description should be written in the consent form. Then, tell the two randomly chosen participants to follow the researcher to install the EDA equipment. During that time, other participants can start to fill the pre-experiment questionnaire.\nAsk the participants to read and sign the consent forms. Verbatim: \"I will ask you to read the consent form. The two copies are identical. One is for you; one is for me. Please answer all the questions and sign both copies.\"\nGo around the table to sign the consent form, verifying that all questions have been answered and put one copy of the consent form into a folder designated for this purpose and give the participant the second copy.\nAsk the participants to put on the jersey with their participant number.\n5. Installation of the physiological device\nAsk the participants to remove any jewelry from the non-dominant hand.\nUse an antiseptic wipe to clean the area where the electrodes will be placed. Remove the plastic from the electrode and place them on the hands of the participant.\nSnap the two sensors on the two electrodes. The red wire must be placed on the thumb's side. The black wire must be placed on the other side, under the pinky finger.\nPlug the sensor wire to the A3 port of the EDA box. Ask the participant if they tend to have sweaty palms. If they say that they do, wrap medical tape around the electrodes without touching the metal part.\nAdd an armband over the palm of the hand to secure the sensors and electrodes in place.\nTurn on the EDA device. Check that the Bluetooth switch is still on.",
    "Check that the four lights flash.\nNote the number of the participant and the number of the EDA box serial number associated to each participant.\nPlace the EDA box on the belt or in the pocket of the participant. If the participant's clothes do not allow this placement, offer them a belt, and hook the EDA to the belt.\nAsk the participants wearing the EDA boxes to return to the table with the others and complete the pre-experimental questionnaire.\n6. Record baseline\nGo around the table, starting with the participants who do not have the EDA, and check whether all the questions have been answered. If the questionnaire is completed, put it in the folder with the participant's consent form.\nOnce all participants have completed the pre-experimental questionnaire, walk them to the game studio.\nThen, record baseline.\n\t\nTo do so, tell the participants to calibrate the tools and ask them to breathe calmly and to fix something in front of their eyes for 2 min.\nSimultaneously, turn the EDA devices off and then on.\nStart a timer for 2 min. After the 2 min ends, turn the EDA device off and turn on again.\n7. Start the experiment\nStart the recording of the three cameras and turn on the three light boxes.\nVerify that the light boxes and the full playing field are still within the camera frame.\nVerify that the sync box is on auto and turn on the sync box.\nAfter 10 s, the numbers on the light boxes will flash.\n\tNOTE: This indicates that the sync box is automatically sending a pulse every 10 s to both the lights and the EDA boxes.",
    "Explain the game by informing that the game is like Ping-Pong and one will understand while playing. To win, one player needs to make 3 points. Some members of the public will use smartphones to influence the game by visiting the website URL that is projected on the playground.\nUsing the randomization sheet with the number of participants for each condition, tell the participants who will play the game, and who will be on the sidelines as spectators.\n\tNOTE: For the purpose of this study, the participants wearing the EDA boxes cannot be selected as playing participants because the spectator's engagement is being studied.\nTell the participants which spectators will be using their smartphone. Ask the spectators to influence the game. Tell the participants to stay within one meter of the playing field.\n8. Start the game\nTell the game technician to start the game by turning on the projectors and the movement detection technology.\nTell the players the scenario. Verbatim: \"Here is the context: you are walking in a public space and you see this game. You decide to participate.\"\nWhile the participants are playing, visually check whether the lights are flashing every 10 s.\nIn between each game, ask the spectators (not players) to fill in the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) Scale8 questionnaire on their smartphone on an URL. Give them the link of the questionnaire. When the first game is over, ask all the spectators, not players, to fill out a questionnaire on the smartphone about the experience. Ensure they answer three questions using three scales. Do not evaluate the game itself but rather the feeling during the participation.\n9. Removal of physiological devices",
    "Read this verbatim: \"Thank you very much for participating in the game. The last game is over. Spectators will now fill two paper questionnaires, players can leave. Please follow me to the greeting room.\"\n\t\nAsk all spectators, except the ones with the EDA, to go back to the table. They will answer the UES-SF two times, one time thinking about when they had the smartphone and one time when they didn't have the smartphone, this is written in the instructions of the questionnaire. Verbatim: \"The participants with the physiological tool, can wait at the table. The others, can fill out the end of experiment questionnaire, please answer extensively by explaining clearly what is meant.' They can ask questions if any.\nAsk the participant to return the EDA box; turn off the device and the Bluetooth of the device.\n\t\nUnplug the sensor from the A3 port, remove the armband, and unsnap the sensor from the electrodes.\nAsk the participant to remove the medical tape and electrodes on their hand. Give the participant a tissue to remove the cream from the hand.\nRemove the micro SD card from the EDA box and repeat steps 9.2. to 9.2.3 with the other EDA participants.\n10. Debrief the participants\nBring the EDA participants to the table where the other participants are sitting.\nAsk the participants to fill the end of experience questionnaire. Ask the participants to answer extensively by explaining clearly what they mean. Tell them to seek help of the experimenter in case they have questions.\nPlace the filled out post-experiment questionnaires with the pre-experiment questionnaires and consent forms in the folder.\nDebrief the participants. Once they finish, thank them for their participation, tell them about the compensation and walk them out.\n11. Cleaning up materials\nTurn off the three light boxes.",
    "Stop the recording of the three cameras and remove the batteries and SD cards from the three cameras. Place the camera batteries in the charger.\nTurn off the sync box and plug the EDA boxes, light boxes, and sync box into the charging station.\n12. Physiological data management\nPut the micro SD card from the EDA box in an adaptor. Transfer the data to the computer in a folder named by the number of the participant. Delete the files from the SD card.\nSelect all the data and put it in a spreadsheet. Hide the columns that are not useful. Select approximately line 1 to line 3,000 and make a scatter plot. If all the data is between 240 and 550, the data is valid.\nVerify that the markers generated by the sync box are present by selecting the event column and sorting it. Press control Z to revert the sorting of the markers.\n\tNOTE: All the markers that were generated will be visible. Sometimes there are markers that did not appear. This is not a problem, only one marker will provide a point of reference. From this point, the beginnings and ends of the events can be calculated using the time of the camera. There are 100 data points every second.\nAdd an event_start_end column. Watch the footage, when there is the beginning of an event, calculate the difference between the time of the event, and the last marker. When the seconds related to the event start are found, add a marker named event1_start in the spreadsheet file. Do the same for the end of the event.\nRepeat step 12.4 for the baseline.\nWhen all the markers are added, export the spreadsheet in .txt format (tab delimited text).",
    "NOTE: There will be two spreadsheets per participant, one with the experiment data and one with the baseline data.\nImport these files in the software that was developed for these EDA boxes (see the next section)19. This will generate a file ready for analysis that contains the relative time, absolute time, events, and EDA signal.\nUpload files to the EDA analysis software\nClick on Add Project. Add a title. Add a description. Enter the date of the project and the total number of participants.\nClick on the name of the project. Click on Experimental Design. Click on Signals and choose physiological, EDA, Bluebox recorder, Bluebox and version 3.0.\nClick on Events and enter the events as they were previously named in the spreadsheet (e.g., event_start_end). Choose Bluebox, version 3.0.\nClick on Transformations and choose GSR (galvanic skin response).\nClick on Unlocked to change to lock for locking the project. Click on File Import to import the files previously prepared.\nClick on the participant profile to give information about the participants by entering their email addresses. Click on Participant is There. Click on Ok Complete.\nUpload the data file which needs to be zipped in order for the software to recognize it. Click on the arrow. Click on the pies to upload the file.\nGo to Analysis and choose Data Exportation; select the participant and their data. Click on Export Data to create a file for statistical analysis. This can take hours if there are many participants. The file will appear under Filename at the end of the exportation.",
    "​NOTE: To obtain the file ready for analysis, the software generates clean phasic data. Signal preprocessing steps were executed as follows: data was recorded at 100 Hz and resampled to 25 Hz, before applying a low-pass 2nd order Butterworth filter and a 50 Hz cut-off. Signal was then decomposed in tonic and phasic components using the convex optimization algorithm described in Greco's article20. This algorithm filters for artifacts and outlier data points.\nUse the file generated for physiological data analysis.\n13. Analyze the data\nSubtract the EDA mean from the EDA value, then divide this value by its standard deviation (where the mean and standard deviations are based on the entire dataset)21 to standardize the EDA data.\nSubtract the mean of baseline EDA from each EDA standardized value, where the mean is based on the baseline data for each participant in question21 to baseline the EDA data.\nCalculate the means for each condition of interactivity for the SAM Scale and the post-experiment questionnaire (i.e., UES-SF).\nTest two mediation models, one for each type of arousal: physiological and self-reported.\nTest the relationship between the independent variable (interactivity) and the mediators (physiological and perceived arousal).\nTest the relationship between the independent (interactivity) and dependent variables (engagement assessed in the UES-SF).\nAssess the relationship between the combination of the independent variable and the mediators, and the dependent variable.\nSubscription Required.
