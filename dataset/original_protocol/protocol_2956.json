    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nBelow, we provide distinct protocols for achieving single-cell suspension from neural cultures of hiPSC-derived cells (Astrocyte Purification 1a), 3D cortical organoids (Astrocyte purification 1b), and human fetal brains (Astrocyte Purification 1c). We then introduce protocols for astrocyte-neuron co-cultures, astrocyte-conditioned media collection, and neurotoxicity assays.\nAstrocyte Purification 1a: Dissociation of hiPSC-Derived Mixed Cell Cultures in a Monolayer\nTiming: 45 min\nThis protocol is optimized to dissociate iPSC-astrocyte cultures generated with our previously described differentiation protocol (Douvaras and Fossati, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Barbar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We recommend digesting a full 6-well plate, with an expected yield of 300,000–600,000 CD49f+ astrocytes per plate, depending on the cell line and the batch of differentiation. Astrocytes can be isolated as early as day 64.\nNote: All steps should be performed under sterile conditions. After the sort, the CD49f- fraction can also be plated, which will be enriched for neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells.\nPre-warm Accutase at 37°C in a water bath.\nGently remove supernatant from the cells using a 10 mL pipette.\nCritical: Cells should never (or minimally) be exposed to air; therefore, we recommend leaving a thin layer of liquid.\nCritical: Do not touch the cell layer with the pipette, or the cells could detach.\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed Accutase per well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate for 25–30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 in incubator.\nNote: This extended incubation time is necessary because the cell layer is overly confluent at this stage, and it does not adversely affect significantly cell viability. Papain treatment can also be used as an alternative. Accutase can be directly added to the well, without performing a PBS wash.\nReturn the plate to tissue culture hood.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM/F-12 per well on top of Accutase (1:1 dilution).",
    "Triturate 8–10 times per well using a P1000 pipette set to 1,000 μL.\nPass the cell suspension containing Accutase and DMEM through a 70 μm cell strainer into 50 mL conical tube pre-filled with DMEM/F-12, such that final Accutase dilution is >7×.\nNote: Cells from the same iPSC line, but from different wells, are combined into one tube.\nTransfer the cell solution from a 50 mL conical tube to 15 mL conical tubes for spinning.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 4 min at 22°C–25°C.\nContinue to “Astrocyte Purification 2: Preparing Cells for FACS” (step 34).\nAstrocyte Purification 1b: Dissociation of hiPSC-Derived 3D Organoids\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, hiPSC-derived organoids are dissociated into single cells for FACS using an enzymatic digestion kit. Organoids were generated using a previously established protocol that generates cortical neurons, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and astrocytes; astrocytes arise no earlier than d75 (Madhavan et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: These organoids are patterned toward cortical development, whereas the previous monolayer protocol(Douvaras and Fossati, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) uses ventralizing and caudalizing agents (SA and RA respectively) to generate spinal cord astrocytes.\nNote: This protocol is based on instructions provided with the Worthington Papain Dissociation kit (http://www.worthington-biochem.com/pds/default.html[href=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/pds/default.html]) and optimizations from a previous protocol (Velasco et al., 2019a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], 2019b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nGently transfer 3–4 organoids to an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate using a wide-bore 1,000 μL pipette tip. Aspirate any excess media, leaving just enough to not let the organoids dry.\nUsing a clean disposable scalpel, cut the organoids into small pieces (<0.5 mm).\nImmediately add 1 mL of prepared Papain + Dnase solution to the organoids. Pipette 3 times.\nTransfer the plate to an orbital shaker set at a speed of 70 rpm inside an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Incubate for 30 min.",
    "Using a P1000, gently dissociate the organoids further to break them apart into even smaller pieces. Triturate 10 times very gently.\nReturn the plate to the orbital shaker and incubate for another 10 min.\nDuring this time, prepare the inhibitor solution by adding 2 mL of Earle’s medium and 1.2 mL of reconstituted Inhibitor solution to a 15 mL conical tube (prepare one tube per organoid sample).\nUsing a P1000, gently break apart the digested organoid sample further by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the 15 mL conical tube with the prepared inhibitor solution, close the tube tightly, and mix the contents by inverting it a few times.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 4 min at 22°C–25°C.\nContinue to “Astrocyte Purification 2: Preparing Cells for FACS” (step 34).\nAstrocyte Purification 1c: Dissociation of Fetal Human Brain Tissue\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, fetal human brain tissue is dissociated into single cells in preparation for FACS, using the CD49f antibody.\nNote: This protocol is based on instructions provided with the Worthington Papain Dissociation kit and optimizations from a previous protocol (Velasco et al., 2019a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Velasco et al., 2019b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nGently transfer fetal brain chunks (a total of around 0.5 cm2) to a Petri dish, using sterile forceps or a wide-bore 1,000 μL pipette tip. Aspirate any excess media, leaving just enough to not let the brain tissue dry.\nUsing a sterile disposable scalpel, cut the brain chunks into smaller pieces (<1 mm), and immediately add 2.5 mL of prepared Papain + Dnase solution to the fetal brain tissue. Pipette 3 times.\nTransfer the dish to an orbital shaker set at a speed of 70 rpm inside an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Incubate for 30 min.",
    "Using a P1000, gently dissociate the tissue further to break it apart into even smaller pieces. Triturate 10 times very gently.\nReturn the dish to the orbital shaker and incubate for another 10 min. During this time, prepare the inhibitor solution by adding 5 mL of Earle’s medium and 3 mL of reconstituted Inhibitor solution to a 15 mL conical tube.\nUsing a P1000, gently break apart the digested fetal brain sample further by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the 15 mL conical tube with the prepared inhibitor solution, close the tube tightly, and mix the contents by inverting it a few times.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 4 min at 22°C–25°C.\nResuspend in 1 mL sterile ddH2O for 30 s for red blood cell lysis, then immediately add 10 mL of PBS and mix.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 300 × g for 4 min at 22°C–25°C.\nContinue to “Astrocyte Purification 2: Preparing Cells for FACS” (step 34).\nNote: Other methods of red blood cell lysis may be used.\nNote: CD31 can be used in combination with CD49f to exclude CD31+/CD49f+ endothelial cells and isolate CD31−/CD49f+ astrocytes from primary samples.\nAstrocyte Purification 2: Preparing Cells for FACS\nTiming: 40 min\nIn this step, cells are stained for PE-conjugated CD49f and appropriate control samples are prepared, prior to FACS.\nRetrieve the tubes from the centrifuge and aspirate supernatant, making sure not to disturb the pellet and leaving a minimal amount of liquid.",
    "Using a standard 20 μL pipette, transfer 2 μL of pellet to a 15 mL conical tube containing 200 μL FACS buffer (for unstained control), and 2 μL of pellet to a 15 mL conical tube containing 200 μL FACS buffer with 1× Propidium Iodide PI solution (for PI-only control) and place control tubes on ice.\nResuspend remaining pellet (sample) in 200 μL FACS buffer with 1:50 PE Rat Anti-Human CD49f antibody and mix by gently pipetting up and down.\nNote: 200 μL of FACS buffer with 1:50 PE Rat Anti-Human CD49f is the volume recommended for cells derived from one full 6-well plate.\nIncubate for 20 min on ice.\nAdd 2 mL of FACS buffer per sample of CD49f-stained cells and spin at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nAspirate supernatant.\nTransfer 2 μL of CD49f-PE-stained cell pellet to a 15 mL conical tube containing 200 μL FACS buffer (for CD49f-only control) and place control tube on ice.\nResuspend remaining pellet (total sample) in 200 μL FACS buffer with 1× PI solution and place on ice.\nAstrocyte Purification 3: Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting\nTiming: 30–45 min per 6-well plate\nThis section covers sorting the astrocytes using a cell sorter, such as BD FACS-Aria, but any alternative sorter can be used. A 100-μm nozzle with a sheath pressure of 23 psi is recommended for cultured cells, and a 130-μm nozzle for fetal samples.\nDepending on the quality of the dissociation and the viability and stickiness of the samples, a 130-μm nozzle with a sheath pressure of 10 psi may minimize clogging.\nGating strategy and representative plots for hiPSC-derived mixed cell cultures in a monolayer, 3D organoids, and fetal brain are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/270-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(B) Human iPSC-derived CD49f+ astrocytes can be stimulated in vitro with TNFα, IL-1α, C1q to become A1 reactive astrocytes that show a drastic change in their morphology 24 h after stimulation, as highlighted in the cropped images. Scale bars, 100 μm.\nTiming: 15 min\nSpin cells at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nAspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cells in PDGF medium at desired concentration for plating.\nAspirate laminin from PO/lam-coated plates.\nPlate cells in PDGF medium into well(s), at a density of ∼15,000–75,000 cells per cm2 (based on the counts from the sort), depending on desired confluence.\nNote: Lower confluence (∼15,000–30,000 cells per cm2) could be best for lower density imaging or imaging-based phagocytosis assays, while higher confluence (∼50,000–75,000 cells per cm2) is recommended for collecting supernatant for colorimetric or fluorometric assays such as the glutamate uptake assay. Cells can also be initially plated at low density and allowed to expand to the optimal confluence for the specific downstream analysis planned.\nNote: Adding ROCK Inhibitor at this stage does not appear to improve cell viability.\nPlace plate(s) in incubator and shake up-down and right-left, ensuring that cells are evenly distributed across each well.\nThe following day, check that cells are viable and that they attached to the plate. Gently, and without disturbing the cells, pipette out half the media per well and add the same volume of glial media.\nRepeat step (54) every other day to feed cells until performing desired assay.\nNote: CD49f+ astrocytes are proliferating and will expand over the following days. We do not recommend passaging at this stage, as the viability is reduced.\nNote: CD49f+ astrocytes can be frozen in serum-free freezing media such as Synth-a-Freeze, but the viability is only ∼50%, and a thorough characterization of freeze-thawed cells has not been performed.",
    "Proceed to “Astrocytes Conditioned Media Collection” and “Neurotoxicity Assay.”\nNeuronal Differentiation\nTiming: 30+ days\nCD49f+ astrocytes can be co-cultured with hiPSC-derived neurons to support their maturation. Alternatively, neurons can be generated to assess toxicity of A1 reactive astrocyte-conditioned medium. Here we provide a protocol to generate cortical neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), based on modifications from previously published protocols (Maroof et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Qi et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). This protocol generates mixed subtypes of cortical neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and can be adapted to smaller or larger scales by using alternative plate formats and adjusting the number of initial iPSCs to be seeded and the volume per well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/270-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. iPSC Differentiation to Cortical Neurons\n(A) Schematic of the differentiation protocol, depicting major steps and differentiating agents.\n(B) Immunofluorescent characterization of iPSC-derived neurons at the end of the differentiation protocol, showing that the culture is a mix of GABAergic neurons (GABA+) and glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1+). Merge of MAP2 dendritic marker, VGLUT1, and GABA staining is also shown. MAP2 and Hoechst merge highlights the presence of dead cells, that stick to the coated plate and cannot be easily removed but are clearly identified as pyknotic nuclei (yellow arrows). Scale bar, 20 μm.\nNote: We typically maintain iPSC cultures with mTeSR1 medium, on Geltrex coating, but alternative pluripotent media/matrices can be used to maintain iPSC culture in pluripotency.\nPlate 100,000 hiPSCs/well in a 12-well plate previously coated with 0.15 mg/mL Geltrex (1:100 of stock) for 1 h at 37°C and add 1 mL of hiPSC maintenance medium (e.g., mTeSR1) with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.\nCritical: Adding ROCK inhibitor is critical for improving iPSC viability.\nThe following day (d0), gently aspirate medium and immediately add 2 mL/well of neuronal induction d0-d9 medium.",
    "Note: Colonies are ready for induction when they are well defined and 40% confluent, and this normally occurs 24 h after plating at the density described above in 56.\nRepeat step (57) every day until d10.\nOn d10, aspirate medium using a vacuum aspirator and immediately add 2 mL/well of neuronal induction d10-d14 medium.\nRepeat step (59) every day until d15.\nOn d15, dissociate cells to a single-cell suspension.\nAspirate supernatant from the cells.\nCritical: When aspirating media, it is important to minimize cell exposure to air and therefore it is recommended to leave a thin layer of medium.\nAdd 500 μL of Accutase per well of a 12-well plate.\nIncubate for 10–15 min at 37°C in incubator.\nAfter the incubation step, return the plate to tissue culture hood and gently triturate 8–10 times per well using a P1000 pipette set to 500 μL.\nTransfer Accutase cell solution into 15 mL conical tube pre-filled with DMEM/F-12 such that the final Accutase dilution is >7×.\nSpin at 300 × g for 5 min.\nPause Point: Cells can be frozen, by resuspending the pellet in Synth-a-Freeze or any alternative freezing solution recommended for iPSCs or neurons. Pooling every two wells of a 12-well plate into one cryovial is recommended. This will yield ∼5–8 million live cells per vial at thaw (expected viability using Synth-a-Freeze is around 50%).\nNote: From each well of a 12-well plate, 5–8 million live cells are generally obtained when passaging.\nFor plating cells, resuspend cells in neuronal basal medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor and mix by gently pipetting up and down 6 times.\nCritical: Adding ROCK inhibitor is critical for improving viability of neural progenitors.\nAspirate laminin from PEI/lam-coated plates.",
    "Plate cells in neuronal medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor into well(s), at a density of 1.56 x 105/cm2.\nNote: we recommend the 96-well plate (96wp) format for most downstream assays, particularly for neurotoxicity assay. Plate 50,000 cells/well of 96wp, in a total volume of 200 μL per well.\nPlace plate(s) in incubator and shake up-down and right-left, ensuring that cells are evenly distributed across each well.\nThe next day, check that cells have attached and gently remove all media using a pipette. Minimize the time cells are exposed to air. Quickly add neuronal maturation medium (200 μL per well for a 96wp format), making sure not to disturb the cells, by touching the walls instead of the bottom of the well with the pipette tip.\nFeed cells every other day by gently pipetting out half of the culture media per well and carefully adding back the same volume of neuronal maturation medium.\nOn d28, pipette out half the culture media per well and add back the same volume of neuronal maintenance medium.\nFeed cells every other day from this point on as described in (64).\nNote: iPSC-derived neurons can be used for co-culture experiments (66) or for neurotoxicity experiments (78).\nNote: Past d28, neurons can be kept in culture, feeding every other day.\nCritical: Pipette in and out very gently when changing media to prevent cells from detaching.\nAstrocyte-Neuron Co-culture\nTiming: 20 days\nThis section describes astrocyte-neuron co-cultures to study the effect of astrocytes on neurons in terms of neuronal maturation and/or morphology.\nOn d33 of the neuronal differentiation, gently pipette out half of the culture medium per well, as described previously.",
    "After performing the CD49f+ astrocyte sort as described above, resuspend CD49f+ astrocytes in PDGF medium and plate them on top of the neurons at a density of 47 k/cm2, such that half the volume consists of neuronal maintenance medium, and the other half of PDGF medium.\nThe following day, pipette out half the culture medium per well and add back the same volume of neuronal medium, with or without TNFα (60 ng/mL), IL-1α (6 ng/mL), and C1q (800 ng/mL), such that the final cytokine concentration in each well is 30 ng/mL for TNFα, 3 ng/mL for IL-1α, and 400 ng/mL for C1q.\nFeed cells twice per week until d53:\nPipette out half of the culture medium per well.\nAdd back the same volume of neuronal medium, with or without TNFα (30 ng/mL), IL-1α (3 ng/mL), and C1q (400 ng/mL).\nPerform your desired endpoint experiments (e.g., immunofluorescence, electrophysiology, etc.).\nNote: If planning electrophysiology experiments, plate neurons on d15 on PEI/lam-coated acid-washed coverslips.\nNote: Some cell death usually occurs during the differentiation, and dead cells tend to stick to the coated plates. They will be visible when imaging the plates as pyknotic nuclei (DAPI or Hoechst stained, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). We do not recommend washing them out, as this could result in lifting of live cells as well.\nAstrocyte-Conditioned Medium Collection\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section continues from the section “Astrocyte Purification 4: Plating Cells Post Sort” and describes how to collect astrocyte-conditioned medium from unstimulated (A0) and A1-stimulated reactive astrocytes. Conditioned media can be used subsequently for the Neurotoxicity assay (78).\nDirectly after sorting, plate CD49f+-sorted astrocytes onto PO/lam-coated 24-well plates at 200,000/well, in PDGF medium (500 μL/well).",
    "The following day remove half of the medium per well (250 μL) and add the same volume of BrainPhys medium with 1× PenStrep and 1× B27 supplement with Vitamin A per well.\nFeed cells every other day as described in (72).\nAt day 8 post-plating, pipette out all the media per well and immediately gently add 600 μL per well of BrainPhys with 1× PenStrep and 1× B27 supplement minus antioxidants, with or without TNFα (30 ng/mL), IL-1α (3 ng/mL), and C1q (400 ng/mL).\nReturn plate to incubator and incubate for 48 h.\nReturn plate to tissue culture hood and transfer supernatant (conditioned media) from each well to a different Eppendorf tube using a P1000 pipette set to 500 μL.\nProceed with the following step right away. We recommend using fresh conditioned media as opposed to frozen or stored conditioned media.\nNeurotoxicity Assay\nTiming: 45 min\nIn this step, we describe the neurotoxicity assays, performed by exposing neurons to astrocyte-conditioned medium and assessing apoptotic cells via caspase staining over 3 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/270-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Neurotoxicity Assay\n(A) Representative fields of neurons undergoing live imaging analysis using IncuCyte, at the beginning (0 h) and after 72 h. Phase images highlight neuronal morphology, green channel shows caspase 3/7+ apoptotic cells and red channel shows all nuclei. Note the presence of yellow apoptotic nuclei primarily in neurons exposed to A1 astrocyte-conditioned medium. Scale bar, 200 μm.\n(B) Quantification of caspase 3/7+ cells shows significant increase in apoptosis when neurons are exposed to A1 astrocyte-conditioned medium, compared to A0 astrocyte-conditioned medium, control medium (neurons untreated) and IL-1α, TNFα, C1q. This quantification is based on the data presented in Figure 7 (Astrocytes.3) of the original study (Barbar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPrepare fresh “IncuCyte medium”:",
    "Prepare BrainPhys, 1× PenStrep (1:100 dilution), and 1× B27 supplement minus antioxidants (1:100 dilution).\nNote: Total volume prepared depends on the amount of conditioned media collected (250 μL of IncuCyte medium needed for each 500 μL of conditioned media collected).\nAdd 15 μM IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 Green Apoptosis Assay Reagent (1:333 dilution) and IncuCyte NucLight Rapid Red Reagent (1:667 dilution) for nuclear labeling to fresh media prepared in 78a.\nPipette up and down 8–10 times to mix.\nAdd 250 μL of IncuCyte medium to each 500 μL of conditioned media collected (final dilution of IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 Green Apoptosis Assay Reagent and IncuCyte NucLight Rapid Red Reagent will be 1:1,000 and 1:2,000, respectively).\nMix by pipetting up and down.\nBring 96wp of d66 neurons grown as described above to culture hood.\nNote: This could also be performed on mature neuronal cultures at a different day of the differentiation.\nGently remove all media from each well using a pipette and immediately gently add 120 μL of media per well.\nPlace plate in the IncuCyte live cell imager (in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2), and image every 6 h for 72 h in the phase, green, and red channels.\nNote: The IncuCyte system is ideal for automated acquisition and analysis of live cells over time, however, apoptosis assays can be performed with any other microscope with temperature and CO2 control or any other traditional system available in the lab.\nOptional: In parallel on the same plate, image wells without the IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 Green Apoptosis Assay Reagent and the IncuCyte NucLight Rapid Red Reagent to correct to background autofluorescence."
