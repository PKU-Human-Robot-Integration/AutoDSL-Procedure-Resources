    "iPSC cell culture is also described in detail in D’Antonio-Chronowska et al. (2019a)Thaw iPSC cellsPrepare 12 ml of mTeSR containing 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor.Transfer 9 ml of mTeSR containing 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor into a sterile conical tube labeled with the name of the line.Remove vial of cryopreserved cells from liquid nitrogen tank. Keep vial on dry ice.Place and shake gently in a 37 °C water bath until a pea-sized ice crystal remains (around 2 min).Wipe off excess water from the vial, spray with 70% ethanol before placing in the hood.Remove thawed cells from the vial and add gently into 9 ml mTeSR containing 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor in a conical tube. Wash the vial with 1-2 ml of mTeSR containing 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor. Collect all cells in the same conical tube.Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 53 x g (500 RPM in a Sorvall 75006445 rotor with 75006441 K buckets) at room temperature.Aspirate supernatant, and gently resuspend cell pellet in 2 ml of mTeSR containing 10 μM ROCK Inhibitor (1 cryovial is thawed into 1 well of 6-well plate).Note: The iPSC cells are cryopreserved in clumps and cannot be counted. Therefore, we recommend to cryopreserve cells from 1 well of a 6-well plate into 1 cryovial, and then to thaw cells from one cryovial onto 1 well of a 6-well plate. Label a Matrigel plate with name of line, clone and passage number. Aspirate DMEM/F-12 from Matrigel-coated plate. Add +1 to the passage number after thawing.Note: Do not add +1 to the passage number if the passage number was increased during cryopreservation of iPSCs. Plate cells resuspended in 2 ml into one well of a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (final volume 2 ml/well).24 h after plating, observe cells.",
    "Wash cells gently with DMEM/F-12 (2 ml/well) to remove cell debris and feed using fresh mTeSR medium without ROCK Inhibitor (2 ml/well). Daily, observe the iPSCs, remove the differentiated cells, and change the medium with fresh mTeSR (2 ml/well).Note: It is critical to maintain iPSC culture differentiation free. For details on how to mark and remove differentiated iPSC cells, please refer below to procedure: 2. iPSC passaging using Dispase (Steps A2c-A2d) and Figure 1. Cells should reach 80-90% of confluency and be ready for passage in about 5 days.iPSCs can be passaged using multiple methods, depending on the needs. For routine iPSC culture and expansion, cells should be passaged using Dispase, which cleaves the proteins of extracellular matrix used for iPSC culture (Matrigel). Dispase will dissociate iPSCs into clumps of cells, which is a gentle method of iPSC expansion and maintenance. We recommend passaging iPSC with Dispase at the ratio 1:2 (one well split onto 2 wells) or 1:3 (one well split onto 3 wells), which allows to easily schedule iPSC cell maintenance. Cells passaged with Dispase should reach about 80% confluency in about 4-5 days. Other ratios also can be used (i.e., 1:1 or 1:4), however we recommend testing it for individual lines.  When iPSC cells have to be expanded at much higher ratios or using a defined cell number, iPSC should be dissociated as single cells using Versene or Accutase. Please note that single cell passage is very stressful for iPSCs and leads to cell apoptosis. To prevent dissociation-induced apoptosis of iPSC, reagents like ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 dihydrochloride (or others) have to be used. We do not recommend dissociating iPSCs into single cells for routine expansion or prior to cryopreservation.",
    "Versene is a non-enzymatic, gentle method of single cell dissociation which acts by chelating metal ions (mainly magnesium and calcium) required by integrins to maintain cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contacts. We have routinely expanded over 150 different iPSC lines with Versene prior to plating large-scale monolayers, however we do not recommend dissociating cells using Versene in more than two consecutive passages. Accutase is an enzymatic reagent that allows for very efficient single cell dissociation. Although Accutase is a gentle reagent, commonly used for iPSC, we recommend using Accutase only for monolayer plating.Notes:It is critical for a successful iPSC-CVPCs differentiation to use heathy and pluripotent iPSC cells and use iPSC which were culture was maintained free of differentiation.Optimal cell number will vary depending on the scale of differentiation. Differentiation at the scale described in this protocol requires that cells are expanded gradually, by performing two Versene passages (Passages: Versene I and Versene II).iPSC passaging using DispasePrepare 1x (2 mg/ml) Dispase solution by adding 9 ml DMEM/F-12 to 1 ml of 10x Dispase (20 mg/ml).Allow 1x Dispase solution to come to room temperature.Note: 1x Dispase solution can be stored at 4 °C for maximum 2 weeks.Mark any areas of differentiation in the well(s) to be split, using the Microscope Object marker refer to Figure 1 for representative image of healthy pluripotent colonies (A) and differentiated colonies which need to be removed (B).Aspirate spent media. Aspirate marked areas of differentiation, if any, by gently tapping a Pasteur pipette within the marked circle (Figure 1C). Wash with 2 ml of DMEM/F-12 per well.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200915/20200915080146_0720.pngFigure 1. Pluripotent and differentiated iPSC colonies. A. Healthy and pluripotent iPSC colonies fuse into larger colonies: before fusion (left and middle) and after fusion (right).",
    "Healthy and pluripotent iPSC colonies have a smooth, flat, colony surface, are very compact with tightly growing cells that have almost invisible cell membranes (borders between cells), and uniform, well defined, colony edges. Cells have high nucleus:cytoplasm ratios with clearly visible nucleoli. Almost any deviation from this morphology may suggest loss of pluripotency and may indicate unwanted differentiation. B. Examples of differentiated iPSC cell which need to be removed from the culture. Black arrows indicate differentiated cells. Cells of various iPSC lines may have diverse morphology upon differentiation and these are only a few representative examples. C. Differentiated colony has been marked in purple dye using Microscope Object marker (left) and aspirated with a Pasteur pipette (right).Add 1 ml of 1x Dispase in each well to be split. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.Check morphology of colonies after 5 min.When edges of the colonies are slightly curled up, cells are ready to be passaged. If edges of colonies are not curled up, incubate cells at 37 °C for another 1-2 min. Do not incubate with Dispase for longer than 8 min. Refer to Figure 2A for representative image of colonies with edges curled up.Aspirate Dispase from all wells.Note: iPSC colonies passaged with Dispase will remain fully attached to the well. Only the edges of the colonies will be slightly curled up indicating that cells are ready for the next steps. Rinse the wells gently 3 times with DMEM/F12 (2 ml/well).Add 1 ml of mTeSR media to each well to be passaged.Use a glass serological pipette to detach colonies. Hold the pipette at a 90° angle to the surface of the plate.",
    "Scrape across the surface of the 6-well plate in the motion outlined in Figure 2B (start from top left side of the well and zig-zag tightly down to bottom-right side, then turn plate clockwise or counterclockwise and scrape again). Scrape until at least 90% of the colonies are detached from the well.Wash plate with the volume of mTeSR required to bring cells up to the final volume needed to seed a new Matrigel-coated vessel. Calculate the final volume considering 2 ml per each well to be seeded with passaged cells. For example, if cells are to be passaged 1 to 3 the final volume will be 6 ml, therefore the volume of mTeSR used to wash the plate is 5 ml.Seed cells on a new Matrigel plate plating 1 ml of cell suspension per well and then add 1 more ml of cell suspension to each well (Figure 2C). Plate cells dropwise across the entire surface of the well to ensure uniform plating.Observe seeded cells under microscope to ensure even plating.Place in a 37 °C incubator. Shake the plate in T-shape to homogenously distribute the colonies pieces in the well.Twenty-four hours after plating gently, wash cells with DMEM/F-12 before adding fresh mTeSR medium.Note: For a healthy and efficient iPSC culture, it is critical to plate cells uniformly. Plate cells uniformly across the entire surface of the well and, when plating multiple wells plate cells uniformly across all wells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200915/20200915080213_4489.pngFigure 2.

    "About 90% cells should be detached from the well. C. Example of plating cells when passaging iPSC cells from 2 wells onto 6 wells. Add 1 ml of cell suspension into each well following a pattern: when plating cells onto three wells: 1-2-3-3-2-1 or when plating cells onto six wells: 1-2-3-4-5-6-6-5-4-3-2-1. Please refer to the section on iPSC passaging using Dispase for details. (Described also in detail in D’Antonio-Chronowska et al., 2019a)Passaging iPSC using Versene (Versene I)Notes:After thawing an iPSC line, passage cells with Dispase at least once before passaging cells with Versene.Optimal cell number will vary depending on the scale of iPSC-CVPC differentiation. Differentiation at the scale described in this protocol requires cells from 1-2 wells for Versene I passage.Remove 6-well plates from the incubator. When iPSC cells are at around 80% confluency (cells are ready for a passage), iPSC cells are ready for Versene I passage. Mark all differentiated cells, which need to be removed (Figure 1).Aspirate the spent medium. Remove all marked differentiated cells and wash cells with DMEM/F-12 (2 ml/well).Aspirate DMEM/F-12 and add 1 ml of room temperature Versene® (EDTA) 0.02% to well of a 6-well plate. Incubate cell for 5 min at 37 °C.After 5 min of incubation check cells under microscope to ensure the cells are ready–individual cell borders should be visible. (If the cells are not ready, return cells to incubator and allow cells to act for another 30 s-1 min. Do not allow Versene incubation exceed total of 8 min.Gently aspirate the Versene from each well. DO NOT wash cells with DMEM/F12.Note: Individual cells incubated with Versene will be clearly visible. Cells will remain attached to the surface of the well however the plate should be handled gently.",

    "Incubate the cells until next morning, at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Next day change medium for fresh mTeSR without ROCK inhibitor (10 ml/100 mm dish). iPSC after Versene II passaged requires culturing cells for about 3-4 days until the culture reaches 80% confluency. Change medium daily with fresh mTeSR. Maintain differentiation-free iPSC culture.Monolayer platingThe day before plating monolayer mark 10 spots (views) at the bottom of each of the three T150 flasks using a marker resistant to 70% ethanol (Figure 3A). Coat three T150 flasks with Matrigel (20ml per flask). Place flasks in the incubator.Prepare 140-150 ml of mTeSR medium containing 5 μM ROCK inhibitor.Add 25 ml mTeSR medium containing 5 μM ROCK inhibitor to each of three T150 flasks coated overnight with matrigel.

    "Next day change medium for fresh mTeSR without ROCK inhibitor (35 ml/T150 flask). Monolayer for iPSC-CVPCs cell differentiation requires culturing cells for about 4-5 days until the monolayer reaches 80% confluency. Change medium with fresh mTeSR daily.Estimation of monolayer confluency and optimal time for initiation of iPSC-CVPCs differentiation using ccEstimateVariable growth rates across different iPSC lines results in them reaching optimal confluency at the monolayer stage at different time points (i.e., faster growing lines will obtain the optimal confluency earlier) and hence impact differentiation outcome. To enable the differentiation of large number of different iPSC lines we developed cell confluency Estimates (ccEstimate), an automatic pipeline, that analyzes images of monolayer-grown cells, determines their confluency at various timepoints and predicts when the cells will reach 80% confluency. We also used ccEstimate after the initiation of differentiation, i.e., after addition of CHIR99021, to measure the actual cell confluency in an unbiased, i.e. operator independent, way.    ccEstimates are performed by first dividing each T150 flask into 10 sections (Figure 3) and acquiring images for each section every 24 h after cells are plated as a monolayer. The final images are acquired immediately after treatment with CHIR99021, which occurs when confluency is at 80% (Day 0). The time required for cells to reach 80% confluency is estimated on the basis of the confluency curve derived for each section in each flask. To digitally measure iPSC confluency, ccEstimate performs image analysis using the EBImage package in R (Pau et al., 2010). Images are read using the readImage function. As lighting may be different between the center and the border of an image, only the central part of the image is retained. To separate cells from the background and calculate confluency (i.e.",
    ", the fraction of the surface of the flask that is covered by cells) the following operations are performed. Confluency measurement data is collected for at least the first three days after plating as monolayer to train a generalized linear model (GLM) using the function glm in R to estimate when cells must be treated with CHIR99021. Estimation is performed separately for each flask section and CHIR is added to all three flasks associated to a given line when at least 75% of sections have 80% confluency (Figure 3).    Using ccEstimate, allows one to start differentiation at the same confluency level for each iPSC line, thereby reducing or neutralizing the effects of different growth rates. Based on our data, on average, each line required 4.23 ± 1.12 days after plating a monolayer to reach 80% confluency. The correlation between the number of days required to reach 80% confluency and the %CM population was -0.05, suggesting that iPSC growth rate does not affect differentiation outcome (D'Antonio-Chronowska et al., 2019b).Mark the spots (views) at the bottom of the vessel. In case of using T150 flask mark 10 spots as indicated in Figure 3A.Take images of the cells starting from 24 h after plating monolayer. Provide the following nomenclature to the file: UDID_NNN_SUBJECT_CLONE_PASSAGE_MONO_DAY_FLASK_VIEW_DATE_Example: UDID_001_iPSCORE-2-3_C5_P22_MONO_D1_FL1_VIEW1_20150723_Where:UDID – Unique Differentiation IdentifierNNN – UDID numberSUBJECT – Subject ID from whom iPSC was derived (iPSC line name)CLONE – iPSC clone numberPASSAGE – iPSC passage numberMONO – indicates Monolayer stageDAY – number of the day of monolayer stageFLASK – Indicates number of flask when performing differentiation in multiple flasksVIEW – location in the flask (Please refer to the Figure 3A for details)DATE – Date of the imaging in format YYYYMMDDNote: Make sure that the markers are not present at the image.",
    "Make sure that the files names are unique and according to the abovementioned example. This will allow for an automatic analysis of the images and prediction of the time when monolayer reaches 80% confluency.Every 24 h take images in the same spotsOptional: Use automatic imaging system to take images Images (JPG, PNG or TIFF format) are analyzed according to following procedure:The image is transformed to monochromatic by determining the intensity of each pixel as the average of the intensities of the red, green and blue channels.Edges are sharpened using high-pass filter. The matrix used for this filter is 15 x 15 with values -1 on the diagonals and +28 in the center.Contrasts are enhanced by multiplying the pixel intensities by 2.Mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities are calculated. The image is transformed from monochromatic to binary by setting all pixels with intensity more than two standard deviations higher than the mean to white (intensity = 1) and all other pixels to black (intensity = 0).The resulting binary image is dilated using a disc-shaped structuring element with diameter 5 pixels.1,000 50 x 50 pixels sub-images are randomly selected. For each sub-image, the number of white pixels is calculated. Each sub-image is considered as “cell” if at least 50% of its pixels is white, “background” if at least 50% of its pixels is black. Confluence is calculated as the number of “cell” sub-images divided by 1,000.ccEstimate is available on GitHub (https://github.com/s041629/ccEstimate[href=https://github.com/s041629/ccEstimate]) and requires minimal knowledge of R. After installing the package and its dependencies, it is sufficient for the user to run the function ccEstimate(input_file.jpg), where input_file.jpg is the image obtained from the monolayer iPSC culture. This function returns a numeric value, included between 0 and 1, representing the confluency.",
    "For predicting the optimal moment for initiating differentiation, the user will have to save all images associated with the same sample in a single folder and then run run_confluency_estimation(input_folder). The ccEstimate package includes an example dataset, which can be investigated using the run_confluency_estimation(run_example = TRUE) function.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200915/20200915080247_1524.pngFigure 3.

(2019b).Notes: It is critical to maintain 24h schedule of media change (media change should be performed at the exact same time, on the days indicated in Steps F1-F26), especially during first 10 days of differentiation. For example: if D0–initiation of the differentiation (Step F1) is performed at 9:15 AM, following media changes should be done at 9:15AM according the schedule of media changes indicated in Steps F2-26. Mix well all the supplements with media by inverting 20-30 times. All media changes are performed with 35 ml/T150 flask. Day 0 (D0): When iPSC monolayer reaches about 80% confluency initiate the iPSC-CVPCs differentiation by replacing mTeSR medium with RPMI Minus medium (see Recipes: Table 6) supplemented with 12 μM CHIR99021 (see Recipes: Table 11).D1: 24 h after initiation of the differentiation replace spent medium with fresh RPMI Minus medium.D2: No media change.",
    "D3: 72 h after initiation of the differentiation prepare a combined fresh and spent RPMI Minus medium by mixing 18 ml of fresh RPMI Minus medium and 18 ml of spent RPMI Minus medium. Mix media gently by inverting and add 7.5 μM IWP-2 (see Recipes: Table 12). Mix well by inverting. Replace spent medium with combined RPMI Minus medium supplemented with 7.5 μM IWP-2.Note: Replace spent medium with the combined medium prepared with the medium from the same flask. The effect of replacing combined medium prepared with the medium from different flask has not been extensively tested. D4: No media change.D5: 48 h after addition of IWP-2 (120 h after initiation of the differentiation) replace spent medium with fresh RPMI Minus medium.D6: No media change.D7: 168 h after initiation of the differentiation replace spent RPMI Minus medium with fresh RPMI Plus medium (see Recipes: Table 7).D8: No media change.D9: 216 h after initiation of the differentiation replace spent medium with fresh RPMI Plus medium.D10: No media change.D11: Replace spent medium with fresh RPMI Plus medium.D12: No media change.D13: Replace spent medium with fresh RPMI Plus medium.D14: No media change. Coat new T150 flasks with Matrigel (20 ml per flask).D15: Passage the iPSC-CVPCs using Accutase.Note: Mechanical separation of iPSC-CVPCs at D15 is critical for efficient metabolic cell purification using Lactate.(Optional) Take images and/or video recording of the cells. Refer to Figure 5A for a representative image of iPSC-CVPCs at D15.Aspirate spent medium and wash cells with PBS (20 ml/T150 flask).Aspirate PBS and add 10 ml of room temperature Accutase to each T150 flask.

    "Gently scrape cells from the surface of the flask, using a cell scraper.Collect cells in a 125 ml sterile bottle.Wash plate three additional times, each with 10 ml of CVPCs Harvest medium. Collect all cells in the same bottle.Note: Do not break the cells into single cells. Cells will re-attach better if they are in small clumps of few cells per clump.Mix all the cells by inverting the bottle and divide them into appropriate amount of 50ml conical tubes to centrifuge the cells.Centrifuge cells for 8 min at 136 x g (800 RPE in a Sorvall 75006445 rotor with 75006441 K buckets) at room temperature.After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 20 ml of RPMI Plus medium supplemented with 5 μM ROCK Inhibitor.Mix the cell suspension by inverting 10-20 times. Perform the live cell count using 0.4% Trypan Blue Solution.Note: Because the cells were passaged in small clumps (and not as single cells), the goal is to obtain an estimate and not a precise cell count. The estimated cell count will be used to determine the number of new T150 flasks onto which cells will be re-plated. Determine the number of flasks necessary to re-plate the cells.
