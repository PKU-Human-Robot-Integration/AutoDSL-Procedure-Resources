    "_General considerations:_\nThe ability to determine de novo synthesized \\(s<sup>4</sup>U labeled) transcripts by SLAMseq will depend on \\(1) the cellular s<sup>4</sup>U uptake kinetics, labeling time and s<sup>4</sup>U concentration, \\(2) the overall transcriptional activity of the cell type and \\(3) the library sequencing depth. These parameters need to be taken into account when designing a SLAMseq experiment, particularly when employing short s<sup>4</sup>U pulse labeling, where sequencing depth demands adjustments to the given cellular parameters.\nWe highly recommend testing optimal concentrations of s<sup>4</sup>U for the cell line of interest by assessing cellular toxicity \\(e.g. using CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability assay, Promega after manufacturer’s instructions) and s<sup>4</sup>U incorporation rates \\(e.g. by HPLC, see below) prior to the sequencing experiment in order to meet s<sup>4</sup>U -labeling conditions that do not affect gene expression or cellular viability. \n**s<sup>4</sup>U Labeling of the cells \\(pulse/chase)**\n_Protect s<sup>4</sup>U from light._\nPulse labeling:\n- Seed cells the day before the labelling experiment in a density that allows exponential growth for the duration of the experiment \\(50-80% confluency).\n- Prepare cell culture growth medium supplemented with non-toxic concentrations of s<sup>4</sup>U \\(i.e. 100 µM for mESCs; Note, this concentration can vary for different cell types).\n- Remove media from the cells and replace with s<sup>4</sup>U -containing media to start the pulse labeling.\n_Note, that regular exchange of fresh s<sup>4</sup>U-containing media \\(i.e. every three hours) can significantly enhance s4U incorporation._\n- Take off media at the time-points of interest and lyse cells directly in TRIzol®.\n- Store samples at -80°C or directly proceed with RNA isolation.\nPulse/chase labeling:\n- After pulse labeling \\(see above), remove s<sup>4</sup>U -containing media from the cells.\n- Wash cells twice with 1 X PBS.\n- Add cell culture growth medium containing 100 X excess of uridine \\(compared to s<sup>4</sup>U concentration in the pulse) to cells.",
    "- Take off media at the time-points of interest and lyse the cells directly in TRIzol®.\n- Store samples at -80°C or directly proceed with RNA isolation.\n**RNA isolation**\n_DTT is added during RNA isolation to keep the sample under reducing conditions._\n- Thaw lysate and incubate 5 min at room temperature\n- Add 200 µl chloroform per 1 ml of TRIzol®\n- Shake tube vigorously for 15 sec\n- Incubate at room temperature for 2-3 min\n- Spin down at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C\n- Transfer aqueous phase to new tube\n- Add 1/100 volume of 10 mM DTT \\(0.1 mM final concentration), 1 volume 2-propanol and optionally 1 µl glycogen \\(20 mg/ml)\n- Vortex well\n- Incubate 10 min at room temperature\n- Spin down at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C\n- Discard supernatant\n- Add 500 µl 75% EtOH and 5 µl of 10 mM DTT, vortex well\n- Spin down at 7,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature\n- Remove supernatant, let the pellet dry for ~5-10 min and resuspend in appropriate amount of water supplemented with 1 mM DTT \\(final concentration)\n- Incubate for 10 min at 55°C\n- Measure concentration by Nanodrop and freeze RNA at -80°C or proceed to the next step\nProceed with _“Digestion to single Nucleosides”_ in order to prepare the samples for HPLC analysis and control s<sup>4</sup>U incorporation rates or to _“Thiol modification”_ in order to alkylate s<sup>4</sup>U for subsequent library preparation and sequencing.\n**Optional: Digestion to single nucleosides and HPLC analysis**",
    "_Note: Single nucleoside digestion and HPLC analysis is optional but highly recommended to confirm adequate RNA labeling conditions, a necessary requirement for a successful SLAMseq experiment. Because HPLC-analysis is less sensitive compared to SLAMseq, s<sup>4</sup>U -incorporation is only detectable at later labeling timepoints \\(i.e. ≥3 h after labeling with 100 µM s<sup>4</sup>U in mESC)._\n- Prepare the reaction to digest and dephosphorylate total RNA to single nucleosides as described in Table 1.\n- Incubate overnight \\(≥16h) at 37°C\n- Add 6 µl 3 M NaOAc \\(pH 5.2), 150 µl ice-cold 100% EtOH and 30 µl 10 mM DTT \\(1 mM final concentration), vortex\n- Incubate 10 min at -80°C\n- Spin down at 12,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature\n- Transfer supernatant to a new tube\n- Add 30 µl 10 mM DTT and 270 µl ice-cold 100% EtOH, incubate for 10 min at -80°C\n- Spin down at 12,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature\n- Transfer supernatant to a new tube\n- Evaporate supernatant in speed-vac to complete dryness\n- Dissolve sample in 50 µl H<sub>2</sub>O. Store at -20°C if necessary.\n- Take 25 µl of the digested RNA sample and add 75 µl H<sub>2</sub>O\n- For the uridine and s<sup>4</sup>U standards, prepare the stock solutions from 2 mg/ml uridine and 0.1 mg/ml s<sup>4</sup>U stock solutions as described in Table 2.\nPrepare the standard dilutions as described in Table 3.\n- Load the samples and the standards on HPLC. HPLC is performed on a Supelco Discovery C18 \\(bonded phase silica 5 µM particle, 250 x 4.6 mm) reverse phase column. For running conditions refer to \\(Spitzer et al., 2014) and \\(Andrus and Kuimelis, 2001).\n**Thiol modification \\(Iodoacetamide treatment)**",
    "- Prepare the reaction mix for each Iodoacetamide \\(IAA) treatment reaction as described in Table 4.\n- Incubate reaction at 50°C for 15 min\n- Stop reaction by quenching the reaction with 1 µl 1M DTT\n- Add 1 µl glycogen \\(20 mg/ml), 5 µl NaOAc \\(3M, pH 5.2), 125 µl EtOH 100%, vortex and precipitate for 30 min at -80°C\n- Spin down at 16,000 x g for 30 min\n- Wash with 1 ml 75% EtOH, vortex\n- Spin down at 16,000 x g for 10 min\n- Remove supernatant and let the pellet dry for 5-10 min\n- Resuspend in appropriate volume \\(5-10 µl) H<sub>2</sub>O \n- Proceed with RNA quality control and library preparation\n**Library preparation for High-Throughput Sequencing**\nFor mRNA SLAMseq, we recommend 3´ end sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina \\(Lexogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions \\(QuantSeq FWD kit).\n_Considerations for sample sequencing: As standard approach, we performed SLAMseq on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine. Sequencing depth needs to be adjusted to s<sup>4</sup>U incorporation, which is dependent on the experimental s<sup>4</sup>U labeling time, the cellular s<sup>4</sup>U uptake kinetics and the overall transcriptional activity of the cell type. As a rough estimate \\(based on experiments using mouse embryonic stem cells), we recommend for longer labeling times \\(i.e. >3h) 10-20 million and for short pulse labelling \\(i.e. <3h) 30-50 million reads per library for efficient quantification of s<sup>4</sup>U-labeled transcripts. We recommend sequencing reactions in single read 100 \\(SR100) mode, which recovers ~70% of all labeled transcripts in mESCs under steady-state labeling conditions \\(i.e. 100 µM s<sup>4</sup>U-labeling for 24 h)._\n**Data analysis**",
    "In principle, any self-assembled bioinformatics analysis pipeline can be employed to recover and quantify T>C-conversion containing reads. Bioinformatics analysis in the publication associated with this protocol has been performed using Digital Unmasking of Nucleotide conversion-containing K-mers \\(DUNK) \\(see full description and availability from http://t-neumann.github.io/slamdunk). SLAM-DUNK \\(Neumann et al., manuscript in preparation) is a fully automated, modular and T>C-conversion-aware alignment software package streamlining SLAMseq data analysis. Briefly, SLAM-DUNK comes with several statistics and diagnostic plotting functions as well as a MultiQC \\(http://multiqc.info) plugin to make SLAMseq data analysis and integration available to bench-scientists. \nSLAM-DUNK executes the following four main steps:\n\\(1) SLAM-DUNK uses NextGenMap \\(Sedlazeck et al., 2013) to map the SLAMseq reads to a reference genome.\n\\(2) Reads with a high number of mismatches and reads that map to more than one annotated 3′ UTR are discarded.\n\\(3) SLAM-DUNK uses VarScan2 \\(Koboldt et al., 2012) to identify genuine SNPs between the reference and the sequenced genomes.\n\\(4) SLAM-DUNK counts the number of T>C containing reads and estimates the fraction of labeled transcripts for each gene individually. SNP positions and read positions with a low base quality value are automatically excluded.\nThe final output of SLAM-DUNK reports for each transcript the genomic coordinates and the UTR region, the T content of the UTR region, the number of mapped reads \\(raw counts and norm. counts), the number of T>C conversion-containing reads, the coverage over T positions, the T>C conversion rate, and the number of multimapping reads."
