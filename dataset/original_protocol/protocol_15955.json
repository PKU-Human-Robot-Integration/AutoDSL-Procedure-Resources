    "The experimental paradigm (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0001]) that we have employed for quantitative measurement of trogocytosis involves a 15 to 60 min incubation at 37°C of Al488- (or Al647-) mAb-opsonized donor cells with acceptor cells such as adherent THP-1 monocytic cells (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0003]). All samples are run in duplicate or triplicate and usually three or more controls are included to validate the experimental trogocytosis condition. Opsonized donor cells are added to empty wells for a 45 min incubation at 37°C to determine if the cell-bound opsonizing mAb simply dissociates from (or is internalized by) the donor cells (Control 1). Opsonized donor cells (first held on ice for 45 min) are added to either empty wells (Control 2, no trogocytosis), or to wells with adherent THP-1 cells (Control 3, zero-time), followed by immediate quenching with cold BSA-PBS to test for the effect of simple processing of the samples (centrifugation and wash steps). In previous experiments we reported that samples that were simply held on ice and never exposed to THP-1 cells had identical signals to the zero-time samples. In this article we only report the zero-time controls. Finally, sample 4 is the experimental trogocytosis protocol in which opsonized donor cells are reacted with adherent acceptor THP-1 cells for 15 to 60 min at 37°C and are then quenched by addition of cold BSA-PBS. After quenching, the donor cells are transferred from the adhered THP-1 cells to a FACS tube by gentle pipetting, washed with BSA-PBS (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0004]), and then the (putatively) trogocytosed donor cells, along with the control samples, are analyzed by flow cytometry.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/90757ef8-6094-468e-9326-bc86a34df4fe/cpz1897-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSchematic procedure for measuring trogocytosis mediated by adherent THP-1 acceptor cells. Controls for dissociation, zero-time, and no acceptor cells are important for validation of trogocytosis.",
    "The flow cytometry analyses include several of the following determinations: The trogocytosed donor cells are analyzed for the level of (residual) bound Al488 mAb (FL1). Alternatively, the trogocytosed donor cells are re-opsonized with Al488 mAb, washed, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. This procedure, combined with the other measurements, tests for simple dissociation of cell-bound Al488 mAb and allows for determination of the total amount of target antigen available on the trogocytosed donor cells after the trogocytosis reaction. As is illustrated below, we find that the % trogocytosis, which reflects loss of the Al488 mAb from donor cells, is in very good agreement with the % trogocytosis determined based on the % available antigen after re-opsonization. In some experiments the donor cells are also stained with the membrane dye PKH 26, immediately before or after opsonization is equally effective (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0005]). After the trogocytosis reaction the acceptor cells are examined for uptake of PKH26 (FL2 signal), which reflects transfer of plasma membrane fragments from the donor cells that occurred in concert with removal of the opsonizing mAb. These experiments make use of either 2 or 3 different colors in the flow cytometry analyses (FL1, FL2, FL4) and in all cases compensation controls with cells stained with a single dye are first examined. The level of PKH26 dye remaining on the donor cells is considerably greater than the amount of PKH26 taken up by the acceptor cells, and this allows for additional and reliable analyses of the donor and acceptor cells. As is illustrated in selected experiments below, trogocytosis always includes transfer of membrane fragments from the donor cell to the acceptor cell.",
    "The acceptor cells, which in the illustrated examples are either THP-1 cells or freshly isolated human monocytes, are examined by flow cytometry. In reactions in which the THP-1 cells are adhered to wells, after the trogocytosed donor cells are gently removed from the wells followed by a wash, the adherent THP-1 cells are then removed from the wells by vigorous pipetting.\nWe will describe additional controls in several experiments that are designed to enhance the validity of the measurements. For example, we have determined that the processes we are studying are mediated by Fcγ receptors on acceptor cells (Beum et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-bib-0004]), and we find (see below) that pre-incubation of acceptor cells with human IgG (to block Fc receptors) also substantially blocks trogocytosis. We have also demonstrated trogocytosis based on probing donor cells with Alexa-labeled mAb HB43, which binds to the Fc region of chimeric/humanized mAbs (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0008]). Use of mAb HB43 allows for evaluation of unlabeled cell-bound mAb [e.g., cetuximab (CET), trastuzumab (TRA)]. As already noted, it is certainly possible that the Al488 mAb simply dissociates from the opsonized donor cell, and then the released mAb may be taken up by Fcγ receptors on the acceptor cell. To test for this possibility, we incubate the opsonized donor cells in buffer alone for 45 min at 37°C (Control 1). The supernatant, possibly containing released opsonizing mAb, is then added to unreacted but adherent THP-1 cells to determine if they take up any putatively released Al488 mAb.\nMaterials\nCells\n               \nTHP-1 acceptor cells (ATCC, cat. no.

    "1. Count THP-1 cells using a hemocytometer. Suspend THP-1 cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 μM PMA. Transfer 1 ml aliquots to the wells of a 24-well culture plate, cover and culture for 2 to 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator.\n2. Inspect the wells under 10× magnification to verify that cells have adhered. Remove the medium by aspiration and incubate the adherent THP-1 cells for 1 h at 37°C with either 100 μl complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mg/ml purified human IgG or complete RPMI 1640 medium alone (control).\n3. Add 1-10 × 105 PKH26-labeled Al488 T101-opsonized donor cells or PKH26-labeled donor cells (not opsonized with Al488 T101) in 400 μl complete RPMI 1640 medium to the THP-1 cells into both the positive control wells and the IgG-containing wells (see Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0001] and Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0005]).\n4. Centrifuge the plate 1 min at 50 × g, 4°C, to pellet the donor cells. Cover the plate and incubate for 45 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n5. Add 2 ml ice-cold BSA-PBS to each well to quench the reaction samples. In additional controls, add PKH26-labeled Al488 T101-opsonized donor cells (held on ice for 45 min) to wells containing THP-1 cells, followed by immediate quenching with 2 ml cold BSA-PBS. This is the zero-time control.\n6. Transfer all quenched samples to FACS tubes, wash the samples twice (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0004]) and reconstitute in 250 μl PBS after the last wash.\n7. Examine the PKH26-labeled donor cells by flow cytometry using an FL2 gate that excludes the weakly-positive PKH26 signal on the THP-1 cells. Count 8000 events.",
    "The testable hypothesis is that after the incubation there will be loss of the Al488 signal from the donor cells reacted with the THP-1 acceptor cells, compared to the zero-time control. We also expect that there will be little, if any, loss of signal from the donor cells when they are incubated with acceptor cells that are blocked with human IgG.\n8. Isolate the THP-1 cells after the trogocytosis reaction as follows:\n         \nWash the wells previously used for the trogocytosis reaction 3 times with BSA-PBS.\nAdd 1 ml BSA-PBS and pipet vigorously 10 times to release the THP-1 cells.\nTransfer the released THP-1 cells to FACS tubes.\nWash once (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0004]).\nReconstitute to 250 μl in PBS containing 2 mg/ml mouse IgG to reduce non-specific binding of probes.\n9. Probe the released THP-1 cells as follows: \n         \nIncubate the THP-1 cells with 10 μl of a cocktail containing 0.06 μg/ul each of biotinylated antibodies to CD11b and to CD14.\nIncubate these samples for 30 min on ice, and then wash twice (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-prot-0004]).\nResuspend the cells to 100 μl in BSA-PBS and add 10 μl of 0.1 mg/ml Al647 streptavidin.\nAfter a 30 min incubation on ice, wash the samples twice in BSA-PBS and resuspend to 250 μl in PBS.\nAnalyze by flow cytometry based on FL1/FL2/FL4 (collect 12,000 events).\nCompared to the zero-time samples, the released THP-1 cells (FL4 positive) should manifest increases in the Al488 and PKH26 (FL1 and FL2) signals, due to trogocytosis. However, these signals should remain at baseline for the THP-1 cells incubated with un-opsonized donors or cells subject to dissociation. Finally, the FL1 and FL2 signals for THP-1 cells blocked with human IgG should be close to baseline as well.",
    "10. Test for dissociation of the Al488 mAb from the donor cells as follows: \n         \nIncubate the PKH26-labeled Al488 T101-opsonized donor cells in empty wells for 45 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the plate 1 min at 50 × g, 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to THP-1 cells in a separate well followed by another incubation of 45 min at 37°C.\nRelease the THP-1 cells from the plate by vigorous pipetting and analyze them by flow cytometry to determine if they take up any Al488 or PKH26 that could have been released into the supernatant from the PKH26-labeled Al488 T101-opsonized donor cells.\nBased on numerous calibration studies, we expect that there will be little, if any increase in theAl488 and PKH26 background signals (compared to background) for the released THP-1 cells.\nMESF calculations for flow cytometry experiments\nIn order to obtain a rigorous quantitative measure of trogocytosis, mean fluorescence intensities, recorded as channel numbers, are converted to molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophore (MESF units) based on using a graduated series of fluorescent beads, with defined MESF values (Spherotech). The channel number of each standard bead is determined by flow cytometry under the exact instrument settings for each experiment. The slope (m) and intercept (b) of a plot of the log defined MESF vs experimental channel number are calculated using the equation: log MESF (y) = mx + b, where x = channel number. In the example in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0002] the derived values are m = 0.00405 and b = 2.865. Based on these values, it is then straight-forward to convert any given channel number into an MESF value, based on calculating anti-logs. For instance, in this example, a channel number of 600 would convert to an MESF of 197,701.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/381ea126-718f-4437-9007-28d0de37b595/cpz1897-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nExample of the calculation of MESF values from channel numbers.",
    "Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0003] shows flow cytometry analyses of trogocytosis of donor PKH26-labeled MOLT 4 cells opsonized with Al488 T101 and then reacted with adherent acceptor THP-1 cells at donor to acceptor ratios of 1:10 (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0003]) or 1:1 (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0003]). The light scattering gating scheme identifies the MOLT 4 cells. Cells were reacted for 45 min at 37°C with THP-1 cells alone (trogocytosis, pink) or with THP-1 cells first blocked with 2 mg/ml human IgG (blocked, green). Alternatively, the donor cells were first incubated in medium alone for 45 min at 37°C and then combined with THP-1 cells and immediately quenched with cold BSA-PBS (blue, zero-time). The gating scheme was set to eliminate any cells that were weakly positive for PKH26, thus only showing the donor MOLT 4 cells. Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0003] shows MESF values for the respective 3 samples reacted at donor:acceptor ratios of 1:10 were 29,000; 54,000; and 59,000. The % trogocytosis, based on comparing the trogocytosis sample with the zero-time sample is therefore ∼50%: 100 × [(59,000–29,000)/59,000)] %, and it is evident that human IgG substantially blocked trogocytosis. In Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0003], a similar but separate experiment with a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:1, the MESF values for the three samples were 37,000 (pink, trogocytosis); 49,000 (green, IgG block); and 54,000 (blue, zero-time), corresponding to ∼30% trogocytosis.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9545eaba-3772-4f3e-919f-76c209fa9fe5/cpz1897-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nFlow cytometry analyses of trogocytosis of donor PKH26-labeled Al488 T101-opsonized MOLT-4 cells reacted with adherent THP-1 cells.

The gating scheme was set to include cells weakly positive for PKH26 (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0004]). Dot plots illustrate the uptake of Al488 (top plot) and PKH26 (bottom plot) for FL4 positive THP-1 cells identified by probing with biotinylated CD11b/CD14 and secondarily developed with Al647 streptavidin. The quadrants were defined by analysis of naïve THP-1 cells (not shown).

The results demonstrate that approximately 26% and 43% of the THP-1 cells acquire Al488 and PKH26, respectively (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0004]). Uptake is substantially blocked by pre-incubation of the THP-1 cells with human IgG (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0004]). It should be noted that in the zero-time sample (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0004]), very few donor cells are demonstrable, because they were only added after the 45 min incubation and then immediately quenched and processed. In the dissociation control (Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0004]), the donor cells were incubated for 45 min at 37°C in the absence of THP-1 cells.

The A280 divided by 1.5 gives the mAb concentration in mg/ml.\nOptimal protein concentration for this reaction is 2 mg/ml. Dilute with BS as needed. Higher protein concentration results in aggregation and loss of product.\n3. Allow Alexa NHS vial to come to room temperature before opening the vial.\n4. Raise pH of the mAb solution by adding a 10% volume of 1 M bicarbonate buffer.\n5. Use pH strip to make sure the pH is >8.\n6. Immediately before use, dissolve 1 mg Alexa 488 NHS in 100 µl DMSO.\n7. Add 10 µl Alexa dye/mg mAb.\n8. Mix gently by inversion. Do not vortex.\n9. React, protected from light, 1 hr at room temperature.\n10. Add 50 µl 1 M Tris, pH 8 to stop the reaction.\n11. Remove unreacted dye from Alexa-mAb by gel filtration on BioRad columns equilibrated with BS buffer. The protein-dye conjugate exits in the void volume.\n12. Measure the absorbance at 280 nm and 495 nm of the isolated Al488 mAbs.\n13. Calculate mg/ml mAb concentration and F/P ratio according to manufacturer's directions as follows:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} {\\rm{Protein}}\\,{\\rm{concentration}}\\,\\left( M \\right) = \\frac{{\\left[ {{\\rm{A}}280-\\left( {{\\rm{Adye}} \\times {\\rm{CF}}280} \\right)} \\right] \\times {\\rm{dilution}}\\,{\\rm{factor}}}}{{203,000}} \\end{equation*}$$",
    "where 203,000 is the molar extinction coefficient (ε) in cm–1 M–1 of a typical IgG at 280 nm which is suitable for IgA, IgD, and IgE as well. The value CF280 is a correction factor for the fluorophore's contribution to the absorbance at 280 nm. For Alexa 488 the CF280 is 0.11.\n14. formula:\n${\\rm{Calculate}}\\,{\\rm{Moles}}\\,{\\rm{fluorophore/mole}}\\,{\\rm{protein}} = \\frac{{{\\rm{Adye}} \\times {\\rm{dilution}}\\,{\\rm{factor}}}}{{\\varepsilon {\\rm{dye}} \\times {\\rm{protein}}\\,{\\rm{concentration}}\\,( {\\rm{M}} )}}$\nwhere εdye (in cm–1M–1) is the molar extinction coefficient of the specific dye. Use 71,000 as the molar extinction coefficient for Al488 at 495 nm. A similar calculation is used for Al647 mAbs, except Al647 has a different extinction coefficient and correction factor.

Wash the samples once and reconstitute to 250 μl with PBS and examine by flow cytometry.\nIf trogocytosis occurs successfully, then the FL4-positive monocytes should show increased levels of both Al488 and PKH26 in the positive control trogocytosis monocytes, compared to low background levels for both zero-time monocytes or monocytes that were blocked with human IgG.\nFigure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.897#cpz1897-fig-0006] shows that trogocytosis mediates loss of Al488 mAb T101 signal from opsonized MOLT4 cells incubated with freshly isolated human monocytes in solution for 1 hr, 37°C. FL2-positive donor cells were analyzed for FL1 signal. In addition to the trogocytosis sample (pink, 24,000 MESF), the controls include zero-time (blue, 64,000 MESF); IgG block (green, 64,000 MESF) and simple dissociation (yellow, 65,000 MESF). The yellow and blue histograms coincide with the green histogram. Based on these values, the % trogocytosis was ∼63%. In additional controls, the cells were re-opsonized with Al488 T101 to allow for measurement of total available antigen accessible. This second opsonization had only marginal effects on the Al488 signals associated with the cells (results not shown). The results for the trogocytosed sample before (pink, 24,000 MESF) and after re-opsonization (29,000 MESF) are quite similar.
