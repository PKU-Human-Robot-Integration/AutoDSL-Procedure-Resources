    "1. Liposome Preparation\nNOTE: Briefly, preparation of liposomes usually includes three crucial steps: 1) preparation of dry lipid films of the desired lipid composition; 2) rehydration of the lipids for formation of liposomes; and 3) controlling the size and lamellarity of the liposome population.\nWeigh out the lipids and dissolve them in tert-butanol:water (9:1) in glass vials.\n\t\nDissolve POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine; MW = 760 g/mol) to 50 mM.\nDissolve cholesterol (MW = 387 g/mol) to 25 mM.\nDissolve DOPE-Atto488 (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-Atto488; MW = 1,316 g/mol) to 0.1 mM.\nDissolve DOPE-Atto655 (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-Atto655; MW = 1,368 g/mol) to 0.1 mM.\nDissolve DSPE-PEG2000-biotin (1,2-distearyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatethanolamine-N-[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000]; MW = 3,017 g/mol) to 0.1 mM.\n\t\tNOTE: Heat lipids to 55 °C and use magnetic stirring in order to ensure complete dissolution of the lipids. Alternatively, use a sonication bath. Unused lipid stocks can be stored at -20 °C for several months.\nMix the lipid stocks prepared in step 1.1 to a molar ratio of POPC:cholesterol:DOPE-Atto488:DOPE-Atto655:DOPE-PEG-biotin 68.95:30:0.5:0.5:0.05, by adding 138 µL of POPC, 120 µL of cholesterol, 500 µL of each fluorescently labeled lipid, and 50 µL of DSPE-PEG-biotin to a fresh glass vial.\n\tNOTE: The exact liposome composition can easily be modified in order to address the specific question of interest. See discussion for more detail.\nLoosen the lid of the glass vial, and snap-freeze the vial in liquid nitrogen.\nLyophilize the frozen lipid mixture overnight.\nAdd 1 mL of 200 mM D-sorbitol buffer (sorbitol buffer) to the dry lipids.\nHeat the mixture to 45 °C and expose to magnetic stirring for at least 1 h.",
    "NOTE: The buffer should reflect the specific question that is being addressed (e.g., physiological conditions for studying membrane-protein interactions, or a specific clinically approved buffer for studying drug delivery liposomes). However, if a specific buffer is not required for the study, a buffer without ions can be applied for rehydration in order to reduce the multilamellarity of the liposomes.\nFreeze the lipid suspension by dipping the vial in liquid nitrogen, and wait until the suspension is completely frozen.\nDip the frozen suspension in a heating bath at 55 °C until the mixture is completely thawed.\nRepeat steps 1.7 and 1.8 until the liposome suspension has been exposed to a total of 11 freeze/thaw cycles.\n\tNOTE: Repeated freeze/thaw cycles have shown to reduce liposome multilamellarity23, which is paramount for the accuracy of the single liposome assay, as multilamellar liposomes will skew the fluorescence intensity versus liposome size ratio of the liposomes. The multilamellarity is usually inherently low when including more than 0.5% PEGylated lipid in the formulation (such as commonly done in liposomes for drug delivery)24.\nExtrude the liposome suspension once through an 800 nm polycarbonate filter using a mini extrusion kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for assembly of the extrusion kit (see Table of Materials).\nStore the liposomes at 4 °C overnight.\n2. Surface Preparation of Imaging Chamber\nPrepare bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 mg/mL), BSA-biotin (1 mg/mL) and streptavidin (0.025 mg/mL) in 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) 95 mM NaCl buffer (HEPES buffer).\n\tNOTE: To prevent liposomal burst, the sorbitol buffer used for rehydration and the HEPES buffer used for surface preparation should be isotonic. It is thus recommended to check the osmolarity of the buffers before the experiment.",
    "Mix 1,200 µL of BSA and 120 µL of BSA-biotin and add 300 µL of the mixture to each well in an 8 well slide for microscopy.\n\tNOTE: Here we use a commercially available 8 well microscope slide with a glass bottom (see Table of Materials), but the protocol can easily be adapted to customized microscope chambers.\nIncubate the slide for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\nWash the slide 8x with 300 µL of HEPES buffer.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to leave the wells without buffer for more than a few seconds, as drying out the surface will damage it. Furthermore, be careful not to scratch the surface with the pipette tip as this will also damage it. Thus, when aspirating buffer from a well, do it from the edge or corner.\nAdd 250 µL of streptavidin and incubate for 10 min at RT.\nRepeat the 8 washes described in step 2.4.\nStore the microscope slide with 300 µL of sorbitol buffer in each well at 4 °C. Evaporation of the solvent will damage the surface, so put the microscope slide in a Petri dish and seal it with parafilm unless the prepared slide is used immediately.\n3. Liposome Immobilization\nDilute the liposome suspension to about 20 µM total lipid in sorbitol buffer. The procedure in section 1 will yield a liposome suspension of approximately 10 mM total lipid.\nPlace the slide on the microscope and focus on the surface of the chamber using the increased laser reflection signal from the glass/buffer interface as a guide.\nWash the chamber 4x with 300 µL of fresh HEPES buffer.\nAdd 10 µL of diluted liposome stock (20 µM total lipid) to a microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Take out 100 µL of buffer from the chamber, add to the microcentrifuge tube prepared in step 3.4, mix properly, and put the 110 µL back into the chamber.\nPut the specimen under the microscope, and use a rudimental microscope setting capable of detecting signal from the liposome fluorophore(s) to observe the liposomes being immobilized on the surface.\nAim for a liposome surface density that is simultaneously sparse enough to indentify individual liposomes and dense enough that it facilitates high-throughput measurements. Typically using a 50 µm x 50 µm field of view, 300−400 liposomes per frame is optimal (Figure 2). This can usually be achieved within 5−10 min.\n\tNOTE: If only rapidly moving fluorescent particles are detected in the field of view, an absence or too low concentration of any of the components critical for the immobilization process (BSA-biotin, streptavidin, DOPE-PEG-biotin) might be the cause. If no liposomes are detected it might either be related to a low concentration of liposomes, improper settings for the fluorescence detection, or potentially imaging with a focal plane not at the glass surface.\nOnce an appropriate liposome surface density is reached, wash the chamber 3x with 200 µL of HEPES buffer.\n\tNOTE: Be aware that the immobilization kinetics also depend on liposome properties such as size and charge and should thus always be optimized for each liposome formulation.\n4. Image Acquisition\nNOTE: This section will depend a lot on the microscope system available to the researcher performing the experiment. Thus, overall guidelines on how to perform the imaging will be described. However, the exact settings and how to apply them will vary between the different microscope setups. For example, some systems allow choosing any emission filter combination desired, while other microscopes are equipped with specific, preset filters.",
    "Set up the microscope for imaging single liposomes. To ensure optimal image quality and subsequent data analysis use a high greyscale resolution and a pixel scheme that allows for oversampling individual liposomes. A bit depth of 16 and at least 1,024 x 1,024 pixels for a 50 µm x 50 µm area is recommended. If available, line-averaging can beneficially be applied to reduce noise (e.g., 3 scans per line).\nSelect an excitation laser power that both ensures nonsignificant frame-to-frame bleaching and strong enough signal to clearly discriminate individual liposomes from the background. The optimal setting will depend on the specific microscope used as well as the fluorophore combination. Make sure that detectors are not saturated, as this will bias intensity quantification.\nImaging both the DOPE-Atto488 and DOPE-Atto655 fluorophores in the liposomes requires imaging multiple channels. Thus, make sure each channel is imaged sequentially to avoid cross-excitation. For example, first take one image by exciting at 488 nm and reading emission at 495−560 nm. Thereafter, take another image by exciting at 633 nm but reading emission only at 660−710 nm. The specifics will depend on the microscope system (e.g., which lasers and filters) available.\nMake sure to cover different areas of the surface, acquiring at least 10 images of the sample, thus imaging at least 3,000 individual liposomes. If the surface density is lower than 300 liposomes/frame, acquire more images. Make sure to refocus the microscope for every new image.\n\tNOTE: For two-channel imaging, make sure to name the image files so that pairs of images with the same liposomes in different fluorescence channels can easily be identified during data analysis.",
    "In order to quantify the experimental uncertainty relating to the measurement of compositional inhomogeneity, image the same area of liposomes before and after refocusing (see Figure 3 and description in the text).\nExport the images from the microscope software as .tiff files. Export the two channels of the same liposomes individually.\n5. Data Analysis\nNOTE: Specially developed automated 2D Gaussian fitting routines have previously been employed6,11,12. However, to increase the applicability of the method a data analysis process that can be easily implemented in all laboratories is described.\nLoad the corresponding pair of .tiff images of two different fluorescence channels in the same imaging field into the FIJI (FIJI Is Just ImageJ) software.\nIn the Image menu, choose Color, and use the Merge Channel function to create a composite of the two channels.\nObserve if the liposomes imaged in two different channels display good colocalization or whether visible drift occurred.\n\tNOTE: In case of drift between the two fluorescence channels (recognized as a systematic and equal X-Y offset between the signal in the two channels), one of the frames can be translated using the Transform > Translate function in the Image menu of FIJI. However, care should be taken with such image manipulation. It is thus recommended to instead avoid drift as much as possible when imaging the liposomes.\nMake sure the ComDet plugin (v.0.3.6.1 or newer) is installed, or do this in the Plugins menu.\nOpen the ComDet plugin to detect particles by going to the Plugins menu and choosing ComDet v.0.3.6.1 > Detect Particles.\nIn ComDet, make sure to choose the Detect Particles on Both Channels Individually function. Set the Max Distance Between Co-localized Spots similar to the Approximate Particles Size. Usually, 4 pixels is appropriate for the settings described here.",
    "The signal-to-noise ratio should allow for detection of even dim particles with a low amount of fluorescence. In ComDet, set this ratio to 3 by setting the Sensitivity of Detection in both channels to Very Dim Particles (SNR = 3).\n\tNOTE: While this SNR value is usually appropriate, it might be necessary to set it higher (e.g., if there is a lot of image noise that may be identified as liposomes and lead to false positives).\nMake sure the boxes with Calculate Colocalization and Plot Detected Particles in Both Channels are checked, before pressing OK.\nAfter running the analysis, two pop-up windows with Results and Summary will show. Export the data table Results containing the colocalization data (particle coordinates and integrated intensity of each particle detected) to a data handling software of choice by saving the table as a .txt file and importing it into the software.\nMake sure that each liposome is only included once in the data set and not both the channel1/channel2 as well as channel2/channel1 ratio. Thus, filter the data so only Abs_frame = 1 is plotted in step 5.11.\n\tNOTE: By choosing Colocalized = 1, false positives from noise in the images can be removed from the analysis. However, any liposomes with only one of the two fluorescent components present will also be excluded from the analysis, thus potentially removing important data points from the analysis.\nPlot a histogram of the column with data containing the Intensity Ratio for each detected liposome.\nThe degree of compositional inhomogeneity for the studied liposomal system is represented by the width of the intensity ratio distribution. To quantify the inhomogeneity, fit the intensity ratio histogram with a Gaussian function and extract the mean (µ) and standard deviation (sigma). See the Representative Results section.",
    "A value for the degree of inhomogeneity (DI) can now be calculated using the coefficient of variation defined as DI = sigma / µ.\n6. Liposome Size Calibration\nTake out part of the liposome stock, and extrude 21x through a 50 nm polycarbonate filter as described in step 1.10.\nDilute the liposomes by adding 10 µL of the liposome suspension to 800 µL of sorbitol buffer in a microcentrifuge tube.\nTransfer the diluted liposome sample to a polypropylene single-use cuvette.\nMeasure the size using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Perform at least three independent runs to measure the size and polydispersity of the liposome suspension.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, use a more concentrated liposome suspension for the measurement. Alternatives to DLS (e.g., nanoparticle tracking analysis) can also be applied for measuring the size of the liposomes. A description of how to execute such particle-size determination is beyond the scope of this protocol.\nImage the calibration liposomes on the microscope using exactly the same experimental settings as defined in steps 4.1 and 4.2.\nExtract the integrated intensity for each calibration liposome in the calibration images: Extract the filtered results sheet containing liposome fluorescence intensities as described in steps 5.1−5.10. From the results table, extract the \"IntegratedInt\" column.\nBecause the total integrated intensity of a liposome labeled in its membrane is proportional to the surface area of the liposome and is thus proportional to the square of its diameter, plot a square root intensity histogram of the fluorescence intensity of the calibration liposomes.\nFit the integrated intensity histogram produced in step 6.7 with a log normal distribution and extract the average fluorescence intensity of the calibration liposomes.",
    "To determine the relation between the square root intensity (IntSqrt) and liposome size, calculate the correction factor (C) using the average liposome diameter (Dia) weighed by the number obtained from the DLS measurements: Dia = C x IntSqrt is equivalent to C = Dia / IntSqrt.\nCalculate IntSqrt values for the liposomes in the compositional inhomogeneity experiment and convert these to diameters by multiplying with the correction factor.\nPlot the intensity ratio value as a function of diameter for the compositional inhomogeneity liposomes, thus achieving the inhomogeneity as a function of liposome size for a population of liposomes spanning from approximately 50 nm−800 nm.\nSubscription Required.
