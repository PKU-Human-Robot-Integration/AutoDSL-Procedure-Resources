    "All experiments requiring animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the UC Denver Anschutz Medical Campus.\n1. Isolation of MEFs\nPurchase C57BL/6 pregnant mice at E13. Ship overnight.\nEuthanize the mother according to approved IACUC protocols (ex: ~1.3 L/min CO2 until animal appears dead followed by cervical dislocation)\nSpray the mother with 70% ethanol and open abdominal cavity. Remove the uterine horn containing embryos and place in a 10 cm dish with sterile PBS.\nMake an incision in the embryo sac to release embryo. Transfer embryo to clean 10 cm dish with sterile PBS. Rinse thoroughly.\nCut the body below the liver and discard the head and upper body. Remove internal organs and discard. Transfer the remaining tissue to a clean 10 cm dish with sterile PBS and transfer the plate to a Biosafety Level 1 or 2 Cabinet. Combine tissues from all embryos in a clean, dry 10 cm dish and mince into fine pieces.\nAdd 6 mL of 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA to minced embryos. Triturate several times by pipette to break up tissue. Incubate for 40 min at 37 ˚C with 5% CO2.\nResuspend cells in growth medium (Table 1). The volume of media is adjusted based on the number of embryos harvested. In general, use a ratio of approximately 25 mL growth media per 1.2 embryos.\nPlate 25 mL of resuspended cells in a 15 cm dish. After 24 h, aspirate the media and add 25 mL of fresh growth medium to each plate.",
    "After 72 h, add 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA to each 15 cm dish. When cells detach from the culture dish, inactivate trypsin with 15 mL growth medium and collect cells in 50 mL polystyrene conical tubes. Centrifuge cells for 3 min at 160 x g at room temperature. Resuspend the cell pellet in growth medium and filter through a 70 µm pore cell strainer.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and freeze MEFs in 2 million cells aliquots in freeze medium (10% DMSO, 25% FBS in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/High glucose) at -80 °C. Transfer cells to liquid nitrogen after 24 h and store until ready to use.\n\tNOTE: Global gene expression in MEFs was profiled isolated using this protocol by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to ensure cell authentication. RNA-seq data from ENCODE MEF cells were downloaded from NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE93454. RNA-seq gene expression data for the MEFs used by us were deposited in NIH GEO with accession number GSE71405. These two data sets were merged according to common gene symbols. The expression data were then log-transformed and a scatterplot of the expression data for our MEFs and ENCODE MEFs were generated and fit with a linear regression line (Figure 1A). MEFs isolated using this protocol are molecularly similar to those isolated by other labs.\n2. Production of Retrovirus and Transduction of MEFs\nNOTE: All steps in this section must be carried out in a Biosafety Level 2 Cabinet. Since this protocol utilizes retroviral transduction, ensure that safety precautions are taken including treating all waste containing viral media with 10% bleach for at least 20 min. Refer to Figure 1B for a timeline for reprogramming.\nProduction of Retrovirus using the Platinum E (PE) cell line",
    "Maintain commercially available PE cells in PE medium (Table 1) containing blasticidin and puromycin selection markers to ensure expression of gag-pol and env genes for efficient retroviral particle production36. Passage cells at 1:4 or 1:5 every two days. Take care to prevent overcrowding of cells as this can reduce retroviral production yields.\nOn the day -1, seed approximately 5 x 106 cells per 10 cm dish in the growth medium (Table 1) 16-20 h prior to transfection (see Table 2 for plating densities for other standard cell culture dish sizes). Gently rock dishes back and forth several times and carefully place in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator to ensure even plating distribution (see Figure 1C for optimal plating density prior to transfection).\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to plate PE cells in the medium free of selection markers prior to transfection to ensure medium containing generated retroviral particles does not kill MEFs.\nOn the day 0, prepare DNA for transfection. For 10 cm dish transfection, add 2 µg of each reprogramming factor — GATA4, Hand2, Mef2c, Tbx5, miR-1, and miR-133 (GHMT2m) — to a 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to Table 2 to scale the amount of DNA needed to transfect other standard cell culture dish sizes.\nIn a separate 1.5 mL tube, add 360 µL reduced serum media. Then add 36 µL transfection reagent directly to reduced serum media. Gently flick the tube and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid reduced transfection efficiency, carefully add transfection reagent directly to the reduced serum media.\nAdd reduced serum media/transfection reagent mixture to GHMT2m DNA cocktail. Gently flick the tube and incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Do not vortex.",
    "Add the reaction mixture dropwise to PE cells, gently swirl media for 10-15 s, and place in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: According to the manufacturer, PE cells generate an average titer of 106 to 107 infectious units/mL. This protocol generates approximately 2 x 106 infections units/mL by 24 h and 6 x 106 infections units/mL by 48 h for an average MOI of 4. Transfection of GFP/DsRed may also be used as a surrogate for transfection/transduction efficiency if desired; transfection efficiency is expected to exceed 90% by 48 h (Figure 1C).\nTransduction of MEFs\nOn the Day 0, coat dishes with collagen and place in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for at least 2 h.\nRemove MEFs from liquid nitrogen and thaw. Plate 0.2 x 106 cells per 60 mm dish in the growth medium. Gently rock plates to ensure even plating distribution and place in the incubator (see Figure 1C for optimal plating density and Table 2 for plating densities for other standard cell culture dish sizes).\n\t\tNOTE: These plating densities have been tested over multiple batches of isolated MEFs; unless MEFs display significantly compromised viability, adjusting cell seeding densities is not necessary.\nOn the day 1, 24 h post-transfection, use a 30 mL syringe to collect retroviral medium generated by PE cells. Pass the medium through a 0.45 µm pore-size filter into a 50 mL conical tube. Add hexadimethrine bromide transfection reagent to a final concentration of 6 µg/mL. Carefully add 10 mL fresh growth medium to PE cells by pipetting media onto the wall of the culture dish to prevent displacement of cells.",
    "Aspirate the medium from MEFs and add 4 mL of freshly harvested retroviral medium to each dish. Return MEFs to the incubator. Add 10% bleach to all materials in contact with the viral medium to neutralize retroviral particles.\nOn the day 2, 48 h post-transfection, repeat steps 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. PE cells are discarded following the 2nd collection of the retroviral medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Add 10% bleach to discarded PE cells for at least 20 min to neutralize unwanted retrovirus.\nOn the day 3, aspirate medium from MEFs and replenish with 4 mL iCM medium (Table 1) containing 0.5 µM A-83-01, a TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor. Replenish iCM medium containing A-83-01 every 2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: If using GFP as a transduction control, the expression is expected to exceed 90% by this time point (Figure 1C).\n3. Flow Cytometry for Cardiac Markers\nAspirate medium from Day 9 reprogrammed MEFs and wash (1x) with 1x PBS to remove dead cells and debris.\nAdd 1 mL 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 ˚C. Check cells using a light microscope and shake dish; if cells remain attached, incubate 5 more min at 37 ˚C until cells detach.\nWash cells in 1x PBS containing 5% FBS and filter through a 70 µm pore cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 160 x g for 3 min at room temperature and aspirate liquid from the pellet.\n\tNOTE: To increase the cell yield, leave approximately 50 µL liquid above the cell pellet.\nWash cells with 500 µL 1x PBS containing 1% BSA.\nFix cells with 0.2 mL/1 million cells fixation solution for 20 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL of 1x ice-cold perm/wash buffer.\n\tNOTE: The manufacturer's solution is 10x.\nCentrifuge cells at 160 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate supernatant.",
    "Repeat steps 3.7 and 3.8 an additional time. After the 2nd wash, proceed directly to next step or keep cells at 4 °C overnight.\nBlock with 100 µL of 5% goat serum and donkey serum in 1x perm/wash buffer for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 100 µL of diluted primary antibody.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, cells were labeled with mouse Troponin T (1:200) and mouse α-actinin (1:200) to quantify the percentage of cells positive for key components of the cardiac sarcomere. Incubate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.\nCentrifuge cells at 160 x g for 5 m at 4 °C, aspirate supernatant, and wash 2x with ice-cold perm/wash buffer.\nAdd 100 µL of diluted secondary antibody.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, cells were labeled with anti-mouse 647 nm secondary antibody (1:200). Incubate secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature on an end-over-end tube rotator. Protect cells from light by wrapping tubes in foil.\nCentrifuge cells at 160 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, aspirate supernatant, and wash 2x with ice-cold perm/wash buffer.\nAdd 1 mL of 1% BSA in PBS and perform FACS immediately.\n\tNOTE: Generate a forward scatter vs side scatter plot to gate viable cells first when performing FACS. Alternatively, use a commercially available live/dead cell stain prior to fixing cells to identify live and dead cell populations.\n4. Immunostaining of Reprogrammed MEFs\nAspirate medium from day 14 reprogrammed MEFs and wash (1x) with 1 mL 1x ice-cold PBS.\n\tNOTE: For immunostaining, reprogramming was performed in 12 well plates to minimize antibody solution volumes. 24 well plates may also be used; simply half all following volumes.\nAspirate and fix cells with 500 µL 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Aspirate and wash cells 3 times with 1 mL 1x PBS (5 min per wash at room temperature).\nPermeabilize cells with 500 µL 0.2% permeabilization reagent in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.\nAspirate and block in 500 µL 10% horse serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\nAspirate and incubate with 500 µL of the diluted primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, cells were labeled with mouse Troponin T or α-actinin (each 1:400) and co-labeled with Connexin 43 (1:400) or Troponin I (1:400).\nAspirate primary antibody and wash three times with 1 mL 1x PBS (5 min per wash at room temperature).\nAspirate and incubate with 500 µL diluted secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, cells were labeled with anti-mouse 555 nm secondary antibody (1:800) to recognize Troponin T or α-actinin and anti-rabbit 488 nm secondary antibody (1:800) to recognize Connexin 43 or Troponin I. Additionally, nuclei were stained with Hoechst (1:10,000). Protect cells from light by incubating in the dark.\nAspirate the secondary antibody and wash three times with 1 mL 1x PBS (5 min per wash at room temperature). Wrap the plate in foil to protect cells from light and store at 4 °C.\nImage using three-channel epifluorescence microscopy.\n5. Calcium Imaging\nNOTE: If imaging at 10X magnification, standard cell culture dishes and plates are suitable for calcium imaging. Imaging at higher magnification requires that cells be plated on glass coverslips or glass bottom dishes.",
    "Aspirate medium and add 2 mL (for a 6 well plate) modified Tyrode's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, and 1% pyruvate, pH 7.4) containing 5 µM Fura-2 AM and 0.1% Pluronic F-127 to beating (D14 to D20) iCMs. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Protect cells from light to prevent quenching of fluorescent indicator.\nWash cells in 2 mL Tyrode's solution for 30 min at room temperature to allow de-esterification of Fura-2 AM.\nImage with spinning disk confocal microscopy at 340 nm and 380 nm using Slidebook 5.5 Ca2+ imaging software. Perform the imaging at room temperature.\nCalcium transients are calculated using the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm.\nIf desired, treat iCMs with 1 or 2 µM isoproterenol or 10 µM Nifedipine to manipulate calcium handling after imaging baseline calcium transients. Add compounds locally to cells and image.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
