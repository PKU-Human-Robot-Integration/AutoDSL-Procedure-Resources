    "1. Grafting Amine Functional Groups on Cellulose Paper Discs\nPrepare one piece of square paper with a dimension of 1 cm × 1 cm, and 100 paper discs made from grade No. 1 cellulose paper with a diameter of 6.0 mm (medium-flow filter paper) using a hole punch.\nTo derive -NH2 groups on the paper discs, mix 1 ml APS and 10 ml acetone in a 50 ml glass bottle in the fume hood. Add paper discs to the freshly prepared APS reagent mixture, and incubate for 5 hr with orbital stirring (200 rpm) at room temperature32.\n\tCaution: Handle APS and acetone in the fume hood.\nDecant excess solution from the 50 ml glass bottle into an organic waste container.\nAdd 10 ml of acetone to the glass bottle, mix well and decant completely to remove any unreacted APS and other impurities. Repeat this step two times.\nSpread the paper discs on the paper towel and place in a 110 °C oven for 3 hr. Allow the paper discs to cool. Store the discs in a 50 ml centrifuge tube at room temperature.\nUse Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to check the grafting of amine groups on the cellulose square paper, as described below (Figure 3A).\n\t\nTurn on the computer and open the FTIR spectroscopy instrument.\nOpen the software for FTIR spectroscopy.\nGo to 'Measurement → Initialize'. The rectangles for 'BS: KBr', 'Lamp: Infrared' and 'Laser' will turn green when the initialization is finished.\nChoose 'Data' below the rectangles, and select '%Transmittance', 'Happ-Genzel', '45', '4.0', and 'Min: 400, Max: 4000' for 'Measurement Mode', 'Apodization', 'No. of Scans', 'Resolution', and 'Range (cm-1)'.\nClick 'Measure'.\nSelect 'Data file' for the background data. Write down the comments.\nClick 'BKG' to get the baseline for the background.",
    "Fix the square paper on the film sample holder.\nSelect 'Data file' for the sample data. Write down the comments.\nClick 'Sample' to obtain the spectra for the sample.\nClose the FTIR spectroscopy application and turn off the computer.\nRepeat the above steps (steps 1.1 to 1.6) to prepare amine-functionalized grade No. 113 cellulose square paper and discs (fast-flow filter paper), and obtain the FTIR spectra for the grade No. 113 square paper (Figure 3B).\n2. Covalent Immobilization of Antibodies on Amine-functionalized Cellulose Paper Discs\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54111/54111fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Covalent immobilization of antibodies by two different methods. A. Antibodies immobilized on amine-functionalized cellulose paper discs through periodate oxidation. The carbohydrate residues were oxidized by sodium periodate to produce aldehyde functional groups. Then, the oxidized antibodies were loaded onto amine-functionalized cellulose paper discs. B. The antibodies were then immobilized on amine-functionalized cellulose paper discs through glutaraldehyde. The amine functionalized cellulose paper discs were immersed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde solution to introduce aldehyde groups to the paper discs. After washing, antibodies were loaded onto the aldehyde functionalized paper discs.

Change the volume ratio to optimize the concentration of sodium periodate and rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC.\nDilute the above antibody solution with 30 µl of 50 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4) to a final volume of 40 µl.",
    "Prepare three amine-functionalized medium-flow filter paper discs and three amine-functionalized fast-flow paper discs (as described in Section 1).\n\t\t\nLoad 5 µl of the sodium periodate oxidized rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC onto each medium-flow filter paper disc and 8 µl onto each fast-flow filter paper disc. Keep these paper discs in the dark for one hour at room temperature.\nWash each of the paper disc with 0.2 ml of washing buffer (50 mM Tris buffer with 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% surfactant, pH 7.4). Repeat the wash three times.\nPhotograph the fluorescence images through a fluorescence molecular imager to identify the presence of antibodies on each cellulose paper disc32. Use blank paper discs (treated with the same concentration of antibodies in the absence of sodium periodate) as a control (Figure S1 to Figure S3).\n\t\tNOTE: For experimental optimization, change the concentration of one parameter that needs to be optimized and fix the concentrations of all other parameters. A high fluorescence intensity increases the amount of capture antibodies that are immobilized on the cellulose paper discs.\nImmobilize antibodies on amine functionalized cellulose paper discs through glutaraldehyde (Figure 1B).\n\t\nAdd the three APS treated medium-flow filter paper discs and the three fast-flow filter paper discs (described in Section 1) to 2 ml of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) that contains 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 1 hr, with orbital stirring at room temperature.\n\t\tCaution: Handle glutaraldehyde in the fume hood.\nPlace three discs each in two 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. Add 1 ml of deionized (DI) water to each tube and shake the tubes for 10 sec. Remove the water by aspirating with a pipette. Repeat two more times to remove any unreacted glutaraldehyde.",
    "Load 5 µl of 25 µg/ml rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC (capture antibody) onto each aldehyde-functionalized medium-flow filter paper disc, and add 8 µl onto each aldehyde-functionalized fast-flow filter paper disc.

Then, add 10 µl of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) to each paper disc without removing the antibodies and incubate for 40 min for the amine aldehyde reaction.\nWash the paper discs with 0.2 ml of washing buffer on top of a paper towel. Repeat the wash two times.\nPhotograph the fluorescence images through a fluorescence molecular imager to check for the presence of antibodies on each cellulose paper disc33. Use blank paper discs as a control.\n\t\tNOTE: In Figure 4, '0' stands for the blank paper disc that was treated with the same concentration of FITC-antibody in the absence of glutaraldehyde; in Figure 5A, the blank paper discs were treated with glutaraldehyde, but no FITC-antibodies were loaded onto the paper discs.\nDry the paper discs (from Sections 2.1 and 2.2) at 37 °C for 10 min.\nBlock the paper discs with 15 µl of blocking buffer (10% skimmed milk powder in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 min at room temperature.\nLoad 5 µl and 8 µl of peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS (1:10,000) onto medium-flow and fast-flow filter paper discs, respectively. Incubate for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.\nWash the paper discs with 0.2 ml of washing buffer on top of a paper towel. Repeat the wash three times.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to remove the washing buffer as the results are not affected by the buffer.\nLoad a 10 µl mixture of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide solution onto each disc.",
    "Take images of the paper discs with a digital camera or smart phone after 5 min of incubation.\n\tNOTE: In Figure 5B, '0' stands for the paper discs that were treated with glutaraldehyde, followed by loading antibody-HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugate in the absence of FITC-antibody.\n3. Paper-based ELISA for IgG Detection\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54111/54111fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the paper-based ELISA for IgG detection. Capture antibodies were covalently immobilized on the aldehyde-functionalized cellulose paper discs through glutaraldehyde. The cellulose paper discs were blocked with blocking buffer. Target IgG was then added to the discs, followed by the loading of HRP-conjugated signal antibodies. Finally, the TMB and hydrogen peroxide mixture solution was loaded onto each paper disc for the color readout.
