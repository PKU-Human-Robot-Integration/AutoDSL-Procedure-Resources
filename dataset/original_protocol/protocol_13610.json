    "This protocol follows the guidelines at BronxCare Health System. A written informed consent is necessary from the patient.\n1. Identifying anatomical structures\nWith the patient supine, carefully palpate the knee to locate the patella and use a skin marker to make marks at the four corners of the patella.\nPlace an \"X\" using a skin marker at a site that is one fingerbreadth superolateral to the patella. Avoid infected skin and visible veins.\nIf a large effusion is detected on examination and the patella appears to be sitting on fluid, consider a medial approach just posterior to the patella.\n2. Skin sterilization\nClean the selected needle entry site with three iodine-soaked 2 x 2-inch gauze sponges.\nAllow the antiseptic to dry.\n3. Anesthetizing\nUse an 18-22 G needle to draw 1 mL of 1 percent lidocaine solution into a sterile 3 mL syringe.\nRemove that needle, and place a 5/8-inch 25 G needle on the syringe.\nApply the topical ethyl chloride stream spray to the injection site from a distance of 9 inches for 10 s.\nApproach the \"X\" with the needle and infiltrate the skin and subcutaneous tissues with a bleb of lidocaine.\nKeep the area sterile, but if contaminated by inadvertent touching, repeat steps 2.1-2.2.\n4. Arthrocentesis needle insertion\nPlace the nondominant hand over the area superomedial to the patella and gently manually compress the fluid laterally.\nInsert a 1.5-inch 18-22 G needle attached to a syringe (at least 3 mL) along the pathway that was anesthetized.\nAdvance the needle slowly and pull the plunger back gently until visualization of synovial fluid can be confirmed.\nIf the first syringe fills up and further aspirated fluid is desired, switch to another syringe.\n5. Needle removal\nRemove the needle and syringe in one smooth withdrawal motion.",
    "Place a sterile dressing over the site.\nApply pressure until any bleeding stops.\nOnce hemostasis is achieved, wipe the skin marker and iodine off with an alcohol pad.\nApply adhesive bandage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
