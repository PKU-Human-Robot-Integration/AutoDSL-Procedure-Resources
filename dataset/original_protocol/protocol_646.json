    "**Synchronous culture of HeLa S3 cells TIMING: Synchronous treatment should be performed on 1 day before chromosome preparation.**\n1. HeLa S3 cells are maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% \\(v/v) FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Usually the cells are cultured of 4 l in total using ten flasks \\(400 ml per flask).\n  \n2. Add the colcemid solution \\(final concentration of 0.1 ug/ml) to the culture at cell densities of 3-4&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml. Incubate the culture for another 16 h before harvesting.\n  \n**Isolation of metaphase chromosomes from HeLa S3 cells TIMING: 2.5-3.5 h**\n3. Separate cells from the bottom of flasks by tapping the flasks with hand and pour the 4 l of the culture into four centrifuge tubes \\(1 l each).\n  \n4. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 1,500 &#xD7;g and at 4&#xB0;C for 10 minutes in a JLA-9.1000 rotor. Remove supernatant by decantation.\n  \n5. Resuspend cells in 75 mM KCl solution. Usually cells harvested from 2 l of culture are suspended in 50 ml of the hypotinic solution in one 50 ml tube. Stand the tube\\(s) at R.T. for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 780 &#xD7;g and at 4 &#xB0;C for 10 minutes in a TS-38N rotor.\n  \n6. Remove supernatant by decantation and add 40 ml of ice-cold PA buffer per one tube. Cells should be resuspended well by tapping tube with fingers.\n  \n7. Take 40 ml of the solution, and disrupt cell membrane with a Dounce homogenizer \\(about 20 times). Repeat the same for another 40 ml.",
    "8. Mix and stir gently the solution and add PA buffer up to 90 ml and transfer the solution of 15 ml into six 50 ml tubes. Centrifuge at 440 &#xD7;g for 3 minutes in a TS-38N rotor, resulting subcellular components in the sediment and the chromosomes in the supernatant.\n  \n9. Recover 10 ml of the supernatant. For additional collection of the chromosomes, add the PA buffer to sediment fraction up to 15 ml and mix well, followed by centrifugation at 440 &#xD7;g for 3 minutes. Recover 10 ml of the supernatant again.\n  \n10. Mixture of the solution recovered at step 9 are gently laid onto four 50 ml tubes of 10 ml PA storage buffer, followed by centrifugation at 1,750 &#xD7;g and for 20 minutes in a TS-38N rotor. The PA chromosomes are recovered as slightly white band at the boundary formed between supernatant and the storage buffer. Remove the supernatant carefully by pipetting and the PA chromosomes are resuspended into the storage buffer by pipetting with a cut tip.\n  PAUSE POINT PA chromosomes can be stored at -20 &#xB0;C until use.\n**Purification of the PA chromosomes TIMING: 2.5-3.5 h**\n11. Take 10 ml of PA storage buffer containing the PA chromosomes and put the sample in a Dounce homogenizer and add 10 ml of Percoll buffer. Homogenize 10 times gently. Add another 15 ml of Percoll buffer and homogenize the sample more gently and slowly 30 times. Transfer the homogenized mixture into a centrifuge tube. Repeat the same for another 30 ml of PA storage buffer containing the PA chromosomes.",
    "12. Centrifuge the mixture at 20,000 rpm for 30 minutes in a JA-20 rotor. Usually the fraction of the PG chromosomes appears as a slightly white band located at the level that was one-fifth of the tube length measured from the bottom.\n  \n13. Recover the chromosome fraction \\(7~8 ml from each tube) and dilute it more than three-fold in wash buffer.\n  \n14. The diluted solution is gently laid onto two 50 ml tubes of 2 ml PG storage buffer, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 &#xD7;g for 20 minutes in a TS-38N rotor. Roughly remove the supernatant by pipetting and dilute the PG chromosome fraction more than three-fold in the XBE2. Lay the solution onto one 50 ml tubes of 2 ml PG storage buffer, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 &#xD7;g and for 20 min.\n  \n15. Remove the supernatant carefully by pipetting and the PG chromosomes are resuspend into the storage buffer by pipetting with a cut tip.\n  PAUSE POINT PG chromosomes can be stored at -20 &#xB0;C until use.\n**Indirect immunofluorescent staining on the isolated chromosomes TIMING: 5-6 h**\n16. Add one tenth volume of 8% PFA/XBE2 \\(final concentration of 0.8%) to the PG storage buffer containing PG chromosomes. Stand for 15 minutes at R.T. Then dilute PG storage buffer containing PG chromosomes with XBE2\n  \n17. Add the same volume of 60% sucrose/XBE2 to the fixed chromosome solution.\n  \n18. Put 150 ul of the solution into Cytofunnels set on glassslides, followed by spin at 2,000 rpm for 15 minutes with middle acceleration. The area of specimen on glassslides is circular marked with Pappen.\n  \n19. Treat specimens in 0.5 mg/ml NaBH4 in XBE2 for 5 minutes.\n  \n20. Wash the glassslides in a Coplin jar 2 times for 5 minutes with XBE2.\n  \n21. Treat specimens in 0.5% Triton X-100/XBE2 for 5 minutes.",
    "22. Wash the glassslides in a Coplin jar 2 times for 5 minutes with XBE2.\n  \n23. Treat specimens in 3% BSA/XBE2 for 30 minutes.\n  \n24. Remove the blocking solution by tilting glassslides and treat specimens in the primary antibody solution for 1 hour. Antibodies are diluted in 0.05% Tween 20/XBE2 with 1% BSA.\n  \n25. Wash the glassslides in a Coplin jar 3 times for 5 minutes each with XBE2.\n  \n26. Treat specimens in the secondary antibody solution for 1 hour. Antibodies are diluted in 0.05% Tween 20/XBE2 with 1% BSA.\n  \n27. Wash the glassslides in a Coplin jar 3 times for 5 minutes each with XBE2.\n  \n28. Mount specimens in 1 ug/ml DAPI/Vectashield, and seal coverslips with nail-polish."
