    "Culture A. tumefaciens carrying pUBC-UBP12-CFP, pUBC-H3.3-CFP (as a control) or p19 in 3 ml of liquid LB in 15 ml screw cap tubes separately for 20 h at 28 °C.Centrifuge the culture in 2 ml microtubes at 1,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature, discard the supernatant and then suspend the A. tumefaciens pellet in infiltration medium by adjusting OD600 to 1.0. Combine the same amount (usually 1 ml) of pUBC-UBP12-CFP or pUBC-H3.3-CFP with (1 ml) p19 culture in a 2 ml microtube.Note: The p19 construct can increase expression of transgenes in transfected N. benthamiana cells. Without p19 expression, transfected N. benthamiana cells often silence transgenes resulting in low and variable expression. Presence of p19 partially blocks RNA silencing and thus establishes higher and more uniform transgene expression making the presented assay more sensitive and more reproducible.Place the microtube horizontally for 2 h at room temperature.Use a needle to punch some holes in the abaxial (lower) side of 3 to 4 N. benthamiana leaves and infiltrate the A. tumefaciens culture with a 5 ml syringe.Between 48 h and 72 h after infiltration, the area of the infiltrated tobacco leaves near the holes is cut into pieces of about 1 x 1 cm using scissors and fixed in 10 ml of Tris buffer containing 4% formaldehyde in 50 ml screw cap tubes on ice for 20 min (operate in a laminar hood to avoid exposure to formaldehyde). Pour off the Tris buffer and wash the sample twice with 20 ml of ice-cold Tris buffer each for 10 min.Chop the leaves with a razor blade in 400 μl of LB01 buffer in a Petri dish on ice to release the nuclei.Filter the suspension through CellTrics® into a new 1.5 ml microtube.",
    "Pipet 5 to 10 μl of the suspension onto a microscopic slide and air-dry the suspension (about 5 to 10 min) (Note 1).Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer containing 4% formaldehyde onto the slides to postfix the nuclei for 30 min at room temperature (operate in a laminar hood to avoid exposure to formaldehyde), then lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer by absorbent paper (Note 2).Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer onto the slides to cover the nuclei for rinsing 5 min, then lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer by absorbent paper, repeat once.Permeabilize the cells with 100 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 (diluted in PBS buffer) for 5 min, then lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer by absorbent paper.Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer onto the slides to rinse the samples, then lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer by absorbent paper, repeat 3-4 times.Apply sufficient volume (20-100 μl) of Image-iTTM FX signal enhancer to cover nuclei. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature in a humid incubator (Notes 3 and 4).Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer onto the slides, then lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer by absorbent paper.Antibody detection: Mix 1 μl of anti-H2Aub or anti-H4 (as a negative control) with 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS buffer, pipet the solution on the slides, and incubate in a humid incubator at 37 °C for 2 h (Note 4). Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer onto the slides to rinse the nuclei at room temperature three times, each for 10 min. Lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer with absorbent paper each time.",
    "Mix 5 μl of Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody with 1 ml of 1% BSA in PBS buffer, pipet the solution onto the slides and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Pipette 100 μl of PBS buffer onto the slides at room temperature three times, each for 10 min. Lean the slides and absorb the PBS buffer with absorbent paper each time.Pipette VECTASHIELD® mounting medium with 1 μg/ml DAPI onto microscopic slides and cover with cover slips.Observe nuclei (DAPI), CFP signal and antibody signal under a confocal microscope such as a ZEISS LSM 780 using appropriate excitation wavelength. DAPI is excited by the 405 nm laser line; CFP is detected by the 485 nm laser line, while antibody is excited by the 555 nm laser line. DAPI shows the position of nuclei and CFP labels nuclei from transfected cells. Check several fields (about 50 nuclei) and compare the difference when infiltrating N. benthamiana leaves with A. tumefaciens carrying pUBC-UBP12-CFP or pUBC-H3.3-CFP. Figure 1 shows examples of microscopic detection of transfected nuclei and immunocytochemistry for the analyzed histone posttranslational modification (PTM; here, H2Aub). We found that H2Aub signals significantly decreased in cells expressing UBP12 compared to control cells expressing H3.3 (Figure 1A). In contrast, H4 signals did not differ significantly when UBP12 or H3.3 were expressed in N. benthamiana leaves (Figure 1B), implying deubiquitination activity of UBP12. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227000021_4021.jpgFigure 1. Examples of assay results–UBP12 has deubiquitinase activity. A. Infiltration of pUBC-UBP12-CFP but not of pUBC-H3.3-CFP reduced H2A ubiquitylation in N. benthamiana leaves. B. Infiltration of either pUBC-H3.3-CFP or pUBC-UBP12-CFP did not affect H4 signals in N. benthamiana leaves. Scale bars = 30 µm."
