  "procedures": [
    "All the procedures presented here have been performed in agreement with the European Community Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (010/63/UE) and our local ethics committee (Comité d'éthique en matière d'expérimentation animale number 59, 'Paris Centre et Sud', project #2017-23). Adult mice (male C57BL/6 Rj, age 2-3 months, 20-30 g, from Janvier Labs, France) were housed 4 per cage with a 12h light/dark cycle, constant temperature at 22 °C and food and water ad libitum. Before the beginning of the experiments, animals are given a one-week minimum acclimatization period to housing conditions.\n1. Animal preparation for anesthetized fUS imaging\nAnesthesia\n\t\nWeigh the mouse.\nPrepare a mixture of ketamine and xylazine at 10 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively, in sterile saline. Administer 0.2 mL of the ketamine/xylazine solution intraperitoneally using a 26 gauge needle and 1 mL disposable syringe. After a few minutes, position the animal onto the stereotaxic frame, making sure that the head is flat.\nAdminister a second volume of anesthetics to reach a total dose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine (taking the initial dose into account).\n\t\tNOTE: Anesthesia should last for 1 h. To maintain a steady sedation for a longer time, inject 0.05 mL of the ketamine/xylazine mixture every 30 min intraperitoneally.\nAnimal preparation for anesthetized imaging session\nApply some eye ointment (e.g., Ocry-Gel) to the mouse eyes to avoid any cataract formation during the imaging session. Shave the mouse head using a trimmer. Apply some depilatory cream and rinse after a couple of minutes. Repeat until the hair is completely removed.\nInsert subcutaneous pins in the limbs for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Place centrifuged ultrasound gel (1500 rpm, 5 min) on the head.",
    "Monitor the depth of anesthesia during the complete duration of the experiments (anesthesia induction included). Maintain the temperature of the animals at 37 °C by using a heating blanket coupled to a rectal probe.\nMonitor the following physiological parameters which are indirect indicators of the depth of anesthesia: Heart rate (220-250 beats per minute - monitored through the electrocardiogram thin electrodes implanted subcutaneously), and Respiratory rate (130-140 breaths per minute - monitored using a spirometer connected to the ECG acquisition system).\n\t\t​NOTE: A description of the experimental setup is depicted in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62267/62267fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental setup for anesthetized fUS experiments. Description of the experimental setup showing all the scientific equipment needed during an anesthetized experiment. 1.

Animal preparation for awake head-fixed mice experiments\nHeadplate surgery",
    "Place the anesthetized animal (steps 1.1-1.2) in the stereotaxic frame on a heating pad (37 °C). Apply protective gel for the eyes and administer lidocaine s.c. (0.2 mL, 2 %) under the scalp skin using a 26-gauge needle and wait a few minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: Monitor the anesthesia level every 10-30 min by response (absence of) to a firm toe pinch.\nPerform an incision following the sagittal suture from behind the occipital bone to the beginning of the nasal bone. Using surgical scissors, excise the skin over both hemispheres.\nClean the skull with 1% iodine solution and remove any remaining periosteum. Using the headplate as a template, drill two holes (1 mm diameter) in the skull to position the anchoring screws.\n\t\tCAUTION: Be careful not to drill completely through the skull to avoid any brain damages or dura inflammation\nPosition the headplate with the screws. Use dental cement to fix the screws and the headplate in front and in the back of the frame to maintain good grip of the implant.\n\t\t​CAUTION: Be careful to not apply cement inside the frame window as it greatly diminishes signal quality. Cover the skull with a thin layer of surgical glue to protect the bone and seal the wounds on the side of the imaging window.\nRemove the animal from the stereotaxic frame after the cement is dry and reverse the anesthesia by a subcutaneous injection of atipamezole at 1 mg/kg. A prophylactic administration of meloxicam (5 mg/kg/day, s.c.) is administered for post-operative pain.",
    "Place the animal in a recovery cage on a heating pad (37 °C). The mouse can return its home cage with littermates within a few hours. Place a magnetic 3D-printed cap (polyactic acid material with magnet inserts) over the headplate for protection (Figure 2A). Leave the mouse to recover for 4 to 6 days before the beginning of the habituation to the mobile home cage (MHC).\n\t\tNOTE: The total weight of the cap and the headplate is 2.8 g.\nHandling and habituation\n\t\nOn day 1 post-recovery (PR), gently hold the mouse in hand for 5-10 min several times a day.\nOn day 2 PR, repeat handling as in day 1 and leave the animal for 5-10 min exploring freely MHC.\n\t\t​NOTE: Playing some background music in the room can help reduce animal's stress.\nOn day 3 PR, let the animal freely explore the MHC for 5-10 min. Afterwards, carefully grab the headplate and gently place it in the clamp, moving manually the carbon cage to accompany the mouse. Habituate the animal in the head-fixed position for 5-10 min. Clean the MHC in between training sessions with 70% ethanol solution and rinse with tap water.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure that the MHC receives a sufficient air flow as recommended by the manufacturer. The height of the head clamp needs to be manually adjusted to provide a comfortable position.\nOn day 4 and 5 PR, repeatedly clamp the mouse MHC and gradually increase the head-fixed time, starting from 5 min and up to 30 min. Apply some saline and ultrasound gel on the imaging window to habituate.\nOn day 6 PR, repeat the protocol from day 4/5 PR and position the probe above the animal's head following step 3.1.",
    "On the day of the experiment, proceed as described above. Then, humidify the imaging window with saline and apply some ultrasound gel. Start the tracking of the animal and proceed to the probe positioning (see below).\n\t\tNOTE: Clamping in the MHC may also be done by wrapping the mouse in a rag. In that case, mice need to be habituated to the wrapping procedure before head-fixation. A description of a complete experimental setup for awake imaging is provided in Figure 2B.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62267/62267fig2v2.jpg",

The Servo-Motor is controlled by an Arduino Uno card which is interfaced with the Iconeus One system through TTL signal (1) in order to synchronize stimulation patterns with imaging sequences. C. Illustration of the different spatial sampling possibilities (created with BioRender.com): in each case, the probe is stepped from the first position to the last one and a Doppler image is recorded at each position to reconstruct the stacked volume. This process is continuously repeated during the whole acquisition time. Dense Scan (left): the step between slices must be small enough (typically 400 µm, which corresponds to the elevation resolution) to allow volumetric imaging.",
    "Sparse Scan (right): if distant functional regions are targeted (at different positions), it is also possible to decrease spatial sampling to image different slices that intersect these regions while not compromising the temporal sampling. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62267/62267fig2v2large.jpg]",
    "3. Probe positioning\nStart the software (e.g., IcoScan) and create an experiment session. Go to the Move Probe menu to adjust the position of the ultrasound probe using the navigation keyboard.\n\tNOTE: The probe should be positioned approximately 1 mm above the animal's head. It is crucial to ensure that the probe is in contact with ultrasound gel before starting any imaging sequence.\nStart the Live View acquisition and adjust probe position if needed via real time imaging of the animal CBV (cerebral blood volume). Align the brain at the center of the image. Optimize the imaging parameters to capture the highest signal-to-noise ratio.\n\tNOTE: In awake mice experiments, the aperture size needs to be reduced to avoid artefacts induced by lateral muscles contraction.\n4. Angiographic scan and atlas registration\nOpen the Angio 3D option in the acquisition software. On the preset panel, adjust the scanning parameters (first slice, last slice and step size) in order to scan the whole brain (Figure 3A, B), and start the acquisition.\n\tNOTE: When setting up the scan parameters, make sure that the scan will cover the posterior part of the brain\nLeave the acquisition software open and start the software for data analysis and visualization (e.g., IcoStudio), and load the angio 3D scan. Navigate through the acquisition volume using the 3-views panel and select the Coronal Scan Direction: antero-posterior or postero-anterior.\nGo to the Brain Registration Panel. Load the mouse reference template that will be needed for the registration process. Register the scan on the Allen Mouse Common Coordinates Framework using the fully automatic or the manual registration modes (Figure 3C).",
    "Check the result by looking at the superposition of the angio 3D scan and the reference template or by looking at the superposition of the scan and the Allen reference atlas using the Atlas Manager panel (Figure 3D). Save the registration as a .bps file.\n\tNOTE: The registration file can be reused for any other acquisition performed during the same experiment session.\n5. Brain Positioning System (BPS)\nIn the IcoStudio software, make sure that the angiographic scan and its .bps file (generated in step 4.4) are loaded.\nGo to the Brain Navigation Panel. In the Atlas Manager panel, navigate through the mouse Allen brain atlas with the parent/child tree navigator. Find the anatomical targeted regions and select them to superimpose them to your scan in the 3-views.\nVisualize the targeted regions in the 3-view panel and choose an imaging plane that overlaps the targeted regions for the experiment. To do so, manually set two markers on the coronal position that includes the regions of interest.\nClick on Brain Positioning System (BPS) to extract the resulting motor coordinates. These coordinates correspond to the probe position which allows to image the targeted plane. Check the preview of the image which is computed from the angio scan.\nIn the IcoScan software, enter the Probe positioning panel and click on Enter BPS coordinates. Apply the coordinates given in step 5.4. The probe moves and aligns on the targeted imaging plane.\nPerform a live view acquisition and check that the current imaging plane corresponds to the prediction given in step 5.4.\n\t​NOTE: It is also possible to select parasagittal/non orthogonal planes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62267/62267fig3v2.jpg",

Task-evoked experiment: whisker stimulation\nPredefine the stimulation sequence, including time of stimulation, inter-stimulation time and number of repetitions.\nRun a 3D fUS sequence by defining the total time of acquisition, the number of positions as well as the dead-time between positions. In case of automatic stimulation synchronized with the acquisition system through TTL input, select the Trig-IN option before starting the acquisition.",
    "NOTE: For the results presented in this work, stimulation was delivered using cotton swab positioned such as to allow deflection of most of the whiskers in the dorsal/ventral direction. It was fixed on a servo-motor driven by an Arduino UNO card, linked to the Iconeus One system to ensure synchronization. The recommended parameters for stimulation are 30 s ON, 30 s OFF, amplitude of 20° and 4 Hz frequency. Alternatively, the stimulation can also be delivered manually by deflecting the whiskers at the defined times during the acquisition.\nOpen the acquisition in IcoStudio software and enter the Activation map menu. Fill the activation pattern field with start and end times and compute the activation map. Adjust the display parameters for visualization. Export the activation map as a .h5 file for off-line analysis.\n\t​NOTE: Activation is estimated using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach with the stimulus convolved by a default mouse hemodynamic response (HRF). Alternatively, activation can be visualized directly by estimating the Pearson correlation between the stimulation pattern and the hemodynamic signal from each voxel.\n7. 4D functional connectivity\nRun a 3D fUS sequence by defining the total time of acquisition, the number of imaging plane positions as well as the dead-time between positions.\n\tNOTE: For 4D functional connectivity, we recommend acquisition time between each volume < 2.5 s (sampling frequency of at least 0.4 Hz) and a total acquisition time of at least 10 min (number of time points > 180).\nSave the acquisition and load it in the IcoStudio software. If necessary, load the .bps file and the Allen mouse brain coordinate framework. In the Atlas manager, select regions of the atlas as regions of interest (ROI).",
    "Enter the Functional Connectivity menu and select the desired regions in the ROI manager. Visualize the results as connectivity matrix (supervised analysis) or seed-based correlation map (unsupervised). Select and adjust the bandwidth filters as desired and export correlation results for statistical analysis.\n\tNOTE: In 3D fUS imaging mode, the relative probe positions are set manually. Hence, two types of scans are possible and can be chosen depending on the functional application: dense scans versus sparse scans (Figure 2C)."
