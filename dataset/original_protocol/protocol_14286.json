  "procedures": [
    "Placentae are collected from healthy term, not in labor women undergoing elective cesarean sections. The Collection, processing, and disposable of human samples adhere to the guidelines of the Mount Sinai Hospital Ethics board. A written consent is obtained from each patient. This study is approved by the Research Ethics Board at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n1. Preparations\nNOTE: All steps must be conducted under a fume hood and all surgical equipment must be sterilized via autoclave prior to placement in the fume hood. All other materials (bottles, 50 mL tubes, etc.) must be sterilized with 70% ethanol solution. Always wear personal protective equipment at all times when working with biohazardous waste (lab coat, gloves, long hair tied back, etc.).\nEnzymatic digestion solution (Final solution: 200 mL)\nPipette 180 mL of HBSS-/- into a 500 mL beaker, add sterile stirring magnet and place on stirring plate at room temperature.\nWeigh out and add the following to the HBSS-/- solution slowly and sequentially: 20 mL of FBS, 400 mg Collagenase 2 ([final] = 2 mg/mL), 20 mg Soy bean trypsin inhibitor ([final] = 0.1mg/mL), 30 mg DNase 1 ([final] = 0.15 mg/mL), and 200 mg BSA ([final] = 1 mg/mL)\nSet the stirring to medium speed, and allow the mixture to stir for 10-20 min (cover with tin foil or paraffin film while stirring).\nPour the mixed solution into a 250 mL glass bottle using a plastic funnel and place in the fume hood.\nPass the solution through a plastic top filtration unit (0.22 μm membrane filter, 500 mL), aliquot 20 mL into 50 mL tubes (10 tubes total) and store at -20 °C until use.\nRPMI 1640 Media (2% washing solution and 10% complete growth medium)\nCombine RPMI 1640 and FBS in a glass bottle in the fume hood.",
    "For 2% FBS solution, combine 490 mL of RPMI 1640 and 10 mL FBS.\nFor 10% FBS solution, combine 450 mL RPMI 1640 and 50 mL FBS.\nPipette 500 μL of normocin into the 500 mL glass bottle from the previous step containing RPMI media and FBS (50 mg/mL stock, 0.05 mg/mL working concentration).\nPass media through a 0.22 μm membrane filter and store in a 500 mL glass bottle at 4 °C until use.\n30 min prior to starting the experiment, place a 20 mL aliquot of frozen enzymatic digestion solution in a 37 °C bead bath, place the 2% FBS and the 10% FBS RPMI 1640 media in a 37 °C bead bath, turn on the rocking water bath and set to 37 °C, 2 g, and set a temperature controlled centrifuge to 4 °C.\n2. Collection of Decidual Tissue from Term Placental Membranes\nPlace bottles with HBSS+/+, HBSS-/- and five 50 mL tubes in a rack under the fume hood. Pipette 25 mL of HBSS+/+ in one tube.\nUsing gloved hands, take the term placenta out from the container used for transporting it from the operating room theatre. Place the placenta on the diaper pad (maternal side up) and spread the fetal membranes out using scissors and forceps.\nLay overlapping diaper pads on the fume hood.\nUse a separate diaper to flip the placenta so the maternal side is face up.\nFind the point of membrane rupture and make incisions to allow the membrane to unfold and lay flat on the fumehood surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Once the membrane is pulled back from the placenta, the decidua will be face up resting on the chorion layer, with the amnion layer at the back.",
    "Using a plastic cell scraper, carefully scrape the decidual tissue off the chorion and place in the 50 mL tube containing 25 mL HBSS+/+.\nScrape the membrane with moderate pressure. Do not apply too much pressure as it may result in chorion contamination. Collect small blood clots as well, as these contain some decidual cells.\n\tCaution: After decidual collection, placenta must be packaged in a biohazard plastic bin and frozen in a -20 °C freezer prior to appropriate disposal (according to your institutional rules). Bloody diaper pads must be wrapped in a seal-tight plastic bag and disposed of in a biohazard safety box.\n3. Washing and Enzymatic Digestion of the Decidual Tissue\nWash the collected tissues by gently shaking the 50 mL tube by hand and passing it through a 250 μm metal sieve (250 μm, size 60 mesh) resting over a sterile specimen (urine) container.\nRepeat the wash twice with HBSS+/+ and twice with HBSS-/- in fresh tubes for each wash. (final washes with HBSS-/- allows for the removal of calcium and magnesium present in HBSS+/+, which would otherwise interfere with the following enzymatic digestion process).\n\tNOTE. During the washing steps, chorion tissue contamination will be apparent as the decidual tissue is light pink in color and amorphous, while the chorion is white, dense, and stringy. Therefore, chorion contamination can be easily removed with forceps.\nOptionally, if the decidual tissue is thick, transfer it to a sterile 10 cm diameter petri dish and proceed to mince of the tissue with two opposing scalpels in the dish.\nPlace the washed tissue in sterile 50 mL tube containing 100 mg of tissue/mL of enzymatic digestion solution (see Preparations).\nAs a reference point, ensure that the level of decidual tissue reaches the 5-10 mL mark on the 50 mL tube.",
    "Use approximately 20 mL of enzymatic digestion solution (Prepared in step 1.1) to digest the total decidua collected from a whole term fetal membrane.\nSeal the cap of the tube with the paraffin film (seal the tube tightly and wrap paraffin film around the cap and top of the tube) under the culture hood and incubate decidual tissue at 37 °C for 20 min in a shaking water bath (145 rpm, 2 g).\nAfter incubation, remove the paraffin film and sterilize the surface of the tube containing digested tissue with 70% ethanol and bring under the fume hood. Shake the tube briefly by hand.\nCollect cell suspension through the metal sieve (250 μm, size 60 mesh) into a new sterile specimen container. Dilute with an equal volume (20 mL) of RPMI + 10% FBS containing 0.1% normocin to stop enzymatic reaction. Proceed directly to centrifugation step 4.1.\nIf necessary, place the remaining undigested tissue back into a new 50 mL tube with 20 mL of fresh enzymatic digestion solution and repeat digestion (20 min, 37 °C, shaking water bath).\nIf a second digestion is necessary, place the first tube with cell suspension on ice (cover with paraffin film to keep sterile). Repeat steps 3.5-3.6 and combine the two cells suspensions.\n4. Generating a Single Cell Suspension\nCentrifuge the cell suspension (420 g, 4 °C, 11 min).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 40 mL of RPMI + 2% FBS containing 0.1% normocin (\"wash buffer\").\n\tNOTE: Cell pellet will be loose and gelatinous due to red blood cell contamination, aspirate supernatant with caution. Removal of the upper phase with a manual pipette may be required.\nRepeat the centrifugation at 420 g at 4 °C for 11 min.",
    "Carefully remove the supernatant (As mentioned in Note Step 4.2) and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of wash buffer and add 35 mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer in the same tube.\n\tNOTE: If the pellet is large or very bloody, it can be split into two tubes for the erythrocyte lysis step by adding 10 mL of wash buffer and dividing equally into two tubes and then adding 35 mL of Erythrocyte lysis buffer to each tube.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min. Briefly vortex tube(s) at the beginning and the end of the incubation to lyse the red blood cells.\nCentrifuge at 420 g for 11 mins at 4 °C.\nCarefully, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 40 mL of wash buffer.\nPass the cells through a 70 μm nylon filter to remove cell clumps.\nCentrifuge at 420 g for 11 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of complete medium (RPMI 10% + FBS containing 0.1% normocin).\nCount cells using the trypan blue dye-exclusion hemocytometer procedure as described below:\nUnder the culture hood gently pipette cell suspension up and down 3x in order to thoroughly mix before combining with trypan blue. In a 1.5 mL tube prepare cell suspension, diluted 1:2 (combine 20 μL of trypan blue solution and 20 μL of decidual cell suspension). Carefully mix trypan blue-cell solution by pipetting up and down a couple of times (this solution is not sterile).\nPlace the hemocytometer on the stage of the microscope with glass coverslip on top.",
    "NOTE: Hemocytometer is a microscope slide with grids on it to give nine large squares divided by triple lines. Each large square has an area of 1 mm2, and the depth of fluid in the chamber is 0.1 mm. Therefore, the volume of fluid that can fill each large square is 1 mm*1 mm*0.1 mm= 0.1 mm3= 10-4 mL.\nSlowly add 10 μL of the trypan blue-cell mixture into the groove of the hemocytometer, allowing capillary action to disperse the cell mixture over the entire slide (stop before mixture fills well).\nView the cells under a microscope (at 10X magnification) and count all white/green cells that exclude trypan blue (these are the viable cells) in the four large outer squares of the hemocytometer. When counting cells that touch the line, count only those that touch the right and upper lines but not those touching the left and bottom lines. Do not count dark blue cells; blue color indicates that the cell is dead as trypan blue dye can easily penetrate through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm.\nTo calculate the number of viable cells in 1 mL of cell suspension (X):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57443/57443eq1v2.jpg\n\t\t2 = dilution factor\n\t\t10,000 = conversion factor (1 mL = 1 cm3 = 10,000*0.1 mm3)\nDilute decidual cells to a desirable final concentration in RPMI + 10% FBS (growth medium).\n\tNOTE: For tissue culture plating, pipette 2*106 cells/well into a plastic 6-well plate, 10*106 cells into a 10-cm plastic plate or 75,000 cells to a glass coverslip.\nSubscription Required.
