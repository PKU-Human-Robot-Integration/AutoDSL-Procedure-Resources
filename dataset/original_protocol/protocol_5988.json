    "Vesicle preparationDissolve the lipids in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Prepare aliquots of 100 μl in 13 x 100 mm glass tubes and dry under nitrogen current to obtain a lipid film. Keep the film under vacuum in a speed-vac for 6-8 h.Make a suspension of phospholipids at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 1 ml of medium buffer at the appropriate pH value.Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h in a water bath incubator without shaking and vortex vigorously every 10 min.Sonicate the suspension for 10 min in a bath sonicator at a frequency of 40 kHz and subject to 15 cycles of extrusion in an extruder apparatus using 100 nm polycarbonate filters. For a successful extrusion process, avoid the formation of bubbles in the lipid suspension when inserting it into the syringe and squeeze the syringe plunger carefully and slowly.It is recommended to prepare the lipid vesicles just before carrying out an experiment, although they may be stored for 1-2 days at 4 °C.After vesicle preparation, the exact phospholipid concentration is calculated based on the phosphorus content determined according to Bartlett (1959). Aggregation studiesAdd different amounts (between 10 and 100 μl) of a 15-20 μM stock solution of the E2661 recombinant protein (see Gómez-Gutiérrez et al., 2018) to 50 μl of recently prepared lipid vesicles and the needed amount of medium buffer at the appropriate pH to reach a total volume of 500 μl. After gently mixing the solutions in 10 x 75 mm glass tubes, the final phospholipid and protein concentrations must be 0.14 mM and in the range of 0.2-3.5 μM, respectively. Use controls of lipid vesicles in the absence of protein and of protein in the absence of lipid.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h in a water bath incubator without shaking.Measure the optical density at 360 nm (OD360) on a spectrophotometer, using a 1 x 0.2 cm absorption cuvette.Lipid mixing assayNote: This protocol is adapted from that described in Struck et al. (1981). This method measures the decrease in efficiency of the fluorescence energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor incorporated into liposomes, as a consequence of lipid mixing.Prepare two different kinds of phospholipid vesicles: (1a) labeled vesicles containing 1 mol% NBD-PE and 0.6 mol% Rh-PE and (1b) unlabeled vesicles. An example of labeled vesicle (1a) preparation would be as follows: dissolve NBD-PE and Rh-PE in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in separate glass tubes; mix in a glass tube 10 μl and 6 μl of, respectively, NBD-PE and Rh-PE solutions with 100 μl of a solution of unlabeled phospholipid in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and operate according to Procedure A. For (1b), directly operate according to Procedure A. All the vesicle suspensions are prepared at a final lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml in medium buffer at the appropriate pH value.Mix labeled (1a) and unlabeled (1b) liposomes in a 1:9 molar proportion, maintaining the final lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml in a total volume of 1 ml. This mixed vesicle preparation is diluted ten times (100 μl + 900 μl of medium buffer) to a final concentration of 0.14 mM for lipid mixing assays.Add different amounts (between 5 and 100 μl) of protein from a 15-30 μM stock solutions in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, NaCl 100 mM. The final protein concentration must be in the range of 0.1-3 μM. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h in a water bath incubator without shaking.",
    "Record the emission spectra (wavelength range 480-620 nm) in a 1 x 0.4 cm fluorescence cuvette with the excitation wavelength set at 450 nm, in an SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorometer. Set the excitation and emission slits at 4 nm. In order to minimize dispersive interference, keep constant the excitation and emission polarizers at 90° and 0° respectively.Use the ratio of the emission intensities at 530 and 590 nm to calculate the efficiency of FRET (%FRET) together with the appropriate calibration curve. This curve is obtained by using labeled vesicles containing 1 mol% NBD-PE and variable concentrations of Rh-PE (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1 and 1.3 mol%), according to the equation:%FRET = [1 - (F/F0)] x 100where,F is the fluorescence intensity at 530 nm of vesicles containing 1% NBD-PE and 0-1% Rh-PE.F0 is the fluorescence intensity at 530 nm of vesicles containing 1% NBD-PE and 0% Rh-PE.Release of aqueous contentsNote: This protocol is adapted from that described in Ellens et al. (1985). The assay is based on the dequenching of ANTS fluorescence caused by its dilution upon release of the aqueous contents of a vesicle preparation containing both ANTS and DPX.The fluorophore ANTS and the quencher DPX must be co-encapsulated at a concentration of 12.5 and 45 mM respectively in either PG or PC phospholipid vesicles. For that purpose, weigh 13.4 mg of ANTS and 47.5 mg of DPX and dissolve in 2.5 ml of medium buffer at the appropriate pH value.Add 2 ml of this solution to a lipid film (prepared according to Procedure A1) containing 2 mg of the appropriate phospholipid. Hydrate the film at 37 °C for 1 h in a water bath incubator without shaking, and sonicate for 30 min in a bath sonicator.Subject the vesicles to five cycles of freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen.",
    "Extrude the vesicles at least 15 times through 100 nm polycarbonate filters (Avestin) by using an extruder apparatus.Remove the non-encapsulated material by passing the sample through a Sephadex G-75 column using medium buffer at the appropriate pH value for elution. A typical column with 12-15 ml bed volume is prepared by swelling 1 g of dry Sephadex G75 in 20 ml of medium buffer for 24 h. After swelling is complete, decant supernatant, add buffer and degas the suspension. For packing, pour the complete slurry into a glass column of 1-1.5 cm diameter. Run chromatography with a 1 ml/min flow rate, and collect 1 ml fractions. The encapsulated material elutes in the void volume in fractions with high turbidity, and therefore is detected by measuring the optical density at 360 nm of each fraction in a spectrophotometer, whereas the non-encapsulated free dyes elute in the column volume. Dilute the encapsulated vesicles to a final phospholipid concentration in the assay of 0.14 mM.Add different amounts of a stock solution (15-20 μM) of E2661 recombinant protein to 0.8 ml of the diluted phospholipid vesicle suspension. The final protein concentration must be in the range of 0.1-3 μM. Use a 1 x 0.4 cm fluorescence cuvette to record the increase of the fluorescence emission at 520 nm upon excitation at 385 nm in a thermostated cell holder at 37 °C. Set the excitation and emission slits at 4 nm. In order to minimize dispersive interference, keep constant the excitation and emission polarizers at 90° and 0° respectively.Set the fluorescence scale to 100% by addition of 40 μl of 10% Triton X-100 (final concentration: 0.5% Triton) to 0.8 ml of the diluted phospholipid vesicle suspension and to 0% by measuring the fluorescence of 0.8 ml of the control, diluted, phospholipid vesicles.",
    "For each protein concentration, the parameter % Fmax is calculated according to the following equation:% Fmax = [(Fprot - F0)/( Fmax - F0)] x 100where,-Fprot is the fluorescence intensity at 520 nm after the addition of E2 protein.-F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity at 520 nm, before addition of the protein (0%).-Fmax is the fluorescence intensity at 520 nm after addition of Triton X-100 (100%).Fluorescence polarization measurementsPrepare DMPG or DMPC phospholipid vesicles labeled with the fluorescent probes DPH or TMA-DPH. The probe/phospholipid weight ratio is 1:500 for DPH and 1:100 for TMA-DPH. An example of labeled vesicle preparation would be as follows: use two glass tubes to dissolve DPH in tetrahydrofuran and TMA-DPH in methanol; at a concentration of 1 mg/ml; mix in glass tubes 2 μl of DPH (or 10 μl of TMA-DPH) solution with 100 μl of a solution of the synthetic phospholipid (DMPG or DMPC) in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and operate according to Procedure A. All the vesicle suspensions are prepared at a final lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml in medium buffer at the appropriate pH value.Incubate labeled vesicles in the absence or in the presence of E2661 recombinant protein at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath incubator without shaking at a final lipid concentration of 0.14 mM and protein/lipid molar ratios of 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100. As an example, for a total volume of 400 μl, pipette 40 μl of labeled vesicles suspension, 20-100 μl of a 28 μM stock solution of E2 protein, and the needed amount of medium buffer at the appropriate pH to reach a total volume of 400 μl. After this incubation, cool the samples to 10 ºC.Adjust the excitation and emission slit widths of the spectrofluorometer at 4 nm.",
    "Set the excitation wavelength at 365 nm and measure the emission at 425 nm after equilibration of the samples for 10 min at the required temperature. The temperature in the 1 x 0.2 cm fluorescence cuvette is maintained in the thermostated cell holder with a circulating water bath. The fluorescence polarization value is directly provided by the apparatus and is calculated using the spectrofluorometer software according to the following equation:P (polarization) = (IVV – IVH)/(IVV + IVH)where, IVV and IVH are, respectively, the vertical and horizontal fluorescence intensities when the sample is excited with the excitation polarizer oriented vertically."
