Workflow for site-specific in vivo photo-crosslinking combined with BMB-crosslinking\nInoculate a small amount of glycerol cell stock of RM3655/pNB91/pEVOL-pBpF carrying pRM829 or pRM831 into 1.5 mL of L medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) Glucose, 50 μg/mL Amp, 20 μg/mL Cm, and 50 μg/mL Spc in a sterile test tube.\nShake it overnight (≈16 h) at 30°C.\nInoculate 50 μL of the overnight culture into 5 mL of L medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL Amp, 20 μg/mL Cm, 50 μg/mL Spc, 0.5 mM pBPA, and 0.02% arabinose.\nShake at 30°C for 105 min until the optical density reached ≈0.16 (corresponding to about 1.5 × 108 cells/mL) with TAITEC OD Monitor.\nNote: Arabinose is included to induce the expression of the evolved aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/suppressor tRNA pair from pEVOL-pBpF.\nAdd 5 μL of 1 M IPTG in MilliQ H2O (final concentration 1 mM) to express LptD and BepA, and shake for 3 h at 30°C. The final optical density of the cultures after induction would be ≈0.8–0.85 (corresponding to about 7.5–8.0 × 108 cells/mL) with TAITEC OD Monitor.\nPut test tubes on ice to cool the cultures.\nBMB-crosslinking\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this step (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 2), cells expressing the target protein are treated with BMB to crosslink the two proteins (LptD and BamA).",
    "Take an appropriate volume of the culture to a 5 mL centrifuge tube (Take 5 mL when final turbidity is ≈0.8 with TAITEC OD Monitor, which corresponds to about 7.5 × 108 cells/mL).\nCentrifuge the tube (2,300 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells in 500 μL of Phosphate Buffer.\nCentrifuged the tube (2,300 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells in 500 μL of Phosphate Buffer.\nAdd 10 μL of 100 mM TCEP-HCl (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine Hydrochloride dissolved in MilliQ H2O) at a final concentration of 2 mM.\nMix vigorously at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20 min using High Speed Mixer CM-1000 (EYELA) to reduce the introduced Cys residues in LptD and BamA.\nCritical: This step is important to make the Cys residues for BMB-crosslinking in a reduced form.\nCentrifuge the tube (2,300 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells in 500 μL of Phosphate Buffer.\nCentrifuge the tube (2,300 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells in 500 μL of Phosphate Buffer.\nDivide the solution into 125 μL portions in four 1.5 mL tubes. Two tubes are used for the BMB reaction and the rest for the DMSO control reaction.\nAdd 3.1 μL of DMSO (control) or 20 mM BMB in DMSO (final concentration 0.5 mM).\nMix vigorously at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 40 min with High Speed Mixer CM-1000.\nAdd 12.5 μL of 100 mM L-Cysteine (final concentration 10 mM), and mix well.\nNote: L-Cysteine quenches BMB and stops the crosslinking reaction.\nPut the samples on ice for several minutes.\nCombine the two separate BMB-treated and -untreated solutions into one tube, respectively.\npBPA mediated in vivo photo-crosslinking\nTiming: 2 h",
    "After the BMB-crosslinking, irradiate the cells with UV light to form pBPA-crosslinking and ternary crosslinked complexes (BamA-LptD-BepA; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 3).\nPut a 150 μL portion of the cultures on Split Petri Dish 4 Sections (VWR) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2542-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Detailed operations for in vivo photo-crosslinking experiments\n(A) How to put the culture medium on Split Petri Dish 4 Sections (step 24).\n(B) UV irradiation using B100-AP (step 25).\nAlternatives: The use of the above special dish enables simultaneous UV-irradiation to 4 differrent smaples without cross-contamination, but a normal petri dish can be used instead.\nIrradiate the cells with UV light (365 nm, 22 mW/cm2 at a distance of 5 cm) for 30 min at 4°C using B100-AP (UVP; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Skip this step if UV irradiation was not performed (for the control [no UV sample]).\nNote: UV irradiation for a long period would heat the cell culture and cause the denaturation of cellular proteins. Therefore, conducting UV-irradiation of the cells in the cold room is recommended.\nAfter mixing the cultures by pipetting, take 100 μL and rapidly and thoroughly mix with 100 μL of 10% (v/v) TCA solution to denature proteins.\nPut the tubes on ice for over 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tube (20,400 × g for 5 min at 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 600 μL of acetone to the pellet, and then sonicate with a desk-top bath sonicator and vortex to wash the protein precipitates.\nCentrifuge the tube (20,400 × g for 5 min at 4°C) again and discard the supernatant.\nAir-dry the pellets at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: The pellets can be stably stored at least for a month at −25°C.\nPurification and detection of crosslinked products\nTiming: 2 days",
    "In this step (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 4), the crosslinked product was isolated and concentrated by affinity isolation using the His10-tag fused to the target protein, because the cellular levels of the ternary crosslinked products are often too low to be detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting when total cell lysates are used. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting.\nAdd 99 μL of SDS buffer containing of 12.5 mM NEM (N-ethylmaleimide) to the pellet.\nNote: NEM forms a covalent bond with free Cys residues and blocks the disulfide bond formation during subsequent processes.\nDissolve pellets by sonication, vortexing for 5 min and heating at 98°C for 5 min.\nThen, put 57 μL of the SDS-solubilized proteins into a 2 mL tube containing 1,800 μL of Triton Buffer.\nMix by vortexing.\nCentrifuge the tube (9,100 × g for 10 min at 4°C).\nTransfer 1,800 μL of the supernatants to a new 2 mL tube.\nAdd 30 μL of Ni-NTA Agarose (QIAGEN) suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1).\nNote: Be careful not to take the pellets.\nNote: Before use, wash Ni-NTA agarose with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) as described below.\nPipet 100 μL of 50% Ni-NTA agarose suspension in 30% EtOH into a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). Centrifuge the tube (9,100 × g for 20 s at 4°C), discard the supernatants, and suspend the Ni-NTA agarose in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) by adding 50 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and tapping.\nGently mix the samples overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C with vertical rotation of tubes at approximately 10 rpm.\nCentrifuge the tubes (9,100 × g for 20 s at 4°C), discard the supernatants.\nWash the pellets by adding 1,000 μL of Triton Buffer and vortexing.",
    "After centrifugation (9,100 × g for 20 s at 4°C), discard the supernatants.\nWash the pellets again by adding 1,000 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and vortexing.\nCentrifuge the tube (9,100 × g for 20 s at 4°C), and completely discard the supernatants.\nAdd 80 μL of SDS Sample Buffer and mix well by tapping to elute the proteins (the His10-tagged proteins are eluted by the SDS sample buffer as 2-mercaptoethanol reduces Ni in this buffer).\nHeat the sample at 98°C for 5 min.\nNote: Because BMB is an irreversible maleimide crosslinker, the BMB crosslinks are not cleaved by treatment with the 2-mercaptoethanol reducing agent, unlike disulfide bonds.\nCentrifuge the tube (9,100 × g for 20 s at room temperature (20°C–25°C)) and collect the supernatant containing eluted proteins.\nSeparate the purified proteins by 7.5% Laemmli SDS-PAGE using a standard protocol.\nTransfer the separated proteins on to PVDF (0.45 μm) membrane using a standard semi-dry blotting procedure.\nIncubate the PVDF membrane in the BLOTTO solution for 30 min at 42°C for blocking.\nWash the PVDF membrane with PBS-Tween Buffer.\nIncubate the PVDF membranes in Can Get Signal Solution 1 (TOYOBO) and primary antibody (anti-BepA antibody (1:10000 dilution) or anti-BamA antibody (1:20000 dilution)) at room temperature (20°C–25°C) overnight with gentle shaking (12–14 h).\nCritical: The time required for primary antibody treatment can often be shortened to a few hours. However, the intensity of the crosslinked bands was considerably weakened. Therefore, an overnight primary antibody treatment is strongly recommended to obtain clear results.\nNote: Can Get Signal is a solution that improves the sensitivity and specificity in detection by immunoblotting.\nWash the PVDF membranes three times for 5–10 min with PBS-Tween buffer with gentle shaking.",
    "Incubate the PVDF membranes in Can Get Signal Solution 2 (TOYOBO) with a secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L)-HRP Conjugate; 1:5000 dilution) for 1 h with gentle shaking at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash the PVDF membranes three times for 5–10 min with PBS-Tween buffer with gentle shaking.\nImmerse the PVDF membrane in ECL prime solution for 1 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDetect the chemiluminescence signals using the LAS4000 mini lumino-image analyzer."
