  "procedures": [
    "This protocol follows the guidelines of our institutions human research ethics committee.\n1. Collection of Scans and Clinical Data\nCollect brain CT or MRI scans of patients with ischemic stroke. Most scanners save the scans as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files that can be copied to a hard disk or server.\nNOTE: Scans from every scanner type, scan protocol, and MRI field strength can be used, as long as 1) the time window requirements for the used scan type are met (see Table 1) and 2) there are no artifacts that hamper accurate infarct delineation. A detailed tutorial on artifact detection on CT and MRI is provided elsewhere23,24. An example of commonly occurring motion artifacts on CT is provided in Figure 2, and examples of scans of good quality are provided in the exemplar cases in the results section. Infarcts can be segmented on scans with any slice thickness and any in-plane image resolution. However, thin slices and high in-plane resolution will enable a more accurate representation of the infarct to the brain template.\nCollect the clinical variables in a data file (e.g., Excel) by making separate rows for each case and columns for each clinical variable. For infarct segmentation, include at least the variables date of stroke and date of imaging or a variable that indicates the time interval between stroke and imaging.\nEnsure that ethical guidelines and regulations regarding privacy are followed. Ensure that the data is either anonymized or coded. Pay specific attention to the removal of patient data such as name, address, and date of birth that are stored in the DICOM files as tags. These tags can be cleared using dcm2niix (free download available at <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix>)25.\n2. Conversion of DICOM Images to Nifti Files",
    "To convert the DICOM images to uncompressed nifti files using the dcm2niix tool, type \"[folder path of dcm2niix.exe]\\dcm2niix %d_%p [folder path of dicom files]\" in the command prompt. An example of the command with the folders paths inserted could be C:\\users\\matthijs\\dcm2niix %d_%p C:\\users\\matthijs\\dicom\\. This command will run the dcm2niix executable, convert the DICOM images in the selected folder and save the nifti files in the same folder.\nNOTE: The addition %d_%p ensures that the series description and protocol name are inserted in the file name. Additional features including options for batch conversion are provided in the dcm2niix manual at <https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage>. Other open source tools can be used for the conversion of DICOM images to nifti files, as well.\nEnsure that the name of the scan type (CT, FLAIR, DWI, or other sequence names) is copied into the file name during conversion (this option is available in dcm2niix).\nFor MRI scans, select DWI or FLAIR sequences for segmentation. Alternatively, any other structural sequence on which the infarct is visible can be used. See Table 1 for appropriate time windows after stroke in which CT, DWI, or FLAIR can be used for infarct segmentation.\nOrganize the nifti files in a convenient folder structure with a subfolder for each case (see the manual of RegLSM and Supplementary Figure 1). This manual can be downloaded from <www.metavcimap.org/support/software-tools>.\nNOTE: This folder structure is a requirement for the registration software RegLSM (see section 4). An update of RegLSM, making it BIDS (brain imaging data structure26, see <http://bids.neuroimaging.io>) compatible, is currently being developed and will soon be released.\n3. Infarct Segmentation\nGeneral remarks applying to all scan types\nEnsure that the person who performs and evaluates segmentation and registration is blinded to the outcome variable (usually a cognitive measure) to avoid bias.",
    "Note that infarcts are usually segmented on transversal slices, but segmentation can be performed in any slice orientation.\nEnsure ideal viewing conditions during infarct segmentation by using a high-resolution monitor display and optimal ambient light to provide a comfortable setting. Manually adjust the image contrast during segmentation to provide optimal contrast between healthy brain tissue. Be consistent in applying similar settings across subjects.\nInfarct segmentation on CT\nFirst check whether the scan was performed at least 24 h after stroke symptom onset. Within 24 h, the acute infarct is not or only partially visible on CT and the scan cannot be used for segmentation7. See Figure 3 for an illustration.\nOpen the native CT using ITK-SNAP software (free download available at <www.itksnap.org>)27. In ITK-SNAP, click File | open main image from the dropdown menu. Click browse and select the file to open the scan. If the default contrast setting provides poor contrast between healthy brain tissue and the lesion, adjust the contrast settings. To do so, click Tools | image contrast | contrast adjustment.\nNOTE: Any open source software can also be used.\nIf available, open a CT that was performed within 24 h after stroke symptom onset in a separate instance as the reference to distinguish the acute infarct from old ischemic lesions such as lacunes, (sub)cortical infarcts, or white matter hyperintensities.\nIdentify the infarct based on the following characteristics. Infarcts have a low signal (i.e., hypodense) compared to normal brain tissue.\n\t\t\nIn the acute stage (first weeks), large infarcts can cause mass effect resulting in displacement of surrounding tissues, compression of ventricles, midline shift and obliteration of sulci. There can be hemorrhagic transformation which is visible as regions with high signal (i.e. hyperdens) within the infarct.",
    "In the chronic stage (months to years), the infarct will consist of a hypodens cavitated center (with a similar density as the cerebrospinal fluid) and a less hypodense rim which represents damaged brain tissue. Both the cavitated center and hypodens rim must be segmented as infarct. In case of large infarct, there can be ex vacuo enlargement of adjacent sulci or ventricles.\nNOTE: Tissue displacement due to mass effect or ex vacuo enlargement of structures should not be corrected for during segmentation (i.e., only the full extent of the infarct has to be segmented). Correction for tissue displacement takes place during the registration and subsequent steps.\nSegment the infarcted brain tissue using the paintbrush mode from the main toolbar (left-click to draw, right-click to erase). Alternatively, use the polygon mode to place anchor points at the borders of the lesion (these points are automatically connected with lines) or hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse over the borders of the lesion. Once all anchor points are connected, click accept to fill the delineated area.\nAvoid the fogging phase, which refers to the phase in which the infarct becomes isodense on CT (which co-occurs with infiltration of the infarcted tissue with phagocytes). This typically occurs 14-21 days after stroke onset, but in rare cases can occur even earlier28. During this period, the infarct can become invisible or its boundaries become less clear, making this stage unsuitable for infarct segmentation. After the fogging phase, the lesion becomes hypodense again when cavitation and gliosis occur. See Figure 4 for two examples.",
    "After finishing the segmentation, save it as a binary nifti file in the same folder as the scan by clicking segmentation | save segmentation image from the dropdown menu, then save the segmentation by giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (e.g., if the scan was saved as \"ID001.CT.nii\", save the segmentation as \"ID001.CT.lesion.nii\").\nInfarct segmentation on DWI\nFirst check if the DWI was performed within 7 days of stroke onset. Infarcts are visible on DWI within several hours after stroke onset and their visibility on DWI gradually decreases after approximately 7 days (see paragraph 2 in the discussion for more details).\nOpen the DWI in ITK-SNAP (in the same way as done in step 3.2.2).\nNOTE: A DWI sequence generates at least two images for most scan protocols, one with a b-value = 0, which is a standard T2-weighted image, and one with a higher b-value, which is the scan that captures the actual diffusion properties of the tissue. The higher the b-value, the stronger the diffusion effects. For ischemic stroke detection, a b-value around 1000 s/mm2 is often used, as this provides a good contrast-to-noise ratio in most cases29. The image with a high b-value is used for infarct segmentation.\nOpen the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence in a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference.\nIdentify and annotate the infarcted brain tissue based on the high signal (i.e., hyperintense) on DWI and low signal (i.e., hypointense) on the ADC (see Figure 5). ADC values in the infarct gradually increase until ADC normalizes on average 1 week after the stroke30, but in some cases, the ADC may already be (nearly) normalized after several days if there is much vasogenic edema.",
    "NOTE: In DWI images with low b-values, brain lesions with an intrinsic high T2 signal (such as white matter hyperintensities) can also appear hyperintense. This phenomenon is called T2 shine-through31. However, with increasing b-values, this phenomenon becomes less relevant, as the signal on the DWI image more strongly reflects diffusion properties instead of intrinsic T2 signal. With modern DWI scan protocols (usually with b-value=1000 or higher), the T2 shine-through effects are limited32.\nDo not mistake a high DWI signal near interfaces between air and either tissue or bone, which are a commonly observed artifact, for an infarct. See Figure 5.\nSave the annotation as a binary nifti file, giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (in the same way as done in step 3.2.7).\nInfarct segmentation on FLAIR\nFirst, check if the scan was performed >48 h after stroke symptom onset. In the hyperacute stage, the infarct is usually not visible on the FLAIR sequence or the exact boundaries of the infarct are unclear31 (see Figure 6).\nOpen the FLAIR in ITK-SNAP in the same way as done in step 3.2.2.\nOpen the T1 a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference, if available.\nIdentify and segment the infarcted brain tissue based on the following characteristics.\n\t\t\nIn the acute stage (first few weeks), the infarct is visible as a more or less homogeneous hyperintense lesion, with or without apparent swelling and mass effect (Figure 5).\nIn the chronic stage (months to years), the infarct is cavitated, meaning the center becomes hypo- or isointense on FLAIR. This cavity can be most accurately identified on the T1. In most cases, the cavitated center is surrounded by a hyperintense rim on the FLAIR, representing gliosis.33.",
    "NOTE: However, there is a considerable amount of variation in the degree of cavitation and gliosis of chronic infarcts. Segment both the cavity and the hyperintense rim as infarcts (see step 3.2.5). A FLAIR hyperintense lesion is not always an infarct. In the acute stage, small subcortical infarcts can easily be distinguished from white matter hyperintensities or other chronic lesions such as lacunes of presumed vascular origin when there is a DWI available (see Figure 5). In the chronic stage, it can be more difficult. See paragraph 3 in the discussion for more information on how to discriminate these lesion types in the chronic stage.\nSave the annotation as a binary nifti file, giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (in the same way as done in step 3.2.7).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nScan type,Time window after stroke,Infarct properties,Reference scan,Pitfalls\nCT,>24 h,Acute: hypodense,-,- Fogging phase\nCT,>24 h,Chronic: hypodense cavity with CSF and less hypodense rim,-,- Hemorrhagic transformation\nDWI,<7 days,Hyperintense,ADC: typically hypointense,- T2 shinethrough\nDWI,<7 days,Hyperintense,ADC: typically hypointense,- High DWI signal near interfaces between air and bone/tissue\nFLAIR,>48 h,Acute: hyperintense,\"Acute: DWI/ADC, T1 (isointense or hypointense)\",- White matter hyperintensities\nFLAIR,>48 h,\"Chronic: hypointense or isointense (cavity), hyperintense rim\",Chronic: T1 (hypointense cavity with CSF characteristics).,- Lacunes\nTable 1: Summary of criteria for infarct segmentation for different scan types.\n4. Registration to Standard Space\nDownload RegLSM from <www.metavcimap.org/features/software-tools>4. Use this tool to process CT scans and any kind of MRI sequence. The registration procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.",
    "NOTE: Optional features in RegLSM include registration to an intermediate CT/MRI template that more closely resembles the scans of older patients with brain atrophy22. By default, the CT and MRI scan are registered to the MNI-152 template34, but this can be replaced by other templates if this better suits the study. Different registration schemes are illustrated in Figure 7. Other open source registration tools can also be used for this step.\nCheck 1) if the nifti files are not compressed, 2) that the file name of the segmented scan contains the term CT, FLAIR, or DWI, and 3) that the file name of the lesion annotation contains the same term with an appended \".lesion\". If these first three steps are followed, the data is fully prepared for registration and nothing needs to be changed.\nOpen MATLAB (version 2015a or higher), set the current folder to RegLSM (this folder can be downloaded from 35 (version 12 or higher, free download at <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>) by typing addpath {folder name of SPM}. Next, type RegLSM to open the GUI.\nSelect test mode in the registration dropdown menu to perform the registration for a single case. In the test mode panel, select the scan (CT, FLAIR, or DWI), annotation, and optionally the T1, using the open image button. Select the registration scheme: CT, FLAIR with or without T1, DWI with or without T1.\nAlternatively, select batch mode to register the scans of all cases in the selected folder in batch mode.\nEnsure that RegLSM saves the resulting registration parameters and the registered scans (including intermediate steps) and the registered lesion map in subfolders that are automatically generated. During this process, the registered scans and lesion maps are resampled to match the resolution (isotropic 1 mm3 voxels) and angulation of the MNI-152 template.",
    "5. Review Registration Results\nSelect the option check results in the RegLSM GUI and browse to the main folder with the registration results. The GUI will automatically select the registered scan with the registered lesion map, and the MNI-152 template with the registered lesion map in transverse, sagittal, and coronal orientations (see Figure 8).\nScroll through the registered scan and use the crosshair to check the alignment of the registered scan and the MNI-152 template. Pay specific attention to the alignment of recognizable anatomical landmarks such as the basal ganglia, ventricles, and skull.\nMark all failed registrations in a separate column in the data file (made in step 1.2) for the subsequent manual correction in section 6.\nNOTE: Common errors in the registration are imperfect alignment due to the mass effect caused by the lesion in the acute stage, or ex vacuo enlargement of ventricles in the chronic stage. See Figure 3 and Figure 5 for examples of such misalignment. Another common error is a misalignment of the tentorium cerebelli, in which case an occipital infarct can overlap with the cerebellum in the template. Misalignment of tissues that are not lesioned is not an issue when only the binary lesion maps are used in the subsequent lesion-symptom mapping analyses. In such cases, only the lesions need to be perfectly aligned.\n6. Manually Correct Registration Errors\nFor the lesion maps that need correction, open the MNI-152 T1 template in ITK-SNAP and select from the segmentation menu | open segmentation | registered lesion map, which is now overlaid on the template.\nOpen the registered brain scan in a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference.",
    "Correct the registered lesion map in ITK-SNAP for any type of misalignment that is mentioned in step 5.3 using the brush function to add voxels (left click) or remove voxels (right click). Carefully compare the registered scan and overlaid lesion map (see step 5.2) with the MNI-152 template and overlaid lesion map in ITK-SNAP (see step 6.1) to identify the regions of misalignment. See Figure 3 and Figure 5.\nAfter manually correcting lesion map in MNI space, perform a final check by comparing the segmented native scan of the patient with the corrected lesion map in MNI space (i.e., the results of step 6.3). Ensure that the corrected lesion map in MNI space now accurately represents the infarct in native space. Pay specific attention to the recognizable landmarks such as basal ganglia, ventricles, and skull (similar to step 5.2).\nSave the corrected lesion map in MNI space as a binary nifti file in the same folder as the uncorrected lesion map in MNI-152 space, giving it the exact same name as the uncorrected lesion map, with the extension of .corrected.\n7. Preparing Data for Lesion-symptom Mapping\nRename all the lesion maps. By default, RegLSM saved the lesion maps in a subfolder with the file name \"results\". Include the subject ID in the file name. In the case of manual correction, be sure to select and rename the corrected file.\nCopy all the lesion maps into a single folder.\nPerform a sanity check of the data by randomly selecting and inspecting several lesion maps in ITK-SNAP and compare these with the native scans to rule out systematic errors in data processing such as left-right flipping.",
    "Use MRIcron <https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron> to perform another sanity check of the data by creating a lesion overlap image to check if no lesions are located outside the brain template. Do this by selecting the draw dropdown menu | statistics | create overlap images.\nNOTE: The resulting lesion overlay map can be projected on the MNI-152 template and inspected using, for example, MRIcron or ITK-SNAP.\nThe lesion maps are now ready to be used for voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping or for calculation of infarct volumes within specific regions of interest using an atlas that is registered to the same standard space as the lesion maps (in this case, MNI-152 space for which many atlases are available, only a few of which are cited below36,37,38).\nSubscription Required.
