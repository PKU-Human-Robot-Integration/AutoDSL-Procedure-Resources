    "All components of this study were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, and with the approval of King's College London Ethical Review Panel.\nThe experimental workflow is summarized in Figure 1.\n1. Animal preparation\nInduce atherosclerosis by feeding ApoE-/- mice a high-fat diet containing 21% fat from lard and 0.15% (wt/wt) cholesterol on average for up to 12 weeks.\nLoad a 29 G needle insulin syringe with the right volume of the contrast agent (gadofosveset trisordium) to achieve a dose of 0.03 mmol/kg. Keep the injection volume between 50-150 µL.\nPlace the cage on a heating pad set to 37 °C to pre-heat the animal and maintain the body temperature.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the mouse in an induction box lined with absorbent tissues. Adjust the flowmeter to 3%-5% of isoflurane at 1 L/min of O2 for about 3-5 min.\n\tNOTE: Ensure correct anesthesia depth by identifying the slowing breathing rate, which should decrease to less than 70 breaths per minute (bpm).\nConfirm anesthesia using the toe pinch method (i.e., loss of withdrawal reflex to toe pinch). Transfer the animal to a holder and insert its nose into a nose cone. Place the holder on a heating pad to maintain the animals' body temperature.\nMaintain anesthesia, delivered through the nose, by setting the anesthesia airflow in the holder to 1%-2% isoflurane at 1 L/min of O2.\nApply vet ointment on the animal's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace the animal either prone or on its side and clean the tail with an alcohol swab. Locate one of the two tail veins. If necessary, warm up the tail with a UV lamp to make the tail veins more visible.",
    "Insert the 29 G insulin needle parallel to the vein with the bevel of the needle facing up. Gently inject the volume of the prefilled syringe containing gadofosveset trisodium. Ensure that there is no bleeding at the injection site after withdrawing the needle.\nWait for 30 s for gadofosveset to circulate, and then transfer the mouse to the MRI bed.\n2. Preparation of the MRI scanner (see Figure 1)\nCover the MRI table with absorbent tissues.\nPlace the MRI single-loop receiver coil on the MRI bed. Use a platform to raise the receiver coil and avoid direct contact between the receiver coil and the MRI table.\nSecure the coil to the platform using surgical tape.\nPlace and secure the tubing connected to a circulating heating pump around the coil and set it to 37 °C to maintain the animal's body temperature during imaging.\nPlace the anesthesia delivery tubing into the bore of the MRI scanner and tape it so that the nose cone reaches the tip of the receiver coil where the animal's head will be placed.\nTurn on the in-bore camera to monitor the animal from the console room.\nIn the MRI console room, use the software interface to start a new study for the animal (patient).\n3. Animal positioning in the MRI scanner and monitoring (see Figure 2)\nTransfer the anesthetized animal to the scanner room. Place the mouse in the prone position on the receiver coil and ensure that its snout fits into the nose cone to maintain anesthesia. Turn the anesthesia airflow to 1%-1.5% isoflurane at 1 L/min of O2.\nEnsure to place the animal on the MRI coil with its heart and neck regions located at the center of the receiver coil.",
    "Secure the nose of the mouse into the nose cone, the abdomen, and the tail of the mouse on the platform with tape.\nPlace four electrodes on the anterior and the rear paws, making sure that the palm of the toes is completely open to record the electrocardiogram (ECG). Use ECG conductive gel on the mouse's paws before attaching the ECG pads to improve conductivity.\nEnsure to use tape to firmly attach the electrodes to the platform.\nAlign the laser of the scanner's bed with the base (proximal end) of the heart; use the clavicle and anterior paw line as a landmark. Position the animal in the magnet's isocenter using an automatic MR table.\n4. MRI image planning and acquisition\nStart a scout scan to run the standard calibrations for the MRI system.\nSet the monitoring equipment to detect the R-wave of the ECG. Adjust the thresholds for each mouse and within imaging sessions so that there is reliable triggering.\n\tNOTE: The mouse heart frequency under deep anesthesia usually ranges between 400-600 beats per minute (bpm).\nAcquire a 3D gradient echo scan (GRE) to get multiplanar pilot images (scout images) to plan the rest of the scans (see Table 1 for the MRI acquisition parameters and Figure 3 for planning).\nIdentify the heart on the scout images, particularly on the coronal view, most easily by its flow artifacts.\n\tNOTE: If the images show the mouse is not well centered over the coil or the isocenter, retract the bed and repeat positioning.\nPlan a 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) scan (see Table 1 for scan for the MRI acquisition parameters and Figure 3 for planning) in a transverse plane extending from the base of the heart toward the neck and carotid arteries with an 8 mm field-of-view (FOV).",
    "Use the maximum intensity projection (MIP) images to visualize the aortic arch, brachiocephalic and carotid arteries and plan the subsequent late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 mapping, and cine scans (see Figure 3 for representative images).\n\tNOTE: If the level of the imaging volume is not correct, repeat the acquisition by moving the slices either proximally or distally.\nMRI image acquisition to measure endothelial permeability.\n\t\nUse the MIP and transverse MRA images acquired before to plan a single slice 2D-Look-Locker (LL) acquisition perpendicular to the ascending aorta or carotid arteries (see Table 1 for scan for the MRI acquisition parameters and Figure 3 for representative images).\nSet the heart rate to 60 bpm when using a simulated ECG signal or set a blanking period to ensure that the inversion recovery pulse between subsequent inversion recovery pulses is 1000 ms when using the recorded ECG signal.\nUse the Look-Locker images to determine the optimal inversion time (TI) for blood signal nulling required for the LGE scan.\nLGE imaging: After 20-30 min of injection of gadofosveset, and immediately after the LL scan (described in steps 4.7.1-4.7.3) acquire an LGE scan using an inversion-recovery 3D fast gradient echo sequence (see Table 1 for the MRI acquisition parameters and Figure 3 for representative images).\nPlan a transverse 3D fast gradient echo LGE scan to cover the base of the heart (to include part of the aortic root), the brachiocephalic artery (between the aortic root to the subclavian bifurcation), and part of the carotid arteries with an 8 mm field-of-view (FOV) in the foot-head direction using the same geometry as for the MRA above (see Figure 3 for representative images).",
    "Set the heart rate to 60 bpm, when using a simulated ECG signal, or set a blanking period to ensure that successive inversion recovery pulses occur at every 1000 ms for the LGE scan when using the recorded ECG signal (as for step 4.7.2 above).\n\t\tNOTE: This is important for consistent and heart rate independent recovery of the magnetization between successive inversion recovery pulses.\nInsert the T1 obtained from the Look-Locker into the LGE sequence under Contrast > Inversion Delay.\nT1 mapping imaging: Use a 3D fast gradient echo acquisition to acquire transverse T1 mapping images 45 min after injection of gadofosveset. Plan the sequence in the same orientation and geometry as the LGE scan above (see Table 1 for the MRI acquisition parameters and Figure 3 for representative images).\nSet the heart rate to 120 bpm, when using a simulated ECG, or set a blanking period to ensure that the inversion recovery pulse between the two imaging trains occurs at every 500 ms when using the recorded ECG trace.\n\t\tNOTE: The T1 mapping sequence uses two non-selective inversion pulses with inversion times between 20-2000 ms, followed by eight segmented readouts for eight individual images. The combination of the two imaging trails results in a total of sixteen images per slice with varying inversion times. The images are automatically reconstructed on the scanner using a three-parameter fit model. The equations used to generate the T1 parametric maps are:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62724/62724eq01.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62724/62724eq02.jpg\nMRI image acquisition to measure endothelial function\n\t\nPrepare a solution of diluted acetylcholine in saline. Load a 29 G needle insulin syringe with the right volume of solution to achieve (16.6 mg/kg). Keep the injection volume between 50-150 µL.",
    "Using the transverse MRA and corresponding MIP images, place a transverse slice across the brachiocephalic artery, between the aortic root and the subclavian bifurcation (Figure 3 for representative images).\nUse a transverse 2D gradient echo (GRE) with retrospective ECG gating to acquire temporally-resolved cine images of the brachiocephalic artery (see Table 1 for the MRI acquisition parameters Figure 3 for representative images).\nAdjust the number of maximum cardiac phases to the heart rate of each animal.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, 14 cardiac phases provide sufficient temporal resolution.\nAfter acquiring the baseline images, enter into the MRI scanner room. While the mouse is anesthetized in the scanner, gently inject acetylcholine intraperitoneally (IP). Avoid moving the mouse on the coil.\nWait for 6-10 min for the heart rate to stabilize and repeat the acquisition.\nAt the end of the imaging procedure, return the mouse to its cage and place the cage on a heating pad for recovery.\n\t\t​NOTE: Mice are recovered when they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nExport the acquired images in a digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format and use an open-platform image analysis software.\n5. MRI segmentation and data analysis (see Figure 4)\nDrag and drop the Dicom files into the database of an open-platform software to load all the images.\nUse the LGE images to visualize contrast uptake in the vessel wall and calculate the area of enhancement as a surrogate marker of endothelial cell leakage.\nSelect both the MRA and inversion recovery scans. Press Enter to load these images side-by-side. Click on the small icon next to the scan name and drag and drop the MRA images onto the LGE images.\nSelect the option Re-sample to re-slice the MRA images using the LGE images as a reference to account for differences in slice thickness.",
    "Click on the small icon next to the scan name. Drag and drop the LGE images onto the MRA images (as in step 5.4 above). From the menu, choose Image Fusion to overlay the LGE and MRA images.\nFrom the toolbar, click on 2D Viewer, and then choose 3D Position Panel. Use the buttons to manually correct for in-plane shifts to account for potential small displacements because of animal respiration.\nUse the Closed Polygon tool located in the toolbar to manually segment the visually enhanced segment of the vessel wall. Use the co-registered MRA and LGE images to guide the segmentation.\nSegment all the LGE images that encompass the brachiocephalic artery.\n\tNOTE: If the enhancement of the vessel wall has a diffused or patchy appearance, segment those individually in each slice.\nClick on the Plugins button in the toolbar and choose ROI Tools, and then Export ROIs to export the segmented area (mm2) for each region of interest (ROI) in a spreadsheet.\nSum the area of each slice to calculate the total area of enhancement in the brachiocephalic artery in the spreadsheet.\n\tNOTE: The total area of enhancement can be used as a quantitative marker of endothelial permeability.\nUse the T1 maps that are automatically generated on the MRI scanner computer to calculate the mean T1 value of the vessel wall that reflects the amount of uptake of gadofosveset into the vessel wall-this is another quantitative marker of endothelial permeability.\nLoad the MRA and T1 map images and follow a similar approach as described above (steps 5.3-5.9) to segment the vessel wall and extract the T1 values (ms).",
    "In a spreadsheet, invert the T1 values and multiply by 1000 to calculate the relaxation time R1 = 1/T1 in seconds. Calculate the mean R1 for all slices covering the brachiocephalic artery in each animal.\nLoad the phase contrast angiography images and velocity maps to calculate the changes in the area of the vessel and blood flow velocity, respectively, during the cardiac cycle.\nSegment both the images acquired before and after injection of acetylcholine to calculate endothelial-dependent vasoreactivity, a surrogate marker of endothelial (dys)function.\nUse the semi-automated Grow Region tool available in the ROI tab or use the Closed Polygon option available in the toolbar (as described in step 5.7) to segment the lumen area (mm2) of the brachiocephalic artery in the angiography images.\n\tNOTE: The semi-automated tool uses pixel thresholding to cluster pixels encompassing the blood pool based on their signal intensity.\nUse the Close Polygon tool to segment the corresponding blood flow velocity encoded maps to calculate the blood flow velocity (cm/s).\nExport the lumen area (mm2) and blood flow velocity (cm/s) in a spreadsheet (as described in step 5.9) and identify those that correspond to the end-diastolic (maximum area) and end-systolic (minimum area) cardiac phases.\nUse the tabulated spreadsheet to calculate the endothelium-dependent vasodilation (calculate the percentage change in the end-diastolic (ED) lumen area and blood flow velocity pre- and post-injection of acetylcholine). Use the following formulas:\n\tarea change= imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62724/62724eq03.jpg\n\tflow change= imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62724/62724eq04.jpg\nFor each animal, tabulate the corresponding data derived from the LGE images, T1 maps, and the acetylcholine test in statistical software for analysis."
