    "1. Construction of the observing/documenting system\nNOTE: The materials needed to construct the fly behavior observing/documenting system are shown in Figure 1, and the completed system is shown in Figure 2. The protocol to construct the system and how to use it are described below.\nMake a fly behavior observation chamber (FBOC).\n\t\nObtain a small, translucent (not transparent) container to make an FBOC of size diameter (Ø) 15 mm x 20 mm. Use a translucent plastic bottle cap of size ~Ø17 mm x 22 mm to make an FBOC, or cut a section of ~17 mm from the thick end of a 5 mL pipette tip to make an FBOC.\nPour 1% agar into the FBOC to adjust its depth. If food needs to be placed in the FBOC (see for the preparation method of the food), pour the agar to obtain a depth of 12 mm. If food does not need to be placed in the FBOC, pour the agar to a depth of 5 mm to track the whereabouts of fruit flies more easily.\nIf using a pipette tip to make an FBOC, place the cut-off pipette tip section in a Ø35 mm or a Ø60 mm Petri dish. Pour the 1% agar gel into the Petri dish to a thickness of ~5 mm, wait for the agar to solidify, and seal the bottom of the FBOC. Then, pour the agar gel into the FBOC to the desired thickness.\nMake an FBOC base by boring a ~10 mm-deep hole in the center of a piece of a 60 mm x 60 mm x 15 mm ethylamine foam sheet with the same diameter as the FBOC. Insert the FBOC into the hole.",
    "NOTE: The FBOC base keeps the FBOC stable and prevents it from tipping over and facilitates the movement of the FBOC to track the flies during observation and videography.\nMake fly food, if necessary, with yeast medium2, artificial diet3, or pure sucrose/glucose (use 1% agar as gelling agent), depending on the purpose of observation.\n\t\nTo visually determine whether flies are feeding and increase the contrast between flies and their environment, add food dyes (see the Table of Materials) to the food to a final concentration of 12.5 mg/100mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The abdomens of the flies change color immediately after feeding.\nPour the prepared food into a Petri dish to a height of 8 mm. After solidification, use a razor blade to cut out a piece of food of size 8 mm x 4 mm x 8 mm, and place it on a piece of plastic (such as candy wrapper).\nCut the food into a quadrangular pyramid or quadrangular frustum pyramid, as shown in Figure 3, to allow observation and recording of fly behavior from different angles as the flies land on the food randomly. Use the plastic under the food is to prevent the dye in the food from diffusing into the agar in the FBOC. Use tweezers to place the food in the center of the FBOC.\nIn some behavioral observations, ensure that the flies are starved in advance. Pour 1% agar gel (1 g agar/100 mL water, 600 µL of propionic acid) into a clean empty bottle to a thickness of 1-2 cm, and place at room temperature for 1-2 h. Transfer flies to the bottle and place at 25 °C for ≥36 h.\n\tNOTE: Flies can absorb water from the agar gel, so there is no need to add water from time to time4,5.",
    "Transfer one or more flies into the FBOC using an aspirator. If using an aspirator is difficult, chill and inactivate the flies in crushed ice, sort them on an ice pack, and transfer them to the FBOC as described previously6.\n\tNOTE: The use of freezing greatly facilitates the transfer of flies; the chilled flies can regain consciousness within 1 min, much faster than those anesthetized with CO2. Although chilling could have detrimental effects on the behavior of flies, e.g., increased copulation latency of flies from 5 min7 to 40 min8, it does not change fly behavior (such as courtship behavior). Hence, the chilling method may be used to transfer flies for general observation (such as teaching experiments) and videography. However, if the observations are to be used in a scientific report, it is strongly recommended to not expose the flies to any anesthesia.\nAfter transferring the flies to the FBOC, cover it with a 30-40 mm UV/clear filter for the camera to form an FBOC complex (Figure 4). Place the FBOC complex under the stereomicroscope for observation.\n\tNOTE: To obtain clear and sharp images, it is strongly recommended to use high-quality UV/clear filter with high light transmittance (>98%) and reduced flare. Refer to some suggestions described previously9,10; although there is no need to buy expensive filters, avoid covering the FBOC with glass such as the lid of a Petri dish.\nIlluminate the FBOC. Mount mini LED video lights to flash hot shoe mount stands and place them on the left and right sides of the FBOC (Figure 2). Turn on the LED lights, and set the brightness to 100% and the color temperature to 5000-5600 K.",
    "NOTE: The mini LED video lights with dimmable light, 5600 K color temperature can provide uniform, bright, nearly shadow-free illumination. Using the top light source that comes with the stereo microscope, the LED Ring Light illuminator, or fiber optic illuminator did not yield satisfactory results. It is best to use continuous power supply (transformers) for LED video lights.\nObservation and videography of fly behavior\n\t\nTurn on the LED video lights, and adjust the stereo zoom microscope until the edge of the FBOC can be clearly seen with the naked eye. Move the FBOC to the center of the field of view.\nAttach the clamp of the universal telescope digital camera adapter to an eyepiece of the stereo microscope, and then attach a compact digital camera to the adapter securely by alternately turning the camera mounting screw and camera fixing screw (Figure 2).\nTurn on the digital camera, and turn the horizontal/vertical fine-tuning knobs until the FBOC edge clearly appears in the center of the bright circular field of view on the camera's LCD screen. Rotate the mode dial to Aperture-priority auto Mode, press focus on the multi selector, choose Macro close-up, and then press the OK button. Move the zoom switch from the wide-angle end to the telephoto end, and zoom into the circular image until its central portion fills the full LCD screen. Press the Movie-record button to start recording (press the button again to end recording).",
    "NOTE: If the image is too dark or too bright, press the side of the control dial close to the exposure compensation icon (Figure 1), and rotate the dial to alter the exposure value (EV) suggested by the camera to achieve the desired effect. Positive EVs make the image brighter, and negative EVs make the image darker. The image must be uniform, bright, without vignetting.\nTurn the focus knob of the microscope until the flies in the FBOC are clearly visible. Choose the fly behavior of interest for observation or video recording. Turn the zoom knob to zoom in and out to achieve the desired magnification for observation or video recording.\n\t\t​NOTE: This method of taking images under the microscope through the eyepieces is applicable to any microscope with eyepieces. To take photographs of experimental results, use a camera that can shoot in RAW format, as RAW image files are preferable to JPEGs. Use the camera's LCD screen as a display to observe the behavior of fruit flies, and ensure that the stereo zoom microscope has at least 5-50x zoom.\n2. Protocols for observation and videography of fly behavior\nPreparing the flies\n\t\nCulture the flies on cornmeal medium at 25 °C with 60% humidity and a 12 h light/dark cycle. Collect flies within 6 days of hatching for observation (except courtship and fighting behavior).\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the medium was composed of 1000 mL of water, 105 g of cornmeal flour, 75 g of sucrose, 15 g of agar, 40 g of yeast powder, 28 mL of 10% methyl paraben (w/v in 95% ethanol), and 6.25 mL of propionic acid.\nRegaining consciousness from anesthesia by chilling",
    "Chill the flies as described previously.6 Transfer the Drosophila from the ice box to the FBOC using tweezers. Record the fly's process from inactivity to normal posture on video.\nFly sleep, feeding, excretion, and social behavior\n\t\nStarve flies for 36 h. Transfer 4-6 fruit flies to the FBOC with stained food. Observe and record fly behavior on video.\n\t\tNOTE: Flies that remain motionless for more than 5 min display sleep behavior11. Drosophila can sleep on food or on a vertical FBOC wall (the body is perpendicular to the observation chamber wall). Although the body does not move when sleeping, the abdomen can be seen to be undulating. Feeding behavior is manifested when the fly stretches out its proboscis, moves on the food while constantly sucking, and its abdomen turns blue. During group feeding or other activities, fruit flies stretch their feet to touch the bodies of other fruit flies in a friendly manner. This is a social behavior.\nFly grooming behavior\n\t\nChill the flies as described6. Throw the frozen flies into agar powder, and roll to cover them with agar powder. Transfer the flies to the FBOC. Observe and record grooming behavior.\n\t\tNOTE: When the fruit fly regains consciousness from the freezing, it will quickly shake off the agar powder from its body and clean every part of its body with its legs12,13. Grooming behavior can also be seen during feeding, courtship, and other behaviors.\nFly courtship and fighting behavior\n\t\nCollect female and male flies as described previously7. To observe the courtship behavior of flies, place a female fly and a male fly into the FBOC to observe and record 6 courtship (successful and failed) behaviors.\nTo observe the fighting behavior of flies, place two males in the FBOC. Observe and record their behavior of pushing and shoving each other.",
