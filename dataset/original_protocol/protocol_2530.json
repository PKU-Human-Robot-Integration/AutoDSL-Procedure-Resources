    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRibodepletion\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: It is necessary to reduce the excess of ribosomal reads in sequencing experiments. The step described below removes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from total RNA preparations. We used the rRNA NEBNext® rRNA Depletion Kit from New England Biolabs.\nCritical: To avoid unintended degradation of RNA samples, perform all procedures in a clean area, using RNase-free reagents, RNase-free tubes, and spraying all pipettes with RNase-way reagent.\nAnneal rRNA depletion probes.\nPrepare 1 μg of total RNA in 12 μL of nuclease-free H2O. Add the following components:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_4.csv\nPlace samples in a Thermocycler and run the following program with the lid set at 105°C:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_5.csv\nSpin down the samples and place them on ice.\nPrepare the RNase H master mix.\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_6.csv\nAdd 5 μL of the above mix to the RNA samples. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nPlace samples in a thermocycler (with lid at 40°C) and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nSpin down the samples in a tabletop centrifuge and place them on ice.\nPrepare the DNAse I master mix:\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_7.csv\nAdd 30 μL of the above and mix by pipetting up and down.\nPlace the samples in a thermocycler (with lid at 40°C) and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nSpin down samples in a tabletop centrifuge and place on ice.\nPurify ribodepleted RNA.\nAdd 110 μL (2.2×) of resuspended Agencourt RNAclean XP beads to the RNA samples.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 15 min on ice.\nSpin, place on a magnetic rack for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL 80% ethanol.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 30 s and remove supernatant.\nRepeat for a total of 2 washing steps.",
    "With lid opened, air dry the beads for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nElute RNA into 10 μL nuclease-free water.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nPlace tubes on a magnetic rack to separate.\nRemove 10 μL of the supernatant.\nTransfer it to a clean nuclease-free PCR tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2162-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. RNA integrity and efficiency of ribodepletion\n(A and B) Bioanalyzer profile of total RNA pre- and post-ribodepletion.\nPause point: Ribodepleted RNA can be stored at −80°C for prolonged periods of time. However, we moved to the next step immediately.\nNote: rRNA ribodepletion efficiency can be verified through RT-qPCR or by running 1 μL of sample in a bioanalyzer using the Agilent RNA 6000 kit (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Approximately 100 ng ribodepleted RNA is expected.\nCritical: Sodium borohydride treatment\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: This step reduces ac4C to tetrahydro-ac4C without affecting unmodified cytidine (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). It is the most critical step of the procedure.\nTreat RNA with NaBH4.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2162-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Reduction of ac4C\nNaBH4 reduces ac4C to tetrahydro-ac4C (top). Reduced ac4C less efficiently base pairs with guanosine and can interact with adenosine instead (bottom).\nPlace 10 μL of ribodepleted RNA (∼50–100 ng) in a 0.2 mL RNase-free tube.\nAdd 10 μL of 200 mM NaBH4. Mix tubes by finger-flicking.\nIncubate for 1 h at 55°C in the dark.\nCritical: NaBH4 releases heat and gas, generating bubbles within the solution. Since bubbles are generated, to avoid increased pressure inside the tubes, open the lids every 10 min and quickly spin down the tubes.\nNote: NaBH4 is an alkaline solution and induces RNA fragmentation to ∼100 nt at 55°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Optional: Reduction of ac4C with NaBH4 may also be performed at 37°C. However, an extra step of RNA fragmentation needs to be included when using temperatures lower than 55°C. While not performed in this protocol, in case further RNA fragmentation is needed, we use the NEBNext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/nebnext-magnesium-rna-fragmentation-module-protocol-e6150].\nNeutralize the reaction by adding 10 μL of 200 mM HCl.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2162-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. RNA integrity after NaBH4 treatment\n(A) Agarose gel electrophoresis of total RNA samples treated with NaBH4 or left untreated.\n(B) Bioanalyzer profile of total RNA treated with 100 mM NaBH4 for 1 h at 55°C.\nPurify RNA.\nTransfer the solutions to new 1.5 mL RNase-free Tubes.\nAdd 370 μL of nuclease-free H2O.\nAdd 3 μL of 5 mg/mL linear acrylamide.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.\nAdd 40 μL of 3 M Sodium Acetate pH 5.5.\nMix well by inverting the tube several times.\nAdd 1.1 mL of 100% ethanol. Mix well.\nIncubate at −80°C for at least 1 h.\nPause point: samples can be stored at −80°C for 16–20 h.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 15 min at 4°C in a refrigerated microcentrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of 70% ethanol. Mix vigorously.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 5 min at 4°C in a refrigerated microcentrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRemove all traces of alcohol.\nAir dry the pellet for 5 min at 22°C–25°C with the lid opened.\nResuspend pellets in 6 μL of nuclease-free H2O.\nNote: To avoid further freeze and thaw of the NaBH4-treated RNA, we recommend moving directly to the next step.\nLibrary preparation\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Note: This step performs cDNA synthesis from NaBH4-treated RNA, followed by adapter ligation and PCR amplification. We used the NEBNext® UltraII™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for library preparation.\nFirst-strand cDNA synthesis.\nNote: After ribodepletion, NaBH4 treatment and all isolation steps, we obtained ∼10–40 ng of RNA material. NEB recommends using 1 ng–100 ng of ribodepleted RNA for library preparation. We used 10 ng of RNA (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nTo each sample of 5 μL NaBH4-treated RNA, add 1 μL of 50 μM NEBNext Random primers. (Provided with Kit).\nIncubate the sample at 65°C for 5 min, with a heated lid set at 105°C.\nHold at 4°C.\nTo each sample (6 μL), add the following components and mix by gentle pipetting:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_8.csv\nIncubate samples (20 μL total volume) in a preheated thermal cycler (with the heated lid set at 105°C) as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_9.csv\nNote: The temperature is elevated compared to the recommended by NEB. We have observed that elevating the temperature of reverse transcriptases increases C>T conversion upon NaBH4 treatment. See the “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” section for additional comments.\nAlternatives: Several reverse transcriptases can be used, including TGIRT, Superscript III, and AMV.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] An adapter ligation to the 3′ end of RNAs can be performed, followed by reverse transcription using a cDNA primer specific to the adapter. However, we have observed that adapter ligation is inefficient in NaBH4-treated RNA resulting in very poor library yield.\nSecond strand cDNA synthesis.\nAdd the following reagents to the first strand synthesis reactions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_10.csv\nMix thoroughly by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate samples (60 μL total volume) in a thermal cycler for 1 h at 16°C, with a heated lid set at ≤ 40°C.\nPurify cDNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_11.csv\nAdd 144 μL (1.8×) of resuspended AMPure XP Beads to the second strand synthesis reaction.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.",
    "Incubate for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nSpin and place the tube on a magnetic rack for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of 80% ethanol to the tube.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 30 s, and then remove supernatant.\nRepeat for a total of 2 washing steps.\nAir dry the beads for 5 min with lids open.\nRemove the tube from the magnet.\nElute the DNA target from the beads into 53 μL 0.1× TE buffer.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nPlace the tube in the magnetic rack until the solution is clear.\nRemove 50 μL of the supernatant.\nTransfer it to a clean nuclease-free PCR tube.\nEnd Prep of cDNA Library.\nMix the following components in a sterile nuclease-free tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_12.csv\nMix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate samples (60 μL total volume) in a thermal cycler (with the heated lid set at 75°C) as follows: 30 min at 20°C. 30 min at 65°C. Hold at 4°C.\nPerform Adaptor Ligation.\nNote: Dilute the NEBNext Adaptor for Illumina by mixing 1 μL of stock adapter (provided with Kit) with 9 μL with adaptor dilution buffer (provided with Kit)).\nAdd the following components directly to the End Prep Reaction. Caution: Do not pre-mix the components to prevent adaptor-dimer formation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_13.csv\nMix samples (93.5 μL total volume) by pipetting up and down.\nQuick spin to collect all liquid from the sides of the tube.\nIncubate 15 min at 20°C in a Thermomixer.\nAdd 3 μL USER Enzyme (provided with the kit) to the ligation mixture resulting in a total volume of 96.5 μL.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min with the lid set to higher than 45°C.\nPurify adapter-ligated cDNA.\nAdd 96.3 μL (1×) AMPure XP Beads.",
    "Mix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 10 min at 22°C–25°C.\nQuickly spin, and place on a magnetic rack for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 30 s.\nRemove supernatant.\nRepeat for a total of 2 washing steps.\nSpin the tube and put the tube back in the magnetic rack.\nCompletely remove the residual ethanol and air dry beads for 5 min.\nElute DNA with 17 μL 0.1× TE buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nWithout disturbing the bead pellet, transfer 15 μL of the supernatant to a clean PCR tube.\nPCR enrichment.\nTo the adapter-ligated cDNA (15 μL total volume), add the following components and mix by gentle pipetting:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_14.csv\nSet the thermocycler with the following steps:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2162_15.csv\nPurify libraries.\nTake samples out of the thermocycler and add 50 μL (1×) of resuspended AMPure XP Beads.\nMix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nSpin and place the tube on a magnetic rack for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol.\nIncubate at 22°C–25°C for 30 s.\nRemove supernatant.\nRepeat for a total of 2 washing steps.\nSpin the tubes and put back into the magnetic rack.\nCompletely remove the residual ethanol and air dry beads for 5 min.\nElute DNA target from the beads with 23 μL 0.1 TE buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nWithout disturbing the bead pellet, transfer 21 μL of the supernatant to a clean PCR tube.\nPause point: Libraries can be stored at −20°C indefinitely.\nQuality control step: Bioanalyzer of constructed libraries\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: The integrity, purity, and size distribution of DNA libraries should be checked in a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.",
    "Usually, 1 μL of sample is used for quality control using the Bioanalyzer and Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit.\nFollow the manufacturer’s suggestions[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90321_SensitivityDNA_KG_EN.pdf]. Representative results for libraries made from NaBH4-treated RNA used in our study are provided in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2162-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. DNA library integrity\nBioanalyzer profiles of DNA libraries from HeLa WT and NAT10−/− cells.\nQuality control step: Checking the efficiency of C>T conversion by PCR\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: This step is required to estimate the efficiency of C>T in a conserved ac4C site in 18S rRNA. A pair of primers surrounding position 1842 in 18S rRNA is used to amplify a region that contains an ac4C site at 100% stoichiometry. The residual amount of rRNA in the libraries is enough to perform this quality control. Following PCR, amplicons are analyzed by Sanger sequencing. We typically observed ∼50% C>T efficiency in position 1842 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). While the PCR and amplicon purification takes ∼2 h, sending the samples for Sanger sequencing and analyzing the data can take up to two days.\nTo 0.5 μL of libraries, add the following components and mix by gentle pipetting:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2162-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Completely remove the residual ethanol and air dry beads for 5 min.\nElute DNA target from the beads with 12 μL 0.1 TE buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C.\nWithout disturbing the bead pellet, transfer 11 μL of the supernatant to a clean PCR tube and store at −20°C.\nSend samples for Sanger sequencing using the 18S rRNA helix 45 Primer F (10 μM) – 5′ CGCTACTACCGATTGGATGG 3′\nAlign and verify C>T conversion at the ac4C site in position 1842 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nLibrary sequencing\nTiming: 2–6 days\nInstrument run time (HiSeq 2500): 40 h (rapid run mode) to 6 days (high output mode).\nThis step generates sequencing reads for the constructed library and should be performed by a sequencing facility. General guidance on run parameters includes:\nSequence on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or comparable four-channel instrument (see Note) for 126–150 cycles in paired-end mode (For 126–150 bp paired-end reads).\nNote: Illumina’s two-channel instruments have different baseline error profiles than their four-channel instruments. This protocol describes data produced with four-channel chemistry. It is critical that data that are compared are produced on the same instrument to ensure mismatch differences detected are not due to differences in chemistry.\nRead processing and alignments\nTiming: 1.5 days\nObtain raw reads from the sequencing facility.\nFor each sample, perform adapter trimming with cutadapt (v1.16).4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nConsult the documentation (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[href=https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]) to customize parameters for your dataset.

Conversion to interpretable read counts is performed by the mpileup2readcounts script, which enforces additional quality criteria on alignments. Before beginning, install this script by following the instructions at (https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/mpileup2readcounts[href=https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/mpileup2readcounts]). Place the executable in your working directory or a directory in your $PATH.\nRun the mpileup command and pipe to the mpileup2readcounts script.\nThis example runs this on three samples, called – wildtype (WT) NaBH4 treated, KO (NAT10−/−) NaBH4 treated, and WT Untreated:\nsamtools mpileup -A -R -Q20 -C0 -d 100000 --ff UNMAP,SECONDARY,QCFAIL,DUP \\\n  -f /data/indexes/STAR/hg19/ref.fa WT.BH4.bam KO.BH4.bam WT.Ctrl.bam \\\n  | sed 's/ / ∗ ∗/g' | \\\n  mpileup2readcounts 0 -5 true 0 0 > mpileup_output.txt;\nOptional: To reduce downstream compute time, you may restrict output to positions with a minimum depth, with an additional pipe, as this enforces a depth of 10 in each sample:\nsamtools mpileup -A -R -Q20 -C0 -d 100000 --ff UNMAP,SECONDARY,QCFAIL,DUP \\\n  -f /data/indexes/STAR/hg19/ref.fa WT.BH4.bam KO.BH4.bam WT.Ctrl.bam \\",

An example workflow with sample data is provided at Github: https://github.com/dsturg/RedaCT-Seq[href=https://github.com/dsturg/RedaCT-Seq]. The timing estimate above reflects computational run time along with consideration of diagnostic plots within the workflow. The workflow consists of 4 major steps, described below:\nCalculation of mismatch rates at each queried position, for each sample. For each mismatch relative to the reference genome, the mismatch rate is calculated as:\nMismatchRate = MismatchCounts / depth\nProjection of genomic coordinates into transcript coordinates. Candidate converted sites are projected onto reference transcripts using functions in the Genomation, GenomicFeatures, and Rtracklayer packages.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\ntxmapped <- mapToTranscripts(bed, exon_by_tx,ignore.strand=FALSE)\nQC and determination of candidate modified sites.\nBefore statistical testing, screening of sites is performed to ensure specificity of transcript assignment, absence of polymorphism, and mismatch rate above sequencing error:\nMismatch rate in untreated control < 1%.\nMapping to a single reference transcript.\nAbsence of multiple mismatch types at the same position.\nMismatch rate elevated relative to untreated sample.\nStatistical testing, thresholding, and exploratory plots.",
    "Note: Statistical testing is performed on mismatch and reference base calls between NaBH4 treated WT and NAT10−/− samples. To perform this test, 2 × 2 matrices are constructed for each relevant site, using the data: Mismatched base counts (WT), Reference base counts (WT), Mismatched base counts (NAT10−/−), Reference base counts (NAT10−/−). Fisher’s Exact Tests are performed in R as:\npvalue <- fisher.test(matrix)$p.value\nFinal selection of sites uses criteria on magnitude of difference of mismatch rate (as measured by fold change), in addition to the p-value."
