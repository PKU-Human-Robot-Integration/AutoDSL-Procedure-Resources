    "Preparation of total soluble extractsYeast strains are grown overnight in 5 ml of Yeast extract-Peptone-Dextrose broth or selective media at 30 °C.Dilute overnight cultures in 50 ml of fresh medium in order that after seven duplications, the yeast cultures reach an OD600 = 0.5 at 30 °C.Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 2,600 x g. Discard supernatant. Temperature of centrifuge is not relevant. Wash the cells with 25 ml of sterile water and discard supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml PB with protease inhibitors and transfer to a microfuge tube. Keep the samples on ice.Add 50 µl of zirconia/silica beads to each sample. Disrupt the cells by vortexing at maximum speed for 1 min and place on ice for another minute. Repeat 20 times.Centrifuge the lysate at 25,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and zirconia/silica beads Transfer supernatant to a clean microfuge tube. At this point, lysates are ready for quantification of total protein and measurement of catalase activity. Alternatively, samples can be stored at -20 °C.Bradford assay for protein quantitationFill the wells of a microplate with 250 µl of Bradford regent. Prepare a standard curve of absorbance versus nanograms of protein using fresh BSA standards (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 ng/µl). Use PB as solvent.Dilute the lysates 1:20 or 1:50 with sterile water. Load 5 µl of the standards and diluted lysates to the Bradford reagent. Incubate room temperature for 5 min. Measure the absorbance at OD595 in a microplate spectrophotometer.Determine the amount of protein of the samples from the standard curve. Consider the dilution factor.Catalase activity assaySet up the spectrophotometer by first turning on the instrument and then the UV light. Set up a kinetics program to record every 30 s at a wavelength of 240 nm for 2 min.",
    "Calibrate the spectrophotometer using 3 ml of PB in a 3-ml quartz cuvette as a blank.Dilute the lysate samples 1:50 with PB. In a quartz cuvette, mix 1 ml PB with 1 ml of the diluted sample. To begin the assay, add 1 ml of the H2O2 solution (H2O2 to a final concentration of 10 mM). The initial absorbance must be between 0.550 and 0.520. If necessary, add H2O2 to increase the absorbance and Phosphate Buffer to decrease the absorbance.Mix the content by inversion and Immediately place the cuvettes into the spectrophotometer. Follow the decrease in absorbance at OD240 with a stopwatch for 2 min. A catalase solution must be used as a control. Pippete 2.9 ml of PB in the cuvette, add 1 ml 30 mM H2O2 and 100 µl of the catalase solution (~10 units). Record the initial and final absorbance in a one-minute period. Use 2 ml of PB and 1 ml of 30 mM H2O2 as blank.Calculate the catalase activity using the following formula (Cuellar-Cruz et al., 2009)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232823_9039.jpgWhereimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232833_4667.jpgis the difference between the initial and final absorbance.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232846_9764.jpg is the total volume of the reaction (3 ml).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232857_3348.jpgis the molar extinction coefficient for H2O2 at OD240 (34.9 mol-1 cm-1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232910_9692.jpg is the optical length path of cuvette (1 cm).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232929_6112.jpg is the volume of the sample in ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312232940_7965.jpg  is the protein concentration of the sample in mg/ml.Example of catalase activities of extracts from C. glabrata strains in exponential phase of growth:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140318/20140318200552_1813.jpg  Note: Catalase activity of the BG14 strain is higher in stationary phase ≈ 10 U/mg. However catalase activity of a cta1Δ is always < 2 U/mg or undetectable."
