    "Note: All the procedures described below must be performed under laminar flow hood in sterile conditions. Make sure that all culture procedures are carried out on thermostatically controlled stages and cells are maintained at 37 °C throughout their handling.\n1. Skin Fibroblast Isolation\nPrepare Culture Dish Coating Solution\n\t\nDissolve 0.1 g of porcine gelatin in 100 ml of water (final concentration 0.1%). Sterilize solution with autoclave.\nAdd 1.5 ml of sterile 0.1% porcine gelatin to 35 mm Petri dishes. Wait 2 hr to coat, maintaining them at room temperature.\n\t\tNote: Human skin biopsies are collected by excision under local anesthesia from an avascular area of the anterior aspect of the forearm and stored in Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) supplemented with 2% antibiotic antimycotic solution at +4 °C prior to use.\nWash biopsies with new PBS supplemented with 2% antibiotic antimycotic solution.\nPlace biopsies in a 100 mm Petri dish and cut into approximately 2 mm3 fragments with sterile scalpels.\nRemove the coating solution excess immediately prior to plating fragments.\nPlace 5-6 skin fragments into the pre-coated 35 mm Petri dish.\nPrepare fibroblast culture medium: 77% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose, 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% L-Glutamine solution and 2% antibiotic antimycotic solution.\nAdd a droplet of fibroblast medium over each fragment (usually 100 µl per fragment) and culture them at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 hr, add 500 µl of fibroblast culture medium over the fragments to keep them wet at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nChange the medium with a pipette at least once every 48 hr.\nAfter 6 days of incubation, remove tissue fragments carefully and discard them.\n\tNote: After 6 days, fibroblasts start to grow out of the tissue fragments and begin to form a cell monolayer.",
    "Refresh medium, add 2 ml of fibroblast culture medium and continue cell monolayer culture at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\n2. Fibroblast Culture\nCulture fibroblasts at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until 80% confluence\nFor passaging, aspirate fibroblast culture medium from tissue culture dishes. Wash cells three times with 4 ml of PBS supplemented with 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution.\nAdd a thin layer (10% of the culture medium volume) of trypsin-EDTA solution (0.5 g/L porcine trypsin and 0.2 g/L EDTA) and incubate at 37 °C until cell monolayer begins to detach from the bottom of the tissue culture dish and cells dissociate.\nDilute cell suspension with 9 parts of fibroblast culture medium to neutralize trypsin action. Centrifugation is not necessary.\nPlate cells in new culture dishes (without gelatin) and culture at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Keep the passage ratio between 1:2 and 1:4, depending on growth rate.\nWhen cells reach around 80% confluence, passage them (usually twice per week).\n3. Fibroblast Plating for Epigenetic Conversion\nAdd 0.26 ml/cm2 of 0.1% porcine gelatin (prepare as described in 1.1) to cell culture dishes. Wait 2 hr to coat.\nRemove the coating solution excess 10-30 min prior to plating fibroblasts.\nRemove fibroblast culture medium from culture dishes. Wash cells three times with PBS supplemented with 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution.\nAdd a thin layer (10% of the culture medium volume) of trypsin-EDTA solution (0.5 g/L porcine trypsin and 0.2 g/L EDTA) and incubate at 37 °C until cell monolayer begins to detach from the bottom of the tissue culture dish and cells dissociate.\nDilute cell suspension with 9 parts of fibroblast culture medium to neutralize trypsin action.",
    "Count cells using a counting chamber under a microscope at room temperature. Calculate the required volume of fibroblast culture medium to resuspend cells, to obtain a cell concentration of 7.8 x 104 fibroblasts/cm2. This will depend on the specific type of chamber used.\n\tCells/µl = Average number of cell per small grid x 90 (multiplication factor) x dilution\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 150 g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells with the previously calculated volume of fibroblast culture medium.\nPlate cells on 0.1% gelatin pre-coated dishes and culture them for 24 hr at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\n4. Increase Cell Plasticity Using the De-methylating Agent 5-aza-CR\nDay 0\n\t\nPrepare 5-aza-CR stock solution by dissolving 2.44 mg of 5-aza-CR in 10 ml of DMEM high glucose medium. Sterilize by filtration. Prepare 5-aza-CR stock immediately prior to use.\nDilute 1 µl of 5-aza-CR stock solution in 1 ml of fibroblast culture medium (final concentration 1 µM).\nTo increase cell plasticity, 24 hr after cell plating (subheading 3.8), remove culture medium from seeded fibroblasts and add 1 µM 5-aza-CR stock solution and culture for 18 hr at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\nDay 1\n\t\nPrepare fresh Human Pluripotent (HP) medium as described in Table 1.\nAfter incubation with 1 µM 5-aza-CR, remove medium and wash cells three times with PBS to ensure that 5-aza-CR is rinsed away.\nIncubate 5-aza-CR treated fibroblasts with HP medium for 3 hr (recovery period) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nAfter the recovery period, remove medium, wash three times with PBS.",
    "To monitor the efficiency of 5-aza-CR treatment, check in this step for the presence of morphological changes (detailed in Results section). Cells lose the typical elongated morphology of fibroblasts and acquire a round or oval shape, becoming smaller in size, with enlarged nuclei.\nProceed with pancreatic differentiation.\n5. Pancreatic Differentiation Protocol\nDays 1-6\n\t\nPrepare Pancreatic Basal Medium as described in Table 2.\nPrepare activin A stock solution: dissolve 5 µg of activin A recombinant human protein in 166.6 µl of sterile water.\nCulture 5-aza-CR treated fibroblasts in 0.26 ml/cm2 of Pancreatic Basal Medium, supplemented with 1 µl/ml activin A stock solution (see 5.1.2) for 6 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Change medium daily.\nDays 7-8\n\t\nPrepare retinoic acid stock solution by adding 16.6 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 50 mg of retinoic acid.\nCulture cells in 0.26 ml/cm2 of Pancreatic Basal Medium supplemented with 1 µl/ml activin A stock solution (see 5.1.2) and 1 µl/ml retinoic acid stock solution (see 5.2.1) for 2 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Change medium daily.\nDays 9-36\n\t\nCulture cells in 0.26 ml/cm2 of Pancreatic Basal Medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS), 2% (v/v) B27 and 0.1% (v/v) Recombinant Human FGF basic (bFGF) stock solution (see Table 1) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Change the medium daily for the first 15 days.\nFrom day 16 onward, refresh medium every other day, under a microscope, since forming aggregate cells may detach from the bottom of the culture dish.\nSubscription Required.
