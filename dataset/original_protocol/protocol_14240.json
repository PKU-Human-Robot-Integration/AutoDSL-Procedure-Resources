    "All methods described here have been approved by the veterinary government authority (Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, (LALLF M-V)).\n1. Preoperative Care and Preparation of the Animal\nUpon arrival in the animal facility, divide animals (C57Bl/6) into groups of similar size, cage each group together, and keep groups constant throughout the experiments.\n\tNOTE: Use animals of the same sex. The results described were obtained with male mice.\n\tNOTE: If male animals are used, cage groups together starting when they are 7 weeks of age so that a hierarchy can be established, thus minimizing the risk of aggressive behavior during experiments.\nAt least one week before surgery, switch to a high energy (>14 MJ/kg) and high protein (>20%) feed containing all the essential trace elements and vitamins (for details, see list of materials).\n\tNOTE: Assure all mice weigh at least 25 g when surgery is performed.\nInduce anaesthesia and analgesia by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (87 mg/kg i.p.) and xylazine hydrochloride (13 mg/kg i.p.). Wait until the mouse tolerates mechanical stimulation, e.g. toe pitch, without motor response.\nSecure the narcotized mouse with tapes in a supine position on a heat underlay positioned at the operation desk, guaranteeing stable positioning during operation and avoiding an overwhelming loss of body heat.\n\tNOTE: The heat underlay should have a surface temperature of 36 °C to 40 °C; the operating room temperature should be 21 °C.\n2. Distal Colostomy Operation\nShave the abdominal hair. Before starting surgery, disinfect the operation field three times using alcohol 70% and an iodophor. Drape the operation field to guarantee for aseptic conditions.\nPerform a 15-mm median laparotomy by incising the abdominal muscles and the peritoneum along the linea alba, thus minimizing blood loss.",
    "Use two DeBakey atraumatic forceps, carefully pull the cecum, terminal ileum, and ascending and transverse colon from the peritoneal cavity.\n\tNOTE: Be careful to strictly limit mechanical manipulation of the intestine to prevent injury to mesenteric structures.\nIdentify the cecal pole, the ascending colon, and small intestine (Figures 1a and 1b).\n\tNOTE: Correct identification of the ascending colon is fundamental for correct placement of the colostomy. In cases where the anatomy of the ileocecal region is ambiguous, the presence of Peyer's patches identifies the small intestine, and the presence of formed stool characterizes the colon.\nUse a ruler to determine the position of the future colostomy. It should be placed 20 mm distal to the ileocecal valve for a distal colostomy.\nMake a second 3-mm incision in the abdominal wall in the upper right quadrant. Pull the previously identified colon segment through this incision to form a loop, being careful not to distort the loop.\nCarefully pass a 22-gauge flexible i.v. cannula through the mesocolon. Take care not to damage mesenteric vascular structures.\nReturn the intestine to the peritoneal cavity.\nFix both ends of the flexible tube to the skin using simple stitches and a resorbable suture (e.g., polyglactin 910 or polyfil 4-0 1/2c).\nBefore closing the laparotomy, perform fluid resuscitation using an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL 0.9% saline.\nClose the peritoneum and the muscle layer with a continuous suture using a resorbable suture (e.g., polyglactin 910 or polyfil 4-0 1/2c). Close the skin with a continuous suture using a resorbable suture (e.g., polyglactin 910 or polyfil 4-0 1/2c).\nOpen the exteriorized colon loop by performing a subtotal transection using a fine scissor. Avoid all injury to the mesentery. Do not transect the colon completely.",
    "Fix each colostomy opening using three single full-thickness stitches to the peritoneum and skin using a monofil, absorbable suture (e.g., polydioxanone or monofil 6-0 3/8s). The afferent loop, which is a functional end-colostomy, and the efferent loop, which is a mucous fistula, are clearly separated at this point (Figure 1c).\n\tNOTE: Operation time should be less than 20 minutes to limit fluid and thermal losses.\nAfter finishing surgery, disinfect instruments using an aldehyde-free disinfection solution in an ultrasonic bath according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\n3. Sham Operation (Colotomy)\nPerform steps 1.1. through 2.4.\nUse a ruler to determine the future colotomy position. The colotomy should be positioned the same distance from the ileocecal valve as the colostomy in the experimental group.\nOpen the colon at least two-thirds its circumference using fine scissors.\nClose the colotomy with a single layer, full-thickness interrupted suture using a monofil, absorbable suture (e.g., polydioxanone, monofil 6-0 3/8s).\n\tNOTE: Operation time should be less than 20 minutes for an experimented surgeon, limiting fluid and thermal losses.\nPerform steps 2.10. , 2.11. and 2.14.\n4. Postoperative Care\nReturn animals to their cages. Provide a well-tempered atmosphere of 37 °C (e.g., with an infrared lamp) until mice are fully awake. Then, keep mice in a temperature- and humidity-regulated environment (21 °C; 30% ± 10% relative humidity). Allow free access to food and drinking water. To facilitate fluid uptake, provide additional water-soaked animal feed.\nStart postoperative analgesia by injecting 0.1 mg/kg body weight buprenorphine s.c. when animals show response to mechanical stimulation. Be careful to avoid respiratory depression.\nSupplement drinking water with 1 mg/mL tramadol for continued analgesia during the first postoperative week.\nTo compensate for decreased fluid intake due to reduced mobility, supply a Solid Drink Pad in the cage during the first postoperative week.",
    "Weigh the animals and score animal behavior daily during the first week, every second day during remainder of the first month, and every third day during the second month using the disease severity score described in Kleinwort et al.6.\nSubscription Required.
