    "1. Neutralization, Dilution and Polymerization of Collagen Solutions for 3D Investigation and Cellular Contraction Assays\nOn ice in sterile tissue culture hood, neutralize collagen (1:1) with sterile, ice-cold 100 mM HEPES in 2x PBS, pH 7.4, in a 15 ml conical tube. Mix thoroughly with plastic pipette until solution is homogenous and mixing swirls are no longer visible. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles during the mixing process. Store briefly on ice.\nDilute neutralized collagen to the appropriate concentration with cell media (such as RPMI, DMEM, etc.).\n\t\nTo calculate the amount of neutralized collagen required to make up desired collagen concentration, use the equation N = (D*V)/(S/2), where N is amount of neutralized collagen required, D is the desired collagen concentration, V is the final volume of the desired collagen concentration, and S is the starting stock collagen concentration.\nBring up the amount of neutralized collagen to volume by the addition of a cell and cell media solution. Mix thoroughly and store on ice until ready to cast.\n\t\t\nExample: For a 2 mg/ml gel in a 1 ml gel volume (typical volume for a gel cast in 6 well plate or 50 mm glass bottom dish), first multiply the desired concentration (2 mg/ml) by the desired final volume (1 ml). Take this number (2 mg) and divide it by half of the stock concentration listed on bottle (9.49 mg/ml). In this case, 0.42 ml of the neutralized collagen are diluted with 0.58 ml of media/cell mixture.\nPipet the ice-cold collagen/cell/media mixture into either a non-tissue culture treated 6-well plate or a 50 mm glass bottom dish. Use pipet tip to evenly spread out the solution.",
    "NOTE: It is important to use a non-tissue culture treated plate to minimize the attachment or growth of the cells outside of the collagen gel.\nAllow to polymerize at room temperature for approximately 10 - 15 min. The gels should turn opaque upon polymerization.\nAfter it has turned opaque, move plate or dish to 37 ˚C for additional 45 - 60 min to finish polymerization.\nAfter 45 - 60 min, add 2 - 3 ml of media and release gels from sides of the well by running a p200 pipet tip around perimeter of well or dish. Swirl dish gently to release the gel. The collagen gel should be floating in media.\n2. Western Blotting, Cell Morphogenesis and Gel Gontractility Assay\nTo assess protein levels, morphology or cellular contractility in relation to ECM stiffness, begin by pouring collagen gels, according to 1.1 - 1.6, seeded with cells for a 7 - 10 day assay. Determine each cell line seeding rate empirically depending on growth rate and confluency. For a 10 day assay, the seeding density can range from 20,000 - 100,000 cells/gel.\nTo measure cell contractility, measure the gel diameter by using a ruler or a camera every 24 hr or at the appropriate time interval.\n\tNote: Additionally, corresponding images collected from a microscope can be examined for morphological features characteristic of the cell line seeded in the gel, such as acini-like structures, epithelial tubules, cellular protrusions, and lameliapodia.\nTo assess protein levels, lyse the gels in RIPA buffer and process for Western blot analysis of proteins of interest as described in Wozniak et al. 17 and Gallagher et al. 18.",
    "IMPORTANT: In comparisons of contractility between cell lines, normalize contractility to total DNA, which can be extracted from the gels as outlined by Lui, et al.19, or to an unchanging, housekeeping protein (histones, GAPDH, etc.) by Western blot analysis, as described in Wozniak et al.17 and Gallagher et al.18. If counting cells within the gel using a hemocytometer, make sure to normalize cell number to total gel area as the contracting gel will concentrate cells.\nFeed gels every 3 - 4 days by removing 1 ml of media and replacing it with 1 ml of fresh media. Make sure to feed gels after the measurement is taken as the addition of fresh media/serum will cause a spike in contractility.\n3. Generation of PDMS Microchannels for Collagen Fiber Alignment\nNote: To generate aligned collagen matrices, a mold for PDMS microchannels (Figure 2A) requires a SU-8 silicon master made via soft-lithography15.\nTo make PDMS channels, mix PDMS thoroughly in a disposable cup with a craft stick. For a 6 inch silicone master, mix 20 g of elastomer base with 2 g of curing agent.\nDe-gas the PDMS mixture by placing the disposable cup in a vacuum chamber under a vacuum pressure of 550 mm Hg. De-gas for 1 - 1.5 hr.\nWhile de-gassing the PDMS, prepare the silicone master for pouring. Prepare by placing a clean sheet of transparency film onto a hotplate followed by the silicone master. Ensure that the microchannel mold faces up.\n\tNOTE: During PDMS casting and curing, the silicone master will be sandwiched between two sheets of transparency film.\nAfter 1 - 1.5 hr, remove the de-gassed PDMS from the vacuum chamber, and slowly pour over the silicone master.\n\tIMPORTANT: Avoid air bubbles. Continue to pour in center of master, and allow gravity to spread it evenly.",
    "NOTE: The PDMS drop does not need to extend all the way to the edge of the master.\nAfter PDMS has been poured onto the master, apply a second sheet of transparency film on top of the silicone master and PDMS. Carefully, roll the second transparency sheet down on top of the PDMS/silicone master to avoid air bubbles. Do not rush. PDMS should be now evenly spread over master.\nGently place a rubber sheet on top of the transparency, followed by a 1/8\" acrylic sheet.\nAdd three 10 lb weights on top of the acrylic sheet. Initially, the weights will \"float\". Allow them to settle and stabilize before proceeding further.\nSet hotplate temperature to 70 ˚C and cure PDMS for 4 hr. Allow to cool for minimum of 1 additional hr before disturbing.\nCarefully peel top sheet of transparency film from the wafer, and remove the channels with a forceps.\nStore in dust-free dish until ready to use.\n4. Prepping PDMS Microchannels for Use\nPlace channels upside down on new, clean transparency film. Clean all ports (Figure 2b) using circular motion with a sharp forceps. Remove any fragments of PDMS.\nClean channels by using a piece of packing tape as a tack cloth. Apply tape to surface of bench (sticky side up), and then set channel on top. Press down on channels with round end of forceps to ensure good contact. Remove and repeat on both sides until visible debris is removed.\nTransfer cleaned, prepped PDMS channels into a 50 ml conical with 70% EtOH. Vortex at maximum speed for 30 sec. Discard EtOH and replace with fresh 70% EtOH. Store in 70% EtOH until ready to use.",
    "In tissue culture hood and using aseptic techniques, transfer the PDMS channels to a clean and sterile cover glass or glass bottom dishes. Put the channel side up and UV treat until EtOH has evaporated.\nOnce dry, flip the PDMS so the channels are facing down toward coverglass. Press the PDMS channel down on the glass to make a good seal. Add a patch of sterile PDMS to cover/close the center port (port B, Figure 2b). Allow to thoroughly dry before proceeding.\nPre-coat the inside of the channel with 10 µg/ml collagen in sterile water. To coat, place a 100 µl droplet on the top of a channel, and draw through with vacuum. After 1 hr at 37 ˚C, transfer channels filled with collagen coating solution to a refrigerator. Chill for approximately 15 - 30 min.\nRemove collagen coating solution with aspirator or pipet, and begin collagen preparation.\n5. Collagen Preparation for Use in Microchannels\nOn ice, neutralize collagen (1:1) with ice-cold 100 mM HEPES in 2x PBS, pH 7.4. Mix thoroughly until homogenous (For more details, see section 1.1).\nDilute neutralized collagen to the appropriate concentrations with cell media (For more details, see section 1.2). Incubate for 15 min on ice.\nAt the same time, chill mounted channels on ice.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to have all the components for the channel process at 4 ˚C or below. Collagen nucleation temperature and time are key parameters to the polymerization process, and may be the starting point for further optimization, if needed.\nCount cells with a hemacytometer and resuspend at the appropriate seeding density at this time. For ease of calculations, resuspend to 1 - 3 million cells/ml. (For more details, also see section 2.1).\nOnce cells have been counted and 15 min have passed, proceed to collagen pouring.",
    "6. Pouring Aligned and Random Collagen Microchannels\nBefore drawing collagen through channels, adjust and set vacuum pressure with an inline vacuum regulator. Vacuum pressure provides the force to induce and control the rate of collagen flow, which determines the degree of alignment.\n\t\nFor random or unaligned matrices, use a wide channel (3mm wide x 200 µm tall) with a vacuum pressure of 10 mm Hg or less.\nFor aligned matrices, use narrow channel (1mm wide x 200 µm tall) with a vacuum pressure of 60 mm Hg or greater.\nRemove mounted channel from ice and place on clean, sanitized surface of laminar flow hood.\nWork quickly and load 120 - 150 µl of neutralized collagen into port A (Figure 2b).\nDraw collagen through the channel by placing a 25 ml pipet attached to the vacuum line over port c (Figure 2b). Draw collagen through in a single, uniform motion. IMPORTANT: For random or unaligned matrices, draw collagen slowly across channel (approximately 0.5 - 1 mm per second), and stop once it reaches the end. For aligned matrices, draw the collagen across more rapidly, but take care to avoid air bubbles.\nCarefully remove excess collagen from the port region with p200 pipetman or aspirator.\nPlace sterile PDMS patches over both ports A and C. All ports should now be covered.\nAfter 2 - 3 mins, remove center PDMS patch (port B) and add 2 - 3 μl of cells (5 - 10 thousand cells) into the center port. Allow to partially polymerize (turn opaque) at room temperature for another 10 - 15 min.",
    "After 10 - 15 min, transfer to 37 ˚C for additional 15 - 30 min to finish polymerization. Remove PDMS covers and add media to completely cover the channel and culture cells as needed. Cells can be fed by removing a ml of old media, and replacing it with a ml of new media.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
