    "Written informed consent was obtained from subjects and the testing procedures were approved by the university ethics committee. All participants were informed of the requirements and process of the trial.\n1. Laboratory preparation\nDuring calibration, switch off the lights and remove other possibly reflective objects. Ensure that eight cameras are appropriately placed and have a clear view without reﬂection.\nOpen the Vicon Nexus 1.8.5 program, and then initialize the cameras. Select System | Local System | MX Cameras in the Resources pane and the cameras will engage.\n\tNOTE: In the Properties pane, the parameters need to be adjusted. The range of values of the strobe intensity are adjusted to 0.95-1, and the value range of the threshold is set to 0.2-0.4. Set the grayscale mode to Auto. The Minimum circularity ratio is set to 0.5, and the Gain to times 1 (x1), the Max blob height to 50, and select Enable LEDs.\nPlace the T-frame in the center of the capture area, select all the cameras in the system, and use 2D mode. Confirm that the T-frame is in the camera view without any interference points. Select the first item System Preparation in the toolbar. In the T-Frame drop-down list, select the 5 Marker Wand & T-Frame calibration object.\nIn the System Preparation Tools pane, click the Start button under the Mask Cameras section. Then click the Start button under Calibrate MX camera section.\n\tNOTE: When the calibration process is completed, the progress bar is restored to 0%.\nPlace the T-frame in the center of the camera to establish the origin of the coordinates.\nIn the Tool pane, click the Start button under the Set Volume Origin section.\nPut the treadmill in the center of the test zone. The eight cameras are displayed around the treadmill (Figure 1).",
    "Attach a total of 22 reflective markers (diameter: 14 mm) with double-sided tape on the subjects in advance.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61192/61192fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Test site layout.

Subject preparation\nBefore the test, interview subjects in the laboratory and give a simple explanation of the experimental procedures. Then, have the participants complete a questionnaire. Summarize the results of these questionnaires.\n\t\nUse the following questions:\n\t\t\nHow often do you run in a week?\nHow many years have you been running for?\nHave you suffered any lower extremity injuries or received lower extremity surgeries in the last six months?\nHow many kilometers do you run per week?\nUse the following inclusion criteria: all participants were right leg dominant and without any lower extremity injuries in the previous six months before the study. All participants ran at least 15 km per week.\n\tNOTE: Ten healthy recreational female runners (ages: 23.4±1.3 years; height: 160.7±3.8 cm; mass: 50.3±2.3 kg; running years: 3.2±1.2 years) were selected.\n\t\nObtain written informed consent from participants who meet the inclusion criteria.\nRequire that participants wear uniform tights and pants.\nRecord the subjects’ height (mm), weight (kg), lower limb length (mm), knee width (mm) and ankle width (mm) for the statistics model.\nPlace 16 reflective markers on subjects at the following locations: anterior-superior iliac spine, posterior-superior iliac spine, lateral mid-thigh, lateral knee, lateral mid-shank, lateral malleolus, second metatarsal head, and calcaneus. Place the markers on the second metatarsal head and calcaneus on the corresponding anatomical points of the socks and shoes.\nInstruct the participants to wear uniform sport running shoes. Have the participants warm up with light running and stretching for 5 min.\n3. Static calibration",
    "Click the Data Management button on the toolbar, select Data Management. Click the New Database tab on the toolbar, select the location, describe the trial name and the Clinical Template, and click the create button.\nIn the Open Database window, select the name of the database that was created. In the open interface, click the green New Patient Classification button, the yellow New Patient button, and the grey New session button to create the experimental information including subject type, subject name, and different action status.\n\t\nGo back to the Nexus pane, in the left toolbar, click Subjects to create a New Subject data set, and choose the trial model. In the Properties pane, fill in all the anthropometric measurements: height (mm), weight (kg), lower limb length (mm), knee width (mm) and ankle width (mm).\nClick the Go live button, select Spilt horizontally and choose the graph to check the Trajectory count.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all the markers are visible in the 3D Perspective view. This indicates that all markers can be captured for analysis.\nPrepare to capture the static model. On the Capture Tools pane, click the Start button in the Subject Capture section.\n\tNOTE: During the whole data collection process, the subjects should remain stationary in the capture area to collect 140-200 frames of images. Then click the Stop button.\nIn the perspective pane, view the capture marks. Click the Pipeline button in the Tools pane, select Running The Reconstruct Pipeline to create a 3D image of the captured markers. Then, manually label the static model. When the identification is completed, save and press ESC to exit.",
    "In the toolbar, choose the subject preparation and subject calibration. Select the Static plug-in gait option from the drop-down list. In the Static Settings pane, choose the left foot and right foot, click the start button and save the static model.\n4. Dynamic trials\nWhen finished collecting the static data, select Capture in the right toolbar. Choose Trial Type and Session from top to bottom, and fill in the trial description.\nAsk participants to run on the treadmill in the following manner.\n\t\nWarm up by walking at 8 km/h for 1 min.\nAsk the participant to run on the treadmill at speed of 10 km/h. After an adaption period of 4 min at this velocity, record the running data for 40 s. Collect the kinematic data at a distance of 0.5 km and 5 km, respectively.\nAsk the subjects to wear a heart rate monitor to record the heart rate and monitor the subjects’ fatigue status while running.\nIn the Tool Capture pane, click the Start button. After collecting the dynamic trials, click Stop to end the collection.\n5. Post-processing\nOpen the Data Management window, double-click the trial name. Click the run Reconstruct Pipeline and Labels button in the toolbar to reconstruct the mark point position.\nIn the Perspective window, move the blue triangles on the time bar to set the required range of time.\nShift the view of the timeline so that it shows only the selected range, click on the time bar, and click Zoom to Region-of-Interest.\nAt this point, select the Label button to identify and check the label points, with the same steps as the static identification process. If necessary, supplement some incomplete identification points. Delete the unlabeled marks.",
    "In the Subject Calibration pane, select the Dynamic Plug-in Gait. Click the Start button to run the data. Export motorial trials in c3d format for post-processing.\n6. Data analysis\nProcess the kinematics data. Apply a fourth-order low pass Butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 10 Hz (kinematic) before exporting the joint angle data. Export the data of the joint angle.\nCalculate the range of motion (ROM), peak angle and peak angular velocity of the lower limb joints (hip, knee, and ankle) in three planes (sagittal, frontal, and transverse) during one stance phase.\n7. Statistical analysis\nUse paired-sample T-test to compare lower limb kinematics (peak angles, ROM, peak angular velocity) between the initial (IR) and terminal phase (TR) of 5 km running.\nCalculate mean values and standard deviations of the five valid trials from each subject for different running distances. Set the significance level at p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
