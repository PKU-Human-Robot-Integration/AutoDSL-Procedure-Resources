    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIDR and multivalent domain prediction\nTiming: 30 min\nThe phase separation potential proteins are usually concluded as the intrinsically disordered regions and or multivalent domains in the molecule, and many bioinformatic software have been developed for these predictions. Here, the IUPred2A was used for IDR analysis for RPB1 (RNA Pol II largest subunit) and CTCF.\nGet amino acid sequences of the target protein from the UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/[href=https://www.uniprot.org/]).\nSearch the target protein and select the desired species (here are Human CTCF: P49711 and Human RPB1: P24928) to show the detailed information of the target protein.\nClick the “sequence” to show the protein amino acid sequence, copy the sequence to clipboard.\nOpen the webpage IUPred2A (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/[href=https://iupred2a.elte.hu/]), paste the amino acid sequence into the search box, set the parameter as default, and “submit” directly. After a while, the result will be shown in a new window (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCritical: The region with continuous IUPred2 (red line) score (>0.5) is usually defined as an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), e.g., CTD of RPB1 (aa 1593-1970), and CTD of CTCF (aa 573-727) shown IDR possibilities. The DBD (aa 266-577) of CTCF showed multivalent zinc fingers feature. The length of the IDR and multivalent region is important. If it is too short, the possibility of phase separation is low.\nClone and recombinant express the IDR and multivalent domain\nTiming: 1 week\nIt is difficult to express IDR and multivalent domain proteins in E.coli because they are easily aggregated. Thus, suitable tag fusing is necessary to help the target peptide fold correctly and soluble expression. So, the different plasmid and expressed host cells should be tested.\nClone the IDR and multivalent domain for recombinant expression. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].",
    "Clone the target sequence (Pol II CTD (RPB1, aa 1593-1970), CTCF DBD (ZNF 3-7: aa 322-460)) into pET-28a as “His tag- Sumo-Pol II CTD/CTCF DBD-mEGFP” using the commercialized Gibson ligation kit (https://www.transgenbiotech.com/cloning_vector/peasy_basic_seamless_cloning_and_assembly_kit.html[href=https://www.transgenbiotech.com/cloning_vector/peasy_basic_seamless_cloning_and_assembly_kit.html]).\nSanger sequencing validate the insert, transfect the plasmid into Transetta (DE3) Chemically Competent cells and then examine the recombinant protein expression (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2567-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The optimization program of the IDR and DBD domain proteins expression\nOptional: Generally, soluble Pol II CTD and CTCF DBD expression can be obtained by following this protocol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If more soluble proteins are needed, in addition to the suitable tag fusion, the expression host cell and the induction temperature are also very important for further optimization. If possible, different host cells are worth testing, and the induction at low temperature is better for protein folding. In this protocol test, 16°C–18°C is the best temperature range.\nRecombinant proteins purification. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nPurify the proteins through the general protocol of the recombinant proteins,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] as depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2567-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Purification of the His tag fused Pol II CTD/CTCF DBD, and control proteins\nCheck the purified proteins using SDS-PAGE and coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining.\nMeasure the protein concentration (mass.c (g/L) indicated the mass concentration) using NanoDrop and BCA method (Transgen Easy II Protein Quantitative Kit).\nBased on the predicted molecular weight (mol. wt.) of tag fused Pol II CTD: 80.5 kDa, CTDF DBD: 58.3 kDa, mEGFP 41.9 kDa, calculate the mol concentration (mol.c, mol/L) following the formula: mol.c. = mass.c. / mol. wt., and split into 100 μL/ aliquot (200 μM) in storage buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl (pH8.0), 500 mM NaCl), store at −80°C.",
    "Critical: The purer the proteins, the better for the droplet formation assay. In this protocol, 70%–90% purity of the recombinant proteins (checked by coomassie brilliant blue staining) are able to form droplets normally. To get better results or eliminate the interference of the tag proteins, tag digestion can be tested. The buffer exchange and condensation are simultaneously performed using a hyperfiltration tube. During buffer exchange, protein concentration can be measured using NanoDrop simply, stopping condensation until the concentration is close to 200 μM, and finally confirmed using the BCA kit. The same batch of proteins were diluted to the expected concentration, then aliquoted and stored.\nPause point: The proteins can be stored at −80°C up to 1 year until use.\nDroplet formation of the Pol II CTD and CTCF DBD proteins\nTiming: 1 day\nPol II CTD and CTCF DBD droplet assay in vitro (for different proteins, the pH, temperature, salt, and crowding molecules should be tested12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), for Pol II CTD and CTCF DBD droplet assay, the adoptive and comprehensive protocol were performed, respectively.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPol II CTD droplet formation assay with crowding molecules.\nGet out the stored proteins (200 μM Pol II CTD-mEGFP or mEGFP served as a control) from −80°C, and place them on ice to thaw.\nProtein dilution: add 2 μL thawed proteins into 6 μL Dilution buffer 1 in the 8 tandem PCR tube, mix gently by using the 10 μL pipette 15 times but avoid bubbling, centrifuge briefly.\nOptional: If want to investigate whether the other proteins contribute to the Pol II CTD phase separation, the target proteins can be diluted here together with the Pol II CTD-mEGFP at the indicated concentration1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and then follow the next steps. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].",
    "Prepare the reaction mix (20 μL/reaction): take 16 μL 20% dextran into two new 8 tandem PCR tubes, and add 4 μL diluted Pol II CTD-mEGFP or mEGFP into the 20% dextran, respectively, to get the final 10 μM protein concentration. Then pipette up and down 20 times to mix the phase separation buffer thoroughly by using the 20 μL pipette, avoid bubbling and centrifuge briefly.\nTransfer the mixed protein solution (20 μL) into the bottom of 96 well glass plate, and spread it evenly by gently sliding the 20 μL tip to the entire well.\nIncubate the solution at room temperature (25°C) for 0.5 h, and avoid the light.\nAfter incubation, examine the droplet formation immediately using a confocal microscope (Nikon A1RSi+). Usually for EGFP, set laser strength to 20%, HV 40%, pinhole size (0.7), and field amplification (100× oil-immersion objective lens, 1024 × 1024 pixels, 0.12 μm/pixel). Capture no less than 5 different fields for each condition within 30 min after the droplet formed. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nCTCF DBD proteins can form droplets in vitro without crowding molecules and are also significantly affected by the protein and salt concentration (10 μM protein in 20 mM Tris·HCl and 150 mM NaCl mix is recommended here).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nGet out recombinant CTCF DBD-EGFP proteins from −80°C, and place them on ice to thaw.\nProtein dilution: add 2 μL thawed proteins into 6 μL Dilution buffer 2 in the 8 tandem PCR tube. Mix gently using the 10 μL pipette 15 times but avoid bubbling, and centrifuge briefly.\nOptional: If aim to investigate whether other proteins regulate the CTCF DBD phase separation or not, the candidate proteins can also be prepared together with the CTCF DBD-EGFP proteins.

    "Take 16 μL Dilution buffer 2 into two new 8 tandem PCR tubes, and add 4 μL diluted CTCF DBD-EGFP or EGFP into the dilution buffer, respectively, to get the final 10 μM protein concentration. Then pipette up and down 20 times to mix the phase separation buffer thoroughly by using the 20 μL pipette, avoid bubbling and centrifuge briefly.\nIncubate the protein solution at room temperature (25°C) in dark for 10 min, and immediately load on the glass bottom of the 96-well plate to ensure uniform distribution.\nObserve and image acquire more than 5 different fields using Nikon A1RSi+ scanning confocal microscope with identical microscopy settings, same to recorded as step 5.f.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2567-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pol II CTD droplet assay with different crowd chemicals: e.g., Mock, 10% dextran, 16% dextran, 10% glycerol, 1% PEG8000, 2.5% PEG8000, 5% PEG8000\nPurified mEGFP and RUVBL1/2-mCherry proteins were used as controls. Images were captured under 100× oli lens and scale bar is 25 μm.\nOptional: Besides the dextran, the other crowding molecules such as PEG8000, Ficoll, glycerol with different concentration can be tested for other proteins compared to the negative control (usually the fused tag proteins, exemplify mEGFP/EGFP in this protocol). Here we found that 16% dextran is best for the Pol II CTD phase separation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), but crowding molecules are not needed for CTCF DBD in vitro droplet formation assay.\nNote: The Pol II CTD and CTCF DBD droplet assays are performed separately. Do not set too many different concentration gradients and or other conditions repeats at one time. To finish imaging in time, 3–4 different droplet assays are carried out one time.\nPause point: After imaging, the captured pictures can be analyzed at any suitable time."
